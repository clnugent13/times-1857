These valuable oommoditie., are now for thLe meest partlurniaed from abroad -a largzeportion ahouldbe furisbel by home cultivation. But home cultivation will naever flourish unless flax mills irn estblished, because the English farmer will not go through the manufacturing processe nreesary, to this industry. He will not crnb the seed Into oil and oil-cake, he wilt not steep the straw, grass lt, turn it dry it saruc Is dress the fore and send it to Leeds and other distant markets fo sle These functions are all foreign to his habitsf, and miust theefre be perfdfined in England, if at 511 by mamufacturmng milers Even in the case of wheat the farmer hands over the' mnanufactuing procese-grlndlng-to tho miller. In the case of fisi,. a mnanufacturing miler is still more necemuay, the operations being eo numerous, anid requiring to mnuch practised skill It la the object of the Flax Nills Comnpany to suDply this need. Impediments, roemiagly Iinsperable, long Prevented the introduction, of thre mill system, Two late iuventions-one, fermenting the straw In warm wrater; the other, rolling and washing the fermented straw Immediazely on its removal from the steep-have removed them. A few mils have alresdy sprung up; and all that Is now wanted to eatablish the mill. systemn permanently is tire example and stimulant which this Company seeksa to supply. Its sprospectus was published twice in The Tiimes at full length, in September last, as soonu limited liabilityr was established ; but as the time of year, the then rate of ts.torest. and the hrrh price cf wheat were unfavourable circumelatcesthe Dimreaor, from motives of ecomomy,b3tained from further adverising it at that time. Soveralnoblemen,howeTor,andIandowners feeling themselves saife under the new law, took shares at once, noDta a speculation. but froma a desire to aid inL reviving a valuable Industry, and spaid the deposit, It is a satisfaction to the Directops to b able to inform them, that to this day (June 13, 1857) trn check has heen drawn against those deposits, nor is any debt duie. Tho Directors, being satisfied that crnrine are now mere favourable, again announce the exstence of the company, and hope that it will receive the support tsa importance demas,ds,p ticular.y from the lauded interest.

3IO NEY-3MARKET and CITY INTELLMIGENCE. Saturday Evening. The slight improvement which occurred yesterday in the fuids has not been maintained; and they have been dull throughout the day at a decline of an eighth. The anxiety regarding the next Indian news seems to increase, and it is evident that although the easier state of the money-market must make itself felt, there will be nothing like buoyancy until more definite accounts shall have been re- i ceived. Consols opened at 922 to i, and remained | without variation to the close. Bank Stock was I quoted 212-i' to 214; Reduced, 922 ; New Three per Cents., 92i to X; Exchequer Bonds, 98~i-to .; India Bonds, 10s. to 5s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. This was the 4th of the month, and the payments Falling due were extremely heavy. They appear, however, to have been well met in all directions. The market for foreign securities has been rather flat, and few transactions have taken place. Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. have been negotiated at 9Gi to I; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 81, 801, 81; ditto Three per Cents., Bo; Portuguese, for the'account, 45; Spanish Certificates, 6; Turkish Six: per Cents., for the account, 96§, {; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., (3i ; and the F1our per Cents., 98. The Paris market is still unable to sustain any rise. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. this evening were 67f. 20c. for money, and 6 f. 35c. for the end of the month, showing a renewed fall of a quarter per cent. The Credit 2Iobilier, which lately proclaimed that its proudest function was to assist in keeping up the prices of the public funds, seems not to perform its duties efficiently. Under the circumstances it is scarcely too much to presume that if French credit had been left to itself the results, especially with an abundant harvest and vintage, would have been more satisfactory. The Champion of the Seas, 'which left MIelbourne on the 4th of April, bas arrived with 32,831 ounces of gold, valued at 131,3241. A large portion of it is expected to be purchased for the Bank of France. The dividends on Consols and the other stocks ately shut will be paid to the public on Wednesday the 8th. It has been suggested that instead of being thus postponed, as has always been the case, until three days after they are due, thev should henceforth 'he met at the legal date. The old official quarterdays-the 5th of April, the 5thlof July,. the 10th of October, and the 5th of December-are no longer recognized, and the revenue, trade, and other accounts are made up at the natural termination of each three mionths. In the case of the dividends on the public fufiii,t ia presumed a similar alteration 'would not be expedionbt;-since it is desirable that the whole revenue should be' olltced.. and arranged some short time before these paymei&- .commence, but it is fair to require that under the new system the extra delay of three days should be abolished. The proceedings of railway companies during the -veek havelbeen as f8llows.-The London and NorthWestern shareholders have approved by a large maiority a Bill for converting parts of '-the Shropshire Canal to railway purposes; also, in conjunction with other companies, the construction of a line from Ealing to Richmond, and an agreement for leasing the Cannock Mineral Railway at 5,5001. per annurn, The South Wales Company have sanctioned a subscription of 25,0001. for effecting a junction with Bristol by a railway with a steam ferry across the Severn. The Lancaster and Carlisle Company nave approved the Bills now before Parliament for lines from Kendal to Ingleton, and from the Lands Colliery onlthe Stockton and Darlington line to Tobay; also an agreement to lease the Kendal and Windermere Railway. At meeting of the St. Andrew's and Quebec shareholders the agreement for the Class A shares to be exchanged for par shares in the New Brunswick and Canada Railway and Land Company has been confirmed, The latter company have announced that 40 miles of their line will be completed in a few 'weeks, the cost having been only 2,0001. per mile. An additional 20 miles will be finished by the spring, and the whole distance to Woodstock by the end of next year. Meanwhile a land company is to be organized in connexion withit. TheStockport, Disley, and Whaley-bridge shareholders have approved a Bill for an extension to Buxton. The Ceylon Company bave received the report of Captain Moorsom to the Government. It describes six practicable routes frora Colombo to Kandy, ranging from 79 to 95 miles in length from 706,5571. to 953,5001. in cost, and from 1,0001. to 1,6p01. per week in estimated traffic receipts. He recommends the 79-mile line, which would cost the lowest sum-namely, 706,5571., and yield as great a traffic as any. Tho total estimate, including land, rolling stock, &c., would be 856,5571., while the I immediate returns are calculated to produce 61 per cent. (being i per cent. in excess of the Government guarantee), with the prospect of a constant increase. 'The Southern of France Company have announced a net profit for the year of 124,8081., leaving a surplus of 2,0001. after paying 4 per cent. The shipping returns of the Board of Trade for the month of May show an increase in the amount of tonnage employed commensurate with the commercial activity demonstrated by the declared value of our exportations. As compared with the corresponding month of last year the increase in entrances and clearances was 22 per cent. It is satisfactory to have the tables of our export totals corroborated, since, as theyare unavoidably made up from rough, and often, perhaps, careless statements, they cannot, in the absence of other evidence, be implicitly relied upon:- Entered inward- Letters from St. Petersburg state that the anount of gold now in course of transmission is about 20,0001. or 30,0001. They add that the crops of heip, rye, &c. this year are l;ad, and that prices are rising in the interior. The followving information regarding the mining business of the wecek is extracted from the MZining "The mining share-market has shown more activity this week, ard a good demand has existed for several mines, though still at lower quotations than sellers generally are disposed to take. The Laxey Mining Company have paid a dividend of 501. per share. At East Pool meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of adventurers of 2,0121.; a dividend of 71. lO. per share was made. At the AWining Company of Ireland meeting the available assets were lown as 13,8951., from which a dividend equal to 15 per cent. was declared. The Par Consols meeting have deolared a dividend of 30s. per share. At Great Wheal :Busy Company meeting the accounts showed a balance against the adventurers of 1,9121. ; a call of 20s. per share was made.

The police are still actively engaged in pursuit of the key of the cashier's office, but so far the search has been fruitless. It is said that the additional evidence referred to by the Crown Solicitor in-the course of the second examination is now before the Irish Attorney-General, and that it will be for that functionary to decide whether it shall be produced at the adjourned inquiry on Thursday next or reserved for another stage ia the prosecution. Spollen's son is now under the charge of the police. FATAL PARTY RIOT. The Belfast Mercury-impartial authority-gives the annexed particulars of one of the old Northern party riots, resulting in the loss of life to one man and i serious injuries to several others, which took place in the town of Crossgar on Wednesday night:- "The Orangemen of the town ana neighbourhood of Crossgar assembled there about 9 o'clock on the night of the 1st of July, and began to beat drums and play their favourite airs on fifes and other musical instrments. For some time they were allowed to proceed unmolested in their foolish performance; bar the sound of the drum attracted the attention of the ' navvies ' who are employed in the construction of the extension line of the County Down Railway, which will have a terminus at Crossgar. These men were reinforced by a number of young fellows of the opposite faction to the Orangemen, and a breach of the peace was committed. By whom, or in what manner, the riot was began we have been unable to learn; but it is certain that the rankling bitterness of years was aroused, and a spirit of revenge evoked, which was only too terribly gratified. Firearms were used, and wounds infficted by other and not less deadly weapons. For two hours Crossgar was one scene of lawless violence and confusion, and the worst passions were excited to such an extent as to call forcibly to mind the excesses committed not long ago by our Transatlantic cousins isi the state of Kansas. In the contest, an aged man, named Martin, from Ballywoollen, was shot dead. He was in no way connected with the riotous proceedings, and when he was Z so suddenly deprived of life was in the act of accompanyiug a female friend out of Crossgar, so as to be out of the reach of danger. His remains were removed to the police barracks, where they lay til an inquest was held upon them yesterday by Mr. John A. Ward, coroner for the district. There are many persons seriously injured, but the particulars have not been precisely ascertained. Many houses have suffered severely-those of obnoxious individuals in particular. We hear that the house of Mr. Daniel Smith, publican, has been completely riddled with bulets, and some other premises in the town have suffered in asimilar way. Thisis a lamentable occurrence In a locality but too celebrated foroutrages originating in party spleen. Surely something might be done to put a stop to all demonstrations calculated to give offence to any person, especially on religious or political grounds." THE IRISH CATTE TRADE.

The Registrar-General (Mr. Donnelly) has been early in the field this year, and has just submitted to theLordLieutenant his report and tables, showing the estimated average produce of the crops grown in Ireland in the years 1855 and 1856. From these carefully computed documents it appears that the estimatedtotal produce of the principal crops in the years abovenamed was as under 1855. 18. Wheat Q.0ate6 Qna9.

"Comparing the produce of wheat in 1856 with that in the preceding year wefind anincrease of 109,144 quarters, the total yield last year being also greator than in any of the preceding five years. In oats, however, there was a decrease from the produce of 1855 of 1,029,481 quarters, and, as compared with the produce in the five preceding years, there was a decrease in all--iz., the decrease from the yield of 1850 amounted to 1,105,104 quarters; from that of 1851, to 1,534,367; from that of 1852, to 2,475,659 quarters; from that of 1853, to 1,454,012 garters; and from that of 1854, to 2,056,232 quarters. barley, bere, and rye there has been an invariable decrease since 1850. The decrease in potatoes since 1855 amounts to no less than 1,825,738 tons, but there has been an increase over the yield of 1850 to the extent of 462,553 tons. Turnips, mangold wurtzeL flax, and hay also show a decreased produce per acre compared with 1855, and in cabbage there is a slight increase. On this subject we cannot do better than quote the commentary of Mr. Donnelly, viz.:- " ' Although the yield per acre was less, the total produce of the wheat crop was greater by 109,144 quarters than in 1855. on account of the increased breadth under that crop, amounting to 83,275 acres in 1856. Oats decreased 1,029,481 quarters caused by a diminution of 81,421 acres in the extent sown, and of half a barrel per acre in the average yield of Ireland compared with 1855. Barley and bere also show a lower amount of produce in 1856, a smaller area having been cultivated and the yield per acre being under thatof the previous year. These two crops show a general tendency to decrease for some years past. Rye, with a greater breadth, gives a smaUer total pro- uce in 1856 than in 1855, owing to the difference in the average acreable yield in the two years. Potatoes, with an increased area of 122,403 acres, exhibit a decrease in the total produce of 1856 compared with 1855, the yield per acre being less in the former than in the latter year. In the total yield turnips also show a decrease of 1,492,462 tnns, a smaler breadth -having been sownin 18S56than in 1855, and the average produce being estimated at 12-9 tons per acre in 1856, while in the previous year it was 16 6 tons.' "Without entering into any very minute detail, we may state that in every province except Connaught the acreage under wheat and the estimated produce of that crop exhibit an increase over the year 1855.. InLeinster the produce of wheat for 1856 was 137,218 tons, showing an increase of 4,219 tons; in Munster the produce was 116,437 tons, being an increase of 10, 767; and in Ulster the produce was 68,169, giving an increase of 10,546 tons. In Connaught the wheat crop only yielded 20,446 tons, being a decrease of 2,614 as compared with the produce of the previous year. On the other hand, Connaught is the only province that exhibits an increase in any of the other cereals-viz., an increase in beans of 32 tons. In potatoes, turnips, mangold, cabbage, flax and meadow Leinster exhibits a decrease. In Munster cabbage shows an increase of 3,692 tons, the produce of all the other green crops being considerably smaller than in 1855. Ulster shows an increase in cabbage of 18,034, and in meadow of 35,837 tons; and Connaught an increase in cabbage only of 22,091 tons. The produce of the potato crop of 1856, and the decrease as compared with 1865 in the several provinces, are as follow:-Leinster, 994,i37 tons -decrease 188,024; Munster, 1,139,567 tons-decrease 219,858; Ulster, 1,427,496 tons-decrease, 836,436; Connaught, 846,743 tons-decrease, 582,420. " the province of Leinster-Kilkenny, Wexford, Meath, Dublin, Queen's County, and Kildare werethe greatest wheat-producingcounties,LongfordandWestmeath being the smaUest. In Munster-Cork, Tipperary, Limerick, and Waterford were the largest wheat producers, and Kerry the smallest. In Ulster-the county of Down stands at the head of the list, having yielded an amount of wheat more than twice the greatest quantity produced by any other coanty in the province, and more than 20 times the smallest amount producedby any county. Forinstance, theamount of wheat yielded by the county of Down in 1856 was 219,853 barrels of 20 stone; the preduce of Antrim, which comes next, was 90,391barreh, and that of-Cavan only 9,274 barrels. In Connaught-Galway produced the greatest amoumt of wheat -viz, 90,573 barrels; Mayo the next greatest, 30,082 barrels; and lLeitrim the smallest quantity, yielding only 2,546 barrels." Appended to the agricultural statistics are a number of interesting tables, showing the amount and character of the Irish emigration in the year 1856. Mr. Donnelly says:- " Your Excelency is awmare that returns sbowing the sex, age, and county of every person leaving Ireland, have been furnished to this office since the 1st of May, 1851, distinguishing those who leave the countryfor a merely temporary purpose frora those who depart not intending to return. The tabues compiled from these documents for the period from the 1st of MIay, 1851, to the 31st of December, 1855, were published intheGeneralReportof theCensusCommissioners by which It appears that the population, amounting to 6,552,385 persons on the 30th of 3arch, 1851, was reduced by emigration to 6,077,283 on the 1st of January, 1856, aZlowance being made for the usual increase caused by the excess of births over deaths calculated on the average of these events in Englandand Wales during 16 years. In the year ending the 31st of December, 1856, the returns show that 90,781 persons, of whom 47,570 were male, and 43,211 female, emigrated from the porte of Ireland. This amount, after deducting the estimated excess of births over deaths, makew the probable number of inhabitants in Ireland on the 1st of January, 1857, to have been 6,047,492 persons. "Munster, it appears from the tables, contributed the largest number of emigrants during the period from the ls' of amay, 1851, to tho 1st of Tannary, 1857, 39A47 per cent. of the entire number having leftthat province. Ulster gave 24'68 percent.; Leinster, 21-99 per cent.; and Connaught, 12 59 per cent. Nearly 13 per cent. (12 80) of the entire population have left Ireland since the Ist of May, 1851, to the Ist of last January. Observing the interest taken in the subject by the public press, and also in Parliament, I have had the retarns made up to the end 4f April last, from which it appeas that during the months of January, February, March, and April, this year, the emigrants were mere numerous than in the same months of 1856. The actual numbers were as under:- January. Febrnary. More. ApriL ]Persons. lersons. Persons.

The emigrants from the province of Munster for the period from 1st of May, 1S;51, to the 1st of January last, were In the proportion of 17-82 per cent. to the population by the census of 1851; those from Leinster amounted to W,03 per cent.; from Connaught, to 10i46 per cent.; and from Ulster, 10-29 per cent. " Tipperary contribated the largest proportion of emigrants, 19-35 per cent. having stated themselves to have come from that county. The least emigration was from the county and city of Dublin, only 3 96 per cent having left it. This is the more remarkable, as Dablin is the port at which the greatest number of emigrants embarked. " It will be found from tho tables that, during the entire period embraced by the returrn, the sexes emigrated in the proportion of 101 men to 100 women, while in 1856 the proportion was 11.0 men to 100 women; 687 per cent. of the emigrants in 1856 were betwveen the ages of 15 and 35 years; and only 13-7 per cent, were 35 years old and upwards, showing that the majority of those who left Ireland last year was from among the young and vigorous portion of its inhabitants."

STATE OP TRADE. MANCHESTER, JuLY 4i There has been a moderate business this morning, in. cluding some sales for Calutta, and the modification of the Ruassian tariff is leading to some purchases for export. There is very little change In the market, however, irom yesterday, buyers showing Eome hesitation in entering into new contracts at present prices. Manufacturers ae &L a position, with the] present reduced stocrs, to com,. mand some little advintage in prices for several descrip. tions of goods, but, taken as a whole, the improvement. effected is of slow progress, and scarcely quotable from day to day. For yarns the business is quite equal to what ithaar been for some weeks past, and prices are very firm forspirs. nings suitableiboth tothe home and foreigntrade. The news from India respecting the mutiny among the troops is operating unfavourably, buyers for that quarter, thougAh, as stated above, operating to some extent, manifesting a dispo. aition to wait wvhere orders are not pressing. BIRMINGHA2iL JuLY 4, As usual on the approach of the quarterly meetings of thl various trades of the district, which are to be held during the ensaig week, orders are represented to be scanty, but the prce of all descriptions of manufactured iron is firmly maintained. The American demand is, however, decidedly upon the increase, and, as the new tariff comes into opera. tion during the present montb, a great augmentation of the South Staffordshire iron trade is anticipated. There has been no marked alteration in the position of thecopper and brass manufactures of the town within the last few days. The declines which have recently occurred in the prices of material have not as yet produced the advanta eoes effects which were expected. The wire basiness is slacT, and there is considerably less doing in the tabing department than a few weeks or months back. Those workswhich are active are chiefly employed upon foreign orders, the country trade for brass foundry being languid cnd Inanimate. With regard to copper wire it is stated that the electric branch has been cutup in price by competition, and that the chief manufacturers are careless of entring intonew contracts for supplies at existing rates. The ironfonnders of the district are moderately well emq ployed, and the operatives, with few exceptions, make nocomplaints either as to shortness of work or lownems of wbages At Westbromwich the hollowware trade is busy, and at Redditch the needle manufacture continues unusually active, and the chainmakers at Stourbridge and Cradley aro full of work. At Wolverhampton the tin ware manufac. turers are doing a brisk trade, but generally business im other branchesfor the last two orthree weeks has been dulls The quarterly meeting will be held in Wolverhampton on Wednesday, when more satisfactory information can be. obtained as to the exact position of its varied manufa. turing interests. The factors' warehouses are, considering that the autumz and winter trade has not set in, pretty well off for orders. The fall of metals will not materially operate upon the country trade until the ensaing quarter, when an unusually large demand for hardware manufactures is confidently predicted. Stocks are known to be low throughout every part of the kingdom, and, now discounts are settled and the metal markets considerably easier, an influx of business isreasonably expected. NOTTINGHAM, JuLy 4. The demand for lace for the home market is quiet, and many of the warehouses are now engaged in stock-taking. The foreign trade is also dull, and buyers from the United States having made their purchases, which have been less than in some past seasons, are now returning home. Most. branches of the lace trade are dull; this is, however, usually a flat season of the year, and the high price of both silk and cotton prevents manufacturers accumulating stock. The hosiery trade is exceedingly dull, and has, indeed, been; so for some weeks peast. There does not appear to be any probability of any abate. ment in the price of silkis or yaWrns. LEICESTER, JuLy 4. There is a shade more activity in the hosiery tradeprices offdred, however, are not in proportion to the hig6 rates at which yarns and wool are selling, and orders whichr are being placed for the autumn are at a very small profit. The operatives continue only partially emploved. At tinckley and ia the country districts the hosiery trade is very quiet. LEEDS, JULY 4. The tone of the woollen cloth trade continues tolerablj; satisfactory, though there has scarcely been as much activity manifested this week as last. The shipping houses a pretty fairly occupied, and several buyers for the home market have been dolwn, but they have operated with great. caution. To-day's markets presented no new feature. Ther was a rather large attendance of merchants, and in those descriptions of goods which are princiDally in demandchiefly those suited for the autumn ind winter seasonabout an average business was transacted. In the manu. facturing districts employment is rather better than it was a few weeks ago, though it is not very brisk. The pro. bable future price of the raw material is a matter of coa siderable anxiety to all parties connected vwith the cloth trade for, while there is a preponderance of opinion that it will inrease rather than otherwise, there are those who think it not unlikely that a reaction wiU take place, and that there wiU be a diminution in the value of wool. This uncertainty does not appear to prompt any speculation; and, indeed, in all branches of the trade there is nothing more doing than what is sufficient to mneet iniac. diate requirements. Should the present aspect of the wool trade be maintained, an advance in manufactured goods will no doubt take place; but should we have a bountiful harvest, of which the prospects are at present favourable) there is every anticipation of a steady and healthy trade in woollen cloth during the succeeding months. At the York wool-market on Thursday there was again b large show of wsool, probably 500 or 600 sheets. Some oF the principal dealers were not present, and the market wa heavy. In the end, however, most of the wool shown found. buyers. Paices remained much the same as last week. HAWIAX, JULY 4. There is no important change in the state of trade here; There has been a moderate business during the week,thougb a slght advance whlich has taken place in the price of wool has rather had a tendency to check operations. The profits of both spinners audmanufacturers areatpresent very small, mercant reusig togiv anadvnceProPortionate to ther inctrehased costoiftheraw material.

ThZ GLASGOW POISONING CASE. TRIAT. OF MADELEINE SMITH. .?IDAY, JULY 3-FOURTH DA^y. ::ne eOvience for the proseCution was resumed to-day by thes examination of William Hart and Peter Taylor Young. YoluntProcurators Fiscal for the lower ward of Lanarkshire. Their evidence chiefly related to the mode of recovering and 4itesting the documents in the repositories of the deceased, lasoto the preparation of the case and the communication VI copies of the documents to the prisoner's agents. I Andrew Murray, jun. writer to the Signet, proved the Cccuracy of the print of the portion of the correspondence founded on by the Crown, and in the hauds of counsel on both sides. Rowland HUI MrDonald, controller of sorting depart. 1aent, pist-office, Glasgo w, was oaUed to identify the postmnarke Oni mlmerous envelopss. Robert Monteith aud RIobert Sinclair, packers, in the tmploymont of Huggins and Co., deposed that they had Addressed letters for L' krngelier to "Miss C. Haggart," both at India-street, where the family resided before *Whitsunday, 1856, at the country house at Row, and latterly at 7, Blythswood-square. L'Angelier did not wish Wa handwriting to be known. Janet M'Donald, postmistress at Row, remembered letters comlng to the post-office atqRow in 1855 and 1856, addressed "'Miss Bruce; to be caUed for," and which one of Mr. J3mith's servant's called for. Did not know of any person tamed Bliss Bruce. Catherine bi'Donald, Bridge of Allan, deposed that the family had resided in her house there from the 6th to the 17th of Miarch. Dr. Roberb Telfer Corbet.-I assisted in the examination of the body of M. L'Angelier on the 31st of March, and conLurred in the report then made. The conclusion we came fo was that deceased had died from the effects of irritant poison. The morbid appearances wero of two kinds-one .ghowing the recent and imnmediate action of irritant poison, and the other effects of some antecedent administration. The ulcers on the duodenum were such as I think an irritant poison administered a month before might have produced. I think the in'fammatory action and ulceration were indicative of the administration of arsenic. Jaundice is not a comnion, but an occasional symtom of irritant poison. Extreme thirst is one of the symptoms, and shows itself very early. That is not a symptoln of British cholera in the earlier stages. A dose of arsenic generally shows itself in half an hour or an hour. LoDger neriods have been known, but they are unusaal. ehe early appearance of the symptoms would depend more on the mode of administration and the state of the stomaoh than the quantity. It would operate more quickly, I think, if there had been repeated doses. I have read of cases of murder in which large doses have been administered. I cannot say I hAve heard of 80 grains, but I have read of cases in which the authors describe the doses as being large. Cross-examined.-Twerty grains would certainly be a very lasge dose. It would be a large dose to beadministered, and certainly a very large quantity to be found in the stomach. I cannot ttll of any case of hormicidal administration in which so large a dose was given. I state upon the authority of Dr. Taylor that jaundice is a symptom. (Shown Taylor's work, and asked to point out the passage.) I do notkr.ow the fact except from reading. I think Taylor refers to Christison as his authority. The D:At.-NO, not Christison; but Marshall. If you can give sue a single line except the one now shown me, in wich Taylor refers to Marsball as his authority, namely, at page 6, 1 entreat you to show it to me. Witness.-I am bot aware that it is mentioned in any -other part of the article than the page to which you allude, -but I would require to read it over. The DFAN.- Bat surely when you come here to swear, as a man of skill, that jaundice is a symptom of arsenical poisonimg, you are prepared to give me a better answer than that. D~o ou know that there is a life depending on this Inquiry l Pray keep that in mind. Witess -I know jaundice to be a secondary symptom of -Vrsenical poisoning by my reading. The DAZAN.-Asid is there any reading that you can con-descend on, except what I have pointed out to you? Witness.-Nothing. Cross-examination resumed.-Tho ulcers might be pro. -duced by other causes than irritant poison. I havo never seen ulc'rs in the duodenunm except in this case, butI should conceive that any cause of i,llainmation of the upper intestines would produce them. Re-exau,iued.-The presence of jaundice would not sway me very nuaterially in the view of arsenical nolsoning. I have madie a great many poxt mos*en examinations. Dr. 1enny recalled and re-examined for the Crown.-I have made experiments as to the effect of the colouring matter in the arsenic of Murdoch and Currie, as to how far the colouriing matter could be afterwards detected. I ad. ministered Murdoob's to a dog, and I found no difficulty in detecting the soot in the btomach of the dog. I administered arsenic c,doured by myself with indigo to another dog, and I had no difficulty in detecting the indigo in that case. I administered to another dog a portion of the arsenic sold by Mr. Currie, and I detected black particles in the stomach, but could not undertake to identify the arsenic found with the arsenic given. I found carbonaceous particles, but could not undertake to say that they are of themselves sufficient to identify any particuLar description of arsenic. I could -detect no areenic in the brain, but I found it in the stomach, as well as in the texture of the stomach. Crcas-examined.-I made myself acquainted with the quality of Cteo colouring matter int Cornse's arseniq before -adminiteiisg it to the dog. The particles fonsid in the -dog's stoniach here a close resemblance to the colouring matter, both in their physical appearance and their chyms. cdal pr.opertit s.

John, the eldest son, will bh ahout 1G or 17, and was in an offnce in Glasgow; and Jawp:i is two years younger. He was till the end of March at a school in Edinburgh. The family had a house at Rowaleyn Row. The first winter I was with them they lived in India-street, Glasgow. While they were lin fog there Mliss Smith pointed out a French wentleIa too sme, but did not tell me his name. I never heard his name, that I remember, tiUlI was examiaed. Miss Smith tid l imie he was a friend of hers. She pointed him out to n.e fromu the window one day he was passing, The photogr.1 b. shown me appears to be a likeness of him. He once cane into the house at India-street by the back gate, which Diss Smith requested me to open for him. The family were all At church except tho youngest sister. She took him into the laund2y. They shut the door after them. He remained about half an hour. He camne back at night afterwards un severn- occasi-ns-tbree or four times. He came about 10 o'clook. This was before the hour the family rs-tired, but, so far as I remember, they were not at he-;e. On these occasions he stood at the back gate, and did not come into the house, to my knowledge. I sometiu.es opened the gate when he was not there, that he might coneo in, and sonietimes when 1 went out, at Miss Smith's eesire, to open it he would be there waiting. Miss Omith generally went out to him. The back door was a geed way from the laundry, but they might have gone in there withott my seeing it. I once pointed this gentleman out to Duncan Mackenzie, my present husbaud. I said he was a friend of Mi.'s Smith's, but I do not remember if I mentioned his namue. I have spoken to that gentleman. He once made me a present of a dress vwhile we lived in India-street. He did not say what he gave it for. I never saw him that I xemember, in the neighbourhood of Ilowaleyn. Letters were sos&etiiuies addressed to rme for bliss Smuith at Indiastreet. hoh, said they were coming from her friend, and asked moc to receive then. I thoughtshe meant hi I'Ange- ier.

I have caled for letters niutresed to Miss Bruce at Rowalyen, which I gave to Miss Sucith. bliss Smith lias given me letters to post, I thin -to L'Angelier, but I could not read the name. I have 'posted letters to his address, from India-street, from Blythiwood-sao".r,' aisd from Rovwali-en. I once delivered a letter to the ssue iaddress in Fraiklin-place. I left it at the house. an theoBiuvmswoodasquare house there is a back door, opening totheareaf fthebacklane. hMissSinith askedmneonceto open that haek d'uor. It was a good elog timne beforo she was atPpreEhended. I could not say how many weeks. I think twas not so much Ps two mnonths before she was apprehended.

Miss Smith wished we might stay in the kitchen a little. When sho told me to openthe back door she said she was to see her friend. W'hile I stayed in the kitchen I did n2ot knowv if she was in my bedroom, but I have no doubt she vas. When we heard bliss Smith go to her room we left thc itchen. We heard the door of Miss Smith's bed. room oupen, hut we did not bear the back bedroom door open. Vhen uve went we found our room door shut. There is a front area to the house. The key of the door is sometimes in the kitchen and sometimes in the boy's room. I heard Miss Smith was to be married from her imother. This was ef ore sb: was apprehended. I think r, good while before. I asked ber what she was to do with her other friend, and she told moe then, or soinc tine afterwards,thatshe had given him up. I asked if she had got back her letters. She said, o; do not care." I ence in India-street refused to receive letters for ber. I also refused at one time in Blyths. wood-square, but I don't remenmber if she passed any reaark. she said she could receive letters in at the window. 'fhis was before I had refuned. I have seen L'Angelier in Maltin-street, close to the house. He was walking slowly SaOn tgh1is was in the beginning of the last winter. Miss Xaih could have passed from her bedroom to the kitchen -or uP-stairs without being overheard by us. I never saw anY rats in our house in Blytbswoodsaquare. I remember Sunday, the 22d of March. JIwas unwefftbat day, and kept Tany bed in consequence. I got up between 5 and 6 o'cock -In t-he afternoona. I saw Dussea. Mackenzie that -evnig. He came between 7 and 8. I was at the family 'worship at 9, as also was Miss Smith. Mackenzie remained below. 'I left Miss Smith in tho -dining-room, anld did not see her agai that evenlnr. wrent to bed atI0.

I remember her being at An evening i party, between the Sunday and the Thursday. I cannot say if it was Wednesday evening. The key of the back door was kept that night in my bedroom. It was about 8 in the morning that Miss Smith was missed. There was a key to the back gate of the area, of which I had qharge. It isa wooden gate in a high wall. The key of tho back door of the house generaUy stood on the walL The back gate was sometimes locked, but more generally I "anibbed." The key of the low frontdoor wasalways leftin the lock, as also the key of the high front door. It was the key of the front area gate that the boy kept. I had'obarge of Miss Smith's bedroom. I never during February or March saw the water she washed in peculiarly black or peculiarly blao. Cross-examined.-I think it was soon after Miss Smith pointed out her friond that I knew of the correspondence. at was in April or May of 1856 the family went to Row. It would be a good while before this I know-of the correspond. ence. After I had received some of the letters I decline I to take inore. Her mother found out that something was going on, and forbade me to receive any letters. Tho family came back from Row in November last. I do bot remember how long it was after the family's return that this gentleman came to the house, but it was a good while. I remember the family going to Bridge of Allan. It was a good while before this that he came. I could not say how long before. I do not rermember the time MIrs. Smith told me that Miss Smith was to be married, but it was ba. fore we went to Bridge of Allan in March. Theinterview of the gentleman with Miss Smith might have been in the lobby. Her youngest sister slept with ber, and she would be in bed by that time. My present husband was pretty frequently about the house at that time-several times in the course of a week. Duncan Mackenzie went out by the back door on the Sunday night. I saw him to the outer gate and " snibbed it." I have no reason to suppose I did not lock the inner door as usual. After leaving Miss Smith in the dining-room I did not see her that night. She gave me no reason to suppose she had had any meeting. I do not know if ?diss Smith and Miss Janet went to bed together that night. Thelock of the back door makes a considerable noise wben it is turned. It is close to my bedroom, The window of our room looks into the back area, and is secured by iron stanchions. By the CouiT.-When the family -went to Bridge o Allan the servants were left at home. I saw Miss Smith when she came back on the Thursday from Row. She had a small carnetbag with her. It was not very small, but it was such as a lady might carry. It was in India-street that I was desired by Mrs. Smith not to receive letters for Miss Smith, but I did receive some afterwards. The LODD JuwTicx CssRr.-I suppose in reality, as Mackenzie was visiting you, you were willing to oblige the young lady? (A laugh.) Charlotte M'Lean.-I was cook in Mr. Smith's family for six montba, up till last Whit Sunday. I never saw any gentleman visiting Miss Smith without the knowledge of her family, nor had heard of it. I never got letters to deliver or post to M. L'Angelier. I never know of her receiving such letters. I never saw letters come addressed to Miss Bruce. I remember one night Christina Haggart asking me to remain longer in the kitohen, as some person was speaking to Miss Smath. I afterwards heard her go into her bedroom, on which we went to our room. I was at family worship on Sunday night, the 22d of March, and left Mliss Smith upstairs. I did not know of any person being in during the night. I heard no noise. Cross examined.-It was near 11 that night when we went Duncan Mackenzie.-I was married recently to Christina Haggart. I was visiting her on Sunday the 22d of Marobc I left about 10 by the back gate. I was in the way of visiting her when the family lived in India-street. She once pointed out a gentleman to me at the back door of the houee, but she did not tell me his nauae nor anything about bim. Cro&s-examined.-I spoke to this gentleman. I was coming up to the houte, and he asked me if I was going in. He asked if 1 knew Christina. He asked pie to ask her to go out to speak to him. She went out. I did not hear what they said. I was not jealous about this, but she was afraid I might be. I had a letter afterwards, signed " M. Smith," telling me it was her friend I had seen, and hoping nothing would arise between us in consequence. I did not preserve the letter. I neverl saw that gentleman again. I was frequently about that house afterwards, and subsequently about the house in Blythswood-square, but never saw him again. James Galloway deposed to having seen L'Angelier going up Sauchiehall-street on Sunday the 22d March, about 9 o'clock. That woald be in the directlon from Franklinplace to Blythswood-square. Cross-exau,ined.-HIe was walking rather slowly. Mary Tweedle deposed to his calling at Mrs. Parr's, St. Vincent-street, at 20 minutes past 9. He called for Mr. M'Alester, who was not in. Blythswood-square is five minutes walk fromathere. Thomas Kavan, night constable, Glasgow police.-My beat in March last included the north and east sides of Blytlbswood-square, and thus included Mr. Smith's house at No. 7. (Shown photograph of L'Aiigelier.) I have seen that person more than once. I saw him atleast two months previous to my being examined about hini. I saw him in Main-street. As well as I can recollect, it would be 10 or 11 o'clock. He was standing at the lamppost near the lane. He once accosted me and said, "It's a cold night, policeman; do you emoke 1 I said "Yes-" and he gave me two cigars. When I saw him he was about the breadth of this courthouse from Mr. Smith's house. I recollect having seen him some 10 or 19 days after the first time. He was passing along, the garden side, on the north side of Blyth8wood-square, going east towards West Regent-street. He was passing opposite 6 and 6, which are west of No. 7, and he was going east. I saw him again a fortnight or three weeks previous to the time I was examined. I saw him at the-corner of West- tegent-street coming-towaedu Bhyths!wood-square. It, migbt be, -between 9 and 10 eclock. 'I never sawbiin again. Crotssexamined.-I was examined on the 2d of April. I was on my beat on Sunday the 22d of March. I am quite sure 1 did not see him that night. William Young, photographer, Helensburgh (shown the photograph found in L'Aagelier's lodgings).-I made this pbotograph. It is a portrait of Miss Madeleine Smith. It was done in Septeinber, 1856, at her desire. Mrs. Towers.-I am sister to Miss Perry, who lives in Glasgow. I live in Chester, but in March last my husbaud and I lived at Portobello, near Edinburgh. I remember L'Angelier coming to visit us there. He dined with us. He talked of his health almost the whole time. He said he bad been given cocoa and coffee, but after taking, them thev had disagreed with hins, and he had been very il. He saia be had not been accustomed to them. He made the remark that he thought ho had been poisoned. This was after saeaking of the coffee and cocoa. Nothing was said or asked avout who hbad poisoned him. James Towers, husband of last witness.-I was at one time a mlerchant in Glasgow, but resided in Portobello in Mlarch last. I had met L Angelier at my sister-in-law's in Glasgow. I remember his dining with us in March. He told us he had had a very violent bilious attack or jaundice. He said he had had tvo at'acks after taking cocoa or coffee. He said he throught himself poisoned after taking the cocoa and coffee. I remarked who would poiSon him, or what object could there he for that? but I do not recoUect he made any answer. 'He told us he was-going to return to Glasgow, and was after that going to Bridge of Allan. He looked quite well. I understood he had taken the coffee and cocoa at different times. Cross-examined.-He ate a good dinner and talked a good dual. He certainly was of a talkative tanm. He spoke much of his complaints, and seemed fond of talking about hiumself. I thou0if him a vain person. He said he had always taken coffee, but he was not surprised the cocoa had disagreed with him as he was not in the habit of taking it. Mary Arthur Perry.-I live at 144, Renfrew-street, Glasgow. I knew the late M. L'Angeher. I became acquainted with him in 1853. We both attended the chapel of St. Jnde's. About the spring of 1855 I came to krow him more intimately. In the summer of 18s5 he was engaged to a lady named Miss Madelline Smith, and I was made aware afterwards of the progress of his attachmient anl correspondence. In August, 1855, he brought her to call on ue. I after that received several lette-s from her. [Shown and identified Nos. 11, 19, 20, and 27, as letters from the prisoner.] No. 27 is signed "M Mini." It is a pet name, and the name whiels M. L'Angelier called her. [Also shown anld ideLtified, 29, 45, and 83, .1so letters from Miss Smith wnritten at intervals. Shown 141.] That is a letter from MI. L'Angelier to me. It is dated the 20th of March, and says-" Is hould have come and seen some one last night, but the letter came too late, so that we are both disappointed. L'Angelier frequently visited at my house. He. had general good health, but latterly was not so well as foimerly." I think he told me in February he bad heard of* anotber gentleman paying his addresses to Miss Smith. He said at one time she had denied it, and that at another time sbe evaded the question. He dined with me on the 17th of February. He told me then that he expected to see Miss Smith on the Thursday following. I did not see him again till the 2d of March. He was then looking extremely ill. We bad some conversation about his illness. He said "1 I never expected to have seen you again, I have been so ill." He did not teR me he had seen Miss Smith on the 19th' of Febmuary. He told me had had a cup of chocolate, which had made him ill. It was on the 9th of March he told me this, when hq took tea with mne. On the 2d le said be could sot attribute it to any cause; but on the 9th ho said, I I can't think why I waso unwell after getting that coffee and chocolate from her." I understood him to refer to two occasions. He was talking of Miss Smith when he said "' her." He did not say if the ilhiess he had on getting the chocolate was the eame illness of which he had spoken on the 2d of March, but I did not know of his having any other illness. On the 9th of March he was talking of his extreme attachment to Miss Smith. He said, "Ittis a perfect infatuation I have for her; if ahe were to poison me I would forgive her." I said, "You ought not to allow such thoughts to pass through your mind. What motive could she have to do you any harm?" Le said, "I don't know that ; perhaps she might not be sorry to get rid of me." All this was said in earnest. I interpreted the expression to mean to get rid of her engagement. There seemed to be some suspicion on his mind as to what Miss Smith had given him, but it was not a serious suspicion. I never saw bimi a-ain alive. He said to me that he had once offered to EMiss Smith to discontinue the engagement, but she objected to it then. She wished afterwards that their photographs should be returned to each other. He had offered to return her letters to her father. I received a message on the 23d of March about 10 o'clock that M. L'Angelier was very ill. I went about midday and found him dead. I called on Mrs. Smith, and intimated the death to her. I tsawthe prisn but did not intimate it te her. She b and shook hands, asking 'm to walk into the drawing-room. I asked to see mrs. Smith privately, and said that Miss Smith would become acquainted with the object of my message. I never had seen Mrs. Smith before. I had a warm friendship for M. L'Angelier, and thought him a strictly moral, indeed a religiou3 man. He was very regulr in attendance at church. I was very muoh agitated and startled to find him dead. Cross-examined.-I was not acquainted with Mr. Smith's family. L'Angelier told me, vhen the engagement was first fixedhe wished to inforn. her father, but Ihe objecWk to that. He asked her to speak to him herself, whi h the also refused. This was a uQurce of muzch istress. to Iinmat- the time. M. Angelier was asquainted -with Miss -,Smih's| sister, but not her father or mother. Tbe engaseient had only existesd a few weeks wthen Mtiss Smith was introdfueetto -4 n e. L' Angolier cold me he had met MiEs Silyiit first a,tMXr.; Baird's. I was awareothat. the intimacy was disapproved by the family, and that the- engagement wiss brbken off at one time. I never knewr whether the lather and uother had abated in their dislike to the intimacy. I wrote on one occasion to Miss Smith advising hertomention the matter to her parents, and I advised L'Angelier not to renew the engagement after it was broken off. The engaget, ent was renewed provisionaUly, Miss Smith having prommsed, on a proper opportunity, to tell her parents. I knew that they met clandestinely. I corresponded with both of them. (Shown No. 11 of the third inventory for the prisoner.) The postmark of that letter is the 7tb of February. Tbe letter said:-.

We had' cotresponded at intervals for the last twto years. fII used to address me as "Dear Mlary," or "My ,deav Mary," bat never "De3reet Mary." I was introduced to him by a lady named Mliss Philpot, who is now in England. I believe his mother lived in Jersey. I never inquired her occupation. He had two sisters~ also a brother, who died. I remJembered the date of L'Angelier's first ill'. ness, after my first precognition. It was mentiQned in my presence then that the first illness was on the 19th' but I also remember it from other circumstances. When tho 19th was spoken of, one of the clerks said that is the Aote he mentions of his firstiDness in his ketbook. I to d notesb ofrmy precoluition afterwards. Iwas advised todoio bya frienu,tbat might be clear and distinct. Down to the time the 19th was mentioned by the clerk I had not remert-' bored the date of his illness. I wras precognised on the 6th of April, 7th of April, 23d of April, 4th of Jne,,Sth of. June, and 23d of Jnne, in all six times. By the COUtRT.-I nevev saw the Sheriff at any of thieso By the DEA.x-Ot vthe2d a£ Iarchhds baton hi first ilness he fel on the floor, and was unable to caU assiAt, ance. At last he rept on his hands and khees and kthodked on the wall, when the landlady came. He said be never had anything like it before. His second-ilness he: called jaundie,or a bilious attack. It was sometime prior toMiarch that he told me of the proposals to discontinue the ,engsge- ment. He imagined she seemed to be-getting cool, s_d6t-td if she wished to break it off he w uld accede to her 4e-tlses. At that time she did not shto iscontinue it. Ies pko of this ss having happened some tire before. It was after that that she proposed a return of her letters, and vihen he offered to return the letters through her father 1understood this to be a consent on his part to givevp the engagement. Miss Smith would not accede to the proposal to give her letters to her father, and the engageiaeut remained Un-! broken, as I understood, at Miss Smith's desire. A lengthened discussion then took plaee.as tothe admis sibility of the letters, which were objected 'to by the de-' fesidant's counsel, on account of the careless and irregular manner in which they had been recovered, and because they had no proof that all the documents had actually been recovered. It was roplied tbat no objections had been taken snfficient to exclude the documents, and that any objections that were of any weight were matters for the iry. TlVi Court decided that, whatever observatiomau's to the usodetof recovering and attesting these documents mightbe made on behalf of the prisoner, no. ground had been stated sutfficieut to exclude them as evidence. The Court adjourned at 6 o'clock till Saturday morning. SATURDAY, JULY 4.-FifTH DAY. The evidence for the prosecution was resumed. Dr. Christison, recalled and deposed,-I think it wotld be very unsafe indeed to use arsenio by -putting an ounde into water and washing in it. I should expect inflammation of the eyes and nostrils, and probably of the mouth, to resalt from it, and, once taking hold of the skin, arsenic being'an insoluble solid, it would not be easily got rid of. -I never. heard of arsenic being so used. A preparation of arsenic. is used as a depilatory. It is a sublimate of arsenib and a sublimate of ime, hut it is only used for removing hir. Cross-examiined.-Arsenic is not abeolutely insoluble in cold water. If put into cold water originally, a SOOt Wpart is all that would probably be dissolved, bat if the water ad been first boiled and then cooled a 32d part would be dissolved. It is only the finer powder of it that would be suspended in the water. If au ounce were put into a basin of water, not much of it would be suspended in It without agitaton. I cannot absolutely say whether washing in it iight not be productive of dangerous results, but I think it would be a very impradent thing. I should not like to do it myself. I cannot say how long the finer owder might remain suspended. I should say that in three or four minutes scarcely any of the arsenic would remain in iuspeni sion, but I am speaking without authority. By the CoUn.T.-There is a controversy as to whether arsenic has any taste. Dr. Orfila, a much better autliopity than I am, maintains that it has a taste;, but experirmenu. were made by myself and two other scientific gentleaen, so far as it was possible with so dangerous a tubstanc9, and woe found the taste very slight indeed-a little sweetis. Th6 other gentlemen concurred in that opinion. It has always struck me as very strange that neither Orfila nor any of the authors who have doubted my observations have said that they made any experiments themselves. Otfila' merely. expresses his belief it has a taste, notwithstandi4g. what I have stated. -I. think 4lo, taste .ist 0ot. such as,~Iaken. in offee -Or cocoa, dlc-ri t ra who have taken a rsgrlalgely w ithoatl crowlng at the time what it was observed no taste-sometimes a sweetish taste, sometimes a wn acrid taste; but ix r fgard to the acri- mony there are two falacies-first, that when-asked afterwards about it they confounded the roughuess- of it iwith the acrimony; and, secondly, the burning effecet slowly developed by the poison afterwards. By the DEA?f.-The arsenic was sometimeg given in a simple fluid, such as coffee or water; sometimes in thicker substances, as in soup. I caunot say what quantities wdre given in the cases referred to. I have only seen two ca es of poisoning by arsenic in my lifetime. .The cases I have referred to are merely recorded. Dr. Orfila is undoubtedly a high authority in medico-legal chymistry. In the arsenic we tested we took it both in a solid and liquid state, and allowed it to pass along the tongue as far as we cot4ld do it with safety, and allowed it to romain a couple of inuisstes in the mouth and then spat it out, We took, pethaps, one or two grains each in our mouth, and we kept it slfficiently long to ascertain the taste. The DE,,.--The taste of that quantity. By the L ORD AD VOCATE&-Iu the great majority of crimi. nal cases the quantity of arsenic taken is not ascertained, even within a presumption. By the CousRT.-Orffla once maintained that there was arsenic in the human body, but he afterwards retracted that opinion. By the DEaN.-It is n ew to me to hear that any author has said that arsenic is natarally found in the stomach. The letters founded upon as evidence for the Crown were then read. They were very numerous; but the following' copious extracts sufflciently show the nature an d progres, of the attachment and intimacy between the priso,uer and the deceased No. 1 of inventory for the Crown, letter enclosed in envelope, bearing the postmark "A April 3, 1835" - Mlt`Ny dear E,nlle.-I dlo not feel as if I were writing You for ti-s frttme.

THB PUBLICATION OF SCHOOL ROOKS BY THE GOERYBMENT AT THE PUBLIC BXPI\ATSE. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In his speech last night in the House of Commons, the member for Edinburgh having read only extracts from my'letter to him on the abore subject, I beg the favour of its insertion complete. I am. Sir vnour AlWhinflf c TItOh3AS LO2TGMAN. June 30. " 39, Paternoster-row, June 27. "My dear Sir,-As I understand that the estimates embracing the cost of production and sale of the school books of the Commissioners of Education in Irelard wiU shortly be under the consideration of the House of Commons, I take the opportunity of informing You that in a letter I had from Mr. James Wilson, dated February 10. 1853, he stated that it had been decided upon. 'that the Government should close their bookselling establishments and agencies.' " In a subsequent letter from Mtr. James Wilson to me, dated ' Treasury-chamnbers, August 27, 1853,' he fu-ther states that ' it appeared desirable on the part of the Government to take this step as soon as the present contracts were concluded, or sooner should the contractors be willing to give their consent.' "The contracts referred to expire in February, 1S5S. 'EOn this subject I can quote no higher authority than Sir James Kay Shattleworth, who in his work on Publc Edtswotion, pu,blished in 1853, remarks:- It is essental hat the Government should avoid every form of interferenco which could discouraga individual enterprise, the freedom of opinion,andtbenaturail actionof llterature onthepopularintsUlignce andtaste, or of the trade in books In their production and diffusion. The Governrnent is not an author, abolder of copyrigbts, a publisber o books, nor a patrmn of metbols; muca leso is It to Interfere in the formation o opinion, by maldng schools the organs of ita own doo. trine. Icosur with the great publishing house of London in their ,bjectlons to any sale of the books of the Ireh Comnmissionera In Great Britain, except through the ordinary cbannels of trade.' '4 When it is an obvious fact that there is no branch of trade in vwhich there shouid be more free competition than in the writing and publishing of school books, it seems almost absurd to ask how it can have been permiitted that the Government, or their representatives, should continue to purchase or possess copyrights, and this pii themselves to the patronage and use of any particular. book, when bettor books may appear the next day unless crushed by the fear of Government patronage anidmonopoly ? " I am induced to say thusmnch by the circumstance of purchases of copyrights lately made by the National Board of Educationin Ireland in deflance Of thel -n,,-1I -,i; - know]edgcd principles of the Government; and, indeed; if any further arguments were necessary to prove how incapa. ble a Governmentboard must ever be to conduet a tradewhich requires more than any other the active vigilance. of those who devote their whole time, and t*dents to aarry. rights of which I b-ve referred to wero when in the hands of regular traders sold to tho 'rado at Is. and 4s. 3dL respectively, they are, since this purchase of the copyrightsby the board, now sold to the trade at Is. Sd. and 6s.,> in. crease of price of at least 2S per cent. "I beg to sabmib that an. enlightensi and libasal Goverement should purchaso books for their own purposes. wvherever they sax buy best and cheap^sb; that thXr shonld abandon all trading in boolm and* the monopoly of copy-. rights, as such r. syatera can tend only to the dag adathon and hindranceof othat advanca in. knowledge v'hich it should be their objechto-promote.

LORDON, OMORVDAY, JULY 6, 1857. Blood has again been shed in Italy without a result. There has been murder at Genoa, but not an insurrection. The scaffold is awaiting its victims; the Italian people are no whit nearer their national independence in consequence of this miserable crime. We have denounced Filibusterism in the Far West; the system is as useless as fatal-as wicked in the Old as in the New World. It does not, however, proceed upon the same ground in the two hemispheres. On the shores of the great Mexican Gulf an apt representative of those pitiless bucaniers who in former days infested the keys and islets of the Caribbean Sea collects together the offscourings of American cities, inveigles certain needy and sanguine men into his net, and with this forlorn hope of vagabonds and dupes throws himself upon that point which he may deem the weakest, and the work of pillage, incendiarism, and massacre is urged on with great spirit. The expectation in this case is that the Government at Washington may be induced to endorse the bill which such a rufflian as WAr.Ex has drawn in characters of blood upon the feeble inhabitants of the American Isthmus. If he be successful he looks for support; if he fail,* for the meas of flight. In the Italian Peninsula, on the other hand, Filibusterism rests upon another basis. It is not enough that the stifled groans of tortured menthat the tears of families bereft of their chief supports-that the deep discontent of all should mock the blue skies and pleasant seas of Naples in the various forms of undeserved suffering and sorrow; it is not enough that the dungeons of Rome should be stuffed with the victims of pliestly suspicion-that Austrian bayonets from the Alps down to Central Italy should maintain the terrible monotony of resignationthis is not enough; the executioner and the firing party must be met half way. The consciousness of wrong, the scea indignatio, must be kept alive by fresh sacrifices of human hfe, else it is feared that the slaves would hug too closely their comfortable chains, and learn too readily the dull lesson of forgetfulness. The system-if ;system it can be called-is, that from time to time a batch of fresh victims should be cast down before the bayonets of some atrong guard, or before the walls of some impregnable fort, not with the hope of forcing the guard or carrying the fort, but simply and purely that they may be consigned to the scaffold, and that Italy may talk of their execution. This is not the way in which the deliverance of a people can be worked out. Common humanity and common sense revolt against this idle waste of human life. Will the Italian patriots, as they love to style themselves, never learn the lesson that it is their true policy to take advantage of the mistakes of the Governments-not to leave the Governments to profit by the mistakes which they are daily making themselves ? Italy will not rise because two or three scores of misguided wretches are annually consigned to chains or to the scaffold. Millions of Italians are interested in obtaining security for their lives and their property, and in the establishment of some form of national government under which they may enjoy such a degree of civil and political liberty as is fitted to their condition; they are not interested in the support of these desperate attempts. It is difficult to believe that the true Italian patriotstcan be affected by any stronger feeling than passing commiseration for the fate of those who have so wantonly courted their own destruction-such commiseration as an European spectator might have felt in former days for the crazy zealots who, of their own accord, flung themselves down before the advancing car of the Hindoo idoL Of what advantage was it to humanity that these men perishedg We have to-day to record the melancholy fact that there has been a fresh insurrectionary attempt, and, of all districts of the Italian Peninsula, just in that one to which all reasonable men are looking with hope and confidence as thbe only one in whichthe work of Italian freedom has made some certain progress. We do not pretend a3 yet to explain the meaning of this foolish proceeding. We are not in the secrets of the petty Italian camarilas, which in the various foreign capitals receive their inspiration from the leading refugees. We know no more of the matter than we publish to-day for the information of our readers. It seems that, some 10 days back, the Sardinian Government had received information that an insurrectionary movement was intended at Genoa. On the 30th of last month the good people of Turin were startled with the intelligence that such a movement had actually taken place on the preceding niight, but that it had been entirely defeated and put down. The enterprise seems to have been conducted with about the same measure of discretion as our own celebrated :13allingarry campaign. A few emigr&s had evaded the precautions of the authorities, and for their own misfortune had made their way into Genoa. They were neither respectable nor numerous. In addition to these " regulars" of insurrection, a few Genoese had taken share in the plot. At Genoa, as we are told, there is a certain amount of discontent at some recent Excise regulations, and at the Bill for the removal of the Royal Navyfrom Genoa to Spezzia, but such grievances, according to our northern notions, might be satisfied oy a spirited discussion in the Chamber of Deputies-they scarcely necessitate a revolution and the shedding of blood. The good old dramatic machinery of Italian insurrection, with its daggers and its mystery, was, however, brought into play. When night drew on a small party attempted to make their way into the forts of the Diamante and Sperone, and were of course disarmed and captured. This result, however, was not obtained until they had murdered an unfortunate sergeant who endeavoured single-handed to resist their entrance. The poor man fell, as a soldier should fall, in the discharge of his duty; his murderer -an :hisatnts Will be executed as a matter of edurse. Th& electric wire between Turin and Genoa was cut at a certain point, in order to prevent communication, but the force of the insurgents was so ridicnlously disproportioned to the magnificence of their attempt that this act may be reckoned as one of simple mischief. Our information is as yet too uncertain to enable us to speak with any confidence, but it was rumoured at Genoa that the emigrants engaged in this attempt had looked for simultaneous risings at Carrara, at Elorence, at Naples, and elsewhere. About forty persons had been arrested, and about fifty more, it is said, contrived to get on board a steamer, and compelled the master and crew to steer, as some say, for Sicily, or, according to others, for a point of the Neapolitan coast. It is added that as soon as they landed they were met and overpowered by an armed force present on the spot, that some were killed, some were captured, and others succeeded in making their escape to the mountains of Calabria, where the most fiery antagonists of the Neapolitan Government are leading the lives of hunted deer. This is all we know as yet of this last and most miserable attempt at insurrection in Italy. Now, on such imperfect information as that upon which we are writing it would be too much to charge this last act of madness to the account of M. MAZZiNI or any of his felows. It is certain, however, that they are the disease of which these idle and petty insurrections are but the symptoms. They openly advocato the system,and, if not directly, are indirectly responsible for its consequences. We most earnestly protest, in the name of humanity and civilization, against any further perseverance in such a policy. In 1835 the spark of Italian independence was for a while stamped out under the rough tread of a foreign soldiery. The Battle of Novara was a second and solemn warning that the time for winning independence had not yet come, even when Italy had cast aside the dagger of the midnight conspirator, and had stepped manfully into the field to win the rights of freemen with the freeman!s steel. .Jbi4g h ever cone, nothing will ever come, of-his coquetry wii the shambles. We even doubt if the cause of Italian independence will ever be much advanced by any plot that the brain of, a refugee can devise or the arm of a refugee can accomplish. Where shall we turn for examples in history of national free- dom won by the efforts of an " emigration ?" The fate of the emigrant is a sad one, and we would speak of it withput disrespect, as of any real calamity which affects our fellow-creatures. It seems almost a necessity of his position that his imagination should become heated, his brain disordered, that his plans should be Quixotism, his policy a dream. In some miserable garrethis poverty is no reproach-he grimly considers the fate of empires which he is to conquer, of strong Governments which he is to overthrow, although he may be sorely driven to provide for himself the means of daily sustenance. He has no means of rectifyiDg his conclusions by realities. He cherishes one idea in the secret chambers of his brain, forin whom shall he have confidenjice?and in the bitterness of his heart, for is not his fate lamentable? The idea which he himself would have scouted as ridiculous, impracticable, wicked, when he was first consigned to this dreary seclusion of thought and feeling, takes form at last from habit and frOm time it is gradually invested with the sober hues of reality, it is to be carried out in practice, and of course it falls. It is a solemn truth that the independence of Italy will never be achieved by the men who have fled or have been driven from her soil, and who have spent the best years of their lives in exile, and in the errors which are the consequences of exile. The task is reserved for working men-for men, it I may be, of aspirations less lofty and of less culti- vated intellect, but, at any rate, for men who have remained in Italy.
The extraordinary position of our tropical Colonies was forcibly illustrated in the discussion which occurred in the House of Commons on Friday evening respecting the introduction of labour into British Guiana. At the very moment that the high price of sugar is making itself felt most keenly, and a failure is apprehended in the supply of that material which furnishes the very lifeblood of British trade, Mr. THo-&s BARnIG reminds the ILegislature that our Colony of Guiana contains 50,000,000 acres of the most fertile land in the world; that it has every advantage of internal communication, with an extensive seaboard for the resort of shipping; is within a month or six weeks' sail of our shores, and could produce cotton and sugar in all the abundance that consumers or manufacturers could desire. One element only is wanting to the realization of these natural bounties, and that is the labour of man. The soil, the climate, the capacities of aU kinds are favourable in the extreme; the territory is our own, and it lies within easy reach; but there are no labourers forthcoming to turn these advantages to account. Even those peculiar elements which are said to be wanting to the agriculture of India-energy and capital-are not lacking in Guiana, for British planters 'are established in the Colony, and are prepared with all other requisites, if they could but obtain hands to do good work at good wages. Nothing beyond this is needed to bring plenty into our markets, and relieve the anxieties which, as our readers saw, have been again expressed on behalf of oifr staple manufacture. In this world it is usualy found that embarrassments of this description admit of removal by proceedings fraught with a double benefit. The abundance of one district is made to ease the necessities of another, and both gain alike by the establishment of an equilibrium. Our Colonies want labour; other countries are overstocked with it. In China, for instance, the population has so far outgrown the territory that the Chinese go off in swarms, like bees, to any quarter of theworld which wil receive them. In India, again, though the redundance is not quite so striking, the country teems with life, and labour is so cheap that it barely admits of being bartered for subsistence. From India, therefore, and from China labour has found its way to the Colonies in question, but so great isthedistanee and so serious the impediments interposed that, except in the case of the Mlauritius, the supply has been very insufficient. That island, however, furnishes an excellent illustration of the state of things which might be brought about. Within the last ten years, as Mr. LAnouCHERa informed the House, it has received from India no fewer than 100,000 Coolies. This reinforcement of workmen has enabled the planters to cultivate sugar not only at a profit, but " at a " greater profit than by slave labour," while the high prosperity of the Colony thus induced, " so "far from being purchased at the expense of in"humanity towards these labourers, enabled them "to accumulate property and settle on the island, "or, if they returned to their native country, "they carried the fruits of their industry with "them." All this while it must be remembered that the Slave Trade itself undergoes heavy discouragement from such successful competition, and that our own markets experience the benefit of most seasonable importations, so that all parties together -the colonial proprietor, the British consumer, and the actual labourer-derive advantage from the system, whi?h injures nobody except the Slave. dealer. We do not see how a stronger case could possibly be made out. By the simple agency of labour one of our Colonies is able to amass wealth, to stock our markets with its exports, to benefit the population of another land, and to act like a thorn in the side of the Slavetrader. For the want of this same agency others of our Colonies are running to ruin, are exporting but little produce, are doing no good to anybody, and are permitting the Slave merchants to thrive in the absence of the competition they might establish. If these facts do not make a case for supplying not only Guiana but our other settlements too with free labour in proper abundance, we are at a loss to see how any proposition can be proved at all. What is the obstacle in the way ? The distance. If the West Indies, said Mr. LABOUCcERE, had not enjoyed the same advantages as the Mauritius it was " owing to their geographical "position in relation to the source of the supply "of labour not being so favourable." But is there only one such source ? Is not Africa as populous in many parts as India ? is it not as conveniently situated in regard to the West Indies as India is with regard to the Mauritius ? And, above all, are not the Africans pre-eminently fitted by nature for tropical labour? Every one of these questions must be answered in the affirmative. It is easier to bring Negroes from Africa than Coolies from India or Chinamen from Hongkong, and when brought they would make the best of labourers. We are driven, therefore, to seek elsewhere for reasons against the proceeding, and such arguments were produced by Mr. LABoUCIIZB in the debate, and will be found embodied in a letter from Mr. M. FoRsTmn which we publish to-day. According to these views the condition of the native Africans is such that to go to the coast with a d(mand for their services would infallibly generate a system of kidnapping in the interior of the country, and, in fact, as far as Africa is concerned, would revive the Slave Trade, and destroy the more legitimate pursuits which the partial repression of this trade has suffered to sp21nte,up. In considering these arguments we find the compams of the controversy very conveniently narrowed. It is not alleged that the position of the Negro, once landed in Guiana or Jamaica, would be otherwise than good, or that his rights as a free labourer on British territory could not be effectually secured. All that is said is that he could not be procured on the shores of his birth without giving occasion to fearful wrong. As to his freedom, regarded in the abstract, there is hardly room for discussion about it. With few exceptions, the tribes about the coast live in a state of slavery naturally and constantly in to far as concerns subordination to the will of a master. They may not be illused or overworked, but they are at the command and disposal of a lord. At present they aro engaged in the manufacture and exportation of palm oil and other such products, but if a demand were made for them their kings, or masters, would instantly sell them, and then resort to war to procure others, who would be sold in the same way. The necessary consequence of such a system would bo the revival of the Slave Trade atrocities in the first stage. The horrors of the middle passage would of course have no existence, nor would the Negro have anything to fear when he was landed at his destination ; but the effect on Africa itself would be deplorable. Negroes, in short, there are natural slaves, born so, and kept so. If no slave market is opened, their masters are content with reasonable service; but if they can make a better thing of it by selling then, outriglt they will infallibly do'so, and steal others to keep np the supply. Such, as ve understand it, is the case of those who, like our correspon ii.t. alet .' c arse from the proposed system of supplying our Colonies with free labour from Africa. 'Upon this reasoning we can only observe that, whereas the anticipated advantages are, as we have shown, enormously great, the apprehended evils are certainly somewhat circumscribed. As regards the Negro himself, it is hardly possible to deny that umder proper supervision he would be far better off in a British Colony than he is at home under the rule of a master, who, as our correspondent admits, could and would, if thwarted or offended, whip him or starve him into submission, or even murder him outright. Such conditions of service would certainly be well exchanged for those under which the Coolies of the Mauritius realize freedom and independence. All that is dreaded is that these petty kings, if once they get an opportunity of shipping their subjects in any capacity whatsoever, will take to this trade so kindly as to forsake other occupations for that of man-stealing. We will not here inquire whether such propensities could be encountered by any checks, but will accept the argument on its own grounds. Granted that a demand for Negroes will generate intestine wars in Africa, does no such demand exist now ? Whence come the thousands of slaves yearly landed in Cuba, and the thousands who die on the passage ? And what is the effect of such an exportation ? Clearly, this intestine war must be prevailing as it is, and not only this, but all the other horrors of the Slave Trade too. This war, in short, is but part and parcel of the very Slave Trade which free labour would put down, and the question is not whether we should or should not rni the risk of creating a demand for Negroes on the coast ! of Africa, but whether, as we have never yet been I able to extinguish such a demand, we should not; attempt to take it in hand ourselves, with a cer- I tainty of suppressing all its abominations in every stage of the proceedings but one, and with at least a chance of mitigating them in that stage also.
The course of events has comprised of late so much to absorb as well as stimulate the interest of the public that a silent and peaceable revolution, though affecting the very foundations of our educational system, is likely enough to have escaped the attention it deserves. Gradually, however, and by judicious steps, an important change has been proceeding. It was at the commencement of the Russian War that the first measure of academical reform was introduced with especial reference to the University of Oxford, and it will doubtless be in the reader's recollection that a Commission was established by the Bil to carry out at leisure and with all proper calution the details of those improvements which the Bill itself did but delineate. The result of this provision we now discern in a Supplement to the London. Gazettk containing nearly 60 pages of new statutes proposed to be enacted for the several Colleges in the University. The chief principles at issue in these proceedings, and the advantages to be realized by the public at large, can be explained in a very few words. In this particular branch of University improvement the proposals of the reformers were directed to the removal of those impediments which obstructed the general access to our IUniversity endowments. These endowments constituted the possessions of the several Colleges, and were administered and distributed according to the prescriptions of their respective founders, devised centuries ago. At the establishment of theso foundations the University itself was a great institution, thronged with students, and rich in influence and reputatiOn. The general intention of the founder of a College, especially in the earlier instances, was to provide some agency by means of which the youth of his own county or diocens, or the inheritors of his own lineage, or the inhabitants of any district to which he was especially attached, might enjoy for ever, at his costs and charges, the benefits of a University education, which might otherwise be beyond their reach. For this purpose he founded some house under the title of a College or Hall, endowed it with property, and dictated the conditions on which admission to its advantages should take place. The very essence of the proceeding consisted in the subordination of these establishments to the University itself. They represented simply so many avenues benevolently provided through which certain persons in whom the testator was interested might find their way in perpetuity to the instruction and opportunities which the University afforded. In the course of ages, however, an entire change came over these relations, and over the whole academical system. The University, the original seminary of learning and aggregate of teachers, lost, to a great extent, its abstract influence and attributes, which were absorbed by the Colleges. These foundations, as they increased in number and as their endowments rose in value with the rise of the nation, increased also in popularity and power, until, instead of merely providing shelter and sustenance for the favoured or the necessitous few, they included among their inmates all students of the University whatever. Instead of being so many establishments within the University, they formed altogether the very material out of which the University seemed constituted, and the institution, which at first had been a corporation of Doctors and Scholars standing by its own weight, and which was still so in theory, became in practice an aggregate of collegiate foundations, each of which was administered as a separate house, according to the device of its particular founder. The reader will now be able to appreciate the changes which are proposed, and the objections which, on behalf of the expiring system, were made by Lord DmRBY in the House of Lords on Tuesday last. It is intended to remodel the statutes of the Colleges, and to substitute for the original directions of the founders provisions more in accordanoe with the requirements of the University and the interests of the nation. In most instances, as would naturally be the case under the circumstances we have sketched, the designs of a founder were limited in their scope. He wished to benefit his own flock, family, or province, leaving it to others to do the same by theirs. Inasmuch, too, as what he wished to give the recipients of his bounty was simply the means of study, he often stipulated that they should prove their need of this assistance as their title to receive it,-in other words, that poverty should be one of the chief conditionsof election tothe places which, under the name of Scholarships or Fellowships, he had established in his College. It is now proposed to abolish this test of poverty, and with it the preferential qualifications derived from birthplace or parentage, so that, as a matter of fact, Lord Danny was perfectly right in arguing that the expressed desires of the founder in these respects would be set at nought. But the truth is evidently, that the course of events has left no room for the application of the founder's statutes without such a violation of all reason and propriety as he could never have designed. When Colleges were lost in the grand dimensions of a national University it was fitting enough that they should be filled and administered according to the statutes we have described; but when they came to represent the University itself, aud when those who enjoyed their endowments became ipso facto the teachers and governors of a mighty body, it was plainly absurd to confer functions of such importance and dignity upon persons swhose title rested on the accident of birthplace or the misfortune of poverty. It was undoubtedly the design of the founder inE mt cases that the Fellows of his College should be poor; but then it never entered into his designj his intention, or his contemplation that the"e poor Scholars or Fellows should be invested with the authority of exclusive governors in ono of the great Universities of the land. Nothing sould be more extraordinary than the anomalies which became thus producible. 'Up to the present time, as a boy might get a College Scholarship by hic birthplace or his name, as he might acquire a Fellowship on the strength of the same qualifications, and from aFellowship succeed to the headship of his Society, it was perfectly possible that a mmn might be maintained in affluence half his life, and be promoted at last to the actual government of Oxford, on no other grounds than his being connected with a certain family, or having first seen the light in a particular parish. It is superfluous to add that we concur entirelyin the decisions by which this system is proposed to be terminated. That the designs of thefounders, strictly speaking, are overruled, and even directly contravened, is true, but only because their foundations have attained to a position of eminence and power of which they never dreamt, apid which renders the conditions they attached to their endowments inconsistent with the more: elevated functions attaching to them now. The system of poor Fellows may have its advantages, but on this system a Fellowship must not carry with it any preferential title to University place. Poverty may have claims to consideration, but it can never be admitted to confer power. The advantages accruing to the publiec cannot be more conspicuously illustrated than in the example of New College ; which, from one of the closest, will be rendered by the projected changes one of the most open foundations in Oxford. Hitherto, Scholars from Winchester School exclusively had access to the endowments of this institution; they alone became Scholaag of New College, and Scholars of New College alone became Fellows. In future, according to the proposed scheme, the Fellowships and the Scholarships wiU be separated, and of the former appointments one-half may be competed for by any member of the College of a certain standing, or by any person educated during two -years at Winchester, while the other half will be thrown entirely open to the University at large. At, the same time the design of the founder to secure his Winchester Scholars the benefits of a tUniversity education receives due attention in a'provision making the emoluments of the College Ssholarubips considerable, and confining these to ^the boys educated at Winchester School, though not simply to those on the foundacion. These arangements contain a very good distinction between that kind of endowment which should facilitate education and that which should convey academical power. The College, as regards its Scholarships, will still maintain WILLIAm of Wyxmfs Scholars; but, as regards its Fellowships, it will be practically open to any man who can establish his title to admission.

The Royal Conmussioners appointed to inquire and examine into the constitution of the Supdrior Courts of LaW at Westminster, and into the existing arrangements of the Circuit Courts, have agreed to thoir roport, which will be printed and ready to be submitted to Parliament before the cloee of the session. It is understood that tho Commissioners will express thelr opinion, founded upon the evidence before them and their own experience, that no dininution of the number of judges can take place. Indeed, at this very timas the several courta can scarcely make up a ful court or get through the Nisi Prius sittings in time for the cirouits. Several changes ia the times and manner of holding the assizes will be recommended, as well ss the division of the larger counties, and a more eg,ual distribuidon of the circuits, wsith other matters of detall of a practicalnture, so as to insure a more speedy and uniform administration of justice, both civil and criminaL-Obse7rs. Thomas Mausell, whose case has engaged so much of theattention of the Courts, is leik for executlon, and will undergo the Ilat peDnaty of the law at Maidstone to-morrow (Monday). His cduie was that of a most deliberatemurder, laving shot a sergeaut of his regiment, on account of a personal quarrel, in a cool and determined manner, in the open day. The objections to his conviction were entirely of a technical character, unconnec'ted with the merits of the case, and were overruled by all the Superior Courts to which they were referred and before vhich they sreelAbratelyargued. No palLiatiug circumlstances have since come to light, and there were no grounds, therefore, to authorizc the Secretary of State to advise any departure from the due couree of law. -Obsei-rcr
SECOND EDITU PN. THB TIAfMS-OPPICE, Motdaz Mofnbntg. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correIpondent, dated yesterday (Sunday), 6 p.m.:- The second and final elections in the 3d, 4th, and 7th districts of Paris commenced this morning, and will close to-morrow evening. I have paid a visit to those districts, and, so far as I could perceive, the movement was, in some sections, more animated than is usual on a first day's voting; in others it was of the calmest description. The: eat that pre. vails, notwithstanding the air that does its best to temper the sun's rays, might well produce the same effeot on Parisian patriotism as the near prospect of his renconlre on the spirit of Bob Acres. Whereever indifference appears, it is, perhaps, merely ou the surface, and some think that the contest will to-morrow be more animated and determined. It i3 certain that on both sides-the Government and the Opposition-the greatest efforts aro made for victory. I do not pretend to anticipate the result, but it is evident that the Opposition party is full of confidence; and the friends of the Government hardly conceal their misgivings. The Government spares tiothing, omitsnothing,tosecurea.triumph; preparatorymeetings, circulars left at the houses of the electors -every species of machinery is put in play. To all this no objection can be made. There are other manceuvres, however, of a less innocent character. For instance, it is affirmed that the manager of a certain paper whose existence is only of recent date has been informed by the proper authority that the Government had qutite enough on its hands with the three democratic journals, the Silece, the Presse, and the Elstafette ; that he, the said editor, had not re ceived permission to establish his paper for the pur pose of joining that chorus; and that if he did not cool down to more moderation he must not be astonished if he received avertissements sufficient to lead to justify suspension. I also hear that the Assemblee Nationale has been admonished to drop its discussion on the electoral check sustained by M. de Montalembert; and it -was hinted that, though the Government had left more latitude to the press during the elections, yet it was time to return to its habitual reserve, and mot expose itself to inconvenience. The CIonstititionnel will, of course, call this the " plenitude of independence." Under these circumstances, the Opposition is forced to have recourse to oral propagandism in favour of its candidates, while the supporters of the Government candidates hold their meetings unrestrained. Three days ago one of the privileged 9-junions was held in one of the contested districts; notwithstanding the "whipping in," but 40 free and independent electors attended. It was resolved to make up for want of numbers by increased energy, and each of the persons present was charged with beating up recruits and visiting in person the houses of the indifferent and the lukewarm, in order to Limpress on themnJthat to vote for the Opposition candidates on this occasion would be to vote for anarchy. Certain members of the Municipal Council are engaged in3the same irksome task, but, it is to be feared, have been rather cldily re- I ceived. The answer given to some of the more zealous agents in the 4th and 7th districts was something to this effect :-" MM. Ollivier and Darimon cannot, under any circumstances, be our candidates; neither can we vote for those of tho Government, who donotrepresentouropinions ;consequentlyabstention is necessarily imposed on us." From all this it seems likely that a good many will still keep away, and, if the Government is doomed to witgess Socialist nominations, the fault is its own. It was known beforehand that it would oppose every candidate that came into competition with its own, however moderate the competitor might be (as in the case of M. Montalembert), therefore men of independence have declined entering the electoral arena. I mayadd -that a collection of documents is being prepared with the view of showing what little liberty has been left to the electors, particularly in the departments, in comparison with which Paris has enjoyed a special privilege. These documents, forming, a fairsized volume, will be published in Belgium, with the title, Tltc Ellections in France Unmasked. The twin organs of the Government are still indignant at the bare surmise that undue influence has been exercised in the elections. This redundancy of anger, and the frequency with which the purity of prefects and mayor.3 is defended, excites a suspicion that these functionaries really stand in need of defence, and, indeed, that they have a con. sciousness of their own frailty. These organs dwell with uncommon energy and unction on the perfect impartiality of the authorities, and they defy their adversaries to point out a single instance of intimidation or unfairness, well aware as they are of the consequences to any unfortunate journal that dared to take up the chalenge. A provincial paper noticed the other day the curious coincidence of a prefect of one of the most important departments being removed from his post immediately on the success of the Opposition candidate in the large city which is the chef-lieus of the department, and for doing so it has been visited with the anger of the Minister of,the Interior in the shape of a "warning." The Govern. anent press clamours for proofs of the unfair conduct of the authorities in these matters, and, as I am anxious to gratify it, I take the liberty of mentionSng the following incidents, which no doubt the Canstitutionnel and Pays will be but too happy to deny or explain. I repeat the facts as they have been stated to me, on what I consider fair authority. Among the professions of faith published on the oecasion of the last elections, I find the following addressed to certain electors in the department of the Eure-et-Loir :- *'TO T m ELZCTons OF TuE ARRONDISSMMNxTS or DREUX, NOGE.LT-I2-RoT'ROu, DE BB3ON, AN-D ILLrER. " Gentlemen,-The existing Constitution has been conaidered by the Government that promulgated it as susceptible of modification, and the sovereignty of the nation forms the basis of that Constitution. " Theovote which you are about to give will have an important mewaing. If you return Io the Llegislative Corps the ame deputies as before, it shows that you are satisfied with the present state of things. If, on the contrary, you vote for independent candidates, yoe declare that it seems to 'ou the hour is come when, in virtue of the promise made to the nation, I Liberty is to crown the edifice.' J present mnsedf, Gentlemen, for your suffhages. I am one of those who believe that tho hour is come, and that oontrol In the management of public affairs ought to be in the hands of independent men. "H. BOSSELET.' There is nothing, very subversive in this address; there is no appeal to revolttionary measures, and no excitement offered to the angry passions of the maultitude, and the text is taken from the words of the Emperor himself. His Majesty has certainly spoken of an " effigy that is to crown an edifice ;" that edifice was the Imperial ri9ime, and by the effigy was meant liberty. The edifice has certainly existed for some time; it has existed for five years; but the only " crowning glory" that, so far as we are aware of, hax as yet appeared, is the re-ap- pointment of M. de Morny in yesterday's M oni. teur as Presildent of the new Legislative Corps. 3he address of M. Bosselet was, you will admit, a fair respo,ae to th cir cuIat of the Government inviting candidates to present them- Belves, and the electors to exerciye their independent znd unbiassed judgment in the great national act they were called upon to perform. This harmleEs address was, however, as I am assured, followed by such eccentricities as these :-At Nogent-le-Rotrou the Procureur Imperial summoned to his presence the person who was entrusted with the distribution of the voting tickets and the cicculars in the arrondissement, and hinted somerbing about imprisonment if he persevered. At Chateauneuf, a canton of the arrrondissement of Dreux, the Commissary of Police is said to have seized 80 voting tickets, to have caused the placards with the above address to be torn down, and the Mayor was informed, when remonstrating on the illegality of such conduct, that positive orders had been received to oppose the election of L. Bosselet. At Bron, a canton of the arrondissement of Chateaudon, the commissary of police is said to have taken away the circulars from the wine-shops, and to have threatened the landlords with shutting up their eatablishnicnts, if the voting tickets of the Opposition candidates were found there. At Nogent-le-Roi, a canton of the arrondissement of Dreux, the Opposition candidate's placards were torn down on the evening of the 16th. The Prefect of the Eure-et-Loir (and so, may his promotion be speedy) is said to have described MM:. Eosselet and Barth6lemy, the Opposition candidates, as " men of disorder," whereas, in the address just given, the former merely demanded the fulfiment of the promise made by the Emperor in 1852 that " one day Liberty should crown the edifice." The votes for the Government candidate were 15,389; the votes for the Opposition were 10,423. The Constitutionel and Pays will, no doubt, be highly pleased at the opportunity of denying the precedingfacts if incorrectly reported, and of once more proclaiming the perfect impartiality of the Govermnent agents. The Union Franc-Courtoise, a Besan9on paper published the othert day an article headed "The Means employed at the late Elections against the Canvass of M. de Montalembert." As I have seen no contradiction to the facts mentioned, I presume they are, in the main, correct. It says:- " One of our friends spoke to a hesitating elector about M. Montalembert, as a person worthy of being elected, and he dwelt on the charaoeer, the merits, and thfn talents of the candidate. 'But,' replied this enlightened elector, IM. de Montalembert cannot be a deputy. He is an eamigrant, he has been ejected from the Senate for having refused to dec clare war against the Russians. Besides,' he added, with a knowing air, 'every one knows that M de Montalembert used to send our soldiers cartridges filled with bran and saw. dust, while he sent powder and bali to the Russians to combat the French.' To such allegations there was no answer, and the worthly elector in question appeared so convinced of the truth of what he said that all reasoning was lost on him. On another point, also, it appears that M. de Montalembert was the enemy of the people. In the first place, he was opposed to the people sending their children to school when they were over 10 or 12 years old. It was not right that the people should be too enlightened, or that they should havc too much science, as they might end by taking the govern. ment of society in hand. Again, M. de Montalembert was against the working olasses earning excessIve wages, lest the people should become too rich, and maight sorme day free themselves from the yoke and overthrow the barrier by which thoy were now held in." Such, it would appear, are the means employed against candidates like M. de Montalemabert. So long as these things are not explained it is useless for the Constitutionnel to boast of the discomfiture of General Cavaignac in the Lot, the Mamne, the Meurthe, the Morbihan, the Seine (this is premature), and Vlaucluse; of M. Carnot's defeat in the Ardache, the Bouchcs-du-Rh6ne, the Cher, the COte d'Or, and the Nord; of M. Garnier-Pagbs' disappointment in the Ardennes, the Orne, and the Seine; and M. Raspai's failure in the Surthe. The rejection of such a man as M. de Montalembert is perhaps the clearest proof of the intolerance of the Imperial Government, as of the servility of its agents. It is particularly disgraceful, because it is aggravated by ingratitude. When the President of the French Republic madle his coupd'ct 1M. de Montalembert carme f6rward nt a very critical moment and defendedit in the columns of the Univers; and again, when so many men of note drew back, M. do Montalembert accepted, in the very infancy of the now Government, andwhen it most wanted help, the difficult functions of a consultive councillor. However opinions~ may differ as to that stop, the Emperor should be the last man to forget it. M. de Montalembert, moreover, took the oath of fidelity to Imperial Government and Constitution at the opening of the Legislative Chambers in 3852. He may not have joined in the cry of Vive l'Empereur which resounded that day in the Salle du TrOne, but he held forth his han4 when the oath was read, and pledged his fealty to the new Government. The acquisition of such a name was worth a wilderness of Verons and Baroches. He gave up all connexion with the Government in the confiscation of the Orleans property, which he has never lost an opportunity of denouncing as it deserved; but M. de Montalembert has not been a systematic opponent of the Government; his frank, courageous nature placed him above the suspicion of intrigue, while his talents, " cabined, cribbed, confined" as they were, imparted to the Legislative Corps the light that so opaque a body, once presided over by M. BiUault, and where M. de Morny has now established his niche, is capable of receiving. 1 de Montalembert's rejection by the electors, or more proper]y, the Prefect and Sub-Prefects of the Doubs, proves that talent of a high erder, patriotism, independence, matured judgment, great experience in public affairs, personal worth, and social station, are qualities which appear to be little estimated in the legislative system. Until such time as the " edifice" already described is crowned by the promised effigy, the meaner the materials at hand the more acceptable they are. M. de Montalembert will, I doubt not, easily console himself for his defeat by the Prefect of the Doubs. M. Darimon has published in the Presse the following reply to the questions addressed to him by the Constitutiioinel respecting certain passages of his life : " Ifeel no diflonulty in answering the Co07stutionnel. I never was the secretary of Dr. Leonard de Sablonville ; I never was concerned at Lille in editing a Ministerial or any other journal; nover has any journal of the Nord been able to confront one of my articles in the Peup?c with anything written by me In favour of the Government of July; I was not at LiUe in 1848, and I never had any necessity to get myself countenanced by the Government Commisioners, Testelin and AnthonyThouret. I never vras Incriminated inthe trial of June 13, I never was eustor of any journal at Ghent, and I never swas connected With journals bearing the name of Fratenity or The La tourer. Some person has been hoaxing you, Sir; and that surprses me the more, because M. Canvain, ono of your most assiduous editors, is an old schoolfellow of mine, knowing me these 20 years, and from whom you could have leant all abont me." The Minister of War has received the following despatch from Marshal Randon, Governor-General of Algeria:- "BIVOUAC OF SIDI-EL.HASSEN, AMONG THE BENI.YENBNI, 26Tu Jusx, 1857. "Monsieur le Harechal,-Yesterday, 25th June, the divisions Renault and Yusuf took possession of the villages of the BeniYennmi This operation cost only 30 men wounded. Time fails me to communicate the details of this affair. The first mall shall bring my report. I received this morning the despatch of General MacMahon on the oocupation of the village of IcheHiden. I hasten to address it to you. The battle of the 24th of June, at Iche. riden is by the resistance-the number of the enemy and the vigour of the attack, one of our brilliant deeds of arms. That brilliant success facilitited our movement among the Bent.Yenni at the same time that MacMahon's divlsion completely covers Souck-el-Arba, and secuezs our communi. cations." A second despatch, addressed by Marshal Ealdon to the Minister of War, to dated Benl-Yenn!, t'he 29th of June. It announces that prevoios to commencing operations againSt the Eabyle4 he had coora manded General Maissat to concentrate his dispoFable force so as to be ab'e to enter into line if called on. On the 28th the Marshal adds "Yesterday I perceived the fires of his camp on the plain in the mnuntains of CheUata, and I have just learnt from General Maihsat that he had ocoupied Chellata after a trifing resistance, and that he could dispose of 5,000 bayonets. Colonel d'Argent's column of observation is like wise in the Oaed Sabel ready to support the movements of the columnn of Constantine. The occupation of Chellata completes the investment of the rocky part of the Diuriura, and will permit me to strike more certain blows on the population which would endeavour to withdraw from our domination." Besides the treaty of commerce and the sketch of a literary convention, M. de Moray is said to have brought with him from Russia two young bears! I think it right to contradict, sous tout reserve, the rumour that it was contemplated to put up either of these juvenile Brains as a Government candidate for some electoral district in Paris or the departments. They would be rather unruly members in spite of the muzzle which has been so successfully tried for the last five years in the Legislative Chamber, The respectable animals in question are to be deposited in the Jardin des Plantes, where they will enjoy a "1 modified liberty." Count Nesselrode is expected in Paris in the course of the week. A slight improvement in the health of the poet Beranger has taken place. He slept well during the night, and this morning seemed relieved from the oppression which affects him. The hope of his recovery is, however, very faint. A considerable quantity of- wheat in excellent condition was received on Thursday last in the Paris corn-market from Algeria. The province of Algiers has sent soft wheat ; the districts of Blidah and Bona hard wheat; while barley has been received from the Arabs of Tahla, near Constantins. A sack of fne wheat from Languedoc, of the present year's harvest, was likewise exhibited the same day.

The new Russian Customs' tariff has at length been published, and, in addition to its publication in various journals, is to be had printed separate for 80 copecs. Such great expedition was used iu bringing the new tariff in o application that merchants, who had already sent in their declarations previously, found on the 24th even, before it had been published, their amounts of duty charged according to the new scale. The most prominent feature in the tariff is the admission of Iron of almost all kinds at a duty which wMll not quite exclude it, while formerly its admission was prohibited altogether. Cotton goods are all reduced considerably, and in some cases to one-fourth of the former duty; linen, on the other hand, only to about a-half. The following list contains oioie of the principal items, with the rates of-thd forxoet, and present tariff- 1850. 1857. it. . R.xK.

Writing to you as I do, from the capltal of Prussia, I cannot avoid drawing your attention to one or two points which more particularly strlike men's minds here. The various reductions made in the tariff are all, with the exception of that on linen goods, of almost no advantage to Prussia; In cotton goods she cannot compete with England, either in. price or quality; and of iron goods she cannot supply even one-third of her own demand: so that all these three reductions fall to the advantage of England; and, while the wines of every other winegrowing country are favoured by a reductlon, those of Prussia alone are excluded and remain at the former rates. This will speak volumes to those who think Prussia rendered such valuable services to Russia in the late war; either Prussia did not do so, or elseRussia has not permitted her gratitude to get the better of her convictions of political economy. The piece of news that recurs most frequently in the Russian press is the discovery of extensive fields of coal and strata of iron. The last announements of this kind are from the Crimea and the land of the Cossacks of the Don. In Eamysch- Burun, in the neighbourhood of Kerteb, there has been iron ore discovered, which yields 35 per cent. of iron, and is smelted by anthracite coal raised on the banks of the Don. In that district there is said to be an extensive coal field, of about 2,000 square werstes, the richest point of which is found in the neighbourhood of Alexandrowlka (about 80 werstes from Mariupol), where two strata varying from 6 to 7 feet in thickness are found, at a depth of 16 and 20 fathoms from the surface. According to the calculations made on the spot, it is computed that a square wverste there will produce 175,000,000 poods of coals. These productive coal mines (as they are to be some day) are the property of Prince Lieven. The traic between St. Peteraburg and the varioua ports of the Bay of Finland is about to receive great additional accommodation from the accession of four new steamers, two of which are to be put on the line and commence plying in August. At present there are only three in activity-the Victoria, Wiborg, and Prince Menschikoff; the latter vessel has already seen a good many years of service, and it is difficult to get more than eight miles an hour out of her; but one of the new vessels that is now being built in England is to be of 120-horse power, and, according to contract, to perfor knots an hour. Petersburg is just now almost bare of any corps diplomatiqae. Count Esterhazy left long ago, M. de Morny left lately, and since his departure the -Ministers of Wurtemburg, Saxony, and Greece. The Duke of Ossuna is superseded by M. Isturitz. Mr. Seymour, the American Minister, is recalled, and Count Miinrter, the Hanoverian Minister, will shortly leave for the summer. Baron Werther, the Prussian Minister, it is expected, will shortly exchange his present post for Vienna. SPAIN. (FOM OUR OWN co o sroRwxNDi.) MADRID, JULSY L Alarming reports were circulated iu Madrd last evening. Amongst other things it was said that the artillery at Malaga had revolted, and had been subdued by the other troops of the garrison, after a conflict. This is probably an exaggeration, at least nothing has transpired to-day to confirm the intelligence to its full extent. It is publicly known, however, that a conspiracy has been discovered in the corps of ardllery at Malaga, and that a courtmartial has condemned a corporal to death, and two soldiers to severe punishment. There is no doubt that there is considerable fermentation at Malaga, and also, it is said, in the province of Jaen. An incident that occurred in the Sierra li'orena has given rise to much conversation and conjecture. The mail coming from Seville to Madrid was stopped near La Carolina by a party of armed and mounted men, who demanded the official correspondence, but, finding that it was in the same bags with the private letters, they burned the whole. It is said that they inquired whether disturbances had not broken out in Madrid, Barcelona, and Saragossa, and appeared incredulous when they were answered in the negative. They were at first said to be 80 in number, but subsequent accounts seem to prove that an exaggeration, and that they were but 20 or 30. A strong detachment of the Civil Guard has since overtaken them and put them to flight, killing one man. The others took refuge in the recesses of the Sierra Morena. Two companies of light infantry have left Madrid by railway to pursue them ; troops have also left-Ciudad Real in the same direction; arrests have been made in Jaen, and severe proclamations have been issued by the Military Governor of that place. A brigadier of infantry and several other officers left Madrid last night and this morning by special trains for the south. A certain importance is evidently attached by the Government to what has taken place. A military commission is to be formed in the province of Jaen to judge the offenders and the persons believed to be implicated in the plot. Those as yet arrested are said to belong exclusively to the democratic party. I am informed that Sisto Camera, now in Portugal, and some other democrats of the most ultra and despe rate stamp, have sent proclamations into Spain to provoke a rising. There alo are persons who think that the Carlists contemplate a movement, and will act in concert with the democrats. While discontent and conspiracy thus manifest themselves in the provinces, the Government gets on but slowly with its measures in the Cortes, and the deputies leave Madrid so fast that we expect every day to find that there are not aufficient remaining to vote laws, to do which an absolute majority of At-eOChamber, that is to say, one more than half the whole number of deputies must, according to the regulations, be present. This is the usual season of emigr-ation from Madrid, and, moreover, many de. puties are probably glad to ger away in order to avoid voting for or against the authorization of the law concerning the press. It is to be presumed that the Government will maanage to keep together enough deputies to vote that law, but, according to present appearances, even that looks doubtful. Meanwhile the debates are wearisome enough. In the Senate they are still busy with the reform of the Constitution; in the Congress railway projects and disputed elections are discussed. Some of the papers draw mysterious inferences from the recent alleged visit of Prince Lucden Buonaparte to Madrid, where he is said to have remained a week in strict incognito. Last night's Begeneracim concludes an obscure and ominous paragraph on this subject by advising that a sharp look-out should be kept on the proceedings of M. de Turgot and Lord Howden, who alone, it says, had interviews with the Prince. The truth is that the alleged visit is a mere canard, and the philological and very inognito Bonaparte has not been in Madrid at all. This may, at leant, be Inferred from the fact that his Ambassader, M. de Turgot, has not seen or heard anything of him. There was almost a riot iD the bull-ring on Mon day on account of the bad quality of the bulls, which would not come up to be killed in the spirited manner desired and expected of them. A number of the spectators, disgusted at the cowardice and misconduct of the animals, and at the bad faith of the contractors, wished to leave the Plaza by the narrow pasage between the rinz and the audience, but this could not be allowed, as there was a bull then engaged, and the civil guards prevented it. This produced a certain confusion, and an alarm was spread outside the Plaza, and some persons began to run-a corridrs, or panic run-which often takes place in this capital, much versed with revolutions, when any little disturbance occurs. A dozen persons running,with symptoms of terror, will set thousands in motion. The alarm spread to the Prado, then -full of promenaders, but was soon appeased. Meanwhile, in the Plaza de Toros, a seventh bull wrabrought out,in consideration of the execrable quality of the six others. He did not prove much better than his companions, but he jumped over the barrier and caught an Urbanguard, whom he tossed twice into the air. Another guard was so frightened that he jumped into the Plaza and ran to the middle of it. The bull, driven out of the narrow passage abovementioned, returned into the ring, caught the terrified guard, and tossed him alsotwice. Neither of the two men were serlously hurt. Bullfighting is a State affair here, and the receipts of the day were embargoed by the authorities, that from them mnight be deducted a heavy fine which is to be imposed on the managers of the sport. The Madrilenos are the more disgusted at the badne of the bulls brought before them because they hear flaming accounts of the excellence of the fights in the south of Spain, in two of which 71 horses were kdlled. Bravo, toro ! On Sunday, Marshal Narvaez gave a breakfast at Aianjuei to the King and to several members of the Court and Government. After breakfast the Marshal and His Majesty went to pay their respects to the celebrated Senor Patrocinio, now comfort. ably installed in a convent at Aranjuez. Whilst the King thus displays his piety by visiting his pet saint, the Queen is not forgetful of her favourite virgin. Under the heading " A ]Royal Gift," a newspaper announces that the Dowager Duchess of Alba, Chief Lady of theBedChamber to Queen Isabella of Spain, has delivered to the Countess of Salvatierra, Principal Lady of the Bed Chamber to the Virgin of Atocha, the magnificent silk dress, scarf, ribands, wreath of flowers and acorns, bouquet of jewels and brilliant-headed pins, worn by Eer Majesty when. she went on Saturday last to pay her devotions to her favourite image, by which she par_ ticularly desires that this elegantand costly costume should be worn.

A letter from Genoa, of the 3d inst., informs us that the movementatLeghorn was more serious than was at first believed. On the night of the 30th of June several armed men attacked the principal guard-house of the town,but were repulsed. Another party attacked a second guard-house, but were likewise unsuccessfuL At the same time several isolated carabiniers were stabbed. The disturbance, recommenced on the following morning, and continued during the day. When the steam-packet Giorgio sailed at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 1st of July the firing of musketry was still heard. The gates were closed, the inhabitants were in consternation, and the shops were shut. The insurgents who were taken prisoners were instantly shot in the streets. A detachment of troops of the line, who were stationed on the square having received some shots from the windows of a house, took possession of the house, in which they found tenindividuals, threeof whomwerebayonetted, and the other seven shot. An artillery officer, who was attacked in the streets, having captured one of his assailants, handed him over to the soldibrs, and he was shot on the spot. The numer of insurgents arrested at Genoa is 50. There were likewise 3,000 muskets seized. When the steamboat Cagliari was captured by two Neapolitan frigates in the Gulf of Naples, the captan, Sitzia, and his crew were found tied with ropes, and shut up in the hold. It was evident they had yielded only when violence had been employed. The Cagliari had been brought to the island of Ponza, where the political prlisoners were set at liberty and landed at Sapri, in the Gulf of Salerno. A despatch received at Genoa announces that this band were already pursued by the Neapolitan troops. It is fulrther said that the Sardinian and Neapolitan Governments had been apprised a month since by the French police that such a movement was in contemplation by the Mazzinians. BELGIUM. The elections for the new Chambers are proceed. ing more favourablyfor the Liberal party than could have been expected when we remember the majority which the Clerical party maintained in the Parliament which has been recently dissolved. At the election for Tournai the Liberal candidate, I. Charles Sacqueler, was elected in place of M. Pollet, deceased. M. Pollet belonged to the Clerical party. It seemed natural, therefore, that a man professing the same principles should have been put forward, but, whether from the fear of defeat or otherwise, the Liberal candidate was allowed to be returned without opposition. It is stated that M. Nothomb, the Minister of Justice, and originator of the Chamber Bill, has not the shadow of a chance for St. Nicolas, and that it is probable he will withdraw from the contest.

I ZLYEUCB HERATRE, nho appearanco of Madam Riatori as Lady 3facbeth bw snaturally excited much curiosity be7ond those circles whichL ordilarijy take interest in her impersonatiou. -Here is a characterfamiartoEnglish readers and playgoers of every an ncitd with the noblet traditions of thta The adaptation of the play by Signor Giulio Carcano, jodgmsent n assisted by Euglish advisers of no ordinary jugen s very ably executed. Its chief objectis to render the lady the prominent cbaracter with the least possible alteration of the origirnal text, and without detrispent to the intelligibility of the aitory. Thus, while the scene of thle cauldron is omitted, and the fighting in the lasbt a is reduced to a minimumz, the witches are alowed td appear it the first scene, where they are exhibitedas I ropheteuo the ensuing action. The character of Lady Imatah herself is completely unaltered. Indeed, in the second act Shakspeare is mnore closely followed than by the ordinary conventions of our own stage. When the murder of Duncan has been discovered by Macduff Lady Macbeth re-enters with feigned carsosity, and en hearig what has happened is borne fainting from the acsne. This incident, which occura ia S)hakspear4 was introduced at Sadler's Wells when Miss Glyn played Lady Macbeth, and bas been restored by Miss ielen Paucit at the 'proaincid teaetres. But Mr. Johbs Kemble omitted it inrhis actin edition of the play, and in this omission he has been followed by the generality of London maanagers. The appearanCe of Madame R3stoni, with her tall -,are her commanding features, and her dignified carriage, is, of course, perfect. She treads the stage as if ahe is borntcs govern, but nevertheless iaher rule of MIacbeth she displays mnoze fondness than is commonly represented on the Eng stage-she lures maore than she urges. The celebrated pa sage-* *' I have giren tuck; andknow " Eow teader ' ,so X ove tbe babeo that mnilks me:" I would, whieit wa, smitin my face " Have pluckld my nIprle from his boneless gum, And daahed the brain cot, had Ia swanm, as ;o04 "Rave doce to this." is illustrated by her action on the same principlo as the ".leopard simiile " in Alledea. She goes through the de scribed intuation as if she were actually involved in it; that is to say, she does hold the imagnary Inant to her bosom, she does, pluck it away, she does dashi it to the giound with. all accuracy, suiting the gesticulation to .the coitrse. of the words. This is one of the great " pointeW of ber delineation. The scene of the murder is quietly rendered, witi a, thorough sense of the gra-vitv of the position, h'er prormptings being rather firm tlian impulsive. In thie restored situation, when she listens with affected horror to the rel. tion of the murder, she contrasts her real anxiety for her husband with pretended horror at the deed, till she is carried apparently senseless from the stage. Throughout the whole of the banquet scene she is still the person of unshaken mind, who would quietly prevent Maiabeth froi committing himself in the presence of his guestsi The sup. position that Lady Macbeth would herself be mrifLed at the horrors of this scene and its possible consequences does not belong to her conception of the character, and hence we have not that storm of perturbedemotionsth at so-oftenv variety to the situation. Her general notion of Lady Macbeth is of a superior intelligence that can rule without great exertion of energy, and is never at any risk of forfeitn self.control. The sleep-walking scene is a grand pictoa exhibition of the kind in which Madame Ristori is without a rivaL The pallid face, the sightless eyes, the mechanical gestures produce an admirable effect, making the audience feel in a ghost-like presence. All the details of this fine scene are wrought to a high degree of perfection, and we have a right to suspect that this one situAtion induced Madame Ristori to undertake the character. Her retirement from the stageas she fancies she isiarginc forward Macbeth with both her hands from theplaoeof crime iS very remarkable, and she gains a great advantage by her non -observance of an old law of the English sta, according to which Lady Macbeth must take up. her candl after sitting down and retire by the centre door through which she entered. Entering at the centre door, retiring at the wing, and not resuming her candle, Madme Ristori obtains a variety of position and a freedom of movement that she turns to the best account. Her acting of this scene is her great triumph with the audience. Shakspeare sounds oddly in Italian, and the stalwart warriors of the North are not corporeaUy represented by the slight formas Df the South. Nevertheless the play, as a whole, is very creditably performed. Signor Vtliani bekd no more like Macbeth than Hamlet, in his own estimation, looked like Hercules; but he plays with a great deal of natural feeing, and his delivery of the dagger scene shows careful study and a commendable inquiry into traditions. The siage-management of the piece is worthy of all praise when we consider that a most complicated actien is undertaLen by complete novices, and a "run" of a few nights oniy can be anticipated in the coum of a " star" engagement.
2'HE COAST OF AFRICA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Having been intimately and largely connected with the trade of the west coast of Africa for nearly half a century, I may perhaps be entitled frorm the accident of my position to speak with some little authority, not only on the commerce of that country, but also on the moral and social condition of its people in relation to the question of slavery and the slave trade. With the gradual repression of the slave trade, I have witnessed, and perhaps I may be allowed to say without vanity have had rome share in promoting, the extension of legitimate trade on the coast of Africa, as a substitute for the slave trade. On my first connexion with the coast, soon after the abolition of the slave trade, the imniortation of produce from the coast of Africa was almost nothing. For one ton of palm oil then imported I should be within the mark if I said 200 tons are now landed in this country. At that time I was not aware, nor was anybody else in this country, I believe, that such a prodnct as ground nuts existed in Africa Now at lemat from 50,000 to 60,000- tons a-year are exported to France, America, and this country from the coast. The export of these two articles only to Europe and America represents the annual value of at least three millions sterling. So much for merely two articles of African produce brought into commercial existence by the abolition of the sLave trade. But with this evidence and prospect of civilization and commercial progress on the coast of Africa before us us what do we hear? We are told that the French Govern ment, hitherto an active ally in the suppression of the slave trade, has adopted a scheme for exporting 10,000 negroe from the coast to their colonies Lin the West Indies; andwhat is still more astonishing-that there is a party in this countryurging our Government to follow the example of France, and supply our West India colonies with labour in the like manner. Well,if thepolicyof France and Eng1andig tobo reversed on this momentous question,let it,at all events be done honestly, and not under the cloak of false pretences. Wearetold that the negroesaretobeshippedandtransport as emigrants. I deny that it is possible fairly and honestly to ship a thousand men from the coast of Africa as free emigrants under any temptation whatever. Even the Kroomen, the only class on the whole coast, and that X very small one, residing on a particular part of it, and none of them at Wbydah, where the Fench propose to taL-e their supply, who re accustomed to leave home voluntarily, would refuse to go to the West Indies, except on condi. tion of being brought back In a few months. Im short, I assert positively, and I challenge any man acquainted with the condition of the people to contradict me, that not a single man can be ob. tained at Whydah without being bargained forandpaid for. Indeed, except in thetowns and villages of the Euro. pean settlements, there is not a free negro on the west coast of Africa. There is not a man dependent on his own. labour for his support at liberty to go to the West Indies of bis own free will if even he were so inclined, and I doubt whether there is one man so inclined on the whole coast. It wll be said that officers may be appointed to see that they are not shipped against their will. This protction may seem plausible to persons ignorant of the condition of the negro, But let us suppose that the poor ignorant creature were to refuse to embarL, what would happen? He would be turned back on tho hands of his master or the slave dealor, and either murdered as an example or starved or wlhipped till he consented to embark. Wbat a mockery is it, then, to talk of free emigration from the coast of Africa! The fact is, the proposed system is the old slave trado in a new form. To talk of a contract with men in their condition is absurd; they do not know what they are bargaining for even if the truth were told them. How the negroes are to be obtained by France is clear enough from the locality selected for the operation. Whydah and its neighbourhood were till lately the focus of the contraband slve trade; and it is only within the last five or sixyear that a large trade in palxm oil has taken root at Whydah and LAgos, whLich this slave trade scheme of the French will entirely destroy. It may be said the negro is a slave at home;that they are In a state of personal dependence I adm, but, that they are slaves in the sugar-plantation sense ofthat ternuI deny. Some 20 years ago the Datch established what they calleda fe military recruiting system at Elmina, onthe Gold Coast, for their army in Java; butit was soonfoundthat itcouldnot be carried on without producing all the evils of the slave trade, and on the remonstrance of our Government it was given up. There Is a paper on this Dutch experiment either In the Colonial-offlce or the Foreign-office, by the late Presdent Maclean, which I would advise Lord Palmerston to consult. Ho will find in it, if my memory serves me correctly, most concluslve arguments to prove that no scheme of negro emigration can be carried out on any other principle than bargain and sale, nor without involving in its con. sequences all the evils and inhumanity of the slave trade a& far as the coast of Africa is concerned; and no higher authority can be referred to on the subject than Mr; Malean. I repeat, then,that if the system we have been pursiDng at such an enormous cost for half a century isto be abandoned, let it be done honestly, openly, nd deliberately,-not by X side-wind. I confine my observations on the subjeet to the effects of the proposed system on the coast of Africa. Of its relations to those colonies and countries which we have bee ruining and worrying on the subject for the last 50 yeass I leavo others to speak. I am, Sir, yours, &c.. AN'w Aily JnamDom.

ELECTION COMMITTEES. MAYO (COUNTY). At the sttting of the Committeo at 11 o'clock on Saturdily, 1Mr. M. SBuEr opened the case on behalf of the sitting Inember. Thele rned counsel said he did not atall under:rate the importance of this inquiry, although he thought a romewlhat undue degree of importance had been attached to it in consequence of the exaggerations made by his learned friend, Mr. James, in his *pening statement. The charge made by his learned friend, of an organized conspiracy on she part of the archbishop and the Roman Catholic clergy of the diocess of Tuam to procure the return of Mr. Moore liai, he submitted, not only been unsupported, but had been completely disproved even by the evidenceadduced in support of the petition. No doubt things had occurred during the election which every one must regret, but it must not be lorgotten that this was an election which had taken place in Ireland, and it was no more fair to judge of an Irish election by the standard of an English election than it was to judge of an Irish fair by an English fair. In almost all contested elections in Ireland the military had to be called in and voters had to be escorted to the poll The presence of the military on those occasions was passed over almost Fithout observation in Ireland, whereas in England it -would be regarded as an extraordinary event. The committee were asked to set aside this election on the ground of riot and intinmidation, and the question they would have to consider was whether or not the sense of the constituency had been obtained by the return of Mr. Moore. A return could not be set aside merely because an election had not been conducted with order and propriety,-they must be satisfied that some illegal acts had been done in order to procure the return. Combination alone would not jbe a ground to set aside a return; it must be a conibination to effect a return by improper and unlawful means. There might be a combination to support or oppose particular can. didates, and it would be wrong to refer isolated cases of violence committed by persons belonging to that combination to the combination itself. Combinations were fre. quently entered into to support particular measures. When tbe Anti-Corn Law League was formed it issaed invitations to voters at meetings, and through the press, not to support any candidate wbo was in favour of the corn laws, but that vas not an illegal combination. If any of the persons who agreed in the resolutions of the Anti-Corn Law League had ibecome implicated in acts which could not be justified, nurtly those acts ought not to be referred to the lawful combination of which they were members. When Cardinal Wiseman was sent to this country as an archbishop a strong feeling was aroused throughout the country, and " com. ibinations" were formed in opposition to Roman Catholic views. Again, there was a baUot society, which called upon voters to oblige candidates at elections to make certatn pledges; if soine members of that society were guilty of i3legal acts, was the whole society to be held responsible for themn H His learned friend had told them that the Roman Catholiobisbops passed a resolution previoustothelast Mayo election to support Alr. dloore as a faithful representative. It could not be contended that the passing of that resolution was an unlawful act. Was there a -word in that resolution which was calculated to give rise to any act of intimidation or violence ? The bishops, like any other citizens, had a perfect right to express their opinions with regard to the cardidates who camae forward to represent the county. As to Archbishop M'Elale, what evidence was there to fix upon hinm the charge of having been a member of a conspiracy to return 31r. Mloore by means of violence and intimidation ? Mr. Moore was a gentleman who possessed an estate of 3,0C01. or 4,0001. a-year in Mayo, and who had been retarmed in 1847 and again in 1852 as the popular candidate. His mnajority at the last election over Colonel Higgins was upwards of 120. Could the committee declare that his return was void on the ground that he did not represent a majority of the constituency'? Colonel Higgins was first elected in 1850, when he was supported bDy the Homan Catholic bishops and clergy, and he was again returned in 1852 with Mr. 7iloorc. He (thse learned counsel) had no desire to say anything on political topics, but he should be obliged to refer to them as circumstances which had influenced the conduct of the electors. Colonel Higgins having been returned with Mr. Moore in 1852, the Archbishop and the popular iarty i Mayo were of opinion, rightly or wrongly, that he mad not acted up to his promises, and was not, therefore, worthy of their support. There could, then, be little doubt lthat if the Roman Catholic voters had been left entirely to themselves, Colonel Higgins at the last election would have lieen *' nowhere." That being the Lstate of affairs Archhishop M'Hale expressed his opinion with regard to the different candidates. There was no evidence that the Arch. Aishop had entered into a conspiracy to procure the return of hr. Moore by unlawful means. All that the Archbishop said in his evidence was that, as a citizen, he had a right to express his opinion aloud, and to pro. amulgate it far and wide in the county, and that the Roman Catholic priests had a right, if voters sought their advice, to give it to them. He thought it was. due to the Archbishop to take some notice of an article 'which had been brought to his attention with a desire that he should notice it, published in Tlhe Tihnes of that morning. No one could fail to value the freedom of the press. Tb6y all loved to live in the atmosphere of freedom, and none of them therefore could complain if the wind sometimes blew in their teeth. He did not impute to the reporter for 9lhe Times any intention to misrepresent what the Arcbbishop had said, but it frequently happened that, in the condensation which usust necessarily take place of reports of proceedings of this kind, a fuil and fair Impression of the evidence as given in question and answer was not conveyed. The evidence eupcosed to havo been given biy the Archbishop was to this eftect-. The CHAIRiMANi asked whether the learned counsel was abcut to read an extract from the leading article or fftom the report. Mr. hi. SMITHI said it was an extract from the report cohtaised in the leading article, and made the foundation of observations. The extract was,- " The censciences of the peasantry should be In the keeping of the rnivl,ters of religion. The 'andlords have no *eght to exercise a canStl I over the consciences of their tenantry. Their consciences 8hduld be left to themselves, to their God, and to the priests. They oaght co be subject only to tho influence of relIgIon." No w he thought that condensation was not borne out by the evidence as giren in question and answer. There was undoubtedly great difflculty in reporting with perfectaconracy the meaning of the answers of a witness to the questions put to hitm, because counsel put their questions in langaage which was often assented to, or partly assented to, by the wituess, and the only way in which the effect of the witimes's answer could be given was to take down words which were, in fact, rather the words of the questioner than of the witness. Hls learned friends in the exercise of their discretion chose, in examining the Archbishop, to adopt the fqrm of cross.examination. lIle had once or twice endeavoured, without mnaking any formal objection, to put a stop to a course which hc thought irregular, but his learned friends chose to continxue that course and to put their questions in a leading form, endeavouring to gain the assent of the wituess to the language they used. The evidence of the Arc'nbishop as it appeared om the printed minutes was as follows:- " By Mir. O'Xalley.-You have spoken largely In sour pastora3 oi which you have read so much, about the rights of cousCtenCe as di,tisie't'hed froni the rig-hts or rent 7-Yea.l Who has the seepl;e of the peasant', cons!ence9-Why, the Thllfliera of religion, as tr us he consults them. ceriai1,y. Thenl, I understaSd o.w by the i Rht of that answer how wo are to Spid thi l astoral. The mueaning of this geas:eral I understand to he, thaKt the landlord is tO, tak the rent and Iears the conscience of the soter to the priest ?-L eaWve it betweenhla Ut and his God. Tae lnrdlordt has no right to the peasant's vote." Then(continued the learned counsel) comes an assumption whih ought not to Iave been made, as it does not follow from the answer- That Is the light, I understand you boldly and openly to say, in wh h 3ou have the risht f influencing the couscience of the voter ?- No but the right of leaviug the conscience of the voter free. -' Ku I to unndertand you to mean by tbe right 'of leaving thee cnec ece of the v,ter free' to leave hit subject to the ILfitunce of the evet siutical m inisters >-lluhJect to theinlluenoce os religion, of course, -very forn, of reiiSion. " Of the ministers of religion ?-They will share in it if the voters 'wi h to corsult them, They viU not coerce any person, nor shoud tIhe2, they have no ri4ht b ut if a persn aiks them, of course it is the free .tof the vottr'd fvill. " I understand 3Io. at all events, to say boldly that the infbuence IoU have used is en iunlueznce which you are prepared to use a; all mes %?-(h, decidedly, becamo I ea not conscIous that we havetransr'rtld the lava of God or of theconEtitttiou. It;ellevewre have not bIeasse I reprehend tha', and I reprehend violence, and I reprehend fra,d. and I reprehend intrigue even." The effect of that evidence, continued the learned count sel, appeared to him different from the condensed statement wblich he had before read, and which contained the language of his learned friend's questions which had not been adopted bv the Archbbishop. But an hon. member of the Committee afterwards put the following question to the Archbishop .- fly the Coszvri-rEr.-Did sour Grace intend to convey the impresen teat you th oth vhconscience of a man indcivil matters ought to lbeho 0' seroelataleeping 7-No. I did not,-not at all,-b, no means. I rather drev: that t fenrens 7-No, not n his keeping, but If he clhooses te consult the clersOysean, and the clergymnan togire Ihlm 'h' udvce,of auve henth reultwold e te reeactofthe person w ho e;nnulte the clergi, mzan." c 0 Fiet thought it right to add that this question and answer vere given in the report, and the gentloman who wrote the re ort probably thought it a sufficient corrective of what he had previously written. With regard to the comments mnade in the leading article he would make no observa-ion inut this,-no one valued more than he did the influence of *be pres, bUt whether or not 't waa " unduo in"fiu-en-c' " t'o' make comments upon the evidence at that period of the inquiry was a question which he would leave entirely to the cootimittee. Colonel NORTse.-The report you have quoted must be a correct report of the impression made upon my mind by tile evidence at the lime it was given, because I afterwards put a question to the witness in consequence of 'that imoresrinn. Of course I do not say that impression has not been altered by what I bave heard since it was made. MIr. AW. SllITvI said the hon. and gallant memnber's remark tozfirmed what he bad before observed. The reporter had fairlv and properlv reported the impression conveyed to his mind as it was to ihe mind of the hon. and gallant member, but the question being put in a leading form the answers vere reported In the words of the questioner, not of the -witnes. Sir J. HM.3IPr. said he had also put a question on the sauie point, not for the purpose of correctig the Arch- bishop's evidence, but merely to ascertain whaW he meant. Mr m. S3irrni said he would now pass from that matter to the subject of the inquiry, and draw the atte4tion of the colnnmittee to some cases bearing upon it. The charges of riot and intimidation involved several distinct questions, the firs being whether there had been sufficeat riot and sufficient intimidation to invalidate the return. The result, of the case w,ith regard to riot was that riot simply as niot and interruption to the proceedings of an elecaiqn did not invalidate a zeturn, but the committee muss be satisfied that the riot was such as to affect the resplt of the election. The learned counsel then referred to Clark - onBlections, 374; to the two Coventryrcases-one in.1827, when great riots took place and serious outrages were committed-the other in 1833, when votershad beeen driien. from thehstiDgs; to the Roxbarghcase, inulM,,when. voter8 badabeen stripped and thrown into the river ; to the Cork caLse, in 1842, and to other cases, in which the sitting inembers had been declared duly electedabecause it was not proved that they would have been In a miinority if the riots hd not occurred. The only modern decision the other way was in the case of the County Clare, where one of the sitting members had a masjority of 2 and the other of 13. and that decision went upon thxe ground that the riots, which were of a frightful description, had affected the result of thepolling. It was not, therefore, at all analogous to the present case. So much was rioting takeon to ha a mnatter of course at Irish elections that an Act had been passed (the 35th of George MI., c. 29) which provided that disturbances should he no excuse to returning officers to close the poll before the proper time, and authorized them to adjourn the court until a calmer state of affairs was brought about. Another groundaupon which they were asked to set aside the return was that maoral or spirtual intimidation had beenused. Now,itwasdifflculttosaywhatconistittxted undue influence and spiritualintimidation. Supposing that a. candidate started with avowed atheistical views, sarely the ministers of religion had a right to advise the members of their flocks not to vote for that candidate. Again, if a candidate had been convicted of some abominable crime, were nut the instructors of the people to use their influence against him by way of advice and counsel, particularly if their counsel was asked hy the voters? If a Protestant clergyman entertained a strong op ion that the established chu-rch would be endangered by the.1 success of a~ particular Roman Catholio candidate, might he not sy to the voters, " In mny opinion you cannot conscientiously vote for that mnan because his object is to subvert the Protestant Church." Surely, them, it the Roman Catholic priesthood thought thattheir cburchwould be endangeredhy the success of a particular candidate, they might endeavour to persuade thetir flecks not to vote for that candidate. It was unnecessary for himi as an advocate. to pronounce anL opinon as to whether it was righLt or wrong for the Archbishop to exercise his influence in the imanner in which he admitted he bad exercised it, but he asked whether, eDxercised in that ma-nner, it could be called undue and improper influence or intimidation? The learned counsel poeeded to refer to the 5th section of the Corrept Practie Act (17th and 18th of Victoria, cap. 102), which defined the offence of uLndue inaluence, and contended that the words " force, violence, or restraint," and inflicting or threatening to inflict any "1injury, damage, harm, or loss" referred only to physical violence or intimidation. The only words which could be supposed~ to inciuae spiriteiai threats w!ere the general words, "1or in any other manner practise intimidation." Bat, where general words followed particular words they must bo taken to point to somethin of the same kind as the particular words which precede them, espeially in the case of a penal statute. As he had bfr serred, it was very difficult to define mnoral intimiidation. Was4 a father who desired his eon to vote in a particular way to be held guilty of intimidation, ¶ Bet even if the cormmittee should be of opinion that unduae influence had been used, they could not unseat the sitting member unless the also came to the conclusion that that undue influence atad affecte-d the result of the election. Of course, if the undue influence had been practised by the. sitting member or his agents, the case wouldi stand upon a diffret grud ; hut there was not the ligtestevienc t eostuMr. Moore personally. Mr. Moore did not arrive in the county until the Monday before the Friday on wl-ich the nomination took. place; he then went to his xes$clenco, and he was not in any way implicated Uersonallyin thecharges of'violence made by the other side, wudnw call attention to what occurred in the oppo~ito camp. Colonel Hliggins's father was the sheriff ,f the county, and he appointed nine deputy-sheriffs, seven of whom were on Colonel Higgis's -provisional committee, and one at least, Mr. Sharkie, was Colonel Hfiggins's inti. mate friend. Was it not likely that Mr. Moore's spporters would becomne exasperated when they found a gentleman presiding in every polling-booth who was an avowed partisan ofColonel Higgins? All the magistrates deputed to act durin the election and to command the military were the friend of Colonel Higgins, and the sheriff refused to appoinlt many magistrates of the highest respectability, friends of Captain Palmer, the usual patic on these occasions being to appoint an equal numberraolfegentlemen on both sides. The committee must have remarked that all the witnesses who hsAd been called oni the other side were partisans of Colonel Higgins. No impartial witnesses, such as the officers who comnmanded the miilitary had been called, and, notwithatandin& the pledge of his learned friend Mr. Jaimes, Colonel Higgins himself had not been called. The learned counsel then proceeded to remark upon the evidence which had been given, contrasting it with the opening statement of Mr. Jamies, who, .he said, had not kept his promise to be as guarded in his statement as if he were conducting a criminal prosecution. The first scene to which their attention had been called took p laos at Claremorris, and the result of the evidence was that onie voter had been knocked down in a car by a stone and all the rest bed plumnped for Colonel Higgins. There was no proof that Father Reynolds had rushed cur, of his chapel at the head of a mob, that the military had been attacked, and several voters injured, as his learned friend had stated. He next came to Ballinrohe, Now, if Father Coseway had been guilty of the conduct attribute to him he would not defend that conduct ; hut ho reminded the committee that the questioni was not whether Conxway had acted improperly. but whether his acts had affected the result of the election. The evidenice as to the meaning of the Irish exPressions used by Conway in addressing the people was by no means clear, but even if it were a denunciation its only effect was te disgust the voters, because all of them p lumped for Colonel Higgins. As to .the meeting with M1r. Burke, it could not be supposed that Conway hopedl to intimnidate that gentleman. No doubt but for interruption Mlr. Burke would have gone on to Ballinrobe, bet he was the only person affected by it. It wasbardly worth wbiletomention the affair of thehaysud straw, excePs to point out the difference between the evidence of the man who had charge of the cart and thatof Mr.Burke. With regard to the four cars fell of voters, one of whoam jumaped out and ran-away when. themob cameup, maight there not have been a secret desire on thepart of some of thevoters who were being escorted into the town by the military to take the earliest opportunity of getting away and voting for the candidate whom they ready prefered ? The voters who were taken to Cong were not hU~jected to any violence. WNNhen they arrived aBallilnrobe they went to the poll in company with their own friendls and voted, accordin to their, consciences, for Moore and Higgins. On the i0on- day, which was pmarket day, Ballinrobe was no doubt in state of exaitemeni,,but certainy not to such an extent as to interfere wiith the freedom of election or to ~.revent voters from going to the poll. On the morning of 'l uesday thme town was quiet, but the party of Colonel Higgins, finding the election.- going against him, then thought of getting up a case of riot and inutimidation to lay before a committee. The Riot Act was read, although there was no pretence for reading it; and in spite of the remonstrances of several of the landowners of the county the poll was adjourned, The next day (Wednesday)the town was perfectly quiet and the poll remained open all day. With regard to the allegation that Conway had aworn three voters on some book not to vote for Colonel Hie!gins, it was only borne out by the state'ment of. one witness, a farmservant of Colonel Higgins, whose testimnony was so unsatisfactor that it could not be rolled on ; and none of the vtrsidto have been so sworn ha been produced. The result of the evidence as to Conway was that, assumintg the accusations against him to have been proved, not more than five or six voters had been affected by his acts. 'Hea next came to the chapel at Bohola, where Father Hallgau was said to have recommnended the people not to vote for Colonel Higgins.. There was no evidence of any denunciation, and in spite of Father Halligan his address to the people was immediately answered by Mr. Ml'manus. Theni there 'was the case. of Archdeacon Coghlan, who addressed the people from a window. Without express. ing any opinion as to the propriety of that act, he submitted that the archdeacon was, no douibt, exercising an undouibted right as a citizen in addressing the PeoDle. Evidenocehad been given with regard to Swinford, b~it it only an, ounted to this, that the town was in the usual state of excitement consequent upon an election. As to the two men who had been committed by Mir. Curran, the facts, as Mr. Moore would state them, were these :-The two men, who lived' at a distance fromi the town, wanted to get home, and endeavoured to mnake their way to Mr. Curr&a in order that he might ball them. Being unable to reach him, in consequience of the mob which surrounded the hotel where he was staying, they applied to Mr. Moore, who, late at night, upon fiding that they had been committed for a small niatter, and that the case was one for which bail was usually taken, consented to hail them, and they appeared at the next sessions to answer the charge. There wan a witness whio said that soime one told him that his soul would, go to hell if lie voted for Higgins, hut, as he was unable to name the person who made use of that expression, of course it wvas very difficult to disprove it. The witness, too, admaitted that his lanidlord's agent voted for Moore and Palmer. It was impossible to justifY language such as that said to have been used by the Priest at Kilmena, and the Archbishop had told them that if it was used he reprehended it; but what had been. the effect of that miixture of buffoonery and denunciation if it had been uttered? It had not been proved that Colonei Higgins had lost a single voter by it. At Castle. bar there was no interruption to the proceedings of the election. A witness, Gaznon, was expected to prove a case of intlinidation, but he only said that whenx the priest' threatened to denounce him from the altar he threatened to bring; an action againist the priest. and h oe i.f,1,,, niggis. she priest certaisly seemed to bave been intimidated more than the voter. He had now gone through the evidence as to the acts of the priests, and he submitted that it was very slight and frivolous. If a conspiracy between the Archbishop and the clergy had been proved, or if the Archbishop had sanctioned the acts of the priests, the case would present a very different aspect. But if the evidence led the committee, as he contended that it would, to the ccnclusion that there was a strong desire on the part of the Romn,an Catholic clergy, from the Archbishop downwards to support Mr. Moore and to oppose ColoneiHiggi,s bau that they entered irito no combimation to carry out that object by violence or illegal means, then the acts which had been proved were only isolated acts of individual clergy. nien, and wonld not affect the return. A comparatively small number of theclergy of thediocess had beenim licated Mayo coutained about h0 cbapels; no priests had beea implicated except those he had mentione , and taking it at the worst the few votes affected by the acts of the priests would not affect Mr. Moore's majority, and the county had never been more closely polled than at the last election. Bat supposing the cases to be 'proved against the 'priests, how far would Mr. Moore be implcated so as to prevent him from sittingiu Parhanient . Before Mr. Mooao could be made responsible for the acts of any persons the agency of thos peron must be clearly established, and the cass f u:ndue influnce,: likethat of bribery st-ood upon a different footing with regard to the question of agenoy from that of treating. 'A person guilty of using undue influenceB was not only disqualified from sitting in Parliament, but was liable to penqlties for a misdemeanour, but no one could be held to be guilty of using undue influence unless he had per sonally authori7ed the acts 'whioh constituted it. Uhe evidence in this case fell, far short of that poit. Mr Moore was not proved to have attended any meeting either' of priests or of laymen. Ho had canvassed with Oonway, but that was no. proof of ConLways agency. . candidat coild not bo held liable for the Acts of all the friends wih6 might assistliini in. canvasaing g'town, The circumstance of Cnway.having accomnpsuied~ Mr.oore to the itown in bis aarriage wac the .result 'of anu accident. It' was 'a mnonstrous proposition. of hislearnaTed friend tha II,'lMoore was the mrere puppet of the prlests, and was -therefore affected by their acts as a body. It was lot because Candidate derived a benefit fromn a combination when a Corn. bination existed that he was to be held responsible fomall the acts of each rnember of that combination. MSr. Moore bad no cominittee-room at the hotel at which the placard put in by his learned friends was posted up, but even? if he adonghthetobe madezesponsibleforit9 It was ihms. terial whethler the resolution published in the placard was the precise resolution signed by the bishops or. not, but it was certainy not unlawful for the bishops to issue a placard declaring their opinions as to the different candidatc. sothing in that resolution indicated any unlawful attempat coercion or intimidation, mor was anything done by tha Archbishop in his pastoral (the essence of whi'h was ai curately stated in 2the Times) beyond e-xpressing a desir i that the election should be peacefully conducted, withonut at the same time disguising his wishes as to the result. I% conclusion, the learned counsel.- said ha was sure the comnmittee would ive this case the attention which its gravity demanded, and not lightly come to the conclusion tha-, charges of such enormrity as those which had been btough against the whole body of the priesthood had been proved Everything that had been done had at any rate beendons openly, and with no attempt at concealment as far as thi Archbishop and the bishops were concerned. Opinions openly expressed might be openly combated. But, if the open demonstration of political opinion and religious feeling were put down, an incentive would be given to the exercise of a more secret, and therefore more dangerous influenc upon the winds of the electors. If any priest~ had gone beyond their duty in any of the acts they had done durina the election, they would be reprehended by those in authority over them. At the conclusion of the learned counsel's address, The CHAftRmAi, called the attention of Mr. Edwin James to a letter which he had received from the ReJ. Mr. Reynolds, parish priest, at Claremorris. Mr.Reynolds saidthat Mr. James in his opening address had imputed to him conduct quite unworthy not only of a Christianminister, but of a lay gentleman. Mr. Reynolds then quoted the passage in Mr. James's speech which referred to him, and added that he could disprove by the mosb respectable testimony every iota of the statement, aud could show that he was not in the streets of Claremorris at any time during the aray. M'r. E. JAmzS was much obliged to the Committee for giving hima an opportunity to do justice toMr. Reynolds and to himself, and he wouldYetad the evidence which eAd boen given with regard to Mr. Reynolds. Mr. M. Sii= objected to this course being tiken, His learned friend might either withdraw or repeat his charges against Mr. Reynolds, but this was not a proper time for commenting on the evidence. His learned friend had better wait until the time came for him to address the Committee. The CHAIRtIAN said his only object was to show Mr. Reynolds thatjustice would be done him. After some further discussion between the learned'counsel, it was agreed that Mr. James should defer his romarks upon the subject until the time when he woald have a right to address the Committee. The Committee then adjourned until 11 o'clock this day. MAIDSTONE. The committee re-assembled at 11 o'clock on Saturday. A witness named Dolage proved that he had been canvassed by Mr. Hope; that his employer, Mr. Parton, had told hima that he shlould have 51. if lie voted for the Conservatives; that Mr. Giallam had also told him that if he voted for Hope he should not regret it; and that since the election Giliam had said to him that he had hoped all things would have been quiet by that time, and that they might have squared up with their voters. On croes-examination he said he did not think he had told Gilliam that a little assistance would bevery acceptable to him; that he did not remember that Gilliam said ho would not give a fraction for a vote. as the Act was so strict that a glass of beer might ruin the election; and that he imagined what Giliam had said to him to mean that if he wanted assistance hereafter he should have it. By the C00 UTTEB.-He had intended to vote for the Liberals, and the advice of his employer induced him to vote for the Conservatives. There was no positive promise to him, bnt, speaking candidly, he did expect to get money. He conceived that if he applied for assistance after the election it would be given hum. Two witnesses named Harris and Mills proved that they had been promised a consideration if they would vote for Hope and Scott. A boot and shoe maker named Lomer, a tenant of the Town-clerk, Mr. lIonckton, stated that at the time of the election he was in arrear 71. for rent, that he had voted for Hope and Scott, and, although he had paid rent since the election, had never been troubled for the arrears Alfred Pratt, a quarryman, stated that a Conservative agent named Shorb had scattered money among the men in the quarry where he was employed. The committee adjourned at 2 o'clock until this day. CAMBRIDGE (BOROUGH). On Saturday the scrutiny was resumed by the Commit tee, and shortly before the hour of adjournment, when the sittiDg member was in a majority of one, The learned counsel for the petitioner said that, although there were more votes to which objection might be taken. yet, considering the decisions at which the Committee had arrived in the cases which had already been brought before them, they did not feel justified in causing any furtber expense to be incurred in the prosecution and defence of the petition. They therefore begged to withdraw the petition. The CHAARistu said he would report the withdrawal of the petition to the House. In the report which appeared in our impression of Tuesday last a voter named Stamford Is erroneously represented to have admitted that he received 101. for voting for Macaulay sandSteuart inl1852. MIr. Stenart was net a candidate for the borough at the election which took place in thati year. BURY. The Committee reassembled this morning. All the mem bers were present. The counsel who appeared during the day were Mr. James, Q.C., Mr. Phinn, Q.C., Mr. Redwell, and Mr. Clerk, for the petitioners; Mr. Monk and Mr. T. T. Atkinson for the sitting member. David Greenwood, a member of Mr. Philips's committee, and a canvasser, s'ated the arrangemeats which were made for the canvass, wbich were of the ordinary character. William Lord Parkinson, heraldic painter, and a non. elector of Bury, gave evidence as to the proceedings of the meetings at the Albion. His account was substantiaily the same as that given by a witness examined on Friday. Joseph Catlow, one of the non-elector canvassers, stated thlat he went with a party of 10 or 11 to the shop of a draper named Sparrow. They asked him to vote for hillips, and when he refused to promise, threatened that if he did not they would spend no money at his shop. They afterwards reported the result of their canvass to Thomas Baldwin at the Albion Hotel. He said that they had done very well and must go on. On the following day witness and a man named Whatmore went to the shop of a man with whom the latter dealt. They met Peter Cooper, and in reply to a question as to how things were going on, he told them that t e non-electors bad got about 70 votes. On the morning after the election he saw Mr. Thomas Grundy, and asked him for the money which had been, romised him by Cooper for his services. Mr. Grundy sai that he could not pay a penny, because if he did the election would be upset. William Sparrow, tailor and draper, stated that on the Tuesday before the election three or four men came and asked him how he intended to vote. He said that he shoald not vote at all. They said if he didanot vote for Philips they w-ould spend no money at his shop. JainesFarrer, clerk to Mr. Harper, solicitor, proved that the signature of a letter dated " Mr. Phillipes Committeeroom," and ordering some sawdust to be sent to the theatre, was in the handwriting of Mr. Thomas Baldwin. I William Ray, a man who at the time of the election kept a heerhouse in Eden-street, Bury, said that on the Tuesday before the election Mr. Thomas Wrigley, the chairman of Mr. Philips's committee, and his son, Mr. Edwin, called and solicited his vote. He declined to speak to Mr. Thomas, and he left the room. Witness then told Mr. Edwin that he would not vote because he had twice applied for a license sad could not get it. Edwin Wrigley said that if he woald vote for Philips he would speak tohis father about the license. He then left the room and remained away about two minutes. When he returned he said that his father would see about the license. He did not promise his vote. On the Wednesday night three non-electors cAlled at his house and abused him, James Smith, carver and gilder, stated that he was a' different times canvassed by George Booth, Phineas Rothwell, Mr. James Wrigley, and Mr. Thomas Grundy. Booth told himi that it would be better for him to vote for Mr. Philips, and that if he did not the grass would grow before his door. Rothwell held a power of attorney on his property for 301. which he owed him, and he told him that if e voted for Peel he bad better get some of the Peelites to pay this money. About a week or a fortnight after the election Rothwell sent for him and asked for the moa.ey, which he paid to him. MSr. Jaies Wrigley and Mr. Thomas Gurney told him that if bhewouldiavte for Pbhlips he should have their work, and'they would introduce him to Mr. Thomas Wrigley, and he would no doubt get his to. There was only another carver and gilder in Bury, and MIessrs. Grundy and Wrigley said he should have no more work from them on account o' toe tnck whieh he served them atthe last election. In cross-examination, the witness stated that he voted for Mr. Peel, but he had since had work from Messrs. Grundy. Mary Bury, the wife of a stonemason at Bury, stated that on the Monday week before the election, hr. T. Wrigley told her tbat he had a job " a-gate," and that if her husband was 51. higher than others in his tender he would not bar him out from it. At 3 o'clock the committee adjourned until this (Monduy) morning. OXFORD (CITY). At the sitting of the Committee on Saturday further evidence was given as to the payment of voters who had bee 1 employed as messengers and special constables on the part of Messrs. Neate and Langston, at the Roebuck, after the election. One witness, Golding, said he had received 5s. forhis services as a special constable, besides what he was paid by the town, and had also received another 5s,, but foe what he did not know. He had collected votes for Mr, Langston. Other witnesses stated that they had been paid as Inomengers, but had done nothing but vote. One of the 'voters so paid was a blind mar, The Committee adjourned until this day. rAdvertisement.J" Deeds, not Words ". a-Home Story, by xL3 elu, rioe 2 boarda. ianow ready.

LA v REPORT. COURT OF_ CANCERY, LINcor's-n , JuLY 4. LOMIBE V RTnhawiTnA JJJejorc Ue hLORD UHANCELLOR.] Xr. .Satly and.Mr. Toiler appeared in support of a peti. tion for a rehearing of this cause, which was decided in the ear 1841 by the then Vice-Chancellor. The testator, Sir oohn Lombe, had left a large fund to be applied to the parpose of bulding a mansion on his estate in Norfolk, with a direction that the fund should accumulate until the house was finished. Considerable delay took place in com- peig the house, and the fund increased to a very large amount, leaving a surplus of about 20,000. 5fic finishing the buildings. The Vice-Chanceelor directed the fund to be appliedto building purposes at a time when it was not known the surplus would be so large, but the order was mado without prejudice to any question as to the surplus. This surplus was now claimed by the representatives of the successive tenants for life, on the ground that they (tbe tenants for life) had been deprived of the enjoyment of the house, and were therefore entitled to the fund by way of compensation. The LoRD CrA.CE.L0on, without expressing any opinion that a rehearing was necessary for the purposes suggested, gave leave for Vice-Chancellor Kindersley to rehear the case if he found himself fettered by the wording of the decree. The Attorney-General, Mr. Swanston, Mr. Cairns, Mx. Fleming, Mr. W. Morris, and other counsel, appeared for the different respondents. FYFE V. ARBOUTHISOT. This was an appeal from a decree of the Muter of the Rols, dismissing the plaintiff Is bill. The object of the suit was to reform a family arrngement andl settlement made on the marriage of the plaintiff in February, 180, .by striking out a covenant tberein. It appearedthatthe plam tiff was entitled, under the will of his father, Captain Fyfe, late of the East India Company's service, to .a sum of 25,0001., payable on the death of his mother, who had a life interest in the whole of the testator's property, and that his sster, Jane CurrieFyte, since deceased, was entitled upon the same terms to a reversionary interest in the residue of the testator's estate9. The plaintiff being in pecuniary difficztl. ties in February, 1850, executed the indenture now- sought to be reformed, and thereby by an arrangement with his mother placed in settlement what then remained of his reversionary interest in the 25,000W. The objectionable covenant in such deed, and which the plaintiff insisted had been inserted by mistake and contrary to the real intentions of the-parties, was in the following words *- "Aned in cosideration of the said relea rt by the said Jane Currie We fo her life interest in the sid dnams of stock be, the sai Douls Mu1ro itsae (the plaintiff), berebycovenantswith sha tutees for motitne being that i bet t e said Douglas Munro F Cfe, shal at any time obain or beome entitled to any proverty exceeding in vsiue the sum of ,the Janl1mediate Fatrfeslil obtain t osestion of thesanae, or becomne entitled thereto, agois the satne to the trupte for the time heing upon the trusts neresy declared concerning the other truat fend.' The reridue of the testator's property, to which Jane Catherine Fyfe was entitled on the death of her mother, Jane Carrie Fyfe, consisted of 108,176 sicca rupees, and she died in August, 1851, intestate, whereupon the plaintiff and his mother, as the only dext of Idn of the said Jane Cathe. rine Fyfe, became entitled in moities to the 108,176 sicea rupees, subject to Jane Coie Fyfe's life interest therein. It was under these circurstances that the plaintiff was desirous of dealin- 'with his sbare in Isis sister's estate, hut found himself 'hampered by the beforementioned covenant. tl was contended on behaf of the plaintiff that the intention of the parties to the deed of 1850 was only to settle whaeve th painiffmigt ecoe etitedto under his fathr'swil, ad culd ot herfor inlud the interest he too thoug hi siters itesacy Atany rate the blank in the covenant rendered it void for uncertainty.

VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS, JULY 4. SCLATFR V. nlVrA%r t4yorC VWc8-UhancdUor Sir R. T. XM-DiM.xy. This case came on upon three motions in the nature o' exceptions to the chief clerk's certificate, whereby he had alowed and disallowed certain sums to parties in this and other suits under these circumstances:-By a settlement, dated in lSOI, certain leaseholds were vested in trustees in trust forRobert Cottam forlife; remainder to hiswife, Fanny Cottam, for hfe ; remainder to their children. A sale took place under powers in the settlement, and in 1829 Fanny Cottain's share was laid oct in the purchase of leaseholds for lives held of the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury. She mortgaged that property to a Mr. Smedley and a Miss Hawkins, who afterwards died, and her mortgage became vested in a Mrs. Sankey, and there was a subsequent mortgage to a Mr. White. The lives were allowed tdrop, so that one life only remained, and the Dean and Chapter refused to renew except upon very high termns. A suit was instituted for such renewal, and the deficiency of the necessary fund was to be made up by a mortgage upon the pre3nises. Policies of assurance were effected upon the life of a caetui qeue vie, and Smedley, the first mortgagee, paid two premiums on account of one policy, which he then allowedto drop, and claimed those sums in priority to the second mortgagee, as also a sum of 31. for travelling expenses at the request of Fanny Cottam. The plaintif, one of the trustees of the settlement, also claimed certain sums he had from time to time paid to Fanny Cottam, amounting in aU to. 1541., and Smedley claimed the whole of his costs in the suit for renewal, and in another suit, in which he was a defendant, and in which the sale of the leaseholds was impeached, he being in yossession through the trustees, and having himself received the rents personally. The chief clerk had disallowed the premiums as against the second mortgagee, had disallowed the 1541. paid by the plaintiff to Fanny Cottam, had allowed the travelling expenses to Smedley, but as to the costs had only allowed his disbursements, or actual costs out of pocket in the two suits for renewal and to impede the sale. Mr. Selater excepted to the chief clerk's disallowance of the 1541., and also tothe allowance of the travelling expenses; and Smedley excepted to the disallowance of the premiums and the allowance of the disbursements only, claiming the whole co t'. mr. olasse and Mr. Sclater appeared for the trastees; Mr. SwaDston and Mr. Ward for the second mortgagee; M1r. Baily and Mr. G. L. Russell for the first inortgagee. ihe motions were argued upon the 22d and 25th of May last, when his Honotr reserved his judgment. The ViCECHALNCELLnO now referred to the facts in detail, and said that he thought the chief clerk was right in disallowing thel1641., which was, in fact, paid out of mere compas4ion to Mrs. Cottam; he came to this conclusion with regret. As to the travelling expenses, the chief clerk was WrOng, as that was a mere personal debt between Smedley and MIrs. Cottam. With respect to the premiums. Mr. Smedley had no right as between him and Mr. White to deductthepremiums out of rents received bg him, and therefore the chief clerk was right upon that item. 'Tpon the question of costs, it was remarkable that there was no case to guide the Court, hut the principles were these,-that a *mortgagee was entitled as between himself and the mortgagor, or those representing him, to have taken into account the costs of protecting the title, and though entitled to expenses properly incurred in employina' a collector, .c., he could not charge for his own trouble. ban these principles the chief clerk's certificate was right. The case was analogous to that of a trastee, but not identicaL As to both suits, therefore, he could only he allowed his costs out of pocket. IN RE DON'S E-STATE. This was a petition for payment out of court of a sum of 7301., paid into court under the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Improvement Act, under these circamstances:-David Don, a Scotchman, in 1817, pledged himself to Elizabeth Hogg, a Scotchwoman, with whom he cohabited, and had a son, David Don, and afterwards married Blizabeth Hogg, at Dunfermline. David Don, tha son, came to this countrv, and purchased real estate at Newc3stle-upon-Tvne, and died unm arried and intestate. David Don, the father, then took possession of the land, and the Newcastle-upon-Tyne corporation having taken the proparey for the improvement of the town under their Act, a questioa of title 'was raised as to the right of David Don, the father, to the property in question, now represented by tbe parcbase nioney (7301.) paid into court; and that questioo, ari-ing under the Inheritance Act, the 3rd and 4th of WVil. lham 1V., cap. 166, was now argued upon the usual petition for payment out of court. Mr. ANDERSON and Mlr. POTTEB appeared for David Don, the father, and contended that, under the Inheritance Act, the 3rd and 4th of William 4, cap. 106, sec. 6, he was entitled to the real estate of his son, as his lineal ancestor. Mr. LEE and Mr. WIesNs appeared for the Crown, and argued that, the son being illegitimate, according to the law of England, the petitioner, claiming under the Inheritance Act, was not entitled. Mr. CJIUCHESTER for the corporation of Newcastle, Mr. ANDERSON was heard in reply. The VICE CHANCELLOR said that this was aimaost a new question, the case not being likely to occur again. Under the old practice, the question turning entirely on the Act of Parliament, and a very small part of it, he should have seat a case to law, but that he could not now do. Had theiudges not been absent on circuit he should have requiredthe assistance of one to have the case argued before them. He should now consider the case, and if he thought it still necessary to obtain such assistance he should request it. (Beforc Vice-ChancelZor Sti J. STUART.) HOOD V. HOOD. This was a special case. In January last a purchaser, now deceased, bought certain lands for 3501., and paid a deposit thereon of 701. The purchase was to be conipleted on the 25th of Mateli, but the purchaser died on the 4th of that mon'h intestate. The question was, whether the heir-atlaw of tho purchaser was entitled to have the balance of the purchase mnoney paid out of the personal estate of the purchaser. By the 17th and 18th of Victoria, cap, 113, section 1, it is enacted that where any person shall die seisei cf lanids which shall at the time of his death be charged -with the payment of any sum of money by way of mortgage, and shall not By will or deed orother document have expsessed a contrary intention, the heir or devisee to whom such lands shall descend or be devised shall not be entitled to have the mortgage debt discharged or satisfied out of the personal estate or any other real estate of such person, but the lands so chaTgad shall as between the different persons clainming through or under the deceased person be primarily liable to the payment of all mortgage debts with which tWe eame shall be charged. It was contended on behadf of tbe defendant, the personal representative of the deceased purchaser, that the unpaid portion of the purchase. suoney was. a lien on the lands sold, and that it was a mortgage thereon within the intent and meaning of the abova Act. lMr. Cary appeared for the plaintiff, who was the heir-atLaw ef th9 deceased purchaser and Mr. Rogers fo6 the defendant. TheVIoE-CHANcLLoRsaidthattheunpaidpartoftho put: chase-money was not a mortgage withia either tlie letter or. the spirit of the Act, which had only taken awaytheright of exoneration which the law had formerly given to an heir or devisee as against the personal estate of a deceased inmo2tgagor. The balance of the purchase-money must be piotfe personali estateof the deceased purchaser wvith interest up totheoday of payment, - There wAould thereFore be an answrer in the afl;irmative. RAl.ELAGH V.- This was a claim for the specific performanoe of an atgreement made in January Iast for the sale to the plaintiffs of certain lands belonging to the defendant for the sum of 1,SOOI. The defendant, iwho was a market gardener, was a depositor in the RoyalBritish Bank, and had a balinoe there of about OO&., and he was induced by the represer[tations of a clerk in that concern to uchase two shares in it, for which he paid 1001., and which were standing in his name at the time of the stoppage of the bank. In Febxuary last, after the contract with the plaintiff was entered iuto, judgnments to the amount of upwards of 90U. which had been recovered against the Royal British Bank were registered against the defendant. The plaintiff accepted the defendant's title, except as to the above judgments if they were a matter of title, wbich the plaintiff submitted they were not. Aquestion wasraisedas to whetherthe defendant,the vendor, was bound to discharge the judgments before the conveyance was execnted, and it was urged by the counsel both for the plaintiff and for the defendant that the Court should decide that question now. It was contended for the defendant, who submitted to a decree for specifin performances, that the judgments having been registered against him before the date of the contract for sale to the plaintifs did not affect the defendants lands. lr. Malins and Mr. W. D. Lewis were for the plaintiff and lr. Bacon and Mr. Roxburgh for the defendant. The ViCE.CHANCELLOR said that this was not the proper time to decide whether the defendant was bound to satisfy the Judgments before executing a conveyance. There must be a decree for specific performance and a reference to chambers to settle a proper conveyance in case the parties should differ, bat no reference as to title. The iudgments were a question not of title but of conveyance.

THE VICE-cAcxr.osF OF OXFORD. This was a special case stated forthe opinion of the Court under the powers of a Local Act of Parliament, the 17th and 18th of Victoria, for regulating the poor within the city of Oxford, and for rating certain hereditaments in the University. The question raised was whether the University was liable to be rated to the relief of the poor in respect of the following buildings and land:-1, The Bodleian Library; 2, the Divinity and other schools; 3, the Convocation House; 4, the Old Convocation House and Law School; 5, the Sholdonian Theatre: 6, the Ash. moleau Museum; 7, theClarendon buildings; 8, the Botanio Gardens; 9, the Taylor Institution; 10, the 'University galleries; 11, the College Chapels; and, 12, the College Librarie3. ARl these buildings and land were situate within the city of Oxford Poor Lawv Union. and, with the exception of the college chapels and libraries, they were the property of the university. Members of the university paid certain fees annually, some also at matriculation and before examinations, and on each graduation. The moneys so levied were applied to the maintonance of the police, the keeping up of the pablic walks, the defence of the property, the extinction of fire, the Bodlelan Library, and the payment of its officers. The university and colleges claimed to be exempt from rateability in respect of all these buildings and land, upon the ground that there was no boneficial occupation. The guardians, on the other hand, contended that the university or colleges occupied most of the baildings and land by their servants, or their furniture or books, and all of them by their scholars and members, and therefore that they were rateable as beneficial occupiers within the 43d of Elizaletb, cap. 2. The case was argued in the course of the last term by Mr. Pashley, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Tomlinson), on the part of the parish; and by the Solicitor-General (with whom was Mr. Welsby) on the part of the university. The Court having taken time to consider, Mr. Justice CoLEisDGnx now delivered judgment. The question was whether the occupation by the university or colleges was beneficial in the sense required to make the occupiers of property rateable. A body corporate might so occupy property as to be rateable, just as a private individual might occupy it so as not to be rateable. The general principle was that the public was not liable to b3 assessed to the poor-rate, and therefore a body which only iepresented the public, and occupied for the public, stood on the same footing. So also the occupation might be both public and private, and the occupier might be rateable in part and exempt in part. The University of Oxford rmight bo said to be a great national institution, erected for national purposes,-viz., for the advancement of religion aud learning. Tho Court would therefore see in each case whether the occupation was for the purpose for which the university was created, or whether it was for a private purpose. In the frst place, "the Bodleian Library" was a great storehouse of aU that was valuable in literature and learning, and what would the university be withoat it? It was not merely an ornament, bat a necessity. Presumptively, therefore, its occupation by the university was for the public; and there was nothing in the circunm stances stated to show that this was not the case. It was, therefore not rateable. The same presumption arose in the case of the " Divinity and other schools," where accommodation was provided, not only for the examiners and can. didates, bat for those who were in sktu pupiflari, as well as for strangers, whose presence at the examinations wasa stimulus and reward to those who were examined. It wa5 lot stated that there was any excess. With respect to the salaries, they were not great, and had no bearing on the question; and the university would not be complete if it had not the power of conferring degrees. "The Con. vocation House" was not rateable, but it was said the University was rateable in respect of one of the rooms caUed ", the Apodyterium," because in that room fees were paid when degrees were conferred, and it was also used as the place for the sitting of the Vice-Chancellor's Court. Bat tho university did not sell its degrees, and the Court did not think there was anything in those circumstances to sffect the question, and render the university liable to the rate. "The Old Convocation Bouse and Law School' came within the same rule. The law professor aud professors of Latin received cortain fees, but they had no reference to the ccoupation; they were officers ,f the university, employed to deliver lectures. The fireengine which was kept ina partof the building was subsidiary to the general purpose. " The Sheldenian Theatre," in its ordinary use, vould not render the university rateable . and, with respect to the special use to which the theatre vas applied, the Coart thought that was a fitting complerrent to the general purposes of the university. Its occa. sional use for purposes of a concert would not make its occupiers rateablo any more than a triennial concert ia a cathedral wouldaffectits occupationbytheDeanandChapter The cellars underneath the theatre appeared to be so regularly occupied by an individual for his own benefit that, to that extent, and so long as they were so occupied, the university would be rateable. With respect to " the Ashmolean Museum" the Court thought the lower part of it, occu,'edbythereaderinmineralogy, was rateable; butthere was nothing connected with the upper part of it (the Museum) from which the Court could infer a liability to the 'ate. With respoot to "the Clarendon Buildings" and police-rooms the Court thought they were all used or purposes subsidiary to the principal purposes, aud fell within tho general grounds of exemption, As to "the Botanio Gardens," the residence of the professor and head gardener must be held rateable; but the Botanic Garden itself was not so. Botany was one of the seiences for the promotion of which the university was supported; and it was requisite that there should be a living garden, which was a sort of botanic library. It was expressly found that no fruit or vegetables were grown for use or sale, but only choice trees and medicinal and other plants for the promotion of the science of botany. The applL cation of land to such a purpose would ,not iexempt land in the hands of a private person, for the intellectual gratification it would afford would be the "rent." But, in this case it was applied to a public purpose and for purp)ses of inFtruction. With respect to "the Taylor Institution," the Coart thought the general body of it was not rateablo. But it was not stated in the case whether or not it was necessary that the librarian should reside on the spot. If it was necessary that he should reside, he would be rateable for any excess of accommodation beyond what was necessary for his private convenience, whioh ought to be liberally construed; and what might be considered ex¢es5 with regard to the porter would not be,so considerea in reference to the librarian. Thereo was nothing in reference to "the university GallerinsO to nake the university-rateable. With respect to the "College Cisapele" and"Oellege Libraries," the Court thought the collegesrateable. They wanted, the ground of exemption oii which the university rested. The chapels were cenaerated, but that ,did not msake them exempt w3emi in the auis of a college, iny nioT P than h rivatoclhpe ' inaho would be, or a proprietary chapel, if the bishop should be induced to con. secrate it. These colleges, therefore, would be rateable in sespect both of the chapels and libraries. asoNwLr (VZTsRy CLERK OF ST. GZOBGZ'S-IN.THE.XAST v. ThII LONDON DOCK COxPmY. This wvas a special case for the opinion of the dourt, and which raised the question whether the London-D,ock Company were liable to be rated in respect of their " quays and basibs," as well as of their "w arfs and warehouses," to a rate made by the local trustees in pursuance of an order made by the vestry to raise the sum of 6,0001. for generAl purposes. One-half the - sum in question was required to defray the expense incurred in paving the streets of the parish, and under a local paving Act (17th of George IIL, cap. 22) the con an , thiough rateablein respect of their wb harfs and warehouses," had been held not to be rateable in respect of their "auays and basins." By the 159th section of the Metropolis Local Managem;ent Act, it is enacted that,- "When It appews toary vesdry orditrict board that aU or any part of the ex(esremafor defraying vhiche any sumn Ii by, 4uch v@sor O boar th erd it {rbe levied as aferoslWd bare or bam been incumfor the special beueistof aLysrticar ar.t ot their parish oadistrict, or otheawire hare or bas not been incurred for the equa benefit of the whole of their pavilh or districot, sch vestry or board masy bY any such o der direct the sum or aums n;oesayor delrailaseus xpeure of ai,y part thereKf to b. levled in such pars, orexemrpt any-paste ofuch w.rrfh or dltrlet fromn the lovy, or require a leas rate 65 be levied tereer, aa the circmstane or the cae may requIre" - It was submitted to the vestry that the expenses in queshton bad been incurred for the special benefit of a part of the parish, aud not for the equat benefit of the whole; aud the cornu~any claimed exemnption in respect of thelr "qnuars and baams,"' in the occupation of wbich they contended they derived no benefit from t.lae paved streets. '-'t it did not appear to the vestry that such was the aeue and the resolved that the company wrere not entitled to any exems,. - , - -daT Tue poor-rate assessment was the only basis of assessment for the whole parish. The question for the Court was, whether the company were concluded by what appeared to the vestry; or whether they were not at liberty to show that there was, in fact, an unequal benefit, and so to obtain an exemption, or at least a reduction of the rate. The question was argued in the last term, and time being taken to consider, Mr. Justice ERLE now delivered the judgment of the Court, to the effect that the Dock Company ought to be relieved from the undue assessment. By the 150th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act the duty was cast upon the vestry to apportion the burden of the rates, and if any part of the property of the company derived no benefit from the expense incurred the company was entitled to be relieved from contributionto that portion. If it-was a fact that there was an exoessive imposntion, the Court thought the company was entitled to be relieved, though it might not appear so to the vestry, and that the rate ought to be amended according to the fact. The Court observed that the general purview of the Metro. pohsa Local Management Act was directed ratber to the power of administration than to the liability of the property to he rated; and it never could have been the intenton of the Legislature that the company, which previous to the Act had been rated upon -a value of 17O,00? only should be thenceforward rated upon an annual value of 73,0001. The Act was not intended to take away the exenption which the company formerly enjoyed, but to enact that where there was an equality of benefit there should be an equality of rates. Some of the profits of the comrany were connected with the paved streets, and some of them were not; and it wiould be referred to an arbitrator to settle the amount to be paid by the company according to the principles laid down by the court. Should any difficulty arnse the parties could again apply to the Court on a clearer statement of facts. JACESON V. CODISRTNAY AND OTEMS. This waDS a special case for the opinion of the Court, and which raised the question whEtther the mini*ter~of the St. James's Chapels Pentonville, was justified inl expelling the cerk of the said chapel from the vestry room, the clerk h.aving entered the same contrary to the mninister's prohibl. The question was argued in the course of last term by Mr. Knowles, Q.C. (with whom was Ir. T. Atlkmson) for tho plaintiff; and by Mr. Sumner for the defendant. It appeared that the plaintiff was appointed clerk and sexton hy the incumbent of the mother church in 1843, and continued to act as such down to the of 9thSeptember, i855 without interruption. The defendant, the Rev. Dr., Courtenay, some time previously to April, 1854, had been appointed curate; but in that month, by an order in Council, a district was assigned to the consecrated chapel of St. James's. The plaintiff, without receiving any new appointment, continued to act as clerk and sexton; buat, on the 18th of August, 1855, in consequence of some differences vhich had taken place between him and the defendant, Dr. Courtenay, the latter gave the clerk formal notice that his services would be dispensed with after the 26th of August. The plaintiff, hcowever, continued to attend in discharge of his duties as usual till the 9th of September, whsen, by the orders of the defendant, he was prevented from ehterin" the clerklsde*kTheplaintiffwasaf tervardsprohibitedfromenlter ingthevestry-room, but, notwithstanding thisprohibition, he, on the 26th of September, unlocked the vestry-room as usual and got everything ready for the officiating minister. The defendant, Dr. Courtenay, entered soon after, andrequested the plaintiff to leave, and on his refusal, upon the ground that he had not been legally removed from his office, the defendant sent for a policeman and had him put out of the vestry-room. An action being brought for the assault and imprisonment, the defendant justified on the gtound that he was " Ivafully possessed" of the vestry-room, and that the plaintiff, having beenprohibited from entering, unlawfully entered and remained inthe vestry-room. The plaintiff replied that he was clerk of the chapel, and lawf uly in the vestry-room in the discharge of his necessary duties. The arbitrator had found the verdict for the plaintiff, with 61. damages, but directed that the verdict should be entered for the defendant if the Court should bo of opinion that the defendant was "lawfully possessed" of the vestry-room, and that the plaintiff had been lawfully removed from his office, and unlawfully entered and remained in the vestryroom. The Court having taken time to consider, Mr. Justice ERLE now gave judgment as follows -Upon the facts found by the arbitrator we are of opinion that the power of annual appointment to the office of clerk in this district is in the defendant, under the 59th George II., chap. 134, section 29, and that the continuance of the plaintiff in the office in successive years without an express reappointment in each year would be construed to amount' to reappointment in each year. In "R. v. Ossett" the point for discussion vas the validity of the appointment to the office of clerk. The counsel, impeaching the validity, contended that the power of appointment was in the rector and not in the minister of the chapel, and the Court say that if it is in the rector he has ratified the appointment by the minister of the chapeL The words expressing that the power was in the rector ought not to be taken as deciding the point as between the rector and the minister of the chapel; but as deciding the point above mentioned, then before the Court, and no more. We are further of opinion that the defendant has no power to dismiss from the office during the year of office, without cause ; and that therefore the notice to leave sent in August did not remove the plaintiff froni the office in the following September, when the cause of action arose, there betig no ground for assuming that the year of office began at either of those periods. We are further of opinion that the possession of the vestry-room was in the defendant, and soas to make the entry and remaining ofthe plaintiff, after a prohibition by the defendant, a wrong which justified the defendant in the removal to which the second plea is pleaded. The defendant is therefore entitled to succeed on that plea, and we send back the award to the arbitrator to give effect to our judgmeit on these points. The event of the action is therefore in favour of the defendant, and the power of annual appoinsment to the oftice of clerk is in the defendant, and thushe most im. portant among the matters in difference are in favour of the defendant. The point in favour of the plaintiff- is, that he continued in office when the cause of action arose. The COURT gave judgment in several otherfcases which had been previously argued; but they were for the most part devoid of public interest. (SiUtings at Nisi Prius at GuildhaU, before Lord CAqPBELL and Specidl Jurics.) BERRY V. JARDI:9 AND OTRY. The declaration alleged that the plaintiff caused to be delivered on board a vessel of the defendants, called the Lochmaben Castle, certain printing presses, types,machinery, &c., toh be safely and securely carried to Quebec, all and every the dangers of the seas and navigation excepted; hut that the defendants did not deliver the said goods, although not prevented from so doing by the dangers and accidents of the seasor navigation; but, on the contrary, the defendants, by their servant, the master of the said vessel, go carelessly, negligently, and unikilfolly conducted themselves in and about the mianagement and navigation of the vessel and of the plaintiff's goods thau, by their neglignce and careless. ness, the goods were lost and destroyed. Therevwas another count for trover, and another for special damage by loss of business. The defendants pleaded " Not Guilty," and that the loss iof the goods was occasioned by the dangers and accidents of the sea, and not by their carelessness, negligence, tnsdilfdul ness, or default. Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Bovill, Mr. Lush and Mr. Turner were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. . lill, liMr. Black. burn, and Mr. Archibald Smith for the defendants. Sir F. TissGE8 stated that tho euestion involved In this case was one of the greatest public importance-namely, wbether the captain of a ship proceeding up the Gulf of St. Laurence in foggy weather was bound to use the lead. He thought it right to say that the attorney for tb e plaintiff had discovered a few days before that the plaintiff Whad deceived him as to his circumstances, and as to the value of the property, which he estimated at 6,0001., stating he had got it from his father-in-lavr. It now appeared that both the plain. tift and bis father-in-law vere insolvent, ant would have been forced to abandon the action but for the assistance of their friends. In justice to the latter, ancd on account of the importance the question involved it was determined to go on with' the ca-e which vas one in wbich the Board of T*adetookthe greatest interest. The plaintiff had formerly carried oci business as a printer in Dublin in the early past of 1855 He determined to emigrate to Quebec. and forwarded to Li verpool a quantity of presses and types, which were shbiped on hoard the vessel Lochinaben Caste, Captain Turner, the property of the defendants, Messrs.

Bird Rocks, whieh form a part of the chain of the Msgdalen Ilands. She remained there until the 10th of July, when the eargo and bull-the vessel being 1,300 tons-were sold by auctioax for 33h. each, nmaking a total of 661. The first ana mosi im. port-nt question for the jury was, whether tho vessel had eri run on the rocks by tne gross neglect of the captain, and his total disregard of the well-kaown-rules for the navigationlof the St. Laurence. - In the sailihg directions published by C1aptain Bayfield, at wa*s stated '"thAasihe fogs sometimes lastseveral days in anceession, and te a vessel either zunnisg 'PA or 'ceasing dow during their continuance there is no safe guide but the ecaistant uso of 'tie deepi Asea lead, with a chart containing corrct aoinin&nsY Tho eneral directions were for vq;sels to muake teaita of St. Paul said thence the BirdR s Xos betweeai St. Pauland the bank on wrhich the Magdadens, Bryon Island; and Bird Rock are situated is a channel 12 miles wide, antd, DO soundisz w vith 60 fathomas 9Z line; tshQ soadinKs aioilth ed ,
COURT OF COMIMON PLEAS, WEsT3rmsTriR, TuLY 4. tUtz?fgz 7n B3anco, before Mr. Justice CREsSSWELL and M31r. Justice WILLiTmS.) The Court sat in banco to-day for the purDose of delivering the following judgments:- GRAHAI AND; OTHERS (ASSIGNEES OP HAIMIONfD, ABA.K RUrT) V. lUTOCHISOX AND ANOTHER. The bankrupt Hammond, previous to his bankruptcy, was a merchant in London, and agent to Osborne, Syme, and Co., of New York. Tho defendants were merchants at Liverpool. The action was brought for the amount of some accept ances by the bankrupt, commissions, and interest, Pleas never indebted, and payment into court of an amount. to cover the commissions. The cause was tried before Mr. Justice Willes, when a verdict was found for rPlaintiff, subject to a special case for the opinion of the Court. The facts were that the defendants, who had consigned goods to Osborne, Syme, and Co., in New York, through the bankrupt Hammond, had drawn for two-thirds of the amount of the consignments on the bankrupt, who bad sccepted the draughts, and duly paid thent at maturity. He bad received cover for a portion of them from Obborne, Syme, and Co., but that firm became ultimately bankrupt in America with sufficient funds arising from the defendants' consignments in their hands to meet the plaintiffs' claim. The plaintiffs, however, sought in this laction to recover the amount of theuncdvered acceptances of Hammond,with commission and interest,fromthe defendants. The substantial question was whether the defendants should Ioe in the same position as if the bills had been drawn upon Osborne, Syme, and Co., in which case there would be no va.lid claim under the .circumstancek against the defendants. Rnhere was no sDecific ageement between the parties, but the-t1Zde1itandIng on which-thoy w&eo dealingwastobea inferred from a long 4orrespondenoe. Theletters ef the lGlhof June tended to ehow that the banitrupt was to look to Up proeveds of tho Lg s, andI a¢mt to the defed- ants. [Mr. Justice CRESSWELL here read several other letters written by the parties, and continued:-1 Up to this time we have come to the conclusion that bills drawn by the defendants should bo accepted by the bankrupt on the same footing as if accepted by Osborne, Syme, and Co. Upon subsequent letters, commencing 30th of June, it was contended that a change In the course of dealint was adopted, but we think that the only alteration was in the mode of keeping the accounts. On the count, therefore, for money paid for the use of the bankrupt our judgment is for the defendants. As to the commission that has been paid into court. The only question that remains is as to the interest, ani this zests on the same ground as the principaL Our decision, therefore, is altogether in favour of the defendants. Judgment for the defendants. SIMPSON AND OTHfERS V. TEE ACCIDENTAL DEATH INSURANCE COMPIANY. This- was an action to recover the amount insured upon the life of William Warne Simpson by a policy effected by him with the defendants on the 22d of January, 185L The defendants pleaded that a premium became due on the 22d of January, 1856, before the death of Simpson, andbadnever been paid. The plaintiffs replied that Simpson died on the ]st of February, and that they before the time (21 days) allowed for payment had elapsed were in communication with the defendants, who led, them to believe that the policy was in full force for the year ending January 22, 1857. The case was tried before the Lord Chief Justice at the London sittings after Hilary term, when the jury found that the defendants intentionally withheld information of the non-payment of the premiums from the 8th of February, and that the plaintiffs were misled by the letter of the 5th of February from the secretary of the defendants, and were thereby induced to make no further inquiry, while by makg it they might have ascertained the fact; upon which the verdict was entered for the plaintiffs, the defendants having leave to move to enter the same for them, on the ground that the evidence did not sustain the issue for the plaintifls, or to arrest the judgment, on the ground that the replication did not answer the plea. A rule was accordingly granted and bas been argued, and (said the learned JUDGE) we think that it must be made absolute to enter the verdict for the defendants. At the trial it was proved that the insurance was effected by the deceased against death or injury by accident, the premium being payable on the 22d ot January every year. Deceased died February 1, 1856, the premium due the 4revious 22d of January not having been paid. On tfie 4th of February the executor's solicitor, Mri. Crovwdy, informed defendants of the death of the insured. NCext day the secretary of the company sent, in a letter to Mr, Crowdy, a blank form of certificate of death to be filled up, but the letter stated nothing as to the premium being unpaid, of which circumstance the defendants, in fact, were not aware till they learnt it on the 7th from their agent, to whom it was usually paid. A meeting of the directors of the company was held on the 13tb, when they resolved to repudiate the claim, on the ground that the premium had not been paid witbin the 21 days, and the secretary wrote a letter informing the plaintiff's solcitor of this resolution, which was the first intimation to them that the premium had not been paid. We think this evidence did not sustain the issue for the plaintiffs, because the defendants only abstained from informing the plaintiff that the premium was unpaid. The main question argued was upon the construction of the policy and conditions endorsed on it, andtheright of the executors to pay the premium after the death. The policy insured thedeceased up to the 22d of January, 1852, andeubsequent thereto during thecontinuance of thepolicy, provided he, on or before, or within 21 days of the 22d of January in each year, so long as the directors should accept the same, paid the company the annual premium of 121., subject tothe conditions endorsed. By the first of these conditions the premium was to be paid within 21 days after it first became due, and provided the same should be from to time paid within such 21 days the policies should not be void, notwithstanding the happening before the expiration of the 21 days of the event on which the amount became payable. By the second condition, if the premium should be unpaid for 21 days after becoming first due, the policy should he void. By the fourth condition, when a newpremium should become payable, the company maight terminate the risk by refusing to acept such premium; and no payment of premium should keep a policy on foot unless a receipt for the same in writing should be taken under the hands of two directors or some person duly authorized by the directors, It was contended that the 21 days were days of grace, and that the policy had not ceased to exist at the time of the death of the assured, and that the directors should have given notice before the expiration of the year that they would not renew the policy- and "Salvin v. James," 6 Ewas, was relied on. It was also said that as the directors might have deducted the premium from the sum insured before the 21 days expired, payment of the premium was not necessary. We think that the policy did not give tbe executors a right to continue it after the death of the assured, and that, even if the premium had been ten. dered within the 21 days, the directors would not have been bound to accept it. The second condition also appears decisive and to render the policy void. The cases of " Salvin v. James" and " Tarleton v. Staneforth," therein referred to (Mr. Justice Cresswell here elaborately reviewed these two cases), are authorities for holding that this policy expired on the 22nd of January, 185?6. The result is that the plea is good, and there iS therefore no ground for entering judgment for the plaintiffs, notwithstanding the verdict on the issue joined on the replication to that plea, Judgment for defendants. - SUTrON V. SADLER AND DAVRNPORT. This was an action of ejectment, tried before Baron Bram. weal at the lasb Chester assizes. The only question was as to the competency of the person last seised to make %he will under which the defendant claimed. The leried judge told the jury that the law presumed competency, and that those who impeached the will must prove incompehoy, and that if their minds were quite in doubt upon the point they ought to find for the defendant. A. rale ni. was granted in .taster Term to show cause why a new tral should not be granted, on the ground of misdirection. On the argument in support of the ruling the cases of the "1Attorney-General v. Panther" (3, Brown'sChancery Cases, 441), "Groom v. Thomas" (2, Hagg.'s Ecclesiastical Report, 434) and "Nathan v. Bucks"' (7, Pickerings U. S. Renort; were cited. If a presumption of insanity is raisedweltbe Court)thinkthatthe partywlio setsupawijiand alleges the competency of the testator must prove it. The learned work by Pro essor Greenleaf on evidence, sec. 42 of first volume and sections 689 and 373 were also referred to, as was also a learned chapter on the doctrine of presnmptions in MIr. Starkie's work on evidence. In support of the rale conusel relied on "Barry v. Butler" (2, Moore's Privy Counc lReports ),and"Earwood v. Baaker " (3, lb., 282). In "Wareingv Ware'ing" (6 Moore's Privy Council Reports, 355), Lrd Brougham observes "that the burden of proof often shifts about from one party to the other in the progress of a cause, according as the evidence raises a pre. suption one way or the other. Competency is not a presumption of law, and whenthevvhole evidence onbeth sides is before the jury they ought not to find that the testator vas competent unless they believe it." The result is that the rule for a newv trial must be made absolute, Rule absolute for a new trial. CAHrr AD ANOTnans (ENxuTOns5 Ev.) V?. DAW9SON. This was an action for negligence ln effecting an in surance. There was conflicting evidence as to whether or not the letter of instructions sent by the defendant to Lewis, by whom the insurance was effected, was shown at the time to the broker. There was some difference of opinion in the Court whe'.her the defendant had violated hls duty in effecting an insurance through a third party;but the Court agreed that the correct measure of damages had not been applied, That question could not ho determined without ascertaining whether the letter was properly exhibited. There must therefore bo a new trial. PRule absolute for new trial. smssIONnS V. T.AYLOR. This case, whiclh involved questions of law rzespecting crossed checks, stands over for further consideration. 00MM5 V. iARsiO rr. In this cause, which was an action of dower, an applica- tion had been made by the demandant to inspect the deed| by which the property had been conveyed to her husband, and w^hich was now in the tenant's possession. A rule ,nirt was granted, aLnd the tenant showed cause by making an aflldanit that the lands were purchased by him without notic that they were subject to dower and goo0d consideration. The COURT, after reviewing the authorities, held that, as no discovery could before the Common Law Procedur Act have been obtained in equity, this rule must be discharged with coats. Rule discharged accordingly, 10D1R V. }ERRULE. This was an action to recover damages for the broach of two contracts by delivering tallow of inferior quality to that bargained for. Defendant had paid-2341. into court. wtether tria plitfthe ledarnedjugte dleft it lto the jury to say ance of the contract, and the jury having found in the negative the damages were assessed at a sum exceedin.gthe amount paid into court by less than the difference between the contract price paidby the plaintiff and theprice for which the tallowv waiS resold; leave being reserved to the defendant to move to enter the verdict for him if the Court should think that he had paid in sufficient to cover the damages. The proper measure of damages is the difference between the mAarkeAt vkalue when, the Ac.argo wAas unloaded and the pnrice realized by the resale. This is 5961. 13s., from which, deducting the 2341. paid into court, there remains 3621., to which amount the damages must be reduced. Rulo absolute for reducing the damages to 3621. DUFF V. MIACKENZIE. This was an action on a policy of marine insurance on goods from Catania, in Sicify, to a port in the united kingdom, free from all average. The goods were described as " master's effects." Somo of them wero lost by tho perils of tho sea. The defence was that the loss was only partial, and upon the authority of "Ralli v. Janson" (6 B. and B., 422), the Lord Chief Justice directed a verdict for the defendant, with leave to move to enter it for the plaintiff for 671. 10s. We (the COURT) think this case is distinguishable from that of ' Ralli v. Janson," and that the rule for entering the judgment for the plaintiff must be made absolute. The word " effects" was used to avoid enumerating all the Iarticles, as chronometer, sextant, books, coat, &c., of which tbe effects happened to consist. The true construction of the memorandum is that the insurer was not to be liable for any partial, but was to be liable for any total loss of any of the things mentioned. Rule absolute for entering the verdict for the plaintiff. JONES (ADMNISTRATOR, &C.) V. THE PRONINCLJ LIy INSURANCE COMPANY. The plaintiff is the administrator of John Powel Jones, deceased, and sues on a policy eilected by the intestate for 1.0011. upon his own life wit the defendants in February, 1865. Tne question in the cause was whether the statement made by the deceased at the time the policy was effected as to the state of his health was correct, the fact of his having had bilious attacks not having been mentioned. The statement was that the deceased was not aware of any disorder tending to shorten his life. At the trial lieforeBaron Mfartn it appeared that the deceased had had biious attacks in 1853 ind 1854. The evidence as to the character of these attacks was contradictory. The learned Judge directedthejurytbat if thedeceased honestly beheved that the bilious attacks did not tend to shorten his life, the fact that he had had them would not vitiate the polhiy. A rsle was obtan for a new trial on the ground of miai dilrection. It is clear that the underwriters may limit their Jight.in this respect to thatof being informed by the assured siet .only. vhether * given fact exists, but as to its mateniality. We (the COun) therefore think that the direc. tion of the learned judge was correct, and that tho rule for a newr trial must be discarged. Rule discharged accordingly. (Before Mr. Juwtice WIL.LES and Special Juries at Guiadlau.) GENERAL STEAM NAVIGATION COMPANY V. ROLT. 1r. Serieant Byles, Mr. Knowles, Q.C., Mr. Welsby, and a gentleman of the Chancery bar appeared for the plaintiffs, and Sir Fitzroy Kelly, Mr. Wllde, Q.C., and Mr. Garth for the defendant. This was an action arising out of a contract between the plaintiffn and Mare, the shipbuilder, whereby Mare was to huild a ship for the plaintiffs for a sum of 14,0001., payable by four instalments, the first on the certificate of the surveyor that the frames and certain other work pointed oat should be completed, the second on the plating of the,ship being completed, the third when the vessel was launched, and the faurth when the vessel was complete and delivered. Rolt, the defendant, was surety for Mare, and guaranteed that the ship should be completed and delivered on the 13th of September, 1°55. Mare became bankrupt before the ship was hed, and this action was brought to recover the amount paid by the plaintiffs after Mare's bankruptcy for the completion of the ship, and further damages by reason of the shp not having been completed by the day agreed upon. It appeared that the plaintiffs had advanced moneys to Mare, and that the third instalment and a further sum of 1,000L had been paid to him before the vessel was launched, and a further sm of 2,0001. sabsequently to the launch, and before the ship had been completed; and there was some evidence that the defendant knew that the latter sun had been paid, but not that he knew that it was a prepay. inent. At the conclusion of the plaintifts case, Sir F. K-s.nY submitted, for the defendants, that the plaintiffs ought to be nonsuited, as by these prepayments they had parted ith a security for the completion of the work, an~ had discharged the defendant from liability.

This was an action under Lord Campbell's Act for the benefit of the children of Edward Walker, who had been run over by a waggon of the defendant's and Illed. Walker was a painter and glazier, but not being able to obtain employment at his trade, he worked as a casual labouter at, the St. Katharine's Docks. The labourers assemble of a morning around the gates of the docks, and one of the servants of the company chooses those who are to he employed, and they are therefore all very eager to get near him. un the morning in question there was a crowd of about 600, and the defendant's waggon came towards the crowd, when there was a cry to stop it. It did stop, and then came on again. Again there was a cry of fear, and Walker was caught by the apron, swung round, and thrown down and the wheel ran along his leg, went over his shoulder, and fractured his skull. He was taken to the hospital and died. Edward Craske examined.-I am the plaintiff, brotherin-law of the deceased. The children depend on me now, and didthen. Walker had not at the time of his death the means of supporting them. His eldest son lived with him til the accident. Cioss-examined.-Sta nard father-in-law of Walker, has renounced administration. He is well off-out of business. I am poorly off and have a large family. I instinct the attorney. The children have an uncle, William Stannard, a publican. He is well off. Walker was often out of work 8ix months out of the year. His hands were at one time paralysed. Re-examlned.-During some parts of the year work Is more plentiful in the painting trade than at others.

On the nth of December I was engaged in so doing at No. 8 gate. I sit on a stool2 feet 9 inches high, with three steps. They hold up their tickets.

I have Eeen two carts pass at times while I have been taking them on. *saw a coal waggon coming towards the crowd; it came right through the crowd. I saw the waggon 60 yards off, at the corner of Burr-street, standing stilL When it came on I sung out "A minute or two and Iwill be done." He was very close then. He couid hear me. He did not stop. I could not see the driver. There were two cars on the other side of the way waiting to come in. The crowd tried to disperse; several called out "Hold hard," and some said there was a man under the wheeL I saw the waggon rise as if it had gone over a stone. I went down to pick him up. His head Was shattered. There was room for the waggon to have gone between the edge of the crowd and the other side. ross-examined -That has been'the plan of taking on the men for 30 years I take ticket labourers on first. Ido not take the first men firsb. The pavement is about three or four feet wide. GeneraUy about 200 stand on this side and 200 on the other, and the rest in the middle of the road.

The horse of one was just opposite the gate, but the waggon was'not, and another behind that. Bur-street is on the same side as gt. Katharine's Docks. I did not see laoyd's van come by. I did not hear the carman say anything before he came up to the crowd. Saunders, the policeman, did not make any inquiry of me how this occurred. He may have asked me if I had seen it. I did say to the carman in Saunders's presence that he was to blame. Other witnesses were caUed to corroborate the evidence of Taylor. The case for the defendant was that it was an accident, and had not arisen from the negligence of the cannan ; and a number of witnesses were called, who gave that view of the case MIr.

COURT OF EXCHEQUERi SATURDAY. JTULY 4. _ ITOClEN V. DRESSL-rR. (Sittings at Nisi P,iti, before the CmEF BARoIr and a SPectal Jurv at Gui1dh,l- I six. xovil and Mr. Ranymond were counsel for the plaintiff; M r.I M. Chambers and Mr. Aspland appeared for the defendant. The parties are both seed merchants, and this was an action in which the plaintiff sought first to recover damages on a special count, alleging a sale of cloverseed by sample fendadeetpiv qualitOy in the bulk. To this count the defendnt aid27f.int cort.The plaintiff also sought, by a count for money p aid,sto recover the whole sum paid by himforthesee, 81L s.9d., on the ground that by a custom of the trade he was at liberty to return the bulk, as it did not correspond with the sample, and the defendant had not called in due time to examine the bulk andd sGalmple. This thiscount the defendant pleadd a enia of hs alegedliability, resting on the assertion that the property in the seed had irrevocably passed to the panifwe he received the billof lading from the defendant, andaccepted and paid the bill of exchange drawn on him by the defendant for the price of the seed. The defence on this head also rested on the allegation that the application of the plaintiff to sample was delayed too long. The two questions in the cause, therefore, were whether the defendant was liable to all, and if so whether he was bound to repay the whole of the purchase money and take back the seed, or was only liable to such extent as the defective quality of the bulk compared with the sample would warrant; and if so, then whether the sum paid into court was sufdicient; on which point the plaintiff's witnesses thought the damage was 291. The cause lasted the entire day, and at its conclusion The CMEF BARON stated to the jury that, in his opinion, the plaintiff had failed to support any such custom as that onwhichherested his claim toreject the seedand recoverback thewhole purchasemoney. In hisopinion,the property passed to the plaintiff, and all that was open to him was to claim damages for the defective quality of the bulk when com. pared with the sample, if the objection was taken in time by.him, and the plaintiff had not dealt with the seed so as to preclude him from preferring any claim at all. The JUry retired to consider their verdict, and eventualy returned a verdict for the defendant. SECOND COURT. (S&iing aCt Nisi Prius, at Guildtia, bcfore Mr. Baron MARTnx and Common Ju-ies.) CHIRISTMAS V. ALDR1DGE. Mr. Metcalf was counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Ballantine represenited the defendan'. This -was an action for false imprisonment. The defendant pleaded " Not Guilty," and a justification. It appeared from the evideneo adduced in support of the plaintiff's case that he was a medical student, and that he had been employed by Air. Locke at the last election for Southwark as a paid cauvasser. The defendant, who was a fruiterer and greengrocer, was also employed to canvass, and they went their rounds together for two days. On the afternoon of the second day the defendant suddenly accused the plaintiff of stealing his watch-chain, and gave him into custody. The plaintiff was taken to the Wandsworth polce-station, where the defendant entered the charge. e plaintiff, ater having been locked up all night, was discharged the next morning, as the defendant did not appgear before the magistrate mn support of his charge. The defence was that as the plaintiff and defendant were walking together in the Wandsworth-road the former snatched the defendant's gold watch-guard, and put it into hispDocket. The defendant, who at first thought he was only in joke, asked him to return it to him; and after some time, on his refusal, he gave him into custody for stealing it. fe had not pressed the charge against the plaintiff on accdunt of his family, who were respectable, and who entreated him to let the plaintiffoff. :Witnesses having been called in support of this view of the case, 'The learned counsel kddressed the jury on behalf of their re.fletive clients.

APPALJNG CAPTSTROPHEAT SHREWSBUBY.- TEN PBRSONS DROWNBD.- One of the most calamitoutivents whioh ever occurred in this town took place on Friday night. M. Jullien's antual musical ftle had, in conjunction with the Shropehire Horticultural Society's show, been held during the day on an islet of the Severn, called the "Islnd of Poplars." The river atthis point is about 15o feetwide, and is attheedeepest part abbot nine feet deep. The island on the occasion in questioh was approached by a bridge of boats temporarily erected for the purposo, and constructed of a pontoon, a lighter, a flat bottomed punt, and a barge, planks being laid down over the vessels to a landing-stage and steps. It is computed that not less than 10,000 persons visited the isLand during the day, of whom by far the greater number were women and children, arrangements having been made to admit the Shrewsbury Band of Hope to thefle. The evening entertainments concluded shortly after 10 o'clock with a grand pyrotechnic display, when, just as the last rocket sprang into the air and scattered its blazing particles among the talU poplars, the enormous multitude rushed off to the bridge of boats. Whether this stracture was strong enough to sustain the ordinary weight and pressure of so many persons is not at present ascertained, but unhappily there were found people foolish and wicked enough to Increase the chance of the risk, which to unpro fessional eyes seemed already great enough. It is a fact, although it will hardly be credited, that while the immense multitude were frantically straggling and straining to get over the bridge, several fellows, in a state oi intoxica. tion, cormenced swaying it from side to side, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties of those who en. deavoured to pass on. At this juncture the punt, which formed the central portion of the bridge, capsized and sunk, burying beneath it several persons, while a great muany others-about 150 in all-were precipitated into the shallower parts of the river. The scene that ensued baffles description. The town bank of the river was lined with hundreds of persons, consisting partly of those who had landed in safety, many of whom were separated from their friends, and partly of poorer persons who were unable to visit thef6te, and were watching the Sireworks from that spot. From these, as well as from those who were in the river and on the remaining portion of the bridge, arose the most agonizing shrieks and cries, the darkness of night lend. ing ad itional horror to the scene. After considerable delay and incredible exertions the great bulk of those who had been precipitated into the water were dragged out, some nearly drowned, while many others were suffering from severe contusions, not a few having had their arms and legs broken. The worst, however, remains to be told. As we before stated, several unfortunate persons were crushed beneath the bottom of the punt, and being unable to extricate themselves, in consequence of the pressure above them, they were drowned, upwards of 20 minutes having elapsed, before they could be got out. Ten bodies were recovered during the night, but it is supposed that others remain yet under the punt, as several persons are missing. The bodies so found were taken to a neighbouring inn, most of them being identified next day. Their names were-Edward Joseph Ditcher, a child 2$! years old, and Mary Hamer, his nurse - John and Ann Prive, aged11 and 14 respectively; Mary Cureton, 15; Elizabeth Holder, 22; John Roberts, 17 , Esther Mary Jones, and two others who names are at present unknown. Most of the deceased belonged to Shrews. bury. On Saturday evening an inquest was held at the L6rdon, Apprentice Inn, where the bodies lay, before Mr:H. EKeate, the borough coroner. The proceeaings were merely preli-' minaty, to enable the bodies to be viewed and identified by their respective friends previous to their removal for inter- Went, and the inquest was adJourned till 3 o'lock h-sday, when the inqiry will be conducted inthe grand jUTy-room at the Town.halI Models and drawings of the bridge will be laid before the j ury, so as to enable them to judgfe whether the persons who planned and construceted it are hlanaeable or not. We understand that measures will be taken to arrest, if possible, the brutal wretches wvho caused the catastrophe by rocking the bridge.

ON THE LATE MUTINIES IN INDIA. TO TIM EDITOB, OF TEE TDS. Slr,-AR a gemrXl vole, it is highly inexpedient for b military man to appecl to the publie through the mediumof what is truly styled tho fourth estate of the realm for the re#rss of any grievance, personal or otherwise ; especially' if such appeal involve heavy charges against the oGovernmenef he gerves. I have read with inexpressible grief and indig. nation'g(oer nly not withstorishment) the terrible ant! humilating intelligenco contained in yonr columrns of the revolt of a number of Sepoy regiments in India, Jnd ot the massacre of their officers. Thig, therefore, is no time for an Englishman to bang back who can in any way enlighten the powers that be as to tha causes-of this great national calamity, or suggest a remedy. This, however, requires plain speaking, which involves the certainty of giving offence, and the probability of being flatly eontradicted. I have been upwards of 30 years in the army and have seen as hard servlce as most men, nor has my expe. rience been confined to one of the Indian Presidencies; on the contrary, I have enjoyed and availed myself of opportunities of observing the excellencies and defects of the military systems of the three armies, and of studying the eapabilities and genius of tbe different races of whom they are composed. Passing over the excellendes andXcertain defects peculiar to each, anda triking at once at the root of the matter, I do not hesitate to affirm that the late deplorable transactions must, in a great measure, be attributed to a false general policy, which han for many years been slosly but sarely undermining the discpline of the whole Indian army, some portions of it more than others,-I mean the system of centralization, which, when pushed beyond the bounds of reason anc commaon sense, produces centrifugal effects. ' Of this every authority in India, with the exception of the Supreme Government (itself the supposed concentration of wisdom and administrative power)-from the governors of the minor' presidencies down to the very naiques in the native rankscomplains bitterly.* It necessarily implies distrst of initramentsin itself most disheartening, and it has tanght alI the servants of the Government, civil and military, more particularly the latter, to look beyond their iimmediate superiors, whose authority is thus made void as regards either reward or pmishment. Time has been when there was too much despotism in the army; but now even an officer commanding a regiment has zcarcely as much power as might be judicionsly intrusted ta a sergeant-major. Details as to this suicidal system could easilybe furnished. It has gradually buttcertainlydeprived both the commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the Indiani army, European and native, of the respect of the masses whom they are expected to command, and in whose hands, as has been so terribly shown, the real power lies. A. sense of interest and a sense of fear form the groundwork of respect in common minds; without respect on the one side moral influence on the other cannot exist, and I laugh to scorn and I reprobate with anger the foolish anl dangerous theory that a purely mercenary army (whoset natural uninformed patriotism, whenever it exists, must boarrAyedagainstus) can beturned into a well-oiled machines devoid of al passions and human susceptibilities, and certain to produce, like that of Air. Babbage, fixed results at the will of the director. The history of British India abounds with instances of the beneficial efects of that sort of femdal attachment between sepoys and their officers which owes much of its strength to the conviction of the inferior that his superior is the delegated fountain of honour, and the source whence deserved punishment surely comes; and yet I have heard men among the rulers of India afirm that personal and moral influence on the part of the officer is "undesirable," and that this is one reason why the Government has seda. lously deprived its own delegates and representatives of aSl but the mere shadow of power and authority. IJ it wonderful that regimental officers of every grade should ifer disgust at a system which subjects them to the contempt oE those who are nominally under their command, and at the same time precludes the possibility of their effectually doing theIr own duty! And yet it is upon that class of Her Majesty' gallant and devoted servants that Mr. Mangles, the chairman of the Court of Directors, has lately in a pubic speech dared to cast aspersions, for which Major. Geheral Tucker has well and manfully rebuked him through the influential medium of yonr widely-spread journaL My heart is hot within me when I think that at that very tirie these calumniated officers were pouring out their blood like water in a vain endeavour to arrest the effects of gross adinintrative folly and misgovernment. And the poor ladies I And the innocent children I Well, " Vengeance is inine, I will repay, saith the Lord." I and others have over and over again warned the chief authorities of the coming storm, but we were only looked upon as troublesome personrs- If the religious element now mingles rin the insubordination of the CoSnpany's troops, I conscientiously believe that in tho first instance these misguided men entertkined no fears of a forcible conversion to Christianity. That watchword has been caught up, and used by the more' as=ute and malignant actors in the late fiendish atrocities to delude their credulous comrades, whose nwra&c had already been vitiated by, among other causes, the system I have de. niounced. And, indeed, the affair of the greased cartridges, whieh was the grossest insult that could have been offered to the Mohammedan or Hindoo, was merely the spark to the train already prepared. I do not pretend to enumerate in this letter all the excit. Ing causes of the present deplorable state of affairs. I believe, with other officers of experience, that the causeless lenity exercised towards the 34th Bengal Native Infantry, which, to the best of my recollection, has not for years past evinced a remarkably loyal spirit, encouraged the army in the belief that the connivance of soldiers at the assassination of an officer was not regarded by Government as a deadly crime. This same impression had been conveyed to the minds of the whole Indian army a year previously by the manner in which the Supreme Government, or rather Lord Dalhousie, dealt with an atrocious case of mutiny at Hyderabad in the Deccan, in which Brigadier Cohn Mackenzie was nearly cut to pieces, and several ladies and officers wounded. The regiment of cavalry which mutinied on that occasion was notorious for having been ever ripe for revolt. The late Brigadier Mayne used to express his conviction that it was "a regular powder magazine," and traly it deserved the appellation, as on one occasion the troopers mardered their commandant (a certain famous Major Davis), and on another cut to pieces their Ressaldar, or native colonel. The savage outbreak in question was checked, and the lives of all the Christianinhabitants of the cantonment saved by the prompt gallantryand fidelity of the 3d Regiment of Native Infantry of the Hyderabad Contingent, who rushed to the rescue, and held their own until the arrival of a body of Europeans The facts and details of this case are contained in a narra. tive which I have the pleasure to send; among which yoe will remark, mirabic dictu, that the mutineers were pao. tively let off scot-free, with the exception of a fer dismis. sals, and the limited imprisonment of three of the men who Actually cut down the brigadier, while the brave and loyal Infantry Regiment has never been even thanked bythe Government of India. On the contrary, two of their number, who wereforemost in self-devotion, but whose conduct was misrepresented to the Governor.General, were, to the astonishment and grief of their comrades, tumed out of the service without a pension I These circumstances, so fatal to the character and prestige of the Government, were, by authority, promulgated to the whole army, and pro. voked among the native soldiery much mischievous com. ment. Were Her Majesty's Ministers to avail themselves of the information within their reach, and which they might easily obtain from the namerous experienced officers now at home, I think they would discover, in addition to the palpable mistakes above pointed out, many others calculated to make the sepoy dis. trust thewisdom, if not the good faith, of the Government he serves. This letter is already long enough to awaken in. quiry, if truth be the object earnestly desired. This experieuce has taught me to doubt, so far as those are con cered on wvnom the present awful resnonsibility rests. I do not pretend to be a prophet, but it is beyond question that our enppire in India is now trembling in the balance, and that with out India Great Britain would subside into a third-rate State-a fact altogether new to the majority of members of Parliament, " our rosy foxhunting brothers," who affect to sicken at the name of India. It is quite possible, although I pray that God may avert it, that the next mal may bring still more disastrous tidings than those which have yet reached us. At least 20 British Regiments and as many Artillerymen as can be spared ought to be sent out to India by, if possible, the overland route; and if that be impracticable ronnd the Cape, in the largest steamers that can be procured, even if we are obliged to borrow seaworthy vesselsfrom the Americans. Black regiments from the West Indies and Sierra Leone might surely be raised, and induced to volunteer for serviece in the East. Strong and brave as Europeans, able to endure any degee of heat, and, it properly dealt with, faithful as Hlghlanders to their cliefe, the negroesa between whom and tho rsepoys there could exist no possible bond of union, would prove an excellent stand-by and coon. terpoie in times like these.

'EE IT4LIAI INSURRoCTIo, (FR01 our. OWw CORsoN1xi,vr . Yh ood I f T 1 1TUILIN, J,,.sp 30 'The, good peopie of Trnwere thlu d',rstruck io- day at the report which circulafed of an inaurreQtionary attempt having t.aken place at Genoa during the night before. In the course of the day the oicial journal published the following expla. nation of the afair, 'which contains, I believe, nearly all the facot of the case that have reached the GoveVn1ent up to the present moment *- 1 Several days since the authorities were informed that some persons threatened to disturb public tranquillity in Genoa, and they thorefore made opportune dispositioni to prever t any attempt whatever. ' Hving received positive notice yesterday that an attempt.of some kInd would be made that night, the authorities proceeded the same night to make domiciliary visits and searches, in consequence of which a certain quantity of arms has been seized and about 40 persons were arrested. "An attempt was made to seize the Forts Sperone and Diamante, but, thankato the vigilance of the authorities, tho attempt failed. Near Ronco the telegraph wires were cut. " The city of Genoa Is tranquil, and the authorities are unceasing in the necessary provisions for securing the publio tranquility, which, however, has never been disturbed." To this official account there is little to add in the way of explanation, because little is known with any certainty, either as to the real authors of this ridiculous attempt or to what extent the plot may havareached. Among the persons arrested there are natives of the Romagna and of Marseilles, as well as Genoese, which may or may not be a significant fact, but of course in the existing state of uncertainty it is immediately received as proof of the conspiracy having had ramifications east and west. One thing aprers quite certain even from the few facts already obtained, and that is that the would-be Revolutionists would have done a considerable amount of mischief if it had not been for the activity of the authorities. The attack on the forts by some two or three dozen persons armed with pistols and daggers was probably only part of some general plan for overpowering the guards, which had been frustrated by the previous arrests. The places attacked are small detached forts in the outer line of defence, and at present are only held by a sergeant's guard for each of them detailed from the garrison of the larger forts. At one of them the sergeant in command was killed during the surprisq, but as soon as the alarm was communicated to the other posts reinforcements were imnmediately despatched, and the insurgents were one and all captured, it is said. It is hardly possible to believe, therefore, that even M. Mazzini himself, sanguine as heis in sending other people into the breach, would have counselled an isolated attack of this kind where there was no sort of doubt about the loyalty of the garrison. 1n its sitting yesterday the Chamber of Deputies passed the Bill for the Mont Cenis Tunnel by a majority of 98 votes against 30, to which was added a clause, on the proposal of Deputy Valerio, to authorize the Government to renew the offer of 10,000,000O. towards the construction of a tunnel on the Lucmagno Pass. A letter from Leghorn mentions that the English squadron under Admiral Lord Lyons was in that port, and expected to leave for Spezzia about the 4th of July. JULY 1. In the Chamber of Deputies to-day Count de Revel said:- " Yesterday morning the news spread that in the night of the 29th-30th arrests and domiciliaxry searches had been made at Genoa, as well as an attempt to take the Forts Diamanto and Sperone, where a sergeant of the Savoy Brigade, which is in garrison there, was killed. I did not yesterday make an inquiry, because I wished to wait until the Ministry should have received more information The Chamber has given proof of moderation in all matters where international relations were concerned, but in treating of events that have occurred in the interior it is the duty and the right of the Chamber to demand information of the Ministry, and it onght to be given frankly and clearly. The words employed within theso walls by Deputies or Ministers have far more importance than those printed in a newspaper, whatover may be its official character. I ask the Ministry, therefore, whether the authorities had received warning of some plot ; if they took measures of precaution, not only to repress, but to prevent deeds which, though they were not successful, may be variously interpreted by both friends and enemies of our country. What was the extent of these deeds and the social conditioa of those persons who were arrested ? It is well that these matters should be cleared up, so that the country and foreigners may be able to form a just opinion on them." Signor Rattazzi, Minister of the Interior, replied:- " I recognize both the right of Deputies and the duty of Ministers, and I have no difficulty in meeting the demands of the hon. member. I cannot, however, enter into minute par. ticalas, because the Government has not yet received precise and authentic intelligence, and because, a criminal prosecution against the authors and accomplices having been insti. tuted, there are declarations which might compromise the course of justioe and affect the fate of the arrested. The Government had boon warned that some attempt was abouLt to be made at Genoa in an anarchical republican sense (nCe seneo anaerCdico repuOlicano), and with impulse given, perhaps, by other parties at home and abroad. The Ministry made its dispositions, and gave appropriate instructions to the local authorities in order that they should be on the alert. In consequence of further information, that on the night of the 29th--0th an attempt of some sort would be made, the armed force was warned, and a part of the troops were confined to barracks in order to be ready to prevent or repress. Until midnight nothing occurred; but then it was ascertained that the vires of the telegraph between Turin and Genoa ha4 been broken at Ronco, and then the troops were placed at the disposition of the civil authorities to enable them to ascertain if there were persons in the city who plotted attempts. They found, in fact, various groups gathered for sinister motives; they made arrests and examinations; many were found with daggers and arms. It having become known that an attempt was meditated on 'Fort Sperone, a battalion of Bersaglieri was despatched thither, which surprised and captured a certain number of the ill-disposedl. The authorities of public afety, having been informed of depots of arms, made searches, and sequestrated a quantity of arms and aammunition. There were no other sinister consequences than the lamentable fact of the death of the sergeant in the Diamante fort. Fifty of the evil-disposed united at this fort. The sentinel, surprised perhaps, did not give the alarm. The seditious entered the fort, and the soldiers, too few to resist, were shut up in a room. The sergeant, who probably resisted vas miserably murdered. For the rest, orders have been given that all persons who may appear to have forwarded this crime shaU be arrested, although they may not have been found on the spot. I don't know how these things could have been more effectually prevented. Arrests and porquisitions could not bh made without proofs, and the information of the authorities of public security is not often such as can be produced in a criminal prosecution. nor are the persons wiho give notice- wiling to - appear as witnesses. It was necessary that matters should approach the commencement of crime in order to have proofs. The Ministry cannot be blamed, therefore, for not acting sooner. The Intendente writes that he cannot send the names of the arrested before to-night. I don't think, however, the knowledge of the condition of these persons would change the facts. The names have been denounced to the judicial authorities, and they will be proceeded against. As to the persons not arrested, but who may be compromised, the Deputy De Revel would not wish that I should ran the risk of injuring an innocent person or give warning to one who may be guilty." Count de Revel said he had begun his career at the bar, and knew that it was not right to touch upon pending legal proceedings, but when the Government had received indications of stores of arms and illegal meetings it had the right and it was its duty to make search by the judicial authorities. " I do not ask the names," he said,- " But the ages, the professions, the places of birth, s that it may be knovn who among the citizens of this StateWho among those who come to seek a liberty they have not in their own country, have sought to disturb tranquil. lity. It is desirable that at least the official paper should give this information regarding persons who have made such an extravagant and criminal attempt as never can be equalled in this State." Signor Rattazzi replied " I don't know how searches could be made without sufficient proof. The informations were only enough for the authorities to prevent and repress. I should have no difficulty in giving the names, which will be published in the newspopers. There are among-the prisoners Genoese and cmuir6s. I agree with the Deputy Da Revel that the spirit of our population condemns and deplores greatly such wicked attempts." A letter from Genoa of tho 1st inst., received in Paris, gives some further particulars relative to the revolutionary Itern mad! M that eitv 4n t of the 30th ar .ne. It appears that although the Government had received information that an tffurrectionvqyl movement was in preparation, the authoritf.s were not apprised of the exact time it was to break out. Shortly after midnight of the 29th it was discovered that the electric wires between Genoa and Turia I were cut. The troops in garrison were then ordered i to patrol the streets. Several groups of sinister. looking persons were observed, and numerous arrests were effected. An attempt was made by other parties of the rebels to ¢apture Fort Della Sperone, but they were surprised by a battalion of Rifemen, and the greater number of them were taken prisoners. Information was noxt given to the authorities that A quantity of firearms and other weapons had been collected in the town. A search was made, and they were discovered. The only misfortune to be deplored is the murder of a sergeant in Fort Diamante. Fifty revolutionists at-acked it, and the sentinel, probably, surprised, did not give any alarm, and the insurgents succeeded in entering the fort, where they murdered a sergeant, whoresisted. They were subsequentlycaptured. it is said further that the rebels are not natives of Genoa, and that they received no aid or encouragement from the population. Some of the prisoners declared that they expected a simultaneous movement to have taken place at Carrara, Florence, Bologna, and Naples. The murderer of the sergeant Is identified. The steamship Cagliari sailed from Genoa the same day for Sardinia and Tunis. Thirty persons who were not known at Genoa embarked as passengers, and when the steamer cleared the coast they rose on the officers and compelled the captain to steer for Sicily.

The European and American Company's screw steamer Golden Fleece, Captain John Vine Hall, arrived here this morning at 6 o'clock, with dates from Rio de Janeiro of June 4; Bahia, 10; Pernambuco, 12; and Lisbon, 30. She landed 70 passengers at Lisbon, and brings 17 for Southampton and 18 for Hamburg. Captain W. G. Luard, from Her Majesty's ship Indefatigablo, at Rio, has come home by this vessel. The general health of the Brazilian ports was good. Cases of yellow fever occurred at Rio and Bahia, but Pernambaco was r"ported quite free. Coffee was advancing in price at Rio. We have no further intelligence from this porb. The Baiah Price Current of theOtli states that unimportant sales of coffee for home consumption had been effected during the previous week, exporters keeping out of the market; quotations were nominal at 4,700 to 4,900 reis per arroba. Cocoa continued in brisk demand, and small lots, even of inferior quality, found purchasers at 6,000 to 6,100 reis per arroba. The favourable accounts received per the Southampton steamer had pub a momentary stop to transactions in sugar, selers being unable to make up their minds as to the prices they ought to demand. In cotton no sales had been effected, and prices were nominal. Hides were neglected, and sales difficult at declining prices; the last transactions were at 320 reis per lb. for dry salted, and 360 reis for dryin first hands. RIum continued firm at 1,200 reis per canada. Of bapioca there was still no supply, although prices of mandioca flour had fallen considerably. Stocks of tobacco on band were large, and purchasers refused to come into the market in expectation of lower prices. Freights were dull. In exchange but little bad been effected, and latest quotations were 28d. on London; Paris, 343 to 315; Hamburg, 645 to 650; Lisbon, 94 to 98.

SPAi.d. ' : -, (1som oUiR OWN CORRESPONDItiT.)' IADRID,3 JUNE 29.. On Saturday the ceremoDies ordained iu celelwra. tion of the pregnancy of the Queen were brolliht to a close by her proceeding in State, witlh the King and Court, to the church of Atochia to return thanks for the prospect of progeny, and to pray for a happy delivery. All the pomp of the Spanish Court was exhibited upon the occasion; there were three carriages and eight, ten carriages and six, Kings-at-Arms and dais bearers, led horses ricbly caparisoned, and a'ost of palace officials, Ladies of Honour and Gentlemen of the Chamber. The streets were lined with troops in full dress; military masic was heard on al sides; Royal salutes marked He? Majesty's movements, fired on her departure from the Palace and on her arrival at the church, where the Ministers, the diplomatic corps, and al the great officers of State were assembled. All that authority could obtain was there; but that which would have been worth more than aU the rest, the spontaneous greeting and gratulation by the people of their Sovereign, was utterly wanting. Nobody having iluminated on Wednesdaythe day on which the pregnancy was announcedon Saturday the police sent round verbal orders to the inhabitants to drape their balconies and light up their windows. Nevertheless a great many balconies remained undraped, and the illuminations were few and paltry; and on the Queen's passage the multitude were silent, although here and there a feeble attempt was made to excite them to applause. A geatleman stood on a first floor balcoiny in one of the principal streets, and a5 she passed he cried "' Viva la Reina F' A large group of persJns of the middle and lower classez*as assembledT just opposite, in front of a much-fr.quented cafr. One member of this group responded " Viva! 1" but, it was a solitary echo which nobody toclk up, and the effect of this single voice, lifted up alone among the crowd, was so strange that the group whence it proceeded burst into a scornful laugh. In the church the velvet drapery at the. back of the gallery where the Queen sits caught fire about three quarters of an hour before her arrival, and for a moment there seemed to be a probability of the flames spreading, but they were got under without much damage being done. The effect of the official announcement of the Queen's condition and of the rejoicingsr, it should rather be said, the prescribed and enforced ceremonies consequent on it-has been decidedly bad. The public attention has been thus directed to subjects to which it is unnecessary that I should here more particularly allude, and certain feelingH very strongly testified at the time the pregnancy was first spoken of have been revived. Those feelings are most unfavourable to the two highest personages in the country, and they are expressed with remarkable freedom and bitterness. In the galleries of the Charabers on Wednesday, among the people abroad in the streets, and: even among some of the groups of officers who on Saturday evening awaited in front of their regiments the passage of the Royal procession, the remarks and jokes current were such as to prove beyond a doubt how smaRl is the respect that Royalty in Spain now commands. During the last few days manuscript lampoons, caricatures, and copies of verses-all of the most disrespectful and many of the grossest description-have been passing from hand to hand. One epigram, of only four lines, but as sharp as it is short, has had great success, and is in everybody's mouth. Acopyofverses,verywitty, severe,aud sc3ndalous, representing theMinisters'subserviencyto the favourite of the day, was said to have upset the Lersundi Cabinet in 1853. Possibly the many things of the kind now in circulation may not have that effect on the Narvaez Government; but they certainly bode no good either to it or to the palace. In them are set forth and commented tipon with perfect freedom, and in some instances with abominable license, circumstances whieh here are knoair to everybody, although spoken of but in whispers or in covert allusions. The feeling now abroad reminds me of that shown towards Queen Christina during the first half of 1854, when she was at the very worst of her unpopularity, aud when much more abuse was heaped upon her than she perhaps deserved. This odium and contempt has now found other objects. Another feature of resemblance to 1854 is the appearance of clandestine printed sheets or newspapers. Their appearance is quite recent. I hear of three; the Murcielago, or Bat (there was a secret periodical of the same name in 1854); the Cangrejo, or Crab; and the Buhlu, or Bugbear. While the Opposition (both to the dynasty and the Ministry) resort, iu anticipation of the new law on the press, to this clandestine and not very reputable mode of warfare, the Government, on its part, permits or puts forward paragraphs in the newspapers devoted to it, of a nature to confirm apprehensions which I have mentioned as already existing among the Liberal party. " It is sufficient," said the Parlamento a day or two ago,- " To pay attention to certain symptoms obgervable within the last few days in our political state to know that tile eternal enemies of aU Government which is not excli'sively their own are preparing, more orless craftily, to play some of their tricks." Those against whom this accusation is directedthe Liberal party, that is to say-declare, on their part, that agents of the Government are at work to bring about disturbances, in order that there may be a pretext for imprisonment and Philippinades-._ transportation to the colonies. These instigations, it is said, are to be backed by a cruel measure, to ba taken as soon as the Clortes separate. A number of bakers in Madrid now receive a weekly subsidy from the Government, in return for which they are bound to supply, against tickets, a certain number of loaves to the poor, at a price lower than the exorbitant one at which that first necessity of life has for some time been. This subsidy, it is reported, will be suspended; there will be no more cheap bread, and rebellious demonstrations will thus be provoked among the poor of the capital, who wiU find themselves starving. What is positiveisthat men of the lower classes who have been accustomed to act as agents and subordinate leaders in revolutionary movements of the Liberal party have gone to chiefs of that party-whose names are well known to me, but cannot prudently be mentioned-asking them if anything were going to take place, for that per-. sons had been to them speaking of an approaching insurrectisn and warning them to hold themselvrs in readiness. M'e reply to t6hiis m-uIryFh`a I a I strict injunction to remain quiet, and on no account to let themselves be led into a aemonstration which is intended only as a snare. From all that I have been able to ascertain, my belief is that nothing of the nature of an attempt at revolution is at present contemplated by the opponentsof the present regirme, and that should any disturbance occur this sumurer it will be of a trifing nature and brought about by the police. In a few weeks, however, the new crop, WtlCh accounts from various quarters concur in representing as nearly everywhere good and abundant, wiU be inthe market; bread, which hasmaintained itself, even in anticipation of an approaching fune harvest, at famine prices, must fall, and one great cause of discontent will be removed. Captain Blackwood has arrived from London with despatches for Lord Howden from the Foreignoffice. Lord Eowden has postponed his departure from Madrid. The Spanish papers announce the death at Ceuta of Agostina Zaragoza, the heroine whose share in the defence of the citythe name of which she borelhsbeen recordedin a glowing chapter of &tthey3' History of the Penisular War and immortaLzed by Byron's genius. According to a note to Childe Harold, she was in her 22d year when the siege oGcurred, so that she must have been about '70 at lier death. The Spanish papers merely say that she was veryyoung atthetime of the siege. She held the rank of ensign in the Spanish army, and wore several decorations, the rewarad of her eploits in the War of Independence She was buried at Ceuta with military honours. * This being. St. oeter's-day, is a close holyday (another !), and there is no Senate or Bolsa, but the Lower Chamber has magnanimously assembled for the despatch of business.

RAILWA Y INTELLIGBNC'E. LONDON, BRIGHTON, AND SOIUTH COAST. ,,t- .-I sWUe:uig ox *nls company was beld on Saturday, at the Bridge-house Hotel, to consider certain BiLs now beforeParliamcnt; M1r. L. Schuster in the chair. The CHAIMRAN explained that the meeting was convened in compliance with the standing orders of the House of Lords to consider certain Bills now before Parliament, so far as clauses therein affected the interests of the Brighton Ccmpany. The firmt Bill he had to submit was for supplying a large district now unprovided with railway commtnicut'o. The landlords bad come forward to make the line, and the Brighton Company had agreed to woork it forthem, so rg to yield something like 4 per sont. an the outlay of 50,COOt. The agreement would be for 10 years,- subject to the approval of the shareholders and the Board of Trade. The Solicitor read the heads of " A Bill for maling a Railway from Lewes to Uckfield, all in the county of Sussex," and the clauses affecting tho Brighton Company. A formal resolution approving tbh Bill was carried i ho CHAnnAx said, the nextBill was for authorizing the construction of a railway from theirbbranch line at Horsham to Petworth. The leDgth of the line would be 16B mile; and it would be worked by the Brighton Company. The estemated cost of the line was only about 144,0001., subject to an additional 5,0001. for land The Solicitor read the heads of the Bill, and the clausea therein authorizing working arrangements. On the motion of the CEHARMSA a formal resolution approving the Bill was carried. The next Bill authorized arrangements with the Westend of London and Crystal Palace Company for amalgamation or power to purchase the line. It also enabled the West. end Company to forego the receipt of 4,Wl01. a-sear, being tart of the 8,0001. a-year agreed to be paid by th Brighton ompany as toll for passing over the line to the We3t-eud Company's terminus on consideration of the Brighton Company paying to the West-end Company 80,000. in cash. The object was to enable them to complete the line and the West-end station. Mr. WAwnDsLY, although opposed to everything which had been done in respect of the Crystal Palace traffic, looked favourably upon the proposition connected with the Westend terminus, which he thought would be an advantage to the Brighton Company. The CuAtiRuA, in reply to a question, stated that the West-end line would be completed to Ranelagh-bridge before the end of the year. It was said that a toll wonld be cbarged on that bridge, but he thought it would not be tolerateda as a park for the people would be laid out near the station, and if a toll were demanded on the bridge it would defeat the object of the park. He considered that tolls on bridges were a remnant of barbarous times, and ought to be abolished. They might as well put a toll on passengers and carriages in Cannon-street as on the bridges in and near London. He concluded by moving a formal resolution approving " A Bill for authorizing traffic arrangements between the West-end of London and Crystal Palace, and the London and Brighton and South Coast, the South-Eastern aud the London and South-Western Companies; for sale or lease of the West London and Crystal Palace Railway; for extending the time for completing the aid railway, and for other pur,poses." Hr. Scor seconded the motion, and it was carried unanianously. The Solicitor read the heads of " A Bill for anthorizin the London and South-Western Railway Company and others to make deviations from their authorized lines of railway and other works; and for authorizing divers other matters affecting that company and other compsnies and On the motion of the chairman, who stated that tho only clause affecting them in the Bill was one authorizing the Brighton and the South-Western Company to lease the - Wimbledon and Croydon Railway, a resolution approving the Bill was carried. 3Ir. HERAPATH wished to know whether the SouthWestern Railway Company were working harmoniously with the Brnghton Company with a view to throw out the Wimbledon and Dorking BilL He hoped they would not allow any differenoes, if they existed, to prevent their united opposition to that objectionable scheme. (Hear, hear.) The CHAniwxMA was glad to say that every step had been taken with a view to throw out the BilL It was promoted by the same parties as the Epsom and Latherhead, and other schemes equaly objectionable. The committee of the Houso of Commons had, in his opinion, taken a very erroneous view of the Wimbledon and Dorking BiU and passed it, which was a measure calcnlated to embroil the two companies. He was glad they had a House of Lords to go to, and they hoped to have the cordial assistance of the SouthWesten Railway Company in opposing, and if possible in causing the rejection of the B i, which must be considered as an apple of discord. Hr. EH3RAPATH believed there were practical difficulties in the way of worling the proposed line, which was intended to be a single one, and to cross the South-Western line in an objectionable manner. It was evident the line was intended for sale, or, like other schemes in the present session, to force the South-Western Company to purchase the Portsmouth Railway. The C srmAw thought the mnistake of the House of Commons would be foand out in the House of Lords. The meoting then separated. GREAT WESTERN. The Devizes branch of this company's railway was opened for public traffic on Wednesday. The event was celebrated by a dinner, at which the Mayor presided, and the day was observed as a general holyday in the town of Devizes.
P1UNCRS'S_THEATRE. In our notice of the first performance of the Tcmpest we advertedto the expediency of Bhorteningthose long intervals between the acts, which occasionally came as so many wet blankets, chilling the enthusiasm that would otherwise have been maintained without interruption by the various exhibitiona of poetical thought, snechanical ingenuity, and scenic magnificence that are peculiar to this " revival." Let us hasten therefore to record that the duration of the play has been considerably lessened, and that the Magician, who commands Ceres, Iris, and Juno, has now freed his island from all chances of an invasion bgy orpheus. On the second night of performance it was shortened by full 40 minutes-the time required by Puck to put a rirdle round the earth-and, as the abbreviating process has been further pursued, the curtain may nowbe warranted to descend balf an hour before midnight.

'IIE LATE EAluL OF MoNGTOToN.-OnSaturday Mr. Wakiley held an inquest at the Coachmakers' Arms. Bentinck-street, Manchester-squa respecting the death oE William Pole Tyln Long WellesIo, fourth Earl of Morn- ton, which, as aready stated, took place suddenly on wednesday evening last. Mr. F. N. Cates, solicitor to the late earl, identified the body, and stated that the deceased earl made a will in 1853. Edward King, valet to the deoeased, said that the latter had complained for some days of severe indisposition and pain iin the chest. The deceased dined about 7 o'clock on Wednesday evening; while at dinner he suddenly exclained, " Good God ! whatever ails me ?' and his head dropped on his chest. Dr. Probert, the earl's medical attendant, was sent for, but he was dead in 20 minutes. In answer to questions from the coroner, the witness said the late earl had been very badlv off so far as pecuniary affairs were concerned, and until the last two years had wanted the necessaries of life. Major W. J. Richardson, a friend of the deceased, said he did not consider that he had been lately ia pecuniary want, for his coussn, the Duke of Wellington, allowed him I01. a-week. This was, however, a comparatively small sum for a man who once had lOO,0001.a-year. Mr. J. Proctor,sureeon, of 62, New Cavendish-street, proved having examined the body, and that death had occurred from the rupture of the left ventricle of the heart, causing an extensive flow of blood into the pericardium. The jury returned a verdiet "That the deceased, William Pole Tilney Lon" WeUesley, Earl of Mornington, died from a natural diase" FiRE AT T BAY Tnix TAvEN.-Yestercly maorning, between 2 and 3 o'clock, a fire broke out in the upper part of the premises belonging to Mr. Joseph Dowe;l, t-erme the Bay Tree Tavern, St. Swithin's-lane. The firemen went to work, and had to pass through various rooms and up tha stairs to reach the fire. Mr. Howell, Jun., who was sleepin on the premises, upon being aroused, sacceeded in =an;ing the other inmates, consisting of sixbarmaidsin the upper part of thebuildingandfour in the kitchen, aware of their impending danger, and, owing to the coolness he dilayed in directing them out of the place, they all manageto retreat before the Royal Society's escape time to attend. The police also were of great assstance to the firemen. After the lapse of two or tireo hours the firemen managed to got the flames extinguished, but not until a serious amount of property was destroyed. TRopmES oF THE LATE WAr.-Lord Paunure has acceded to a request made by the Bristol Town Council for a trophy of the late Russian war, and has presented the city wih two 32-pounder guns. Steps are being taken by the municipal authorities for the construction of suitable cariages for the guns, and as oon as these are prepared they will be mounted on Brandon-h311, an eminence commanding the city.
