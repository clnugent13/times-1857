UNIVERSITY INTELIGENUZ. OXFORD.Nov. 24. in a uouvocation held this morning, at 10 o'clock, the, names of the gentlemen nominated to the offioe of SslectiPreachers were submitted and approved The appointment of the Rev. W. C. Lke, ILA., Fellow of BaDliol Colege, to the o&ce of curator of the Taylor Institution, was also confirmed. In a Congregation held at 2 o'clock the statute regulating the Taylor Institution was submitted to the voto of the House. On the first vote, which included the great balk of the statute, there was no division. On the second, which required the Taylorian Professor, if a born British subject, to subseribe the articles, a scrutiny was delcanded, wha the numbers were-placet, 22; non placet, 19. The clauze was accordingly carried. On the third clause, forbidding the teachers to take more than 5s. a term from their upils there was likewise a division, when the clause was thrown. out, there being in favour of It 14 and against it 24 votes The fourth clause, extending to the teachers the sae re uirement which had been passed with regardt theprofessor, was carried by 24 votes against 17 The filth clause establishing four scholarships, was also carred by 27 votesa'gainst 8. In a, Congregation to be holden on Tuesday, the ist of December, at 2 o'clock, a form of statute will be promulgatsd concerning the academical costume of graduates and undergraduates. The principal change Is to give the PreSeDti scholars' gown to commoners, and to mark the scholarsb giving them a strip of velvet on their gowvns from the neelr to the breast. CAMBRIDGE, Nov. 24. The Senate met to-day to consider the report of the Syndicate for conferring certifieates and titles of profidency on candidates not members of the University, which appeared in The Y7mes of Saturday last. The VICE-CaANCELLOR said he had called the meetidg at the suggestion of the Syndicate. A deputation froms Birmingham having waited on him, the oounoUI of the Senate had recommended A Syndicate, and since that time he had received several memorials on the sabject from Shetfield, Chorley, Edgbaston, Northwich, and Gloceater, and one from some gentlemen caUing themselves a middle school committee. The report of the Syndicate was now before them, and It was intended to pat each article to the Senate separately. Mr. C. C. BABLNGTON, of St. John's, asked how the propositions agreed with those of Oxford. The VIcCCEECA;cLLLoP said he believed they corresponded with those of Oxford. The PuBuc ORATOR thought it would be prudent to wait till the first exanmination of Oxford was over, to see how it acted; that had been his opinion as a member of the Syndicate. Besides, he was of opinion it would be better to associate schools rather than persons and he asked permission to read some remarks of a friend, a Fellow of Trint y who had long been conversant with this subject. As to the. term, "candidates not belonging to the University," this was a very vague term: it might include clerks or boys a6t Rugby. Besides, none should be admitted who did not belong to some school. Then what school? Commercial, he thought, would be the right term. As to the ages of the candidates, in the Midland Counties there were few, if any, students above the age of 16. On many accounts the youths should not go to Cambridge for examination. There should be no uniform mode of examima. tion; this would lead to uniform study, and so faU into a. stereotyped system. The subjects should be governed by the law of supply and demand. Dr. DONALDSON, of Trinity, had a decided objectiorn to the scheme. It aimed to confer a title on boys who had received no part of their education at the Unlversity, and theimmediate reason for makdng such a concesdon was, that Oxford bad done so. Oxford baving acted for itself, we might do likewise. Asociate in Arts be objected to, beause. there was no association In the matter. Associate of the Royal Academy was intelligible. He spokewith a knowledge and experience of these matters. He had hinmself for 14 years been in the habit of examining boys, on whose examinations he might be pardoned for looking with -par. tiality, but he never knew one who was entitled fo ah University title. What would be the effect on the University ? Parents of the middle class, when they found theycould obtain A.A. (Associate in Arts), would begin to cona sider how A.A. differed from A.B., and they would balanoe the cost.between the two, and inthese days of imposture and pretenoe, when a name is everything, A.A. would be set up as a title of proficiency and scholarsbip by those who had no claim wbatever. To appoint examiners to examinecehools might be right and proper, bat he would not givetitles. Certificates of merit he id not obiect to. Professor BROWXE said the question was wheter we. should let an opportunity slip of aiding the education oE the middle classes, whose education had hitherto been left to accident. The middle classes were badly educated; theimportance of that class could not be over-rated, and howcould some benefits of the University be extended to them ? Here a means presented itself. The middle classes hd sought us, and shown tbey were sensible of the value of v solid education, and we ought to hesitate before we rejected these overtures. He did not altogether agree with Oxford, but we must act in some way. He thonght the title A.A. an unfortunate one; Oxford had adopted it, and Tye must take it or adopt some other. It would soon be understood, and would not interfere with the degrees of the Urniversity. He hoped there would be no rash rejection. Professor SELWYx represented the feelingsof theminorityof the Syndicate. The title AA. was proposed by Mr. Temple. He would accept the scheme as proposed, but without the title. Mr. ADAM3S, of Pembroke, was opposed to the title, but should give his ssupporttotheproposedschemeapart from it Mr. Porrs wished to extend the benefits of the examination beyond the age of 1S Mr. C. C. BABaIGTON objected. Grayheaded men would then be seekiug the certificate to serve somo purpose which. would never be allowed. The Master of TRLMr=y HALL said, as to the examinations beginniDg at the same time, he thought that ought tobe left to the Syndicate ; and as to the age of the candidates he did not s6e how that was to be determined. The VIcE-CiLtscEZLLoR said it was highly important theexaminations should take place together, as the papers, would probably he printed at Cambridge at the same time besides, it would be impossible to find persons to be examin. ing all the year round. Mr. G. WILL]) AlS, of King's, objected to clanse 4 as it stood-that every candidate should be examined inrellgious knowledge (unless his parents should object). He deeply regretted to see that parenthesis. Elements of religion. ought to form part of education as well as arithmetic; not to require religion would be inconsistent. Religious knowledge ought to form part of education, and he should feel it his duty to object to this clause in the Senate. Mr. PorTs took the same view, and said it was the daty of the University above all things, as a place of sound learn.. ing and religious education, to inculcate true and strict religion, and therefore he entirely agreed with Mr. Williams. Dr. T r.APri-GNGELL said a fallacy seemed to pervade the remarks of Mr. Potts; the proposed scheme was to examine, not to teach, and surely there could be nothing wrong in examining those who were content to submit themselves for that purpose. MIr. CAnnrlON, of Queen's, and Mr. GOODnVD did not agree with Mr. G. Williams. The latter said that, as one of the Syndicate, he should adhere to the clause as expressed. If parents wished for religion they would take care their children had it. The examination would bring the University before the people, and give it a high place in the country, Mr. LA,TISAM, of Trinity Eall, thought the title of A. A. would not benefit the possessor, as the employers would often object to it. As a member of the Syndicate he was opposed to it After a few brief remarks from the PUBLIc ORsiToR anD Professor SELiVwy the meeting broke um.
R APID TRAVxLLISG IN 0ANADA.-Riz Excelleucy the Governor-General, on the arrival of the Indian i pOrt, having expressed a wish to proceed from Quebec to ,outreal, and thence to Toronto, by Grand Trunk Railway, arrangements were immediately made by Mr. Bidder, gene. ral manager of the company, to place at the disposal of his Excellency a special train, to convey him and suite from Quebec to Toronto. The journey, a distance of 5CO miles was performed in 15 hours, but as two hours and a hall must be deductedi for stoppages, including an hour for dlnner at Kingston, the running time is thereby reduced to 12:i hours, making the rate of speed 40 miles an hour for 12 consecutive hours. Such running, being managed on a single line of rails, and without, as we are informed, interfering in any way with the ordinary trains, reflects not only the greatEst crediton the officers generaUy and their edicient mana-gement, but also affords very conclusive proof that the construction of the road must be of fist-rate character to warrant such high speed for a continuous journey of 500 miles. Comparingthis journey of his ExceUency with tbe locomotion of only a few years haek, by which at least a fortnight would have been occupied in the transit between Quebec and Toronto, the provinces have reason to be proud of their great national railroad-" a noble enterprise," as tho Hon. Mr. Cayley has characterized it "so internally blended with the hopes of Canada that lt grc ws with its growth and strengthens with its strength, and is destined yet to achieve the proudest success with theincreasing prosperity of the province." His Excellency wax pleased to express his gratification At the very expeditiouc manner in which the journey had been performed._ Cacnadian Raim7ry Ctide.

On arriving at the junction of the roads from the city and caDtonnnents it seemed very doubtful whetber the rebels would return by the right or left batik of the canal from Aillipore, I therefore sent on Lieutenant Roberts by the main road to feel for the enemy, and t-aptain Hodson, of the Guie:s, to the right bank of the canal. I found the enemy were retiring by the Itobtuck road to Delhi, hut spread all over the country. On crossing the canal a considerable body, with guns, were seen at a village about a mile fromii the bridge, when I at once proceeded to attack them. After a few rounds from their guns, they carried them off in the direction of the city before we could get ulp to them, which tliey were enabled to do, as they were on a road, whereas we had to advance over the open country, which was in many places a swaip, through which our guns and troops could only make their way with much difficulty. A number of the enemy were killed vwho had thrown themselves into tho village on our front ; the rest flIed in every direction. The cavalry of the Guides followed themo with the greatest spirit, and succeeded in cutting up somuo more of the enemy. It was useless to attempt any furtherpursuit, for the heat was great, and the European soldiers exhausted ; I there. fore returned to the banks of the canal, and allowed the men to rest under the shade of the trees. While I was bringing the infantry back, the artillery, by some misconception, returned to camp. During the time we were resting under the trees on the canal the enemy h ad coUected their forces, and, coming up under cover of the canal, made an attack on the infantry. We beat them back and pursued them for a considerable distance, but, seeing that there was a larger force ollecting behind them, I withdrew the infantry and took up a position that commanded the bridge, and, as I expected they were binging up guns, I sent into camp for artilery. Before the guns arrived, however, the enemy made a second attack, and were beaten back with considerable loss. Soon after the artilery and cavalry came up and followed the enemy, who again dispersed and fled in all directions, I left the guns and ca valry at the canal bridge, and brought back the infantry to camp, where we arrived about 4 o'clock. There were about 100 of the enemy killed in these attacks. Enclosed is a return of our loss, which was very smal.

Major-General Reed having been recommended by his uiedical advisers to avail bimself of a sick certificate to repair to the hills, as the orly chance of recovering his sbattered healtb, - hich has latterly prevented him from taking an active purt in the 6eld operations, has made overI the command and charge of this force to Brigadier-General A. Wilson.' It is with the greatest reluctance the Major-General has come to the determnination to take this step, but his duty to bis country must be paramount to any selfish consideration, and, being incapacitated himself for the post by disease and weakness, he ha. no alternative than to devolve his arduous duties upon another. Of Brigadier-GeneralWilson's merits it is unnecessary for major-General Reed to speak; his judgment, gallantry. and conduct have been conspicuous since he led his small but victorious band from Mfeerut up to this day. It enly remains forthe M&jor-General to congratulate the forces bef ore Delbi on being placed under so able a commander as Brigadier-General WlSon. Major-General Reed takes this opportunity of requesting the head-quarters and divisional staff to accept his thank-i Sor the great amsistaDce received by him and by his lamented p.r- decessor, Major-General Sir H. Barnard, K.C.B, not only in the exercise of their departmental duties, but also In the operations in the field.

The Major-General's warmest thanks are due to the wbole artillery of the force, who have on all occasions behaved with conspicuous gallantry, and have ever maintained the reputation of their distinguisbed corps. To Lieut.-CoL Baird Smith and the Engineer department, Major-General Reed offers his most sincere acknowledgments for the valuable services they have rendered. To Lieut.-Col. Thomson, Deputy Commissary-General and his assistants; to Superintending Surgeon Tritton and all the officers of the medical department, the Major-General's best thanks are due for their indefatigable and successful exertions. To Brigadiers Grant, Longfield, Jones, and Showers, and to the gallant officers and troops, European and Native, under their orders, the Mfajor-General begs to award his tribute of admiration for their brilliant and distinguished conduct in a succession of attacls in which the enemy have on every occasion been repulsed. The behaviour of the troops has been beyond all praise. Major-General Reed eannot forbear from recording the name of Major Reed, as having commanded the post which has been subject to the most frequent and constant attacks of the enemy, from which they have always been driven with great loss by the able dispositions of that officer, so admirably seconded by the troops under his command, comprising parties of Her Majesty's 60th Ro3al Rifles, and other corps with the gallant Simoor Battalion and Corps of Guides. In conclusion, the Major-General desires to express his tbanks to the officers of his personal Staff for the uniform assistance he has received from them upon every occasion, and be only regrets he has not had more frequent opportunities of witnessing their distinguished conduct in the field; to Captains Lowe, Reed. and Turubull, Aides-de-Camp; to Assistant-Surgeon W.

GENEERAL VAN CORTLANDT, COSlthANDliNG TH1E BnUT- TEANA IRREGULARA FORCB, To COLONEL MACPHER* SON, MILIT1ARY SECRETARY TO THE GReEN Cosnias- SIONER, PUNJABs. Sirsaha, July 4. Sir,-With reference to my demi-official letter of thel9th of June, I have now the bonour to report, for the information of the Chief Commissioner, that ou the morning of that day I marched from Sohoowalla, sn route for Sirsah. 2, When within a short distance of the village of Rbyracka, through which the road runs, each portion formingl a separate intrenched village, my suspicions of an attack were aroused by a large number of cattle being driven down on my line of march, so great that it was -with d1ifculty the road could be kept clear. I immediately threw out cavalry skirmishers to the front and both flanks, and obtained intelligence that the village of Khyracka abovenamed, and the vilage of Saharun on the left, both of which are situated on the bank of the dry bed of the Guggur river, were both strongly occupied by the Bhuttee rebels. 3 I accordingly detached the Sowars of the Mounted Police, under Lieutenant Pearse, to the left, to prevent that portion of the enemy which occupied the village of Saharun from entering and reinforcing the village of Khyracka, and formed my small force in order of battle as follows .- Jowahir Singh's troops, underLientenant Sadlier,on the left; my two guns, under Lieutenant Walcott, in the centre and the new levies, under Captain Bloomfield, with Lieutenant Hunt, as second In command, on the rliht; with about 20 Irregular Horse entertained by me on the extreme right, and the baggage In the rear. Jowahir Singh's force v.as thus facing that portion of the village of Khyracka on the loft of the road, my two guns were so placed as to kreep the a oad clear and prevent the enemy going from one portion to the other; the new levies were opposite the ripht portion of the village, while the few Irregular Horse were ready to cut off any of the enemy attempting to escape across the low bed of Guggur river to the village of Mirpore on the furtber hank. 4. Khyracka, like all villages in this part of the country, vs very strong, each portion being surrounded by a deep diteh, with a strong embankment, and having but one gateway. 5. Having made the disposition of my force as above deFcribed, I advanced on the village. When about 350 yards from it the enemy opened fire upon me with their matchlocks from under cover of their embankmients. I then directed Lieutenant Sadliertotake half Jowahir Singh's force and enter the extreme left of the left portion of the village, and Lieutenant HEunt, with a company of the new levies, to attack in a like nanner the right flank of that on the right. Botb officers carried out my instructions with the most praiseworthy zeal and ability. 6. The main body advanced simultaneously with those detached, a portion of Jowabir Singh's troops and the new levies protecting thL guns, and the remainder, under Captain Bloomfield, advancing directly on the portions of the village to which they were respectively opposed. 7, The embankments of both villages were taken possession of at once, the enemy, though fighting bravely, being driven back into the villages ; they fought from house to house, and fired from every available cover, and in many instanCeS our men had to remove the roofs of the houses to enable them to get at those of the enemy who were firing onus from tbeinterlor. Some of the houses, too, were fired to drive them out. Twice the men from the left vllage made a rush into that on the right, and were fired Into with canister from the artillery under Lieutenant Walcott with good effect, several being killed. 8. There was a good deal of hand-to-band hard fighting, but after the lapse of albout two hours from the first shot being fired we had gained possession of both portions of the village. Only nine men managed to escape over the village embankment towards Ftbe village of Mirpore; thesewere ivimmediately pursued by the Irregular Cavalry on the right, fire Ikilled and four taken prisoners 9. When both officers and men behaved alike as well and bravely, it is difficult to specify the services of any particalarly; suffice It to say of the officers that they fully realized the expectations I had formed of them in selecting them, and that Captain Robertson, superintendent of Sirsah, who was with me throughout the day, assisted me both with his advice, which his long residence here rendered particularly valuable, and by carrying instruCtions during the engagement, i_lO. JowP,bir Singh's Dogras behaved most admirably, and to three of them, who most partioularly distinguished themselves by acts of bravery, I gave rewards of 20 rupees each, while the spirit and dash of the new levies would have done credit to the mnost experienced troops. 11. Not a man of the rebels escaped ; about 250 were killed, and 18, all of whom were wounded, madeprisoners. 1 12. My own loss, consideringtbe position, waa gh eonsisting of 6 killed anid 33 wounded, 13. I burnt tbe village on the right, and encamped on the left of the left village, facing Sabarun, so as toattend to my wounded, and, if necessary, attack that village, and others which Ideutenant Pearse had been watching. 14. Subsequent to the engagement I found that between 2,000 and 3,000 men of the surrounding villages had collected, and were coming on the village of Khyracka. These arrangements were, however, disconcerted by the want of success of their use of drivlng cattle in our way, which they thought we -would have plundered, and by the alacrity of our subsequent movements and the promptltude with which the villages were gained, notwithtaun 'g the obstinate resistance offered by their picked men. 15. The moral effeot of their complete destruction was great; the lurnberdars of all the surrounding villages came in, and the villagers vied with each other in bringing water and supplies for the force. 16. In conclusion, I beg to recommend for favourable consideration of Government that pensions should be granted to the families of those men who have fallen, who, thoueh but newly raised and quite undisciplined, fell fighting liravely for the Government whose service they had but just entered. I have, &c, W. VAN CORTLAiDT, Ge(neral Commanding Bhutteana Irregular Force. No. 12. MAJOR-GENERAL LLOYD TO THE DEPuTY ADJUTANT. GENXRAL OF THE AmIY. Dinapore, Aug. 1. Sir,-In continuation of the postscript to my despatch of the 27thb ult. I have the honour to zvwzptk for the informa- tirn of his Excellency the Acting Coromander-in-Chief, as follous, in conbexion .with the expedition then saated to be in the course of preparation for moving to Arrah, in vle;f to dispersing the mutineers there assembled, as also to recning the Buropean comunt.nity hemmed in by them. 2. Unfortunately, the Horungotta steamer, conveying the d.-tsobhents of thlu 37rhFoot(previously reported as having i,etn ordered upon the afternoon of the 27th inst. to land tbe men and a party of 50 sick within 10 miles of Arrah,for the purpose of effectiDg the above object), grounded aftec three hours' steaming, without any prospect of getting off, nMless by a riee of the water, which frustrated the firstf rnued plan. 3. On the evening of the 28th the steamer Bombay arrived off the station on her downward passage, when it was determined to send up on her and flat attached 250 man and the head-quarters 10th Foot, to be joined by the 37th Detachznent and Sikhs, on the Horungotta, which was afloat; the united detachment afterwards proceeded up the river to the point and for the purpose already indicated, recent information having been obtained that the European r sidents still hold out. Part of thia plan, however, was neressarily abandoned, in consequence of the commander of the Bombay, when the timeofembarcaticn(morning of 28th) arrived, objecting to tugging both flats ; and as means were thus wanting for sending up more than 150 men of the 10bb, the detachment wasreduced to that number, and Captain Dunbar detailed to command it. This officcr, as serior, eventually assumed command of the entire party* destined for Arrab. 4. The steamer took the flat in tow, according to arrangement above mentioned, and arrived in good time off the place of debarcation. The accompanying report, dated the 31st ult., by Captain Harrison, the senior surviving officer of the party, will put his Excellency in possession of the very untoward events which attended the subsequent progress of the expedition. 5.

CAFrTAIN HARRISON TO THE ASISTAT-ADJUTANT- G&NERAr, DINAPORE. Dinapore, July 3L Sir, -It is with much concern that I have to report, for the information of the Major-General commanding Division, on the following occurrence connected with the expedition to Arrah for the purpose of relieving the Europea inhabitants at that station. At 3 o'clock p.m. of the 29th inst. the steamer carrying detachments as per margint arrived off the point of debarcation, about three miles from the mainland. The party of Sikhs were detached, and shortly afterwards reached the shore for the purpose of seizing boats to enable the detachments to pass over. On arriving there, under the command of Lieutenant Lngilby, 7th Native Infantry, the party were fired upon by some of the rebels posted on the spot to prevent the seizure of the bosts by us. These, however, we landed, after some shots were fired in our direction, and after about three hours and a-half the passage was accomplished. Having formed, the detachments commenced their march towards Arrah at 7 o'clock p.m., and, with the exception of a few sbots being fired at the Sikhs thrown out on our flanks, we reached without opposition a bridge distant from Arrahabout one mile and a-half. This was the place where I had represented to Captain Dunbartheexpeditecy of halting until daylight; to which he replied he bad heard from the magistrate of the improbability of our meeting with any opposition; he thought It was preferable to push on. After advancing from the bridge about half.au-hour, we were assailed from the embankment of a wood on the right of the road by a large body of the rebels firing abotLt 30 yaTds distance on the flank of the column, which at once did revere execution, and was followed up by a continued running fire that caused great destruction among ofricers and men. Here I believe Captain Dunbar fell. The men endeavoured to gain shelter on the other side of the road, but, it being quite dark, they feU down a steep em. bankment (abotxt six feet) and many men lost their firelocks. After straggling some distance the officers succeeded in re-forming the men in a field some 400 yards from the ambuEcade, and took up aposition for the night(it was then about midnight and very dark) in a field adjoining, which seemued to afford some protection. Here we remained antil daylight, the rebels keeping up a fire during the night on our position. We then commenced our retreat towards the steamer, 12 miles distant. In consequence of the men of both regiments having fasted such a long time they were too exhausted and tired to act as skirmishers. However, our rear guard and files on the flanks frequently kept up a fire unti aU their ammunition was expended, by which time we arrived at the bank of the river. We were compeUed to march in column, the rebels pursuing us in large bodies the whole distance to the ghauts both on flank and rear , but their fire visibly slackened the last two miles. The rebels, it was supposed, were running short of ammunition and wished to reserve it. On our airiving at the ghauts, notwithstanding the efforts of the officers, the men made a rush to the boats; immediately upon which the rebels advanced upon us, and commenceda heavy fire of musketry and two guns upon the boats. which were forsaken by the boatmen. This caused great loss, and fired one of the boats. The remnants of the detachment gained the steamer, which I Immediately ordered to Dinapore to gain assistance for the wounded. The loss we inflicted on the rebels I believe to be small, on account of the darkness, and the men being too exhausted to fire. The people of the country turned out against us. I have, kc., R. P. HARRISON, Captain, Comumanding detachment of Hler Majesty's 37th Regiment. No. 14. LIEUTENA2NT WALLER TO THE AsSISTANT-ADJUTAJNT GENERAL, DINAPORE. Dinapore, July 31. Sir,-I have the honour to report, for the information of the Major.General commanding the station, that, hearing cn the evening of the 29th that a party of Her Majesty's 10th Regiment was ordered to proceed to Arrah, I volunteered to accompany them. We started from here at day. light on the 30th in the steamer-, and proceeded up the 7iver to where the flat attacbed to the Government steamer Horungotta was, and took her in tow, with a party of Her Majesty's 37th Regwent and 50 Sikhs of Captatn Rattery's police corps on card, the steamer Horungotta being aground. We then proceeded to Beharee-Ghaut and anchored. Lieutenant Ingilby. 7th Native Infantry, then gave me conmmand of the 50 Sikhs; Ensign Anderson, 22d Native Infantry, and Ensign Venour, of my own regiment, volunteeing to do duty with me. Lieutenant Ingilby then proceeded with 15 moni, Sikhs of the 7th and 8th Native Infantry, whom he had taken from here with him, to a nullab about two miles off, for the purpose of seizing the boats to cross the detachment. About 20 minutes after Lieutenant Ingilby had left I heard shots In the direction of the nullah, and immediately started with moy 50 men; hut when I got up to the place the firing had stopped, except a few shots which were fired to stop a boat that was sailing up the river, although desired to stop. Lieutenant Ingilby then crossed the nullah with his 15 men, leaving me on the other side. I then sent off one of my men to Captain Dunbar, to tell him we needed no assistance, hoping I should be in time to prevent his coming with his detachment, who were cookiag when I left, but they had got about halt way before my messenger reached them. Upon the arrival of the 10th and 37th Regiments at the nullah the order was given to cross, which took up a long time, as the current of the river was very strong, and the boats large and heavy; we had finished crossing by 6 o'clock p.m., and then commenced our march ; except tbat the road was dreadfully uneven and very distressing to the feet, we had no difficulties of any kind; it was a moonlight night, and the only arsued men we saw from the time we left the steamer until our arrival at Arrah were the few men who fired at Lieutenant Ingilby, and who were left (so the villagers said) by Baboo ,Koowar Sing, to give him news as soen as we arrived, which showed, with what occurred afterwards, that they were well aware of the party having been sent against them. We arrived in Arrab about 1 o'clock (it vas then quite dark, as the moon had gone down), and wore procedin qucl thru the outaskirts of the town ln the followingoraer:-tetnneIglya hr ayaedo the column with his 15men; thenEerMajesty'slous, followed by my Sikhs ; and Her Majesty's 37th brought up the roar -when, in passing by a large tope of mango trees, which Lieutenant Ingilby had passed without seeing or hearing anything, we received a most dradfully severe fire, which I heard killed a good number of our men, who, not being prepared, and the fire being so heavy and so very close to us, ran off the road into the fields on the other side, and thence commenced firing on the tope. I lost on the road the native officer, a first-rate fellow, who was shot close to me, and also some men, but how many I do not know, as we did not go near the place again. The men wvre dreadfully scattered, and there was great difficulty in collecting them; some did not join us till the next day, and others were dropoing in all night. We then retreatod to another road, and - lay down behind a small " bund," which rose along both sides of the road facing the tones in which the rebels were, and which afforded a capital shelter from the fire, which was kept up at short intervals a4l night. It was after retreating to this bund that Ensign Anderson was killed; poor fellow! he was shot dead through the heart. We remained here during the whole night, and at daylight started back for the stea,ner, a distance of about 13 mles. We were followed in large numbers by the rebels; the main body would not come within rauge, bht they sent out a great number of Sepoys (picked shots I fancy) right and left, who took advantage of every tree and inequality of the ground the whole way, and kept up, without the least cessation, a moet severe fire on our column the whole march-nearly all, or a *llthFoot-3 officers, 150 men. 37th Poot-7 officerN 190 men.

When we arrived at the nullah we found a number of l)r-ge boats on this side, into which the men immediately ruahed, and commenced trying to shove the boats across; but most of them were aground, and the others were so large that the men could not manage them, and all the boatmen had been driven away by the Sepoys. Every time a man showed himself outside a boat he was fired at from ihe village, which was close by ; and at last the men gave up altogether the idea of getting c-ross in boats, and, taking ont all their clothes, those that coutld swam across. Upon getting dowvn to the nullah Ensign Venour and I gotinto a boat with some of the mten, and while I was SOvin ou the boat we tried with a rifle to shoot sonie of the fellows who were making a mark of me. He knocked over one, hut, unfortunately, got shot himself immediately after tbrough the thigh, and `dropped, I tied up his leg as well as I could, and, getting some more help, I succeeded in ge-tting tho boat off; but the fire was so hot, as they saw a chance of our getting away from them, that I and four men left the boat and swam asbore, being fired at the whole way across. Eneign Venour also left the boat a short time afterwards, and, although wounded managed to swim ashore. The fxre from the village the :wiole time was most severe, kiling and wounding a great number. After those who could swim got away the Se ya first opened a moat severe fire on the few who remainedin the beats that were aground, and, after wounding most of the men in them, they al rushed down and set fire to the roof. It was here that poor Lieutenant Ingilby was killedl, and a great number of wounded, who had been carried so fa~r, were obliged to be left.

Attcking In front with the rest of my foroe, I drove the enemy out of the town and across the narrow causeway and bridge, with great slaughter, and returned to this position at night. Not a soldier or armed villager on the enemy's side dared to follow me. The insurgents had eight or ten guns beyond the causeway; two on this side of it. Two of those beyondwere 24pounders. The whole were kept at such a distance, and withdrawn so rapidly, that -we never got a fair sight of them. None, therefore, fel into our hands but two on the walls, which had been captured on the 29th ult., and dismantled by the commandant of artillery, so imperfectly, however, that the enemy again fired out of them. I estimate the loss of the enemy at 300 kiled and wounded; mine was 25. The enemy will not, I fear, again venture to fight with a narrow causeway and swamp in his rear.

Sir,-Be pleased to inform the Commallder-in-Chief that I was yesterday prepared to cross over to Cawnpore by the bridges and lat equipage which Lieutenant-Colonel Tytler and Captain Crommelin have established ; but I had determined that if there should be any considerable assemblage of hostile troops in my front I would not await their attack in this strong position, but take the initiative, and strile a blow against them. In the course of the day a succession of spiea brought me information of about 4,000 men, with some guns, having come forward from Nawabgtnge to Busherutgunge. I at once put my force in motion, although its baggage and spare asomunition, additional doolies, &c., were alady on the right bank. My advanced guard pushed the enemy's parties out of Onao, where my force bivouacked under trees. Marching nt dawn, it found him for the third time prepared to defend Bnsherutgtnge, and thus came on our eighth combat since the 12th of Julv. The insurgents were about 4,000 In number, with six field guns. They had varied their mode of defence by intrenching the village of Boorbeeakeehowkee, in advance of Busberut. My superior artilery fire would soon have crus'ed them, but I could only slowly bring my batteries and echeUloned troops across the wide and deep morasses which protected their front; meanwhile their shot and shell caused some loss in my ranks, but when these obstacles were passed success was speedily achieved. The Highlanders, without firing a shot, precipitated themselves with a c eer upon the principal redoubt, and captured two out of the three horse-battery guns with which it was armed. The Fusileers at the same time drove the enemy's extreme leftbefore them, and their whole line w- e speedily in full I estimate their loss at 300 killed and wounded; my own was 35. I retraced my steps leisurely to this position. A body of troops under Munsoob Alee, a rebellious Talookdar, made an effort to interrupt our progress by a demonstration on our right fhank, bat were compeUed to retreat by our artiUlery fire. This action bas inspired much terror among the enemy, and I trust will prevent his effectually opposing our embarcation at Cawnpore, which is a diffloult operation. I have, &c., H.

The report speaks for itself ; but I cannot refrain from bringing to the notice of Major-General Gowan, with aview to the same being submitted to his Excellency the Commander.in Chief, and through him to the Supreme Government, the admiration with which I, as well as the whole force, have viewed the gallantry with which thls noble officer, with the gallant band under him, has held the important post intrusted to his command. With the aid of Her Majesty's 60th Royal Rifles, his own regiment, the Sirmore Battalion, assisted by reliefs from the Guide Corps of Infantry, the 4th Sikh Regiment, and the 1st Punjab Infantry, this officer has from the 8th of June, the date of the arrival of this force at Delhi, sustained and defeated 24 separate attacks upon his position up to the 6th inst.; and from that date to the present constant worrying attacks day and night, by both infantry and artillery. I have no words to express my admiration of the endurance and gallantry displayed throughout this long period by Major Reid and the offEoers and men who have served under him; but I now thus briefly record my opion of their merins in the certain hope that Major-General Gowan, C.B., wll reeommend them to higher authority for the greatest lionours that can be bestowed upon them.

MAJOR REIM TO THE DEruTY ASSISTAN\T ADJUrun- GENERA OF THE ARaiY. Main Picket, IHindoo Rao's House, Aug. 4. Sir,-I have the honour to report, for the information of the Brigadier-General eommanding the forces, that about 4 30 p.m. on the Ist inst. I observed, from my look-out on the top of this house, that mutineers were turning out of the Ajmere and Toorkman-gates in considerable force; they assembled on tho open plain in front of the above.-mentioned gates, but as they did not move off I took but little notice of them beyond directing my look-out man to watch all their movements; onlooking tomyrightrear,Iperceivedthewhole oftbe force which had moved out ofthe cityonthe31stnlt., returning over the ridge (Kolapahar) and by the Rohtnck road with all the gans they had taken out-viz., six Horse Artillery guns, four 9-pounder guns, and three heavy mortars, with the whole of their camp equipage, &c., and elephants and camels. This force halted about a mile from the Edgha Serai, and a little before sunset was joinedby the mutineers from the city. For some little time I was doubtful as to their intentions, but as the sun went down about 5,00O or 6,000 infantry came down, with six light guns, through the Kissengunge and Pahareeporee buildings, taking advantage of the cover as they advanced. The Sammy-house was attacked, and here I had 100 of Major Coke's Reginient, and 50 Guides, the picket under command of Captain Travers (who, I much regret to say, was mortally wounded during the night, and is since dead). I sent orders to him to encourage the enemy to approach, and not to fire until his men were sure of their aim. Shortly after this I heard a rattle of musketry from the breastwork on the right of the Sammy-house, as also from the enclosure, and the enemy then opened with their light guns on the crow's nest, the breastwork, and our right flank batteries. It became necessary about 7 o'clock to send reinforcements to the Sammy-hoase, so I accordingly directed Lieutenant M'Gil, with his company (60th Rifles), which had come up In support, to proceed to the hreastwork on the right, while [ sent Captain Derby, with 50 men of the 61st Foot, to the enclosure. Repeated attacks were made throughout the night, and at one time the enemy came up vithin 20 paces of the Sammyhouse in very considerable force, but, as on all former occasions was driven back with, I should say, very great loss; but, owing to the cover they had, they were able to remove their dead without being seen; 127 bodies have, however, been since counted between the bresatwork and the Tobewalsh Bazaar. A little before daybreak on the 2d fresh troops were brought up, and another attack was made on the Sammyhouse and breastwork, on which I directed a company of the 60th Rifles, under the command of Captain Sir E. Campbell, to aid in driving the enemy back. A large force attempted to turn the right, and get round to the Subzee Mundee tent; in order te do this they had to cross the road, and the ground which has now been cleared of all jungle; as soon as they had got on to the roadwwith a body of cavalry which came up from the Edgha, I ordered the officer commanding the light gun battery to give them three rounds of grape, while our light mortars played on them from the crow's nest ; they 9lew back to their cover on the left of the road immediately, and did not again show in any About 10 nam. the enemy commenced moving off In the direction of the city, but it was not until 4 p.m. that I had the satisfaction of seeing them in full retreat with their guns. I cannot speak too highly of the coolness of the troops under my command throughout the night; there was no noise whatever-no hurry or confusion; and my warmest thanks are due to aU for their gaUantry and daring. This report would have been furnished before, but may Iduties at this picket would not admit of it. A retar of our loss has already been furnished; I am happy to say it was slight in comparison withL that of the enemy. IIhave, &c., C. REID. No. 27. MAJOR REID TO B1RIGADKR.-GrNEtRAL WIL-SON.

Sir,-I have to request the favour of your informing the Coromander.in.Chiet that I marched to this place yesterday. The matineers of the 31st and 42d, from Saugor, the 17th, from Fyzabad, and Sepoys of other regiments, with troops of the 2d Light Cavalry and 3d Irregnlars, united to a portion of Nana Sahib's troops, were, with two guns, in one of the strongest positions I have ever seen; they numbered 4,000 men. The plain, densely covered with thicket, and flanked by villages, has two streams flowing through It, not foriable by troops of any arm, and only to be crossed by two narrow bridges, the furthest of which was protected by an intrenchment armed with artiUlery. The road takes a turn after passing the second bridge, which protects the defenders from direct firet; and behind are the narrow streets and brick houses of Bithoor. I must do the mutineers the justlce to pronounce that theyfoughtobstinately; otherwseetheycould not fora whole hour have held their own, even with such advantages of ground, against my powerful artillery fire The streams prevented my turning them, and my troops were received, in assaulting the position, by a heavy rife and musketry fire from the rifle and battalion companies engaged; but, after a severe struggle, the enemy were driven back, their guns captured, and infantry chased off the field in fuiU retreat towards Seorajpore. Had I possessed cavalry not a rebel or mutineer could have reached that place alive; as it is, they sball not long remain there unmolested. The lose of the enemy is estimated at 250 killed and wounded; mine ie 49, and my nuubers are further reduced by sunstroke and cholera. I enclose a sketch of the poeition, returns of killed aud wounded, and captured ordnance. I have, &c-, H. HAVELOCK, Brigadier-General, Commanding Altahabad Moveable Colusan. No. 29.

THE ENGLISH ENGINEEMS IMPItISONED AT NALES. -A very large meeting, composed principally of the artisans from the extensive engine factories of the town, was held in the Lecture-room, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on Monday evening, to petition Parliament to adopt active rmeasures for the release of the two English engineers who had been seized on board the Cagliari, Neapolitan steamer, anad were now confined by the police of Naples in the prison of Salerno. The Mayor, Mr. Nichol, -was in the chair. Sir John Fife moved the following resolution:-"Tkat it is the opion of this meeting that the Imprisonment of the two nglish engineers, Messrs. Watt and Parks, by the Neapolitan Government, and the refusal of that Government to allow the English consul at Naples or any of their friends to communicate with them, is an insult to the British nation, and requires the prompt and vlgorous Interposition of the British Government." The resolution was seconded by Mr. Joseph Cowen, jun., and was unanimously agreed to. Other resolutions of a similar character were passed, and a petition to Parliament was also adopted. The followlig letter from the Foreignoffice, on the part of Lord Clarendon, in answer to a memorial presented by Mr. Ridley, M.P., from the work. men of Messrs. Stephenson and Co., engine builders, was read to the meeting:-"Foreign-office, Nov. 16. -Sir, I am directed by the Earl of Clarendon to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th inst. enclosing a memorial numerously signed by workmen in the employ of Messrs. R. Stephenson anQ Co., relative to the case of the engineer Henry Watt and I am directed to state to you, in reply to the memo. rialists, that Watt is amenable to the law of Naples, as it appears that he was taken prisoner, being at the time in company with other persons who were attempting to excite a revolution, and that tbe acting Consul at Naples, under in. structions from this office, has retained the best lawyers to be had in Naples for his defence. Lord Clarendon has instructed the acting Consul to demand that he sball be allowed to see Watt and the other engineer named Park who is confined with him, and that no unnecessary delay shall take place in proceeding with their trial. And his Lordship has also taken measures for enabling Mr. Park, senior, to see his son if he is willing to proceed to Salerno for that purpose. AudI am to request that you will assure the memorialists that no effort on the part of Her Majesty's Government shaU be omitted which can properly be taken on behalf of Watt and his unfortunate fellow prisoner Park." The meeting, which was very orderly, broke up aboat 10 'clock. FATAL DOILER EXPLOSION.-The Yorkshire papers record the occurrence of a fearful boiler explosion near Skipton last week. The accident happened at a place called Lowver Marchup, about midway between Addingham and Silsden, and at a distance of about five miles fromn Skipton. At this place several shafts have been sunk to form a tunnel in continuance of the conduit which supplies the Bradford waterworks. A number of men were engaged in sinking one of the shafts at Marchup Beck. At the top of the aperture a one-horse gin and the agricultural high-pressure engine were being used, the former to draw up the earth and mud, and the latter the water. The steam-engine was working up to within an hour of the accident, and was standing for a brief period to enable a workman to replace a 'spear' in the machine, when an explosion suddenly took place with a loud noise, wcattering death and destruction around, A youth named Charles Ingleby, aged 15, who was in charge of the engine, was kiled on the spot, as were also a man named James Wilkinson, aged 30, and his child, aged 18 months. Wilkinson was employed on the night abt, and was watching the repairs of the engine with his child in his ams mwhen the explosion took place. Both were quite dead and severely scalded and mutilated; the infant was carried away some distance from its father, and had a piece of iron in its thigh and body; tle clogs of' the child and the man were torn into splinters from thefr feet. A man named Robert Richardson, aged 47, a miner, had one of his feet cut and torn; another miner, named Enoch Moore, age 46, had his back severely lacerated and his thighbone shookingly fractured to the knee; a third miner, named Willam Newsome. aged 36, had his legs slightly bruised; and a man named Michael M'Evoy, driver of the gin-horse was, with the animal, crushed under the machine, but not dangerously injured. A person named Moor was blown down the shaft into the water, and had to be removed to the Bradford infirmary. The steamnengine and boiler were separated from each other, and the wvheel and working parts were blown in pieces 100 yards from the spot,-the boiler, with one end out, being driven about 100 yards in the opposite direction. An inquest wa«s held on the bodies of thse persons killed, and the iury returned the followFing verdiCt:-" Killed by the bursting of a stzeam.boiler, but how the accident WAs caused there is no evidence to show, "

ZONDON, WRBDNESDAY, XfOVRMEBBiR 25, 1857. A speech at an agricultural meetin-g has always a kind of freshness for the distant reader. We all of us possess a faculty of association by which we call up a train of ideas essentially distinct, but united in our minds by some habit or recollection-some real or fancied analogy. The proceedings at an agricultural assembly we associate -with all that is rural, with open countenances, vigorous forms, and cheerful voices ; with the bracing country air, whether it be clear and frosty, or charged with its native English mist; -with the trees showing their bare brauches, and the wind driving along its eddies of rattling leaves. Something, too, more than this rises to our fancy. We figure to ourselves a class of men above the storms of fortune and almost dissociated from the pursuit of gain, who unite the highest education, the most refined culture, and the most extensive travel with a love of rural life, busmiess, and amusements, who return continually from brilliant capitals, from the spots where art and science especially display their achievements, to their own acres and the pursuits of the most, primitive of industries. Country life in England ought, we naturally imagine, to present the ideal of physical and moral well-being, of solid comfort and refined sociality. We have a climnte eminently suited to promote health and longevity; the warm Atlantic alleviates the rigour of winter; no high mountains send cutting blasts from their snowy sides, no deep valleys breed goitres and idiocy among the children of the soil. Our social 0sytem has given to each district a gentleman conversant with aU that is most civilized in life, and a clergyman who, educated among the laity, has received preparation far more useful than can be afforded by any priestly seminary. What, then, is the result to the great mass who live by the sweat of their brow-who plough, and sow, and reap, and dig throughout this old, proud, aristocratic land? We know how the system acts for the few-we know what sort of men make up England's nobility, and gentry, and clergy; but can we truly say we are aware whether the peasantry is better or worse off than of yore,-whether the gradual concentration of property, which is an economical necessity, wil raise their condition, or whether they are to be envied or pitied by the population of less rich and magnificent countries ? We have primary reason to believe that in aU these respects we have the superiority, or else to what purpose serves this elaborate social machinery, this radiation of thought and culture to the remotest corners of the land by means of resident landlords, active clergymen, well-informed professional and commercial men, who seek as often as they can the repose of a country life ? But we aU of us have our misgivings, and a speech like that of Mr. BERusFORD HoPz at Maidatone, treating of the state of the labourer, has an interest which insures attention. Mr. HoPE would be sure to speak with feeling. The political and religious school to which he is said to belong has not much in common with the old Tory landlord arrogance. Its members may be -arrow in their views and sympathies, vain of scholastic distinctions which more able men forget, and of a fastidiousness which the world thinks somewhat allied to imbecility; but they are earnest and charitable, and the agricultural poor, the type. of confiding and obedient ignorance, have always been their especial favourites. Mr. HoPr speaks of agricultural meetings and the rewards they bestow with modesty and delicacy. Little, indeed, can be urged in favour of some of these gifts, but the prizes given for ploughing or rickmaking may certainly be justified, on the ground that it is well to gather together once a-year the people of a district, to " give them one gala "day-one opportunity of seeing what their neigh"bours can do ;" to encourage them by " little "graceful rewards," while taking care not to exaggerate the value of them. But the speaker might well turn from this comparatively trivial subject to a question of real importance. What is the condition of the labourer, and how can it be elevated? The beauty of rural innocence, the blessings of rtral content, have no place in the imagination of any thinking man of the present day. Whatever evils may attend the growth of towns, they seem to be rivalled wherever a country population is left to vegetate uncared for and uncontrolled. Two great foes oppose in all cases the wellbeing of the people-dirt and ignorance. The second can never be dispelled unless the former has been removed. So, when Mr. HOPE dwells on the necessity of education, he does not forget to recommend an attention to physical comfort. The cottage must keep pace with the schoolhouse, or else the work that is done by the instructor will be undone by more powerful influences at home. Education is, indeed, made up o' many things; every discovery or process which is set in action tends to educate those who come withiu its sphere. Everything which can awaken or stimulate the intellect, which can impart new desires or call up new emotions, may be said to help the education of, the peasant. The facilities for travelling are a familiar instance. Perhaps the most important piece of instruction which the labourer has received in our time is that the railway train which whirls past will carry him for half-acrown to a place where he may weave, or spin, or forge in a great city, and that the placard on the village wall tells of ships that will carry him to a new world, where he may be himself a landlord, and give away coats and money to any whom he may find willing to receive them. The post, the newspaper, the telegraph, all are educators, and as soon as the boy has learnt to read and write they take their place among the influences which may draw him upward into something better than his father was before him. But opposed to these are the influences for evil. We will not merely term them obstacles to good, for they are something too living and vigorous to be rightly represented by a word expressing mere passiveness. Chief among these are the squalor of material life. At the bottom of all that tends to degradation is no doubt to be found the want of a decent dwelling. Many a time has this truth been stated and received with the acquiescence which is too often a sign that no practical eforts will follow. We have advocated the improvement of town dwellings as a necessary introduction to preaching or teaching, and the same thing holds good in the country. Nay, the agricultural labourer is even more dependent on those above him than the artisan, since the latter may find a better lodging within a few hundred yards, while the peasant must live in such a tenement as the owner of the property has provided. Now, reports and returns made by commissions of all sorts-not to mention common fame-have informed us what was the state of the cottages throughout the greater part of England some few years since. The frightful immorality wlhich prevailed was the necessary consequence of a system by which the labourer and his whole family wereaccustomed to occupy, perhaps, one small room ; and not only were all the moral principles of the poor destroyed, but crowding and foul air engendered maladieswhichwe should hardly associate with the notion of a country life. Scrofula and its kindred diseases were as rife in healthy villages as in the lowest dens of London. For generations these thinas have tended to deteriorate and demoralize the labourer. They must still exercise their baneful effect, and struggle with unceasing pertinacity against the efforts of the educator. In fact, school tuition is only a help by which the influences for good may be made in a ew cuases to overbalance the influences for evil. Teach the poor without raising their physical condition, and a few energetic spirits will grasp the rope held out to them and rise from the slouglh, but the mass will remain the same. WVe cordlially agree 'With Mr. HoPr in thus calling the attention of landlords to what must be the basis of any scheme for improving the labourer. Those who have built good cottages have, we are persuaded, done far more for the country districts than the advocates of the most elaborate plans of education. Comfort and cleanliness will soon produce their fruit in the practice of decency and the desire of knowledge.
We publish in another column the Oxford Examination Papers for pupils from the middle class schools. This, as our readers may remember, is a recent fruit of academical legislation. It has been observed for a long time that while the upper classes and the higher part of the middle classes have capital schools of their own, and -while the poorest classes have suitable schools provided for them, a large, perhaps the largest, section of the middle classes is still at a great disadvantage in the matter of education. The schools of this large and flourishing part of our population-a class, though not wealthy, comfortably off, and growing in number and power every day-have not been at all equal to the wants anid aims of the class. The middle class schools-to use the technical name for them-have been the very worst specimens /7f schools in the country; left entirely to chance, and often even hardly rezpectable, mranagement; intrusted to any persons who set themselves up in this line-men who in nine ca,es out of ten had no testimonials but their own professions, and who very often took only to the schoolmaster's life when they had failed in every other attempt to earn a livelihood, so that, in fact, their want of capacity to manage any other business was their only proof of their capacity to conduct this particular one. The truth is that, though active, ilourishing, and intelligent, this class had not literally time to look after the business of education. Though a flourishing class, it was still a rising and a struggling one, lifting up its head with some Idifficulty above pressure, and absorbed in the -work of securing its own footing, making good present ground, and taking advantage of any means to better it. Such people as these have no time to enter into the depths of the subject of education, or even to examine very accuI rately the claims of those who set up schools. The fact is, too, that they know less about education than about any other subject; their shrewdness and capacity are in another line, are connected with basiness and trade. The result is that a very shrewd class has been certainly grossly imposed on in the particular matter of education, and has had much worse schools and schoolmasters than it ought to have had for its money. It has been the dupe of puffs and advertisements and loud pretences. This has been observed, we say, for a long time, but it was only lately that a move was made to improve nliddle class education, and that the University of Oxford, at the suggestion, we believe, of MIr. TEmPLn, now Read Master of Rugby, instituted a new examination for the pupils of these schools, the design of which was to raise and better the sEchools by giving them a standard to aim at and distinctions to gain. The schoolmaster is thus reached by the medium of the pupil. The success of his pupils atthese examinations will be an advertisement to his school,-indeed, the very best advertisement he can have; such success, therefore, will be an important object to him, and therefore a powerful stimulus to awaken his energies as a teacher, and set him to work to improve and raise his school system. The experiment is an application, then, of the rule of helping others to help themselves. Here is a large class vwhich has but very indifferent schools. How are you to improve its schools? Are you to set up other new schools for them, schools of your planning and constructing, with your own schoolmasters to conduct them? This would be one way of improving middle class education, but it would be an enormously expensive way, considering the large scale on which it would have to be carried out. The pecuniary risk, at least, involved in the vast original outlay necessary to set such a scheme going would be enormous-so great, in fact, as to set aside the consideration of it as a practicable scheme. But, besides the expense, there is another obstacle which would certainly tell upon the success of such a plan. The class whose benefit is now sought is, however shrewd and inteliigent, not without its narrownesses. It is a suspicious class-suspicious, and not unnaturally so, of foreign dictation, not liking to have its schools, any more than its shops, farms, or workplaces, assigned to it by authority, or what loolks like authority. This kind of suspicion it is difficult to analyze and explain; it belongs to all sets, all bodies of people, whom one bond or another, that of blood or nation, or one common level in society, unites and assimilates. Peoplelike their institutions to spring up naturally among themselves, and to be the growth of the body; they prefer much worse institutions of their own creating to much better ones of yours. It may be, too, that they are in some respects better judges than you are of what is better and what is worse for them. They know their wants to a certain extent better than you do; they are guided by an iustinct in the matter of which you who dictate to them from an eminence have not the advantage. At any rate, this is their feeling-they " shy" at the benevolent institutions for their benefit which are the pure creations of another class; they have no particular reason to give why, they cannot point to anything they actually disapprove, but they still keep at a distance and eye the gift with suspicion. They do not like venturing upon a strange thing, they cannot feel at home with it, and they have all those inexplicable reasons for not liking it that the epigrammatist had for not liking Dr. FELL. With aU its faults, whatever they may be, they know the native institution,-they do not Inow the foreign one, the one which is artificiaUy engrafted upon the old stock, the one made for them. Under these circumstances, the experiment just set going at Oxford seems well adapted for the purpose in view. There is no attempt made to supersedce the schools already set up by this class for itself, and now in operation; but, these schools going oni, an attempt is made to bring them within the improving and stimuLhting influence of a higher standard, and of definite distinctions and honours, involved in a general examination, to !which all the pupils of these schools may offer themselves. It is thought, not unreasonably, that such an arena for competition between these schools will have the effect of gradually elevating all of them, and that an improvement wiUl thus be raised upon the natural stock and old material. It is an assistance to middle class education to improve itself. The motives-that of emulation on the part of the pupils, and that of desire for success on the part of the masters-are already supplied by nature, and have only to be elicited by proper machinery. The University supplies this machinery in the shape of an examination, examiners, certificates, and honours. The improvement aimed at may thus be looked forward to the more confidently because it will be gradual and spontaneous, resulting from the elicited energies of the present schoolmasters and from an improvement in their character suggested to the class by the superiority of those particular schoolmasters which this examination will bring out and make public. The parents wil see hat schools succeed, and the success of particular schools wiU naturally raise the standard of al, for parents will not be content with a lower means of instruction when they know of higher. It is the tendency to produce this ?iaturalc demand for better schools which constitutes the merit of the present plan, and will-if it bas that result-constitute its SUccess.
The Mormonites conceive themselves to be the true representatives of the ancient patriarchs and Old Testament Saints. A-BRAHAIm and DAVID had concubines, and they have concubines. There was a temple at Jerusalem, and there is a temple at Nauvoo. The Jewrs had their sacred writings, and so have they. They do not, however, profess to be successors of the ancient Patriarchs so much as new and improved editions of them. The law carme first, then the Gospel, and no:W the law has come again. The Patriarchs died and 'were buried, but they reappear again, and enjoy a glorious metempsychosis in the persons of BnTGHA-M YoPNo and the Elder3 of Utah. This is a second and more glorious edition of the old law, and, as being a republication it is ushered in with the evidence of miracles and with a neow sacred volume. The AMormonite Bible is a coarse and atupid copy of the English version. of

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (A portion of the following appeared in our second edl' tion ofVPeqtrla _ - (3mOM 0flR OvwT A flNI PARIS, UONDAY, Nov. 23, 6 P.m. The CoJurnier die Bas Rhin,, of Straaburg, asserts positively, in spite of the repeated contradictions which have been given, that the English Government has resolved to raise a foreign legion for the East Indies. It even adds that one of the principal recruiting offices iB to be established at Strasburg on the 1st of December, under the orders of Colonel Hudson, assisted by Major Cafe, Captain Wilkinson, (paymaster), Captain Herring (deputy-paymaster), and Captain Wendt, who is to have the charge of the clothing department. Two of the officers, Major Cafe and Captain Wilkinson, are, says the Oouri-ier, known in Strasburg, from having been there for some time when the Anglo-Swiss Legion was raized. How far the Co,urrier d u Bas Rhin is correct I am unaware, but it is certain that applications on the part of Frenchmen to enlist for service in India have been made at Marseiles, and, within the last few days, in Paris. A gentleman from the former city mentions that he has personally known of several applicants there, and that some of them went by mistake to oile of the foreign consuls' offices instead of the English. Whether it be a delusion or not on the part of these persons, it is certain that they have presented themselves at the houses of British subjects, asking information as to where they could enlist. Trade and manufactures, which indeed had been languishing since the month of July, do not appear to be particularly affected by the crisis which has produced such ruinous results elsewhere. The cause I have alluded to already; the manufacturers generally limited their operations, and were extremely cautiouis in their dealings, and this lucky timidity will probably prove the cause of comparative safety. They have not their warehouses overstocked with goods not yet paid for; they have no formidable engagements to meet, and they may, without the fear of ruin, wait for better times. This state of things is said to be general, but it is not, I believe, uiiversal. There are exceptions; some who have been more enterprising or less prudent tban their fellows will be driven to great sacrifices in order to provide against demands which are inevitable. Several of the latter have already sold their produce at a reduction of from 20 to 30 per cent., while their neighbours, who had no heavy engagements to meet, are resolved to struggle on, and keep their stocks on hand, rather than make such abatements. The last accounts published by the Bank of France show that the demand for money is not as urgent among the commercial classes ia Paris as elsewhere, the commercial bills presented for discount showing a considerable decline; still the feeling is one of uneasiness, and every one inquires how long the present state of things will last. Among the shopkeepers the complaints are not so general as during the previous week. The demand for articles of winter clothing is now much brisker, but the receipts are much under the average of the season. It is to this slackness of trade that in all probability we must attribute the little preparation for the sale of etrennes, or New Year's gifts, on so extensive a scale as formerly. The upward movement in the price of corn which followed the appearance of the Imperial decree permitting its exportation has not been of long duralion. The few buyers who presented themselves at the last Paris marketvwanted areductionof 2f. per sck onflour. The demand was resisted, and prices remained nominal at from 46f. to 53f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes, according to quality. The sworn factors declared on Saturday 4,318 sacks of first quality, and 7,678 sacks for bakers' use. Wheat of the finest quality from the Beauce was quoted at 31f. the 150 kilogrammes; oats, 27f.; barley, 19f. the 100 kilogrammes; rye, 18f. thell5 kilogrammes. The Minister of War has advertised to receive proposals for the delivery in Paris of 12,000 metrical quintals of wheat previous to the 1st of January next, the wheat to weigh 77 kilogrammes the hectolitre. There were 30 tenders submitted, which were all rejected by the Minister, with the exception of one presented by M. Vincent for 600 quintals, of which 300 are at 23f. 99c. the quintal, and 30)) at 24., and one by M. Salis for 500 quintals at 24f. After the wheat, tenders were accepted foor the supply of 4,000 quintals of oats at 21f. 79c., 2,000 quintals of hay at llf. 30c., 1,000 quintals of lucerne at 10f., 12,000 quintals of straw at 4f. 75c. Four tenders were submitted last week for supplying the charitable establislhments in Paris with butchers' meat, but were rejected. The first tender was from M. Dauloz, at If. 8c. the kilogramme; the second from M. Daix, at If. lie. ; the third from M. Leroy, at If. 12c. ; and the fourth from M. Maitre, at If. Ile. Accounts from Lyons state that the price of raw silk has faUen in that market from if. to 5f. the kilogramme, according to quality. The silk markets in the Dr6me and the Ardcehe are described as unusualy heavy. Half the spinning mills are closed. Raw silk of the best quality was offered at 75f. the kilogramme. The stock of cocoons at Marseilles arrived from Italy and the Levant is estimated at 300,000 kilogramnies. The price of wine has slightly declined at the market of Bercy. Financial difficulties have induced some wine growers to abate their demands. Nevertheless, it appears that the wines of last year are nearly exhausted, and it is feared that the late vintage, though abundant, wiU not be sufficient for the deniand. There is no business doing in brandies, and the price is merely nominaaL A meetin. of distillers took place to-day at the Great Room in the Rue Richelieu, with the object, as it appears, of addressing a memoriai to the Government to raise the import duty on foreign spirituous liquors, on the ground that they find themselves unable to compete with foreigners. The GoverDnlent, I believe, are not much pleased with this. It enables one to judge of the progress made in political economy by the manufacturing classes of France. The city of Rouen, the centre of Gothic ignorance or pre judice in these matters, will rejoice. A deputation of the distilers of the Nord have just had an interview with M. Rouher, Mvlinister of Commerce. Thiey were informed that the Government had already instituited an inquiry into all the departments in which the distillation of spirits is carried ou, and that it wjis the result of that inquiry which would guide the Government as to-the measures best calculated to protect the interests of that branch of induistry. The distillers, it Is said, are anxious to have an additional import duty imposed onforeign spirits.

Omar Pasha is to start to-day for his command at Bagdad. A Turkish man-of-war has been put at his disposal, which will carry him and his family to the coast of Syria. The post of Governor-General in Bagdad is the last which remains of the old pashalics into which the Turkish empire was anciently divided. Owing to its distance, and to the unsettled natLre of Turkish rule in that quarter, the new regulations have been but imperfectly introduced, and Bagdad has hitherto almost entirelyescapedthe system of centralization. Even the separation of military and civil power, which forms, as it were, the keystone of the new organization, has never been applied to this outlying region. The Governor is Mushir, or MArshal of the army of Bagdad, as well as Governor-Goier&l of the province,-in fact, a kind of Satrap, ruling almost independently. * It is sogrcely necessary to mention that during the succeesion of critical periods through which the Turkish empire had to pass since the end of the last century such a far off province has been necessarily neglected. Separated by the Desert from Syria and by Eurdistan from Asia Minor, the Turkish rule was always more or less uncertain there, especially since the Persian wars have ceased. While these lasted Mosul ancd Bagdad were the two points for concentrating the military forces, and by the presence of them jTurkish supremacy was maintained. Internal disturbances, Russian wars, and Mehemet Ali's occupation of Syria, soon left no time to think either of Perslan wars or of the pashalic of Bagdad, and it is only a wonder that in the confusion the whole country on the Tigris did not escape from Turkish doniinion. But if Turkish supremacy was not upset it was, at any rate, considerably curtailed. Not only did the Persians seize the opportunity offered by the weakness of the Turkish Government in those troublous times to encroach on the frontier line and possess themselves of the passes of the Suleymaii6h range and of the most convenient positions on the Shatt-ul-Arab, but the different nomad and half-settled Arab tribes of the Muntifiks, Shamars, and Anezis graduaUy extended their sway in al directions; so that, with the exception of some central points, Turkish rule became more nominal than real. The contributions levied by the Arab tribes and the gradual destraction of the great dikes on the Euphrates soon converted the greater part of Mesopotamia into a swampy desert, and the few inhabitanuts who remained on the banks of the two rivers dragged on a wretched existence, taxed in turn by Turks and Arabs. Even now there are parts where at harvest two tenths of the crops are regularly set aside for the two masters, who come one after another to take their share. Thus one of the most fertile countries of Asia became by degrees desolate and abandoned, the revenues decreased steadUy, and the country became depopulated. The Turkish Governors, in order to supply this deficiency, pressed so much the harder on the remaining inhabitants, introducing heavy and vexatious taxes and destroying all native Industry. When the new provincial division was Introduced the wholo length of country from Kurdistan to the Persian Gulf was divided into two provinces, Mosul and Bagdad, and it -was found that the revenues of the latter, comprising more than 500 miles in length and about one-third of that in average breadth, had sunk down to 38,000 purses, or about 150,0001. sterling, which did not even cover the expenses of administration. There waa, indeed, every year a small sum sent up to the capital, but, as the expenses of the army were not paid by the Governor, that amount was several times returned again by the central Government. In the new military divisions there figured an army of Bagdad, which, like the others, was to have been 30,000 men strong; but it existed only on paper, and the neighbouring provinces of Urfah and Diarbekir had to supply the troops required for the province. This state of things lasted until the late GovernorGeneral, Mehmed Redschid, was named for Bagdad about five years ago. Through his energy and administrative talents a new era began for Bagdad. Following its centralizing tendency, the Turkish Government diminished the territory of the province abmost by one-third, taking away the northern part bordering on Mosul and constituting it into a separate pashalic of Shehrizur; and yet, in spite of this dlminution,the revenues,which before had amounted for both only to 150,0001. a-year, increased in the province of Bagdad alone to more than double that during Mehmed Redschid's administration. Moreover, this increase took place without any additional taxation; on the contrary, he began by abolishing a number of vexatious taxes, which were so many hindrances to production and industry, and kept only those which were legal. Thus, for instance, one of the chief productions, silk, was taxed over and over again. There were Government dyeing houses which had the monopoly. The consequence of this oppressive monopoly was that most of the raw silk was exported into Persia, dyed there, and woven: so that the province of Bagdad, which had formerly supplied all that part of Persia with its tissues, had to import for its own consumption. The silk manufacturers had thus been ruined as well as the production of silk. The late Governor abolished this monopoly ; he had the dyeing houses puUed down and at the present moment Bagdad suffices not only for its own wants, but exports into Persia. Another subject to which his energy was turned was to get back by degrees the lands which the Arabs had appropriated to themselves, and his negotiations, supported as they were by a timely display of armed forces, were in most cases successful. He enforced the payment of tribute from the neighbouring settled tribes, and made them thus acknowledge the supremacy of the Sultan. Be had at his own expense the dikes onthe Euphrates repa3red, first up toIHilleh and then even to Hitt, and what was formerly a swamp has now become a fertile 'bdistrict, with a daily increasing population. It was he who maybe said to have laid the foundation for an army at Bagdad. He undertook to pay all the troops required for the defence of his territory himself, and was successful enough to be able to move a division to the Persian frontiers just in time to decide the Shah to give up the idea of a Ruasian alliance during the late war, which was all but signed, and to declare his neutrality in the contest, It is to such a predecessor that Omar Pasha is succeeding. I need not say that five years were not enough to repair the evils of years, nay, centuries, and plenty is left for him to do yet. Mehraed Redschid Pasha,with his limited means, and with no power over Mosul and Shehrizur, was unable to check the incursions of the Arabs on the higher part of the Euphrates. In the firman given to Omar Pasha this is remedied, and the two abovenamed provinces made subordinate to the authority of the Governor of Bagdad in all matters relating to the defence of the whole line from the depredations of the Arabs. In order to be able to do something more efrectual in this respect Omar Pasha has obtained permission, at his request, to take two battalions of riflemen with him which figured so creditably during the late war, as well as a regiment of Cuirassiers, lately created and mounted on European horses, bought from the French and English armies. They have left already and are to meet him at Damascus. Omar Pasha has a great advantage: he takes a name with him known in Kurdistan as well as among the Arabs by his expeditions in Syria. This 1prestige cannot fail to have a salutary effect on the nomad tribes whom he has to keep in order. If he succeeds in protecting the Euphrates line from them he wiU render a service to his adopted country of which he may be prouder than of any of his military triumphs. You have heard of the attempt on the life of Prince Kara Georgevitch of Servia by a shorter way, and of the Judicial measures taken against the accused; seventeen of them have been condemned, among them six senators. The Porte when it heard of this condemnation sent orders to suspend the oxecution of the senators. It is thought that the Prince of Servia has overstepped his power. According to the firman of the 24th of December, 1838, which forms the organic law of the principality of Servia, the Prlnce has, indleed, power of life and death over his subjects, but article 16 says that he has no power of deposing senators without the ratification of the Porte ; and the inference drawn from this is thathe has so much the less right of proceeding to a summary judgment of senators without referring to the Porte. It may be objected, on the other side, that this exception In favour of senators cannot apply to cases In which they may fall under a criminal sentence. It may be expected that just at this moment, when the Porte is so sensitive about its right of suzerainty, the Turks will hold out in their opinion, in which case the condemned would stand a good chance of getting off, at any rate, with their lives. There seems now no doubt that the first impression which has been prevalent-namely, that the attempt comes from Montenegro-was a wrong one, as the inquiry has shown that it is in connexion with the ex-Prince of Servia, Milosch Obrenovitch, and that it had nothing whatever to do with a South Slavonic movement, as was thought. It was simply a family concern between the ex-Prince and the reigning one. AUSTRIA. (FrOM oun owN aoRFSPolODENT.) VINNA, Nov. 21. The Vienna P2esse of yesterday contained an ar- ticle entitled II The English Alliance," which merits particular notlce, inasmuch as it is a direct reply to A leader bearing the aame title whlv .pp= I, the 043mrekissche Zeitwng of.the 17th inDt. The writer in the Presse, after speaking warmly in favour of an alliance between England, Pramia, Austria, and Germany, moat emphaticaUy denies that England is a more meddling Power than France. " Was it an English statesman," says the Austrian pub. Ilidst, "who brought a Propagndist progranme before the Paris Conference on the 14th of April, 1856? Was it England who demanded a modification of the Belgian laws relative to the press ? Did she first propose to meddle in the internal affairs of Italy, and to estblish a new vouman State ? Did England take the initiative in the naval demonstration against Naples ? Did she support the policy of Russla in the Danubian Principalities, aud permit her Minister to imitate Menschikoff at Constantinople? Did England endeavour to obtrude her intervention in the Neuchftel question; and has she ever attempted to play the part of Protector of Europe? Is England the Power which Is always on the look-out for a diplomatic question of which to make a matter of European importance? Is It the British Government which is so desirous to drag the Holstein affir before the Paris Conference ?" The foregoing spirited defence of England has produced the greater impresion here, because the attack on her in the Oesterreichische Zeitung was made by a foreigner, whose pen, long employed against Russia, is now believed to be at her service. The Military Gazette says, the reduction of the army will be a saving to the State of 10,000,000fl. per annum, but the exact amount is not publicly known, for two military men of the highest rank a few hours since disputed in my presence on the suL5ject. The one spoke of 25,000,000fL, the other of but seven or eight. Each infantry, engineer, and artillery company will dismiss 25 men; each squadron of Cuirassiers and Dragoons 30, and each squadron of Hussars and Lancers 40 men. Some few failures have occurred here during the last two or three days, but, on the whole, things are improving National Loan has risen to 84, and Credit Bank Shares to 198. HAMBURG. (PROM OUR OWN CORF 5PONDET.) HAMBURG. Nov. 22. Since the despatch of my yesterday's letter, in which I gave a summary of the current events in relation to the crisis here, some further authenticated cases of suspension of payment by firms in this city have been reported. Among these are the houses of Messrs. Blass and Schomburgh, and M Eoosen, jun., both of them extensively connected-the former as general merchants and importers of colonial produce, and the latter as an- exporter of goods to America and New South Wales and shipowner. Bils to a considerable amount have been returned protested on account of Messrs. Blass and Co., and their liabilities are saild to amount altogether to about 1,000,000 of marks baneo at least. With respect to the other firm, nothing certain is known, and all I have heard is, that it has not paid its biUs due yesterday. It is also mentioned with respect to the suspension of Messrs. Ullberg and Cremer, so extensively connected, and so immensely involved in monetary transetions with the north of Europe, with Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, 'that half of the mercantile firms of Stockholm will assuredly fall should this house be allowed to fail in its engagements, which are principally based upon paper operations, or blank credit acceptanees-a system much in vogue between this city and those countries; so that, one or two links in the chain failincr the rest must follow, and the consequences become ruinous to all concerned. It is even said that the Government of Sweden, anxious to prevent so fearful a catastrophe as the ruin of so many of their best firms in Stockholm, has promised a considerable amount of aid. The banking house of Solomon Reine here has also, it is said, promised a support of 1,000,000 marks banco, and the two city joint-stock banks another large sum for the support of Parties here in the same course, but how far tn is report is founded on fact I am unprepared to say ; however, great excitement exists among the mereantile community here as to how things may terminate. The rate of discount Is nominal, as business generally may be said to be at a complete standstill, and the little existing confidence vanishing very fast. I have rarely witnessed sueh a number of the leading merchants of the place assembled at the Bfrsenhalle on a Sunday as was the case this day, which shows the anxiety to ascertain the real state of public feeling to be great.
T7B QUARTERMASTER-GENEpAL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A friend has forwarded the foUowing memorandum relative to the eccentric movements of one regiment of Dragoons. He thinks (and doubtless the puolic through your columns will be of the same opinion) that they exhibit a dngular want of consideration for the public purse, and a marveUous disregard for the discomfort and heavy expense to which officers and soldiers are sometimes put, to suit the pleasure, vacillation or eccentricity, of some person or persons in authority:- '3D LIGOn DiBAcoOS. "Hounslow.-Feb. 24, 1857, regiment receives orders of readiness for Ireland; March 13, march for Liverpool; Apr1l 1, arrive at Newbridge, county Kildare. "Newbridge.-Aug. 3, order of readiness for Cahir, county Tipperary; Aug. 9, routes recoeived for 11th inst.; Au;. 10, march countermanded; Aug. 31, a troop marches for Cork; Sept. 9, a troop by railway to Belfast; Sept. 14, a troop by railway to Belfast; Sept. 14, head-quarters march for Diundalk, county Louth (arrive 19th).

" Dublin.-Nov. 16, a troop back from Belfast for Dublin; Nov. 19, order of readiness for Newbridge; Nov. 24, march into Newbridge (how long to remain it were difficult to guess). " Now, either the regiment need never have been moved from Newbrldge (with the exception of the squadron required at Belfast), or, if it was necessary to move It from Dundalk (for the convenience of a county regiment of militia stll there), some one ought to have ascertained beforehand what accommodation there was for a third cavalry regiment in Dublin, ere it arrived there only to be moved again in a fortnight back to the place which it had left 10 weeks before, head-quarters having in the meantime been stationed in two different pldees. Single troops move comparatively easily, and no one can grmsble in cases of emergency, such as during the riots at Belfast and during the late Irish elections, but the move of the head-quarters of a regiment is a more serious affair. Not only must the various regimental and troop stores, the officers' mess, &c., be packed, unpacked, and carried about much to their detriment, at a considerable public expense, but officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates generally, especially the married (with or without families) of a31 these ranks are put to serious loss and inconvenience. " It may be true that married officers (as such) are practically not recognized in Her Majesty's service, but at aU events a certain proportion of non-commissioned officers and privates per troop or company are ' married with leave' in every regiment, and are, therefore, entitled to some protection, whereas at this moment there are several non-commissioned officers who from the numerous moves of the 3d Light Dragoons during the last two months will not have a farthing of their pay at their disposal after meeting the various regulated daily and other stoppages. If it be so with them, what must it be with the unfortunate "It Is a frequent remark in the service, that ' whatever move is most unlikely or most unexpected is the very one which is acted on by the Qaartermaster-General's department. But we can hardly believe thathisRoyallHighness the Commander-in-Chief would sanction many more similar to the erratic instance before us, were he made aware of what has now been stated." In the latter remark of my friend I quite agree, so, perhaps, his Royal Highness's atteation may be called to it by your publishing the above. A SYMPATEIZER Dublin, Nov. 22.

A staff of offioials will leave Southampton by the Australian packet for Alexandria, to open the mails and divide the letters in theirtran5it othis country. For this purpose the officials will have a separate cabin to themselves, and will take the entire cbarge of the mails, instead of the Admiralty agents. This mode of preparing the mails, which has been carried on for some time by the French Government in their Mediterranean postal steamers, will greatly expedite the delivery of the correspondenoe contained in the Australian mails. If the plan succeeds, we earnestly recommend that some similar arrangement should be adopted with the other packet mails, especially thoge from India, which contain such important correspondence. Additional expenditure should not be an obstale. We freguently have to wait from two to three hours after the arnival of these nails at the Post-olrice before we receive our letters a,nd news. papers, and any saving of time would be hailed with great tisfaction by ourselves and the pubic.-h&xpn s,
IBELAND. (lMOx ou OWN )CORK olmPw"# DUBLIN, TuxSIJAY Mo Ir±G. - TS BW wok GOLD. Yesterday's accounts from Belfast st,<tte that the foolish run for gold which was made to tt partLal extent on the banks there has entirely czssed, and that throughout the province the panic has everywhere subsided. The gold that was drawn out in such hot haste has almost all returned to the bank coffers, and the people are ashamed at having given way to fears so purely imaginary, and calculated to prove so deeply injurious to themselves. The advlces from the south are of a similar tendency. The trade note of the Cork Reporter says a " For the past few days there has been a complete cess. tion of the ran on the banks; in fact many are now requiring notes for the gold they had got a few days before, whUe others are handing back their deposits. As a striking instance of the chauge that has already taken place we have been assured, on unimpeachable authority, that at thebranch of the National Bank in a neighbouring town they have this day about 5001. more from depoitors than they had before the runcommenced. The facility, and we would say cheerfulness, with which every demand on the banks in this locality was met during this panic must stlll further strengthen confidence in the stability of these establishments." It appears from the Waterford papers that durlng the recent run in that district a quarter of a million was paid away in gold by the three local banks, and that "Even on Monday men were packed so closely in the ofices that it was impossible to ass through the crowds. Sums of 61., 81, 101., nay, and 20. 'were due for interest, and would be paid if the people had common sense. Now the banks retain the amounts very properly, and thus ill as the wind was it has brought them some good. To procure gold at such a period for the demand, to meet the run fully, niust have cost the banks much. Some of our leading merchants were obliged to supply themselves with gold on last Saturda to purchase freely in the local corn-markets. As an emp atlo corrective of the agricultural panio, gold was refused in payment of rents by General Caulfield and Mr. Robert Hunt, the extensivo land agent, by whom this proof of confidence in the bank paper was impressed upon numbers, 'who spread it around." There having been a partial run last week upon the Cork savings-bank, a local paper (the Examiwi-r) offers a few words of friendly advice to the depositors: "We assure them that their money is one hundred times more secure in that bank than It would be in their possession. For every nny invested in it there is the best possible security. n fact, none can be better. The State is responsible for 311,3371., for which it has given a receipt, and which it must be accountable for 80 long as there is a State at all. There are then some 20,0001. lodged in the Bank of Ireland, ready to meet any momentary call by depositors who stupidly imagine that the present state of things can affect the Cork Savings bank Add these two suns together, and there is in the Cork Savings. bank just 1,0701. over aud above what Is due to all its depositors. It affords us satisfaction to learn that llttle more than 4,0001. was drawn out on Wednesday last; but it grieves us to know that much of that money has been the prey ot the sharper and the robber, and that some foolish people have either recklessly squandered every penny of their hard-earned savings, or been plundered of them by those 'who encourage the present alarm in order to place its victims at their mercy. A larger sum has been given notice for by depositors, to be drawn out in the course of this week. But we implore all those who have the sense to understand what we state, and the influence to advise others with profit, to endeavour to dissuade the poor people from the utter madness of taking their money out of a place of safety, and thus exposing It to every possible kind of risk." THE CULLEN ThANIPSTO. Lord St. Leonard's brief but telling remonstrance against the averments put forward in the celebrated Roman letter of Dr. Cullen has been anmwered by a monster manifesto, which is to be this day issued i2t the form of a pamphlet, bearing the Bignature of the aforesaid "Paul Culen," &,c. The dimensions of this reply preclude all possibility of anything even in the form of abridgment or condensation. Without its appendices it would occupy more than a page of The Times, and beside it the recent manifesto of the Grand Orange Lodge would, as regards proportions, shrink into utter insignificance. The chances, therefore, are, that except the noble and learned lord to whom it is addressed, no disinterested person will be found courageous enough to wade through this enormous mass of type and paper in the vain hope of being enlightened upon the merits of the question at issue. The Freeman of this morning anticipates the publicaton of the pamphlet, and gives a " summary" of its contents, with many comments, which fills nearly five columns of that journal. The foUowing IS the concluding portion of Dr. Cooen's Christmas gift to Lord St. .Leonard's: "In the last paragraph but one of the memorandum I am charged with having insinuated that the money of Roman Catholics has been applied to the endowment of Protestant schools, and, in reply, it is tauntingly stated that 'the contributon from Ireland amounted only to 60,0001., the greater part of which, it caunot be doubted, was subscribed by Protestants, who for the most part constitute the rich of that country.' If your Lordship would glance at my letter again, you 'will at once perceive that, indulging in no insinuations, x stated directly and openly that the Catholics of Dublin subscribed to the Patriotic Fund according to their means and with their accustomed generosity, and I must now add that my own contribution, to show how heartily I approved the cause, far exceeded my means. In this statement, my Lord, it is impossible to employ plainer or simpler language. But there is a question connected with the matter which the author of the memorandum tries to evade. Was It fair to apply funds, raised for one specific object of 'which all a proved, to the endowment or establishment of schools to which Catholics could not have contributed, and ln the advantage of wbich their chUdren cannot safely participate? I wMi not discuss this question, but I 6nd an answer to it in a public document now lying before me:- "'It is not neoessary to ba a Christitn to know that to collect money fo, one object and to use it for another, without the expresa consent o tbe donors, Is an act of the grossest dishonesty." " This is strong language, but it is not mine; it is that of a dignitary of the Protestant church, the Rev. Dr. Baggot, of Newry, in a letter of the 16th inst., written in praise of the administration of the Patriotic Fund. Your Lordship appears to agree in substance with Dr. Baggot. 'It is treason,' you observe, 'to humanity to suppose that the fund will not be honestly dedicated to the sacred purposes for which it is designed.' Applying this test to the Patriotic Fund, was It, it may be asked, originally desi ed, or were the public, when called upon to contribute, informed that a very large portion of the fund'was to be devoted to the endowment of schools in which the teaching is Protestant, or conducted on the principles of the union schools, and most dangerous to Catholic children? Yet a quarter of a mflhon has been thus applied. The allusion to Catholic poverty has, we think, been unwisely introduced. It recalls reminiscences which it were far better, my Lord, not to revive. If Catholics are poor, we are tempted to ask, in the words of an illustrious Irish poet,- "'What made them Helots? Gibbets, scourge, and brand, *Plaguing with fvtile raie a faith devout.' "The injustice of the laws and the action of the establshment have rendered that inferiority in point of wealth in. evitable, with which we are often reproached. First came confiscation on a large scale, and legal penalties were afterwards monthly inflicted on our Catholic gentry for non-attendance at Protestant worship; and ceased to be levied only when all property had been wrested from their hands. Even now the country is enormously burdened to support an institution which, by its religious teaching, can in nowise indemnniy the State or the people for the ample supplies which it receives. Looking at the country in the light which past and present history has thrown about it, we should be prepared to infer that if a Catholic people still existed its temporal condition would be that of utter destitution. But instead, my Lord, of reproach on this head, should not the incomparable fidelity of the people to the faith of their fathers be admired, which no amount of persecution has been able to subdue? " ' Of all institutions now existing,' says a high Protestant authority, ' the Irish church is the most absurd and indefensible. It is considered so by the present generation, it will be so considered by posterity, and men will wonder how such an abuse could have existed so long.' If I have, my lords, touched upon some of those religious grievances which afflict this land, it is not, indeed, to evoke angry feeling, but to demand redress. Shrinking from the calm asserrion of our rights in the spirit of men who deserve to be free, while weoshould fall immeasurablyin your Lordship's estimation, we should at the same time stand accused of having Indefinitely deferred the attainment of justice, which wonld benefit the empire at large, by the union of all its people on termssof perEect equalitymthe bondsofeternalfriendship. In conclusion, my lord, I beg to state that many Catholics have assured me of their 'willingness to contribute to the Jidian fund if measures be adopted to protect the poor children of Catholic soldiers against the dangers of proselytism. Perhaps the appointment of some Catholic noble. men and gentlemen to take part in the central committees in London and Calcutta, with the view of superintending the interests of those children, would remove all apprehensions and satisfy public aneiety. II I have the honour to be, with profound respect, your Lordship's obedient servant, "PAIIL CULL.EN." T}E COSLX TRADE. Accounts from Cork announce that there are now lying in Queenstown and Passage the largest number of vessels that have anchored together in those roads for two years. Between the two anchorages there are probably not less than 200 sail of all sorts, almost all of which are foreigners arrived from the Pacifie with guano, or from the Mediterranean with corn. Fully half the vessels are of the latter class, and are only waiting for orders to discharge in England. This crowding of vessels is chiefly owing to the strong southerly winds and thick weather which has prevailed for the last two days, and compelled the homeward bound to run into Cork harbour for shelter.

TIlE FRENCH ARMT IN THE CRIMEA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIRES. Sir,-Although the general oonclusions of the admirable artide In The Timu of yesterday, suggosted by Mr. Scrive's report on the condition of the French army, are in the main perfectly just, as the observations and maxims are irrefragable, it is only fair towards our allies to admit that their position in the winter of 1855-6 was very different from that which they occupied in 1851.5, and that to a consider able extent they were affected by the same overwork, and exposure, and neglect Which caused such losse6 and misery among our soldiers in the first year of he war. In tho course of the campaign the French received such large reinforceir ents thab our field of action became narrowed and concentrated, and our duties much diminished in severity,while,thanks to youreffortsandthe pressure of public opinion, our men were provided with every oomfort and oitentimes with many luxuries. Bat the French were by the very greatness of their numbers, and by their desire to exaggerate the details of the old fable which tells us how the frog burst itself in its efforts to represent tho magnitude of the bull (though We must confess that the bull was once nearly killed by his attempts to look as big as the frog), exposed to severe privations just in proportion as ther foroed us into the corner. During the winter of 1855-6 their outposts were near Foy Sala-at the Phoros-pass along the line of the upper Belbeck, and large massea of their infantry lay out in the chill valleya near Vanutka, Mfg. komia, and Baidar. They guarded the advanced line of the Tchernaya; they protected the left atInkermamn; they drew for these lurge forces buta small quantity of provisions from Balaldava. The greater portion of their supplies had to be carted in the depth of winter-a very bitter and severe one -from Kanmlesch, to the distance of 10, 15, 18, and 20 miles daily through the very same kind of country, seven miles of which offeredtoussuchanInsuperablebarrier in1854-5. Their m-nes on the plateau causedfever and pestilence; their position on the flanksof the armyresemble strictly thatwhich we occupied when we held the right over Inkermaun, and were threatened by Liprandi in the plains of Balakdava, and by the mass of the RussiAas from the city and from the standing camp at the other side of the Tchernaya. It is only fair to recoUect these facts. No one who has not seen what the French "equipage$ militaires' had to go through in the dark, short, bitter winter days in drawing rations from Kamiench for the sapply of the troops in Baidar can form a notion of their sufferings. In that valley I believe the bodies of 8,000 or 9,000 French are resting. Al during the winter they were exposed to constant alertu and incessant fatigues, while we, surrounded by French on all sides-left, right, and rear, with railways, roads,, and plenty-no enemy to harnas us, or fear or possibilty of assault, were enjoying ourselves much as our ancestors are said to have done on the eve of the battle of Hastings, without the same responsibility or results.

Murchison, president, in the chair. After the election of several honorary members and fellovs, the President announced that a letter had been received from Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Scott Waugh, Surveyor-General of India, returning thanks for the society's gold medal which had been awarded him on the completion of the great trigonometrical survey of India. Colonel Waugh states that the Cashmere and Thibot surveys are progressing favourably, and will make a beautiful topographical map. Ml essrs. Montgomerie and Elliot Brownlow have fixed two peaks on the Karakotum, one of which is 27,928ft. high, its distnce being 136 miles from the last stations. 'lTis would indicate the peak to be the third highest yet measured. The Cashmere series has twice crossed the snowy range with two stations each time on it. From West Australia an account had been received through Lieutenant Du Cane, IRE., stating that Mr. Frank Gregory had, upon an exploring tour to the north, crossed the Murchison River and penetrated upwvards of 100 miles further than Austin's last dticoveries. The papers read were :-1. Progress of the BritishNorth-Amencan Expedition under the command of J. Palliser, Esq., F.R.G.S. The despatches are dated FortGarry, July 16, and Fort Perabina, July 27, 1857, to which places the expedition had proceeded from Lake Superior rid Fort William. Mr. Palliser intended travelling to the westward assoonaspossible. 2. Reports from the Expedition to Eastem Africa under Captains R. Burton and J. H. Spoke, F.R.G.S. Captain Burton arrived at Zanzibar on tho l9th of December, 1856. The season being dry, combined with the unsettled state of affairs consequent upon the death of the Imaum of Muscat, rendered it advisable to postpone his journey into the interior untii June. In the meantime accompanied by Captain Speke, he had visited the main land. Leaving Zaunzibar on the 5th of January, he reached Pemba in eight days, and crossed thence to Mombas in three more, where he remained 21 days, obtaining information from the missionaries and the natives. Thence he proceeded on a coasting voyage to the mouth of the Pangany river, whence he went inland on foot, but tracing the course of the river to Fuga, the capital of Mambara, which is 37 miles in a straight line from Pangany and 74 by the river. He then returned to the latter place, where both Captain Speke and himself were attacked by fever, which prevented a further examination of the main land to the southward, and they returned to Zanzibar on the 6th of March. Captains Burton and Speke have since penetrated, at the head of an armed escort, into the interior from Bagamoyo in search of the Great Lake. The reading of the paper was followed by some interesting observations from Dr. Livingston, Dr. Barth, and otbers; and the meeting adjourned until the 14th of December. THE RuISSIAN PRisoxrnRs AT LEwxs.-The kindness extended to the officers detained at Lewes as prisoners on parosz during the late Russian war appears to have made a strong and lasting impression on some of our compulsory guests at that period. We have been favoured with the sight of a letter from one of these officers, Lieutenant Hook, addressed to Mr. William Figg, containing warm cxpressions of kind feeling towards the inhabitants of Lewes and speaking with grateful remembrance of the hospitality extended by them towards the "prisoners." The writer who dates from " St. Petersburg, Zarskoje Selo, 25tb October, 157" (il c., 6th November, English style), says:" Since I left England and arrived to my Fatherland have I been in very good healt, and have spend may time very agreable amon my family and my friends. Since last Mars (March) have I been in Zarskoje Selo, in the model regement, where I get apointment for 1S months to be informed ins nevr exercice, and after it time I vill go back to my regement in Finland,whereI hope to get a company and hope to be promoted to kapten. If you wish to know somethmg about my comrades, so can I inform you that Alexander Dalin and Bollfras is very well and still in our old regement, LI. -Colonel Grahn has got a regement in Russia' and also Nicolaus Dalin has got appointment in a sharpshoth battalon in Russia. Melart and Blum, with their familes, are also in good healt; Blum has left the service because he is very well off: Olivier Grotenfelt is stil in the Finlander service. Oscar is a officer in a sharpshoth regiment in Russia since a year ago. Akerman is still in a milithire hospital in Abo, but, poor fellow, he has lost his wife. And if you will do me the favour to write to me shall I feel most grateful . but pray let me know of all my friends who you do know i know In Lewes and Its neighbourhood. I can asre you, my dear Mr. Figg, that my doparture from Lewes has been much regrtted, nd Ihave lewes, with all my friends I left there, often in mm memory. Never schall I forget the time of my captivite whereunder I was treated wIth nothing but the greatest kindness and hospitality; therefore receive onoe more, my dear friends, my warmest thanks, and I am only sorry that I am not able to explain all that my heart foels, Yoe must excuse me, if you must gueas to what I wisched to explain in this letter, but I have forgotten much of the Engltsch language, because I have no much time to study it. and no one to speak it with. And now farewell, my dear Mr. Figg i pray make my comnplimentb to every one of my friends woho remember me in Lewes.-I have the honour to reman, your ever obliged, GEORGEBHoon," It will be seen by the above that Lieutenant Hook made no little acquaintance with the English language during his so3ourn here, and that he need scarcely have aplogied for havin "forgotten much" of it. Indeed, considering his statemenrt that he has " no much time to study it, and no one to speak It with," the whole style of the letter bespeakx a proficiency in the writer highly dreiltable to hls owers as a linguist.

MONKEY-fARKET ad CITY INTELLIGENE. Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 9 per ;ilUe premium, and the short exchange on London is 25 40 per 11. sterling. On oomparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17i. I0id. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is at about the same price in Paris and London. By advices from lambaurg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13-7 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 1 3-lOths per cent. dearer in London than in Hamburg. The quotation of the exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is about 108 per cent, for first-class paper, and from that price to 106 per cent. for other descriptions. At the present rate of discount here there is, consequently, no profit on the transmission of gold from this country to the United States. The public continue to support the stock-market by heavy purchases, and the closing quotations today show an advance of a-quarter per cent. The first transactions in Consols for money were at 891 to ;, and at the conclusion the prices were 89i to 90 for money and 90 to k for the 7th of December. A steady flow of bullion to the Bank assists the tendency to a restoration of confidence, and altogether a better feeling prevails, although some additional failures annouriced this afternoon have occasioned deep regret. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 881 to 89 ; New Three per Cents., S88 to 89; India Stock, 214 to 216; India Bonds, 40s. to 35s dwsount; and Exchequer-bills, lls. to 6s. discount. In the Stock-Exchange to-day, owing to the large investments of the public, the supply of money was abundant, and short loans on Government securities could be obtained readily at 6 to 7 per eent. At the Bank of England the applications continue gradually to diminish, and as the repayments now falling due there are extremely large the weekly returns are henceforth likely to show a considerable improvement. In the discount-market also there were some signs of relaxation. No particular alteration has taken place in foreign stocks, but they continue in fair demand, and the market closed steadily. Turk ish left off at a slight improvement. Brazilian Five per Centa, were negotiated at 98 ; ditto, Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97; Chilian Six per Cents., 102; Portuguess, 43k, 421, and 43; RussiaR Five per Cents., for the account, 106 and 105k; Spanish, 41; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 25k ; ditto, Certificates, 5i ; Turkish Six per Cents., 871 and A; for the account, 87a, i, and i; ditto, Four per Cents.

The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 95c. for money and 67f. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of an eighth. The position of the Bank of France is stated to have been strengthened, the bullion now held being 7,680,0001., or 100,0001. beyond the amount at the date of the return published a fortnight back. The increase is Eaid to have been particularly rapid during the last few days, and to have taken place without any artificial purchases being made in England or elsewhere. A further sum of about 150,0001. in Australian, Russ,an, and other gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The total taken there since this day week is thus raised to 930,0001., exclusive of any sovereigns that may have been returned from Scotland or elsewhere. The stoppage of Messrs. Herman Sillem and Co., a house of more than 50 years' standing, and of very great respectability, was announced this morning. Their transactions were in connexion with Germany, Holland, and all parts of the continent, as well as with North and South America and the West Indies, and the liabilities are there fore considerable. At the moment of suspension they had large funds in hand, and according to the opinion of numerous friends, who would have been ready with asistance, it was doubtful if the step had become necessary. As, however, they had already sustained several severe losses from the recent failures on the continent, and could not feel certain that others might not follow, they resolved, with the honourable feeling which has always distinguished them, to encounter no further risks that could prejudice the general position of their creditors. Great confidence is expressed that they will ultimately pay in full, and an early resumption is hoped. The following circular has been issued:- * London, 2, Crosby-square, Nov. 24. "It is with extreme regret we have to inform you that the losses we have experienced during the last few weeks have reduced us to the painful necessity of suspending our payments. " Oar books wUIl be submitted to Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and Co., and a statement laid before our creditors at the earliest possible opportunity. " We are, &o., " HERMAN SILLEbI, SON, BD Co." The stoppage has also taken place of Messrs. Carr, Josling, and Co., an old and respectable firm, connected chiefly with the trade to the North of Europe. They hold a considerable amount of the acceptances of Messrs. Hoare, Buxton, and Co., Svensden and Johnson, and the other Swedish houses whose failure was announced last week, and this has been the immediate cause of their difficulties. The liabilities are supposed to amount to about 300,0001., and the assets show a large nominal surplus. It is feared, however, that these will be found to have been greatly depreciated by recent circumstances. Messrs. Alexander Hintz and Co., merchants and dealers in colonial produoe, have likewise suspended. The house had been established for many years, and has been brought down by the recent failures here and on the continent. The liabilities are understood to be large. Annexed is the circular issued:- " 29, Mincing-lane, London, Nov. 24. "With the deepest regret we have to Inform you thab in consequence of the numerous failures here and rbroad we are under the painful necessity of sauspending ottr p%y- "Our books will be placed in the hands of Melsrs. Quilter. Ball, and Co., with instractious to prepare a statement of oar affairs, and to lay the same before our oreditors as soon as possible. " We remain, &k., " ALEXANDER HINTZ Asn Co." wh non the G&lasgow failures were announced at the beginuing of last mouth the namne of Messrs. Godfrey, Pattison and Co. was included. That firm immediately and with something more than indignation denied the statement. They denouDncd it as reckless and unfounded, and complained bitterly of the damage it might inflict upon their credit. On their own authority, therefore, the notification was contradicted, although a belief was entertained that the communication originally telegraphed from Glas- gow had not been carelessly made, and that the prolonged existence of the house was merely due to certin arrangements for the purpose on the part of the Western Bank of Scotland. The following extract from a Scotch paper now indicates the condition in which these persons stood when they were thus circulating assurances calculated to induce their fellow-traders to rely upOn their perfect solvency:- qTrsX AFAFRs OF GODFREY, PATTOS0X ANYD CO.-A meeting of the creditors of Godfrey, Pattison and Co., was held on Thursday, Mr. Smith, of the Lancoefeld Spinnlng Company, in the chair. Mr. M'EwAn read a statement sing the liabilities to oonsist of 296,2351. and the assets to 67.2811., or about 4s. 6d. per pound. Of the assets 47,229b, Ig the amouant of stock, and the rest heritable pro,erty and debte. Bills th the extent of 97,0001., to hiuch the name of the firm is attached in oonianotlon with Dennistoun and Co. and Babock and Co., are Included in the liabilities. Should these be met the estate will be worth about 69. 6d. per pound. A committee Wus appointed to realize the stock as far as possible.' It appears that an idea is atill entertained of the po&sibility of resuscitating the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Bank, which stopped on the lth inst. with liabilities for about 1,000,0001. Forbearance is tc. be asked from the depositors, and the shareholders are to subscribe new capital, towards which the directors offer 100,0001. As there are more than 200 persons interested as shareholders, it will be very satisfactory if they can ia any proper way be restored to a position of safety; but at a meeting which took place yesterday there was too much disposition to follow the Glasgow example of " saying nothing of the past," and of regarding the misfortunes of the bank, not as a penalty for misconduct, but as a " great public calamity," to inspire confidence that its restoration would be productive of general benefit. A meeting of creditors was held to-day of Messrs. J. P. de Sa and Co., Brazilian merchants, whose suspension was announced on the 314th inst., and after a prolonged discussion a composition was accepted of 10s. in the pound, payable in instalments at three, six, and nine months. ,The liabilities were stated to be only 1a,2o1., and e assets abeut 9,000Z. The following relates to the question of the poEsibility of a railway commnunication acroM the Channel "Bare-. Surrey, Nlov. 21. Sir,-Obesrving in 2ze Tme of this day a paarp headed 'Submarine Tunnel between France and gaaS,' in which the intentions of the French engineer IY de Gamond are detaed, and wherein it is stated that the Ideoa of the tunnel was brought under the attention of th E mperor acme time since, and a eommittee formed to report thereon, *"*Permit me to reark that I brought under the notice of the Emperor of the French, some considerable time snce, the particulars of a project for connecting Enland with France by mens of a railay tubulr bridge to be thrown over the Strait of Dover,' between Dover Cliff8 and Cap Grisnez, whloh has every prospect of success, and has oocu pied my attention for along period, and which I should not at this moment have adverted to but for the above announcement. I subjoin the partlcular "The proposed bridge, or viaduct, is designed for the purpose of unting the railways of Britain with those of on.- tinental Europe generally-the English terminus of the bridge will rest on Dover Cliffs to give the necesary altitude above the level of the sea for the free passage of ressels of telargest dimensdons, and the bridge ill be supported across the Straits by towers rising from the bed of the Channel, at equal distances a ,-say of about 500 feet; the summit Of each towver ill form a light-house, and contain a gas reflector and an alarm, for the double object of guiding ships by night, and of warming them of danger in time of fog; the gas to be lighted at sunset throughout the whole line of viaduct, and the alarm to be set in action when necessaryui either case by electric apptus, at the will of the superintendent at either nus. The towers at water-mark wil be fitted with 'f enders,' to prevent aecident to shipping in the event of any unforeseen collision, and the FrenchR terminus of the bridge wiU rest on Cape Grisnez, the land approach to whioh wil require to be hrought to the same elevation or level as the English termlnus. The viaduct will be about 20 miles in length, and could be traversed by train in 20 minutes at all seasons of the year. The greatest depth of the Straits is about>Zl fathoms, and the ordinary depths from 12 to 14 fathoms, with a chalk foundatLon ; and although the propod bridge is of tubular formation, it would be constructed so that the light of day may ilumine it in daytime, and a free current of fresh air pervade it at all times The batteries of Dover Castle would oommand the English approaches, while a battery oould be placed to cover the French terminus, and thus secure either conntry from the apprehension of invasioi.

STATE OF RADE,. MANCHESTER, Nov. 24. The suspension of business appears to have been more complete to-day than at any time during the present crisis. Some of the larger home and export houses have found money In past weeks to take advantage of the bargains offering where spinners and manufacturers were compelled to make great concesaions in price, but this morning even offers of this kind have failed. One cause of this has been the further giving way of the raw material to-day at Liverpool, and the extensive failures on the continent have also increased the diflioulties in the way of business. Spinners have been decidedly more anxious serlers than last week, and the meetings on the Exehange have been protracted to a later hour than usual, but no amount of con. cession seemed to tempt buyers to operate. Some business was expected for Germany in yarns, but the stoppage of Messrs. ierman Sillen, Son, and Co., of London, apears to have had a bad effeot on the houses in that trade here and this branoh of the market has been quite as Blat as the others, In the cloth trade sellers report this to have been decidedly the flattest day they have had. The prices current place the quotations of all kinds of calicoes at a lower figure than they have done heretofore,'and an opinion prevails that we are only now beginning to feel the difficulties occasioned by the state of the money-market to anything like their full extent. Notwithstanding the great extent to which production has been curtailed-and it would probably be still more limited but for the fact that many spianers are in possession of cotton by which they would probably suffer more loss by storing now that a reaction in prices has come than by using up-the quantity of goods produced ls still very large, and stocks are accumulating considerably. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report * *' The improved feeling which sprang up in the early part of last week disappeared as suddenly, and te rDsrket relapsed into the dul and inactive state of the previous week. To-day there is reaUl no demand for goods, buyer, contenting Shemaelves with picking up snuo cheap lots as are pressed on the market. Of course, under these ciesnecauces, prices are very irregulur, and the quotations we give are entirely nominal, though considerably below those of Tuesday last." LEEDS, Nov. 24. The markets in both oloth-halls have been again of a quiet character, but the tone of the markets was rather better. Sales of a few heavy goods and cloths of general descriptions were effected, but the purobases were all in smal lots. There Is a patient desire manifested on all sides to wait for an improved order of things, and, instead of large numbers of the factory operatives having been thrown out of employ by the complete stoppage of works, the wind of adversty, It may be said, Is tempered by an extensive adoption of short-time 'working. The oloth-dresers and dyers re Tery slack, some of them having literally nothing to do. The flax-spinners, as was intimated in 7he Times of Monday, are running their machinery only five days a-week. Fortunately, the late news from America has been of a comparatively favourable character, for If it had not the flax-minls here would have limited their work to four days a-week. As the stocks of linen yarns and other products of flax in the hands of the manufacturers are but small, nor, indeed, has there been anything like over production, a slight improvement in trado would probably be followed by the resumption of fulltime woridng. Some of the mahinists re fallin aoff in employment through the withdrawal or sus;Dension of orders recently given both by home and foreign houses, the tigPhtness of the money-market and commercild failures havi rendered such steps necessary. Happlly, there are no ioC4I failurles to add to the depression. HTJDDE1E3FIEID, Nov. 24. With a damp, dull morning there has been bu; acmall attendance of buyers in the cloth-market this morning. Only a very llmited business was done. There was no change in the price of either goods or wool.
RAILWAY AND MINING SRARBS. Tuesaey Evening. In the railway market a recovery has taken place from the late depression, owing to moderate investments by the public and repurchases by speculators for the fall; the movement has also been aided by the steadiness of the fuinds. At 4 o'clock Caledonian showed an improvement of 1 r cent. Midland and South-Weste ,and Great rorther, Lancashire and Yorksire, North-Western, SouthEastern, and North-Eatern stocks of J to i per cent. East Indian continue firm; in Canadian there was little alteration, and a decline occurred in Geelong and Melbourne. French desciptions were rather better, except Southern of France, which dlightly receded. American securities were flatter, especially Michigan Central; Illinois Central share3 rere also quoted at a reduction. Mines were in little demand, but the closing prices in some case3 show an advance. A further improvement took place in joint-stock banks, from purchases by the public; London and Weastminster left off 42 to 44; London JointStock, 26 to 7J; London and County, 28 to 9; and Union, 19 to 20i; City marked 55, and were afterwards dealt inat 58. Miscellaneous securities were active, but the only alteration was a slight decline in European ani American Steam. PRICES OF qTTA RP.R ~lI22Ilhlhm 03 LedeCANAL9.

FATAL AcCIDcyTT TO A OmczPR.-On Sutnday evening Cornet Richard Charles Echalaz, of the 7th Dragoon Guards, quartered at Canterbary, while on a pleasure excursion, received injuries of which at 5 o'clock on Monday morning he died. The deceased, with several other offloers, had been on a visit to Herne Bay, a distance of eight miles from Canterbury. They were returning In the evenin! on horseback, and on the Sturry-road, about half a mile from the cavalry barracks, they increased the speed at which they were prooeeding. On reaching the turnpike known as the Vanxhall-gate they attempted to leap the gate, in which the first horse succeeded; but the second, which the deoeased was riding, caught his fore4legs in the top bar, and turned a complete somersault, falling with great force upon the unfortunate young ma At this moment, it is stated, a third horse dashed on to the deceased as he lay on the ground, and threw ite rider, who was very much shaken. As quioliy as possible Cornet Echalaz was removed to the barracks, bat he was then almogt in a lifeless state. One of his arms was broken in several places, and his internal injuries were deemed to be of a very serious mature. The poor young man lingered until Monday morning, when he expired, as above xtated. His friends are id to reside In the neighbourhood of Warwick, where his father is a clergyman An inquest waa to have been opened on the body on Monday afternoon, but it was postponed at the auggeation of the miltary -authorities.

RAILWAY INTELLIGBNGvL BRADFORD, WAKEFIELD, AND LETDn The guaefle2'meetinDgof this company was held yestr. day at radfor eif (=o Anderton wvas in the cha'r The secretary.(lMr Osrr) reaui the directora' report and statement of accounts, an abstract of which has appeared in 2c ThbeoCiAT.Aw, in moving the adoption of the report and accounts, said the local traffic had now been tried for more than a month, and It had not only come up to, but exceeded, the directors' estimate of it. From the circu stances of the times both the through and local traffic on all lines, in goods especially, had fallen off considerably, Their line would share the fate of others, and would not get that amount of traffc for the months of November and a. cember that it would in ordinary times. The state of the permanent wvay last month was, like that of most now lines, not very satisfactory. The resident engineer had that norning informed him that the lines both to and from Wakefield had now got into a satisfactory working state, and every day would see them in a better condition. He next referred tothe appointment of Mr. Seymour Clarke Lstraffic manager of the line. Mr.Clarke was the traffic manager of the Great Northern and of the Leeds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction Railways; and the 1ater undertaking benig so intimately connected with this company's line, it was thought desirable that there should be one trafflc manager for both lines, so that there might be no interruption of the traffic, and that the pablic might be put to no inconveni. ence. During.the whole of the month of October this com. pany had no through traffic arraugements with -the Leeds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction Company, ao that pasen. gers coming from Wakefield to Bradford, or coming on** the Ardsley branch to Leds, had to rebook. He was glad to say that the directors had mAe an arrangement for booking through on the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junotion line, and he thought the arrange ment 'was fair between the two companies, and would give accommodation to the public. He had been told by several gentlemen residing at Wakefield that the opening of this company's line between Wakefield and Leeds was of more advantage to Wakefield than any line that had yet come to that town, and he hoped the people of Wakefield would give the company their support Since the opening of the ine there had been several slps on the embankments, but they were now in a safe condition, and he believed the company had nothing to fear from wet weather. (Hear, bear.) Mr. BARPF seconded the motion for the adoption of the report and accounts, and it was carried unanimoudy. rhe CHA}Rn&N, in reply to a question, said he thought a call would be made upon the shareholders early ia January. The directors wex% getting the contractors' work measured as quickly a they could. They thought that the cost of the works woull be less than the original estimate. (Bear, hear.) Mr. Bucit remarked that such an occurrenee was very uncommon. On the proposition of Mr. BLCKIBUBN, seconded by Mr. J. KIGHLEY, thanks were voted to the ehairman and the directors for their exertions in promoting the interests of the company. The proceedings then terminated. MANCHESTER, SHEFFIELD, AND LINCOLNSHME.

STUART and Mr. XdStice CRESSWELL.) BROOK V. BROO1;. bARTAO AT ALTONA OF A DO!.ICILED BRITISH SUB. JECT WITH IS DECEASED WIFE'S SISTEp The hearing of this came, involving the validity in thbi country of tho- marriage at Altona, in the Duchy of Schles. 'Wig-Holstein, in June, 1850, of a domiciled British subjilc with his deceased wife's sister, was resumed, The questcn arises between the persons claiming to be the heir-at.law and next of kin of a deceased child of such marriage on the one hand, and the Crown on the other hand. The ATRosiczzyG-fzrALs aid all were aware of the interest-he was about to say the factitious iuterest-which attached to this question. A great number of people had been led, he thought delusively, to put faith in the representation that they might rely on the validity in this cOUn. try of marriages such as that now in question, and he regretted to mee public announoements inviting people to avail themselves of the law of foreign countries in relation to such marriages. Therefore he was glad that a determination would be at last come to in the matter, whloh would pu' an end to much doubt, Anxiety, and suffering which must be the result of that delusive anticipation to which he had adverted. The Court was here called upon to recognize as valid amanlage which was plainly according to the laws of this countrY absolutely void. It was not a marriage of persons who were domiciled In Altona, but it was a marriage at that place of domiciled British subjects, who resorted thither for the particular purpose of evading the laws of this country. He might here say that the party who contracted the marriage had no faith in its validity or legality according to the laws of England, for ir; his will Mr. Brook spoke of the children of his second marriage as his " reputed children."^ He advertedto that, not because it had any legal bearing oa the question under discusdon, but because a pathetio appeal to the Court had been made on the other side relative to Mr. Brookls belief in the legitiroacy of those children, than which appeai nothing could have been more unfotnded. The propositions contended for by his learned friends were-first, that the statute of 1835 (5th and 6th William IV., c. 54) had no application to marriages celebrated out of England or Ireland; and, secondly, that the law of England wms bound to accept the lex loci C071tractus, and to receive from that law tho determination of the validity of the marriage and the consequences of the marriage. The propositions he should contend for were-first, that the Act of 1835 was a law of universal acceptation, speaking to and binding all British subjects resident within England or Ireland; secondly, that it was a personal statute, creating a personal disability which followed to and attached on every natural born British subject in Eugland or Ireland, and pusued them everywhere on the sub. ject of the contract of marriage; and, thirdly, that being one of our established laws, we were not bound to accept the rule of the Zez loci contractus without qualification. The passages which had been read on the other side from thaS valuable repertory, the late Mr. Justice Story's book on the Con1fict of Latcs, amounted to this, that no State had power to call on a foreign country to recognize within that foreign country its own peculiar laws and institutions. But that proposition left untouched the other propositlUn, that every State has a right to make laws for its own subjects which shall be bindingonthem everywhere, save this,only that the subjects may not set up their own native law in oppo. sitionto the law of the country in which he may happen to be resident, butyet that the duty of obedience on the part of the subject will attach to him on hisreturn to his native country. It was idle on the part of the other side to rely on the lcx loci co=tradtua, unless they could show that the courts oE law in Den,mark had, after a solemn argument, and with full information before them of the personal disqualificstion with which by the law of England the contracting parties had been branded and impressed, and that they had resorted to Altona non an imoi morandi, sed animo rcr,-tukizdi, and for the express, avowed, and declared object of evading an express enactment made by the Legislature of this country, declared this marriage to be vAlid. It must first be shown that the courts of the foreigu country had had their attention drawn to the particular cir. cumnstances of the case, and that, notwithstanding these cir. cumstances, they had held the marriage valid, but until that was sbown it was, he repeated, idle to talk of and rely onx the fez foci contractus. Jurists had divided the different classes of statutes into real and personaL Personalstatutes, said Mr. Justice Story, sec. 13, are held to be of general obligation and force everywhere; but real statutes are held to nave no extra territorial force or obligation, "Personal statutes (says Merlin, cited in sec. 13 of Storu-is Con.fict of Latis) are those which have princlpallv for their object the person,andtreatonlyofproperty(biansinoidentailly(accamoire m4mt); such are those which regard birth, legitimacy, freedom, the right of instituting suits, majority as to age, in: capaity to contract, to make a wilL &a. Real statutes are those which have principally for iheir object (biens), and which do not speak of persons except in relation to pro. perty; such are those whioh concern the disposition whicb. one may make of his property, either while he is living or by testament." In a passage from the work of tho celebrated French Chancellor D'Aguesseau, cited in the same work, section 14 note, it Is said, that the test of a statute being personal is its being " dirocted towards the person, to provide in general for his qualifications, or his general abso. lute capacity, as when it relates to the qualities of major or minor, of father or son, of legitimate or illegitimate, of ability or inability to contract, by reason of personal causes ;" and, ibid, section 16, " by the personality of laws foreign jurists generally mean all laws which concern the condition, state, and capacity of persons; by the roality of laws, all laws which concern property or things, oEc ad rem specta"t Whenever they wish to express that tbe operation of a law is universal they compendiously announce that it is a personal statute, and 'whenever, on the other hand, they wish to express that it8 operaticri is confined to the country of its origin they simply declare it to be a real statute." The statute, therefore, ot the 5th and 6th William IV., cap. 64, clearly fell within the definition of a personal statute, and, as such, it mnst be held on the authority ofjuri-ta to be binding. The jus genuium called on the Courts of Denmark to reco Ize that Act of Parliament as personal, and on the ground of comity to admit the inability or disability of tne contracting parties. If, then, after that Denmark cbose to admit the marriage, It was not for this country also to recognize it. With reference to parties escaping the provisions of the Marriage Act, 26th George II., cap 33, by going to Scotland, it should be borne it mind that that Act expressly excepted Scotland from its provisions, The learned Attorney-General then proceeded to contend that the Iez loci oitracei applied only to the solemnities attending the celebration of marriage, and that it would not prevail where either of the contracting parties was under a legal disability by the law of the domicil (" Conway v. Beazley," 3 Bagg., Eca. Prep., G39). In that case a second mxrriage had In England, on a Scotch divorce (a rtinculo) from an English marriage between parties domiciled in England at the time of such marriage and divoroe, was declared to be nulL Mr. Justice Story bad put the very case that bad bere arisen. "Suppose"X says Story, section 116, "a cAse of A marriage incestuous by the law of the oountry where the parties are born or are bond ficf domiciled, and witbout changinRg their domiail for the purpose of eading that law they Ro to a foreign coun. try where a different rule prevails, and the marriage which would not be inceshtous by its laws Is there celebrated, and the parties afterwards return to their own cotntry, ought such a marriage to be held valid in such oountry ?I liberns has put the very case, and held that it ought not to bethere beld valid, and the late Mr B in his commentaries on Colonial and Po e , pr 1,s g

The order was made under the 46th section of the Poor Law Amendment Act, the 4th and 5th of William IV., cap. 76, but the vestry had disobeyed the order, upon the gronnd that, as the por of the parish were regulated by a local Act, the Poor Law Board had no power to interfere. The COURT granted n rule to show cause. TIlE QUE;EN V. KEMrP. In this case the Court had granted an attachment against William Kemp, in order that he might be compelled to give securities for keeping the peace. The application was granted on the part of the defendant's wife, who stated on a previous day that he had treated her with great cruelty and violence, and when she left him to live with her parents he refused to allow her more than half-a-crown a- week for her maintenance. The defendant now appeared in court and read a paper, In which he distinctly denied that he had ever treated his wife with any violence. On the contrary, he said be had always treated her with great kindness and tenderness, and stated facts to show that she was labouring under a delusion in supposirng that he had any wish to injure her. With respect to hi6 refusal to make his wife a suitable aUowance for hlr maintenance, ho stated that he was in reduced circumstances, and all ho was able to allow her was a sum of 101. a-year, payable monthly. He also stated that when his wife had applied to the magistrates in petty sessions for their protection the magistrates were of opinion that there was no ground whatever for the application. Lord CAMPl'BELL, addressing Mr. Power, said that if he re luired it the law must be enforced; but his Lordship ruggested that some arrangement should be made which should be for the benefit of both husband and wife. Mr. PowzR said this was the first time he had heard of the contradiction, but the defendant had made no affi. dav:t. ir. Justice ERLX said the decision of the magistrates in petty sessions was a great corroboration of the defendant's statemnent. Lord CAMPvBELL.-.And it has a great air of probability. Mr. POwER sunbmitted that the truth or falsehood of the charge was not in question. If the defendant's statement was true, he wrould not be damaged by entering into his reeogn=zances to keep the peace. Lord CAMI-BELL said the defendant must enter Into his own recognizances in 1001. to keep the peace, and explained to him that if he comnumittenovlncnohr wnd happen to him.nedlno violen no harm would Mr. Justice COLELtWDGE said the Court gave no opinion on the oase. TIIE QUEEN V.- Mr. D. SEYMOUR moved, on the affidavit of Mr. Cameron, against whom the Attorney-General had filed a criminal information for a misdemeanour, for a rule to show cause why the trial should not be postponed till the sittings after next llihary Term. The learned gentleman said he moved on the affidavit of the defendant, and also of his attorney, Mr. Cotterell, who stated that it would be quite impossible for themn to be prepared for their trial at an earlier period. Lord CAOMPBELL said the learned counsel might tako a rule, cause to bo sho wn to-morrow. TltE QUEEN V. CHERRY In this case the Court had granted an attachment against the llev. Mr. Cherry, the rectorof Burghfield, in the county of Berks, in order to compel him to give sureties to keep the peace with respect to his wife. Mr. HUDDLFSTON, (Q.C., now said he appeared on the ,art of Mrs. Cherry to consent to the matter standing over till next Term, provided Mr. Cherry would oonsent to enter into recognizances not to take his wife home by force. Mr. MiAuE said he and Sir F. Thesiger were instructed on the part of Mr. Cherry, and they were willing to accede to that arrangement. Lord CAMIrIIELL said Mr. Cherry must enter into his own recognizances in the sum of 1001., and two sureties in 501. esch. EX PARTE TURE. Mr. COLLIER, Q.C., moved on the part of ayoung man named Tuke for a ruile calling on the examiners appointed to examine candidates to be admitted to practise as attorneys to show cause why they should not examine the ap. plicant. It appeared from the statement made by the learned counsel that the applicant had sent in his testimonials, &c., but that the examiners had also received some affidavits from the Law Society of Birmingham which imputed to the applicant that previous to his articles he had been connected with a loan society and had been guilty of some irregularities in his accounts. The examiners, withont furnishingl the applicant with conles of the affidavits or ealling on him for an answer, declined to examine him. When the examiners, after examination, refused to grant a certificate, there was an appeal by petition to the Judges, to be heard before three judges in Serjeants'-inn. But he (Mr. Collier) doubted whether this could be treated as a refusal to grant h certificate, as it seemed rather a refusal to examnine. Mr. Justice ERLE said the examiners were to examine into the articles and service and the fitness a7..l capacity of the clerk to be admitted (6th and 7th Victoria, cap. 73, sec. 15). Lord CAMr-BELL said he thought it must be supposed that the examiners had refused the certificate, and suggested that the proceeding by petition was to be preferred Mr. Justice ERLE.-We act on the princlple that the examiners had examined.

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WEnn?MsT, Nov. 21. KNOX V. BUSHELL. tOuc7zg,3 'm Isa"co, MkZw/wdema8 Term.) s nii cause was triec at Utiildhall before Mr. Jnstice Cresswell oni Saturday last. It was an action for money lenb and money Faid. The defendant pleaded that he was never iDdebtea. The defendant, it xppeared,was a merchant at the Cape of Good Hope, and had a partner, one Mr. Denny, in London. In April, 1855, the defendant sent his wife, children, and -,ue servants to Lond.n, and they afterwards visited Dover. Iie Lave his wife 200l. and credit on his partner in London for :501. per mnouth. Before, ho.vever, she reached england the house failed, and sbe never got more than 201 fromn Denny. In November, 1855, ahe having heard from ber husband that she was to go back to the Cape. and, wantijng money, applied to the plaintiff, who was her inbe hy marriage. She had then paid onehalf of her passage money back so the Cape, which she would forfeit if she did not go. The plaintiff, under these circnunstances, advanced her 59f., onut of which sum 311. was Ipaid by her to the brokers of the ship, in order to complete the passage mnoney, and the rest of the 591. was used by her in paying tradesmen's bills, &c. There were letters from the defendant to Denny showing that his vwife came to England with his consent, and was also returning by his desire. The learned judge at the trial was of opinion that there was no evidence to go to the jury that the defendant's wife had authority to borrow the 591., and the plaintiff was nonsuited. Mr. Serjeant SHEE now moved for a new trial on the ground of misdirection, citing " Harris v. Lee," P. Williams a Reports, p. 482- and " Stephenson v. Hardy," 2d William Blackstone's ieports. The COURT was of opinion that what occurred did not amount to a constructive authority to advance the money, and refused the rnle. Rule refased. KENDALL V. ALISON.

This was a rule to enter a verdict for the defendant, pursuant to leave reserved by Mr. Baron Watson, at the trial on the last Northern circnit, under the following eiroumstances:-The plaintiff brought three horses to the station of the defendants, and paid the fare, signing a tioket cont7ining the following memorandum:-" This ticket is iossed on the condition of the owner undertaking all risks of conveyance whatever, and loading and urloadLng, as the company will not be responsible for any injury to live stock conveyed on their line of raiiway," or words to that effect. The horses were injured to the extent of 251., in consequence of some latent defect in the truck provided for their conveyance by the servonts of the company, and the questions raised by this rule were-first, whether the terms of the memorandum embraced such a case; and, seeondly, if they did, whether the conditIons so Imposed on the plaintiff by the defendants was a reasonable and proper one within the provisions of the Railway and Canal Navigation Act.

COURT OF BANKRUPTC, Banghal&tred, Nov. 24. ILN RE MICEIAEL BAES. (Before lfr. CommiMiOner HOLROYD.) mno bankrupt was a sewed muslin warehonoman, of Watling-atreet. His accounts extend from January, 1854, to October, 1857, and contain the following items :-Dr.- Unsecured creditors, 9,8361.; liabilities, 16,3971. Cr.- Property, 2,1791.; good debtors, 1,4411.; doubtful, 1,6201. - losses, 5,5681. The item of liabilities includes 1,2941. on bils which should be paid by other parties as held by the City Bank. These biUs are acoepted by numerous parties, including the foUowing names :-Bosquet, Hopperton Howell, Payton, Popham, and Cappell; also 2,3011, on various bills held by S. F. Stephens, and which inolude acceptances by Bosquet, Hopperton, Popham, Noakes, Cappell, and Tompsetb; also 12,8011 on biUls acoepted for H. W. Walacoe, of Glasgow. The proofs against the bank. rupt's estate include one by the Western Bank of Scotland for 12,1491. on bankrupt's acceptances in favour of T. and W. Wallace; also 2,9991. by the Western Bank of Scotland on the bankrupt's acceptances in favour of D. and J. Macdonald. This was a meeting for the last examination of the bankrtupt. Mr. Bagley apeared for creditors; Mr. Murray for the assignees; and . Reed for the bankrupt. The bankrupt, examined by Mr. BAGLEY, said there were liabilities on his balance-sheet to a very large amount. They arose on accommodation acceptances. He accepted chiefly for two Scotch houses. One of those houses had notfailed, but had suspended payment. Both had suspended payment His acceptances for Wallace and Co. amounted to 12,80]1.-all accommodation acceptances. Htis acceptances for Macdonald and Co. amounted to 4,5671., all for goods. He had accepted for the accommodation of Macdonald and Co., but he ceased to do so in February last. All these accommodation acceptances bad run off. It was not intimated to him that the banks had ref used to discount his acceptances, but that they desired the amount to be reduced. After that he did no' accept any more for Macdonald and Co. Macdonalds paid him no commission for obtaining acceptances for thems. They paid him commission for the acceptances he gave thenm himself-I per cent. This had been in operation for two years. He thought his commission from MIacdonald and Co. amounted to from 6001. to 7001. during these two years, and it appeared In his balance-sheet as part of his profit,. The acceptances he obtained from other persons for Macdonalds' accommodation were not large, but those persons were paid a commission. He arranged the rate of commission 'with those persons from 1 to I per cent.; it varied. Rie obtained some acceptances from MissBosquet, who keot a shop in Regent-street. He thought she was now in his service or employment. He believed the stock in her shop belonged to his estate. He set her up in that shop to sell some stock he had. MLss Bosquet was not entitled to anything for accepting. It would have gone into that concern, and would therefore bavo become his. She accepted four bills in blank. Possibly she did not know the amount, and he did not know it. He forwarded the bills after she accepted them. He also got Mr. Hopperton, of Oxford-streel, to aecept bills for Macdonald and Co. He was to have al allowance in his rent, instead of a commission. He (bankrupt) let him the house, having an interest in the lease. Hopperton accepted six biUls at his instance in blank also. He would have been paid a commission had Macdonald continued in business T4e did not know how much Hopperton accepted for, because the buls were in blank. Ropperton is now insolvent with those biUs. The bills would make him insolvent. He knew a Miss Howell who was now with Miss Bosquet in Vigo-street. She was asslsting Miss Bosquet. He got her also to accept four bills for Macdonald. They were in blank, and he therefore did not know the amounn. She was not paid, he thought. If ahe had been paid it would have gone to Miss Bosquet, or into that concern. There were rwo other bills he got discounted for Macdonald, accepted by a person named Pophara-small bills. Popham was a man having an account with him, and lived at Dalston. He was a cap manufacturer. He did not pay him for his acceptances. Once he thought he did. Hegavo him 61. on one occasion for acceptances. It was 1 per cent. These were all that were accepted for Macdonald. He accepted for Wallace, and was now liable on those acceptances for about 1°,0001. They paid him a commission about two years ago, but they had ceased from that time. They would have paid him had he applied. He did not accept for thenm under any agreement with them, as he did for Macdonald. When they did pay him it was 1 percent. He had accepted for WaUace during the last two years about 20,0001. This included the 12,0001. He got acceptances for them from all the persons he had named as accepting for Macdonald. Wallace's house, however, did not draw in blanks. There were no other parties who accepted for Wallace. Knew H. sand D. Hazil, of Hackney. Never knew that they accepted for either Macdonald or Wallace, nor did they for him or any one at his instance. He knew a Mr. Wagstaff. He got one acceptance from him a long time ago, but none lately. He did not know whom he accepted it for. He got it to get it discounted for a Mr. Boone, a draper in Hanway-street. He was not paid for getting this bUl, nor did he pay Wagstaff. Wagstaff did it to oblige him. He did not know a firm of Jobnston and Co., not even by name, and never had any bills accepted in that name. He knew Mr. Cappell, of Uutter-lane. He had not any transactions with him for a long time, and no accommodation transactions. He sold him goods and drew for them. Some of those bills were running now. They were not renowed bills. Macdonald and Co. are put down in his balance-sheet as creditors for 4,0001. odd. This appeared in his ledger, and he had taken credit for his commnission. They advaneed him cash and goods. He reduced their debt last year about 1,5001. by paying such of the bills as he conveniently could, and Macdonald retired the others. They made him no cash advances since last September, but they had done so previously when he asked them, and not always for the purpose of taking up the accommodation paper. He owed Wa31ace 1,0031. for goods, and had accepted for the amount of 12,0001. After a short re-examination by Mr. Reed an adjournment was ordered. LIT RE COLONEL BURRO'WS WILLCOCKS A"MUrLV SLEICH. The bankrupt was described as a newspaper proprietor, of 253, Strand. This was a meeting for the proof of debts and choice of assignees. The petitioning creditor is Mr. Stevens, solicitor of 18, Adam-street, Adelphi, in respect to professional services rendered to the bankrupt, arising out of his intend#d Parliamentary connexion with one or other of tbe boroughs of Midhurst, Leominster, and Boston. Mir. YOUNG (on behalf of Major Walker) doubted whether proceedings uender the adjudication of bankruptcy would be valid, There had been a sequestration of the bankrupt's estate in Scotland. The bankrupt, however, had failed to establish the requisite 40 days' residence in Scoiland, and the sequestration had lapsed, but not uttil after the present adjudication had been maade. The CO-MMSSIONERt intimated a strong opinion that the bankruptcy would be maintained. If Mr. Young, however, thought otherwise the proper course was to proceed by a petition to set aside the adjudication. Mr. NORTON, for the bankru t, objected to a proof for 6001. by Major Walker. The bankrupt had sold Major Walker a newspaper, The British ,Army Gazette. Msjor Walker subsequently brought an action for the recovery of the purobase-money. The bankrupt being at the time i expectation of obtaining a seat in Parliament very unwisely consented to a judge's order against him for 9001. That had been subsequently commuted by agreement into a lesser sum, and part oE which had been paid. Under these cirnsea- than es it was contended that the proof must be reduced to The COMMISSION-ER admitted the proof for the amount claimed, the agreement to the contrary not having been carried out, and Major Walker was appointed assignee.

He has been three times insolvent and twice bankrupt. He has also been mixed up with legal proceedings in wbich a son of Sir Joseph Paxton and others were involved. There was a further allegation that he had received 6001. from Mr. Simpson, to be applied in procuring a commission in the army, but which had not been obtained. One of his sureties was, it was alleged, passing through the Insolvent Court.

IN RE C. WARWICK. The bankrupt was a fancy dress warebouseman of Fridaystreet. His debts and liabilities are said to be between 20,0001. and 25,0001.; his assets about 56,0001. A proof was tendered against his estate by Mr. Murray on behalf of the Western Bank of Scetland for 9,0001. on bills of exchange as drawn upon the bankrupt by John Monteith, and discounted by the Western Bank. The bankrupt alleged that the bills were drawn upon him by Monteith for the tccommodation of the latter. The proof was admitted. The total amount of bills discounted by the Western Bank of Scotland for Monteith, whose estate is under sequestration in Scotland, is said to be no less than 400,0001. Mr. Middleton and Mr. Lambert, warehousemena of Bread-street, were appointed assignees.
NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE DISTRWIT COURT OF BAZKRUPTCY, Nov. 23. __ IN RE R. J. BROWVN, MERCHANT. SUDFRLTNm- I (Beforc Mfr. CoMMiMsioner ET.T.YqnN.l M s WtA ,uu Lass exam1narion or the bankrupt, an extensive merchant in Sunderland, and managing director of the Australian Auxiliary Steam Clipper Company, who failed with enormous liabilities in 3arch last. Mr. Lawrance, of the firm of Lawrance,Plews, and Boyer, London, appeared for Messrs. Clark and Murch, opposing creditors; Mr. A. J. Moore, Sunderland, for the assignses (Mr. Potts, timber merchant and 8hipowner, and Mr. Ray, timber merchant-both of Sanderlsnd); and Mr. Bagley, barriter, for the bankrupt. On Thursday and Friday special meetings In this case had been held, with a view to sertain the particular circumstances under which the bankrupt had made over, or as he alleged sold, a vessel called the Lord maidatone and her cargo of salt to James Rawlingi Willdn, his confidential clerk, for the sum of 2,0001., on the 6th of March last, only a few days previous to his suspension. Rawlins was eXamined at great length on those days, and deposed to having purchased the ship, but could recoUect nothing of the particulars of the transaction. He did not even remember where the biUl was executed, when it was executed, or who waspresent when it was attested. Norcouldherememberwhen he sent it to Liverpool to be registered, nor by -whom it was registered, nor at what period it was Yeturned to him. He had no recollection when the vessel arrived at Sunderland, but declared the vessel wS8 his, and not the bankrupt's, when it did arrive, He had given bis acceptance at 12 months, but could not remember whether it was Mr. Brown's practice to sel ships on those conditions. His inducement to purchase the vessel was the prospect of profit, aud thereby of payment, for he had not cash-to pay the 2,0001. at the time. He paid for the salt, but he could not recollect when or where, or to whom the money was paid. He took no receipt for It. When Mr. Brown aplied to the Northumberland and Durham District Bank for assistance, the directors required him to put in a statement of his property, but he (witness) could not remember seeing that statement. He had no recollection of discussing it with Mr. Phillpson, the solicitor to the bank, but could not swear he did not. The business commenced to-day by the examination of Mr. W. T. Jennngs, of the firm of Messrs. Clark and Murch, provisionmerehants, 30, Botolph-lane, London, relativetocertain transactions between them and the Australian AuxUiary Steam Clipper Company, of which body the baulrupt was managtig director. The bankrupt was then e:xamined at great length. He stated that at the time of the stoppage of the firm he was under discount 200,0001., but he could not say how much of that was connected with the district bank. The balance-sheet commenced in January, 1854, with a surplus of 10,7481. John Hunter Brown and Co. were set down there as good debtors to the amount of 15,0781. 3s. 7d.; in 1857 bad debtors for 23,9461. 12s. 10d. The transactions between him and that firm arose by accepting bills to a large amount for their accommodation. They were now passing through the Bankruptcy Court. Hodgson and Atcheson were returned good debtors in 1854 to the amount of 1091. 15s. 10d. ; and had debtors for 12,5171. in 1857. These debts were for bad bills which ho had accepted against and for advances that he had made. Hodgson and Atobeson were bankrupts. W. Harkers was returned good for 2,8001. in 1854, and as a bad debtor under the bankruptcy for 4,3561. This money lay entirely for money and goods. J. Watson was returned in 1854 as a good debtor for 32,4651., and in 1857 as a bad debtor for 23,526l. Watson was a shipbuilder at Pallion, near Sunderland. (The barnkrupt denied that Watson's Watson.)~ ~ ~ ~ thtWaso' busnee beongd t hi, o bht k ha berx partaer wiza The CoictlSnnqoI{ intimated that it rwould be as weeU if r. Lawrzance would make his observations upon the ex. amination. Mr. LAWBAuCE, after some preliminary remarks, said an adjournment was Inconvenient and, as it affected his clients, expensive, but this was a case that not only In this part of the world, but elsewhere, was looked at with interest. Was it true that the bankrupt had a capital of 10,7001. at the commencement of his business? Was it true that he started clear with the world, and was his present bankruptcy the result of circumstances to which all men In a large way of business were legitimately and naun. rally subject . Or was the bankrupt, as he (Mfr. Lawrance) contended, and as he thought he should be able to prove, a needy, reckless, and improvident trader, who went on as long as he could get assistance from the banking cornpanips, to whom he was at the time of his stoppage under discouut 200,0001.? Then the capital aecount was al-important, and especially that part of it which related to the transaction betweea Brown and Watson. Was it true that at any period of their lives Watson was indebted to him ia the sum of 32,0001. ? The bankrupt had said so, and adhered to his statement. Mr. Watson's name appeared uDpon the files of that court as having obtained a certificate in 18O1. The fact must have been known to Mr. Brown. Well, then, was it true that Mr. Brown, who seemed to pos. sess more than an average amount of shrewdness, and his partner, also a man not deficient in those qualities, trusted Mr. Watson, a newly emancipated bankrupt, with 32,0001. ? It might be that Mr. Brown had great confidence in Mr. Watson's probity, but to ask them to suppose that they trusted him with 32,0001. was drawing upon one's credulity rather too much. Was it not the rather true that Mr. Watson was nothing more nor less than a servant of Brown, paid 31. per week as wages, at the same time and under the same circumstances as other workmen, and that to all iatents and parposes this yard was the property of the bankrupt, and that Watson was put there for the purpose of superintending it ? He would not press the Court to inffict the punishment, rarely resorted to, of withbolding protection before the certificate meeting, but should simply reserve his right of opposing the certificate. The CoMmSsSIONEn said he should call upon the bankrupt to furnish him with the full particulars of all his transactions with Messrs. Wood, Spencer, and Co. ; also the accommodation transactions with Hunter Brown and Co. He would adjourn the examination until the 17th cf December.
ZDHSOL VENT DEBTOR.' COURT. Nov. 24. - LYRE MARY ANN CHRISTIAN. (Before Mr. Oommi'3,n',- P- TT- i u;case, In wmon Some serious charges against an attorney had been made, was reported in The Times of Satbu. day last. Mr. WAY appeared to-day on behalf of Mrs. Levison, one of the witnesses required to be produced, and Mr. Saunders for Mr. Olive. Mr. G. Lewis, the insolvent's present attor. ney, also appeared. Mr. Levison did not attend, and his wife swore that she did not know where he was, a separation having taken place between them on account of circumstances connected with these proceedings. Mrs. Levison was examined, and gave her evidence in a manner which induced the learned Commissioner to remark that no reliance could be placed upon her testlmony. She swore that she had repeatedly lent the insolvent and her partner money, and produced a letter signed by the latter, acknowledging a loan of 51t. in Septenmber last. Miss Christian and her partner, Miss Eonor', both swore that they did not owe one farthing to Mrs. Levison, that she bad never lent them any money nor sold them any goods ; and the latter further stated that she had written the letter produced at the dictation of Mrs. Levison, who suggested it in order to give countenance to the fictitious debt for which Miss Christian was to be arrested. Mr. Commissioner PiiiLLcPS thought the question of Mrs. Levison's conduct was not the matter for consideration upon the present occasion. Several charges had been raised against Mir. Olive, an attorney of the court, which it was necessary to inquire into. The result of the investigation was, in his judgment, that Mr. Olive, upon the evidence, must be acquitted of having been a party to the concoction of a fictitious debt to Mr. Ievison, or of having knowingly inserted In the schedule a list of fictitious debtors. He had acted improperly in having first acted as attorney for the detaining creditor, issuing the writ at Mr. Levison's suit, and then, when Miss Christian had been arrested, changing sides and becoming ber attorney. He had also acted in contravention of a rule of Court by having received 111. from the insolvent before his blll of costs had been taxed. Those, however, were minor points, and the grave ones were in respect to the insolvent's application for baiL Mr. Olive had undertaken to Ind sureties for tbe Insolvent, and aceordingly sent to her a Mr. Marshall, who demanded and received 51., of whieh 25s. went to Mr. Olive and 30s. each to the proposed sureties procured by Mr. Marshall. Subsequently to that event, and before the day apDointed for the hearing of insolvent's application for bail, Miss Christiau becamae di.- satisfed withs her attorney, aud expressed her intention to Eeok other advice. The day before the bail hearing a man3asaned Wheatoroft, a clerk to Mr. Olive, withoat his imaster's knowledge, as was sworn, wrote ~o each of thae proposed suretiea a letter which would have the certain effest ot deterring thenm fronm appearing to bail the insolvent. But, although Mr. Olive was not at the time cognizat Of this act of treachery towards his own client, he was sGoon afterwards made acquainted with it, when he made 21o remonstrance with Wheatoroft, and, utpoon being premse In this Court uponx the point, said he thought it was an "error in judgment,"P Hleret-ained Wheatoroft in his office uantil SaturdaY last. Mr, Olive was an old man, and it was stated on his behalf that he had never been complained of before. Those were circumistances which world be duly considered, but it was his (Mir. Commissioner PhilhiDs'sl intention to submit the evidence to the other members of the Court, and he would consult with them whether it was necessary to remove fr. Olive's name from the roil of attorneYS practising in this court.

Mr. BODKIN, who appeared for the prosecution on behalf of the Loedon and Westminster Bank, informed the Courb that the prisoner had formerly been aticled clerk to an attorney named atsy, and he thus had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the handwriting of a gentleman named Cotins, who ot ept an acount with the London and Westminster Bank, and also at Mesws.

The pascosxe sentenced the prisoner to sx years' penAl servitude. John Colbraltb, a determined-looking young man, was charged with feloniouly and maliciously cutting and wounding Charles Alldis, with' intent to do him grievous bodily harm. Mr. voland conducted the prosecution. The prosecutor deposed that he was one of the subwarders employedn t Ioldbath-fielasHoa of Correction, nd the prisoner at the time of the occuenoe wa confined In that prison. On the maorning of the llth of November he was standing in one of the galleries watching the prisoners as they came from their cells, i order to preveant them from communicating with each other, and he saw the prisoner come outt of his cell, bringing, s usual, the utenslr that had been placed for his use during the night with him. As he passed him the prisoner raised the cell pot, and, wRithout saying a word, strucek him a violent blow vith it on the forehead, and the effect was to r him, a he fell bask and should have dropr Ia n some of the other prisoners had not caught him. He bled very much from the wound, and he was removed to the infirmary, and he had not been able since to returnL to his dluty. OnX the day before the assault was committed he heard the risoner speak to one of his companions, and he cautioned hml wand the prisoner replied that he was not doin any harm. fe told him that he was not doing any ha hut that he was acting contrary to the rules of the prison, and he muet not do so.

POLICE. MANSION-sHOUsE.-Christian Sattler, a native of Bavaria, was brought before the LORD MAYOR, In custody of Scott, the detective officer, upon the double charge of having stolen a bag containing money and shares to the amoant of 2341. belonging to Mr. Ballantine, a stockbroker, and of having attempted to murder Charles Thain, arn active city detective, who apprehended him at Hamburg, by shooting him in the breast with a pistol when off Lowestoft, on board the Caledonia steamer, on Sunday afternoon last. Mr. A. B&llautsne.-I am a stockbroker at 4, Austin. friars. On the 2d inst. I was at the Goldea Lion, St. Ives. Hantingdonshbre. I had with me a carpet-bag, which I placed between 6 and 7 o'cloak that evening in the commercial-room of that hoteL It contained linen, various wearing apparel, transfers of Crystal Palace shares, Bank of England and country bank notes, and nearly 41. in gold and slver- the value altogether being little short of 2341. I missed my bag about a quarter to 7 the same evening, and have not seen it since. Jarvis, the deteotive officer, here exhibited and handod to Air. Ballantine some articles which had been found in the prisoner's possession by Thain, the wounded oficer. Mr.Bsllantine proceeded to say,-The51-note, breast-pin, canvae bag, and case containing two razors, now shown me, were in the carpet-bag. I applied to the police at St. Ives, and afterwards to the city police, annd had a communication with Thain, to whom I gave directions to make inquiries respecting the stolen property, I have some recollection of seeimg a man like the prisoner about St. Ives when I was there, but will not swear to him. Mr. A. Browvn.-I am superintendent of the Huntlngdonshire constabulary, and am stationed at St. Ives. I saw the prisoner there on the morning of the 2d inst., wben he asked me where he could see some Frenchmen, and I directed him to where two were working in the town. About 7 o'clock the same night I was called to the Golden Lion Inn, where I saw MAr. Ballantine, who informed me of his loss and gave me the particulars of the contents of the bag, which is now in the possession of a constable at Wisbeach. From subsequent inquiries I was able to give a description of the prisoner, I applied for the assistance of the London and Metropolitan police, and a warrant, signed by a magistrate for the county of Huntingdon, was issued for the prisoner's appeohenzlon. AY. Jarvis, the detective officer, said,-From information received at the Detective-office in the Old Jewry, I was engaged with Thain to trace the person who was supposed to have stolen the prosecutor's bag. The next day we got a handbill which had been Issued by the last witness, and traced the person therein described to the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch-street. Thain proceeded to Hamburg on the 16th inst. in quest of the prisoner. About 2 o'clock yesterday the following telegraphic message from Gravetend reached the Old Je wry and was communicated to me:- Send immediately to the sbip o aledonias. at St. Kathisne'dwharl, Liondon, tlueo men, 3erjeaut Thbsin having been sbot by the pri-oner, Cbristian Battler.' I went on board the steamer on her arrival, and saw Thain, who was suffering very much from a wound in his right breast. The captain of the steamer gave the prisoner into my custody. Thain pointed to a carpet-bag (not the prosecutor's) and a bundle containing some linen belonging to bimself. The bank-note and breast-pin identidled by the prosecutor I found in a bag given me by Thain. The razors and brushes I found in a bag which the captain gave me. Mr. Stephen Frost.-I am captain of the the Caledonia. trading between London and Hamburg. I saw Thain and the prisoner on board the Caledonia on the morning of the 21st inst. The prisoner had handcuffs on. He said he was in pain, and wished to be relieved. Thain asked me to be present while he changed the handcouffs, and I saw them changed. I allotted them a small cabin containing two bertbs, and with a door which could be looked. About 4 o'clock on Sunday afternoon Thain came aft to me and told me he had been shot. We were then about 50 miles west and by north from Lowestoft. Thain appeared very much agitated, and opened his waistcoat and shirt. I found a hole in his right side, about the size of a sixpence, from which blood was issuing. I applied the best remedies that suggested themselves. I asked the prisoner how he came to do such a thing, and he reolied that it was not intended for Thain at all; he meant to shoot himself. He added, that the officer came upon him unexpectedly, and that he had not sufficient time to conceal the pistol. I received from the chief officer a portion of metal from which a lamp had been suspended, end which had been torn from the side of the cabin occupied by Tbain and the pisoner. This had been used to break open a corner of the prisoner's box, from which I undorstand the pistol was ILaken. I received the pistol from the chief aste, and it appeared to me to have been very recently used. He also thowed mie aome baulets. When we arrived at Sheerniess I got a navy surgeon from a ship, who examined the wound in my presence. He said there was no immediate daniger; he ordered a poultice, and told us to get the wounded officer ashore as soon as pos8ibl-s. On our arrival at St. Katbarine's. wharf he was taken to tho hospital. Prifoner.-Was there not some altercation between the officer and me at thLe time of changing thle irons, and did I say anything to you at that time? Witness.-Yotn did not say anything to me. You said something to the officer. I did not witness aLny altercation. I recollect your asking to have the irons changed. Prisoner.-Do you reutember what I said at that time? Witness.-I really do not. J. Brett, the detective officer, sald,-I went on hoard the Caledonia with Jarvis, Inspector Hamilton, and Scott. I saw Thain, who showedI me a wound in his right breast. I renoved him in a cab to Guy's Hcepita]. The folltowing is the doctor's certificate as to his conantion:o ',I heeby oeertf that Chlacles Thain is a pat'ent in Gur'b Hospital from a ,mnhot wotnd, and that he is threfore Inpatrble of attenSinc towarduthe rs r A.

Whitelegger-I am an engineer, and reside at 24, Wellington-street, Manchester. I was a passenger by the Caled toma, and noticed the extreme k ridness of Thain towards the prisoner. About half-past 4 on Sundhy afternoon I saw Thain, who was lmy on the sofa in the sloon wrapped in blankets. He toldg me he had been shot by the prisoner, and was afraid he should die. He showed me a wound in his right breast a little below the nipple. I proceeded to the fore cabin, and asked the reiser if he was aware what he had done. e aaid he bad shot the offIoer. I told him he had shot him In the right breast He replied, "No, it was the left one." He then atked me in Germau if the halls had gone "fcthrugh and through." I toldhim they had not. I askedyhim i there -were more hals than onoe and he said there were two. He asked me if I thought the officer would die. I told him I did not think he would. He replied. "Then he ought to have died, for there were shota suffioient in the pistol." I toldI him he had been gtulty of a very rash act, uponi which he said the officer had not kept faith with him. Hle sa-id tbe ,fficer promised him when he came on board that he should not be Ironed, but that when he was got on hoard the handcuffs were put on him. He said ho could not look over this, and he would shoot a man like a dog who broke faith with him. I told him I was very sorry it had occurred, upon which he repRed, "I am a deist, a robber, and a murderer; I have shot the man, and I suppose I shall be tried for It." He said he had bouRht the pistol to shoot a man In Hamburg who owed him 251. He said, " I subsequently suggested to myself that I would take my own life. The officer came to me in my berth rather suddenly, and I told him the pistol would be as well in his breast as im mine." He afterwards told me that he took the pistol out of his box. The LoRD MAvoR.-Prisoner, do you wlsh to ask the witness any question? Prisoner.-No. All he says is pure Invention ; there is no ground of truth in it. His statement is false from one end to the other. I did not know where I struck the officer. it was so dark. I cannot tell In what Interest the witness comes here. I cast him adrift because I did not know him. Mr. Hodgson, the superintendent of the city police force, who has been watching the case as far as related to the attempted murder of Thain here asked for a remand for the purpose of adducing further evidence. Th e Cit MAYo.R acceded to the request, and instructed the City Solicitor to prceecute. The Court was densely crowded during the proceedings, and much sympathy was evinced, especiaUy by his brother officers, for the sad situation of Thain, who ia not only an old, but a very autive, experienced, aud intelligent detective. The balls have not yet been extracted from his body, but It Is understood that his life is not in immedeate The prisoner, who Is about 36 years of age, is a very illlooking feUow, of dark complexion, and with a strong squint In the left eye. He formerly served in the French Ancglo-German Legion, and wras stationed at Shornucliffe, since which he was convicted of robbery and imprisoned for three months at Wisbech, in the Isle of Ely. He speaks the English, Italian, French, Arablc, and Gormines MAmLBoRoOGE-sTRm.-From " G. AL H." 11. Is. received for the poor-box. WXsTTNEsT,-11. was received from "G. hL H." for the poor-box. Wosirip-sTrXEt.-Raward Jackson, an oil and colour man in Leonard-street, Shoreditch, and Anne Jackson, his wife, were charged upon remand before Mr. D'EYCoURsT with being in felonious possession of numerous expensive articles of wearing apparel, the property of the Countess of Ellesmere, and etolen, together with jewelry and other property valued in the whole at 15,0001., from her ladyship's travedlng carriage on the road from Cleveland-square, St Jamea's, to the Great Western Railway. The prosocution, which had made but slow progres, bad been hitherto left in the hands of the police, no protessional gentleman being retained to conduct it, though Mr. Lewis has throughout appeared for the defence, but yesterday MHr. umphreys, of the firm of Humphreys, c ton, and Morgan, was instructed to prosecut'e, and stated.-I have now the honour to appear in this case, Sir, on behalf of the prosecution, and find it necessary to ask for a remand upon what I think you will consider very satisfactory grounds-the ground, that is, that we have now reeeived information of an oacial character that one of the persons actually engaged in the commission of this extensive robbery can be produced before you, though, notwithstanding the commendable diligence of the poliee, there has not heretofore been a possibility of so doing. The delay In this case is solely attributable to there not having been prevnous profesdonal assistance, but at the next exaruination I shall in all probability be able to conclude the case, and in the meantime wiU call two witnesses, whose evidence will be seen to be important. Mary Anne Eunt.-I am^ a widow, residing in Paulstreet, Finsbury, snd carry on the business of a dressmaker. I recognize the articles now shown me (a frock and pelisse) as things I made for the female prisoner about a twelvemonth ago. I made them from a lady's dres3 she gave me for that purpose, and the sleeve produced is also a part of the dress from which I made this rock and pelisse. (The articles produced were sworn to by one of the Countess's servants as forming one of her Ladyship's dresse) Mr. Edmund Collingridge.-I am a refiner in Wildernessrow, Clerkenwell, and know the male prisoner, whom I have seen at my premises once or twice. In October, 1856, he called and offered me a diamond for sale; it was a single stone, cut, but not set, and I paid him 161. for it. I have sold it, and did so the same month I bought it. That was the first time I saw him, and he told me he had another diamond, but did not wish to sel it then. A. short time afterwards he caUed upon me again and offered me a gold duplex watch for sale; he wanted 141, for that, but sold it to me for 121., and I have that watch by me now. Three months ago he called a third time, and showed me'another diamond. Diamonds had then gone hp considorably in price, and I offered him 181, mond, but he wanted more, and I did not therefore buy it. Cross-exanilned.-He told me where he lived, and be had been recommended to me by a person who also stated where he lived. Mr. D'EYNCOURT.-Did you ask him from where he had got the property ? Witness,-No; I did not conceive that it was my place to do so. fr. Humphreys.-The ring also you bought,-I do not ask you where or to whom you sold it, but you will acquaint the officer with the particulars?9 Witness.-Certainly; I will do se readily. lr. Humphreys,-Very well; and I now, Sir, ask for a remand. Mr. Lewis.-Of course I do not object to a remand, as my learned friend states he has further evidence to produce; but I must say, as regards this man's wife, that I reaUy think she ought to be allowed to be at large. She is not found to be in possession of any of this property till nine months after it has been stolen, and there is but one receiving after all. Mr. D'EYINCOURT.-No, it is Proved that she took a most actlve part in this matter, and that she told repeated falsehoods about it. It is for her husband, of course, to prove his lawful possession of this property, but there is a strong prwi4facic case of guilt against her, and I must, therefore, have bail in the same amount for her as before. The wife WAS, therefore, liberated upon bail, but the husband, for whom bail was refused, was committed. TnAss. -Messrs. HlaU and Boyd, sugar refiners in Ratcliff-highway, St. George's-in-the-East, appeared upon an adjourned summons, which charged them with having farnaces on their premises so constructed as not to bmun or consume their own smoke. A long inquiry took place, in the course of which it was stated that the defendants were desirous of remedying the nuisance complained of, and they requested to be allowed three months to perfect their arrangements. The sum of 10 guineas costs was paid, and Mr. SELFE allowed a postponement of the case for two months. SOUTHWAi,-Jane Sell, a young woman about 20 years of age, was charged with stealing a vast number of bonnets, the property of various milliners in different parts of the metropolis. The court was crowded with persons who had been victimized by her. The first witness examined was Louisa Hildreth, living with her uncle, a milliner, at No. 2, Frederick-place, Old Kent-road, She stated, that on Thursday afternoon the prisoner came to their shop and said that she was a dress. maker, and that a lady residing at Walworth had given her orders for bonnets as well as dresses, and that she thought It would be better for her to purchase the former ready. made. She selected five, and they were put in a box, w.hen the prisoner asked to have them sent with her to Camdenstreet, East-lane, Walworth. Witness went with her as far as the Camden-head publichouse, when the prisoner took the bonnets from her, saying that the lady lived there, and requesting her to wait outside for her a few minutes. The prisoner then entered the publichouse with the bonnets, but she never returned. After waitiDg nearly an hour she entered the house and ascertained she had passed through the place, there being a back entrance, and that the landlady knew nothing of her. Witness then returned home, and gave information to the police. The bonnets were worth about 31., and had not been seen since. John Young, a lad employed at a miUiner's in the Walworth-road, said, that the prisoner came to their shop on Wednesday afternoon last and told a similar story. Foar bonnets were packed up for her, and witness accompanied her to New Oxford-street, where she stopped at a publichouse, and taking the bonnets from him asked him to wait outside a few minutes for her, as the lady who wanted the bonnets resided there. HIe waited 20 minutes, and finding she did not come out he went Inside and asked the landlady about her, when ne was informed that she had a glass of ale and passed through, there being a back entrance. Six other cases of a similar Idnd where she had received upwards of 20 bonnets were proved against her, Sho was, however, stopped in her career by a tradesman in the Waterloo-road, whom she took as far as Covent-gardenmarket, and then wauted to gct possession of five bonnets to take into a publichouse. Fle, however, suspected her, and having he"rd ot the other robberies he called a conatable and gave her into onstody. Mr. BuroruA committed her for trial in a11 the cases.

ARcHDsAcox DEnsox's CASE.-The case of the Venerable Archdeacon Denison, whilch has been now for some years before the pablic, will be revived in the course of a day or two before the Judicial Committee of Privr Council. It will come on In its next stage in the form of an appeal by the Rev. Joseph Ditcher (the promoter of the suit against the Archdeacon) against the decision of Sir John Dodson, the Dean of the Court of Arches. It will be remembered that the case was, in the first instanrce referred to a commission ; that afterwards it was heard before the Archbishop of Canterbury at a court specially held at Bath (the bishop of the diocess not being competent; to hear It, in consequence of being the patron of the livings held by the Archdeacon); and that at length, after being debated in various forms, it found its wav into the Court of Arches, where Sir John Dodson disposed of it on an entirely technical point-namely, that the suit was not commenced within two yeors after the commission of the alleged offence (that of preaching unsound doctrine ia Wells Cathedr), according to the provisions of the Church Discipline Act, imder which the proceedings were taken. Sir John Dodson held that the issuing of the com . mission was no part of the proceedings within the meaning of the Act; that, putting aside the commission, more than. two yeas elapsed betwveen the commission of the alleged offence and the proceedings taken before the Archbishop, and that therefore everything that had been done was nill and void. Against this deision Mr. Ditcher now appeals. If the Judicial Committee decide that Sir John Dodson's views are correct there will be an end of the case, which will fall to pieces on a technical point of law; but if it be decided, on the other hand, that the proceedings were commenced within the prescribed time (the commission being part of them) the sentence of deprivation of his preferments pronounced by the Archbishop of Canterbury upon the Archdeacon will stand. This deoision wvil in that case be appealed against on its merits by Archdeacon Denison, and some months more will probably elapse before the intricate question is finaUy settled. tAdvertlsementi.-The Rev.

ZMIITlTAY AND NA VAL INTELLIGENOE. In consequence of the crowded state of the several bar. ralcks at Chatham, caused by the constant arrivals of troops for the purpose of joining the Indian depOts at that garrison, arragements are in progress by the authorities at the Waroffice for the removal from Chatham of ths whole of the depOts of regiments on the Bombay establlshment, consist. Ing of the depOt companies of tho 18th Royal Irish, under the comm=nd of Captain G. W. Stacpoole; the 51st light Infantry, commanded by Captain C. Acton; the 64th, in eharge of Brevet-Ma,jor W. J. Chads; the 83d, commanded by Captain E. W. Bray; and the 86th, uwder the command of Captain H. W. P. Welman, which will reduce the num. ber of troops ar the garison of Chatham by about 1,000 men of all ranks. The station to which the above depbts are likely to be sent Is Fermoy, where a dep6t battalion of the East India regiments has been formed. A portion of tho depots, comprising the 1st and 2d battalions at Chatham, will, in all probability, be handed over to the commandant of the 3d battalion, it being the intention of the General Commanding-in-Chief to keep the depOts of those corps in the Bengal Presidenoy as much as praciicable together at Chatham. Captain Saunders, ia command of a company of Royal Artillery, consisting of Major Davis, Lieutenants Pitt, JIaunsell, and Isaasson, and LO non-commissioned officers and gunners, left Woolwich garrison yesterday morning for duty at Northampton. Two companies of Royal Artillery embarked yesterday at Woolwlch pier on board the screw ,steam transport Leopold, Captrin Lining, for KurracheeNo. 2 and No. 7 Companies, 11th Battalion. No. 2 Company consists of Captain Bayly, Captain Johnson, Lieutezrants Elton, Storey, and Wortham, and 120 non-cominlssloned officers and gunners; and No. 7 Company-of Major Grant, Major Hope, Lieutenants Rideout, Budd, and Arbuthnot, and a similar number of non-commissioned officers and gunners. In consequence of the heavy fog on the river, the departure of the Leopold is uncertain. The promotion of Colonel Brown, Comrmandant of Wool. vich Marine Garrison, to the rank of Major-General wa yesterday announced at Woolwich. The Calypso, 18, attached to the reserve at Chatham, is to be commissioned at that port, and will have a complement of 185 men, including officers and Marines. The Aboona steam transport arrived at Portsmouth from Ireland yesterday with the second battalioa of the 3d Bufib, vho landed at the dockyard and proceeded thenoe to quarters at Canterbury. The American ship Ocean Steed arrived at Portsmouth from Calcutta, last from Manritius, yesterday. She spoke the United States' ship-of-war Portsmoath, in lat. 28.33, long. 34.40, all well, from whom she brought a small maiL 'We have Port Louis papers to the 25th of August by this arrivaL The court-martial on Lieutenant Burnaby, of Hex Majesty's ship Juno, on the charges preferred 'by Captaiu Fremantle, of that ship, which we published yesterday, terminated on board the St. Vincent yesterday evening. The prosecution opened on Monday morning, after the detention of the prisoner wnder arrest for 17 months. On Captain Fremantle being ordered by the President to " state to the Court what you know relative to the charges," he replied, " I know nothing. I am prepared, Sir, with your permission, to abandon this prosecution. I am prepared to indemnify the prisoner by 'corporeal pains."' The Court at this point stopped the prosecutor and cleared the cabin. On Itsbeing reopened the President said,-"The Court has been cleared to give you time to consider. You have been sworn," &c. The prosecutor replied, " I feel myself totally unable at the present time to collect my ideas to give the required evidence as to matters which transpired so long ago, I feel so impressed that my views of the service have been mistaken and wrong." Presideat.-Captain Fremantle, you are there as a witness, and must answer a plain question. Captain Fremantle. -There is a confusion in my head, and I oannot proceed. President.-ltespecting what has been said about the views ? Captain Fremantle.-I feel so confused that I cannot attempt to recount upon oath with any degree of fidelity. and, agreeably to the words of the oath, what transpired so long ago. I request the presddent will allow me to sit down. The Court here informed Captain Fremantle that in consequence of his statements of his inability to give evidence he might retire and give evidence " by and by," when the Cout bad examined the other witnesses. The ease then proceeded, and the prosecution closed at 1 p.m. yesterday, when the prisoner was graated two hours to prepare his defence. The prisoner read a clear statement, and put in his certi. ficates of service since joiningthe navy,allof whichwere highly meritorious. Withrespect to the first charge he urged "that the former part of it related to an alleged contempt towards his captain by performing an impertinent aud provoking action. It was obvious that, as no other person was present when he received the intimation from Captain Fremantle that visitors should leave the ship, he had no means of Calling any witness to prove that his manner was then as it had been on all occasions-respectful to his captain, and he could only declare upon his honour as an officer and a gentleman that he had not the remotest Intention of performing any action that could be considered contemptuous or disrespectful; had it been either the one or the other it seemed strange that Captain Freemantlo never put him under arrest until foar months afterwards. With reference to the second part of the first charge he would call witnesses to orove that he caused the visitors to leave the ship (it appeaied there had been a play enacted on board on the day or evening in question) as soon as the courtesy due to ladies would enable him to do so, and that other persons for the shore left the ship in the same boat as his friends. With regard to the second charge he begged to state that, having reported himself on his return from leave to the captain, the captain then having made no reference to his returning to his duty, he (the prisoner) was anxiously expecting the whole evening to receive a message in reference to it, and, not having done so, at about 9 p.m. he went to the captain's cabin to ask his directions, which he did in a respectful manner. Captain Fremantle informed him he did not intend to answer his question; that he (the captain) found himself perfectly able to carry on the duties of First ieutenat, and it agreed with his health, and he should continue to do so. With regad to the painted handkerchief, he (prisoner) considered it to be improper, and therefore felt it his duty to report it. With reference to the third cIharge, prisoner admitted bein mistaken with regard to the time (having overstopped his leave 10 minutes, having no watch with him) not deeming it so near sunset, and that he was therefore unfortunately too lato by 10 minutes in his return to the ship, for which casualty he wrote a letter of explanation and apology to Captain Fremantle. With reference to the fourth charge, the prisoner submitted to the Court that, froum the evidence already adduced, it had been shown he had justifiable grounds for a remonstrance to the Commander-in-Chief; but he should further substantiate the point by showing that the surgeon of the ship had repeatedly represented to the captain that his health required relaxstion on shore, and that those representations were not attended to, and he therefore left the Court to judge whether the covering letter enclosing the open letter to the Comimander-in-Chief could be in the least degree hasty or disobedlient. George Strickland, gun-room steward, Lieutenant Brad. $haw, and Surgeon Nicholls then gave evidence, at the expiration of which time [5 p.m.) the Court adjourned until this morning at 9. The Goliath, 80, which has been for some time under repairs at Chatham in order to be oonverted into a screw steamer, is nearly completed, and will be taken out of dook early in the ensuing month, when she will bo navigated to Sheerness to be fitted with her machinery, which will be of 400-horse power.

STBEET NUZSANfESv. TO THE 1DITOR OF TEE TIMS. Sir,-Your leading article of lovember 10 on the subject of street nuisances wfil be hailed with delight, with thankfulness, and gratitude by the innumerable safferers of London. But, Sir, let us entreat you not to let the matter drop; do not desert us niow you have again come forward to the rescue,and in your admirably-written article have so forcibly represented the miseries inflicted by this most crying eviL Let it be the beginning of a serious agitation, for only by agitation in this country can any remedy, it appears, be applied to the most flagrant abuses. No, Sir, not even the forcible and powerful language you employ can sufficlently describe what we women and mothers of families suffer from the nuisance of street musidc Men are comparatively beyond Its xeach. Employedfrom home in active pursuits, they do not, they cannot conceive what we who sit at home, many without stirring for 21 hours, endure from the incessant torment. The avocations of life can hardly go on under the inSic. tion; in the midst of family prayers we are startled from our knees by the braying of an early brass band, our own private devotions having been previously interrupted by a still earlier organ beginning at half-past 8 o'clock. This day from 9 o'clock to 12 a.m., at which hour I write, six organs, two Punches, and two brass bands have already sent forth their dismal or discordant sounds without inter. mision, to the despair and misery of the household. Sir, it is not possible to endure this nuisance ! The edaucation of our children, which requires a certain tran. quillity, is unceasingly interrupted; reading and lessons are saspended, the practising of music or singing constantly put aslde, from'the impossibiUty of struggling against the discord that pursues us from without. The rich and influential, who would, perhaps, be lis. tened to, do not care to move in the matter, or, what is worse, many among them are found to encourage the nuisance. They come to town bht for a short time, inhabit large and well-built rooms, with plate glass windows, shut. ting out all sound; bat we more humble individuals, dwel. ling in small houses without a refuge in all those luxuries, are at the mercy of all the vagrants who infest our streets. No, Sir, I repeat, no man can be aware of what we women sufferfrom this external torture. Family sorrows, enfeebled nerves, the care and instruction of many children, render a London life at all times a trying one to many among us, and when, in the raidst of these, the incessant jarring of thi miserable street music has to be endured it is almost an intolerable burden. If it is said that this is an amusement for the poor, to the poor let it be confined; let them play in the small back streets and lanes where thoso most do congregate, and where they offer no hindrance to the pursuits of manual labour, and let those districts be exempted where sederntar7 occupations and intellectual pursuits are carried onl. Surely, Sir, in this matter it is reversing the usual order of English proceedings, which is that the many should not suffer for the gratification of the few; for in the part of the town where we are chiefly martyrized it is the few-the street loiterers, idle maid and men ser. vants, waiters, and shopboys, who profit by and encourage this vagabond race, to the distress and misery of the many Inhabitants who line the street. In no other city in the world would this state of things be tolerated. There are places set apart in other countries for the congregation of itinerant performers, where those who like may assemblo to hear and enjoy; but in London only are crowded streets and noisy thoroughfares rendered more crowded and more noisy by sach unnecessary and distracting additions as herds of Italian organ boys, German bands, bones, harpists, balladsIngers, and Scotch fiddlers. Surely, Sir, a limit at least might be set to the hounrs in which the torture Is inflicted. Bands and organs should be forbidden to enter the streets before 11 or ]2 o'clock, or to remain after 6 or 7 at night. Seven or eight hours of so intolerable a nuisance will amply test our powers of endurance, whereas under the present state of things from half-past 8 in the morning till 9 and hall-past 10 at night give about 18 hours of hard suffering to the unfortunate victims house bound and unable to escape. May you, Sir, be induced to carry on with a high hand thegood work you have so benevolently begun; let not your powerfulpen lose itsenergyin writing down one of the greatest miseries, one of the most oppressive tyrannies of the day. You wzill confer a boon upon the community at large, and receive the th&nlEc anA hi icc,o .,f o A SUFFERING WOMAN.
FROOM v. ASHDOWN AND OTHEBS. TO TEE EDITOR OF TEE TIIES. Sir,-In your report of this case yon have attributed certain expressions to Mr. Justice Etle which, if unexplained, are calculated to operate prejudicially to myself as plaintiff in the action. The fact as proved at the trial was that the company was projected and very nearly formed long before I was retained as their solicitor. In no sense was I a projector, though it is true that, so far as regards the defend. ants Ashdown and Young, I was in some degree a party to their joining the direction. All the other defendants had joined the undertaking before it was introduced to me. I have, it is true, been defeated in the action, it being the opinion of their Lordships that the defendants were not incdividually liable, and that I must look to the company i4 its corporate capacity. To that judgmen' I must submit. But this case is another illustration of the glorious uncertainty of the law; for, having at the ontset brought my action against the company, to which action the company pleaded its non-liability, I was advised by a special pleader of the highest standing in the law that I had no remedy against the company in its corporate capacity, but that the defendants were personally llable. I may add that besides the 2001., the subject of the present action, I have never received from the defendants, either as a company or individuals, one shUlling on account of my professional services or the fees paid out of pocket for registration, and with tw.o exceptions I believe the directors have not to this day paid up any part of their qualification. Ulpon the above statement I think it will be manifest that M~r. Justice Erle's observations are not applicable to me. I remain. Sir. von-rnA;n an CHARLES P. FROOM,
Thn DisTsEss IN \-Nw YORK.-The behaviour of the unemployed in New York, we are sorry but not sur. rised to find, has been very different frora that of our own dtstressed operatives in England. Their leaders are evidently political or Socialist fanatics, and their demeanour reminds us rather of France and Germany than of sober England. The old Socialist warery of the terrible days of June has been revived, and the claims put forward by the agitators appear, if we may judge them by the meagre reports which have reached us, to be those of the communistic theorists of France. This is by no meansstrange. At least one half of the poulation of New Yorki consists of foreigners. Eng sh, Germans, French, and Irish-espeoially the least respectable of the emigrants from the three latter nations-congregate there in vast numbers. The political maxims current among them are the democratic notions imported by the very dre"s of the political refu ees; by the French fugitives from tile battle in which the Communistic rebellon-the last desperate rising of the riff-raff of society against the party of order-was put down by, a Republican Dictator in the name of the Republic;- by, the followers of Frost, Mitchell, and Meagher; and by German demo. crats, whose theories respecting the origin of society have lsaned them in prncilples opposed to al social order. "VWork or Death" is not the motto of men who deserve attention or consideration ; and it implies a claim to which society cannot possibly accede without sapping the very foundations on which its actual constitu. tion rests. The condust of the " unemployed"' has in many cases been such as we might expect from their watchword, and both the police and the military authorities have been compelled to make strenuous preparations for resisting any violent attempts to pillage provison stores and plunder the public treasures. It may be hoped that the effectual precautions taken will prevent the wicked and insane attempt; and that the work provided by the municipal authorities wil avail at least to lessen the terrible distress at present prevailing. These sufferers deserve the more compassion that the misfortune is in no way traceable to themselves, except in their having omitted in times of. prosrity to lay by aught against a rainy day. This is apPily an error to which the working classes are everywhere and always prone ; and it would be some consolation to those who vash them well if the occurrence of such calamitous seasons as the present would teach them a little more prudence and foresight. Till they learn these virtues not only have they no olaim as of right upon society in their times of distrews, but they may hoassurd that all benevolent schemes of relief wil be merely partial and temporary in their operation. They alone can work out an effectual salvation for themselves, and only by their own Improvemenb in wiEdom and fore. thought can their condition be permatently amended,- Afanditr Guarclian.

WOLVERHAyMPTON Ain STAFFORDSHIRE BAIK. WOLVEREAMPTON, Nov. 24. Afterthemeeting of the shareholders, reported in our columns yesterday, committees of the sbareholders and creditors waited together upon the directors at the bank. After a discussion which lasted over two hours the shareholders' committee returned to an adjourned meeting of that body, held at the Swan Hotel, and reported the nature of the interview that they had bad with the directors. After some further discussion, the meeting unanimously de. termined upon a resolation which appeared to meet the views of both the creditors and the directors. The resolution was made the subject of a circular, which is in the hands of the printer today (Tuesday). It is as followvs:- " Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Bank. Nov. 23. *I beg to call your attentlon to the annexed resolution, pased at an adjourned meeting of the shareholders held this eTening.

WYv;N- "ThatItsessentialfor th continuance of the bank on a safe and permanent bagss that a great effort be made by the shareholders geneally to do aU they can to place sufficient funds in the bands of the executive, and that for that paroose a subscriptIon list be opened and each shaseholder be requested to ub.e ribe an amount (In addL Uon to the call of £5 per abure), for which notes of the bank shall be given, payable in Itwo or three years, bearing ILteiest at £5 per cent. Such notea to Ile redeemcable by the bank on givirg two month notice, or such notioe to be reoelved In payment of any future calls should any such become neocesary. ".. LEIGH, Chaimarn." Yesterday morning the meetlng of the shareholders adjourned from the previous Thursday -was hela at the Swan Hotel, The meeting was very numerously attended. Shortly after 10 o'clock Mr. George Robinson, on behalf of the directors, carme from the ante-room in which the board was sitting and said that there had been some mistake about the time of the meeting, the directors supposing that the hour of assembling was 1; they would, however, be ready to meet the creditors in another quatter of an hour. No difficulty was found in spending the 15 minutes in animated talk. When the proceedings ooramenced Mr. Alexander :Horderm, the chairman of the directors, took the chair. Mir. HARTLEY explained that at a meeting of a number of shareholders who represented 200,0001, held on Friday, a committee was appointed which might be termed a self-oonstituted committee. Nevertheless, he had to say that in anythingtthat they had done nothing had been compronmsed. Et was now competent for this meeting of the whole body to elicit a committee. The one to which he had referred was simply a committee pro tem. Mr. G. ROBINSON then read the statement of the directors, which was read on the previous day at the meeting of the shareholders, and which appeared in this journal on thAt Monday morning. He said he was not at liberty to mention the names of the firms or the individuals who had overdrawn their accouuts. It would be a breach of confidence for him to do so; but the directors had obtained information from the best commercial sources as to the capabilities of those firms to meet the payments due from them to the bank. HIe did not himself know one of them, but, as men of business, the directors had set down the doubtful cases at 10s. in the pound. No individual anad no bank in debt could proceed without their creditors would allow them to do so. The proposal that the directors now had to make to their creditors was to pay all deposits under 100,, to be paid In full-say, on the lst of January next, and to pay the other depositors in four instalments, as follows :-5s. in the pound on the lst of January, 1868; 6s. in the pound on the 1st of October, 1858; 6s, in the pound on the 1st of April. 1859 ; and s. in the pound on the lEt of July, 1859; notes to be paid over the counter on the opening of the bank. Respecting negotiating bills, the directors were not desirous of adopting that procedure; but if individual creditors were so circumstanced that it was necessary that they should have such biUls they could be obtained. He had only one other remark to make, and it had reference to the time of the second instalment. It was his deliberate opinion tbat, unless the period of nine months was allowed to elapse between the first and the second instalment, when he looked at the insolvencies that prevailed and the stagnation of the district, a shorter period could not be set down with safety to the bank and its creditors. The subject had been discussed for two hours, so desirous were the board to pay the second instalment.within six months after the first, but a salutary arrangement to that effect seemed for the present impossible. Five per cent. interest would be allowed upon the Instalments from the reopening of the bank to the end of the 18 months, even if the whole remained in tiU that time. The directors hoped that a committee would be appointed at that meeting who would represent the interests of the shareholders and aid the directors, who were only desirous of so carrying on the affairs of the bank as to realize the mutual benefit of all persons interested in the bank. The committeo would be able, on behalf of the shareholders, to investigate certain details in connexion with the working of the hbak which could not be then entered into. The directors' proposition having been set before the meeting. the board retired. Mr. ABRTLEy then proposed, " That Mr. W. 0. Foster, M.P, should preside." The proposition was carried by acclamation. The CItAIRSIAN commenced his remarks by addressing the meeting as " brother creditors." If it were possible for them to come to some arrangement for carrying on the bank, it would be most desirable for the interests of the district to do so. (Hear, hear.) They had matters now to discuss which hoehoped would be discussed with calmness. The two leadingquestions were time and undoubted security. ( A pplause.) T he time,of course,to some of them was of litble importance; but to others of the greatest importance. (Rear.) I The forming of a committee from their body was the principal business for that day's consideration. That committee should be left by the larger body of the creditors to go Into matters of detail with the directors that could be better disposed of by thom than by that meeting ( bear, hear.) The 100.0001. proposed to be raised by the directors was a very liberal offer on their part, and onethat perfectly satisfied himself. If the shareholders would comewforward in a slmilar liberal manner greater satisfaction would of course be given. (Hear, hear.) it was not, he thought, unlikely that the shareholders would display an equally liberal spirit. Legally, the directors could not be called upon for so large a sum, and the utmost that, according to their deed, the shareholders could be required to pay for a year was 50,000o. But as the directors had gonebeyond the point of assistance at which they might legally stop, perhaps the shareholders would not refuse to follow their good example. (Applause.) Mr. BOLTON, solicitor, said that at a recent meeting of the shareholders some of them were disposed to pay a call in excess of their legal one. (Hear, hear.) The CHAIRmA vwas glad to hear that. Mr. FOSTER then repeated the proposition of the directors, and solicited the meeting to discuss it coolly and deliberately. (Applause.) MIr. HARTLE said that Perhaps he might now refer a little more fully to the course which the committee he referred to had taken, Upon the presentation of the statement of the directors the committee's attention was called to it. He did not remember the precise figures, but in round numbers there was a statement of 244,0001. of bills in hand; there were also 422,0001. debit balances. Although some of those bills might be doubtful, those two items the elements of a resuscitation of the bank. (Hear, hear. And he had a feeling at the time, and perhaps 1! out of 20 of theta had the same feeling, tha.t a bank closing with 244,0001. worth of bills in its hands was of Itself an admission that those bills were of little or no value. The amended statement, therefore, that there were good bills in hand to the amount of 148,0001. came upon him-came also upon many persons-with extreme sur,rise (hear, hear) that a bank should close its doors with those hills in hand, upon which no attempt, he was told, had been made to raise money. (Applause.) With regard to the estimates of the bank, he did estimate one or two estates and said to the directors,-" If that is what you estimate those estates to realize, your estimates are under mlne, and I consider your estimates safe." Beyond that he had not gone. They were told upon the authority of the directors that the estimate of the balances swasa good one, and also that the estimate of the sum of money, 422,0001. debit balances, was safe. Under these ciroum. stances, it would be a great sacrifice of public property, and also a great calamity, if this bank were allowed to go down. (Applause,) A lter somefurtherremarkss r. Hartley proPosed: " That this sacing resolve to acept she proposal of the directors for the lquidating of the aims on the bank. sabject to the directors andaharmholders comsipling with such conditions and ecurity as the committee to be appoInted on bebalf of the crditoora shall deide upon." Aldermn AxNDRE:ws seconded tbe motion, and It was carried unanimously. Mr. U. BARKER (of the Chillington Iron Company) pro. posed the rommittee referred to; and it was seonded by Mr. C0. BAGXALT. ironmaster. Both these speakers enforoed upon the committee that it should be a sine qud non of its existence that a stop should be put to previous bll l transactions at the bank, . The meeting thea adjourned,
TIE HEALTH OF LONDO-Y. (From the Weekly Eeturn of the Registrar-General.) The present return furnishes an unfavourable indication of the state of the public health. The wveekly number of deaths registered in London was In October about 1,000; in the first half of the present month it was about 1,160; and in the last week that ended on Sctturday (November 21st) the deaths rose to 1,382. During the seven weeks, to which referenco is here made, the mean weekly temperature has fallen from 55° to 440; latterly this depres3ion of temper&. ture has been rapid, while other observations on the atmos. phere have shown that it was humid in a high degree. In the 10 years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,1OL But population has increased, and for the purpose of comparison it is necessary to rats£ the average in proportion to the Increase. With this correction the average wil beoome 1,211, and it wiU appear that 171 persons died last week above the number that would have died under the average rate of mortality. Of the 1,382 deaths now retrned 390, or more than a fourth psrt, were produced by bronchial and pulmonary diseases. In addition to these, phthisis (or consumption was fatal in 159 cases, and whooping-cough carried off 53 ch51dren; croup, 17. The progress of bronchitis and pneumonia in the last four weeks is shown in the followig numbers :-From the former diseae the deaths were successively 87, 11, 152, and (last week) 227; from the latter they were 77, 115, 108, and 127. Last week bronchitis exceeded the correoted average by 124; pneumonia by only 23. In the present returns the number of deaths recorded specially under influenza Is only 9. That persons of advanced age are the principal sufferers will appear from comparing the results of last woek with those of the last week of October; for, while the deaths of young persons (under 20 years) have increased from 503 to 635, those of persons who had attained the age of 60 year1 and uprards have risen from 184 to 332, showing a much greater proportional increase. The deaths of no fewer than 13 nonagenarians are now returned; all of these aged Individuals were women, except two; two of them had reached the age of 94 years, and two the stil riper age of 97. A mate is the merchant service, aged 45 years, died on the 13th inst., on board the Dreadnought Hospital ship, of cholera. This is the only case of that disease reported in the week. Two children, aged about one year, died of croup in different families, but in the satme house, 42, Longalley, in the Shoreditch district. One died on the 12th, the other on the 13th inst.; the duration of iluess was in one case one day, in the other two days. Three children died of measles at Platastead; of 11 deaths in the subdistrict of this name six were from diseases of the zymotic character. LAst week the births of 886 boys and 864 girls,-in all 1,750 children, -were registered In London. In the 10 correspond ing weeks of the years 1847-56 tne average number was 1,468. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 30 125 in. The mean daily barometrical reading rose above 30 in. on the 7th of November, and has continued above It during the whole of the last two weeks. The higbest reading last week was 30 22 in., which occarred on Sanday. The mean temperature of the week was 442 deg., which is 18 above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by xfr. Glaisher). On Wednesday the range of temperature was 15-4 deg.; on the two following days it was only about 6 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 42-4 deg., and the difference between this and the mean temperature of tho air was 18 deg. The mean degree of humidity in the week was 93; and on Friday the humidity was equal to 100, which represents complete saturation. The mean daily temperature in the week of the water of the Thames was 4S 3 deg. The wind was generaUy in the east or south-east. There was no rain during tho week, but on Friday there were thick, wetting fogs, and great darkness frequently prevailed.
SUDDEN DEATH.-An inquest waa held last night at the King's Arms Hotel, Woolwicb, before Mr. Carttar, coroner for West Rent, respecting the death of the Rev. Sandford Connor, late Assistant-Chaplain to the Royal Artillery Garrison at Woolwich, which took place suddenly at his quarters on Sunday last. The Rev. Walter Melville Wright, one of the garrison chaplains, identified the body. A number of witnesses-friends of the deceasedhaving been examined relative to his general health and habits, all concurred in expressing a belief that his death proceeded from natural causes. Dr. Warren and the medical men who attended when first called, sad who were present when the deceased expired, testified to the hopelessness of the case from the momsent of their arrival, when they found him in a prostrate and speechless condition, The remedies which they applied-such as ammonia to the nostrils, mustard to the chest and extremities -proved of no avai, life becoming extinct about 20 minutes after their reaching him. Edward Hood the deceased's servant, deposed to his master having teen discharged from the medical sick list ou Saturday last. Since he had been in his service-11 months-the deceased had been accustomed to take a seidlitz powder occasionally before breakfast, in conseq,uence of severe constipation of the bowels. On Sunday morning he awoke him at 7 o'clock, and prepared and administered one of the powders according to his wont. The deceased previously complainedof headache. About noon he agaiu entered his room, and found him still in bed, foaming at the mouth, vomiting and bleeding from the leftnoatriL He asked him if he shoald caU in a doctor, to which he replied, "No." The witness likewise stated that his master was generally aill was often troubled with siclness, and frequently obliged to retire from the mess-room table in consequence. Asistant-Surgeon Eenrr Clifford, Royal Artillery, stated that he took deceased off the sick list on Saturday at his own request. Had heard him state that he was frequently sick after mess, suffered much from obstinate constipation, and had aseveresunstroke while serving during the late war in the Crimea, which, in his opinton, would give rise to an attack of apoplexy, the result of congestion of the brain. The Rev. James Burroughs Fenwick, at whose house the deceased had recently spent A week, considered him predisposed for sudden death, and had heard him state that he was wel aware his health was very Mrcarlons, and often referred to the late sunstroke. Eis habits of life were exceedingly temperate. Had understood that Dr. Todd, who formerly attended him, advised him to live freely. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased had died from an attack of apoplexy. THE BoriLn EXPLOSION NEAR HUDDE ISFlTLD.- In The Times of yesterday we gave an account of the explosion of a boiler at Upper Aspley, near Huddersfield. It appears that the results of the accident were more disastrous than was at first supposed. Twelve persons were kiLed, and many others much injured. For some days previous to the explosion the mill had not been running, the works being stopped to put down a new engine, and this was finished on Friday last, and in the evening it commenced working. the work being resumed on Saturday and on Monday. It was stopped in the ordiiary way at dinner-hour on the last day, and should have again been put In motion at 6 o'clock, bat some slight delay oceurred, and, as the machinery was not going, several of the mill hands assembled in the boiler-house, led there principally by the novelty of the circamstance, and partly to see what was the matter; and immediately afterwards the person in charge of the engine (Jesse Forth, who acted as engineman and stoker) ordered some of the bystanders to put the engine in motion, while he "fired" up. This was done, but the fly wheel had only made two or three revolutions when the boiler exploded and laid the place in ruins. Corpses were scattered here and there-some on the premises of Messrs. Mitchell and Dewhurst, some in the goit, or artificial dam, adjoin. ing, and others buried beneath the rubbish, or lying side by side with those who had escaped death, but who were only less helpless than their more unfortunate companions. Assistance having been procured, attention was first paid to the living, and as early as possible the following were removed to the infirmary :-Mary Ann Garlick, Elizabeth Hampshire (both sinceo dead), Eliza Umpleby, Hannah Sutcliffe (not expected to recover), and Joseph Butler, while others were aided in going to their own homes. The bodies of a mechanic named Joseph Lumb, vwbo had been assisting in putting down the engine, together with those of two women, were found on the premises of Messrs. MitcheU and Dewhirst, and two were taken out of the goit, three others being found among the ruins; but for a long time only one or two of the bodies could be identified, they being so disfigured. After eight bodies had been recovered, It transpired that the engineman and a girl named Emma Cliffe were still missing. Workmen were therefore set to remove the rubbish, and the bodies were found yesterday morning near to the boiler. The following is the list of killed:-Ellen Lord, 16, and Hannah Lord, 18, lirkheaton; Sarah Ann Stott, Gardenhouse, Lockwood. Mary Fletcher, 18, Aspley; Lavinla Crowther, 16, Castfegate; Joseph Lunb, mechanic (married); Jesse Forth, engineman; Emma Cliffe, 13, Castlegatel; Hannah tmpleby, 16, Almondbury; Hannah Mosley, 16, Almondbury* Mhary Ann Garlick, 19, Castlegate; Elizabeth Hampstire. The persons injured are,-Louisa Umpleby, 20, Kirkheaton (dangerously),; Hannah Suteliffe, Rasholiffe (dangerously); Joseph Butler, 13, Newsome (seriously); Benjarnin Shaw, mechanic (slightly); John Donaldson, stableman (slightly.) Donaldson had a very narrow escape as he was sitting in the front of the boiler at the time of the explosion, with his son Thomas Donaldson, who also escaped with slight injury. Solomon widdua warper (slightly). Benjamin Butter. worth (slightly); eury Wrlgley, book eeper (slightly) ; the overlooker of the mlll (slightly). An inquest was commenced yesterday evening at the Wharf Inn before Mr. G. Dyson, coroner, for the identification of the bodies. The coroner suggested that some engineer in whom the jury would have conndence should be anpointed to report as to the cause of the accident, and, the Jury havlng expressed their concur. rence, the inquest was adjourned till Monday next. IxPrsovzD SLATE WOREIE.-An improvement, which bids fair to supersede the dangerous system of blasting out the elate masses, has been introduced into several of the slate quarries in the Principality and hitherto the operations have been very successful .By the improved method long square sLabs a yard and a-half wide can be worked out at the rate of 21 inches per hour without the slghtest waste, thus preventing the waste of material and the accumulation of vast heaps of slate refuse. This method hma been Introduced into the Festiniog quarrles. and is sulted to every incline in the slate formation. Slabt of slate 13 feet In length and 14 inches In thickness havg been successfully procured,
HA YMA.KEr TE]ATRE. Mr. Tom Taylor's htghly succesful comedy, the Unecy0 Afatch, is now followed by a very extravagautbut very laugbable farce, entitled T&c Care of DouoiZ-. ThE monosyllable followed by a mysterious dash that termnl nates this title is the abbreviated name of onE Dowbiggin (Mr. W. Farren), who, in bis boyhood, has been the favourite pupil of Mr. Wallop (Mr. Buckstone), an estimable schoolmaster. Wadlop ha reason to believe that the wife of his old favourite is carrying on an intrigue during the absence of her husband thait may prove fatal to bis domestic peace. Resolving umdes these circumstnces, to "take care of Dowb," Walop hastens to that gentlemau's oountryhouse, and involves him. self in the most extraordinary scrapes to frustrte the inten. tions of the supposed Lothario. Now he nearly breeaW hi neck by riding an unrulY horse, with an interceytedletttr la his pocket; now he takes a scarecrow suspended on a tree for the profligate in ambush, and, firing a gun with the ebnpi1 Intention of frightening the delinquent, is led to beliete ve ita unexpected fall that he has oommitted a murder. E better half, M Wallop (Mrs Edward Fitzwlliamn), who misunderstanding the cause of his flight from home, ha3 travelled in search of hitm, adds to his complicatlon;, whUe at the same time she becomes the object of some rather obtrusive attentions on the part of the very " Dowb" whose house Wallop is toiling to protect. Not one of the many incidents of which the farce is composed is dwelt upon for two successive minutes but the fun is mainly occasioned by the rapidity with which Mr. Buckstone is whirled from one disaster to another, displaying some new form of grotesque humour at each variation of his misery. Those who seek for a leading idea will be grievously disappointed but there is atill a public that can laugh at the. practical jokes and audacious improbabrities of the old school of farce, and this public wi roar at the misfortunes incurred by Mr. Wallop i "taking care of Dowb."
OLYMPIC THEATRE. The retuifn of Mr. F. Robson to this theatre has been speedily followed by a faroe In which he plays the principal character, and which is called What SW th4W zay at Brompton t This title Indicates the motive that haa promptedMz. Todd (Mr. Robson) and his wife (MiLs Wynd. ham) to prepare for an Italian tour in ieu, of the customary qourney to Gravesend or MArgate, the public on ot ?Brompton being to the happy pair as fr~ as the words of "Arm Grundy' asne Ashfield. The fumes of a strongly opiated cigar, and the unpleasant anec. dotes respecting Italy narted by an unpleasant uncle, rejoicing in the name of Croker, become so blended in the rnind of Todd that, fal1ing asleep while looking over hbi papers, he has a dream that occupies the geater prt of the pitcce. His apartment is converted It an Xtalian domicile, kept by a bandit captain, of who6e niwee he becomes enamoured, believing that Mrs. Todd has been drowned off Genoa. The Captain compels him to marry the niece, though his wife reappears in time enoughl to warn him against the crime of bigamuy; and a brigand of inferior rank, previously in love with the bride, threate=n to do some dreadful deed on the nptial. day of his rival. The threat is ful.llced by setting the house on fire, and thli catastrophe awAkens the sleeper from his dream, bringing back the audience to the snug apartmient at Brompton. We believe this piece is original, but the leading notloz is extremely similar to that of Ar. Planch&s - omasna Idea-itself an adaptation fromn the French. The comical terror of Mr. Robson as Todd, and his abortive efforts to conceal it; the bluffness of Mr. Addison as the brigan4 chief;* the grim feroCity of MEr. 1. Coopersa the leMei bandt; nd he levr mae-up o Mr 0.Cooke as thej rok old uncle, rendemr thelitttle eG-manations of fancy amusing enough, the general effect being much heightened by the appropriate and pinturesque character of the costu^mes.
ST. JTAMES'S THEATRE. Last night was produced for the first time in this country the opera of It Birraio di Preston ("The Brewer of Preston"), with the music of Signor Luigi RiccL The ad. ventures of Daniel Robertson, the brewer in question, have been made tolerably familiar in Cisalpine regions throngh the late Adolphe Adam's Brass8cur de Preston, one of the most genial works of that lively French composer. It Is therefore unnecessaryto recount them in etenso. Suflice it, in consequence of anextraordinary resemblance between himself and his brother-a lieutenant of George IL, in active service against the Pretender-Daniiel gets into a variety of false positions, from which he is onlv extricated in the end by the conventional ingenuity of the librettist. On. tbe eve of his marriage with a certain Eiss Eff, hearing thatthe Lieutenant has trifled vith the affections of a Lady, and deserted both his mistress and his regiment, Daniel repairs to the camp, and is at once mistaken for his brother. In the hope of saving him he encourages the delusion, and not only obtains a pardon, but, as a mark of restored confidence, is assigned the post of honour in an attack about to take place against the troops of the Pretender. Daniel, who acquits himself honourably of this perilous mission,-oving rather to the nungovernable impetuosity of his horse, which carries him wherever the danger is greatest, than to his own martial ardour-finds himself immediately after involved in an affair of hononr with Sir Oliver Jenkins, brother of the lady whom the Lieutenant has betrayed. Meanwhile the intrigue becomes further embroiled by the presence of MissEffy and of Anna, the abandoned fair one-both of whom regard the unhappy Daniel as their property, and perplex him accordingly. The opportune arrival of the Lieutenant, however, who, instead of a deserter, has been a prisoner and effected his escape, sets matters right - the brewer eagerly resigns his milivary distinctions, and returns to Preston to celebrate his nuptials. What was said of the music of Crispino and the Fairy may serve just as well for that of the Brecer of Preston. The same liveliness, the same triviality of form, and the same invariable wantof originality are noticeable. In Crispino, however, there is more of the comic element than in. its companion, which can boast of no such salient point as tho trio for the male voices belonging to the third act of the former. The music of I Birraio is not dull, far from it; but there is no single scene-no single piece, indeed-that stands out from the rest, and since the prevalent style is commonplace, the want of contrast and variety is the more strongly felt. The part of Daniel was sustained by Signor Raffaeli, another "buffo" with no pretensions to be "funny'although (in contradistinction to the gentleman from Xaple4, of whom it has twice been our duty to make a similar complaint) he possesses a remarkably good voice, and is by no means devoid of talent as a singer. A scintillationof humour in acomfc characterhardly everabsentfromthe stageduring the progress of three acts would, nevertheless, have been acceptable. hIademoiseUe Dottini, who impersonated Miss Effy, is, both as a vocalist aud as a singer, infinitely more French than Italian. She has all the French mannerisms, the French method of producing the voice, and that peculiar quality of tone which in the majority of French artists Is anything rather than agreeable. On the other hand, Mademoiselle Dottini displayed a certain vocal facility and a warmth of expression where the music allowed any exhibition of feeling that entitled her to consideration, and more than once obtained her the unanimous approval of the house. The other lady, Mademoiselle Tamburini, who played Anna, has fewer claims as a einger, but is more natural as an actrees. Signor Colombo, the barytone, who made a favourable impression as the hero of Columclla, in a great measure confirmedit in the character of Toby, the sergeant; and even a very severe cold-on account of which the audience were requested to be indulgent towards Signor Giorgetti-could not entirely conceal the very pleasing quahtyof that gentleman's voice, which, in the present eartthoftenotrs, should be turned to good purpose. Signor CasteUli had not the same opportunity for distinguishing himself as in ColunWla and Cri,pino, wbere his ,enuine comic powers were tested; but whatever he had to do was done so well that be gave no reason for any modification of the unqualified praise bestowed upon his performance in those operas. The opera was well received from first to last, though, as we have hinted, there was no special display in any part of it calculated to raise the audience to enthusiam
REPRErSEm-TATIO-N OF PAUSLE5Y.-It Was generally understood that Mr. C. Ewing, of Strathleven, who con. tested this burgh on the last occasion, and who was only defeated by the late Mr. Hastie by a smaU number of votes,would have been now brought forward. His friends are very anxious that he should offer himself; but it is believed that in the present state of mercantile matters in Glasgow, In which Mr. Ewing, as a maerchant, is deeply engaged, he does not see his way to afford tho time for a canvass, and possibly a contest, and has therefore as yet declined. MIr. Lanont Younger, of Knockdon, issued his address about a week ago, offering himself on very Liberal principles. He has no connexion with Paisley, and nothing is known of him bat that he is the son of a wealthy Highland proprietor. Any chance he might have had of being returned is much damaged by the fact which has been made public that in the days of the late panic he went to one of the Glasgow banks and demanded 5,OOO. in gold for his check, thus lending himself to the sinly alarm which produced so much mischief. On Saturday, however, a candidate presented himself whho is much more likely to be succssfur. This was the Hon. F. Leveson Gower, brother to Lord GranviUe, who repre. sented Stoke-upon-Trent In the last Parliament. The hon. gentleman in his address says:-" I have been led to hope that my uniform support of Liberal principles in the lasl Parhament, and my close connexion with the commercia interests of the country, may give me some claim to yoar suffrages at the approaching election. Personally unknown to you, I am desirous to aunounre briefly the political opinions which have hitherto guided my public conducrt andaon which I rely to obtain for me the honour of becoming your representatIve. I have advocated, and shia continue to advocate, an extension of the suffrage, and the protection of the voters by the use of the baUot. & remova of the existing Inequalities in our representative system will be necessary to make the reforms complete. I supPorted and hore again to support with my vote, the Lord-Advo, cate's illrespeatng national education. On this and on aU occasions I have acted in concert with the friends of re. ligions liberty. I shall strenuously promote any reform in the administration of public affairs which shall secutre efficiency andeconomy,andmake merit the test of fitnessforpublicoffioe The recent crisis in the commercial world will force upont Parliament a ful and searching investigation into our mone. taty system. Believin the rinciplesof Scotch bankin to be intrinsically sound, Ishan nevertheless give to this m, portant subject my most asxious consideration. The restoration of supremacy In India, with a vlev to the better government and civiliztion of the large population which Providence has committed to our charge, seems tome a great ChristiAn duty. Any measures to secure these objeots shall recelve my most earnest attention." The hon. gentleman is to address the electors this (iMonday) evening. The constituency is known to be a very troublesome one. Though the late Mr. Hastle was an, advanced Liberal," and though he subeidised the unem. played working classes in perlods of depression to the extent of many thousand pounds during the time he repreeente the burgh, yet he wras not considered lberal enough and good enough by a large body of the electors, and only res talned hissa on the two last occaslons after sovere lt'
