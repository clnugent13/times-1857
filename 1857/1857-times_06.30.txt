TUE INDIAN MUTINIBS. We have been favoured with the following acomunt of the Meersut and Delhi insurrection, by the Rev. T. 0. Smyth, M.A., Chaplain of Meerut:- " On the 9th of May 85 troopers of the 3d Light Cavalry, who had refuzed to fire with the cartridges supplied to thom (the same which they had used for many months), wore brought up at a parade of the Meerut troops to receivo the rentence of a general court-martinL which had finished Its proceedings the previous day, and whose sentence bad been confirmed by Major-General W. EL Hewitt, commanding tho division, in accordance with the speoial powers wldch had been given him by the Commander-inChief Chains were riveted on the mutineers in the presence of the troops, and they were sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years. All remained quiet tiU the evening of Sanday, the 10th of May, when I wae driving down to church as usual (distant aboat a mile from my house), for the 7 p.m. service, and met on my way two of Her Majestye 60th Rifles covered with blood and supported by their comrades. On reaching the church I found buggies and carriages driving away in geat confusion, and a body of people running to me and pointing to acolumn of fire and smoke in the direction of the city. Frequent shots were then heard, and the distant cries of a large mob. My colleague, the Rev. Mr. Rotton, and his wife, came up at the moment; but, finding that the peoplehad al gonebaok, weabandoned of course the thought of commencing divine service, and I drove home, about half. past 7 or a quarter to 8, in the direction of the Rifle and artillery lines, avoiding the most public places of resort. I may mention that a guacd of some eight or ten Sepoys at the artillery dep6t, or School of Instruction (three of whom were kiled shortly afterwards in resisting an officer, who came with his party to take their post), saluted mo in passing. I reached my house (which I share with Mr. and Ms Bicknela, of the Horse Artllery), in perfect safety, but found from thom that the Sepoy guard at the Brigadier's (olose at hand) had, shortly before, fired a shot, which passed between them while they were standing at the gate of thoir compound. We went together, just after my return, into the western verandah, and heard a shot in the adjoining road, foUowed by a cry and the galloping oil 6f a horse with a buggy. This proved to have been the murder of Mr. Phillips (veterinary surgeon of the 3d Light Cavalry), who was shot and mutilated by five troopers; Dr. Christie (the surgeon of the same regiment), who accompanied him in the buggy, having been sadly disfigured and injured at the same time. He is stll living and doing well. By this time the English troops (consisting of Her Majesty's 6th Dragoon Guards, a troop and a battery of Bengal Artilery, with the 1st Battalion of Her Majesty's 60th Royal Rifles), had reached the Native Infantry lines, into which they fired with grape and musketry. The inhabitants of the Suddur Bazaar and city committed atrocities far greater than those of the Sepoys, a8 in the ease of Captain M'Donald's wife, whom they pursued some distance and frightfuUy mutilated (though her children were happily aU saved by the ayabs), and of Mrs. Chambers, wife of the Adjutant of the 11th Native Infantry, who wa mardered in her garden during Mr. Chambers' absence on duty, her clothes having been set on fire before she was shot, and cut to pieces, About 10 o'clock a bungalow, immediately opposite our house, was set on fire by five troopers of the 3d Light Cavalry, and an attempt (though happily unsuccessful) was made to fire the Brigadier's house. After 11 strong pickets and patrols of the English cavalry, artiUery, and infantry were posted on the road near our house, but the firing of houses, &c., continued till close upon daybreak, principally caused by the neighbouring villagers, after the guarding of the lines. The loss of property, and alas! of life, has been very dreadful. The part of Meerut in which the insurrection principally raged is a miserable wilderness of rained houses, and some of the residents (as was the case -with Mr. and Mrs. Greathed, the Commissioner of the Division) escaped miraculonsly from the hands of their pursuers, by hiding themselves in the gardens and outhouses of their burning bungalows, and in some cases by disguising themselves as native servants. Before the European troops arziyed on Sunday night at the scene of action the foRovring were barbarously cut to pieces :-Mr. V. Tregear, inspector of schools; Captain M'Donald, of the 20th Native Infantry, and Ma. M'Donald; Captain Taylor, Mr. Pattle, Mr. Henderson, aU of the same corps; Colonel Finnis, commanding the 11th Native Infantry; Mrs. Chambers, whose murderer was caught on the 15th, tried at once, and hanged on a tree without further delay, his body afterwards being burnt to ashes. In the 3d Light Cavalry the following were killed:-Mr. PhiUips, veterinary surgeon; Mr. and Mrs. Dawson; Mr. Mae Nab, lately joined, and a little girl of the riding master's, Mr. Langdale ; together with several soldiers of the artillery and 60th Rifles, and women and children of the military =d general residents in the station. Among'other instances of frightful butchery was that of Sergeant Law, his wife, and six children, who were living beyond the precincts of cantonments. The state in which the father and three of he infants were found defies description. Happily the mother and three other children,though grievously mangled, crawled about midnight to the Artillery Hospital, and it is hoped will recover. Mr. Rotton and I have buried 31 of the murdered, but there are others whose bodies have not us yet been brought in. The 3d Light Cavalry (with the exception of some 70 or 80 troopers) and the 20th Native Infantry went off to Delhi during Sunday night. The 11th Native Infantry, who not only refrained from murdering their officers and burning houses, but protected the ladies and children of the oorps, remained in the neighbourhood; 120 of these have returned, and it is thought that many more of them wiU do so, a proolamation of pardon, under the circumstances, having been sent to them. On Monday night many people (including a large number of women and children) slept in the Artilery School of Instruction, a walled enclosure, weU guarded. On Tuesday I returned vith my friends to our house, but while we were at dinner I received the news that aU the Delhi troops had mutinied and joined the insurgents. We were consequently ordered, with the ladies and children, back into the depOt, and the troops were at ouce placed under arms and posted with cannon, so as to command the European lines of the station, the rest being abandoned. The night passed away with no disturbance, except constant shots between the pickets and rioters, the latter consisting of villagers and residents in the city and bazaars. On Tuesday evening Captain De Teissier, of the Artillery, and Captain Wallace, of the 74th Native Infantry, with their respective families, Major Abbott, Captain Hankey, Mr. Elton, &c., with some ladies, women, and several children, came in from Delhi with fearful accounts of the revolt in that city and massacre of the English. The Rev. Mr. Jennings, Chaplain of Delhi, and his grown up daughter (an amiable and much respected young lady) were murdered in the palace, where they were living with Captain Donglas (also t1ll116d), Commandaut of the Guards. The Delhi Bank was 'Plundered and burnt (as were all cantonments) together with the premises of the Delhi GaceUe, the Treasury sacked, and the church burnt. But a very few, I fear, have escaped by the Kurnaul road and in this direction, although it is ramoured that several carriages were seen proceeding' to Kurnaul. The troops in Delhi were Captain De Teissier's I.ght Field Battery of Native ArtiUery, with the 74th, 54th, and 38th Regiments Native Infantry-the two latter of which attacked and muxrdered their own officers as weU as those of the 74th. " On the 15th of May 600 of the Sappers and Miners, officered by commissioned and non-commissioned Europeans, arrived at Meerut from their atacion, Roorkee, and the Commander-in-Chief is shortly expected to move from Umballah towards Knrnaul with three European regiments from the hills and 3,000 troops furnished by the Jain and Putteealah Rejabs. The Sirmore battalion is hourly expected in Meerat from Deyrah. The rebels are still at the Palace of Delhi, and have failed, it is said, in inducing the neighbouring rajahs to join them. They are reported to be fighting among thomselves ; and. the city, I suppose, is in a geate of anarchy. Numbers have lost aU that they possessed except the clothes on their backs; araong the rest the Rev. Alfred and Mrs. Medland, of the Church Missionary Society. That gentleman was performing divine service in the Mission church at the time of the mutiny, and escaped to the E iropean lines. The rioters broke into his house in the city, searched every nook and corner for him, and burnt down the pretnises. None of us, I believe, are destitute of profound and heartfelt thankfulness to Almighty God for our great deliverance. Oar hearts, however, are bleeding for the loss (under circumstances of frightful and unparalleled atrocity) of so many of our dear and unfortunate countrymen. The soldiers especially are burning to inflictsunmary punishment on these brutal murderers of unarmed men, defenceless women, and innoceDt children. Martial law has been proolaimed in the district by the Major-Gene- ra. The mutiny commenced with the rescue of the 85 prisoners by their comrades. The gaol was burnt, and 1,400 other eonvictaliberated. The fettered mutineers proceeded to the compound of Captain Galloway, of the 3d LightCavalry, and compeUed his blacksmith to remove their chains. The Delhi magazine was defended for some time by certain Europeans, but at 3 p.m. on the 12th inst., when the insurgents had succeeded in effecting an entrance, the place was blown up with a terrific explosion by Lieutenant G. D. Willoughby, Commissaryof Ordnance, destroying, it is thought, some 1,000 of the rebels. That gallant officer escaped for the time to the main guard. His fate at present remains uncertain, though but little hope is entertained of his safety. Not a single European or native Christian is left alive in Dclhi or the nilighbourhood. The o iexs and overseers of the Haupper stud, with their wives and families, escamped on the evening of the 13th inst., and reached Meerut the following morning without molestation. Their names are as follow :-Ca;tain and Mrs. D'Oyly and Captain and Ms. Parrott, with their respective families, Mr. R. B. Parry, Veterinary Surgeon; Mr. R. W. Macauley, Assistant Surgeon, with all the European resia dents and their families; Lieutenant J. J. Eakford, of the 6th Native Infantry, holding an Engineer appointment at Meerut, defended his treasury against the mob for a considerabletime, his wifeand familyhidingin the garden. The house at last was set on fire, and Mr. Eckford severely wounded on the left temple. He remained insensible for a considerable time (after destroying several of his assailants), while the premises were in flames, but miraculously escaped, after some hours, with his wife, child, and sister-in-law. He is now out of danger on account of his wound. The native servants throughout the station, with scarcely an exception, have behaved admirably." ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. " SATURDAY, MAY 16. "Six companies of the Sappers and Miners, arrived yesterday, have suddenly murdered their commanding officer, Major Fraser, by shooting him in the back, and have made at once for the open country, pursued by a troop of Horse Artillery and several of the 6th Dragoon Guards. Fifty or sixty of the mutineers have been shot on the plain, and the rest have probably escaped to Delhi. Two companies, dis. armed, remain in Meerut, and are perfectly quiet." " SUDAY, MAY 17. "Iast night all was quiet in the neighbourhood." " MONDAY, MAY 18. "This morning brought us the happy news in a letter from Kurnaul that many more had escaped from Delhi to that station and IUmballah than bad at firstbeen anticipated. Matters remain in statu quo as regards the insurgents. The King of Delhi is said to have raised the green standard of Islamism, and faction is reported to be rife among the rebels. More fugitives from Delhi are expected shortly." "IJST OF KULED AT MIEERUT ON SUNDAY EVENING, MAY 10.

(From the Te4graph and Courier Extra.) BOMBAY, MAY 28. When we stated that apprehensions were entertained for the safety of Calcutta, our intelligence was, as usual, con. tradicted by a local journal of limited resources. We said nothing at the time, knowing that a few days would set the matter at rest. That Calcutta was menaced cannot be denied; at the very time we wrote sentries were being placed over the European officers' quarters, and the Fort itself had been placed in something like a state of siege. It was while all this was going on, and of -which we were per. fectly cogpizant, having been assured of the fact from a source which could not be doubted, that the intelligence we published was arrogantly and emphatically contradicted. The state of Calcutta on the 19th of May is thus described by the Phanix of that date:- " We mentioned in yesterday's paper that European sentries had, the night before, been mounted on the quarters of each officerin Fort Wiliam. The precaution was not taken before it was required. There are at present six companies of the 25th Regiment of Native Infantry and a wing of the 47th Madras Native Infantry on the esplanade between Coolie Bazaar and the Fort. None of those troops have ammunition, but on Sunday night the men of the 25th entered into communication with the Guards from the Barrackpore regiments on duty at the Fort, and composed, we believe, of detachments from the 2d Guards and 70th Native Infantry. The Guards in the Fort have each ten rounds of ammunition. The men of the 25th asked them for five rounds of this, stating their readiness, if they got it, to storm the Fort during the night time. They were reused, and their treasonous overtures almost immediately made known to the town major by those it was attempted to seduce. Immediately afterwards the bugles sounded, and the Fort was placed in something like a state of siege. The drawbridges were all drawn up, the ladders withdrawn from the ditches, additional guards placed upon the Arsenal, Euro. pean sentries placed upon all points of the ramparts with loaded muslkets, and armed patrols kept moving through the fortressduring the night. All,however,passed off withoutany attemptonthe part of the baffled Sepoysoutside. An exprss appears to have been sent off to Dumdum, for the wing and head.quarters of Her Majesty's 53d,' hitherto stationed at. Dumdum, moved into Fort William yesterday.morning; the entire of Her Majesty's 53d, with the women and children of the regiment, are therefore now in Fort William. " Yesterday evening, and we believe al through the day, sentries with loaded arms were again posted on the ramparts of the Fort. All danger is, we believe, now over, as we have heard that the 25th were disarmed yesterday evening. " about 7 p.m. yesterday evening a strong detachment of 90 bayonets, from Her Majesty's 63d, each man with 10 rounds of ammunition, left Fort William for Allipore." From a postscript of the Phewix we take the following items of news:- " A detachment of the 84th (Queen's) is immediately to be despatched to Benares. " Government have despatched letters to Lord Elgin and General Ashburnham with the object of obtaining the aid of the troops destined for China. The letters have been forwarded to Ceylon with the view of meeting them there. Sir Henry Ward has also been requested to send as many European troops from Ceylon as he can spare. The 35th (Queen's) from Burmah and the 1st Fusileers from Madras are expected to arrive here speedily. " The raising of a Calcutta Militia is much talked of among merchants and other influential Europeans here. A patriotic movement is also on foot among the Masonic fraternity." Disturbances are said to have recommeneed at Barrack. pore. The proclamation of martial law in Calcutta, the formation of a militia corps, and the arming of the European crews belonging to the ships in the river, have been recommended in Caleatta. The Sergeant-Major of the Golundanze at Dumdum is said to have been murdered in his bungalow. " Yesterday," says the Plenix, " more revolvers, firearms, and ammunition were eold in Calcutta than ever was the case sinde the days of Job Charnock. There was a regular rush to the establishment of Messrs. Abmuty and Co., so much so ' that purchasers were unable to get in on account of the throng. An extensive sale of revolvers of all sizes took place, as well as of other descriptions of weapons, offensive and defensive. The principal purchasers; we understand, were residents of lowrah, who in self-defence against the possible attacks by Sepoys had hastened to arm themselves." The following is from the Central Star of the 20th instant:- A1 A report has reached us, but for the truth of which we cannot vouch, that a disturbance has taken place at Fyza. bad, and that two companies of Her Majesty's 32d Regi. ment have been ordered off to quell it. We can scarcely believe that the Chief Commissioner, at the present time, would allow one European soldier to quit Lucknow; but, as the report has not been contradicted, we give It publicity. We also hear that the King's brother and uncle have been arrested on the charge of tampering with the native troops in cantonments; of this we believe there is little doubt. The telegraph wire between this and Cawapore is also said to have been cut, and all communication interrupted. One fact we may as well mention, that for two days past all telegraphic messages sent from Lucknow undergo official scratiny, and that General Wheeler receives all messages at Cawnpore prior to their despatch or delivery. Of this we have proof. " Just as we were going to press we received a letter announcing the pleasing inteligence of the safety of Mr. Beresford, manager of the Delhi Bank. We have not ha e"d how, when, or where he made his escape, but we are ured that he is still in the land of the living, safe and sound. Mr. Bereaford having escaped from the slaughter at Dlelhi, it is probable that the bank ledgers have been saved from destruction; the cash in the bank's coffers is, doubtless, gone, but even this will be trflSing compared to the destruction of the bank's records. We yet hope to hoar that others also have escaped the hands of the rathleas murderers. " A Persian paper, duly signed and sealed, was found in the city on Monday. calling up;on the 'faithful' to rise en nassc and slaughter the Feringhi Caf&es I" Bom6ay Times-office, May 27, 2 p.m. We hasten to place before our subscribers the following important intelligence from the Plnjab, rid Scinde, and from the North-West:- An express from Ferozepore has been received stating that the 57th Native Infantry and the 45th Nativo Infantry mutinied. The 10th Cavalry stood by the Europeans, and the two native regiments were broken and dispersed, aznd the 57th were coming in and delivering up their arms,Scindian Extra, May 20. By private letters from Labore we learn that the whole of the native troops in that province are in an undisguised state of mutiny. On hearing of this outbreak the authorities Immediately called in a council of all the European inhabitants to decide upon what course to adopt in this emergency, The whole of the ladies have been ordered into the fort at Eawul Pindee; meanwhile Har Majesty's 81st Regiment proceeded to the lines of tho mutineers, and promptly, thus happily depriving at least some portion of them of the means of doing harm. The greatest consternation prevails in Lahore. It is sad that the disaffection has spread al over Delhi, Umballa, Meerut, Ferozepore, and other places and several Europeans and natives have been brutally murdered. The hospital lately occupied by the 72d Native Infantry in Agra was burnt down about midnight on Wednesday, the 20th-Aid The transactionof business in our import-market has been very limited. Our money-market has, contrary to expectation, become very much tighter, and the banks have in consequence raised their rates of interest 3 per cent, ll round. Freights are dull and have declined. (From the Bombay Tiaes of May 25.) The folowing extracts are from the Afofussilile, containing important news from Meerut, Deli, &c. The following is from Meerut:- " MERUT, May 17.-Since Tuesday night we have been in the laboratory, without once having gone beyond its wall. We are in a smal house at one end of the place, which consists of one large room and verandah rooms all round, and in this miserable shed, for we can scarcely call It anything else, there are no less than 41 souls, viz. :-Billings, 10; Beans, 4; Shuldams, 4; Moore, 13; MitcheDll, 3; Trotters, 3; Mr. Pocock, his mother, sister, and little nephow, besides having in our verandah room the post. office, and arranging at present a smaU room adjoining to the post-office as the telegraph office. "A number of people have escaped from Delhi and found theit way to this station. Major and Mrs. De Tessier, Mr. and Ms. Ray, Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, and Mr. and M3rs Healy are among those whose names I have heard, but there are several others too. " The Sappers and Miners, 800 strong, arrived from Roor. kee yesterday morning, and after having killed their com. manding offlicer, Captain Fraser, last evening, 400 of them made off for Roorkee; 50 were shot in the attack which of course followed the murder of Captain Fraser, and the rest were made prisoners, and out, of these prisoners 59 more were killed last night, at about 1 o'clock, for trying to escape. " On Taesday, while I was writing to you, we heard that Sirdhana had been devastated. We made sure all the children in the convent had been murdered. We remained in this fearful suspense till Wednesday evening, when we got a short note, saying they were uninjured, though in imminent peril, being besieged by the vilagers. We have since learnt that our dear sisters, B-, Miss B-, and another poor girl, the daughter of a sergeant in the Dragoon Guards, are all safe and welL The poor nune and children from Sirdhana have also been rescued without any one having been injured. " A butcher of the Sudder Bazaar was hung the other dav, it having been proved that he was the murderer of poor Mms. 'Donald; six others have been caught, and murders provedagainst them also, but they have not received their deserts yet." Another letter, of the same date, says:- " There is dreadful work going on yet. The Sappers and Miners that were sent for from Roorkee have rebelled. Yesterday, all of a sudden, they commenced fighting among themselves, and then they shot their commanding officer through the head; after this they, or rather a part of them, left for Roorkee. When the officers heard of the affair they took a party of the Rifles, 6th Dragoons, and Artillery after them. They overtook them on the saundhiUs and killed about 80 or 90. Major Waterfield sent an express off to the residents of Roorkee to be prepared to receive them. Two hundred and fifty of the Sappers were at work at one end of the station, and when the officer commanding the station heard of the rebellion of the others he seat for them very quietly and disarmedthem, andturnedthemout of thestation Some of the 3d Cavalry have repented and given up their arms. The mUitary authoritlesappeartohaveactedunwisely in taking those men back, for five of them were sent in with a jemadar to protect some men going yesterday to repair the telegraph, and these five troopers again rebelled. " The news from Delhi is better. The villagers refused to join in destroying the Europeans. The insur=ent, are said to be sorry for what they have done, and are ready to reform. The report is not trae that the conductor at Delhi blew himself up. He allowed a large body of the rebellious soldiers to enter the magazine, and then blewit and them up. It is said that he is not killed, but only got quite blackened from the gunpowder. " We are sorry to have to mention, in addition to deaths published in our last, the names of Sir Theophilus Metcalfe and Mr. Le Bas, of the civil service. "Ten native officers and men of the 74th Native Infantry have ocme to Allygurh from Delhi, with ams in their hands; they came straight to the maglstraWs house and gave up their arms and ammunition. "The Lieutenant-Governor has allowed them to be let go, as it is only the real ringleaders and instigators of this mad rising to whom no mercy whatever can be shown. " We have reason to know that a strong force will have collected at Kurnal by Yesterday, the 18th inst., and we have every confidence that it will be more thau equal to any emergency. " Meanwhile the reports from the district are favourable, Zemindars are taking an active part in checking all attempts at plunder, and are coming forward to express their confidence in the British Govermnent. " Many native chiefs have evinced au anxious desire to be made usefalto Government, and many of the native soldiery who have been deluded into mutiny are returning to their allegiance." (From the Bengal Hurkaru, May 19.) Of the state of Delhi nothing mora is ascertained, and probably will not be until the place is retaken by the British troops. It is a significant fact that nothing has been seen of the last two numbers of the Deli Gazette that were due in Calcutta, and the fate of the conductors of that journal may be too easily imagined. It is probable, indeed, that not a single European, man, woman, or child, is alive in Delhi at the present moment, and the hope of the friends of those who were stationed there rests mainly upon the chance that the objects of their auxiety may be among the few who are known to have escaped. With regard to the massacre at Meerut the most marvelIoUs circumstance is that the European troops were not sooner brought to the rescue, since they were in strength more than adequate for the protection of the station, and might surely have been expected to prevent the greater proportion of the bloodshed. But not only were the atrocities to which we have alluded-and some of them are of a nature to which the narrators, in deference to the feelings of surviving friends, scarcely venture even to alludecommitted without check, but when the insurgents were at length put to ffight, the pursuit of them by the European troops seems to have been of a most undecided character, and abandoned for no apparent cause except that the night was dark, aad even this difficulty did not continue, for the moon rose upon the scene of desolation. It is understood that an attack will be made upon the in. surgents at Delhi as soon as the European regiments now marching upon that place shall have arrived. Of the result there cannot be the smallest doubt, and of course no quarte will be given. BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH. FROM MEERUT. Message received from Meerut, May 19.-The artillery at Delhi were absolutely forced from their guns by the 38th Native Infantry, and only joined the insurgents after many hours-most unwillingly, The 38th men shot officers, but only of other regiments. The 54th Native Infantry killed at least one of their own, The 74th Native Infantry were negatively passive. We have authority for stating that the troops now re- turning daily from the Persian Gulf have received orders not to leave their ships at Bombay and Madras but proceed on to Calcutta, where steamers and fiats will be in readiness to bring them up coumtry. A cavalry corps has also been ordered from Bombay, and ought to be in Agra in about three weeks.
THB WEST INDI-A AND PACIFWI MAIL. (BY ELtorIO AND WTWATIONAL TXLGRAH) SOUTHAMPTON, MoNDAY, L.50m.s. The Royal Mail steamship Atrato, Captain Woolley, haa arrived with the West India, Mexican, and Pacific mails, and dates from Greytown to June 4; Vera Cruz, 4; Carthagena, 10; Colon, 8; Jamaica, 11; Porto Rico, 15; Berbice, 8; Demerara, 9; Trnidad, 9; Tobago, 8; Barbadoes, 10; Grenada, 10; Antigua, 13; and St. Thomas, 16. She brings 176 passengers, and on freight specie value $916,756; jewelry value 4201.; platins, value 1,0301.; and a large cargo of cochineal, bark, alpacca wool, cigars, &c. Among the passengers are the Baron Goury de Roslan and secretary, French Eavoy to New Grenada. Yelow fever was raging at St. Thomas among the shipping, a few cases only appearing on shore. The Atrato lost by death at St. Thomas eight of her crew, and at sea four others. Among the latter were Lieutenant William Shaw, R.N., Admiralty agent, and the fourth engineer. Four hauds were left behind in hospitaL The crew numbered 133, out of whom there had been 40 cases of yellow fever, 11 proving fatal. Daring the voyage the Atrato signalled the vessels Countess of Durham, John Pink, Alice Ball, Hugh Taylor, Centaur, and Orion. By the Atrato 93 bales of alpacca wool were brought from Arica and sent by railway acrom the Isthmus of Panama, being the first consignment of wool by this route. The rains at Jamaica have brightened the prospects of a large sugar crop; the island was healthy. Markets generally dulL Rice in fair demand. Exchange on London, 90 days, j per cent. premium; 60 days, 1; 30 days, 1J,; prxvate bills at par. The vacancies in the Grenada Legislature had been filled up, and the House of Asembly convened for the 16th of June. At Trinidad, prices of breadstuffs and provisionshad notimproved, and stocks were still coieidulhe. Produce was scarce, and what remained sold freely at $6 SOc. for sugar and 35c. for molasses. - Freights not so brisk as last mail. Weather favo'arable for the planter. The crop at Barbadoes was nearly all in, and the canes have yielded well. Prices of meal, flour, and rice stiff. No transactions in produce, and the last sales of sugar were at $8J per 100lb. Molasses, 52c. per gallon. Quotations were nominal. Little to report in freights. The Upata gold diggings on the Yuruar, in the neighbourhood of Bolivar, are, it appears, in the British territory, and communications have been received by the Governor from Mr. Batheson, the British Consul at Bolivar. There are upwards of 600 people assembled there, and gold is said to be discovered in abundance at a depth of about five or six feet from the surface. The discovery of gold wll form a new era in the bistory of British Gxuiana. The Combined Court of Demerara had passed the annual tax ordinance, and concluded the business of the session. The weather had been favourable for the growing canes, which were thriving well. Business was dull, freights scarce, and tonnage low. There is nothing of interest from the Pacific. Business at Valparaiso was dull, aud, the scarcity of specie continuing to create great difficulty, the new Custom-house stores were so full that the Government had to rent private stores to receive the importe.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. TATTER5.AT,TMR Afn .- The room was well attended, but a duller Monday was never witnessed. With the exception of a few investments on Rosati for the Goodwood Stakes, and several inquiries after Arsenal for the St. Leger, business was at a standstill, and when the subscribers dispersed we were enabled to compile only the following scanty list of quotations.- CHENISyFORD HANDICAP. 3 to 1 agest Mr. Harvey's Renown (taken).

THE MEMBERS' PLATE, NEWCASTLE. When the stewards of the Newc-s.le meeting declared all bets off on the Members' Plate they exercised a power to which they were not entitled. Admiral Rous shtes in his 'reatise on the Law and Practice of Bacing that "the steward's decision is final on all points of racing, bat his authority does not extend to disputes on bets." The case of the Members' Plate was brought before the committee at Tattersall's, and inthe course of the afternoon the following notice was posted:- T The committee are of opinion that the stewards of Newcasle had no power or authority to declare the bets oft on the Members' Plate. 'xIF.Ommy. H. J. ious. G. PA,,c. "0 . GnnvmLue." The error committed by the stewards in causing the "deciding heat" to berun after thelastrace appointedforthe day was also loudly condemned, for if the start was invalid, the race should have been run as near to the proper time as possible. Of course, bets are determined by the "last heat," and as people w ho backed Logie o' Buchan and others that did not put in an apearance the second time are in doubt whether they can becalled upon to pay we subjoin e Jockey Club rule (40) which bears upon the question: - "When the riders of any horses brought out to run for any race we called upon by the pesona appotuted to start them to take their plaos for that purpose, the owner of every horse which comnes to the poeat shalt be considerod as liable to pay his whole stake, sad all bets respeoting sulch horaes shall be considered as play.or-pay beta.' EARLY BIRD.-This horse broke his leg while at exercise on Friday morning last. He was galloping at the time, and in the act of changing his legs, when he struck them with such violence as to cause the accident rnentioned. WORCESTER RACcS.-We are requested to state that the races on Thursday will not commence until half-past 2. This arrangement will enable those turfites who assist at the Chelmsford meeting to reach Worcester by the mornig express train in ample time to see the first race. CHELMSFORD RACES (Tius D!AY).

W BECK OF A STEAMER.-The steamer Namu, from Bristol for Rotterdam, went ashore on Saturday night on the eastern side of the Longships Rooks, off the coast of Cornwall. A yacht which arrived at Plymouth reports that at 4 o'clock on Sunday morning the Naas was stem on, all' sail set, and her stern under water. A steam tug was receiving the crew. Should the weather continue fine nearly allthr cargo may be saved. THE MmRDRi AT CHiNGFORD HATcH.-Yesterday Mr. C. C. Lewis, Coroner for Essex, resumed the inquiry respecting the death of Mary White, housekeeper to Mr. William Small, at whose house she was murdered on the 21st inst., while he and his wife were at church. After some evidence a knife was produced which was found in the house, and evidence was given that it belonged to a man wbo had been in the habit of coming there, but as nothing arose out of this testimony it is not necessary to mention the name of the person. The surgeon examined gave his opinion that the knife produced was not of such a deseciption as was likely to have inflicted the injury which caused death. At the suggestion of the coroner the inquiry was adjourned that there might be another post mortem examination. A reward of 100L. has been offered by Government for the apprehension of the murderer. FIRE AT THE WAR-omCE.-A fire occurred at the War-office, Pall-mall, on Sunday night, between 9 and 10 o'clock, in that portion of the building formerly the Ordnance-office. The alarm of fire was given by the resident housekeeper, who, while walking in the garden at the back of the house, perceived a light in one of the chief apartments, an unusual circumstance, considering that the officials absent themselves on the Saturday till the onday following. On proceeding to the room the housekeeper found evident signs of fire, the room beingfllled with smoke. Alarm was instantly raised, the Fire Brigade sent for, and assistance rendered. It originated in the registry-office, and it was ultimately ascertained that one of the desks containing official documents was totally consumedL How this fire was occasioned is a mystery. Yesterdy a strict investigation was instisuted by Lord Panmure, without, however, any satisfactory solution.

FRIGHTFUL ACCIDENT ON THE NORTH KENT RAILWAY. The brief announcement which we were enabled to make in our yesterday's in presdon of the dreadful- aocident that occurred on Sunday night on the North Kent Railway has been more than verified by the facts which have been sinoe aacertained. The terrifio collision which has caused so great a loss of life as that of l persons, and which has inflicted injuries more or less serious on upwards of 30 others, occurred a few minutes before 11 o'clock on Sunday night between the Blackheath andLewisham stations. The Sunday traffic on the North Kent Railway is very heavy, and for the necessary accommodation of personas returning from Gravesend, and other places of holyday resort, it is usual to ran two late trains at short intervalsat 915 p.m. and 9 30 p.m.-from Strood to London. This lino of railway is worked on Tyer's electric signal system. the simple explaaition of 'which is, that the station-master at one station must not allow a ooming train to pass before the last-departed train has been telegraphed clear of the next station. This system properly carried out would pre. vent the possibility of accident. It appears that the 9.15 train from Strood left at the time appointed for its departure, and passed through Blackheath tannel without anything having occurred to arrest its progress, but on neing the Lewisham station, which is only one mile from Blackheath, the driver found the signals against him, and pulled up the train just before coming to the platform. The signals were kept on, and the second guard was sent back with his red lamp to prevent the possibility of the expected 9.30 p.m. on train coming upon them. Several pasengers alighted, but the large majority, observing the precautions which hadbeen taken, kepttheir seats in fanciod security, until suddenly, and without more than a few seconds warning, the 9.30 p.m. train was heard.rushing to. wardsthem. Beforeany movement of the standingtraincould he effected by its own engine-driver, the coming train ran into violent collision with it. The effect was perfeckly frightfuL Th6 engine of the 9.30 p.m. train struck tke brak van of the 9.15 p.m. trainwith a force so great that it lifted the ponderous machine off the railsto a level with the body of the next carrig-an open thirdoclass, filled with passengers-along which it swept, doubling up and crushing to death almost all the unhappy occupants, and seriously injuring those who escaped with their lives. For a:fe# moments the energies of all the persons near the station were completely paralyzed by the horrors of the scene; but as soon as the dreadful character of the accident was ascertained assistance was sent for, and the best means at hand were adopted to extricate the vwounded and the dead. Mr. Eborall, the manager of the South-Eastern Railway, who resides at Lee-park, was eoon on the spot, personaUy directing the exertion% of a large number of labourers and others, who had been pressed into the service at the moment the accident occurred. The sufferings of some of the injured persons are described to have been most exoruciating, until death put an end to their pain. One man, who is stated to have been nearlr severed in twain, sustained existence three hours. The medical men for miles ronad were summoned to the spot, and they gave all the relief in their power to the cases, recommending such as it seemed best to be sent on to St. Thomas's Hospital, and doing what was needful for otheps. The following is the most recent account of the dead whose bodies have been identified, and who are now lying at the Plough Inn, Lewisham .- John Bellinger, 31, Shaftesbury-place, Aldersgate-street, carpet-bag maker. Elizabeth Bellinger, his wife. iEdith Bellinger, their daughter, aged nine months. Horatto Turner, 56, Brook-street, Lambeth, aged 18.

Thomas Franklin, 15, Great Maze-pond, son of one of the dressers at St. Thomas's HospitaL Mrs. Wilcox and her sister, both lately residing at Walworth. William Nightingale, of 7, Bream's-buildings, Chancerylane, and Thomas Dclton, of Aldenham-street, St. Pancras. The wounded, lying also at the Plough Inn, all dangerously injured, are:- Jacob Hale, of North-street, East-street, Woolwich, 3Iary Lortli, of Hart-street, Bicomabury. James Poland, of Travalo-house, Gravesend. James Akers, of 7, Francis-street, New-town, Deptford. The following were brought on te London, and are lying in St. Thomas's Hospitl- Sarah Ann Boykett, widow, of 56, Brook-street, Lnmbeth. Very much contued about the head and face. This case is considered dangerous. Dinah Webb, of 9, Peter-stzeet5 Sun-street, Bishopsgate. Fractured legs. Robert Colins, bootcloser, 36, Crown-street, Finsbury.

Mr. Nelson, the stationmaster, has Mrs. Kettle, the wife of one of the sufferers in St. Thomas's Hospital, at present in his house. -Mr. John Poland, an artificial florist, of Molut-strect WVhitechapel, and three other gentlemen-viz., Mr. Search, ffr. Hart, nd Mr. Akers-are so seriously hurt that they remain at Mr. Morries, the Plough Inn. The greater part of the passengers kiled and wounded were in the last carriage of the 9.15 p.m. train, which was an open third-class. Many persons in other carriages were much bruised and shaken, but it is believed that all the fatal and serious cases occurred in the last carriage, of which after the cMllision, merely the floor framework remained entire, Comparatively few of the carria&es were broken, and not more than three or four left the rals As soon as the dead and injured were removed from off tle ine 3Mr. Eborall, with Mr. Knight, superintendent of t *e railway, proceeded to inquire into the cause of the accid nt, and after a careful investigation, Mr. Eborall felt it his duty to give the driver of the 9.30 p.m. up train, and J;dward Wbiffen, stoker, into custody on the cbarge of having neglected their duty in driving an engine aud train of passengers past the danger signal at the Lewisham station. These men have undergone a partial examination before Mr. Traill, at the Greenwich Police-court. William Wiley, the guard of the Strood train, said,-I was guard of the 9.15 train from Strood, on the North Kent Railway, last night. The other guardin charge of the train with me was a man named Hughes. We arrived at the Blackheath station at 10.32, and stop',ed there to let out and take in passengers. The train was what is termed a " fast train, not calling at all the stations. Oar right time for arriving at Blackheath was 10,17. We remained at Blackheath station either three or four minutes, and then went on towards London. We should uot, in the Ordinary course of running, have had to stop at the Lewisham station. We pulled up at the distance signal, which showed " danger," and afterwards drew in to the station signal about200 'ardsfrom the Lewisham station, which was also at " danger.' The "danger" signal is a red light. The other signals are a green light for " caution" and a white light for " all clear." I was in the break carriage at the tail end of the train, which consisted of 14 carriages. The break van was about 90 yards inside the distant signal towards the station. I got out of my carriage and stood about 20 yards from it for about five or six uminutes, when I heardi thie Bekenham train compe in. I th7en heard the wvhistle, which I thouight the whistle of our engine, and that we were about to start. Finding it was not so, I ran towards Blackheath station, carrying smy hand lamp, which showedl 11danger."~ Iran down the lie 1.40 or 150 yards, and waved* the lamp. I k-new there was a traint coming, and that the rel light of th-e lamp could be seen from the spot wvhere I was standling.. I saw the train approaching, and still continued running towards it, waving the lam p and sounding my whistle. The night was dark-, and I could not see whether the driver noticedL me. There are two bridges cross the line between the Leawisham. and Blackheath stations. I was about 100 yards from the first bridge, but not quite halfway between the two bridges, when the train Passed me at a speed of 20 miles an hour. I then turnedabach- towards my own train, anid before I got back to the bridge I heard that a colision had taken place. ]Knowing there was another train coining up the line, I turned back again and ran to the Blackheath station, and told the station-mnaster not to let anything pass up te lne.I hd fo sinal wih m, which I used.

MEmorouux BDARD oF WoRKs.-A special meeting of the Metropolitan Boardof Works was held yesterday at Guildhall, xr. J.Thwaites in the chair. A deputation from the vestry of St. Mary's, Islington, attended to urge the Board to take further steps to procure the adoption of the Finsbury-park Bill by Parliament, notwithstanding the opposition to it. After a statement from Mr. Smith, the soncitor of the Board, in regard to what had taken place in the Iouse of Commons on the subject of the Bill, Mr. Wright moved that the Bill for the formation of Finsbury-park be proceeded with, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the proposed Government grant of 50,0001. After some discussion the motion was carried by 21 to 13. On the motion of Mr. Drew a resolu. tion was passed by a large majority, and without discussion, that the memorial of the vestry of Bermondsey, with referenoe to the formation of a park in the south-east portion of the metropolis, be referred tD a committee (to be appointeA) on PFday next, to consider and report on the bestmodeof carrying the prayer of ,the memorialists into effect. Mr. Turner moved that the prayer of the memorial from thevestryof Hampstead beaccededto,andthememoriaI praying that the Board would take measures for opposingthe passing of a BllU now pendang in Parliament for the amend. ment of the Leass andSal sof Settled Estates Act, 1856; and that the Board would also take measures at the 'earliest practicable period for the acquisition of Hampstead Heath and oertain adjoining land for the benent of the inhabitants of the metropolis, as recomnmended in a report of a committee of the board. A letter was read from Mr. W. Loader, the solcitor t; Sir T. M. Wilson, giving some explanations in regard to the Bill which stands for second reading in the House of Commons. Mr. Loader also attended the meeting, and said he was authorized to give the Board every information by Sir T. x Wilson. In addition to the statements contained it his letter, Mr. Loader told the Board that although Sir T. Wilson had every disposition to preserve Hampstead-he6th in its present sbape, hewould give no legal pledge to tlat effect. To the motion of r. Turner, Mr. Brooker moved, as an amendment, that the Bill for the formation of a park for Hampstead be postponed until the BiU for the formation of the park for Finsbury be passed and carried out. This motion was carried by a majority of U to 7.

P'ARLIAWENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, MONDAY, JUNE 29. Their lordships met at 5 o'clock. Lord COLVILLE presented petitions from the inhabitants of the boroughs of Peterafield and Saffron Walden, and the parish of Ballysadere, against the passing of any Bill that would secure the admission of Jews into Parliament. The Bishop of OXFORD presented petitions from the clergy of Maidenhead and other places against the Divorce BilL THE 3IUTINY IN INDIA. The Earl of ALBEMARLE gave notice that in consequence of the news from India he should postpone the pre. sentation of the petition from the King and Royal Family of Oude, which he had intended to present on Friday next. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-My lords, the disastrous news which has just been received from India, and which far surpasses my forebodings, serious as these fore. bodings were, induces me to put another question to the noble earl with respect to the measures which the Government may intend to take for the purpose of averting the great calamity which threatens us in India. It is now 20 days since I put to the noble earl this question-whether Instructions had been sent, or would forthwith be sent to India, directing the Government of India to make known at every station of the army in that country that the Government would for the futuire, as in the past, protect all its subjects in the undisturbed exercise of their religion. In reply to that question the noble earl intimated an opinion that the Government of India had acted judiciously in issuing no proclamation of that character. Now, I find by the news received this morning that not only the Lieutenant-Governor of Agra but the Governor in Council of India issued a proclamation in the strongest terms of the tenor I have described. Btut, my lords, upon what day was that proclamation issued ? On the 16th of DMay, when the mutiny at Meerut was known, when the occurrences and mutiny at Delhi were known, and when the proclamation of the King of Delhi was kngwn Now, the issuing of that proclamation at that moment might possibly tend to prevent the spread of the mutiny, but it could have no possible effect in preventing the outbreak. My lords, the Government had ample notice in India of the danger that was impending. As long ago as the 22d of January an incendiary fire broke out in cantonments at a short distance from Calcutta-a thing almost entirely unknown and unheard of. From that period, for more than three months, these indications of the dissatisfaotion of the troops continued to appear at all the principal stations of the army. The cause was perfectly woll known, and arose from an hpprehension on the part of the troops that their religion was to be interfered with. On the 25th of February the 19th Regiment mutinied. It was not tiU the 31st of March that this regiment was disbanded. On the 6th of March the Government sent to Rangoon for the 84th Begi. mnent, and so deluded was it as to the extent of the ill feeling and the mutinous disposition of the native army, and the effect of the disbandment of the 19th Regiment, that in a few days after that disbandment it was considered advisable and was actu. ally under discussion whether that regiment should not be sent back to Rangoon. They have now sent for three Queen's regiments to protect the capital of the country. These indications of a bad spirit among the troops ooourred at Allahabad, Agra, Meerut, UmbaUah, and all the great stations. No one can doubt that there was combination and that one general feeling animated the whole. Now, it is a matter deeply to be regretted that events, especialy in India, should so greatly depend upon the personal character of the individual. On the 3d of May Sir H. Lawrence, a distinguished and decided officer, having reason to expect that there would be an outbreak on the part of the 7th Native Oude Infantry, moved at the fall of night two native regiments, Her Majesty's 32d Regiment, and a battery of artillery upon them. He came upon them unawares, disarmed the regiment, and at once made them prisoners. Sir H. Lawrence took the initiative. But what was the case at Meertt 9 At Meerut the mutineers took the initiative. They rose at 6 p.m., and, according to the accounts we have received, it was not until nightfall that Her Majesty's Carabineers were able to move. If General Gillespie at Arcot had not moved his Dragoons to Vellore with more promptitude the mutiny at Veluore might have spread through the vrhole of the Madras territory, and produced effects as dangerous as those which have now occurred. And who was the officer in command in iMleerut? How did it happen that with a Queen's regiment of infantry, another of cavalry, and an overwhelming foreo of Horse and Foot Artillery, the mutineers yet escaped without injury to Delhi, and made a march of 30 or 40 miles? Elis name, it is said, is Hewitt. I do not find that he has at any time served with troops at alL He is an unknown man. There may be difficulties, and there no doubt are, in maklng proper appointments in the army in consequence of the system of seniority which prevails. But that system has beeD of late overruled, and the Government have now autthority to appoint the men whom they think most fitted for a particular post. They ought, I contend, to have acted upon that authority. No Government is justified in placing in a most important icommand a man of whom the troops know nothing, and with whose qualifications they them. selves are unacquainted. We see what has been the consequence of taking a contrary course. Give me now leavo to ask where was the Commander-in-Chief upon this occasion? Why was not he in the midst of his troops? He must have been aware of all the difficulties which were growing up. He must have known the dangers by which he was beset. He did know that those dangers existed, for upon the 9th of April he assembled the troops at Umballah, and addressed them in the most sensible terms, endeavouring to undeceive them and to bring about among them a right feeling. lie, however, went to the Hills, leaving the dangers to which I refer behind him in the plain. Sach is not the conduct which a man occupying the positionof Commander-in-Chief ought to have pursued. Let us for a moment look to the position in which he now stands. From aU I have learnt I beliove the measures which have been taken by the Government of India from the moment they heard o the oceupation of Delhi have been prompt and judicioas. I have no fault to find with their conduct since that period; but I do find fault with them for having been blind to that which ought to have beer obvious to all, and for having taken no precautions before this dreadful calamity took place. Well, what is the position of General Aneon? He had with him two European regiments of cavalry, two European regiments of infantry, an ample supply of artillery, two regimaents of Ghoorkas ; but I am afraidhe cannot absolutely rely upon any of the other native troops by whom he was accompanied. If with that force, however, independent of the three other native corps, General Anson were to meet the mutineers in the field, he may beat them, though they should be of double his numbers, without much difficulty. But, there are two enemies besides the mutincers with whom he will have to contend, of whom the people of this country make no account- bat which are foes infinitely more dangerous than the mutineers-I allude to the climate of India at the season at which these occurrencestook place, and to the total want of carriage. When the regiments go into the ceantonnients the carriaces are dismissed, and it would therefore be almost impossible for General Anson to move the EuropeAn troops. The only resource open to him consists in impressing the men in the hills. He may by that means bring down 3,000 or 4,000 persons to carry burdens, but to obtain the means of conveyance for the troops for a distance of 80 or 100 miles I believe he would find to be impossible. Just consider for a moment what is the nature of the season. It is the most severe of the whole year. It is just the concluding period of the hot weather, during which hot winds prevail. It Is a time at which no European could venture into the sun, and when no officer would think of forcing a soldier to go into the open air if he could possibly avoid doing so. The late Sir C. Napier was compelled by circumstances to go into the field at a season such as that I have described. The consequence was that 45 Europeans were struck down by the heat, Sir C. Napier being the only one of them who survived. Such is the danger with which we have to contend. But I will assunme that General Anson has been enabled to bring his troops up to Delhi. If he has done that, he ought I think by this time to be in possession of that city, and in possession of it, not owing to any vigorons attack of artillery, but by the most simple of all ineans-namely, taking possesson of the canal by which Delhi is supplied with water, and cutting off the water so as to deprive the inhabitants of all supply. Towards the conclusion of the dry season there is hut a very small quantity of water in that canal, and the people of Delhi, amnounting to the number of 60,000 or 70,000 persons, are, as a consequence, invariably reduced to great difficulties, aend are cempeelled to re-. sort to the J111111a to procu-r-e th'e water which they require. To obviate that inconvenience I established a large tank in front of the Palace of Delhi, containing a sufficient quantity of water to supply the inhabitants of the town tor a period of three weeks. I regret, however, to be obliged to say that the Government in India, actuated by that spirit which has characterized them since I left it-a spirit which has led them to desire to obliterate all trace of my having ever existed in that country-have allowed the tank to which I allUde to go to ruin, and I believe that fortunately at this moment it will not furnish the inhabitants with a supply of water for any time, so that if the canal were cut offas I have suggested, and their access to the Jumna prevented, they would be precluded from obtaining water altogether. That is my only hope in the present emergency. Observe what will happen. I left police battalions in India. They were formed for the purpose of enabling the Government, in case of necessity, to move aU the troops from any particular spot. Lord Hardinge was, owing to the establishmont of those police, enabled to move three battalions of infantry during the war in the PUnjab, a step which, under other circumnstances, he would not have been in a position to take. Now, General Anson las no such police battalions at his disposal. They have, I understand, been abolished, and he must leave a sufficient force at the different eantonments at Meerut and UJmlallab, or they wil be burnt down behind him. It is no easy matter to protect a line of cantonments extending over seven miles, but if that is not done the consequence, as I bave said, will be that those places wiU be burnb down and the Europeans wiU have no place to afford them shelter. That is what I apprehend, and there can 7ce no doubt that General Anson's position would then be one zof the mnot serious character. But it is not only Ineeraut and Delhi, but in the Punjab, Ferozepore, and in almost every part of Bengal that this disposition to mutiay has been evinced. I regret to say that I fear we cann-t at the present moment with any degree of Eecurity rely on the fidelty of any of the regular regiments o, the Bengal army. The irregular troops will, I trust, remain faithful, and I hope we also may depend upon the artiUery, although it is said that some have been seduced or threatened into a junction with the mutineers at Delhi. I nevertheless trust that we may rely on the fidelity of the artiUlery. I believe we may place implicit confidence in that of the Ghoorka regiments, as well as in the good faith of tho native princes whose territories approach Delhi. In fact, we possess in the neighbourhood of that city but a very small extent of territory. It chiefly belongs to the native princes. Our position, then, is sach as I have described. The Government have drawn troops to Bengal, as it seems to me, very prudently and very properly, but in doing so they have left both Madras and Bombay almost defencelesj. We know not the danger to which such a state of things may give rise. In short, my lords, we are really-and I trust Her Majesty's Ministers are alive to the full extent of the danger-we are realy in a position in which it becomes necessary for us to use every effort which this country can make to maintain-perhaps it may be to recoverthat great empire which we have acquired in the East. (Hear, hear.) Well, let me ask how do we stand ? We have at this moment upon our hands three wars in Asia. Those wars we are reduced to the necessity of prosecuting with a reduced peace establishment. We have sent to China that naval force which should, in my opinion, be left upon the shores of England, to give security to this country even under the auspices of the most profound peace. The whole of that naval force, however, has been despatched to the waters of China ; and for what ?-to carry on a contest between Sir J. Bowring and Commissioner Yeh. (Cheers.) Six battalions ot troops have been sent out there for the same purse,and I cannot help thinking that hose six tattaionswill be! found insufficient to bring u ider our control the numerous population of Canton. T.a consejuence will be that we shaU find ourselves under the necessity of sending out further reinforcements, which should have consisted, in my humble judgment, of native troo But are we, with India in danger, to fight the battle of the Government ? (Hear, hear.) Are we, my lords, determined, happen what may, ito persevere in that fatal policy which Her Majesty's Ministers have adopted? Are we to strain every nerve to enable Sir J. Bowring to seize upon the residence of Commissioner Yeh ? I hope not. I maintain that, if the war with China were as sound in principle as I believe it to be the contrary, common sense and the dictates of the simplest policy ought to have induced the Government to remain for a time on the defensive, and not at once to involve the country in two wars contrary to all the Principles by which the proceedings of a military State ought to be directed. I have spoken of three wars, my lords, but my noble friend the Secretary for Foreign Affairs wiUl probably tell me that we have brought one of them to a close. He wiU say that the war with Persia has been concluded. The noble earl, itis true, has brought about a treaty with that country. He has not as yet got a peace. (Hear, hear.) The treaty is one which I cannot help regarding as unsatisfactory. NTo, my lords, I cannot deem it satisfactory that we should have entered into such terms with the King of Persia as that treaty contains after tho insults which he heaped upon the British Minister. (Hear, hear.) We have, however, entered into that treaty, but even under better auspices than the present we should experience great difficulty in carrying it into execution. Persia may withdraw her troops from Ierat, but that will be of little avail unless somae other Government be established there. If Persia will not yield it up upon those terms the evident objects of the treaty will be almost entirely defeated. The noble earl must be aware that the British force now remaining in Persia is totally unable to hold Bushire and Mohammerah if there should be the slightest chance of any attempt at oppositon on the part of Persia, and can any one who is acquainted with the national character of native States for a moment doubt that this great calamity in India may have a very material influence in changing the policy of the Court Of Persia? (Loud cries of "Hear, hear.") our position in India at the present moment is that of being compelled, not only by a sense of intererst, hut by our scense of honour as a nation as well as of individuals, to protect our empire in that country. It is as much the duty of the Government to protect our empire in India as it vwould be to protect the county of Kent, if attacked; and I trust that there wil never exist in this country a feeling that, under any possible circumstances, that noble empire shal be abandoned. We must therefore send to India a sufficiency of force, but while doing so we must consider in what position we leave ourselves. I fear that, under present circumstances, the noble earl the Secretary for Foreign Affairs would feel his hand paralyzed if any material force should be despatched to the East. How, under such circumstances, would he be able to speak with ordinary firmness or dignity; or could he avoid temporizing if he felt that England waspowerless to defend herseif in case any foreign Power should choose to take the opportunity of attacking her ? (Hear, hear.) Even before this calamity occurred I entertained a distinct opinion that by reduced establishments we were leaving this country in a state in which it ought not to be as regarded its power of defence. We have now, however a new war upon our hands, which wil require an expenditure approaching that which was necessary for the contest in the Crimes, *nd which will require, in addition to the force which it is now preposed to send to India, an additional force of at least 10 regiments of infantry, three regiments of cavalry, with theirhorse, for it will not be possible to horse them iU India, end at least six batteries of artillery, because at present in some provinces the artillery force is verv smal, and no troops can possibly move without guns. When I look to these circumstances I am brought to consider how it can be expected that any material increase can be made in the military force of this country. I would recommend Her Majesty's Government to look the danger fairly in the face-not to take any exaggerated view of the case, but at the same time not to attempt to deceive themselves, and I think that the course which they ought to adont is to place this country under arms. (EHear, hear.) While we are fighting battles of such interest in the East we must be secure at home, and I know of no mode of suddenly obtaining that security but to adopt the same means as those which were adopted during the Crimean war-namely, to embody the militia. (Hear, hear.) That ste p should be taken at the earliest period possible, as well as that of calling together the yeomanry, which has never before, since 1814, been allowed to go for a year without exercise ; and we should adopt any other measures which the Government mayconsider necessary for placing at their disposal the ,whole military force of the empire. (EIear, hear.) I have read in history that HlyderAli, the great rival of the British power in the Decean, used to say, with regard to the British power, that he was not afraid of what he did see, but of what he did not see; and it is for us now to show to the natives of India that which they have not yet seen. We must come forward with increased strength upon every point, and teach them that to contend successfully against us in the field is a thing impossible. (Hear, hear.) I wish, therefore, to ask the noble earl what are the measures which the Government intend to adopt for reinforcing the troop3 in India, and at the same time for placing us at home in security while we cope with that great empire. (Loud cheers.J Earl GRANVILLE.-The noble earl has taken a very large view of a subject which is unquestionably of great importance,-of so much importance, indeed, that I should feel myself to be almost trifling with your lordships were I on the present occasion to attempt to go sLeriL4im through aU the events which have been lately going on in Iudia. I may say, however, that with regard to the disbanding of the 34th Regiment it appears to me quite clear that a short delay was wise and judicious, when that delay gave an opportunity for commanding such a European force as maight prevent what would have been a most severe disaster. It appears also to me that on the information which we have received it may be thought that some mismanagement may have been shown at Meerut, but I am quite sure that it is wiser-I will not say for individuals of your lordships' House, but it is wiser and fairer for the Government to give no opinion whatever upon the subject untUi the whole of the facts of the case have been placed before them. (Hear, hear.) I quite agree with the praise which the noble earl has bestowed upon Sir H. Lawrence, and admit the complete saccess which attended the movements which he mado, and, without doubt, a decided aud energetic course of action may often solve a difficulty of that description. The great difficulty, however, in dealing with disaffection among the native troops is the difficulty which arises from not knowing to what extent it has reached, and where it is likely to break out; and I nmay inform your lord. ships that up to the last moment the most confident assurances as to the loyalty and good feeling of those troops was received by Her Majesty's Government from the colonels of those regiments. The noble earl has praised the steps which have been taken since the juncture arrived, but I regret that he thought it his duty to follow up that expression of praise by a statemqat which, coming from a person of his high authority, wi4, I fear, create unnecessary alarm. The forces which he mentioned as being gathered together by General Anson wil be met by the English troops coming from Meerut; they will also be met by the troops of the native princes, who have shown a most cordial and praiseworthy desire of co-operating with the British troops, and I think that this is a very important circumstance not only from the material advantage of their asaistance, but also as showing the opinion which prevails in India as to the result of such a contest. I thought also that the noble earl somewhat exaggerated the amount of discontent which exists in two of the presidencies. (Hear, hear.) Even in Bengal, where no doubt the spirit of disaffection urevails the most, some regiments have remained faithful to their colours, and have shown their loyalty by operating against their disaffected comrades. Now, with regard to the movements of General Anson, I do not like to place my opinion against that of the noble earl, but I know the opinion of Lord Canning. Lord Canning knew that the General would be at Umballa on the 18th, and at Delhi on the 26th, and he looked forward with the most confident expectation of having a force at his command sufficient to enable him to deal in a satisfactory manner with those unhappy and misguided men; and I think that your lord|ships will agree with me in thinking that the confident opinion thus expressed carries with it some consolation, andshouldteach us notto thoroughly despond with regard to the present state of affairs. The noble earl, my lords, has asked me two questions; and the first one, with regard to what reinforcements Her Majesty's Government intended to send out to India, I can answer in a few words. Before the arrival of the late news 10,000 meen, consisting of four regiments and of reinforcements for European regiments, whether belongingl to the Queen's service or the Company'i service already In India, and since the arrival of that news, after communication with the Court of Directors, four more regiments, have been placed under orders to embark. With reard to the steps which have been taken in Indi% the noble viscount the Governor-General has thought it right to take every precaution in his power, and to adopt every means to strengthen the troops available for service. The noble earl will be glad to hear that since the conclusion of the Peraian war, which, however, he cals not the coa. clusion of a war, but only a treaty, the whole of the European troops have left Bushire, and three regiments, having reached Bombay, proceeded to Calcutta, where they arrived in an incredibly short period. and from that place they can be most expeditiously moved where it may be deemed expedient. With regard to the second question, I think that the noble earl looks upon this country as being placed in a much worse position than she is. It is manifest that it would ill become me at preseat to enter into any detailed statement of the measures wbich Her Majesty's Government may think it necessary to adopt in order to strengthen the means at their disposal, but they will take all those precautions which they may think necessary. I agree with the noble earl that we should consider the subject in no spirit of exaggerated alarm, but I think that if, because we happen to be at war with a portion of the Chinese Empire, and that there is an insurrection in one Part of India, we were to take upon us to say that our alarm is such that we think it neces- toprepa this country in the same way as we should do if we were engaged in a strugglewhich might end in dire calamity and disaster we should disgrace ourselves in the eyes of the world. The noble earl has alluded to my private friendship towards Lord Canning. I wil not allude further to that subject than to say that I have this day received a private letter from Lord Canning, in which he goes over all the circamstances of the case with the care and gravity becoming the nature of the subject, and the tone of that letter is such as to give the Government the greatest confidence. Notwithstanding the difficulties he writes in very good heart, and adds-and in that I am sure the noble earl will concur-that he cannot be sufficiently grateful for having at this moment had at critical places three men so admirably fitted to deal with these circumstances as Sir H. and Sir J. Lawrence and Mr. Colvin. I do not wish to prophesy, but I trust that your lordships will at all events wait until the arrival of the next mail before you allow it to go forth to this country and to the world that we are reduced to such a state as that which tho noble earl has pictured. (Hear, hear.) Lord BROUGHAM.-In a case of this kind, considering our distance from the scene of eveats, I cannot help thinlcing that it is of great importance to ascertain what are the feelings-not merely the opinions, but the feelings of alarm founded upon these opinions-of those who are nearer the spot. My noble friend (ER-1 Granville) has already told us that the alarm, if it ever existed, has been nearly allayed at Calcutta. Will he also inform us, if he can, what are the feelings in the presidencies of Madras and Bombay I Perhaps, also, as the money-market is a tesb of alarm not altogether to be overlooked (hear, hear), he will add whether the funds either at Calcutta or Bombay have felt the effect of these events. Earl GRANVILLIE.-I am much obliged to my noble and learned friend for putting this question. While the funds in this country fell upon the receipt of this intelli. gence, Government paper at Calcutta and Bombay has re. mained at exactly the same price. The Earl of HARDWICKE said, that although the answer of the noble earl opposite was such as might be expected from the Government, it had not satisfied him as to the measures which were to be taken for giving prompt assistance to India. His noble friend had said that troops had been ordered to hold themselves in readiness for embarcation. Considering the distance of India, he was induced to ask the noble earl whether he would, on the part of the Government, uader. take to prevail upon the Emperor of the French, of whose friendship and allianco we heard so much, to allow our troops to be conveyed by the French railways to Marseilles, would order the Mediterranean fleet to meet them there and convey them to Egypt, and induce the Pasha of that country to allow them to go by the Red Sea. There were 15,000 or 20,000 men at Aldershott, and it was by the promptitude with which aid was sent to India thatthe people would judge of the vigour and capacity of the Go. vernment. He was disposed to agree with his noble friend that the war with China having been commenced must be prosecuted; but if the militia were caled out for active service it would soon form a good army for the defence cf the country, and the Governmont would have all the regular troops at its disposal for carrying on to a succesfal issue the wars in which it might be engaged. The Earl of ALBEMARLE had heard wvith great satisfaction the assurance given by the Lord President as to the excellent spirit which pervaded the armies of Madras and Bombay. That assurance coincided with everything which he had heard upon the subject. He hoped that recent events would lead to the reconsideration of the system upon which the army of Bengal was reoruited, because he believed that that system was a principal, if not the proximate cause of the disturbances. The practice in Bongal was to enlist only high caste men, such as Brahmins and Rajpoots, to the exclusion of men of aUl other classes. This had a most deleterious effect upon the army, every regiment of which became as it were a box of lucifer matches. He believed that the religion of the country and the operations of the missionaries had nothing whatever to do with the matter. To a high caste lindoo it did not matter whether a man was a Christian, a hahomedan, or a Doist, providedhe complied with certainoutward forms as to cooking, eating, and othermatters. Thu Ghoorkn and the Sikis who had remained faithful to us in this cris had no prejudires of caste, and yet they were as brave and excelent soldiers as any Brahmins or Rajpoots who ever came into the field. The noble earl was proceeding to readXan extract from a despatch of Sir Henry Russell, for the purpese of shbowing that the enlargement of our territory in India, and consequently of our native army, would be an increase not of strength. but of wealmess, when Earl GRAMNVILLE interposed. A question of great interest and importance had been asked and answered, but he hoped the noble lord wouald not take up the time of the House by deviating into matters which had no intimate connexion with that question, especially after the time for putting questions had gone by, and the other business of the eu tby delayed. (Hear, hear.) The subject then dropped. BREACH OF PRIVILEGE.-LORD PLUNrET AND THE EXAMVINBR NEWSPAPER. The Earl of DONOUGHtMORB rose to call the attention of the House to what he conceived to be a gross breach of the privileges of their lordships' House. He wished to draw their lordships' attention to anaarticle in the Examiner. newspaper of the 27th of this month, which was headed a "Libel on the Bishops," and when their lordships had heard it read they would be of opinion that a grosser libel ceould not be penned. The person against whom ib was directed was a member of their lordships' House, who, from his functions as a prelate of the church of Ireland, did not attend in his place in Parliament so frequently as they would all desire. He was a nobleman who was respected by all who knew him, of unassuming manners, of kind deportment, who must have won the re gard of every person who had the honour of his acquaint. ance. (Hear, hear.) Lord Plunket-the noble lord who was libelled in this article-was the last manto lay himself open to an attack of this kind. (Hear, hear.) He was a most unassuming man, a really hardworking bishop, beloved by his clergy and by his flock, attending diligently to the duties of his see, and taking little or no part in their lordships' House. He should be the lasb man to wish in any way to encroach on tha privileges of the press, which he conceived to be one of the most necessary guardians of our liberties, but, considering the unprovoked, unnecessary, and offenaive character of this attack, he trusted their lordships would assist him in vindicating the privileges of thoir House and in marking conduct such as this with their disapprobation. The noble lord against whom this attack was made was the son of one of the greatest men whom Irelana had ever produced. The first Lord Plinket was for years one of the most distinguished ornaments of his profession, andrultimately arrived at the head of it. and, though his son, the present lord, might not possess aU his great genius and talents, yet he had certaily inherited his kindness of heart and all those uslities which had endeared him to those with whom nae came in contact. This article drew an ironical comparison between the character of the noble lord and of his father, and proceeded to attack him most unwarrantably for a vote which he had given on the question of ministers' money lately before the House. In giving a vote against that BiU this libel alleged that he was an unworthy son of ,hi.fahAr Ti.e a no- necessar for him to a p to Ws athr. It was nOt necessary for him to attempt to justify the noble lord, but it did so happen that the first Lord Plunket hadalwaysheld and expressed in thestrongest manner the opinion that the revenues of the established church of Ireland ought not to be interfered with. The artile was as follows:- I LIBEL ON A BISHOP.-Among the proxies against the second reading of the Ministers' Money Bill, in the House of Lords, we observe the name of Lord Plunket, Bishop of Tuam. It is morally impossible that this can be true. In fact, we have no hesitation in denouncing it as a libel upon that noble lord and right rev. prelate. Lord Plunket, everybody knows, is the son of the late lord, better known to the public as Mr. Plunket, the orator, the foremost Irishman of his day, as the champion of civil and religions liberty, the Whig, tho Irish Chancellor of the Whigs, the man whom of all lis coantrymen the Whigs most delighted to honour, on whom they showered their favour and their patronage, not satisfied with advancing himself to the highest posts of the law, with the dignity of the British peerage, but lavishing places and preferments upon every member of his family with a profusion and partiality that excited the astonishment and often even the ndignation of the public. To the success of Liberal principles, to tho Liberal party, and the Governments resulting from its triumphs, the present lord is indebted for all that he possesses and enjoys; for his mitre, for his coronet, for his wealth, his rank, his luxury, for every shred of his purple and fine linen, for every glass that sparkles and every dish that steams upon hls table. ButfortheWhigs andfor Whig prncipleshewouldnever have exchangedan Utrcuracyfor a Connanght bishopric, and his hot punchfor his cool claret. Hle would never have been translated to turbot, or preferred from the mutton-chop to the haunch of venison. Thereforo we do not scruple to affirm it a moral impossibility that he could have voted, either in Person or by proxy, in the manner attributed to him. Whoever inserted his name in te minority that voted against the Government and the M inites Money Bill virtually branded him both with filli- berality and ingratitude; with degeneracy from his iUus- trious father, with forgetfulnes of the unnumbered favour3 tha hae risd hs fmil fom ovetyand obscurity to riches and conseouence. We owe it to trath and justice, we owe it espeoially to the memory of the most eminent Irishman since Mr. Grattan, to vindicate the character of his son from so cruel an aspersion." The noble earl concluded by moving that George Lapham, No. 5, Wellington-street, Strand, pubUsher of the Bxcminer newspaper, be called to the bar. Earl GRANVILLE.-I can scarcely think that my noble friend is quite in earnest in the motion which he has just made. (Hear.) I do not rise for the purpose of justifying this article nor any other article which seriously or ironically holds up any of your lordships to censure, but it appears to me that the itotion of the noble earl will involve us in pro. ceedings which may be endless, and we shall find ourselves in a permanent confaict with that very amusing publication, Punch. (Laughter.) I thiDk my noble friend might have contented himself with caUing attention to this attack which has been made on the noble lord in the very unceremonious manner, but I cannot think that he is serious in asking you to take the step of calling the publisher to the bar. (Eear, hear.) The Earl of DERBY thought that, though the noble earl might feel him.elf justified in; indulging in a tone of levity and ridicule upon this question, he might at least have taken a little more pains to assist the House in setting itself right with regard to this coarse and scandalous attack on a right rev. prelate and a peer of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Malng every aUowance for the press in regard to the power which it claimed of commenting on men and measures-of holding public men up to ridicule, and pointing out their pecnlia. rities-he must say it was agrave question when they came to deal with votes given in that House and with the motives which were supposed to actuate their lordships in giving those votes. (Hear, hear.) In the present instance the coarsest ridiculo was thrown upon a right rev. prelate because of a vote which the writer affected to beheve he had not given, and which, it was said, if he had given, would have beenaproof that he had forgotten al the obligations he owed to p3rty, and aU the good feeling and gratitude which he ought to have entertained for what that party had done for his father and for himself. (Hear.) That was the strict and literal meaning of the ridicule cast upon a right rev. prelate of the Irish church for giving his proxy against a Bil which threatened, in his opinion, to confiscate a portion of the revenues of that church, and in which he only gave expression to an opinion held by a considerable minority of their lordshipe. For so doing he was held up to ridicule as regardless of the services of his late father, and amenable to the charges of iUiberality and ingratitude. A coarser or more vulgar aud un Provoked attack he had never read. The vulgar and scandalous tone of the article, indeed, placed it below contempt, and were it not thatit imputedmotivesto aright rev. prelate and a peer In giving a vote in thatHouse, he must say he should have recommendedhis noble friend not to take the slightest notioeofit. (Hear,hear.) It imputed those motives to one of the most inoffensive peers tifat even sat in their lord. ships' House, and one who was sincerely beloved by his clergy. But, however desirable it might be to confer on the pnter of the journal the distinction of standing at their ordahips' bar, that was an honour which he did not wish seo pu p upon him; he must at the same time say, however, that the writer of the article showed that he was an utter stranger to all honourable and gentlemanly feeling, and entirely ignorant of what were the uties and responsibilities of public life. (Hear.) To say that the right rev. prelate had forgotten what his father owed to the iAberal party was a libel on the late Lord Plunket, who owed everything to his own high and dis. tinguished merit. (Hear, hear.) As regarded his services to t e ILiberal party, they were not more adequately remunerated than those services deserved at their hands. (Hear.) But because a noble lord had received favours from a party -because a noble lord had had a peerage conferred upon him-was not only he, but his sons after him, and, for anything he knew, hi descendants down to the latesb generations, bound to sacrifice conscience, make himself a perpetual slave to the Government, and vote in accordance with the successors of that party who, 30 years before, had conferred thoseohonoursandistinctions? (Hear.) And becausethe son of a father thus honoured did not choose so to vote, was he to be charged with the grossest Ingratitude, and with a disregard of all the oblige. tions he owed to party ? This, he repeated, showed an utter ignorance of what were the duties and responsibilities of public raen. ((ear, hear.) He would not ask his noble friend to press his motion for bringing the printer of the journal bo the bar, as he thought he might content himself with having given an expression to his opinion regarding his disgraceful and discreditable article, the writer of which had shown entire ignorance beth of the duties of a peer of Pariament and of the obligations of a gentleman and man of honour. (Hear, hear.) The Marquis of LANSDOWNE was understood to say that it would be absurd to call the printer of a newspaper to the bar for an article which merely ridiculed in a way not uncommon to the press the public conduct of a peer of Parhament. No doubt, it was wrong to allege motives to any peer of Parliament; but it appeared to him that the article read by the noble earl only meant to represent that the right rev. prelate was unlike his father who went before him. If their lordships were to take cognizance of every article of this kind, he was afraid they would get enough of business upon their hands. (Hear, hear.) Lord BROUGHALM concurred with his noblefriend (Lord Derby) in saying that a more harmless, inoffensive, and meritorious individual than the right rev. prelate (the Bishop of Tuam) never sat in that House, and he beheved that he was universally respected and beloved in his diocess. The libel whtch had been read spoke of what his father owed to the party of his noble friends opposite connected with the Goverment; but a more unwarrantable) statement he never happened to hear; for what the late Lord Plunket owed to that party was as nothing compared with what the narty owed to him. (Hear, hear.) His services at the bar, in Parliament, and on the bench were during his whole life given to his country; and throughout he WaS one of the most distinguished ornaments of the great party to which he belonged. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the article which had been read, it was, no doubt, strictly speaking, a breach of the privileges of their lordships' House, hut of what use would it be to contend with the press in such cases as these 9He remembered that on one occasion his friend Mr. Maroiot was represented in a newspaper as having said at a public meeting in the city that hewould not go in procession tothat "d-dold charch." meaning some particular church in the city of London. He felt much annoyed at the circumstance, and wrote a letter to the editor, in which he stated that his actual words were that he would not go to that " damp old church." (A laugh.) The next day there appeared in the newspaper a statement to this effect :-"We have given a place in our columns to the contradiction which MIr. Mariott has made: but, at the same time, we think it right to say that we have referred the matter to our reporter, who is certain that he used the words 'd-d old church," and to add that we have the most perfect confidence in the accuracy of our reporter." (Great laughter.) The gentleman complained to him of that treatment, and he (Lord Brougham) recommended him in future not to be too hasty in contradicting any statement that might appear in a newspaper. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DONOUGHMORE did not intend to press his motion, but regretted that the two members of the Goverument who had spoken had not expressed a stronger feeling upon the subject of an insult offered to one of their lordships. The Marquis of LANSDOWN.E hoped the noble earl would not consider he intended to offer any disrespect to the late Lord Plunket, for whom, on the contrary, he entertained the highest respect. He had not the honour of being acquainted with the present Lord Plunket, who took little part in public affairs, but he regretted much that he should have been treated with even apparent disrespect. The Earl of MALMESBURY declared his concurrence in the opinions expressed by the noble earl near him (Lord Derby) that the writer of the article in question was utterly unworthy of being brought so near to their lordships' House as even to the bar thereof. (" Hear" and a laugh.) He was glad therefore that the noble earl who made the motion did not intend to press it, but at the same time he must ay that, inasmuch as freedom of action in debating and voting In that House ought to be protected, it was to be lamented that the membes of the Government had not treated the insult offered to Lord Plunket in a mora becoming manner. After a few words from Lord DE,;=NA,i the discussion terminated. HARBOURS OF REFUGE. Lord RAVENSWORTH presented several petitions praying for the formation of a harbour of refuge on the north-eastern coast. The noble lord said the subject vas one of great importance, as the loss of life and property upon the coast amounted to a frightful annual total, which the petitioners believed would be greatly diminished by the establshment of a harbour of refuge. He found it stated that no less than one-fourth of the whole number of reported wrecks upon the shores of the united kingdom occurred within 70 miles of the rivers Tyne and Wear. The noble duke near him (Northumberland), who had been so active in everything that would tend to promote the welfare of the sailor and the preservation of lives from ship- wrec;r, WOutd, he Was sure, concur in his statement that the establishment of a harbour of refuge on the north-east coast was a matter of primary importance. He observed that the Vice-President of the Board of Trade had moved in the other House for a committee, not to consider the propriety of establishing harbours of refuge, but whether it would be expedient to make any further grants for that purpose. He hoped that the inquiry, although so limited, wud extend to the consideration of the whole quesion, (Hear, hear.) Another part of the notice which he had placed on the paper was a motion for the production of tvwo letters addressed by Mr. W. A. Brooks, of Newcastle, to the Secretary of the Admiralty, dated respectively the 26th of December, 1856, and the 20th of February, ir the present year. Of Mr. Brooks he knew nothing, except through the medium of correspondence, but he understood he was an engineer of abilitv and eminence in the employment of the Commission for the Navigation of the Tyne, who, so far back as 1S52, submitted to the Admiralty plans for the construction of a harbour of refuge in the bay of Redcar, on the coast of Yorkshire. He would not trouble the House by alluding to the letter of the 26th of December, 1856, but would state that in the second letter. dated the 20th of February in the present year, Mr. Brooks informed the Secretary of the Admiralty that during the heavy gales of the previous month no fewer than 94 ships were wrecked on the north-eastern coast, of which about 20 were seen to founder with their crews on board, and that at least 200 mariners were hurried into eternity within the short period of 12 days. It was impossible that their lordships coald listen to such facts unmoved. He had no doubt thev would assst himn in impressing upon the Government the extreme Importance of giving attention to the statements of Mr. Brooks, and of providing for the exigencies of trade and commerce and the security of shiDping by censtructing harbours of refuge on the north-eastein coast. (Hear, hear.) There was a feeling abroad that undue faveuritism had been shown to the southern coast, and therefore he proposed to ask for a return with regard to the works now going on at Dover and Jersey. The works at the former place were very extehsive, and their situation bad been condemned by an experienced engineer. A commnittee of the House of Cammons had been appointed to inquire into this subject, and ho ventured to saythat this committee would not separate without information being laid before it of the kind he now required. The harbour now making at Dover would cost an enormous amount before it was completed, and it was doubted whether it would confer proportionate advantages upon the mercantile nmarino. He entreated their lordships to consider the magnitude and frequency of disasters at sea. The exports of this countryreachedthe annualvalue of 123,00,OOO(l., and the imports amounted to a similar sum. Let their lordships remember the vast amount of tonnage employed in our foreign trade, independent of that great coasting trade along the north-ea3t coast of England and Scotland which was carried on between the ports of the Humber, Scarborough, Whitby, Hartlepool, Durham, Newcastle, Berwick, Edin. burgh, Dandee, and Aberdeen. The noble lord concluded by moving for correspondence between Mr. W. A. Brooks, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with the Secretary of the Admiralty, of the 26th of December, 1856, and the 20sth of February, 1857 ; and also estimates for the formation of the whole of the works requisite for the completion of tbse harbour now in course of construction at Dover; and that a plan of the said hatbour, with soundings, do accompany such return, distinguishing that portion of the work first contracted for and completed, and also that portion now contracted for and in course of constructon; and that longitudinal and transverse sections of the piers or works rbe slso fsunished with the pI ln; and also similar estimates for tho completion of the harbours nlow formsng at Jersey and Alderney, together with plans and sections as above described for Dover h hrbour. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY was sensible of the Importance of this subject. If it were the duty of the Government to expend money in building a harbour of refuge on the north-east coast, it would be impossible for him, on the part of the Government, to state what place would be selected for that purpose. The question of harbours of refuge had been referred to a committee of the other House, asXd they would, no doubt, report their opinion to the House whether the puboi money ought to be granted for the construction of one or more harbours of refage on the north-east coast. He had no objection to a return of the estimated expense of the works in progress at Dover, Jersey, and Alderney, but it would be impossibleto give the noble lord the details he required without a larger expenditure than it would be proper to incur. He therefore proposed that the return shouid be confined to tho money expended and the amount required to complete the works in question. The return, as amended, was then ordered to be made. JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES ACT AMENDMENT BILL. This Bil went through committee. The County Cess (Ireland) Bill and the Grand Juries (Ireland) Act (1836) Amendment Bil went through commsittee.

ELECTION PETITION. The SPEAKER announced that he had received a letter from the petitioners against the return for the borongh of bunderland, stating that it was not their intention to "*oceed with the petition. The petition was then ordered to be discharged. RETURN FOR MARLBOROUGH. Mr.. SEYMER brought up the report of the select committee appointed to try the petition of Mr. W. D Lewis, TOmphuning of the return for the borough of Marlborough. The decision ofthe committee was, that Mr. H. B. Baring had been duly elected a burgess to serve in the present Parliament for the borough of Marlborough. PETITIONS.

AUSTRALIAN MATT,, Mr. H. BERKELEY asked what arrangements had been made to supply, tho interruption in tho steam postal contract service with AustraUa, in consequence of tho accident to the maU steampacket Oneida, and whether the maU duo in the next month might be expected in the proper course at Suez or by tho long sea route by Capo Horn; also, whether it was true, as formaUy stated in the Sydney newspapers, that the same portion of tho machinery whioh broke down on her passage between King George's Sound and Point de GaUe had been previously damaged whUe she was employed as a Government transport, and patched up with iron plates at Glasgow before her departure upon the Australian mail service; further, whether such damage was reported to tho Government bythe Admiralty Surveyor? Sir C. "WOOD saidthat a vessel caUed the Emeu had been sent out to take the place of tho Oneida, but it was impossible for him to say whether tho mail due next month would arrive at Suez or would be conveyed by Cape Horn, as that would depend upon tho arrangements that might bo found to be necessary. The machinery of tho Oneida was surveyed by the Admiralty surveyor, and reported to be unfit for service. Why she went out ho (Sir C. Wood) did not know. THE MUTINY TN INDIA. On the order of the day for going into Committee of Supply, Mr. DISRAELI rose and said,-The Houso wiU hardly feel surprised if; in the present state of pubUo affairs, before we go into Committee of Supply, or discuss any of the motions of whioh notice has been given, I mako somo inquiry of Her Majesty's Government respecting tbe present condition of our Indian empire. (Hear, hear.) It is only a very few years sinco we wero involved in a war which, if not of unexampled magnitude, was of an importance seldom equalled in our history-a war in which this country mado very great sacridoes of blood and treasure. The pnbuo debt and tho taxation of the country were considerably increased, aud somo of the best lives of our f eUow-citizens were lost in that encounter. StiU the nation never for a moment murmured at that great sacrifice. The country was enthusiastic, and Pariiament was unanimous in supporting Her Majesty and Her Majesty's Government in the late war with Russia. But I beUeve that both the people and the ParUament wero greatly induced to take the high line of conduct which they pursued on that occasion because they believed tbat thepoUcy of Russia had a tendency to endanger our Indian empire. WeU, Sir, no sooner had peace been proclaimed, and happily proclaimed, between Russia and England, than we found ourselves involved in another war-a war with Persia. For a long timo the cause of that war was unknown, and its object, to say tha least of it, perplexing. But the country and Parliament submitted with great forbearance to the wanfc of information whichthen prevaUeduponthe subject, becausethere was* general impression that the .relations betireon Persia and England were of a nature very difficult and l*^0-'that tie "Crests of our Indian empire were inTolvedra a right appreciation and management of tliote relations; and that the independence of Persia must bs> maintained in order to form a barrier between our rival* and our Indian empire. WeU, Sir, tbe last documeni which completed the peace between this country and Eusai* has only recently been signed; tho ratification of the peao* between this country and Persia h*, been onjr reflent.T i^ on the table; and then we found ourselves involved ia* hird war-a war with China, ft could not be saidthat tbo aidthat it was necessary to maintain China as a barrier BulT^" M^f T0UI« ?neaie*-»a o« Indian empire. 2onH?r > ^ the Utm0Bfc eeaseqnence thaiT hould not permit for a moment the sUghtest indignity ot supposed.indignity to be endured by our fl^miZ iT^l^i£1** ^Pe^eethattherepuS of England in aU Eastern countries should bo maintainednviolate otherwise our Indian empire would be S the, maio^Tl V1** *»* "* ^ toeee rZTst the majority of theHouse, and perhaps of the country^ have contentedly been involved within the last five yearsia three great Eastern wars; because, however great tho sacrifice, however great the exertions necessary, however great the caU upon our resources, there was ageneralopiniora that nothmg could be shunned or spared when the safety oE our Indian empire was at stake. WeU, now, after thes* great exertions, wo find the existence of our Indian empire is indeed imperiUed-not by the action of any foreign* powers, whose movements both as regards placo andtinU would-require a considerable interval to elapsg before they conld Uke effect upon our position, but our Indian empire is nowendangered, not by the manoeuvres and machinations ot our declared foes, but by internal enemies, in » form thai; we could not possibly have expected. We learn within tba last eight-and-forfy hours that the ancient capital of Ein* dostan is no longer in our possession. And in whose possession is it ? It is in the possession of our insunectionarr and rebelhouB troops. Surely this is a position of affair* wWb requires us to demand from Her Majesty's Ministers that they shouldthrow some Ught upon it, give u^lomiX formation as to its causes, and, above all, tell us what they propose to do at this emergency. (Hear.) Sir, the infor. matron that has reached us within the last 24 hours communicates the most important events that have occurred, oertamly in my pubUo life, and, I should think, in that of most present. Whatever may be the vari. ous views and emotions which members of this House or the country generally may entertain at this intelligence I am quite sure there is one predominant sentiment to which,' aU others, howover important, must be subordinated, and: that is » determination to support tbe Sovereign and th* Government in all thoso measures which so grave and raided an emergency may require. (Cheers.) I am quite sure that tho spirit of this country is so high, its resources are so gisat, that there is nothing the peopla are not prepared to endure, no expenditure which they are not pre. pared to incur, and no effort which they are not prepare* to make in order to maintain that empire which it is tha boast of this country ro long to have possessed, and which. s one of the greatest sources of our wealth, our power, anrl our'authority. (Hear, hear.) Bat, if I have not imperfectly expressed the general feeling of the House, I hope ifc s not unreasonable in me to inquire of Her Majesty's Ministers whether they are prepared to respond to these sentiments ina manner congenial-whether tbey are pre pared m» manner adequate to the occasion to carry thesefeeUngs into action. I think, Sir, we should notbedoim* our duty if we lost a moment before making this inquiry of the Government. I Bhould be glad therefore to hear to-night thayswhether as regards their power or their promptitude, those measures witt be taken. whichare calculated to vindicate the honour and the authority of this country, and to maintain our interests in India. I hink, Sir, that is the first and paramount inquiry which under these circumstances we are bound to make of Her Majesty's Government; and I think it is one on which wa have a right to expect a full and frank communication. Bui I should not be performing what I deem to be my duty as a. member of this House if I paused here and rested satisfied with such an inquiry alone. I think we have a right fc> expect fromHer Majesty's Government that they should tell us to-night what in their opinion is the cause of thesa great disasters. (Cheers.) This calamity has not been of a sudden nature,- there have been, and for no inconsiderable period, dark rumours from India whioh have made mea anxious and thoughtful. There has been an occurrence of many perplexing incidentsin that country which, no doubt, cannot have been lost upon the attention and consider*. tion of men charged with the responsible dnty of administering the affairs of a great empire. I want, therefore*tc>___ know not only what in the opinion of the Government has been the main cause of these calanvtous events, but whether they were forewameci. I wish to know whether in their opinion the cans. is poUtical or religious, whether it has originated ia the maladministration of our affairs or in some burst of fanaticism which ought perhaps to have been foreseen evert if it could not have been prevented. I wish to know whafc has been tho nature of the communications received by tha Government from the highest authorities in India, military and civU, npon this subject. I wish to know whether it bo true or untrue that, months ago, the highest miUtary authority in India warned Her Majesty's Ministers of the unsatisfactory state of our army there. I wish; to know whether thero have been placed before the. Ministry statements and complaints that our army in Lnciiv is under-officered. I wish to know whether it has been represented to Her Majesty's Government that the habit oE employing our regimental officers in civil and diplomatic services, without substituting men of equal experience and rank in their places, has exercised an injurious influence upon tho discipline and the spirit of the army. I wish to know whether the civil and the military authorities of India have been in accord as to the inform?Mon they have given and the representations they havo madewhether the highest civU authority in India is not agreed with the highest miUtaryauthority there in the poUcy which he recommended andthe views which he wished to enforce. I would ask even of Her Majesty's Ministers whether the. Governor-General of India at this moment has resigned the. high office which he held. These are subjects which X S^m*el*h?Sircm2.sta?C8s' Her Majesty's Ministers should not shrink from frankly meeting. (Hear.) I have refrained from entering into any controversial question. If it be necessary that the Government of India should be brought under the consideration of this House, nodoubt a.fitting opportunity will be offered for doing so. I have confined myself to asking questions which I believe, anxiously occupy the pubUc attention at this moment, which appear to me to be proper and fair inquiries to address tothe Government, and to which I trust I shaU receive a frank and full reply. I would presume before I sit down, Sir. to make only one observation on the state of India. No one can for a moment shut his eyes to the extreme peril to whicbj at this moment our authority is subject in that countrybnt I cannot say, little as my confidence has ever been in the Government of India, that I take those despairing or desperate views with respect to our position in that country which in moments of danger and calamity are too often prevalent. I would express my opinion-an opinion which I have before expressed in this House-that the tenure by which, we hold India is not a frail tenure (hear, hear); but when we consider that that greatcountry is inhabited by 25 nations different in race, different in reUgion, and different in Ian. guage, I think it is not easy, perhaps it is not possible, for such heterogeneous elements to fuse into perfect combination. Everything, however, is possible, every disaster Is practicable, if there be an inefficient or negligent Government. (Hear, hear.) It is to prevent such evils that I think the House of Commons is performing its highest duty lf it takes the earUest opportunity after the inteUigence has arrived-inteUigence which has produced great alarm in, thecapital of Hor Majesty's empire-of inviting Her Majesty's Ministers frankly to express to Parliament what in. their opinion is tho cause of tho great calamity that has occurred, and, above all, what aro the means which they intend to take-and at once to take-in order to encounter tbe. peril before ns, and to prevent the evil consequences which may be apprehended. (Cheers.) Mr. V. SMITH.-I rise, Sir, readily to respond, as far as> the occasion wiU permit, to the call of the right hon. gentle)' man, and certainly no one can feel the least surprise, conadenng the grave inteUigence whioh has como from India, that a gentleman occupying so prominent a position in pub, fo affairs as therighthon. gentleman should make some inquiries respecting the state of that country. In what ha. fallen from the right hon. gentleman I have Uttle to gains ly ortocontradict,withtheexception, perhaps, of theobserrati in. that the Russian war was conducted entirely for the security of our Indian empire. Sir, the Russian war was not conducted entirely for the security of our Indian empire. If ifc had been we should stiU be waging it; because I belieya that if any persons wore sorry for the conclusion of tha"; war, they were the residents of India and the Indian Go-' vemment. They would have wished that Power to have been infinitely more thwarted than it was, and tohave beer* beaten infinitely further from tho approaches to the Indiirr, empire. The right hon. gentleman asked the Government what advices they had received from India, and what preparations they were about to make to put an end to tbe evUs occurring there; and theright hon. gentleman added, in a, manner beBtting the occasion, and which did honour t» himself, that the House of Commons would be prepared to place at tho disposal of Her Majesty suy means whatever that might be required to bring the war to au end. (Cheers.) Her Majesty's Government have been fully alive to thai and, feeling confidence in the House of Commons, they have> immediately decided upon sending out reinforcements of European troops to India (ctteers). btlfc h ft woul be satisfactory that I should state witb thoutmost frankness and *^°Tanng of detail what those xeinforoemente are. In the middle of next month I hope-the transport? *

LOADOA, TUESDAY, J.UE 30, 1857. In the House of Lordr last night, The Earl of ELLP.NBorouGH called the attention of the House to the great calamity which threatened British rule in India, and, after entering at con 'siderable length and w.ith great fox into the intelligence brought by the lat mail, asked whet ze- the Government intended to take in themwe gency., I Lord G.RA-vsmvreplied that before thearrival of the recent news 10,000 men, consisting of four fresh regiments and reinforcementsfor regimento already serving in India, had been placed under orders for embarcation. Since that news arrived four more regiments had received the same orders, makingin all about 14,000 men. lifithregardto the position of affairs in India the Government had every reason tobe satisfied with the energy and determination displayed by the Lieutenant-Governors of the districts in which attempts at mutiny had I occurred, while with regard to the Govus ouGzNz. RAL himself letters had been received from him in which, while discussing the events which had taken place with all due gravity, he apoke so cheeefully of the ultimate result as to inspire the Government with the greatest confidence. After some further discussion, in which Lords BROJGHAIIA3, ADfswIx, and ALBsssnT.stookpart, the matter dropped. Lord DoNouonEmor then called the attention of the House to a breach of privilege committed, as he alleged, on Lord PILuxzT by an article m the Examiner newspaper, which he seemed to regard in a most serious light. Lord GRA.-vmaE could not regard the article in the same light. He thought the House would not gain by perpetual collisions with t4e press. Lord DuRsy followed in an exaggeration of the same strain as Lord DoNouoGInopii. He thought the article in question most coarse and scandalous, and heaped upon it and the writer every condemns. tory epithet. LordLsA.sDovwnthoughtthe step pro oeedabsurd. It their Lordlaips were to take notice of every, article of this kind they would be eccupiiecl ront Monday til Saturday in every week. After some further discwsion the matter dropped in the midst of a tirade pronounced by Lord D.zir.uiN against the reporters who refused to report his speeches. Some other business was then despatched, and their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, on the order for going into Committee of Supply, Mr. DIsRABi rose to put a question to the Government relative to the present state of our Indian empire. After glancing at the war with Rusnia, the hostilities with ersia, and our subsisting hostile relations with the Chinese, he observed that we found, after the great exertions made in these wars, that our extensive Indian empire was endangered, not by the machinations of apparent external foes but by an internal enemy; that Delhi was actually in the_poession of our own rebellious native troops. He asked for some informationasto the causes of this state of things, and what wat intended to be done in this emergency. He hoped it was not unreasonable to inquire what measures had been taken, or were about to be taken, to vindicate the honour and power of this country. He thought the House had a right to expect from Ei MAJrsTy's Government that they should tell the House what was the cause of these great disasters, and not only what was the main cause of the calamitous events, but whether they had been forewarned.; whether the cause was political or religious; whether they originated in the maladmiinitration of officials or in a sudden outbreak of fanaticism; whether the civil authority in India and the military authority were of accord; and, lastly, whether the GovERxoi.-GzNxAL had resigned his high office. Mr. V. Sssrr, premising that no one could feel surprise at the questions put by Mr. DisRAur, said that HEB MAJESYSs Government had determined immediately to send out a reinforcement of European troops to India; In the middle of next month nearly 10,000 menwould be sent, and the Court of Directors had applied for 4,000 more. This was a measure of security, for he denied that our empire in India was imperilled by the disasters referred to by Mr. DiSBAnL verything that could be done was doing in India; he had no doubt that the mutiny would be put down by force, and he hoped that the next mail would announce that ample retri- bution had been taken upon the mutineers. As_ to the cause of the disaffection, he had difficulty; but the question would undi the closest investigation by the Indian Govment. HEe knew notbing of any difference tween the GOVERNOR-GENERAL of IxDn& and J Cosm)wDER -i-CmoF, and had no reason to3-- lieve that there was any material differenc0f opinion between them. He gave a flat deni$o the report of the resignation of the GovEigGasNaRG, who, he predicted, wrould prove hi*lf equal to the occasion. Sir H. WRW ouoHBeY asked the CHEOnerToR le ExcnEQtB for an explanation as to the purchibf 287.6001. Three per Cent. stock and 2,470,000xchequer.bills, and as to the sale of 2,384,0301. t per Cent. stock and 111,0001. lxchequer-billbelonging to the trustees of savings-banks, in tWear ending the 20th of November, 1856. He wial to know what was the meaning of this gigantic bckjobbing transaction effectecdwithout the knacdge of that House. The On"cxaxoR of the ExCEHERus saide inquiry raised two questions-first, as to the eral poley of the proceeding; second, as to the iduct of the Government in the particular transions. With regard to the first, Parliament had. in to the Government the power of varying the:urty or changing the deposit of the savings-bankunds, I and he affirmed that a legal power existed ftevery act done by himself and his predecessorA this matter ever since the savings-banl-s' mT had been placed in the hands of the Goviment, whieh was rebponsible for losses, and aong as the preast law remained unaltered it uld be the duty of the CnAixcaoR of the ExcBEBR to make such use of this large sum as would tst conduce to the public interests, without impa3g the security of the savings-banks' money. .Ushould therefore continue to act upon what he idered to be a correct interpretation of the Lau4id bear the reproach of being a stockjobber, so l as he considered the public interests called for action. If Parliament should altcr the law in t1 matter, he must acquiesce; but he warned the Ese that the alteration would subject the public certain loss. He then gave a detailed explanati of the transaction in question, from which hlaid tho samvings-banks had been gainers. Mr. GLYH admitted that the C eN of the ExcRsQuSR had not exceeded the limiof the law; but he thought something should }done to regulate the action of the Government on this |large amnount of stock, which the CH;nOB of the ExcaxEqu ought not to be allowred loperate upon without somne limitation, and withti lying annual accounts of them before Parliamenj Mr. MaLms complainedcof the Cscof the ExcHEQUEu having the power of goingnto the rnoney-market with a fictitious trasacti- for the purpose of raising the price of particular burities, -what was called, in Stock-Exchange pb elogy, " rigging the markiet." If he had been fitly informed, this bad been done in regard to lihequer bills.; Mr. WEOuani defended the course ta" by the Cn"CELLOR of the EXcnmQuER, whosower to deal with saviDgs-banks' funds he hopedEre House would not consent to take away. After ome conversation, in which is CEANCELLOB of the EXacHEQuER, Air. Srooi,-Eiand AMr. AxYRTo took part, the subject dropped. . MÃ¯Â¿Â½r. RPicis called attention to the rest of the Commissioners on the Superannuation , recommending an immediate increase of 70,(31. a-year to theuaisriesof the civilservant, with a ospective increase of 30,0001. a-year more. The CHAxCELOR of the ExcuzQunBUggeSted that as Lord NAAs had a motion upon ss aubject fedt for this (Tuesday) night, it would better to defer the discussion til then; but Mr. RIon declined to act upon this 4ggestion, and delivered a speech of considerablele4h, entering into many details. Lord NTAAs complained of Mr. Rrc'dlegard of the usual courtesy of the Housein foresilling this question and making an ex parte statemht aware that the CHANCxLLOR of the EXCHHQUER 1 other members who had spoken already upon tht luestion could not address the House aain Mr. LAuoucnnu entreated the House sod to engage in such a discussion upon the questicb ,f going into a Committee of Supply. Lord J. RussxF. hoped the Governme would not delay a 5tatement of their views upon tis subject. The Hous%aeu, weat into, a committee of Supply
The explanation of political disaster is so ex,ceedingly easy, its causes lie about in such lavish profusion, and so ready for choice, that men of much feeling or judgment are apt to leave the task to a lighter class of politicians. It might be expected that nothing could be more easily explained than an occasional check, an untowvard event, or a sinister omen, in an empire acquired in the course of one long lifetime by the inhabitants of a small State over a hundred and fifty millions on the other side of the world. If the natives of Ilindostan were not fickle, excitable, volatile, easily misguided, credulous, and apt to disgrace themselves by scandalous ex-cesses of folly and cruelty, they would not lie at the mercy of conquerors. They would never have faUen into British hands, and Fort William would have remained a mercantile establishment, or passed into history, like the British " Factories" in the Levant. They are, however, of that nature which places them necessarily under a superior race, and the only question is who shall govern them, for they never will be able to govern themselves. It would take little argument to show that we are, in the present state of the world, the natural, and in a sense the rightful lords, of Hindostan. With naval supremacy and an unrivalled extent of commerce we combine physical strength, political skill, and an unequalled power of adapting ourselves to climate. 'These qualities give us such a manifeit superiority over other possible rivals that if any one of them should by chance WI -st India from us, or if it should 'itself for a time drive us into the sea, we should probably reconquer the whole country and hold it more strongly than ever in the course of ten years. Nevertheless, this dominion, inevitable and natural *as we regard it, is a sort of standing marvel. By means of 40,000 Europeans-the number of men in one of our second-rate towns-we hold more than a seventh part of the whole human race, the greater part of them situated under a burning sun, many hundreds of miles from the sea. In every race of men, in every form of society, and in every variety of religiorn there must be that which revolts from subjection even to a kind master; so we really cannot feel ourselves indebted to anybody who proposes to enlighten us as to the sources of Indian disaffection. Lord ELLENBOROUGH may be an authority on the subject, but there are points on which authority itself is superfluous, or where its forwardness provokes suspicion. Why should Lord ELLENBORulcH be so anxious to show how it is that with one European for 4,000 natives we have not been able always and everywhere to prevent a surprise ? Why need he deplore the neglect of forebodings, not only delivered after the disaster, but not even yet known to those who alone could profit bythewarning? Were it at all worth the while, nothing would be easier than to prove Lord ELLESBOROU(GH himself a contributor to the misfortunes of which he boasts himself a prophet. 'The rapid extension of our Indian frontier, the exhaustion of Indian finance, and the drain of . military officers for civil employ are among the causes given for these events; and his Lordship has had something to do with them all. But even in performing the very lightest task ,hat ever attracted an idle legislator, Lord ELLEN.MoitouGu might have done some real service to 'h countiy. lHe might have given us something more substantial than gloomy remarks on the intense heat. of the season, on the want of a local police sufficient to dispense with the presence of soldiers, -on the unknown character of the officer in coinmand at Meerut, and on the fortunate folly or malice displayed in the neglect of a certain tank at Delhi. lie might have given some suggestions znore to the purpose than the raising of our Militia and the exercising of our Yeomanry. He -meed not have given the weight of his Indian reputation to the story that our authorities there are not so well agreed as might be on all possible questions. In a word, he might have made a %peech that would have been read with pleasure, with the sense of sympathy and support, and with real benefit by those IIow charged with -the responsibility of these affaLrs. That, however, appears to have been the very last object in Lord :ELLNBoRouoIn's view. In the absence, therefore, oDf that flood of official experience which we should maturally look for, we are compelled to take a very simple and ordinary view of the case-one which it needs no Ex-Governor-General to teach us. It appears to us the most likely thing in the world that an immense, well paid, and unemployed smative army, outnumb6ring the Europeans nearly in the ratio of ten to one, having just now no excitement of fears or hopes, no enemy to repel, no conquest to make, and nothing whatever to do but to dwell on the fact of subjection, on native grievances, and on the decay of their religion, before increasing intelligence rather than spreading Christianity, should break the dull tenour of their lives with complaints and agitation, rising here and there, more by accident, perhaps, than of settled purpose, into actual and ibloody revolt, Even the placid Hindoo is not made for a torpid existence. He must be stirred and ventilated; and the remedy itself, violent and dreadful as it must necessarily be, will, no doubt, have a salutary effect on the whole, and give a more decided tone and a stronger current to Indian opinion and feeling. The immediate deficiency is plain enough, and happily it is in the course of correction, if not already corrected. While conqnest has been spreading west, east, and north, and while, besides the addition of immense provinces in those direc- tions, we have been withdrawing troops from India to chastise the insolence of Persians and Chinese, we have left the very heart of our Oriental Empire-the Preslfeney of Bengal-almost denuded of European soldiers. From Calcutta to Delhi, a distance of 900 miles, a march of three months, a dense population, great cities, and important positions are left almost entirely to native troops, dangerously aware of our excessive anxiety to conciliate their attachment. It was necessary to temporize even at Barrackpore until the single European regiment there was reinforced with another from Pegu. While several British Regiments have been employed in holding our new acquisitions in the extreme East, a still greater number have been doing the like service in the Punjab. Thus the real sinew and thews of a great empire have been at its extremities, and the heart has been left to take care of itself. The wellguarded frontier has been treated as a dep6t whence troops could be drawn on an emergency, without duly considering that it is the office of an army to prevent attacks rather than put them down, and that a crisis of insurrection is not exactly the time for leaving border provinces less guarded. WVe should not be surprised to hear that those in conimand at Lahore and elsewhere, though ever so confident of their position, under present circumstances are not prepared to spare much of their garrisons. The chief, if not the only tling, to be done is to pour what reinforcements we can into Bengal from the sea; and, though it may be a matter of time to do all, something is done already, and the rest will soon follow. With unexampled despatch, several thousand Britisi soldiers have already arrived at Calcutta from the Persian Gulf. By this time probably some of the troops sent out to Clhina have been stopped in tra7isitu at Point de Galle, and detained for a still more urgent service. Before the middle of next month 14,000 British soldiers will have left these shores for India. All Indian officers on leave of absence have been ordered to return without delay, and in a very short time the Government of India will find itself in a position to calTy ont any measures whatever that it may deem necessary to the restoration of discipline. As for Delhi, there can be little doubt that by the end of last month the insurgents, caught in their own trap, and failing of support from the neighbouring Princes, were at the mercy of the COMMANDER-IN-CRIEF, who, with a rapid concentration of forces, -was expected to arrive there on the 26th. His absence at Simla certainly was illtimed, but we believe the unavoidable consequence of illness. He is said to be a man of energy and decision. His acts seem to show these qualities, and he will certainly have need of them; for our empire in India will not be worth a year's purchase if he does not take all the vengeance enjoined by the code of humanity itself on the perpetrators of the massacre of Delhi.
When a person is found, either in real life or romance, continually boasting that he is a gentleman or a man of courage, we at once set hire down for an ad-venturer or a poltroon. The QusN in HAmLETS play was immediately suspected even by her prototype because she protested too much. We are all on our guard against patriots who have a disinterested love of the people, and martyrs who will undergo any suffering in a good cause. In fact, self-assertion is in most things a very mistaken policy. bven the quack doctor at a fair does not blow his own trumpet, and generally any man or body of men who come forward with their own praises and pretensions in their mouths will soon find the world somewhat scornful and suspicious listeners. The most unfortunate instance of this want of tact is given by the Conservative Party. Look at any publication, daily, weekly, or monthly, devoted to their interests, and you will generally find a dissertation or a panegyric on the party as a party. The Conservative writers and speakers are as . constant to this subject as a certain class of preachers are to their one sermon, in which they compress the whole of Christianity into 40 minutes. We are continually told in an indignant tone that the Conservative Party is nwt extinct ; that it stands on an immoveable basis ; that it contains the great body of the landed proprietors, the clergy, and the mercantile men; that, while undesirous to snatch too hastily the reins of power, it is ready to undertake the government of the country whenever it may be called upon. As if these themes were not sufficiently elementary, the Conservative organs even undertake the metaphysical proof of the existence of their body. It is shown from the nature of the human mind that there must be people who wish to go too fast, and others who wish to go slowly, or just fast enough ; and Conservatives are said to answer the latter description. But this is all we can obtain from them. Their whole reasoning is devoted to the proof that they exist and are respectable; everything else must be taken on trust. Why they are a party, and in what they differ from the public, what it is they wish to conserve which other people wish to destroy, what they mean by their withering denunciations of " Pseudo-Liberalism" and " reckless " legislation," are mysterHes to the great body of their countrymen. With consistency ever in their mouths they have within 30 years accepted some hundreds of measures which they had bitterly opposed ; with a great pretence to sagacity and foresight, they are unable to tell us what course they will take on any question of the future, and with a continual assertion of high principles they are undeniably guilty of shrouding every subject in a mist of generality. Yesterday saw the beginning of a new attempt to argue the cause of Lord DEnBY's following before the country. A daily contemporary which has long, with more goodwill than success, advocated the priaciples of so-called Conservatism,has, weare informed, passed under a new management, and will henceforth stand in the closest relation to the leaders of the Conservative party. Now, so far as such a change gives promise of increased ability and enterprise in the conduct of the journal in question we can only express our gratification at its having taken place. There can be no greater mistake than to believe that it is to the interest of The Times to be without rivals, or that our own position is raised by the fact that one of our contemporaries is dragging on a painful existence, neither succeeding nor deserving to succeed. The great increase of population, wealth, and instruction allows a well-conducted daily newspaper every chance of prosperity, and we trust that for the future the Moming Herazd will have its share. But if anything could injure such an enterprise it would be the connexion with a party which has nothing to say for itself, and yet can never hold its peace. Let us take the manifesto with which our contemporary commences its new career. As a general rule, such a production is carefully written, and places in the best light the plinciples which it is intended to advocate. We may therefore consider the article to be an exponent of the Conservative creed as it is held in the year 1857. It is first premised that parties must exist, of which one must be Conservative. This being a great political law, we next learn the practical results which it is to have in the present day. What is the ist article, then, of the Conservative b-lief ? One can hardly imagine that perverseness eo?ald be esried so far s to. commence with a da &"ation d a stility ts, Xhe Jow Bill, "Every member of the Legislature who contri"butes to make Christian laws should be himself a "Christian," and so on. Next to exclusive Christianity comes, of course, exclusive Protestantism. The British Constitution repudiates the Papacy, and it is the duty of every Govemment to uphold our Protestant institutions. Then comes a series of propositions which can only be answered on the principle of the phrase " Quis " vituperavit HERcuLEm ?" The Conservatives will defend the honour and rights of the CRow.T; they will uphold a proper representation of the people; they will base education on religion, and allow the established clergy to teach in all cases where the religious convictions of the parents do not oppose an obstacle. They are for a dignified foreign policy, for observing treaties, and for permitting all nations to regulate their own internal affairs. They would cease to govern Ireland by a Parliamentary faction, and would apply to her the same principles in legislation and administration as are applied to England. Now, as nine Englishmen out of ten will agree to all this, it is difficult to see how it can be distinctive of the Conservatives, and we are constrained to declare that, with the exception of Jewish disabilities, there is not a single question on which the Derbyite Party, as represented in their new organ, is bold enough to pronounce a definite opinion. This is not uerely prudent reticence-it is insincerity, but it is of a kind which is not likely to deceive any one. The state of things is perfectly' plain. The Conservative Party is now but the name for the following of some halfdozen politicians, with more or less ability and ambition, but with no policy and no pretence of a policy. To echo their speeches and applaud their votes on each separate subject may be easy enough, but to specify their creed or their intentions is beyond the power of the most confidential organ.
A careful consideration of the detailed reports now received from India confirms us in the opinions we have already expressed upon the character and prospects of the I1llitary Revolt. The affair, deplorable as it is, exhibits none of the features of a concerted rebellion. In the meantime, and for the relief of the anxieties naturally created by such a catastrophe, we collect a few of the facts reported in our correspondence, and indicate the conclusions which they plainly suggest. As evidence both of the strength of the Government and the want of concert among the disaffected we direct the attention of our readers to the dates involved in the various reports, and, above all, to the circumstance that the gravest of these occurrences-the seizure of Delhi by the mutineers-is neither the first nor the Iast of the events related in connexion with the Revolt. Since the first demonstration of a mutinous spirit among the Sepoys some months have now elapsed, so that the authorities will have had their warning, and have escaped the violent shock of a sudden and unanticipated outbreak. It is not, indeed, probable that such an explosion as that at Mleerut was expected, but the eyes of those in power must necessarily have been opened for some time past to the chances of disturbance. In the next place, whereas the seizure of Delhi occurred on the 11th of May, we have news from Bombay to the 27th, so that nearly three weeks had transpired since the first alarm, and during this interval every incident, as far as we are informed, was telling in favour of Government and against the mutineers. At Meerut especially was this the case. At this station, where the discontent of the Sepoys first showed itself in acts of sanguinary violence on the 10th of May, we are distinctly told that order was perfectly restored on the 12th, and not only that, but when, on the evening of the 16th, a detachment of native troops moving towards the town gave fresh occasion of disturbance, the new mutiny was promptly suppressed and the revolters dispersed. At Lucknow, the capital of Oude, where disaffection had manifested itself before the 10th, all was tranquil up to the 18th, while in the Punjab order was successfully maintained up to the last moment at whiclh advices from that province had reached Bombay. At Agra, again, everything, according to the latest intelligence, announced the uninterrupted authority of the Government. Taldng these facts in their aggregate significance, we observe two most important deductions naturally suggested :-fi-st, that although the spirit of mutiny had actually broken out and apparently done its worst at Barrackpore, Moorshedabad, Ferozepore, Lucknow, Meerut, and Delhi, stations representing in their connected scope the whole Presidency of Bengal, the movement had been fairly put down and kept down at five points out of the six, having been successful only in a single city, where no European troops happened to be quartered; and, secondly, that whereas the chief danger of. such a Revolt would lie in its rapid extension, we know with perfect certainty that for a week or ten days at least after the momentary triumph at Delhi the power of the British Government was undisputed throughout the whole country. Another point deserving especial attention is suggested by the localities at which the various outbreaks have occurred. The first was at Barrackpore, in the immediate vicinity of the seat of Government, where it was positively certain that the mutineers must be overpowered; the last was at Meerut, a station where the European portion of the garrison was notoriously superior in strength. It was only, in fact, during the first moments of a surprise that the revolters could get an opportunity for their work of blood. As soon as the Europeans could be turned out the danger was over, and the Sepoys who reached Delhi entered that city, not as succesoful insrlgents, but as fugitives. At Delhi they got the upper hand simply because there were no troops to oppose them, and it is evident that they betook themselves to this city, not upon any sub'le speculation, or from any desire to place a native Sovereign at their head, but merely because it was the nearest place of refuge when the Rifles and the Carabineers had driven them out of Meerut. These circumstances show distinctly that, though there might be very extensive discontent, there was no deeplaid or concerted conspiracy. The native soldiery were no doubt restless and disturbed at more stationsthan one, but open mutiny only broke out at hazard, and, as it happened, in all eases but one to the disadvantage of the mutineers. It must be remembered, also, that although a vast district, according to English notions of territory, has exhibited symptoms of the infection, the disorder is very far from being so extensive as might at first sight be imagined. India consists of three Presidencies, and of these one only has been disturbed. The Army of Bombay is free from even a suspicion of discontent; that of Madras, notwithstanding a manifestation of uneasiness in one particular regiment some time ago, is as yet loyal ; and from both Presidencies reinforcements have been promptly despatched to the Government of Bengal. Even in the Bengal Army itself, though the several battalions involved one after another in the Revolt represent a force of some 8,000 men, there is a very large portion which has given no cause of complaint, ando Qertain divisiora which are above all suspicion. At more thau one place lNS%iUve Regimn ts kv-.% #a firnvft, by their Comni Inanders, and -it is probable that the insurrection will have been extinguished at Delhi by the force of Bengal itself. If we look, indeed, to the actual position of the revolters every chance was against them. They have no officers, no leader, no commisaariat supplies, and no stock of ammunition. Even if we suppose that they comprise the bulk of five battalions their numbers would probably be under 3,000, while within 100 miles of them lay three European Regiments of Infantry, two of Cavalry, and a strong force of Artillery, their communications with the surrounding countrybeifg everywhere cut off. Up to this time none of the mutineers had ever ventured upon a regular combat with Europeans, but had invariablv " broken and fled" after the frst burst of frenzy. The whole affair, in fact, when scrutinized in all its features, exhibits the character of a senseless Revolt, based, perhaps, more on panic than any other sentiment, and utterly destitute of definite object. Notwithstanding the proclamation of a Mogul Prince, we do not believe that any idea of restoring a native dynasty existed anywhere but in the distempered brains of the Meerut fugitives, and there only,.in all probability, after they found themselves -by accident at Delhi, where this phantom of an extinct sovereignty was permitted to reside. As a final and conclusive proof of the soundness of these views we may appeal to a circumstance which, though not admitting of definite description, conveys evidence of the stronigest possible character. We allude to the general tone of feeling visible in the public journals and the general correspondence received from India, in no portion of which is any serious alarm to be discovered. Expressions of horror at the reported murders, of sympathy with the sufferers, and of misgivings as to the destiny of those whoso lot was unknown, are, of course, to be met with; but the events themselves are not spoken of as an overwhelming-scarcely as an absorbing catastrophe. At Calcutta the price of public securities had actuaUy risen, nor were commercial transactions materialy influenced by the news from Delhi; in fact, the inhabitants of the capital had gone through their own share of alarm, and expected evidently the same prompt re-establishment of order in the North-western Provinces, though there the outbreak had unfortunately been attended with more sanguinary results. At the prLpsent moment it is probable not only that the Delhi mutineers have been completely subdued, but that such an overpowering force of Europeans is at the command of the Bengal Government as will insure the Presidency against any recurrence of these lamentable disturbances. The work, however, will not have been accomplished by the mere restoration of order. When this has been effected the causes of disorder must be investigated, and the result, we sincerely trust, may yield us in the end some recompense for the trouble which has been experienced and the blood which has been and must be shed.
It has become our painful duty to render that ungrateful service to Lord DERBY which the Archbishop of GBnAu,DA required of GiT BLAS. If any one is curious to read the worst speech Lord DERBY ever made, we would refer hin to our Parliamentary Report of this day. Lord DERBY has made many good speeches-many very good speeches-in his time; it is instructive therefore to see how low in the depths of bathos such a man can sink when deserted by his better genius. The facts stand thus - In the Ezaminer of lust Sunday there appeared an amusing little article on the subject of the vote given by Lord PLuN ErT-the Bishop of Tuamagainst the second reading of the Ministers' MDney Bill. The writer briefly comnaemorrted the eminent services rendered by the late Mr. PzLu2eKE, subsequently Lord PLuNTET, the great Irish orator, to the cause of civil and religious liberty, and then treated it as an impossibility that the son of such a man could have taken the side of illiberality on such a question as that of the Ministers' Money Bill. "To the " success of Liberal principles, to the Liberal "party, and the Governments resulting from its "triumphs, the present Lord is indebted for all "that hepossesses and enjoys; for his mitre, for "his coronet, for his wealth, his rank, his " luxury, for every shred of his purple "and fine linen, for every glass that "sparkles and every dish that steams upon his table," &c. More follows of tie same sort. We quote a few words for the sake of those who may not have noticed this harmless and sparklin,g little squib. It is just the sort of thing that a political PATRFAmAs would read aloud to his family circle over the morning's tea and muffins; and the girls would laugh at papa, and the solemn butler would concentrate bis energies upon the cold meats at the sideboard, lest an untimely smile should be detected upon his face. Now, against this dish of trifle did an intelligent and discreet young Irish nobleman-Lord DONouGiroRrE-run full tilt last night in the House of Lords. About his effusion we will say nothing more than that it is just such an one as you would expect to hear in a debating society from a very young Irish gentleman, wellstuffed with adjectives, and of a very terrific and appalling nature. This Irish Lord, in the exercise of his discretion, concluded by moving that the printer of the Examinter should be summoned to the bar of their Lordships' House to answer for this grievous breach of privilege. Lord GnA'VIr.E immediately rose, and, with a few good-humoured words, did his best to pooh-pooh the absurdity out of court. Here should have been the natural termination of the incident. Not the very wisest member of their Lordships' House had made not the very wisest proposition which had ever been made in that illustrious assembly; and so the matter might have dropped. Lord DERBY, however, thought otherwise. Our first thought, we confess, on reading this remarkable effort of oratory was one of deep gratitude that Lord DEBBY was not a contributor to the columns of this journal. We should never be clear of informations if we were to permit ourselves such latitude of expresaion as this,-" The writer "of the article showed that he was an utter stranger to all honourable and gentlemanly "feeling .... The writer had ishown entire ignoCC rance both of the duties of aPeer of Parliament, " and of the obligations of a gentleman and a man <' of honour." Quorsum lure tamputida? All this good thunder and lightning was called forth simply because a political writer had expressed his surprise in a jocular way that the son of the great Lord pIurNr should be found on the side of intolerance and bigotry. Such seems to have been the opinion of Lord LA2?sDow2BB, who spoke after Lord DERBY, no doubt feeling acutely the ridicule which Lord DEBy was bringing on the proceedings of the House of Peers. " It appears to me," said Lord LAxSDOWxN, " that the article read by the noble Earl only "meant to represent that the right rev. pre"late was unlike his father who went before him." That is just it. There is not a word more to be said about the matter; and this was the occasion an old political stager like Lord DpaBY endeavoured to improve so notably. The only way we can explain the matter is, that befemr he had uttered two sentences Lord DERBY entis,jy forgot what he was- talking about, and real't, worked himself up by dint of his own cleA-,our into the belief ta3t he was speaking upouL a serioius sub- ject.

.HER MAJESTYS VISIT TO MANCEESTER. (FR03f GRR AUW vv.Pnvrvv I MANCHESTER, JUNFB 29. For once the business of Maanchester seems entirely suspended, and all thoughte are c*ncenrtated on the near approaching visit of Her A4esty. Every part of tho city rssounds with the note of prepartion, and triumphal arches, illuminations, flags, banners, and devices, throng tho streets and cover the gigantle warebouses. The disappointment caused by tho postponement of Her Majesty's anrival until 11 to-night baa been deep and wide. spread, though thousands still affect, to disbelieve in the announcement, and the concourse round the station at Patrieroft this evening will probably be notn much less than if the Royal visitors were certain to arrive. Tuesday il to be kept a strict and public holyday, and after 4 o'clock the Exhibition will be thrown open as usual to shilling visitors. During this visit of Her Majesty, as our readers are aware, the Court reside at Wersley-hall, the seat of the Earl of Ellesmere. This is the second occasion on which this noble residence has been so honoured. The last visit was in 1851, wrhen Her Majesty witnessed the assemblage of 60,000 school childten in Peel-park, and to commemorate which event the Prince Consort last month inaugurated the Queen's statue on the spot on which she stood on that occa. sion. Woraley-hall is about eight miles to the north of Manchester. The road to it from the city winds past Peel-park, through Pendleton and Pendlebury, to the little village of Worsley, from which the hall itself is only'distant about a-quarter of a mile. Parts of the road, especiaUy that through Pendleton, are picturesque enough'. lark grounds; mansions, and villa residences, with theli smooth lawns and clustering flower beds, enlose it in on either side. Other portions, however, are, to say the least, deficient in natural beauties. The road is sometimes doep with slag and cinders. Tallchimneysand monstrous cotton mills, with whole acres of windows, rsing story above story, supply the place of evergreens and rosaries, and cloae lanes, a smoky atmosphere, and the ceaseless clang of machinery remind the visitor that he is still in the heart Of the manufacturlng district-the busiest and most populous county in the empire. But all this is both unseen and unremembered at Woraley-hall, where quiet luxury and rura elegancies Eeem to reign supreme. A noble avenue conducts to the hail, which is situated in the midst of an extensive terraced garden. The mansion is built of stono In the Elizabethan style, and along the main or southern front Iun terraced gardens, with statues, fountains, and parterres, almost as large, and quite as beautiful in their way, as those which charm the visitor to Norwood. The prospect from the house is one of unequalled magnificence. The greater part of Stafford, Derby, and Cheshire stretch around and beneath it as in a map, theview on either side being bounded by the hils of Derbyshire and the mountains of South Wales. Immediately behind the hal rises the hill on which the old haUl is situated. The latter is a fine historic building, famous in the annals of Lancashire, but having a most modernized aspect just now, for its moat has been filled up and converted into a long parterre, while roses and flowering creepers have so covered the old edifice itself as to make it resemble an extended cottage o-i6ec rather than a mansion, which once held out against the fierce Independents of Cromwell. At the foot of the hil and in front of the modern hall runs the celebrated Bridgewater Canal, down which, on the occasion of her private visit to the Art Treasures Exhibition, Her Majesty will proceed to the Patricroft station. The two State barges, belonging to the Earl of EUeemere, have been redecorated to convey the Royal party. That for the vse of the Queen and immediate members of the Royal family is a beautiful craft, not unlike the slim gaudy caiques of the Pasha that skim about the waters of the Golden Horn. It is luxuriously fitted up to accommodate 30 or 40 visitors. A larger one is sot apart for the suite in attendance, which can convey f Oor 80 vith ease. Both wiU be usedon Wed. nesday, when four horses wil tow them from Worsley-hall down to within 100 yards of the Exhibition in half an hour. No change has been made in the interior decorations of Worsley-hall on this occasion, and the apart. ments intended for the use of the Royal visitors are those which were occupied during the last Royal visit. AlU are furnishedl with the massive decorations and rich though unostentatious luxury which distinguishes this splendid residencea. Six of the Royal carriages, 30 horses, and about 40 subordinate servants arrived at the hall on Saturday. The Royal guests and suite in attendance who remain at Worsley wlU number about 25. Her lMesya visit to the Art Treasures to-morrow (Tuesday) is an affair of State and ceremonial. During this visit, of course, Her Majesty will see little of the noble collection in the interior, as she will arrive at the tuilding at 11, and, according to present arrangements, is expected to leave it soon after 1. During this inaugural visit three addresses will be presented-one from the executive committee of the Exhibition, one from the Mayor and Corporation of Manchester, and one from the MZayor and Town-council of Salford. None of them are of the intermi. nable regal dimensions which usually mar the effect of such ceremonials-indeed we believe the latter is so sententious in referring to the approaching union of their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Prussia and the Princes Royal as to designate the illustrious couple as " the parties." According to the official programume, Her Majesty will reply to each address, and the routine of the visit on this day will be as follows:- THE ROYAL PROGRESS TO THE BUILDING. Her Majesty, accompanied by his Royal Highness the Prince Consort, his Royal Higbness the Prince of Wales, her Royal Highness the Princess Royal, his Royal Highness the.Prince Alfred, herRoyal Highness thePrincessAlice, and his Royal Highness PrinceFrederick William of Prussia, will leave Worsley Hall, the seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Ellesmere, at 9 o'clock, a.m., in the Royal carriages, in the following order:- First Carriage-Containing Mr. Gibbs, Tator to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales; Lieutenant Cowell, Tator to his Royal Highness Prince Alfred.

Sixth Carriage-Her Majesty the Queen, his Royal High. ness Prince Albert, his Royal Highness Prince Frederick William of Prussia, and her Royal Highnegs the Princess RoyaL The prooession will leave Worsley Hal about 9 oclock, escorted by the Lancashire Yeomanry, preceded by the pri vats carriages of the Right Hon. the Earl of Ellesmera; the Right Hon. the Earl of Burlington, Lord-Lieu tenant of the County; and Charles Towneley, REq., High Sheriff of the County of Lancaster; and will prooeed at a rapid rate through Worsley, Swinton, Irlams-o'-th'-Hight, Pendleton, and Salford. At Cross-lane the Right Hon. the Lord Overstone, President of the General Council of the Exhibition, and Lieutenant-General Sir H. Smith, G.C.B., commanding the Midland diatriet, and hi Staff, will meet the Royal cort6ge, which will be conducted thence to the Exhibition building by a squadron of the 4th Dragoon GuardAr commanded by Colonel Hodge, C.B. The cor&ge will enter the City of Manclhter bsy the Albert-bridge, where his worship the Mayor of Mancheder (Mr. James Watts) and the town cle* will mett the prooession, which will be led by the Regirueat ef the 4th Dragoon Guards, and will move at a walling pace through the city by the following route :-Bridge-street, John Dal. ton-street, Cross-street, St. Ann-street, St. Anlus-square. Market-street, Piccadilly, Portland-sbreet, Oxford-road, Cavendish-street, Stretfoid-road, to the Exhibition b-ild. ing.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FROMx OUn OWN OORRESPONDENT.) [The following appead In our second editlon of yes. PARIS, SUNDAY, JUNm 28, 6 P.M. The Ministerial papers, the Con.stituttionnel and the Pays, publish, by command, no doubt, an article expressing the moat magnificent wrath at the re. marks you have made on the late elections in this country. These interesting twins of the Government press are under one direction, they are inspired by the same breath, they derive their existence from the same source, and they perform the same tune with the least possible variation on the subject given to them. Like the Juftaks of the Persian poet, they always move in couples- Like those sweet birds that fly together, "With feather always touching feather, " Linked by a hook and eye." The Constitutionnel and Pays are indignant that it should for a moment be supposed that France does not enjoy the most complete liberty of writing, speaking, and voting; and from the summit on which they are placed they affect to look down with pity, and perhaps with scorn, on the inferiority of other countries in all the3s respects. France, as she Is nuow ruled, is, according to them, the model of a free and delighted nation, and anybody who says the contrary is only moved by a narrow and rancorous jealousy. Thatthe existing rgine is the one best suited to the character and temper of France is an opinion entertained by many intelligent, experienced men; and the way in which she has so often abused her advantages, and the rapidity with which she has passed from rational liberty to the wildest excesses, go far to strengthen that opinion. France has not the judgment to appreciate, nor the capacity to enjoy, such liberty; and, from the experience of the past, one is forcibly led to the conclusion that a mild but firm despotism is that which secures to her material tranquility and prosperity. But it requires an extraordinary power of audacity to maintain that complete liberty prevaili in the elections in the departments. If it he alleged that the masses in the rural districts do not care for that liberty, and that they would prefer the authorities taking entirely off their hands the trouble of naming deputies, it is possible one is right; but to say that the electors are left to their own free and unrestricted choice is a statement as audacious as it is untrue. With the circulars of the Minister of the Interior, the Prefect of the Seine, the Prefects and Sub-Prefects in the departments; with the complaint of the provincial press at silence being imposed on them; with the "w arning" given to the ,Sied,e the other day, merely because it made remarks on the principles of 1789 in relation to the Government candidates and those of the Opposition; with the fact that an independent journal exposes itself to suspension or suppression if it says a word distasteful to any "Jack in office " and that these .same journals, which eXpreSS indignation at being supposed to be held in thrall, dare not for their lives publish, on this or anyothersubject, a single paragraph without permission from the authorities ;- with all this known and avowed, it reguires more than ordinary hardihood to maintain that liberty of speech and writing prevails during the elections, that the electors were left to their own free and unbiassed will, and that the candidates whom the Government take under its protection are independent men. In this general system of coercion on the part of the "Administration" the most disgraceful act, perhaps, is the exclusion of ML de Montalembert from the new Chamber, every sort of machinery having been put in motion in the department of the Doubs against him. A Deputy-ChamberLlan, M. Conegliano, whose name has hardly ever been heard beyond the precincts of the ante-chamber, is preferred to such a man as M. de Montalembert. Will it be said that the district which M. de Montalembert had represented so long exercised an unblassed will in such a choice? The vacancycreated in the department of the Nord, and to which M. Collet-Meygret is appointed Prefect, is one of the consequences of the elections. The present Prefect is removed because the pressure he exercised against M. Bratn, the Opposition candidate, turned out useless, as M. Braun was returned. The Prefect has faUen into disgrace, not because he exercised pressure, but because he could not bind the stubborn Flemings of Lille to vote for the Government nominee. The Nord is not Democratic nor Socialist, yet Lille refused to vote at the beck of the " Administration." M. Gustave de Ramond, the Opposition candidate in the department of the Vienne, has, I hear, presented a strong protest to the President of the Commission du Recensement against the Prefect for alleged excesses and abuse of his authority, his refusal to allow the local papers to publish his reply, and the arrest of the persons who were employed in distributing his voting tickets. The truth is, the unfortunate Prefects knew that their own fate dependedl on the success of the Government nominees. If these failed, they were sure to be disgraced, and, with such a prospect before them, we may be sure that they have not been over-scrupulous in their choice of means. A private letter from Bologna, of the 22d, gives some details about the proceedings of the Pope in that city. All chance of the reforms in the governinent, so long demanded, seems to be vanishing. It had been confidently expected that the 16th, the anniversary of his nomination by the Conclave, and the 21st, that of his enthroning, would not be allowed to pass without being marked by some act of grace from His Holiness. They have passed, however, and Pius IX. has made no sign. M. Mingetti, who was one of his MIinisters dtiring the lay administration of 1848, had au audience of the Pope on the 20th, which lasted nearlyan hour. He laid before the Pontiff the condition of the people, the necessity of introdec- ing improvements in the Administration, and the danger of delay. The Pope, who had received M. Mingetti with much kindness, and who listened to him with patience, replied that the experience of 1848 was too recent, too strongly stamped on his memory, for him to renew the experiment without the greatest hesitation. He made some other remnaiks on the state of Italy, but he said nothing that wotuld indicate any determination in favour of reform, and it is now thought that, so far as this is concerned, His Holiness will return to Poome as he set out. The employ&s of the public oflices had a memorial presented to the Pope, praying for an augmentation of salary. The Pope expressed his regret that the State of the Pontifical Treasury did not allow of his complying with their request; he yet expected them to continue the same zeal as heretofore in the public service, to do their best for the credit of the Pontifical Government, and lie amsured them that they should not be forgotten when circumstances became more favourable. The reception of His Hloliness by the Bolognese is respectful, but by no means enthusiastic, in spite of the affability and kindness of his manner. The charges preferred against the three Italians, two of them from Faenza, and the other described as a Lombard, recently arrested, are very serious. They are said to have come to Paris on pretty much the same sort of mission as Pianori. Pistols, poniards, revolvers-in fact, a small arsenal of weapons-have been found and identified as belonging to them. They wil be tried by the Court of Assizes for conspiracy to assassinate the Emperor. The Monieu,r de la Flotte announces that a new screw steamn transport, calledLa Sevre, to be attached to the Imperial Navy, has just been launched at Nantes. This is the last of eight ships of the same description which have been completed, of which two were only placed on the stocks at Nantes two years since. They can carry 900 tons of war materials, and are of 120-horse power. The other six were commenced last year-two at Rochefort in May last, two at L'Orient the same month, and two at Brest about the same time. They are built of wood, and are of 1,200 tons and 250-horse power. There are likewise 18 other steam transports, of which 13 are ready for sea. Of these 13 transports two were constructed at Bordeaux, three at L'Orient, two at Rochefort, two at Brest, two at Cherbourg, and two at Nantes. NWhen all are completed the French Imperial Navy will possess 26 screw steam transports, which will enable the Minister of Marine to realize an idea which was frequently suggested by the most distinguished French Admirals. Durinog the war with Russia Admirals Parseval-Desehenes, Hamelin, and Bruat, while submitting to imperious necessity, frequently demonstrated the inconvenience of transporting troops and military stores in ships of the line, frigates, and corvettes built for fighting. The opinions of these eminent men have been attended to, and a number of screw steam transportis have been built, which henceforth, with the sailing transports possessed by the Imperial navy, will suffice to provide for aU contingencies. The Moniteur adds,- ' In future ships of war are never to bo diverted from the naval service, which is their sole attribute-an attribute necessary for the glory and greatness of France. Oar sea. men, whose admirable qualities are well known, being oocupied solely in studying maancuvres and gannery, will ac. quire all the instruction of which they are capable, and we sball possess at all times crews as remarkable for their knowledge as their courage. We may add that disciplne, without which there are neither armies nor fleets, wil gaina enormously. It is thus that our navy, profiting by past experience, is perseveringly progressing in the road of improvement and perfection." The Mniteur de lZa Flotte publishes a letter dated Santa Martha, which announces that the yeUow fever having shown itself on board the British fleet cruising before Greytown, the Admiral had found it necessary to enter the port of Carthagena, with the foUlowing steamships :-Orion, 94 guns; Intrepid, 50 guns; Cossack, 20 guns; BasilUk, 6 guns. The Admiral had requested the director of the vast and fine naval hospital at Carthagena to grant him 200 beds for the use of his sick. M. de Morny, who has arrived in Paris, has received an order by telegraph from the Emperor to proceed forthwith to Plombibres. The Governor of Java has received a copy of a very curious documsnt, being a proclamation published by the Emperor of Japan, and addressed to al the maritime Powers, makingknown to themthat he Is ready to enter into treaties of commeree with them similar to those which he executed with Great Britain, France, the United States, and Holand. This authentio document has been translated from the Japanese language into Dutch and French, and communicated to the European agents residing in the ports of China. I am informed that among the articles on which the duty has been considerably reduced on importation into Russia are mentioned " artidcs de Paris." PRUSSIA. (FROM OIJB OWN COBll]SPOND.r .) BERLIN, JuN 27. We have arrived at a period of the year not particularized by any almanac, but clearly to be traced by the contents of the German newspapers- viz., the period of reports, on dits, fabricated news,, bold combinations, and impudent assumptions; so that, although, properly speaking, there is notbing to report, there is still a considerable amount of occupation for ajournalistic Diogenes intracing how little there is true in every different statement that comes forward in the full impudence of black and white. The Danish answer to the lsst German despatches, which a fortnight ago was telegraphed aU over the world as having left Copenhagen for here andVienna, has not arrived yet; and, if we may believe certain information that reaches us, it has not yet been formally agreed upon by the State Privy Council. Further, the King of Prussia is not going to have a meeting with the Emperor of Austria at T6plitz; his stay at Marienbad will be curtailed by a week, but this appears to have been brought about by an alteration in the movements of the EmpressDowager of Ruissia, who will arrive her on July 13th. Furthermore, Baron Manteuffel is not going to have a meeting with Count Buol in the early part of July at Toplitz, nor at Marienbad, nor anywhere else, but will return hither on the 10th of next month from his seat in the Nieder Lausitz. Since I first announced to you the Emperor of Russia's intention to accompany his Empress to Darmstadt and Kissingen, and, on his way back to his own dominions, to make a short stay here at Sans-Souci, where his mother will by that time be staying, there have been almost weekly ehanges of travelling arrangements-more than it became possible to follow up, or necessary to note. At length we have definite information that he and the Empress left St. Petersburg on the 23d inst. for Kie, where he probably will arrive to-day, and, after a very short stay there, will come on to :Eamburg, where great preparations are being made to receive him. Although the Emperor will travel incognito (but whether as a Count Borodinski or a Count Romanoff appears not quite certain), it is understood that the ling of Denmark intends that the Hereditary Prince Ferdinand shall receive him on his landing at Kiel, and greet him as the head of the Oldenburg family. Prince Christian of Denmark, it was said, would avail himself of the same opportunity to pay his respects. M. de Morny arrived here last Wednesday, on his return from St. Petersburg, rid Stettin, accompanied by his young Countess, and, after a rest of a day or two, proceeded on his way to Paris. The Marquise de Moustier, the wife of the French Minister here, left this place also for Paris on Thursday, and will probably make a lengthened stay there. It appears far from improbable that the Marquis himself will be selected by the Emperor Louis Napoleon to succeed Count de Morny at St. Petersburg, although the hopes expressed in the Russian capital at the recent leave-taking were that M. de Mormy himself would soon return. The Prussian Minister at the Court of Vienna, Count Arnim, has at length decided finally on relinquishing the diplomatic service, in consequence of his bad health. It is not at present known, even approximately, who will be his successor. For some time past there has been a talk of AT. de Schleinitz, formerly Minister for Foreign Affairs here, returning to public life and accepting some first-rate foreign appointment ; the reverse of this, however, is true, for it is the intention of this statesman to retire entirely into private life. Had it not been so, it is more than probable that Count Bernstorff would have returned to his former post at Vienna, and M. de Schleinitz would have gone in his place to London. The last session of the Prussian Diet having failed to bring the difficult question of a reform of the Divorce Law to a settlement, and the disquiet in the Church continuing to be great on the point of whether divorced persons shall be admissible or not to remarriage, the Ober-Kirchenrath, or Supreme Consistory, has, on the authority of a Cabinett Order, issued a provisional intimation to the clergy of the Evangelical Church of Prussia that all such applications coming for the future before them, in which persons who have been already divorced desire to enter again into the holy bonds, are to be brought at once before the Provincial Consistory for decision, and, in case of appeal, before the Ober-Kirchenrath itself; either of these two bodies will then decide upon the special case, after taking due cognizance of its merits, and thus tbe individual clergy will be relieved from all further pressure either from their conscience -within or the importunities of the candidates for matrimony without. To-morrow the Kinot will inaugurate a building he has purchased at karienbad to be devoted in future to Protestant divine worship. As it Is not allowable in the Austrian dominions for fresh Protestant congregations or communities to be formed, the only means of securing to Protestants not resident in a recognized community the means of commonworship is forsome Protestantnobleman or other to purchase a house and fit it up for the Divine service of his co-religionists, while the tenement itself remains officially a private house, the property of a private individual. This the King of Prussia has just done at Marienbad, as well as on former occa- sions at many other places of Catholic Germany, and the King of Hanover has done so at Eissingen. Another of those acts of intolerance, accompanied with violence and injury to the personal freedom of the person persecuted, has just taken place in Bohemia again. A missionary to the Jews, named Pick, resident in Breslau, was lately detected inBohemiainthe act of distributing Protestant Bibles in German; he was taken to Seuftenberg, and condemned to five days' imprisonment there. He, however, escaped from his gaol, and returned to Breslau. Very recently, on the oeasion of a visit to Dresden, it came out in the course of an examination by the local police that he was under sentence of punishment from the Austrian authorities in Bohemia; he wvas accordingly handed over to the latter, carried to Seuftenberg, and im- prisoned there for five days. At the expiration of this time, however, he was not set at liberty, but turned over to the tender mercies of the Holy Brothers at Prague, who seem to consider any bodily exercise beyond the waUs of their own abode incompatible with the discipline they deem it their duty to enforce on his heretical soul. This missionary, who has of late taken an active part in the religious polemies of the day, is, unfortunately, though of late living in Breslau, an Austrian subject, and it is therefore impossible for any diplomatic demands to be made in his favour.

MOVY-MARKETand CITYZKTBLLIrG7N CV. a Monday Evenlng.| Although the details from India this morning tended in some degree to mitigate the anxiety awakened by the telegraphic despatches on Saturday, the funds have again been very dull, and have closed at a further decline of an eighth. Consols for the 9th of July were first quoted 92i to j ex dividend, and the final quotations were at 92g to 4. A pressure for money, caused by several sales of stock for delivery, as weU as by the arrangements for the foreign and share settlement at the end o the month, was a principal cause of the increased heaviness; but another faU on the Paris Bourse also contributed to it. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92g to j; New Three per Cents., 924 to i ; Exchequer Bonds, 98i to j; and India Bonds, 8s. to 4s. discount. In the Exchequer-billmarket the low prices have atracted a few buyers, and the quotation was 7s. to 3s. discount. There was an active demand in the discount-market, but the supply was adequate, and the applications at the Bank are believed not to have been heavy. Foreign securities were without material variation. The transactions comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 100 ; Chilian Six per Cents., 102; Portuguese Three per Cents., 47; Russian Five per Cents., 1l0 i; Sardinian, 891; Spanish, 41; and 42; Spanish Passive, 64; Turkish Six per Cents., 96k, 95-1, and 96 for money, and 961 and i for the account; Turkish Guaranteed Four per Cents., 102 and 1011 ; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65k; and Four per Cents., 98. The corn-market was very dull this morning, and the rates of Monday last could not have been obtained for any large quantity. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 60c. for money and 67f. 65c. for the present account, showing a further fall of three-eighths per cent. It is understood that most of the East Indian authorities concur in the impression that the accounts to-day are less unfavourable than might have been feared. The fact that there has not been any panic in the stock-markets, either at Calcutta or Bombay, is the most satisfactory that could have been presented under the circumstances. It Is calculated that General Anson, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal army, would be with the troops before D)elhi on the 26th of May (the massacre having occurred about the 12th), and meanwhile information has arrived that the wise precaution had been taken at Lahore of disarming the sepoy regimentQ, although they were still allowed to do duty with side arms, and to retain their uniform and colours. The resolution of the India directors to order all officers on furlough to return to their regiments has been accompanied by a requisition to the Htome Government for four regiments of the line. These will be despatched immediately, and others will folow if the news by the next mail should render it desirable. They are expected to be sent in large screw steamers viU the Cape, for which the necesEary contracts will be immediately made. The overland route is, of course, wholly impracticable for such an emergency. The consent of the Viceroy of Egypt would be necessary, and even if this could be procured without delay the total absence of transports on the Red Sea side would constitute an insuperable diffaculty. With regard to the question of the effect likely to be produced on our money-market by the disturbances in India it must be borne in mind that the whole expenses of military movements in that country faU upon the local, andnot upon the Homs Government. Indeed, the existing demand for troops will actually lessen the charges upon our people, since the cost of all the regiments that may be sent away will at once be transferred from the English to the Indian estimates. It may be said, perhaps, that as the Indian Government wiU be compelled to contract new loans the drain must ultimately faU upon us. But this does not follow. The loans will be contracted in India, and they may serve to bring out some of the hoards of the native population. Hence; it is possible that, instead of our experiencing any increased pressure from the present turn of events, we may find the drain of silver lightened, owing to its being necessary for the Indian Government to pay for materiel from this side. It appears from the vague accounts from DeThi that the insurgents have sacked the Delhi Bank and obtained l50,0001. in specie. Most likely, however, a portion of this sum was plundered from the Public Treasury. The Delhi Bank is a respectable jointstock establishment, which was foumded about 14 years ago with a paid-up capital of 180,0001. It hai agencies in London,. Calcutta, Bombay, Miadras, and Cawnpore. Its manager was MIr. George Beresford, and the deputy manager and accountant were also Europeans. It is assumed that whatever specie loss the bank may have sustained will be regarded as a claim upon the Government. The inference that the telegraphic quotation on Saturday of the Calcutta exchange would prove to be erroneous has been confirmed. Instead of 2s. 01d. it should have been 2s. lid. to id., which is exactly the same as the rate by the previous mail. The Bombay rate is also without alteration, and the shipments of silver to India will therefore neither be retarded nor accelerated by the present arrival. Meanwhile the Chinese exchanges are decidedly less unfavourable; and, aS the most pressing demand has recently been for that region, the market on this side must experience some slight relief. The commercial letters from Tndia describe considerable animation in the prices of Government securities at Calcutta, while at Bombay a sudden ranewal of pressure inthe money-market is attributed not to any alarm on account of the insurrection, but to a desire on the part of cap,talists to subscribe to the 5 per cent. loan,' which was expected shortly to be closed. From China it is mentioned that large arrivals of silver by the last two packets had begun to produce an effect, and that the quotations of exchange were expecteI to go lower, especially as the merchants were no q holding off from silk purchases until the fate of the European crop should be known. The fact that opium was selling at improved rates at Shanghai was likewise calculated to lessen the demand for silver. At Foo-chow-foo great aiety prevailed from the advance of the rebels, and some of the foreign. merchants had shipped their treasure on board the vessels of war in the harbour. It is mentioned that Mexican dollars were becoming more in favour at that port as compared with the pillar dolar, and were selling at 4 discount, the Custom-house receiv ing them for dues at 2 discount. In the tea-market excitement continues. The additional China news to-day has been considered to warrant a rise in prices, and a large quaiitity of common Oongou has been sold at Is. 2id. to ls. 2id. per lb. The bar silver brought by the last West India steamer has been sold at 6l1d. per ounce, showing a decline of id. from tho price obtained for that by. the last packet, although for some time past this has been the quotation. The dollars have been disposed of at the former rate of 61d. per ounce. The shipments of silver to India and China by the steamer of the 4th are expected to range between 700,0001. and 81)0,000/. The return of officers to India will probably tax the resources of the Peninsular and Oriental steam'r of the 4th of July, but the demand for berths conld not have happened at a better period of supply, since the July vessels usually carry out only about a fourth of the ordinary number of passengers, the heat in the Red Sea deterring all persons from voluntarily taking a passage at this season. The sp;cie by the America to-day is 247,5001.,an unusually large amount, considering that the port of departure was Boston. A portion of this will probably be taken to the Bank. The commercial advices describe no important change. The stockmarket had not recovered from the severe depression reported by the previous mail. Erie Railway was quoted 33; Panama 93- Reading, 75i; NewYork Central, 831; and ilinois Central, 33 to 35 pm.; the bonds, 97. The accounts regarding the prospects of the harvest are scanty. A defalcation had been discovered in the Treasury of the State of Ohio of 310,0001., but the July dividend on the State Stock would be punctually paid. Accordcng to advices from M. Aries Dufour, of Lyons, the silk crop thus far seems to have realized the anticipations expressed in his former letters. The prices of cocoons are extraordinarily high as compared with those of last year, but consumption having been largely reduced, and the European crop being better than on that occasion. it is contended there is nothing to justify an extravagant rise, although it may possibly continue. "We never saw," it is remarked, " at the approach of a new crop such a considerable stock of Asiatic silk. At the same time the stocks of European are larger than in 1856, and with an enormous difference in prices." In Hamburg the rate of discount has risen to 7% per cent; The provincial trade reports for the past week indicate generally a steady business, the recent redution in the Bank rate of discount having created confidence. At Manchester the market has been firm, owing to the contraction of stocks, but it scarcely keeps pace with the prices of cotton. The Birmingham advices show that the existing rates for iron are likely to be maintained throughout the coming quarter. As regards the general manufactures of the town there has been a dull home demand, but a good supply of continental orders. At Nottinghama there has been an improvement in the lace trade, but nOne in hosiery. the woollen districtbs the transactionshave icreased, and confidence revals, although the stocks in hand are rather full. In theIrish linen-markets likewise there has been a little more activity. In the general business of the port of London during the past week there has not been much activity. The number of vessels reported inward was 153, being 45 less than in the previous week. The number cleared outwards was 132, including 27 in ballast, showing a decrease of 6. At a meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Gotch, the bankers, of Kettering, who failed on the 9th inst. it has been resolved that the estate shall be wound up under inspection. It is stated that by this course at least 10s. in the pound will be realized. The failure appears to have arisen from advances having been made without adequate security. Accordiig to accounts submitted by Messrs. Harding and Pullein, the accountants, the a3sets are 82,0031. against liabilities for 132,0261. At a meeting to-day of Westminster Improveinent bondholders, Mr. Beaumont in the chair, on .a requisition of the committee appointed in April last, resolutions were adopted, authorizing the commiittee to oppose the Westminster Improvements Bill No. 3, now before the House of ComamonsX and recommending a general subscripton among the bondholders at the rate of 2s. per cent, on the amount of their bonds to constitte a fund for payment of the expenses. At the meeting of the North British Australasian Company to-day the report of the committee of investigation was received and adopted. The directors entered into explanations, and a committee of management was chosen for the ensuing year, consisting of two of the old directors and four other shareholders, of whom three were members of the committee of investigation. Messrs. John Taylor and Sons intimated their intention to retire.
STATE OP TRADE. iCtANCESTEBR, JUNE 29. The market, usually held on Tuesdays, was held to-day, in consequence of the Queen's visit and the general holyday fixed for to-morrow. There was quite as good an attend. ance on the Exchange as might have been expected had it been the regular market day. In the yarn-market spinners were exceedingly firm, owing to the higher price of cotton, which tends to givo increaed confidexce, but there was very little business transacted. The descriptions of T-cloths and longcloths recently most in demand are now somewhat scarce in stock, and the decreased supply, through the short-time movement, enables producers to hold with great firmness for better prices, but there is even more hesitation among buyers in this than in the yarn-market in following the upward tendency of prices.' Although the production of shlrtings i3 still large, sufficient sales are effected to give steadiness and firmness to the market. On the whole, the market for cloths, as well as for yarns, is firm, though quiet, and a good feeling prevails.
Th LATE EXPEDITION U-P THE NnE.-Our readers are aware that last year Mehemet Said, Viceroy of Egypt, organized an expedition of scientific men to explore the Nile, and, if possible, to ascertain the existence of an immense lake said to exist in the interior, and which is supposed to be the real source of the great Egyptian river. The Preose has now published a succinct account of this expedition, borrowed from the private journal of Dr. Pouchet, one of its members. Through the instrumentality of hM de Lesseps, the expedition, patronized by the Academy of SCiences at Paris, and several other learned societies of France, England, and Germany, and favoured with special instructions from M. A. de Humboldt, was ready for its departure about the beginning of October last. It consisted of MM. Aubaret, a lieutenant of the French navy; Meyer, a German mineralogist; Dr. Richard, a botanist; Geng and Bolealawski officers of the Austrian corps of engineers; Georges Pouchet, a zoologist; Twyford, an English captain; Clague, a photographer; De Bar, a draughtsman; and Tabouelle, secretary to the expedition, all under the orders of hi. Escayrac de Lauture, an African traveller of some note. An immense quantity of provisions and articles of every description necessary for the journey had been prepared, including, among other things, a distilling apparatus, two field-guns, an apparatus for electric light, and even a sawing machine. The Viceroy placed 500 camels and a large military force at the disposal of the chief of the expedition, a circumstance which induced him to conceive a higher opinion of himself and the authority entrusted to him than was, perhaps, quite in accordance with the interests of the expedition. It appears, indeed, that at the very outset his imperious conduct and the military organiza. tion which he attempted to impese upon the members of the expedition led to disagreeable scenes and to unnecessary delay. Meanwhile the vanguard of thescientific expedition, consisting of Captain Twyford, hL Pouchet, and XI. Clagne, set out from the port of Boulac on the 20th of October, in order to proceed by the Nile to Kartoum, where they were to be met by the main body, which was to cross the desert. The description given of the passing of the first cataract is interesting. The word " cataract"1 appears, indeed, to be misapplied to the rapids which impede the navigation of the Nile, they being nothinf in fact but a labyrinth of islands and rocks betwveen which the waters rush with more or less violence. There are special pilots caled re*, trained to that calling from father to son, who are entrusted with the guidance, or rather the rescue, of the frail barks that are to perform the dangerous feat. When the boat reaches a certain place where the width of the water is not more than about 20 feet, about 200 Nubians, under the command of the chief of the cataract, tow the vessel up the shallow stream, and at the most difficult point a dozen of the stoutest jump into the river, and actually lift the boat out of the stream over the bar which impedes the passage; beyond it the water is deep, and the lateen sail may again be unfurled. The success of this operation is greeted by the applause of the numerous spectators assembled on the banks to witness it. A quarter of an hour after this dramatic sceno the little flotilla of the expedition lay quietly at anchor in the port of El Mahatta, an important Nubian viUage. Thence Captain Twyford and his companions proceeded to Dongolah, and, unconscious of the squabble for authority still raging at Cairo between M. Escayrac and the other members of the expedition, arrived at Amboukoul, having exhausted their money and provisions. Here they fortunately met the Viceroy and his suite returning from his journey through the provinces of Soudan; and from him they learnt that, owing to the impossibility of establishing harmony between the chief and the members of the expedition, it had been dissolved. Nothing therefore remained to be done but to return to Dongolah amid great hardships, owing to the ill. will of the authkorities, who thought they had fallen into disgrace; and these difficulties did not cease until they reached Rhoda, a place 20 leagues from Cairo, where they were received by a Government steamer. The results of their journey in a sientific point of viewr are very meaore consisting only of confirmations of fact already published by previous travellers.

IN! ~ ~~~~~~~~iich had been heusry into the case of adbesengaged as a mes~ oLive supporter of the sittin" h d performed no services he had ieceived. A puablican ed that Stamford had said in his house X;aXno v ote unless Lawrence put him on, as he x-snd to lose his day s work for niothing. A baker m atthew Brown also proved that Stamford had said he would be d-d if he would vote without money; that he wanted money, and that he would get his old friend Teddy Lawrence to put him on. Mr. COLERIDGE submitted that this vote ought to be struck out, inasmuch as it had been given, like the vote which the committee had struck out on Saturday, with a corrupt intention. Mr. SLADE drew a distinction between this case and the one decided on Saturday, and contended that the decision of the committee in that case, if carried any further, would lead to most dangerous results. It was very difficult to interpret the word " bribery," but if that decision were generally aoted on no member's seat would be safe. It was a decision which had astonished every lawyer. (Mr. Power denied this assertion on the part of the profession.] With regard to Stamford there could be little doubt that he had made the boasting statements which had been proved, but they ought to be treated as mere " cbaff," as he had done ample work for the money paid him. The voter Stamford stated, upon examination, that he had promised his vote to Macaulay and Steuart three or four aays before the election; that he had worked on the day of election in taking voters to the poll, and fetching cabs for them; and that in the intervals between his work he had gone into Smith's house, where a great deal of " chaff" was always going on. He did not recollect having used the expressions attributed to him with regard to not voting without money. He admitted that he had received 101. for Aoting for Macaulay and Steuart in 1552, and said he had ilwavs supported the Conservative party. The committee struck out the vote, on the ground that the voter had received money for which he had rendered no adequate service. The CILtURMAN, in reference to Mr. Slade's observation with regard to the decision of Saturday, said he was perfectly willing to reconsider it m order to satisfy his learned fiend, although nothing he had since beard or read had caused hima to entertain any doubtt as to its correctness. Mr. i;. JAsE, said the profession, as far as he could judge,wserfectly satisfied with the decision. enext case taken was that of ill, the younger, who had received Gs. for traveUing expenses from Saffron Walden to Cambridge, when, in fact, it was stated, he had been taken there in a dogeart at no expense. Mill, however, on being examined, said that he travelled by omnibus and railway into Cambridge, and that he had spent more than 6s. in getting there. He aduiitted that he had not returned to Saffron Walden the same night. Mr. SLADE submitted that as YMill had voted before he had thought of asking for money his vote must atand. Ile could not be said to have received any money on account of his vote, even supposing that he had received a couple of shillings more than be was entitled to in consequence of his not returning to Saffron Walden the same night. Mr. E. J&nrEs, on the other side, said that the committee were to consider, not whether the case was one of hardship against the sitting member, but whether the case was one of those against which the Act was intended to provide. If the sitting member chose to pay these charges, notwithstanding the warning he had received, he must take the risk of his determination. The question was one of principle, and the smallness of the amount paid to the voter had nothing to do with it, for a man might be corrupted by a pot of beer as well as by a large bribe. The case of Mill was not concluded at 4 o'clock, but The CirAl& AxE , before the adjournment of the committee, said that, although he was perfectly satisfied with the udgment given by the committee on Saturday, he should have no objection to allow the whole case to be reorned if Mr. Slade thought it would be desirable to take t at course, and he should have no hesitation in reversing his decision if he were satisfied that it ought to be reversed. The committee then adjourned. ROCHDALE. The committee re-assembled this morning. The learned counsel present during the day were Mr. Monk, Mr. Vaughan. and Mr. Power, for the petitioners; and W. Phina and Mr. Clarke for the sitting member. A witness named John Holt, who was examined on Saturday, was recalled at his own request, and corrected a portion of the evidence which he gave on cross-examination that day. Edmund Lord, a miller and bellringer at the parish church, Rochdale, stated that on the day before the polling (Sunday) Thomas Bamford induced him to go to Bury to ring, Bamford and others accompanying him. He got drunk, and next morning he found himself at Liverpool. He remained there, drinldng at different houses during the day, and when he returned to Rochdale the poll was closed. William Kershaw, weaver, Bury, stated that he met Lord, Bamford, and the othors at Bury on the Sunday evening. He went with theni to the W'hite Lion Inn. The witness was about to give evidence of something which passed between Bamford and himself when Mr Phinn objected that this was not a case of bribery and therefore before evidence of this nature could be heard there must be proof of agency. The point having been argued, the committee decided that the objection was well founded, and the examination of the witness was abandoned. James Sharp, the landlord of the Golden Bull, Scotland. road, Rochdale, stated that a day or two before the eleotion Ir. John Pilling and Mr. John Lee canvassed him to vote for Sir A. Ramsay. He refused to do so; but at his request Mr. Pilling paid for a glass of rum for him. In cross-examination he said that when he asked for the rum he did not want a bribe. Robert Cooper, a warehouseman at Rochdale, was called by Mr. Vaughan, and was being examined as to a conversation with a voter named George Parkinson when -Mr. CLARIE objected to the reception of hearsay evi. dence; and the committee, after argument by counsel and consultation, decided that such evidence should not be received. In consequence of this and the previous decision of the committee the learned counsel for the petitioners desisted from offering evidence of acts of bribery and proceeded to the proof of agency. For that purpose Mr. Thomas Livesey was recalled. He was examined at some length, and his evidence showed that Rtichard Mills canvassed and brought voters to the poll for Sir A. Ramsay, and that on the day of nomination and of the declaration of the pol he was upon the hustings acting as fugleman for that gentleman and his friends. Thomas Buckley, clerk to the clerk of the magistrates at Rochdale, proved that soon after the election two men, named Lee and Ray, were convicted upon an assault un Mr. Livesey on the day of nomination. They were fined 20s each, and these fines and the costs wero paia by Richard William Bake, a man who was present at the payment of these fines, stated that Mills went away to get the money, and before doing so said he could get it at the Woolpack [Sir A. Ramsay's committee-room]. Abraham Hill, Jane Turner, Thomas Whitehead, and Edward Tootal were examined, and proved that they had aen Richard Mhlls, Thomas Henessey, the Brierleys,Buther. North, and several other persons who had been mentioned [g previous witnesses attending at the committee-room of cir A Ramsay, and taking voters to the poll which bore his FilaCardS. The committee then adjourned until 11 o'clock this snorning. WAREHAH. The committee yesterday proceeded with the scrutiny, Lned resolved that when a principle had been once established all the voters who came within it should be bound by it, In order to avoid a repetition of the same arguiments in every case. In pursuance of this arrangement a voter named Pike was struck off, leaving the petitioner in a majority of one. The vote of John Meaden in favour of the petitioner was then objecued to by the learned counsel for the sitting member on the ground that he had offered money to another voter, who had intended to vole for Mr. Calcraft, in order to induce him to absent himself; and William Bryden, the voter in question, stated, upon examination, that Meaden, on the eVening before the election, gave bini 51. to go to Portsmouth next day, and that he went to Portsmouth acoordingly before the openingof the poll. Anotber voter namzed Best was present, and took a part in the transac- After hearing arguments on either side as to the effeot of this evidence, The CO3iMItTE decided that the votes of Meaden and Best should not be allowed. The vote of one Bagg was then objected to by the learned counsel for the petitioner, on the ground that he had ordered some goods at the time of the election of another voter, in order unduly to influence his vote, but the vote was allowed by the commiittee. The vote of one Chiffln was then struck off on the ground that he had been receiving parish relief. The CoasnrrTrEEthen entered into a consideration of a question of boundary, which occupied it until its adjourn. meat. F PNTEFRACT. T'e evidence given before the committeeyesterdaywascon. fined chiefly to cases of alleged treating by the sitting member and hisagents. Sevcralvoterswere alsocalled toshowthatthey had been induced to vote for Mr. Wood by the advantages which it was expected were to be derived from the establish. ment of the carpet factory, which the petitioners alleged was a project got up solely for the purposes of the election ; but nothing of importance was elicited on this part of the case. The first witness called was Joseph Smith, who stated that he had been present at the annual dinner of the St. George's Lodge, Pontefract, on the first dlonday in October, 1856, at which Mr. Wood and several of liis principal sup- porters dined and were made honorary mem'bers of the odge. The price of the dinner-ticket included a glass of ale, and after dinner every personi usually ordered what he wanted,andpaid for it. On this occasion, however, there washplenty to drinkwithout pving. Witness had three glasses of brandy.andXwatr which he did not pay for, nor aid he see others pay for what they bad. Mr. Wood's health was drunk two or three timles-once as the future member. Richard Richardson was also present at the dinner, and had two or three glasses of brandy andwater after dinner without paying. In cross-examination these witnesses stated that it was not unusual for persons who were made honorary members tqotand glassesTround." Mr. Gulley, a former member, haa done so. The sitting members, too, for the time being, vere in the habit of contnbutiDg " spending money," perhaps to the amount of a couple of guineas, Which was drunk 'r.

One ofthemasked imtovoteforWood, and, aiterpromising, he was asked what he would take to drink. He had a glass of brandy-and-water, which one of the gentlemen paid for. The landlord was also caUled in and was canvassed, and asked what he would drink. He had a glass of gin. Witness was made a committee-man in his district, and used to attend the committee room. On one evening there was "a grand do." The table was covered with decanters of port and sherry, gingerette for the teetotaUers, cigars, biscoits, and butter. The usual business of the committee was goin' on, and those who came in helped themselves just as they liked. Nobody paid anKthing. he had seen wine on the committee room table in the moming. Witness did not vote till 10 minutes to 4 o'clock. Cross-examined by Mr. TEMPLE.- Why were you so late? What were you doing all day 9-Well, I was just looking about for what I could catch. (Laughter.):-To speak plainly waited to see if I could get any money. Did you catch anything?-No, I did not. 101. would have been very useful to me. I knew there was no money stirring, for two or three others had tried it on before me, and had not left a brick unturned. Mr. Oliveira never promised me anything. John Hartley, landlord of the Anchor Inn, stated that on the occasion referred to by the last witness he had been called into a private room in his own house, and canvassed for Mr. Wood in Mr. Wood's presence. He did not give any promise, and he was then asked what he would take to drin. He had a glass of gin, which one of the gentlemen paid for. In cross-examination the witness said that this gentleman was often in the habit of coming to his house and inviting him to take a glass. No other evidence of any importance was given. Mr. Sergeant PiGo statedmthat this was the close of the petitioners' case, with the exception of two witnesses who could not be in attendance until this (Tuesday) morn- iThe committee adiourned at half-past 2 until U to-day. In our report of the examination of Mr. Oliveira, in the sentence, ' I was told that Mr. WVood, tho sitting member, was paying high for votes," for " Mr. Wood, the sittin~ mcem,ber," read " Mr. Lewis, the opposition candidate. Mr. Wood had no connexion with the election of 1852. MAYO (COUNTY). At the sitting of the committee the examination of Mr. Griffin, the agent of Colonel Higgins, was resumed. He stated that after a voter named Fergus had promised his vote he had a conversation with him on the subject, when Fergus told him that his house had been surrounded by a mob, and he had been obliged to promise to vote for Moore, and could not therefore vote for Colonel Higgins. He expressed his regret at not being able to vote for Siggins, and he did vote for Moore. The witness then spoke to having seen Mr. Moore in company with Conway and other priests on the Wednesday after the close of the poll. An ass, he continued, was driven through the town with Higgins's name upon it. After voters had gone to the poll and given their votes for Moore Conway patted them on the back and expressed approbation. The priest acted as "tallymen" to Moore'svoters. The witness proceeded to mention the names of several voters who had promisedto vote for Colonel Higins, some of whom had not voted at all, while others bad voted for Moore, in consequence of the interference of the mob and of the priests. On cross-examination the witness said that this was the third election at which he had acted as Colonel Higgins's agent. Mr. Courtenay Kenny, the deputy.-sheriff, was not staying at Monaghan's Hotel. Witness did not attend the nomination, because be thought he was better away. Laughter.) Some of the voters who had been staying at Ionaghan's Hotel voted for Moore instead of Higgins. He never saw Higgins walking about Ballinrobe during the election without an escort. The Protestant clergymen were active supporters of Higgins, but they did not canvass for him, nor did they take voters to the poll. Conway had a vote. Witness thanked the voters who voted for Higgins, but he never patted them on the back. (Laughter.) James Moran, a freeholder of Mayo, said he was riding to Ballinrobe on the Sunday before the poulinA in order to vote for liggins. Three other supporters of iggins were with him, and they had an escort of about a dozen cavalry. On arriving withiin a mile and a-quarter of Ballinrobe, between 4 and 5 o'clock, they met a mob with Father Conway among them. Conway said there had been three or four men killed below the town. This frightened him, and e got down from the car and ran in the direction of home. Father Conway came up and asked his name before he got off the car, and then looked at a paper. He ran across the fields followed by some of the mob with stones in their hands who caught him, took him back into the road, put him into a car, and drove him to Cong with three other voters. Father Conway and the mob accompanied them to Cong, and locked them in a room in an hotel there. Father Conway and the mob came to them while they were locked up and said they must vote for Moore and Palmer. Witness said he would not; he would vote for his master. He w.as a tenant of Mr. Baker, one of Higgins's supporters. The mob said that unless he voted for Moore and Palmer he should pay for it. He was kept locked up till the break of day and tho mob then took him to WaDinrobe, where be arriveA on the Monday morning. By Colonel NORTHr.-They left the Dragoons behind them, near Ballinrobe. They got off the car before the Dragoons had time to interfere, direetly they caught sight of the mob. When they ran away the Dragoons went oa towards the town. There were three or four cars containing voters, under the care of the Dragoons. The other cars went on to Ballinrobe with the Dragoons. Examination continued.-The mob took them to Gilbert's Hotel, where Moore and Palmer had their committee rooms. In the afternoon Conway took witness and Michael Langdon to the polling place, but it was too late to vote. Conway asked him to go back to the hotel, but he refused, and Conway then sent him to his (Conway's) house in charge of the mob. He went there against his will. He and Langdon passed the night in Conway's kitchen. As they were taking =m to Conwa7's the mob said, "Unless you vote for Moore and Palmer, big and little will know you as you pass along the streets, and you will pay for it." He and Langdon went out of the house during Conway's absence and got their liberty. They went to the poll with an escort, and he voted for Moore and Higgins. He had intended to plump for Higgins, but he gave half a vote to Moore because he had promised the mob and Conway to do so. He should not have voted for Moore unless he had been frightened. He was a smaU farmer, well known in Ballinrobe, and he was now afraid of his life to go into the town. He had been beaten in the town since the election, and some people had been committed for the assault. The Speaker's warrant was taken from him when he was beaten. Cross-examined by Mr. AL. SmiT.-He was frightened very seon after what Conway told him about the men having been killed. Michael Langdon,also a smaU farmer and freeholder, who had accompanied the last witness, gave the same account of their encounter with the mob. He also had voted for Moore and Higgins in fear for his life, having intended to plump for Higgins. After they had voted Conway told the people not to touch them, for they were free to go where MrineM'Tighe, one of the same party of voters, stated the same facts as the last two witnesses, but added that he escaped from the house where he was locked up, at Cong, durinthe night and got home. He thou ghtthe people were g one another that night in Cong, such was the state of the town. On the Monday he went into Ballinrobe with a large escort and plumped for Hliggins. He was now afraid for his life to go into BallinrobE. Timothy Schehill, a man in the employment of Colonel HIiggins, proved that as he was con:veying roender for the horses of Colonel Higgins's voters into Ballinobo he met a mob, with Conway amongthem, who scattered the- hay and sitraw abouat the road. The mob, he said, then made him accompany them, and they met seie voter and some soldiers. Somae of the voters and the soldliers went into the town. He saw Father Conway swear some voters upon the Bible not to vote for Higgins. He would notnow -venture into Ballinroke without an escort for fear of beingkilled. On cross-examination the witness said that he did not see Mr. Burke, of Owre, on the day when he was attacked - that Father Conway was not on a car, but on horseback, and that the mob did not begin to scatter the hay and straw until Father Conway told them to do so. Thomaws Kilalea, another voter, stated that he hadlintended to vote for Higgins on the Monday, bat had been prevented from gettin" to the poll by the mob. On the Tuesday he went into BaYbinob but was taken to the poll by the mob and obliged to vote for Moore and Palmer, Francis Sullivan said that on Sunday the 5th of April he attended the chapel at Kilcommon, where the Rev. Michael Joyce was thepriest. During mass Joyce addressed the co3ngregation in Irish. He said that the people who had before supported Higgins ought to turn him out now, as thwe t have had enough of him, that he hoped th oey wo take care of themselvs and not betmpe to vote for Hligeis oreit be-e1te ori wo0uld be the worse for them, _a_nd thevywould -be' branded, and that they had a duty to perform to their country and to God. He also said it was the wish of Archbishop MHacale that they should not vote for Higgins. He referred to the family of Jennings, but not by name, saying that some of tLem had been d not long ago to roast their potatoes by any cabin fire, and to look for an egg in a potato, and he hoped that none of the voters would be influenced by that family. He saw Joyce at the election going about with Moore's voters. The mob at Ballinrobe took hold of him and put the "gutter" (i. c., mud) into his moutb. (Laughter.) He appealed to Joyce, who said, " I will make a beggar of your mother's son." Joyce told the mob that he was assisting "- that villain Higgins," and they then plastered him with mud from head to foot. He was not an elector, but he was then employed to collect the horses of Colonel Higgins's voters. On cross-examination the witness said that he got his living with his pen as a job clerk. Iloman Catholic priests frequently addressed the people from the steps of the altar, after the Communion and before the Gospel, upon general topics. Joyce knew that he was employed by Higgins a week before the election, and, although he lived next door to him, never spoke to him on the subject until he was met by the mob in the street at Ballinrobe. At the conclusion of this witness's examination the committee adjourned.

WBITS OF RBROR. HOUSE OF LORDS. JxE 29A. CROFT V. LXMLEY ' OTRS .bus m>orning ror re purpose ot hearing the arguments in this writ of error, brought from a decision of the Court of Exchequer Chamber affirming a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Brougham, Lord Wensleydale, and the learned judges we'e present The ATTORNEY.GENTERAL, Mr. H. HInn, and Mr. UN. THANK were heard on behalf of the plaintiff in error. Sir F. Kelly and Mr. hIaude represented the defendant in error Lumley, and Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. Serjeant WeUs appeared for the other defendants in error. It appeared from the arguments of the counsel on behalf of the plaintiff in error that the proceedings in this case had originated in an action of ejectment, brought by Faithful Oroft as the lessor, against Benjamin LumIley as the lessee of Her Majesty's Theatre, in the Elaymarket, in which the plaintiff sought to recover possession of that building on the alleged forfeiture by the defendant of his lease, by reason of alleged breaches of covenant on his part. The lease in question, dated the 10th of July, 1845, was granted by Mr. Croft to Mr. Lumley, and demised the Opera-house and other premises, p art for 66 years and the remainder for 21 yearsfrom its date. There were several covenants and clauees for re-entry, and the quesions beforethe Housewere, iirst, whether, under the circumstances, the lease had been forfeited, and, secondly, if forfeited, whether there had been a waver of that forfeiture by the intiff by the aftceptance Of rent. The forfeiture was claimed on three differentgrounds,-1, that Nr. Lumley, having covenanted that he would not convert the Opera-house to any other use than for acting and performing operas, plays, concerts, balls, masquerades, assemblies, and such theatrical and otherpubhc amusementsorentertainmentsasrhadusualybeen given therein, but that he would use his utmost endeavours to improve the same for that use and purpose," had failed in the performance of his covenant by shutting up the building for a period of three years, extending from 1853 to 1856. It was alleged that by so shutting up the theatre Mr. Lumley had injured its reputation, and that therefore he had not used his utmost endeavours to improve it in accordance with his covenant. The second alleged breach was for his having, contrary to his coveDant, let out certain boxes and stalls to certain persons for a longer time than for one year. an support of this part of his case the plaintiff showed that under a deed dated the 20th of De. cember, 1851, Mr. Lumley had granted certhin boxes therein named, with others, for one year, beginning the 1st of March, 1852, to Messrs. Brandus and Co., and that by another deed he had granted to Mr. W. Hughes the same boxes, with others, from the 1st of February, 1853, for one year, so that the same boxes would be let at the same time although to different persons, for a longer period than one year. The third alleged breach was that, in violation o' his covenant, Mr. Lumley had mortgaged or encumbered the theatre by voluntarily giving warrants of attorney to confess judgments on debts as collateral security for the repayment of money borrowed. The Court of Queen's Bench decided that the only breach of covenant committed by Mr. Lumley was the third, with respect to his having encumberedthe theatre, buttheygavejudgment inhis favour on the ground that there had been a waver of the forfeiture on the part of the plaintiff by his havingreceived rent subsequent to the facts complained of coming to his knowledge The Court of Exchequer Chamber had affirmed this judg ment so far as it was in favour of the defendant, but were of opinion that the defendant had been guilty of no breach of covenant with respect to the third ground, and they therefore did not go into the question of waver of the for. feiture, This latter decision was now appealed tnst and brought by writ of error before their Lorhips' Hfouse. The principal point now relied upon by the counsel on behalf of the Plaintiff was the fact that Mr. Lumley had encumbered his interest in the theatre by voluntarily g the warrants of attorney under which judgment had been obtained against him. It was contended that he having done an act involving certain consequences must be considered to have done all that by law was involved in that aot. By his giving the warrant of attorney he had placed certain persons in a position to obtain a registered judg. ment, and thus they bad gained an equitable charge upon the theatre, contrary to the express covenant contained in the lease. With respect to the question of waver of the forfeiture by the plaintiff, it was contended that the money had only been received as compensation for the occupation of the premises, and not for rent, which would therefore not amount to a waver of the forfeiture. The argaments on behalf of the plaintiff in error were not concluded when their Lordships adjourned, at 4 o'clock. The further hearing wil be resumed to-morrow morning.
ZA W REPORT. VICE-CHANCBLLOp' COURTS. Trmm 29IN RE BENDYSHM. (Before Vice- Chancelor Sir R. T. 3[mDm STv i -in tms case John Bendyshe, by his wilD, dated in 1821, directed his trustees, among other legacies, to raise 4,0001. for the absolute benefit of his daughter Susannah. She attained 21in June, 1850, married the Rev. W. Crowther in April, 1855, and the testator died in December follow. iag. Applications having been made as to the raising of the 4,0004., it was proposed by Captain Bendyshe (frs. Crowther's brother), and the acting trustee (Mr. Townley), that a settlement should be made of the fund upon I s Crowther, and a draught was actually prepared, gnving life estates to Mr. and Mrs. Crowther in succession, with a power of appointment to Mfrs. Crowther, and limitations in favour of chldren. A correspondence took place both before and after this period, which resulted in a requisition or the part of those having the custody of the fund as to invest. ment in the funds, and, that requisition being declined, ulti. mately an application was made by the solicitor of Mr. and Mrs. Crowther that the fund should be paid to Mr. Crowther. To that it was answered that the fund was raised, and would be paid in the ordinary way, but subsequently the idea of a settlement was revived, and, the payment to Mr. Crowther being insisted upon, Captain Bendyshe and Mr. Townley stated that they sould pay the fund into court under the Trustee Relief Act if such settlement was not made, and it was paid in accordingly, minus legacy duty and costs. Mm Crowther bad been examined by commis. sion and also before the examiner, and consented to the payment to her husband, and a petition was now presented by them both, asking for payment out of court and that the trustee might pay the costs. Mr. GLAssE and ir. LnnDLEY, for the petitioners, contended that this was a case where the Cotrt would visit the trustee for vexatiously paying a fund into court by making him pay the costs of such proceeding. Mr. B3tLEY and Mr. CoLi, for the trustee, submitted that he was warranted in what he had done, not being justified in paying over the fund without a settlement, on the lady's examination in court, and that the costs which the trustee was asked to pay had beencaused by the affidavit put in by the petitioners. The truth was that the lady was now anxious for a settlement, and Mr. Townley paid in the 4,0001. reluctantly. The correspondence, moreover, amounted to a binding contract for a settlement. Mr. GLASsE was heard in reply. The VicE-CHArcELLon reserved his judgment. (Before Vice-Ohancellor Sir J. STUART.) WVEBSTER V. VWEBSTER. This was a suit by a widow against the residuary devisee and heir-at-law of her late husband for the purpose of obtaining payment of an annuity granted to her byv her husband. The following were the facts of the case :-In 1843 the plaintiff intermarried with William Grenville Webster her late husband. In eonsequence of some unhappy differ ences between Mfr. and Mrs. Webster they in 1894 agreed to live separate, and by a deed of separation, dated in December, 1844, the late Mr. Webster covenanted to ay his wife, the plaintiff, an annuity of 651. for her life, 1biut did nottherebychargethesame on his real estate. Theseparation took place, but towards the latter end of 1845 Mfr. Webster, being then in fi-health, called on the plaintiff at the house of her mother, with whom she was then residing, and requested her to return and live with him, and he stated that if she would do so the annuity granted to her by the before. mentioned deed should continue payable, and that he would further secure it by charging it on his freehold property. The plaintiff, however, said she could not accede to her husband's request without the sanction of the trustee of the deed of separation, whom her hasband promised to see on the subject. Mr. Webster accordinIgly, early in January, 1846, caUled on Mr. Summers, the plaintiff's trustee, and, on the faith of Mr. Webster's assurance that tho annuity should be charged on his real estate, Mr. Summers consented to the plaintiff's returning to reside with her husband. The plaintiff, relying on her husbands assurance, returned to live with him on the 14th of January, 1846, and continued to do so up to the day of his deatb, which took place on the 26th of that month. The plaintiff-s husband, however, never signed any document charging his lands with the payment of the annuity before mentioned nor did he make any payment of the annuity after his wife's returr to live with him. By his wdll dated December 24, 1845, he gave his real estate to his brother, the first defendant, Frederick Taylor Webster. it was contended on behalf of the defendant Webster that the return of Mrs. Webster to live with her late husband was not ruch a part performance of the parol agree. ment which he had entered into on such return as would take the case out of the provisions of the Statute of Frauds which required the contract, as it was in relation to lands, to be in writing and signed by the late Mr. Webster. Mr. Lee and Mr. Charles HaU wiere for the plaintiff, Mr. Greene for the defendant Webster, and Mr. Smythe and Mr. Wood for otber defendants. The VICE CHANCELLOR said that the defence could not prevail. This was a case in which a married woman, living separate from her husband, with a covenant by him to pay her an annunity, which, it was admitted, was a valid cove. nant, was solicited by her husband to return and live with him at a time when he was oppressed with a grievous illness and when her tender care was necessary for him. The plaintiff, knowing that by her return theprovision whichher usband had made for her by his covenant would be lost, dechned to return to her husband without the sanction of her trustee, who wisely stipulated as a condition of her doing so that the annuity should be secured to her on her husband's real estate. This the husband assented to, but only by parol contract, and on the faith of her husband's assurance that the annuity should be made a charge on his lands she returned to live with him. It was contended that, inasmuch as the agreement being by parol was in relation to lands, the Statute of Frauds rendered it invalid. But it had often been said in this court that that statute, which was passed to prevent fraud, should not be a cloak and an instrument of fraud. A more gross or shocking fraud could hardly be conceived than that the plaintiff's late husband having obtained that consideration for which he had agreed to charge his lands with an annuity for his wife, his devisee and heir-at-law should be permitted to say, under cloak of the Statute of Frauds, that that agree- entv, beingby parol, should not bind the husband's lands. There had been that done by the wife which in this court must be considered as a sufficient pact performance of the contrat, and there would be a decree that the tstator's real estate was charged with the annuity of 651. to the plaintiff.

Maitland tastedl the wine while in the wood, in August, 1851, and told the plaintiff he thought he would make a fair profit by sending it to Montreal. On the 28th of July in the next year the plaintiff bottled a quantity of the wine, and sent it in cases to Montreal, but when it arrived thera it was found to be perfectly unsuitable to the country, and unsaleable. The plain tiff having been informed of this state of things, on the 3-1t' of December, 1852, wrote to the defendants'agent at Montreal to have the goods returned by the first opportunity; but, instead of complying with these orders, the defendants kept the wine till the month of June, 1856. The .wlne was of a very light nature, and came within the deecription given of it by his Lordship as " wine which recedes from virtue as it advances In age," so that it was now quite worthless. A bottl7e of it was procluced in- court, but no one would touch it for some time. At length one of Her Majesty's counsel was bold enough to touch it with his lip, but he immediately rejezted the little he had taken. Mr. Bovmn contended that the defendants had not entered into the contract alleged, nor warranted the wine fit for the Canadian market. The jury said that was their opinion. lordt CAsirpaL sald, the only question then would be, whether the defendants had returned the wine as soon as they ought to have done. Mr. Bovnj said that the defendants would probablyhave returned the wine eooner but for an insolent letter which the plaintiff had written. The letter had been read. Lord CA PsEL rleft the question to the jury, who immediately found their verdict for the defendants. Before the next case was caUed on it appeared that one of the jurymen was not satisfied.

BAEDALEL The plantiff in this action was the widow of a cabman named hull, and she sued the defendant, who traded under the name of Messrs. Pickford and Co., to recover damages for the loss of her late husband, who was killed on the 1st of November, 1856, by the alleged negligence of one of the defendant's van-drivers. It appeared by the evidence of a .Mr..H I that on the evening of the 1st of November last he enlgaged a cab in. leadenhall-street to go to WhitechapeL When tne cab arrived in Whitchapel Hih-street, and was within a short distance of Commercial-street, a van drawn by two horses was seen coming from Commercial-street, on the left hand side of the road, and crossing the road to the rigbt hand side. The cab kept on its course at the rate of six or seven miles an hour, and, as the van also advanced in the opposite direction, there was a danger of collsion. Finding t at he could not get across the road so as to avoid the cab, the driver of the van suddenly checked his horses, and drew them towards the off side; but he was too late, and a collision took place. The near shaft of the cab struck the near shaft of the van, and as-o ran against the wody of the van, and such was the force of the coUision that the cabman was knocked forward over the top of the cab, and picked up so much injured that he died two days afterwards, leaving a widow and eight children. According to the evidence of Mr. HE . one of the passengers in the cab, tke van was on its wrong side when the collision took place, but the horses were walking when the van turned into the street. Other witnesses, however, saidI the horses in the van welre going at the rate owf10miles an hour, and were Tt appeared on cross-examination that the cab-driver, at HIoundiditch, on passing a vehicle the driver of whicb displessedhim, had purposely run tho wheel of his cab against the nose of thehorse, .Hart, the other gentleman who was in the cab, was not called by the plaintiff. It appeared that the deceased drove his own cab, and earned about 2h a-week. The defence was that there had been no,negligence on the part of the defend-anVs servant. Mr. Hart, who was a merchant in St. Mary-axe, was called for the defendant, and stated that, according to his view of the matter, there was no negligence on either side, but that the accident was inevitable. Mr. Hart had taken two of the plaintiffs children into his employ, and had raised a subscription amounting to 261. for the benefit of the widow. Lord CAMPBELL sumned up the evidence to the jury, and left it to them to say whether or not the accident had been occasioned by the negligence of the defendant's man - and, if so, to give the plaintiff such moderate damages as they should think she had sustained by the loss of her husband. The jury retired to consider their verdict, and ultimately found for the plaintiff, with 37g. damages-one-half for the widow, and the other half to be equally divided among six of the children who at the time of their father's death were dependent upon him.

J1ont3ga Uhambers, Q.C, and Mr. Baylis appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Macaulay, Q.C., aud Mr. Biller for the defendant. In 1848 the plaintiff became the tenant from year to year of a house and some land belonging to the defeudant, situate at Exbury, near the New Forest, and the action was to recover the value of improvements made by the plaintiff, and of some fittings and fixtures put up byhim. It had, as was alleged, been agreed that certain outbuildings were to be erected by the defendant, the plaintiff paying half the labour, and also receiving the vaue of any other improvenents which he might make, if the defendant gaTe him notice to quit. In March, 1855, the defendant gave the plaintiff notice to quit. Shortly after receivino this notice the defendant's agent, Ross, applied to the plaintiff for an inventory of fixtures and improvements. Valuers were appointed on both sides, and a valuation made to the amount of 1561. uls. lOd., against which the defendant had an admitted set-off of 601. lbs. 9d. for rent and copse wood, leaving a balance of 951. 16s. ld. The main dispute in the cause was as to the existence of this agreement, and whether the defendant's valuer was authorized to include in his valaation any improvements except a portico, a watercloset, and the bells, amounting to 381. 12s. The jury ultimately were of opinion that the agreement was entered into, and that the defendantsvaluer had authority to include in the valuation al the articles mentioned in the valuation.

COURT OF EXCREOTTF.R.TTv 9. (Sitings at Nisi Prius, bejore ffie LOBD CHIEF BARoN.) This was an action for an assault in throwing the plaintiff out of doors, whereby his leg was injured. The defendant pleaded that he had requested the plaintiff to leave the house (of which the defendant was possessed), but that he had refused to do so, whereupon the defendant, usingno more violence than was necessary, turned him out. The plaintiff replied that the defendant had used greater violence than was necessary. Mr. Huddleston and Mr. Prentice appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Charnock for the defendant. The plaintiff was a journeyman currier out of work. The defendant kept a beershoD caUed "the Gardeners' Arms," Blue Anchor-road, Berinondsey, and the plaintiff. with others of the same class, was at the house on the day in question, about 6 o'clock in the evening, when a quarrel ensued between the plaintiff and one Stagg, who struck him on the eye severely, from the effects of which he sank on the ground, slipping off a chair. Shortly afterwards, Stagg havng left, the defendant desired the plaintiff (who was still suffering from the effects of the blow received from Stagg) to leave the house, and on his not doing Eo seized him and cast him out of the door. The evidence on the part of the plaintiff was, that the defendant took him up by the leg as he lay on the ground, after being cast out, and threw him over, and that this bad caused an injury to the tendons of the leg; and that he had been taken to St. Thomas's Hospital, where he was confined for nine weeks. The hospital-surgeon said the inury was such as might have been caused by the act attribated to the defendant, though he also allowed that it was probable such an injury might be caused by slipping off a chair. For the defence the defendant himself was caUed, who stated that the plaintiff refused to leave when requested, but he admitted that he might have taken him up by the legs as he lay on the ground ontside the house. with his legs partly inside. The defendant caUed several other witnesses, who all stated that the plaintiff refused to leave the house when required. TheLoiD CmxT BARON pointed out that this was admitted by the pleadings. The question was whether there had been any excess. Stagg himself was called, and said that when he strack tho paintiff he "fell down on his hands sideways." AJl the defendant's witnesses denied that he used greater force than was necessary to tirn the plaintiff out. The LomD CmHi BARoN left it to the jury whether the defendant had used more violence than necessary. If so, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict with some damages. If the jury thought that the injury to the leg arose from the act of the defendant the damages sbould be larger. The jury found for the plaintiff-Damages, 5l.

COUBT of BANKRUPTCY, Bcainghall-stred, June 2a, IN RE P- K1KUB T, LANW (Before Mfr. Commisioncr 'FONKBLAQuQE and Mr. Commit- sioner GoULTTnRrNn The bankrupt was an attorney and also a bill discounter, of Argyll-place. This was a petition presented by the executors of Mr. Richard Hodge, deceased, in respect to a claim of 1,200h and interest thereupon. His HoNouR (Fonblanque) after referring to the oircum., stances of the case and tho laws regarding usury, dismissed the petition with costs. MIr. Commiwioner GoLnuTs concurred. Notice of appeal against the judgment of the Court was given. fl RE CBRISTOPMHR HA. The bankrupt is described as a merchant of Sun-court, CornhilL. His HoNouR (Goulburn) now gavo jadgment on the question of certificate He said a point arose whether the oon. sent of the trade asignee (a creditor for less than 1001) to the baukrupt receiving a certificate should have the effect of taking away the discretion of the Court upon the matter. According to reports, the Lords Justices were in the habit of granting prote^tion in such cases. He felt that he could not adopt that course, because it would be doing an injustice to creditors. If the coursewere adopted of actinguponthe opinion of assignees or creditors, and not upon the opinion of the Court, they would revert to the practice which had prevailed in past years, and there would be secret arrangements between bankrupts and creditors of a most mischievotts elsracter. The fact of the present case were these :-The bankrupt's accounts commenced on the 1st of May, 1856, and the petition for adjudication of bakruaptcy was faed on the 6th of April, 1857. In this short period of U months the bankrupt bad contracted debts to the amount of 4084Z. which were wholly unsecured, and 6,2Mq which were orly partially secured by consignments. Daring this period his profits, according to his own estimate (which was afiction), were only 2091, while his trade expenses were 359h and his domestic expenses were 744. The question arose who was the bankrupt? He found that in November, 1855, he petitoned this Court under the Arrangement Clauses His debts were then 11,012h and he paid 2e. 6d. in the pound. Only thus just emerged from insolvency the banlrupt had again run into debt to the amount of 10i0004, and there would not be a farthing for the unsecured creditors Was he to say that because one creditor for 1004 was satisfied that this Court would not take cognizance of the general facts of the cas? He waas told that, according to some decisions elsewhere, he must not take cognizance of these general facts, but having regard to the terms of the Act, that this Court was to judge of the conduct of a trader, whether opposed or not, he could not entertain this view. It was said that the Lords Justices would only withhold protection in cases of fraud. That raised the question, wvt was fraud? He considered it fraudulent wnere the debtor obtained credit without having the least posmbility of making payment. The Legilature had considered this course fraudulent; for in the Ilsolvent Debtors' Court the obtaining of goods without reasonable expectation of mang payment was held to be fraudulent The bankrupt's certicate (third class) would be suspended 12 months, andheonlygrantedprotection because his bookshad been well kept. Mr. Comnissioner FONLAaQE said that, although he attached due weight to the opinion of creditors, he always felt that if this Court did not act upon its indenendent judgment they would revert to the injustice which had nrevailed under the old system. All persons old enough to remember the jobbing in certificates which had prevailed under that ystem could have no desire to see its revivaL Mr. LAwRINcE intimated his opinion that the Court of Appeal had never intended in its judments to deprive this Court of the right of exercising the fuliest discretion Mr. Commissioner GoULcURN said an evil existed in their not having any accurate means of knowing what passed before the Lords Justices 31r. LIAWiAcE said the fact was the law journals only briefly reported the legal points in cases, and the public papersonly reported matters of pabliointerest. Hencethey had not so full a record as could be desired. The proceedings before the Lords Justices, generally speaking, were not interesting to the public. Mr. Commissioner FONBLAQE.-Their Lordships don't draw. (Laughter.) A tigmeat of 12 months' suspension, with protection, was then recorded. IN RE HUGH INE COIRRON.

Mr. Sargood supported. On the Lth of December last, the night of the fire at Messrs Broadwood's, the insolvent alleged that he was robbed by Fanny Daintree of his watch, chain, and seals in the arbour of the Old Swan Chelsea. In U days afterwards he gave her into custody at her father's house, a woodcutter, na ttersa. The charge was made on a Saturday after. noon, and she was locked up until the following Monday, when it was proved at the police court she was with other persons from X till 10, and, as the alleged robbery was said to have been committed at 9 o'clock, she vas discharged. An action was brought for false imprisonment, and judgmnent suffered to go bydefault, The damages awarded were 301., and the costs about 33L, on which he had been in prison since the 3d of December. The insolvent made a long statement in his schedule, and declared that if he was on his dying bed he should say Fanny Daintree was the young woman who had robbed him. The young woman and other witnesses were called. She admitted she had a child, being only 21, and thatonce before she was charged 'with stealing some clothes, but which were afterwards foind, save one article which she was allowed to wear until her own was ready. The CBaEF COImISSIONER thought the young woman was fully entitled to the verdict given, and was now entitled to a judgment as a vindication of her character. In his opinion, she had explained the former charge against her. The learned Conrrssxomm gav,e a judgment of five monthsfrom the vesting order under the discretionaryclause made on the 15th of ApriL (Beforec Mr. Commissoner PHJPS.)

I told him we were officers, and we had reason to believe that he wvas the person referred to in the plice notice as having absconded from Coldstream upon a charge of forgery, and that our information was strengthened by a daguerreotye likeness which I had in my possession, and which I beieved bore a strong resemblance to him.

GuiLDIALL.-Alfred Ballad, as Kely, a supernumerary shoeblack, was charged with breaking into and plundering several countinghouses in Tyler's-market, Warwick-lane. This case was heard before Alderman Hale on a former occasion, when it appeared that the watchmen of the market on Sunday week last found that sevefal countinghouses belonging to Mr. Thompson and Mr. Andrade had been forcibly entered, and they therefore communicated the circumstance to those gentlemen, who immediately proceeded thither, when they discovered that the windows of four countinghonses had been forced and the desks broken open. On examining the latter it was ascertained that a bag containing about 44 of battered silver had disappeared, while a bag containing a similar anount of counterfeit silver had been examined and rejected. A pair of gold spectacles and other artiles had also been transferred from one office to another. 'he prisoner was found ooncealed in another part of the market, and upon being searched the miising baz of silver ws found upon him, and he admitted hvn rko into the conntinghouse and described the mDeans he had se in doing so.

(The witness here exhibited the back of her head,which appeared much swollen, as though from a blow.) I tried to recover myself, but he immediately followed me up, and struck me again several times about the head with his flst.

"Sinee Wednesday -ctive -arch has beon Wade to obtaia possession of 'this key, which is regardcd by the prosecutors of much importanee. The little rver Bradoge was explored in every part fromthe bouadary of the railway to the extreme end cf -the Iorth UJnion Wlorkhouso garden, throagbh whioh it ru Archways audi}agging were taken away to faciliate the search, the nnd and ,k;ic of all kinds removed, lraked, and sifted over .nd over again to no purpose. On Saturday evening one cf the paupor boys discovered it in a heap of the mad?nd 'lth whioh had been turned up from the river, and which was lying on the workhouse field adjoining the railway. The boy gave it' to a weedmaster named Dillon, whc handed it to Mr. Weddick, the master of the workhouse, 'nd by this-time it is in the hands of the Police authorities. It isa rather small door key, much rusted, uandone of the wardsbroken oM: The trath of Mrs. Spollen'e statement was proved by the money being found Iin the places 'in which she-said her husband and herself had conoealed it, and now her -statement that the key had been thrown over 'the wall into the river is foLly verified. It has beon stated that Spollea attempted to make away with his wife by poison, 'and ibow far this statement is correct may be inferred 'from the folrowing ciroumstances, About two months ago Iho became very unwell with a pulmonary affection, when a medical gentleman was called in by Mrs. Spollen and at. tended him for some days. Serious symptoms presented themselves in the case, and the doctor, bdieving that the prisoner2s life was in imminent danger, said to Mrs. Spollon -that another medical man should be called in, as he did not like to take the responsibility of her husband's ease on himself. She observed that she was too poor to pay a fee to o4 second doctor, when the doctor told her not to make herself uneasy on that score, as he thoughat a medical friend of his would give his services, under the circumstances, grataitously. The two doctors saw him, and continued to nttend him until he was convalescent. During the long 'llness of her husband M. Spollen was most attentive to him, and frequently eat up with bim all night. About 10 'days ago one of Mrs. Spollen's children came to one of the -doctors and' toldi him that his mother was very bad, and asked for something that would relieve her. The doctor said as she was so bad that he would go up and see her, and he "did-so accordingly, He found her in bed suffering saote agony from spasms in the stomach aud violent retching. Ho -asked her how long she had been affected in that way, and he -said that she had been very bad since the day previous, and that she had spent a fearful night. The doctor asked her why she did not send for him before, and she answered that 'it was unknown to her husband that she had sent for him, as he said that he wonld have the life of any one who would go for a doctor for her. On the occasion of the doctor's firet visit to the woman the retching became so violent that he had to use chloroform and creosote to try and check it, which he succeeded in doing. While she was under treatment she cent to him to say that she was getting quite paralyzed at one side, and that she was losing the use of one of her arms and one of her legs, and also that her fingers were becoming quite nambed. The doctor saw her at once, and fouad that the statement which lshe had mado was correct. For the purposo of restoring vitality he had to apply, strong external stimulants along the spinal column, and along the arm, side, thigh, and leg affected, and with considerable difficulty brought her gradually round. On one occasion she observed to him that her husband had got up in the night, and that she and the ehildren were afraid that ho was going to cut their throats. From the symptoms of Mrs. Spollen's case there can be no doubt of some poison having been administered to her, but 'rhat that poison was cannot now be determined. James Spollen, the son of the prisoner, is still in Chancery-lnan police-station. As we have already stated, ho was subjected to a-lengthened examination by the Crown Solicitor and Mr. Superintendent Guy on Frlday last at the Broadstono terminus. 'On that occasion he stated that his father, mother, -and himself went out on the night the murder was perpetrated, and went to Moore-street, when they bought blackpuddings, end that the three came home at about 10 o'clock; after that the puddings were cooked for supper. EHis father, on observing that his mother was not eating, asked her why she did not do so. She replied that she could not, as the puddings reminded her of a case which occurred in England of a man who had committed murder, and who came home with sweetmeat in his hands, which were all covered with blood; he offered his wife some of the sweetmeats, which she took, and a part of them stuck in her throat when she attempted to swallow them. It will be remembered that Mrs. Spollen stated that the money was brought home from the office of Mr. Little after the murder, and hid in the chimney of the old locomotive aheds before the prisoner went into town with her aed his son. With reference to the finding of the monay, it is stated that young Spollen says that he saw his father go up the chimney by a ladder from the outside taking a pot-up with him. He also said that he thought it was water which his father was taking up to pour down through the chimney on a number of men who were in the habit of sitting round the fire below. We understand that it was with much difficulty that these few remarks were exdracted from him, and, as it fs supposed that he can teW much more, he was ordered to be taken back to the stationhouse, and not to be allowed to commumicate with any persons save the constables in charge of him. Mrs. SpoUen and hier daughterare at their residenee at the terminus, under the surveilance of the police. Mrs. SpoUen was engaged during a part of yesterday indicating to the police the places where she thought her husband was likely to have concealed the mniesig 501., and the search was continued up to an ad. -vanced hour in the evening, but without suceess. The Xazor found is not as yet idenified by the man who, it is alleged, had made a present of it to the prisoner. This person is said not to be in Dublin, but means will be taken to show it to him this day or to-morrow. The prisoner, after having been-remandedon Saturday, had to be detained in Capol-street Police-office for a considerable time in con- equence of 'the crowvds which remained around the doors waiting to see him; but late in the evening he was pri-vately brought to a cab, in which he was placed, closely *ga rded, se driven off to Richmond Bridewell, where he will remain until brought up for exauination on Wednes. -day next."

The subject of tihe prize essy by Colvin -was, T he effect of the discovery of the passage by the Cape of Good Hope on the nations of Europe and.s engaged In the Eastern trade." The author, who read his essay, took a comprehensive view of trade and coromerce from the earlest times, Including those of Solomon, the Pheenicians, the Greeks of Constantinople, the Vezietians the Elemings, Spain, and Portugal, when the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope by that nation introduced a new era into the commercial history of the world and laid the foundation of a great empire in the East, but which it was destined for abler hands to complete. England had by her superior genius in a large degree developedthe vast resources of that extensive region, and had spread, and was spreading, civilization among millions of the native population, to whom he hoped it would prove an eternal source of blessing and of peace. On presenting the prize to Mr. Colvin the CILURmis. said,-Allow me to offer to you my most sincere conr tu. lations for the proofs of ability andhigh merit which yo have given, and I hope and believe that the success which has attended you upon this occasion is only the prelude to that eater degree of success which you are about to gain in dia. (Cheers.) I underatand you are the son of that excellent man, Mr. Colvin, the present Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces. I have this day rseeived a letter from that admirable public sErvant, written amidst the scenes which are now unhappiy taking place in Indiaa letter vritten with all that public spirit, that high intelli. gce, and that devotedzeai which have always distinguished him; and, I doubt not, that if you walk in his steps and follow his bright example, the blessing of God will rest upon you, and will raise you to as high a position as that which your father by his energy and devo*on to his public duties has attained. (Cheers.) F When Mr. Bernard, to whom had been awarded no less than five prizes, came forward, he was tumultuouslycheered byhlsfeliow-stadents, and the Chairman not only congratu. Iated him on his success as a student, but on the great popu. larity which he evidently enjoyed among his frieuds and companions in the coMlege. The next favourite was Mr. Burney, a descendant of the literary family of that name, who, although he gained but one prize-namely, for classics, had the word "Exemplary" opposite his name in the column for "General conduct," and "QuitQ e regar" as msldnNe his attendance at chapel The other mds and prizes having been distributed by the Chairman with encouraging and complimentary remarks to the successful competitors, the hon. gentleman asked permission to address, in the presence of that assembly, on his own behalf, and on behalf of the Court of Directors whom he represented, their cordial thauk h tothe Principal and Professors of the collee for the great pains they had taken and the assiduity with which they had apphed themselves to the duties of their office, which had been proved by the result of that day's examination. (Cheers.) He wasihappy to say that the report of the principal in regard to the students during the past term was highly satisfactory. A much larger number than usualhad passedtheir examtnations bothinthe Fourthaudthe Third terms:with marks of distinction. (Cheers.) It was afact not a little remarkable that, although there had been many Directors who were educated at that coSSege he was the hrst who, having received his education there, had fined the chair which he then had the honour to fill. (Cheers.) Asthey all knew that the days of the college were numbered, if his life should be spared he would be the last chairman as he happened to be the first of the Court of Directors who was educated at that institution. Ee deeply regretted that the college was about to close. He stated this in his evidence before the committee of the Eouse of Commons. It was his desire to sDeak in terms of the greatest gratitude of the educational advantages which he had received at that institution and he believed that virtnay the same system had been continued from that time to the present day. He came to thatcollegeefrom one of the first and greatest of their public schools-Eton-and brought with him a little Latin and less Greek. (A laugh.) He mighb have brought more of those languages, but it was quite certain he could have brought nothing else; for at that time Eton only taught Greek and Latin, the most diligent boy, therefore, could have learned nothing W"re. Hewas at that college when Malthus, Mackintosh, and Le Bas held professorships, and when Dr. Batten was Principal, names which even at this day he could not mention without feelings of emotion. By their svstem he received the first stimulus to exertion, and which he believed had fitted him, as it had fitted many others, to disch,arge those publio services which he and they had eince rendered to the East India Company and to their country. (Cheers.) To those young men who were about to proceed to India he wished to address a few earnest words of counseL He begged them to remember in the first place that they would be exposed in India to a very strong competition. They would have to exert themelves to maintain the European poSi tion in advance of the educated native Indian. The East India Company's tenure in India, and, more than that, their power of usefulness there, depended upon the European civil servants maintaining an intellectual and moral position in advance of the educated natives, who, he could assure them, were second to no people in the world for their acuteness and power of acquiring knowledge. It would not, therefore, be a light matter for them to maintain their relative position with regard to those men. But, as students of Haileybury, there was another competition which they would have to meet. They would have to maintain the honour of the institution to which they at present belonged, and to justify the system by which they had been appointed to the civil service, in competing wit gentlemen who were going out to India every year under a different system. The honour of the institu. tion would thus be committed to their hands- au institution they ought to bear in mind which Lad sent forth many distiDguished men; an Elphinstone, a Metcalfe, a Holt Mackenzie, a Halliday, Sir John Lawrence, Thomason, Colvin, and a host of others. (Cheers.) But he relied upon their zeal, and felt confident they would prove themselves worthy of being the successors of such eminent men. (Cheers.) He earnestly advised them when in India to keep themselves clear of all pecuniary embarrassments, and to avoid habits of extravagance, which inevitably led to ruin. Theremight We some rare instances of men of strong minds finaUy overcoming the results of the besetting vice of contracting debts; but the general rule was that debt rendered the young man the slave of his creditor, and utterly unfitted him for the discharge of any duty that devolved upon him. The allowance they woald receive would be sufficient for their proper support, and he therefore entreated them not to incur any monetary obli gations, especially with the natives. (Hear, hear.) That, indeed, was positively forbidden by the regulation3 of the Company; but without any such rule it ought to be a thing repugnnt to the feelings and honour of EUglshmen. (Cheers.) Be would also urge upon them the wisdom of keeping up their connexion and relationship with their nativcoauntry. (Cheers.) It wouldhbe a great source of comfort to their minds; it would sweeten the long hours of exile which they would necessarily have to endure, and would greatly tend to promote their happiness while a from those they loved. A nd when they returned, as they would do in the course of time on furlough to their native land to revive and freshen up their associations with Eng-l land, they would find that It gave strength to the mind and a new - impulse -to the heart to be able to appeal to friends and relations in this their native country, (Cheers.) There was one topic still more important than all on which he had yet addressed them. Going as they were about to do to that heathen land where they would be placed over millions of Mahommedans and Hindoos, he would entreatthem to cleave to the truereligion in whioh they had been brought up, and not to lose their reverence for or their faith in the sublitne doctrines of Christanity. They might depend upon it-and he spoke as one who had been trned by sickness and suffering in that land-that they would find true religion and true faith a mighty solace and support in the hour of affliction and of sorrow. (Cheers.) It was so here, and it would be especially so in India, where they would oftentimes be separated from the offtces of religion, and be frequently left without any European associations, having nothing else to sustain them but their own reflections, and nothing but the early inculcations they had received of the truths of the Gospel on which to rely. (Cheers.) To those who wonld remain and form tho last term of this insttution he would nddress a few parting words. He begged that they would strive to make the last term the best (cheers)-the best in general conduct, and the bes in the powers of application to the excellent studies of the place. (Cheers.) He believed that a spirit of emulation was created in the minds of the scholars by this system of examination and distribution of prizes; and he thought it was the best system that could be devised for stimulating bonourable young men to exertions that would gain for them herer.fter the highest rewardg. (Cheers.) When Ciesar was about to fall he was p,arMicularly careful that it should be with honour, and with his robes around him as a Roman ought to fall. So he hoped that the young men who were about to remain for the ls4 term would feel as English gentlemen ought to feel, that the honour of the institntion was intrusted to their hands and that, tiuig it bad pleused the Imperial Legislatur to declare that t *a expiration of the ensuing term the college should 'fer4ver closs it ought to close with honour and credit to w11 vho had ever on connectod with it. (Cheers.) The compa then retired to the great hall of the colleg .whete a lunebeon had beenprepared, and of which they were invited to partake. After doing ftll justice to tho excllent visnsphoed before them, The CuJ.mx& rose and said that it was a rule on those ocesios nob to propose more than one toat, and that toast was the health of the Principal. (Cheers.) He deeply xegretd that that rev. gentleman had been provented from attending the present meeting by a domestic calamity oonnected with the pnblo calamity which had befallen the Government of Inda, the intelligence of which had bub re. cently beena received. They could all sympathize with their rev. friend in his affliction; but, while most of them had their private griefs to endure, they must stiUl discharge theirpablioduties. He,too,had those whowerenearand dear to him exposed to periL It was, however, gratifying to know that at these crises thero were not wanting men in the civil servicoe of India who were endued with a moral courage and a bravery of sirit equal to any ever displayed bytheirmilitaybretren.Cheerm) He could not recall the name of the young man to whom so many prizes had that day been awarded without speaking in terms of the highest praise of his honoured father, John Colvin, for the noble conduct he had dirplayed at a crisia which demanded all the patriotism and sldll of a great leader to quell the commotion that had broken out in the provinoea under his government. (Cheers.) It was a proud reflection that there were men ever ready and able to serve their contry at a moment of peril; and it muat be most gratifying to all connected with the college to know that such men as Colvin, Lawrence, and 3font. gomery had been educated there. (Cheers.) Without de. taingin the comany further he begged to asre them that Her Majesty's Government and t'he East India Company were most cordially co.operating in devising measures that would effectually put down all disturbance and disaffection in India, and would, he firmly believed, place that vast empire on amore settled, satisfactory, and lasting basis than ever. (Oheers.) After a few observations by Professor Hz&VISIDX, who retarned thanks on behalf of the Principal, the company withdrew, and the greater. number of them immediately .retrnedto town.

THI LATE CoLrNom FINms.-Colonel Finris, of the 11th Native Infantry, who was shot by the nauti. mons soldiers of the 20th Regiment at the outbreak of the revolt at Meerart, was the lst surviving brother of the present Lord Mayor of London, and the third who has fallen in the service of his country. The elder brother, Robert, a Captain in the Britsh navy, was killed in an engagement on Lake arie in 1813 ; and anotber, Stephen, a Lieutenant in the Bengal Native Infantry, fell in India in 1822. Colonel Finnis, though only in his 54th year, had been in active service in the army upwards of 32 years, during which 'period, besides serving at the siege and taking of Moultan, and in several other engagements, he was employed on many important missions. The Colonel was with his regiment in command at Allahabad until ordered to Meerut, where he had arrived only a few days before the outbreak which closed his career. With kind consideration for the feelings of his bereaved family, the Governor-General ha8 transmnitted the following letter to the Lord Mayor:- " Government-hbc4e, Calcutta, My 30. *MyLord Uayor.-Painful as theltelligencewhioh I have to oon;y will be to yonr Lordship.

I -RAILWA.A LONDON KU , special ge ei Frida at the i standing orders # the Hou aef ordsAl inow~n the Parlment th Mr . BC STEWART. the secretay, rey d the no vening the,ineet,ng The CaN dtu fint Bill he hsad to mbmit was A. Bill for authorizing the converdon of parts of the Shropshire canal to the purposes of a railway, and the making and clamntainng of a railway accordingly; and for authorizing arrangements between the London and North-We6tern Railway Company and other companies, and for other purposes." He said there was considerable traffic inthe district, but the circutnstances connected with 'the canal were of such a nature that there was a deficiency in the supply of water, and the large mining operations underitrendereditunsafetocarryonthe-trafEc. Thecost of constructing the railway and the interest on the outlay would be mach less than keeping the canal in its present state. The Solicitor then readthe headx of the BilL The C }AXamLA moved alormul relolto approving the Bill, subject to such modification as Parlamentand the directors may Aeem expedient. Mr. DsCunssox moved an amendment to the effect that the approvda of the Bill be postponed, and that a committee of shareholders be appointed to inquire Into the propriety of sanctoning the measre. Mr. J. Ca aoNLuI ceconded the amendment. The CeAnirn stated that the matter had been well considered by the board of directors, and had resulted in the modification proposed, to convert portions of the canal into a railway, and to maintain the canal at the lower levela, where the supply f water was sufficient. On a show of handeit appeared that six were in favour of the amendment and alare wiajority against it. On the original motiohi being put there were 80 in favour of it and seven against it. The C }I&nrsr~ explained that it would be necea to take a poll on the question, as at leas three-fourths of the capital represented at the meeting mut bein favour of the Bl tocouirmits approval.

On the motion for the apropal of the Bill there appeared 35 in favour of it andl two against it. A pol was demanded, and the same samutineers geed to ac. A formal resolution approving a Bill or makinga railway from Ealing to Richmond, to be called the Richmond and Kew Extensionxaqlway, was caried unanimously. The meeting was then made special to consider the headls of-a proposed arrangement for a lease of the CaOnock Mineral Uiway. The Solicitorread the heads of agreement for leming the line, when completed, for 5. per annum. On the motion for the approval of the agreement some discussion took place, which resulted in the passing of the resolution. The report of the scrutineers showed that 81 persons present and by proxy, representingl,221,6651. aidup stock, voted in favour of the Shropshtre Canal BDll, and seven persons against it, representing 75,8811. paid-up stock; and that 81 persons, representing 1,221,6611. paid-up stook,voted in favour of the Stockport, Dialey, and Whaleybridge Extensfon Bill, and five persons, holding 68,881 paid-up stock, voted against it. The approval of the B&ill was therefore confirmed. The meeting was then adjourned to Frid y next to onsider the Castle Douglas BilL A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded te pro. oeedings. GREAT NORTHERN. On Friday evening an acident happened on this line to the 8 p.m. train on its way from Kings-cross to Holloway. The trin was a heavy one, and on leaving the station a very severe jerk was felt n several of the carnrages. When the trai arrived at about the centre of the Copenhagen tunnel the speed suddenly decreased in oonsequence of the engine having broken sawy from the train, and in its course disturbed two rails. The impetus given the train caused it to ollow at a reduced speed until it stopped near the end of the tunneL The carriages composing the train, standing partly in dtn partly oat of the tonnel, had to remiin in that position until the rails werereplaced and another engine obtained to push the train behind and the other to pullin front till it gotto Holloway. After some delay both engines were place in front, and the train proceeded at a good pace tofHornsey, but in consequence of the less of time from the accident it became necessary to shunt the train on to the np lize to allow the fast train from London to Edinburgh to pass it. That being accomplished, the train was again placed on the down line, and prooeeded to Colney Htch, where it arrived about a-quarter to 10, being above an hour and 20 minutes beyond its usual time, causing considerable anxiety to the passengers and tb many of their relative4who feaehat some more serious accident had oocurred. This is not the first time of delay to the 8 o'clock train, as one oocurred a few weoks ago, when the train was brought to a standstil in the middle of the same tunnel, and remained there until the assistance of a second engine was obtained. The over-loading of the 8 o'clock train arises partly from the inerease of local traffic and from there being go train between 6 and 8 o'clock in the evenin Should passengers happen to be too late for the 6 o'clocgi train they have to wait with others until 8 o'clock, aud hence the overcrowding of that train. The 9 o'clock train is generally a light one. If the object be the savig of a train for a comparatively short distance down the line, the great mass of the passengers being conveyed to Hornsey, Colney Hatcb, Southgate, and Barnet, the saving must be doubtful, as itis frequeintly necessary to employ two enges to propel tho 8 o'clock train at least as far as Colney tch When the 7 o'clock train was taken off in October or November last great complaints were msde by season ticket holders and other residents along the line wvho strongly urged the inconvenience of having to wait till 8 o'clock every evening during the winter months, but without eÃ¯Â¿Â½rect, as it appeared that some one in iOwer had determined they should not havo It. The 7 o clock train, however, was again put on on the Ist of May, but to the surprise of mnany was discontinued on the 1st of June, and owing to the nature of the traffic on the hie it is feared that if the discontinuarce of the?r o'clock train be persisted in throughout the summer something serious will be the CRYSTAL PALACE. The report of the directors of this company states that the revenue for the year ending the 30th of April amounted to 115,621, and the expenses to 87,872, including renewals, showing a proEit of 27,76551 To this is added 8511. from the last account, maklng 28,6061. From this iBdeducted 6,1871. for interest on debentures, 5,7431. interest on temporar loans, and 11,98SL. dividend on 7 per cent. preference shares, leaving a balance of 5,6874 SOUTH WALES. A special meeting of this company was held on Friday at the Paddangton station, Mr. Mathews in the chair. Mr. F. Saunders, the secretary, read the notioe convening the meeting. The Css&rrcw said the first matter they had to consider was a Bill now before Parliament for maldng a railway from the South Wales line to Portskewitt, a steam-ferry across the river Severn, and arailway thenoetoBristol. The directors had agreed to subscribe 2,0001. towards the undertaking, which they believed would be of great advantage. The solicitor read the heads of " a Bill for main rail ways between the city of Bristol and the South Wales Railway, with a steam ferry across the Sovern in oonnexion therewith for the purpose of improvlng the railway communication between South Wales and the southwestern districts of Enqland." After a thort discumon, a formal resolution approving the Bill waa adopted. The CGHARmAx said it would be recollected that just before the last meeting an injunction had been obtained to restrain the company from paying any dividend until the Pembroke line was made. An arrangement was entered into with those parties in order to remove the injunction and enable the company to pay the dividend. The terms of the arrangement were to the effect that the directors of the South Wales Railway should obtain the assent of the shareholders to the arangement pnor to July next, for making a branch railway from LangElmto Pembroke by the end of 1860, and that the company would make application to Parliamentin the ensuing session for power to construct thelinein accordanco with the agreement. He concluded by moving a formal resolution confirming the agreement of the 20th of February last in respect of the Pembroke branch railway. After some observations from Mr. RIDGWAY, Mr. ALLi, and Mr. REss, the resolution was adopted, and the proceedings terminated. RAILWAY RECEIPTS.
