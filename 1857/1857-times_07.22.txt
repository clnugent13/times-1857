REPOitT o-, RECENT RAILWAY ACcInsjnr.-The offlicL-d report on certain recent railway accidentshas been issued by the Railway Department of the Board of Trade. A collision on the 6th of May last near the Overtown station of the Caledonian Ri7lway is attributed entirely to the culpable negligence of the engine-driver and fireman of the mineral train. The practico of running engines at high speed with the tenders foremost is strongly reprobated in this report. The aeCilent at Bangor, on the Chester and Holyhead line, which occurred on the 1Uth of March, appears attributable to a tnempestuous wind. The accident ou the Cockermnouth and Workington line, near the Cannerton station, which occurred on the 31st of March, arose from an unsafe engino and a rickety permanent way on a too flexible skew viaduct. An accident on the Edinburgh and Glasgow line, on the 3d of April, arose from some defect in the permanent way, but there is no ground for imputing blame to tl7e management in this particular instance. The accident at Tuxford, on the Great Northern Railway, on the 14th and l5th of April, Is attributed to a peauliar action of the joints of the rails on the axles of the carriages. Three explosions of boilers of locomotive engines on the Lancashire and Yorkshire, the Midland, and the Belfast and Ballymena Railways, are disenssed at great length by Lieutenant-Colonel Wynno, R.E. The causes appear to have included the thinness of the boiler plate at the stays, the corrosion of the internal surface of the cast-iron plates, and the sudden generation of a volume of steam of a temporature (probably) exceeding the melting point of lead by the heating of the fire-box. A collision on the North-Western line ncar Smethwick on the 27th of February is traceable to the gross negligence of the engineman and breaksman of the goods train. An aecident on the North-Eastern line at tae Lambton or Rainton crossing, on the 14th of March, is attributed to excess of speed and diminaution of the " cant." In this case the train got off the line. Lastly, an accident at the Seaton Colliery siding on the Whitebaven Junction line, wvhich took place on the 17th of March, appears tohave been the fault of the pointsman, who expiated his guilt by two months' imprisonment with hard labonr in Carllsle gaoL THE GALWAY TowVN EucwONm--The reporb of the Galway Election Committee, yesterday published, shows that the decision which unseated the ex-member, M1Tr. Antbony O'Flaherty, vas unanimous. The evidence occupies about 60 pages of the official reportt
THE PARLIAMETARY OATRS BILL. DEPUTATION TO LORD PAI,MERSTON. . Yesterday morning a numerous deputation from the members of the House of Commons favourable to the principle of the Psrliamenta-ry Oaths Bill waited upon Lord Palmerston, at his private residence, for the purpose of ascertaining what were the views entertained by Her Majesty's Government in respect to the legislative course proposed to bo taken by the friends of civil and religiousliberty in consequence of the rejection of the Jewish Disabilities Bill by the House of Lords. Between 30 and 40 of the chief members at the late meetIng of Thursday last were present. Mr. HORSM" acted as speaker, and said,-My Lord we wait on your Lordship to communicate to you the resolutions that were passed at a meeting of members of the Liberal party in Palace-yard on Thursday last. It was a very nunerous meeting nailed by requisition-was composed by members of Parliament only-and the attendance was of such a character as to constitute a full and fair representa tion of the great body of your Lordships supporters in the House of Commons. The object of it was to consider of the course which it -would be wise and fitting that the Liberal patty should pursue in consequence of the rejection of the Oaths Bill by the House of Lords. Certain resolutions were passed, which it is may duty novrto read to your Lordship, but before doing so I may state -that the meeting was strongly of opinion that the recent decision of the House of Lords should not be tamely acquiesced in, but that another effort should be made during the presenlt session to repair its consequences; and the meeting having to consider the alternative proposals of Mfr. Dillwyn to endeavour to seat Baron Rothschild by a resolution of thb House, and the Bill which Lord John RusselL had given notice of his intention to introduce, came to the determination that Mr. DiUewyn's resolution should be postponed, and Lord ,John's Bill supported. But I ought to add that the feeling in favour of at once attempt. ing to seat Baron Rothschild by resolution, was most favourably received by a large portion of the mceting, and it was, I believe, only given up from its proposers believing that, vhile complete unanimity would thus in the first instance be esecured iq support of Lord John's Bill, the rejection of that Bill, if it took place, vwould again tend to unanimity in favour of an at'empt to seat Baro Rothsohild by resolution. We therefore come to ask your Lordship either -to. support Lord John's Bill, with a determination, in caso of its rejection, to lead your party in the endeavour to seat Baron Rothschild by resolution, or that, if Lord John's Bill cannot properly be supported this se'sion, the Government will at once declare themselves in favour of seating by rosolation. We know that ia such a matter wo can, as a party, do nothing withoat the Government, as the Government can do nothing without their party. We are fully sensi'ole of the value of our leaders, of our dependence on them, and of the consideration and allegiance always due to them. But at the same time I ought not to conceal from your Lordship (what, indeed, one of the resolutionswiUl convey)thabthere is adeep convictiooe among your friends that the Oaths Bill, when lately before the House of Lords, did not derive from the union of the members of the Cabinet among themselves that moral strength and support which is of infinitely more value than all their votes; and tho embarrassment which we are now all experiencing in the false relation in which we are standing to your Lordship-your followers taking counsel among themselves and communicating their intended course to the Cabinet, instead of the Cabinet guiding tho course of their supporters-is the penalty we are on ei'ther side paying for what we respectfully conceive was on the part of the Government a mistake. My Lord, we feel that your Lordship has at present the strongest party following that any Minister has had since the Reforma Bill-strong, not in numbers only, but in the spirit and the desire for union that pervade all sections of the party; and there is a general wilsh to postpone questions of difference vAth the Government if they wiU butlead us vigorouslyand wisely on those on which we are all agreed. Foremost. among these stands the question of civil disabilities imposed as as a consequence of religious belief. Your attempt by thc Oaths Bil to relieve our fellow-subjects of theJcwih persuasion from that ijujstice has been again defeated. It is not usually deeuncd wisein any Governmont tosubmit tamely to such defeats, and we do not think it becoming in so strong a Government as yours to do so. Every such defeat muss necessarily causo weakness to a party, and weakness must tend to disorganization. We are well assured thbat there is no question on which the Governmient and their followers can be more of one mind and united by ono interest thbn on that now before us. But were it unfortunately other wise, the great body of your supporters do feel that in this principle there isso much involved, and in regard to it our party position is so critical, that we could not sacrifice the character of a party that is enduring to an over deference to the Government, whose existence-necessarily brief as compared to that of its party-must be rendered yet moro precafious by its net appreciating the spirit, and so casting awvay the hearts of its sapportord. At the conclusion of hsis remarks 3?r XORS.H TAi read to his Lordship a copy of thoresolations which had been passed sat the meeting of Thursday last, wvhich are as follows - That the fact that on the late division In the House of Lords al the members of the Cabinetdid not supDortthc Oaths Bill Is calculated to ouao deep pain and disappoutraest to the 1tberslparty and that Lord Pe3lmer4ton be respectfally aud earnestly solicited to lend the w;hole weigit and influence of his Government in suDport ofLord John RuesEels proDoped Bill, and, in the event of it3 rejection, tbat the Govtrnment wDil id the attempt to seat Baron Rothschild by a resolation of tho Houlse ot Ceommos I That the fact that io the late dtvidoin inthe acure of Lords all the memnbers of tho Cabisnst did not support the Oaths sill is calcuated to cuze deep-iaiad d sa"appointrabutto the Liber.lpDarty. *That tho time has arrivied whea tho long-vexed questlonrior th6 . moval of Jewish disabUities should bo finauy settled, and, conrider Ing tho repeatedmanitestations of opinion in the House of Commonand In the country in favoir of this act of policy and justice, *U the energiea of the Liberal sarty should now be united t3wards it; accom. Lord P?,wuEmTOlx, after pausig for a shorb timo to see wlhether any other member wished to address him after Mr. Horsman, said that there could be no doubt as to the Importance of the questiion at issue, and that the Government were as desirous of the sett'lement of it as any gentleman present, and had proved themselves to be so by Introducing a measure to carry out those views in the form most likely, in their opinion, to be passed. That as to Lord John Russell's notice it was Impossible for a Governmeut to promise support to a Bill which they had not seen and of the provisions of which they were ignorant; but they would give all their support to Lord John in the introduction of the Bill of which he had given notice for this evening. As to the future stages of the Bill he must remind the meeting that we were now in the middUe of July, and that Parliament was expected to rise in the middle of August, and that the agreeable morning they passed in the House of Commons last Saturday was a tolerably conclusive proof of the diffliculty they would have in carrying the Bil this session; that in reference to Lord Harrowby, and his abstaining from voting on the division in the House of Lords, it was right to stati that Lord larrowby had entered the Government with aa understanding that he should not be able to support aay Bill for the admission of Jews into Parliament; that Lorl Palmerston was anxious to obtain his assistance and coaoperation, and had not felt it to be possible to secure perfect and complete unaninsity on al points in his Government; that an instance of the difficulty of seeuring that uuanimity was to be found in the Ballet, on which he as well as Lord John lRussell heold strong opinions one way, and so many of their friends and supporters held opinions as strong on the other side ; but there was an expresss understanding that though Lord Hiarrowby could not vote in favour of the admission of the Jews he would not vote against a Govern. ment measure; that, in reference to seating Baron Rothschild by resolution, he could hold out no hope of asquiescence on the part of the Government in any such attempt, as it would be in opposition to a judgment of a court of law, and involve the House of Commons in most unseemly contests with the courts of justice; that as a, matter of tactics ho doubted whether the Bill of Loid J Raussell, if it passed through the House of Commons, would not lose much of its effect by being carried up bv a smaller majority than the Government Bill; that manv circumstances combined to render the majority against the Government in the House of Lords on the last occasion larger than it would otherwise have been, butthe did not despair of the feeling in tine Upper House on the subject undergoing a change. Lord Paluseretun acknowledged the iimportance.of some further pointswhich were suggested to him by Mr. Walter and by Mx. Locke, and promised that they should be considered. The doputation then thanked his Lordship and withdrew. The meeting by adjournment of the members of the lIouse of Commons favourable to the principle of the Parliamentary Oaths Bill was then hold at the King's Arms Hotel, Palace-yard, to receive the report of the deputation to Lord Palmerston.

(Eear,hear.) The absence of that member at the divisiorkwas thus to be accounted for. Lord Palmerston, however, made it to be distinctly understood that there should be no opinion on the part of that one member recorded against the BilL The case was not altogether free from difficulty, but an"thing like impatience or want of unanimity among themselvesmightthreaten anultimate chance of success. He hoped therefore on the present occasion hon. members would confine themselves as much as possible to the immediate course to be taken. Whether, on the rejection of the Bill, they should advise Baron Rothschild to take the oaths in a manner binding on his conscence, or to adopt any other course, was a question not yet to be determined.

Theiaipression with which he had come away fron ffcinteiview with Lord-Palmerston was not atrall unfavourable, because that noble lord disdinctly said that he would support the Bill of Lord J.

Mr. BAss thou1ht there was no possible chance of Lord John Russell's Bi being passed, and that the discussion of t would therefore be an entire waste of time. Mir. ARTox regretted that no authentic report of what occurred at the interview between Lord Palmeraton and the deputation could be obtained. He had received two very oppositeimpressions as to the result of that interview. One was that Lord John R"ussell's Bill was to be strenuously supported by the Government, and the other was that the Bill was to he suffered to lInger on until the close of the session, when no other steps could be taken. Mr. BIGGS thought it would be wel to know what did actually take place at theinterview of the deputation with Lord Palmnerston. Mr. CRAwFoRD.-I move that the Chairman be requested to state what he did say to Lord Palmerston. This motion having been acquiesced in, The CH m 'rT said that, having to make a statement to Lord Palmerston of what ocourred the other day at their meeting, he thought he ought not to trust to his own memory, and he had therefore put in writing what he felt it his duty to state on the occasion, and his Lordshipp was good enough to say that what passed between themn might be made public. The chairman then proceeded to read the statement vhiRh he made on the occasion of the deputation to Lord Palmerston that morning, and which we eive abovo in our report of the proceedings at Cambridge-house.] Those were what he believed to be the sentiments of the meeting last week, and he should be glad to hear whether he bad or had not given an erroneous impression of those sentiments-whether he had expressed them too weal;y or too strongly. He believed they expressed their unanimous opinion. (Hear, hear.) Mr. CoxsmirA thought the conduct of the Hlouse of Commons the other evening gave a very fair indication of what was the intention of the Conservative party, and of the coursb which they meant to take. They could hardly con6eal from themselves the fact that if Lord J. Russell's Bill were to pass the House of Commons it would ba rejected in the House of Lords. He was not satisfied with the explattation of Lord Palmerston in regard to Lord Harrowby withholdinghis vote onthe Jew BilL It showedI a want of resolution and determination on the part of a Liberal Governrment. It was not merely a questionwhether a Jew should take a seat in Parliament, but it involved the great question of civil and religious liberty. Mr. Gixcsi thought the meetig could not determine upon any ulterior proceeding until they knew the course their o nenta would take with regard to Lord John Russell!s Mr They had an united forco with which to go into the field, and they were under the most favourable circum. stances for attempting to get the BiU introduced. It would be time enough to determnine what other course should be taken when they were defeated in that effort. He thought the result of the interview with Lord Palmerston was as favourable as could be expected. Mr. DIrrteaYN entirely concurred inopnion as to the a%solutoKeLessitr-ofthei alcting with pmTect-aznanimity,q this question; but he wished to suggost one alteration in the terms of tho resolution. Instead of saying that it was iuexpedieit to consider their future course until Lord J. lhusseU's Bill should be disposed of, he would sutcgest that the words $' until tke result of to-night's debate is ascertained" should be inserted; for if the resolution were to be passed n its present shape the Bill might be suspended tUl the end of the session, and the advocates of energetic actioLn might be precluded from taking any further steps until next year. MIr. J. Loc assented to the proposed alteration in the terms of his motionl. After a few remarks from Mr. AmYTO'r, the resolution as amended was agreed to, and the meeting adjourned.
ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA. Last night Mademolsello Victoire Bdfe, whose imper. sonation of the somnambulist in Bellien's well-known opera has been recorded, made a second essay, as the heroine of Donizetti's equally familiar Lucia di Lammternwoi, with a result not less flattering to herself and gratifying to her admirers. That one so very young and wholly unaccustomed to the stage should make even a creditable appearance in two parts which havo tried the capabilities of the most renowned dramatic singers of mnodema times is a fact suicienztly remarkable. But Mademoiselle Balfe must not be confounded with the common herd of merely promising aspirants. Her performance of Lucia, like her performance of Amina, claims consideration on account of its extreme artistic finish. There is nothing of the tiro in it; and, whatever time and further attempts may justify us in pronouncing on her physical means, both the feehng and the knowledge of an accomplished vocalist are already so evident in Mademoisele Balfe that the task of a critic disposed to single out good points must be as agreeable a3 that of one whose inclination is rather to animadvert upon defects would be thankless. The audience on the present occasion were charmed with her exertions throughout, and recalled her unanimously after every one of the prominent points. As an example of skilful vocalization, in which genuine style, combined with graceful and fluent execution, was conspicuous, the arduous and trying scene of the third actwhere Luoia, bereft of reason, first indulges in romantic visions of a nuptial alliance with her lover, and then reverts in despair to the fatal contract which has destroyed her happinessforever-was evenmore striking thana theintro. ductory air (" Regnava il silenzio"), cleverly as that was delivered, both from a musical and histrionic poiat of view. The mad scene is frequently orer-sung, if we may employ the term, and the sentiments of the situation-one of the most pathetic imaginable-made entirely subservient to the exhibition of the singer's powers; but Mademoiselle Balfe manages to create a deep impression without any extraordinary display of florid embellishment; and it is only just to add that the music of Donizetti rather gains than loses, and the expression at which it aims is more nearly attained, by this comparatively sparing use of mechanical artHice. The changes which Mademoiselle Balfe introduced were such as the composer himself might have sanctioned, while her ornaments, without being elaborate, were in the best possible taste. We have eeldom, in short, heard the musicof thisaffecting scene more chastelyandcorrectly given. Many other points in Mademoiselle Balfe's performnance were entitled to equal praise; hut we have purposely dwelt upon that passage in the opera which, besides being tho most difficult of execution, is best calculated to show the mental qualflications of the singer. Mademoiselle Balfe's acting was distinguished from first to last by an ease of deportment and an innate gracealmostunprecedentedin one so utterly inxperienced to the boards. Her vocal facility may, in a great measure, be accounted for, since she has beennurtured in the best school of singing; but her apparent contempt of the footlights (which have disconcerted at tho outset so mauy who have afterwards taken rank among the most justly celebrated artists) is a gift from which, if fortune be propitious, great things may be anticipated. Should Mademoiselle Balfe's ambition be equal to her natural aptitude, and her physical strength Improve with the continued exercise of her art, it wiU be strange if in the course of years she does not reach the highest rank in the profession. Signor Neri-Baraldi, who is rapidly advancing in the estimation of the public, sang the music of Edgardo in a manner equaly expressive and unpretending. Signor Graziani in Errico was in a vocal senso the best we have seen for many years; and so greatly delighted were the audience with his air in the first scene that he was loudly summoned at the conclusion. The part of Raimondo (Bide the Bent) has rarely been more efficiently msutained than by M. Zelger.
PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, ToDAy, JulY 21. Tho Lo4tD CHA'CxLrOR took his seat upon the woosck at 5 o'clock. NEW SOUT WALES. The Duke of NEWCASTLE presented a petition from the Legislative Couneilof New South Wales mn Parlament assembled, stating that it was understood to be the intention of Her a esty's Governmernt to detach a portion of the territory of the colony between the 26th and 30th degreesof ltitude, and also some ofthe territory south of the 30ta degree; that there had been rio petitions from a majority of the inhabitant householders of the district to be detached, as required under the existing law; that those inhabitants did not desire such separation; and praying their lordships to refuse their assent to any law by which such a dismemberment was authorized. He wished to ascertain from his noble friend the President of the Couneil -first, what the divi.ion proposed was to be; and, secondly, whether thera was to be any infusion of the convict element into that portion of the colony now forming part of New South Wales, but hereafter to be formed into a new colony. He hoped his noble friend would be able to give a satisfactory asnurance on this point, such a one as would quiet the minds of the petitioners, who, he k-new, felt great anxiety with regard to it. Many of the inhabitants even of Moreton Bay had, he believed, ceased to wish that convcts should be sent there, and though some pronrietors resident in this country might think- their pecuniary in. terests consulted byda continhenc of transportation, be sogeduaer Mase cls Government would take intonconsideration the feelings of the con10ists themsolves on this subject. Earl GRPVILIE (who wVs almost wholly inaudible in the gallerg) was wnderatoed to say thai the boundary line fixe on for &th new colony was about the 28th degree of latinude, a little to the south of Bioren Bay. There was no lntenton of sending any co4victs to tho new colony. The Duke of NEWCAStt E hoped tnat somo conditions would be laid down andt the separation intended woula be so guarded as to preclude any possibility of convicts being received ni future by the inhabitants of tloreton Bay.

LEONARD'S, inprising to draw attention to the meastres proposed for facilitating the transFer of land andptoplay on the table a Bill for simplifying titles to landsaid that every owner of property munst feel deeply interested in the sDbject. WhaS their lordihips where desirous o£ acsoeplishing, so far as he nnderstood it, was to unite the simplicity of tho common law in the transfer of property with the benerts of the complications whbich had been introduced in later times in tho ordinary setUte. monts of property. The problem to be solved was tahether that could be done. Ho believed it would be found quite impossible to avail themselves of comlon law sidplicity of transfer, and at the same time to preserve that powerv hich this beyond all other countrivs enjoyed-r,amely, that of settling properby upon their children, of providing portions for their younger children, of giving powrer to sell, exchange, or leaso that property, and at the same time to retain to themselves (the settlers) the owanership of that propertyhdring ther lirves, withoub any man interfering with that poier. There was no other country which possesednthe samepower; their asno other counotry inwhich a mangconld settle his property upon himself and upon his family, and yet enjoy that property ithont impediment aa ho might enjoy any other estate. lthe qaestion had been put whether, ithehere w ere any incongruity between the marketability, as it was called, of estates and that nrght oi settlement, it should give wray. It WaS said that there was no nmcongruity, anl that even if there were, looking as the rulo of law which required that there shoud be tenants in possesdion to answer the feadal servic, and considering that that was a necessity-requiredmulderithelfeudal law, commerce non required for its own purposes thatthere should alwans be a rearesentative of the fee of every man's estndtnhnaehlorim to car it inttothe market. That idea had been carried sofar that i6 was rdto that's-cents of title should bo as negotiable as a bil of exchange, burt he tersted that no titeto land wotuld cverblipt onthetfooting Thero was an essential distinction bet eean real and persona est_te which it was imnossible to remove. The owner of a quantity of stock, if he required a sum of money for a given prpose, had only to sell a port oE his stock ; whereas the owner of real estate could not erL offa part of the property, but must raise what money ho wanted by mortgageo upon ths whole of the esta te. I the case of lnd, therefore, as the owner went on botroswing tho encumbrances in creased, and tho difficlroties of transfer necessarily increased with them. If, then, they anreserved to the owners of land the power of dealing with at in the smaner ho had described, it was impossible the coauld extend to Land the same facilities for imyediate and simplo transfer as existed in regard to the sale of stockfor sharer. The common las applicable to this subject was simplicity It-self. No land could be transferred at common law without a eharter of enfranchisement and the attornment of the tenant. Having described the formalities incident to the delivery of seisin, the noble and learned lord referred to the eipechents formerly adopted by those who wishedto dipose of their land secretlyand not tomie their titles pblic. Tho practice grew up of leaving the legal right to an estate in the hands of one man and the beneficial interest in the hands of ar other. Henco the doytrine of nses. To meet the evils which this system engendere. a statute was pcassed in the reign of Honry VIIL. to restore the prsnciple of common law, end it was alsoprovided that afhere one man was seised forbthe ose of anoer the seisinxoE tho man so seised should go to the person who had the nse. Another Act was passed requilring all bargains and sales to be enroDild. The intention of this was to have aolegalqtenan only, and to arlow the property to bo ransferred solely by deed. But this statute, however wisely designed, literahly fel to the ground, and by an ingenious contrivacce it had no other operation than rs a sim ple mode of conveyance. What were in old times caled u ses became the same astrusts, and eqitexecuted those trnsts wohichacould t ot have effect given to them by lar as tustceso y statntos were passed in the reign of Elizabeth to protect purchasers frorm fraudulent deeds. So great hash the anxiety of men to secure their right to their landed possess.ons, that in order to obtain a good title it was once not an uncommon thing for a p~erson to raise an action at law with a viev to bring has title before a couat, and then to conpromiae the matter dith his antagonist. The plan of levying fues ltsed also to be a great protection to purchasers, because every man having a present or futuire right must claim it wtthin five years or be debarred from it for ever. Howevor, the system of fines had been swvept away by legislation. The protection afforded by terms of nears had beenx also removed, as it led to expense in conveyancing and on sales, and in other respects caused great difiiculty and dissatisfaction. The courts of equsty had established a rule very conducive to honcst dealing, but which led to great difiTculty -viz., the doctrine of nOtice. If a mean had notice of an equit3ble right at the time of purchasing an estate, he was not to be defended against that right. Where a notice was express, few would desire to see tho lawv altered, But the court of equity had held that an implied notice wgas just as powverful as an express notice, and he could give their lordships many instances of the injurious extent to which the doctrine of implied notice was sometimes carried against a purchaser. The legnl difficulty that pressed mnost heavily upon purchasers wass the posvibility of concealed settlements. From his large ex. rceilece, how7ever, he could say with conaidence that a concealed settlemnent very rarely occurred, and yet to guard against such eases great and permarcent injury was sometimes inUlicted. Then, if a suit in equity were pending relative to an estate at the time of its itrcuhase, tho purchaser, although he might not know of the srit, was bound by everything that took place in that suit, upon the ground that everyman was supposed to know what was talkig place in a coutrt of justice. The expense of making out a title to land proceeded in a great degree from the circumstance that men wero indisposed to nlaCe confidence in the respectable legal advisers by whom auiabstract of title might but a few monthspreViiously have been furnished to the person from whom the purchase was about to bie made. If men were to place more reliance upon tho abstract thus pre ared for the party by whom the sale was effected they would be under no necessity of consulting legal advisers of their own,and a considerable outlay would thus be avoided. Ho mightadd that he himself, acting upon that principle, had sold several lots of Land with respect to wlich he had declined to enter into any contract for title withthe purchasers, and had simply presented them with the abstractof title which he himself had originally obtained, and on tho faith of which he had purchased the pro- perty. Butitiwas urged thattherenmightbe concealedencumbrances towhich lands were liable, and in order to obviate the injustice to which the want of knowledge that such encumbrances existed mighlt give rise it had frequently been proposed that a sys'em of genera reglstration should be adopted. The promoters of that sohemne, however, had never beon able to carry Itinto effect, and he must, for his own part, say, tit any Euch plan would be likely to bo productive of much greater mischief and oxpense than the law even as it now stood. Tlhe subject was one which a cosinission had been appoited. to consider and, if he were at all disposed to' object to the recoimmenations which were embpdied in the report of that commission, he bgg&d at the same time to assuro their lordships that nobody could entertain a higher respect for its miemnbers, of whom his right hen, friend (Mrr. Walpole) was at the head, or for thxe abiity and learning by which the re- port was characterized. That reportadvocated theadoption of what was called a register of titlee, under the operation of which s3stem it wat provided thatthere should1 bo alrays UpOn the register of lands a registered owner, who was to havo the power of elling or mortgaegng the estate. Now, - person wishing to have ispnamet edpon tho re ter, n accordanoe with the plan which le had ju6t mentioned, but who did: not feel satisried withbhis title and vwas anxious to secure it, would be enabled to do Eo by mems of An officer of the. Crown,who, would be(empeowaed i0 1nimin. oito the title, and, if he consdered it to hocorrect, to in5'are 2t. He (Lord St. Leonard's), however, should 4olitond that it waa extromely. ner eent tot the Cropwn, through its officer, should be a le' to he tro alo l hi 4itlemts propertteupon that which, after.r ald, copald amoout order to guard ag than an t pscwr statement. The tad b tLeneprt in that respectwouldbh at npnthe ease where an estate had been thus insured a rightful owner to it might appear; but, as the Crown had already Insured it toanother eron, tha tperson wohld keep thedestate s d prchaser, aor the real owner would o or ompensat d,hin aoney. Now, that that wa a systemn which in certainly could not approve. Another efrect of the propoal of the cont- yishaoners would be to strike at the rob of all dettlements for famiy purposes; for, from the very nature of theo case, nO settlement could ever had a place on the registr6y In order to guard against forudulent ales a system of caveat ad been invented, by which the person who was put apon the registry might ho prohibited from actinag as owner of the propery until the caveat bad been dionsed of, either by order o the Court of Chancery or in some other wby; but the reslt of such a dsom would e, in t everYs caue of settlement to pars in the- aid of the Cortin of Chancery, thereby greatly addingw to the expe ns. The real hisory of tho transaction was that, bn order to render land saleable withia great fcility as stock or railway shAres, it was proposed to sarifice all the advantages derived from the power of making famlly soettlements. Again, in additionto its being imposible to include settlemnents in reIstration%s the ifect of the registration would le to ftke away the authority of exercising powers created under the settlemnent, for if tha whole fe-e simple of An estate was vested in the person who was registered it was Impossible that any one else could conourrently claim the exerisne of any powers connectod with that esata by mettle. ment. Surch a sstem, also, would prevent persons purchasing lands for purpomse of speculation as tenants is common, or the registrar would say that there cust he no divistion, and the land aust he held subject to mrvivorship. The report o efeth ecommitsioners thid beelaidr before Poar lnet,and hisme noleoan lro earned friexpand (Lor Brougorn bof nroue a Bill whihow tor fa certain extent carriand outproceeing to expdin an o me ent t upon nthpssbe proisiponsto this Bil, wthncray Lord CADPBELL aggosted, that It would be better to wait until the Bill wa explained by its author in moving its second reading. lord BROUGHAM was much enttered &hat his noble and learned friend should take the trouble'to explain his Bill, to whiochhe would, no doubt, except in one partueslar, do more 1antic thanhe couladhimpelf. The only objection was that is nofble friend would accompany Bis explaontion with an answer at each step, and it would be mnost inconvenient if he (Lorld Broughan) were to get up and reply to his noblo friend's account of his Bi hi. lord ST. LEO0NARD'S was understood to accede to the suggestion of the noble and leaned lord and to desist from any further reference to this measure. The nobls and lerned lord pioceeded to explrin the provisions of a Bill of his own for facilitating the sale and purchase of land, which he concluded by aing on the table, but in so inaudible a tone that it was not postible to repoto them with accuracy. The LORD Ct AXCELLOR said, there was no member of their lordships. House more entitlea than his noble and leared friend to call attfetion to this very itportant and very difficult s abject. Witho au branches of the law, but more especially with thi., he was pre-eminently cornversant, and their lordships and the country owed him a deep dehi of gratitude for laying this Bill upon the table. Having raid thus much, he (the Lord Chancelor) hoped his noble and learned friend would not think him wanting in courtesy if he did not presumae or pretend to givo any opiion upox the details of the measur. To tell the truth, he could notn disinctly follow his noble and learned friend; ohut, indtpenderntly of this, it was usual among their lordships todiscuss Bills of this description upon a future stage, when miore time hod been given for consideration ad theyswere, better able to form an opinion on their contents. He should step here if itwere not for th, allusions made to the report of the Royal Commison, pon -which subject he thought there av somtionttle minderstanding on the parf. of his noble and learned friend. It would be recollected t-hat in 1853, very soon sf1-er be had had the honour of receiving the greatseal, he brought in a Bill for the Ptegistrationof Assuraeces. That bcil was much discussed by their lordships; it was opposed by his noble and learned friend, hut ultimately went down to the other House, wher it was corefred to a select committee, who thouight the subject of such importance that they recoimended the appointment of a ROYal Comiasgsio to inquire int the whole subject of registration of titles. Therecommendation was tholght by thea Government to ho areasonable one, and a commissionL was therefore issued. The verylearnedpersonsofb homritwascomposaed directed their attention to this subject from the beinning of 1851 until the busy time of the present year, wen. they made their report. Upon roceiving this report, he -was not ashamed to say that, although he read it through, he could not consistently with his -other avoations, pretendd to make himself mister of its 'netails or of ith various harinngs; and he sanid 'tat if anything was done vith regard to so complh cated a subject it must ho in another session of Parliament. lacrns whics report weas cna rge he h rpfsmcd tho.hbis of a measure extremely sumall-vfith referceni to the subject considered by the committee, hut which he thought would lead to extremely benefuca results. One of the great ima pediments in the way of the transfer of land arosf from previous mortgages or transfers made-secret transactions of which the purchaser coLutl not easily become cognizant. His Bil had for its first object to replace t-he - complicated form of modemrn ortgage by a simple deed received by the lender from tsh borrower something to this effect :-"s I ave borroweid 5,koO., which isto be repaid on such and such a day, with such and such interest, and fs -to be charged in favour of the lender upon such andl such lands," describing tbem as shortly as possible. Then, in order that no oan cu might lend his money uponf lands which were already charged, he proposed thak, inlieu of the cumbrous machinery of a regiathoffice, theser charges should be in the simplest possibfl form registered in the Court of Common leas, where judgments were now registered. Then he roposed that judgments as a seenrity upo land should in fluture be done away with; anybody whon wanted1 security would tak-e it in the form of one of' the mortgages he had descibed; and the mortggee hwould haVe the ptowr to sell the l ond just as the person who had made the mortgage. This was certainly a simple measure as compared with the large scheme contemplated by the commision, and he did not like to uly it before ther lord sdips pending the considerationiof te report, or until it was seen whether anything was to be done with respect to that renora. On tis subject he thou-ght his noble fhiend was mistaken as to what had occurred in the othr Houase of Parliament. He did not mean to sty that the Government might not in the next session of Parliament act upon tho reporu of the commission, though they would not bejotLtified in doing this until it was better understood,. Long before the commioners made their report he had a cominunication with one or two of them, and stated that he thought their report would be extremely imperfect and of very little value unless it were coupled with ail to show how their report could ho carried into practical effect. And tberfore he hoad no doubtthat the apnmoucemnent of his hon. and leared friend the Attomrney-Gneral in the other House of Pakrlament referred to that. BI. He thought that it was etremi ely proper that the Attorney-General, not so much as the organ o tho Governl ent as of thet commission, should lay upon the table of the House a Bill, by way o appendage to the report, showing how it could be carried into effect. Thart was all that he knew of any Bill which had been introduced by the Attorney-General on this subect. He did not profess to folow his noble and learned friend throu3ghoutehis vy*e ablegstatement. It was of great importance thait their lardships should discuss the subject, but he did not feel that be could dormore at the present moment than expreas bis th,anks to his noble and learned friend for the pains he had tlaen in framing a measure which he (the Lord Chanecelor) trused might prove to be a useful measure, or which might at al events Serve as a useful isuggestion -in some -futuxre eession of Parliament.. He would therefore simply confine himself to putting the question that the Bill be now read a first tisne. After a few words from Lord BRtOUGEux~i, merely by way of explanation, Lord CAMdPBELL said he would content himself by entering his protest against what his noble andl learned friend had sad against a general systema of regfistry. (Hear, bear.) He entirely agreea with his noble and learned mend hane unless at could be shown to be profitable to the landed interest tbe question of a general registry ought not to be debated; but, instead of its being a burden upon the land, his belief was that it would be one of the gieatest reliefs to it. (Hear, hear.) It would simplify the transfer of property beyond conception. It had answered well in Scotland, in the colonies, an in every countryin whichbthe experimenthad een made. (Hear.) In no ountry where there had once been a registry esta. blished had it baen ahandoned. His firm belief still was, that until they re30r,ted to that they could not lay a foundat;ion forthe improvement of the law of real property. The Bill wasthon read a first tune, SA.LOIONIS V. MILLER. THE RLIGHT OF JEWS TO SIT IN PARILTA- MENT. Lord CA2'PBELL thenrostotput aquestion to the Lord Chancellor with rospect to the cause in error, " Salomons v. Miller," now pending in their lordshipsg House, and to draw attention to the present state of the question whether Jews, according to the existing state of the law, were entitled to sit in Parliament. He said,-Mly Lords, I rise, in pursuanc of- the notice that I gave of my intention, to ask my noble and Ilarned friend on the woolsack what is tho present state of an appeal of very great imporance which has been pendiDg for somo years in your lordslaies' House-namely, the appeal of " Salomons v.

It is opo of great importauce, beeause upox it depends this most important and interestingquestion-whotheraccordingtotho existing state of the law of England Jews may lawfuly sit in Parliament.

I HOUSE OF COMMONS, TUEsDAY, JuLY 21. The SrEA1Rm took the chair at 12 o'clock. llUNTIlTGDON ELECTION COMMITTEE. The members selected to try the merits of the petition agin st the return for the county of Huntingdon having been called to the tablo to be sworn, The SPEAXE intimated that he had received a letter from Mr. Wagstaffe, the solicitor to Mr. Joseph Locke, one of the members who had been selected to servo upon this committee, stating that the hon. member was suffering severely fromill-health, sand that, acting upon the advice of his medical adviser, ho haid quitted this country for Alx-laCbapelle, where he was at present staying for the use of the mineral springs, from which he had on a previous occasion obtained great benefit. Mr. Locke had never perfectly recovered from the severe railway accident which he had ex. perienced some time since, but he had acted as chairman of one committee in the present session, and he had nob ventured to leave England until he had reason to believe that his attendance would not be required upon any other select committee. The letter added that Mrs. Locke was oven in a mnore pecarious state of health than her husband, and that if Mr. Locke were well enough to return to this zountry he could not without great risk leave Mrs. Locke at Aix-laChapelie. Mr. BASS, on behalf of the hon. member for Honiton, confirmed the facts contained in the letter vbich had been addressed to the Speaker, and moved that Mr. Wagstaffe be called to the bar, and examined by the House. Mr. Wagstaffe, solicitor, of Great George-street, was then called to the bar, and detailed 'vi nioce the various statements in his letter. Mr. WALPOLE, as chairman of the Committee of Selection, thought that tho excuse which had been given for the non-attendance of Mr. Locke was sufficient, and suggest-d that, in accordance with the precedent set the other day, a motion should be made for dispensing with the attendance of that hon. gentleman, whose absence he very sincerely regretted. Colonel PATTEN then moved, " that, in tho opinion of the House, sufficient cause has been shown why the attendance ofJosoeph Locke, Esq., upon the Huntingdon election committee should be dispensed with." The motion was unanimously agreed to, and a new committee will have to be struck. BERWICKEUPON-TWEED ELECTION. The SPEAKER stated that he had received a letter from Mr. Weatherhead, as agent to Mr. C. W. Gordon, intimating that It was not his intention to proceed with the etition aainst the return of Messrs. Stapleton andllarjori. banks for the above borough. BANKING BILL. On the motion for going into committee upon this Bill, Mr. HEADLAM appealed to his right hon. friend the Vice-President of the Board of Trade not to proceed with it at that time. It was a measure of the very highest importance, as affecting the cormnmercial classes, and he was surprised that it should have been fixed for a morning sitting. The a pearance of the House afforded a sufricient reason why a mR1 of this nature should not at that hour be proceeded with. He very much doubted if there were members enough present to constitute a legal Hoiise, and he must askr his right hon, friend to defer the Bill for the present. The second reading had been taken at a late hour of the night, when it -was impossible to discuss the principle of the measure, and it was not likely that they could give to It the consideration which it deserved in the then state of the H3ouse. Mr. mADe imLD concurred in requesting that the Bil should be pestponed. He had received a letter Fogned by very bank in heffield strongly urging that it should be deferred for another session. hte asared his right hon, friend that this was no factious opposition, hut his constituents felt t'hat Important principles were Involved in the question, which they feared would be endangered by hasty legislation. Mr. Kwo-GAicE, Mr. H.L B. SHs~miDA, and Mr. SAns. nviey also joined In asking the right hon. gentleman not to proceed with the BRil in the present session. Mr. LOWE said that the numerous appeals which had been made to him afforded a vrery good illustration of a practice which a popular writer had described to bie. extremely prevalent-" how not to do it." (A laugh.) He reminded his hon. and learned friend the member for Newcastle that ho had introduced the Bill at an early hour, and that both upon that occasion and on the second reading his hon. and learned frienu had not found it convenient to attend, and that to postpone the measure now, even for a brief penod, would be practically to postpone it for the remainder of the session. The BiU da bee mted on t,he 25th of June, and it was now the 21st of July, and he thought that ample time therefore had been afforded for its consideration by those who were interested in the subject. The London and country joint-stock banks and the Scotch banks bad considered the measure very carefully, and their suggestions had been for the most part embodied in the amended Bill. He assured the House tbat if he did not consider the measure to be one of great practical importance and to be earnestly required he should not preES it upon their attention; but although the constituents of the hon. member for Sheffield might be satisfied with the law of banking as it stood, he did not believe that the country was satisfied with it. The object of the Bill was to improve the mode of winding up joint-stock banks, and to prevent the recurrence of sach disastrous consequences as had taken place in the case of the Royal British Bank recently. The 3matter was a very important and serious one, and he thought that he should be smenable to the charge of neglecting his duty if he con. sented to postpone such a BiU upon the vague and general assurance that gentlemen had not had time to consider it. Under the circumstances he certainly would not take upon himself the responsibility of perpetuating the present system of winding up banks, bywhich law, equity, and bankruptcy were all let looEe upon the unfortunate creditors at once. (Hear, hear.) He must therefore press the motion for pro. ceeding with the Bill (Hear, hear.) Mr. GLYN admittedthat the Bil in its amended shape was calculated to remove many of the objections which had been entertained to it in its original form; but he must express his surprise that the 12th clause was stil retained becanse his right hon. friend surely could not intend t enact that seven individuals, vith a subscription of 3501., should be enabled to start a joint-stock ban and to enjoy therefrom all the status in society and all the advantages which a joint-stock bank enjoyed. He thought that the Contt of Bankruptcy was the proper tribunal for winding up concerns of this description. The officers of that court collected and distributed the assets speedily, and he contended that it was better qualified by its machinery for the adjudication of matters of this de. serinption than the court of equity, or any other existing tribunal. On the whole, he should be glad if his right hon. friend would delay the Bill for another year, in order to afford further time for the consideration of this important subject. He would also suggest to his right hon. friend, as Parliament had long legislated for the benefit of joint-stock banks, that private banks were also entitled to some consideration. At present private banks were not allowed to consist of more than six partners, and they were thus prevented from strengthening themselves by adding to their numbers, however desirable such a step might be. He did not wish to admit an unlimited number of partners into private banks, but he thought that those establishments, vwhich were no doubt a great convenience to the public, should have the power of increasing the number of their partners to 10 or 12. (Hear, hear.) This was a subject which had long and anxiously engaged the attention of the late Mr. Freehfield, and he hoped that the day was not far distant when some beneficar legislation with respect to private banks would be undertaken. (Hear, hear.) The House then went into committee on the Bil, and clauses I and 2 were agreed to. On clause 3, which provided that the second section of the Joint-stock Companies Act, 1856, should be repealed, so far as related to persons associated together for the purpose of banking, subject to this proviso, that no existing or future banking company should be registered as a limited company, Mr. HEADLAM moved the omission of the proviso, for thepurpose of raising the general question as to whether banking companies should or shonldnot hereafter be canable of being registered as limited companies. The hon and learned member, after stating that he could not consent to adopt the opinion of a House consisting of about 30 members as conclusive upon a subject of this importance, proceeded to remark that the principle of limited liability had now been generally adopted in the commercial relations of this country, and that experience, so far as it had gone, had justified its ado tion in all those establishments to which it had been applied. The question, then, now arose whether there was any sufficient reason why a special and peculiar exception should be made with reference to joint-stock banks. It was a mistake to suppose that unlimited liability had originated in any desire to protect the public, it having been introduced solely on account of private and selfish interests. Previously to 1826 there was only one bank in this country which was based upon the principle of limited liability, and that one was the Bank of England, every other bank throughout the kingdom being based on unlimited liability. The Bank of England posses6ed no other advantage at that time which was not common to every other bank, but while the Bank of England with limited liability throve and prospered many of the other banks, with unlimited liability, broke and fell in the commercial panio of 1825. These occurrences naturaUy excited great attention at the time, and Lord Aehburton, then Mr. Baring, v:ho was anxious to promote the prosperity of joint-stook banks, proposed to enable private individnals to associate together in the establishment of banks on the principle of limited liability. Mr. Huskisson upon that occasion admitted that it would no doubt be a great improvement if under a proper system, chartered banks were establishea on the principle of limited liability; but the Bank of England, animated by anything rather than a desire for the prosperity of those competitive institutions, opposed the application of this rivilege to other banks, and consequently the principle ofuriimited liabilitv witl respect to them was still retained. Subsequently, in 1833, 1xponthe expiration of the charter of the Bank of England, Lord Althorp, who was then Chancelor of the Exchequer, proposed, in the case of joint-stock banks not issuing their own notes, that the shares should not be less than 1001. each, and that the partners should be liable and responsible only for the amount of their respective shares. That was the proposition which Lord Althorp made in 1833 in the interest of the public at large, but the noble lord did not persevere with it, avowedly on account of the strenuous opposition of the Bank of England. To show how the principle of unlimited liability operated, it might be suffi. cient to refer to the history of the British Bank, of the Tipperary Bank, and of many others which had failed be ore, in all cases spreading devastation and ruin over the districts where the failures had occurred. In the first place he contended that the direct tendency of the law was to lower the character of the shareholders and directors in such establishments. (Hear, hear.) He perfectly admitted that there were joint-stock banks as well and respectably managed, and numbering as honourable men among their directory and proprietary, as it was possible to have; but he maintained that the tendency of the law was to lower the class of shareholders and directors, because men of wealth would be chary before they staked their all in such undertakings. (Hear, bear.) It would be found, as a general rule, that very earl after the establishment of these banks with unlimited liability a large portion of the paid-up capital was frittered away. If the company were limited it would have no credit other than attached to its good man. agement and to its paid-up capital, so that if failure occurred the loss would bE a ast loss, and the evil resulting from it would not be so wide-spread as otherwise; but a bank with unlimited liability possessed analtogether fictitious amount of credit arising from the fact that every shareholder was liable to the full amount of his fortune, and these banks were thus enabled for years before the final crash came to liveuponfalseand fictitious credit. In order to maintain this credit, they were compelled to pay dividends to justify the position which they occupied in the eyes of the world; and so they went on, sinking from year to year, but stilpaying dividends, until the question at last arose whether they must not stop and cease to continue any longer. What, in such cases, was the course pursued by those who wished to save the bank from destruction? Suppose an honest shareholder proposed a call upon the proprietary; if he succeeded, and a large sum were thus raised, the establishment might surmount the difficulty for a time; but if he failed the fimal destraction of the bank would only be accelerated. He contended, then, that the tendency of this practice of unlimited liability was to give to banks so established the opportunity of spending their capital in the first instance, to continue to them a fictitious credit which ought not to exist after the capital was spent, to hold out inducements for the payment of dividends when they were in a state of utter ruin, and to offer direct premiums to all directors not to attempt to resuscitate the establieshment with which they were connected, but to endeavour to get out of it as fast as they could. (Hear.) Moreover, the Government had adopted the principle of limited liabilityGwith respet to colonial banks, and he thought thatthat probablyaffordedoneof the strongestreasons why the principle should be universally adopted. He could not conceive any social evils more serions and more wide-spread than those which resulted from the failure of such institutions as the British Bank and the TipperaryBank. It was little satisfaction to reflect that the creditors might ultimately be paid; for the shareholders and creditors were persons Very much in the samne class of hfe, and it was poor compensation indeed to be told that aiter years of suffering and misery 20s. in the pound was extracted from the small tradesman who had invested his littlE capital in the shares of a bank of this description. (Hear, hear.) We had the Bank of England, three chartered banks In Scotland, and all the commercial establishments in this country conducted on the principle of limited liability. There was, moreover, the authority of the names which he had referred' to_, a_n d_t_he_re w_a_s-the experience of the circumstances which he had related in favour of that principle, and he asked upon what ground banksalone were to be excluded from the advantage of its application to commercial enterprises generally? (Hear, hear.) Mr. T. T. BERNARD, as the holder of 300 shares in the London and County Joint-Stock Bank, supported the amendment, and thought that the folly and inutility of the system of unlimited liability had been sufficiently illustrated by the example of the Royal British Bank. He maintained that few measures better calculated to insure the safety of the public could be devised than the extension of the prin. ciple of limited liability to joint-stock banks and the enabling of private banks to double the number of their partners. Mr. HASTIE supported the clause, and expressed his surprise that the hon. member for Newcastle, who had devoted so much time and attention to the subject, had not presentedthem with some more practicalargumentsthan ne had done in favour of the amendment which he had proposed. He (Mr. Hastie) contended that to adopt imited ba ty in the case of joint-stock banks would be to intro. duce into banking one of the most dangerous elements which I had ever been introduced into the commercial regula. tions of this country. It was notorious in every depart. ment of commerce that when a man's risk was limited he was inclinee to go to the full extent of his tether, and he believed that nothing would be so calculated to promote speculation as the introduction of limited liability. The hon. and learned gentlemau had endeavoured to illustrate his arguments by a reference to the British Bank, bat he had failed to show how limited liability would have saved that establishment; and he (Mr Hastie) was satisfied that, so far from saving that bank, it would only have provided additional inducement to the directors to enter upon a wider field of speculation in the hope of retrieving their misfortunes. In new countries, where it was deemed desirable to induce persons to invest theircapitalia joint. stock banks, limited liability no doubt might be suggested I think that we ought not, In any case where the construc. tion of the law is subject even to a reasonable doubt, to expose ourselves to the consequences of hazarding a particular interpretation. (Eear, hear.) My hon. friend says the only difficulty he can see is that aron Rothschild him. self would be subjected to penalties, and this, he thinks would be a matter for the recipient himsolf to consider and dispose of. Sir, I oannot agree with my hon. frienid in that opinion. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me that if by resolution we admit a gentleman to a seat in this House we must defend that gentleman at aU costs and at all hazards against the consequences to which he may expose himself through a rellance-ittmight prove to be an fin-judged reliance-upontheassurance whichhad been conveyed to him of our power. (Hear, hear.) But my hon. friend, feeling perhaps that nothing could be moro indecorous than tho spectacle of an esninent gentleman suffering in a court of justice for acts done by the authority of the House of Commons, said we might, after all, introduce a Bill of indemnity for the purpose of shielding Baron Rothschild from these penalties. If, however, we introduce such a Bill, we are exactly In the same difficuly (whatever the amount of that difficulty may be) as we have now to encounter in the propossl of my noble friend. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me too probable that if by resolution we were to admit Baron Rothschild to-night we might find that considerations of prudence would require us to introduce to-morrow a Bill of indemnity to defend him from penalties. (Hear.) Therefore, Sir,both becauseIam not satisfied as to the constitutionalpower of this House to proceed by resolutiona matter which ought, I think, to be reserved for fature consideration (hear)-and because I believe our power of resorting to such a course has been materially damaged by the measures of an opposite description which we have adopted on former occasions, I am unwiling to take a step which would probably end by involving is in that very legislative contest which is so much deprecated. (Hear, hear.) I come now to the proposal of my noble friend, and I have to ask whether that proposal is open to the objections which have been urged against its principle. Is it a repetition-insulting, as it might be called, if we adopted the language of Mr. Hume-is it a repetition, in substance, of the proposal made to the House of Lords once already, and by tuem once already rejected ? Here, undoubtedly, it becomes most material that we should understand what the proposal is. The vote to bo given by Her Majesty's Government, and the snDport they accord to my noble friend, is apparently a conditional support, not accompanied, even when viewed on its most favourable side, by any very encouraging promises of future facilities ("Hear," and laughter), but which, on the other hand, vwhen viewed on its unfavourable side, may be converted, when the provisions of my noble frrend's Bild are distinctly known, into positive opposition. (Hear, hear.) I wiU therefore venture to state my construction of my noble friend's proposal, and then I shall connect with it the vote which I personally intend to give. Although I admit that it is not a case wholly devoid of gravity when a succession of Bills which have passed this House are rejected by the other House of Parliament, I confess I do not think the case before us is one of such gravity as would justify us in departing from the usage of Parliament, and in setting at naught the various considerations of prudenco and constitutional propriety which sustain that usage, in order to send up to the Ho use of Lords a substantial repetition of the proposal already made once during the present session. If, however, I understand aright the proposal of my noble friend, that Is not to bo the character of the pian which he submits. I do not now refer simply to the fact that the Bill passed a short time ago dealt with other matters besides the admission to Parliament of certain persons now excluded. The alteration of the oath of abjuration and the omission of the words " upon the true faith of a Christian" for all members of this Houso were undoubtedly material parts of that Bill, but they were notessential parts of it, and it was not on account of those provisions that the measure was rejected in the House of Lords. Without minute arguinentation I think we may safely assume that the reason for its rejection was that it proposed to remove exclusion from Parliament upon religious grounds altogether from oiur statute-book. I should have been sorry to see a similar proposal repeated at the present moment. But my noble friend has, if I understand him aright, thought that upon the one hand something might be due to the decision of the mijority of the House of Lords, and that upon the other hand something was due, not only to the constituency which he represents, butto the opmions expressed by so large a majority of the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) If I understand the plan of my noble friend, ho does not propose by the measure we are now discussing to confer upon those who are at present excluded from Parliament upon religious grounds a right to challenge admission into each House of Parliament by a modification of the oaths; but he proposes that it shall lie in the discretion of the body which is called upon to administer tho oath to administer it, if they shall thlnk fit, in such a form as shall be binding on the conscience of theopereon taking it. (Rear.) The distinction between these two mnodes of proceeding is most important. The first is a complete legislative solution cf the question, systematic in theory and thoroughly log'ical; the second is, undoubtedly, only a partial solution. The practical effect of the second, I approhend, will be that if my noble friend succeeds in carrying his Bill Baron Rothschild will presoat himEelf at the table, and this House, as the authority which is empowered to administer the oath, wiUl administer it to inm,;or to any other person not able to pronounce the words " on the true faith of a Christian, " in the form in which it would be binding in his conscience. On the other hand, if this House were otherwise minded,it would be in its power not to administertho oath in that form; and if the Houscof Lords be otherwise minded, and if any peer now sitting there should unhappily (I may say so without offence) embrace the Jewish persuasion (a laugh), and should present himself to take the oath hi aforus N~d^pc tv the JuwiDh cvuostence, thet House of Lords would bo free to refuse that permission and adverting to the present state of sentiment in that assesbly it is no audacious sunposition to believe that siich permission would be ref . (" Hear," and a laugh.) T'lhis is no doubt a compromise, but is it a very unfair compromiso ? Has it not this recommendation ? In the first place, it is not a repetition of the proposition that has been an ado to the House of Lords and by the House of Lords rejected. If it bo in substance a material and essential variaTien from that proposition-a material and essential contraction of that proposition-why then, I say, there is not that constitutional objection to our making a now propoition to the House of Lords during the present session wbich perhaps might be fairly urged if the same proposition were about to he renewed. (Elear, hear.) And then, although it may not immediately attain the whole of what my noble friend considers to be due by justice to certain classes of Her MVajesty's subjects now excluded from Parliament, yet surely it is no smal merit in such a plan that it at least meets a most pressing and partieular case. It solves the whole difficulty. It romoves the whole of that scandal which arises when we see the nmachinery of our government disturbed and dislocated by the repeated return to this House from the principal consti. tuency of the empire of a gentleman who by the state of tho law is now precluded from taking the oath at that tablo. All collision between the constituencies and the House of Commons and between the constituencies and the law would at oneo be put an end to. The Jews, aud, with the Jews, thoso who are in a similar condition to tho Jews, would at once attain, if not the whole, yet by far the greatest part of the object they have in viow-namely, the power of sitting by authority of law in the HEuse of Commons as representatives of the people. Now, Sir, in venturing to sta'o the constraction that I put on the proposition of my noble friend, of course I have no title to pretend to do any such thing with authority. Bat 1 have stated it as I understand it, becausc my opinion, if suoh be the proposition he intends to make, is that, as itis a proposition which meetsthedifflcultiesof thecase, we may, not unfairly, entertain it. (Hear.) It is a proposition wbich, without making undue demands upon the patience of the House of Lords, and without the slightest detriment to the independence of the House of Lords, will, although not logically complete, practically gain by far the greatest portion of that which we have in view. And I must say, therefore, that I cannot but think that my noble friend the member for the city of London, whatever may be said of the character of the plan,-and his plan is not usual, because the circumstances that give rise toit are not usual-in proposing a measure of this kind to meetthe difficulties of tho case-the ights of the two Houses of Parliament, the rights of the constituency of the city of London, and the desirableness of avoiding any shock or collision between the constituted authorities of the country-is entitled upon the whole to a favourable reception of thatmeasure. (Cheers and laughter.) It is not open to the constitutional objections that might have been urged against a larger measure, and acting in conformity with the opihions which I have expressed I shall give it my8support. (Cheer8 ) Mlir. WVHITESIDE said It wva8 very much to be regretted that the noble lord the member for the city of London did not himself expound his own measure (laughter), and it wS a matter of congratulation to the House that one gentleman bad appeared who professed clearly to understand it. (Laughter.) But if the exposition which had been given of the Bill wero correct, and if he rightly understood the description given of it by the right hon. gentleman who had just spoken, with the most sincere admiration of his abilities and the utmost respect for his opinion he must say that of all the measures ever yet submitted to Parliament this was one of the most unprecedented and unconstitutionaL (Hear, hear.) Tho noble lord at the head of tho Government said ho did not clearly understand this measure as explained by the noble lord the member for the city of London, and he (Mr. Whuteside) must confess he was in the same pro. dicament. (Hfear, hear.) He did not aocurately understand the measure proposed by the noble lord, but he did accurately understand what had been just said by the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford. And what was the mode by which the right hon. gentleman said all the difficulties would bo Eolved, all questions removed, the scruples of the House of Lords obviated, and by which harmony and peacer would take the place of dispute and discord? Why, this Bill, which the nght hon. gentleman undertook to expound, wras to operate in this oxtraordinary manner:-E it were carried-which it never would be (laughter)-the House was to be the authority which 'was to have the power to say in what mode tho oath was to be administered. The House being that authority might direct its officers St the table to administer that oath in such a way as, at the particular time at which the House gave that direction, the House might think that the oath ought to be administered. (Hear, hear.) If, therefore, a Quaker desired to take a seat in that House after his election they might direct the oath to be administeredin such a form as to admit him, and if a Jew appeared they miight direct the oath to be administored in such a form as to admit him; and it the House should change its mind betwoeep that and the next session of Parliament, It would have full power to direct the clerk to ad. minister the oath in such manner as might rejeot him. (Laughter.) That, as he understood it, then, was not a scheme to clear away all the difriculties, A man was to be a member of Parliament, or was not to be a mom. her of rarliament, not according to the fixed law of the land, or according to the principles of the constitution as they were settled by statute or by us6age, hut according to the particular order or direction that, under this extraordi. pary Bill5 wlwn it Wl,5 gaa(d1d th§ HQILe might Ft any par. ticular time give to its officers to administer the oath. (Hear, hear.) Why, he was surprised-not, he confessed, at the Ingenuity of the right hon. gentleman (laughter), that was, supposing he had discovered the mystery of the noble lord's Bill (laughter), and that his exposition of it vas correct-but ho was suprised at his assertion that be had made it more plain than before. He (Mr. Whiteside) thought the Bill was more mysterious now than it ever was. (Laughter.) He wished to know whether the noble lord the member for the city of London meant to lay down this as a constitutional doetrine that this gentleman wbo was elected a member of Parliament for London might sit in the House at one time and be prevented from sitting in the House at another time according to tho variable determination of the House as to the mode inwhich a particular oath was to be administered? (Hear, hear.) He submitted to tho good sense of the House that, if that were the exposition of the noble lord's Bill, it would be vory difficult for the Honse, notwithstanding its respect for the noble lord and its anxiety to give him an opportunity of expounding his own messure himself more fully on another occasion, to vote for such a Bill. He understood the noble lord's measure to have relation to a little Act of Parliament which was passed to remove doubts as to the validity of certain oaths. He thought that the noble lord really intended to extend tho operation of that Act of Parliament. Well, he (Mr. Whitesido) happened to have been present when the circumstance took place which gave rise to it. A celebrated gentleman, Dr. Cooke, of Belfast, the eminent Presbyterian divine, refused to take the oath as proposed to be administered to him. The Chief Baron did not think that ho had any power to allay the scruples of that eminent divine, and accordingly reserved the uestion. It became a natter of legal consideration fn the courts above. Afterwards the Government passed that Act of Parliament, which consisted of a very few lines, and the object of which was merely to declare that, whereI the oath iight have been taken in such manner as was binding upon the conscience of the individual, he should be I liable to all the consequences of perjury inthe same manner as if he had taken it in the form previously prescribed by law. But that did not in the least touch the question I before the House as to the admission or the rejection of Jews. I (Hoar, hear.) That Act was passed in the year 1838. If the learned judges who decided the question had been of opinion that the Oath of Abjuration might be construed in the manner supposed by the noble lord, hemight be per-I fectly sure that those eminent persons would have given to' it that legal effect and operation. If he understood the effect of this Bill, as expounded by the right hon. gentleman, it would bo to declare that to be law which existing Acts of Parliament declared not to be the law (hear, hear); * because lb would declare that by the law and constitution I of this country a Jew might bo admitted to a seat in Parliament, whereas the law, as decided by courts of justice, was tbat'a Jew could not be admitted to a seat in P'arliament. However, the noble lord might be able to explain what he zeally meant. And now, as to the other question which had been agitated-namely, whether Jews shonld be admitted by a mere resolution of that House to take the oath, omitting the words " on the true faith of a Christian." When the noble lord spoke in favour of legislation several of his supporters spoke in favour of a resolution, and particularly the hon. gentleman the member for Finsbury, who referred to the case of the Quakers. But that hon. gentleman musthave forgotten for the moment that the case of members of that philanthropic section. had been provided for by statute. (Hear.) If he would have the goodness to look into the Act of Parliament passed In the oth of George I., he would find that it was distinctly provided that Quakers might take the oath of abjuration | in a certain form therein prescribed. The bon. gentleman was therefore utterly wrong in his notion about the law on that point. With great deference to the hon. gentleman, he must say that he was as much mistaken when he eaid that by the constitution of the country a Quaker might have had the oath administered in such form as he thought 'was not objectionable. A statute was required to authorize the administration of the oath in that form. No mere resolution of the House of Commons could have dispensed, in the case of the Quakers, with the form prescribed as to the taking of the oath of abjuration, and equally powerless would to a resolution of that House to make a law with regard to the Jews. (Cheers.) And yet it appeared by the report of a certain meeting recently held that some persons in high authority in that Houes cpoke very boldly of admitting Baron 1Rothschild by a rosolation. The noble lord was certainly a most excellent authority on it, because he gave a sound opinion when an attempt was made to admit Mr. Salomons, he beheved, by a resolution. (Laughter.) That attempt was made by the hon. and learned member for Wolverhampton. The noble lord on that occasion distinctlv said that he could not agree in what had been said by the hon members for Hull and for Wolverhampton, -who urged that the House of Commons might by a mere resolation declare that Jews ought to be permitted to take tho oath of abjuration omitting the words "upon the true faith of aChrlstian." (Hear.) He (Ur. Whiteside), therefore, confessed that he was surprised that somo of the noble lord's supporters. should have maintained out of that House-though not one of them, ho believed, could maintain satisfactorily in that Housethat a mere resolution would solve the question. Now, wbat was the effeot of a resolution? It was a long time sicce his attention was drawn. to the little book which he held in his hand. It was an edition of Fortessue De Laudibus Angliae, putblished by hEr. Amos, a very learned person, who succeeded Mr. Macaulay in India as legal adviser to the Indian Government, and that was a, strong recommendation of the work. Tho effect of a resolution was discussed by that learned gentleman, who, like a good Whig, pat forward many instances in which the House of Commons had by resolution exhibited a despotic, tyrannical. cagnr~ioug. and absurd course of conduct. 5Laughter.) The noble lord himself (Lord Russell), m his Essay on the Constitution,, made some very just observations on the same subject, but at the close of the note in the excoUent work to which he had referred he fosmd this passage *- " Our judicial history exhibits some memorable instances wherein the attempt by the House of Lords to arrogate to Itself a power with which the constitution does not invest them has met with a resolate and successful resistance." Then followed the words of Lord Mansfield, who stated that declarations of the law mado by either HousEO of Parliament were always attended with bad effects, and that he never thought himself bound inhis judicial capacityto honour them with the slightest regard. Such wts the opinion of the highest authority who ever adorned the judicial bench as to the effect of such a proceeding; :ndyet the House was asked to pass an unconstitutional resolution which would place it in direct conflict with the courts of law. How, then, did this matter stand ? They had had a debate on a most interesting subject, vwhether viewed in its legal or in Its constitutional aspect; and what was to be the practical result? The noble lord at the head of the Government said, not unfairly, that he could not quite understand this BiL Was the noble lord bound, then, to assent to the introduction of every Bill which he could not understand? (A laugh.) Not olerly understanding the Bill himself, ho meant for that reason to vote against it. Even if the noble lord the member for London were allowed to bring in the measure, he could not be congratulated on the prospect that his praiseworthy efforts to improve the statute law, and to admit to the Legislature those whom he so much admired, would be crowned with success. No doubt the noble lord at the head of the Government would religiously carry out the intention he had expressed-namely, that nothing should be made of this Bill during the present sfssion. (A laugh.) Mr. HILDYARD said he had been alluded to as a gentleman who on one occasion had shown a determination to go to extremities as great as those now recommended to the adoptionof the House. Thefacts of the case were these :-When the Corrupt Practices at Elections Bill was under discussion it was deemed very desirable to settle the vexed question as to the legality of the payment of the expenses of voters going up to the poll, and a clause was accordingly introduced declaring such payments logal. This clause was repeatedly discussed in very ful Housee. The noble lord the member for London was one of its most prominent supportere, maintaining that, unless it were agreed to, a very valuable portion of the constituency-the 40s. freeholders-would be disfranobised. The clause was affirmed by that House by large majorities on three different occasions; but the House of Lords struck it out. The Bill came down fromt the other House on the very day before the prorogatioo, and hon. members wero asked to assent to the Lords' amendments. Thequestionwasone that materiaUy concerned that House, because it affected the rights of those by whom they were returned (cheers from the Ministerial side), and it had been carried three times by large majorities. (Renowed cheers from the same quarter.) Under those circumstances he complained that they should be caUed upon by the noble lord, who had himself advocated thec olause, to abdon their position and adopt the Lords' amendments. Therefore, though Parliament was then on the eve of prorogation,he declared that heshould go on dividing the House before he would assent to the proposal of the other House, and it was only on the express condition that the Bill should enduro for but a year and a-half that it was suffered to pass. If the same case were to occur again he should repeat his declaration without any qualification of its terms. Turning to the immediate question before the House, a more extraordinary speech than that of the right hen, gentleman (Mfr. Gladstone) he had never heard. The right hon. gentleman began in his usual wheedling tone by assuring them that he was the last man who would wish to coerce the HIouse of ILords; but before he had done ho tried by tue artS of cajolery to induce the House of Lords to admit the Jew to Parliament-the very thing to which it had already solemnly refused Its assent. If this Bill wont up to the other House, could there be any doubt that It would meet with the samereception as the formerJew Bill? It was deeply to be regretted that ata criss 'whon tho interests of the empire were seriously menaced, and when the strife of parties sbould therefore be merged in a common endeavour to ward off the common danger, the occasion should be taken to involve the two Houses of Parhament in an unseemly collision. (Hear, hear. Mr. HORSMA" said it had been assumed in the course of that discussion that any attempt to seat Baron Roth. schild by resolution was something so unprecedented and unheard of as to amount to a revolutionary proceedlng. The hon, and learned gentleman who quoted the speech of the noblo lord the member for London in 1851, to show that the noble lord could not consiatentlybe aparty to the seating of Baron Rothschild by reaolution, should remember that the resolution proposed in that year did not declare that Baron Rothschild was not eligible to sdt, but simply declared that the House ont that occasion declined to seat him because he then refused to take the oath. The House might have refused to admit himn when he was first elected, when the firmness and oonstanoy of the citizens of London had not been ascertained (a laugh), and when the choice of a Jew as their representative might have been the result of a mere passing caprice. On the other hand, it might well have been supposed that the House of Lords, although it might reject the Bin once or twice, would not continue to resist its passing year, after year in opposition to the repeatedly expressed will of the representativos of the people. Moreover, since that period a precedent had been set to which the House ought not to be wholly insensible, Hon. gentlemen who said that one House of Parlamnent was not a Parliament should recollect the Prounds upon which the House of Lords refused to admit Lord Wensleydale as a peer for life. Lord Derby's grounds for refusing to admit Lord Wensleydale were as follows:- I will not consent that we should deprive ourselves by our own act of that with which the House of Commons will not part-of that which is essential to every legislative body,-namely, the power of being the judges of our own pivileges, and the iiterpreters of the laws which regulate the rights of those who have the honour of a seat in yonr lordships' house." Various other reasons were given, but none so remarkable, so strong, and so applicable as those of Lord Brougham, who ssid:° "Nothing can be conceived, I was about to say, moro monstrous, bu t rather let me say more truly ridiculous, than tbeir coming to any resolution touching our determination of this question, wbich regards our own rights an d privileges alone. As well might we think of interfering with their decisions upon the rights of clection, or the title to seats in that House." The principle laid down was that the House of Lords were the sole judges of their own privileges. There had been a precedent set, and a change of circumsStances had taken place since 1S51, and, although they must all feel a great desire to avoid a conflict which seemed to be threatened, still, if it should come, it would not be by that side of the House that it had been sought. (Hear, hear.) That House had done everything in its power to prevent and avoid a couision, and, much as he should regret it, the responsibility was not in their hands. It was admitted that this oath was not originally enacted to apply to the Jews at all, and that the real distinction between the Roman Catholicswhohad been admitted andthe Jews who had been excluded was that the one were strong and powerful, and were 6,000,000 of persons whose desires were not to be re- I fused, whilethe otherswere numericalywoakandpolitically powerless. (" Hear, hear," and " Oh 1") Lord J. RUSSELL.-The hon. and learned member for Whitehaven ought to admit that my constituents, the electors for the city of London, have shown extraordinary patience, because it appears from his argument that a clau3e in a Bill which had been affirmed by this House three times, being brought forward in the House of Lords the first time in 18M, was rejected by them, and, although it had only been brought forward once in that House, the hon. and learned gentleman considered himself entitled to speak of that as conduct which this House was not bound to tolerate. Now, my constituents have gone on for 10 years sabmitting to the rejection of their claims by the House of Lords, and they have shown more temper and equanimity than the hon. and learned gentloman. (A laugh.) With regard to what has been stated in the debate, I will not refer to what has been said by the right hon. gentleman the member for Cambridge (Mr. Walpole), because I have already taken some notico of those argaments. Bat the hon. gentleman the member for the county of Devon says -and I think he rather carried the argument to an extreme -"Why, here is no danger of refusing the claims of the Jews-no sedition, no tumult -nothing to induce us to pass this Bill." The hon. gentleman reminds me of the lines,- "Tho King to Oxford sent a troop of horse, "For Tories own no argument but force." (A laugh.) " What matters It," argues the hon. member, " that the Jews have reason on their side, when yoa have no disturbance, no sedition, no city of Manchester in a state of disaffection, and no reason for agreeing to any Bill in favour of the Jews l" Sir, I think it would be not only more liberal, bub more conservative to consider these claims when there is no tumult, and when you may therefore be acted upon by reason and fair argument. (Hear, hear.) Well, the hon. and learned gentleman tho member for Enniskillen said he did not understand the contents of the Bill. I have already stated them, but I am ready to state again the general purport of the BilL The hon. and learned gentleman knows that the Act to which I referred, the 1st and 2d Victoria, applied in the first instance to the courts of law, and the words " any other occasion whatever" gave rise to a doubt whether they could refer to any authority superior to that of the courts of law-that Is, whether they could bo held to refer to the Houses of Parlament or the Privy Council. In the next place, it was saidthat the Act referred only to the person taking the oath, and declared that he was subject to the penalty of perjury for false swearing. Now, I propose to extend the Act to both these cases, by stating, in the first place, that it shaU apply to the High' Court of Parliament and to oaths taken upon any other occasion whatever; and, in the next place, that it shaU refer to the person administering the oath, and that whenever that oath shall be administered according to the forms and ceremonies binding on the conscience of the person taking that oath it shall be considered to be lawfuly administered. The hon. and learned gentleman wil therefore see that the description given by my right hon. friend the member for Oxford University is a correct description, not so much of the exact provisions of the Bill as of its urobable effect. And I will not disguise that if such aBillsbhuldbe accepted this House could resolve-which I think it could do now without such an Act, but could resolve then without any darger from a coUision with the courts of lawthat they could administer the oath to Baron Rothschild according to the ceremonies binding upon his conscience. (Eear.) The hon. and learned gentleman entered upon anotber question which I think has not much to (To with this Blll, as to the right of the House to pass a resolution, and he said that in Mr. Pease's case the House had acted according to the statute law, which was clear and decisive upon the point. I demur to this assertion. The 5th of George L says that whenever a Quaker shall be called upon to take the oath of abjuration he shall be allowed to use the form of affirmation, and to take the oath without the words "Ion the true faith of a Christian." But the oath of abjuration of that period was different from that of the time of George III. The oath in the reign of George L was an abjuration of the old Pretender, who was tEen living, while the oath of George IIL's time was aaiffeyent oath and abjured other persons. So far is it from being a correct argument thatthe oath taken by Al'r. Pease was laid down by statute that I believe Mr. Peaso took that affirmation according to a form drawn out at the table, and that it was not from any statute that he was enabled to make that affirmation. The House having had tho report of a committee, the then Speaker, Mr. Manners Sutton, gave it as his opinion that this Fl ousehad an undoubted rightuponits own authority to deolde that Mr. PeasesBhould take that affirmation, and that not nccording to the exact words of the statute, but according ot the general analogy of law. Now, as regards what has been stated by my noble friond at the head of the Government, I am ready to admit that it is for the noble lord to decide according to the state of basiness before him, according totbe measures that it may be necessary to present to Parliament, and according to the state of Government business that may remain, which he alone can be acquainted with-it is in his discretion to determine whether he may be able to afford time for any measure which any other member may bring in. I think I am fully justified in asking the question of him, bat I do not mean to complain of his decision that, although agreeing in the object of the Bill, heannt give me a day. The coasequence may be that, although I may obtain leave to introduce my Bill, it may not be in my power to find Wednesdays enough to carry it this session. (A laugh.) At the same timo I don't exactly know what the number of days may be which the Government may fix for the duration of the session, and I somewhat doubt the exact number of days that this session may last. (Cries of " Hear, hear," and a laugh.) I can certainly take no other course except to introduce the Bill, and I cannot hold out to those who may support me that I shlaU be able to carry the Bill. (Hear.) I cannot in candour say that, butI consider it pei-fectly natural that, after therejectionof another measure on this subject by the House of Lords, there should be considerabloeirritation both among my constituents and among those members of this Rouso who thought that the Bill ought to be passed. (Cheers.) I thought it most probable that the advice would be given to Baron Rothschild that he should come to the table and propose to take the oath. I could not but foresee that there would begreat publiec inconvenience besides loss of time in proceeding by a resolution, and that it would be better if we could obtain an amicable adjustment of the question by the House of Lords. That wasmy view in introducing the BilL The ntmostthat any person has said, though I know not on what grounds, is that the Bill would be rejected by the House of Lords; but certainly my strong impression is that, if theo House of Lords were guided by anything approaching to the wisdom with which the Duke of Weigton advised that House this Jewish question would be easily settled. If the proposed Bill became law, there might be one or two Jewish members in this House, but stUi the House would be quite as Christian as the country, in which the immense majority of the inhabitants is Christian, and the number of the Jews is ubu small; and the House of Lords by agreeing to the Bill would put an end to an unseemly contest. (Hear, hear.) I know not what course will be taken by Baron Rothschild in the present session, hut in what I havo done I have only performed my duty. (Cheers.) The House then divided, and the numbers were- For the Bill .. .. ... 246 Against it... .. - . 5 Mlajority ... ... ... 92 The announcement of the numbers was received with cheers from the Ministerial benches, wEIich were replied to by counter-cheers from the Opposition. Leve wvas accordingly given to bring in the Bill, which was ordered to be prepared by Lord J. Russell, Sir J. Graham, and Mr. A. Smith. AGRICULTURAL STATISlICS. Mr. CAIRD, in moving for leave to bring in a Bill to rovide for the collection of agricultural statistics in mugland and Wales, said, he did not entertain any expectation that the Bill could pass through Parliament durinsg the present session. 31r. BLAKEhIORE, interrupting the hon. gentleman, saidthat as ho had waved his right to bringforward his motion at an early period of the evening' he (Mr. Blakemore) and other hon. members had understood that it would be postponed to some future day. (Some crios of " No, no I") He (Mr. Blakemore) thought the motion ought not to be pressed at that hour (half-past U), and would suggest that the hon. gentleman should fix some some other day for its consideration. The SPEAKEi R observed that in point of order thenotico of the hon. gentleman had only been postponed until after the House had come to a decision upon the motion of the noble member for the city of London. (Hear, hear.) Mr. CAIRD proceeded to say that at so late a period of the session ho of course could have no expectation of having the Bill passed; and for two reasons that was neither neessary nor desirable; first, because It was now too lato to bo brought into operation for the present crop, and secondly, because he was desirous that the country and the a rlculturai class should have ample time to consider at. If he were allowed to bring it in the Bill would rnot relieved them from the substance of the oath. Such was the case with regard to the Quakers in the 8th of Williarn III. In the Sth of William III. Quakers were relieved from these words. The Acts regarding Quakers have been renewed from time to time. There were Acts of G{eorge I., Acts of George IL, Acts of (-enr"g RlLj an4 there was one passed after Mr. Pease took his seat in this House which provides an affirmation in which the words "on the true faith of a Christian" are left out. Now, what is the purpose of this? Is it that a Quaker is not a Christian, er that he objects to declare that he is a Christian?7 By no meansl. No member of the Society of Friends would have the least objection to a declaration, if it were thought nocessary by Parliamnent to have one, that he professed the Christian faith. But these words " on the true faith of a Christian" were reckoned the form of abjuration, and as such they were left out in the case of the Quakers. That is otrue that up to the present day every member of the g ciety of Frlends has taken the wihole substance of the oath, has declared against the whole of the Stuart family, has declared against any pretender to the Throne which is the substance of the oath, but has not declared "on the true faith of a Christian." A further proof of this is with respect to the Jews themselves. When Parliament wlshed to relieve the Jews, which it did, ftom certain penalties, from the obligation to register their estates, if they did not take tho oath of abjuration, it said that the words "on the true faith of a Christian" should not be applied in that case. But there is a further proof in what a Parliament of this country did at the time when it really wished for a religious profession. There was a time-it was during the Commonwealth-when it was thought desirable, whi6h it has not been rthught since, to obtain a positive profession of faith from members of the Commons House of Parliament. It was then onaoted that the foe1owing declaration should be Liken - " I, A. B., do, in the presence of and in the name of God Almighty, promise and swear that to the uttermost of my power, In-my place, I wfil uphold and maintain the true refatcExa Protestant Christian religion, in the purity thereof, as it is contained in the Holy Scriptures of the New and Old Testament, and encourage the profession and professors of the same." Now, here is the sort of declaration that a Parliament or a Protector or a Sovereign would enact if ho or it really wished for a profession of religious faith; and if the hon. gentlemen who have so long contended against us with respect to any alteration of the oath desired to bring this matter to a fair decision, they should propose some positive declaration of Chistianity by which their principle could be tested-a principle wfhih they have always asserted to be the prineiple ofParliamest, but which clearly is not, and never has been, the principle of Parliament. Hear.) I contend, then, from all these proofs-from the origin of the oath in the time of JamesI., from theenactment of the oath of abjuration in the time of Wi2liam III., from the laws exempting Quakers, and in certain cases Jews, from the obligations of the oath of abjuration; and, lastly, from the positive declaration contained in the Act of the Comn unorwealth-that it clearly appears that the words " on the true faith of a Christian" form no part of the oath, but are part of the form and ceremony introduced to make the oath more binding upon Roman Catholics, and that they are so much out of place at the present day that the only persons who are not obiged to cleclare"on the true faith of a Christian," besides theQuakers, ar, the Roman Catholics themselves, on account of whom thete words were originally introduced. (Hear, hear.) I come, therefore, to the question in what planner is that which is no' part of the substance of the oath to be omitted when a Jew appears at the table of this House. I believe that this House has a power which the judges of the land perhaps have not-the power, if it should think fit to exercise it, of stating in resolstions that the words "on the true faith of a Christian" are not part of the substance of the oath, and that Baron Rothschild, being admitted to that table, rball take the osthin thoform 'Anding upon his consoienceviz., without these words " Ithe true faith of a Christian." (Hear, hear.) But ib is a .restion for consideration whether 'we should use our power in that respect and thereby expose ourselves to the contest that may ensue. On looking through the speeches which have been delivered by learned men upon this subjeeb, particularly those of Sir William Page Wood, now one of the Vice-Chancellors of England, and of the present Attorney-General. I find that, although they are full of arguments which are convincing to my mind with respect to tho nature of the oath, they do not afford a solution of the practical difficulties in which we might be involved if -we attempted by resolution to settle this great question. It appears to me in the present state of this question that if we could obtain by a Bill in a different form from any that have been introduced the assent of both Houses of Parliament to a declaration which I believe would be in entire conformity with law, such would be a far better method of ending this aueston than using our extreme power by admitting Baron Rothschild of our own vigour and authority to take the oath with the omission of the words "on the true faith of a Christian." I stated at the be- Inning of what I have had the honour to address to the eOus that it must to a great degree depend upon the Government whether there may be any chance of carrying such a Bill. I cannot think that with a majority of 140, with a Ministry having the support of the countr7-as they affirm and I believe truly they have-the opposition of the House of Lords, which has been overcome in so many instances, which was overcomo on tho Roman Catholic question, on the corn law question, and on nu. merous other questions, would be successful in the present case. I remember that very strong objections were entertained by many members of the House oI Lords tonBillwhich passed herewithregard to the temporalities of the Irish church. Many persons expected that that Bill would be thrown cut in the House of Lords; but the Conservative party was then led by a man who united to very great authority, to a long life of glory and distinction, the greatest wisdom and prudence in civil affairs (hear, hear), and by the advice of that man a great suany of their lordships-I believe as many as would have formed a decided lnajority of the House of Lords-rofrained from opposing the Bill, and it was carried into a law. (Hear, hear.) With respect to another measure-the Bill for repealing the Navigation Acts-which was brought forward when J had the honour to be a member of her Majesty's councils, and which was carried through this House by my right hon. friend the Secretary for the Colonies, the Government declared that they would not accept a defeat upon that question, which they considered to be one of vital importance. What was the result? That Bill was carried, althongh I cannot believeto this day that it was the wish of the tiouse of Lords that the Naviga. tion Acts should be repealed, thinking, as Ido, that upon that subject their opinions and feelings were quite as strong a3 those they entertain with respect to the Jews, which, after all, are rather prejudices than settled opinions. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the authority of this House I beg leave to quote a statement that was made by Chief Justice Fortescue, vwhen he was consulted, along with the other justices, relative to a threatened arrest of the Speaker when the House was in committee. Upon that occasion Chief Justice Fortescue and all the justices answered and said:- " They ought not to answer that question, for it hath not been used aforetime that the justices should in any wise deternmine the privilege of this Hiigh Court of Parliament, for it is so higil and mighty in its nature that it may make law, and that that is law it may make no law. This is a question of their privilege, and the determination and k ]nowledge of their privilege belong to the Lords of Parlia. ment, and not to the justices." That was the doclara. 'ion of Chief Justice Fortescue, and it is stated to refer to a time when the House of Lords were using their powers in a manner which I do not deny they were competent to do, but certainly in a manner which was a very strong exercise of the privileges of that House. An hon. gentleman who spoke on the last night, when it wvas not convenient for the House to hear my explanation, seemed to suppose thab in reference to the decision of the Houso of Lords last year in the case of Lord Wensleydale, to whom a life peerage had been granted by the Crown, I had disputed the competency of the House of Lords to deal with the question. I did not dispute their competency, but I do say that when Lord Coke had given his opinion that life peorages could be granted by the Crown, and when in later days Lord Redesdale gave an opinion that peerages of the united kingdom granted by the Crown oarried with them a right to a seat in Parliament-I must say It was carrying to the utmost the privileges of the House of Lords when it declared that a peer who came with a patent gantd by the Crown by the advice of the Queen's Lard hianceUlor, should be refused admission to that House. (Hear, hear.) The House of Lords, however, have exercised that power, and I have no doubt they did so according to their conscientious convictions, after examining all the authorities which were examined by the maost learned among their lordships; but they decided they had the power, aond roved it by establshing a precedent in that wase of the I;nlyaepeerage. I am glad, although it is somewhat grating, to find that the Hoiuse of Lords can exercise that power without question (and the Govenmment I think were well advised in not bringing the questioni before a court of law) ; but the louso of Lords having come to that decision unquestionablY 'Without having had any dispuate in any court of law upon the subject, I maust say it is smewat ratng o u (har,hear)-it is grating to my constituegnts ing the ci3ty oef Lonhdon,t ibe tol thati we have not the power of admittinz a member to take his seat among the Commons of Engand, although he may have been duly elected according to law. (Hear, hear.) It is impossible to believe that the House of Comm ons can continue much longer in that state, which I must be per- mitted to call a state of humiliation. (Hear, hear.) I therefore ask the House to aRow me to introduce the Bill. I ask them to introduce it in order that members may see it, and be enabled to form an opinion whether it will solve the difficulty at issue. I do not think hon. gentlemen opposite have a right to flatter themselves that this question is to be laid to sleep for the next 10 years. (Hear, hear.) I think we are bound to pursue It in ono form or another. Let us do so with as much moderation as we can. We have aready shown much moderation. The city of London has shown great moderation, but I do not think this isa period in which we ought to adopt a pre- eedent sbowing that, whatever may be the power of the House of Lords, whatever may be the nowers of the other branches of the Legislature, the House of Commons is ntterly powerless upon a great question of publio policy-a question involving principles of liberby-a question involving the highest principles of law; that we are utterly im- poeant, and havo nothing to do but to sit down with degra. ation and humiliation. With these opinions, and with a view of bringing the matter under the consideration of the House, I now ask for leave to introduce a Bill to amend the Act 1st and 2d of Victoria, cap. 105, entitled " An Act for removing doubts as to the validity of cettain oaths." (Cheers.) The motion having been put, Mr. WALPOLE said,-I cannot but regret that the noble lord should have felt it to be his duty to introduce a BiU at this period of the session which in spirit, if not in letter, is the same measure upon which Parliament has already decided. The nohle lord said we were placed in a somewhat extraordinary position, but I ask, who is it that places us in that position? (Hear, hear.) We are indeed placed in an extraordinary position by tho general practice of Parlia. ment being violated (hear, hear), not on account of anyprees. ing emergency, not because there is any great object to bO attained, but because, forsooth, the noble lord is disap. pointed in his expectations of being able to place a member of the Jewish community in the House of Commons. Now, I will concede to tho noble lord tha: the letter of the rule which is observed in Parlinsrent ii& huA been violated by himul uon thi" oggj. sion, for the Bill which he seeks to introduce is not in form the same w%ith that introduced by the noble viscount (pal. Inerston) ; but in spirit it is, as he himself admits, idential. (Bear, hear.) No one Imows bhlter than the noble lord that if the great rule governing our proceedings were to be abolished, and we were to have reiterated discussions of the Eame topics in the same session, there would necessarily ensue a great conflict of decisions in this House; there would be danger of members being taken by surprise, of constanLt vacillationlof opinions, which would be anything but creditable to onrselves or beneficial to our constituents. It Is for these reasons that the rule I have alluded to was adopted, and I put it to the noble lord if he deviates from it upon this occasion whether other members who take equal interest in other subjects will consent to remsin quiet without bringing their views again before the House. There are questions more exciting. and in which the people take a deeper interest than they do upon this question, and are hon. members to be precluded from reiterating their views upon those subjects while it is permitted to renew the discussion of this particular subject ? (Hear, hear.) There are many persons in this country who take a deep interest in the question which was brought under our notice by the hon. membor for Warwickshire (Mr. Spooner)-the Maynooth grant; others who feel deep interest in the proposition advocated by the hon. member for Bristol (Mr. H. Berkeley)-the ballot; and is tho noble lord prepared to say that these subjects shall be discussed over and over again in each session ? (Hear, hear.) The noble lord will, no doubt, sav this is nob the same measure as that which we have already disessed, and that is true, I admit. The Bill of the noble viscount (Palmerston) was to substitute one oath for three, whilg the BiU of tho noble lord, as far as I understand It, is to be a doclaratory law, simply to declare that Jews may take the Oath of Abjuration without the words "on the true faith of a Christian." But, although the form of the Bills may differ, the noble lord, like the noble viscount, has argued tho question as onerelating to the admission of Jews to Parliamont; and no one can doubt but that is the real question. Upon that ground alone, if I had no other objec. tion, I should oppose the introduction of the noble lord's Bil. But is there not another objection? Is there not the danger of bringing yourselves in direct collision with the House of Lords? And if you bring yourselves into moro direct collision with that House, is there not danger of vhat the noble lord says now exists, but which I do not admit-the degradation and humiliation of the House? The noble lord, in one part of his speech, made an allusion vihich I did not distinctly understand. He said that if the Government had taken the usual course in passing measures which they produced the forzner Bill might have become the law of the land. What the noble lord means by that I do not exactly comprehend; but this I know, that one of the greatest advocates against this measure su" orted the Government on that occasion (hear, hear); and also know that the majority for the second reading in this house, instead of being less, was greater than it had ever been before. (Hear.) II think it is a little too much to say that because the House of Commons has passed a Bill this session different from any that was ever proposed before, and because the House of Lords has rejected it, you are to try another experiment, which may bring you into direct collision with that House. (Hear, hear). My second reason therefore, for opposing the introduction of this measure is, that you will bring about that very degradation and humiliaton which Ido not admitnow exists, but which is declared to exist by the noble lord. (Hear, hear.) But another reason is, that wo are now at the end of the present session, when the noble viscount has told us our days are numbered-when we have this very evening been told that one of the most i mportant measures of the Government cannot be proceeded with in committ til Thursday week, because there is so much business betore the House-when you have grave questions to discuss among othors the Marriage and Divorce Bill- that will OcCUpy us for at least a week-when you havo to go into committees of supply and of ways and means-and above all, when you have to look to the most important of all important questions that now affects not only this House and country, but the whole of this empire, the question of India (hear, hear) ; when these great and important matters are before you, are you to be called on again to consider a measure that has already this session been debated and settled ? (Hear, hear.) The noble lord knows that there are no days on which this measure can be fully discussed before the seasion is over, and if that be so, I put it to the House whother it is a wise or a prudent course to introduce it to the House ? (Hear, hear.) These are the grounds on which alone I beg to oppose the introduction of this BilL I purposely forbear to enter into the question itself, because, first, in my view of the case it has been discussed and settled; and secondly, because the arguments are so much exhausted that I believe nothing new can be brought to bear upon it before the House. (Hear, hear.) But, though I do not mean to ciaouss the merits and demerits of this question, there are some remarks of the noble lord which I think ought not to be passed by in silenco-remarks not borne out either by the observations he has made or by the statute to which he has referred. The noble lord has told us that the words " on the true faith of a Christian " are not part of the substanco of the oath, but only part of the form and ceremony in taking it. ("Hear, hear," from the Ministerial benches.) Well, but the gentlemen who cheer that statement would have cheored to the very echo when Sir W. Page Wood made that admirable answer which the noble lord has himself so admirably answered to-night. (Laughter.) Since that time what has happened? The question has been sub-| mitted to the highest tribunaL It was there argued with great ability by the hon. and learned member for Suffolk (Sir F. Kelly). Everything was said that could be said to show that the words " on the true faith of a Christian " were part of the form, and not of the substance of the oath, and might be dispensed with; but the judges of tho Court of Exchequerwere three to one on the point, and on the appeal to the Es chequer Chamber the judges were unanimous. (Hear.x But, notwithstanding that solemn decision, the noble lord comes here with all the weight of his authority and tells the House that those words form no part of the substance of the oath. (Hear.) Lord J. RUSSELL.-I said the judges had not decided the point, and that what they decided was that the words havlng been put there by statute could not be left out. Mr. WALPOLE.-I hope the noble lord will again read the declsion. But if the noble lord wishes an argument that will convince him that these words are a part of the substance of the oath, I will satIsfy him by a reference to two statutes passed in the reign of George IL-the one an Act ror tbo better security of the King's person and government; and the other, for naturalizing members of the Jewish religion in His Majestv's colonies in America. [The right hon. gentleman here quoted from those statutes, which dispensed with the words " on the true faith of a Christian" in certain cases when the oath was taken by Jews.] The statutes did not give tho power to uso another form of words, for it was distinctly stated that they were part of the Oath of Abiuration, and the words implied that they belonged to the substance and not td the mereoform of the oath. (Hear, hear.) But there dropped from the noble lord a most ominous sentence. He said he thought this House ought not to be left in a state of humiliation (hear, hear), and that It ought to take eome steps immediately, be it by Bill or be it by resolution to settle this question. (Cheers.) If I understand aright these cheers it is high time we understood each other. (ear.) The noble lord made sundry remarks abont the power of Parliament, and he quoted a passage from Chief Justice Fortescue as to what that-ower was. But the power of Parliament is a totaUy different thing from the power of the House of Commons. (Cheers.)If owe are to understand by the power of Parliament tho power of the House of Commons, the sooner that is avowed the better. (Hear, hear.) ThO oath taken at that table is contained in an Act passed, not by the House of Commons alone, but by the two Houses of Parliament, and by the authority of the Crown (hear, hear); and if any member shall sit in this House without taking that oath he is liable to Penalties. Can this House relieve him from Penalties imposed by Act of Parlianient and the Crown ? (Hear, hear.) Is the House going to enter into a conflict, not merely with the House of Lords, but with the courts of law? (Ecar.) Are you going to set yourselves above the judicial tribunals of the country? (Hear, hear.) There was a time when a King of this country attempted to dispents with our laws, and it produced a revolution. (Hear, hear.) There was also a time when the House of Commons attemapted to legislate without the House of Lords and without the Crown, and of itself to make laws for this country. Let me point out to you whatifollowed. I have extracted from the Journals three resolutions then passed, which I will read to the Rouse. The first resolution was dated January 4, 1646, and was as follows REesolved,-That whatever is enactedl or declard for law erteCrmns in Parliament assembled hath the force law, ad all the people of the natido are concluded thereby, although the concurrence of King or House of Peers be not had thereto." (Hear, hear.) [A Member.-The Commonwealth. Yes, the Commonwealth, and anybody who Sets up this H?ouse of Commons above the House of Lords and the Crown establishes a Commonwealth. (Cheers.) Then, on FebruLary the 8th, 1648, I find the folowing, and you will see that the House of Commons had taken a rapid start - " Resolved,-That the House of Peers is useless and dangerous, and ounght to be abolished, and that an Act ho brought in for that purpose.' Again, on the 7th of Februy, 1648, I find the following resolution : " Resolied,-That the office of King in this realm, and that the powers thereof in a single person, is unnecesary, burdensome, and dangerous tothe liberty safety, and good of the people, and that it ought to be abofished." (Hear.) 'hen we are told that this was at tho time of tho Commonwealth. It shows what kind of commonwealth you will arrive at if you onceo set aside the laws. (Hear.) I would rather that you let 50 Jews into Parliament in a regular way than that for the purpose of introduoing one you should break through the constitution. (Hear, hear.) If ever any such attempt should be made I have stiol much confidence in the noble lord, notwithstanding his wavering expressions to this House, and so mnuh confidence in the whole country, that I am sur they would think you had arrived at the lasb pitch indeed of humiliation and degradation if it were assented to. (Cheers.) The noble lord, in that plausible manner, I was goig to say, but iu tha popular manner I will say, in whi.h he can put any proposition before this Hlouse, has ingeniously attempted to draws a comparison between wvhat took place last year with respect to the Wensleydale peerage and a resolution which might now be proposed in the House of Commonis to Seat Baron Rothschild. Nobody knows better than the noble lord that of all the specimens of logical reasoning none is more beautiful than that which is drawn from analogy, bat de4s thOe analogy D,e comnpl6te 10l1 Is blte Ihisleading a1° d deceitful. Thei House of Lords, as the hereditary branch of the Legislature, has privileges of its own which ought not to be taken away. One of the privileges of the House of Lords, as the hereditary branch of the Legislature, is similar by analogy to one of the privileges of the House of Conmmons, as the elected representation of the people. The privilege of the House of Lords, as the hereditary branch of tbe Legislature, is to determine for itself whether, according t, law and the constitution of the coantry, those who claim to have a seat in it are entitled to that seat or not, and the privilege of the House of Commons, as the reprtsentative assembly elected by the people, is to determine for itself, as it does, whether those who come here to take a seat are or are not entitled to that seat. (" Hear, hear," from the Ministerial side.) But the privilege of the House of Lords and the privilege of the House of CommoDs are both limited and circumscribed by law, and when both assemblies have passed an Act of Parliament wbich makes it requisite that something should be done before a peer can take his seat under the patent, or before a member can take his seat in this House, as elected by the people, then they are bound by the law of the land, and their privileges cease at this Point. (Hear, hear.) Now, the beat mode of illustrating the distinction between the noble lord's line of argument and mine is simply to suppose what would be the case if Baron Rothschild were made a Peer. He then could no more take his seat in the House of Lords thin now he can here, and the real analogy begins aud ends tbere. The analogy intimated by the noble lord is really no analogy whatever. Now, the first reason which I wish to submit to the House, in all calmness and moderation, why it should not allow the introduction of this Bil is-because, th. ugh it may not violate the letter of your rule of proceeding, yet it is against the spirit of that rule. (Hear, hear.) The spirit of that rule unquestionably is that for e espatch of business, to prevent surprise, and to carry on the proceedings in an orderly manner, we ought not to discuss the same question twice in the same session. On this is founded my first great objection to the introduction of this Bill. (Hlear, hear.) My second great objection to the introduction of the measure is, that I think for this HIouse nnecessarily to putb itself now in conflict with the House of Lords would be one of those courses which wise statesmen have always drprecated, and which, in my opinion, ought to bo much deprocated on tho presentoccasion. (Hear, hear.) I have a third objection to the motion now before the House, which would have weight even if the other two could bo got over, but which, when they are borne in nmind, is till more powerful. I think that on a question of this kind it is not right at the latter end of the session, when we have got more business on hand than we can possibly get through, that we should add unnecessarily to our labours and prevent the despatch of more urgent business. (Hear, hear.) These are three main reasons which I offer against tho introduction of this Bill; but if the Bill should be brought in, then would come again the question of principle, which would have to be discussed again. (Hear, hear.) At present, however, I wish to confine myself to the objections r have stated, In order that the House may consider whether it would be advisable to take the course which the noble lord proposes. More than this I need hardly say. I only trust, whatever may be the result of this motion of the noble lord, it will not be followed up by any attempt to make a resolution of this House supersede every constituted authority in the kingdom, for if you onceo attempt to do that, you virtually and in reality create a revolution. (Cheers.) Mr. DILLWYN in reply to the observations of the right hon. gentleman, uenied that when he gave notice of a resolution to allow Baron Rothschild to take the oaths inl the way most binding on his conscience he was enterino upon any revolutionary course, and he could not forget that the most democratic suggestion ever made to that l1ousenamedy, that every militinman should have the franchise had emanated from the right hon. gentleman. (Hear, hear.) He therefore thought that the right hon. gentleman might have been a little sparing of the lofty tone in which he addressed that (the Ministerial) side of the House. He found a most marked precedent for the proposition of which he had given notice, in the decision of a Speaker who was attached to the Conservative party, Mr. Manners Sutton. That decision was laid down for the guidance of the House on the occasion of the election of Mr. Pease. When Mr. Pease came to the table and claimed to be admitted to a seat upon making an affirmation, Mr. Manners Sutton, according to HarwsarXs Dceates, made this statement:- " Mr. Speaker said he was sure that the House would feel, as he felt, that not only the law and the privileges of the House, but also the personal interests of the hon. mem. ber himself were concerned, and that it was therefore necessary that a deliberate construction of the law as it existed should be obtained. That construction could alone be promounced by this House itself." (Hear, hear.) He hoped, after such an opinion from a gentleman who had been connected with kon, members opposite, who held what were called Conservative and consti. tutional principles, that he (Mr. Diliwyn) and those who entertained simuilar views would not be taxed with recommending a revolutionary course. He wasimost desirous of avoiding any collision with the House of Lords, and he believed that the mode of proceeding he had suggested would have prevented such a collision. He thought the House had pursed a weak and dangerous course in declining to interfere iu the case of Alderman Salomons, and allowing the question to bo submitted to the courts of law. Hon. gentlemen would undoubtedly admit that it was their duty to maintain the privileges of the House of Com. mons, and that they ought not to allow the House of Lords to sit in judgment upon a question exclusively affecting those privileges. Suppose the House decided that Alderman Salomons ehould be sworn at the table in a form binding upon his conscience, that he took his seat, that he voted, that an actioi4 was brought against him in one Rof the law courts, that the judgment of the House was confirmedt thAt the question was carried to thR courts above, and the interpretation put upon the law by tho House affirmed, an appeal aight eventually be made to the House of Lords, who would sit in judgment upon the privileges of the House of Com. inos, and might perhaps reverse their decision. (Hear, hear.) This w as a matter which he thought deserved serious, but at the same time calm andtem prate consideration. He confessed that he entertained considerable doubt with regard to the course which the noble lord (Lord J. Russell) was pursuing. (Hear, hear.) At the same time, in deference to the high authority of the noble lord, who was desirous of exhausting every effort of conCliation before recourso was had to what hon, gentlemen opposite might consider revolutionary measures, he (3r. Dillwyn) would support the motion for the introduction of the Bill, Mr. PALK said this subject had frequently been argued with great ability, but it was now placed before the House in a form which seemed to raise a question of much higher importance than the admission of Jews to Parliament. (Hear, hear.) He honoured those who, year after year, consistently maintained the cause of the Jews; he admitted that some of their arguments were extremely forcible, and that the admission of Jews to Parliament would render civil and religious liberty complete. (Hear, hear.) No one in that House had any objection to the Jews. It would be absurd to suppose for a moment that Jews located in this country, and owning it as their home, would seek to injure the constitution of the realm; but he entertained strong objections to the course nov taken by the noble member for the cityof London. He recollected that many years ago, when the noble lord represented Sonth Devon, he stated that his object in all reforms was to retain in undiminished integrity the constitution of the country, while such improvements were effected in that constitution as the lapse of ages might have rendered necessary. But what was now the noble lord's position? He was urging a course which would bring the two Houses of Parliament into collision, and would destroy the constitution he had always declared himself anxious to maintain. What wasthe noble lord's excuse? Was it that there were any strong popular demonstrations on this sabject ? No; the Bill for the emancipation of the Jews had been rojected this year, as it had been rejected year after year, but Manchester was not in insurrection. (" Hear," and a laugh.) He knew something of the inhabitants of Lancashire, and he ventured to say that when they rose in insurrection it would be in defence of the Christian causo, and not In behalf of unbeievers and infidels. What excuse, then, hadthe noble lordfor urginghisBil upon the attention of the House? A great and important meeting of members of this House had been called together at a pot-house over the way. (Laughter, and cries of "Oh" from the opposite side.) That meeting was addressed by right hon. gentlemen and by members of Parliament who had held offices in the Government, but he believed it was far from unanimous. The one portionof the meeting was in favour of one course of action, the other advocated a different mode of proceeding, but some sort of unanimity was established by the seducing tongue of the right hon. member for Carlisle (Sir. J. Graham), and he understood that a deputation had this day waited upon the noble lord at the head of the Government, with what success he did not know. If, however, neither the Prime Minister, nor the country, nor his own meeting were with the noble lord, upon what ground did he now attempt to thrst this question upon the House ? (Htear, hear.) The noble lord (Lord J. Russell) had said that the House of Lords had yielded upon various occasions, but that had been in cases when the country forced them to yield upon questions of great national and poltical Importance. It had been proposedL to bring Baron Rthschild into the House and permit him to take that portionx of the oath which he conscientiously could take, and then to declare it a breach of privilege for' any one to prosecute him for voting without having taken the oath in its present form. Now, that was a point which any hon, gentlemamn had a perfeet right to urge, anad to say that that House should be able by a resolution to seat its own members, If that right aleady existed it was onily patriotic to urge it, and a court pOf law would easily have decided the question. If It arayexisted then a great many years had been wasted in deaig the question ; and if it should be decided that it did not exist the House would only be in the same position whichit occupied then. The measurefor the admissxio of Jews was first carried in that Hlouse and rejected by the House of Lords. The noble lord had referred to the case of Lord Wensleydale, and had advanced it as an instance of the House of Lords vindictnthi own authority. Now, what were the real fact ofte eas Why, upon that occasion, -when the House of Lordsha refused admission to Lord Wensleydale, a Bill was introduced into the Rouse of Commons providing for the formation of peerages for lie for the purposes of the appellate jurisdiction. That Bill had been supported by the right hen, getleman the member for Buckfinghamshiire and by the verument, and the -noble lordl who was regarded as the leader of the Conserva. tive party bA~ strongly urged upon those who agreed with him in political opinions the expediency of supoting that Bill. For his own part, he had disagreed Zththognoble lord, and, with the majority of those who Sat UPOnX the sa6me aide of the House as himself, had Voted against the measure. That Bill had been rejected, but the House of Lords did not feel It necessary to call a maeeting at the King's Armin, or to bring themselves Into collison -with the House of Commons, and he did not see now why the House of Commons enL the 'present occasion should come into collison with the House of L-ords, and mnost sinoerely did. he hope that the noble lord the miember for Londoni would not by any aot of hls tend to destroy that

OXFORD CITY BELEC'2'IO2. The polling commenced yesterday raorning at S o'clock, and was carried on with unabated vigour till 4 In the afternoon. Mr. Cardwell headed the poll the whole of the day, and at 1 o'clock the majority in his favour was no less than 101. His opponent, however, gradually gained ground, and at the close of the poll at 4 o'clock the numbers were :- Mr. Cardwel ... ... ... ... ... 1,085 Mr. Thackeray ... ., .., ... ... 1,018 Majority for Mr. CardweelL.. ... 67 At 6 o'clock the Mayor declared the state of the poll in the Town-hall yard, in the presence of an immense assem. blage. Mr. TiscHzCn.y then came forward to address the meeting, and was received with loud and prolonged cheering. He said,-Give me leave to speak a few words to you on this occasion, for althongh the red, white, and blue are my friends. I hope to make the blue and yeUlow my friendsalso, Let me tell you a little story, but a true one. Some years ago, when boxing was more common in this country than it is at the present time, two celebrated champions met to fight a battle on Moulsey-heath. Their names were Gully and Gregson. They fought the most tremendous battle that had been known for many long years, and Gregson got the worst of it. (Laughter.) As he was lying on his bed some time afterwards, blinded, and his eyes closed up, ho asked a friend to give him something to drink. A person in the room handod him some drink and grasped him by the hand. " Whoso hand is this?" asked Gregson, " 'Tis Jack Gully's," was the reply. SNow, Gregson was tho man who was beaten and Gully was the conqueror, and he was the first man to shake him by the hand, to show that he had no animosity against him. (Cheers.) This should be the conduct of aU loyal Englishmen, to fight a good fight, and to hold no animosity against theopposite side. (Loud cheers.) Withthis feeling (proceeded Mr. Thackeray) I go away from Oxford. With this feeling I shall have redeemed one of the promises I made you yesterday; the other I cannot by any possibility answer, because, somehow or other, our side has como out a little below the other side. (Laughter, cheers, and groans.) I wish to shake Mr. Cardwell by the band, and to congratulate him on being the representative of this great city. (Cries of " No, no," " Yes, yes " and groans and hisses.) I say it is a victory which you ought to be proud of; it is a battle which you ought to be proud of who have taken part in it; yoa have done your duty nobly and fonght most gallantly. I, a man who was unknown to most of yoll, and who only came before you with the recommendation of my noble and excellent friend, Mr. Neato (cheers), have met wita msny fiiends. You have fought the battle gallantly against great inaluences, aganst~ an immense strength vhich have been brought against you, and in favour of that honoured and respcted man, Mr. CardwveU. (Cheers, hisses, and groans.) Stop, exclaimedMr.Tbackera , don'thiss. WhenLord htonck came downhere and addressedtheelectors hewaskindenou.bh to say a kind word in favour of me. Now, that being tte case, don'tlet me be outdone in courtesy and generosity, but allow me to say a few words of the respect aud cordiality which I entertain for Mr. Cardwell. As for the party battle which divides you, I am, gentlemen, a stranger, for I never heard the name of certain tradesmen of this city tiU I came among you. Perhaps I thought my name was a little better known than it is. You, the electors of Oxford, know whether I have acted honestly towards you; and you on the other side wiU say whether I ever solicited a vote when I know that vote was promised to my opponent; or whether I have not always said-" Sir, keep your word - here ismy hand on it, let us part good friends." (Loud cheers.3 With my opponents I part so. With others, my friends, I part with feelings stiU more friendly, not only for the fidelity you have shown towards me, but for your noblo attachment to the gallant and tried friend whom you did know (lond cheers), and who I hope wiU be your representative at some future time. (Cries of "Bribery !") Don't cry out bribery; if you know of itprove it; but asl am innocent of bribery myself I do not choose to fancy that other m,en are not equally loyal and honest. (Cheers.) It matters very little whether I am in tle House of Commons or not to prate a little more - but you have shown a great sDirlt, a great resoluotion, and great independence, and I trust at some future day, when you are better acquainted with me, when you know me better than you do norr, you willbeable tocarryyour causetoamoresuceessfulissne.(Loud cheers.) Before I came to Oxford I knew thero was a certain question that would go against me, and which I would not blink to be made a duke or a marquis to-morrow. In March last, when I was at a dinner in Edinburgh, some friends of mine asked me to stand for tho representation of their city. Mry answer was this:-" That I was for having the people amused after they had done their worship on a Sunday." (Cheers.) I knew that I was speAing h a peoPle who, of all others, were the most open to sacrples on that point, but I did my duty as an honest man, and atated what my opinion was. (Cheers.) I have done my duty honestly to this city, and I believe that that is the reason why I am placed in a minority, but I am contented to bow to that decision. I told you that I was for aUowing a man to have harmless pleasures when he bad done his worship on Sunday. (Cheers) I expectedto have a hiss, but they havo taken a more dangerous shape-the shape of slander. Those gentle. men who wiU take the trouble to read my books-and I shall be glad to have as many of you for subscribers as will come forward-will be able to say whether there is anything in them that should not be read by anyone's children or my own, orIby an Christian man. I say, on this ground I will retire, and take my place, mdthy pen and ink, at my desk, and leave to lSr. Jardwell a busmess which I am sure he understauds better than I do. (Cheers.) Mr. Thackeray concludod by proposing a vote of thanks to the mayor, and the proceedings shortly afterwards terminated. _ __ _ Sm JonT V mERs SHELsEY, M.P.-We regret to state that Sir John Villiers Shelley bam been provented, by serious indisposition from attendance on his Parliamentary duties during the past week.

LONDOA, WEDZESDAY, JULY 22, 1S57. In the House of Lords last night Several Bills were read a third time and passed. Lord ST. LEONARD'S then laid on the table a Bill for simplifying the titles to land, and detailed at great length the evils of the existing system. After considerable discussion, in which the LosD CHANCEuLOR, Lord BROUGHEa, and Lord CAsteBELT took part, the Bill was read a first time. Lord COxnELm asked the LORD CiCuxeLtor for information as to the state of the appeal to their Lordships' H ouse in the case of "MhIMER v. SALO5TONS," which turned on the question whether Jews could lawfully sit in Parliament. The LORD CHANCELWOR replied that the case had been deferred from time to time on the petition of both parties. It would now probably stand over till next year, as the session was too advanced to allow of its being heard. Some other business was then despatched, and their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, at a morning sitting, on the order for going into committee upon the Banking Bill, Mr. HrA..r- appealed to MIr. LOWE not to proceed with a measure of so much importance to the comiercial classes this session. Other'membersbacked this appeal, but Mir. LOWE declined to comply, and the House went into committee upon the Bil. Upon the third clause, Air. HEaDLAle, pursuant to notice, moved an amendment to provide for the formatign of Toint,
It requires a very strong case to justify a second appeal to Parliament in one session upon a mneasure substantially the same. Under ordinary circumstances we could not commend such a breach of that unwritten law, or understanding, which is the only protection of the Legislature against incessant attacks on its time and forbearance. But in this instance it deserves to be considered that there is to be amended a standing grievance, comprised in the very present and palpable form of one of the first mercantile personages in the world, who, after being several times elected for the City of London, is unable to take his seat, and the City, so far as regards that seat, is disfranchised in consequence. On a former occasion the spectacle of a member returned in spite of such an obstruction, and, after a rebuff, making his appearance again with a double pressure and following at his back, was supposed to shake the House of Commons from its propriety and procure the quick settlement of a difficult question. In the present instance there may not be the same pressure, and the patience of those with whom we have to deal is itself an argument with some for still leaving the grievance u nredressed. But there is an increasing absurdity and injustice in our keeping standing, as it were, at the bar of the House a man to whom we shiould go at once for the means of saving our country in a perilous emergency. Supposing some such crisis of our fate as the eventful character of our annals renders not improbable, and supposing our expenditure threatening to exceed our income, the next news would be that the gentleman upon whom a number of country gentlemen are shutting the door of the Legislature] was closeted with the CHAN.CULLOR of the EXCIIEQrER in most confidential and interesting colloquy. Now, this does make an extraordinary case, and thlerefore upon those wvho lceep up the grievance we throw the responsibility of this second agitation, this second Oaths Bill. Moreover, it is very clear that the Bill is only preparatory to another course which the House of Commons is (iiite competent to adopt any Session, and which it has only postponed from excess of delicacy to the other House. The Oaths which the House chooses to administer to candidates for admission are an affair for the House itself, which has an excellent example for its guidance in the recent conduct of the House of Lords on the WENSLEYDALE Peerage. It is true that we are threatened with a terrible collision, a disastrous and humiliating collision, and a great deal more too bad for words to express, if the House presumes to talke this matter into its own hands. But, considering the virtual preponderance of power possessed by the House, and its peculiar hold on the supplies, wo do not anticipate a collision of much constitutional gravity. Of course, it would be otherwise if there existed an Act of Parliament expressly and directly excltding Jews, passed for that very object, and embodying, therefore, the deliberate decision of the whole Legislature. But there is no such thing. The Jews never have been excluded from Parliament, except, in the middle ages, by the same comprehensive and consistent policy which banished them the country altogether. But Parliament never yet has passed an Act to exclude the Jews. The Roman Catholics it did industriously and emphatically exclude in an Act carefully framed for the purpose, and striking home at the most critical part of their faith. If there ever was such a measure for the exclusion of the Jews, let some one point it out, and say in what year it was passed. The Jews are not so much as named in any Act under discussion. Indeed, the simple case is, that the Jews, being readmitted to the country after a long banishment, and being at first very gladl to hide their heads anywhere, and pick up business as it offered, had no ambition to sit in Parliament. They had no relish for great people. hiigh politicians, agitators, and intriguErs, and hardly expected civil usage in such company. At first, therefore, they were not Elkely to originato a demand for admission, or to draw attention to the obstacles which stood in their way. It is only when they have become rich and important, and are almost an estate of the nation, that it becomes a matter of interest to lnow how they are excluded. It is by an obstacle of the same sort as if in a legal ceremony it was prescribed by law that a man should say IIYes " or " No," and dumb people were therefore found excluded; or as if it were prescribed a man should lift up his arm, so that a man who had lost both arms would not be able to comply with the Act. Of course, wo don't pretend to say that a Jew's religion is a peculiarity of the same purely accidental kind as blindness or a maim ; but we do say that the obstacle cainot be deserving of inuch consideration whlieh is mentioned in no Act of Parliament, and which has no other body than the tail of an oath. We are not aware of any important law or part of the Constitution so slightly and incdirectly embodied. Parliament has always encoiuntered great questions with boldness, and has not tried to indulge a prejudice or a pique by a mere sidewind. It has st-rclk at tho very face of its political antagonists. There is, however, no appearance in this case of Parliament having ever thought of the Jews. Th? words " The true faith of a Christian" were addressed to the consciences of aU those who werc members, and did not suppose those who were not. TheHouse, then, on reconsidering how it camf to pass that the Jews are actuaUy excluded, and being desirous to remove that exclusion, finds it never has moved for the purpose ; in a word, it never has expressly excluded the Jews. Hence the natural proposition to amend the form of the Oath which is found to have this indirect effect. If that proposal be not accepted by the other House, after a majority of near a hundred in the Commons, then will come the time of the other House to discharge its constitutional powers upon the form of admission. A resoluition to this purport will soon be proposed by an independent member; it will probably pass, and may possibly prove the House independent of the Courts as to its rules of admission. If the Lorcls wish it to be done otherwise: and do not choose that the House of Commons should be taking so independent a line of action, they had better anticipate that ominous spectacle looming upon us by agreeing to tho Bill discussed last night as soon as it has passed the Commons.
The City of Oxford has made a judicious choice. The return of 31r. CARDW3LL fillB up an acknowledged vacancy in the House of Commons, while it is doubtful whether Mr. THAcnmay's services to the country would have counterbalanced the possible disadvantages to himself which might have followed on the success of his enterprise. ' As he truly observed at the hustings, it is desirable that there should be silent members in the 'lopseof Commons, but it is not necessary that the voting senators should be men of genius. A brilliant writer may be as nseful a member of Parliament as Mr. A. or Mr. B., but if he is not. discontented with their hulmble leyel rw2 iortwle ,it is difficult to understand why he should trouble hirgelf with P^arliamentary life. MIr. THACuERAY announces an intention of cultivajLng the art of speaking; and it cannot )be doubtetd that a sense ot duty would have led him to devote kg attention to pub c affairs; but neither his works nor his recent speec2tes indicate any habitual interest in political discusd;IOns. As the candidate of the more advanced LiLeral party'he was ready to pledge himself to the Bal< t, but ia a moment of inadvertence he borrowed the p'hraseology and the opinions of his opponents. *" We "will not," he said, " have the Ballot to-morro v; "w we are too manly, too plucky, and too honest." In other words, the Ballot oiught to be introduced when "pluck" and " honesty" go out of fashion. The mistake is precisely that of a laYman who rashly ventures on professional language. To strangers the blunder, even if itt is observed, seems insignificant, but the initiated perceive in an instant that the speaker is not ohe of their guild. If Mr. TfACKImuAY were to make his appearance at a May meeting in Exeter-haU he would probably, with the best intentions, appaU his audience by the use of some High Church formula. Be might learn the language, perhaps the substance, of political controversy while he Was studying the art of spealing, but such a man may be better occupied than in serving an apprenticeship to a new and difficult craft. If any Englishman in middle lfe finds himself indifferent to politics he may be well assured that he has a natural iepugnance to Parliamentary pursuits. A great author or artist has additional reasons for being satisfied vwith the career which his natureanddisposition have pointed out to himself. Commonplaces about the claims or the incapacities of literary men are in a high degree IUnprofitable. No lawyer, or statesman, or divne can be the worse for literary training, but prominent public men must mak-e politics the study and business of their lives. Mir. DIs;AELI has given up novel-writing since lie became the leader of his party, although there are many vho prefer his romances to his orations. Sir E. B. LYTTON, who is more constant to his original vocation, only delivers set speeches twice or three times in a session. Mr. THACnxRAY disavows al pretensions to eloquence, and his readers would utter a well-founded protest against any attempt en his part to abandon literature. If he hbas any personal feeling of disappointment he may console himself with the reflection that the collective House of Commons could not -write Barry Lyndon or Vanity Fair. Mr. CADWEwLL is once more in his proper place, and perhaps he will not have cause to regret the hint which was conveyed in his enforced temporary absence. Bir. THAcKErnY, in his inexperience of political discussion, rather overdid the tirade which he thought it judicious to deliver against the Peelites. Those who are more familiar with the relations of parties are well aware that the member for the City of Oxford is by no means likely to follow the representative of the lUniversity in his eccentric gyrations. Of all Sir RosnEr PExE's followers Mr. CARDW`LL, perhaps, most faithfully represents the practical and businesslike element in the character of his master. With a delicacy which was certainly not discreditable, though it may possibly have been overstrained, he declined to join the present Cabinet when it was suddenly deserted by the more prominent members of the section vwith which he had acted. The same coinexion indluced him to give one or two mistaken votes in reference to foreign affairs ; but when MIr. GLAarDoSTO commenced his furious attack on the Government at the beginning of the present year Afr. CADWEvL declined to adopt th$ paradoxical proposition that the CHANCaLOP Of the EXCOQUE1e was violating a binding contract niade by the country wvith itself. A member, of. the majority vhich supported Sir C. Lzwis's Budget, he would assuredly not have been found in the ranks of a Coalition Ministry. On the present occasion he promises to "give the Government a "free and independent support, and to endeavour | "to sustain abroad the empire and the power of "England." Mr. CARDwEnL, in common with every living statesman, knows more of the national feelingthan he suspected four years ago. There is no longer any serious danger that Mfinisters will com premise the honour of the country, and it is highly desirable that they should be checked or aided by those who understand how to develope its strength and resources. Mr. CAnDwBEL's official experience has taught Ihim how to give effect to the sound doctrines which he holds on all matters of trade and finance. His late opponent would probably be the first to disclaim any definite opinion on the regulation of the floating debt or on the renewal of the Bank Charter. No wise man rejoices in any political convulsion which drives the leaders of the House of Commons out of public life. The constituencies at the general election gave a verdict which was both honest and substantially correct; but we trust that the most considerable among the ostracized candidates may speedily find their way back into Parliament, aud that Mr. CorDNm and Mr. BiuiRT may meet with boroughs to rescind the judgment of Huddersfield and Mlanchester. MIr. CARDWELL had given less provocation to account for his defeat, and he will be more immediately available for the transaction of public business. His acquirements and faculties were as much lost to the world during his exclusion from the House of Coommons as if he had been a great imaginative writer immersed in the perusal of blue-books. It may be added that if the Oxford Election interrupts the publication of Sir RoBERT P.EL'S sawdust-like memoirs, the constituency will have conferred a double benefit on all lovers of literature, while they have done 'a tangible service to the country. The number of leading members of the House of Commons under the age of fifty may be counted on one's fingers. When the colleagues of0A.-NiN2 and of Lord G,nFY shall prove themselves, after all, to be mortal, there will be some difliculty in discovering successors who will not be below mediocrity.
It would be difficult to believe that the affairs of the London and Eastern Banling Corporation have been conducted in a more reckless and profligate manner than those of the Royal British Bank, but at least there is a parity of infamy between the management of the two concerns. In either case the interests of the Shareholders have been entirely sacrificed to the cupidity of the Directors. If any distinction be possible between these two astonishing examples of successful fraud, we wouild say that the Shareholders of the Royal British Bank were swindled for the convenience of several,-the Shareholders of the London and Eastern Banking Company rather for the convenience of one. Why do not our writers of fiction, who are so desirous to present us with pictures of the social state in which we live, select for illustration such a history as that of Colonel WAUGH, of Branksea Island ? Here is an instance of a man who seems to have coolly proposed to himself as work to be done a deliberate plan for maintaining a splendid position for a* certain number of years at the expense of the community. le accomplished his end by' the machinery of a Joint-stock Bank-the readiest conbiDvance for suction known to modern tim 'i .aen a sufficient number of Shareholders ep a be deluded into paying up a certain amount of eipital -when a banking concern has been set on '1.ot, and wherk deposits come tumblina i,p it *% ci,z enough that, as long as credit remains, the purse of FonI TtThG:&TUS may be said to be at the disposal of the British MACAIRE who originates the institution. The only pbstacle in his way must come from his brother Direct,;Cs ; but in the case of the Royal British Bank we ki, "'w) in the case of thie London and Eastern Banng a 'orporation we can readily guess at, the means by -.vhich their opposition may be boughlt off or set aside. The main point seems to be that the business must be done on a sifficiently large `cale- A petty rogue would soon be swamped in these uneasy waters; a man of aspiring spirit an" resolute mind may fairly indulge tle expectation of ecmrying on his plans with uncheckered success as long as a sovereign remains in the till. The very circumstance which of all others should inspire suspicion seemns to be the very one best calculated to avert it-namely, that the chief manager of the concern is living in a condition of splendour for wvhich his means, on any rational calculation, are wholly insufficient. Tho Shareholders should say, "This man is squandering " away our money." They arc, however, more inclined to say, " See how much money the man "who has the care of our interests can afford to squander." The country seat, the town mansion, the gallery of pictures, the systenm of profase entertainments, -which should suggest the probability of fraud, act in quite an opposite direction, and arp accepted as proofs of exulting solvency and of good faith beyond the reach even of temptation. ThkeLondon and Eastern Corporation smashed in March last-that is, just before the period when the plan for the criminal punishment of frauduilent Directors had been ftully matured, although under consideration. There was an evident necessity for speedy action if the Directors wvould avoid contact with any system of criminal jurisprudence. At that time the idea of attacking by infolmation a body of Directors for a conspiracy at common law does not seem to have occurred to the minds of our lawyers; but we can have little doubt that Colonel WAt7uaH and his fellows are just as amenable to this form of proceeding as the ESDAILES, STAI'LETONS, and CAMEROxS of the B-ritish Bank. Ezperience has shown that persons in this situation may readily enough be arrested and brought to justice. Some practical difficuilty in the way of collecting evidence might occur from the fact that in the casb of lhe London and Eastern Bank the liquidation has been a private one; but surely this cannot be insuiperable. The gentlemen acting 'in the interest of the Shareholders must be possessed of ample evidence to support an information such as the one which has been filed against the Directors of the British Bank. On Monday last a meeting was held to investigate the condition of affairs, but the result does not seem to have been very flattering to the hopes of the shareholders. A report was read, showing a reduction since the 11th of April of the liabilities'from 340,2401. to 2S2,7061., and of the assets from 334,0101. to 269,9961. So far there is no great gain or loss; but it should be remembered that the sum so applied in reduction of liabilities is just the sum which is fairly within the reach of the gentlemen who are endeavouring to wind up the concern. It is when they come to the last 250,0001. of supposed assets that they.enter upon the regions of romance. For this sum the chief security is Colonel WAuGB's debt, or the property which he may possess, to be applied in satisfaction of the debt. Not one of the open accounts of the Directors has yet been adjusted, although it may be remembered that MIr. STEMrENSS, the Managing Director, and other members. of the Board were equally implicated with Colonel WAvasn althou_gh the advantage they may have derived from theso fraudu4cnt transaetionn has' ben oT less amount. More than the entire of the paid-lup capital had been handed over to Colonel WkAUGH and the defaulting Directors, and the paid-up capital was 250,0001. It is now proposed to meet this difficulty by compelling the Shareholders to give their promissory-notes for a sum equal to 250,0001., and thus the deficiency can be made good in case of the worst. In reduction of this enormous liability there is such property of Colonel WAUon and his brother defaulters as can be made available. Colonel WVAIGH, however, if we remember right, is answerable by himself for something like 270,0001. of the enormous sum which has been Eo scandaiom1ly uisappropriated. The value of his cstate, when it comes to be realized, wil probably faeU ridiculously below the total of his liability. A great amount of misery has been inflited on military men connected with the Indian service in consequence of this failure. The only wonder is how they could ever be induced to trust their property in hands which were so notoriously incompetent, even if they had been clean. Banking business upon the good old system may be safely left in the hands of dull men of routine, and happy are the unambitiouis depositors who are content to intrust their property to such safe custody. Banking on the moderntype, however, is quite a different affair. It requires eonsummate skill and the soundest judgment to keep a concern in credit which is ever on the brink- of insolvency. Now, Colonel WVAtoui was a Captain of Cavalry, and Mr. STZPHXs, the Manager of the Bank, a surgeon also in a eavalry regiment. They have proved themselves capable of perpetrating a great fraud, but wholly unable, as they might a yr-iari have been supposed, to carry on tlhe work of a banking establishment. Colonel VAYUGir, indeed, must havo possessed to no inconsiderable extent the art of attracting, dupes, but this art will scarcely be considered a qualification among men of business, and still less among those who are seeldng for safe investments. He lived in princely splendour. His theatrical cutertainments at Kensington were the talk of the town, his costly establishment on the romantic island in Poole Harbour the talk of the surrounding country. It was supposed, indeed, that there was a screw loose somewhere, but by the profusion of his expenditure, the coolness of his manner, and the audacity of his operations, he contrived for a long time to disconcert suspicion. It is to be regretted that the liquidation has taLen place in plivate, for surely it would not have injured the Shareholders that every circumstance connected with the operations of their bank should have been made public. Can anything affect the credit of such an establishment ? On the other hand, it is surely much for the benefit of the community that all particulars of SO notorious a fraud as this should be made public, and, if it be possible, that the offenders should be brought to justice.
COURT CIRCULAR. _0 - OSBORNE, JuLY 21. The Queen and the Prince Consort, accompanied by Princess Alice and Prince Arthar, drove out in an open caage yesterday afternoon. Iady Macdonald, the Hon.

General Cass, on the other hand, regards sBuh submission as unavoidable. "Walker will bo gently admonished, but not repadiate{3. " The Southern clamourers against Wallker's course will probably organize an independent opposition, for which this Kansas matter is rather a pretext than a reason." A renewal of the riots had occurred on the even- | ing of the 8th, and two of the " rowdies" had been ,hot by the police. The New York Board of Aldermen have adopted a proposition to send an agent to this country to iaaduce theproprietors of the steamship Great Eastern to send that vessel to their port. The funeral of iVir. Marcy at Albany on the 5th inst. was one of the most imposing ever witnessed in that city. Ex-Presidents Van Buren and Pierce, ex-Governors lBouck, Fish, Hunt, and Seward, and many other public men attended. The display of military was very fine. The buildings in the streets through which the ftuneral proecession passed were draped with mourning, and signs of sorrow were visible on every house. At New Orleans a terrific fire was raging on the levee. It broke out in the commission house of Lusk and Co., and the whole block, occupied by Wheeler and Forstall as a foundry, by Lusk and Co. the Cairo Mlail-offce, WValdo and Hughes as a hardware atore, R. .W.

THS COXDEMNSED CRIMr S AT OHELaBSFORD.- Two unhappy beings now await death in our county gaol for the crime of murder, and there has been a very natural desire on the part of the sheriff and other authorities that the two should ba executed on the same day, so as to avoid a repetition of the sad scene. Communications were accordingly opeted with the Secretary of State, who, after maturely considering the subject, was of opinion that the rec,ulation in such cases was imperative, and could not be r4axed. The execution of Crawley for the murder of his wife at Stratford was therefore fixed for Thursday next, the 23d inst., and of Finch for Wednesday, the 29th. A further effort was, however, made to avert what many rogard as the calamity of having two executions. A snemorial to Sir George Grey was signed by the magistrates of the Chehnsford bench on Friday, and at once forwarded to the Home-office; but the reply received yesterday was, that the matter had been maturely weighed in the first instance, and the decision could not be altered. The executions will therefore take place as above stated. Both criminals appear lamentably ignorant, but they are attentive to the rellgious instruction offered them, and evince a feeling bocoming their awful positions. Finch, who is sedulously attended by the Rev. Mlr. Hamilton, the chaplain of the Maol, was yesterday visited by his father, brother, and brother's wife, who were affected in parting from him; and the culprit has also some sisters residing ata ditance, who are likely to attend to take leave of him. Crawley, who as a Roman Catholic is a'tended by the priest from Ingatestone, was visited by one of his sons on Saturday; and he has at the prosent moment another of Isis sons in the same prison undergoing 12 months' hard labonr for felony. As to the statement that Crawley remained indifferent, and made no admission of his guilt, we have received the following letter from the Rev. Canon Last, the Roman Catholic priest who attended him:-"Sir,-You will bh happy, as I am, to be able to correetthe statement respecting the condemned convict Alichael Crawley. In the report of the trial in the Cesntral Criminal Court you will perceive that he admitted by his counsel that his wife had met her death at his hands. He has not concealed his guilt from such as approach him in gaol, and has not failed since his entrance to deplore it and his neglect of his religious duties, and he commissions me now to ask publicly for him a prayer from all who may be charitably disposed to give it, and particulatly from such as mahy be draw;n in any way to witness his execution.

They had, it appears, for some time made a practice of lying in bed to a very late hour, and as they appeared to bo asleep the turnkeys abstained from disturbing them. One morning a tcrnkey, having something to say to Schutte, -went to awaken him, but was surprised to find that the bolster dressed up occupied his place in the bed, and on examining the beds of the other two prisoners he found them similarly cecupied. On investigation it was ascertained that the three prisoners had escaped by the chimney; that n a granary at the top of the building they had found a rope ladder, which must have been placed there by some one connected with tho fortress whom they had gained over; and that they had then let them. selves down into the fosses of the fortress. Thev had then, it ap peared, gone straight to a place called Ne6stadt, about eight miles off, where they breakfasted, after which they psed into P1rssia, and have not since been, heard of. Dr. Schutto left on his table a letter for the commander of the fortress, thanking him for Esla kindness during his confinement, and promising to- let himn .nov through the imewspapers of his definitive retreat. Schutte was under sentence of 2Oyears' imprisonmert for having taken part in the insurrection of Vienna in 1848. .

Where the models a-Te xo many, and the artitil (of course, anonymous) axe so utterly independent of each other, a great variety not only in point of form, but also in the view taken of the sub. ject, may naturally be expected. The prevailing type, we may say, is a tall pedestal, sumounted by the Duke, with four figures at tle base. In this arrangement the Duke is sometimes regarded in his military, sometimes in his civil capacity, is generally clothed in moder uniform, but occasionally an ihe antique tunic. The figures at the baso are Sometimes purely allegorical, representing Victory, Peace, and the like; sometimes they symbolize ihe various countries in which the victories -of Wellington were achieved; sometimes they typify regimentin the British army. One model strangely combines the real andl the ideal, two of the four figures being. orthodox impersonations of Victory and War, while the remaining two are .bevigged dignitaries respectively denoting the "'IoLrds" and the " Commons" of this empire. In many cases tho fancy of the artist has been employed in the decoration of the, pedestal itself, and to this tendency we owe- several basreliefs of celebrated battler, portraits of British Generals, and a- few compositions of moral import Sometimes a detached group is i fron of tbe pedestal, as, 'for mstanc, when we find "Fame directing Time to take note of Waterloo." Sometimes the middle course of ato-reliero is adoptee, and -we could point out & specimei-in which divers significant figures are encaverzned-after a fashion that may remind the irreverend of Punch's ahow.. Thefigure of the Diike generally, as we -have observed, surmotmts the entire monument.. We may add that it is mostly on foot, and that equestrian representations form rare exceptions to a general rule. However, artists are not wanting who have endeavoutred to make the allegorv triumph ovei the reality. Thus, in one place a golden Victory towers over a stone Wellington, asserting her own supreme importance; in another, a stern Britannia is urging the docile General to perform. her behests; in a third, the warrior is so liberally baclked by banners and a crowning figure that at a short distance he vanishes altogether, and leaves the spectator occupied wvith the accessories alone. At the opposite pole to this arrangement may be placed one in which the Duke is principal and accessory as well. On the highest point he stands in the maturity of his glory, and about his pedestal are ranged Egures representing him at various periods of his life. While most of the artists have regarded the Duke as the perfection of military heroism and civil virtue, -are endowing him with the more abstract qualities of a " British worthy," and making him keep company with Oliver Cromwell, Shakspeare, Milton, and Sir Francia Drake,-a few have allowed the idea of death to occur to them, as especially befitting a sepulchral monument. An image of the Duke, dying in the arms of Victgry, on the top of his pedestal, with the words " I have done my duty"s in his mouth, while below him, inL the pedestal, is the door of a vault, pathetically expresses this view of the subject. In another model the Angel of Deathreverentially closesthe door of the tomb, which is guarded by the British lion. The sepulchral notion has in some instances led the artists far away from that general arrangement which we have mentioned as typical of the collection. A few recumbent Wellingtons, wvith hands laid across the breast in medieval style, vary the proud uniformity, and a squat temple raised over the deceased completely inverts the predominant principle. This humble view, of the subject, as we may call it, dwiindles down to its lowest point in a model where the Queen is the chief figure, and a medallion, over' which sbe is mourning, is the sole representative of the hero to whom the monument is dedicated. At the opposite pole to this treatment we may place a tail columnn, spirally curved, 'which elevates the liero like Napoleon in the Place Vendome, or the W'heatsheaf on Fishstreet-hill. Mlost of the models are executed on the presumption that the work will be but of one colour, but a few polychrome and gilded specimens are dotted about the hall. In some cases the employment of materials different in colour is suggested with much taste and knowledge of effect. Whatever opinion may be entertained of the merits of the several models, the quantity of invention that must have been necessary to produce so many combinations, some of them highly elaborate, cannot fail to strike the most indifferent spectator.
T1E I.TE MnB. L&VIE.-On Tuesday morning it was announced in the city that this eminent solicitor had been kiUled by a fall from his horso on Constitution-hill, while taking an early ride preparatory to tbo business of the day. It is but a few vweelks since that we had to lamept tbe death of Mr. James Freshfield, whom, together with Mr. Lavie, most persons would have agrced to nanie as tho two highest authorities on commerdcal law existing in tha city of London. It will not have been forgotten that Mr. Freshflield died, at the age of 5G, of a complaint wlhih was probably induced or aggravated by excessive application to his professional duties. Mr. Lavie has died at about the same age, leaving a- great reputation, and a void which it wfil be dijlicult to supply. The deceased gentleman was not only a solicitor in large practice, and thoroughly master of his work, but ho was also gifted with many talents and accomplishments which enhanced the i;,fluence due to his professional position. He was educated at Eton, where he was highly distinguished as wrell for industry and capacity as for general good conduct. From Eton he went to Christ Churcn College, Oxford, and took his dpgeo in 1823, having obtained a first class in mathematics. At this time he was intended for the bar, but the sudden death of his father, who was a member of the old firm of Crowder, Lave, and Co., induced him to change his views. In order to snpply as far as possible his father's place he enteed the ofice as clerk to llr. Oliverson, then and now, a member of the firm, and after completing his articese, wfas admitted to practice as t solicitcr in Easter Term, 1S27. Mfr. Lavie was a student of Christ Church, and it was at one time probable that he would have been elected ts a fellowshlp at Merton College. Up to the timo of his death hie hel the office of auditor of Christ Churcb, and under this title was the professional adviser of the colle-e, and ho enjoyed in a high degree the friendship and coanbienco of that distinguished body. Ability and industry had won for Mr. Lavie high academio honour, and when he had taken his degree at Oxford and turned his thoughts to tho bar, his ovvnpowers, and the position of his father, as an eminent solicitor in London, appeared to promise him an early and great success. Bubn on his father's death he sacrificed wbatever hopes he may have cherished of the moro splendid. triumphs of the bar, and devoted himself to supply to his family, as far as possible, the heavy loss they had sustained. To this duty he was constant throughout his life, and we have been informed that he remained unmarried, in order to discharge more completely the obligation he had taken upon himzelf of providing for those whom his fatber's death had left in embarrassed circumstances. To the profession which ho thus adopted, rather under a sense of duty than from choice, Mr. LAvio brought the sarno assiduity and the samo capacity which he had displayed at Eton and at Oxford. For many years past ho has been the professional advisor of a large number of the leading commercial establishments of the city of London, and also of many of the great mercantilo firms of Soot. land, Ireland, and the provinces. He was a member of the council of the Incorporated Law Society, and always attended the disenssion of questions which were deemed to lie within his peculiar province. He also acted in his turn as an examiner of the candidates for admission. Mr. Lavie was a member of the Royal Commission, apointed in S54 to inquire into the arrangements for law stady in the Inns of Court, beingthe only solicitor who assisted in that investigation. In the appendix to the report will ba found a statement of MIr. Lavie's own opinion, which must convince every reader that the author of it was a very able man. We need not repeat the melancholy details of 3r. L3vie's death, which havc appeared in tho daily papers. It may, perhaps, appear rather strange to hear of a solicitor riding in the park at 10 in'the morning, at which hour most mon are either at or making their way to their offices. But it was Mr. Lavie's habit to take exercise at this time and to go into the city at 11 or 12 o'clock and to stay there much beyond the usual hoar. He was a verY early riser and had been all his life a most hardsworking man, although his hours of labour wero not exactly those most usually adopted. - It i3 satisfactory to know tat there Is-no ground for Imputing delay or a lsot to anyone who was near the scene of the fatal acoident. The injury was so severe as to admit of neither remedy nor hope, * and the unfortunate -genitleman ws lnsensi bJesad painless from the moment of falling from his horse. This sad event oecurrea very near the spot which proved fatal to -the late Sir -lobert Peel. We habve keara that when an underlduate at Oxford Mr.. Lavie received a severo injury while riding, caused by his horse suddenly throwing back its head and striking him vlolently on the face. One of his eyes was very seriously dasuiged by the blow, and his sight was permanently impairod by it. For ,si months he W;es absolutely forbidden to look into a book, and he spent the Interval at Tours, acquiring a mastery of the French language, which proved most valuable to -him afterwards in his business.--olicitore Journcal.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMESOFFIOE, Wedmsday Ato7ing. FRANCE. (BY SUBMARINE AND BlItrIE T1EGPH.) We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Paris correspondent:- " PARIS, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 8 A.M. "The Moniteur contains the following :- "'For more than a month the police has had proof that a plot had been formed in London to make an attempt on the life of the Emperor. Three Italians, charged with the execution of this horrible project, were at Paris, and arrested. The arms also which were to have been used for the perpetation of the crime have been seized; they consist of poinards, revolvers, &c. Brought to justice, the prisoners had already confessed their crime and revealed the names of their accomplices. The Government notwithstanding suspended the proceedings against them, in order that the gelt of the process might not be regarded as a means of influenoing the result of the elections which were about to take place. Theproceedings are nowresumed, and an ordinance of the Judge of Instruction has sent before the Chamber of Accusation all the prisoners arrested, with their accomplices. Their names are Tibaldi, Bartolotti, GriUi (otherwise Saro), Mazzini, Ledra Rollin, Mazarenti, and Campanella.") EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The folowing is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 6 p.m._. A letter from Algiers of the 13th inst. gives full details relative to the harvest throughout the French possessions in Algeria. In the province of the east the crops have fuUy realized the promises of the spring. Wheat and barley have already appeared in large quantities on the market of Bona, and a considerable fall in price has followed. The farms in the district of Guelma are well cultivated, and the harvest most abundant. In the circle of Souk Arras the crops are rich beyond exarmple. In the direction of Bathna abundance appears both on the mountains and in the valleys. The wheat particularly is magnificent both as respects stalk-head and grain. The crops have failed only in the Hadna. In that locality there isno barley, and the wheat will yield but little. At AInBeida the grain has been brought to maturit by the happy occurrence of rain and sunshine alternately, and wil give a remunerative return to the cultivator. The harvest is completed at Biskra, and has exceeded the produce of last year by onefifth. Both wheat and barley are of excellent qua lity. A great yield is expected in the Setif, although soeie localities in the neighbourhood of the mountains of Bou-Thaleb have suffered from hailstorms. A number of the Ouled Nails had come down to offer their assistance to their countrymen in gathering in the harvest. The good harvest In the district of Constantine has already reduced prices, which were excessively bigh in that town. At Djidjelly barley is the prevailing crop; there is but little wheat, but what there is is of xcellent quality. The barley is already cut. In the circle of Philippeville the last surveys show that there are 15,000 more acres under wheat than last year. The accounts from the western province are also satisfactory, although the inundations in May last gave soMe cause for uneasiness. The harvest in the circle of Tiaret has exceeded the expectations of the Fellahs. The wheat and barley are everywhere magnificent, and indemnifythe Arabs for the loss in cattle they suffered last winter. The severity of the weather from the 24th of December to the end of March did not permit the natives to cultivate their farms, consequently in that locality the number of acres under wheat is not as great as It was last year. Nevertheless, there were 4.000 ploughs employed. The harvest is gathered in on all points of the circle of Saida. It comes up to the general expectation, in spite of the damage caused by inundations in the low lands and by hailstorms on the hills in May last. The labour undertaken in the circle of Geryville by the tribes of the Sahara has succeeded. Owing to the heavy rains last winter those lands which cannot be irrigated have produced wheat and barley not inferior to that in the Tell. The crops in the circle of Mascara are greatly superior to those of the year 1856. The wheat in the plain of Ceirat has attained a size hardly ever before seen in that country. The crops are remarkably fine in the circle of Themcen, and the markets have in consequence faUen considerably. The harvest in the Lalla Magbrina has produced more than in any year since 1830. The crops are exceedingly fine throughout the entire circle of Nomours. The wheat particularly is finer than for any prouIoas year. The barley has suffered a little at Nedroma, and also in the mountains, in consequence of the heavy rain last -wiuter. The harvest is abundant in the circle of Oran, notwithstanding the late rains; and the plain of the Mieta presents an appearance such as had not been witnessed for several years. A demand has been presented to the Council of State for the payment of a sum of 1,700,000f. on account of the mission of M. de Morny to Russia. 1,700,000f., or 68,0001., is a very handsome sum. It is not said whether it comprises the whole of the money the mission cost the country. The vouchers (or pieces jstiificatives);do not, I believe,rusually accompany the demand to the Council of State. They are coramunicated to the Cour des Comptes when the time comes for that tribunal to investigate the claim, with a view to allow or disallow it. This decision will not be probably before three or four years. France, it was said in 1844, after the bombardment of Mogador, is ever richl enough to pay for her own glory. If sho murmur on the vulgar plea of economy at the sum this mission cost, it is to be'feared that the glory of having Count de Mormy as her representative is not appreciated by her as it ought. M, de Mormy does her a favour in accepting tho functions of her representative, and the honours and advantages accruing therefrom, and few patriots have made such sacrifices for the welfare of their conutry. A despatch from the French Charge d'Afi.ires at St. Petersburg announces that the difaculty which had arisen between the Russian authorities and some French subjects who remained at Sebastopol and Kamiesch after the evacuation by the almes, has been completely arranged. The Director-General of Naval Constructions in oronstadt has arrived in Paris, and the Russian Minister of Marine is said to be at Havre, engaged ia completing the investigations commenced by the Grand Duke Constantine. The Councils-General of the Departments are Convoked for the 24th of August. The Emperor's visit to Osborne is fixed for the 4th. The Pays, Government paper, contradicts the statement of the Nord, of Brussels, of this day, that in consequence of a counter-order sent from ConstantInople] the elections in Moldavia had commenced on the 12th Inst. The Empress was present lut evening at the representatiOn of the drama Les (hevaUiers Cdu brouil lard, at the theatre of the Porte St. Mrtin. The following private telegraphic despatch has been received:- " MADRID, J-uiY 20. T,he law relative to tho cOnstitxtlon reform has been signed by Her Modesty. "eThe Holy Father has sanctoned the sale of the cck. sicstial properties made previously." Marshal Vaniant, Minister Of War, has received a report from the Governor-Ceneral of Algeria, dated Temesguida, Beni-Thouray, 14th, giving an account of the proceedings of Generals Yusuf and Renault, already made kruown by electric tele. graph. After mentioning that a number of fresh submissions had been made, Marshal Randon goes on to say that he had fixed on the l11th for making a general attack on the other unsubmitted tribes, and gives the following account of the movements of the different divisions3- " In the morning of the 11th, tho division MIaisslat left the Col de Chellata and marched to meet that of General M'Mahon and to attack the villages of the Illoula, which was done wlth full success, and the chiefs of the tribe soon after came in and made their submisson. During the,, movements the divisions of Generas Renault and Yusuf invaded the country of the Illiten. The ground was so irregular that all the baggage and horses were left in the camp under a strong guard, and the generals and other field-officers marched on foot at the head of their troops. At 4 o'clock In the morning the column of attack of General Renault carried the entrenched villages of Igril, Sidi-Aly, and Ait-Haman. The enemy left several dead in our hands and removed a number during the combat. On the left of General Renault ourEabyle contingents attacked thevillagesof Oued-YacoubandTiziGuefri and gained pOssession of them after a sharp resistance, with a loss of five kdlled, and slx wounded. General Renault, being master of all the villages on the left bank of the Oued-Tifilcout, crossed the ravine and carried the vllage of Tifilcout, with the loss of only one man killed and nine wounded. The enemy were now flying in every direction, closely pursued by oar troops, who were constantly bringing in prisoners in ilocks. By 8 o'clock in the morning the enemy had been drlven from ali their positions, and our troops were bivouacked in the most advantageous points in order to command the country." The despatch concludes by saying that all the Kabyle tribes have now recognized the authority of France, and appear disposed to enter on a path of progress. The Moniteur de 1As'/r,ne, in speaking of one o° the tribes lately conquered in Eabylia, says:- " The Fraoussen pretend to have derived their name from the French. Their flag is white with a fleur-de-lys in the centre, and their arms are almost aU ornamented with the same emblem. One of their chiefs has the arms of the Montmorency, and he states that he is desocnded from a French officer, who came into Africa centuries ago, and was made prisoner. This ssertion must bo taken for what it is worth, but there may b3 some truth at the botoma of It; as how can we otherwise explain the fleur-de-lys and these arms, the Arabs not having any ?1 The law imposing a tax on the transfer of railway and other securities having stated that a Government regulation would be published for the execu. tion of the said measure, the Monitekur now con. tains an Imperial decree on the subject. The following are the principal provisions:- " All companies and other industrial enterprises whoso shares and bonds are liable to the transfer duty must make, at the registration-office of the place where their establish. ment is situate, a declaration stating the object and duration of the company or enterprise, the date of its first formation, the names of its directors, and the number of shares and bonds it has issued. This deolara. tion must be made before the 15th August for those companies or enterprises which were In existence before the promulgation of the new law, and for new companies within one month of their definitive formation. The duty of 20c. per 100f. on the transfor of nominative shares and bonds, as well as on the conversions of these securities, must be paid by the companies or enterprises at the above-named registra. tion-office within 20 days after the expiration of each three months. The payment must be accompanied by a list con. taining the date of each operation, the number of shares and bonds transferred or converted, and the price of each transfer, or the value of the shares and bonds converted. The value of the shares and bonds converted is to hestablished according to the average price at the Bourso on the day previous to the conversion.

The Chambers met yesterday merely to hear General INarvaez read the decree, reproduced iu to-day's Gazette, by which " the Legislature of 1857 is declared terminated," a form of expression that would seem to imply that the Cortes will not meet again this year. It is thought, however, that they will reassemble in October or Ngovember previouely to the accouch7njent of the Queen. A deputation from the corporation of Seville, accompanied by the deputies for that province, aud bearing a petition signed by nearly 3,000 persons, waited yesterday upon the Duke of Valencia, to entreat him to use his influence with the Queen to stop the executions in Andalusia. Another petition, signed by the women of Seville, had been sent to the Queen. In reply to the deputation, General Narvaez read a Royal order, dated the previous day, which enjoined the authorities of Seville to put no one else to death without previous communication with the Government. That enough has certainly been already done to strlke terror and deter from similar in rection will be admitted by all who read the followlng paragraph from the a of Cadiz :- " The prisoners were conducted in carts to the Prado of St. Sebastian. There they were drawn up in line, and a company fired upon them. It happeed that the volley khled two persons, who, eluding the vigilance of the sent,. nels placed to keep the ground, had got in rear of the crimi. nals. The deaths tht have taken plueg in conasquegig oi the insurrection amount to 9S; 25 in the affair of Benaojan; one shot in the fist instance in Seovill; 24 on Saturday; 18 on the13th; 15 at UtrIra; 13 at Arabal; and the two killed by acoident." It is high time indeed that the Government should show a little mercy. The Cortes closed, the press gagged, the paltry flame of the Andalusian insurrection quenched in streams of blood, we may expect a period of political stagnation, varied only by the intriguwes which are prominent in Spanish palaces and Ministries. For some time past people have been flying from Madrid, chiefly northwards, in which direction mails and diligencies are still booked full fo' weeks to come. We have had a rather uncommon Eeason here, less heat than usual, but a great deal of wind, drying and irritating, noxious, as I believe, both to the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and which I have observed to parch up and wither plants exposed toit as effectually as if they had been left in the full blaze of the sun. The heat, however, has not been very great, but is now rapidly increasing. The thermometer yesterday was over 100 deg. In the shade; to-day, judging from one'S, sensations, it Is somewhat higher, and doubtless, before the month is out, it will touch 110 deg., the usual dog-day temperature here. The Duke of Rivas is expected to leave for Parli on Sunday. Lord Howden goes at the beginning of next week. Mr. Otway was yesterday presented to Senor Pidal as Charge d'Affares. Another newspaper, the Criario, has oeased to appear. It in reported that the Spanish Government is about to give orders for the exclusion from Spain of certain foreign journals which have given umbrage by telling the truth about the affairs of this country.

THE BENGAL MUTINIES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. J3ir,-After all the discussion upon the Iudiau mutlnies there are practically but two questions before the public :-How can England best aid in reconquering India? What policy for the future ought to be urged upon the Indian authorities ? 1. The Government of India obviously requires two things,-more Europeans and more artillery. The only point for discussion is the extent of the force to be despatched. To estimate it we must estimate, first, the amount of resistane to be overcome, and, secondly, the force already in the country. We have, I greatly fear, to destroy as well as defeat an army of 90,000 men, well armed, with a tincture of discipline, and with, for aught we know, an undeveloped Hyder Ali in their ranks. I cannot reckon the numbers less, for the regiments not in mutiny require as careful watching as those which are. 'his immense army must not only be defeated, but subjugated, or destroyed so atrikinglyas at once to restore our lmpairedprestige. This is the first task, and to this the European foroe now in Bengal, could we concentrate it, would be amply sufficient. The disproportion of numbers would be only three to one, and if Europeans, when one to three of Asiatics, cannot defeat them we had better quit Asia. But unfortunately this is only a portion of our task. We have also to restrain an armed and bloodthirsty rabble in some 25 stations. By concentrating the Europeanofficials and their families in Agra, Lahore, Chunar, and other towns with fortresses, we may materially diminish this number. But we have still to maintain posts which from their scattered position will draw off at least a clear half of our force. The balance rpit be supplied from England. I believe that whtli 15,000 effective men or a nominal addition of 20,000 the Indian Government could meet a revolt of the entire line, crush it, re-organize the native army, and yet never suspend civil government during the process. That number, therefore, should be sent at once in the fastest vessels we can obtain. For precisely the same reasons a strong body of artillerymen-there are plenty of gunsahould be despatched, if possible, in steamors. Every artillerist is in India worth at least three bayonets. Thus much we are told in Parlainent has been done. But we can do much more. The despatch of a steam squadron has excited some ridicule. Stearaers it is said, can only reach Calcutta, and the force is wanted in the north-west. I cannot agree In that opinion. Five armed vessels anchored off the Mint Ghaut would render an Insurrection in Calcutta itself an impossibility. There is little probability, ft is true, of any such occurrence. Strange to say, there has never yet been even a street riot in Calcutta. For a hundred years not even a mob has ever been collected. Still there must be in the town some 40,000 armed scoundrels, the refuse of the north-west, who would stake their lives readily on the chnce of a week's pillage. The town is immensely wealthy, and a fire among the shipping in the river would cost us 5,000,0001. sterlIng. It is essential that the rabble should feel that Calcutta les at our mercy, and this feelingthearmed frigates will produce. Sailors, too, are admirable allies in a street row. But the fleet might do more than this. Frigates cannot get up the rivers, but the gunboats built for the shallows can. Ten of these boats would enable us to render insurrection impossible in Patna, Moorshedabad, Benares, Allahabad, and perhapsbut I am not sure-in Dacca. In Benares or Allahabad, especially, one such boat would render resistance hopeless. The sacred buildings in one city and the great bazaars In the other would be destroyed by the first broadside. I need not point to the importance of Patna, notoriously discontented as lt is. That city, moreover, would be the etep6t of a Nepaulese army, should Jung Bahadoor take advantagRe of the confuslon to pour into the plains. That calainity is not only possible, but probable. There is one European regiment between Eatmndoo and Calcutta and Jung Bahadoor is an Asiatic smarting under defeat or partial succes in his Thibetan expeditions. Of course, shells and military stores of the kind imported from Europe wil accompany the expedition; but I suspect thre Is a point less thought of. What is Lord Canning to do for money? It is easy to talk about balances, but even if they were realities-and they are not-he could not get them. He must pay the sepoys and irregulars; he must pay the interest of the debt, and in Calcutta. He must have a reserve of treasure to meet sudden demands. For all this he has the revenue of Bengal proper, and the result of the opium and salt sales. dras ana Bombay can help him but little, and as to a loan, even at 7 per cent., he would find it for I the hour distrusted. The easiest wayof raising money would be to sell biUls on the English Government. This measure might produce large sums, for this reason,-every nativa capitalist knows that in the event of a military outbreak his hoard will be taken from him; he will therefore be too glad to invest his money in bills payable in England, where they can remain out of harm's way till the trouble is over. Authority to draw in this way should there. fore, I conceive, be given to the Governor-General. I doubt if permision to draw on the India-house will be sufficient. The natives will fancy that the Company cannot honour the drauahts. Money in specie will, I fear, be one of Lord Canning's difficulties. With men, artilery, and money supplied the insurrection cannot last long. When suppressed a new task will have to be undertaken-a task infinitelv more difficult than any operation in the field; I mean the re-organization of the Bengal army. It is necessary at the very outset of this great work to decide one point. Is the reform to be complete, equal to the emergency, or is it to be a mere palliative 7 Is our position in India to be one of unquestioned dominance, or is it to be one of dominance as long as our own native servants choose to obey? If the latter object only is to be sought our course is clear. Let the few regiments of the liae apparently faithful remain. Fill the place of the mutineers by irregular regiments, and there leave the subject. We shall then be safe till the irregulars feel their strength as the line men have felt theirs. The next revolt in that case will differ from the present only in this,-it will have competent native leaders. The native officer of a line regiment in Bengal is a superannuated private. The native officer of irregulars is a young well-born soldier, able to command, because placed in command at five and twenty. If the former course Is to be adopted-if we are to be dominant in India, so dominant that rebellion, except of the whole population, is impossible-our course is equally clear. We have three things to do, accordingly, in the next five years:- 1. We must increase the Europeans by 30,000 men. I will not arxge in favour of an increase ,er se; that is conceded. But my reason for fixin that number is this .-It will raise the proportion of Europeans to the old standard of one in three. We must have 180,000 men, and of these, to secure absolute safety, 60,000 must be Europeans. That wil leave 5,000 men for a permanent protection to the capital, 5,000 for Bengal,-at present totallydenuded,-10,000 to hold down the north-west, and 10,000 in the hills, ready to pour down on any threatened point. The force of trained artilcrists should at the same time be tripled. The Government of India possesses perhaps more cannon than any Potentate on earth; but cannon are simply a nuisance without men to work them, and those men, unllike the rank and file, require time, much time, to train. 2. Extinguish the Bengal line. No half measure can in this portion of the reform succeed. Onethird of that line has revolted or deserted, 20,000 more have been disarmed. Are you going to arm regiments thus dishonoured again? They must be dismissed, with pension or without, unless you intend to meet them with the shame of dishonour to inflame their discontent. Stop the recruiting for the remainder, and in a few years the army now sO dangerous must be extinct. For external warfare its place is amply supplied by the additional force of Europeans. For internal police raise as many irregular regiments as are required, to be commanded by men selected from over-officered European battalions. These men, better managed with absolute commanding officers and promotion by merit, will not be inclined to revolt. If they are, they revolt ag,ainst a European force half their own in nubers. 3. Dislarm India Do it inthe firstflush of suec ,csas, when the European force is in full activity. Do it at once by the high hand, making confiscation the penalty of concealing arms. It maay be argued that such a measure would bo impracticable. Sir J. Lawrence did it in three months. Be disarmed I most hlmtLa1 cein India (20,000,000 of them) without a disturbance. It is not necessary to takeaway the swords; take away the firearms. The moment they are given up make the manufacture or import of muskets, mnatchloeks, or jezails, except upon Go. vernment account, a penal offence. You could suppress it much more easily than the manufacture of salt. They cannot come in by sea. The passes are in our own hands. There is no oppression in the measure. It is carried out partly by etiquette, partly by law, in the British isles. It has been done in the Punjab. Once carried out, Insurrection becomes impossible. This I regard as the first and greatest of our new Indian necessities. A1GLO-BENGALEE.
TO THE EDITOB Or TZHE TIMES Sir,-At a time when the whole country is speculating as to the real causes of the mutiny now or lately raging in Bengal, and while in Parliament and by The Tinmes it seems to be assumed that our civilians and officers in India have been deceived, | blinded, and taken by surprise, it becomes a simple act of justice to offer a few brief words of explana. tion, such as, I trust, wi produce conviction and exonerate from the charge of supineness the Executive now carrying out the civil and military details of our government in the East. It seems quite to be overlooked that insubordinate and mutinous tendencies in the Native Army ar not in reality so novel and strange to us as many suppose, for we have been at any time during the last 40 years on the very verge of interna convulsion as strong, fierce, and formidable as the present, and in the success of this mutiny alone is to bo perceived the difference between the former and the more recent desire displayed for the overthrow of our rule. Let me in proof of this advert to some of the better known attempts in which this feeling has been plainly shown. In 1824 we had the Barrackpore mutiny. On that occasion a vigour and energy was displayed which has since been characterized as harsh and bloody. I believe it was simply necessary, but I have no intention to enter at this time into any argument in reference to it. The next ymptoms of uneasy feeling, folowing closely on the other, were in 1825-26, when, if we had failed in taking Bhurtpore-.as was fuly anticipated by the natives generally-our rule and supremacy would have received a severe shock, and the fidelity of the Sepoys was, in that event, thought by many to be moat queaStionable. The fears and anxiety with which the tidings from Bhurtpore were looked for by many offlcers of rank of that day I can well remember, and one of my oldest and moat intimate friends, now holding an important command in India, years ago detailed to me the confession subsequently made to him of a consDiracy, shared in by his regiment generally, to muraer all the Euroean officers of the corps excepting, I think, two, who were especial favourites; and if the celebrated fortre3s I have adverted to had not fallen-if reverse and conspiracy had in those days overtaken us, may we not reasonably conclude that scenes similar to those which now harrow us would then, in like manner, have occurred ? For one, I am fully impressed with the conviction that for very many years we have at any moment been subject to this explosion. Upon chance or circumstance alone depended the how, when, and where. To proceed. We had, not many years ago, the Scinde mutiny-a very formidable business. We had other less important indications of Insubordination and ill-will; and more recently, did not Sir Charles Napier energetically contend that 40,000 Sepoys in the Punjab were to a man, ripe for revolt a There was no tangible or precise proof of it, but that the feeling was there-that a favourable opportunity would at once have evolved it, many besides Sir Charles confidently believed; and I assert that it is upon such a mine, liable at any convenient moment to explode, we have all along been resting. It may be contended that this being so2 it was the duty of those entertaining the opinion boldly to proclanim aloud their conviction and to advocate a change; but I presume to dispute the correctaess of any such assumption. In Sir Charles Napier's case, the very existence of such a feeling among the Sepoys was authoritatively contradicted and denied by the Governor-General (Lord Dalhousio); and it must be admitted that his ordship had no proofs before him to warrant, as he thought, Sir Charles's statement, or even to enable him fairly to draw any such inference. By a happy combination of circumstances the mutiny at that time of the 66th Regiment was rendered harmless; and it was doubtless not considered politic to admit that the Sepoy army was so tainted as to be ripe for the wholesale revolt Sir Charles, with an intuitive and just perception, had so wonderfully divined. Ibelieve firmly that he was right in his judgment, but, as I have said, there was no precise evidence, and thus things have gone on until now. 15 months ago, when I relinquished the post of AdjutantGeneral of the Bengal Army, the maost entire calm existed; the repose and apparent contentment of the Sepoys were perfect ; from Peshawonr to Calcutta all was thoroughly quiet; but the truth is that even then one little cloud, the forerunner of many others, was appearing in the horizon. General Amson anxiously desired to innovate; his predeoessor had been harshly charged with supmeness and a lethargic apathy; his own he designed should be a reign of a very different description, and he attempted to commence it with a curtailment of the leave or furlough annuaUy granted to the Sepoys,-a very hasty and injudicious beginning, and apparently so considered by more than myself, for it was then negatived, though I have since heard that at a later period it was successfully advocated. I am doing no injustice to General Anson in making, at this great crisis, and as a matter of duty to the public, the above statement; for what I have said is on record. I have no feeling of enmity to the late General Anson whatever, for he was always kind and cordial; and in a public general order to the army on my departure he most flatteringly expressed his great personal regret at what he was pleased to call my loss; buttruth compels me to say that he was extremely ill qualified for the very arduous tasks entrusted to him-the control that is of a large armny of mercenaries, quick to observe, highly impulsive, and pampered by most injudicious and wasteful allowances into a fancied equality with the European soldiery. It may appear very presumptuous to offer this opinionof GeneralAnson'suinfitness, but boththeresults of his command and his antecedents are in proof that a vast weight of responsibility rests upon those who appointed to this important commanda General so utterly inexperienced in practical military affairs. The service of the State is disregarded when in the exercise of patronage such appointments are made, and in a crisis their evil effects are made manifest in the loss and disgrace which follow. General Anson, I am enabled to state, left the Plains and went Up to Simlah without making any preparation for the coming struggle, even although he had himself addressed the Government representing that the S3poys at IJmbaUah and in other places were mutinous and disaffected. I venture to say it will be found on inquiry that he was quite unequal to the occasion; and painful as it is to point to the wealness of one who was talented, amiable, and gentlemanly, it is yet due to the country and to those whose sons and daughters and kith and Idndred are being sacrificed in India to expose the favouritism which in high places has led to many such appointments. Much has been said to the effect that " hogs' lard and cartridges " have had nothing to do with this mutiny. I think that part of the question has never yet been correctly set before the public. My own conviction is that this piece of culpable negligence was as the lighted match to a magazine of powder. The natives generally, and the Native Army in particular, have been recently strong,ly impressed.- however they came by it-with the idea that it was intended too subvert their religion and to make the army converts to Christianity. With this idea prevailing, the discovery that impure matter was mixed up wholesale for the lubrication of the cartridges would at once and naturally be pointed to as a conclusive proof of the deslgn ofthe Government to rob them of their caste as a preparatory meaaure; and I do not think there can be the least doubt that in this sense the discovery was aecepted, and confirmed to their minds by the omission of any direct e4lanatio4 on the part of the s3tate in reference, as they considered it, to the pollution Irepared for them. The recent legislation, so comparatively rapid, on questions intimately connected with the relgion and feelings of the natives, together with the wholesale changes Introduced into the system of native education in Bengal, with the imprudent and injudicious conduct of certain weak and foolish bigots among us, have been amply sufficient to dispose the Sepoys for the reception of the strongest impressions adverse to our rule. The priestly and religious feeling is, next to their notorious vice of covetous avarice, the dominating principle among the Sepoy; in fact in anmost every regiment the Braluinical influence, a very subtle one, has been for years and years, dangerously great, though I assert, confidently that the present generatioa of offlcers aro not rensponsible for this vicious system-they found it, and have hlad to mnake the best of it. To have declared too openly against it would simply have been to produce, perhaps, just such a convulsion as from other causes has now sO miserably overtaken us, while the gradual bit-by-bit attempts to neutralize the strength of the htgh caste Sepoy regulars have failed of their anticipated effects through insufliciencY and the vice of the system. In a word, to retrace our steps was thought to be as dangerous to us as to proceed, and many of those best acquainted with the hollowness of our position were thus kept in a state of vacillation, doubting whether the danger would not be greater iD. soundng the alarm than n trusting hopefully in Providence. That this reasoning was weak i apparent, but it would have r-equired far moremoral courage than most of us are blessed with to dare the reproaches and the consequences of a sufficiently strong denunciation. Moreover it would have been not only dangerous to take tnat course, but ineffectual; for m high places and in low-everywhere in shortour sup posed interests, our fears, and our wishes were arrayed in aupport of the oxisting state of things. Bat now, now we have the opportunity. The credulous, the weak, and the timnid mnust all alike see that Pr etorian mercenarics are untrustworthy, and that if we are to preserve our IndianEmpire we must exercise for the future a far sternercontrol and authority. I have already in this letter trespassed at too great a length on your space, and will not, therefore, advert to the changes rendered absolutely necessary by this exposure of the blind and supine confidence inwhich we have hitherto reposed. They are, or should be, obvious ; and I hope no timikt fears will Interfere to prevent our dealing with the Bengal Native Army as its demerits now demand. With the fall of Delhi and the arrival of so many Europeans, we shall, I trust, have the power to do so, and we may entertain a welu-grounded confidence in the exertions and bravery of the officers and men now so gallantly struggling to maintain our suIpremacy. Over all we have General Grant for the moment. At Peshawur we have that excellent officer Brigadier-General Cotton, of Her MajesWs service, in command. Before Delhi we have another Royal officer of reputation and experience. At Cawnpore and Lucknow we have admirable officers in the persons of Sir Hugh Wheeler and Sir Henry i Lawrence ; and at the Presidency a tried veteran,f General Hearsey. Mlany dear and valuable lives will have been doubtless sacrificed, but the victory will very shortly, under Providence, be with us,, and we should be firm and earnest to take prompt, just, and wise advantage of it. I am, Sir, yours faithfully, . T. TUCKER. Dodington Vicrage, July 19. Major-General.

The first count in the indictment charged them with brealking into the shop of WMilam Davidson, ironmonger, which they entered through a hole made in the floor in a cellar underneath, and to which they had obtained access by a false key, and from which shop they stole a great variety of keys and Implements. They were next charged with having entered the shop of Mr. J. F. Calder, watebmaker and ]eweller, Lawnmarket, by a hole cut in the roof, from vacant premises above, also opened by a false key, and from which shop they stole about 6001 worth of Jewelry. The third and fourth counts charged them with aving first obtained access by false keys to the clasa-room of r. Roland, fencing master, South-bridge, and thence breaking through to tho shop of Messrs. Mason and Co., tea. dealers, from which they stole both tea and money, and from these premises to the shop of Er. W. Darling, jeweller, from which a great quantity of geld, silver, and plated goods wrasstolen. 'inally, they were charged with having broken into the shop in Prince's-street occupied by M1rs. Lenuie, optician and jeweller, by making an opening through the roof ofaprojecting portion of the shop, and, having thus obtained entrance, stolen about 540 gold rings, about 168 gold chains, 21 silver chaius, five gold plated chains, 8 gold lockets, 108 gold studs, 70 gold peneilcases, 100 gold keys and seals, from 150 to 200 gold brooches, a great varlety of braceets, and other articles of jewelry, the value of the whole being estimated at 1,5001. these roboeries extended from November, 1856, to February, 1857, and about that period a considerable alarm was felt in the town for the safety of shop property i Edinburgh. The numerous burglaries were t en universally ascribed to the operation of the ticket-of-leave system, and no clue to the thieves was obtained till April, when it became a matter of considerable surprise to the public to learn that the police had traced the depredations, not to returned convicts, but to artisans before believed to be respectable men, and who had never been suspected bytho polce. The accident which led to the discovery of the thieves was a somewhateurious one. In the Queen'spark some earth had been scraped upby a dog, and something was disclosed beneath which happened to meet the eye of one of the parkrangers On the earth being removed a square tin box was discovered, with a funnel mouth corked up, but wide enough to admit the arm, SO that if the box were buried it would be snfficient to omen the aperture of the fumnel to get at its contents. The box was filled with jewelry, which was identified partly by Mrs. Lennie and partly by the other sufferers from these burglaries. The maker of the box was then inquired for by the police, and was in a short time found, and from his statement the police were enabled to apprehend the prisoners. In their possession was found a large quantity of stolen property, besides large bunches of rifled and skeleton keys, crowbars, and rope ladders. From various pawnbrokers in Edinburgh and Glasgow an additional quantity of the property was recovered. After a trial on Monday, extending from 11 &m. to 11 p.m., the jury found the charges proved in so far as they applied to the housebreaizngs at Calder's, Darling's, and Lennie's, no evidence on the other charges having been called. T Lord Justice General, who expressed concurrence iu the verdict, sentenced the prisoners to 21 yeara' penal servitude each. MLLANCHOLY CASE 01' DROWNNG.-A sad event occurred on Thursday morning, the 16th inst., at Carr Mill-dam, a Large reservoir of water, situate on the estate of Sir R. T. Gerrard, Bart., and midway between St. Helen's and Bllinge. Mr. Samuel Gaskell, a solicitor, in practice at St. Helen's, and his clerk, an intelligent lad of the namo of George Dixon, aged about 14 years, went to fish with rod and line at the dam early on Thursday morning, accompanied by the brother of the former, Mr. Allanson Gaskell, surgeon, who shortly after partaking of some luncheon in a little hut there, about 8 o'clock, left them to vislt his patients. In the afternoon MIr. Allanson Gaskell became alarmed at hs brother's prolonged absence, and about 3 o'clock he went again to the dam, when he saw his brother's hat floatiag on the water, and the boy's clothing lying on tho embankment clOeO by. HIe returned to St. Helen's, and informed Superintendent Jervis of his apprehensions, and thaLt goeatleman immediately proceeded to Carr Mill, and there found Mr. A. Gasl-ell's fear toe truly realized. At the top end of the dam, which at'that point becomnes narrow, and in the centre deep, lay sidle by side, the twro dead bodies of Mr. Samuel Gaske l and his clerk. They were drawn otut with the g-rappling irons the former withi all his clothes on, and a strong line, probably used for catching pke, tightly wrapped round his arms and body, andl attachedto the wrist of the boy, who was naked. The bat was found stol floating, andl near the st where the bodies were discoverea were found a rod and lne, and a fish caught at the end of the line.

JWfONY-MARBET ani CITYINTALLIGENCE. Tuesday Evening. The funds have been less firm to-day, but they have not experienced any material decline. Consols for money opened at the improved price of last evening-91~ to 92, and the last bargains were at 911 to X for money, and 92 to i for the G5th of August. A dtelivery of stock on account of the Court of Chancery, coupled with a few additional sales, caused loans to be in demand at 5 per ceut., and the receipt of lower prices from Paris al8o tended to deprive the market of its buoyancy. In discount transactions there was no alteration. Bank Stock left cff at 214j to 216 ; Reduced, 92 to J; New Three per Cents., 92 to J; India Stock, 216 to 218; India Bonds, 20s. to 10s. discoiunt; and Exchequer-bills, 5s. discount to par. The market for foreign securities has been inanimate, and few bargains have taken place, except in Turkish, which experienced a slight further decline. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were again rather weak. Peruvian Three per Cents. were purchased at 55, being i per cent. below the last official transaction. Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 1852, were negotiated at 961 ; Granada Deferred, 6; Spanish, 40 ; the Certificates, 5X ; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 95k, 4, and J; the F our per C ents. Guaranteed, 102.j and ; and for the account, 102k; and Dutch Two-andi-a-Half per Cents., 64§ and (G4.p In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate for Amsterdam was a shade lower; Hambuirg, on the other hand, had an upward tendency. There was no other change of importance. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this eveLing were 67f. 45c. for money and 67f. 40c. for the end of the month, showing a renewal of speculative sales and a decline of a quarter per cent. The present state of the India question leads to inquiries as to the position in which the various securities connected with that Empire-such as India Stock, India Bonds, the territorial debt, &c., relatively stand. The capital represented by India Stock is nominally 12,000,0001., worth, at its present price of 217, 26,000,0001. The amount of the home Bond debt is 3,900,0001., of which, however, a portion is held by the company in reserve. The territorial debt-that is to say, the total of loans contracted in India-is 50,000,0001. These three classes of securities constitute the entire public liabilities of the India Company, with the exception of the 44 and 5 per cent. guarantees, on something less than 20,000,0001. of railway shares. The first-namely, India Stock, exists under the following arrangement: -Bythe Act of 1833, which extinguished the trading powers of the company, it was stipulated that a ,dividend of 10i per cent. per annum on their capital of 12,000,0001. should be secured as a frst charge on the revenues of India, subject to a power of redemption on the part of the Imperial Government after the 30th of April, 1874, on payment to the proprietors of 2001. for each 1001. stock. The lmpenalGovernment took upon themselves no liability whatever in the shape of a guarantee, and therefore if our rule in India were to cease the holders would have no claim on the British Exchequer. But a collateral security was provided, whicb, in a partial degree, supplies this deficiency. It was arranged that from the assets of the company a sum of 2,000,0001. should be placed in the hands of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, to be invested in Government securities, as a security fund, and that the dividends on this should be allowed to accumulate until the total should reach 12,000,0001. This process has been going on for 23 years, and the aggregate already attained is believed to be over 5,000,0001. It was at the same time provided that as the powers of the India Company were by the Act in question continued only to the 30th of April, 1854, the Company might, if their administration should then, or at any period prior to 1874 be brought to a close by the authority of Parliament, demand to have their Stock paid off at the rate above specified, if they should prefer so to do, instead of availing themselves of the full term allowed. With regard to the Bond debt of 3,900,0001.,it rests entirely upon the ordinary resources of the Company. The rate of interest upon it is 4 per cent., and the holders have the power of demanding to be paid off upon one year's notice. As these bonds are now at ls. discount, they would consequently yield 41- per cent. for the next year to any purchaser who might take them 'with that view. The territorial debt of 60,000,0001. consists of several loans, bearing interest ranging from 3i to ( per cent. Four-fifths of the amount are at 4 per cent., and, with the exception of about 3, 0001. or 4,000,0001. contracted at Madras and Bombay, the whole belongs to Bengal. These funds have always taken a high rank, but about three years back their prestige was greatly damaged by the local Government having effected a reduction of the Five per Cents. to Four per Cents. through representations that the Treasury was amply supplied for allrfuture contingencies, when it turned out that they were obliged within little more than a year from that date to raise a fresh amount and to offer 5 per cent. The affair at the time caused great reproach, but the recollection of it was gradually wearing away, and just before the breaking out of the existing mutiny two-thirds of a new loan for 3,000,0001. had been readily subscribed. At a meeting of the Commercial Bank to-day, Mr. Mark Hunter in the chair, the report was unanimeusly adopted, and a dividend declared of 41. per cent., making with the previous payment a total distribution of 7i per cent, for the year, free of income-tax. The chairman observed that after the severe trial the bank had passed through from the false rumours circulated last autumn, when the balances had decreased upwards of one-third, the result in the shape of a lower dividend must be anticipated. On the other hand, the position of the bank is relatively firmer than that of any other in London, as much as 36 per cent. of the assets being retained in cash to meet liabilities, in lieu of 25 per cent., the ordinary proportion. No large sums are sunk in buildings or other inconvertible securities. In answer to a question referring to a statement in Tlte Times of the 17th inst. the chairman explained that the bank hold a special mortgage for 4,0001. on a portion of the Westminster Improvement property, which is affected by the Bill purporting to give the mortgagees powYer of sale, and, although it has been throwY^n out by the House of Commons, still the bank can let or make any other use of the property, and have, in fact, disposed of its interest. This arrangement has not yet been finally carried ouit, but no loss whatever is expected to accrue to the bank. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- " The balance-sheet for the year ending the 30th of June last shows a net profit of 26,8101. 14s. 7d., after deduoting current expenses and making provision for bad and doubtful debts. * The directors declare a dividend of 4 per cent. for the past half-year, making, with the dividend already paid, 7U per cent. for the year, free from income-tax. * After payment of this dividend there will remain a sum of 4,1601. to be carried forward to profit and loss new account for rebate of interest on bills not yet due, and a further sum of 1491. to be added to the reEerve fund, which, with the annual interest, will then amount to 73,2721. " It will be seen'tbat the business, and consequently the profits, of the bank have been much reduced by tho unEounded and injurious rumours circulated in the autumn, which were brought to the notice of the proprietors at the meeting held in December last. The directors are happy to state that the explanations then given, together vwith the promptitude with which the pressurevwas met, had the effect of entirely eatisfying both the proprietors and tho public of the etrength and solidity of its position. 1Te airectors courld not expect, in the face of active competition, immediately to recover the ground then lost, but they have the satisfaction of stating that some of the accounts which had been withdrawn have since returned, and that many nowv and valuable accounts have been opened since the commencement of the present year, "COMMERCIAL BnANK OF LONDON.

After some discussion it was determined that a deputation should wait upon the Secretary of the Treasury, to request him to postpone the further progress of the Bill until next sessioi, to give time for mature consideration of its provisons. At a meeting of the Cobre Mining Company a dividend of 11. per share was declared. It was stated that the yield of the year 1856 has been 14,617 tons, being 2,913 less than in 1855, and that the copper has deteriorated in quality. The annexed commerciai letter gives the latest account of the state of affairs in the River Plate. At Montevideo the yellow fever has subsided, but its injurious effects in checking the progress of settlement and trade seem likely to be felt for some time. At Buenos Ayres the people appear to look back with just satisfaction on the improvements introduced during the Administration of Senor Obligado the late President, and to anticipate an equally steady course under his successor, Dr. Alsina; although it is a rather discouraging fact that one of the frst proposals of the latter would, had it not been resisted, have led to a further depreciation of the paper currency*. "The fever, which it is now agreed is the yellow fever, has nearly disappeared. The weather has been unusually warm for the season, and the marked absence of pampero winds is a feature of general observation. A sudden diminution of cases of fever a week or two ago induced several persons to return from the country, some of whom fell viotims to their impatience. It was found that those who bad enjoyed the bracing fresh air of the country were more susceptible to attacks than those who had remained in town. It is estimated that from 1,500 to 2,000 persons have died. Considerable sums bave been subscribed for the benefit of orphans and poor people, and it is gratifying to Englishmen that their clergyman, the Rev. F. H. S. Pendleton, has been most indefatigable in administering to the wants of the sick, not even in some cases declining the duties of a menial servant. In more than one instance, when the fever appeared in a house, the servants deserted it. Mr. Pendleton has not confined his services to his own countrymen, or those professing his own creed, and he has been ably assisted by Mr. 'Thoruton, Her Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires, and others. The Government at length talks of adopting some decided sanitary measures, but little reliance is placed in anything they promise. In the meantime, as I advised you in my last, t ey suspended the payment of all debts arising from contracts or international agreements-that is to say, they suspended payment to foreigners. Not a shilling has been levied on the town to carry out sanitary measures, probably because the chief part of the town property is held by the Montevideans. In fact, foreigners are made to a everything in this country to some 50,000 satire ai ants, for they don't exceed that number. The payment of the guaranteed loan has been suspended two months, but the administration of the Customs remains in the hands of the subscribers. Money continues scarce. Exchange, 44d. to 44Md. "'From Buenos Ayres political news is scanty. Dr. Valentin Alsina was elected Governor on the 3d of May by a large majority. He at first declined the honour, but his resignation was not accepted, and he is now duly installed. He represents the extreme tTnitarian party-the party most ?pposed to Romss and Urquiza. Obligado, the late Governor, is now a mere officer of the National Guard, and in that capacity took part in the annual rejoicings on the 25th of May. Under his administration Buenos Ayres has made rapid progress in vwelth and prosperity. A railroad was constructed, but it is said to be a failure, and will have to be relaid before it can be used with safety; a mole of 700 feet in length was carried out; a new Custom-house, with an additional mole, was undertaken, and may be completed in another year; gas was introduced, and great part of the city is now well lighted, duties were reduced, and bonded store rent for the firstyearwas remitted; pavement of the streets made considerable progress. Many handsome buildings have been erected, and landed property has greatly advanced in value. Nor should I omit the offers of Obligado's Administration to arrange a definite settlement of the English loan on something approaching an equitable basis. The present Administration is following the good example of its predecessors. It has abolished the coasting licenses, which were heavy, as well as what were termed 'port dues,' wvhere there was no pert. With the view of re- lieving the Presure of the money-market, the new Governor proposed to issue40,000,000 additional of paper money; out this was so il received by the public that the idea has been relinquished. The Indians have been very troublesome on the frontier and it is said have carried away some 500 persons into captvity. Dr. Alsina proposes to use most energetic measures to preVent a recurrence of similar disasters, and a first step is forming small military posts independent of the Jueces de Paz. The election of three senators ately showed a very decided majority in favour of the Government, and, as Dr. Alsina lsas expressed a desire that anl former delin9uencies should be forgotten, flattering hopes are entertained that his administration will be attended with great benefits to the country. Exchange, 72s. the doubloon. "The Argentine Congress was opened on the 25th ult., and it is rumoured the law of differential duties will undergo some modification. It is found that Buenos Ayres is not iniuriously affected by it, as its Customs'revenue has not dimninished sinco that pernicious law came into operation. One of the local newspapers congratulates the public on the reduction of the debt from 1,200,000 and odd dollars to somethiag over 800,000 dollusr but as Urquiza has just issued debentures for 500,000 aolars, bearing interest at 1 per cent. per month, repayable at the Customs for a portion of the duties, the congratulations are har ly warranted. The confederation, however, is said to be progressive, and with a continuation of peace it seems scarcely possible to be otherwise. Urquiza is about to form a Swiss settlement on one of his numerous estanclas; he is eaid to possess some 800 square leagues of land in EntreRios, andthe first batch of colonists,consistingofabout400persons, arrived off Buenos Ayres a few days ago. Mr. Christie, Her Majesty's Minister, who has been some time in Buenos Ayres, is about to resume his post in the Parana. "There is no news of importance from Paraguay. The production of tobacco continues to increase, and that article now forms no inconsiderable item in the exports from the River Plate to Europe. With other produce the price has doubled within the last three or four years." By a private Act passed Cthig session the powers held by the various dock companies, legal quays, &c', enabling shipowners and others to preserve their lien for freights on shipments landed thereat, have been extended to Meriton's and Hagen's Sufferance-wharfs, in the occupation of J. G. and A. Barry. The half-yearly dividends on the Louisiana State Bonds and New Bank Bonds are advertised to be paid on the 1st of August by Messrs. F. De Lizardi and Co.

I BAILWAY AND MINING SHABES. Tuesday Evening. The railway-market has been quiet, but prices are firm, and in some descriptions an advance has been maintained. Eastern Counties and Great Western were flat. In preference shares, Chester guaranteed, and Oxford, WVorcester, and Wolverhampton were quoted at increased rates. East Indian Railway opened at the reduced price of yesterday, but advanced steadily throughout the day, and closed at an improvement; some of the small descriptions of Indian shares were a shade lower.

RAIWAY INTELLIENE. MIAT)RAS The report of the directors of thls company states that the openingof the farther section of the railway between Arcot and Vellore haa been effected. A re iment of infantry was carried through from Madras to Velore In April, and on the 7th of May the line was opened for general trPalio between these points, a distance of about 81 miles. The further opening to Gorlattam will be accomplished before the end of the year, making altogether nearly 100 miles of raUiway. Throughout the remainingportions of the 8outhWest line the works are proceeding actively. Considerable lengths on this part of the line are now ready for the permanent way, and the only obstacle to the farther opening of it for traffic at an early date] may probably be thebzldges. The surveys for the North-Western line have not yet been completed. The traffic receipts on the railwav between Madras and Arcot for the quarter endin~ March3f, 1857, amounted to 70,496r.; for the quarter ending December 31,1856, to 71,177r. ; and for the quarter ening Sep. tember 30, 1856 to 56,685r. The expenses were3494. 34,879r., and 31178r. r6spectlvely. The total receipts for the nine monthsamounted to 198,359r., andtheexpenditure to 101,001r., or 50-9 per cent., leaving a profit of 97,357r. o greatproportionof the salt traffic has yet found its way to the line. The traffic returns for the quarter ending June 30 are estimated at more than 80,0Dr. In considering these results, the report states that it must be borne in mind that during the period embraced in the returns the passenger trains on the railway have been restricted to one running daily each way, starting at inconvenient hours; that the stations generally have had no proper access to the towns or main roads of the country; that the line had not extended far enough into the Interior to attract to it a large portion of the existing road traffic, or been at work long enough to overcome the opposition of the old-established systeme of carrage - and that three-fourths of the pasn. gers have been carried at a fare of a halfpenny per mile, and three-fourths of the goods at less than a penny a mile per ton. A revised tarff of charges and table of trains have been prepared by the traffic manager, and submitted for the approval of the Government with a view to their intro. duetlon from the 1st of July. The report concludes by referrig to extracts from orders conveying the warm acknowledgments of the Government and Commander-in-Chief at Madras to Mr. Fletcher, the traDlio manager, and other officers of his department, for their zealous and useful services tol the sick of Her Majesty's 43d Regiment on the occasion of that regiment suffering severely from cholera on its way from Amoor to Madras in kIachlasot.
8TATE OF TRADE. MANCBMSTER, JULY 2L Ecportbyarns continue to go off well, and we have a good demand for qualities suited to the German market, prices closing id. per lb. dearer than on Friday last for all descnptions. The Russian houses in this market have also been operating to a fair extent. There has been a good deal of inquiry Inyarns for India, batit has notled to busi. ness, the obiect probably being to test prices in anticipation of telegraphic ihformationfromTriete to-morrow of a more favourable character for commercial operations. In cop yarns verylittle doing. For cloths there has been moro budness in almost all lnds, except fabrn^d suited to India. In these goods there is no improvement, but longeloths and T*cloths are more saleable, and at better prices, from a fear that in the preeent excited state of the cotton market, on the arrival of any news of a favourable character to the India trade, prices may be still further driven up through speculationin theraw material. Every one fears the result of these speculations, but the trade here find they must either follow the current of the market or entirey close their warehouses. Messrs.

LA W REPORT. ROLILS' COURT, Cna&wRRy.L.-A JULr 2L RRNWEr.r. v -TN. - - (fCilrCe thc ASTAMR of thr P--T.T I lr. HOBHOtSE moved in this case for an injunction to restrain the defendant from selling milk within thrbe miles of Grosvenor-square, pursuant to an agreement which he had entered into with a person named Wright, in whose employ the defendant formerly was. It appeared that Mr. Wnight is the proprietor of theFriern ManorDairy at Peckham, and does an extensive business in snpplying mflk at the west-end of the town. The plaintiff had purchased his business. The defendant had previouslyenterea into the usual contract with Mr. Wright not to sell milk on his own account within three miles of Grosvenor.square, the district in which he was employed, and it was to stop the alleged infringement of this stipulation that the present injunction was asked for. Mr. TAYLOn appeared for the defendant, and objected to the defendant's being restrained in such general terms from galmnD a livelihood. ONO sid that the best mode would be to turn - Th V fv,JW -= 5~JUni=-Aon-inW a motion for a decree, but, nntil the hearing, the defendant must undertake not to sell milk tothe customers he bad been in the habit of serving for MIr. Wright. Order accordingly. STAIhrTON V. THE CAPMON COMPANY. His HoNouI yesterday gave judgment in this case, the facts of which have bcen previously reported, and in which the question in Issue was one of acconnt between the Carron Company and MIr. Stainton, their former London agent. After reviewing the evidence, from which It appeared that there were considerable sumns of money not satisfactorily accounted for by 3Ir. Stdlton, his HIonour made a decree for opening the accounts as between the estate of that gentleman and the company.
VICE-CHA2CEILORS' COURTS. JULY 2L Nfl.lflR v* (Beforc Vice-Chancelgor Sir R. T. Knnm Rt1 _l This case, which has been twice adverted to in The Times, now came on upon a motion for an injunction to restrain the defendant from afixing the common seal of the Western Bank of London to a certain deed entered into in favour of the manager of the bank, or executing any other deed having a similar object, and from paying, or the said manager from receiving, any moneys under such deed, or dealing with that instrument. The motion occupied the Court till the rising, and was not concluded. Mr. Glasse and Mr. Drewry appeared in support of the motion,; Mr. Baily and Mr. WVickens opposed it. (Before Fice-Chancallor Sir W. P. WOOD.) THE BRIBSH EMIPIRE SHIPPING COMPANY (LMITED) V. SOMES. Mr. CAIRNS and Mr. DRUCE, on behalf of the plaintiffs, moved for the production of the several deeds, books, papers, and vritings admitted by the defendants in their answer to be in their possession, and for inspection of the same. The plamtiffs inthis suit, which has been already before the Court upon demurrer, are owners of a ship caUed the Britih Empire, which had been under repair at the docks of the defendants, Messrs. Somes, ' who are shipwrights at BlackwalL The account sent in by the defendants to the company for the repairs amounted to 8,8161. 15s. 2d., after deducting discount. The plaintiffl, being unable to obtain possession of their ship on sny other terms, paid this sum in December last under protest. InJanuary they commenced an action against the efendants for recovery of the alleged excess, wherenpon the defendants obtained an order under the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, sec. 3, for a compulsory reference to arbitration, which was now pending. The company had filed their bill for discovery as to matters relating to certaln, according to the allegations, unreasonable and excessive items of charge, including 3,4431. Ss. Ild. for smiths' work, and, under the head of "labour," 3,142.. for shipwrights' without any explanation showing how theso sumns were made up. The bill also alleged that it was impossible for the amount of work and labour and the quantity of materials charged by the defendants as expended upon the ship to have been really or fairly done or consumed thereon. The defendants had demurred to the bill, but upon argument the demurrer was overruled. An answer had been subsequently put in by the defendants, in which they admitted t e possession of returns showing the amount and particnlars of the labour, work, and materials done and consumed upon the ship, and also books and papers, &c., showing the said amount and particulars, but claimed to protect themselves from their production. In consequence of this statement the plaintiffs now moved upon a summons adjourned from chambers for production. In support of the motion it was contended that the plaintiffs were entitled to see how the lump sums charged against them were made up, and to investigate into the evidence that the sums charged for labour and materials had actually been paid. Mr. RoLT and Mr. SHPTER, for the defendants, contended the case was one of a simple qwtantum meruit, and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to find, by investigating these books and accounts, the mode pursued by the defendants in carrying on their business. As well might any one who, having a bill for a coat sent in, demaud a discovery from the tailor as to the amount paid for cloth, lining materials, and sewing in separate items. With respect to the quantity of timber and labour employed in repairs, the defendants were fairly entitled to charge for their sklul in producing with a smaUer quantity the same result which an inferior shipwright could only have pro. duced with a greater expenditure of both. Mr. CARIPS replied. The VIcE-CkN'cELLoR said that the defendants were clearly entitled to chargewhat they pleased for smithB' work or shipwrghts' work, &o., aud the plaintiffs were as clearly not entitled to see the prices actually paid to the workmen. With respect to the quantity of materials, timber, &c., the case was somewhat different, If the bill was for building the ship the rule as to quantumrameruit would apply, the expenditure of skill, labour, and material having produced the result, which every one could appreciate for himself. Where, however, the charge was merely for repairs there was nothing to show, as far as outward appearances went, what had been done. It was said that such an expenditure could not have been required for mere repair, and the principle might be thus tested:Supposing 1,500L was charged for labour, and the books showedonlytwo days' labour, was it possible that such an amount of work could have been donewithin thetime? He was anxious to shut the dooragainstany prying inquiries as to the mode of carrying on the trade, but the plaintiffs were entitled to see the returns of labour done. The order would be for the defendants to produce the documents mentioned in the schedule to their answer, with liberty to seal up, on the usual affidavit, any part of such documents as related exclusively to irrelevanb matters or prices paid by the defendants in executing repairs, or to their c4lgulj ons inrespect ther6of,

The committee re.assembled at 12 o'clock yesterday, and after deliberating for about an hour, The CHantaI said they had agreed to the following resolutions - "1L ThatThom s utton Wosten, Xsq., Is duly electod a burgem l scneln theprewentParLame atfor the borough of Muldon. "2. That it wa proved to the oDmmittee that Joseph Rlley at. empted tobsibe HenryGozzell, byithe promlao of a oontraot for work at a church of whih the sdi Joseph Sley was churchwarden. "3.

Mr. PENN then proceeded to open the cose in sapport of the petition aganst Mr. Bramley-Moore, the other sittlng member. The learsnedgentleman first mentionedthe casO of a voter named Gill, who, being in difficulties, had been promised relief by a Mr. Codd if he voted for Mr. Brams ey-Moore. The CHArU31A aaid that Gi lliad already been lex. amined, and he was saeh an unaISfaMctory witness that he thought it right to intimate that the commnittee could plafe to relianceo on his st~ateustents. Mr. PINNo, after that intimation from the commnittee, thought it his duty to abandon the petition. Mr. Et JAzs applied to the committee to declare the petitionfrivqlous and vexatious, and said he would call evidence in support of that appllcation. Mr. Pp oosed the application. Mr. Sutton Wetern was then called, He said he had nothim2 to do with getting up the petition. It woulddepend upon how heomight be asdvised whether he paid part of the expenses of the petition. 3r. Digby had in the first in. stance advised him not to present it, but, after consultation, it had been presented. Hedidnot knowwhether Mr. Dig: had indemni'fied the petitioners. He understood that he wag to pay the expenses if no ono else did. Mr. Digby was employedto prosecnte the t'tion. He had told Mr. BramleyMoore that Mr. Digby had come to london and presented the petition, in consequence of Mr. Hance, the agent of Er ramley-Moore having been employed in getting up evidence against him (hMr. Western). That was one cli several reasons for the presentation of the petition. As far as he could rememberhe had not mentioned any other reason to Mr. Bramley.Moore. Mr. Digby had told him that MrHance had been getting up evidence against him, and beged him to mention it to Mr. Bramley-Moore. He was toln by Mr. Bramley-Moore that that was a raistake, but he did not recommend the withdrawal of the petition. Not long before the petition waspresentedaMr. Digbv said he thoughtit might, er pe, be the means of inducing Mr. Peacocke to withdraw nls petition. That was only one of the reasons for present. ing the petition. ,Cross-examined.-He had communicated, in his opinion, confidentially with Mr. Bramley-Moore, and, he lnderstood Mr. Bramley-Mooro to express himself satisfied with the election as It stood. Counsel was consulted before the peti. tion was presented. He had heard of several circumstances which, in his opinion, justified an inquiry Into the circum. stances of Mr. Bramley-Moore's return. He had heard of a poacher being brought out of gaol to vote, of breakfast being supplied to voters, Kand of prizefighters being engaged by the otner side. 601 was charged in the acmounts for those prize. fighters. Hs conscientious opinion of the petition which had been presented aganst his own return was that it was founded upon the sightest possible grounds, but he thought there was good ground for attacking the return of Mr. Bramley.Moore and for endeavonring to disqualify MEr. Pea cocke from again standing for the borough. Mr. Bramley.fooor was then called and examined by Mir. J.tAIS. He said he Was not aware, directly or in. directly, of any corrupt expenditure by himself or hic agents in the course of the election. He had nothing at all to do with Mr. Peacocke's petition. He had had a conversation (whlch he did not consider confidential) with Mr. Westerm on the subject of the petition. Mr. Western told him that a petition must be presented against him, becauee his agent had been engaged in getting up a crtition against him (Mr. Western). He replied that he did not believe his agent would do anything of the kind without consulting him. He then wrote to Mr. Hance, the agent, who assured him that he had had nothing to do with the matter. In former elections it had been the custom to employ gipsies on the Ia'beral side. The mayor had been asked at the last election whether the gipsics were coming, but he said they were not. Previous to the election Eevera gipsies, however, were seen coming into the town, and it was thought necessary to afford the voters some protection .gxdnst them. This led to the enzaaeTaelt of the prizefighters. They weie kept in a room in the Blue Boar Inn in case their services should be required, but they were not req.uired.. Cross.examined.-He did not keep joint accounts with Mr. .Peacocke, but posting bils were issued in their joint names. He had not authorized any one to announce his resignation. He might have said to Mr. Peacocke's agent that the petition might as well have been let alone. There s nothing confidential in his conversation with Mr. Western. lMr. Hance said that he and his brother, a solicitor, were joint agents for MIr. Bramley-.oore at the last election. either he nor his brother, as far as he knew, had anything whatever to do with getting up the petition against Mr. Western. On cross-examination he said the bils were made out jointly to Mr. Peacocke and Mr. Bramley-Moore. Mr. Digby, sen., said he was the solieltor to this petition. He should expect one of the llr. Westerns, father or son, to pay the expenses. He did not know whether he should lump his charge or make out a bill. He thought he should lump it to Mr. Satton Western, jun. He thought about this petition, but did not decide upon presenting it, before Mr. reacocke's was presented. He did not suggest as a reason for the presentation of the petition that it might procure the withdrawal of the petition against llr. Western. did mention that 31r. Hance was engaged In that petition, but he believed that he did not assign that as a reason for presenting the pettition. Cross-examined.--He believed bond fide that he had good grounds for presenting this petition. He had consulted coumsel, and had a consultation upon the whole case. Ee had been informed of Gill's case, and of the release of the Toter from aol. He protested against the withdrawal of the petition, aXthough he Iadbeenat first averse to its presentation. He thought they had a much better case than that which had been made out in snuport of the petition on the other side. Mr. E. JAMES renewed his application to have the petition declared frivolous and vexatious. It had, he said, en presentedfor two reasons,-firstly, to procure the withdrawal of Mr. Peacocke's petition; and, secondly, because the agent of lMr. Bramley-.Moore, over whom Mr. Bramley. MIoore had no authority, was supposed to be concerned m that petition. This was, he contended, a gross abuse of the right of petitoniong. The room was then clearod, and after a short delibera. tfon, The CHAMM&IA said that the committee had unanimously resolved that John Bramley-Moore, Esa., was duly elected a burgess to serve in Parliament for the borough of aIldon; that the petition against the return of the said John Bransley-loore, Esq., was frivolous and vexatious- and that it appeared that the petition had been got up chiefly Mr. Western. WEYMEOUTH. At the sitting of the committee at 11 o'clock yesterday, Mr. SLADE, on the part of the petitioner, stated that he had concluded his evidence with regard to the allegations of bribery. Evidence was then given of the endeavours that had been made to procure the attendance of Simmons, who was alleged to have committed acts of bribery and treating in order to induce voters to poll for Mr. Campbell. It was proved that Simmons had come from Weymouth to london in the luggage compartment of the train, in order to avoid being served with a subpoena, and that he had been. seen in London with a Mr. Hatton. That gentleman was also called and said he was a clerk in a company in which Mr. Campbell had an interest, and that two or three weeks ago Simmons came and saw him at the company's wharf when they had a conversation about private business, but neither Mr. Campbell nor tho election was mentioned. A baker named Besant stated that MIr. Campbell had promised him a berth for his brother, a tailor, but admitted on cross-examination that nothing had been said about his brother until after he had voted and the election was over. Somo witnesses were then called to prove that Simmons had been rrequently seen at Mr. Campbell's committee-room dnuring tho election, and that he had assisted in taking Mr Campbell's voters to the ptoll. It appeared, however, thata great many persons on both aides were employed in the same manner on tho day of the election. This was the close of the petitioner's case. The room was then cleared, and the committee deliberated for about an hour. On the re-admission of the public, The Cnmrmku announced that the committee had come to resolutions to the effect that there was priad facie evi. deace that Samuel Simmons had given a bribe of 61. to Thomas Newman for the purpose of inducing Bonella to vote, and that Samael Simmons had also given a bribo to Edmunds, but that there was no proof of agencyon the part of Samuel Simmons. They werealso ofopinion that Thomas Vile had received from G. H. Russell, a servant of Mr. Camp'coll,31.fothree pairs of slippers, which had only st hsimn i 1s. 6d. These were the eases to which they wished the learned counsel for the sitting member to direct their llr. B. JAhs, on the part of the sitting member, applied for an adjournment, as this announcements for which they were much obliged to the committee, had rather taken them ihr LADE did not oppose the application, and The committee adjourned until 1 o'clock this day.

SUMAfM1? ASSIZES. JNORTHERN CIRCUIT. YOBK, JTULY 20. * i= CIVIL COURT.-(Bcfore Mr. Bat-on WATsOF.) CI1EADLE, CLERK, V. FERRAND, ESQ. This was an action for libel brought by the Rev. Jamec theadle, vicar of Bingley, against Wiliam BusfieldFerrand., Xsq., for a series of libels imputing to the plaintiff odishonourable and fraudulent conduct, and neglect 'aT his duties as a clergyman. The defendant pleided " Not nu5lty," and a justification. Mr. Bliss, Q.C., Mr. Aktherton, Q.G., Mr. Afaison, and Mr. Caunpbell Foster appeared for the plaintil7; and Mr. mliU, Q.C., Mr. Overend, Q.C., amd Mr. Mdllish for the defendar.t. It appeared frotm the opening of the learned counsel for the plaintiff, and from tlo evidence of the plaintiff and his -'witnosses, that the pladmtiff is'sicar of Birgley; and the de. fendant a gentleman possessed of lo estates in that parish, a magistrate of the West Riding, and also ex ogWio one of the gnardians of the Keighley Union, in which Bingley is placed. The aetion was brought to recover damrges for a series of libels defamatory of the plaintil's character to stuch a degree that no person who wished to hold hitmself up in society could avoid coning bafore a jury for redress. The libels complained of Irene four. The earliest in date was in the form of a letter addressed to the inhabitants of Bingloy. The next one was a letter addressed in October last to the late bishop of the diiocss. 'The third was a letter addressed to the present Bishop of Ripon, and tho foarth was a letter addressed to the inhabitants of Bingley, dated the 14th of May this year. Two of these libels had been printed and circulated, and the plaintif1 complained that they contained statements reflecting on himn, sometimes stating what was partly true and - partly spurious, and sometimtes imputing to him acts as the result of fraud which were merely acts of inadvertenco and over.iglat; and they also imputed scandalous, illegal, and fraudulent conduct to him. The parish of diiqloy is a vicarage, to whieh are attached globe lands and charity lands. Some of these lands were called " Woollen's Charity," and had been given in the reign of Qcaeen Elizabeth, half of their proceeds to be applied to the grammar school and half to the poor of the parish. In one of the libeLs the plaintiff was accused of 2nisapplving the funds so set apart for the poor. There were other charity lands, called the " Sunderland Charity," one half of the proceeds of which wore to go in support of the grammar school and the other half to the vicar, and the plaintiff was charged with illegal conduct in the management of those lands in the libels. In 1837 the plaintiff was nominated to tho parish. The defendant at that time took a strong part in politics, and an nncle of the defendant was a candidate for the vicarage, which was in the gift of the Lord Chancellor. The appointment of the plaintiff was inputed to political causes, and that probably had raised a feeling, of animosity against hin in the defendant's mind. 'I e plaintiff succeeded a Dr. Hartley to tho living, and in his tlne a Chancery suit had been begun in reference to the charity lands, and that portion of them allotted to the poor amounted in value te' 121. a.year. The trustees voere urdered to pay this sanm to four infirmaries, and the vacancies aiong the truistees were to be filled -up. The plainitilf and defendant in 1833 wcr. both elected trustees and the plaintiff was charged with eubezzling one of tho annual payments to one of theso infirmnarics-the Buxton I'itih infirmary. When the plaintiff was appointed vic-r of Bin.gley there was no parsonage house, and, it being desiratle that there should bh one, he w.as advised to sell a part of the glebo lands, with the sanction of the officers of (Iueen Ann's Bounty, and to appropriate the money to bnilding a house; and, by consent of the patron and the bishop, he sohl a part of what he believed to be the glebs. It was offered by auction, and only 0001. was bid for it. A gentleman in the parWsh named Greenwood offered 1,5001. for it and bought it, and this sum was paid into the Qaeen Amne's Bounty-office, who allowed 1,1001. for a house, and 1'laced the res9idue in the f'inds. Mr. Greenwood afterwards sald this land to the rail-vay company for 2,2001., and, after dedu.cting 3.501. for his expenses and loss of interest, as the land had been lying unsold for sunme time, ho in a very handsomue mnanner handed over the balance beyond his pur. chase pr.ce-3o01.-to the vicar. The defendant, who was r.ware of tle sale in 1853, in 1856 said he knew nothing of it, and that it was a fraudulent compact between the plaintiff and Mr. Greenwood to get thlo land for less than it was wortb, and divide the profit on its sale to the railway coinpany. N-.t long after this transaction coal was foundunder the gebc, and after some bargaining wvith a Mr. Seebohin, who at last declined to purchase tho coal, saying ho was advtsed the plaintiff had no title to it and could not sell it, tho plaintiff, acting under the advice of his attornoy, who told him he could sell it, sold the coal to a Mr. Bent.ley for about 7.51. The plaintiff bad been put to a cost of about 401. in linding it and with other attendant expenses, and he had put tho residue into Iiis pocket, supposing Isimself to be entitled to it. This vas imputed to him as an act of fraud. In 1849 the trustees of the school lands felt that it would be extremely desirable to geb power to sell some of the lands for build- ing sites, as thoy would produce a much greater return. It was necessary for this purpose to get an Act of Parliament, which It was estimated would cost 4001. In preparing for this Act it was necessary to trace ouxt the Sunderland Charity lands, and it was then found that a part of these lands had been sold to Mr. Greenwood, and not glebe lands. The Court of Chancery *as applied to, and ordered that the s-.1e to Mr. rceonawood eh-i t.a eta _ t ,tsetri, that in the Act to bo obtained that sale lsould be legaiized; and this w as done with the knowledge of the defendant. The defendant afterwards met the plaintiff on the platform of a railway station, and in loud termcs charged hirn with illegal conduct in the sale of those lands, and afterwards applied to the Ch3rity Commissioners for an inquiry. The Charity Commissioners sent down Mr. Mattin, one of the inspectors, to hold the Inquiry, and the defendantthenstated that 'the Court of Chancery and Parliament had baen impo:ed upon, but after a fuUl hearing the inspector was satisfied. One of tlho libels descrihed this adjudication of the inspector as putting his " thumnb" on the evidence, and went on to term " the Buxton Charity defalcations a piece of carelessness, of which bad tho secretary been gu'lty he would have pronounced them embezzlement." This referred to an omissiou to pay 21. 12s. Gd. to the Buxton Bath Infirmary, as ordered by the Court of Chancery in the year 1853. That this was an act of forgetfulness and carelessness was proved by the fact of tho plaintiffhaving in 1855 paid the amount twice over to this charity, being under the impression that he had omitted to pay it the year before. While this was going on tho defendant made himself busy in looking after tho vicar's burial fees. The pauper burial fees charged were a fee of 6d. to the clerk, Is. 6d. to the sexton up to 2s. 6d., varying with the size and depth of the gravo, and Is. to the vicar, the clerk collecting the fees. The old clerk died, and subsequently a man named Asqnith was appointed, whom it was desirable to appoint as he could leod the choir. He lived at some distance, and an arrangement was made that at funerals the sexton should act as hbs deputy. Formerly the clerk sang or led the sing. ing of a bymn before a funeral from the church to the grave. ThIxs was given up as not required by the rubric. The defendant attended tho board of gpardians and charged the plaintiff with taking illegal burial fees. A deputation of guardians wdfted upon the plaintiff and searched the parish terriers and found that the fees charged were the legal and . ccustomed fees according to the last parish terrier in 1820, the fees being 6d. the clerk, ls. 6d. the sexton, and is. the clergyman. The earlierterriers aUowed 9d. and 10d. to the sexton. The defendant moved that a complaint should be sont to the Poor Law Board, because in some instinees there had been a larger charge made fo rthe sexton. The first libol to the bishop eharged him vith taking more than the eustomary burial fees. and with fraudulently charging above 60 per eant. more than the legal burial fees. This libel went on to say:- "WNero thero a sasrisi, c'erk decently and revroretly perforenfug tile uity at r'nerals, be wouil l a4lvisethe payment or the feo of Kt -but there wasg no parish clerk, and appointing a clerk who lived a'mllo fram the church and t' e oext, as his deputy was a fraUd upon the vubli,, an inumlt to the p3riin, a scandi2a' to the elsurAh and a mock-esy of religion." The phaiuntiff was then charged with having from revenge seized an ancient pew in the Bingley parish church belonging to the Ferrand family, and of which they had a faculty since lkvll. It appeared that tlis pew bad been occupied by the late Mlrs. Ferrand, the mother of the defendant, and that the defendant occupied another pew. After the late Mrs. Ferrand's death the defendant handed the keys of the pear to the plaintiff, and told him he might appropriate the pew to such as required it, on condition that this was not done till six months after Mrs. Ferrand's death, as she had refused its appropriation. The pew remained unoccupied two years. and as -the defendant was then pulling down St. Ives, the fan.ily seat where his mother had lived, to which the pew was appropriated, the churchwardens and the plaintiff applied to the then.2ishop of ipon, now the Bishop of Durharm, forpermission to divide and appropriate the pow. Re said nothing about the Ferrand family having a faculty for it, as he did not think ib necessary. The bishop granted permission, aiid the front half was appropriated to Mr. Ferrand's brother, and the back half to oneof theedefendant'stenants. The next libel charged swas contained in the foUowing letter, addressed to the present Bishop of Ripon, Dr. Biekersteth " 1YTr .-I h-us can yo -o ou-ete o bs1t " V , ..d.-I have wO thank yoii for your letter of the 14th, ('I the .dh (.f (Ctober I forwardel the fo oiwllg charges againat the Vicar of rnylev to 3i3bolp L-eu4ley :-I. ie had defrauldet the Riuhbley PBoard of fiu:,-disns ann the neor by clsrging hiRher burial fees than bc Is eaktted to charge by law. 2.

"Your Lordshii?s faithful and obedient servsut I `- V. FERg I Th, plaintiff denied being in'duonced by any feeling of ansrX4ejty whatever towards the defendant in flao matter of b e pew. In the autumn of 1856 he ras zadvised to go to afarrowgarc for change of air, and, was subsent six weeks, having made arrangement3 with a clergyman at Bradford to visit the sick for him, and also vith tho clergyman at the gramar school at Bingley to do so after school hours. He had also made arrangemenits with two other clergymen in the neighbourhood to perform the service on the Sandays and visit for him in case of necessity during his absence. Ile had never refused to visit tho sick, though he was unable from the extent of his partsh to do more in outlying villages than attend the sick when sent for. He had offered to visit the siek at the union workhouse, and to perform Divine service once a week if the guardians wouid set a night apart for him, but tlhey had refused to do so. The libels,which were of great length,embodying substantially the above charges, two of them being printed eir. culars were then put in, and proved to have been received by the Bishop of Durham, his Lordship being seated on the bench; and by Mr. Wise, the present Bishop of Ripon's secretary; and tho printing of thu circular was proved The plaintiff was then called, and examined andlcross. examined at great lengtb, giving explanations of these various transactions, as stated by his learned counsel. The plaintiff's witnesses in corroboration were being examined. when, after a shorb consultation between the learned counsel, Mr. HILL said, after the explanations givea by Mr. Cheadlo, the defendant, acting under his advice, withdrew al personal aspersions whatever against Mir. Cheadle. We felt that, as a man and a gentleman, he could not persist in them after the full explanation given by the plaintiff, MIr. Br iss said, on the part of his olieat, he had assented to a verdict for such a sum as would cover merely the great expenses to which he had been put, on a full retractation of the aspersions cast upon him being given. Hlis LORDSIIII said both parties had aeted very wisely, the defendant in withdrawing the imputations cast on the plaintiff, and the plaintiff in bringing this action, and being satisfied with such a result. For it was impossible that, as a lergyman,he could have rested under suchimputatons with any hope of having the respect of his parishioners. A verdict was then taken for the plaintiff,-Damages, This concluded the business before his Lordship. Mr. Baron CssAxx.N-BL tried au action in the other court for a breach of contract, which occupied the day, and finished th-3se assises.
ATYWAT'. r¶TP CITTTP STSAFFORD. JuLY 20. _tho judges being occupied till a late hour with the business at Worcester, Mr. Serjeant Pigott arrived in this town on Saturday and opened the commission for the county of Stafford with the usual formalities. Mr. Baron Martin yesterday attended divine Service at St. Mary's, and this morning took his seat in tho Civil Court at 12 o'clock. Mr. Baron Bramwell sat at 10 o'clock in the Criminal Court and charged the grand jury. The caueo list contains an entry of only 16 causes, two of which are marked for special juries. The calendar coiitains a list of 63 prisoners, two of whom are charged with murder. The other offences eharged are of an ordinary description. C1VIL COURT.-(Bqfore l1rr. Baron MART=N andI a Common Jul-Y.) BATE V. BARTLETT. Mr. Whateley, Q., and Mr. Kettle appeared for the plaintiff; and MIr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. M'Mahon for the defendant. The plaintiff, Thomas Bato, described himself as a follmouger at Penibridge, and sued the defendant, R. H. Bartlett, an attorney at Wolverhampton, to recover damages for a trespass in taking tho plaintiff's dog and converting it to his own use. The defendant pleaded the general issue, and also th-at the dog in question was not the property of the plaintiff. It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that in September, 1S54, two poppples had been given to him by a man named Walker, at Wolverhampton. The pups were greyhounds, and one of then named "Patch," but afterwards " Maudoline," turned out a " stunning runner." The defcndant set up a claim to them, and after the plaintiff had been I5 ionths in possession, Walker got one of them away from him, and sent it down into Somersetshire, where it was kept in the house of the defendant's father. Tho defendant having heard of tho dog's whereabouts, went down into Somersetshire in search of it, andas he went whistling aboat the neighbourhood the dog recognized tho well-known signal, and came bouncing out of the house and fobowed his master houme. A charge of felony was made against the plaintiff by Walker, but this being dismissed the present action was brought to recover tho expenses to which the plaintiff had. been put in getting back his dog, and also the stakes wlhich the dog had won. In the course of the trial, Mr. Serjeant P.or-r said his case was that the dog was the defendant's, and that Walker had no authority to part witlh it. Mr. Baron MARTeN Said the plaintiff had been allowed to keep the dog for 15 months. His Lordship thought the plaintiff ought to be reimbursed his expenses, but nothing more. The counsol conferred with one another, and eventually left it to the learned judge to say what amount the defendant ought to pay. Mr. Baron MAsTsN said he thought the defendant ought to pay the plaintiff 751. A verdict for that amount was then taken, Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Davies appearea ror the plaintiff; and Mr. Hluddleston and Mr. Scotland for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action, John Lees, was the keeper of a publichouse called the Itobin Hood, situate at Norton-in. the-Woods, in this county, and he sued the defendant, a young man living with his mother and step-father, a farmer in the samo neighbourhood, to recover damages for the seduction of his daughter, Aim Lees. It appeared from the evidence given by the young woman, who was about 19 years of age, that the defendant, who was a young nian, had boK in the habit of coming to the Ito in Hood for abont+ three years. He had made her proposals of marriago, and had been accepted by the plaintiff as her suitor, and continued his visits till Christmas last, fromu which time his visits became less frequent. On the 11th of March last the young woman gave birth to a child, and on that occasion the defendant went to her bedside, acid saw her and told her not to fear, for he would mako things right. The young woman had been invited to the wedding when the defendant's mother was married a second time, and Mr. Glover, the defendant's stepfather, had treated the young woman as his daughter, and, in fact, he had ealled her "daughter," while she had called him ". father." The defendant had made her a present of a " Church SerHice" and a hymn-book, and had gone to church with her. The father and mother beth stated that the defondant had made proposals of marriago, and had been accepted. An attempt was made on the cross-exaniination of the young woman to show that she had alowed other young men to tako liberties with her, but she distinctly denied everything, except one or two trifles which might innocently happen to any pretty barmaid. Mr. HUDDILESTO was addressing the jury for the defend. ant, but was stopped by his junior, Mir. Scotland, who stated that the action was settled. Mr. Sergeant BiGoosrT said the parties had agreed to settle the action by the payment of 501. Verdict for the plaintiff-Dansages 501. CRIMINSAL CCou .-(.BCforC A.5 Bar-on BRAMWnVELL,) George Reynolds, 26, jeweller, was charged with uttering a forged DI. Bank of England note, at Birmingham, on the l0th of Flebruary, 1857. Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mir. H. James appeared for the prosecution. The prisoner was undefended. It appeared that on the evening of the 19th of February last the prisoner went to the shop of Mr. BalIls, a grocer, at B1-minghlam, and representing himself to be sent by a publican of that town, pauchased a small quantity of cheeso, and obtained chango for the forged note, the subject of the charge. IQ addition to this case, evidence was given of the uttering by the prisoner of two otherforged 51.-notes, struck from the same plate, on two previous occasions. The prisoner closely cress-examinled the witnesses as to his identity, but the evidence on this point was conclusive, and the jury without hesitation found him Guilty. Mer.uBdaeron BItASWLL sentenced him to 10 years' penal Mr. WIHATELEY stated that the prisoner was the last of a gang of six men, all the others having been previously convicted, who had for many years carried on a very large business in uttering forged notes in the neighbourhood of Birmingham. TUESDAY, JuLY 2L CRUIraNIL CoURT.--(Before 3fr. Baron BRASMWELL:) John Dowd was oharged with feloniously cutting and wounding Joe-)eh Sharrett, with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm, on the 2d of June, at Wolverhampton. Mr. M'Mabon appeared for the prosecution. The prisoner conducted his own defence with uuusual audacity. It appeared that the prosecutor and a friend, both sober, were going down a streat in the Irish quarter of Wolverhampton between 3 and 4 o'clock on the morning of the 2d of June last. They saw the prisoner standing in the street before them, and, though they never saw him before, and did not say a word or give any provocation whatever to him he suddenly rished at the prosecutor, pulled out a poker which he had concealed under his coat, and struck him a blow on the head, which made hini nearly senseless. A long struggle ensued, some other persons came up, and the prisoner ran away, hut was pursued and arrested. The prosecutor was found lying insensible in the gutter, bleeding profusely from a wound in the head, two Eevere wounds on the face, a tooth k-nocked oat, and his body bruised all over. Tejury found the prisoner aiy of unlawfully wotndMr. Baron BRAIWNEI. said the prisoner in this instance had exhibited the brutal instinct of a wild beast, and sentenced him to the highest penalty allowed by law-viz., three years' imprisonment, with hard labour,
NORFOLK CIRCToTT. I HUNTINGDON, TUESDAY, JULY 21. Mr. Justice WVILLMIS, in the absence of Lord Campbell, opened the commission for the county of HtntiDgdoz yesterday afternoon, and this morning, at 9 o'clock, proceeded to charge the GrandJury. The calendar contains the names of 11. prisoners, and embraces two charges of rape, two of burglary, tbree of larceny, and one of perury, which was found at the last assizes, and eceupied Mr. Justice Williams a great part of the day. The cause list contained one common and one special jury. NTsI PRws CO-.RT.-(Bcfore Mr, Se}J6anl WELTS.) George eynolds, John Hall, John Mitchell, and George Gallighar were indicted for a burglary in thelhouse of Robert Woreldey, iz the towns of funtingdon, on the 16th of April, and stealing therein two tea-cheats containing about Ii. 1Sa. - Mr. D. BROWN conducted the easo for the prosecation, which consisted mainly in the proof that the four prisoners were all seen lurking about the house of the prosecutor cOi the evening preceding the robbery, and were taken soon after in company, when a partielar pennypiece, whic4 was identified by the prosecutor, was found on Reynolei8, while coin to the amnountof 1.18s. was found secretedIabout the dress of all the prisoners. In addition to these facts it was shown that the entry into the house having been efTected by breakting a window marks of blood wero found on the broken glass and on the person and dress of one of the prisoners. For the defence the keeper of a lodging-houso where the prisoners were taken into custody on the morning after the burglary was caUled by Hall, and proved that Hall and Grallighar wvere at homne atl10o'clook, when they svent to bea and did not go out again. In cross.examination, however, he admitted that when heolocked up the str-et door, at night he left the key in the lock for the accommodation of his lodgers. The jury found all tho prisoners GuiMy, and they were forthwith sentenced to three years' penal servitude. CROWN COURT.-(Before Mr. Justice WiLizx.s.) Henry James, aged 50, was indicted for wiltul and corrupt perjury, charged to have been committed on the occasion of an information preferred by him against John Wallis, for keeping open his beerhouse before 1 o'clock on Sunday. tbe 13th of July last, at St. Ives. Mr. Naylor was counsel for the prosecution; Mr. letcalfe defended the prisoner. The trial did not present any features of general interest. It may scfiee, therefore, to say that after a lengthened trial the jury returned a verdict of1Not Guilty.
WPhII.PTRR lP.TPR^TTT I DORC1HESTEP, MONxDAY, JULy 20. WIlliam N~,T.Jore .dil'. JuSZtce UROMPTON.) EWiliam Newton was indicted for stabbing and cutting Charles White, with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm. Mr. Cosens was counsel for the prosecution. It appeared that on the ad of Jnne Charles White wert to meet his wife and her cousin, Mary Tewkesbury, wlio had been to Lee a club walk, and they went into the Swan' publichouse and had a pint of beer. They there saw the prisoner, who began to pull about Mary Te wkesbury. His advances were resisted, and the prisoner went away. Soon afterwards White and his wife and the young woman left the publichouse, and as they were pro-, ceeding on their way home they overtook the prisoner, who said he wouild have the young womanaTo walk with lim. She would not agree to this, and she went to White for protection, who told the prisoner not to molest the girl. The prisoner then jum3 ed at White with a kni.e in his hand and stabbed him in the ear. As soon as White' saw the blood he knooked the prisoner dowva, and while struggling the prisoner stabbed him in six or seven placessome on the head and some on the lower parts of the body. The prisoner was not drunk, but was not sober. The jury having found the prisoner Guilty, he was sentenced to penal servitude for eight years. William Lush was indicted for a rape on Ezett Martin at Motcotobe on the 20th of June. Mr. Edwards conducted tho case for the prosoution, and Mr. Ffooks defended the prisoner. This was an act of more than useal atrocity. It a?peared that the girl, a very pretty and intOresting one, had taken her sister part of the way to her home. Raving left her, she was returning to her father's home, when in the fields she met the prisoner, who said he would kiss her. The girl resisted, and the prisoner then threw her down on the ground. A little boy named Jones caine up, and the prisoner let the girl go. She then pro. ceededhomewards, when theprisonerovertookher andthrew her down again. She struggled with all her might, and cried "M turder" and for help. Her cries brought .to the saot two fellows, one named Richard Lydford, an organist, and the other onec Smart, who was a cousin of the girL They found the prisoner nearly in the act of vioe lenco. The girl called upon them for God's sake to help her. l,vdrord begged the prisoner to deslst, and pulled him with all his might, and he swore he asked Smart to help him, but that he would not, and then these two meni, Englishmen, and we must say Dorset men, quietly walked away and left them, never even giving information, so that assistance might be rendered to the poor girl. Perhaps such a case has until the present day been umknown. After these scoundrels had left the parties the prisoner continued his violence, until after an hour he accomplished his purpose. The girl then got up and ran home, and told a neighbour, ind the absence of her mother, what had occurred. A surgeon was sent for and found the girl very much bruised, and that the act hi his opinion had been committed. The girl gave her ovidence with great propriety, but fainted during her cross-examiination. The wretched organist also stated what he had seen, what he had done, and how ho had walked away. Mr. FFooi3s addressed tho jury, and in doing so dwelt upon the conduct of Lydford and Smart, ad nitting'that language was not strong enough to denounce the conduct of such men i but he urged the jury to come to the conclusion that the girl had consented, but, knowing that her act would ho made public, had been induced to make this charge. Mr. Justice CROaIPTONe summed up. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude.
POLICE. MAYNsioX-rEouSE.-John Robbie was charged with having commibted a forgery npon the Bank of London. Mr. Samuel Lovell, cashicr at the Bank of Lon0oni said,-I know the prisoner. He is the messenger of )tg James Boyd, jun., who is a customer of ours. Oa thp 18th of June last he came to thb bank with the cbspkPP duced for 45L, purporting to be drawn by Mr; Boyd oi our bank. I paid it to him in gold. That check was, i belave, returned to Mr. Boyd. with others. Mr. J. Boyd, jun., of 60, Mark-lane, commission agen said,-The prisoner was in my service since last Novembe$ as clerk and messenger. On the 18th of June last he absconded from my service, About ten days or a fortnight afterwards I heard he was in Scotland. I was not in the habit of sending him to the bank for money, but I used to send him to pay in money. He had access to my check. book, and T found that several checks had been torn out of it. The slgnature " James Boyd, jun.," to the cheek produced for 451. is not mine, nor was it written by my anthority. Ib is a remarkably good imitation. The number 3,007 is the same number as my check-book. I did not discover it until the officer comnmunicated with me. D. May,- the detective officer, said,-From. information which I received I went to Glasgow, and saw- the prisoner in the police-station there. I told him I was an officer, and I showed him the check for 451. and an unpaid check for 51. He said, alluding to the check for 451., " This is one which I forged and paid to the bank and got money for; I l;now it by the 7." I took him in charge and brought him here. I found no money on him. Hle said he was goiag under the nare of "John Laing." Mr. James Boyd.-About a fortnight after he left mo I found the check produced for 5l. in the prisoner's desk. That iS also a forgery of my name. I never permitted him to fill in the body of any checks far me. The prisoner was remanded till Thursday. The LoRD MAYOR requested that the press would acknowledee his receipt of a Bank of England note for 10. from *'M B. E ." for tho poor-box. GuiTDRALTA.-George Cox, a respectably-dressed man, about 40 years of age, described in the police-sheet as a commission agent, of No. 1, Harvey-street, Hoxton, was placed at the bar before Alderman CARTER, charged with cutting and wounding Caroline Cox, his wife, and WiUiam Forty (with whom it was supposed she had formed au improper connexion), with intent to do them some grievous bodily harm. There was also a charge against the prisoner of breaking a pane of plate glass, value 71. 10s., in a window belonging to Mr. Silberberg, of St. Martin's-le-Grand. Edwin Evans, a traveller living at Homerton, said about half-past 3 o'clock on Monday afternoon he was driving through St. Martin's-le-Grand, when he heard a cry of "Murder !" proceeding from the immediate neighbourhood of the Post-office, and shortly after two men ran across the road near his horse's head and tumbled down together. The prisoner was one of them, and witness saw him stab the other man on the shoulder with a knife. The prisoner then pursued a woman, whom he threw down with great violence and stabbed her while on the ground with the same weapon he had used against the man. He saw the prisoner's arm go up and down several times, but the crowd prevented him from seeing how many times he stabbed the woman. The prisoner was immediately secured by some parsons standing by, and, a policeman coming up shortly after, he (the prisoner) was taken to the station-house. The prisoner asked where the woman was when he struck Witness said she was lying on the ground against a tobacconist's window. Alderian CARTreB inquired where wi'ness first saw - the woman ? Witness said she and the man who was stabbed by, the prisoner were m-nning across the road together ; &ey were rnning from the prisoner. Thomas Bainbridge, a porter at the Queen's Hotel in S' Martin's-le-Grand, said he left by the side door about halfpast 3 on Monday, and upon getting into St. Martin's-loGrandho saw tw omen struggling, andimmediateyyafWt one of them ran away from the other. He ran towards witnets, M-ho then perceived ho had been stabbed in the shoulder. Tho prisoner -ns the other man, and witness saw him follow the woman, who ran away, pursued by the prisoner, who made two or three stabs at her when she was in front of the cigar-shop with a white-handled dagger. He was imnSediately secured by persons standing round him, and the dagger was taken from him. The police shortly after came to their assistnce and conveyed the prisoner to the police-station. The prisoner appeared in a frantic state of mmid, and scarcely knew what he was J-ohn Smith said he' was ~an extra porter at the Queen's Hotel,- and he was at the corner of Angel-street on Monday afternoon, when a man ran from the opposito corner into the middle of the road, and gave an alarm. He wfas closely followed by tho prisonler, and witnes3, supposing they were going to fight, saw the prisoner raise his arm to striko the other man. The prisoner had the dagger produced in his hand, and a struggle ensued between them, which did not last long; after which thb prisoner pursued the woman, and, after makiDng several blows at her, he stabbed her with the dagger in the breast and in the back, upon which she called out twice " He has killed me " The man who had been previously wounded was among the crowd, when the risonar turned round and aimed a blow at him with the dagger, but his arm was arrested by one of the crowd in its descent and the dagger taken from bim. Prisoner aslked witness if he had not said that ho first struck the man in-tihe road? Witness said "Io." He said the prisoner attempted,to strike the man with the dagger while in the road, bat thc man pas-ned the blow. Police-constable Andrews,107, said he was passingtbrough the General Post-offiee whenL he heard the cry of " Police," and upon hcasteninig into St. Martin's-Ic-Grand he s4w several persons trying to seeure the prisoner.

The prisoner, who appeared to feel his position most acutely, was thenremoved. WO*SIRIm-xrEET.-3Ir. Philip Solomons, a trimmingseller In Bishopsgatc-street, was charged with the following cruel assault:- A little boy, 11 years old, the son of an optician, and whose head while giving his evidence was strapped up with surgical bandages, happoned to be passing the defendant's door that morning while his servant was sweeping out the shop, and, as usual, a number of odd pins and fragments were swept into tho street. The complainant and Itwo other boys stopped to pick up some of this 'refuse, and the complainant was three times called to by the defendant, as the latter said, to go away; but the boy was rather deaf and did not hear him, and the defendant, in a fit of exasperation, leaped over his connter, seized the broom from the girl, and, grasping it with both bis hands, as one of the witnesses said, dealt the p-or boy such a heavy blow with it upon tho hed that he staggered off the pavement, and on being assisted a wound was found on his head an inch in length, from which the blood poured s8 shockingly that on their reaching the station the police were obliged to send for the divisioral surgeon to dress it. To add to the misfortune, the lad's father stated that his wifo had only just been confined, and the injury the boy had sustained, being communicated to her, had produced such excitement as to render her position most.dangerous. The defendant admi'ted the assault, though hedenied that the blow had been inflicted with both hands ; he also admitted that the boy was a quiet, well-conducted bov, but no one knew, he said, the annoyance shopkeepersexperien-cdin this way, and those who were subject to ib were very apt to lose their temper. He regretted extremely he should have acted with such violence, and would willingly make any reasonable compensation if the charge wero not pressed...fte,arewe o afoh tern such anoebpressiof feeling en the prt-ofthe dfendat, di not ish go n the cha-rge writh severity, and Mr. IV'E COIRT nltimateily consented to allow the defendant to compound for his violence by a satisfactory pecunirycompensation.

TEE AZrY AT HONE. (From the Globe.) A brief consideration of the means at our disposal, an&A the measares being adopted by tho Government with regard. to the land forces, will show with tolerable clearness that, at.present at least, there is no ground for alarm respectingthis portion of our national defences. When, after theD conclusion of the Crimean war, the peace establishraent of: the army was fixed, it was arranged that our infantry force(besides colonial corps) should consist of 105 battalions, of which 24 were to pe employed and paid by the Eastb India Company, and the remaining 8' almost equally divided between the duty of garrisoning the different, gtations at' home, and providing for the defence of our Mediterranean, American, Afican, and Australian dependencies. This huinber of battalions was bat two in excess of the establishment existing before the Russian war. and though for a time the aggregate number of men of which they were composed exceeded the total infantry establishment of 1853, yet a subsequent redacti'n from, 1,000 to 840 men per regiment placed us at the same s rength as inthat yeat of trusfful peace. About threa months ago we had some 18 regiments in the Yediter.- ranean, 10 at the Cape, 6 in British North America-, 3 in the West InAies, 7 in the AustraLian colonies, Ceylon, the Mauritius, andChina, making 44 on coloniai servicc. Besides these, some five reaimnents' were on tbeirway t, relieve others coming home, Iard four wer proceed-. ing to China. There wero thus, a4togetler,' 53 battallons. (besides the Indian establishment] abroad, and bat23, instadl of 40, at home. Since then tvwo reaiments came home from. the hIediterranean, one from the WeAt Indies, and one from,. Canada, making the number up to 32, or eight under thai proper coralement. This deficiency was partly owingto the. unsettled aipectof affairsatthe Cape, buth,dnothingunususB occurred it would have been made upin the cDurse of a fewmonths by the return home of regiments. which had completed their tour. of colonial duty. 'When, howaver, thor reinforcements were first plTacod under orders for india, wehad at home but 32 infantry regiments. Of these 14, either have embarked, or reo in progress of embarcation, and when they have left we shal} have ir. England but 1S infantry regiments to do the daty for which upon the organization of the peace establishment 40> were considered the proper complement. Now, when we have increased this number by four regimentsordered home from the Mediterranean, we havedrawvn upon the colonial garrisons as far as we eafely caa, do. Twelve regiments are little enough to garrison,.4 Gibraltar, Malta, and thelonian islands; the Commander-ian Chief at the Cape, we believe, does not feel warranted im( giving us one of the 10 regiments under his command; theo six regiments in North America cannot be considered moreo than an adequate establishment for tho extended grounnr they have to cover; and the Australian and Wes' Indian garrisons are so small that it is idlo to. anticipate making up our home establishment from these sources. Uuder any circumstances, therefore, and ia the antl. cipation that the next news from India will not be so serioau as to necessita'te further reinforcements, -a e shall havefor the garrson duty of the united kingdom, besides Guards, cavalry, and artillery, but 22 battalions of infantry, or 1IS under our proper establishment. This deficiency will be immediately made up, inthefirstplace, byraisi ng the regimentz to 1,000 men eacb, and then in aU probability byaddingsomem 12 second battalions of 1,000 men, which vill fully sujiply the deficiency caused by the draughts for India. Miiar entlemon who ought to lmow better professed to consider Cod Palmerston's declaration last night as insufficient, because he stated that in the absonce of graver intclligenee from India, it would be unnecessary to lay beforetho House. any additional army estimate. For their benefit we maF state that -when a regiment is embarked for India it is for tho time wiped off the estimate voted by Parliament, being paid for by the East India Company. If, therefore, we give 16,000 additional men to the: Company, and raiso 16,000 to replace them, we do not begimn to incur expenses for the latter until we have shifted our liability as regards the former to those who require their services. The money is already voted, and, unless in the event of some further grave disaster, neither Parliamont. nor the taxpayer need be appealed to. Fortunately, wen military reductions were the order of the day, those admirably trained corps the artilery, engineers, and marines were but lightly touched, and we can, now consequently send out 1,000 artilerymen and fourcompanies of engineers to India,nd somel,50 marines. o hina, without trenching materially on our home establishmen' The cavalry force going out (tIwo regiments) is so small that it will be likewase unnecessary to replace it at home, aud in a very short time, always assuming that the next news is not bad, we trust to find the gaps caused by the Indian reinforcements filed up vith little or no expenseto the country, and in a manner fully adequate to the plarposes of national defence.
TnE ROBBEULY By WMn4S or CHn0itoross. .- Yesterday Abel Smalley, who stands charged cwith having administered chloroform to a sailor named Wiliiam Young at Chatham, and robbing him of five sovereigns, underwent a longthenedexamination before the mayor and magistrates atRochester, when the facts, as already stated in ThcTi2)s, having been proved, he was committed to talie his triag at tho ensuing assizeE. THE TnLr, or Mss Sannrm-In Tlhe Tinues of the 9th inst. there was an artile, copied from the Ayrshire .Epress, describing the excitement produced by the trial of Miss Smith. In the course of the article it was stated that "Mr. Hibbs, an Episcopalian priest, who 'goes in' for preaching about Panler and Dove, will no doubt have a morning sermon devoted to Madeleine Smith." Mr. Hibbs wrtes to us to complain of this statement. He says he is not an Episcopalian priest, but a presbyter, that i96 an elder in the ministerial sense of the Protestant church of Englauda. Mr. HibbS, quoting a letter sent by him to the Ayrshire Express, says he did not preach about Dove, the poisoner of his wife. Mr. Ilibbs adds :-"I preached, it 3s tr.e, a sermon ubon the poisoner of his friend, and others havo since pub shed the discourse." WiTcHIcRArT.-Ritty Littlewood, the du'pe of Isaao Rushworth, the Leeds aizard, who ws tried at York a few days ago and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment on the charge of fraudulently obtaining money from the powr girl, whom he hand also seduced, waLs on Monday takon to' the Wakefield Asylum In a stato of insait. It appear- that Rukhworth after his committal to tra contrivea teoconvey to the unfottunato gid certain tbreats that sbe would suLffer if any harm came to him; that he would causeher to be haunted by devils; and thrat if he should die in prison his ghost should never leave her by dav or night Tmhe morbid impression thus excited in the girl's mind was confirmed by her seeing one of the ju yen on Rushiwortb'Ls trial twice faint in the bo-x durin einves, tigation. On Saturday last she became extremely violent, and had berestrained by main force.
