THB SrUDY OF HEBREWY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-May I beg the favour of a few lines of your va'uable space to ask attention to a subscription fund that has lately been opened for raising a few hundred pounds to be offered to the University for keeping up the money values of the only University prizes we have at Cambridge for encouraging the study of the Hebrew Bible? The Rev. Robert Tyrwhitt, M.A., late Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, who died in 1818, by his will bequeathed 4,0001. Navy Five per Cents. for the promotion nnd encouragement of aebrew learning. Owing to diminution of the rate of interest the annual income of this fund is now less by 151. than the sum required for two scholars, elected each year, with incomes at the rates that have been paid for morethau 30 years. In conseqaence of thisdeficiency it was a few weeks since proposed to discontinue one of the two scholarships; but, as this would have hbaA uch avery de. pressing effect upon a study (that of the Hebrew Bible) which m our day caUs for every encouragement, the senate with. held their sanction, considering that it would he preferable to diminish the money payments to the scholars. Another proposal, which I am happy to find has met with great approval in the University, has since been mn&de -viz., to e by subscription the few hundred pounds needed for enabling the fund to support the two scholars at their hitherto rates,of paymnent. This is the subject of the remarks with which I thus trouble you. The vast importance of the stddy which these scholarships encourage, the great necessit~ that exists (as all well know) of giving it every possible encouragemuent in order to induce the young to devote themselves earnestly to it, the powerful encouragement to a deop and accurate acquaintance with a subject which prizes worth competing for and open to University competition secure to an extent that could in no other way perhaps be secured, -tbese are some few slight reasons for not allowing a fund for the promotion of this study to lose its power-aye, even any of Its power,-if such a result can possiblv be prevented. Bdit feel that the importance of the study of the Bible in the original Hebrew cannot need in England any advocaay of mine. I am well content to leave the matter in the hands of the pnblic; and I have the honour to be, Sir. Your obedient servant. P. E. MASON'. St. John's College, Cambridge, May 25
LYMOUTTH, Monday Evening.-(By Electric TeSegraph.}-Several ships were detained off the port this morning by strong easterly winds, but have gone on this afternoon in consequence of a change. Among them are the screw steam mail packet Thomas L,we, with passengers from the East Indies and the Cape of Good Hope, bound for Dartmouth; the Spirit of the Worth, from China; the bark Alice Tarlton, Captain James Williams, from St. Iago de Cuba, April 1; and the Bombay, Captain Flainanlk, belonging to lessrs. Dunbar, of London, from Bombay, January 31, with Captain Inelish (14th Dragoons), Lieutenant Sweeny (83d), and 200 invalids, umder the command of Captain Adams (86th Regimeent). She touched at St. Helena April 9, and spoke, May 24, the ship Talbot, ountward bound. WVEST COAST or AFRICA.-PyMsoUTra Monday. -The African mail steam packet Ethiope, Commander Corbektt sailed yesterday, with 16 passengers, a full general cargo. and mails for Madeira, Teneriffe, Sierra Leone, and the West Coast of Africa. The Candace is probably at Sierra Leone, going down the coast, and the Niger at FernandoTo, coming up. As she left England on the 4th of April instead of the 24th of March, she cannot be expected home until the 16th of June, which is ten days after her ordinary time.

EINGAI,D, THE UNrrsE STATES, AND THE BAY ISLAINDs.-What have we to do with the Bay Islands? We have never advanced any claim to the possession of them. We have never professed any intention of appro- riating them. We objected to the occupation of Ruatan y Great Britain becau.se we held that occupation by her to be inconsistent with the terms of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. We required of her that she should put a stop to the dissonsions between us by a oession to Hong= a third amd neutral party, of possessions to which Honduras had always advanced a claim. To this requisition from us Great Britain finally assented. There our concern with the matter ended. How Great Britain should cede the Bty Islands, and howv Honduras should receive them, were matters for the consideration of the two contracting nies. If it is an infringement upon the independence of Hon. duras for that State to consent to a provision excluding slavery from the islands which she receives from Great Britain. surely we are not called upon to assert for Honduras what Honduras does not choose to assert for herself. If our Government has senously undertaken to interfere with the effl. ciency of the anti-slavery clause in the Angloof andturas Convention,then our Government has been guilty of an act as foolish as it was unwarrantable. if, on the other hanh, Our Government has only attempted to adulate the native Bwanombe by a semblance of opposition to that clause which was expected to vanish away in the course of public negotiation, wnat language would be too strong to demribe a piece of diplomacy so silly and so disgacefnixl Mr. Buchanan has promised the cuntry an era of common sense, decency, and PatriotiBm. Abundant o portunities for the display of these qualities was att-ed to him by his thoughtf predecessor, aSnd it was realy quite uLper. fuoma in the Senatg to afford him this fresh oecasion for their manifestation. The mischief, however, has been done, and we do sincerely trust that the President wil snake haste to redeem his pledges and to gnatify public expectation by undoing it. It surely cannot be teo late for him to learn that the actual position of affairs in Central A.merica is not such as to justify an American Executive in throwing away the faires a po bitl ch4caces of securing our legitimate influence inu that quarter of the world on an insane attempt to manufacture illegitimate relations for the benefit of the Pro. Slavery extarmists of the South. It is flatly impossirle ferms to prevent Great Britain from fUlini the Posinon in Cen,araf America to wchich she is fairly eniatled as9 thle first commercial nation of the globe, and the second in rank of hAmerean Porers. This every statlesman knows, as every schoolboy might know it, and the only ratter open to consideration by ourselves is whether we shall take up a policy of cordial co-operation with England in affairs of i'mportance to both Powers, or whet-her we shafllt.lke up an attitude of absurd and unuprofitable isolation. If Lord Napier has a"lly made a propoeition for a new treaty let that pro. positi,on he met by tbe Administration fairly and upon its Inai. with no arrire-penages of anxiety for the possible f%7u.i! of. a possible alaveholding Southern republic, bTut wvith a frank, bnslneEs-lik~e. and honourabla regard to the ermanenit inLterests of the existing Union, the hontour of the Ameerican character, and the legitimate expansion of Pe Amijumaa powqr.-N,y= yorA; Timee
CAMPBELL'S DIVORCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, MAY 25. J-hOir Lordships sat this afternoon at 1 o'clock to resume the hearing of the evidence in support of the petition of Mr. A. Campbell to dissolve his marriage with Maria, his now &ife. The following additional evidence was then adduced in support of the petition:- Julia Warton.-I live at 150, Sloane-street, Chelsea, 'Where I let apartments. Mra. Campbell came to live at my house in August last. Mr. MACQtEEs objected to this evidence being given, as the bill only charged adultery previous to the 26th of June- Mr. WYLDE said that it was merely to eho r that Mrs. Campbell had been in communication with Mr. Gsraton since the occurrences aleady before their Lordships. Examination continued.-Mr. Garston came with her. They occupied two rooms. Mr. Garston slept in a house opposite. He did not sloop at my house. lHe used to pass all day with Mrs. CampbeLl. They only spent one week at my house. MaryFord wasaservant of the last witness in August last. She had seen Mr. Garston in MIrs. Campbell's bedroom. After that she had found the bed disarranged. Ms. Campbell told her once that Mr. Garston was her brother. She had seen the keyhole stuffed with paper while they were in the bedroom together. When Mrs. Campbell went away MIr. Garston went with her. Caroline Sweeting was servant to a Mrs. Hopkins, who lived at 21, Princes-street, Hanover-square. In September last xrs. Campbell took three rooms at their house. Mr. Garston came with her. She represented him as being her cousin. He took his meals there every day. He lived in the same street. They went out in the evening together. He used to leave at 11. He would come in the morning before Mrs. Campbell was up, and wouald go into her bedroom. She had seen him in Mrs. Campbell's bed asleep. He would change his linen and wash in Mrs. Campbell's dressing room. They went away together. They stayed three weeks. She imew a person called Ann Agar. She was Mrs. Campbell's servant. Ann Agar went to Australia with her sister. Mrs. Campbell went to the ship with them. Mr. Garston accompanied them. Mrs. Hopping was the housekeeper of a lodging-house in Bury-street, St. James's. Mrs. Campbell took the first fleor. There was a drawing-room, dressing-room, and bedroom. Mr. Garston came the next day. Mrs. Campbell said he was her cousin. He took a bedroom in the house. There was a communication between their bedrooms. They stayed a fortnight. They left and returned again in November, when they again stayed a fortnight. Mr. James Smith was a merchant, in partnership with Mr. CampbelL He had lived in Sydney, and he had been acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Campoell. When Mrs. Campbell came to England he had received 5001. for her use, and had taken apartments for her. Within *few das after Mr. Campbell's arrival he heard something aboat Mr Garston and Mrs. CampbelL Mr. Campbell went to Paris soon after. On his return he went to an hotel. He said he could not live with Mrs. Campbell. Mrs. Campbell then went to the apartments Mr. Campbell took for her at Hampatead. Mrs. Campbell subsequently left Hampstead. Cross-examined.-He was a partner of Mr. Cam bell. He expressed an opinion that she was rather given to drink. ing. Mr. Campbell said that it was im roper for her to be so much with Mr. Garston, but he did not at that time know that there was anything wrong. He had seen Mr. and Mrs. Campbell at an hotel together. That was in the mRiddle of June. He had seen them there for several days. Re-examined.-He had seen Mr. and Mrs. Campbell together in the hotel three times. There was always someboody with them. M[rs. Campbell was very unwell, and Mr. Campbell teak a medical gentleman to see her. Mr. Campbell objected to Mr. Garston because he considered him a low-minded man. Cross-examined.-Mr. Campbell told him that he had been at the hotel until a late hour, for the purpose of watching Mrs. Campbell's servants. This being the whole of the evidence on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. MlACQUEN addressed the House on the pait of Mrs. Campbell. This was a ecase between a rich husband and a wife utterly destitute. If this gentleman had accompanied his wife on the voyage from Australia to England the unfortunate events wich had been detailed to theis Lordships would not have occurred, and he apprehended that when a husband separated himself from his wife without imperative necessity he could not come before their Lordships to ask for a divorce. There was Captain Wyndham's case, in which that had been clearly laid down, for he having gone to China, and left his wife in India, the House not only required proof that he was compelled to go, but also to show the reason that he did not take his wife with him. The petitioner had given no satisfactory reason for not returning with his wife in the present case. Another poimt was, that the marriage of the parties had not been sufficiently proved, and then he submitted that the bill ought to have stated that Mr. Garston was a married man. Letters and evidence would be put in on behalf of Mrs. Campbell, to show that her husband had condoned her offence ; and under ihese circumstances, he trusted that their Lordships would dismiss the petition. Several letters were then put in, written by the petitioner to Mrs. Campbell. In one dated the 7th of June, 1856, he called her his " dearest Maria," and begged her to return home and share his bed and the comforts of his home, and stating that if she would not do so he would make provision for her to live where she chose. On the 11th of June be wrote her to the same effect; and on the 9th of July, 1856, he wrote another letter stating that he had sent her another maidservant, and informed her that " that unprinciped fellow Garston" had taken a step in the action by Mv 1 h the trial would be delayed until November. He also told her not to hope to return to his house any more, but he would give anything to restore to het her lost position in society, but money would not do it. In consequence of the absence of a material witness for the defence, the further hearing was adjourned until 2 o'clock on Thursday next.
MR COBDEN AND HIS DISCIPLES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Will you allow me to say that my letter to Mr. Lindsay which appeared in your Saturday's paper vas penned without the slightest suspioion that it would meet the public eye? Otherwise, although the arguments and facts would have been identically the same, I should have written in a different and more appropriate tone. But I am more especially anxious to offer this explanation that I may do justice to my feelings towards the gen. tlemn for whose eye alone my hasty and familiar observations on the China question were intended. Entertaining as I do a sincererespe t and regard for Mr. Caird, at whose feet I sit as a pupUl in my miniature practice of husbandry, and from whom I have receive d many personal kindnesses, he is the lasb man at whose expense I should have thought of parading my superior knowledge on questions of commerc alpolicy-a superiority which, if it really exists, is attributable solely to his having applied his acute and original mind to the study of another an d equally important branch of national enterprise. I am half inclined to rap the knuckles of my friend Mr. Lindsay; but when I remember his trying dilemma, and how often I have myself been in the same woful plight, the ferule drops from my hand. He was addressing for the fourth or fifth time, I believe, in the course of a couple of months, the same audience. Under such circumstances topics are apt to ran dry, and toxts to he exhausted. What was to be done ? Tbere was rny letter in his pocket, which reached him that morning. Could it be any breach of confidence within those familiar walls, and in such a friendly meeting as he saw before him, to disclose its contents? The letter was read; and probably not until he saw every word of it blazoned to the world in the columns of 2le Times was he fully aware of all that he had done. I havo encountered the same temptation scores of times, and socumboed more than once ;-how can I then refus him absolution, or doubt that our mutual friend, Mr. Caird, will do likewise? I am. Sir. vour obedient sP?rvantt R. COBDEN. Midhurst, May 23.
RFBILuDING OF NEWGATE.-The Court of Aldermen having determined on the rebuilding of Newgate Gaol onthe cellularsystem, the plans proposed forthatpurpose by Mr. Bunning, their architect, have been adopted, and the works commenced by the demolitionof the present north wing of the prison, containing wards in which several prisoners were usuaUy congregated together, and also the condemned cells. The portion of the intended building now in progress will consist of five stories above the basement, and contain 130 separate cels, with access thereto on each story above the ground floor by means of galeries on either side of a central corridor the entire height and leneth of the building, covered with a ground glass roof. The basement story wiU contain punishment cells, baths, and storerooms, Airing yards will be attached to the building, and adequate accommodation provided for the officers in charge of the prisoners. The system of the cells and the system of ventilation will be similar to that which has been successfully adopted at the City Prison, HoUoway, which was also erected from Mr. Bunning's design. The building will be entirely fireproof, and, instead of the prisoners being as now taken from the van in view of the public. the plan for the new building is so arranged that the vau will be driven into the gaol, and the gates closed on the prisoners before they alight. In the rebuilding of the gaol the governor'c house and the external walls wiU be retained, so that the architectural appearance of the present structure no interfered with. The amount of the contractfor thae works now in progress is 12,5501., and the contractors are Mescs, Browne aLnd Robinson, of College-hill, city. 16daysfrom So pMonday.-The Hamburg ancl BCaptiain Ompanratteafiaship Petofouolis, Captain PoloUnW, whichn was tohave left to-day for Lisbon and the Brazile, ithe Saboutu90rdaye and 80,o0o00 in pcie, is detaieP d til tomorow y trifling accident, to ber screw, sustained in aulngoutofthe inner dock.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, MOND&Y, M&y 25. ADTmISTRATION OF JUSTICE. Lord DuNGANNlox presented a pUtition from several pali5hes in the county of Artrim against the Maynooth 14t.rm Lord CAMPBELL presented a petition from native inha. bitants of Madras similar to that wbich a few days ago he bad presented from the nssoclation of native inhabitants of Bombay, complaining of the manner in which justice was administered in India, and praying for an alteration in the system. They admitted that what had been proposed by the commissioners would be a great improvemlent, but they were not content with that, and thought that judges trained in England ought to be appointed to administer justice in India. He had also a petition to present from the parish of Mary lebone, praying that some remedy should be devised for ihe evils that, notwithstanding the satisfactory administration of justice in this country, sometimes arose from the conviction and panishment of a person for a crime of which afterwards he was proved to be altogether innocent. They asked that a law should be passed providing for the investigation of such cases, ard for having the sentences reversed and compensation givea to the individual. PROBATES ADMINSTRATION BILL The Earl of mALMESBURY gave notice that on Thursday he would present a petition from proctors of Doctors'commons on the subject of the Probate and Administration Bill PARLIAMENTARY OATHS. The Farl of WICKLOW said, his noble and learned friend on the wools&Qk presented a petition on Friday lat from a magistrate of the county of Hertford, in which he stated his repugnance to take that ortion of the oath of allegiance which declared that " no foreign prince, prelate, or potentate hath or ought to have power or authority, spiritual or temporal, in this realm." He was not surprised that gentlemen should object to take this sath, and he was now induced to advert to the circumstance from what had occurred in another place. He had always supported every measure for the relief of the Jews that had come before their lordships, and he could not help expressing his astonishment that the oath to which he had just referred was to be retained in the Bill now before the other Hoase. Valious Governments had propesed alterations in the oaths taken by members of both Houses, but this was the first time that any alteration had been propoeed in which this particular oath was to be retained. The noble lord at the head of the Government was reported to have said that Roman Catholic members should continue to take the oath presoribed by the Emancipation Act. Now, as a supporter of the admission of the Jews, but a still more decided supporter of an alteration in the oaths, he felt himself bound to declare tbas anxious as he was for the passing ef both measures, he would give the BDi as much opposition as lay in his power, and he trusted their lordsbips would allow no measure of that kind to pass which did not abolish entirely the objectionable oath to which he had referred. Could his noble and learned friend on the woolsack hold out any prospect that when the Bill came to their lordships' House it would be divested of this rovision, and was he prepared to say that if the biUl passedit would be extended to all Her Majesty's subjects instead of being confined to members of the two Houses of Parliament? The LORD CHANCELLOR had received no notice of this question, and, considering the irregular way in which it had been put, he did not think he ought to say a single word on the subject. (Hear, hear.) When the Bi to which his noble friend referred came before their lordships then would be the proper time to suggest any amendment which he wished to introduce. (Hear.) The Earl of WICKLOW had thought it right to advert to the subject now because when the Bill came to their lordships' House it wuuld, in all probability, be at such a period of the year as would render it impossible to attend to the matter. ACTIONS FOR CRIMINAL CONVERSATION. Lord LYNDHURST rose and said,-My lords, before we proceed in committee with the BiU of my noble and learned friend on the woolsack, I wish to snake a few ob. servations upon a point which was but little discussed upon the occasion of the second reading; I refer to the action for criminal conversation. It is right that your lordships should understnd the position in which the question stands just now. When this Bil came before your lordships a year ago a motion was made to refer it to a select committee; that motion was agreed to and a comnittee was appointed which did me the honour to choose me for their Chairman. I proposed several resolutions for the consideration of the committee, and, among others, one which recommended the abolition of actions for criminal conversation. In consequence of that resolution my noble and learned friend nea. me (Lord St. Leonard's) made a distinct motion in this Houee upon the subject. Thatv was foUowed by other motions from other members of the committee. The subject was carefully and ably discussed, and I think I may state that the generil opinion of the oommittee was that the action for criminal conversation should be, if possible, entirely abolished (hear); but there was some difficulty in deciding what should be substituted in lieu. Different members took different views and were not able to arrive at the same conclusion, and in consequence the committee did not present any report to the House recommending the abolition of actions for criminal oonversation. This is a subject of very great importance, and I thought my noble and leared friend on the woolsack intended to introduce a clause to abolish that class of actions; but I find that the Bill before us, as it now stands, so far from abolishing those actions, will continue them under a shape and form still more objectionable than at present, I think I have collected from your lordships that there is a strong feeling in this House for the abolition of this form of action. I am sure there is a strong feeling out of doors in favour of it. Whenever a case of that kind is intro. duced into a oourt of justioe we generally find that not only the learned judge, but also the advocates in the case thenselves, reprobate the action in which they are engaged, and no one has expressed himself more strongly than my noble and learned friend who sits at the table (Lord Campbell). He has more than once stigmatized this form of action as a scandal to our law, and has said, and said truly, that iu no country upon the continent of Europe is such a proceeding tolerated, and that it has been mentioned as matter of reproach by legal men from across the water 'With whom he had conversed. I believe I can corroborate that statement of my noble and learned friend. I have conversed with able and learned foreigners and never found any different opinion. In a work recently published I find these words:- "The husband pockets the money without shame. The publicity which such prosecutions necessarily occasion, and all the proofs and details of the intrigue, are highly indelicate and scandalous. The testimony, for instance, of servants-of young chambermaids who are brought into open court to tell, in the face of the public, all they have heard, seen, or guessed at, is another sort of prostitution more indecent than the first.n Such is the opinion entertained on the continent of Europe with resneot to these actions. I may say, in reference to that passage, that it is no exaggeration, but, on the contrary, falls short of the reality. I can only describe the reality by referring your lordships to a case which was heard in this House last year-the Talbot case, which lasted three days, in the course of which most indecent and imn proper details were given, whieh were subsequently printed and circulated throughout this country, and indeed throughout Europe. That, indeed, was not an action for criminal conversation, but the evidence given was of the same character as that usually given in actions of that kind. No tober, no sensible man can hesitate as to the propriety of terminating such proceedings. I will just remind your lordships of the origin of these actions. By an order made in the time of Lord Loughborough, and athis instance, it was decided that no suit for a divorce should be instituted in this House, unless the party had in the first instance obtained a verdict and damages in an action of criminal conversation against the adulterer. The object was to prevent collusion if possible, but every person who is practically acquainted with courts of justice knows full well that it is altogether idle to suppose that a proceeding of this kind will prevent collusion. I do not rely upon my own judgment vlone upon thls point, but I will refer your lordships to a pasage in the report of the Commissioners on the Law of Divorce, which I think is absolutely conclusive on this poit. Those able and learned persons say "The verdict at law is praticly valueless," and in a note they further In the majority of actions which are brought against adulterers judgment is allowed to go by default. This admits the defendant's gilt; and it only remains for the plaintiff shortly to prove the facts before the sheriff and a common jury, when damages are assessed as of course. In these cases it usually happens that no counsel appears for the defendant. The facts therefore sworn to are admitted vithoutinquiry; the witnesses are subject to no cross- examination; the causo is heard ex parte. What security against fraud is afforded by such a proceeding? If the parties are anxious to oollude, what is to prevent the plaintiff from receiving the damages with his right hand, and then, as soon as the Bill of Divoree has passed, returning them with his left? It is obvious that an action so conducted, and a verdict so obtained, re utterly undeserving of reliance or attention in considering the merits of a Divorce Bill." Thus, my lords, you perceive the object has not been gained, collusion is not prevented. My noble and learned friend on the woolsack as said that in his opinion the Bill he proposes will if passed into law operate to the extinguishment of actions for criminal conversation through the transfer of divorce suits from this Houee to the tribunal proposed tobecreated. tdonotatallagreewithhim;but even if such would be the consequence, I say that, considering the scandalous nature of these actions, it would be more becoming to the dignity of this House if they were abolished by Parliament instead of being extinguished by a mere transfer of jurisdiction. I have never been able to understand the principle on wbich these actions are founded. The princple upon which it is said they arefoundedisfllacious. An ction forcriminal conversation is not intended as a punishment of guilt, but as a compensation for the injured. Now, I ask your lordships and every rational man what oommon measure is there between the wounded feelings, the affliction, the domestic misery occasioned by a violation of the sanctity of marriage, and the pounds, shiings, and pene of a tradesman's ledgers Hear, hear.) It is impossible to compensate such injuries bymoney. Iany years age I remember the manner in which Mr. Erskine, who was fully eonversant with actions of this lcind, exressed himself when a bill was before the Oti. Bae ox Parlianenj relating to thia ubjet, That eminent andlearned man, who wa8 engaged inal]most every action of the kind Which occurred in his time, said:- " He had often felc himself at a loss how to deal with the subject when he recollected what ho was asking from a jury for the sufferer, since the man who could consider any sum as a satisfaction for such an injury deserved no damages at alL By giving damages when none could be received as a satisfaction, and allowmg no criminal prosecution, the law seemed to be most curiously contrived to disappoint both the sufferer and the publio." But, my lords, this is only part of the evil of this spedeg of action. I beg your lordshi^s to consider the state of the woman. To her the result is far more important than to any of the other parties concerned; yet she is not allowoed to appear, sbe is not allowed to examine a witness, she is not allowed to employ counsel-the whole prooeedings take place behind her back. The woman has everything at stake, her character, her fair fame, her home, the society of her children, her position in the world, all her future prospects of happiness; and yet, as I have stated, though she has such a stake in the result, she is not allowedto take any part whatever in the action. Can anything be more scandalous or more inconsistent with the principles of justice? My noble and learned friend on the woolsack has said thba the woman in these cases is generally guilty. I have known many instances during my professional career where a verdict of acquittal has been pronounced, and where I presume, therefore, the woman was innocent. I have known ceses of another description, where a verdict of guilty has been returned, but where I think that verdict was not supported by the evidence. I remember that a noble and learned friend who is now ab. sent enjo ing the charms of a southern climate stated a case within hiS own knowledge of a very bingular character. An action was brought for adultery and a verdict obtained against the adulterer. The character of the woman was sacrifioed and lost. She had,from anaccidentalcircumstance, which is of very rare occurrence, an opportunity of investigatng the case, and it was proved to demonstration, not only that she wvs not guilty of adultery, but that she never haa any intercourse with her husband. I therefore ask you, mylors, as far as thewoman is concerned, is it proper that this species of action should continue ? The noble and learned lord on the woolsack, in the observations to which I have alluded, said that the woman was rarely innocent. Be it so. Are we entitled on that account to treat her with injustice ? A man, however suspected, however strong the evidenceagainst him, is never condemned without being beard. He has a right to defend his character, to offer any. thingin initigationorpslliation of tbe chlageaginstbimsanytbingto softentheopinionofguiltwhichmaybeentertainedt6 his prejudice. Well, my lords, I pass from this to another consideratiun. An action may be instituted, and the 'woman know nothing of it before judgment is obtained. A man brings an action against a person whom he alleges to be an adulterer. Judgment is given in default. No evidence iB required, and it is not till ater judgment is pronounced that the woman knows anything of the proceedmg. I trust, my lords, I have stated sufficient to satisfy you of the propriety of putting an end to this kind of action. Some years ago a Bill was introduced into this House by the late Lord Auckland for the purpose of doing away with the action for criminal conversation. It was supported by Lord Eldon, and by many members of the right rev. bench, and passed this House by a great majority. It went down to the other House of Parliament, it was there discussed, and was supported by the Master of the Rolls, Lord StowelD, Mr. Erakne, Mr. Wilberforce, and a large number of other distingaished character I allude to this as a strong sanction in favour of the observations which Iam addressing to your lordships. My noble and learned friend on the woolsack has introduced into his Bill a clause altering and modifying the law upon this subject- but, as I have before stated, I think he mnies the law even worse than it is at present. It is not my intention, at this stage, to discuss themerits of that clause. We sball have an opportunity of doing so when the Bill comes to be considered m committee, but what I wish to impress upon the minds of yonr lordahips now is that you ought to concurin the propriety of puttinvg an end to the action for criminal conversation. A nonie and learned friend has given notice of some importnt amendments. He proposes that it shall not be competent for any person to bring an action for damages for criminal conversation. I hope he wil be able to provide a sufficient substitute for this disgraceful proceeding, and enable your lordships to send down the Bill in such a shape as will give it a fair chance of meeting the approbation of the other House. PRIVATE BUIS. On the motion of Iord BRDESDA.LE their lordships greed to the folowing resolutions :-That no private Bill shalU be read a second time after Monday, the 21st day of July next. That no Bill confirming any provisional order of the Board of Health, or authorizing any enclosure of lands under special report of the Enclosure Commissioners for England and Wales, or for confirming any schemeof the Charity Commissioners for Englandand Wales, shall be read a second time after Monday, the 21st day of July next. That when a Bil shaU have pased this House with amend. ments these orders shall not apply to any new Bil sent up from the House of Commons which the Chairman of Committees shal report to the House is substantially the same as the BiU so amended. TRANSPORTATION AND PENAL SERVITUDE BILL. This Bil was brought in and read the first time. DIVORCE AND MATRIMIONIAL CAUSES BILL. On the motion for going into committee upon this Bil, The Duke of NORFOLK rose to move that it be referred to a select committee. When the Bill was last before their lordships he took-the liberty of stating wtat were the doctrines of the Roman Catholic church on the subject He was told that those doctrines, however they might guide his own conduct, could niot be accepted by an assembly consisting for the most part of Protestants. He admitted the propriety and justice of that observation, and on the preeent oecasion would discuss the question from a purely Protestant point of view. He maintained that our owrn authorized version of the Scriptures was decisive upon the subject. But the present BiU was not based on Scripture, although their lordships were, no doubt, prepared to admit that marriage was a holy and sacred in- utlon, and ought to be treated as such. Those who had heard the very lucid and accurate scriptural arguments of two right rev. prelates on the occasion of tho ond reading must be aware that there was but one nion on the subject, and if their lordships granted the committee he 'would undertake to prove that scriptural authority was against the main principle of the BilL It might be said that this House was not a proper place for theological discussion. He asked them to remove the discusson to a committee-room. They were constituting themselves judges in theological matters, and seeking to do without evidence, while he asked them to have evidence of what they were about to do. The exceptional legislation of their lordships! House was produced as authority that there was nothing contrary to the Word of God in this measure. He found that the custom was introduced in the reign of Charles IL, when morals2 to say the least, were much relaxed. The first case was involved in considerable obscurity, and the second was strongly oontested, being carried only by a majority of eight, although the King was in favour of it, snd being opposed by 17 out of 20 bishops. Persons in succeeding generations did not pay half the attention to subseouent cases which they paid to turnpike Bills, and gradually the scriptural arguments were almost forgotten. Hre was much obliged to their lordships for the attention they had given to him. It was with reluctance that he had entered at all upon the discussion of what he considered a most painful subject, and he would rather his conscience permitted him to stand entirely aloof from it. But that not beingso, he begged to move as an amendment, "That the Bill oe referred to a select committee for the purpose of taking evidence and resolving as to wbether the permission for divorced persons to marry again has any warrant in Holy Scripture.' The Bishop of St. DiVID'S thought that the fact of the noble duke making a motion upon a question from which he might withoutimpropriety or inconsistency have stood aloof did bim infinite honour, and that the terms of the motion showed that he was ready to subject the doctrines of his own church to the same test which Protestants were iu the habit of applying to the doctrines rd their church. But he was unable to concur in that motion. There wm exoeedingly little probability of such a oourse leading to any satisfactory result. All that could be disclosed before the committee wa s already patent to every oRe, and the subject admitted of a difference of opinion 'which it was utterly hopeless to attempt to reconcile. The motion seemed to involve a proposition assumed to be unnoestionable, but for which he oould find neither sumcient argument nor adequato authority-viz,, that our blessed Lord intended to assume the character of a temporal legislator and that all his precepts and prohibitions 'were desneI by him to be embodied in the code of every Chistian legislature. He thought they were very much lowering the digniy of that l)ivine person when i tbey Viaced him on a level even with Moses, and that they were also lowering the dignity of thesacred records whrhh contained his words, injunctions, and prohibitions, 'when they turned them into a letter, which might become a dead letter, but which they sought to enforce by the Fanction of civil authority and penal legislation. If he vwere told that such was the design of our Lord, he asked for proof of that proposition.e e had never yet been able to find such in scripture, He could not find It in reason. It did not appear to be in harmony with the general tenour of our Lord's teaching, and he thought it ought to be proved before it 'was assumed. L they should assume such a principle he wanted to know where and how their lordships could draw a satisfactory hne at which to stop. There had been penodas i history 'when human legislators had felt bound to enforce the injunctions and prohibitions of the Gospel by authority and penal enactment. and he supposed al were agreed that those attempts had been unsuocessful and unfortunate in their results. It might be said they were ix judicious in their means and purposes, but be contended they were faulty in fundamentas principle. He was not to be understood as not attaching the highest possible value to eTery precept and prohibition of our Divine Master, or as not considering him in another sense as a lawgiver-namely, that everything he enjoined wa binding on Christian consciences. Rat was onething; but it was another thing to say that a Christian Legislature ,as bound to embody everything of that kind in its legislaton. He therefore humbly submitted that the duty of a Cbristian Legislature, as seuch, was to oonforra to the general Trinciples ard the spirit of the GospeL Although, on those grounds, he could not deny the right of tbeir lordships to pSEE euch a BiUl as that before the Hon.-althongh,5indeed, h contended for their lordships' liberty in that respect, he n.ust say he regarded the measure itself, on the whole, with ftelings of strong apprehension and great doubt. (Hear, bea.) If the noble and learned lord on the woolsack had, in the first instance, confined his Bill to redreasing the grievances, restoring the rights, and bettering the podition of one of the parties to the nuptialeontract, those objacts wrould have been attended w ith sufficient difficulty to engage the entire and undivided attention of the noble and lerned lord at one time; but lie th@Bisop f S. Dvids) eltthat the ten- dency and inevitable effoct oDf the Bill as it stood woula be to famsiliar "e the mainds of the peoo1Of jlx omrywt the idea that divoroe was, umder certiliancirouo%A&o j commonx incident of mariae.(Hear, hear.) liedid % think that was a feeling Wlwould conduce to the generl wellbeing of the country. On the contrary, such A notion, bowever reconcileibe it might be with the letter of o 4rta passages of the Gostel, was tnquestionably oontrary to its spirit, which undo. edlywent to preserve the marriage contract stable and inviolable, sof It was in the power of man to mnake it so. (Hear, hear.) Hle couild underat"d how desirous noble and learned lords in their lordship' House, from their experience in courts of law, must be to amend the present anomalons position of the law in this matter; but that very anomaly was to him (the Biso of St. David's) the great recommendation of the preseot Wa Everybody admitted that a good road was better than a bad one; but, surely, that very rmuch depended upon the end for which people were to travel over it, and if it was a road which tebninated in a precipice or a quagnireit would be better to shut it up altogether than amend it. He did not think the noble and learned lorcds Bill could have the effect of multiplying the number of hppy marriages in this country. (Hesr, hear.) On the contrary, he apprehended that it would open a door to a great deal of oollusion, and fail to satisfy the abstract principle on which it was founded. It was evidently limited to the usages of a certin cla of the community, with respect to whom it was not at all clear that they had the greatest need of such a meaure, and, if it were not too late to do so, he must, therefore, deprecate it as unneoessary and inexpedient, (Eear, hear.) The Earl of HARROWBY said, he could understandthe right rev. prelate feeling the deepest solicitude in reference to the Bil under consideration, for it was one which nearly conoerned the wellbeing of the whole community, and was especially worthy the grave conideration of those who were the appointed guardians of the public morals; but he thought the right rev. prelate's opposition to the measure was founded on maistaken apprehensions as to its probable effect. With respect tothe manner in which the noble duke (the Duke of Norfolk) had brought his motion under the consideration of the House he must say it was one which would only serve to add to the general esteem in which the noble duke was held wherever he was known. (Cheers.) Tne noble duke had expresed himselEf with that manliness candour, good aense, and simplicity of purpose by which he had always been diatinpuished, and which could not fal to induce in their lordships' minds the wish that he might in future take a mnore frequent part in their deliberations. (Cheers.) Butwith re t tothe motion of the noble duke, he (the EArl of HArrowby) would ask what kind of evidence he would wish to call before the proposed committeev Would the witnesses whom the noble duke would call be the prelates of his own church and those of the established church; and, if so, would their lordships be guided by testimony of that kind on the question in dispute? The matter was one on which religious opinion was very much divided, and he (the EArl of Harrowby) doubted whether their lordships would be bound by thfe evidence given before such a oommittee. Again, much would depend upon the manner in which such a committee was eonstitutd, as to the construction they might put upon the important texts of scripture bearing, upon .the question in dispute. For those reasons. it was quite clear, they could not refer to a committee a question of this kind. He contended, on the contrary, it was one whieh ought to be discussed and decided in a oommittee of the whole House when they came to the particular clause to which the noble duke's motion referred, and he therefore asked their lordships to negative the motion and prooeed at once with the BiUL Lord REDESDALE believed the question propounded by the noble duke was precisely such an one as would elicit from a sBeect committee an opinion favourable to his (the noble duke's) views; and, if the noble duke pressed his maotion to a division, he (Lord Bsdesdale) would vote in its favour. He entirely agreed with the right rev. prelate that a Christian Lgislature was not bound to enforce by positive legal enactment everything inculcated in the Scriptures: but at the same timehe thought that when an existing law of the land prohibited something which was believed to be forbidden by the Scriptures, they were not justifiedin sanctioning what they believed Ws sprohibited by Scripture, and what was certainly prohibited by law. The Duke of ARGYLL, as a member of the committee observed, that the noble duke who had moved the resolution before their lordships had raised the same question in the most distinct and direct manner in tho committee. The noble duke on that occasion proposed a resolution to the effect that it was inexpedient to sanction the principle of divorce a vincudo m4trimoni at all. How many members of the committee voted with the noble duke ? Only three out of a committee of 12. That division in his (the Duke of Argyll's) opinion, afforded a fair test of the opinions of the committee. He regarded this motion as an attempt to get rid of the Bill altogether; but although, in the opinion of some noble lords, there might be mnany imperfections in the measure, he thought the proper course would be to consider it in committee, when its defects might be amended. Lord DUNGANNON could not but regard this measure as calculated to sap the foundations of all social, moral, snd religious obligatioDs, and he should therefore feel bound to vote for the motion of the noble dvke. If the fate of the Bil dependedupon that motion hisdetermination would not be changed, for he regarded some of the provisions of the measure with the greatest alarm, believing that they would faclitate llicit connexions, and would, to a considerable extent, disturb that social and domestic happiness which had hitherto prevailed among the married class in this country. Lord DENMAX, who cocupied a seat on the frnt Opposition bench, near the bar, then rose, and having observed that he had studied the subject most attenti ely proceeded to read a written statement of his opinions. The noble lord was nearly inaudible in the gallery, but Was understood to support the Bill. He was entering into the scriptural argument on the subject, still reading from the somewhat voluminous document which he held within, or rather upon, his hat, when some cries of "Order" were raised The noble lord said, be was merely referring to the papers to refresh his memory, and to prevent his opinions from being misuinderstood. The Earl of DERBY rose to order, and said, the noble lord was not only violating the rales of the Housebyreading his speech, but he stated distinctly that he meant to read it in order to prevent misapprehension. Lord DEN N said, he referred to notes in order to refresh his memory. The EArl of DERBY said that, unless the noble lord obtained pormiseion to read a speech, ho must call upon the House to enforce its orders. (Hear, hear.) Lord DENMAN read a few more passages from his written papers, when he was interrupted by general cries of " Question" and " Order," and after expressidng his regret that he had not been better acquainted with the forms of the House, and his belief that the Bill would be attended with the greatest benefit to all classes of the community, he resumed his seat. The House divided. The numbers were- For the amendment . ...... ... 26 Against it ... ... ... ... .. 123 Majority ...... ... ... ... - 97 The House then resolved into committee en the Bil. Clauses from 1 to 5 inclusive were agreed to. On clause 6, The LORD CHANCELLORl, in reply to Earl GBEY, said, it was aot his intention to propose that questions arising under the presente Bill should be deoided by County-Court judges. At present such questions were occaionally decided by the highest tribunal-their lordships' House, and it was a reasonable proaosition to transfer them to a regular tribunal in order to remove unneCessary obstades now exsting. Earl GREY said, it seemed to him to be a bad practice to constitute boards or courts of persons whose time was at present fuUly occupied by other business. The result was that the persons supposed to transact the business had practically very little to do with it. By the present lanse the new court, which was to deal with all these questions, was to consist of the Lord Chancellor, the three chiefs of the Common law Courts, and one judge in ordinary-the judge of the new Etrobate Court. It was quite true that the single judge in ordinary might dea with all cases except those which involved dissolution of marriage; hut in tho latter cases the attendanoe of three members of the Court was necessary. The time of tbe Lord Chancellor and tho three chiefs of the common law courts wasalredy fully occupied, and from the appointment of these judges it might be inferred that the amount of business expected to come before the courts would be very smalL They had been told, however, that the objectof the Bil was to remove a great anomaly and scandal, by which those only who could pay a large price for it were enabled to obtain divorce. If so, on what gronnds could it be expected that the amount of business would be small? It was perfectly clear that if tho tribunal was constituted as now proposed one of tvro things must happeneither such a scaeeof fees would becreated as would debaraU persons who c.uld not command A large sum of money, or tho court must very soon be choked up by the mas of business that would come before it. (Hear. hear.) He must say that he had great doubts as to the policy of giving such facilities as this Bill proposed for divorce a vinculo matrimoii; but if they were to give that remedy at all they were bound, upon their own principles to provide the means by which it would be extended not to one class, but to alL He thought that kind of divorce which simply implied sepation onght to be mado more ssible than this Bill made it to the humbler clase of society. Their lordships were often disgusted by reading in the newspapers reports of cases of extreme cruelty on the part of husbands to their wives and he was afraid thatthe punishment inflictedonthebrmtal husband was not unfrequet,tly an aggravation of the evil to his wife. as he went back to her more exasperated than before. The proper remedy for such cases was to enable the wife to obtain a separation, and so put her in the way of maintaining hersf without the sear of her husband returning and taking awazy her earnPings. The present Bill failed to provide this. Indeed, no one judge could dispose of the number of cases of this kind thart would occur. The right course would ho to allow a husband and wife, in such crthat anes, to apply to the ordinary tribunals for a separa tion, instead of being compelled to go to a special tribunal appointed for that purpose. The ordiuery tribunal might have the poter to hear the chse.and then report the rosulr to some central authority tho,t might ho constituted, taet autho- re ty being authorized to grant divorce a mensd t thoro. The LeORD CEIANCELLLOR did not aCe why the expbnses of a Court should beo higher because it ws preaided over by the srupnrior judges than thi would be tfiewao preanid overr by i o persons. lIe would not conceal that the number of oa ses wras likely tb be greatly increased, hut it by no meats followred that the aourt would be unableL to gce over the busiossi HisT experbace led himn to say that it 'was alays much more esayti add to a coutt, when it wag found that its existing streztk was not auffilient, than to get rid of functionaries that had been once ap. pointed.

Lord CAMBELL thougiht tat if their Lordihips were agreed that it was expedient to tranSer the privilege of dis. solvig mariages to a newtribul, the court proposed by tho Bill wa the bt that could be formed for that purpose. Judging fosethe paucity of causes for divorces a meascl et izos-o in the present court, he doubted whether the new court wrould be at all orerborne by the wreight of business. 1he clause was then agreed to; as rwere also clauses up Upon clause 14 Lord ST. LEONARD'S wished to propose AM amendmont to meet cases of great hardship which sometimes occurred, where a woman who had been deserted by her husband became posaaed of property either by her own indnsry or tbrough the bountyof frieads, when the husband who had deserted her came down and claimed the property as his own. The noble and learned lord moved the insertion of the following after clause 14:-" Where a wife is deserted by her husband, and that desertion has continued withouj rasonable excuse for one year or upwrds, and the wife is maintaning herself by her own lawful industry, if the hue. band, or any of his creditors, or any person claiming throagh the husband, interferes or attempts to interfere with the wife in respect of ber earnings, or of any property acquired by her during her husband's desertion by means of her earnings, or to make her earnmIs or any stch property as aforesaid liable for any debt or default of herhusband, then it shall be lawful for the wife to make application to any justice of the peace nd thereupon it shall be lawful for the justice, if he sIhll think fit, upon hearing the parties, to give to the wife an order in writing, under his hand, restraining the huaband, creditor, or other person aforesaid from interfering or attempting to interfere with tbe wife's earnings orproperty in manner aloresaida which order siall be in force for sax months from the datethereof, unless sooner discharged or Taried by an order of two or moro 'U tices of the peace In petty essions, and while in forcosohall protect the wife and her earnings and property aforesaid againslall ations~, saite executions, and proceedings what ever brotight. or taken by. or on behalt of the husband, creditor, or. other person aforemaid; and any such vife shall be at. liberty, from time to thes, to apply for a renewal of such order at the expiration of the former order; and any peuon acting in vilful digobedience to any suoh order as aforesaid while in force shaU be liable to a fine not exceeding 1., and in default of paymnent to imprisonment for any time not exceeding months. Any wife, whether she has made any such apphla. tion asaforesaid to a justie of the peace or not, may present a petition to the Court of Marriage and Divorce, praying for protection and relief with respect to her property, on the ground that she has been deserted by her nusband, and that the desertion has continued without reasotable excuse for one year or upwards; and the Court, on being satisfied with the truth of the allegations of the petition, may, if it shall see fit, make an order granting her such protection and relief as atoresaid; and, subject to any specisl directions by any such order given, the wife shall by virtue of such order be and be deemed to have been during the continuanoe of her husband's desertion of her in the like position in aU respects with regard to property and contracts, and suing and being sued, as under the providons of this Act ahe woald be in can of a divorce' a mewd a ctoro obtained on her petition." The LORD CiANCELLOR said that what his noble and learned friend proposed would prove utterly impraeticablo and delusive. The Bill provided that where a wife had been deserted by her husband for two years or upwards she should be entitledto a divorce a mcusz ct thoro. It further provided that a wife divorced a mtensd et thro shoald thenceforth be in the nature of a single woman, and might trade on her own amcount. He did not think that legislationL should go further. Lord CAMPBELL thought the amendment would produce great confusion. The object was maost laudable, but the means were utterly futile, The Bishop of OXFORD understood that without the amendment the deserted wife could only obtain protection to her property after she had applied for a divorce a mensZ et tlzoro. If that were so, he objected to the clause, first, because anything which tended to increaso the number of divorces was a great evil; and, secondly, because many women would undergo any amount of wrong rather than apply for a divorce The Bishop of ST. DAVID'S asked the noble and learned lord who moved the imendment to explain how the property of the wife could be secured from her husband if her penon were not secured. If the husband came to her home and seized any little treasure she might have in her drawers, what was there to prevent his squandering it ? Lord ST. LEONARD'S said, it was the property and not the person against which the clause was levelled. The amendment left the husband that which by his desertion he had proved he did not value,-viz., the wife's person, and secured that which he desred to steal,-viz., her property. (Hear.) The Duke of ARGYLL oppoaedthe amendments Earl GREY said, he could not see how, when a man who had deserted his wife, returned and claimed to live with her, it was possible to prevent him from having a clain to her property. But, on the other band, he thought the ar-n ments of the noble andlearnedlord(LordSt. leonart's) were conclusive to show that in the humbler ranks of life some prompt remedy was highly necesary to protect a wife who had been deserted by her husband from having any little property she might have acquired in his absence seized by him, as at present, wheneTer he chose to do so. Basides, he could not understand why some local tribunal, upon due cause shown by the wife, and after the husband, if he chose to appear, had had a ful opportunity of being heard, should not be empowered to decree a separation 2 metas et ti2oro. He would not, however, give thl.t power to b ainglo Justice, however high his opinion was of the magizraev of England as a body. He bedevedthat the desired p20tection for the wife might be secured by bringing such cases within the jurisdiction of (as we understood) the County Courts. The Earl of POWIS supported the anendmena, believing that the difficulties of dealing with the class of cases in question by a single magistrate, consistently with qiving full protection to the wife, had beeu much exaggeratec. Lord DUNGAlNON said, if there was one cla-s of persons vho more than another required legislative protection it was that of poor women in the humbler ranks, who, deserted by their heartless husbands, iere struggling to maintainthemselves, and often, it might be, ayourir and helpleesfamily. He was therefore gLadthat Sclausoft this description had been brought fonrard by his oble and learned friend (Lord St. Leonari's), and if it should pass the House it would be almosS the very best thihg tho Bill contaied. Lord WENSLEYDALE addressed a few words across the table on the subject under discussion, but in so low a tone as to be inaudible in the gallery. The Marquis of SALISBURY supported the araendment. The LORD CHANCELLOR said, that if a hus'ard.vwho had deserted his wife without reasonable cause retknried to her, this clause wouldnot prevent him from forcir4 himnIlf upon the wife and possessin: himself of any prop,.rty she might hsve acquiredduring his absence. It was trite that, if tSe husband remained for a day or two without taking his wife's property, she mightgo toa justice of the p, -teo, who might give her an order in writing restraining the busband, or any person claiming through him, from intertft i.g with the wife's earnings orproperty. Hethoughtit would be very dificult to carry out the provisions of this clause. Tihe order was to continue in force for six months, but unless it vere renewed upon the application of the wife. the'e was nothing to prevent the husband, at the expiration of the ix months, from sweeping swav aU his wife's property. He maintained that it was inipaKoible to devise any effective remedy unless the status of thte woman wero altered. le wished to see the term " separatio " substituted for "divorce d inead ct a2ro" in the law of this country; for in the event of a sepaation being decreed the husband would bave no right to force himself uprn his wife, who would then be effectually protected. Lord ST. LEONARDS said, tho object of the clan e wvar to afford protection to women rho, being deserted by their husbands, contiived, by their own industry, to o,tpport xiemselves, and probablytheir children, and to accrunulate a little property in the shape of furniture, but who were entirely at the mercy of their husbands, who, if tbhey returned, might at once dispose of the property so acquired. He was anxious to afford -rompt relief in such caseta, and if the clause he proposed did not effect his object he was ready to receive any suggestions by which it might be accomplished. The Earl of DERBY entirely went along with his noble and learned friend in the jprinciple of his clause, but was afraid that the clause, as it stood at present, would be too slow in its operation. If a woman, deserted without reasonable cause by her husband for one or two years, and durin, that time left to maintain herself and children, were enable&i to SÃ¯Â¿Â½ before a magistrate and obtain temporary protection wit out proceeding tothe length of gettinkadivorce a emns d thoro, such a provision would be most Iaseworthy, and would meet a gross case which loudly oUled fo, remedy; but, if the proposed clause only enabled the wife to apply to the magistrate atfter the husband's return, then the Imischief would already have been done. lIe, however, understood that his noble and learned friend des,im to take the division, not on the precise words of the vlause, but on. the queslion whether a woman so deserted shonld have & short and summary remedy for the protection of ber pro. perty-not by a permanent divorce-and in favour of that principle he was prepared to give a cordial and unitesitating 'vote. iarl GRANVILLE said tbat, though every one appeared to concur in the object of the clause, it seen-ed to be adsnitted on all hands that the clause as it stoo-d at Vresent ould hot be practicaUy carried out. He therxfore declined to vote for a clause which was kely to be perfectly useless. The Bishop of OXFORD suggested an amendment of the proposed clause, enabling the deserted wife to^ a,nplv to a magistrate, and, on showing thatahe had erqeasnto fear that herhusband or any of. his creditors would interre with her earnings, to obtain protection for her prolierty. lord ST. LE:ONARD'S aid that if the elaie weso -nowr agreed to any n esa correctieh culd be rmk6e in it upoD the uext stage of tbe BilL The EArl of WICKLOW thought the clause baa better be postponed, and an atended one lulbnited to the HoEst. IEarl GREY thought the HTouse oughit to adopt some simple and cheap mode by wbicht either a hLusband or wife Dgghopply to a local tribunal for relief. hoped, there. tere, his noble aud learned friend (Lord St. Leonard's) w-ould not. precs his clausa at presant, bust ndeavous, onptheetir6, to bing up a duse whichwnould, in the wayhe hadno4 aeggested, deal wfith the whole evil. If Eel, Majestys Govermnent would undertake to consider the subject, with the view of providing a suitable remedy, he 7 i them on the present occasion, should his noble and learned friend go to a division; but if they would not undertake tbis, then bo would be compelled to voto for the clase, however defective he might think it to be. The LORD CHANCELLOR had no hesitation in saying that the Government would most seriously consider the smatter before the next stage of the Bill, but he hoped that ia saying so he should not be misunderstood. No one could Ceel more anxious than he did to arrive at the conclasion which his noblo and learned friend aimed at, but he saw clearly the dinicultiic that stood in the way. He believed that it was ispossible to come at the result he wished to arrive at, unless a new status were constituted, in addition to the two that already existed. Till they could adopt some mode of having a separation between man and wife, every attempt of his noblo and learned friend to secure the object he had iu view would be delusive. All he could say was that he would most seriously consider the question; but he could not say that he should be able to come to asatisfactory result. More than this he oould not say, s he was most desirous not to raise hopes which he might not be able to realize. (Hear.) The Bishop of OXFORD hoped the House would observe that the noble and learned lord had not promised anything which could be construed into a desire to carry out the wishes of his noble and learned friend (Lord Sr. Leonard's). The point which he promised on the part of the Government to consider was the modo of effecting the separation of a wife from her husband; but that was not what his noble and learned friend's clause aimed at. The noble and learned lord (the Lord Chancellor) spoke of a third status, but no new stctus was meant by the clause now before the committee. The object which the noble and learned lord had in view was one quite different from that provided for in the clause, and therefore he hoped it would be clearly understood that the matter which the Government had agreed to consider was one of a very different kind from that contended forBby his noble and learned friend. (Hear). Earl GRA1NVILLE said, the statement of his noble and learned friend (the Lord Chancellor) was mado at the suggestion of the noble earl (Earl Grey), who recommended that the clause should be w ithdrawn, and that Her Majesty's Government should seriously consider the question. l[is noble and learned friend had stated accordingly that he was 7illing to take the matter into his serious consideration provided, of courso, the clause were withdrawn. If that step were not taken then they must divide the House. The committee then divided, when there appeared,- Contents ... ... ... ... ... 52 Nonxcontents ... ... . .. ... ... 44 Majority .. ... ... The clause was then agreed to. Upon clause 16, Lord ST. LEONARD'S objected to the power given by the clause, and preferred that proposed by the Bil of last year, which gave power to the court to grant alimony in certain cases of desertion of a wife, but not divorces. He therefore proposed, according to the noble and learnedlord's own view last year, to confine the provision in this section to alimony, and to omit the authority to grant a divorce & mensd a thoro in the case therein provided. The Bishop of OXFORD agreed with the noble and learned lord, and considered the power given by the clause as most monstrous. A man might be absent from this country upon perfectly legitimate business, and his wife might bs persuaded by some cunning person to ask for a divorce, which, under this clause, would be granted, without the husband having any opportunity of opposing it, or even of knowing anything of it. The LOKD CiHANCELLOR replied, that to hold that a divorce was nma to be allowed during the husband's absence would be to prohibit all divorces upon the ground of desertion. After some conversation it was arranged that the clause should be consilered before bringing up the report. The amendment was withdrawn and the clause negatived. Upon clause 16, The Marquis of WESTMEATHI moved a clause to precede it giving power of remarriage in cases where the husband and wife hsd been separated for 20 years and upwards, founded, as he said, upon the words of Holy writ, " That it is not well for man to be alone." He would undertake to show that under the existing state of the law such an amendment was just and necessary. He agreed in think. ing that the property of the wife, as well as everything else relating to her, should be protected from unkindness and unnatural treatment on the part of the husband, but, from the example he was about to produce, he would undertake to forfeit his existenceif it did not appear to the minds of candid persons that ib was in the power of any woman separated from her husband a Taes6 et thowr to act in such a wayas to make her husband's life totaly unendurable. No sooner was it certain that this Bil, or one like it, would be introduced than there was put forth a book of 200 pages, surre titiously p ted and privately circulated, with the name ofthe lady who didhimthe honour to caU herself by his name. It was seut to all the clubs, and within the last fortnight an extrercely severe and, as he thought, libeUous article had appeared in a respectable newspaper, connecting him with the subject-matter of the Bill. That was his justification for taking the liberty of proposing thisclause and stating reasons 'why their lordahips should adopt it. The newspaper, next day but one after he had given notice of his intention, expressed an opinion that the judgment of the public should in the meantime be suspended. He had felt it necessary to make au explanation to their lordships in order to protest himself from the grossest per. versions of matters of fact, and some of the most unjustifiable untruths that could be put together to blast and ruin t e reputation of the man who was the subject of them. 'T he book to which he had alluded was dedicated to hisnoble and learned friend who sat near him (this was supposed to be Lord Lvndhurst) and to another noble and learned lord not then in the House. When an attempt was made to dishonour a man in his position, to make him unfit to move in a respectable circle of society, and to disentitle him to sit in their lordships' assembly, their lordahips would probably think that it was but natural in him to wish, and indeed highly incumbent on him, to defend himself against charges so serious. In the first piace, he stood in the situation of a man whose reputation and comfort in life had been dealt with by the institution which their lordships were about to abolish; and under the circumstances he was about to state be thought he had a claim to their lordships' indulgence on that occasion. The book In question was published by M1r. Ridgway; and how it happened that he, a most respectable man, consented to receive and become the depositary of such a production he (the Marquis of Westmeath) could not understand. He was sure that gentleman must have been grossly imposed upon, for otherwise he could not have consented to publish such a book. The noble marquis was proceeding, when Lord REDESDALE (the chairman of the committee) rose and said he felt it his duty to caU the noble lord to order. (Cheers.) He could well believe their lordships would on a proper occasion afford the noble marquis an op. portunity, if he wished it, of putting his own eonduct in the light in which he desired it to be held * but when the House was in committee on a Bill it was hardly allowable to Permit ihe noble marquis to introduce a matter in which he was personally concerned. (Loud ories of "Hear, hear.") He (Lord Redesdale) therefore trusted that the noble marquis, in moving this clause, would confine himself to such remarks as fairly bore uspon the subject under consideration, andnot enter into a discussion upon a topic which, however much he might desire it, was irrelevant, and which their lordships would probably permit him to bring under their notice on a more fitting occasion. (Cheers.) The Marquis of WESTMEATH resumed. He was sure the noble baron (Lord Redesdale) was only in the strict exercise of his dtuty in interrupting him in the way he had done; but he (the Marquis of Westmeath) had stated in the outset that he would lay before their lordships grounds for the adoptiou of this clause, and prove before them that the position of a woman living apart from her husband -by the machinery, as he might call it, of a separation i mnensd et tforo-was nob such as the law ought to tolerate in this country, but that such a state of the law onght to be repealed, and repealed in such a manner as to show that after a woman had been separated from her husband 20 years or upwaTds she was not to be permitted to make use of that liberty- she being a wife without a husband-to asperse and injure his character, and render him unfit for society; and he submitted he was now but following the course he proposed to himself when he rose to make the motion w.hich he had brought under the notice of the House. e book in question started by stating that he was a villain. Was he right in stating that as a ground on which the present lawv should be altered ? The Earl of DERBY rose to order. He was very sorry to have to interrupt the noble lord in his vindication of himself before their lordshipse House ; but he was quite sure his noble friend would see, on a moment's reflection. e subject he was introducing was exceedingly painful to the House (cheers), and one which be (the Earl of Derby) thought m. ast he not less painful to the feelings of his noble friend himself. He thought his noble friend would feel the di'diculty of tracing any connexion between his own case and thfe clause he was pro-posing. What his noble friend complained of was a series of scurrilous libels against his character, for which the law as it stood already gave him a remedy; but the clause he was now proposing would not afford him the slightest remedy for any injury his reputation might have suffered from that cause. He would therefore appeal to his noble friend not to pursue a course which he was certain must be painful to his noble friend's own feelines as well as to the rest of the members of their lordships' House. (Cheers.) The Marquis of !WESTMEATH said, in consequence of the appeal which had been made to him by his noble friend he would not persist in the motion which he had brought before the House. (Cheers.) His noble friend had said the law was open to him, but he (the Marquis of Westmeath) would defy any lawyer to point out a remedy in a case where a book of the nature of the one in question had been circulated surreptitiously all over London, without any printer's name to it. The noble Marquis then withdrew his motion, and clause 16 was agreed to, as were clauses 17 and 18. On clause 19, The Earl of DONOUGHMORE said, the existing law enabled a husband to obtain a divorce, but did not give the wife similar power, except in the case of incest, bigamy, or aggravated cruelty. He did not see why married women ehould not be placed upon the samefooting as their husbands with regard to divorce a vincuco matrimonii, and he moved as an amendment the insertion of words in the clause to effect that objeot. The LORD CHANCELLOR said there was an appear ance of great justice about the proposal of the noble earl,namely. that the same privilege should be accorded to the one sex as to the other. .Primd fade that seemed to ba a very reasonablo proposition. Their lordships had not, howover, to consider whether the sin was as great in the one Xcese as in the other, hut they w ere required to adopt such leslation as might he most expedient for this country. Te question was not whether a husband who GcJ, be equally guilt' with a wife, but whether such an act of *mpropriety or of sin on the parb of a husband called for tthe same remedy which ought to be afforded when a sinlar act was committed by a wife. Without entering into any discussion ofthte question upon moral or religious grounds, every man must feel that the injury was not the anMO. (Hear, hear.) A wife might, without any loss of caste, and possibly with reference to the intezests of her children, or even of her husband, pardon an act of adultery on the part of the husband; but a husband could not pardonap aamilar act on the part of a wife. (Hear, hear.) No one would venture to suggest that a husband could possibly do so, and for this, among other reasons which had been pointed out by jurists-that the adultery of the wife might be the means of palming spurious offspring up?on the husband, while the adultery of the husband could have no such effect with regard to the wrife. It was true there might be cases of adultery in which it wvas impossible for a wrife to pardon her husband; but in such cases a remedy wJas already afforded to the wrife. The Earl of DONOUGHifORE remarked that the amendment he proposed would assimilate the law of this country to that of Scotland, where the existence of such a remedy had had no injurious effect upon the morals of the people. Lord LYNDHURST said that, on the second reading of this Bill, he had stated as fully as he was able the arguments by which he thought the motion of his noble friend might be sustaied. He felt very strongly upon the subject, but he would not occupy the time of their lordships by repeating the arguments he had before urged, He had heard noting on the present or on forme oCCasions which at aUl affected the opinion he had formed on this important question, and If his noble friend pressed his amendment to a division ho would vote in its favour. He thought that as an act of justice the concession requested by his noble friend ought to De made. Lord CAMPBELL observed that this question had been most carefally aud deliberately considered by the commissioners upon whose report the BiU was founded, and they came to an unanimous conclusion that it would not be safe to make any further relaxation of the law. They were of opinion that a wife should only have the right of divorce when it was impossible that she could continue to cohabit with her husband, or that condonation could take place,namely, where incestuous adultery occured, or other cases of extreme aggravation. They thought that in the nature of things there was a material distinction between adultery on the part of the husband and adultery on the part of the wife, and that it would leadi to the most lamentable consequences if the wife, in any case of adultery on the part of the husband, unattended with aggravating circumstances should have the power to insht that the marriage should be dissolved. The example of Scotland had been referred to; but that was a country with a smal population, with pecular habits, and very religious notione, and, withont meaning any disparagement to England, he might be permitted to say that that which operated innocently in the one country might operate prejudicially in the other. | The committee divideda- For the amendment ... ... 20 Against it ... ... ... ... ... n Majority ... ... .,. -51 The amendment was accordingly rejected. Lord LYNDHURST said that on the second reading of the Bill he mentioned that he would move certain amendments in the committee; and in pursuance of that promise he should now propose an amendment to the clause to the effect that wilful and malicious desertion for five years should be a suffcient ground on which a dissolution of marriage might be pronounced. It was not his intention to fatigue their lordships by again going over in detail the grounds he had laid before them on a former night insupport of this proposition; but would merelystate, for thepurpose of recallng his argument to their lordBhips' recollection, the points he rehed on. First of all, the desertion his amendment contemplated was a breach of one of the most sacred and solemn engagements which man could contract, and a breach of the contract on the one side justified and called for the liberation of the other party from it. In the next pace, it entirely defeated all those important objects for wlich marriage was instituted; and, thirdly, the effect of this breach of contract on one side was an act of the greatest cruelty to the other party. UInder these circumstances, he urged, if one of the parties to the contract dis regarded all those points to whioh he had referred, and practically put an end to the marriage, it was the height of lnjtstice that the other party should continue to be bound by it. Then the remaining question was whether this dissolution of the contract under such circumstances was consistent with Scripture. It was not for him to argue a question of this hiand in the presence of the right rev. bench. He had alrzady stated to their lordships that all the great authorities on this subject went one way. He had reminded the House that this was a subject that received anxious and mature deliberation at the time of the Reformation, and that the result of the discussions which then took place Was to establish this aA a scriptural ground of divorce, He believed #*erd was no dissenting voice upon the question, and he might refer to a few of the names of the distinguished men who took part in those deliberations, and who concurred in affirming that principle. He might mention Archbishop Cranmer, the Bishop of Winchester, the Bishop of Ely, the Bishop of London, Martin Bucer, and many other distinguished men. He might further refer to the names of Peter Martyn, Luther, Melanethon, and a long hit of eminent men who held the same opinion that w desertion was a ground of divorce. Everybody knew that in consequence of the conclusions then arrived at every Protestant church on the continent of Europe acted upon the principle and had done so from that time to the present, that wilflf desertion for a certain period was a sufficient scriptural ground for divorce a vinculo Mrntmonii. In England a tribunal composed of men eminent for their learning and ability came to the ananimous agreement that malicious wilful desertion was a scriptural ground of divorco. Among the distinguished men who formed that body were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of London, Winchestr, and Ely, Latiner, Parker, and a great many other eminent divines. In Prussia, where the nuestion had been long and seriously considered, and wlhere many alterations had been made in the law of divorce, they retained two special grounds ofV divorce,-viz., adultery and desertion. By the law of Scotland desertion for four years was sufficient to annul a mariage, but he proposed that the period should be five years. It would, perhaps, be said this was in opposition to the law of England, but the object of the Bill was to correct the law, to act according to justie, and according to nature and reason. tie proposed this as being in accordance not only with justice and equity, but with the doctrine of Scripture, and he trusted it would receive the sanction of their lord8hips. The noble and learned lord then moved his amendment, that wilful desertion without cause for a parsed of five years should be accepted as suaficent ground for pronouncing a dissolution of marriage. The LORD CHANCOELLOR opposed the amendment as one which would lead to the greatest difficulties. The moment they stepped beyond the single cause of divorce -adultery-where were they to stop? If desertion for five years was to be a ground of divorce, why not desertions for four, or three, or two years ? It would come to the same state as existed in the north of Germany, where people might be divorced for incompatibility of temnper, or other causes of that kind. When once a principle was introduced into our social system nothing was so difficult as to go back (tear, hear.) le declined enterinu into the religious part of this subject, or to argue upon artocular texts of Scripture or hthought thatthey should be guided rate by ther spiritof those Holy Writings than by the words of particular Lord LYND}IURST was surprised at the meagzreness of te arguments upon which the noble and learned lord based his opposition to tho clause. As to the question of where were they to stop, he would reply they should go no further than was consistent with the Scriptural construction of divorce. In Prussia the line had been drawn just at that point. So in Scotland, where the law of divorce was less contracted than in this country, no inconvenience had been felt and no desire expressed for any change. The noble and learned lord had said nothing of the breach of the sole6nn compact of marriage, nothing of the cruelty and hardship inflicted upon women who were the victims of the laws which were made. He repeated that marriage was a compact of a most solemn character, and that if it were broken mercilessly by one party, how was it consistent with justice to bold the other party bound by it? He would not refer to texts of Scripture, but to the authority of able and learned men, whose business it had been to studythe Hol Writings, and whose conclusions bore him out in the course he was now taking. The Bishop of ST. DAVID'S was surprised that the noble and learned lord had adduced no Scriptural argament in favour of his proposition, and thought the objections of the noble and learned lord below him (the Lord Chancellor) had not been answered. Lord LYNDE[IJRST observed that he could give Scriptural authorities, but he conceived them unfitted for discussion in such an assembly; neither would it e fair to disacuss themn without giving a full OPPOrtunitY for eonsideration. He insisted that the church of this portionoou island formed the only exception to Protestanism upon this Point. o s the this The DuLke Of ARGYLL opposed the amendment as inexpedi-ent. Lord C A-MPBELL thought the amendment was contrary to the principle of the Bill, which was to change, not the law of divorce, but the administration thereof. Their Lordships divided on the amendment and the numbers were:- Contents ... ... ... ... ... lfon-contents.. . ... ... ... 97 Majority against the amendment ... 49 The Bishop of OXFORD, on the question that the clause should stand part of the Bill, said the evil of it waa contained in the 43d clause, which gave an interpretation to tne dissolution of marriage to which he could not consent. He should be obliged, therefore, on that clause, to submit to their Lordships his reasons for opposing it. The Earl of DERBY put the case of a man -who had committed incestuous adultery with his wife's sister, and whose marriage was dissolved on that ground ; and he asked if that dissolution of the marriage, by which the party with whom the husband had committed incest was no longer his wife's sister, wonld preclude him, under the BiU, from marrying the woman with whom he had committed incest, the lawas it at present stood prohibiting a man from marrying a wife's The LORD CHANCELLOR said his present impression was that the husband would not be at liberty to marry. the sister in that case, for the marriage would still be incest. If a person had criminalcomnexion with a woman itwoudbe incest afterwards to mary her sister. iThe Earl of MALMESBTJRY asked if a wife who might obtain a divorc by this Bill on account of her husband's inmcestuous adultry was placed in the position of a woman who vas dead, as respected the relation of the husband to her sister. The LORD CHANCELLOR said clearly he would nsot be at liberty to mar his wife's sister in that case. Earl GREY desired to know if in the case of a man who contracted marriage, and it afterwards turned eut that he had had year before criminal intercours with his wife's sister, such a m Darriage would be nulL tho connexioa -with the unmarried woman made the mar. riage with her sister impossirle. It would be a around for Fetting aside mech a marriage ag being null and void, because by the law ecesiastical it was an incestuous cousmixture. The clause was then agreed to. On clause 21, The Earl of MALESB1URY moved two amendments, he object of one of tbem (wvhich he subsequently withdrev) being (as we understood) to prevent the remarriage of parties8previonsly divorced, and that of the other being to prohbit persons from pctitioning for divorce who should be proved to have notoriously cohabited together before marriage. In reply to a question from the Duke of ARGYr,, The Earl of MALMESBURY said his wish was to prevent personc who had been guilty of adultery, who had been divorced, and who had re-married, from again applying for a divorce if either of them proved unfaithful. He considered that a person, however innocent, who marfied a divorced adulterer or adulteress ought to be deprived of the remedy of divorce. The Bishop of OXFORD was understood to say that a case had come before that House in which a divorce apphed for by a husband was refu-sed unon the ground that he himself had seduced his wife, whom he had married after her divorce, and that he was not therefore entitled to the remedy which might have been extended to a man who came into court with clean hands. The LORD CHANCELLOR said he saw no objection to some provision which would meet such cases as the noble earl (Slalmesbury) had mentioned, but he did not like offband to pledge himself to any alteration of the existing law. He would, however, consider the subject before the report 'was brought up. The clause was then agreed to, as was also clause 22. On clause 23, The Bishop of OXFORD called attention to' the circumstance that this clause provided that a husband who obtained a divorce from his wife might be required to allow her alimony to such amount as thie Court, having regard to the ability of the husband and the conduct of the parties, should think reasonable, but that the Bill made no provision for the allowance of alimony to a wife who obtained a divorce against her husband. The LORD. CGANCELLOR expressed his readiness to consider tbe propriety of altering the clause. The clause was agreed to, as was also clause 24. The Earl of DERBY gave notice that his noble and learned friend (Lord St. Leonard's) would bring forward on the report the clause of which he ),ad given notice, constituting adultery a isdemeanour, and imposing a fine on the adulterer, The Bishop of ITNCOLN hoped that the clause would baebrought forward in a modified form, and that the adulter would be made Iable to imprisonment as wetl as to fineb.- Clauses from 25 to 42 Inclusive were agreed to. On the 43d clause, giving liberty to parties to re-marry, The Bishop of OXFORD opposed the clause, observing that the more he studied the subject the more he was convinced that the Scriptural argument was plain and clear in not allowing the remarriage of the parties. Supposing, however, the case to be doubtful, what were the alternatives 7 On the one hand they might possibly be withholding in a few evil cases a liberty which,it it couldbe granted with safety in others, might be granted,-that was all; but if, on the other hand, they made the law directly antagonistic, not to certain texts taken out of Scripture, but to the tenur of the instruction of our Blessed Lord on the subject, they opened a path for sin, and almost .certainly led the coming generation into trifling with this holy ordinance. It bad been said thattherewas nottheleast reason to apprehend this danger, because theytook their stand on unassailable ground, but that if they admitted other causes but adultery for the dissolution of marriage, then all those evils which were anticipated by some might follow. But had they not heard one who might be styled the Nestor of their assembly argne that it was a Scriptural relaxation to grant divorce for five years' absence; therefore how impossible it was to say that they took their stand on unassailable ground. The only argument beside the Scriptural one that had been urged -.as the example of Scotland; but, looked at closely, the case of Scotland afforded no real indications of the working of the system. The law of that country had been to a very great degree modified in practice by her relationship to England. The overshadowing effect of the union with England had prevented Scotland from running into tle same extreme as the natives of the continent, and passing from one degree of liberty to acother in the matter of marriage. Then, in considering thrs uestion, they ought to take into account tle act that the whole of Christendom, from the ve.y earliest date, both in the East and West, has maintain d views contrary to those laid down in this clause. His nob!e and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) referred the other evening to the case of Napoleon, but even the example of NaIleon was not a case in point. By a rule of the Council of Trent it was provided that in every nation in which its canons were pubished tas part of the national law theie should be necessuaily present a priest and at least two witnesses to make a marriage valid. In Fran. e these canons had been published as part of tLe law. Napoleon was married without the presence of the necessary witnesses; and afterwards when he re-estat - lished the Roman Catholic faith he wasstrongly urged to te married according to the requirements of the Council l f Trent, but he declined to do so lest he should shock too much the feelings of those who had been married in the same way as himself. The Court of Rome therefore did not pass a divorce, but pronounced his marriage naU and void, and Austria took care to have the fullest investigati. n into the matter before consent was given to a marriage with Napoleon, so that there could be no doubt as to the legstimacy of any issne that might foUow. As to the Eastern church, the lax practicesshich prevailedin the countries under its influence showed the lamentable consequences that must ever foUow a departure from right pmnciple on the question of marriage. The practice there had led to the greatest laxity; but the canons of the Eastern church declared that though there might be a dissolution of marriage on account of adultery there could be no remarrage. Reference had been made to the time of the Reformation; but there could be no doubt that many of the men of that time, eminent and learned as they were, had gone to an extreme in their views as to the ground on which marriage might be diesolved. No one would pretend to say that there was any deaand from the people of this country for such a change as was now proposed. On the contrary, it must be admitted that there was universal acquiescence in the present state of the law. [Lord CArPBELL heie made an observation that was inaudible in the gallery.] The noble lord spoke of priviegium, but what were those privilegia but acts of that House to save particular people from the penalties of bigamy ? (Hear.) He pledged himself, if their Lordships threw out the obnoxious clause, that he would come down to the House and oppose every case of pr - vitegium that was proposed for their consideration. (Hear.) He repeated that the people of this country desired not t:ns state of things; thev had the example of other nations showing to what evils the loose practices they had adoptei led them, and he would ask, why not stop the granting o those privile& here? They had gone on giving those pri zilegia so long that now they felt they could not refuse to consent to the extension of the indulgence, and therefore were prepared to grant it to anybody. He prayed them noto endanger by such a me&sure the morals of the people o- England. They might depend upon it that if they admitted these changes the administration of the most nice and delicate questions would be left to tribunals wholly unfit for the task. If they opened a court in London for the consideration of questions like these, how would it be possible to prevent their being stirred even to the lowest depths cf society? Where, he asked, were the crowds of petitioneTs asking for this liberty? Where were the husbands and wives asking to be set free from their bondage? (Hear.) He believed,that the glory of the people of England, the blessedness of its holy homes, the domestic happiness of the country, with its family charities and family chastities, would be endangered by the passing of such a measure as the present, and therefore he felt himself conscientiously bound to oppose it with all his might. He begged to move that the clause be omitted from the Bill. The Bishop of BANGOR supported the clause. Lord CAMPBELL said, the question was whether a marriage was to be dissolved and the injured party to be prevented from marrying again. He was surprised to hear the right rev. prelate (the Bishop of Oxford) assert that remarriage was contrarv to the laws of England. He (Lord CampbeU) maintained that it would be contrary to the laws of England to dissolve a marriage and stil not to allow the injured party to marry again, that was meant by putting away a wife, putting away with liberty to marry again. With respect to the argument that the divorces granted by that House were nivkgia granted to particular individuals to exempt them from the penalties attaching to an infringement of the law, he declared that to be P. mere iugle. Evey husband who came with a just cause, who proved his injury, was de jure entitled to a divorce, and, having obtained it, was de jure entitled to marry again. Lord WENSLEYDALE said, the common law of England was that marriage was indissoluble (hear, hear), and the granting of divorces was merely arelaxation of the law in the husband's favour. The LORD CHANCELLOR said that whether the dissolubility of marriage was past of the law of the land or a system of privileg a, was a mere question of words. If it were a system of privegia it was one from which it was imupossible to depart. e did not understand how any noble lord wzho had voted forthesecondreading could vote against this clause, because without the clause the Bill would have no object. The Earl of DERBY said, it had been contended all along that there was a necessity for giving the injured party the remedy to marry again; but the clause did not confine the remedy to the injured party,Jbut gave it to the guilty parties s welL It was perfectly trae the remedy was now generally given to both, but there were cases, he believed, in which It was withheld from the guilty party. He was inclined to concur vith the view of the most rev. prelate the Metropolitan, who had given notice of an amendment to per mit only the injured party to marry again. He had some doubts whether, as a most serious check to adultery, they ought not to prevent marriage with the person with wbom the adultery vwas committed. He saggested that, at all events, the amendment of the most rev. prelate to debar the guilty party from marriage should be taken before the amendment of the right rev. prelate to debar both the injured and the gailty parties from marrying again. The Archbishop of CANERBURY was understood, in oompliauce with the suggestion, to move his amendmena debarring the guilty party from marrying again. The LORD CHANCELLOR opposed the amendment of the meet rev, peblate as being inimical to morality.. It might bea question whether their lordsbips would allow the mIuty paramonrs to marry, but surely they were not going toeat that, having dissolved an existing marrige, they would say to one of the parties, "You shaU not marry again?' Suppose a marrrige dissolved at the instance of a wife; woald they say to the husband, " You shall not marry again; you must live with a mistress for the reanaider of your life 91" He (the Lord Chancellor) could not concev a raecnal to society than would result freea s~cl a sW otthins, H t-hought it would bo alik@ grgl i

C"AVRY COLTZGZ, PIOsmOND.-Yeaterday afternoon the foundation.stone of an ingtitUtion long needed in the British service was laid at Richmond, under the most favourable auspices. The object is one which almost speaks for itself-to give a sound practical knowledge to such sentClemen as intend to enter tne cavalry service as a profession, and to supply that knowledge the abeence of wvhich during the late war made the chivalrous courage of our monnted troops almost a synonyme for waste of Uife The new college close to Richmond-green is founded under the most distinguished patronage, including, of course, all the leading cavalryoffcersofthedayandal numberofihearistocracy, who take a warm interest in all that reates to the efficiency of that branek of the service. Among others presentyesterday were the Duchess of St Alban's% the Earl of Essex, the Ladies Pelham-Clinton, aieutenant-General Lord Downes, Lady Raglan, Viscount and Viscountess Combermere, Colonel Dougs, and npwards of 300 general visitors, specially invited to assist at the ceremony. Lord and Lady Combermere having inspected the lecture-hall andspacious riding school already erected in the ground round the college, the noble viscoentess was con. ducted to the site of the new building, when the stono was lowered into its place and declared well and duly fixed amid erthusiasic cheering. Before the stone was laid Mr. Stocquelor read an address to her Ladyship, -which, ater referring In high terms to the military achievements of the Field-Marshal pointed out the necessity which existed for the institution about to be founded, and said, that ;whatever WAs accomplishaed in the wars in which we have been engaged must be set down to the daring and discipline of our dragoons, and the heroic examples of their leaders. They offered their blood in atonement of professional ignorance, and England accepted the sacrifice without taking a single step thereafter to avert so cruel a waste of enery, IntrziditM and patriotism." After thp caremon of the daY ha ten place, the visitors partook of sumptuous d6je9ner. The usual loyal toasts were given and enthusiastically received, and in responding to the health of Lord and Lady Combermere the Field-Marshal said that he. most cordially approved the principle of the Cavalry College, and knew that it was thought of hopefnuy at head quartemi He trusted that its beneficial effects In the service would be soon evinced and lasting in their operation, and he considered it as of vital importance that professonal occupation should fill up the time that elapsed between young men leaving school and entering the service. He trusted that infantry officers who looked to being majors and adjutants would attend the college, if only to learn to ride. After the daiefner quadrile parties were formed in the lecturehall and under a marquee on the lawn, and dancing was prolonged with much spirt till an advanced hoar of the evening. The whole proceedings throughout were of the most festive and animated character. From the drawings of the new college it is evidenty intended' to be a handsome and spa cious building, in the Roaneeque style, and Mr. Broadbridge, its architect, expects to have the centre portion (which wrill accommodate 50 pupils) finishod by o3eptezuber. TBEu DALI SR-CLABNDoN TBE ry.-Our Government has very important duties to discharge. They will prove comparatively easy if all oonnivance and complicity with the spirit and projects of Filibasterism be at once rejected. We have the trait route through the rivers aud lakes of Nicaragua to open and to keep open. We have the rising commercial importance of Groytown, as a free and neutral port, to encourage and protect. We have many other things to accomplish by an honest, open, humane, and just policy. But these things are to be done, not by fuming and babbling about the national honour and the American flag. but by a podtive exertion of the national power. Whatever we do wrill be in subhtautial fulfilment of the stipulations of the Dallas-Clarendon treaty, as planned by Mlr. Marcy, so unwisely and unfortnnately rejected by the Senate, with the conounrrence of the present Administration. If we are to protectAmerican commerce in Greytown we must protect some regular municipal Government there. If we mean to give security to the transit route we must eject the Filibusters or must keep them in order by the machinery of our imerican laws, and, if necessary, by the rms of the republic. if it sball prove desirable to open the Mosquito country to Amencan settlement, it muat be by adjusting land titles, as the rejected treaty proposed to do. Ln the meantime, if our Government can do these things for the advancement of our national policy in that region p-oririo motu, and quite independently of the rsct of mankind so can Groat Britain accomplish objects of corresponding importance to her own subjects. She is even no acting most wisely and nobly, while we are talking and fretting. Her ships are protecting her subjects-nay, while our own citiz2na, seduced into criminal enterprzew by the infamous acts of Filibasterism, lay staring anddyingatGreytown, British sailors came forward, fed them, nursed them, and brought them back to their bomes. Their own Goverument, rolling in wealth, gorged with unappropriated tresure, while its docks were encumbered with unemployed shipping, looked coldly on, while its wretched people, langDishing on a foreign shore, stretched theirshrivelted hands to their old "enemy" for comfort and salvation i There is wrong somewhere. This sybtem of non-intervention and avoidance of entangling alliances does not justify itself by its works. It may, as it manifestly does, encourage the marauder and freebooter to deedsof crime and blood, but itdoes notvindicatethe national name, nor comfort them that suffer. Nor will Great Britain confineher action tothe relief of Americancitizens. She will asEert audmaintain herown policy. Four yearsagoMr. Mason Eolemnly announced that if a colony had been formed of ibe Bay Islands, it must be given up. Well, it hss not ) een given up. It will not be given up. Hundreds wiU acquiesce in ita retention, What tben? Will the United States fight about it? Assuredly not. It is feared that a naval station and arsenal may be formed at Ruatan. This is quite likely. And what objectiou is there to that? We may not perhaps do our dutyoand promptly seo,en the Nicaragua route which our citizens had made peculiarly an American one; but Great Britain will not ne-glect hers. Sheo will open one across Honduras, and she will protect it against all comners, wvhether Filibusters or others, wrhile tendering it for the use of all. It would be botter to have an understanding, but it is consolatory to reflect that wwhether we have one or not there will be no quarrel The intrests aud policy of th United Statwe and Great Britain are one and the same, Demagogues will not be allowed to tri'le with them. The country repnses just confidence in the conservatism and patriotismof Mr. Buchanan and General Cass. Both nations have made an honest effort toadjust a vexatious dispute, which having failed, the next best thing is to drop the controversy, as sensible men cease a discussion when likely to degenerate into a wrangle-Jcw Yo*k Courier anC Ernquirer.

LONDON, TUBSDAY, MAY 26, 1857. IT the House of Lords last night, Lord LYNDSUUuT, before the order of the day was read for going into committee on the Divorce Bill, caled the attention of the House to the state of the I law as regarded actions for criminal conversation. e 9hoped th3t as the Bill passed through committee a sufficient substitute would be provided for that disI graceful formt of action. The House then went into committee on the Divorce Bill, when The Duke of NoRFOLr, moved that it be referred to a select coiuluittee for the pmrposes of taking evidence and resolving as to whether the permissiou for divorced persons to marry again had any wvarrant in Scripture. The Bishop of ST. DAVmDs thought the motion of theDuke of NoroLK did him infinted t,but it could lead to DO satifactoryresl, he (theBi4op of Sr. DAvr'.s) must oppose lit. At the ame n.e he regarded the Bill with grave apprehenao, for he feared it would open. the door to coUusion, sad fail to satisfy the abstract principle on whi,:it was founded. The Earl of HkRRowBr admired the mantlinus of character which had prompted the Duke 'o IXonvFoa to propose this amendiuent, but felt it his duty to oppose it. Lora RDDzSDAE expresed hisintentiortof voting with the noble Duke. After speeches from the Duke of ADOTLL, Lord IDUNGANox, and Lord DszrjAN, The House divided, when the numbers were,- For the amendment ... 26 Against it... ... ... 123 Majority... ... ... 97 - The House then went into committee, when clauses I to 5 inclusive were agreed to without opposition. Clause 6, which specifies the tribunals to which divorce cases should be referred, was opposed by Lord GRBY on the ground that the time of t4e Judges who were to constitute the highest oourt was already fuly occupied, and that the expense would place a separation out of the reach of the poor. The ILorD CH"c=Lo l defended the claue, which was ultimately agreedto. On clause 16 Lord Sr. LnotNn's propoed ian amendment to protect women who having been deserted by their husbands became possessed 'of property. In such cases it often happened thatthe husbaud stepped in and claimed the property. The LoED Ca"caxon, thought the Bill gave Women in this position sufficient protection. After considerable discusion, in which Lord CAP3BELL, Lord GER, Lord DEaiBY the Bishop of OXYORD, and Lord Gnsvxr. took part, the Committee divided, when the numbers were:- J Contents ... ... ... ... 2 Non-contents ... ... .. 44 Majority ... ... ... 8 Upon clause 16 Lord WEsrUmB moved a clause to precede it, giving powers of re-marriage in cases where the husband and wife had been separated for 20 years and upwards. He then entered into a matter personal to himself, but was celled to order by Lord REDESDALx and Lord DznBY, who advisedhim to defer this vindication of his cha, racterto a more fitting opportunity. Reeaccordingly withdrew his motion. On clause 19, Lord DONoUoGE1sOB proposed au amendment, placing married women in the same position as their husbands with regard to divorce a vinculo matri- The LORD CANcmon opposed the amendmeiit, which, though rim4facie reasonable, was practically inexpedient. Lord LYNDHURST declared his intention of supporting the amendment. Lord CA1MrBE thought the law ought not to be relaxed in this respect. The Committee then divided. For the amendment ... ... 20 Against ... ... ... .. n Majority ... .. -51 Lord LYNDxHrST moved an amendment to the clause, to the effect that wilful and malicious desertion for five years should be a sufficient groind for dissolving a marriage. All the great authoritiea of the Ohurch went one way in this matter, and by the existing law of Scotland desertion for four years was sufficient to annula mariage. The LoRD CHAcELLosR opposed the amendment as one which would lead to the greatest difficulties. After some further discussion, their Lordshipa divided, when the numbers were,- Contents ... ... ... ... 8 Non-contents ... ... ... 97 MIajority against the amendment -89 The remaining clauses down to clause 43 were then agreed to, after some discussion. On clause 43, giving parties liberty to re-marry, The Bishop of OXFORD opposed it on the ground that the Scriptural argument against such re-mariages was plain. He felt that the glory of the people of England, the hapriness of their homes, and the chastity of the people would be much endangered by this measure, and- especially by this particular clause, wfhich he moved be expunged front the Bill, After considerable discussion, in wrhich Lords C.&srrnr.r, DEBBYr, the LoaFD CwicxioB and Lord GiuiY took part, the Committee d~ivided on the qu"tion " that the words proposed to be struck out stand part of the clause." Contents ........4 con-erabledscuion,ent... 63 Majority .. ..-6 The amendment was therefoRe carried. Lord Cpar then moved that the House resume. This was carried, nd their Lpordohipt then adjourned. In the House of Commons, on the bringing up of the report of the Committee on the .Auity to the ?snicr.ss RoYA. Mr. Conosr objected to the vote on principle and as aprecedent for othervotes hereafter, and to the amaount of the vote, which he moved to re duce from 8,0001. a-year to 6,0001. Lord PCAsTot expressed his regret that MÃ¯Â¿Â½r. Coresusme Tshould have again raised this question, and trusted that the House would abide by the vote of the committee. After a fecdn remarks by Colonel FhEXCE{ and Mr C. GtLoIN the ffouse divded, when the resolution was affirmed by 328 to 14-a majority of 314. The resolution havig been agraed to, a Bill nas ordered to be brought in founded thereupon. On the report of the Committee of Supply, Mr. G AGrItE objected to the vote of 40,0007. for the marriage portion of the Pagress Rto,aB considering that the annuity of 8,0001. was sufficient. Mr. Coxr?wonr and Sir J. TmaAwNy likewise opposed the vote. Upoa a division this vote was likewise affirmed by361 to18. The other resolutions (Navy Estimates) were agreed to. On the order for going intos Committee of Supply upon the Army Estimates, Mr. W. WMLrw.is moved to refer the estimates to a select committee. He characterized these estimates as extravagant, observing that from the manner in which they bad been prepared he was unable to compare them with those of former years. If the Government were convinced that they were in accordance with the requirements of the army they could not, he said, object to refer them to a committee, which, he was sure, would malke endrmnous reduetions in them. Tbis motion was notseconded. Upon the original question, Sir R. WiLOUGIBY inquired who was responsible for the outlay of this expenditure. He thought there was a want of responsibility in this matter. and tnat the law was much neglected. He also azked why the number of heads of expenditure hiad been reduced. lr. SPooxmt put various quedions with reference to the Government manufactory and supply of arms. Sir J. lRAlsDEN, in reply to Sir E. WMoIrOGRB, stated that the Secretary of State for War wM responsible for the expenditure of these votes, a n that the alteration of the forms was made with a view of affording fuler information to the Houie. He also answered the inquiries of Mr. SPOo3m. After some further discussion the House went into a Committee of Supply upon the Army Esti. mates, when Lord PAL-sERSToN made the usual general preliminary explanation of the votes. He reminded the Committee that these estimates contained everything connected with the War Department, so that the House would see at one view the whole of our military expenditare. The first question for the Government, he observed, must naturaDy be what, under the circunmstances of the moment, were the establishments requiredl on the one hand by a duo regard to economy, and on the other by the eficiency of the service and the defence of the country. We had not only our own island. to defend, but possessions scattered over the globe, and we had to consider what was necessary for both, not only in case of actual war, but agaiust sudden attack. Our position reuired peculiar precautions, and modern uiaprovenenta had grettly altered the conditions of both naval and military warfare, so that this country could lot rely, as formerly, UPon its avalme~x~s.On he oherbad it W;A tl
It is little more than a truism to say that our laws of Marriage and Divorce ought to be based upon the facts of the case, and, to a great extent, adjusted to them. The extent, indeed, of that -adjustmrent is the matter in question, for we are not to make such ample and easy provision for weakness and wickedness as actually to encourage and increase what we only mean to relieve and keep in some tolerable order. With this reserve there is, nevertheless, a large amount of deep, substantial, and imnocent suffering and wrong which demands the interference of a reasonable Legislature. It cannot even be said that the interference so demanded is new. If the Legislature should now commit what some -professional zealots tell us iE a national crime and -a sacrilege enough to bring down the wrath of HEAVFN upon a, guilty realm, i\happens not to be the first offence, or the second,\or the third, or even the hundredth. On the con'ary, the Legislature has for centuries been in thrregular, steady habit, of doing the very thing severid\times a-year. What is now proposed is simply thI t Parliament shall do it, not as heretofore, by a solen.a~ legislative act, but through a tribunal much more competent for the purpose, and a much more confiftutional -organ. This is only an example of that advance from acts to judgments as necessary to the development of a constitution as tbe earlier transition from the arbitrary decrees of a despot to those of a Council or a Court. But the fact to be legislated for is now evidenced in some hundred private acts, proving both the ect and the duty of providing for it. Unfortunately, too, the fact-that is the suffering through breaches of the marriage contract-is not confined to the few who can pay several thousand pounds for relief. It would be a slander on our nobility and gentry -to say that they are the only class that commits adultery; and not less mere flattery to ascribe to them alone a wish to dissociate themselves from depravity and disgrace. The case is, unfortunately, cowIIl0on to all classes ; the wish is fortunately as common. For the two or three sufferers -who annually purchase relief from the Legislature there are hundreds in as evil a case with equal claims to a remedy, and a not less wish to obtain it. This consideration of the actual facts of the case ought to be carried out, as it appears to us, in the whole of the law upon the subject,-of course, in subjection to any undoubted principle of morality or revelation. What, then, is the matter of fact to be considered with the krchbishop of CANTrmnmluRY's amendment on section 43 of the Bill? Tbere are, unfortunately, and ever will be, many persons who have offended against the law of marriage, and who have doubtless committed thereby a very heinous sin. In the present state of our law these persons have so sinned with the fullest knowledge that they could never be legally and permanently inited to the objects of their criminal attachmenit. The crime may have been one of mere weakness, favoured by extraordinary temptation and opportunity, or possibly, in a few cases, the coldblooded crime of the deliberate and Eel5sh sensualist, seeking a short gratification, and indifferent to the responsibilities it might entail. The present state of the law-that is, the absence of all hope to snch offenders, has not been able to prevent a vast amount of that infirmity for which our compassion may reasonably be claimed. It certainly has been a great encouragement to that class of mere sensualists against whom our indignation must ever be roused. But the classes exist, and -will continue to exist. There are many unfortunates who, with mitigating circumstances, illmnatched, ill-used, deserted, heartbroken, and bankrupt in legitimate affection, have offended against -a law which to them was no longer a gracious gift, a remnanit of Paradise, and a fountain of sweet 'waters, but a stern behest,-a hard literallaw. There are also many others who cannot be so excused, who have fallen very culpably through wantonness and caprice, but who yet may have within them the susviving elements of a comparatively virtuous restoration. True, -we may point to HEAVEN, and bid the fallen to rise thither in heart as in hope. But some'where between the saint and the sinner, betwreen -the MAoGi)aLy and the wretched class that haunts our streets or grovels in some private shame, -there are steps of reformation that laws may assist, and HmkvxE- may not wholy forbid. We recur to the fact; and there is a fact of human feeling as well as a fact of sin and of cir-cumstances. We venture to ask, then, what do the tender and the generous think of those who, having offended against the marriage law, and -being consequently under the ban of society, per-eevere in a partnership of affection, with the return of affection for their only reward ? The rigid moralist may pronounce that they ought to separate, but, considering the levity of feeling that this would usually imply, and considering the almost inevitable results, the greater part of mankind regard such a cmnstancy not only with compassion, but with a degree of respect. That compassion, then, and that qualified respect we are ourselves ready to see carried out in the law of the land. It has already been so carried out in some himdred Acts of Parliament; and, notwithstanding the success of the amendmer-,; moved by the Bishop of OXFORD last night, we have no doubt it will eventually be carried out in the present general measure. But, while we maintain that the law ought to be adapted to the facts of the case, we trust that we have already protested against a law which shall encourage speculation on its indulgence. We shaU not enter into a minute examination of the various amendments proposed by Lord MAs.rtrsBURY and Lord ST. LEONARD'S; but if it could be shown that any of the former would prevent a mere traffic in divorce, and so save the indulgence of a second marriage from being seriously abused, then we should be the first to declare our acquiescence. It must be considered, however, that we have to deal with infirmity and misfortume. This is the very class under legislation. We have also to deal with a sense of honour not quite so acute as in the higher classes, in spite of a steady obedience to the moral law. In the lower classes it is not so uncommon to forgive and take back the adulteress, and there are high-principled advisers who, for the sake of the children, or for other reasons, will even urge this course. Suppose the condonation to operate only as a license to crime-as it may, or may not-is the forgiving husband to be deprived of all hope of restoring his household I Is he to be condenmned for his excessive tenderness to the alternatives of singleness or sin -the one possibly above, the other, it may be hoped,below his nature? Wherethepetitioners before the proposed Court have shown an utterdisregardnot only of right feeling, but of all moral considerations, and evidently place themselves either above or below the law, and where they ask the Court only to assist them in new folly or crime, for such cases we readily concur in all the restrictions which may defeat their objects. It is hopeless to adapt any marriage law to the speculations of those who regard the law as only to be broken, or who have even given reasonable proof that they are not to be held by it. We only ask for a law adapted to such facts of the case as demand just relief, or fairly admit of a charitable construction. We believe that a lawr may be framed which shall not only offer no inducements or fresh facilities to crime, but shall even tend to diminish the amount of that sin which is justly described as the great scandal of this city, this nation, and this age.
The Maine Liquor Law has been a signal failure in the province from which it derives its name. In Maine, if we are rightly informed, t] enactment is set at defiance in a hundred ways, and even persons who are not disposed to be habitual drunkards cannot bring themselves to submit to a system of temperance by statute. The prohibition, indeed, appears in great measure to work its ownl defeat. Men wil not cultivate the moral virtues through fear of fine and imprisonment-certainly not the virtue of temperance. Now, we are not about to sing the praises of drunkenness, or to recommend the Bottle as the grand panacea for aU human ills. We could say as many fine things about the evils which result from habitual intemperance as any professed lecturer from Maine, were it worth while to weary our readers with stale truisms. Could we persuade the people of this country, not to abstain altogether from fermented liquors,butto confine themselves within thosereasonable linits which nature and experience point out as suitable in such a matter, we are well aware that the crime of the country would be diminished in an infinite degree. A vast amount, moreover, of misery and degradation, which is never brought at all under the cognizance of the criminal courts, is also to be attributed to the pernicious influence of " drink." We are all agreed about the facts so far as habitual insobriety is concerned, but at this point we part company with the apostles of the Maine Liquor Law. In the moist climate in which our lot is cast, and artificial as our habits of life Lndoubtedly are, we fully believe that an artificial stimulus, if usecl in moderation, Po far from being productive of evil, is of positive advantage to the eonstitution. Almost every individual in these islands, save perhaps the agricultural labourer, leads a highly artificial existence. It is the same thing with the artisan, the mechanic, and the manufacturing operative, as with the overworked barrister, or merchant, or author. In the one case nearly the whole of a man's waking hours are spent in a heated and unwholesome atmosphere. over labour of an unceasing and monotonous kind. In the other there is a perpetual strain upon the brain, a perpetual wear and tear of the nervous system. When the time for relaxation arrives the man whose lot it is to live like a hermit and work like a horse is not capable of the exertion which vould refresh the energies of the savage. He sits down to his meal with a great craving for food, rather *than with a wholesome hunger, and the food set before him is rich and heavy. Water is not the apt solvent for such a meal, nor will a few glasses of cold water supply that stimulus which the languid stomach absolutely requires to enable it to perform its task. The Maine Liquor Law enthusiasts may talk as they will about the delights of the pure fountain; we are of those who believe that a glass or two of good sherry, or other wholesome wine, so far from being injurious in the case described, will rather act as a cordial, and restore the jaded energies of exhausted nature. Now, when we claim this privilege for ourselves, we have no wish to dissociate our cause from that of our poorer fellow-subjects who may be engaged in the various operations of handicraft. What the glass of sherry is to the overworked brain-labourer, is the glass of beer to the mechanic or artisan. If all Exeter-hall or all the platforms in Maine were to rise up in pious indignation at so startling an expression of opinion, we would stiU say that the poor nman is not the worse, but much the better, for his glass of beer. However translucent may be the aqueous theories of the partisana of total abstinence, the experience of mankind is against them. The human race broadly by their practice maintain the principle that, in one form or another, they will have stimulating drink of some kind. It is a false position, however, to assert that the decision of mankind therefore is for drunkenness. In this, as in all other things, reason should be our guide, and it is so. The enormous majority of the inhabitants of these islands make use of fermented liquors, but a very small minority are habitual drunkards. Of the 7,500,000 persons, whom we assume at a rough caleulation to represent the adult male population of Great Britain and Ireland, how many are habitual drunkards-how many are even "drunk" in the course of any given tweenty-four hours ? Are we therefore to be told that, because a few weak or depraved people deliberately choose to malke beasts of themselves, and to bring ruin upon awll about thema, the reasonable liberty of the great bulk of their feUowsubjects is. te be restraineed by a restrictive sumptuary, Thw to enforce temperance ? We caLt assure tZie lMM. NEAL pVe,. ef Portland, Unite States., who. is to leceSare us at Exeter-hall this dayl SIat; hnS is vling~ t1is labour and. bis. eloquence in England. We know., as well as he can tell us, that drunkenness here, as in all other eivilized countries, is a fruitful source of crime. We cannot, however, compare our own, or any other country, with a nation of wa er-drinkers-or, rather,with a nation which uses no artificial stimulus -and for the simple reason that no such a community exists, or ever has existed in the annals of the world. This world is now of iome standing in the universe, and the inference would seem to be a pretty clear one. As a matter of abstract speculation it might be curious to inquire what vices and crimes would most prevail among a nation oC pure water-drinklers, unless influences far more potent than their habitual beverage were at work among them, But even the State of Maine will not supply us with the means of instituting any such comparison. Let it not be supposed that we underrate for a moment the evils which arise from drunkenness. We merely protest, as far as our drunkards are concerned, against efforts to reform them at the cost of the temperate indulgence of the whole sober population. The MaineLiquor Law men occupy pretty nearly in the temperance question the same position as the Peace Society have done for some time past upon that of war. Our objection in either case is that these enthusiasts positively do harm, inasmuch as they combat a great and aclnowledged evil with inappropriate weapons. Let us by all means do what we can for the reformation of our drunkards; let us apply all wholesome influences of religion, of education, of orderly homes, of social decencies, and of self-respect which may serve to guard those who are to come after us from so fearful an evil. We know perfectly well what the nature of it is, and what its extent, and how it is to be dealt with. The Maine Liquor Law, however, is not a weapon which will serve the turn.
It is with some gratification that we proceed to relieve the public mind on a subject well calculated to suggest uneasiness to the thoughtful and considerate portion of a community. Not many days ago our intelligence from America included aa account of a aupposed case of murder in which circumstantial evidence, of strength apparently sufficient to insure conviction in any court in the world, was abruptly upset by the production of the alleged victim alive and well. The scene of the occurrences was Newburg-a towvr on the Hudson River, not far from New York. Early in the morning the corpse of a woman was diEcovered lying in a field outside the town with distinct marks of violence upon it. It was presently identified as the body of a Miss BLOOmE, who was said to have left home shortly before in company with a person named JENKINS. JENKIs admitted the proceedings ascribed to him in so far as they embraced the journey into the country and its circumstances, but denied the murder. So strong, however, did the evidence appear,-so plain seemed the facts that the deceased was Misn BLOOMn, and that she had been last in his company under conditions which almost necessarily left him responsible for her fate, that he was committed to prison; when suddenly the real Miss BLoOix presented herself to view perfectly unhurt, and terminated the case as concerned the parties to the tran;awtion thus far alleged. A narrative like this was well adapted to shake people's faith in circumstantial evidence, and to unsettle the securities on which our jurisprudence must in some degree depend. Ilere was an entire mistake, first in the identification of a body, and next in the interpretation of circumstances con. ceived to substantiate a charge of murder. As nothing could well be stronger than the evidence produced, of course the grounds of dismay were proportionatelv serious, for what evidence could be trusted when this had broken down, and in how many cases might wrong have been committed in reliance upon a species of proof thus signally shown to be uncertain? Reflections like these arose naturally from the circumstances detailed, but information now before us enables us to assume, with a considerable degree of confidence, that neither our astonishment nor our discomposure had any foundation whatever. As we are at present advised, there never really was any evidence of the character alleged; and what there was is suspected to have been fabricated from first to last with the express purpose of discrediting such testimony in general. To begin with,-the marks or peculiarities said to have been discoverable on the body of the deceased, and to have served for its identification with that of Miss BLOOzE, were so numerous and diversified as to have suggested some reasonable suspicions on this very head. The corpse was said to have not only a scar over the left eyebrow and another on the middle joint of the middle finger of the left hand, but was stamped all over with characteristics of its own. The left leg had a mole half-way between the knee and ankle; the left foot had its two middle toes grown together as far as the fit joint, and the toenails were curved and compressed into an unusual shape. On one particular finger, too, there was a strange circular mark, in the form of a ring; and, as if all this was not enough, one of the arms had a sore, and one of the teeth had been stopped with gold in a peculiar manner. Such a catalogue of particulars looked in itself almost like a pre-arrangement of a case somewhat overdone; for, certainly, it passes all the bounds of probability that more than one human body should have presented all these singularities at once. It was as if matters were not only made safe, but rather too much so. A critical reference to the proceedings Shows other circumstances which might have been abundantly suggestive of doubt and misgiving. The affair was conducted hastily and without due circumspection, probably because the prompt identification of the corpse and the arrest of the supposed murderer seemed to have Satisfied all the requirements of the case. But it appears that there was never any evidence brought to prove that the wounds visible on the body had been the cause of death, or that they had been inflicted during life; it is even intimated that no sufficient medical opinion was taken, although surgical evidence was certainly produced on a particular point. What is more, it is now said that the appearance and position of the corpse were totally inconsistent with those circumstances of violence which had been assumed, and that even if any murder at all had been committed, it was certainly not the murder alleged. The body, we are assured, presented evidence of having been undressed, washed, and laid out in the ordinary manner before being dressed and laid as it was found. When found it exhibited no traces of any struggle, or of any such consequences as would have ensued upon the crime alleged. It was stretched at full length, decently composed, with the eyes closed and the hands folded across the breast. As it was found just inside a fence, the idea occurred that it had been rudely thrown over from the road where the murder had been committed; but this the position of the body entirely negabived, and the m'ore cor-. reet inference, it is saW, woud have been that it had been carefully placei in a spot where it would lmeost apeedily and ce,ninlyattract attention. All these details,. whicl with othexs. have now fobnd their way s0os,4 the Atlantis, would suggest at once in thia :4mutr i&.t Boga iteo_ Q3 or other had been guilty of what was little more or less than a hoax, highly foolish and reprehensible, but nothing beyond. From the comments, however, of the American press, we learn that suspicion points to something more-viz., to a concerted scheme for disparaging the force of circumstantial evidence at a period when testimony of this kind was about to be employed in some other inquiry. It is thought that there was no nmurder at all, that the body was placed in the field in order to be discovered, that preparations had been made to lead to an identification, and that when a conclusion had been thus naturally arrived at its sudden overthrow was reckoned upon as likely to operate in the direction designed. " These rumours," says a. Transatlantic journal, alluding to reports current to such effect, " if we were to credit them, would ' make the tragedy no tragedy at all, or rather 'would compel us to infer that the case is one of ' fabricated evidence,' such as 7tot unfrequently "tumns up in our criminal records at junctures "when the decision of an important cause may be "biassed by the creation of parallel circumstantial "proof in a case that can be shown to be fictitious "at the proper moment." The continuation of the article from which we quote shows pretty clearly that this inference finds favour. With this point, however, we are not concerned. The mere suggestion of such an idea, with the overt intimation that, whether true or not in this particular instance, it is certainly put in practice on occasions, will apprise the reader how immeasurably the Americans in subtlety of legal stratagem surpass ourselves. As Miss BLoowz is alive, it is clear that she, at least, was not assassinated, and that Mfr. Jmaius, at any rate, is not a murderer. Whether any deed of violence, with other actors and sufferers, was really committed-whether the affair was a hoaxwhether it was a plot, or whether it was simply an example of precipitate credulity and of popular impulse, strangely but not designedly conducted into a wrong channel, we shall not attempt to disuss. The moral of our remarks turns upon one point alone, and upon one fortunately involved in no obscurity-namely, that there never was really such a body of circumstantial evidence producible as need have created any fatal error. There was no testimony of such a character as to endanger the life of an itnocent man, nor should our faith in this species of evidence be in any degree unsettled by such an iUustration. On the contrary, the minute and numerous details which have since been stated and applied to the elucidation of the case show how valuable is the testimony which circumstances will yield when carefuly and comprehensively accumulated. The entire error manifestly depended upon the premature acceptance of a single piece of evidence conceived to be all-sufficient in itself. Conclusions were jumped to a great deal too quickly. If it had not been at once taken for granted that the body had been finaRy identified, a very little fuirther inquiry would have dispelled the delusion, for it seems that there was actually a considerable difference in height between the living person and her assumed corpse. Lastly, it must be remembered that even the mistake which did occur only produced the committal of an innocent man for trial, and not his condemnation. It would still have remained to be seen whether the evidence could carry conviction even had the supposed deceased not reappeared. The accused himself, we are told, pointed out a variety of discrepancies, which, though ineffective against popular impulse, might have been otherwise when urged by competent counsel in a regular court of justice. The examaple, in short, is one of contagious impression rather thau of delusive evidence, nor need it in any way impair such reasonable reliance as we have been accustomed to place on a process occasionally most valuable fcr the detection of crime.
We suspect that very few of our readers were aware that until a day or two back the Lords never published any lists of their Divisions. We do not, therefore, say that such lists were not published as occasion might arise in the columns of this journal, but they were always obtained from the Tellers, and could not be considered as emanating from the authority of the Rouse. The Lords declined aU responsibility to the public. They refused, in fact, to acknowledge the existence of such a body. The refusal, of course, was a mere farce, but, while it was maintained, it might be taken as a standing protest of the Peers against all vulgar comments upon their proceedings. It was but some twenty years ago that the Commons made a similar concession to public opinion,-the Commons, -who were sent to Parliantent expressly as the representatives of the people, and who -were therefore bound in every way to give an open account of their stewardship. In this case, too, Division Lists, procured from the rival Tellers, were also published, which were necessarily imperfect, and at times incorrect. The inconveniences arising from this irregular method of proceeding were at length found to be so great that the Commons determined to publish the lists of their Divisions, and now the Lords have followed their example. Such is the end of the great battle of mystery which has been waged with everabating spirit and vigour since the days of the Restoration. Reports, Minutes, Divisions, in the two Houses of Parliament, are all now to be laid, as of right, from day to day before the people of England.

TIIZ BURDLL MusRDXm TRxA.-The Burdell tria, which for the last fewweeks hasexcited somuch speculation, is at an end, and we shall now probably only hear of it as one of those mysterious events which for generatioss furnish subject for wonder and awe to fireside listeners. We question whether tke causes cbrdes of any country make mention of any cae more singular or memorable. When we consider the unparalleled boldes and fearlesmness of the deed, the little apparent effort retorted to to escape detection, and the mystery in which it continues involved, notwithstanding three protracted investiptions, it wil be regarded either as one of the most sucoessful cnmes or as one of the most lamentable failures of justice on record. With the verdict of the jury we have-o fault to find. It was strictly in accordance with the evidence presented to them. Regarding that evidence in al its legal berings, we are bound to arrive with the juIJ at the concusion that Mrs. Cunningham is innocent-innocent, at least, of any direct participation in this murder; and that conclusion, of course, also legally absolves her partner in the accusation, Mr. EckeL Mrs. Cunningham is therefore, by the law, formally restored to the position from which the law temporarily degraded her. She will resume her place among her peers of Bondstreet and the fashionables of SaratogaSprings. and it is probable that the celebrity attached to her by this trial, so arfronm injuring, will enhance the social success of herself and daughters. New York society is so singularly constituted that we must be prepared for al sueh startling inconsistencies. Passing from the immediate results of this acquittal to the parties concerned-to the more important interests involved in it, wre are compllecd to say that the management of the case futnishes arnelancholy commentary an the manner in which justice is administered in New York. With the exception of the conduct of the presiding judge, which is deserving of all praise for its even temper, impartiality, and decision,wedo not recollect any important cziminal case which has presented such a display of imbecility and inefficiency on the part of the legal persons em. ployed. The prosecution seemed afraid of proving too much; while the defence, on the other hand, was weakened by its efforts at exaggetion. After the stroug statements made by the district attamey in his openig epeech, more was expected from the evidenco for the prosecution than was discloeed in the testimony. taken before the coroner. Instead of the promisew developments, we find to our amazemuent that not only is there nothing new to add to the evidence against the ac, cused, but that much that was previously considerod im. portantis withheld. The testimony of Farrell, the evidence regardinng, the purchase of the dagger, and the testimony of Dr. B aisdel are all shut out from the record. Omis, eions like these of course furnished an arm of strength to the defence, and eontributed in no smnall degree to a trimoph which the litle skil} arrayed on that side might habe failed in obtaining. It is impossible to read the sy*ni ing statement of Mr. Hall, and to compare it with th* eLvi. dence presented in support of it, without arriving atC the conclusion that the case for the prosecution was eitibr got up at a hand-gallop, or prepared with a carelessness which only finds its paralle iatheusual mode of transacting businesa in tX district attorneys office. We belive- it to be a fact that at the preset moment tewe. am from 1,59 to 2,00* indictments, the accamu)ktion o0 the lat three years, lying perdu in tbh office, the patie criminisated enjoying all the timn. fuU iis. munit from tb.penalties attached to their offeaoes. Isit sumrising that in suclk a state of things our city shcald w3tk3r the last few years have been made tle theatra of haV-a-dozen atrocious murders, and that the authors of *nem skean have been alloed to escape punishnzant ? Ought we to wonder that our strts are infested by armed bellies aad.rowdies, who pistol nnoffending parties, or, that respeet. able citieias should occasionally be made away with lrt the midnigbht assa%sin, leaving no tracesof their 1ate? We may feel wounded by and resent the commentaziesof Asha Eure. pean press at the inefficiency of our judici'syeke5 but we cannot alter the character of these facts.

Sr. JAf5S?S 2THZATBR. In oDosequence of tle indisposition of X Pndeaa the performanees of the `Bouffes Parideenme havuendergoner A sudden change, which is the more to be regretted, as Let Pantint de VidoW1, prodoced on Fridsy, was one of ther most agreeape pieces of the repertory. A variety in the appearanoe of the little dramas constitutes a great ham of t entertanment, and here was a pretty fair tale, which a female Cimon fellin love with male Ipgenia amid a number of fantastic circumstanoes that ecetrate forcibly with the routine of Parisian and rustic life from which the subjects of sbort vaudevilles are usually taken. Last nght the performanoes commenoed with l;a Swit Blanche, one of the inauguration pieces played at the Champs Elys6es, when the "Boeffol" first opened their bandbox of a theatre. The story is simple in the extreme A mnuggler's wife, uneasy at the absence of her husband, receives avsilt from her cousin Hercule, an offioer of the Customs, and, on the sudden arrival of her worse half, bides the visitor in the oellar. In this position the official eye of Hercule detects sundry contraband goods, but, as his own situation is far frem cure, be andthe husbeadI shake hands, and while he is allowed to depart soot free it is understood that his memory wrill ot be too tenaciou. The outline of this piece is very similar to that of Af7neur Landrv, which was repeated last niRht, but the pretty music, which is very well sung by MZiL Guyot and Mesmacre and MademoiseUe Mace, gives it a charace of its own. La Bonne *Unfant, the little opera with which the entertainments concluded, is, if possible, more lht than La Nuit Blanche, though the incidents are a more extravagant kind. Dorothe,'a nurnermaid, left in charge of an infant, no sooner finds herself lone tha ashezeceivea the adorations of GTrgaillou, a chimneysweeper, and 3Mitoflard, a sapper. The civilian hides himself (there wasa deal of hiding yesterday evening) from the military gentlercan, and then reappears in female attire, affecting tobe the aunt of the fair Dorothee. Mitouflird rather admires the supposed aunt, and they quit the house together; but Gargaillou soon returns by the chimney, and finding Mtounfard returning through the open window conceals himself In the child's cradle. When, at last, the soldier discovers the sweep, a tragic incident nearly take. place, for the former snatching up the real child as a weapon is about to use it for the purpose of dashing out the brains of the latter. Two distinct causes prevent this sad result. In the first place the rivals learn that Dorothee likes a third party better than either of them, and therefore cease their hostilities. In the second plaoe; the master of the house returs home and puts both alike to the rout. This pieoe is provided with some extremely effeativ music, which is an important element towards its success-the most striking song being a vocal description of a garria .n ("la garnison de Charenton'), capltally sun by q M.

A duet by the same gentleman and Ma emoiselle is rendered extremely eoniic by each of the two character rising 'p when his or heor voice is required, and sitting down as soon as the tak is achieved, so that one is always standing while the other a seated.

FOREIGN INTBLLIGENCB. FANCE. (ETOM OUJR OWN COURES NDRNT. I [The following appeared in our second edition of yes. tLrda *_1 PARIS, SUNDAY, MAY 24, 6 P.m. The incidents which took place in the Spanish Senate on the 16th, 18th, and 19th give a good idea of how men attain honours and rise to power in that country. Of the many hundred Generals -whose names fill the Spanish Army List few there are who do not owe their rank to successful rebellion of tome kind or other. Admitting the ability which General Narvaez has on more than one occasion given proof of, yet in that long muster-roll of * immortal chiefs " there is not one who would be less justified in lecturing men on the crime of miitary insubordination or in reproaching them for their excessive ambition than he, and no man has occupied a more prominent position or gained more by civil strife than himself. General Narvaez quitted Spain in 1837, on the failure of an insurrectionary attempt at Seville, in which he and General Luiis Cordova, brother of the present General, were actively engaged. The risng, or proiiunciamiento, was to be directed against Espartero, whose progressive success against the Carlists bad already invested him with great influence in the army. When Narvaez quitted Spain he held the rank of M1ajor-General, to which he had some time before been promoted. For aix years he remained out of Spain, and during that time Espartero obtained some of his most important advantages over tbe enemy, and brought the war to a conclusion in 1840. In September of that year occurred the general rising against the Government of Maria Christina, which ended in her resigning her functions as Regent, her departure from Spain, and the nomination by the Cortes of Espartero to the same high post. Three years after-namely, in Dlay, 1843, the insurrection against Espartero broke out, which ended in his dowufall and the triumph of the party of Maria Christina. In that rising -General Narvaez and the other military chiefs whom successive failures in rebellion had forced into exile (O'Donnell and the Conchas among others), together -with the discontented generals at home, returned to Spain, and seized on the reins of power. General Narvaez, in June, 1843, entered Spain with the same military rank which he held -hen he left it-namely, that of Major-General. He beaded the insurgents at Torrejon de Ardoz, where the struggle was decided without a fight, the hostile armies fraternizing on the field. In less than eight months from that date MajorGeneral Narvaez became Lieutenant-General, General, and Field-Marshal, the last rank bearing dato the 5th of January 1844. Within less than severn months he was made Knight Grand Cross of Charles III.; about the same time Grand Cross of St. Herianigildo; and, moreover, was created a Grandee of the first clas, with the title of Duke of Valencia, while his father was ennobled as Count of Canada Alta. He was, besides, named Captain-General of Castile, and, soon after, Minister of War and President of the Council. Thus, before a year had expired he had wealth, and honours, and titlea heaped upon him, and became Dictator of Spain. To put the finishing stroke to this unprecedented fortune, he was made Generalissimo of the Spanish forces, and took his rank with Princes as Knight of the Golden Fleece. All that the Crown had to bestow was lavished upon him ; he mounted to the very pinnacle of power, and above him was nothing nominally but Royalty itself. During that period Spain was engaged in no war in which the abilitics of a chief might have room for display; there were a few droppinv insurrections here and there, which, w ith more orless of blundering, more or less cost of time, were with comparative ease repressed, andmost of the honours just noticed were conferred before General Narvaez had given proofs of the abilities for government which his friends are willing to attribute to him. They were consequently the rewards for participation in insurrection, which from the apathy of the opposite party proved succeEsful. 1 submit, then, that men on whom conspiracy and successful rebellion bestow such preniuns are not, as indeed General Narvaez seems to admit, the best qualified for fiercely denouncing others who only imitate them. The honours and titles bestowed on Espartero were, however, won on the field of battle. He had won them, all, except that of Regent, before 1840, the year in which the civil war, which had lasted seven years, was by him brought to a close. General O'Donnell umdoubtedly owes his rank as Field-Mar. dhal to the Bevolution of 1854, but his previous honours were also gained on the field of battle. He began as aCaptain in 1834: he was Brigadier in 1837. In the summer of that year he suppremsed, with mueh courage and presence of mind, a dangerous insurrection of the Queen's troops inGuipuzcoa, and he saved the town of Hernani, and perhaps San Sebastian, Irun, and Fontarabia, from pillage. For his conduct on that occasion he was made Commandant of the Basque Provinces. From that period to the close of the war he distinguished himself both as Chief of the Staff of Espartero and as Commander of the Central Division of the Army; and before hostilities ended he had risen to the rank of Lieutenant-General. Such, then, are the relative positions in which these two rivals stood towards each other when the discussion took place the other day in the Senate. That debate was awaited with much impatience and anxiety by the public, for it was known that O'Donnell had rejected all the advances of Narvaez, who for personal reasons wished to prevent the threatened explosion. The fire was opened on the 16th by General Calonge, a military insurgent of 1843 He now demanded the exemplary punishment of those who took part in the insurrection of 1854-of those " exalted corruptors and seducers" of the Queen's troops-meaning, though without naming them, O'Donnell, Concha, Dulce, &c. Narvaez, who had taken part in their counsels, who recoiled when the moment for action came, but who congratulated them when they gained the victory, replied to Calouge, and declared in his place as Prime Minister of the Queen, and as head of her army, that the military insurrection of 1854 was justified by the abuses of the preceding Governments, and that the insurgent Generals were men w ho deserved well of their country; and, not content with thus defending the violation of military discipline (for in the first day's debate he did not go so far as to own his own participation in the conspiracy), he reminded Calonge of the share both of them had in the insurrection of 1843, which he defended on the ground that he was " serving his country." This justification of military insubordination is strange II the mouth of a Prime Minister, who is moreover charged with the organization of the armF, who has ever had the words " military discipline ' on his lips, and who has introduced a phrase to that effect into the Speech from the Throne. The debate of the 18th was still more interesting than the one I have alluded to. It was then that O'Donnell defended his conduct during the two yeara he held office. His anxious desire was evidently to show that he had always remained faithful to the Moderado party, and that in heading the rebellion of 1854 he had as his accomplices many Moderado Generals, who now affect to denounce that act; and it appears to me that he succeeded so far. He omitted, however, while dwelling on his good faithto the Moderados,to explain his disloyaltyto the ProgresiA as, with whom he was associated in power for twO years, and whom he conspired against and overthrew at last. He, at aU events, clearly ahowecl tnat General Narvaez was aware of the conspiraÃ¯Â¿Â½y of 1854, that he had to a certain extent taken part in it, that he was well aware of the plans of the conspirators, that his sword was to be unsheathed the second (c'est le premier pas qui co&te), that he vas to join them when the moment for action came, but that he did not; that when General Serrano cppeared at Mannares Narvaez, it is true, kept back, for reasons which he himself knew best; but that when the succe3s of the movement was no longer doubtful Narvaez wrote a letter to the triumphant rebels, congratulating them on their victory. Now, whatever merit there be In sincerity, O'Donnell is decidedly entitled to it. He has not only avowed the part he took in the movement, but he has gloried in it to the last. The conduct of Narvaez is different. Narvaez denied, which it was hardly necessary to do, his active participation in the rebellion of 1854; he could not, however, avoid confessing his complicity in the plot; his opinion was in favour of overthrowing the Government of the day by an appeal to arms, it is true, but hehesitatedto conspire with any except the Moderado party; and O'Donnell also declared it was not with the Progresistas he himself conspired, but with the Moderados. Three hours were spent on the 18th in muttal recriminationsbetween the twoMarshals-one the late Prime Minister, the other the present; and, no doubt to the great edification of the publio, both these statesmen disputed with each other the honours of the conspirator " for the service of the country." The sitting of the 19th inst. was also of an exciting character. After some explanations of a personal nature from O'Donnell, and a few words from Narvaez, who still gave the name of " most worthy Generals" totherebels of 1854, and who implored them (for excellent reasons of his own) to bring the exposure to a close-aprayerwhich wasnot attended to-General Lara stoodup todefend one of the Governments whieh had been censured by Narvaez-namely, that of the late Count of Alcoy, and to express his astonishment that General Narvaez, though he praised the conduct of the insurgent chiefs, had not a word of sympathy or approval for the Generals (of wfhom he was one) and the army who remained faithful to the constituted Government. This hit told hard. The Marquis de Miraflores defended the Government of Bravo Murillo, of which he (the Marquis) was a member. He, at the same time, denounced strongly every species of insurrection, every species of revolution, including that of France of 1'789, on wbich the throne of Napoleon III is based, and he declared that he who recognizes revolutions must also recognize " the disgusting (nuameabDU2) principle of the sovereignty of the people." In this censure of course O'Donnell and Narvaez were both comprised. M. Pidal, Minister of Foreign Affairs, closed the debate on the 19th, and displayed all the cutting sarcasm of his oratory. He denounced O'Donnell as a traitor to the Moderado party; he denounced the insurrection of 1854; he denounced its head as a Dictator; he denounced all who admitted having been conspirators-and in this term was necessarily included Narvaez, the head of the Government to which M. Pidal himself now belongs. I confess that I do not set much value on the sentimental language of General Narvaez about the propriety of reconciliations, the virtue of complete forgetfulness of the past, of union among all citizens, &c. Such sentiments are always in the mouth of a new Minister, who wishes that his lease of power should be as long and as tranquil as possible; but they are recommendations which he himself has ever been the first to disregard. It would certainly be convenient to Narvaez if the discussion on such perilous matters were put a stop to, as most unpleasant disclosures may come out of them. But there are members in bothlHouses who will insist upon speaking, and we may yet have still more exciting passages. On the whole, the display is scandalous enough. In any other country, with a Sovereign better advised and more reasonable, and with a Court having more pretensions to morality, the scenes that are now taking place in the Cortes might be turned to advantage, and the civil Dower, with the supremacy of justice and the lawv-with, in a word, rational liberty-might be raised on the ruins of this ever-recurring military despotism. After such a scandalous display even Bravo Murillo himself would offer a chance of repose after the distracting struggles among these ambitious and discontented satraps. In Spain the change is not yet possible. If it occurred and the civil power got uppermost to-morrow, the GeneralsI would again have recourse to conspiracy and fly oat into rebellion, and even the national party itself would have no other resource than to place itself| under the agis of a fresh military insurrection, and so on to the end. The Grand Duke Constantine has definitively bidden farewell to Paris, and Prince Napoleon has returned. The Monitfer of to-day informs the public of the latter fact. Whether the Prince feels regret at not having shared in the " humours" of Villeneuve l'Etang or the festivities of Fontaineblean is more than I know. What is certain is, that soon after the Grand Duke left the Prince returned. The Journal des Dibacs announces that the ratification of the treaty of peace between Great Britain and Persia has arrived at Constantinople, and, contrary to the assertion of the Nord, of Brussels, it contains no reservation. All the visitors at the Palace of Fontainebleau took leave of the Emperor and Empress yesterday. Their Majesties received, during the afternoon, the different public bodies of the town of Fontainebleau, together with the officers of the garrison. The Emperor and Empress will arrive at the Tuileries this afternoon. The great bodies of the State, together with the functionaries presented at previous receptions, will be received by the Emperor at 9 o'clock to-morrow afternoon. The Monitaw, de la lot announces that the East Tndia Company have taken possession of the island of Perim, at the entrance of the Red Sea, and which is in the middle of the Strait of Babelnandeb. The British flag was hoisted there on the 14th of February by the Company's troops, and the occupation is definitive. The following is the cause assigned :-Two years since an English ship, which wvas shipwrecked on the coast of Berbera, was pil.laged by the natives. The E]ast India Company having applied to the chiefs of the Saumalis for satisfaction, they showed every disposition to do so, but all their efforts were unavailing. They were summoned to Aden to discuss the matter with the Resident, and, as it was proved that they were unable to defend ships from pirates, a treaty was concluded, containing a clause by which it was stated that the Company would occupy the island of Perim, and place a garrison there to protect ships navigating that sea. The island of Perim which was first occupied in 1784, is situated between Arabia and Africa, on the very point at which the Red Sea commences, and it divides the strait into two channels. The passage to the east, on the side of Arabia, is only three miles wide; that to the west, on the African side, is about 10 or 12. On the south-west, towards the widest entrance of the straits, the island forms one of the fixest ports imaginable. It is a mile in length and half a mile in breadth, and the depth varies from 7 to 25 fathoms. The anchorage iS excellent, the entrance is perfectly sheltered, and it is no exaggeration to say that 40 ships of the line might eaily anchor there in smooth water 100 yards from the shore. A few ships of war stationed there will be sufficient hermetically to close the entrance to the Red Sea. Aden is placed in a position much less favourable, for that port is 100 miles from the strait, and the reason it was chosen, 20 years simce, was, that although it possesses few resources, it has more than the island of Perim. There is 'water to be had at Aden by means of cisterns, and there are seasons of the year when the aqueducts can receive the torrents which flow from the neighbouring hills. The island of Perim, on the contrary, is absolutely devoid of everything: it has not a drop of water; its sandy and volcanic soil produces only some stunted and dusty briars. it is uninhabited, and everything must be brought to it. It would appear from a first view to be a position little desirable, but, on consideration, it is easy to understand why the Company has mado this acquisition, and why the British Government attaches so much importance to it. It is now clear, when the Isthmus of Suez is about to be opened, that the Red Sea nwJ4jnin~f f.o +ue-ome the great- co eca roa b- cannot fail to beCOmete tegieat commIercial road between Europe and Asia. It is not necessary to erect any fortifications on the island of Perim. Aden is sufficiently near to supply all that may be required. But Aden, strong as it is, does not absolutely command the strait, aud the largest fleets might pass without danger between Aden and the coast of Africa. On the other hand, nothing can pass the island of Perim without the permasion of those who are its masters. A detachment of artil- lery of the Indian army ha been stationed there provisionally. A temporaF arsenal and fortifica- tions have been erected, an supp]ies of all descrip- tions have been brought from Aen for the garrison which is to occupy that; desolate station, A letter fromBolegna, of the 18th inat., announces that the Pope was received with the greatest enthusiiam at Loretto on the 14th. He left on the 16th for Fermo. On his return from Fermo the Holy Father will spend Ascension-day at Loretto. He will leave there the 22d for Ancona, where he wil remain on the 23d and 24th. He will make a tour to lesi on the 25th, and to his native town, Sinigaglia, on the 26th. Extraordinary prepara. tions are being made at Sinigaglia to give the Pope an enthusiastic reception. AUSTRTA. ('%O OUX OWsB OnVNDPO POn)T.) Vi INAA, M Y 22. On Wednesday, the 20th, the Emperor went by extra train to Waitzen, where he spent a couple of hours in visiting the cathedral and public establish m-ments . Accrring to the offQcia reports, sis Majesty was received with extreme enthusiasm. Thle Archduchms Sophia Prederica in much better, and her younger si6ter, the Princess Gisella, is quits well again. Most CÃ¯Â¿Â½otradictory reports relative to the petition of the Hungarian magnates are in cirCulation, but the following account of what took place when it 'was gresented is probably. not very far from the truth:-beveral Hungarian noble3 were in the Palace at Buda, but only the Cardinal Archbishop of Gran, who is the Primate of Hungary, had an audience of His Majesty. His Eminence remained about three-quarters of an houc with the Emperor, and when he left the audiencechamber he was quite "radiant" (raiyonnant). The account given by the Archbishop of what had passed during the audience was, that His Majest-; who had treated him with the greatest possible kiManess, had expressed his intention to do all in his power for Ilungary, but had declined to accept the petition, " because it might contain requests which could not possibly be granted, and he did not wish to know the names of the persons who had made them." Some of the magnates are inclined to suspect that the Primate did not inform the Emperor that he had been deputed topresent the petition, andwasactually the bearer of it, but his Eminence is a gentleman by birth and breeding, and would hardly condescend to quibble or prevaricate. That the Hungarian nobles were extremely dissatisfied with the result of the atep they had taken is a positive fact, for they lost no time in leaving Pesth. In a matter of such extreme delicacy it is not advisable to mention names, but a Hungarian noble who for a time occupied a very high post under the present Government has given to the Governor-General and to the Emperor a faithful account of the state of public feeling in Hungary The old Conservatives-a score of noles, who have learnt little or nothing by experience-.-ill lon for the ancient Elungarian constitution, with all its absurdities, but the Liberal party, which consists of 9-lIths of the nation, is more reasonable inits wishes. It acknowledgesthat the constitution of St. Stephen is unfitted to the necessities of the times, but it desires a certain degree of self-government, a less faulty provincial administration, and a ceation of all the attempts to force the German language upon the Hungarian nation. If an Hungarian is asked how many Magyar there are in the countries formerly knowvn as the kdngdom of Hungawy (Hungary, Croatia, Slavonia, the Banat, and the Servian Voivodina), he replies about seven millions and a half; but, if the same question is put to an Austrian emn.ploy6, the answer received is "four millions." In order to make his nationalityappear more formidable the Hungarian exaggerates, but the Austrian estimate is certainly much too small. In the opinion of well-informed and dispassionate persons,there may be in Hlungary five millions of " thorough-bred " Magyars, and about 1,000,000 of Germans, &c., who have become completely " Magyarized." It is said that the estates of the late Count Lous Batthyani, who was for a time Minister-President in Hungary, are about to be restored to his widow and children, and it is sincerely to be hoped that tbe report is true. It is well to let bygones be bygones, but some of the first persons in this empire are of opinion that Count Lou's Batthyani would not have been sentenced to death by a civil court. As many false reports are in circulation in respect to the relations between Austria and Sardinia,it may be as well to observe thatthingsareinverynearly the same state as they were when Count Paar quitted Turin. Not long since notice was given to the King of Sardinia, who ia a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece, of the decease of General Count Ficquelmont, but a Vienna correspondent of the Augs1nurg Gazette is in error when he states that the information was contained in an autograph letter addressed by the Emperor Francis Joseph to KingVictorEmmanuel. The officialnotice of the decease of Count Ficquelmont, who was in possession of the Order of the GEolden Fleece, was given to all its members in the name of the Emperor of Austria, as Grand Master. The relations between Naples and England are no better now than they were three or four months ago. There was a moment when Hler Majesty's Government was inclined to come to terms with His Neapolitan Majesty, but by some means or other it acquired proof positive that Ferdinand IL intended to deceive England and France by schein-cmwessionen (apparent concessions). If the coolness between Austria and Naples should continue, you may soon expect to hear that General Martini has received an indefinite leave of absence, and left a secretary to carry on the diplomatic business. The exact state of the Holstein question may be described in half-a-dozen lines. On Friday or Saturday last-the 16th or 16th-a messenger arrived from Copenhagen with a despateb, in which it was said that the newly-formed Government would convoke the Holstein Estates (Setnde) in the month of August, and settle the questions relative to the provincial constitution, domains, &c., in a way that would satisfy the two great German Powers. The contents of the despatch induced Austria and I Prussia to relinquish their intention of bringing the matter before the German Confederation, and proposing to send "troops of execution" into Holstein. The so-called " Riverain Commission" manages to keep its deliberations so secret that little more is knowvn than that the Austrian Danubian Steam Navigation Company will open a direct communication between Vienna and Ulm as soon as the perfect freedom of the Danube has been confirmed by the Paris Conference. There was a panic on 'Change to-day, during which almost all kinds of izdms7iel stock fell three per cent. Austro-French railroad scrip, which opened at 211, was as low as 207i at the close. PRUSSIAL (FROM OUR OWN cORRESPONENT.) BERLI, MAY 23. The King returned to Berlin on Tuesday eveninr from Stettin in time to meet the Queen at th3 terminus of the Anhalt Railway, on her retur.s from her visit to the Saxon Court at Pillnitz; fron there the Royal couple proceeded to Charlottenburg, and on the following day the Court removed to Potsdam. The Prince of Prussia visited the Agricultural Exhibition and Cattle Show at Stettinalso on Tuesday, and returned to town the following day. If theaccounts be true that are inserted inthe proviucial papers, this Exhibition has attracted a considerable number of our countrymen thither; probably they were sellers of agricultural implements and buyers of grain; cattle-dealers will hardly have found it worth their while to proceed there, seeing tbat the importation of cattle and various animaL products is just now prohibited in England. It may be worth notice that no case of murrain has as yet shown itself in the Baltic provinces of Prussia during the present visitation; the disease exhibited itself in the Russian towns on the Prussian frontier, but was prevented from entering by the very strict sanitary measures observed by the loeal authorities. In Oppeln, in Silesia, the only place where the disease contrived to enter, there have been altogether 138 head of cattle killed on this account, but of these a very small numbezindeed was known to be infected. The various military cordons that had been drawn rouna several suspected places in Silesia, on the Polish frontier, are being now sent home. On the Prusso-Austrian frontier, however, all the precautionary measurea are being kept up still, as the dis-. ease is known not to be by any means extinct in Austrian Gallicia. Prince Frederick William has come in from Breslau, where his regiment is stationed, to spend a few days with his family, which is now assembled at Potsdam in its various summer residences-the King and Queen at Sans-Souci, the Prince of Prassia at Babe]sberg, and Pdnce Carl at Glienicke. A more lovely spot can hardly be imagined than the environs of the town of Potdam, with its 11 Royal Palaces, and the tasteful seats of the Royal Princes nestling in luxuiant foliage, which at this season of the year is in this psrt of the wrorld of most vivnd freshness and beauty. The view from Sans-Souci over the inter'en- ing valley of the Havel to the disant- hills, with the town of Potsdam lying deep in the hollow, and the Royal parks, &c., clothing the banks of the stream, while the eye ranges over the tops of the woodsl, and distinguishes through the clear air the white forms of the marble groups in the gardens, or the rainbows playing in the sDray 6f the fountains, is one of the loveliest scenes imaginable; but it is one which I fear our countrymen, who visit it in numbers, seldom e in its ful perfection, owing to their habit of travelling in the autaumn, when nature is already tired out with the exertions of her summer exhibition. Next Monday the King will leave here, accompanied by several Princes of the Royal Family, for Schwerini where, in company of a very largo party of the reigning familfies of the North of GermAny, be will be present at the inauguration of the ns v palace which the Grand Dake of MecklenburgSchwerin has lately completed. The account, which reach us here from that out-of-the.way place describe this new palace in somewhat the same terms as one meets with in children's tales, or whea reading of " dark knights and fair ladyes," or of robber chiefa-d -a Radeliffe, for instance. It Is all of stone, and built in the medineval style, upon an island, which it entirely occupies, and is connected with the mainland by fortilied drawbridges, and is large enough to accommodate all the Sove. reigns of Europe if they should come to visit the Grand Duke all at once, and bring ever such nume. rous suites with them. In the early part of next month the King will repair again to Marienbad, the waters of which he found so beneficial to him last year. At the same time the Queen will repeat her visit to the springs at T8plitz, in Saxony. Their Majesties will, however, both of them return to Petsdam in the early part of July, as in the middle of that month the Empres-Mother of Russia is expected there on a visit. Nothing has transpired here to favour the notion that Prince Napoleon's visit to tha Saxon Court was in any way connected with matrimonial projects, and what little we hear frowm Saxon sources is as nearly as possible destructive of any such fancies. The King and Queen of Saxony, with their two daughters, the Princesses Sidonia and Sophia, passed through Leipsic, on a journey to Italy, at the same time Prince Napoleon was taling leave ef the Crown Prince of Saxony at Dresden. It was in connexion with this journey that the Archduchess Sophia of Austria and the Queen of Prussia, and other members of the family, came to bid the travellers good-bye; the meeting had no connexion with any matrimonial projects of Prince Napoleon, or in any way with him. I On the 12th inst. there was a confirmation held at Coblentz byDr. Spencer, Bishop of Madras, acting forthe Bishop of London, for the purpose of enabling the youthful members of the numerous English families resident on the banks of the Rhine to havc the benefit of this epiacopal rite. It will be gratifying to the friends of the Church in England to learuk that a very satisfactory answer has been given here .to a preliminary inquiry made by the Colonial Church and School Society in England as to what reception a mission from that body would meet with in Prussia, and the object of which is to appoint and provide for ministers of the Church of England to perform the usual religious offices for the various congregations of English Episcopalianascattered throughout this kingdom. The answer returned by the Oberkirchenrath, or Supreme Consistory, has been that it would welcome the arrival of the deputation with great cordiality, and further its views. There is, therefore, some chance now of the spiritual destitution of the English residents in Prussia being relieved, for hitherto, Protestant as the country is, and eminently favourable as the King is to our Church and its ministrations, we have not as yet had one single consular or other chalain appointed to any congregation throughout the kngdom. The Bomner Zeitung states very decidedly that the Prince of Wales will spend the months of July and August at Konigawinter, and that the Hotel de rEurope has been taken for him and his suite, which, together with the servants, numbers 27 persons. The rent to be paid for these two months is said to be 12,000 thalers (1,8001). The same journal informs us that the Prince3s Royal will also pass a month or two on the Rhine, and that the spot chosen for her Royal Highness's temporary residence is Remagen, a little way further up the Rhine, above Bonn. Since I last touched upon the Neuchatel affair the necessary instructions have been forwarded from here to Count Hatzfeldt in Paris, and, as I have every reason to believe, in the sense which I held out to you as most likely to pervade them. The King gives way to the representations that have been made to him of the difficulty or impossibility of the Swiss Church property being restored in vaturd, &c., and of the sufficient security that the treaty with Switzerland gains by being drawn up under the moral guarantee of the Four Powers in conference assembled. The past week has apparently been spent in communications between the representatives of the four Powers in Paris, but as yet there are no tidings of a day having been fixed for another sitting. Although much stress was recently laid upon the inexpediency of making any alterations In the draught of the treaty merely to please the King of Prussia, it is not apprehended that any opposition will be made to his renunciation of the million francs.
TUB UNITED STATES. (FROM OUP NEW YORK % NEW YORK, MA 13. From all that can be learnt here of what is going on atWashington,the failure of the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty has created no little hubbub there. The New York journals have been daily and duly loaded with telegraphic communications of the peculiar character known as feelers for the popular opinion. When a Governrent is not exactly sure how the public current runs on any measure, or whether even there is any publio cu-rent at all, we invariably begin to see a series of telegraphic communications in the morning journals from special correspondents, professing to have peculiar means of intelligence. These feelers are often the result of a conversation with some Cabinet Minister, or more frequently still, with the minor luminaries, who in Washington, as well as other political capitals, are full of ca?wrds. Meanwhile the Government has time to find out what the public sentiment is, and acts accordingly. The sum of eil the intelligence thrown out in this manner about the treaty is that the Administration is not at present disp)sedto go into anynew treaty, and that the whole matter is to be left until the next Congress meets. Some indignation was expressed in the Senate at the time when the treaty was under discussion (and still stronger now) at the clause in the treaty with Honduras for ever excluding slavery from the BayIslands; tojwhichthe UnitedStateswere required, in fact, to become parties. It was felt that it was not exactly courteous to ask a Government representing 15 States in which slavery was tolerated or admired to condemn the institution. " We are asked," says the NZew York Herald, "to become parties to the limitation of the independence of a feeble State, and to cast reproach upon our own domestic institutions in a joint guarantee with England that there shal be no slavery in Honduras. The United States are asked to do this, in one-half of whose territories slavery is an existing, recognized institution, so interwoven with the habits, the social condition, indeed, of the people, as to be inseparable without a shock which no just man can contemplate without dismay, and in the whole of which, by our confederated constitution, its lawful character is established and the rights growing out of it." In the last clause of this extract we have the doctrine of the Drel-Scott decision pushed to its extreme, and slavery legitimatizedintheFreeSta. TheNorthern States have always claimed the right of shutting off slaves from their soil-some won't even allow " free niggers,"-but this new doctrine upsets all the old notons, and, if carriedout practically,will make Newport and Saratoga more delightful than ever. If the languishing daughters of the Carolinas or the sweet Creoles of Louisiana can bring their retinues with them to the northern watering places, the whole South will move northwardly with the tropical sun. I have not yet seen this advanced as a reason why slavery should be permitted in Newport, Saratoga, and Cape May, with the usual Parliamentary protection, eundo, morando, et redeurndo. I fancy, -however, that it would be a potent argunent, espejcially with the young men. T Whe P?resident's health is by no means good. I am told that he looks feeble and prematurely old, though by no means a chicken for that matter. The N~ational Hotel disease, under which he suffered last winter, bas still posession of his system, and his constant attention to the most minute duties of the office leaves him no leisure to get himself into condition again. The press of office-seekers is tremendous, and the goodnatured old gentleman, instead of turning them over to the departments as others have done, sees everybody and hears everybody's 6tory. One would suppose that what with the ;rejection of the Englis trcaty, threatenings of reLnewed troubles in Knas, a rebellion among the men of 70 wives on the other side of the Rocky Mountains, promised disturbances in Panama, and an unsettled account wsith China, the President would have enough to do without under| taking to "rotate" the outs into office. But he finds time, notwithstanding, to hear al complaints, solicitations, arguments, persuasions, and appeals fom men and wfomen on1 these mubjects. he " spoils" are the great element of political power, and on their judicious distributioa depends the strength or weakness of a party. A correspondent of the New Yor;k Herald enter 'into a very practical calculation of the value set by Democratic Admiaistrations on Democratic strength. AIaine, which gave but 39,000 votes to Buchanan, and which sends no Democratic representatives, enjoys in the distribution of patronage, salaries to the amount of $40,000 a-year, or more than $1 a-head! Massachusetts, which did even worse than Maine, gets $iX a Democrat; while New York gets but 31 cents, ever faithful Virginia but 75 cents, and Pennsylvania, whome fidelity saved Buchanan, but 60 cents. This argues injustice and inequality, says this writer; but to me It seems rather to prove chaity on the part of the Federal Government *in providing for a set of faithful supporters, who vwithout Federal patronage would be obliged to go supperless. Tt argues, also, that the indomuitable Yankee knows how to feather his nest, put him where you may. This distribution of patronage is not always done in the most harmonious manner. It is, of course, quite impossible even for a Democratic President to know every white man between Nova Scotia and California. The recommendations of local members of the right political stamp have as much weight here as in the more sober Parliamentary system of Great Britain. But it sometimes happens that a member represents only a section of a party, and then the Government has a nice time in adjusting the differences. If the " in" whose place is wanted is an Administration supporter, with friends at his back, the state of things is still more disagreeable, and may, and sometimes does, result in unpleasant consequences. For instance, Mr. Sickles one of the I9ew York delegation in the Lower House, wanted a New York office for a friend. The Democratic incumbent resisted, and, taking Mr. Sickles's interference in ill part, challenged that gentleman. The member, not perceiving that he had committed an offence, refused to fight, whereupon the office-holder walked into the member's room in the hotel with a whip to take snmmary revenge. A mslne ensued, in which each party claimed to come off the victor; at any rate, each bore away some of the marks of the conflict. Thus the distribution of patronage may create differences even in the harmonious bosom of a united political party. Even the patriotism of America is not free from the struggles for place or the rivalries for power. A2propos of patronage, the foreign appointments of the new Admuiistration are not yet gazetted, nor is it yet known when they will be made. Since my last letter we have had two rebellions in a small way-unimportant, as compared with the great municipal resistance in New York or the muttered threatenings in Utah, but pretty little affairs taken by themselves. At the last session of the Legislature commissioners were appointed for purchasing a new site for the quarantine station and superintending the removal. Staten Island separates the upper from the lower bay of New York. Its eastern coast forms one of the shores of the famouis "narrows" through which all the foreign commerce of New York must pass; and here, long ago, when the island was a comparative wilderness, its beautiful hills covered with forest, and its romantic valleys unknown to the New Yorker, the quarantine buildings were established on the water's edge, about four miles below the-battery. As New York has grown its citizens have found the merits of this part of the island for summer residences. Gradually the trees have fallen, excellent roads have been constructed for driving and riding, the available places for good views and sea breezes have been studded with villas, ferries have been established, maldng constant and regular communication with town, and the happy owners of land have pocketed large sums from its increased value. When the yellow fever overtook the quarantine station last summer it found it in the midst of a large population directly by a pier where hundreds, if not thousands, of passengers were daily landed. There was an outcry, of course, and a demand for removal, to which the Legislature responded bypassing the law authorizing the appointment of the commiseloners above referred to. These commissioners bought a piece of property some miles further up the island upon the south shore, in the neighbourhoed of oyster fishermen. Strange to say, the lishermen relished the vicinity of pestilence as little as their wealthier neighbours on the eastern shore, and as soon as it was known that the thing was done past prevention they walked in procession one night to the house intended for the hospital, turned the inmates out of doors, set fire to it, and burnt it to the ground. The Govornor of the State offers a large reward for the discovery of the offenders, who seem to have taken little pains to conceal themselves, but so strong is public feeling in their favour that it is said to be very doubtful whether they will be arraigned; or, if arraigned, whether a jury will be found to convict them. The other rebellion is in a still more humble way. The prisoners in the Penitentiary at Sing Sing, on the Hudson, deeming it unjust that they should be confined while so many criminals were at large, took it into their own hands to work out their liberty. Four notorious prisoners who were at the bottom of the plot feigned illness from timne to time, apparently without exciting suspicion, so as to be put in the sick ward together, and there arranged the details of the rising. As the prisoners were being marched from their breakfasts, the signal was given. They attacked the keepers, and a large number made their escape. The signal for chase was given, and the prisoners, from long confinement, being unable to run, were soon distanced, and, strange to say, every one retaken. During the last week one of the last monuments of old New York has disappeared before the advancing press of business. In the year 1756 the foundation-stone was laid for the buildings then and since occupied by King's College, on a tract of land so far up the island as to be out of the reach not only of business but of population. The institution was liberally endowed as things went in those days. When the States cut loose from the King the name of the institution was changed to the more euphonious and republican one of Columbia, but the buildings and endowment remained. Population some years ago left it in the rear; and now, business having quite encircled it, the college authorities have given up their grounds in Park-place for the construction of marble warehouses, and have removed the whole institution some four or five miles further up the island, planting it again upon the outsklirts of population. Seeing the immense amount of building going on, and the rapid increase of New York, one is tempted to speculate whether another century will roll over before it will again find itself in the midst of business. I see no signs of check in the prosperity of New York. On the contrary, more buildings are going on, and of a more magnificent character, this year than ever before. Whole streets are again in ruins, on which marble warehouses will rise equalling in beauty any warehouses in the world. Shipping alone is stagnant, and freights low; but this can only be temporary, and meanwhile manufactures of almost every branchare concentrating here. If WfouterVanSwiller were to return and see the quiet places where he used to enjoy his pipe amid the cares of government, or if Peter the Testy were to behold the meadows devoted in his day to pasturing the cattle destined for the distant town now covered with expensive dwellings, I fancy that those respectable old gentlemen would go crazy at once. The bench of New York has just lost one of its oldest and chiefest ornaments by the death of Mr. Oalley, chief justice of the Superior Court, a gentleman to whom was accorded the rare honour of being twice electedto the office of justice bypopularacclamation, after having filled the same post for many years underthe appointmentof the Governor. He was an excellent magistrate, an able lawyer, and an honest man, who commanded the confidence of the community and the respect of the bar, and his loss will be much felt when the sytem of an elective judiciary tends to place partisans in office. The trial of Mrs. Canningham has closed with the anticipated verdict of acqui ttal, and we are as much in the dark as ever about the crime. Although the trial was managed with little skill on either sde, they seem to have succeeded in explaining away most or all of the circumstances-opportunity and motive excepted-which tended to fix guilt upon the accused. The commercial news is unimportant. The shipments of gnld by the Africa correspond almost exactly with those of the corresponding period Lat year. Exchange is at 109k to 109i.

MOX2iY-MIARKETand CITY TiV TELLIGiNCo Monday Evening. The English funds have been steady to day, notwithstanding some large specalative sales. Co'nsols have stood at 930 to for money and 93' to S4 for the 4th of June. Fior the new account in July transactions have taken place at 94l to a. After reguls hours there was a decline of an eighth. The sales for the account were stated to be to the extent of 300,0001. or 400,0001., and it is supposed they were chiefly on behalf of Greek firms. Tuie dealers, however, took them readily, and prices were at the moment uninfluenced. The effect of the announcement of the shipment on Saturday of 17o,000 sovereigns to Brazil and elsewhere was counteracted by the largeness of the arrival this week from America. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214 ; Redaced, 92i to i; New Three per Cents., 92i to i; India Stock, 220 to 222; India Bonds, 8s. to 4s. discount; Exchequer Bonds, 98i to 99; and Exchequer-bi]s, June, ls. to 3s. premium; March, 3s. to 6s. premium. In the Stock-Exchange this morning there was a full supply of money at from 6 to 6Ã¯Â¿Â½ per cent., but later in the day an increased demand was observable. The discount-market was without pressure, but at the Bank the applications were numerous. Foreign securities have not varied in any great degree. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 94k, 3, and i; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for money, at 10.1J.

Certiticates, Y7 and 97g. In the corn-market this morning the rise of 2a. which occurred on Friday was fully maintained. The Africa, from New York to-day, has brought 307,0001., nearly all in gold. The Indus, from the Mediterranean, has brought 3,6001., aud the Alhambra, from the Peninsula, 2,8571. It is believed that not much, if any, of this will be taken for the Bank of France, and that it will chiefly be in request for purchases of silver. The steamer Minna, from the Mediterranean, has brought 42,000 sovereigns for the Ottonian Bank. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 69f. 40. for both money and account, showing an improvement of a half per cent. Although the Bourse has exhibited sudden firmness to-day, the private accounts from Paris are not encouraging. The Bank, it is affirmed, continues to maintain its stock of bullion solely by artificial purchases, which are no louger limited to the head establishment, but are made also at some of the principal branches. During the last few days ther e has been a slight diminution of pressure in the discountmarket, but, owing to the increase'of the circulation required at this season in connexion with the silk crop and the renewal of the demand for silver for China, there is little hope of any permanent ease. The Government, it is said, use every means to prevent the exportation of silver, and even this week the police have seized several parcels of fivefranc pieces destined for England. The drain of gold to Lombardy continues, and the Bank of Piedmont, it is understood, will absorb in the course of the next few days 400,0001. in napoleons, which wil be obtained from the branches of the Bank of France at Lyons and Marseilles. It is added that the Bank of Piedmont have resolved as soon as the necessary authorization can be obtained to raise their rate of discount to 7A per cent., and there are also complaints that the Bank of Vienna pursue an extremely stringent course in dealing with French paper. The Count D'Argout, after having been Goveruor of the Bank of France for 21 years, has tendered his resignation, which is said to have been just accepted by the Emperor. According to report the Count was hurt at the little deference shown to him in the late monetary councils at the Tuileries. As his long administration was chiefly distinguished by extreme prudence, his retirement will, perhaps, prove acceptable to the speculators, and, coupled with the rumour that the Bank are about to issue notes of a denomination as low as 50f., it may, perhaps, have been a cause of the advance in prices. It was thought that M. de Parieu would probably be his successor. it is now stated that, notwithstanding the efforts of the principal creditors of M. Charles Thurneyssen to ascertain the limit of his defalcations, no ponitive conclusion has yet been arrived at, but that the amount is not likely to be less than 600,0001. When 800,0001. was first mentioned as a rough estimate it was treated as a ridiculous exaggeration, and a statement was boldly put forth that they would scarcely approach even a tenth part of that sum. It is mentioned in letters from Paris that when M. Thurneyssen left, on the 21st, he took refuge with some relatives in Germany instead of proceeding directly to New York. Probably, however, a variety of statements have been circulated on this point to baffle pursuit. One communication to-day from a leading capitalist asserts that the Credit Mobilier is understood to have found itself compromised to the extent of 75,0001., apart from personal losses sustained by several of its admimstrators. The principal foreign losers are at Amsterdam and Antwerp. The ainancial advices from New York to-day describe continued heaviness in railw aystocks, and a further decline in most descriptions. Erie was quoted 41i ; Reading, 80 ; Panama, 93i ; New York Central, 86 ; and IllinoisCentral, 36 premium. Business was dull, all transactions beinig deferred as much as possible for the operation of the new tariff on the 1st of July. Notwithstanding the large shipment of specie to England by the present packet, money was abundant at 8 per cent., the ank returns for the week not being unsatisfactory, while 300,0001. or 400,000l. was expected to arrive immediately from California. (onsiderable quantities of Spanish gold appear to be in course of transmission from Havre to New York, whence they are sent to Havaimah for the purchase of silver. Three rather large failures bad been atnounced at Boston, the total liabilities being estimated at 200,0001. The names of the firms are-Whitney, Fenno, and Co. ; Chapman, Lord, and Hale; and Shaw, Sampson, and Bramhall-all intporters of *eign goods. The advices from Cuba describe increasing activity in the slave trade, and state that the large profits of the planters during the past year have led to an extraordinary stato of inflation, every one being engaged in bank, railroad, or other jointstock schemes. A Credit Mobilier had been formed with a capital of 1,000,0001., and its shares had realized 26 premium. All the waste lands of the island are to be graduaDy acquired by the bank, and are to be put into a state of production. The trade reports for the pastweek show increasing dulness at Manchester, and a further disposition on the part of the manufacturers to avoid the risks of production at the present price of the raw material. F rem Birmingham the advices describe steadiness in the iron-market, and no alteration in the general trades of the place. The hosiery business at Leicester and elsewhere is inactive. In the woollen districts there has been a slight increase of firmness, and the Irish linen-markets are without animation. at the ann;.at meeting of the Oriental Bank Corporation held to-day, Mr. H. G. Gordon presiding, a dividend and bonus of 7 per cent. for the last six. months were declared, and the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. Attention was directed by the chairman to the increase in the inaurance fund, which now stands at 38,0001., and to the item of ]43,1141. representing the buildings, &c., belonging to the bank. It was explained, with regard to the latter, that the directors find the purchase of premises more advantageous than an occupation as tenants. The loss through the fire in China has been $27,000, but it cannot be recovered in the ordinary course, although fully insured As the Government, however, will claim compensation for the losses of British merchants wheD the existing struggle shall have terminated, the amount may be eventually obtained. The reserved fund of 200,0001. is invested in East India Govermment securities, Exchequer-bills, and Turkish Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- " The amount of net profib for the year 1856 is 163,3621. 2s. 6d. from which a dividend for the first six months at the rate of 10 per cent. per annumji has already bear. paid, and it is now the intention of the directors to declare a like dividend, together with a a bonus of 2 per cent. for the six moon.hs ended on the 31st of December last.

Two months ago an application was made to the diectors on bebalf of the London and Eastern Bank, which was in difficulties. The corporation held none of tbe obligations Qf that bank, but some of their most valuled constituonts being interested the directors agreed, in conjunction with other establishments connected with India, to assist in the liquidation of its affairs, in order to save the expense and robablelitigation consequent on a judicial winding up. lhe corporation has ample security for any advances it can be required to make for this purpose, and the lquidation is being carried out under the superintendence of one of its officers. In consequence of applications by proprietors to know the extent of their liability under the charter, and in order to prevent misapprehension on this subject, the directors take this opportunity to state that the oharter explicitly limits the liability of the shareholders to 501. for each share held by them, that is to say, 251. already paid up, and 251. additional." At a meeting of the European and American Steam Shipping Company, held to-day, the resolution passed on a former occasion for an increase of capital was confirmed. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised eight vessels-four to Ielboourne, three to Sydney, and one to New Zealand, with an aggregate capacity of 6,190 tons. The rates of freight exhibit scarcely any variation. In the general business of the port of London during the past week there has been considerable activity. Owing to the favourable change of wind the arrivals have been large. The number of vessels reported inward was 303, being III more than in the previous week. These included 33 with cargoes of corn, rice, &c.; 4 with cargoes of coffee; 4 with cargoes of tea, amounting in aU to 57,107 packages, in addition to 773 bales of silk; and the unusually large number of 44 cargoes of sugar, the greaiter portion being from the West Indies. The number of ships cleared outward was 103, including 9 in ballast, showing a decrease of 38. The number of vessels on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 57, being 10 more than at the last account. Of these 8 are for Adelaide, 4 for Geelong, 3 for Elobart-town, 4 for Launceaton, 2 for Melbourne, 1 for Moreton Bay, 5 for New Zealand, 14 for Port Phillip, 2 for Portland Bay, 1 for Port Fairy, and 13 for Sydney. At an adjonrneda meeting to-day of the creditors of Messrs. Thomas Biggs and Son, of Broken-wharf, Thames-street, nearly the whole of the parties present signed an agreement to accept 9s. in the pound secured. Intelligence has been received of the destruction by fire of the Joseph Somes, of and from London to Melbourne, near the island of Tristan d'Acunha, on the 25th of February; crew and passengers saved. The ship and the cargo, which are heavily insured, are valued at 80,0001. By the Sutlej (James) advices have been received from the Cape of Good Hope to the 28th of March. The Harbinger steamer, which left Dartmouth February X, arrived at the Cape on the 28th of March. The Robert Lowe, which left Mauritius the 18th of March, was due at the Cape on the 31st, en route to England. The Committee of the Stock-Exchange have appointed Friday, the 29th of May, as a special settling day in the shares of the Dun Mountain Copper Company (limited) and the Nassau Railway, the former to be marked in the official list. The amount paid into the Treasury of the East India-house for bills on India, from the 9th to the 25th of May, was 28,5141.

Annexed are the etatistics of atoeks and prices: - With regard to the general state of the trade, Messrs. Colchester and Woolner report: "There has been consider. able excitement in the tallow-market during the week, and we have to note an advance of ls. Gd. per cwt. in all positions. We attribute this improvement m the first instance to a few purchases made both on the spot and for forward delivery ror export. This alarmed parties who were oversold for delivery in this and next month, and they came forward anxious buyers; holders not being disposed to meet the market, but little business was done until the price reached 58s. The advance for early delivery has caused a corresponding rise in the value of tallow for the last three months, and a large business has been done for that period at 55s. up to 56s. Gd., but at the close on Saturday the market was flat at a decline of 6d. per cwt., with more disposition to sell. Ovme considerable portion of the parchases for 1, delivery has been made by foreiga houses, but It must be borne in mind they do not always export all they purchase.

The association was ono of the sohemeq of 1853 which failed and was ordered to be Wound up. Dr. Daniel was a director, and was quslified to be s0 by taking 200 shares. In October, 1854, a resolution was passed th&t " 2,400 paid-np shares be divided equally among tho promoters of the societyt in consideratilon of the services rendered by them in its formation and management." Two hundred shares were given, to the doctor, and in the proceediags under the Windingup Act he was placed on the list of contributdries m respect of the originrl 200 shares, and as to the 20 shaes given pursuant to the resolution. A cal was made by the Master of 30s. per share, andDr. Daniel, althon h -hesbmtte topay upon the 200 shars he,originaly beid, yet he claimed tobe exempt as tothe200 shares he receiyed as "paid-up shares" pursuant to tho resolution. The Master of the Rolls held that the directors had no right to allot any paid-up shares among themselves.

BOLTS' COURT, CHozuMY-r.aa MAV 2? TA REGENT'S CA-HAL COMPANY V. W .ARR (Before ae MAsTR ofac RoLLs.) f u uun gave 6uJdument in this case, in which the acts were as follows:-The Regent's Canal Companyiin the year 1840 obtained an Act to build a reservoir, toward the formation of which they required some leasehold lands of the defendant's near Hendon. In 181 this Act was amended, the powers of the Land Clauses Consolidation Act being incorporated in it as amended, and a clause to the effect that the company shoald take a certain portion of the defendant's freehold land at Hendon if they decided upon taking his leasehold. In Jnly of the same year the company served notice on the defendant that they would take both his freeholds and leaseholds; and in March, 1853, the amount to be paid was submitted to arbitrators. In October, 1853, the arbitrators made award, fixing the value of the leaseholds aL about 200L, and the freeholds at 2,8004, the title of the property being previously accepted. Defendant took proceedings to set this award aside- but the award being supported bytheCourtof EBicheeuer the companynow filed their bil for specific performance. In answer to this bill the defendant contended that the com any ought not to proceed in equity for the enforcement of their remedy, but ought to base any proceedings they commenced aainust him on the powers which they possessed under the Land Clauses Consolidation Act. The Court, however, held that inasmuch as the due notices had been served by the company. as the award had been made upon complete evidence, and as the award, as fixed, had been supported by the Court of Exchequer, the company might insist upon their remedy in the form tey had selected, and there was ne necessity to rehstrain themn from insisting on the specific performance they claimed. ~ ~ ~ or heplin R.

Cottam, had authorized the first mortgasoe to effect on the life of the last cestuique vie of the lease. by way of security, the first mortgagee alleging that neither she nor the second mortgagee had deprived the mortgagor of possession, and that she had given the f&rst mortgagee an order upon the trustee, out of the rents, to pay him such premiums from time to time as might hbe paid by.him. There was a' difiut in renewing the lease in conisequence of the terms required by the Dean and Chapter of Ca terbury, and the last cestuique vie died before the lease was renewed, and the first mortgagee, having paid two premiums; allowed the policy to drop. There being a fund In court arising from rents, in takding the accounts of the mortgagees the first mortgagee claimed to be allowed the two premiums he had paid in priority to the second mortgagee, and the chief clerk had disallowed such claim. and the first mortgagee obiected to such disallowance and moved to vary the certificate. The first mortgagee had notice of the second mortgage when^ the poliy was effected. The dates of the maortgages wero, respectively, 1832 and 1833, and up to 1836 the trustees of Mrs. Cottam'.' settlement paid the rents to her. A bill was filed to get the lease renewed, and pending that suit the trustees paid no one, but ini 1844 paid to the first mortgagee 2,0DO03 at various times and small sums of U1. each to the mortgagor-in all 150. The first mortgagee contended that the mortgagor was in possession tbrough the trustee, and could deal with the rents, and with such power authorized the surviving trustee to pay the premiams to the first mortgagee. Whereas the second mortpgee contended that, even supposing the mortgao could give such authority, the order was a mere order to pay, which was revoked by the payments made by the trustee in 1844, the fund orr which the order was to operate being ,grn.

In February last the plaintifif entered into a contract with the defendant for the purchase from him of the steamship before named for the sum of 11,0001, to be aid i certain instalments at periods somne of which hJ already passed. Such of the ~Talments as had, according to the defendants contention, come due, not having been pald, the defendant gave notice to the plaintiffs of his intention to sell the ship unless those instaliments were paid within a certain time.

COUIJT OP QUlEEN'S BENCE, WESnMiSTER. EAY 2!5; 'Th- JUMN V. THE GUARDWNS OF THE OM Or LONDON UmIO1r. tcuu'g3 t mlanco, beforc Lord CA3pBELL and Tustice COLMIrDG]4 ERBr, and CFOoi-ToN.) In Tus case a rule had boen granted for a certiorari to briD up an order made by the gurdians of the City of Lonon JUnion, whereby they had ordered the churchwardens and overseers of St. Stophen's, Coleman-street, to pay the sum of 2,800. to the treasurer of the union. The object of the application was to try the validity of the order, it being suggested that it was made without jurisdiction. It appeared that certain officers of the City of London Union their collector named Manini, and a clerk named Paul, had misappropriated the funds of the union, and thus a deficiency to a large amount had been created. To make up the necessay amount, and #to discharge the bls of the various tradesmen which bad been rallowed to fall in arrear, the guardians had made orders on the several parishes in the union to pay their proportion of the deficit. But this order, it was suggeated, was bad, s being madewithout juridiction. Itwas argued that the guardians had no authority to make an order for the payment of debts incurred so far back as 1852; that the shes had already paid the amount required by the guardas for the dischairge of those debts; and that if the monev had been applied as it ought to hve been by the former gaurdians, there would have been no deficit. On these gxrounds the Court had gisranted a rule for a certiorari to uring n the orer, wit a viol to its beng quashed, as Mdr.

COURT 01 EXCOHEUR MoNDY, MAY 25. ITNvW TR[AL PAPX.B. 1'1GEO1N V. LEGG. (SWi2g cn Barco.) -in was an no0ton or trespass for wrongfully assaulting tbe plaintiff and forcing 'him out of a beerhou.e, and breaking his le s in Odoing. The defendant justified himself on the fact at the plaintifl being a chimney-sweeper, came to the beerhouse of the defendant in a dirty condition, and 'was tarned out on his refusal to quit ; to which the plain. tiff replied exoess, and that he had a right to be m the house, it bceing a common inn. At the trial before the Lord Chief Baron at Cambridge it appeared the plaintiff ,came in his working dress and dirty to the beerhouse of the defendant, who ordered tWo policemen to remove 'him on hsis havmng refused to go out. On this a struggle ensued, which was mainly attributable to the strenuous resistance of the plaintiff, who was thrown down or fell forwnrd out of the house end 6o broke his leg. The learned judge expressed himself to be of opinion that the house of theplaintiffwas not a common inn into which the plaintiff had any right by law to enter; that if it were otherwise he had got no right to remain there after objection made to his -presence by the defendant and the other guests, and that he was lawfully removed by force by the police as the servarnts of the defendant, who could not be made responsible for any exeess on their part in carrying out his orders, unless "he authorized it, of which there was no evidenee. Under these circumstances a nonsuit was entered by arrangement, and this rule was subsequently ob. tained for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection on the points above mentioned. Mr. Keane and Mr. Power appeared to show cause against the rule, which was supported by Mr. NAYLOR and Mr. MILLS, who contended chiefly that the defendant was liable in point of law for the excess of iforce employed by the policemen in the execution of his order to remove the plaintiff. The COURT was unanimously of opinion that the rule mnust be discharged, and that the direction of the Chief Baron at the trial was quite correct on all points. The extent of the injury sustained by the plaintiffwas very much to be regretted, no doubt; but it appeared that he had by bis own improper acts mainly contributed to it. In the first place, the house of the defendant was not a common inn, but a beerhouse, so that the owner was not bound to receive the plaintiff as v; guest, hDwever unobjectionable his conduct and appearance might have been; but the defendant had abundant right and reason to order the plaintiff to quit his house, on his presenting himself in his dirty working dress, and in a condition which was unacceptable to the assembled guests, and to remove him by force on his refusal to go. If the defendant did not like himself to use the force which was rendered necessary by the refusal and resistance of the plaintiff 'le was justified in caUing in the policemen, who for that purpose were his servants. The case of the plaintiff was that the police had used unnecessary force, and his replication 'had for its object to make the defendant answerable for that excessive force as a trespasser alJ inifio ; but to do this 'he could not rely on the original order to the police, but munt go further, for a master could not Ohe made ansv-erable in trespass for illegal and excessive acts done by his servant inthe performance of his lawful orders on tte mere proof of that order, for the original order was to do a legal act, not the ilegal one. Here, if there was any excess, the defend. : ant was not shown to have authorized or sanctioned it in -any manner, and on that ground the rule must be dis- charged. The C1rTJZ BARoNentirely agreed with the view expressed .y the other members of the Court. At the trial two points 'were raised; the first involving the right of the Dlaintiff to enter the house of the defendant, treating it as a .common inn, the fact being that it was a beerhouse' and the second raising the question whether the defendant was liable for the acts of the police. I was -then and am now of opinion that a beerhouse is not a common inn, and that the defendant was not liable for the dacts of the police bsyond that reasonable degree of force which was necessary for the removal of the plaintiff from Jhis 'house. It was not pressed at the trial by the plaintiff that the acts of the police had become the acts of the 'defendant by reason of his presence, interference, or non-interfererce with the manner in which they discharged his order, but the nonsuit has arrived on the simple question of law whetber the defendant, as a master, was liable for 'the excess of force used by the police a. his servants, and on that I have no doubt whatever. The rule must there. foro be discharged. Judgment accordingly. SECOND CO URT. Stiggs aS Nisi Prits at Westmtnster, before Mr. Baron CHANNELL and Common Juries.l 3USINESS OF THE COURT. This was the first Nisj Prius sitting in Trinity Term. here are 18 cauNss upon the list. BROWN V. JACKSON AND ANOTHER. Ur. E. James, Q.C.,with l&r. T. J. Clark, appeared forthe 'plaintiff; Mr. Wood represented the defendants, The defendants in this case are dyers and ribanddressers, carrying on business at Brompton and in the city, and the 'plaintiff is a Person who had formerly been in their emVployment. The action was brought to recover damages for oan assault, for the wrongful dismissal of the plaintiff, and 'for breach of contract. It appeared that in April, 1851, the defendants deternained upon commencing a new branch of their businessunamely, the redreEsing and redying of old goods, and that .they made an agreement with tbe plaintiffengaging him to ,superintend it for a period of three years, at a salary of 21. 'per-week, and by his advice purchased a machine for the purpose of carrying it on. After the plaintiff had done work under the agreement for a few months the defendants "dismissed him, and on one occasion when he remonstrated tagalnst his dismissal he was called a drunken old fool, and turned off the premises. The plaintiff in his examination 'utated that there was not the slightest pretence for the imputation of drunkenness, as he had taken nothing that day ut-half a pint of warm beer, which be drank because he felt cold from travelling outside an omnibus. The amount -of the plaintiff's claim in respect of the wrongful dismissal "was'4613. There were various other items of claim, against evbich the defendants pleaded a set-off; and it was arranged in the course of the case that no question should be left to the jury with regard to the assault. *Tbe defence was that the plaintiff, although perfectly -competent in what is called the " riband finishing departsnent" of the business, was so incompetont in the redressing -of redyed gauzes and velvets that the defendants lost the -custom of several wholesale houses in consequence of the .unskfiful mnannerin which the work intrusted to him was performod. They had therefore been obliged to disch*rge ,im, but after his dismnissal they continued for some time to eive him work in the department which he understood. Mr. Baron CHANNSiZ, in eumming up, said the material questiens'for the consideration of the jury wvere whether he plaintiff had represeted that he was competent to do .the particullar kind of work for which he was engaged, a-hether in consequence of his representatioas the de. -fendants had entered into the agree-ent with him, and whether he kad failed to ehow that amount of skil and -3Xbillt of -which he had rop-sented that he was pos.

The yawi went out to her assistance, but the nnaster and crew of the bark would not allow them to board her.

The Balvors then boarded the bark, mucceeded in getting her off tJ2e sand, and conducted her to Yarmouth.

POLIOE. Bow-stuREr.-James Geary, aged 23, who had been for some time in respectable employ as a coachmaker's silk-lace weaver and trimmer, was charged with having attempted to murder his wife, by cutting her throat, on Saturday night last. A large concourse of people had assembled in and about the court, it having been expeoted that the case would assume the aspect of murder. Indeed, it is almost miraculous how the wife could have survived the injury infficted, the knife having passed entirely through her throat. The foUoowing witnesses were examined:- Amelia Baylss sworn.-I am the wife of a police-constable of the F division, and live with my husband on the third floor of 7, Little Russell-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner and his wife occupied a back room on the second floor of the same house. I was going downstairs shortly after 10 o'clock on Saturday night, when I heard the prisoner's wife cry out, " Oh, dear !" I had descended a few more steps when she screamed " Murder 1" I called to the landlady of the house, Mrs. Evans, who was in the parlour, and we ran up to the prisoner's room together. Mrs. Evans opened the door and went in, and I followed. I saw the prisoner's wife lying on the hearthrug and the prisoner leaning over her. He had a knife in his hand. He made a rush at the door. I was frightened, and ran downstairs into the street, intending to look for a policeman. I heard the landlady ask prisoner what was the matter, but he made no reply. I heard no more, but left Mr Evans in the room. When I returned to the house I saw the prisoner in the custody of my hus. band. His wifo was brought downstairs covered with blood. I did not notice particularly, but should say the prisoner was sober. (This witness was a delicate-looking young woman, having a baby in her arms only five weeks old.) Elizabeth Evans, sworn.- I am a widow, and ocupy the house 7, Little Russell-street. The prisoner rented the second foor back room of me furnished, and had been there about a fortnight. The last witness having called me upstairs, I entered the room, and found the prisoner and his wife strogglng on the heartlirg in front of the fireplace. I attempted to separate them, when I saw a knif, in the prisoner' hand, The knife now produoed is the same. (It was a common cheese or dessert knife, being rather sharp-pointed from wear.) I scarcely knew wht had happened in my fright. the wife made an effort to cling to me, and seized my clothes-aparently seeking protection. I made towards the door, dragging her after me to the landing outside. We were all clustered together. I heard nothingsaid, and was so confused and alarmed that I cannot say what followed. Shortly afterwards, when the woman was brought downstairs, I saw a large hole in the aide of her neck. Her lothes were saturated with blood. She seemed conscious, and expressed a desire to see her mother. I did not hear the prisoner speak from first to last. I shoald say he was quite sober. Mr. HENRY.-Do you know if they lived on bad terms ? Witness.-I cannot say so of my own knowledge. I have been told that they quarrelled, and I once heard her say that she had neglected to get his meals ready- His Worship said this conversation would not be evidence. James Bayliss, 85 F (the first witness's husband), said,-I returned home from duty at about 20 minutes past 10 on Saturday night. Finding the front door open, and hearing the voice of a woman up stairs exclaiming, " Oh, save me," I ran up to the second floor landing, taking a candle from the landlady who met me on the stairs. I saw the prisonerlying on his wife, upon the lauding, just outside their own door. His left hand was upon her head, and he had a knife in his rigt hand. Before I could reach him he raised his right arm and stabbed the woman in the neck with all his force, and I saw him turn the knife round after it was in her neck. I seized him by the wrist. He still retained the handle of the knife, and as I pulled his arm away the knife came out. The candle fell, and we were all in the dark. The prisoner did not utter a word. I took him into custod ,an when I had got him to the bottom of the stairs asked him where the knife was. He replied, "'Go up and sce." Having taken him to the Bow-street station I returned directly to the house, to see to the woman, who was brought downstairs and carried to the King's College Hospital. I heard her say nothing more, except " Oh, my mother, my mother !" The prisoner was sober. MIr. HziNRY.-I observe a piece of plaster upon the prisoner's neck? Is he wounded? Witness.-I cannot say; I saw nothing of it on Saturday night. He might have got a scratch in my struggle to got the knife from him, but I was not aware of it. Inspector Mackenzie said it was a very slght surface wound.. Police-constable F 16 deposed that he found the knife in the centre of a large quantity of blood on the second-floor landing. On entering the house he saw the wife bleeding profusely from the mouth and neck. Inspector Mackenzie said this was all the evidence he wished to produce at the present stage of the inquiry. He had himself taken down a statement made to him by the wowan on Saturday night, which he could depose to, if necesary, at a fuhure examination. The woman was lying in the hospital in a very dangerous state, and the housesurgeon did not think it was likely that she would recover. Mr. HENRY asked the prisoner if he wished to make any statement now, or whether he desired to reserve his statesnent to a future time? The question was repeated to the prisoner by the gaoler, and he then said, " No, except that I was driven to it." Mr. EsNRY.-I will remand him tiU Tuesday week. The prisoner is spoken of by his employers as a steady, well-conducted man.

TnlR CArSE OF THE EXPLOSION AT LmTDnm.L - From the evidence of the eminent engineers employed to examine the pit, there is no doubt that the use of naked lghts instead of safety lamps was the proximate cause of this explosion, as also of the other two frightful explosions which occurred in the immediate neighbourhood (i.e., at the Darley Main and Oaks colieries) some few years ago. With regard to the immediate cause it is impossible to speak with the same degree of positiveness. veral possible causes are mentioned, such as the leaving open of a trap-door, the ignition of the return air at the urnace consequent on gas having been forced out of the goaves (old workings from which all the coal has been won) only 70 yards from the furnace; and the forcing of gas out of the third or fourth north goaves by the ventilating currents having beenfpartiaDy diverted from their proper courses by fallsinthe argates of the third and fourth banks. The engineers, however, believe the immediate cause of the accident to be a large fal of roof in one of the goaves under the folowing circumstances:-Immediatey above the roof of the old workingsis a strata of shaley matter, and above this a strata of rock upon which rests a thin seam of coal. The shaley strata would natura1ly fall at an early period in the extension of the goaf, and gas (which is freely emitted in the Barnsley sean), being lighter than the air, would accumulate in the cavities left by the flL The area of the goaf becoming more and more extended as the workings progressed, the strata of rock would eventually fall also. In so doing it would force out the magazine of gas which had accumulated in the cavities left by the previous fall, and would probably also bring with it an effux of gas from the thin seam of coal with which it is associated. The gas would be driven upon the candles of the miners at work in the banks surrouding the goaf, and would at once ignite. It will be recolect that Mr. Coe, the underviewer, when examined some weeks ago, accounted for the explosion on an hypothesis precisely similar to this, with the smgle exception that he supposed, not that any gas had accumulated in the cavities of the earlier fall, but that the whole of ithad comefromthe thinseamof coalabovethe strata of rock. The engineers strongly urged the necessity of lighting the pits in the Barnsley seam exclusively with safety lamps, more especially so long as they were worked upon the present faulty systemu. They also pointed out the impropriety of ailowing the packers to use safety-lamps or candles at their discretion; the danger of having single instead of double trap-doors in the main airways; of having a system of ventilation requiring so many trapdoors; and of allowing the boys who tended the trap-doors to leave them. Mr. Badger, the coroner, in his summing up strongly censured the laxity of discipline which had been allowed at the pit. He also forcibly pointed out the exteat to which the managers and officers of colieries are liable for neglect or omission of duty resulting in death, intimating t-hat if it had been clear that the explosion at Lundhill had originated in the bank of either of the obstructed airways, he should have felt bound to direct the jury to find the underviewer guiltyof crimial negligence for allowing them to be worked with naked lights. The engineers, however, while they could not speak poeitively as to the precise locality of the explosion, were of opinion that it originated not in one of the banks alluded to, but in an adjacent one. In his charge the coroner reeommended the use, in all collieries In the Barnsley district, of double trap-doors, an improved syste of ventilation, the exclusive use of safety-lam an arrangement to prevent the return air of the pits comin in conact with the furnaces, a rigid enforcement of discipline, and the adopting of means for educaing the miners. The proprietors of the Lundhill Coliery lave intimated their intention of adopting all measures secesary for the safe Working of the pit, without regard to the cost.: It is estimated that the' explosion will entail an expense of fronm 2000L to 15,000I on the proprietors, apart from the lis of i%erest on capital. ..,,tE CORRNIS FISxHERIES.-The bnuts on t\te r,p#krel fishery at St. Ives during the past week have beet ylng large quantities of fish, which were sold at Irorn 1& >-lJkner 100.

General total of all arms, 25,539. Three regiments of infantry in England will embark for reland this summer, to replace the regiments ordered on foreign service. Orders have been received at Devonport to prepare for the reception of the Grand Duke Constantine, whose attention it is expected will be speciaUy directed towards the modern machinery employed in the steam-yard at Keyham. Tho bark Francis, Captain Henry, 112 days from Swan River, was off Plymouth on Sunday. Yesterday a garrison order was issued to the whole of the troops at Chatham by Colonel Eden, the Commandant, di. recting them to asseble this day on the Lines, in review order, for the purpose of going through the manuouvrez of a field-day; after which they will fire a feut de joze in honour of Her Majests birthday. The whole of the local pensioners are also ordered to be under arms. The troops will take up their position at 11 o'clock. Orders were yesterday evening issued in Woolwich gar rison directing the commanding officers of the various regiments to assemble on Woolwich.common to-Ay in the usul review order, to be paraded in honour of the anuiver, my of Her Mbjesty's birthday, together with the whole of the enrolled Pensioners of the Woolwich and Deptford division, under the command of Colonel Forbes, Staffoffioer of Pensioners of the Woolwich division. The following are extracts from the letter of our Mtalta correspondent, dated May 20:- "The Medina steam surveying sloop, Captain Spratt, C.B., left on the 16th to take some soundings about Gozo, whence she proceeds to Cerigo, Constantinople, the months of the Danube, and the Black Sea, within which Captain Spratt will resume his surveys, having under his orders the Coquette, stationed at Constantinople, at the disposal of the British Ambamsador, Lord Stratford, and the Boxer and Weser, steam gunboats, protecting British interests at the mouths of the Danube. " On the morning of the 14th Captain Broadhead and the officers of the Brunswvick entertained Admiral Lord Lyons and the principal residents of Malta at a grand bal, the like of which had not been seen for many years. " The Dutchman screw steamer left for Gibraltar on the 34th, with a division of the 31st Regiment. " The Australian screw steamer arrived from London on the 18th. "The Adelaide screw steam transport arrived on the 19th from Deptford. " The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steam-packets Indus and Euxine arrived from Alexandria on the 13th. " The Pera, belonging to the same company, arrived from Soutbampton and Gibratar on the evening of the 12th. " The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steam-packet Vectis arrived on the 16th from Maeetles. " The Vectis left for Alexandria in company with the Per& on the 16th." Since the order has arrived at Chatham from the Horse Guards sanctioning volunteering from the depOts of the 10th and 29th Regiments to the 3d battalion of the 60th Rifles nearly 100 men of those depOts have volunteered for that corps, which is still much below its required establishment. The 3d battalion of Rifles has received orders to hold itself in readiness to embark for India. The depot remains at Dublin. The vworks in progress at Chathama dockyard for improving and enlarging the present slips and basins are in a very forward state, and it is expected that the whole will be completed during the present summer. The most important of the improvements now being carried out is that of constructing the new tidal basin, which will be 360 feet in length, and capable of reeeiving the largest vessels in the Eervice. The whole of the bottom and sides of this basin are faced with granite, laid on beds of concrete of sufficient depth to give a solid foundation. The width of the new bain is92 feet, and depth 31 feet. The lengthening of No. 7 slip inward, so as to afford room for building the large steam frigate Mersey, Is nearly completed by Messrs. Rigby, the contractors. This slip is built throughout of granite, on a bed of concrete 15 feet deep, its total length being 330 feet. The iron roof is considered a triumph of engineering skill, and has been erected and enlarged by Messrs. Grissell. AAmong the other improvements in contemplation it is proposed to scour out the mud which has been allowed to accu. mulate at:the eastern end of the yard, in order to commence the foundations for the large steam basins intended to be built. These works will be undertaken by the convicts, of whom there are about 500 at present employed in Chatham Dockyard, the sum of 160,0001. having been voted for the improvement of that dockyard, by means of convict labour alone. The new screw steamship Renown, 91 guns, was put out of No. 3 dry dock at Sheerness yesterday, and remains in the fitting basin. The Curlew, Coastguard cutter, is being broken up on the beach, at the Isle of Grain, it having been ascertained that her damage was of so extensive a nature aa not to warrant herbeing repaired, The Cun-rd steam transport Lebanon, Captain Theodore Cook, wlich vessel arrived at Woolwich on Thursday, bringing the Artillery troops from Canada, sailed from Woolwich on Sunday for Liverpool. The four companies, consisting of 15 officers and 395 non-commissioned offlcers and gunners, of the 10th battalion, were yesterday morning inspected on the Artilery-parade, facing head-quarters, by the Acting-Commandant Bloomfield, Aide-de-Camp to the Queen, and Brigade-Major Shaw, attended by the garrison staff. The voyage of the Lebanon across the Atlantic was one of the quickest and most successful on record-namely 11 days and 6 hours out from port to port,-having left Quebec on the 10th inst., at 6 am., and reached Gravesend at 5 p.m. on the 21Tt The IUnited States frigate Niagara, having been detained at Gravesend in order to make certain preliminary arrangements for shipment of her portion of the electric cable from Liverpool, is not expected to quit her present moorings antil to-morrow. The steamship Agamemnon arrived yesterday morning at Greenhithe, where she is ordered to remain until Wednesday, when she will proceed up the river and take up her moorings off Greenwich, a space having been dredged to form a basin so as to enable her to float in low tide for the embarcation of her huge cargo. On Wednesday morning a party of 50 riggers from Woolwich are ordered to make the final arrangements for her recep. tion. She is to arrive at 2 p.m. Her MaJesty's screw ship Brisk, 16 guns, Capain Curtis, from Valparaiso, came into Portland Harbour on Friday evening and left for Portsmouth next day, after taking in coal for the breakwater works. She left Valparaiso on the 21st of January, and arrived at Plymouth on the 19th inst Captain the Hon. G. F. Hastings, who is appointed to the Portland, Coastguard ship, vice Captain Boyd, is about to commence his duties Lieut<nant John Wood Rouse, RIN., of Greenwich Hospital, died on Saturday at that Royal asylum, in his 72d year. The Tacancy occasioned by his death is to be filled by Lieutenant Abraham Parks, RIN. (1815), additional lieutenant of the Saturn, Captain R, Smart, K.H., at Pembroke. The late Lieutenant Rouse entered the navy in 1799, and, after service in the Channel, joined the Royal George, loo, flagship of Admiral Sir Thomas Dackworth, and was in that ship when the Admiral passed the Dardaneules. He lost a leg in the attack upon Pro+a in Feb- rary, 1807, and his promotion to Lieutenant soon foUowed. The gaUant offlcer received a grant from the Patriotic Fand and a pension for the loss of his leg. He subsequently commanded the Pioneer on the coast of Scotland. In July. 1820, he was appointed First-Lieutenant at the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth, and in November, 1837, he was admitted to Greenwich Hospital, where for many years he was superintendent of the Royal Hospital Schools. He was deservedly esteemed by thoso acquainted with his excoellent heart and generous disposition. Captain R. S. Robinson (1840) and Captain B. J. Sulivan, C.B., have had conferred on them the good service pension3 at the disposal of the First Lord of the Admiralty by the promotion to flag rank of Captains Lapidge and Quin.

ROYAL GZOCJRAPHICAL BOCIBTY. |The anniversar meeting of thxis institution wras held yes-' terday at tha socieWs House, 15, WhithalU; Sir Roderilk L Murobison, the president, in the chair. There wa a nunicrous attendance of ldies and gentlemen on the oca. sdon, and among those present were the Biahops of Oxford, I St.Asaph's, and St.Davi's, the Right Hon.EL lAbouchere, the Earl of Sheffield, Lord Colchester, Sir G. Pollock, Sir W. F. Williams, 3Ã¯Â¿Â½P., ColonelSykes, x P., Sir IL Raw. linson, Sir G. Buak, Dr. Livingston, Mr, Cardwell, &e. The report of the Council, detailing the progres of the society during the past year, was fintzeed. From this document it appeas that within the last 12 months 173 new names have been added to the list of fellows, the total list of members now consisting of nearly 1,00. The finonces of the institution re in onrishing oondition,and its publications (which are more widely diffused than heretofore) are prsented to the libraries of the Committee of Council on -Education and to many continental societies. The map. rooms have been frequently consulted for the purpoees of scientific research, and the accessions to this depetment amount to not les than 21 atlases and 6,225 maps aud charts; while the library has been simultaneously increased by 700 volumes. The report directed particular attention to the exploring expeditions conducted by Mr. Gregory in North Australa, and by Captain Burton in East Africa, and also referred to theassitancerenderedby the Secretary, Dr. Shaw, to the Government Inspectors in the exAmin tion of lecturers in geogaphy. On the motion of the Bishop of St. AsAprH, seconded by Mr. CRAWpURD, the report was unanimouay received and ThrePRESIDENT then proceeded to deliver the societfs gold medals, which had been awarded to Colonel A. S. VIa gS,Urveyor-General of India7 for his valuable geodetical operations in that country; and to Mr. A. C, Gregory, for his extensive and important explorations in Western and Northern Australia. The Patron'sMedalwasthe one assignedtoColonel Waugh, and in the absence of the rightful recipient it was presented to Colonel Everest, his predecessor and teacher, for transmission to the gallant owner. The second eedal, that of the Founder, was next handed with due formality to MÃ¯Â¿Â½r Labouchere, Secretary of State for the Colonies, who under. took to forward it to Mr. Gregory. The P mEsIENr prefaced the latter presentation with a brief description of Mr. Gregory's expeditions and their resul, obeerving that it may now be fairly inferred that nearly all the central portion of the vast continent of Australia is an ninhabitable desert, pro. bably the dried np bottom of a sea; and that hence all inter. change between our different colonies in that region must take place either along whatmay betermed thecoast rangea, or by sea Tie united joUrneys performed by Mr. Gregory (he added) extended over 6,450 miles, and while they had determined many hitherto unknown points of latitude and longitude, they had also clearly defined the character of that fine basin of North Australia which migt at no distant day become a British colony. V. &LAuOuCsrE expressed the gratification it afforded himn to be the medium of conveying to so experienced and successful an explorer as Mr. Gregory the well-merited mark of approbation which that society had conferred upon him. Mr. Gregory had been selected by the Government for the difficult task of exploring the vast solitudes of North Austrajia, and he had discharged that duty in a manner which entitled him to the thanks of his country. The right hon. gentleman concluded by quoting A passage from a recent despatch of Sir W. Denison Governor of N6w South Wales, attnbuting the safe return of the expedition in t meuret tthe skill, intelligenoe, and firmness of Mr. Gregory. The PSmEmin,u next delivered an address on the progrees of gTogra2hical research during thepastyear. Commencing wit aueoquent and feeling tribute to the memory of the twohdoa ex-presidents of the society, Admiral Beecbey and the Earl of Ellesinere, he proceeded to pass in rapid review the Labours of geographical inquirers in allpyrts of the world. In the course of a very lengthened and interesting discourse Sir Roderick successively descanted upon M. Kieghorn's theory of the wear and tear of our coasts, the projected Transatlantic telegraph, the discoveries of Dr. Lvmgstone and Dr. Barth in Africa, the prorzve final Actic search, and various cognate topics, winding up his address with a reference to the growingnutility and acknowr- leged importance of that society, and to the inadequacy of its paresent accommodation for it steadily increasing President for his able address, and the motion, having been d_uly seconded by RLear-Admire! Sir G. BACK, was carried by acclamation. Sir B. Murchison was then reelected President for the ensuing year, and, the members of the Council having also been appointed, the meeting then separated. The anniversary was celebrated by a dinner at the Freemasons' Tasvern, Great Queen.st;reet, in the evening. Sir Roderick hiurchison again occupied the chair, and wras supported by many of the leading members of the esocety. In responding to the toast of " Prosperity to the Rnoyal Geographical Society," Sir If. Rav;iinon cited his own case as an example of the incntive which the medals of t9at institution heldout to travellers and geographers to distinguish themselves, and also commented upon the fact that while all the other scientific societies of the metropolis were deploring the falling off in their members and their subscription listb, that institution was threatened with an absolute plethora of prosperity. "Success to the projected final search for Sir John Fran. an," and the " EIealth of the explorers of distant regions," were also drank with great enthusiasm and severally acknowledged by Captain huClintock and Dr. Livingston. The Chairman's halth was proposed by Mr. Card,ell, and received with the utmost cordiality. Mr. C.

Sir,-In an extract in T2c Times of to-day from the Observer it is said that the water supplying the newlydiscovered spring in St. James's Park "evidently oomes from the Thatea, being filtered in its passage through a bed of snd two-thirds of mile in thickness."; I suspect that this is an incorrect assnmption, and that the water comes from the Nottinghill direction, being penned back by the water in the Thames from escaping below the level (for the time) of the tide. This was the opinion of the late Dr. Bucldand. The point is one of importanco for Sir B. HIl's oonsideration, for, having so far carried out Mr. Chadwick's plans of 1848 for the purification of the ornamental waters in the parks, there can be no doubt, I hope, that he will do with the Serpentine the like of what he is doing with "the Canal" in St. James's Park. If so, the question will be, 'whence the water for the Serpentine will be obtainable and that I expect, will lead to the carng out of Mr. Chadwickes plan of procuring it by draining Kensington.gardens and Hyde If Sir B. Hal will avail himself of tho information on hes sbjts whie can obtain in the records of the e CSewer it may save him e auch tronbie. ~~~YOnrobemlentlv. X. R -J ~lp

LORD EBRINGTON.-On Saturday, at the meeting of the Mw7lebone Representative Council, Lord Ebrngton made his aPerance, and was very cordially received. Havig ap ogzed or nterpting the business, he said he could not retUrn to England without taking the earliest opportutity to expres, through the vestry of Marylebone, his thanks and sense of gratitucde to thecntituencyfor re-electing him in the handsome manner he7haddon dring his absenoe, and fur the for.' beerncethe ha shwn to him during a long and trying illness Hte entreated the electors not to identify him with izte Ã¯Â¿Â½nio r measures of which he had not expressed himelfinfavur.Hi health was now so much imiproved hat he hoped to be enabled to give his best attention to the important t jes confided to him as the representative of at great borongh, and generally as a member of Parlia3nent. Sir James Hamilton replied that he was only expressng the feelings of the entire body of the vestry, as we, as his Own, when he said they were highly gatified at seeing Lord Ebrington restored to something like his usual state of health, and again able to resume his duties.

The moment our boat reahed the ship Captain EAinhtonleaped ozto to the main chiaos, and in a send was on boardin time toorder all the passengers forward immediately, forthe flaam, wero ruaAng up the skylights and out of the caddydedoo, so,, that in a few minutes their retreat would have been out oT entirely, The fire was discovered by the captainsltle, hiM black servant, Caesim, who with the steward, got down the.- companion batch into the store, andwasengagedin zexrc,;,, f,r the sourceof th e smokewhen the aiarm became generaL Mr. Vaughan, the sond officer, had joined them in search, and at length discoered the fanmes along the sgipside close to the gun deck, For nomie time every one iCc sidered that the buckets of water which were freely ad,.- ministered would nubdue theb,e, and no very grear t alr,. was felt at first; but a fe minutes served to dispel this_ illusion. Mr. Stokes, the chief officer, who in the captain's. absence had the command of the ship, seeing the incredt danger, gave orders for all hands that could be spared from_. the working of the ship to apen the maagazin an throw the gunpowder overboard. We. ero alB i (. assenger) rushed to his cabin for an axe, which was of considerable use in taring UP the hatchway. The, third officer, Mr. Pye, got to his cabin, where three barreboe of powder had been stowed for wat of room, and tese with the remaining 249 baels in the magazine under the, anin hatchway, were handed from hand to hand and throwmi, oveboard. The fire had disappeared from the Wtr.omm as son as the main hatchwayw as opened; there being the r anew and greater drfauht, the fire u wasaking rapid stride. to this deadfly mine, chred with about 18 tons of gunpowder. At h.lte srower tier of barrels oas a-e tualy hot-almost too hot to hold, This was no fancY, every man was intent upon his work. Thes weminutes of agonizing suspense. The weaker seX neverseemed to have lost their prenoe of mind, und it wa.z a remerk of admiration made subsequently by the crew thatS. not a scream was heard from any one. The stoeard, Alfre& Marsih, acted with great bravery and devotion; three times hmade hi1s wa-y through the dense smoke into the caddy to'the cabinpt the ster, and aved thecaptain's chronot etep desk, watch, and other valuables. Cassim, the black ar. vent, al got through the euddy into the r Abks to h a sovemse Of his mlaster's things, but his retat was cut off by thwincreading smoke ana flame, ands he was drawn up half- suffocated, tlxough the quarter gallery window on to the.- POOP, The pinnaoe being lowered, the captn stooto guard and saw all the women and childrenhanded down before he admitted others to jump in. to make up her complement. The remainder of those-- On board escaped by the lifeboat, in which the captain hgA rsturned from the island. The satisfaction that was feltp when the lRst barrel of gunpowder went overboar gve anll on board that comparative coolnes andbeBief that tbeworyst, wae Past, without which feelingin all prombability ma ny loet. would have been sacrificed. After all the crew were in theboat the captain had a stbrggle to get a agrea Nwfoundlanl og f h over the ship's side, but, finding it imnpo * sa ibleahseizd rope and swung off into the boat. He was. the last to leave tAe ship. She had an, im- ens quantity of spirita ont board-in fact, them great bulk of her cago was brandy and gin-Whicp, counta for the extraordinay rapidity of the ignition.i From the time of the first alarm to the time of leavng the ship an hour had not elapsed, and as we cleared hf the, fampes rushed UP ti all directionsr The gig, which ha&. put off with five boys, wasz lost sight of, but we neared tbev tinnaet, and were hailed to lighten her of some of herfreight. for the w iter was fast gaining upon them, and th had little room to work their oar We got alongside, s:lI took Mrs. Elmston and two women into our boat which made up our number to 30, I had only time to hail my wife andt child and tel her to be or.0 good courage wh en the boats parted, and dark. nels completed our separation. On turning our eyes tcthe uning ship we saw the fire run up her newrigging witb innumerable flickering jets, like sbriIant gas illumination, and her imain and mizen mnasts went over the side with a fearful crash. The foremabs ad bowsprit stood a short time longer.

Our getfear all night was that the gig with the boys, theeldes only 20 and the youngest 9, must have been lost - hut in the course of the morning, to our great joy, we foun& both pinnace and gig had come ashore on a sandy beach,' The island Tristan d'Acunba, is in long. 11L43 W., lat. i7TS B., about 15 miles in circumference, and some 1.500 mileg from the nearest land. From March until October a ship near the latitude of the islaLnd Is a rare sight. A few clays previous to the loss of the Joseph S,~omes the inhabitants oEthe island had beeu considerably lessenedl by 50 of them, accompanied by their pastor, the Rev. W. Taylor, leaving. the settlement in Her Majestys shi Geyser, for the Cape. Although the islanders left digd all the7 couli to relieve the wants of the shipwrecked people, their small supply of provisions gave them but a very inadequate fare,and for nine days they endured considerable privation. On. Friday, March 6, a ship was descried to the leeward. A sig. nn'l of distress was hoised on a. prominent point of the islanld, and the sail came so near that they were enabled to read her name on the stern, "1Lydia." It was thought; she was bound to Bombay. Instead, however, of her heavingtoo, she bore away on her voyage. On the same day providentially (for the circumstaLneeof two vessels comingnear theisland so close after esehliotherwas almost unheard of among the settlers), another ship bore in view. She proved to bethe Nlimroud, Captain H. Tilman, from London, for Kur. rachee. Seeing' he bat that haad giveni chase after theLYdia she bore down to it, and received Captain Elmston anc! one passenger on board. Captain Tilman, on learning their sad tale, at once, without the least hesitation, offeredl to take the whole of the shxipwrecked peiople on board. TheNimnrua was brought to and received the passngers mld crew on board, and. having gone several hundred miles n of her course, safely landed the whole of those belongin~ the Joseph Somesait Table Bay on the 20th of March, whim the Glovernment authorities took charge of them, and a. ublic subscription was oyened for their relief. Captain. EMnston attributes thxe fire to spontaneous combustiom among the cargo. The ship is understoodl to he insured.
THE BAAxÃ¯Â¿Â½ AT .PL3Y3oUTH, May 25.-Thw oompletion of the Ramazan, or great Ahommedar, fast month, has been tho subject of much rejoicing or. board the Turkish line-of-battle ship Peiki Zaffer, 104, Cap. tain Ismael Boy, now in the Sound. A Royal Slute ofEl guns announced, at 5 o'clock on Saturdayafternoon, theapproach of the nev moon, and at 9 o'cock its appear ance ws reeted by tho illutmination of the ship, everyt port exhibiting a light, and fireworks of a varied character being displayed fron her masts nd rigging. Thoa fast over and all restrictions removed the crew were soom seated on the docks devouring their siumple but muchcoveted pilan, with other condiments. Yesterda y(Sunday). mr ning was the commencement of the lesser Bairam, or fe.montb, when full amends aro made for the previotw. mortfication. Royal salutes were giveu at 6 o'clock in the morning, at 12, and at 5 in the afternoon, and the ship wa gaily dressed in colours from yardarm to yardarm, thw crescent and the star occupying the most honoured positions. Although eating and drinking appeared to be the most important feature of the day's proceedings sobrietyand good fellowship were strictly maintained. and a swing by a single rope fixed to the foremast head seernedt to afford the greatest amount of happiness to "Conea Johnny," especiaUy whea he could induce one or twoof his shipmates to joininthe innooentamusement. 1m consequence of the loss of some of the Turkish fleet. early m the war the officers belonging to those ships La-e been appointed aupernumerarleson boardthe remaindernand,. notwithstanding this redundancyand the compatiavelr idle life led by the crow during the eight months whiehhbve. been spent at Plymouth in fitting machiner to the Pelk Zaffer, the deportment of the officers and the conduct or the men have been Tery exemplary, and the absenoe oLt the owners of the Ttirkish unifonn quietly and 2nobtr_ sisely passing through the streets will be felt fte the, departure of the ship. Under the auperintendence et Mra Thompson, the Queen'sHarbourmaster, the ship istobefittej with compsses adapted to any deviation which may lave, been caused by the introduction of the steasnengine, shaft, and screw.
