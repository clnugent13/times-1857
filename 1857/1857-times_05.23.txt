THZ ROYAL AgrOULTURA SOcIZTY oF, ENGLAND. A generalmeeling of the membeN of thie society was held yesterdayat their room, 12, anover-square, for the purpose of electing the preeldent, Tioe-presidents, trustees, silla other offioers of the society for the ensuing year. Mr. W. Miles, M.P., in the unavoidable absence of the Right Hon. J. E. Denison, Spueker of the House of Commons, President, took the chair. There was a very ful attendance of members; and on the motion of Mr. Barrow, 31.P., seconded by Mr. Milward, Lord Berners was unanimously elected president for the ensuing sembly of the society at Salisbury, and during the year. The vice-presidents, trnstee, and council were then re-elected. Mr. J. HuDsoN (secretay) read the report, which stated that the society oonsisted at the present time of 5,068 members, being an increase of 89 names since the last anniversary meeting. The invested cxpital of the society was 9,264 8s. lld, in the New Three per Cents., and the current cash balance was 1,087h. The reRort also stated that the con. sulting chymist was engaged in investigations on the solability of subetanm in the soil supplying a nourishment to plants- and that the council had again to record their sense of the Earl of Clarendon's interest in promotlhvg the objects of the society, by obtaining from the Ministers and Consuls abroad not only information on the occurrence of guano and other manuring substances, but also dotails connected with- the progress of pleuro-pneumonia and conts. gious typhus among the cattle in different parts of Europe. The council having received from the Boyal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland a suggestion that it would be desirable for the three agricaltural societies of tho United Kingdom to unite in the oommon object of, despatching abroxd a special veterinary inspector, for the purpore of ascertaining the exact nature of the contagious typhIus, they at once. concurred with the Highland and Agri. cultural Society of Scotland in adopting that sug- ation andon the 9th of last month Professor Simond, uranishedw_th acircular letter from the Earl of Clarendon to tho several consuls of Europe, left England as the veterinary inspector of the three national societies, anid on the 30th forwarded his first communication, in which he reported that he found to a, great extent that the pleuropneumonia had boen mistaken for the severer mlady of contagous typhus; andthat hohad topenetrateinto Poland itelf m order to meet with cases that might furnish evidences for his study and report. He expressed his firm opinion that there was at present no fear of the contagious typhus being introduced into this country by means of living anin, whatever danger might arise from the importation of hides or other integUIentary portions of shughtered cattle. The arrangements for the Sslisbury meeting were proceeding satisfactorily. Next year thoe meeting will be at Chester, and in 1860 the district would combine the countes of Kent andSurrey. The late Chelmsford meeting was most sueeeasaul, but in a financial point of view most expensive of any meeting hitherto held. Means were being taken to reduce the expenditure, at the same time maintaining the efficiency of their meetings. Mr. HoBns, in reference to that part of the report which stated the expenses of the Chelmsford meeting to have beeix excessive, explained that in former years the premiums were paid out of the general income of the society, but that at the Chelmsford meeting the premiums for implements and cattle were paid out of the receipts at the showyard. Mr. T. IL BAiucER, chairman of the finance committee, then read the half-yearly account, from the 1st of July to the 31st of December, 1856, showing that cash in hand and receipts amounted to 7,6921. IOs. Sd., and that the payments armounted to 7,6751. 9s., leaving in the hands of the secretary as pewyea h balance 171. Is. 8d. Tlhe CEumRAx s id, Although it was not competent for tlse meeting to adopt anynew regulations, yet it was onen to any gentleman to make suestions for the consideration of the counciL It had been thrown out elsewhere that the society might be much better employed than they hitherto had been; now, therefore, was the time for any member who had suggestionsto make to bring them forward, Mr. FPxiz would avail himself of tho invitation of the chairman, and humbly suggest that a consulting botaniLt ought to be appointed bythe society. They had a veterinary professor and a chymical proFessor, but they had no one to whom they could refer as to tbe nature and habits of a weed, or the variety in the formation of a flower or a The CEAIRmNt said, although no professor of botany was appointed by the society, nevertheless the habits of weeids ngeneraliwasabsubject frequeutly discossed in the pages of tse publication of the soc.iety. Thc suggestion, howvever, was one wrhich no doubt wrould receive attention from the council. After some conversation as to the expediency of more extensively advertising the prizes, and also the time and place of the meetings of the society, a vote of thanks to the chairman was proposed by Lord Berners, seconded by Sir J. V. Shelley, and carried unanimously. The C1ILAIR, in acknowledging the compliment, took the epportanity of adverting to the very great service which had bn rendered to agriculture by their late president, the Speaker of the House of Commons, not only In this country, but also in France. That right hon. gentleman was chiefly instrumental in obtaining an. alteration in the French tariff in regard to the importation into thatcountry of agricultaral implements, the consequence of which had been the introduction into France of some of the best English-mde implements, to the advantago of all parties. 'le 'ongratulated the meetin'g on the large accession which had been made to their numbers.dnring the past year, and declared his belief, notwithstanding the gloomy rumours that had gone forth of their retrogradiug, instead of progre6;ing, that the Boyal Agricultural Society of England stOOd thigh and well In the estimation of the public. The meeting then broke up.

From the bilance of 3,509o is de ducted 2,9131. for interest on Government loan-and debea. tnres, leaving 5951. Owing to a reduction in rates for carrages, which was found necessary, in order to compete with an opposing oompany, the directors regret to find! that the traffic receipts have not increased to the extent that would otherwise have been the case; but: arrangemen's are now concluded which have obviated the necessity of competition, and the rates have becen raisedc to the original standard. The joint accounts between this company and the Waterford and Limerick Concpany are in course of settlement. The sumn of 1,5804- has been paid ort account of the accident at Dnnlktt. The directors do not; recommend the removal of the chief offices of the company from England to Ireland. A resolution to confir n the forfeiture of 137 original shares for non-payment of call3 will be submitted to the proprietors. The report of Mr. Errington, the engineer, states that since November last the 19 miles on the Waterford and Kilkeuny districts of tha ralway have been completed. The permanent way generally is nowv in a very satisfactory state, and the rolling stock is in good working order. Theauditors, Messrs. Webster ant Brushnfeld, report that they have carefuUy and thoroughla examined the original and preference sha. 3 accounts, the borrowed capital accounts, registers, and ledgers, and that; they are in every respect correct. They add that the system. of accounts, condition of the books, and ger.eral office arrangements reflect very great credit upon Mr. Parker, the secretary. The capital account shows tbat the com. pany is authorizd to raise 599,000L, of -which 44.5,7481. has Ien raised oa shares, and 1.32,680!. on loan, leaving power to raise 4,2511. on shares and 16,3191 on loan.

CHURCH EXTENSION AT*BRISTOL.-A new church is shortly to be commenced neXr the Bath-brldgo, in the city of BristoL This undertaking originates with several wealthy members of the Evangelical Church, one of whom contributes 1,0001. The extonsion of the present church accommodation at Cliftos is much needed, and either a large addition must bemadeto the present edificesor a new church must be erected. This latter is deemed the most likely plan. Inthe suburbs of Bristol, atPill, a new church and parsonage are to be built at the mouth of the river Avon. For this purpose Pil is to be made a distinct district for ecclesiastical uroses. An edifice to hold 500 persons is to be built, the land for the site and parsonage and 1,0001. towards endow. ment having been already provided. A new church was also consecrated at Stapleton a short time ago. THn COMET.-That a comet of unusual maonitude and splendour may about the present period be expected to visit the regions of space through which the earth moves has long been well known, and its approach, while looked for with great interest by the scientific world, has caused considerable anpprehension in many quarters, and in some places where there should be sufficient knowledge of natural phenomena to have prevented such apprehensions being entertained, it has been confi. dently predicted that the end of all thin"s is at hand, and that on some day in June next-the 13th, we believe-the world, with all that it contains, is to perish. This is by no means the first time that such a prediction has been heard. In 1832 it was calculated that a little before midnight on the 29th of October a comet would cross the plane in which the earth revolves, near the point whore our globe Itself would be on the morning of the 30th of November, and had the comet been delayed a month by any disturbance a collision with its nebulosity would have taken place. The alarm was then chiefly confined to the rarisians, who seem to be addicted to such fears, and it was in Paris the existing alarm about the now expected comet first prevailed. A similar alarm existed in France in 1773, and one of the philosophers of that country was employed by the Government to allay the fears of the people. Some weakminded people died of fright, and some, scarcely less waakminded, purchased places in Paradise at high Dnices. There is nothing on record to justify the belief that the earth has ever suffered injury from a comet, nothing to lead to the supposition that it is ever likely so to suffer * but, on the contrary, there are good reasons for believing that conmetary influence has been in some instances beneficiaL Wine drinkers have not forgotten the " comet wine," some of which may yet be had "for a consideration;" this was grown in 1811, wben a comet was visible, and when the yield of the earth's productions was more than usually abundant and the quality extraordinary. So it may be again, and that which is now in some quarters regarded with terror is not unlikely, if it should have a inauence upon the earth at all, to have one which should be regarded with satisfaction rather than with alarm. Taking advantage of theo interest now very generally manifested onx the approach of the celebrated celestial stranger, and especially of the fears of the uninformed multitude, some unprincipled pub. lishers have issued mischievous pamphles containing a very small modicum of astronomaical truth anid a, monstrous amount of trash, calculated to increse rather than a the alarm which has been excited by the prophets of evii Other publ'u ;ions have been called forth to atify public curiosity which are of a maore reasonable chaactr, but they mostly bear the catch-penny stamp upon them. It is pretty certain that the Ereat majority of comets, and probably all of them, are enitirely gaseougs..iMple collections of vapour. The comet of 1770 passed twice through the system of Jupiter, yet- there was not the slightest &. rangement of his mnoons caused by this intrusion. Should an instance of actual contact occur, there seems no maore reason to infer convulsion from the attack of a gaseous body than in the case of a squadronL of clouds striking the top of a maountain. " In all probability," says Mlner, " the only effect would be a change of temperature, with some peculiar atmospheric phenomena, yet compatible with a. full security to human life and happiness. -Banbu iyi Guardian. FAILURE or' THE MAiwE LAw IN AmERct._ Mr. Joseph Barker, who for so many years advocated temnperance and the Maine Law, and who emigrmted to Anmerica seven years ago, and who is so well-known as a sincere friend to all moral and socia reform, has addressed a letter to Mr. S.

PARLLIMENTA1Y INTELLIGENCE. EOUSE OF LORlDS, FptmDY, MY 22. The IolsinD COHACPLLoH took hiW seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock. SWEARENG WITNESSES. Lord CAMPBELL brought up the report of the committee appointed to consider the present mode of swearing witnesses at the bar of the Honse. The committee had unanimously resolved to propose no alteration in the present system, but recommonded that upon matters of opinion witnesses should not be required to depose upon oath. The LORD CHANCELLOR presented a petition from Mr. Wiltshire, who had been appointed a magistrate for Hertfordshire, but had never qualHfied, as he found it impossible to subscribe to that portion of the oath of abjuration which declares that no foreign prince, potentate, or prelate bath or ought to have power within this realn, as he could not conscientiously declare that the Pope of Rome had no power in this country. Lord EGLINTON presented a petition from civil servants in the post-office of Edinburgh, praying for an alteration in the Civil Service Saperannuation Act. The Earl of MALMESBURY presented a petition from civil servants employed in the Isle of Wight to the same effect. The Duke of RICHMOND also presented several petitions to a similar effect. The noble duke expressed his surprise at the injustice which appeared to have been infficted upon the civil servants of the Crow, and said that if no other peer brought the matter under the notice of the House he shoald move for a select committee to inquire into the subject. Earl GRANVILLE observed that the commission which had been appointed last autumn had completod their labours, and their report was now in the hands of the printer. DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILl1 The Duke of NORFOLK gave notice that upon the motion for going into committee upon this Bill he should move that it be referred to a select committee. TEiE REPORT ON MLITARY EDUCATION. Lord PANURE.-I wish, my lords, to take the present opportunity of stating that I think some mistake, which I do not clearly comprehend, has got abroad with respect to the report of the commissioners on military education. In another place, and also in the public press, the Government and myself have been accused of endeavouring to ",burke" or suppress that reporL It would be impossible, my lords, to advance a more groundless or, let me add, a more malevo. lent 2nsinuation. WVhen the commissioners were appointed the greatest pains were taken to let the public know that the duty assigned to them by me was to elicit faots illustrative of the system of military education in all the countries of Europe, with the view of guiding the Government and the military authorities in arrarging some plan of education for the officers of our army. The commissioners finished their inquiry in July last, and, so far from our attempting to ",burke" or suppress the result of their labourn, my right hon. friend Mr. Monell informed the House of Commons, by means of a minuto which he laid on the table, that the commissioners had returned and were in the act of preparing their report, to which we intended to give publicity. That report was made. It was very volu. minous, and in the first instance was presented to me for my persal. It was then sent to the Messrs. Spottiswoode, the gentlemen who print for the War Department, and also for your lordships, and when it was putin type a certain number of copies were printed and distributed among your lordships. I had 300 copies thrown off which I sent to the House of Commons, 150 to be given to such members as might particularly desire to have them, and 150 to be placed in the library, where all the members would have access to them. I adopted that course because Idid not wish toincur the expense ofprintinganunnecessarilylargenumber of copies, andbecauseI knew that notaboveone-fourthof the meombers of the Houao of Commons would care to read a bulky blue-book upon such a subject. My desire for economy has been turned against me, and I am blamed for not having printed the report, although I put it where every member who chose might see it. That report, my lords, is well worthy your attention. The commissioners go rather beyond their instructions, and I do not pledge myself to subscrite to all the opinions they have expressed; but I mut say that their report is one of the most able documents which I have seen upon the subject. It comprises in a very clear form accounts of all the systems of military education abroad, and I hope will receive from your lordships, and from the mnem. bersof theotherHousoofParliament, anattentive and careful prusal. I may state, in addition, that the Commander-ihChief and myself have been in communication for the purpose of establishing a system of education for the officers of the army. We have almost arrived at a conclusion upon the subject. A system has been sketched out which I hope we shaU soon be able to promulgate; and your lordships may be assured that no time shall be lost in carrying into practical operation that which is a great desice-atium in our army-viz., a scheme for affording to our officers the means of acquiring the information requisite to fit them for staff and other appointments, rendering them as distin. guished for their professional and technical knowledge as they had already proved themselves to be for their courage and gallantry in the field. [The uoblelord,who rose amidthe noise and bustle occasioned by the presentation of petitions, and who spoke in an unusnaUy low tone, was very indistinctly heard in the galery, and parts of some of h:s sentences were entirely lost.] THE LORD-LIEUTENANT AND TEE DUBLIN PROTESTANT ASSOCIATION. Viscount DUNGANNON rose to move for the produc. tion of the correspondence which passed during the last month between the Lord-Lieutenant and the Dublin Pro. testant Association. There existed a large Protestant school in one of the quarters of Dublin where a number of persons of both sexes attended in order to render their gratuitous assistance in the education of the children. During the latter part of March and the beginning of April last Catholic mobs surrounded the building, insultng and iU-treating all who entered or left it. Moreover, it could be provedthat several policemen who witnessed the disturbances not only refused to take any part to-wards suppressing them, but actually encouraged the mobs to assault persons of respectability and station. Upon one occasion, when two policemen met a body of women who were followed and pelted by a Roman Catholic mob, and who entreated their assistance, thev were not content with dechning to interfere, but stimulated the assailants to fresh violenee. In consequence of these repeated outrages the Dublin Protestant Association-a body with which he had never been connected in any way whatever, but which he knew to be composed of persons of the first rank, property, and respectability in Ireland-a body both loyal and constitutional in its principles, and onded not for aggressive, but defensive purposes-thought fit to memorialize the Lord-Lieutenant. They stated that persons who faithfully adhered to the Protestant doctrines were apparently unable to procure proper protection from the Executive. The reply received was to the effect that, although his Excellency had never distinctly recognized such a body as the Protestant Association, yet he had been in the habit of receiving any appeals or persons that came to him from it, but that on the present occasion the me3moriahsts had made use of expressions which were insultin both to him and to his predecessorsinoffice-infact, theyhad cast a reflection upon the Executive Government in Ireland. Thereupon the association, in a second communication to the Lord-Lieutenant, repudiated any desire to show disrespect to his Excellencyor to any of the persons composing the Executive, and repeated their previous complaints. A further reply came from the Lord-Lieutenant to state that he considered the association had withdrawn its offensive expre8sions. He was at a less to understand what there was for the assoCiation to withdrhaw, and he had yet to learn there was anything offensive in the expression of an opinion borne out by facts, that Protestants did not receive a fair share of protection. The day would come when it would of to lknger d ssble to turn a deaf ear to complaints nd ti his was not an isolated instance. These disgraceful outrages were of repeated occurrence, and were encouraged by Roman Catholic priests and the masters of national schools. 'Under these circumstances he trusted the Government would not oppose the motion he bad now to submit, that the correspondeVee which had passed between the Dnblin Protestant Association and the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in the month of April last be laid upon the table of their lordships' House. Earl GRANVILLE said he would agree to the motion. and their lordships would then be abieto judgeof theinerits of the correspondence. The motion was agreed to. PROBATES AND LETTERS OF ADMNISTRATION BILL. The House then went into committee on this Bil. Clause 1 was agreed to. Upon clause 2, Lord ST. LEONARD'S moved an amendment, the object of which and of other amendments which he intended subsequently to move was to withdrawv from the jurisdiction nder tis Bill all real estates. They were all agreed that the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts should be transferred to this new conrt, but the Ecclesiastical Couts never had jurisdiction over real estate. Their lordships' hUe1.~. to property did not depend on the Ecclesiastical outu They required no power from any court to enable them to inherit the estates of their ancestors, and they wanted no power to enable them to devise their estates, where they had a devisable interest. There never had been any ground why real property should be brought under the jursdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and why should it now be brought under the jurisdiction of that court which 9a simPle substitution for the Ecclesiastical Courts ? It was said by persons extremelv fond of u iformity that there was an anomaly in the valfdity of a wi being decided by a judge sitting in the Eclesiastical Court as far as regarded personalty, and by a jury as far as regarded realty ; that the jury might come to the conclusion that the will vas valid, and the judge come to the conclusion that it was in- valid; and that they might thus have two opposite conclu. sions by competent jurisdictions with respect to the same instrument. He believed that no one could quote two such instances witbin the recollectionof anyman What he (Lord St. Leonard's) would advise their lordships to do was to leave the law as it affected real estate as it was at present. He would urge nion their lordships the duty of maintaining untouched by t hb B Dl the rights and immu. nities incident to their own estates and the rights and immunities of every landed gentleman in the kingdom; and he would especially caution them against any attempt that might be made to saddle the owners of real estate with pro. bate duty in the way in which they had been already sibjecled to a succession duty. He Imight remind their lord- ships that when a former Bill o noble and learned friend' g 'the Lord Chancellor) on this subject went before a oommitsre upstairs that very question, whether 'or not real esb,3te should or should not be liable to probate, was mnost Attentively oonsidet4 and di3- ldr cussud, and that a majority of the committee decide I that real estate should Dot be made the subjece of probete. It was true the present Bill did not propose to subject real estate to probate, but there were saveral clauses in it which broug' t real estate within the jurisdiction of the new court, and whenever there was a contest as to a wi the Bill enabled the heir-at-law, or the devisee of the real estate, to appear a; aparty in such contest. To that ropesition he was entirely opposed, and he rapeated that t law of England as to real estate required no alteration. HIe therefore again caUed upon their ordEhips to leave the law precisely as it stood at present, and to assimilate the Bill in respect to real estate to the one which had been so attentively considered by the committee upstairs The LORD CHANCELLOR said it did not occur to hira that the motioa of his noble and learned friend pronerly raised the question which his noble and learned friend had brougt under the consideratioa of the committee, but he (theLord Chancellor) was nevertheless willing that that question should he raised at once. That question was whether or not to the extent to which this Bill affected real estate it ouht to affect it. With regard to the merits of this point he owned that at a portion of his noble and learned friend's address he felt somewhat annoyed. He certainly did not like the sort of argumentura ad landowner used by his noble and learned friend, by which he appealed to the larjded interest in the country as distinct from the general interests of the community. Now what did this Bill propose with reference to real estateo? The Chancery Commissioners, in their report pub. lished in 1854, recommended that there should be oue jurisdiction for real and personal estate, and that probate should extend to aU property of every description. He acted upon that suggeston when he introduced a BML on this subject in 1854; hut during the discussions in the select committee to which the Bill was referred the general opinion seemed to be that the alterationwould be attendedwithinconvenience, and he therefore confined the measure to personal estate. The Bil passed their lordships' House in that form, but it did not pass the House of Commons. In 1855 and 1856 measure with the object of improving the testamenta7 jurisdiction were originated in the other House; but as it was the opinion of his colleagues that it was advisable he should introduce a similar Bill into their lordships? House this year, he had moet attentively reconsidered the whole sub ect, and he had satisfied himself that it would not be desrable to act upon the recomMendations of the commissioners with respect to reel property, and that the same necessity did not exist for probate of real estate that there was for probate of personal estate. In the case of personal estate it was necessary to have some. body to represent the deceased, and probate with regard to that description of propr was therefore absolutely ieq-q. site; but he did not think any such necessity existed with respect to real estate. There was howeverthis extraordinary anomaly, that although, when a will had been proved as to personal estate, the title of the executor was established to every particle of tho personal property, yet, inasmuch as probate did not extend to real estate, the question which had been decided as to personal estafe might, according to the existing law, be reopened with regard to the real estate. Eis noble and learned friend had said that these cases were of very rare occurrence. That was true; but stil he (the Lord Chancellor) had considered that when he was pro. posing a measure for the improvement of testmentary jurisdiction, hewouldbewanting in his duty if he did not recommend what he thought was a very simple and easy mode of remedying the existing anomaly. What he proposedwas, not that probate should berequired with regard to real estate in cases where wills were undisputed, but that if a wMi werel,disputed upon the ground that the testator was insane, or for any cause which applied to the whole will, all the persons interested under such will should be cited, and should have the matter settled once and for alL He could not conceive what possible objection there conld be to such a course. His noble and learned friend had said that cases of the kind referred to were of rare occurrence. So they were, but since he (the Lord Chancellor) had had the honour of holding the great seal the very question had aisen, and in a case of no small importance. In 1842 a gentleman died at Cheltenham who had made a wil by which be bequeathed all his property of every description to his widow. The widow proved the will, which was a good probate as to the personal estate, and in virtue of such probate she obtained personal property in the funds, and of other descriptions, to the value of 150,0001. The deceased was also the owner in fee simple of very large estates in Ireland, producing 7,0001. or 8,0001. a-year; but after the widow had been in possession of those estates for some little time proceedmigs were instituted by the heir at law for their recovery. A trial took place, and the jury found that the testator was insane at the time he made the will. The subject was brought by appeal before the House of Lords, and was argued very fully and ably at the bar. He had occasion to consider the case without the assistance of any of their lordships. He thought himself disentitled to look at what had been done with regard to probate, but he came to the conclusion upon other grounds that the trial had not been satisfactory, and he therefore reversed the decision of the Irsh court and directed that a new trial should take place. The same result might follow from a new trial, but he mentioned this case to sbow the presnt anomalous state of the law, and he thought he should have been deservedly obnoxious to the chargA of adhering too nigidiy to precedent ii' he had not endeavored to obviate such an inconvenience. The Bill would not involve the necessity of probate of real estate in ordinary cases, but he proposed that when there was a contest probate should be conclusive beth as to real and personal estate. The committee then divided. The numbers were For the amendment ... ... 35 Against it . .. 56 Mfajority -21 The clause was then agreed to, as were also clauses 3' and 4. On clause 5, Lord 1VYNFORD observed that, on the previous discussion on this Bill, the noble and learned lord (the Lord Chancellor) had represented that it was the opinion of Dr. Lushington that one judge would be sufficient for aU the duties-Admiralty, matrimonial, and probate. He was informed, however, that that learned gentleman had said that bis opinion had been modified since the Period when he gave his evidence some years ago, and, considering the increase of business which had taken place in the Admiralty Court, and the probabtity of further increase of business after the alteration of the present system, he was inclined to think that one judge would not be adequate for the purpose. He, therefore, wished to know whether it was intended to leave the present clause as it now stood ? A great part of the present business was conducted by paper out of court, but if hereafter it should be conducted z-iv soce the more frequent ttendance of the judge in court would be rendered necessary, and, considering that the attendance of the Judge would also be required at the Judicil Committee of the Privy Council, he hardly thought that the services of one judge would be sufficient. The LORD CEHANCELLOR was afraid that he had unintentionally gone beyond what his learned friend authorized him to say. He had a conversation with him about a fortnight ago, and was then told by him that 20 years ago he was examined before a committee of the House of Commons, and gave his opinion that one judge could do the business, but that since then the business of the Admiralty Court had no doubt increased, and that he could not now feel the same confidence that one judge would be sufficient. Instead of representing the leaning of the opinion of that learned person to be now that one judge could do the whole business, be thought he must state that the learned gentleman was inclined to think, without exuressing a confident opinion on the point, that one judge woiuld not be sufficient. lt was, however, unnecessary to make any alteration in the present clause. The clause was then agreed to. Clauses 6 to 22 inclusive were also agreed to with some amendments. Upon clause 23, which provides that the Court shall have throughout all Bngland the same powers as the Prerogative Court within the province of Canterbury, Lord ST. LEONARD'S asked whether one Bill might not be introduced to apply to the whole of the kingdom? Why should Ireland be excluded from the advantage of such a measure? Lord CAMPBELL claimed justice for Scotland also. Surely his noble friend, with the assistanee of the LordAdvocate, might devise some scheme to make the law with regard to probates and letters of administrationuniform throughout the whole kingdom. The LORD CEANCELLOR acknowledgedtbedesirabiity of such a measure, but said that he did not yet propose to make probates everywhere interchangeable. They would first make this Bill perfect for England, after which there would be no difficulty In framing an Act to extend to Scotland and Ireland. The clause was then agreed to. Clauses 24 to 36 were also agreed to. On clause 37, Lord ST. LEONARD'S proposed an amendment, making the apjeal to the House of Lords instead of the Privy Lord CAMPBELL supported the amendment, and The LORD CHANCELLOR having expressed his willingnoes to accept it, The clause as thus amended was agreed to. Clause 38 was also agreed to. The clauses up to clause 95 were then agreed to, after certain verbal alterations which gave rise to no discussion. On clause 96, The ]Bishop of LONDON observed that no provision was made in the Bifl for the payment of the Chancelor and Registrar of the diocess of London. The office of Chan- ceor of that dioces was one of great importance, and had been held by mien of high distinction, including Lord Stowell and Dr. Lushington. He hoped, therefore, taat before the report was brought up the noble and learned lord would provide for the payment of those important officals, not only in the diocess of London, but in other dioceses. The LORD CHANCELLOR was understood to say that, although he could not admit the propriety of impo g a tax on the probate of wills in order to maintain ecclesiastical officials he would consider the suggestion of the right rev, prelate. The clause was then agreed to, as were also the remaining clauses of the BilL The schedules were agreed to, and the House resumed, DULWICH COLLEGE BILL. On the motion of the LORD CHACELLOR this Bill Was read a second time and referred to a ,elect committee. The House then adjourned at a few minutes past 8 o'clock till Mlonday.

(Hear, hear.) COLONEL JACOB'S RIFLE. Colonel SYKES asked the Under-Secretary for War wtattarttaWar Department,fin contmuingtheexperiments With the Whitworth rifle, would simultaneously cause experiments to be made with the weapon known as-Colonel Jacob's rifle, to which the attention of the War Department has been officially «irawn by reports communicated from India. .?Ír;!vRA-MSDEIÍ "^ BOme experiments had been tried with Colonel Jacob's rifle, tat orilyat »short range. A farther supply of rifle shells and buUets made for this particular rifle tad been obtained, and the experiments would be renewed as soon as arrangements could be made at a much larger and more satisfactory range. THE NEW CARTRIDGES. Mr. STANLEY asked the Under-Secretary for War if the various plans submitted to the War Department during the late war of attaching the cap to the cartridge, or other contrivance obviating the troublesomenecessity of thesoldier havmg to bite the cartridge, had received the attention of the Secretary of State for the War Department, and if »ny of them was likely to be adopted î Sir J. RAMSDEN said that It had not been found practicable to introduce the contrivance referred to by tho hon. gentleman into use, but the cartridges which were used with the Enfield rifle were made soas to obviate the necessity of the soldier havmg to bite off the end; »nd when that arm was introduced generaUy throughout the army the object aimed at by the contrivance referred to would be attained. REVENUE POLICE (IRELAND}. Colonel FRENCH »sked the Secretary to the Treasury if tha report was correct that the Revenue Poüce in Ireland were to ta dismissed, the 'men to bo transferred to the constabulary, »nd » small gratuity to ta given to the officers now serving? Mr. WILSON said that it was not the intention of the Government to abandon the present system, which had been commenced under the act of 1854; butas that Act expired in the present year, Parliament would ta asked to renew it with certain modifications. THE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS BILL. Lord GODERICH asked Mr. Adderley whether the amendments introduced by him in the Industrial Schools Bui provided for the omission of all clauses authoriring any charge upon the poor-rate. Mr. ADBERLEY said that in deference to the opposition to tbs BilL of which the noble lord had been the chief »uthor, every allusion to the hoards of guardians, and every charjge npon the poor-rates, tad been omitted from the Bill, with the single exception ot » permissive clause enabling boards of guardians, with the sanotion of the Poor Law Board, to make uso of these schools. THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION. Mr. MACARTNEY asked the ChanceUor of tta Exchequer whether there would be any objection to lay on the table the report of the Civü Service Commission on Monday nex^ prior to tta appendix being printed. The CHANCELLOR ofthe EXCHEQUER said that the report of the Commissioners had been presented, but the appendix had not yet been reoeived. It would be ready in the conree of next week, and, as it would be more conducive to the proper understanding of the question to have the two together, the report would be delayed nntü tho »ppendix could be presented with it. THE SLAVE TRADE. .Mr. P. O'BRIEN asked theSecretaryof State for theColonies whether the magistrate who, according to the report of Mr. Fitzpatrick to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Gold Coast, dated Cape Coast Castle, in the year 1853, refused to five information respecting the slave trade to Commander hiiips, of Her Majesty's ship Polyphemus, unless he was guaranteed some reward, stül holds the commission of the peace at the Gold Coast ; and whether the two other magistrates stated in the same report to have been holders of slaves and pawns still hold the commission of tho peace for the Gold Coast. Mr. LABOUCHERE said that none of the magistrates to whom tho question referred continued to hold the commission of the peace in that colony. THE HOLYDAYS. Mr. WALPOLE asked the noble lord at the head of tta Government whether he intended to propose ttat the House should »djourn over Tuesday next, the day on which Her Majesty's birthday is to be kept. It would be convenient if the noble lord would at the same time state what adjournment he proposed for tho Whitsuntide recess. Lord PALMERSTON.-I intend to propose that the House shaU as usual adjourn over the day on which Her Majesty's birthday is kept, and also over the following day (hear, hear), on which our Isthmian games are celebrated. (" Hear, hear," »nd a Uugh.) With regard to Whitsuntide, I shall propose that we »djourn from Friday to the Thursday foUowing. Thursday being a day on which the motions of private members are taken, I do not think it wonld be right to »djourn over ttat day ; tat it would ta unnecessary to ask members to come np on Wednesday for a mornm» sitting. (Hear, hear.) ° TORTURE IN INDIA. On the question that the House at its rising should adjourn to Monday, Lord C. HAMILTON rose to call attention to the subject of torture in India. After referring to the debates upon this subjeot which occurred in that and the other House of Partament, and to the commission which was issued to inquire into tta subject, tho noble lord said ttat tho result ofthat commission was to prove ttat in the Presidency of Madras torture prevailed to an alarming extent. One of the purposes for which it was employed wa3 to enforce the payment of tta revenue. It »lso appeared that torture had been inflicted for the purpose of extorting confessions from persons accused of crime; and with what result ? Why, 1,606 persons, under the influence of torture, had confessed themselves guilty of the offences with which they were charged, and yet, when thoso persons had been allowed to retract that confession and take » fair trial, 890 of them had been fully acquitted. (Hear, hear.) It was impossible to conceive a more infamous state of things. Then, again, the torture inflicted by the native polico, not onlv upon males, but also upon females, almost defied description ; »nd yet, when these atrocities were brought home to the offenders, the punishment inflicted was so slight that other persons wero deterred from making complaints. ("Oh, ohi" from the Ministerial benches.) Hon. gentlemen opposite might »ttempt to_ put him down by clamour, but he would maintain that the system was one disgraceful to » free country. The commissioners who had reported upon the subject (" Oh, oh 1" from Ministerial bonches) had referred to the difficulty of obtaining redress, and they also stated that the poHce were underpaid, and tta consequence was that they were »U in league for purposes of plunder. Mr. O. STANLEY rose to order. He had himself ttat evening been called to order for pursuing a course similar to that of tho noble lord, -who certainly was not speakine to the question. ? ? The SPE AKER.-Tta cases are totaUy different, there is at present »motion before the ????? which gives tta noble lord »right to address the House, »nd if I »m »sked whether the noble lord is strictly in order, I am bound to »nswer ttat he is. (Cheers.) t^'rPl STANLEY again rose, but so loud were the cries of ' Order," that, after » few seconds, he resumed his se»t. The SPEAKER,-Ihave already answered the question ofthe hon. member as to whether the noble lord is in order, and I consider that the noblo lord has» right to continue his address. (Hear, hear.) Mr. O, STANLEY, however, rose again, apparently to »ddress the Ctair; but so great was the confusion whicl$ ensued that he »t length resumed his seat when The SPEAKER caUedupon Lord O. Hamilton io -pro» ceed. Mr. O. STANLEY ag«irt roee »mid * perfect sterra of cries of "Order" »nd " Chair," »nd finding theimpoMibUity of obtaining a hearing, »gain resumed his seat. Lord C. HAMILTON then was proceeding with his »d* diese, when Mr. O. STANLEY rose for the fifth time, and b/sodoing save rise to another scene of indescribable clamour »net confusion, but he was again obliged to relinquish »11 at* tempts to make himself heard. Lord 0. HAMILTON then continued,-I think that th* House wiU aUow that the tan. gentleman has not haÆ a happy duty_ to perform (hear, hear), and I irrat,. «'o at dunng what I hope may be a long tenure· of office you may never again be treated as you have ???? to-night by the hon. gentleman. (Loud cheers.) Tta noble* lord concluded by announcing his intention of bringing th* subject before the House on some future occasion, and by »sking tta President of the Board of Control if he wouldi state to the House what steps had been takea by the Go· vernment to put an end to the practice of torture in th» -trenrjency of Madras since the report of the ????????, which had proved its prevalence in that Presidency; an*. whether similar investigations had been instituted in Barnbay and Bengal ; »nd if so, whether it was intended to com* municate the result of such inquiries to the House, . Mr. VERNON SMITH would not foUow the noble lori into those details which he considered the noble lord oughSnoton tho present ooeadon to h»ve entered into. (" Oh,. «hi") It was truettatonthemotionof adjournment question» might he takennp, but it was generally understood that thos» questions should refer tomatter« of immediate emergency (· No, no"), and ho regretted tta course adopted by the* noble lord. ?? answer to the question of thenoblelord would be » very simple one. He had only to state that ifc was his intention to move for every despatch which1 hadt been wntten upon the subject since the report of that com* mission. A great deal had been done in consequence of th»· report of that commission, »nd the noble lord might resfe. assured from tta well-known character of Lord Hamsi tha. Governor-General of Madras, ttat he would do his utmost· todisoountenance and put an end to «rrythinjj like torture« When the papers to which he had »Uuded tad beenlaitt npon thetablo of the House, the noble lord would be furnished with the information which he required, and if ha= were not satisfied with that information he would, ot course, be at liberty to bring the question »gain under the». consideration of the House. WESTMINSTER BRIDGE. Mr. HENLEY asked the First Commissioner of Work» what wag the present state of Weetrmnster-bridge, »n4 whether the Government had come to the deterrninatdon to> proceed with the works which had been commenced in con. nexion with the construction of a new bridge. The righfc hon. gentleman, in explanation of his question, saij that a committee had been appointed at the cloiev of tho session of 1856 to inquire into tta state oE Westmmster-bridge, and tad recommended ttat the, works which tad been begun for the erection of the new bridge should ta suspended in oonsequenceof » report whicbi had emanated from the Committee on PubUo Offices advet catog the purchase of »Urger tract of land inthe immediate neighbourhood of Westminster, with a view tha*. public offices should be erected upon it. He perceived from the report of what had occurred in »nother place, ttat ths· noble lord the President of the Councü, had stated ttat ifc was not the intention of the Government to »pply to Parliament to sanction the purchase of a Urger plot of land, an* he therefore felt called npon to put to the nghthon. baronet thequestion of which he had given notice. He should informv the Honse that a sum of ??,????. had already been expended npon tta new bridge, »nd ttat tta river hatt been very much blocked up and impeded by- thet erections which had been rendered necessary In orderto carry on the works. He beUeved ho was also right in stating ttat many of the piers which had been constructed for that purpose did not correspond with tho piers of the· old bndgo, but actuaUy occupied the waterway betweea. them, so ttat-as had been stated in the evidence givea. tafore^the committee-the result of a heavy frost might bo> to produce the most dangerous consequences, .as the accumulation of a great body of ice might either lead to thecarrying away of tho bridge by impeding the flow of thanver, or to the inundation of the low lands in the neieb«bourhood. (Hear, hear.) Sir B. HALL said that a simUar question had ????? put to him on the 9th of February last by th* hon. member for Lambeth, in reply to which he had stated that he had seen Mr. Page, the engineer, onthe morning of ttat day, who had reported to himthat¿ notwithstanding the suspension of the works connected withv the new Westminster-bridge, no danger was likely to result» as the condition of the old bridge proved it to be as safo asit had been in the preceding year. In consequence of tha, notice which the right hon. gentleman had given him thafc he was about to bring the subject under tta consideration of the House, ho had sent for Mr. Page again ttat morning, bufe bad not been able to see him. He had, however, received from bis clerk of the works precisely the samo informationas Mr. ???? himself had given him npon the former occa» sion. With respect to the question whether the Government had determined to proceed with the works of the new Wertminster-bridgtvhe might say that two committees tact in öie course of tta session of 1856 been appointed, the ona 4,1?7S?b8?t?1tne stato of the pubUo offices, the other, ot which the right hon. gentleman had been the chairman, totake into consideration tbe condition of the old West. mmBter-bridge, and the course which should ta taken ia reference to the progress of the new bridge in that oriàrter^ lhe former committee had come unanimously to the resolution that it was desirable to concentrate the publio offices? the immediate neighbourhood of Downing-street andth* ^vernment having taken that resolution into their consideration had determined that, in consequence of the state off the War-office and tta inconveniences which arose in th* conduct of tta business of ttat department, it wasexpedienfe that a new War^pffice shonld be erected. They had cometo a suralar conclusion with reference to tta bnildlne of a> new Foreign-office, and he felt assured that the right hon. gentleman would concur in the propriety of that conclusion when he recollected that the noble lord who had been at tht* head of the Foreign Department under the Government oE ???? Derby hadhad his head nearly broken in consequence· pt a portion of the ceiling of one of the rooms having f aUealn (a laugh), owing to the duapidated condition of the buiding, lhe Government under these circumstances had endeavoured, in order that the new edifices might be worthy ofthe metropolis, to procure by means of competition tha services of the best architects, not only ín Europa but throughout the world, and tad with . thafc view sent out specifications to almost every quarter of the globe. The appeal had been most nobly responded to, as was clearly shown by the designs whicl* were now bemg exhibited in Westminster-haU. In connexion with the designs for the two pubUc offices to whicb ta tad aUuded, however, it had been deemed expedient by the Government, taking into account the reportof tta Committee npon PubUo Offices, that specifications fordesignsfor laying out the ground between Richmond-terrace on tha north, Great George-street on the south, the Thames on th» east, and St. James's Park on the west should also ba sent out. His noble friend the President of the Council had, however, stated correctly that it was not the intention of the Government to purchase the whole of ttat site, but he might state ttat they were prepared to propose a Bilí with »view of »cquiring the property which lay betweea Downing and Charles streets, in orderte buüdnponita Wac and a Foreign Office, should ParUament sanction their; erection. Ono portion of the report of the committes on Westminster-bridge had been to the foUowina eflect :- ^" " Your committee are of opinion that, subject tothe consideration of professional advice to be obtained by the First Commissionerof Works asto thesecuriiyoftheoldbridge, tha further progress of the works of thenew Westminster-bridge should remain suspended until the Government have had an opportunity of considering and deciding on the- adviceto be_ offered to Parliament upon this last subject, whea the site of the new bridge might be considered in connexion with any general plan of alteration and improvement in tta neighbourhood, as weU as the aU-importanfcsubject of the headway under the bridge." Now, in deference to the opinion which had been expressed by that committee, he had set forth in the specifications th» necessity of taking into consideration in any block plan,whioh might be furnished the firing of a ate· for thonew Wertminster-bridge. He had a short tim» ago, with the sanction of the Government, appointed· some gentlemen to consider the plans which had been sent in in accordance with the spécification, and he expectedthat those gentlemen would make their report about th* middle of next month. As soon as that report had beert. presented he should lay it upon the table of the House, when anoppertunity would ta afforded to hon. members to> enter into the whole subject, and to determine whether th* new Wertminster-bridge should or shonld not continue ia its present site, and if so, whether it was expedient ttat th» works should be proceeded with upon the present or upor». a totaUy new plan. (Hear, hear.) lb·. STANLEY then rose to apologize to tta Speaker f of having in any way seemed to dispute his authority. {Hear hear.) He should be sorry, he said, as one who had for ». considerable time ocoupied a seat in that House to appear to. have set a bad example to the new members, anu hecoulól only assure the right hon. gentleman that he would find ?????1!^© "? *the ^^ **· ALLOWANCE TO THE PRINCESS ROYAL. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER having.- moved that the House should go into committee to tak* into consideration the Royal message on this subject, Mi·. ROEBUCK.-Sir, I am reluctant to interpose at th* present moment, hut I beUevo ttat the opinions I am »bout to express »re those which aro held by a large body of my countrymen, and for that reason I beUeve that they wül ba> attended to by this House. I do not think that anythin» ? can offer will carry any weight with it, butasmyoplnioa wül be tacked out of doors I have no doubt the House wüt. give me its attention for » f e w momenta. Sir, I feel that ? have on the present occasion a divided duty. I have a duty to perform to the Sovereign and a duty to the people. Th» Sovereign of these realms has so won the affections ot herpeople that in her case they sink the monarch in the woman,. and the respect and deference which we owe to the Sovereign are, if I may so say, swaUowed up in the affection forthe woman. (Hear, hear.)

!TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIARS& Sir,-MBy I request the favour of an insertion in your Journau of the foSowing brief statement with reference to Lord Lyndhurst's explanation touching my petition in the House of Lords yesterday?-an explanation which is in perfect unison'with my own on the same subject, save in one Tery important point, which was, of course, quite an accidental omisdon, or oblivion, on the part of his Lordship. I allude to the fact of his having written me word that a few days after his writing to me at Llangollen, saying my papers were ready for me with his porter (which letter 1 never received), "a young woman had called at his house for those papers, purporting to have been sent direct from Lady Bolwer Lyttonr for them." Now, it is upon this fraud that the pivot of my whole petition for an investigation into the matter turns; not only as a means of tracingimy stolen property, butalso as a guarantee against similar practices in future I beg to take this public opportunity of assuzing Lord Lyndhurzt that it was not of any "unpoliteness" or want of courtesy on his part that I complained, as I never had any reason to do so. I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient qervant K13YiNINA RIY II -Win T -7mmi, Clarke's C&stle Hoe Ta"no RW26.
-IwnE 4VOfON QUvsTro.-The supply of cotton is nota Lancashire question ony, bt. an U respects a national one; and we are glad to see th t-4 is rapidly assuming that position. The importsnt meeting which was held on Thursday at the Town-hall, assures us of the ze4ous ca-operation of th commercial men of Liverpool. The interestsof the ootton brok-ersand the cotton consumers are one ; or, rather they only echo the concern wbich ought to be felt by every class throughout the empire. The question nowvis what shaUl be done. The necessity of takingaction Is universally acknowledged, hut where and how are we to make a beginning? The problem is a difficult one. The obstacles which have to he overcome aro non-commercial else the mere operation of high prices would of itself bring about a remedy. We have to break down barriers which *.rtns1y cointitute the growth of cotton a monopoly, in order to afford free scope to ordinary commercial agencies. There is land enough in abundance withia the jarisdiction of Great Britain, bat that commodit5 in useless without an abundant supply of labour, and the only country where both thes essentials are to be set with Eeems to be India. And why can't we grow cotton in India? Partly because of the anti-commercial policy of the Government and partly becAuse of a vread of innovation on the part of the people. These then, are the difficulties with which we have to deal. Are they insuperable? Is it notin the power of the House of Commons to comnel such changes in tho administration of India at al evcits, ,within certain ternitorial limits, as will enable a few enter prising men to make a fair experiment in the growth of cotton on a large scale? Inte ligence is largely diffused among the upper class of natives; cannot they be induced to co-operate m the work, at least to such an extent as to disarm the jealousies and fears of the less enlightened? To mention such obstacles is sufficient to show that we must be content to work for the future. Immediate results cannot be regarded in a very sanguine )iEht. We have sown tb the wind by our past neglect, and we must be contsnt for a time to reap the crop. Bat any delay on this account would be sheer madnees We may tide over the present: it is the iuture 'which is most menacing. Whatever Parliament can do it must be called upon to do at onoe.

LONDON, SATURDAY, MAY 23, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, The Duke of NoiiFoL1; gave notice that upon the motion for going into comniittee upon the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill he should move thit it be referred to a Select Committee. Lord PM&IUWuE entered into some explanatioan with regard to the report of the Cornmissionera on Military Education, which he declared it was never his intention to supprsss; and further stated that a
It is not often that the House of Commons, or any body of " men of business," has to settle so interesting a question as the dowry of a very young lady about to be married to the "' man of "her choice." Of the PRINCESS Roy&A herself, and the marriage, we will not repeat what we have already said. We have simply given utterance to the feelings of the nation, and therefore we are not surprised that perhaps the fullest House that has met since the accession of Queen VIcrORIA last night unanimously decided on a very handsome provision. In the two precedents that bore on the case Parliament had given the sum of 80,0001., and, in round numbers, an annuity of 5,0001. In both these instances the alliance was of such a kind that the annuity nmight turn out a very appreciable addition to the income of the Princess throuohout the whole of her life and at the highest of her fortunes. The present instance appears to be very different. The PRiNcEss RoYAL, in the ordinary course of human events, will remain for several years the wife of the Hleir Presumptive to the Throne of Prussia, and during that time she wir not yet be so merged in the splendour of that Court and the dignity of her new position but that we shall still think of her as the Princess Royal of England. She will also have to stand in the glare of Russian magnificence and not be eclipsed. On these accounts we should certainly have been glad that an arrangement should be made which would provide more for the present occasion,-that is, for the earlier stage of her Royal Highness's promised career. Nor is this our only reason. We are too well aware of the impatience with which annual payments, continued through a long series of years, are apt to be regarded, and of the general feeling towards pensioners, particularly when the pensioners are members of foreign Courts in no need of our bounty. We cannot but reflect that a day may come, in the next century perhaps, when Prussia may be, not a foe, but, what is worse, a very neutral, very indifferent Power, with a policy of its own ; when England may be suffering severely in some generous, perhaps losing cause; and we cannot but forecast that the British people would see with indignation year after year a payment of some thousands to the Queen of PRUSSIA, all the time that Prussia itself was becoming less and less an object of national sympathy. It may be that by that time the mass of the people will not even know who that QUEEN had been, and how she acquired that right to a share in the produce of our industry. Accordingly, we inclined, ourselves, to a departure from the precedents, by the substitution of one round sum in place of the dower and the annuity. The Houise of Commons would have voted a handsome amount with an enthusiasm which the people would have responded to, and the money, once voted, would have been forgotten, as not only hundreds of thousands, but of milliots, have been before. The only interference with the disposition of the sum so voted would have been that a portion of it might have been placed at once at the absolute disposal of the newly married pair, and the greater part vested, as usual, in trustees. WYhat has been done is the contrary of wvhat we could have desired. Government has thought fit to raise the annuity to 8,000l.,reducing the dowry to 40,0001. The result of this is that, as we most loyally hope, and have great reason to expect, for many years of the next century, there will every year be found in the returns of our public expenditure a payment of 8,0001. to the Prussian Queen, come what will, peace or war, alliance or neutrality, community or diversity of interest. As this precedent will set the rule, there will be similar payments to Princesses at other Courts, and for an equal period, and, though we can answer for the interest with which we ourselves shall follow the fortunes of those daughters of England, we cannot answer for the indifference or ignorance of those that come after us. We should have wished to carry out in this case the same rule that kindness and prudence conspire to recomnuend in private life. Sons do not always love their aunts the better for being encumbrances on the estate-least of all when the estate is inadequate to the wants of the present and the rising generation. The Government proposal, however, has been adopted, for the simple reason that there was no other before the House, which naturally took the only offer that was made. The eccentric Member for Sheffield, who is admirably adapted for standing on the top of a pillar and preaching to pilgrims of all nations, or testifying to a plague smitten city, and who cannot reduce his inspirations to a vulgar working form, undertook to meet the Ministerial proposition. He met it only with a principle which might be ever so sound, but had the disagreeable character of disturbing unanimity and threatening what might possibly be a serious difference of opinion. Had Mr. RoEBucK had the wit to name a handsome round sum to be substituted for the composite proposition of the Minister, and had he divided the House at once on the first call for a division, we have very little doubt he would have had a decided majority. We believe his only objection to this course was, that he did not venture to name a sum high enouglh for the purpose, or to commit himself to any sum that would involve much explanation to the electors of Sheffield. If this was his reason, we can only say that he ought to have handed over his cause to some one blessed either with more courage or with a more reasonable constituency. As it was, he took possession of the ground and employed it to deliver a barren testimony. Since it is so settled, we have only to express our own earnest wisbes that the PRiNCESS ROYAL may long live to receive this testimony to the virtues of her mother and to lhtr own engaging qualities; and that nothing may ever occur at that Court where her lot is now' cast to maLe the British people repent of their generous confidence.
We were not mistaken in our conjecture that the notables excluded from the new Parliament would soon make their voices heard outside. Mr. COBDE2- has appeared before the public again, not indeed in person, but through the mediu?m of his friends, and certainly our readers may peruse a good many debates without finding observ+a4ons miore teling than those offered in his. 4 notices to " correpondents." Mr. JAMES CAI, the, member for IDartmouth, had "jotted dov, a few qiieations' u-sot the affttirs of China, to which he- desired. ntplies. Mr. AV, S. LNri,Y, fxoj.w .ini4d the:m accordingly to: Mlidhu,it, and the answers were promptly returned without, it must needs be confessed, any alloy of oracular ambiguity. In fact, if Mr.X COBDExN had put the questions to himself they could hardly have given him a better opportunity for his retorts. " What are the objects of the war I" begins the unsuspecting Mir. mARD. " I should say," replies Mr. COBDEN, with the aplomb of a prize pupil in a Sunday school, "that the " objects of the war are to divert public atten"tion from domestic politics, and keep the present "Administration in office. Wars have generally "had similar objects, and have always been "successful." Very well indeed, but rather hardily ventured, too, considering that the very last war threw a Ministry out of office instead of keeping it in, and that the present war has actually brought domestic politics to the crisis of a general election and the announcement of a new Reform Bill. Mr. CAiRD, however, proceeds to make certain inquiries about freedom of residence and navigation in China, which bring 3Mr. COBDEN to the matters more practically in dispute. Unfortunately, the querist asks whether Chusan is to be " seized"_ an expression which drops him at once into the vice, and produces a nimble turn or two of the screw. " Why seize anything that " does not honestly belong to you T If I were to " seize some of your Ayrshire cows you would send " me to Newgate or Hanwell." Yet, after all, the fault was mainly in the phrase, for Mr. COBDEN goes on to reply substantially in the affirmative, and is "by no means sure" but what turning Chusan into a Singapore would be a wise proceeding. Many people are of the same opinion, but not perhaps the Chinese themselves, for Chusan is vastly larger than E[ongkong, and much nearer those provinces which the Celestial Court so jealously reserves. Nor would the " neutralization" of the territory be much better than its "occupation"' except. in words, oi the exchange do much, under such circiumstances, in the obviation of robbery. Hongkong, from its description, can never have been of any value to the Chinese, and it has always been the especial desire of their Government to confine us as far as possible to the extremity of the empire at Canton. As to the actual freedom of trade already enjoyed, and the prospects of enlarging it to our own profit, Mr. CoBDEN is probably pretty much in the right. We are not sure about the navigation of the Chinese Seas being open; practically perhaps it might be so, as there wouid be no means of enforcing exclusion, but at the time of the last treaty there was certainly an understanding that our ships were not to advance bigher than the 32d degree of north latitude-i. e., not to proceed above the mouth of the Yang-tse-Kiang River to the most populous and promising coasts of the empire. Although, too, it is reasonable enough to insist upon the rights of the Chinese to open or close their internal navigation, it is equally reasonable that merchants at a seaport only a few miles below a, large and wealthy city-as is actually the case at Amoy and Shanghai-should wish to ascend the stream upon their errands of traffic. But now we must take the liberty of correcting a certain assumption on which Mr. CoBDens advantage in these catechetical passages has altogether depended. It is not correct to say that the Chinese contest was undertaken to keep Lord PALmERsToN in office-indeed, Mr. COBDEN did his best to give it precisely an opposite effect, and, but for the interposition of the country, would have succeeded. But neither, again, is it correct to assume that the object of the fighting, if fighting there is to be, will be the extension of our trade in the sense adopted by Mr. CAIRD and pounced upon by Mr. COBDEN. If an expedition were despatched from these shores with the mission of winning new markets at the cannon's mouth we should entirely coincide with Mr. COBDEN's estimate of the wisdom of such a policy. The case, however, is in nowise of this kind. Our squadrons are not proceeding to China for any such purpose. The " objects of the war," we " should say," are to obtain redress for outrage offered and to get some security against the recurrence of the trouble, by correcting thV spirit of insolence out of which it arose. Other results, be they what they may, are only so many contingencies. We simply want to put our affairs in China on a better footing. Very possibly an unrestricted right of residence might lead to little good, but at any rate we must, for the indispensable purposes of the tea trade, maintain some establishments in China, and Mr. COBDE himself has admitted the hardship of being confined to a few acres of swamp, wi.2iout much more liberty of exercise than would be allowed to convicts in a penitentiary. We must have tea; indeed, the demand for this necessaxy of life is of the highest benefit to the Chinese themselves, and we have a fair right to ask for decent treatment while we buy it. It is easy enough to argue that in the matter of commercial tariffs the Chinese are at least as liberal as their betters. Perhaps they are so, but these are not the " facilities" about which we are contending. We do not take up arms to modify the export or transit duties which they may think f-t to impose on their produce; we do so only to prevent our being degraded and insulted while we are engaged in purchasing it. Very likely it may be of no use to us to reside by right in Canton, but it will be of very great use to efface that stigma of inferiority which is conveyed in our exclusion from the city as an unclean and barbarous race. At Canton the Chinese have been encouraged to preserve an arrogance of demeanour for which aU real warrant has long disappeared, and the natural consequences of such a pretension have been visited upon our residents til they ard endurable no longer. They, and not we, are the barbarians. We, and not they, possess the real ascendancy both in arts and arms, and it is preposterous in the extreme to expect that au assumption should be perpetuated about which there is ncw no delusion even in the Celestial Court itself, and which merely expresses the local passions of a fierce an(d turbulent populace. If the objections entertained to our admission into Canton were really founded on any such impressions as those attaching to the city of Mecca or the Mosque of ONAn, they would deserve indulgent consideration ; but such is not the case. Canton has no pretensions to sanctity whatever, nor would the entrance of foreigners into its streets offend any sentiment more laudable than the bigotry of national arrogance, which after disappearing elsewhere has found its last abode among the population of a swarming seaport. Even this we nmight under some c;rcumstances be content to overlook, but the truth is that the spirit which this pretension embodies is refleeted in our ordinary relations with the Chinese andl their Governors. It puts us visibly under a ban as a debased and humiliated class, and such a position entails its naturat zesults in a thousand aets of annoyance. Tovthis treatment we cannot be called upon to submit If the Chinese are indeed so weak as to deman&t imri forbearance, that of itself is a reason why their own intolerance should have an end. It in perfectly absurd that- a nation should sIB for indulgence on the score of b elplessawm one moment and exhibit the extrTeA. o domineering insolence the next. They mvA be- impressed with the fact that we are a .i.Reo2le as well. as good customers, aUd tbA we insist upon being treated withlout degradation while we pour money by the bushel into their laps. More we do not want, but this we trust we may ask for without exposing ourselves to that Divine retribution which Mr. COBDEN thinks may wait upon the proceeding. I
Sir RcHRaD BzTrH's Bill, that child of* many hopes, which is intended to provide a remedy, or various remedies, against breaches of trust, was introduced on Thursday evening into the House of Commons. The matter is a complicated one, and, as it is principally on the subject of one class of fraudulent trustees that public indignation is excited at the present moment, we will confine our remarks to this portion of the Bill. We speak, of course, of the Directors and MIanagers of various Joint-stock enterprises, who appropriate to their own use the money of their constituents, or who swindle the public out of their money by means of false accounts and fraudulent representations. It was for this portion of the ATrroRwy-GENmsst's measure that the House waited the other night with the keenest expectation, and it is upon this point that our readers will ask for the most accurate information. We wiU therefore venture to reverse the sequence of Sir RrcsARD BaTisre's clauses, and speak at once of that which will be of the most general interest to al. The substance of the clauses directed against the Directors and Managers of public Companies is, in the ATroiu>ErGENs-uA's own words, as follows:- H He had introdaced into the Bill a series of clauses under the operation of which, if they should pass into a law, the act of keepingfalse accounts, of snakingfalse entries, or diguising the nature of those transactions by means of untruce represnerations, should be made criminal. He had also framed two other clauses, which would embrace in their operation tat extnsire system of fraud which was produced through the medium of false representationss coupled with acts to give a colour to those representations such as fraudulent statements of the affairs of a company, or the payment of dividends out of a fictitious capitaL" As a tentative measure this reads well. It will be of much advantage to the public that all Directors or Managers of public Companies who keep false accounts, who disguise the real nature of their transactions by means of false representations, or who pay dividends out of a fictitious capital, should be made amenable to criminal justice. The English code, if indeed our system of laws deserves the name, has heretofore been an exception upon such points to the codes of all civilized nations. England is the greatest commercial country in the world, and the commercial code of England has been the worst in the world. The vulgar sophism that the law should not interfere with the operations of commerce, in the interest of commerce itself, has passed from mouth to mouth without challenge and without denial. It' is perfectly true that the law should not press upon commeree, but it is not true that the law should not interfere with swindling. The growth and sustentation of credit are the points at which we should aim, but are these ends furt'herel by leaving the field clear to uinprincipled men and swindlers of every degree to fleece the public at their will? Would not the public be more ready to embark their capital itt joint-stock affairs to-morrow if they had full and implicit confidence in the probity and intelligence of the Directors of such enterprises? Many such concerns are really under the management of honest and reputable men, but they must needs share the discredit into which this class of investment has fallen owing to the peculation and rascality of such unprincipled persons as the Directors of the Tipperary and Royal British Banks. To check the proceedings of these people is not to embarrass, but to promote, legitimate commerce. We have no doubt that numbersof speculative gentlemen about town who are in the habit of tuning awkward corners with one wheel over the edge of the precipice will exclaim against a provision under which a Director may be consigned to a term of imprisonment with hard labour if he consents to pay dividends out of fictitious capital, which will practically amount-as it ought to amount-to a prohibition against paying dividends out of capital at all. Every forty-per-cent. man will be at once ready with his select examples of concerns which have been saved from a smash by desperate driving, and he will ask if Directors of public Companies are to be prohibited from doing that which any private individaal, the head of a firm, or a firm in his own proper person, is at liberty to do, and which turns out well, say, upon one-eighth per cent. of embarr-ssed concerns? The answer, of course, is that the welfare of the pcrsons who are interested in the 99 iths per cent. which represent the failures is of more consequence in the eyes of the Legislature than the salvation of the infinitely few who are saved from destruction by the desperation of their managera. There is an essential distinction between the case of the Directors of a public Company and the head of a private firm. The dealings of the Company are general, and the representations of its Directors are necessarily received largely upon trust. In the case of a private concern all persons who elect to operate in concert with it, if they be traders-or to trust their fortunes to it, if they be non-traders-have means ard opportunity of satisfying themselves as to its credit and stability. There is some shadow of excuse-the shadow, we grant, is but a faint one-for the man who plays out a desperate g-ene upon his own account; his head may be heated, his sight dazzled, the personal results to himself of the adventure may be so overwhelming as to chill his moral sense and disturb his powers of calculation. But how shall ingenuity, how shaU sophistry even, frame an escuse for the Directors of a public Company who betray their trust? Their office is purely ministerial. They have no more right to lose their self-possession than chess-players on commission. The only reason which cam disturb their equanimity is that they have been thieves and liars, that they have betrayed the sacred confidence of those who trusted in them, and that when they cannot replace what they have stolen, or hope to disguise their ,alsehood any longer, they lose their heads. Now, this is a kind of desperation with which the public cannot be supposed to have much sympatby. After all, in England rogues are in a desperately small, although a very sonorous, minority. If a calculation were made, on the one hand, of the vast amount of fair trade which is transacted in these islands, and if, as a per cou.trc, were taken the amount which would represent fraudulent transactions of every kind, any one who thinks of the subject for the first time would be very pleasantly startled at the result of the comparison. Fair trade will rejoice to be freed from the incubus of swindlers. It will be a great satisfaction to the public to be informed that Sir RicHARD BETxvTi has at length made up his mind to prosecute the Directors of the Royal British Bank. The subject is one of so much imi3ortance that our readers wiU be glad to see the very words of this comfortable assurance:- " While speaking upon that point he might perhaps be allowed to advert to an answer which he had a few evenings before given to a question of an hon. gentleman whoh ad asked him to inform the House whether he would not institute oriminal proceedings against certain persons who were enoerned in transactions by which the public mind had of late been much occupied. Nsow, as he had, at the time at which that question had been put to him, rad none of the ev.idence in that case, an.d had 7;ept his mind free from the impressions 'which might be produced by newspaper rep"rts, he had not been in a podimp tQ state to the Etouse tbat he would certainly "Isi. tuto such prosemt!on. Hm had, however, e&nc made hiimself acquainted With thb 3sture of the case, and, hAving read the documents wleh hbd been laid before him by the EoIlcitor to the assfgoee, he had 1no hesitation in sayirng haa he would try wuihout a moment's dday whthr the Zaw 0s it nwm stooducnu not strg enough to meet that ea (Cheers.) Hie trusted, therefore, the House would feel that in giving the anawer to which he had jut alluded he hai been guided by his own consciuetious con iceton, and tW he would not przit himasef to be dictae to by a new8. Pot)er, nor adopt it$ sggesions, unj&s t AeyeAcpp to be such as to command his individual assent." Sir RMCrAIII BwnELL has beens careful to inform the public that he is "descendedfro the ol&Welsh " faily Of AP ITHEL," and, like aa honeetWelshman as he professes to be, he eats his leek and swea. But why alJ this wrath because he was reminded of a duty which he most assuredly had negected ? Why this ridiculous fling against newspapes, which, as he tells the House with one breath, he studiously eschews, and which with the next he sets at defiance; and why? Because he was told that he ought some time back to 'have adopted a course which he could not help adopting at last, and which it would have been a flagrant breach of duty in him not to adopt. We can readily, however, afford to smile at Sir R. BnETS,'S fractiousness when he tells us that the case of those wretched impostors who were concerned with the management of the Iloyal British Bank will at longth, however unwillingly, be properly taken in hand.

AMERICA. (BY ELECTBIC TELEGRAPH.) WIVLEPOOL, FsDAY BVxZraG. The United States' steamship Ericsson has arrived, with advices from New York to the 9th inst.; she brings no specie. The steamship Hermann, from Bremen, and the steamship Leopold, from Antwerp, had arrived at New York. Lord Nfapier is reported to have had a long and satisfactory interview with, the President. A despatch from Wahington of the 8th to the New York ReraZd says,- "There was a Cabinet meeting to-day, and it is reported that the recent rejection of the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty was under consideration. The Cabinet are said to be a unit on this important subject; they believe that the state. nent of the British GovArmment is correct as to Ruatan, b'at do not ebteem it safficient reason for the rejection of the treaty; it is stated that Lord Napier deeply regrets the altered condition of things; and the despatch states that Lord Napier proposed to the PretWdent the opening of new negotiations, founded upon the conditional acquiescence of Honduras, bat the President declined." A meeting was about to be held at New Orleans for the relief of returned Filibusters, and to raise $500, advanced for their passage by Captain Dunlop, of the British frigate Tartar, which had landed 3190 of them at the mouth of the Mississippi. Measles prevailed on board the frigate. A riot, attended with some destruction of pro. perty, had occurred at Staten Tsland. Mr. Murphy, engineer of Brooklyn Navy-yard, had been dismissedfor"cowhiding" the Hon. Daniel Sickles. The latter had declined a hostile meeting. Advices from Venezuela report the election of Alonagas to the Presidency and Senor Oriach to the Vice-Presidency. At New York trade generally was dull. Money was moderately active at 8 to 9 per cent. on first-class notes, where the maturity dianot exceed four months. Second-class paper went at 10 to 12 per cent., and call loans 7 per cent. Stocks were depressed, there being a generalfeeling of distrust in railway securities The market, however, showed symptoms of improvement. The Michigan Southern Railway Company had issued proposals for 3,000,000 of preference stock. The closing quotations were :-United States Six per Cents., 118; Ohio Sixes, 105; Kentucky Sixes, 103; Indiana Fives, 83j; Pennsylvania Fives, 84j; Virginia Sixes, 911 ; Georgia Sixes, 9; * California, Sevens, 47; North Carolina Sixes, 9;* *MAissouri Sixes, 82i; Louisiana Sixes, 85, Tennessee Sixes, 87; Erie Railroad Sevens, 96k; ditto Bonds 88; Hudson River, 97T; fllnois Central, Sevens, 99k; New York Central Sixes, 86i. In exchange there was little done for the Ericsson. On London, 109 to 104i. Cotton was a shade easier, with only a moderate business at the decline. Flour advanced 30c., and the stocks were much reduced. Wheat, owing to the small supply, had risen from 5c. to 10c.; corn had advanced 2c. to Sc., with a fair demand at the improvement. Pork was 10c. better, with a moderate demand. Beef unchanged. Cut meats were a sbade dearer, and in fair request. Bacon scarce and firn. Iron continued quiet. Coal was dull. Freights remained depressed, with a moderate business. At New Orleans, on the 7th inst., the sales of cotton were 2,000 bales middling, quoted at 13gc. to 13*c, Receipts, 1,200 bales. Freights firmer. At Charleston, on the 8th, the cotton-market was depressed. Sales, 1,200 bales, at 131c. for good middling. Freighta..-Cotton, to Liverpoo], 14d. SHIPPING INTMELGENCE.

IR. CODDE9 t7POK TIU OPENDIb OC OUB TRADE WITH ORtNA. Mr. W. S. Lindsay, .LP., laid the founldatiof sione of the Borough of Tynemouth Mechanics Institution on Tuesday evening, and after performing the ceremony spoke at a large meeting in the' Albion Assemnbly-rooms. During the course of his remarks Mr. Lindsay made some observations ota the Chinese question, and intimated that, just as hef Was leaving London that morning, he had received a communication from Mr. Cobdeii. Mr.Jaimes Caird, M.P. for Dartmiouth, Mr. Lindsay stated, after' readingthrough the blu&-books on (Sina, had jotted down somo questions with regard to several points. Mr. Lindsay had sent thei on to Mr. Cobden, and the following are extractt from the comnmunication he bad received in reply to them:- " Midhurat, May 18. "What business have freetraders to apply for help at the, Horse Guards and Admiralty to force sa entry into Chinas If markets are to bo gained in that way, why not begit nearer home and batter away at WrseliUes, Tneste, C adi, and Odessa, where there is umuch less freedom for foreign taders than in China? There is no necessity for fighting for markets any where. We have more trade now than w, know what to-do with, and if we will only give time (which. we can well afford to do) every other nation wil follow our example. As for China, her trade is freer than our own. But teU Caird that to talk of fighting for markets under our new free trade dispensation is to rnake him as oldfauhioned a fellow in my eyes as I would be in his if I wem to abjure turnip husbandry and kill off my cattle wlhen summer pastures failed me, and salted my meat for winters consumption by my family." Mr. Caird's questions were " L What arethe objects of the war? "2. Is Lord Elgin to demand permission for British sub.- jects to reside in China, with leave to trade 2 " 3. Is Chun t be sezed and permanently occupied as thle best emnporium for British trade ? "o4. Is navigation of the China seas and rivers free to all, '5. Are p reparations onascale of due magnitude being made for enioromg such conditions ? "6. Is Lord Elgin cautioned againrst maaking any sudden or patc'hed up treaty hich may render the past bloodshed and expense mneffective 7" To these Mr. Cobden replies: "1. I should say the objects of the war are to divert public attention from domestic politics, and keep the present Administration in office. Wars have generally had imilar objects, and have always been successfuL "2. Such a demand would be Very unreasouable Unlesa the Chinese Government were allowed to make its own conditions--a right insisted onin other countries. For instance, the UnitedStates will not allow a British subject, if he be not quite white, to reside in some parts of that country. The .eusaan Government will not permit a British subject, if he be aJew (at least it was so whenL I was there ina 3g9k to carry on busness in St. Petersburg; and our dear ally the Ttrk prohibits, on pain of death, the entrance of 1ug. lshmen into Mecca. Bat, practically, what advantage would be gained by having the right of residing in auy part of China conceded to us? Who would live in the intenor of the countq ? What Englishmen are found livingfor purposes of busmess in the interior of Tarkey or Perna, or even of our own territory of India? Why, with the exceptionl of half a score of indigo planters, there is hardly an Englishman, or even a Scot to be found residing in British India beyond the great seaports. There are nearly as many British houses of business in China as India. It is A chimera of the brain, this cry for admission into China. " 3. Why seize anything that does not honestly belong to yo? It I were to seize some of your Ayrshire cows you would send me to Newgate or Hanwell. I am, however, by no means sure that it would not be a wiser plai to give up HIongkong, and offer to withdraw frou all the fire ports to which we are entitled to trade, oncondition that Chusan were made free, like Singapore, to the-trade of all the world, and declared neutral territory. My own opmion is that the more contact we have with the people or China on the mainland the greater the danger of colision - that it will not lead to any increase of our exports, while it will occasion a constant increase in our military and naval establishments to 'protect' British merchants and fillibusters, and of course lead to frequent recurrence of war. On the other hand, if Chussn were a free port, the Chinese would bring their silk and tea there and take your manufactures (as much as they do now) in return, and after a long experience of the benefits of a peaceful trade with the bararians the Chinese people mi&ht come to wish to be better acquainted. Why not? It is human nature. "4. Navigation of Chinaseas is free. No nation allows foreigners a free navigation of its rivers. Try it on the Loire, the Gisadaiquiver, the Po, t'he Daiepoer. Surely you would not be so unreasonable or unjust as to demand privileges for 'all1 the world' in China which the nations of Europe will not accord to us. "5. It requires no great amount of f orce, in the present w eakness of the Chinese Government, to dictate any terms bycutting off the supply of food and other necessaries to ekin, as you did before. But the question atill remains cui Soono Z WPho is to benefit?s Look at the Queen's Speech at the opening of the session of 1843. Then we were con. gratulated on havnDg dictated our own terms of peace to Chia, and wre were promised a great extension of our exposts to that country. The Manchester people threw up their caps and thought there was no end of rhe demand for cotton goods for china. [ vwas the only man w ho ventured to say a word the other way, and could refer you to a speech at the time in which I predicted that my good neighbours would be disappointed. WVell, we have had our owvn wray have increased our annual expenditure for ships, troops, and civil expenditure at Eongkong and the five ports2 about a quarter of a milion sterling, and our exports to China for the last four years have only averaged about l,250,000g., as near as possible what they were beore the w ar of 1840. There has been an immense increase in the traffic in opium. " 6. Of course after what I have said, my only answer to this must be, that make what peace you will the past bloodshed will be ineffective. It is a delusion to suppose that there is any want of commercial facilities in Chink There is no great empire where trade is so free. I wish we had one post in Austria, France, and Russia, and Spain, where the tariffs and shipping regulations were as liberal and as free as at the five treatyports in China. Nowvhere else can you send your manufactures at a 10 per cent, import duty (half of it not paid);and where you can carry food, beth cargo and ship are free even of port charges. NowhEere can you find such vast quantities of produce in the hands of native capitalists readyr to meet the most sudden and extraordinary demands. Last year the silk crop failed in Europe, and you sent for 30,00) or 40,000 bales extra from China, and got it. How lonE w,ould the native opulence last if we had possession o China? Look at poverb-rstricken India ! Compare Delhi with Nankin "8Nowt, in conclusion, let me ask friend Caird a question.. Does he believe that God rules this world upon a principler of retributive justice?s If so, as I am sure he does, thmen doesnotheasa good father sometimes tremble for the fate oft some 'third or fourth generation,' or, perhaps, a nearer one> on whoma the sins of their fathers in the East will be, visited 2" ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ary et
THE LUNDRILL COLLIERY EXPLOSION. (BY ELEarsio TELEGRG ?H.) The inquest on the 189 sufferers by this explesion: 'was brought to a close yesterday evening, when after an. elaborate summing-up by Mr. Badger, the coroner, of the 11 dayse evidence, the jury returned the following verdict:- " The jury are of opinion that Abraham Tarner, Thomas Grey, and others, met withtheir deathsfrom the efects consequent upon an explosion of earburettedhydrogen gas iithe Lundhll coalmine, on the 19th day of Febraary lastk but the immediate cause of such explosion there is not any oonclusive or sufficient evidence to show. The jury cannot come to the conclusion that it wag criminally negl'gent, but accidental; they, however, must condemn the laxity of the discipline and the non-observance of the rules allowed by the manager and his deputies at the LundhiU mine. The jury also beg to add that they fully concur in the rema.ks made by Ir. Wood, Mr. Elliott, and Mr. Woodhouse, that an improved system of ventilation and a better subdivision thereof is requisite to, be adopted, especially where day and night shiftsare worked; they also approve generally the remarks of those gentlemen in reference to safety lamps and other valuable suggestions made by them in their evidence yesterday. The jury are also glad that, although the subject of the education of the working 3miners was niot alluded to by tho before-mentioned gentlemen, yet that omission has been remedied in the able charge of the coroner, and the jury cannot too forcibly recommend t'hat every practical effort should be resorted to to raise the misers to a higher moral and mental condition than is now unhappily too prevalent. The jury also beg to report their admiration aad approval of the heroic co,ndut of Messrs Webster, Maddison, and others in their arduots andc dangerous efforts to recover the bodies. The jury cannot Coso their remarks on this awfully dksastrous accident without expressing their deep and heartfelt sympathy for the bereaved sufferers. They are of opinion: that the proprietors of the colliery were not cognizant of the laxity of the conduct of their underviewer, deputies, and workmen."

r FOiElGN INVT:ELLIGEN CE. FRANCE. (FRO3f OUR OWN COPRESPONDERDT.) iTbe fllowing appe:;ed; m our second edition of yes. tf Idv!-1 PARIS, TirURsDoA, MAY 21, 6 -m. I have already mentioned that the King of Bavaria wvas said to have undertaken, either at the instance of his Royal brother of Naples or spontaneously, to intervene as a friend between the latter and the Western Powers. I hear again from various sources that not only is such the case, but that the chances of an arrangement are fair. The Nord denies that the King of Bavaria has been "authorized,' to take any such step. It is very probable that there Is no official intervention, but it appears certain that he has had several confidential communications with King Ferdinand, and that he has broached the subject since his arrival. I cannot say what concessions the King of Naples is disposed to grant, or whether the friendly offices of King Maximilian will bring about a reconciliation. Two Councillors of State, namely, M. Cochelet and M. Leroi St. Almaud (brother of the late Marshal), are spoken of as likely to be promoted to the rank of Senators. This promotion will bring with it, of course, an augmentation of salary, as well as of the gold embroidery on the official costume-two considerations not to be despised. A third person is spoken of, viz., the Duke de Valmy. The Duke has hitherto been a leading member of the Fusionist party. The fusion, however, is on its last legs, and the chance of a restoration of the Count de Chambord seems further removed than ever. The nomination of the Duke has been often spoken of, and as often denied. I cannot say what grounds there are for its revival, beyond the fact that the Duke was seen in a fancy dress at the last ball at the Tuileries. The dress may have been the costume of his novitiate, his attendance in fancy costume being, perhaps, the preliminary step to his future appearance in the Senate. Ce n'est que le premier-pas qui coatte, and in such a case the distance between the Tuileries and the Palace of the Luxembourg is not so very great. The report will probably be once more denied by his friends of the Assemblee Nationale. The latest accounts from Goree announce that the Commander-in-Chief of the French settlement on the west coast of Africa has occupied, in the name of the French Government, the large tract of land called Dakkar, said to be one of the most important positions in SenegaL A letter from Turin of the 19th inst. states that in consequence of an accident which occurred to the Eimpress Dowager of Russia while driving in her carriage in the suburbs of Rome, but which fortunately produced no serious consequences, Her Majesty had sent a message by the telegraph to say that she should not arrive in Turin before Friday afternoon. The Emperor, the Empress, and the King of Bavaria left the Palace of Fontainebleau yesterday afternoon about 3 o'clock, and went in a char-4-banc to the rendezvous appointed for a stag hunt. The lateness of the hour and the heat not allowing the sport to take place, their Majesties, after a short collation, took a ride on horseback in the forest, and returned to the Palace a little before 9 o'clock. The Grand Duke Constantine embarked at Bordeaux at 1 o'clock yesterday on board the Reine Hortense. The Belgian papers contain the following:_ " Prince Alfred of England, second son of Qaeen Victoria, aged 13, arrived from Cologne at Brassels the day before Yesterday, at half-past 3 in the afternoon. The Duke de Brabant and the Count de Flandres, in plaia clothes, with some officers of their suite, went to the station to meet him. Sir T. W. Waller, English secretary of Lega. tion, and acting as Charge d'Affaires in the absence of Lord Howard de Walden, was likewise at the station. The Princes embraced each other affectionately, a military band striking up 'God save the Queen.' The Princes proceeded at once to the Palace, and in the evening there was a grand dinner at Court in honour of the young visitor. Afterwards the King and the Royal Family returned to Laecken, Prince Alfred remaining at the Palace at Brussels. The next morning the Prince went to Laecken to pay a visit to His hajesty." The Court of Cassation was yesterday once again called on to decide whether or not timebargainm at the Bourse are legal, the question having beensubmitted to it on appeal from a judgment of an inferior court in a case in which two persons, named Perri6 and Lacaze, and an agent de change named Delpech, were parties, and the slm in dispute between them was 20,GOlf. As it has done on numerous occasions, the Court gave judgment to the effect that time bargains at the Bourse are illegal when purchasers or sellers, at the moment of their bargains, have neither the intention nor the means of receiving or delivering the securities bargained for, and can consequently only liquidate the trasmaction by the payment of differences. According to the court, such transactions, under whatever name they may be disguised, constitute bonfidle gambling, or wagers on a rise or fall of public securities, and consequently are included in Arts. 419, 421, and 422 of the Penal Code. The annual exhibition of the Horticultural Society was opened yesterday at the Palace of Industry. The grand nave of the building has been transformed into a large garden, laid out with great taste, and the show surpasses in beauty those of previous years. The central part represents a large grassplot, having in the centre a picturesque mass of rockwork, surmounted by a group of eagles. The water from a fonltain within the rocks falls in a cascade amidst a quantity of heath, and, after falling into a basin, runs in a small rivulet through the other part of the garden, and is in one place crossed by a smaU rustic bridge, which produces a very picturesque effect. In addition to the flowers and shrubs of every description being exceedingly fine, the part of the building devoted to fruits and veuetables contains some admirable specimens. The heat has been intense in Paris for the last few days. The change has been sudden and is premature by at least three weeks. lndeed, the sun is as hot as in the month of July. The want of rain iS very generally felt in the country, and is anxiouily wished for. As yet, I believe, no great injury has been done, but a fall of rain would do much service to the young crops. This being Ascension Thursday, one of the great festivals of the Roman Catholic Church, the Bourse and the public oflices remain closed. AUSTRIA. (0OM OLT OWN CaORESPONDnT.) VIENNA, MAY 19. The Archduchess Sophia Frederica was so much better during the night of the 17th that the Emperor went in the morning of the 18th from Pesth to Adouy-a sniall town some 20 English miles down the river-where he and his numerous suite shot a vast quantity of waterfowl on property belonging to Count Edmund Zichy. The mornings of the 1I6thl and 17th and the afternoon of the 18th were dedicated to business, and the evenings of those days were passed by His Majesty in the company of the Empress, who has rarely quitted the Palace since her children have been ill. As you were yesterday informed, an official despatch stated that the elder of the little Archduchesses was suffering from " dysentery," but the medical world is of opinion that it would have been more correct had the bulletin spoken of " diarrhcea," to which complaint almost all children are more or less subject when cutting their teeth. According to a private letter from the Hungan capital the authorities had much H-u;n-l1ai'i --- " " more dainculty m persuading the " Bander-a" of the Ja7ygier and Cumanier to return to their homes than they had in inducing them to quit them. The men had been informed that they were to escort their Majesties to Jasz-Bereny on a certain day, and some time elapsed before they could be made to understand that they would have to appear 10 days later, the journey having been postponed on account of the illness of the Imperial children. Before the abolition of the Hungarian constitution the Jazygier and Cumanier, and more particularly the former, enjoyed great privileges, bat the only one they now possess is, that they can insist on being put into Hussar regiments when called on to render military service. The Jazygier, who are of Asiatic origin, are some 65,000 strong, and the population of Great and Little Cumania may be about 100,OCO souls. The former are Roman Catholics, but most of the latter are Protestants. Better horsemen and braver men are not to be found in the Austrian dominions. The fate of the address which the Hungarian nobles about 10 days ago presented to the Emperor is not positively known, bat it is whispered that it was at once returned to the Primate of Hungary, the person who delivered it into His Majesty's hands. It is probable that the Emperor and Emurees will begin their Hungarian tour on the 23d iust ; the route they intend to take is as follows :-On the 23d, from Buda to Jasz-I3ereny, the principal place of the Tazygier and numanier districts, where the reraains of Attila, the King of the Huns, are supposed to lie; on the 24th, after having heard mass, to Szegedin, by way of Ketskemet, Nagy-Kdr6s, aud Felegyhaza; on the 26th, to Gyula; on the 26th, to Grosswardein; on the 28th, from Grosswardein to Debreezin; on the 29th, to Tokay and Tarozal; on the 30th, from Tarozal to Tokay; thence by steamer down the Theiss to Szolnok, and back to Buda by railroad. After this, their first progress in Hungary, their Majesties will remain at Buda f r about a fortnight. The Ost-Deutsche Post has raceived some interesting particulars relative to the bandit Rosza Sandor, whose name is just now in the mouth of every Hungarian. In 1832 RoszaO deserted from the regiment of Hussars called CC The Emperor's Own," and since that year he has been the terror of all those persons who have had to travel across the immense plains which we in the neighbourhood of Czegled, Ketskemet, and Szegedin. In 1848 and 1849 he vwas the chief of the guerilla band which committed such atrocities in St. Thomas, Temerin, and other places inhabited by Servians. In 1852 Rosza, being hard pressed by the Gendarmerie, aldressed himself to the magistracy of Szegedin and to the authorities of the Comitat, and expressed his willingness to surrender himself on cert&in conditions. No notice was taken of Rosza's offer, but he wits soon after so hotly pursued by the thieftakers that he is said to have passed three days in the saddle before he succeeded in shaldng them ofr Roaza was so tired- of the roving life he had led for so many years that he resolved to throw himself on the mercy of the Emperor, and when he was taken the following articles were found in his possession :-A petition to the Emperor, which was to have ben presented at Eis-Telek, at place close to Szegedin, a new Hungarian dress, and a " sBZ' (a Idnd of pelisse), richly ornamented with flowers worked in silk of different rolours. The fine new clothes were to have been worn by the robber when he presented himself (on horseback) to their Majesties. Strange to say, no ieparate and direct charge has been made by any )ne against Rosza. All Hungary believes that the nan is one of the moat daring highwaymen that pver lived, but no individual has yet appeared who s prepared to swear that he has been robbed by rim. Rosza, who is some 45 years of age, is a -.iddle-sized man, and bears about him traces of she tremendous wear and tear to which he has been >.xposed duiing the greater part of hia life. un the uithi their Majesties gave audience to two envoys sent by the Hospodar of Servia to congratulate them, and at a lter hour they admittad to their presence the Pasha of Belgrade, who was the bearer of the compliments and good wishes of the Sultan. The three envoys above-mentioned, and some of the members of the deputation sent bv the Voivodina and Banat, dined with their Majesties. On Saturday, the 23d inst., the British Minister at this Court will give a grand dinner, in honour of Queen Victoria, to many high nobles, statesmen, and generals. The Volksf-end, the organ of the Jesuits, announces that a regular university is to be established at Innspruck. Formerly only law was taught at the high school of the capital of the Tyrol, but professors of medicine and theology have now been appointed. All the teachers of theology belong to the order founded by Ignatius Loyola. The Protestant Jesuits in Bavaria are endeavouring to introduce "catechizing among grown persons." The sense of an ordinance published by the Supreme Consistory on the subject is that all those persons who have been taught in tie Sunday and holyday schools shall, when grown up, be obliged to continue to visit them. It is even said that the police wiU be requested to punish those persons who may neglect their religious duties. The Lutheran clergymen in Wurtemberg are resolved, if possible, to iatroduce what they arepleased to call " stricter church discipline," and the laymen are so incensed at their conduct that they openly accuse them of being " masked Roman Catholics." A day or two since the Count de Chambord retumed to Frohsdorf, an estate which he has at no great distance from this city. His Royal HighneEs passed through Switzerland on his way back from Venice. The crops in Hungary, Moravia, and Bohemia look remarkably weLl, but they are less promising in Jpper Austria. From the other provinces no information on the subject has reached me. Fears were entertained that the silkworms would suffer from the cold weather which there was in Lombardy a short time ago, but we now learn that they were not injured. The Vienna Credit Bank is about to establish a fire and life insurance. The Commissioners have returned fromJassy to Bucharest. SPATH. (som OR w OWN ORREPOmENT.) MIADRID, MAY 17. The disagreeable incident of the arrest of five English sailors belonging to Her Majesty's ship Curlew at Malaga, of which I gave you fuU details in my letter of the 8th instant, may be considered, I think, as good as settled, and we may daily expect to learn the release of the men in question. The Spanish Government, it is only fair to say, has shown every disposition to have the matter arranged in conformity with justice, and with the wishes of the English Minister at Madrid; and, although the Malaga authorities are unquestionably open to a charge of exaggerated zeal and undue severity, as well as of cruel neglect in leaving their prisoners more than two days without food, yet some allowance must be made for the habit of harshness likely to be induced among the local powers by the rufflanly character of the Malaguenos, who in their addiction to quarrels and the use of the knife are surpassed, it is said, only by the still more riotous and bloodtbirsty population of the town of Motril, in the same province. Meanwhile, the fact is, that five English sailors wil have passed nearly or quite a month in a filthy Spanish gaol for an offence which a fine of 5s. would have expiated in England; and the moral of the tale is, that British blue-jackets ashore in Spanish ports will do well to drink little and skylark not at all. After 15 days wasted in getting through the tedious preliminary business entailed by their complicated and clumsy mode of constituting themselves, the Spanish Cortes of 1857 have at last held a sitting of fome interest-that of yesterday in the Senate. This wsas anticipated, and at 1 o'clock the galleries began rapidly to fill. At half-past 1 the portly form of the Marquis do Vilumna, President of the Senate, moved up the centre of the chamber, and after some formal business had been transacted the bell was rung, and the sitting was declared to have commenced. The Minister of State, the deliberate and ponderous Senor Pidal, in full uniform, all gilding and glitter, ascended the tribune and read the project of law by which the Cortes are to authorize the ratification of the frontier treaty with France. The majority of the Ministers were in their places, two being in the other House. On the Opposition bencheswere several ProgresistaSenators, San Miguel, Ferrer, Collado, &c.; also the Vicalvarist Generals Serrano and Ros de Olano. O'Donnell's arrival-his first appearance in these Corteswas looked for with intense interest, for on him were chiefly founded the spectators' hopes of a hot debate. He placed himself on the bench corres%ponding with that of the Ministers, but on the other side of the house, and just opposite to Narvaez. A secretary read the proposed address in reply to the Queen's speech, and sundry amendnments which had been presented upon it. The amendments moved by General Calonge took precedence in discussion. The General rose and made an able and carefullyprepared speech, courteous in form, but which, in substance, was a severe and even a violent attack npon the authors of the military movement of 1851. He declared that the " oblivion of the past," proclaimed in the Queen's speech and in the Ministerial reply, should not include Impunity for those chiefs who had conspired to bring about a revoluti,n thatnothing justified, andwho had drawn their sworls and led their menagainst theirown brothers and companions in arms. Referring to an expremsion used in the Constituent Cortes by O'Donnell, who once said that the 1854 revolution had been the work of a dozen hombres de cormcmn (men of courage), he declared that the worat calamity that could befell the countxy waS to be at the mercy of the hombbres de corazon, always few in number, who proposed to regenerate it, and he demanded that the men guilty of that insurrection should be brought to tria and punished. This was the substance of his speech, which was concise and bold, and which produced a considerable sensation. It was speaking I I i i * The Ilungarlans always put the family name first; "Sandor" (Alexander) is tJa mWas ohgUtIa name, plainly and to the point. The Vicalvari t Generals listened attentively to the philippic thus launched at them, and O'Donnell was busy noting down his accuser's words. Don Ramxon Narvaez rose to reply, and his clear strong voice and remarkably distinct enunciation rendered him audible in every nook of the chamber. He declazed himself the partisan of a conciliatory policy; upon such principles had he accepted office, and to their support his colleagues were all agreed. EIis desire was to put an end to the dissensions which had broken up the Conservative party. He threw the blame of the events of 1854 upon those Governments whose misconduct had led to them, and he vindicated thereby the insurrection of the Campo de Guardias. He energetically blamed General Calonge for demanding the trial of " most worthy generals " (digniimos genercdes), who had defended the Qaeen and had created the situation in virtue of which the Senate Is now assembled; and he reminded him that he himself (Calonge), who was so forward to condemn military insurrections, had taken part in that of 1843, the same as he (Narvaez) had done. He concluded by an exhortation to union, for the sake of the welfare of Spain. This speech of General Narvaez is sufficiently remarkable to excite much comment. The flattering way in which he expressed himself with respect to the Vicalvarists is urged by many as a proof of weakness, and of a desire to conciliate O'Donnell and his friends. On the other hand,his declaration of censure on the Governments that were in power for some time previously to the revolution of 1854 (to some of which Governments belonged two of his present colleagues-Lersundi and Moyano) is a sorb of! defiance to the Polacos, to the Bravo Murillo fraction, and to others whom he thus rejects from the ranks of the Moderado party. It is thought that O'Donnell will speak to-morrow, and much rmriosity is felt to see how he will receive the olive branch thus publicly held out to him. When General Narvaez sat down Cantero, the Former Minister of Finance, rose and attacked the Government on two points-the Mir~s loan, and tbe repeal of the desamtizacion. Senor Barzanallana sttempted to justify the former by the high price cf mioney at the time of its contraction; and, as re,arded tbe law of desamortizacion, he declared his belief that it had been of no advantage to the Treamury, and that it was contrary to the principles of .morality, as well as to the conditions of the conordat; also, that In a short time the Government would submit to the Cortes its views upon that mubject. Finally, in reply to a question, he denied 'hat he had ever thought of settling the claims of the holders of coupon certificates.

STATE OF TRADR. MANERESTEEt, Iy 22. The demnand for manufactures has been on a limited scale since Tuesday, as weU as previously, and there has been no new feature in the market this morning. Sales have been effected with difficulty where producers have been unwilling to accept lower prices, and the disposition of buyers is evidently to limit their purchases to the immediate require. mentsof the day. The result is a constant accumulation of almost all kinds of cloth in stock, and a consequent weakening of prices. There has been rather me)re inquiry for some descriptions of cloth, but it has not led to business. The price of the raw material has been well sustained ia Liverpool, notwithstanding arrivals to the extent of more than 200,000 bales during tha week, and, though this firmness has probably helped te sustain the value of goods, the large arrivals have, no don'bt the effect of increasing the caution manifested by shippsrs as well as by the home trade in this market. The busiaess in domestics has been on a less scale than it was last wesk, and the unremunerative rates obtainable for such sales as are made have increased the disposition to reduco the production of the looms in these goods. In printers and shir :- ings there is also an over supply, and those wao cannot afford to hold stocks, as well as those who fejl it unsafe in the present artificial state of prices, are taking such means as are in their power to lessen thsir responsibilities as far as it is possible. In yarns spinn3rs have been wiling to accept offers this week which they would have declned last week, and the gregate basiness in these goods, as well as in cloths, hasbeen limited in amonnt, and runsatisfactory as regards prices. The tenden.iy in both branches of the market Is against sellers. cbaem mittee of the ociation for obtaining a better supply of cotton are continuing their exertions to force this sebieut upon public attention, and at a meeting held on Thmsday Bazr.Baley, the chairman, said we werenov paying 2td. to 2Nd. per lb. above the ordinary cost of American cott;n which amounted to not less than 10,000,000. upon the c m- sumaption of lastyear.lf the crop of thecoming atomnshonld be anything like adequate to the wants of the trade of which there is some hope held out In a latter read fron Henry Ashworth, who is now in the United States, it is evident that a great reduction in present values mnnt take place before long, and it is probably thefearof this readjustment which is to some extent preventirg sales in cl ith and yarn at the present moment. It will be learat with satisfaction that a deputation from merchani in Liverpool was present at the meeting, and that cordial co-operation betweea these two towns on this queston is Ukoly to aesult.
I MONBY-MABKBTandCITyl TELL.GNECV t'riday Evening. The funds opened this morning at the final quotations of yesterday, but subsequently, owing to an increase in the demand for money, they experienced renewed depression. Towards the close, however, there was again a tendency to firmness3 The first transactioa in Consols were at 93T to 1, whence, in consequence of a large sale, they dedlined to 943i. The closing quotations were 934 to i for money, and 931 to i for the 4th of June. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 921 to a; New Three per Cents., 92i to ; India tock, 220 to 222; India Bonds, 9s. to 4s. discount ; ExchequerBonds' 98i to 99; and Exchequer-bills, June, is. to 3s. premium; March, 3s. to 6s. premium. The rate for advances on Government securities on.the St,ck Exchange to-day was 6& per cent. In the discount-market and at the Ba the demand was active. Foreign securities were heavy, and prices towards the close exhibited au increased tendency to depression. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 94k, 94, and 94j; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, at 101I and i. The general transactions comprised -Chilian Six per Cents., 102k; Mexican, for the account, 22a andI; Portuguese Three per Cents., 46; Sardinian FLve per Cents., for the account, 91t ; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 41i, {! i, and t; the Certificates of Coupon, not funded, 64 and *; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97., IX the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates upon Holland were a shade higher. On Hamburg there was no alteration, but Paris was a trifle lower than last post. In the corn-market this morning there was a recovery frbm the decline of between Is. and 2s. which occurred on Monday last. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows inactivityand a tendencyto lowerprices. IThe final quotations of the French Three per Cent. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 95c. for money, and 68f. 85c. for the end of the month, showing a further decline of au eighth. The Istamboul, which is announced as having made the run from Melbourne in 79 days, has brought gold valued at 180,0001. She is the first vessel of the Australian Auxiliary Steam Clipper Company, and her voyage both out and home has furnished a further illustration of the value of adopting clipper ships for that service aided by a sufficient amount of steam-power to prevent delay from calms. The gold-vessels which are still ont, although they sailed previously to the Ista-mboul, are the South Carolina, which left on the 3d of February with 82,0001.; the Sydenham, on the 10th of February, with 125,0001.; the Mormng Star, on the 12th of February, with 193,5001.; the Medway, on the 17th of February, with 72,0001.; and the Donald M'Kay, on the 20th of February, with 48,0001. The amount actually overdue is therefore 520,5001. As the demand for the Bank of France is now being supplied by arrivals which are taking place from Russia, as well as those from New York and California, it is inferred that a very considerable oreion of this total will be carried to the Bank of Rt tland. The prospectus has been issued of the Smyrna Railway, with a guarantee of 6 per cent. from the Tarkish Government. The line, which will be 70 miles in length, is to connect the port of Smyrna with Aidin, the principal internal entrepot of the commercial productions of Aia Minor; and the proposed capital is 1,200,0001., in 201. shares. For the trading interests of this country it is one of the most important worksrthat could be constructed, since it has been only the total absence of economical means of transport that has hitherto limited the supplies the region is capable of producing. Whether the promoters have chosen the right time for introducing it may, however, be doubted, since the public, instead of looking to the question (of intrinsic merits, have become balndly attached to Government guarantees, and a Turkish guarantee of 6 per cent. will not at the moment yield a premium. As far as the natural field for railway enterprise is concerned, there is no quarter where all the requisites for success are united in greater force, the richness of the territory and the extent and character of the population being alike favourable. The grand recommendation urged on behalf of the illimitable Russian military railway scheme was, that a portion of the lines would promote the carriage of wheat to the Black Sea ports, but, according to the statement of Mr. Consul Sanderson, published by the Board of Trade in November last, " from the greater proximity of Anatolia to the corn-purchasing countries of Europe it might, but for the want of means of transport, supply grain upon terms much cheaper that those of the ports of Southern Russia." Hitherto the conveyance has been entirely carried on by immense numbers of mules and camels. The present population of Smyrna is stated at 160,000, and that of Aidin at 60,000, while the annual export and import trade of the port is said to have reached 5,000,0001. One-fourth of the shares are to be subscribed in Turkey, the guarantee is for 50 year-s, and the profits over 7 per cent. are to be divided with the Government. The bar silver brought by the last West India packet has been sold at 6lid., showing an advance of . The produce-markets during the week have been steady, with transactions generally of moderate extent, in consequence of the limited quantities offering and the reduced stocks of goods held. Many vessels long delayed by contrary winds are close at hand, so that increased supples3 may be shortly expected. In sugar a very large business has been transacted at prices fully equal to the highest attained durig the month, while floating cargoes, of which no less than II or 12 are reported, have in some cases realized fully Is. more. This improvement is attributed to the continuance of large clearances for home use, the further diminution in stocks, and the favourable result of the Dutch Trading Company's sale on the 18th inst., when 100,000 baskets of Java went at I to 3 guildera above the valuations, or 4s. to 5s. advance upon the prices of last March. At the public sale of Mauritius to-day the soft brown descriptions brought less than had been anticipated. Clean quahties of coffee are agaain firmer, owing to the absence -of arrivals. G tood ative Ceylon has sold at 64s. 6d. Nothing of importance has occurred in foreign. Cocoa advanced 3s. to 4s. in the early part, but is now rather quiet. Rice appears to be in less demand, although prices remain without alteration. Where holders of saltpetre have shown a disposition to realize, prices have been in favour of the buyers, the rather large arrivals, including some parcels from America, tending to unsettle tlbe market. The quarterly sales of indigo concluded on the 20th inst., without further change in quotations, and 10,091 chests were nearly half sold during their progress. The tea-market has been flat, but with the exception of green teas there is no great quantity offering. For common congou there still appear to be buyers at is. 0td. per lb. The prospectus has been issued of the Great Welsh Union Slate Company, with a capital of 250,0001., in 51. sbar's. The object is towork certain quarries in the county of Merioneth, North Wales. The report of the Oriental Bank, issued preparatory to their meeting on fonday, states that after the payment of a dividend of 11. S3., and a bonus of 10s. (equal to 7 per cent. upon the capital for the half-year), 8,0621. will remain to be carried forward to next year's account. A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Thomas Biggs and Son, of Broken-wharf, Upper Thamesstreet, who lately failed, was held to-day, when a statement of accounts was presented by Messrs. Parrington and Ladbury, showing debts and liabilities amouinting to 20,7601., and assetsof 11,3691. An offer of 8s. in the pound was submitted, the last instalment to be secured; but an adjournmnent took place to ascertain if it is possible for the entire am.unt to be guaranteed. The liabilities of Messrs. M'Alpin and Nephew, whose failure was announced yesterday, are stated at about 20,0001. The assets are estimated to yield 104. iu the pound. The retnrn from the Bank of England for the week ending the 16th of Mlay gives the following results when compared with the previous week:- Pttblic deposits ... ... ,651,924 ...

A PP EA LS. TTOUTSR OF LORDS. MAY 22. CAMPBELL V. CAMPBELL. This was the petition of Alexsander Uaipbell, merchant, of 38, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly, praying that hiu marriage with Maria, bis now wife, should be declared void, and that he shonld be allowed to marry again. Mr. Wylde and htr. Blackburn were counsel for the petitioner, and Mr. Macqueen represented Mrs. CanmpbetL When the canso was called on for hearing the agent for ms. Campbell said that a petition on ber behalf had been presented to the effect that Mr. Camphell should allow her a sufficient sum to defend herself. Art offer of 301. had been made by SMr. Campbell, but that Was nOt sufficient, for the ccunsels fees alone amounted to that sum. There were then the fees of the House and the expenses of bringing up witnesses, which Mrs. CampbeU was not in a position to pay herself. Under these circumstances it was hoped that their Lordships wvould make an order for a sufflnoent allowance to to be made her. After some discussion it was agreed tbat a sum of 5lO. should be allowed her. Mr. WYLDE then proceeded to open the case of the net. tioner, who down to June in last year had been a merchant in Australia. Tn June 1842, he married a MiRs Maria Martin, of Melbourne, his present wife, and by ber he had six children. From that period until Mrs. Campbell left Australia for England, in 1856, they had lived together upon the most affectionate terms. Having determined to leave Australia altogether, Mr. Campbell sent his wife over by herself ho having been unavoidably detained by business. On the voyage Mrs. Camnpbell made the anquaintance of a Mr. Garston, an officer in the army, who paid her a great deal of attention. Oni her arrival in England she went to some apartmenta which had been taken for her use by M.r. Smith, her husband's partner. Mr. Garston accompanied her there and also to other lodgings, which she took subsequently, in Craven-street, Strand. Occurrences would be detail d to their Lordships that would leave no doubt upon their minds as to the act of adultery having been committed. On Mr. Campbell's arrival in England in June, 1856, he took a house in Porchester.terr,Bavs water, where they remained for a short period. is. Campbell, however, for some reason left her husband's house, and went on a visit to a Mrs. Egan, who resided at the same honse in Craven-street in which Mrs. Campbel had first taken lodgings. There again the adultery would be proved to have taken place. Mr. Campbell's suspicions being aroused, he made inquiries, cnd the result was the conviction in his mind that his wife had been unfaithful to him. From that period he had not seen her and had immediately brought an action in the Court a"of Queen's Bench against Mr. Garston, when he obtained a verdict with 5001. damages. A divorce a mnssed et thoro was obtained in the Consistory Court, and the petitioner trusted that after their Lordships had heard the evidence he should adduce they would grant his petition. The following evidence was then given:- The service of the bill upon Mrs. Campbell was proved by the clerk of the petitioner's attorney, who, on cross-exasnination, said that they had been unable to recover the damages in the civil action. The verdict had been taken by consent, but there had been no understanding that the damages should not be recovered. Mr. C. Falconer said he was managing director of a bank in Melbourne. He hod known Mr. CampbeU for 26 years. He was present at the marriage in 1842. He knew Mr. and Mrs. Campbell after their inarriage. Ho was very intimute. He continued to reside in Australia until 1852. They lived during all that period most happily. They had six children. Cross-exainined.-The petitioner was 50 years of age. Mrs. CampbeU was about 10 when she was married. Captain Green said he had known Mr. and Mrs Canpball for eight years. He was on intimate terms with them; he believed them to be a very happy couple. He was the captain of the vessel in which Mrs. Campbell had come over in April, 1856. After MIr. Campbell came over he caUed at their house. MIr. Garston was there. That was at No. 9, Craven-street, Strand. Some remark was made about Mr. Gnadrstoanr nig Mrs. Campbell a rather stiff glass of brandy Cross-examined.-Mrs. Campbell was in very good health at the time she started on her voyage, but she became very il during the voyage. Mr. Garston was very attentive to her. The attentions were commenced before her illness. She had a miscarriage. He should not have liked to have seen his wifo receive such attentions from another. He had written her a letter, stating that he did not think her conduct wrong on board, although she was gay. Harriet Nunn.-I was cook for some years to a Mr. Bell, residing in Bloonifield-row, Paddington. He let his house, and in April Mrs. Campbell came there. There was some of Mr. Garston's luggage mixed with hers. Mr. Garston came with Mrs. Campbell. He stayed to dinner and went away in the evening. The next day he came again, and a bed was made for him in Mrs. Campbell's dressing-room. I understood he slept there. I did not make the bed. There were two other rooms he could have had, but Mrs. CampboU wished him to sleep there. He stayed in the house about a fortnight. He passed his time with Mrs. Campboll. They dined and breakfasted together. I have seen Mr. Garston put his anus round mrs. Campbell's neck. That was in the ktchen. They stayed three weeks. I knew Mary Ann Agar. I saw her and she said that if Mr. (Caphell ecame I was not to say that Mr. Garston had stayed in the house. Mary Wylde.-I was housekeeper at 9, Craven-street, Strand. It is a lodginghouse. Mr. Campbell come there on the 2d of May last year. She brought six children. On the following day a gentleman came and applied for a bed. I said there was not one at No. 9, but there was a room he could have at 41, which belonged to the same landlady He went away and returned at 11 at night with Mrs. Campbel. I sat up until 12 o'clock, when I wont up into the room to ask if the gentleman was going over to his room. Mrs. Campbell was sitting on a chair near the fire, and YMr. Garston was lying across her feet. Mrs. Campbell's hair was disordered. I asked if he was going over to his room. They said no; they had something to talk about, and a bed must be made - ap for him on the sofa in the sitting-room. The next morn- ing I went into Mrs. Campbell's bedroom and heard Mr. Garston's voice in her bed. Iis trousers were in the sitting-room. Mrs. Campbell was in her nightdress.

LA W REPORT. COURT OF CHANCERY. LpzcouN's-r.. MAY 22. _. IN RE NVOODBURN'S TRUSTS. (Before ae LoRDs JusTicEs of APPxAL.) .This was an appeal from a decision of the Master of the Rolls, who had ordered a trustee, who had paid money into court, in a manner which in his HoRour's opinion was vexatious and oppressive, to pay the costs of a petition for payment out of tGe money the parties entitled. Their Uordships 8aid, at the opening of the case, that they would not take upon themselves without the assistance of the Lord Chancellor to decide the point of jurisdiction as to the powerto order the payment of costs, the Trustee Relief Act, under the provisions of which the money was paid in, being wholly silent upon the point. Tbe discussion was therefore confined to a detail of the aleged facts, which were alike contradictory aud uninteresting. Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Toller appeared for the appellant, the trustee; Mr. RoundeDll Palmer and Mr. Shapter, for the respondents, were not called upon. Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUCE said that, in his opinion, this case was one of flagrant and scandalous oppression. Persons in humble life were entitled to a reversionary sum of less than 6001., and when the tenant for life died the persons, two in number, applied to the trustee of the fund lor a division. It was now ascertained that they were the persons entitled. They gave to the trustee proof which, in his Lordship's opinon, ought to have been satisfactory to a reasonasle person. If the trustee was not satisfied he should have said what more he wanted, but he did not. A long correspondence, an almost unexampled correspondence, ensued, and atone time the trustee expressed himself as substantiaUy satisfied. The dispute, however, went on, the parties be. came inflamed, temper was exhibited, and threats were used, till at last, upon a flimsy and frivolous objection, payment was refused, and the money was paid into court. The Master of the Rolls made an order that the respondents should receive the money, and that the trustee should pay the costs personally. A more proper or more righteous order could not be made, if the Court had jurisdic. tion to make it. If there was such jurisdiction, it was wisely and wholesomely exercised. If every distribution of reversionary property were to be attended by such expense as was incurred in this case it would amount to a virtual confiscation. If this Court has Jurisdiction over the costs of the petition of appeal, it wiU be dismissed, as it deserved to be, with costs. The question of jurisdiction, however, had been raised, and their Lordshipshbadagreed to hear the merits of the case, and only to seek the assistance of the Lord Chancellor, either ittsn alone or in full court of appeal on this particular questmon. Lord Justice TurxEss gave no opinion on the guestion of jurisdiction; but upon the merits of the case he had no doubt whatever. The view of his learned brotber was also b's own. If the Court had no jurisdiction to order a trustee to pay the costs personally in suoh a case it might be necessary to apply to Parliament for an amendmnent of the Trustee Relief Act. The petition of appeal would be dismissed and, if Possible, with costs. Lord JusticeKyriGnT BRRuCE.-Some one of the counsel engaged im this case will present our respects to the Lord Chancellor and ask his Lordship to appoint a day, and let him be told that we have heard the merits, and are both of us of opinion that if the costs can be given against the trustee they should be so given both of the original petition and of the appeal. EX rARTE BOYD, IN RE THE ROYAL BA.NK OP AUSTRALIA. The petition of appeal in this case was only part heard. Mr. Malins and AIr. Roxburgh are for the appellant; Mr. Rochfort Clarke, of the common law bar, is for contributories - Mr Bacon and Mr. Karslake support the decision of Vice. dhancellor Stuart.
VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS, MAY 2?. (Befor VYe-Chance:lor Sir RB T. KINDE RSLEY.) The COURT was occupied during the greater part of the day in hearing a motion which stood over from the last day of sitting, but which involved no question of public interest. SCLATER V. COTTUM. This came on upon three motions to vary the chief clerk's certificates in respect of certain allowances olsimed by the surviving trustees of the settlement of Mr. and Mrs. Cottam, dated in 1801. Mr. GLasse, Mr. Swanston, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Solater, Mr. Ward, and Mr. G. L. Russell appeared for the several parties The case Is still proceeding. (Before Vice-Chancellor Sir J. STUART.) Mr. B. W. E. FORISTEZ moved that the defendant might be ordered to pay 2,9081. 16s. to the plaintiff within four days of the service of the order. By an order of the Courb the defendant had been ordered to pay to the plaintiffthe sum of 3,0001., and in pursuance of that order the plaintiff had issued a fi. fa. against the defendant, under which the plaintiff had recovered the sum of 911. is. The object of the present application was to obtain an order for the payment by the defendant of the balance of the sum of 3,0001., in order that if he made default in complying with the order the plaintiff might issue an attachment against him. At common law, where a ft. fa. fails to satisfy a demand, a capias ad satisfaciendum may issue in respect of the balance, and the learned counsel said it was understood that the Lord Chancellor had it in view to issue an order for the purpose of assimilating the practice in equity to that at law. The VICE-CHANCELLOR made an order referring it to his chief clerk to aseertain and certify the amount due to the plaintiff, and direct the defendant to pay the amount to the plaintiff within 10 days after the date of the certificate. TROTMAIN V. HINOLEY, This was a motion for an injunction to restrain the defendants from making any anchors according to the plaintiff's invention for the construction of anchors, and rom selling the same, and also to restrain the defendants from affiing the plaintiff's trade mark of " Trotman's atent," or any imitation thereof, on anv such anchors. vthe last day of last term an interim order for an injunction was made by the Vice-Chancellor, and the action came on to-day, but after a short discussion it was arranged that it should stand over until Wednesday next, with a view to an amicable arrangement between the parties. Mr. Mains and Mr. Cracknall appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Craig, Mr. Renshaw, and Mr. Elindmarsh, of the common law bar, for the defendants.
COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, WESTMINSTER. MAY 22. CIUAPMAN V V-N -n1 VAN TOLL V. CILAPrMTAX (,Nzuzzgs in Banco, before Lord CAMPBELL and JVtus4ic COIERIDGE, ERLE, and CROMPTON.) mr -. XHESIGER (with whom was Mr. Hawkins) moved for rules to show cause why there should not be new trials in both the above actions, which were tried before Lord Campbell in this court at the sittings after last term. The first action was brought by Mr. Chapman, an attorney, against Mrs. Van Toll, to recover a bill of costs, amounting to 481. 2s. 6d., in which the jury, under the direction of Lord Campbell, found a verdict for the defendant, upor. the ground that the plaintiff's services had been wholly use'ems to her. The second action was an action by Mrs. Van Toll against Mr. Chapman for negligence in respect of the same matters, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, with 6441. damages. The learned counsel now moved for new trials in both cases, on the ground of misdirection and that the verdicts were against the evidence ; and, in the second action, on the additional ground that the damages were excessive. It appeared that in 1852 a bond for 1,0001. had been given by a Captain Julius Roberts to Mrs. Van Toll, and in 1855 she instructed Mr. Chapman to apply to him for the money. Mr. Chapman wrote to Captain Roberts, but, as his letter was not answered, a writ was issued and served on the 14th of July, 18i5. Captain Roberts then wrote this letter to Mrs. Van Toll: - " July 1, 1855. AMnadaYour prceedings bave rather aonished me knowing as you dothat you have reoeived at meveral times ever and atsve yoinr interest the 14th of 450. and theretere aue that is legally canirg to yot is the difference of LtI 00., viz.. 3. This sum I lhdi be ready to fand over to you t chrogh my tors. upon yd r gta vg wa d rer receipt for the fll amount. Im prepared to bhjw tht sc hb ,hangved herattou, e I am, Madam, trulyours "ims Van Toll, the Green, Richmond." UUSP/BRS An appearance was subsequently entered and time to plead given till the mnonth f November, when issue was joineed; and on the 14th of December the cause was in the paper for trial. It was then agreed that the cause should be referred to the Mastr, who certified that 7411. was due to Mrs. Van Toll. In the month of February Mrs. Van Tol changed her attorney, and Captain Roberts became bankrupt, but had "no assets." At the trial it was insisted that Mr. Chapman had been guilty of negligence, which deprived him of his costs, on th ground that his services had been whouly useless. The learned counsel here read a note of his Lordship's summing up to the jury, who therefore found a verdict for the defendant. His Lordship added that othe verdict was a salutary decision, and it would show that it was not only the duty, but the interest of attorneys to avai themselved of this salutary enactment, which enabled parties, without delay or expener, to have matters of account rdjusted."1 The learned counsel said his Lordship had forgotten that an action was about to be tried aganst the attorney for negligence. Lord CAMPBELL said he had not forgotten it, for he did not know of the action, It came on for trial on a scbse. quent day. Sir F. TnESIGEth-On the Monday. Lord CAciPBELL said that both Mr. Chapman and his agent, Mr. relder, said they were "not andare of the enactment." Sir F. TisnaoEen said be thought the words were that "it did not occur to them." Lord CAMPBELL said both gentlemen showed great candour; they said they were "not aware of the enactment." Sir F. TESIGsra then contended that the damages in the second action, 6441.., were olearly excessive. Captain Roberts had been arrested on his wed ding morning, and his father. in-law had been induced to pay a large sum on his accountbut beyond that it was not shown that Roberts in 15 ha bore than 501.., which be bad paid for lodgings, and a sum which there was some loose evidence to show he had drawn Out of an insurance society. But the main question was his Lordshp's d fietion to the tury, which the learned counsel said hwaed eard considerable alarm in the profession, The misdirection complained of was that there was such negligence on the part of Cha man as disentitled him to recover his costs, and rendered hrmliable to an action for neg. lBgence. Lord CAMyB3ELL said he had left the question of negligencoeto the jury. Sir F. THEsscGES said that juries were utterly Ignorant of what constituted negligence in an attorney, and would take the direction of the judge, L,ord CAMIPBELL mid he had no diffculty in saying now that the attorney ought to have proceeded under the third section. HId he done so he might in three or four days, have got an order for the payment of the money. The question, however, was very important, and he (Lord Campbell) was anxious to have his decision reviewed. Sir F. THMUsGERt said that nothing short of gross negligence would deprive an attorney of costs ; hut the jury were not told what negligence or gross neghigence was, LQrd V&AxrBzuL sad he told the jury to consdder whether there bad been gross negligence; and the jury, after they bad begun to deliberate, asked how long the Act had passed. --gy. Sir F.THmSIGE then contended that the case wasnot one contemplated by the Act, which referred only to the cases 'where "1the matter in dispute consists wholly or in part of matters of mere account which cannot conveniently be tried in the ordinary way." Why could not tho present action have been cOnveniently tried in the ordinary way ? Suppose the defenldant pleaded payment, he must ~prove a either by the production of receipts or personally, he being examined as a witness; and the plaintiff mright wish have hm exposed to a public cross-examination in open couirt rarther than have the matter tried in private before an Air. JutSice ERLI said, suppose there is an acion on a bond, with a plea of payment -have I jurisdiction to force the parties to a referei.ie ? Lord CAmPBrLL said it was a very fit case to be considered. The learned counsel might take a rule on all the points, which must be specified in the rule. Rule nism granted. THE QUEEN V. LLOYD. In this case a rule had been granted calling upon William Pritchard loyd to show cause why a criminal information should not be fiJed against him for an offer to bribe a person niamed Thomas to vote for a person named Willia~ms as Poor Law auditer ofadistric in North Walesa Sir F. KELLY (with whom -was Mrx. D. D. Keane) now said he appeared on the part of Mr. Lloyd, who in his affidavit bad stated facts which if it should be necessary to go into hrh matter would show that there had been some mnisn apprehension, and that there was no intention on the part of Iloyd to commit the offence of offering a pecuniar consideration to Thomas for his vote. It appeared there were two candidates for the office of auditor,-Thomas and Williams, for the latter of whou Lloyd was interestd; and he had offered Thomas thav he would deposit a sum of moneyfor the payment of hisexpenesif bewould withdrawt and ceasetobea candidate. I en offer was illegal, and amnounted to an indictable offence The Poor Law Bard bad done only their duty in brinve the case gito cort, bhut, as it was now ade knownainwl and the country genealy that ahclh pruceedings ought to be above and beyond all suspicion and as r. L,loyd had expressed his regret, and had s thown himself on the forbearance of the Pcor Law Board and of this Court, he (Sir F. RlKey) trustd the Court wouldc allow the rtle to be discharged on ru.

SIR EDWAR'iAD CONIROY, BART. Sir F. TnESIGsR (with wtom was Mx. Serjeaut Pigott) moved for leave to ile additional affidavits in this case, en the part of the prosecution. Lord CAMPBELL, said hebelieved the practice was not to grant such leave till cause was shown; it was difficult tosay whether the application was a fit one, unless the Courthear the evidence on boath sides. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE -Is it new matter? Sir F. TilEs mt said itwas, and very important. Lord CAMPBELL Saill the learned counse would take leave at his peril, for if it was not new matter it could not be used at the hearing. What was the new matter? Sir F. TroEsiGER saiC Sir Edward Conroy had made an affidavit in which he said the prosecutor's (Mr. Barker's) conduct towards him at the -vestry meeting at Hursa h been rude and offensive, and sug ested an untruth. The prosecutor wished to show thatsthere had been no such con- duct. The application was made under the 45th section ofthe Common w aw Procedure Act, 1854. Mr. H. HILp, who appeared for Sir Edward Couroy, aid he did not admit that the matter was new. Lord CAMPBsLL said that in this stage of the proceedings the Court would not make any order. Application refused. THE QUErEN V. THE DIRECOrOES AND GUAI1DIANS OF- THE PARISH OF ST. MARyLEISONE. Mr. PAsntLEY, Q.., moved for a rule calling upon toe directors and guardians of the poor of the pariah of St. Marylebone to show cause why a mandamus should not issuescommandingpthem to admithMr. Parnell, n Inspector of the Poor Law Board, to attend the meetings of the directors and guardians appointed under the Local Act, snd also to permit im to take part in theirproceedinspexceptby voting. The parish in question had a large number of paupers, amiounting to 2, 000 in number, including lunatic paupers, mn the workhouse in Marlebone. In the present year a report from the Commissioners of Lunacy had been laid beforel the Poor Law Board as to the state of the lunatics In the workhouse, and that report contained statements of the highest importance as to the M-treatment and improper management of the lunatics, showing that dangerous lunatics were in commaunication t ith other poor persons. Thero were two wards only for the lutatica, and alltheir attendants were pauper., who receive some small remuneration for their services. Lord CAMPBELL said the right of the inspector could not Mr. PSHLEYsaidl he referred to this report to show that the Poor Law Board had felt it to be their duty to communicate a copy to the guardians, and to see whpat coald be done to remedy the grievance, if things were so.

He had given notice of his intention to he present, and there was a full meeting of from 20 to 30 guardians. A resolution was proposed that strangers should be removed; and, this beir earried, the chairman requestd the inspector to withdraw. The l ispector declined, saying that he attended there as the Poor Law In. specter of the Metropolitan District.IHe was not tuared out by force, but desired to leave, andaleft. Mr. Justice Etih inqudred whether the inspector had A right w attend the board. Mr. PASaLEY said that was the question.

The Court would not interfere with fair comments on directors of joint-stock banks ; but this was a publication which, so far as the Court knew, contained chLarges against rse tabne individuals, and accused them of what would subecthem to severe punishment, if prosecuted. It appeared to have been industriously circulated, and there was no palliation for the misconduct. The Court would say no more than that the rule must be made absolute, and the defendant must make his defence before a jury. Rule absolute.
COURT OF COMON PLEAs, MAy 22. NVICKiNS V. GEORGE AND AT.VA - w6i;an;;,>Dllsunw, as We mtntrer, befo-c Lord Chief Ju3tie CoOK1BUI}N and Ju$1We8 RrSSWEL1I WILLIA;, and lTis was an action by an attorney against the two de. fendants, who are market-gardeners. At the trial which took place before Mr. Justice Cresswell a verdict had been found by the jury against Alexander one of the defendants, and for the defendant George. The learned Judge said that this was a verdict for the two defendants, and an applica. tion being made to amend the record by striking out the name of the defendant against whom the verdict was found he reserved leave to the plaintiff to move the Court for a rule to show cause why the verdict should not be entered for the plaintiff, or why a new trial should not be had between third parties upon the ground that Alexander was liable, and to enable the plaintiff to amend third record. Mr. HAwivxs having obtained a rule accordingly, Mfr. W. G. IIARRisow now showed cause against the rale, and contended that no such amendment could be made after verdict, Power was given by sec. 37 of the Common rAw Procedure Act, 1852, to amend by striking out one of the several defendants, but that must be done during the trial, and before the verdict. The point ought not therefore to have been reserved, for this Court had no power to order such amendment to be made. The proper course would have been to have postponed the trial m order to allow the amendment. Mr. Justice CRESSwELL-It was arrniged thatthe Court should decide whether I had the power to amend or not; if there was such power, the plantiff was to have the3 verdict entered for him. Mr, G, Vr HA&RRISON,-The pLntiff DM takua big chanco against these two defendants; he has lost hi, verdict and cannot apply now to have the amendment mad, Mr. HAw=NS appeared in support of the rule, and on tended that the amendment might e ad n that by doing so the Court would be doing substantial iustice. Lord Chief Justice OoceIuBuRN.-I am of opinion that this rule ought to be diseharged ; it seems tome that section 222 of the Common Law Procedure Act, 1852, has no applica. tion to the present question ; the whole qtuestion turns upon section 37, In which it is enacted that "in case it sball p. pear at the trial of any action on contract that there has been a misjoinder of defendants such misjoinder may he amended asa varianceatthoetrial." Now it seems to me that the Act evidently refers to the case Ahere a defendant has been erroneously joined, and then the misjoinder is to be treated as a varnance, but I think it does not apply to a case -where a defendant has been joined not by istke,hutfor the purpos of trying his liabiity. It was contended by mr. Hawkins at the trialto the last moment that both the defendants were liable and now, the jury having found that George was not liable, he proposes that he should he struck out. Bat I think that the Act does not apply to a case like this, where the question was left to the jury. I think that it is a case in which the discretionary Vower of the judge, if it existed at all, ought not to he exercised, and that it would lead to great hardship if we held that it ought to beaso exercised. If the defendant had been joined by mistke, it would have been a fair case for an amendment within the Act;- but when the oounsel for the plaintiff goes to the jury, and endeavourn to obtain a verdctt against all the defendantts, it would be dangeroDus to allow it. Independently of the question whether the power existed or not, we think that it would not he proper here to make the amendment. As for a new tral, it is a right verdict asitstands, and the defendnt eore i enttle toIt,andthe plaintiff may still brin anacton gaist lexnde, ad recover judgment. JONES V. M1ARlSEALL. Mr. T. H. HoDGSON moved for a rule to show cause why the defendant should noyb be discharged from custody on the ground that ho was privilegedl from arrest. It appeared from the affidavits that the defendant is a certificated attorney of the mae Dor courts of law, and also a practitioner in the Lord 1yor, sCourt. On the 14th of May he attended with two other persons at the Regsr office of that court, witlx a view to their utting in hail i an action whichx was to be tried there. h tw ron wvith whom he attendedl swr htte to do so in order to advisa them in thebuieswchty went about.

COURT OF EXCjEeQ1.j FRTTDAV MA 99 (SUting in Banco.) This was tho first day of TrinityTr,adaltecut soo e a theor h r hifBro,a companie by Barons Mri,Bawl,adWto,to i et EVANS V. ERNES. Mr. arILL and Mr. BOWEN showed cause against a rule to set aside an a ward and to re-open the matter, on the ground that the arbitrator had prcededzrparkcin theabsence of the defendant. It aPPeared that the cause was referred at the Spring Assize for Caninasthen in 1855; that two me etings took place, when the plaintiff's case was gone into, and the further hearing adjourned till the month of March last, when the arbitrator finaly fixed on Saturday, the 11th to proceed. To this axl polntment the defendant as weft as the plaintiff assented, but about a week before the day so appointed the attorney for the defendant intimated that he could ntot attend as, the dyfed following on Good Priday and his client and' his itn=eses living in London the appointment would be inconvenient. The arbitrator, however, deeming that after the great delay which had taken plac already it was his duty to proceed, refused to put off the mneeting, and soon afterwards. the defendant, not ~avigattnded ye notice in theusual mnanner that he had made and pub' edhisaward. 'Under these circumstances the defendant, on moving for the rule, now argued that he was not gilty of wilfl delay, and that it was hard that hie should be prec ludedl from placing his case teforo the arbitrator because he bed found it Inconvenient to attend on the day fixed. However, as he was so-mewhat to blame for not having attended, he now offered to p3ay all reasonabIe costs which might b imposed on him. ln answer to this the plaintiff's counsel contendedl that t'he arbitratr was perfectly justified in the course he had pursued. Mir. Field andl Mr. Allen a p eared for the defendant. The COURT unanimously held that the rule must be disobargod. The conduct of the learned arbitrator had not been impugned in any way, and the defendeant only urged that, as he had not been heard, the mattrought to be reopened on his paying costs. He had not made out any case to warrant the Court In adopting that course. The arbitrator, if subject to any blame at, all, could only be accused of having been too goodnatured in allowing the matter to linger on too long, At all events, he had acted quiite correctly in determining to proceed in the absence of the defendant after due notice of the proposed meeting had been given, and of this there was no donbt whatever.

This rule having bee oba, ed utterm, Sir F. TEsxsxoma and Mr. CARRiNGTON now showed cause agabinst it. The rule had been granted on grounds neither of which was tenable. It was alleged, first, that there was no power of appeal agains the warrant under the Ilth and.12th Victoria, cap. 63, sec. 135, as Mr. Ricardo mnight and ougght to have appealed against the rates themsevs;ad, secondly, that theo warrant was not within the wodef the' 135th section, which limit the right of appeal to "1the rates themselves, and any order, conviction, ludgment, or determination,. or any matter or thing done by any justices in anycaseoin which the penalty imposedlor the sum adjudged shal exceed 20s." It w'as contended that this rule ought to be dischared insuh as the united rates exceeded 20s., andl the distress warrant, if not an adjudicathen, was such a " matter or thinge as was contemplated by the Act. Besides this, as the rates were void, Mi. Iticardo was not bound to appeal against them. Mr. Ser-jeant KINGLAXE, Mx.

ARCElES' COlURT, FRIDAY. MAY 22. g theiore .tr J. DOBSON.) This being the first session of Trinity Term, the Court was opened with the usual formalities. JEBB V. DUNGOANNON. Sir J. DODSON delivered judgment in this case, a report of which appeared in 17e Times of the 12th inst. He had ordered the case, he said, to stand over in order that the parties might come to an agreement between themselves, but, not having received any notice that they had so done, he would now deliver his judgment. It was an appeal from the Consistory Court of St. Asaph. In that court it was a business of granting a faculty for the removal of a tablet from the wal ont the wall on the north side of the church of Chirk, andwas promo ei by Lord Dungannon against the minister, &c., of that parish, and also against Mr. Richard George Jebb, the father of the child to whose memory the tablet was erected. The Court below decreed its removal at the expense of Lord Dungannon. The facts lay in a very narrow compass. Richard Jebb died at the age of nine years, and was the son of the appelant in the cause. The child appeared to have been an especial favourite of Lord Dangannon, who determined to erect a tablet to his memory on the wall above his (L-rd Dangannon's) pew. The father objected to it, and wished it to be placed on the northern walD, under a tablet erected to the memory of the child's grandfather, alleging as his reason that it might afterwards be removed, but on receiving an assurance that it should not hegave his consent. Lord Dungannon denied that any promise of non-removal had been made. The Court was perfectly satisfied that there was no intentional misrepresentation on the part of his Lordship-it must acquit him altogether of that; but it appeared from the enence adduce that his memory must have failed him in that respect. The erection of the tablet where it was now laced was Lord Dungannon's own act, which he zas seeking to undo. No change of circnumstauces had since taken place rndering the removal necessary, there had been no increase in his Lordship's family, and no 'pre. sent inconvenience arose from the position of the tablet. Al that wtas suggested was that there was a remote pos. sible contingency that such might be the case. Ee (Sir J. Dodson) thought that the Court below had not exercised a wise dtscretion, and he must therefore reverse the decision ith respect to the removal of the tablet, but he Would leave each party to Pay his own costs.

INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, May 22. IN RE WInIAM BAERp (Before Mr. Commimsioner MUBPfly.) 'las msolvent, an elderly man, described as a surgeon, applied to be discharged. He was opposed by Mr. Dowse, on behalf of Mr. Johnson, the trustee for the insolvent's wife. The insolvent was in cestody at the suit of Mr. Johnson, who had sued him for arrears of an annuity of 521. secured to his (insolvent's) wife under a deed of separation. Upon a former hearing the insolvent denied that the lady whom Mr. Johnson represented was his wife, and upon a certii. cate of the marriage in Scotland being produced he declared the marriage was invalid, as he had another wife lving at the time. A.other lady, whom the insolvent had since married, was called and declared that she was the insolvent's legal and only wife, who had borne him four children. The lady described an interview she had had with the other wife, whom she complained of as molesting her. Mr. DowNsE complained that the insolvent had pleaded to the action brought by the trustees to recover the arrears of the annuity, aud had thereby increased the law costg to 287 The learned Comrsssion said It was a very painful case. If, as the insolvent declared, he was unable to pay the 521. a-year, which he had undertaken to do, it would be much better for the parties to agree upon some smaller sum -say, 201. a-year-which should be paid for the support of the lady whom Mr. Johnson represented. This suggestion was not at first acceptable to the opposition, and Mr. Dowse proceeded to call his Mirs. Baker, who came into the box and was sworn, but the learned counsel then consented to an adjournment for a week, in order that the trustee might be consulted upon the question of arrangement proposed by the Court.

She had, she said, a few days ago put an advertisement in the Sussez Gazsee stating her quli fications for a situation as housekeeper in a gentleman's family - and the day after the advertisement appeared she receivea a printed circular of which the following is a copy:- " 8cnrrY FOR TEI DIFFMSION OF UsnI-UL KNOWsr.DOE Madam.-In reply to your a4vertisement, I beg to inform yOU that the above society have constantly on theirbooks. ollected from vadous sources, the names of about 40 gentlemen in or near Bussex in wnt of housekeepers, a written list of which may be had at any time for ip. or by ot for 13 stamw,s If too poor to afford the above, I am permlttur through the kiodness of the oDmmittee. to suppy you gratts on applyng to me, properly recommended. and shall be happy to ssis Ton with any other i aorm,sotu or advioe that can In any way advance your temporal or etemal welfare.

Al1en, deputy clerk of the peace, conducted the prosecution, which arose out of a trial at the last Westminster Sessions, when, in consequence of an intimation thrown out by the Court, the prisoner waz taken into Custody. lArtin Burke a very creditable-looking man, said that he was an attendant at the Strand Theatre, employed there by Mr. Payne, the lessee. He had been engaged. there seven 1ears, and it was part of his duty to prevent the sae of ?c'kets and " bkill orders' at the doors. The prisoner was there on the evening of the 4th nlt. -with some tick-ets in his hand, when he warned him off, and threatened to give him into the custody of a fDliceman~, upon which the accused struck him a violent b ow in the eye and then took to his heels. Prosecutor followed and collared him, when, upon the -police coming up, prisoner, to his gre at toniahmrent, charged him with felony, and subsequently swore that prosecutor had snatched a purse, con. taiing4s, from his hand, at the door of. the theatre. Upon prisoner's evidence Drosecautor was committed for trial, and lay in prison six vveeks. Ho was tried on the 16th, at the Westminster Sessions, and acquitted, Mr. Payne giving him a very good character. Prisoner, in his evidence, swore that he lived at 6, Wellelose-square, and was an ivory-turner and surgeon-dentist. He denied that he was selling tickets at the door of the theatre. He denied that he got his living by sellifg spurious rings and sham sovereigns in the street, that he ever passed by any other name than that of Anderson, or that he had ever been convicted or in custody upon any charge whatever. In reply to questons from Ur. PA&YITER, prosecutor said that he had no family, but had his aged parents to maintain. James Watts, 82 F, proved that prisoner gave the pro. secutor into his custody on the night of the 4th ult. for felony. Prosctor denied it, and accused him of selling tickets at the door and assaulting himn. Prisoner voluntarily produoed a ticket and a purse from his pocket, but said he carried two purses. Vitneu had made inquiries, and found that no such person as the prisoner lived at the address he gave. Witness knew prisoner as a man selling sham sovereigns in the street to decide pretended wagers. William Twist, 456 N, said he saw the prisoner sign thLe police-sbeet at Hackney, in the name of Henry Barnett, upon the occasion of givinga boy into custody about six months ago for breaking windows. Witness had seen him sell flash sovereigns and rings. Thomas Swaine, 188 N, said that on the 28th of last January prisoner gave two men into custodyfor robbing him, but did not proceed with the charge. He then signedhimself Barnett. Samuel Sawyer, usher at the Westminster Sessions Court, George lookyer, principalwarder at Coldbath-fields and Richara Lambert, severally proved tbat Drisoner hi repeatedly been in prison in different names. It was through Sawyer's instrumnentality that the Judge put the questons to prisoner upon the prosecutor's trial w;hich gave rise to the presentprosecution. When asked whether he wished to say anything in answer to the charge, prisoner admitted that he had swoom falsely, but stoutly denied that he had committed perury, becaiso if a man sold things in the streets, or went by another name, it was nothing to anybody, and if he got into trouble he was not bound to let all the world know and added that because he differed from the Church of Erng land there was an attempt being made to get up some sort of a charge against him. He was fully committed for trial, and bail was refused. LAwinth -Ater the exaumination ofthe persons char,ged with the robbery at Mir. Moran's on Thur:ra an applhcs tonx was mnade by his solicitor for the discharge of Augustus Frederick Cordner, the young man respecting whose identity in connexion with this robbery s:o much conflictinig evidence had been given. Two disinterested witnesses swore positively that Cordner was the person who drove uptothe shop of the prosecutor on the morning of the robbery and took away some bundles of property ; and this circusistance, together with the fact of the accused himself calling at the shop of Mr. Morau between 9 and 10 o'clock the night before to invite him and his wife to a hafllat Wills's when no such ball was held, considerably increasedthe suspicion against him. On the other hand, it was satisfactorily shown that on the night of the robbery the young man arrived at lDartford, engaged a bed at the Bsull Commercial Inn, slept there that night, and did not leave till midday. Xr. NoRTON remarked that there could not be the slightest doubt that Cordner slept at Dartford on the night of the robbery, and therefore that the witnesses were mistaken in his identity, and be was therefore discharged. The young man complained of being incarcerated among the worst class of felons, on a charge of which he was as innocent as any person present. Mr. NtOtRhTON observed he hoped it was so, and the young man left the cour.

The wives of Captain Oliver tStokes and Captain Haultain, and'two children, also arrived :by the Lebanon. Dr. Smith, -second-class staff-surgeon, came in medioal charge of t}o four companies. Before leaving the ship at Woolwich the officers took the oppor. 'tunity of expressing to Captaik'Cook their satisfaction and hearty thanksfor the urbanity and kindne3s which theyhad -experienced'from himself and every officer throughout the 'vessel. A cirelar order has been'issued to the home ports by the Lords of the Admiralty, to the effect that all petty officers, seamen, and boys now serving in ships at the home ports, or in ships arriving in England, are to be allowed to be -discharged if thoy wish it, and no payment is to be required from the continuous service men and boys so discharged. When ships are paid off petty officers and A.-.'s only are to be permitted to put their names down to-return to a flagship for re-entry; and all non-continuous service ordinary seamen and boys are to be discharged from the service. No more ordinary seamen aro to be permitted to volanteer for continuous service. All continuous service men of bad character, or who are weak and andersized, and all boys not likely to make good seamen, are to be discharged. These regulations are to be carried into immediate effect, and it is to be made generally known that such discharges are permitted in the cases of -continuous service men and boys of good character, and en-forced in the other cases alluded to, in consequence of there being a very large excess of men and boys above 'the number (48,000) voted by Parliament for the year 1857-8. Yesterday a general court-martial, of which Lieutenant. Colonel G. EUiott, Royal Marine Light Infantry, was the president, assembled at Chatham Barracks for the trial of rrivate Patrick EeRy, 70th regiment, on the charge of having rescued a prisoner from custody as he was being 'conveyed to the guard-house. Major H. D. Ellis, of the Provisional Battalion, officiated as Deputy Judge-Advocate. 'The evidence of the witnesses was to the effect that the prisoner was ordered to form part of an escort to convey a soldier from the huts at Prince Henry's Bastion to the guard-house, and that while so engaged he incited the man to eseape, ,and on the corporal endeavouring to prevent the escape of his prisoner the latter knocked him down and kicked him. The finding of the court will not be known until the pro.ceedings have been submitted for the approval of the Dake of Cambridge. The Emerald, 51 guns, new screw steam-frigate, hasEbeo put out of the fitting basin at Sheerness, and is placed in the steam squadron of reserve, under Captain Edward P. Halstead, in command of the Edinburgh. The Brane paddlewheel steam-vessel, Lieutenant Com. cmander Swinburne, has been put oat of the basin at Sheerness. It has been ascertained on trial that steam cannot be generated in her boilers to a pressure beyond 141b. to the square inch, instead of 201b., as calculated. The result is a considerable reduction in her speed. The Locust 3-gun paddlewheel stearavessel, Lieutenant. Commander John B. Field, has retarned from Plymouth and Portsmouth. Some experiments were made by Com- sander Field and witnessed by Commander Veiteh, R.N., with Clifford's plan for lowering boats when under foll steam power. When the Locust was off the Bill of Port' land, during a fine breeze fromthenorth-west, fromthetime of the commander calling out, "A man overboard; let go the life-buoy; man the boat," till the boat was lowered, full manned and oars out, and clear of the ship,-only 25 seconds elapsed. The experiment was repeated with a like result on entering HIamoaze, when the Locust was at full speed, for the purpose of the boat making a line fast to the buoy. In both cases the time was noted and tested by Commander Veiteh, with Commander Field, of the Locust The Ulnited States' frigate Niagara is to leave Gravesend this morning for Liverpool to ship her portion of the Trans. atlantic electrie cable, consisting of 1,500 tons, and will sail from Liverpool about the time the Agamemnon leaves the river, having shipped an equal amount off East Green. wich.

TREASURE TRovE.-The Queen's Remembrancer at Ednburgh is accustomed to pounce upon all valuables found in the soil undor the law of Treasure Trove. In virtue of this absurd law and usage, which in these days would be "more honoured in the breach than in the observance," we may mention that amone other things lately impounded were the curious bronze axes lately discovered in this vicinity. The law, we may add, is relaxed in favour of the scottish Society of Autiquaries, who may possibly -establish a claim to th-em by petition, although we hope tbat eome of them may also be secured for this district. To assist the Reinenibraucer in hie vocation we may tellhim of a nmetaUic deposit of a miscellaneous and perhaps vener-ableoharacter which was foiund on Saturday labt. Wor'sunen bave been employed for some time past digging a sandbank atthe base of the 1ill of Doune, for the purpose of obtaining soil for fully filling up some of the Duff-house1pnrks,.and in the course of their operations on Saturday Irst they came upon vhatiseemed a onass of iron apparently ,some%three4eet long by a faot anda half broad. Upon a -0loser inispection it was fomd that the sus-tarce was made --p of an.iumnense number of articles of bard ware, including a6reoat.varietv of scissors, metal snuff-boxes, razors, knives, :flemrs for bleeding stock, and shoemakers' awls. Of this last;articlo there were probalby nearly IIJOOO in the mass. The ;hole was -completely conered with rust, which had acted as a kind of cement, and it was with diflicultv that the ddifiaent artiolez were separated. T he general eharac. ter of the articles indicates that they mitlbave at one time formed QAe merchan&se of a travefilig hardware hawrker; but how they came-to be deposited n the .position iu which they were ifuod is notz little mysterious. They were lying ,beneath a sto;ie which was itself 12 feet below the surface.

2'IE 93c HIGHLANDERS. Whohas lately seen the93Highlanders must. by the venerable zelics of silk and gold v nlong dioured ttters streamed forth om the solorataffs These were the remains of a pair of colours Prcesnted to the regiment by the Dake of Wellington aviurly a quarter of a century agO. Since that time they Eave done duty in most parts of the w orld, exposed to tlhe victssitudes of all climes and weathers, to all the chances and mishaps of the battle-field, till their career of glory t:ulmi. nated on the day when the faded shreds waved proudly in front of the " thin red line" at Balaava. TTie Crimean campaign was a trying one to these well-vorn fabrics. Almost weekly it has been since necessary to rc,air them, in order to preventth cherished fragments falrom thed and in spite of the pride rmnd fondnses3 wvt which the regiment naturally regarded the bsanners a^uder whi^h such fame had bcen achieved it WRS evident 'tit their Period of active service was fast draig to acose. A short time since the 93d got the route for Ckina and this settled the question of the coloxa Go reap fresh laurels in the East under the old air was impossible, as not a vestige of 'themn would have suvived the passage to Canton. A new paf of colours, accordingly, were yesterday presxnted st -l-over with much 4dcat and ceremony by hiS R'yal lHighness the Commander-inChief, aud under thes ,X the geliant 93d again seek renown in the far East. Theold ones wUll rest from their labours in Glasgow catbedrealdrooping over the ~fie tomb ereoted to the memory of those brave PHighlanders who in the Crimea added to their lustre and-died in their defence. It is fitting t-hat the remains of the veeran banners which led them to victoryt shoulod thus honour the last resting.place of their 10 o'clock yesterday 'morning was the hour fixed for the presentation of the new colours, but long before that time arrived it was seen that the day would be marked by all the seventies of an English spring. A south-west wind and murky sky gave rise to the livehest apprehensions till about 9o'loclr, whenaHlliopeswerefinajly extinguished bythe rain faling in torrents. From this untoward state it rever varied, falling with that dull heavy pertinacity such as carn only be seen England when an outdoorflte of unusual interest occus. Lang before this unfavourable change took place a lae concourse of spectators had assembled onthe Western H4eights, where the colours were to be presented, and having e'dently made up their minds for the worst the rain effected no diminution in their numbers; on the contrary, even after the clouds began to do their worst the visitors from the town came up as fast as ever. A lttle after 9 o'clock the 42d and 93d left Dover Castle, officers and men, of course, in full uniform. The old colours of the 93d were carried to the ground for the last time by the ensigns. The new ones, bright and fresh from the loom, were borne by the Brevet Lieutenant-Colonels Ewart and Gordon. The appearance of both regiments as they balted upon the appointed ground upon the heights was remarkably fine, and they would boar comparison with any troops thxou hout Europe. The 42d have always been maintained in such perfection of discipline as to be generaly considered equal to the Guardas fn this respeot they are admitted to have a slight, but very slight, superiority over the 93d, which, however, on the other hand possesses a more athletic body of men. In military games and feats of strength and activity the men of the 93d defy all competition. Both regiments durmng the Russian war suffered more from sickness than the enemy, thoug h from neither cause to such en extent as to materially affect the ssersonieZ of the two corps, which are stil almost as fine a when they roused tshe Turks to something almost like astonishment at His Itoyal Highness came upon the ground at 10 o'clock, attended by Sir Frederick Love and his staff; Colonel Forster, Asdstant Adjutant-General; Colonel Tyrwhitt, and several other officers. There were also present to witness the ceremony Major-General Brook, Major-General Wood, Major-General Straubenzee, Colonel Parke, and the other offiers of the 73d- Colonel Douglas, and the offieers of the 79th- Sir Andrew Leith Hay, Lord and Lady Alan ChurchiU, ady and Miss Cockburn, Lady Tylden, Colonel Tuloeh, (Cluney M'Pherson, the Hon. Colonel Cathcart, and z number of Artillery officers of the garrison cnd from the adjacent camp at Shorucliffe. There was, ir fact, quite a darziing disDlay of uniforms, and the who. -tarie would have been one of the most brilliantof it kinu . the weather had only been propitious. Unfortunately, as we have said, It was the very reverse-men and officers were aU dripping alike, and the whole scene had a wetness about it that was most depressing. The Royal standard on the Castle might have beenapall for anything the spectators could tell to the contrary. It lung mn heavy folds to the staff, now and then making a ponderous attempt to flutter, but instantly Towardsthe seathe view was equally uncheering; only misty form6sof ships could he made out through the driving rain,wh31e the couds, settling on the heights in huge masses, seemed to prolong them indefinitely upward, like alps of As his Highness came towards the troops he wasreceived by both regiments with the usual Royal salute, which was continued while he rode slowly along the ranks minutely inspecting the trim of every company. The grenadier company then advancing halted in front of the Duke, who, taking the new colours from Lieutenant-Colonels Ewart and Gordon, Presented them to the Colour-Ensigns of the 93d, who received them kneeling. The new colours were then trooped, the Regiment marching past between them saluting both as they went by. The ceremony of " blessing them," as the soldiers term it, was then gone through by the Rev. Mr. Maynard, Episcopal Chaplain, and the Rev. Mr. Watson, Pres yberian chaplain; after which the 93d formed three sides of a square, and his Royal Highness taking his place in the centre addressed it in a loud clear voice nearly as follows:-" Colonel Hay and Officers and Men of the 93d,-It now becomes my dutv, as the individual who has had the honour of presenting these colours, to address you. I can assure you it is with great satisfaction I have dischar ed the duty thus devolving on me. The reason for that satisfaction is very obvious; for I cannot forget that your gallant regiment was among the division I had the honour of commanding durino-the late struggle in the Crimea. I cannot forget, nor shall I ever cease to remember with pride and satisfaction, that whatever success then attended my command Iowe to the bravery of the two brigades which I had the honour to have under me. I owe to them and the distinction they won that I am at this moment, through the favour of Her Gracious Majesty, at the head of the British army. That is a position which may well inspire any man with pride; and, feeling what I do, It is both natural and proper that I should take special interest in those gaUant corps I had the honour to command. In sayirg this, however I would not in the least degree be supposed to depreciate the courage and bravery of a single soldier who served in that campaign. I have seen the 93d behave in a manneI which must bring credit on any corps; and I have no fear that, let their duty call them wherever it may, thev will sustain the high reputation they have acquired. It would be ungraceful and improper for me now to allude to what is past; the peace of Europe has, I trust, been permanently established; but I cannot refrainfromsaying tbat, as regards the honour and credit recently earned by the British army, nothing could have been more creditable, noble, and gallant than the conduct of this regiment. You are now about to embark for foreign service. It is impos. s.ble to say whether your services will be required or not; hut, should they be, I am confident you will make it your especial duty to guard the colours now presented toyou with the same jealous feeling of honour and nobleness of conduct as you displayed during the late campaign. It was with a feeling approsching to regretthat I sawyourold coloursfurled for the last time this day; but the honour and glory attaching to those tattered emblemB have now ')assed over to their successors, which I give into your charge. You will, I know, do whaty~ou are pledged to do-your duty by them; on will do your duty to your Queen and country." His Vloyal Highness concluded his address with a brief exhortation to soldierly discipline and good order, paying a high compliment to ColoneI Hay, by alluding to the example he furnished to the 93d-an example which his Royal Highness trusted they would follow, whether in time of war or in tie f pec. To this high enlogium Lieutenant-Colonel Leith Hay, commanding the 93d, addressing his Royal Highness, said it now became his duty to return the warmest and best thanks of the 93d for the honour conferred upon them that day by his Royal Highness in the presentation of these colould. Twenty-three years ago the old colours of the 93d were presented by the_greatest soldier of his age, hiS Grace the late Due of Wellington, and the regiment now esteemed themselves fortunate in receivin the present colours from an officer not only of his Ral Highness's exalted rank, but one under whom the regi ment had the great good fortune to serve during the most arduous part of the Crimean campaign. It was needless for him to assure his Royal Highness with what zealous care the 93d would watch over the safety of these emblems of their country's honour. Whatever privations they might be called onto endure-whatever hardships they might have to suffer-whatever the dangers to encounter or the enemies to meet-they would never forget that these colours caUled upon themx in the name of their Queen and country; and, remembering that, they would hbe preserved so long as a man was left in the ranks.

The whole sof the arrangements connected with this portion of the day's proceedings, which would have done honour to either Staples or Gunter, were carried out by the well-known regimental messman, Mr. States. It is needless to add that the entertainment wasoer a most festive ind. Before dancing ecomnenced a gratifyiang tribute was paid by the officers of the 934 to the real and good conduct of an old scoldier who leaves the reimen on a pension after .30 year' continuwous service. Co onel Ray presented him with a handsome risver tankard, on which was inscribed : " Presented by Lieutenant Colonel Leith Hay and the officers of the 93d Sutherland Highlanders to Private John Frazer, as a mark of their esteem andin recollection d ,hjs long and faithful services as an officer's servant andt ,3n~iter." i During the afternoon the newv colours were quite objeo~4 olour of tlr regiment, the pAret it ever reccivd, frahied they psm e a picture.

I am happy to sy we got off at 11 15 a.no, I trust without much damago, as she does not make any water. We made the 80illy Lights at 10 60 p.m. last night; and, though we should have weathered them some males, I thought it prudent to tock to the southward and wetnward, which I did at 11 p.m., and at 12 tbe Scity Lights bore F byS.l6tol8mlUes.

At 6 30 a.m. the Land's-end was reported, bearing dae north 15 to 20 miles, steering at the time S.E. by E J E At 8 a.m. the master reported to me the Lzard bore 14 mUil de nor,. I thea told him he had better steer for the Riame Head. A litMe afterwards I went on deokaRdfoumdtheweatherhabzY. bat cauld see tbree or fourmmUes. I went below as half-past 8 to breakfast, aud went on deck again a little before 9 am.: It had then become very thck. I asked the master if he had sas tho Lizard. He told me he had not seen the lighthouse, bet hte had srn tte loom of the lard. I ordered the studdingrals to he taken on. in the act of which I observed a fishing boat, which I haluod, aud askel him how far we were oef the laud, acdI understood ileo answzer to hs 'La3nd is ri,ht a heaid ' and the man waved his hat. 1 inmedlataly ordered the heLX t, be Put down., and turoad tho bandls up to out the ship abous~ I 'oing k-hch off, and uoe3sed Inldooieng sEoat 11 15 loeaus.

Licutenant Marriott, ~enior * m . :F_ ' v. the Exmouth, wvas the first witnwds called -H., : -h '-e duty of the commander (whom t.L, s- :geon . eviousily certified to he sick) on *the Lnrrr;ng of thb uaj when the ship got ashore. He produc - . chart from the chart-box of the ship to give her position. The Scilly Light was seen on the niht prev.ous, andbearings were taken between noon of the 11th and the time of the ship groudnding on the 12th. They were at 6 30 a.m. Land was reported by the signalman on the lee quarter, and the bearing of it was taken by the officer of the watch rad the master. Witness saw no other bear. ings taken, and could not say whether the courses steered and the distanees run from the day previous until the time of the ship grounding had been correctly inserted in the log. He heard the letter from Captain Eyres to Rear Admiral Plumridge read to the Court, and to the best of his belief and recollection that statement was correct Mr. John Penn, master of Her Majesty's ship Victory, produced a reckoning worked up by himself showing the course and distance run by the Exmouth from noon of the 11th to the time of the groundin on the 12th inst. Lieutenant Emil Theorell, who was heutenant of the morning watch on board the Exmouth on the day she went ashore, eposed to the course of the ship being altered on two different occasions during the time he was on deck. the first was between 7 aud a-quarter past, from S.E. by E. l E. to E., and at five minutes past 8 to E. by N. The courses were ordered tobe alteredby the master, who said, "Will you steer the ship east?" to which witness replied, "No, E. i N. ;" when the master rejoined, "Well, ou had better keep her east." He did not think the land was in sight at the timethe course was altered; it was last in sight to witness's knowledge about 10 minutes past 7, then 10 or 12 miles off; the lead was not hove duringthetimehe was on deck, nor were the leadsmen on the chains during the morning watch. Lieutenant Oliver, officer of the watch on the morning of the 12bh inst., deposed the weather to be very thick. The ship was going eight knots, under aU sail to studdingsails, at 8 o clock. From the state of the weather when he went on deck at 8.20 land could have been distinguished at from 600 to 800 yards. The lead was hove during his watch before the ship got ashore,-not the deep-sea but the hand lead. The starboard side leadsman had been heaving more than half an hour, the portside leadsman rather less. The weather side called " no bottom, and 17 fathoms.' The rate at which the ship was going was about 612 knots. The first intimnation they got of the ship being near the shore, or aground, was aearing the fishermnen hail that land was near ahead, William Dell, ordinary seaman, who was the lookout man placed upon the cap of the bowvsprit, deposed to the weather being thick. Saw a boat anidrepcorted it. Did not see anythu4afterwvards until he saw the breakers, when he sung ont " rcakers ahead I" after which he did not see the landt until she struck, which was about a minute or two After hearing the evidence of several other seamen the Couas'r declared the case for the prosecution closed, and fixed 10 o'clock ne:t day to hear the defence. At the anpointed time, *Captain Eyres, on being called upon for his defence, said, he had been nearly 39 years in the service, and during that period he had had the good fortune never yet to zaieive a censure froma the Admiralty or a comnmander-ia-chief, and he had hoped to have been spared this ordeal; but he trustedt'hat the plain statement he was about to make, and the evidence already given before the Coutt, together with that which he should produce, would prove that there was no negligence on his part. Af ter tacking the ship off the Scilly light, at 11 o'clock on the 11th inst., he went belowv at 12; but was, called again at 2, 4, and half-past 6, at his own request. He would atk the Court if being calied every twvo hours on a flne moonlight night bore the appearvace of negligence? HIe went on desk again shortly after 8, and remaiaed tili half-past 8; at that time he could see three or four mlues. Hle returned to the deck shortly before 9, and then, obcserving a very thick fog, he made use of the exclamation, "HEajo ! when did this come on ," and he believed he was answered, "llot long, Sir." He then seduced the sail, not from any fear of the land, but because he thought they might ran into some vessel, and took other measures to insure the safety of hls own vessel. Captain Eyre then detailed the course he adopted when the fisherman's boat washailed nrd his proceedings until the ship took theground. He expressed his inability to account for the position of the ship, except by the statement of the man wlho came on board while the ship was on shore, who informed him that a current had been running like a sluice to the north-west for several days on account of the long prevalence of south. easterly winds; but in 1856, after a long prevalence of easterly winds, be experienced a strong set to the southward. It was therefore impossible to assign the exact cause. He would nowv leave his case with confidence in the hands of the Court, begging them to bear in mind that HerMa. jesty's ship Exmnouth was safe at Spithead. Captain E3res then called Lieutenant W. H[. Wright, Lieutenant G. H. Barnard, William Goond (Marine), XVil. liam Hunt (captain's steward), and Lieutenant Oliver, and wished to call the MIaster (Mr. CaveUl, the other prisoner), to prove the points set forth in his address to the Court. M[r. James loskins then road an address to the Court for Mr. OaveU, setting forth his long connexiou with the service, wfhich covered a period of 3L 5ears, 26 of which had been in active employ; during the whole of that time he bdnever hnd a misfortune, nor had the slightest imputtion been cast upon his professional skill or attention to his8duties. He detailed his proceedings from the time St. Agnes Light vs seen on the 11th, until the ship grounded on the following morning, and stated he could only account for the ship getting on shore by an extraordinary current setting to the westward, casting the ship's head towards the shore. H[e did not think the evidence before the Court would sustain the charge of negligence. The Court was cleared for deliberation at 1 o'clock, and remained closed until 4, when it was reopened, and the Deputy-Judge-Advocate pronounced the following as the findiDg :-The Court was of opinion that the charge against Captainl Eyres had been proved, inasmuch as he placed too implicit confidence in the master's pilotage, and did not verify it by the use of the deep sea lead, and they adjudged him to be admuonished; the Court were further of c,pinion that the charge had been prov,ed against the master. ina8. much as he trusted too much to his judgment of distance from the land in hazy weather, and shaped his course too confidently without making use of the deep sea lead ; but in consideration of his long services and previous high character they only senterced him to be reprimanded and admonished. The Fxmouth is ordered to Plymonth to be paid off as soon as the Grand Duke Constantine has made his vihit to the Queen.
CARELESSNESS IN THE SALE OF POISONS.-An in nest was held on Monday last at Louth on the body of a chnd aged two years and five months, named COarles Houseman, Son of Satniuel Houseman, a gardener. It appea s that a phial of laudanum wa's left by Houseman upoa a table, and that the child drank a portion of it, and was found in a state of stupor. It died the same night, The man who sold the poison was a grocer, who keeps it for the .a ccownnodation" ,f the public, but does not even labeL the bottles. The coroner said to this wan,-" If death ha t resulted to an adult person you wonld have been placed ia a most perilous position. Not only have you neglected to p lace a label on the phial describing tRo contenta as poisoa, but you allowed it to go out of your shop with a label up2u t describing thn contents to be ' Dalby'; Carminative,' a bhrmless adxture, You see it is now upon the bottle.- In thli case, however, the deceased child was so young that it coul4 not read, but had it been otherwise you would have been placed in an awful posiltion. I would recommend you to be caraful." The jury, after a short cosisultatiop, rvo turae a verdict of " AccideotaW death."X
I SPOBTING IBWGO. TATTEtRSALVs, FRIDAv_ Despite the inclement weather, many of the principal bookmakers quitted London in the morning to assist at the meeting at Harpenden. The room was there fore not numerously attended, and the betting was, with fewv eccep. tion5s, unimportant. Saunterer was again in great force, and his owner would have supported him for money at 31 to 1; 10 to 1 was, however, the highest offer against him. He was backed for 1001. each for the best of places, 1, 2, 3, against Anton, Tournament, and Skirmisber, and an offer was made to lay 2,0001. even that Saunterer and Sprig of Shillelagh beat each of any three. 900 to 100 was booked about Tournament, and 10 to I to a " pony" and U to 1 to 751. were laid against Anton.

(i1GAAWIO F'LOATING IANDING-STA4i. - ILvEtPOOL, May 22.-The large new floating landing-stage which is being constructed at the cost of the Liverpool Corporation for the accommodation of sea-going steamers is all but completed. When finished it wil be 1,002 feet long, or nearly three times longer than the United States' frigate Niagara, and 82 feet wide; and communication will be obtained with the shore by means of four cast. iron bridges, each of which is 113 feet long, and 13 feet 6 inches wide from dde to side, The bridges are constructed with ordinary tubular girders, on the principle of those forming part of the Britannia. bridge. The mode of construction is precisely the same as that which has proved so sucoessful in the landing-stago for the accomraodation of passengers by the ferry steamers at the George's Pier. Upon a range of 63 rectangalar pontoons, of immense size and strength, are placed five rows of quadrangular hoUow-iron girders or kelsonS, each 1,0D0 feet long, which act as supporting ridges and fixing points for the main timbers of the floor or deck, which latter has been constructed by Messrs Thomas Vernon and Son, iron shipbuilders, on the beach at Tranmere. Three of theso sections have been launched, floated down the river at high tides, moorod in their positions, and connected; the third and last soction has been launched, and will be floated to its place to-morrow (Saturday); and this morning one of the bridges forming the meansofcommunication with the pier was floated ona stage prepsred for the purpose from the great float at Birk-enheaa to the new landing-stage, and successfully oonnected with the stage and the pier. The operation ws cleverly performed. Three poDtoons had in the first instanoe been taken into the great float, upon which a high staging waa erected. The bridge, which had been brought in pieces from Manchester, where it bad been manufactured by Measrsm Fairbairn, was put together on the staging, and was this morning, by the aid of steamtugs, floated to its place between the new landing-stage and the pier. the staging rupon which it wasresting being sufficiently high to auow one end of the bridge to be shipped on the crowshead on the pier, the pontoons suprorting te staging sinking with the tide until the other en( of the bridge was shipped on the croesheed on the landing-stage.. The entire operation was ormed with the greatest ease and sucoeag. Another rldge is completed. and will be brought over with the high tide on Monday. The engineer is Sir William Cnbitt, the contractors for the entire work are Messrs. Cochran, of Dudloy, the estimated cost being 140,000M, and the sub contractors are Messrs. T. Vernon and Son, Liverpool, and MesrseFairbairn, of lanchestr. Mesr&sVernon andSonhave completed abouttwo.thirds Of the entire work, theiroontract includingthemakingofthepontoons, placingthem, faenng the kelsons, and the fornisbiDg of the woodwork and the joinery. Messrs. FAirbaim are making the four bridges, and lessrs, Cochran have themsclves manufactured the kelsons, in the constructionof -which 1,000 tons of iron have been required, the pontoons having also taken 1,000 tons of the same material. The deck is laid down with timber 43 inches in thicknes, over which is a layer of l-incll-imber to give strangthand duzXbility to the work,
