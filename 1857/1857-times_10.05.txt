MONEY-MARKETand CITYINTELLIGBRNOB Saturday Evening; The funds opened this morning at a decline of aa eighth, from which there was ultimately a reaction. Consols for money were first quoted 90 to J, and the final transactionswere at 90i to i for money, and 90 to A for the 14th inst. India Stock left off at 20t to 2I0; India Bonds, 24s. to 17s. discount; Ex. chequer-bonds, 98U to i; and Exchequer-bill, 8s. to 4s. discount. The transactions in foreign stocks continue limited but the market shows considerable firm. ness. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 100; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 78i; Russian Five per Cents., 109i; Sardinian, 89k, 90, and 89i; Spanish, 40k; ditto Certificates, 56; Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98; and Peru. vian Four-and- a-Half per Cent. Dollar Bonds, 56i. The final quotations of the French Three pet Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 40c. for money, and 68f. 70c. for the new account at the end of the month, showing an im. provement of more than a quarter per cent. The renewed drain of gold appears to be assuming increased proportions. About 88,000l. was takea from the Bank to-day for exportation. Should the demand continue at this rate during the next week an early advance in the rate of discount must be anticipated. The total loss of the Central America steamer 021 her passage from Aspinwal to New York with the Californian mails and about 400,0001. of gold will fall heavily on this side, more tban half the amount being insured here. The disaster took place in a hurricane about two miles off Cape Hatteras, the most dangerous point in the navigation of the American coast, and out of nearly 600 persons oi board only 100 were known to have been picked up. Much additional gloom had thus been thrown on the New York Exchange, and most of the specula, tive securities had experienced a further fall of 2 or 3 per cent. According to advices from Constantinople the Turkish Government have resolved upon an issue of additional paper money for a sum equal to a snl loi sterling, bearing 8 per cent. interest, of which about three-fouths have already been put forth. The telegraph to-day announces a decline in the exchange. The following is an abstract of the railway in. tellgence of the week :-At a meeting of the Mid. lan.d Great Western (Ireland) the dividend de.. lared wfas in accordance ith the report. Notwith.. atanding the competition with the Great Southern and Western Company, the directors have not been obliged to recommend a smaller distribution than usual. The receipts of the Scottish North-Easter.x for the past half-year show an increase of 3,400l. over the corresponding period of 1856, with a smalI diminution in the expenditure. This increase has been realized without any deterioration in the value of the plant, which, on the contrary, has been imnproved and augmenlted. The cattle traffic to London has of late fallen off60 per cent. Advices froin Melbourne announce the opening of the Geelong and Melbourne line to iUliams2iown, a distance of 39 miles. It is intended to continue the line fromn Geelong to BaUarat. At a meeting of the South Wales Mineral it was announced that a contract has been entered into for the formation of the entire line ready to receive the permanent way. The works of the Briton Ferry -Dock with which the I ultimate prosperity of the undertaking is intlimately [associated, are making satisfactory progress. The directors of the Great Western and Brentford have been authorized to raise 30,0007. on loan, and to in. crease the capital of the company to the extent of 45,0001. by the issue of 10. ishares. An interlm payment of 6s. per share of the Stirling and Dunfermline has been declared, and a committee ap. pointed to negotiate upon the subjects in dispute with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Company. The Bridport Railway wiU probably be ready for traffic on the 10th. The report of the Limerick anc Foynes states that the line will be opened to the latter place early in the present month. The receipts show a surplus over expenses of 9501. subject to some deduction for the use of the station of the Waterford and Limerick Company. The works and permanent way of the portion of the railway in opera. tion are reported to be in good order. At a meeting of the Dublin and Kingstown the dividend declarea was at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum. The debt due to the Commissioners of Public Works has been reduced to 22,8891, and it is believed that thig sutn will be liquidated in February next. The directors of the General Terminus and Glasgow announce an increase in the receipts for the past half-year of 1,5001., as compared with the corresponding period of 1856. A dividend is recommended at the rate of 2 per cent, per annum. The report of the Great; estern of Canada states that the net revenue for the past half-year amounts to 94,1361., out of whiclz a distribution at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum is proposed. The past winter was one of unusual severity, and caused great damage to the rolling. stock and roadway, but both have been thoroughly repaired and are now in a most efficient condition. The opening of the Sarnia line is deferred to next year. A working agreement has been entered into with the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway,which by next spring will be completed to Lake Michigan. It is believed that this wil bring a considerable accession of traffic to the Great Western. The Government loan of 7100,000.. is to be repaid in four instalments, from the 1st of Jnly, 1858, to the 1st of January, 1860. The precise amount of specie shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Colombo for the East is 594,4851., of which 2691. is for the Mauritius, 43,0211. in gold, and 366,8001. in silver for India and Ceylon, and 184,3951. for China and the Straits. The JournaZ de Frankfort states that cfforts are being made in Prussia to organize a European Electric Telegraph union. If the project is carried out the journal argues that it will simplify the trans. mission of messages, and cause the tariff of charges to be lowered. * On the 1st inst. a letter was inserted on the affairs of the Surrey Gardens Company from Mr. Coombe, " Chairman of the Shareholders' Committee." Lest Mr. Coombe should derive weight from him communication having been given in The Times, it is necessary to observe that a pamphlet just pub.- lished, entitled Facts and Decum-ents rdatinig to the Rercrses of the Surrey Gardcens Compaw furnishes a series of statements calculated to shake reliance ont any unsupported assertion Mr. Coombe may make. * The following information regarding the mining business of the gweek is condensed from the Mining Journal*- " The market opened quietly this week, but imnproved after the settling, which was somewhat hoavy. At South Caradon Mine meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of a dventurers of 3,3571.; a dividend of 2,049'. (SI. per share) was deolared, and the balance, 1,3091., c'rried to next ac. count; the net profit on the two months' working was 1,6471.

The London, Norwich, and ;Northampton Boot and Shoe Company in their monthly circular make the following statement with regard to the managem ent of the Govermuent contract business:- 'It should be publicly known that the treatment of our manufacturers by the Government has been most unfair, and such as must prevent respectable tradesmen from ten. dering; cc s.sequently the Government at the present time are rather beBggas than buyers of goods. This state of things is not conducive to the well-being of the public sernice. Much of it arises from the caprice exrcised ia rejecting goods for the most trivial and unavoidable devia- tion from sample, not in any way affecting their value or duability. The parties employed to receive such goods appear to overlook the fact that boots and shoes are made by maLny hundreds of different workpeople, and there. fore the impessibility of every pair being xaoty aike, as4 I
RA IL WA Y AND MINING SHARRAS. Ssturday Evening. The railway-market has been quiet, and in some cases a Eli ht decline has taken place. Eastern Counties, 1Nondon and North-Western, and Midland closed rather lower, while a fractional improvement occurred in Caledonian. In Canadian the late advance was not filly maintained, Grand Trunk and Great Western of Canada showing some weak. ness. French shares were generally better, except Lyons and Geneva, which receded 10s. ; LombardoVenetian slightly improved. In American Illinois Central shares and New York and Erie declined. The transactions in mines have been confined to Alfred Console and United Mexican; the latter are firm at the late advance. There was no alteration in joint-stock banks. In miscellaneous securities a fnrther heavy fall took place in Canada Land. nUnTVx Av 12V QU. - - --

STATE OF TBADE. MANCHESTER, OCT. 3. There has not been much business this morning, but tbe market for yarns is steadier than in the earlier part of the week, and cloths are held for fuU prices. There is a good business doing for Chinia in cloth, with some operations for the saume market in water twist. Some fair purchases of cloth are reporned for Bombay and Calcutta, and there has also been some business In yarns for India. For the home trade there is a steady bosiness in most kinds of cloth suitable, and she demand for these goods having for some time past entirely taken off production, the makers are asking Nery full prices. The suspension of payments by a silk house, that of Messrs. J. and J. Beard, with liabilities exceeding 40,0001., is one of a namber of failures that have 2ecently taken place in the slk trade. There are some heavy cleditors in the present in3tauce In Macclesfield. BIRMINGHAM, OCT. 3. Since the preliminary quarterly meeting of ironmastera held at Wolverbampton on Wednesday nothing new has occurred with regard to the present state and future prospects of the trade. Foreign orders have, however, been given out at the quotations of last quarter, and for sbeet-iron the demand is said to be good. Beat mine pigs are quoted at 41. 5a. Wednesday next being ap. pointed as the National Fast-day, the quarterly meeting will not be held at Wolverhampton, and the attendence on the foUowing day in this town is expected to be unusually numerous. The concluding meeting of the quarter wil be held in Dudley ont Saturday evening. Although the coal trade was only incidentaUy mentioned at the meeting at Wolverhampton on Wednesday last, it was stated to be remarkably brisk, and that an advance of prices was in contemplation. This, however, will not be determined upon until the meeting at Stourbridge on Friday next. Fresh mines are, however, being daily opened, and in the face of augmented supplies Itwill, It is thought, be difficult to support enhanced rates. Lord Stamford, it is said, has commenced new pits upon the Envifle estate, which there is every reason to believe will spee'ily become a vast producing coal-district. There has been little if anY change in the copper-market during the week, but, if anything, prices are somewhat weaker than when last quoted. Purchases are more easily effected; while at the same time the brasfounders of the towvn are proportionately more active. Most of the leading establishments are full of orders, and the workpeople well employed. The general trades of the town are preparing for the quarterly settlements. Upon the approach of quarter-day orders a&t usually less freely given out than earlier in the quarter, bat the improved demand for manufIctured articles for the country trade keeps the great body of our manufacturers fairly occupied. The accounts from the mnuufacturing districts of Sbffordahire continue to be favourable. The activity of the Iron trade imparts considerable spirit to other branches of local industry, and the iron foundries generally are well employed. The closing of the London works at Smethwick (late Sir Charles Fox and Mr. Henderson), creates, however, considerable gloom in that neighbourhood. The sale of the entire stock and plant commences on Monday, and wfill last the greater part of the ensuing fortnight. As yet no direct intimation of any intended successors to the works has been given, bnt from all we hear it is not improbable that the sae of the plant will afford some indication of a contemplated new company. The machinery will lose half its value if removed. NOTTINGHAM, Ocr. 3. The lace trade is quiet, and there has not been much doing this week in any particular baneh. A few more buyers for the home market are here, but they continue to purchase sparingly. Silk continues very high, and manufacturers are still unwilling to create stocks at the present dearness, of smaterial. Yarns are lesa firm. The hosiery trade is without alteration. Some orders for articles for the winter season aro being placed, but, upon the whole, this branch of the staple manufacture is very quiet, houses for the most part working to order, and which they appear determined to persist in as long as silk sed cotton remain at the high rates at which they are now selliDg. LEEDS, OCr. 3. The woollen cloth trade continues rather quiet,both manufacturers and merchants acting cautiously, confining their operations to the most bon4Jlde business. The buyers from a distance purchase but small quantities of cloth, and the sbipping housos are not so busy as they were a month ago. Prepartions are making, but not very briskly, for spring goods, and these give a little work, but, notwithstanding, short time among the mills is increasing. The most saleable goods in the market are unions and heavy cloths for winter wear. Late prices are held firmly by the manufacturers, -who say it is impossble for them to reduce them, and have a living profit, as wool and dye wares aro both creeping upwards. Though several of the manufacturers are running their machinery short time, the operatives are in the main well off, having had for a long period plenty of 'work at good wages. In the cloth-halls to-day there was a moderate attendance of buyers, hut they only bought small lots, generally to make up the assortment of st,ock. The is ne of the market was steady upcon the whole, but, as in all but the very best of times, there were some who said that '"things wore fiat," LEICESTER, Ocr. 3. There Is a fair amount of buiness doing in hosiery, both for the London and country markets, the demand belng steady and healthy. Material, however, continues at an enormous price, and there aDpears to be no immediate prospect of a reduction. Very little doing in the glove branch. Yarns retain their advanced price, and are firm. The woolmarket Is dull, but former rates are supported. NORWICH, Our. 3. The montbly circular of the London, Norwich, and Northampton Boot and Shoe Company states that the foreign and colonial trade is generally healthy, although far from brisk. Recent advices are satisfactory, as they ehow that the markets are no longer glutted, and that buyers are now exercising a proper caution in their parchases, and are only forwarding such quantities of suitable goods as will feed the actual demand. This reasonable discretion at present occasions a slackness in the requirements for certain classes of goods, but It is expected that it will increase legitimate trade, and be in the end far moro remunerative to all parties than the reckless speculation which has sometimes prevailed. The abundant harvest and general employment of the working classes is evidently occasioning a fair demand at home, notwithstanding present high prices. By this means the unusually small stooks of manufactured articles now in hand are likely to be rapidly absorbed, and a good autumn trade is anticipated. In this city busine3s continues active. The manufacturers bave been complaining of the small quantity of work ob. tained during the past month, especially in best good.s, but this has boee only a temporary difficulty arising from the demands upon the best hands by the shopkeepers to sa ply lancy articles for the visitors to the Iate musical festival, HALIPAX, Ocr. 3. The report of the worsted trade here is not quite so good, Fewer orders have been received than last week, and the rnarket generally has been rather dulL These remarks apply to wool, as well as to yarns and piece goods. In October and November the trade is often rather slack, and an exception to the general rule can scarcely be expcoted this year. BRADFORD, OCT. 3, There has been no activity In any branch of the worsted trade during the past week. The wool-market is well supplied, but its tenehias been rather flat. Comparatively little business has been done either in Englsh or foreign descriptions. Bright-haired wools have been chiefly in request, and prices keep pretty firm; but if sales had been pressed somewhat esier terms must have been conceded. The demand for noils and brokes has been steady, and no change has taken place in price. In the department of worsted yarns considerable dullness prevails just now. There is, however, no noticeable alteration in rates at present, and a better trade seems to be anticipated in the course of a week ortwo. Averylimited businesshasbeendone ingoods, except for some fancy productions, such as plaids, which at a later period of thoyear are expected to come into demand. The past week's history of the Bradford trade may be summed up with tolerable accuracy by saying that the different departments remain in pretty much the same state as they 'were iu a fortnight agO; about the same degree of flatness has prevailed throughout the week, and very few new transactions of magnitude have been entered into. Both spin. ners and manufacturers seem inclined to wait awhile, in the hope that the next tide which sets lsnay provemore in their favour. The select committee appointed by the Bradford Chamber of Commerce "to inquire into the partial loss of the fine trade of the distriect has had its functions enlarged. At the lastmeeting of the council of the chamber facts and figures were brought forward showing that the supwosition that the production of worsted yarns and goods into which fine wool enters had decreased was erroneous; that, in point of fact, the contrary was the case; and that the French goods imported are not such as come iuto competition with the manufactures of the worsted district of Yorkshire. The result of the discussion which took place was that the committee previously appointed to conduct the more limited inquiry was requested to appoint out of its body a sub-committee, to consist of Mr. Behrens, Mr. Godwin, and Mr. Mitchell, for the purpose of preparitg a statement of the exports of British wool; the imports and re-exports of foreign and colonial wool, showing the quantity retained in each year for home consumption; the exports of yarns and of goods into which wool enters; and the imports of French merinos in each year, with any other faets bearing on the tade. Mr. God win, the member of the councU at whose suggestion this course was adopted, made the foUowing remark8:- He should be orry tIft went abroad that !heze wasany unwlUngnee to give prop,er information. Hte believed ueh manufacturera and otbess were ready to afford ay inlormatlon thh could tend to pro. metethe trade ofthedistrict, but Increr todo so they required to ow wvhat the p,eci.e inquiries were, and these the committee had ot yet put before them. So ar the proceedings had le4 to a geod foal of rnlsapprehenslon. The motion for inquiry was Ikelf a surmise uje toxs ws nov metlmnert i tele nOtice PaPer. Tbheother boad. nees Wa unmportant, and mas y members of the council were abeent who might have made a polnt of attending had they bsen awaOe Then, what was the Inquiry proposed? Was it an iuquiry into the qualItes of tbe wool nued, or the clamt of goods produced ? As to the wvool used, the remarks made at the last neeting weemed to poln to the attendance of foreign buyers In London as a grieracce ; butt in conversing with gentlemen in varlous branches of tlbs trade, he oould not fdd that It was looked upon as any disAdvantaTe that a plaoe so near ag London should become the chiet wool-mar et of the world. As applying to the whole country, and not, of consse, to Breidlord alone, the Board of Trade returns were satistactory. lit the uirst eight months of 1857 we had exported less Britith wool than in the dr1t eight months of 1iS, and very little more than doring the same period In laist year. And the quanltity of foreign and colonial wrol retained for home consumptlon ehowed, not a decrease, but a continual Increase. Except In 1853, It was never to large an last 3ear, end as compared with 29 yeast ago the intresso alone was larger that the whol' quantity we then retained. As to their share in this increase, he believed that, leaving out of accont mere temoorary tinctuationa, aDd aaking a fair average oomparison. the opinion of the trade was that they were using a lrger amoaut of m.o wool in the Bradford trade than they were elther 2.', or 15, orlO. or even five sears ago. He had spoken to two of the largest manufacturers of ine goads in the trade-this ws the!r opinion ; and from one of thema e received a statement anowing that ft. 1846 ouls one.toflrth of the 5arns they consumed contained line wool, whereas at the present time nearly one-balt of their conasumpUon did. The fact was, it the inquiy was as to goods Bnade of tine wool they could not omit trom the account the vatt cbsnges wbich e gd Ween made In Bradford fabric As ane a wwol was now Vut into a 64 Oobwg at 12d. or aid. e aard as into a Feor.ch merino at 2a. 3d. or 2. 6d. . yard, or ar wait fou erly u;eal In a 7.i all-wool Bradfos I fabric that was sold at 4s. a dyal. And yet at their fiest meeting the comirittee had declted to ignore all the improved fabrics the tTrae pioetired, and lililtthelr inquiry to goods made of ali wool incsanetition with the PreDch merino. Ii tbat 'were thelt object, before lai.usipg tuto the patial lom of the fioc trade ofthis datot, th. y ot,uuld. have fsot Inquired to whst extent tbat particular branch of It wa a btade we crer bad. It was true thas when French meutole W.M at double their present prioe all-wool fabrics were made In this market, not to compete with. but as An Intermediate cloth to elU below them. The vame cloths could be made still but they ould no; be sold. becaue French meriuo% were both hanasoaer and chenper. The gentleMan whopropcaed tbe committee eemed to think this was owing, nod to a drawback, but to a bounty given by the French Government on exrortation; but. wbatever that was, It esln amounted to some 71 or S per cent,. whereas 10per cent. would not be stiSBient to sell the best Irmltatlon of a French merino that hod as )et been produced in the Bradfcrd trade. It cane. therefore, to the old Wench merino questlon, on which the deputaticn from the Chamber to the French Rxhibitlon had already presented a most able reperor He was fully aware of the importance of tbat quetUon. and that the public tate was in faxour of the french aerino ; bnt when it w as que,tlou of the productIon of a particular tabric. he thounht It became a matter for the eutere.rleof Indivfdual manuniatturers, and ha did notsee how tlt chamuber could interfere beyond eailltng attention to It with auy advantage either t3 itself or to the trade. But be did think theyought to pause before committig the Chamber o t Commerce for thaclistriA tstements sodaaiWnt- as thepartsl Ios of 2F per eet, of the muost valuable part of thei trade. So far from that, the trade would hear him out in saying that the consamptionof Bradfond goods In the home trade wha never so large as in the prent yea, and fewer le w goods ,nerc required than in mrny dreTIous easoz; and ks to the foreign trade, while the expert of Yarns for the icst eingt mouths of 1r57 sowed an increae of about c i per cent. over the previous year, con- raring quantity and not value, the expot of worsned stuffs for the same time showed an increase of between l3O,etO and 4tbe,O iecaso om kbovets percnt.

The thermometer has rauged between 45 and 65, and the rainfall has been '4S inch. The eason (saya a writer In the "Norfolk Ohroniclel has been a capital one for a- tumnal cultivation. Harvest wasconcluded early and the rains permitted the free working o the stubbler, which in some yeses have been too hatd and dry for the suooesful pascage of the wcariter. A great deal of land has been cleaned and Drepared for mangold, more than we generally see in our county. Parmoer seem to have attended more to their stubblos than to plougsing for wheat, and not much land has yet been turned over, Of course, still lesa wheat bhobeen Eown, and, though we have seen a patch or two up, It may fairly be raid that the wheat seed in Norfolk haa not yet begun. IheB turnips have Improved beyond our moet sanguine expectalion, and, thougI they cannot be a regular good crop, esttl they are very much beiter than any one ventured to hope. The supply of gPss is abundant. The meadows and pastures re toll otkoep and the new- laye6r, which looked so weak in the harvest. are now covered with luxriant herbage.

MrLANCHOLY OCAs3 or AccIDNTAL PosOh-nf -A case of aecidental poisoning occrred at Durham during the past week, which resulted in the death of Mary Ann, the wife of Dr. Trotter, an eminent physician, residig in Old flvet, under circumstnces of an exceedingly anful and singular character. It appesrs, that Mhs. Trotter for some time past had been saiferi from tic douloureu.x, and during some conversation Dr. Trotter had upon the subject with Mr. Robson, surgeon, of thes Nyorth Bailey, the latter recommended a lini,iuatv in thes compound of which was tinoture of aconite. A, the time Dr. Trotter mentioned the repugnance or didhke he had to aconite in consequenco of his wife some yearsago having nearly taken it through mistake for some othermedicme. He,. ho-wever, got the liniment made up, sud applied it to the face of Mrs. Trotter, but its beneficial effects not being apparent on Sunday last he went t3a Mr. Robson's surgery to got some tincture of henbsne for her. Mr. Robson was i the surgery at the time, and state; positively that Dr. Trotter asked for acenite, which he took from a bottle oontainig the tincture, which, was securely fastened and corkedl ; while, on tho other hbsd, Dr. Trotter asserts as positively that he asked for henbane.. The tinctar was administered during the day to the decased. by Dr. Trotter under the frm impression that itwas henbane; and after takeing it she complained of sickness, and>vomited. She, however. fell asleep, and at night, feeling somewhat better, Dr. Trotter administered another- dose of the tinctare, which- speedily brought on increased sickness, and led the deceased to remark- that she wondered if any mistake had arisen on the part of Mr. Robson. Dr. Ttotter went and called up Mr; Robson during the night, and' on asking what he had gisen him during the morning, the melancholytrath was elicited, Mr. Robson rsplying that he gwve him aconite as asked for. On Dr. Trotter returning home the. deceased wa& suffering from all the symptomsooncomitant to p,oison, and in a short time afterwards she expiredL An inquest was held on the body onuThursday afternoon at the Dun Cow Inn, beWore Mr. J. Mj Favelli core"er, when after examining Dr. Trotter &nd various other.witueases, the jury returned the foUowing vardict:-" That tho deceased eame to her deethby a dose ofaconite admioistered by mls take, but how the mistake ocoarred there is no evidence to, sbowF."-Durha Counly Adviir Advertisement-Three Month Bils, LteWs, Diazies, Due, Boo&, and other publktatoue for I, in ma thbl manr Varieties. ot form, eias, and price, ame mow readr for Us1very. and to be obtalnt st any boolUeees In the kingdon.. or received carrlaefree-(on Ptepsymeut pe post tothe puOLbus.

LONDON, MfONDAY, OCTOBRR 5, 1857. IF At the Cabinet Councils held last week certain measures were deternined upon which are now made public. The standard of height for recruits enlisting for the Line is reduced; a further body of 5,000 men is held in readiness to embark for India, and 10,000 more of the Militia are to be embodied, so that the whole force will amount to 25,000 men. It cannot be doubted that these measures will meet with the national approbation, and the promptnem with which the authorities have determined on calling out a sufficient force of Militia must, above all, give asatisfaction. Although we are not disposed to be alarmists, but, on the contrary, believe that the force already despatched to the East will be suffioient to crush the rebellion, yet, in common with fihe great body of the community, we would rather bee Government err on the side of too much pre. cation. The force which will in a few months be actually on Indian ground amounts, it is stated, to about 85,000. This great army is, we need not say, fully adequate to the restoration and preservation of our power in every part of India. Indeed, if one thing more than another is proved by the events of the war, it is that no Asiatic force which can be brought together will be able to stand up against 5,000 English soldiers. The anmy, then, which the end of the year will see at the various points of disturbance need not. we think, be aug- mented in numbers ; all that is necessary is, that it should be kept up to its full strength by constant reinforcements from home. Now, this certainly is no very small task. If Crimean or Peninsular warfare was deadly, we may suppose that an advance across the torrid plaiDns of India, the long marches by day, and the bivouacs in rain and damp by night, will tell on the strength of our men. Few, indeed, may fall by the sword of the enemy, but we must expect a more than average mortality from fever, cholera, and the various maladies which fatigue and exposure bring with them. It seems, then, that an additional 5,000 men, with the meana for sending new draughts from time to time, wil be by no means an unnecessary preparation. T'he lowering the standard of height is a wise step. At the present time the great activity in all branches of trade is causing ablebodied men to be more than ever in request. They earn good wages, and live in a comfort and plenty to which they were strangers before. If, then, even in worse timies, it was necessary to recruit from among the destitute Irish peasantry, how is it likely that we should be able to obtain thousands of men at a short notice, and how absur(d is it to reject robust men because they fall a little short of the requisite standard ? It must also be remembered that the late war has taken away a large number of the class which is usually depended upon for military service. The country, in fact, drew upon the resources of after years in order to send a sufficient force to Sebastopol. The number of young men available for recruiting must always be limited; and it should be remembered by those who talk about the volunteers of other nations that England has a standing army of 140,000 men all supplied by voluntary enlistment. When we hear of a few corps of volunteers joining the regular army of a foreign State it should be remembered how smaU their numbers are, while this country, even in time of peace, furnishes a large army composed of this very class. In fact, the restlessness and activity of the country are largely represented in the regular army, and when trade and emigration are taken into account it is not to be wondered at that the supply should tend to fall short. We must, therefore, be contented for a time with an inferior material, so far as stature is coicerned. Lads less tall, but not less robust and active, must be taken as long as the old staple fails. With regard to the calling out of the Militia, we are glad it has been no longer deferred. Certainly 25,000 men are by no means too many for the wants of the country at home and in the Mediterranean. Our naval ports are to be guarded; Malta, Gibraltar, and Corfu are to be garrisoned; and the nation is to be made secure from even the suspicion of foreign aggression. As, then, the late Act of Parliament gave power to call out a sufficient force, it was as well for the Government to avail themselves of it at once. In theory the Mlilitia is the rival, but in practice it is the feeder of the regular army, and in the latter case, beyond a doubt, its operation is one of unmixed benefit. With proper management we may hope that many of the gaps made in the Indian army may be supplied by volunteers from Militia regiments. It is certainly possible that if the present contest is not brought to an end in a few months a considerably larger force of Militia will have to be embodied in order to supply the waste caused by long campaigns. The Scotch Regiments might, above all others, be called out with advantage, since they are the nurseries of the Highland Regiments, several of which are now in the East. Up to the present time we believe only one Regiment of Scotch Militiathe Lanarkslire-has been caUled out, although more than one of the others, the Stirlingshire, for instance, were equal to the Line in discipline when they were disembodied a year back. The present time may be looked upon as the very crisis of the atruggle for us in England. It cannot be doubted that the next mail or two will enable us to decide whether the mutiny is to subside or to swell to stil greater proportions. The fate of Delhi hung in the balance at the departure of the last mail. Lucknow still held out, and the last accounts received from that city by General HAVELOuK reported " all well." The first arrivals of English troops were beginning to affcmt the native mind with wholesome dread, and in a few days more the rebels would have heard in their own strongholds that England was fuly roused, and was sending out an army sufficient to crush their treason. In a few days-in three weeks, at furthest-we shall probably know what is to be the course of this portentous passage in history. It is as well therefore to have made every preparation, and to be able to act in every emergency. By means of the new measures on which the Government has resolved the country wiU be placed in readiness to meet the worst that can befaU it. ,lready the Militia regiments wil be mustering, the recruiting sergeant wiUl be getting together a larger number of volunteers now that the harvest is over, and a considerable force will be nearly ready for embarcation. The diligence which has been displayed during the last few months will then bear its fruit, and be appreciated by the nation. It is certainly satisfactorytofind that, though hardly more than a month has elapsed since the conclusion of a late and laborious session, the Government is at work again as a body, and does not leave the direction of affairs to any single MAlinister. If this time three years there had been Cabinet Coumcils to discuss the march of affairs it is probable that some of the calamities which ensued might have been averted. One thing at least the nation has gained in the intervaL It has impressed its rulers with the knowledge that negligence in the conduct of military affairs is an offence neither to be forgiven nor forgotten. The Government may now, we think, be safely trusted to manage matters without the assembling of Parliament, unless the news from India should prove to be, what we do not expect, more and more threatening. Power has already been given to ennbody the Militia, and, if matters continue only reasonably prosperous, no one, we think, will want to hear of speeches and debatea before February next.
The present state of the Chinese question is such as only six months ago could not have been imagined by any statesman, of any side, or by any political outsider, of the most speculative and irre. sponsible class. Notwithstanding the great care taken in these days by all sorts of public men to record predictions embracing all possible contingencies, we feel sure that the actual result at this date eludes the skill and industry of the whole pack of soothsayers. At the former date the nation was absolutely unanimous, and exceedingly urgent that Comnmissioner Yxi, and if necemary his master, should, with the least possible delay, be brought to terms of the most costly and igaominious character. We say that the nation was unanimous, for the only point on which parties were at issue was the retrospective one, whether the right was on our side. Both parties were agreed that, rightly or 'wrongly, YEU and the Cantonese must be punished andcoerced, compensation must be exacted, and Europeans admitted into China. The present state of things is a singular commentary on that universal enthusiasm. We are doing nothing, and are content to do nothing. Nor is there onlyone obstacle to our doing atnything. We aU know what an absurd and grotesque satisfaction people sometimes derive from a concurrence of disappointments when they discover that even if one obstacle had not intorposed another- would; and an obstacle, consequently, has been wasted upon them. Our ahips and our 5,000 men, sent in hot haste to Canton, have been diverted to Calcutta, and Lord EwGr? finds himself vis-d-nis with the truculent and obstinate Commissioner without a soldier at his elbow. The expedition along the Chinese coasts, that was to have struck terror into a hundred populous cities, fleets of pirates, archipelagoes of islands, and a sea alive with fishermen, and that was to have been seen even from the towers of Pekin, was suddenly paralyzed. We could merely vent our wrath in a system of paltry retaliations, destroying war junks and river forts, only to get back to Hongkong in rather worse condition than we left it. This was a conjuncture that nobody expected, and, if we could spare a single pang from India, a very disappointing one. Here, however, comes the odd consolation. It appears that anyhow, even if lIord ELGiN had had ten thousand men with hin, and a fleet in proportion, we must have been obliged to defer the expedition to the Peiho. Lord E&Gon took out, in all innocence, a letter to the French Admiral, which he fondly imagined was to urge that functionary to immediate and effective co-operation. When the French Acdmiral opened the letter he found that it charged him most peremptorily on no account to stir till the arrival of the French Plenipotentiary, which would not be till very near this present month. October happens to be rather an unpleasant time for naval operations in the Chinese waters, and it is not impossible that when the French Plenipotentiary comes at last he may wish to consider a while what is next to be done. It is also not impossible that, as the soldiers would have had to wait for him, h-e may then have to wait for the soldiers. The result is that hoatile operations, and even an armed negotiation, the only negotiation that can lead to anything, are adjourned sine die. Nobody can claim the result as a triumph, and nobody that we know has pretended to claim it. Whichever way one regards it, one sees only the falibility of all human prescience. The Chinese expedition cannot be a matter of regrat, however abortive for its purpose, and however ridiculous the aspect it derives froma the event, when it turned out the most opportune aid, almost the salvation, of our Indian Empire. It has preceded direct reinforcements by, we fear, as much as two months. Yet no credit can be claimed for an expedition the first object of which has been treated by I its authors with the utmost contempt, and which has been carried off thousands of miles to another. Then it may be said plausibly, perhaps truly, that the attention bestowed on the Persian and Chinese Wars, not to fsay the Burmese, which we had not been long out of, and the mere factI of our having two costly wars on our hands, ren- dered Government inattentive to the demand for| more troops made by the Indian Government. Things must indeed have been bad when at the beginning of the year that Government had to temporize with mutineers at its own fort of Barrackpore till the arrival of European regiments from Pegu. The state of things had long been known here. Why were not five or ten thousand men sent out at once, to make up the proportion of Europeans in the North-Western Provinces ° Malice might suggest that Government was full of Persia and China. But malice does not suggest it; for not only must malice admit the Chinese expedition to have been a positive godsend to India, but malice has a sore conscience on another point. It was malice that with a majority of the House of Commons at command was, six months ago, compelling retrenchment, the reduction of army and navy, and the abaudonment of taxes, without a week's delay. Never was there a more exigent or furious clamour. For the first time that we remember we found ourselves anticipated by the reduction of the Incometax, and surprised by the economy of the Budget. With retrenchment as the absolute condition of power, Government was naturaUy induced to try if India could tide over the litlde difficulty this year, as she had often done before when the cry of "Wolf" had been raised. It is said, indeed, that China was a matter not for the imperial, but for the Indian Treasury. But, as it happens, at that very time the two Treasuries were halving the costs of the Persian War; and it is a very old and general belief that England will ultimately have to pay every shilling spent in India. Malice, then, as we have said, being obliged to hold its tongue about the army and navy, and about India, has not a word to say about the lame and impotent conclusion of the Chinese expedition, thus far at least. So what is to be done in the interval? Everybody should be taught, when young, to use scrape of time. A man once wrote a voluminous work while waiting for his wife, a quarter of an hour at a time, though we know not whether it was found equally available for readers under like circumstances. What is to be done when 20 coal waggons, half as many Covent-garden carts, a proportion of hand trucks, a barricade of granite across your main thoroughfare, a bridge-toll, a bad cab horse, and a crowded station bring you just in time to see the door closed in your face, and you have to wait for another train? *What is to be done when you sprain your ankle down in Scotland in the midst of the long vacation? Make the best of it. Do something that you would not otherwiee have done, or would have postponed, perhaps, to a less convenient time. So Lord ELGiN goes to Calcutta, and leaves there his best ship, his big guns, and his aeamen. Our own correspondentt takes a cruise along the coast, lookiDg at woody heights, populouscities, groups of islands; mouths of rivers, war junks, pirates, fishermen, and water-postmen, recording photographic impressions of that very strange land. He collects observations by that select number of mortals who know China well, gives us a little insight into the tricks of the tea trade, conveys suggestlons that would otherwise only be found in blue-books when no longer available, and establishes a medium between English opinion and Chinese affairs. Everybody may know something about the country his tea comer from, and the trader who brings it; and the next treaty made with the Celestial Empire will not be the worse for a little previous discussion at home. We have great confidence that, as the expedition has not been thrown away, neither will the delay be found injurious. The only thing to prevent it is the chance of a still more extraordinary element findlug i'cs way into the Chinese complication. What if the rebels should anticipate us in the capture of Canton, and destroy at once our enemy, our creditor, and our pledge? What if, whjle we are quarrelling, demanding compensation, and battling about terms, a carcase lies before us ? Certaiuly our work wvll be done for us, but what will be the good of it? That would not answer our purpose. But stranger things have happened, this very year for example.
It is no matter of surprise that, under the peculiar State regimen to which France and Frenchmen are now subjected, the French press should be on the look-out for arguments to defend their own system of government and to depreciate ours. We say this without intending any reflectiL. upon the French press, which has been particularly anxious lately to do justice to England, and has in its portraiture of us, its estimate of our national character and motives, and its description of the principles upon which our empire has been founded, shown a discrinination-if wemaysay so courteously I -rather unusual among our neighbours, and which, perhaps, betrays the influence of one remarkable person over it-one who has had tbe best opportunities of studying us, and whose hints, apart from any authority accompanying them, would be vwell worth taking. But, with the best feelings for each other, we must criticize each other's Governments. There is no alternative. France has her regimen, and we have ours. The two are diametrically opposed and start from contrary principles, and therefore both cannot be the best. We may say, philosophically, that each suits its own people the best; but that, again, is not a very satisfactory conclusion for one or other of the two nations, for the nation which the best of the two systems of government suits has, at any rate, the luckiest conformation of the two. Some mutual criticism is thus unavoidable on this subject. An article in the Constitutionnel takes advantage of the Belfast riots to draw a comparison between our two regimens very much in favour of Absolutism. We are told that we have no idea of preve2dticn, that we let everybody do what he likes, and allow things to get into confusion, aud then, when a great deal of mischief has been done, bring in the arm of the State to rectify the disorder; whereas in France Government is preventive, and does not allow the mischief to arise in the first instance. This is the distinction between us, involving all the superiority on their side which prevention has over cure. Ours is an irregular, unwieldy, awkward piece of machinery, always going wrong, and requiring somebody constantly to step in and correct this, that, and the other jar, stoppage, and disorder. The individual is everything with us, his rights and his humours exclusively attended to; and this liberty is all very pleasant for a time, but the excess is sure to cwme and to require a forcible and painful remedy; whereas in France the Government wisely checks the rights of the individual in the fint instance, and thus forestalls the disagreeable necessity of correoting his extravagances. Now, we question whether this contrast does full justice to the case. It is all veiy well for the advocate of a " preventive" regimen to point to the extravagances aud excess which take place under the other system; but if a freeer system gives room for a great deal of extravagance, he forgets the quantity of sUypression for which his own system is responsible. If one regimen leads to some disorder, the other may suppress an incalculable quantity of good. It is quite true we do not see this suppression so clearly as we do that disorder ; it is hidden to a considerable extent from our eyes. It is a mute, dumb thing; it is not, in its vely nature, a violent demonstration of any kind, a row in the streets, a fight with brickbats and bludgeons, attended with broken heads and smashed ribs; it is a silent affair, a negation, a privation. But what an amount o^ real misery may go on underneath the surface of society in the shape of mere suppression of natural liberty and denial to the individual of the proper room for the exertion of his faculties and powers ! The natural happiness of man lies in the exertion of these gifts, and, therefore, so far as you interfere with this exertion you deprive him of his means of happiness. How much bitter, angry discontent is going on in France at this moment in those classes which by their education are fitted for taking part in public business, and would relish the work keenly if they were allowed ! WVhat a large stock of eloquence, or, at any rate, public speaking of some kind, of administrative power of some kind, of literary power, argumentative po ver, and all those powers which have public life ,or their field, and for which liberty of free discussion is necessary, lies wholly inactive, ard consciously inactive, now in France,-totally suppressed ard deprived of aUl vent whatever by the exdsting French regimen! We do not mean to say thatFrance is prepared for another regimen, or that this is not on the whole the best for her a-t present; but these are actual evils, and very great evils. Compare with the constant hard pressure of such a regimen as this on whole classes the temporary mischief of a Belfast row occurring every now and then in consequence of the individual abusing his liberty, and what an insignificant evil does the latter appear by contrast ! Our constitution gives free scope to all those faculties which have public life in any shape for their field, and in so doing it does a great deal towards making society happy. Every towvn in the country has its public calls, which bring out these public tendencies in our nature. Every town has its public boards, council-rooms, popular meetings, corporate celebrations, meetings for management of charitable institutions, markets, street paving, gaslighting, and what not, which bring men together to talk and plan. True, there is an appalling quantity of nonsense talked on all these occasions; but, on the whole, the clear heads get the upper hand, and, at any rate, a sphere is provided for the public man. The nation is provided with a vast quantity of activity, which is pleased with its own exertion. Imagine any English town going on without these vents,-what a totally different place it would be ! We should lose our identity as a nation if we had not our local Legislatures everywhere, and above them the great field of Parliament and high public life, as the collective vent of the national minx Yet these restraints on the exercise of the intellectual faculties are not the most oppressive form in which the restrictive policy of our Gallican neig,hbours displays itself. Many a man would willingly forego the privilege of freedom of speech or writing, if he could obtain a little of that personal liberty, which is the foundation of aU other liberty, civil or religious. In this country the law presumes that every man is not only competent to tal e care of hinself, but fit to be intrusted with absolute control over his own movements until he is proved guilty of any misconduct, In France every man is asumed by law to be a criminal, unless he can produce testimonials to the contrary. What is a paswpert but a " ticket of leave," which guarantees the holder for the time being against the penalty of being treated as a rogue and vagabond t But is the Constitutionnel so sure, after all, that what it calls the " preventive" system does prevent excesses ? Is Absolutism so wholly preventive, and has it never to step in in the vulgar and awkward capacity of corrector, and to be very quick about it, too, for fear the whole social fabric should give way and chaos rise again ? Has France herself exhibited no scenes of this kind during the last twenty years? Our contemporarywil not much care for English experience and wise saws and maxims, but the doctrine we hold in this country is that the system of individual liberty, on the whole, leads less to revolution than Absolutism does, and facts are certainly not against us here. There is no smothered volcano going on, gathering force till at last it breaks out and overwhelms a country. A few little rows are, after all, no bad exchange for a revolution. We can put up with a noisy mob every now and then, some smashing of windows, a good many bloody noses, injured shins, and scurrilous jokes, if our regimen, as a whole, saves us from periods of anarchy. These latter are very serious affairs for a country, but, if we may be so bold as to say so, we do not think a Belfast row is. It is not, at any rate, quite so important an event as the Coustitutionnel seems to think. It never occurred to any of us here to regard it as a serious proof of the bad work?ing of the British constitution. Nothing can exceed the s ty of our contemporary; he speaks like a Platonic philosopher, he summons the phraseology of ancient wisdom to his side, he talks of the " dominion of the community" and the " dominion of the individual," and he thinks that the latter has wholly triumphed in this country, and that the former is prostrate in the dust, because Dr. HANNA has been preaching in the open air, and some mobs collected to hear him or to hoot him. We can assure him that his estimate of this event in a very exaggerated one, that it produced no terror, and that we had, to say the truth, almost forgotten it, tiU his own most oracular comment on it appeared, and we knew for the first time how narrow an escape we had had. We admire the gravity and the philosophy of our contemporary, but we must tell him at the same time we all of uB here know pretty weU what that grand phrase of his, " the dominion of the community," practically means with him, and that we are not particularly fond of it in his sense. We are vulgar enongh to prefer " the dominion of the indi" vidual," if we are to understand bythat phrase that the individual is not to be put into a straitwaistcoat or gagged, but allowed within decent limits to have his owvn way. We have no grand philosophy to offer on this subject, but, speaking like common men, we must say that most persons lile their own way best, and that it is as well to let them have it where their liberty does not interfere with others. This is our constitution, and, though it is not Platonic, it is found, we believe, on the whole, not inconvenient.

THE PENINSULAR MAILS. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Tagus, CJaptain E. Christian, arrived at Southampton on Saturday evening with the mails from Spain, Portugal, &-c., in charge of Lieutenant Gardiner, R.N., Admiralty agent. Her dates are-Gibraltar, Sept. 26th; Cadiz, 27th; Lisbon, 29th; and Vigo, 30th. The Tagus did not caU at Oporto, in consequence of the quarantine regulations established by the Lisbon Board of Health with reference to vessels leaving that port for Oporto. She had fine weather throughout tho voyage. This packet brings 18 first and 2 second class passengers, 6 packages of specie value 1,9431. sterling, a package of gold coin value 50 doubloons, and a cargo consisting of 163 half - chests of lemons, 14 serons and 182 boxes of almonds, 410 boxes, 204 half ditto, and 132 quarter ditto of raisins, 100 barrels of figs, 239 boxes of grapes, and 59 oases of sundries. Advices from Gibraltar are to the 26th ult., at which date Her Majesty's ships Curlew and Conqueror, Captain Yelverton were lying in the bay, the latter vessel having arrived there that morning. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Ripon, with the India and China mails o' the 20th ult. from Southampton. arrived at Gibraltar on the 25th, at 12.30 p. m., and resumed her voyage to Malta and Alexandria at 7 o'clock the same evening. An unknown schooner went ashore near the first river about noon on the 25th. About 9 o'clock on the morning of the 26th, the Portuguese schooner, Cruz e Gonqalves, Francisco AL da Cruz, master, bound from Huelva for Newcastle with a cargo of mineral ore, foundered off the New Mlole, having sprang a leak on the night of the 24th, during very rough weather, when near Cape St, Mary's. When the captain discovered the leak he endeavoured to make for Cadiz, but, finding the weather unfavourable for that purpose, he shaped his course to Gibraltar as the nearest port. Immediate assistance was rendered by the boats of Her Majesty's ships Vulture and Curlew, and by the steamtug Ward. The schooner went down in deep water, so that there was no chance of saving her. All the crew were happily saved. Gibraltar exchanges on the 26th were quoted as under:London, 90 days date, 50Q; Paris, ditto, 5f. 37c.; Marseiles, ditto, 6f. 38c.; Genoa, ditto, 5f. 39c.; Madrid, 8 days' sight, I1 dis.; Cadiz, ditto, I dis.; Malaga, ditto, par; Seville, ditto, t dis.; Alicante, ditto, 7 dis Valencia, ditto, A dis.; Barcelona, ditto, a dis. Spanish pillared dollars, 4 per cent. premium, none; in demand. Carolus, 16 per cent., none; in demand. On the 28th ult., at 6 a.m., the Tagus passed the cutter Mary, of Portsmouth, steering to the north-west. The Sardinlan steamer Turino wrrived at Lisbon on the 28th ult., cn route from Brazil to Genoa, but her dates are older than those brought by the Teutonl&. The Lisbon exchange transactions were very Umited for this packet, bills at three months being negotiated at 54, and some demand over; Paris, 528; Amsterdam, 42i; Hamburg, 481; and Genoa, 57. The stock-market was extremely dull, and quotations for Three per Cents. nominal, 47 to 474 registered; Coupons, 464 to 47; Deferred, 28 to 281. Bank shares without material altera. tion. The elections for 20 vacancies in the Portuguese House of Deputies had been generally favourable the to Government, but the partisans of the late Administration were victorious in one of the Lisbon districts and the Government in the other. Fever at Lisbon still contInuos to prevail, but in a mitt gated form. The cases during the last 15 days were estimated at about 300 and the deaths 100. The King Don Pedro had paid a visit to the Fever Hospital, and thus evinced his con viction that it was not contagious. Our correspondent at Oporto writes as follows on the 28th:- I.T-e exchange fo? the packet was done at 54. for bills on London at 90 days' date of first-rate paper.

THE TYNITPJD) SPAPPR (FROM OUR NEW YORI t-OPRrV.rn lW1'T NEW YORK, SmPr. 22. On the night of Saturday, the 12th inst., in a gale of unprecedented severity, which dizabled many vessels supposed to be less seaworthy than the Central America, that steamer went down, carrying with it between 400 and 500 persons. Sinoe the los of the Arctic three years since, when many of the best connected and best known persons of America sank beneath the waters of the Newfoundland banks, there has been no marine disaster so awful or spreading such wide gloom as that which I have now to record. The Central America left Havannah upon the 8th of September with 491 passengers and 101 crew,in all 592 persons. Of these, so far as we know, only 173 are saved. The weather was mild, and the wind favourable when they left. Soon after they had got to sea the wind freshened, and before they had been out 24 hours was blowing a gale; the gale increased to a hurricane, which lashed the sea into ungovernable fury. It is not clear from the testimony at precisely what time it was discovered that the ship was making water; it would seem, however, that it was as early as the morning of the 11th. As in the case of the Arctic, the men inthe engine department first discovered it. The captain was informed of it, and set aU hands to work to remedy it, but the communication with the coal bunkers was soon cut off, the fires went out, and the vessel fell into the trougb of the sea. An effort was made to reduce the amount of water. The men were formed into baling parties, and did their work manfully. When they tired even the women came forward to help the work of salvation. Steam was again got up, and an effort was made to rig the donkey engines so as to clear the hold. The effort was temporarily successful, but the engines (or the pumps) soon got out of order and ceased to work. The sea aU thia time was running at a fearful height and dashing against and over the helpless vesseL After in vain attempting to again get up steam,for it was got up only to be lost again for ever,-and after it was found that the water was hopelessly gaining upon them in spite of all baling and pumping, and in spite of all efforts to stop the leak, the captain next tried to make a drag by cutting away the foremast, so as to get her again head on; but in carrying out this wise expedient the mast unfortunately fell so as to be swept under the hull, where it for some time remained, striking with great force in such a way as probably to increase the leak. By paying out enough hawser they got a drag, which brought them for a while head on; but the hawser parted before long, and left them again at the mercy of the waves. The hold was by this time well filled, and the water was in the lower cabins-warm water, heated at times by the boiler as the vessel careened over, so as to be almost unbearable. The women and the children, driven from their own cabin, had gathered in the men's saloon. The rough California miners, who made a large part of the passengers, had gathered together their golddust, the savings of years, and bound it about them, like Tom Thurnall, in belts,-whether to share their safety if safety came, or possibly to pay their ferriage in case of need, should a worse fate overtake them, does not appear. The captain appears to have been everywhere, like a gallant officer, giving every needful order and personally superintending its execution; like a noble-hearted man, cheering the timid aud especially infusing confidence into the hearts of the women. On the afternoon of Saturday, the 12th, when hope w;as about departing, the brig Marine, of Boston, hove in sight, and, although herself disabled by the gale, came to render such assistance as she could. To the honour of human nature these rough miners stood peaceably by while the women and children 'were put into the boats and transferred to the Marine. Boat after boat left, and yet they made no effort to fill them. The captain himself stood by and superintended the lowering of the women into the boats. It is one of the noblest examples of selfsacrifice on record-that of these rough men, unused to restraint, accustomed to selfishness, permitting the helpless women aud children to be the first to pass from danger to safety. When the last boat had gone with the women a terrific sea broke over the steamer. She gave a plunge and sank. By this time night had come on; the face of the ocean was dark except when whitened by the foam. All were sucked down in the vacuum-the captain from the wheelhouse, spyglass in hand, the passengers from the deck. When they rose again masses of the wreck rose with them, wounding and maiming many, so as to cause death. A scene ensued for those who survived surpassina all the romance of shipwreck, all the horrors with which imagination has invested it. A flash of lightning broke the veil of darkness, and revealed several hundred persons, amid masses of wreck, floating helplessly on the surface of the Atlantic, with nothing but life-preservers or some fortunate door or bench between them and eternity; each one tried to cheer the others. The charms of companionship were added to mitigate the horrors of the scene. Scarcely a published account that does not speak of some one helped or cheered on that horrid night, when they lay floating at the mercy of the waves, and tossed about by the fury of the storm. A friendly vessel picked them up in the morning one by one, slowly, those who had survived-spending hours in the search of them. The survivors were first carried to Norfolk, and the day before yesterday arrived pennyless and almost naked at this port. The owners of the vessel have now taken it in hand to probe this matter to the bottom, and determine where the blame lies. Next to the loss of life by this accident the loss of treasure at so inopportune a time, is a severe calamity. The drain of specie from the country to supply the wants of the New York banks during the present crisis has been going on so steadily that they are now feeling the pressure worsethan we are here. Several heavy failures have taken place in Boston and Philadelphia, and others are looked for. The treasure by the Central America would have been of great service in restoring confidence and pUtting the banks on a sounder footing. The New York banks contilue the contraction in their line of discounts and the in, crease of their specie. The weekly average reported. to-day as compared with last week is as foUows .- 8eDi17, 857.

tHEB LOSS OF THE CENTRAL AMERICA. UMVE1`POOL, SATUIUDAY Thte following itenms respecting the lom of the 6teamahip Central America' are extracted from the details of 'the catastrophe published in the papers brought by the Europa ._ "Of the 23 ohildren who were saved the greater part 'were babies. The steWardess of tho steamer was a stout 'Megro woman. She had collected the money thrown away 'by the passengers, it was supposed, and buckled it around 'te body. The wei;Zht of this money was the cause of her death 'when she was hoisted into the Marine, where she died fromn having too much gold about her loins. One of the ladies placed her cacary bird in her bosons on leaving the steamer and preserved its life. "Mr. George, who wert down with the vessel, says :-He heard no shriek, nothing but the seething rubh and hiss of 'waters that closed above her as ahe hurried, almost with the "sed ofanarrow, toherocean bed. Night had closed inbefore the vessel sank, and he was sucked in, by the whirlpool caused by her swift descent, to a depth that in its seeming was unfathomable, and into a darkness that he had never drsamt of. Compared with it the blakest niight, without 3noon or star, was as the broad noonday. lie was rather stunned than stifled, and his sensations on comiing to the surface were alnost as painful, from their reaction, as -those which he endured at the greatest depth to which be sank. When he became conscious, after the lapse of a minute or two, he could distinguish every object around him for a considerable dii. tance. The waves, as they rose and fell, revealed a crowd of human heads. Those unfortunates who had lost their he-preservers or planks while under water, owing to 'the force of the whirlpool, were frantically snatching at the - broken pieces of the wreck, which, breaking from the ship .as she continued to descend, leapt above the snrface and tell back with a heavy splash. Their cries arose thus minOled into one inarticulate wail, and then the lustier and 'rcss terrified shouted for a.ssitance to the bark Marine, "which was far beyond bailing distance. The waves dashed 4hern one against another at hrst, but speedily they began to separate, and the last farewells were taken. One man called to another in our informant's hearing, ' If you are saved, Frank, send my love to my dear wie ;' but the friend appealed toanswered only with a gurgleof the throat. Hie was washed off the plank, and perished as his companionspoke. ,11any were desirous of separating themselves as far as pos. sible from the rest, being fearful lest some detoeratestruggler xnight seize hold of them ard draw them under. Others, afraid of their loneliness, called to their neighbours to keep together. Generally, they strove tocheer each other as long as they remained within hearing, and when the roar of the waves drowned all but the loudest shouting the caU of friendship or the cry of despair was heard in the distance, and infused confidence or increased dismay in nmany a failing bosom. "I it was when he had drifted far from the companionship of any of his fellows in inisfoxtune that Mr. George began to realize his situation. The night was quite dark. Occasionally, as the driving clouds parted and gave a glimpse of sky, a star or two would be visible, but this was very seidom, and offered but the faintest gleam of hope that the inorning would dawn fair and calm. The swell of the sea vas great, and successively the poor floaters, holding on to their planks with the energy of despair, were riding on the brink of a precipice and buried in a deep valley of water. Our informant, like many of the rest, was seized with the lear of sharks. Xespiration was very oiflicult, owing to the masses of water which were constantly dashed upon them, as wave after wave rolled by. For two or three hours the water was not unpleasantly cold, and it was not until about 1 o'clock on the morning of Sunnay, when they had been nearly five hours in the water, and a fresh chiling wind arose, that their limbs began to feel benumbed. "Some of the incidents described to us as occurring before or about that timo are truly thrilling. One man, floating in solitude, and tprrified at bis loneliness, after shoutig himself hoarse to find a companion, saw at length a man with two life-preservers fastened about his body drifting towards him. His heart leaped with joy at the 'welcome sight, for the feeling of desolation which had over. come him was terrible to endure. He called to the other to join him, if possible,and nade everyexertion to meethim halfway. There was no reply, but the other drifted nearer and rearer. A wave threw the,,, together; they touched. The living man sbrieked in the fate of a corpse. The other had been drowned by the dash of the billows or had perished froiim exhaustion. " When rising and falling with the swell of the waves the Eghts of the bark Ellen were first discerned by the sirvivors in the water; the thrill of hope that at once fiiled every breast amnuunted,it may well be believed,to a perfectecstasy. Let Mr. George sneak for all. He says: 'I never felt so thankful en all my life. I never knew what gratitude was before. I do not know wbether I cried or not, but I know I was astonished to hear niy own laughter ringing in m y years. I do not know why I laughed. That verse, I (:od moves in a mysterious way,' kept passing in and out of iiie-tbrough me, rather, as if I hai been the pipe of an organ. lt did not come to me by my own volition, but somehow made me retnember it. When the lights approached nearer a score of voWies sprang up around ine, crying 'Ship ahoy,' 'Boat ahoy,' and then I began to shout too. And I had never any doubt that I should be saved till I saw the lights pals by, about half a mile from where I was, and recede in the distance. Then I began to give myself up for lost indeed. But I slowly drifted toward her again, till I could make out her bull and one of her mabts, and presently I 'doated closo to her, and shouted, and was taken up. When I got on the deck I could not stand. I did not know till then bow exhausted I was.' Mr. George, before he was rescued encountered six men clinging to a log of wood, two of whom were washed off in his sight,within a shortdistance of the bark. The others nBust haveafterwards shared the same fate, as they were not taken on board the bark and were -never again seen. Mr. George thinks a raft could have lived, but no attempt was made to construot one. " A little girl who was saved along with her brother says:- 4 ' About 10 o'clock on Saturday a gentlemiian came down and took uis up into the saloon; my father was with us; he handed me his money and told we to keep it-perhaps I might be saved and he not. This was before we came in 6ight of the brig. After we got in sight of the vessel I handed it back to bimi; I told him that it was too heavy, Then they caUe i us up to the lifeboat. I came on in the second boat to tho brig. I think the terror will never le^ve my heart. I felt as though I had almost as lief go down with the ship as to get off. I have not heard from father since I lef t him on Saturday,; I think he is lost.' "When the boat castoff from the steamer Captain Herndon 8aid, 'Tell the captain of the brie for God's sake to remain by us; that I have 500 people onboard and two msillions of treasure.' When we arrived in the brig Mr. Black com'mur.icated this request to Captain Burt, whoreplied at once, -' Ay, zy; tell him I'll stand by him.' It is alleged that the boats' crews declined to return to the wreck, for fear of being swamlped. "A passenger says,-' Life-preservers were plenty, and 4acb had secured one for himself. On coming up I found plenty of things to cling to, aud got hold of a door, which held on to about 15 minutes, til three Irishmen grabbed it, when I left it, as I was becoming so numub that I was obliged to warm up by a little swimming exercise. Though a large quantity of material was floating about, still there was a good deal of desperate struggling and fighting 'to aproprlate articles promising the most security. I next gotro direct trunk, but it soon feel to pieces. But a flour Ertel directly came in my way; in clinging to it I soongot chilled and had occasionally to leave st and swim to get -warm. But I did not let it get far out of my way. I observed the Irishmen still fightina for the door the last I saw of them, anl they are doubtless lost. " Another passenger says :-' Nearly all the passengers had been provided with life-preservers, but m.'nv of them had lost all hope and become discouraged before the critical monent arrived, and when the slhip sunk they lacked the energy to make any effort to save themselves, while others wore affrighted out of all presence of lnind and lacked the judgment to convert to their use means which might have seen rendered available. The majority of the crewv and a number of the passengers, at the time of the sinking of the ship, were below engaged in bailing.' " Some of the female passengers fell two or three times Iinto the sea before they could be got into the boat. One of thenm, a stewardess, fell in three tinies, aiid once was l'inched between the boat and the side of the steamer. The 'captain did his best to keep the passengers calm and cool. " It is stated by many of the survivors 'that there was 'neldom so large an amount of money owned by passengers s was in the case of those who came by the Central America. lEany wore persons of large miieas, and there were but very few whose immediate wealth did not amount to hundreds, while numbers reckoned their gold by thousands of 'dollars. 'rhe greater portion of the passengers were returned miners, some coming bither to invest the capital they had realized, in hopes to live a life of greater ease as the result of their industry, and others to get their families and once more go to the land of gold. But as the storm continued to rage, less and less of gold v'as thought of, and when. on Saturday, it became evident that they were likely at any moment to be buried beneath the waves, wealthy men divested themselves of their treasure belts and scattered the gold upon the cabin floors, telling those to take it who 'would, lest its weight-a few ounces or pounds-carry them to their demath. Fall purses, containing in some instanoes s$2,000, were laying untouched on sofa. Carpet-bags were 'opened by men and the shining metal was poured out on the 'door with the prodigality of death's despair. One of the p aseuger, vwho has fortunately been rescued, opened a bag and dashed about the cabin S20,000 in gold dust, and told bira who wantpsed to gratify his greed for gold to take it. :But it-wspassed byuantouched asthe veriest dross, A few *bours before he would have struck down the man who would LAve attempted tO take a grain of that which he nowr spurned froim him." " A passenger named Miller,who ras lost, tooka position -t the top of the teps leading to the steerage; he drew his 'revolver and threatened to shoot down any one who refused ,to work at the pumps and attempted to get upon deck. "According to tbe statement of a female saurvor,.'There 'as not a tear sahd that I anm aware of on board the rteamer up to the time we first espied the sail which we believe brou lht ts relief. There seemed to be a perfeot calmness, whicl I could not have believed it possible for suoh a num'ber of persons to exhibit under such febrful circumstanc.q ,Bat when the brig hove in sight there were tears of joy and the men worked with renewed energy and hope. The ldies begged of the men to work firmly and with aU their strength, and said they would take hold and vrork them. ,selvse if the men did not do their best Some of the women begged to he allowed to assist, and some were so anxious 'hat they even attempted to dress up in me s's clothing, zo 'that they might qo down and help in the takk. g "Of the working at the pumps a passenger says :-' It -was rather a novel spectacle to see the men at work many ,of whom had never been in the habit of phydical labour taldng hold with strength and willagness equal to the heartiest. After a while the work besan to be rather a 'serious affair for the strength and msusces. To keep up the spirit songs were sung, and every imaginable joke retaied to excite laughter and cbeer the spirits. Occasonally a man, notwithstanding the urgency of the ocasion ansd the determination of most to make the work as cheerful as possible, would fall from the ranks, and it was utterly impossible to rouse them again to aotivity. Some were corupletely exhausted physically, and had to retire from work for rewson; but it was a fact that a few gave up in despair of the possibility of savir,g the steamerfrom sinking, and would not work. The example of that few had a bad effect upon others, notwith- I standing the constant cheering remarks of the captain and officers that everything was working favourably. The men' worked faithfully all Friday night, although nuder the I serious disadvantages of but little light and no water or refreshments.'I ' Mrs. Small aad her child were in charge of Captain Ilerndon, of whom she speaks with much emotion. She was hanided into the boat bv him. He appeared sad, but very firm. ' Mrs. Small,' said he, ' this is sad; I am sorry not to get you home saWely.' With these words he turned away. "'Ar.Payne states thathe was indebted to CaptainHeradon. for his life. I was in frequent consultatioa with him before I 'went, and he asked me what I thouglht of affairs. I said, 'Thank God, the women and children are aU off, and we are strong.' lie replied, 'Yes, thank God,' and added, ' You take the nest boat.' This I did, but before I went he requested me to go into his office and get his gold vatcb and chain, and, if saved, to carry them to his wife. Said he, ' Tell her-,' but his utterance was choked by d&ep em,otion, ard he said no more on that subject, but changed it by saying he wished me to see the president of the company, Marshal 0. Roberts, and the agents, and com nmunicate with them in relation to the disaster. After saying this much he walked away a few steps and sat down on a bench, with his head in his hands. apparently overcome. He remained in that position a few moments, and then arose and resumed giving orders as the boat froll the briyg Marine returned. "1 The coniduct of the head engineer, Ashby, was strongly conidemnmd, and csme of the rescued pabsengers talked of 'lynchilng ' him. It is alleged that he abandoned the e?gine-room long before there was any necessity. It is also charged against him that in the boat there were two seats vacart, and a person jumped into one of them; at this ilnstant Ashby, bho was overseeing the shipment of the wonmen and children, drew his bowie knife, and raisiDg as if to strike the man, commanded him to get out. Hlis arm was arrested by a person near, and the man retained his place. As the boat pushed off. Ashby junped in; a general muurmur arose, and a cry was heard. 'Shoot him !' The Captain called out that he. depended upon hirn returning, which Ashby failed to do, alleging that tle hoat's erew refused to do so, fearing for their own safety. 1; is likewise stated that one of the survivors also asserts that Ashby approached hini and threatened to cut the strap which held his life-preserver roulnd his body; the interference of a passenger prevented him frorn taking it away from him. " Captain Jobnson, of the Ellen, on board of which vessel many of the rescued received very kind treatment, makes the follkwing statement:-' I was forced by the wind to sail a little out of my course before I came up with you, and on altering it a small bird flew across the ship once or twice, and then darted into my face. I, however, took no notice of this circumstance, and the same thing occurred again, which caused me to regardthe circumstance as something extraordinary; and while thinking on it in this way the mysterious )5Lid- for the third time appeared and went through the very same extraordinary manceuvres. Upon this I was Induced to rs-alter my course into the original one which I bad been steering, and in a short time I heard noises, and on trying to discover what they proceeded from discovered that I was in the midst of people who had been shipwrecked. I proceeded instantly to rescue them, and in a few momoents s'scceeded in getting four of them on board. Not one of them could speak, all being perfectly senseless from exheaustion. After a few moments we got another one on board. The first words he spoke were, ' Where is ray wife ?-give me something to eat.'" Mr. Wells, finding the vessel going down, wrenched a door from the wheel-honse. " After being on the raft about asn hour or an hour and a-halftthe ship went down, and apparently carried all on board with her. I had great diffioulty in holding on to my raft, on account of the roughness of the sea, and after having remained on it for about tvo hours I was drifted near a larger raft, on which there were five men. I then left my raft and swam to them, The darkness was so great that I could not recognize any of them. We were frequently washed off by the force of the waves, and had to swim to reach the raft again. Soon I found one of our number was misiDng. The rest of usthere were Dow five-clung to the raft as heat we could, at times beinig wasbed off, and then regainingthe raft by swimi. using to it. Towardsmorning a sea washed off all of us but one, and only two of the four succeeded in recovering the raft; they bad become so chilled and exhausted that they had not strenDth to reach it again, and were lost. This left vnly three of us on the raft out of the six that were on it." A captain (Badger) who was on board the Central Anmerica attribntes the founding of the vessel to the stoppage of the engines. She fell into the trough of the sea, and took i zimuch water through her lee shafts and dead lights. It was afterwards ascertained that the cause of the stoppage of ibo engines was the neglect of the fire and engine department of getting coal along from the bunkers to the fireroom fast enough to keep up the fires; consequently all the engines stopped, as well as all the pumps attached to the engines. An attempt was made to rai-e steam in the donkey boiler. Berths were torn and thrown into the furnace to raise the steam to start the pumps, but all to no avaiL A drag was prepared but failed, and the ship continucd in the trough of the sea. " Baling,' says Bad-ger, " went on vigorously and was kept up all night by gangs, who were changed as of ten as they became exhausted. Towards morning the msen were beginning to fail and the water to increase and grow up in the hold of the ship. At 4 o'olock on the mnorning of Saturday, the 12th, the gale abated, with a heavy sea running. They were encouraged b myself and others with the assurance that the ship woud hold out. Every passenger remained cool, and seemed to forget his danger in the united efforts to save the vesseL There was ino weeping or exhibition of despair, even on the part of the women. At eight o'clock another attempt was made to raise steam in the donkey-boiler to pump the ship, but vwithout avail. One proposed to box the pumps, but on inquiry no carpenter or tools could be found, and the water gained rapidly. The lee shaft was shrouded In heavy blankets to stop the leak, but the water burst through. At 2 o'clock on Saturday a sail was reported to windward, and at half-past: she came under the stern. Boats immediately were lowered, but were stove instantly by the sea. Three boats still remained-one in a bad condition. At 4 o'clock the work of removing the ladies and children to the deck of the Mdarinewas commenced. The brig being mauchlighter than the ship, had by this time drifted away to leeward, The distance was considerable, and the boats were long in making the trips and there being a heavy sea but few could be carried at a time. After sending the ladles and children the engineer and some 15 others were embarked on the brig. By this time It was dark. The work of baling was still kept on, but the water gained faster naster upon the vessel. As the boats successively approached the ship a simultaneous rush was made by the passengers to get on board, and it was apprehended that the boats would be filled and stove. It was now dark. Aboat two hours before the Finking of the ship a schooner ran down under our stern, but could not render any assistance for want of boats. The work of baling went on until within an hour of her going down. Two lights of the above vessel were now seen far to leeward. Rockets were fired from the wheel, but went downwards. The immediate sinking of the ship followed. Captain Hearndon remained on the wheel up to the moment of her going down, which was 8 o'clock on Saturday night. I ws standing on the quarterrdeck. S'ome jumped over, and put out from the now rapidly de cending ship, and seized on whatever they could. No one 3hrieked or cried, but all stood calm. The captain behaved nobly, and said he would not leave the shLip. I promised him I would remain with him, as also did the second officer, Mr. Frazer. All at orce the ship, as If in the agony of death herself, made a plaunge on an angle of 45 degrees, and, with a shriek from the engalfed mass, she disappeared, and 500 human beings floated out on the bosom of the ocean, with no hope but death." A paper referring to the statements of passengers says:"We found no one who would confess to a dread of dea'h pce' se. One thought of his family, his friends, and struggled for hfe for their sakes. Another wished to live that he might enjoy the treasure which he had stowed away on his person, and which woo1;d ha saved if he was. A third, who had lost everything, wanted to begin life anew, and make his fortune over again. A species of fatalism consoled souse. If their time was come it was come, and they saw their comrades in misfortune fail in their last struggle and sink with scarcely a pang. One man told us he went to sleep in the water." One survivor makes rather an amusing statemeat:-"I guess I had been about four hours in the water and had tloated away from the rest, when the waves ceased to make any noise, asd I heard my mother say, 'Johnny, did you eat sister's grapes ?' I hadn't thought of it for 20 years at least. It had gone clean out of my mind. I had a sister that died of consumption more than 30 years ago, and when Bhe was sick-I was a boy of 11 or so-a neighbour had sent her some early hot-house grapes, Well, those grapes were left in a room where I was, and-I ought to have been skinned alive for it, little raseal that I was-I devoured them a. Mother came to me after I had gone to bed, when she couldn't find the fruit for sister to moisten her mouth with in the night, and said, ' Johnny, did you eat sister's grapes Idid not addtothemeanness ot my conduct by telling alie. I oWvned up, and my mother went away in tears, but without flogging me. It occasioned me a qualm of conscience for many a year after; but, as I said, for 20 years at least I had not thought of it, till, when I was floating about berumbed with cold, I heard it as plain as ever I heard her voice in my life. I heard mother say, 'Johnny, did you eat sister's grapes 1 I don't know how to account for it It did not scare mne, though. I thought it was a presage of my death." A survivor says :-" Five hundred men, with death yawning before them at any moment, stood solid as a rock, normade a movement for the boats until the women and children had all been safely transported to the brig, after which about 49 of the crewr and msle passengerS, in a few trips, reached the latter vessel before the steamer went domn" Ssveral of the passengers whose position and intelligence, and, withal, the trying circumstances in which the ship was placed, ought to have restrained them from deporting themselves other than properly, drank excessively of liquors on board the ship, probably from their own private stores, and rmade themselves very noisy and troublesome. Two of the passengers of hi sc^ial and political assoiations, refused tO work, but got alarmingly drunk, so much so that their more sober comp'nioss had to put them in their berths. In that conldition they lay when the siteamer sank,. Others, being completely exhausted, took to their berth, and went down with the vessel. An elderly woman implored the captain to allow her husband to go in the boat with her; she was refused. Very kindly but firmly Captain Herndor, told her that no nman could leave the steamer until all the women had gone. Just before she went down into the boat her husband took her by the hand and bade her good by. He told her that he would try and meet her again, but that perhaps he would not be able. She never saw hinm again. Another woman tells a similarlypainful toty. The ongineer stou* denies the allegations made against himi. It is asserted tham thme pumps and donkey engine of the vessel were unserticksle. Sanguite hos,ei were enirtainef of the safety of the captain (Eern-bin lnd a um=ber of passengers.

THE INDIAN RELIEF FUND. DURHAM. A public meeting was held In the New Town-hail on Saturday, for the purpose of expreesing sympathy with and pro. moting a subscition for the = fferrs b the recent dreadful mutinies in lndia. The Mayor occupied the ohair. He intimated that he had received letters from the Dean of Durham, Mr. Mrowbray, M.P., Mr. Spearman, Mr. R. Burdon, and other gentlemen, expressing their sympathy with the object of the meeting, and regretting their inability to attend. He then called upon The Bishop of DURls to move the 6rst resolution. His Lordship commenced by tendering his thanks to the Mayor for his courtesy in having called the meeting together that day-the only day or which he had an opportunity of being present,-not because he presumed to think that any words of his could deepen the sympathy which he was persuaded every Christian heart felt for the object which had drawn them together but because if he had been compelled to be absent and unable to join with them in the efforts they were about to make to relieve the sufferings of their fellow-countrymen in the East he should have deemed it a great misfortune. The resolution was as folowsa:- * Resolved, that the meeting. while It recoglrze the hand of God in the rtcent fearful in8urreption in India, dereas lilkesse to express Its deepest etmDathy with our feUow-countrymen who haTe been its victiiss' The resolution divided itself into two heads. In the first place they were called upon to recognize the hand of God in this calamity. Doubtless the hand of God might be recognized in every event which occurred. His provndence guided aid governed all and directed all the affairs of men, and it was specially apparent in this instance. He grieved to be obliged to say, however, that he thought England in asl her dealings with her empire in India had not been true to the Christian principles and faith she professed. He did feel they had been over-indulgent in dealing wwith the hideous superstition wbich Dervaded that land. They had given as a Government their full confidence and support to the idolatrous religions of the country, while as a Government they had given no encouragement to the propagation of the Gospel of Christ, and it was with feelings of deep sorrow that he heard with his own ears in the liouse of Lords the charge brought against the present Governor-General of India, that he had given a contribution to a missionary society. That was imputed to him as a crime and as a grievous wrong to the religion of the country over which he was called to govern. Did it not seem that thiswua a retribution for their conduct towards that empire 5 If they had civilized, if they had christianized, those who had now turned round upon them with such barbarous ferocity, they would not have been exposed to those calamities which had befallen them. They were guilty as a nation for not having more boldly taught that religitn to others which they professed tbemselves. Earnestly did he hope that the result of the war inight lead to the adoption of a different policy by this country. They had met, no doubt, in that city on many previous occasions for similar purposes to that which they were now called upon to promote. There was a " Waterloo Fund" in 1815 ; there was also a "Patriotic Fund" at the commencement of the Crimean war. Those were urgent caUs on their sympathy and support, but those calls, he veiiured to say, sank into insignificance in comparison to that which now pressed on them. In the first in.tance, the number of British troops in India before many months elapsed would amount to 100,000, which was three times the amount of their countrymen who fought at Waterloo, and twice the number of those who fought in the Crimea, and for whose relief the munificent sum of a miUion and a-half was contributed by the people of England to the Patriotic Fund. (Applause.) But it was not merely the number of soldiers whose widows and orphans they had to look to. There were the military, their wives and families; the engineers, civil engineers, and clerks in the various departments. There were many who had sent their children over to this country to be educated, who were now unhappily orphans. There was another clasa of persons, the ratives who had remained faithful to their trust-who had, perhaps, been converted to Christianity, and who, by rer.'ning faithful, exposed themselves to considerable danger. Efforts inpara31eled in this country would be required to meet the exigencies of the case, and he only hoped that from that room there would Issue such an appeal as would be felt and reciprocated throughout the diocess. After alluding to the sufferings of our countrymen and countrywomen in the East, his Lordship remarked that he could not believe that the outbreak hrd proceeded fromn any tyranny on the part of the British Government. It had proceeded, in his opinion, from overindulgence, aud so far from the people of India being in a worse condition than they were before, they were infinitely improved, and they coald not have better proof of this than from the fact that the production of the soil had nearly doubled. (Applause.) In this effort to support the sufferers his Lordebip remarked he hoped both the clergy and laity would combine; the clergy, he earnestly hoped, would take the opportunity of the Day of Humiliation to make collections after their services. It would be a most fitting occasion, and he hoped they would spontaneously do so. If this wish of his were published abroad, as he had no doubt it would be, it might suggest to and induce those who might not think of it to make collections, which would considerably swell the amount they hoped to raise. (Applause.) In concludion, he did not think there was an individual present-a single brother, or a sister-who did not from his heart fee. compassion for those who had been overco-ne by this hideo,rs cruelty. In the suffering of their unhappy countrymen they had reason to thank God that they enjoyed the blessings of peacefvl homes: and he hoped that thIs ef7ort to relieve them would proceed from their hearts in the spirit of Him who said, " It is more blessed to give than to receive." The resolution was seconded by Alderman Bramwell, and carried unanimously. Nearly 1501. was subscribed in the room. DEVIZES, On Friday A meeting of the inhabitants of Devises and neighbourhood was held at the Town-hall, the mayor in the chair. The first resolution was moved by Mr. SOTEltON EsT. COURT, M.P. : ^' That thib meeting deeply sym rathizes with the helpless fteers by the late mutUnIes In India., many of whom, after endurng Insult 'nd outrae, and scarce escapIng with their llveA-after eeing the dearest objects of their affection murdered before their eyer, are now In a state of destitution, depending for aid and succour on the gcod feelings of tbeir Couotrymen' Mr. Esteourt said, there were two things absolutelv incumbent upon this country. The first was that she should put forth the utmost of her strength to crush the rebellion, and thus to put a 8top to those horrors which were threatening not only our country but civilization itself. The next thing was that they should call upon the Government to tell them distincly in what manner they intended in future to "overn India (Hear.) He perfectly agreed to the principIe that we should not interfere with the religious fcelings and pre. judices of those who by force of arms, by treaty, or by any other means, had been subjected to our zole (and who must be retained under that rule for their own sakes as well as ours); but he firmly believed the extension of (Ihristianity among the natives of that country was the only means by which we could hereafter hope to prevent A repetition of these calamities. Captain GLADSTONE, R.N., in seconding the resolution, said that though there might be grounds of apprehension that the state of India might become still more serious, yet their _ope was strong that the rebels would ultimately and soon be put down. They must be visited with the severest puuishment, for not to punish would be weakness; he feared it would even be necessary to exterminate many of those dewrons. (Cheers.) With regard to the future he had the fuolest confidence. He believed the Government would be stronger and firmer after the experience we had had, which had shown us that we must rule India with a hi h hand, and that we could not rely upon native troops for the maintenance of our interests and authority there. (Cheers.) Mr. S. WAiThON TAYLOR, bI.P., moved the next resolution : T That this meeting deslre io expre Iht horror of the cruelty treachery, and ubrusalty exercised by Sepoys and natives upon men, women, and children who vetsliving among them Ina confidence which has unhappily and most unexpectedly proved io be enairely mir placed;' This was seconded by the Rev. P. A. L. WOOD. It was proposed by Mr. GmIFFIP5TI, hLP., and seconded by the Iiev. W. KLNSLAND:- * That this meeting, In coowmon with the great body of our loyal countrymen, are resolved, at any sacrifice, to suppost Her Maieaty In every effort reuuiate to Insure a speedY and coDmlete restoration Of order, and to suppre5, with a high hand, those mutinous armed hodeie who have proved themselves so unworthy of bearing the name of soldiers uader uritich commaud," Mr. H. A. MEREwETnIR, in proposing tht e subscription be opened for the relief of the sufftere adverted to some observations of a preceding speakerin the causo of mercy. He said, while estimating fulIy those observations, he for one was for an active aggressive war of extermination, not merely in the exercise of a wild justice and revenge, but in order that those who had been guilty of those atroctie3 should be no longer allowed to disgrace humanity by living upon the face of the earth. (Immense cheering.) The Rev. Dr.WiL.sNsoN said, he trusted that no morbid sentimentalities would prevent justice from wielding her sword. He trusted that sword would be wvielded to the utmost extent in puniabing the guity, and that the Government and people of this country would ever be persuaded to advert to that principle which he believed to have been made for all times, that " whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed." (Loud cheers.) The Rev. AL W. MAyow said, he knew of nothing since the day when TisuCs crucified thousnds of' Jews that could stir their hearts like the events they were met to deplore. He believed they would defile the land rwith blood if they allowed the offenders to go unpunished. If they let these men espe they would be guilty as a nation both at home and abroad, and " verily their Ivee should go for the lives" of the innocent wvho had been slin Loud cheers.) The subsciptions made in the room atmounted to ne-sly 200l., ad a houto-house canvass is to be made, GOSPORT. A meeting of the Inhabitants of Gosport ws held on Friday for the purpose of afforing them an opportunity ef expressing their feelings of sympathy for the satsrlngs of our fellow-countrymen under the treachery and korrors of the Indian mutiny, and to take into consideration the bes means that can be adopted fDr asisting in their relief.

Mr. Dennys announced that a subscription had also been set ou foot in the Gosport military prison. TRURO. The Mayor of thiz borough, Mr. Edward Michell, convened a public meeting of the inhabitants last week at the Gtujldha ; the Mayor Preasded. Mr. TWEEDY moved a resolution, expressive of sympathy with the sufferers by the mutines mn India. He said it was horrible that the mutineers should not only have revolted against their benefactore, but have murdered their officers who had protected them and their wives and children also. He hoped, however, that when the day of retribution came our troops miglt be able to restrain their feelings. The Rev. W. W. H&svxy, rector of Truro, seconded the resolution, which was carried. Mr. P. P. Sanva moved the second resolution to the effect that a subscription should be opened for the town and neighbourhood. He expressed his belief that although England's sun had sunk dark and red below the horizon in India it was only to rise with more resplendent glory. (Cheers.) The Rev. R. VAUTIER, vicar of Renwyn, seconded the motion, which was also carried. A committee was then appointed to collect subscriptions. The Rev. W. J. MURRAY, ia moving the *hankg of the meeting to the Mayor, said, Mr. Tweedy had expressed a hopo that our soldiers might show forbearance; but the time of forbearance was not yet come-the present was the day of vengeance. He trusted that every death of our in. noeent sufferers would be as a martyrdom in God'ssight, and that He would strengthen our hands to sweep away that bloody religion which defiled our Indian Empire. The meeting then separated. HANLEY. On Thursday a. meeting was held in the Town-hall here, the Mayor presiding. Mr. ALLBUT moved,- " That this meeting dseIes to exptes ite sympathy with our feiUowcountrysmen in India under tbe usparaUeled sa-ifioce, the severe ttials, and distrealug privations to which they, and those dependent tron them have been subjected by the mutiny of the native troops in that conntry." The Rev. F. B. GRA.T seconded the motion, which was agreed to. Mr. GRANT said, that they had a large population in India in open revolt, and he quite agreed that they must do all they could to put it down, and then consider what could be done to preve-t such a state of things for the future. He would by no means advocate a maudling sentimentality as to dealing with the rebels hereafter. (Hear, hear.) He would not do it in a spirit of vengeance, but in that of ajust retribution. (Applause.) *lr. JAmxsx Di.)mocK moved a resolution in favour of appointing a committee for the purpose of canvassing the borough for subscriptions, and forwarding the same to the fund now raising in London. The Rev. J. W. C. DRAN-E seconded the resolution. He hailed with pleasure the present movement. As to the aUe. gation that the missionaries had brought on the mutiny he (Mr. Drane) emphatically denied it, and referred to the opinion expressea by The Times, and the testimony borne by Lord Panmure, when recently in Scotland, to a fact which had occurred in India in connexion therewith. WREXHAM. A numerously attended meeting has been held at the Ironball in this town on behalf of our distressed countrymen, Sir Watkinr W. Wynn in the chair. After an able address from the chairman a resolution expressive of the deepest sympathy was propoeed by Captain Panton, R.N., seconded by Captain Cotton. A second resolution, recommending vigorous measures being adopted by Government, was moved by Mr. Thomas Penson, of Oswvestry, seconded by Mr. Simon Yorke, of Erddig. The sum of 3471. was at once subscribed, the chairman heading thelist with 1001.

CIIARaR OF RXTOa?TIO2.Y On Saturday tbe further Investigation of the charpe pre. ferred by the Lord Mayor elect against Thomm P2atn Rose, of attempted extortion, was proceeded with befote the LonD MAYOR at the Mansion.homse There were on the bench Mr. Alderman Sa0omons, MIr. Alderman and Sheriff Law ence, Mr. Alderman Hale, hir. Deputy Dakin, Mr. Deputy Kabbel, Mr. 'Under-Slheriff Millard, Mr. Jorthan Thorp, Mr.. Pead, &c. Mr. Goodman, the chief clerk, bhaing read over the depositions taken tlthe previosa day, Mr. Thorp said,-Oh looking at the report of my evi- dence I am made to say that I did not communicate the; fact of the defendant's having told me that 1,5001. had been subscribed by the publinas to defeat Sir Robert Carden's election. I did commuicateo thi to Sir Robert, but not seriously. Mr. J. J. Millard was then sWom, and cross-examined as follows:- Mfr. Lewis.-When did yox dret have any conversation with Sir It. Carden with reference to his election? Mr. Millard.-In the middle of Agust last. Mr. Lewis.-Where? * Mr. Millard.-At his counting-hous, in Exchange-build. ings. Mr. Lewis.-Was any one present sava you ard him? Mr. Millard.-No, sir. Mr. Lewis.-Dld you go there of your own cecord, or were you sent for ? Mr. Millard.-I went by appointment. -Mr. Lewis.-By whose apoiutment ? Mr. Millard.-By Mr. Whitebead's S,ir B.obertM partner, upon whom I had previously called. Mr. Lewis.-N.Vow, when yoa saw Sir Robert upon that occasion, -just gently detail the conversation that took place betwveen you and him with reference to Rose. Mr. MiUard.-I wiU as nearly as I remember it. I communicated to Sir Robert the suostance ot a conversation that had taken piece between~ me and Mr. Anderton, the late nnder-sheriff, to the effect that he ws idetermined to oppose the election of Sir R. Carden. MSr. Lewis-What reply did Sir H, Carden maLse to that Mr. MiUard.-The reply was that he did not believe Mr. Anderton wpuld take any such stepa. The conversation' took place some time ago, and not having it particularly impressed upon my mind you will excuse me if I am not quite correct. I observed that my opinion was that he was determined to do so, and I suggosted to Sir R. Carden the propriety of making some arrangements if it should appear that he continued in the same mind. Sir It. Carden asked me what steps I referred to. I replied to his requesting several of his friends to form a committee to protect his intereats in case of need, and in case of a poll to secure the services of a competent agent. Sir Robert replied that he considered that to be altogether unnecessary, and that l, should not ask any of his friends to do so. He said, moreover, that if the high position which he had for so many ,vears snstained wvithout reproach in this dty would not of itself command the support of his fellow-citizens, he certainly should not ask them to vote for him. Then, I think, Sir R. Carden referred to the duties of the sheriffs, in regird to the preventing the admission of persons not entitled to vote into the halL Upon taking leave of me he said, "You understand that I do not intend to take any steps whatever; at the same time, if you shoultl hear any more on the subjectk you will do the best you can for me," or words as nearly as I can remember to that effect. Mr. Lewls.-That ended that interview! Mr. Millard.-That ended that interview. M Mr. Lewis.-When did the next interview taLe place ? Mr. Millard.-The next interview was on Friday, the 15th of September. I will not say that I had not seen Sir R.. Carden in the meantime, but wo had had no conversation. I met hlr. Alderman CabStt on my way to my office, and in consequence of what passed between us I went direct to my office, where Sir R. Carden was waiting to see me. Sir Robert said that he found opposition in Mr. Anderton. Mr. Lewis.-Was there any one present at that interview besides yourself and the Alderman ? Mr. Millard.-No, it was just at the entrance to the hallU It was in the street, in fact. He said he found that the opposition of Mr. Anderton was a determined one, and might render it necessary for Sir R. Carden himself to demand a poU. Mr. Humphreys.-This is what Slz Robert said? Mr. Millard.-Yes, this is what Sir Robert saidL EIe requested me to accompany h:m to Mr. Alderman Wire, in order to confer on the measures which it might be prudent to adopt under the circunmstances. I did so, ana, after waiting some time, we had an interview with Mr. Alderman Wire. Mir. Lewis.-Were any otber persons present save yourself, i Sir R. Carden, and Mr. Alderman Wire ai that interviewv! Mr. Millard.-No; after introducing the subject to Mr. Alderman Wire- Mr. Lewls.-Who introduced the subject, you or Sir R. Carden ? 3Ir. Millard.--I am not quite sure. He anticipated, prohably, what we had come about. It was merely a few words. The subject of Mr. Auderton's opposition was discussed, as also the propriety of taking measures to resist it. Mr. Lewis.-What was proposed to be done upon that occasion to resist the opposition? Mr. Millard.-On that occasion it was proposed that an agent should be employed. Mr. Le -By whom ? Mr. MUilard.-Ibelieve I mentioned the subject of an agent first. Mr. Goodman.-Of an agent being appointed? Mr. AMillard.-Yes; for the purpose of conducting the lpoll on the part of Sir B. Carden, upon which Sir PRobert observed that he should assuredly demand a poll, but that the expense of it would fall upon the sherifs ir. Alderman WN-ire explained to Sir R. Carden that that was not quite so, as the candidates would have to provide agen's to solicit and bring up the voters, and to check the votes. I then suggested that the more correct course, perhaps, would be that the deputies and common councilmen of Doowgate Ward and Walbrook Ward (thoae being the two wards of which those aldermen were the aldermen) should be requested to constitute themselves a committee for the purposes of this election. Mr. Lewis.-Wvhat followed afterwards? Mr. Millard. -ThAt was assented to. Mr. Lewis.-By both aldermen? Mr. Millard.-By both aldermen. Sir P. Carden asked me as a matter of favour to accompany him to his deputy, | Mr. Kebbel. Mr. Lewis.-Did you do so? Mr. Millard.-I did so, and Mr. Deputy Kebbel was in his counting-house, with his partner Mr. Sheppard. I think I that is his name. I then stated to Mr. Depaty Kebbel what had passed at the visit to Mr. Alderman Wire, and requeste fi Mr. Deputy Kebbel to put himself in communication with the deputy and comrmon councilmen of the ward of Walbrook for the above purpose. Sir R. Carden mesCe some observation which I do not at this moment exactly remem ber. I think he supported the statement I had msde with reference to the subject of the visit. Mlr. Lewis.-Had a comnittee been formed of the two wards before you had seen Rose? Mr. Millard.-Not to my knowledge. I think not. This was the first time, I believe, that thessuggestion had been made. I stated what had taken place at my interview with Itose, and I suggested his employment as agent, I Mr. Lewis.-Was that suggestion made by you to Sir R.. Carden ? Mr. Millard.-It was mentioned in Mr. Alderman Wire's presence, but I had no directions from Sir R. Carden to go I to Rose. I suggested the employment of Rose for the lesg-! tlmate purposes of the election. MKr. Deputy Kebbel, I think, said, "I think I understand the purposes for which he is to be employed, and it wiUl be necessary to have some agent." Sir R.. Garden observed that he was utterly averse to and would not sanction any of the proceedlngs usually taken at elections, and wa not disposed to hAve him employed at all. I sgain referred to the necessity of having an agent at the poll; that some one should be employed under the direction of the committee, and in the result it was left to Mr. Deputy KebbeL Sir Robert and I were about to leave, when Sir Robert said to Mtr. Deputy, Kebbel, "Noew, we must settle Mhllard's retaining fee, as he declines to act any further in the matter." My anser was, may desire to see Sir R. Carden Lord Mayor was my retainer, and that his success would be my reward. We then walktd up Allhallows-ane together. I'askedaSir l.. Cardeu whether he desired to be Lord Mayor. He said, he must be Lord Mayor, and the proper steps rnost be taken for it. As we approached Mr. Alderman Csrden's ofdice, ! Sir R. Carden took out his watch, and observed it was 12 o'clock. He remarked that his tine at the justice-rooin was half-past 11, and he people were waiting for him. Mtr. L"E5is.-Does this lead to any-thing material in. thecase ! MIr. Millard.-No, only Sir Itobert asked me to communicate the regret-to apologiae to Mr. Alderman WIre that he could not accompany sue to his (Mr.. Alderman Wire's) 1 office. Mr. Lewls.-Now, upon that did yoa.send fow Mr. Bcse, the defendant ? Mmr. Miflard.-I did direotly I reached home. Mr. Lewis.-Dld i!Mr. Rooe call on you at yow-office 2 Mr Millard.-He did in about W-an-hour afterwards Mr. Lewis.-State, when Mr. Rosa arrived whatsconma-i Lnieaion yon had with hirn with reference X the aject- j mnatter of his employment.

He said that he had received information npon which he oould rely that Mr. Alderman Wire d forfeited iis promise not to interfere in the elertion, &n, that he (Mr. Alderman Wire} and Ar. Anderton had combined to defeat the election of Sir 1, Carden. I told him that I did not believe that they had coombited; that I did not believe that the coombination had. Mr wis.ei We need nDt go io a long histery of thi& conversation Mr. Millard.-I *old Sir Robert that I had knwn Mir.

Sir Robert said, nevertheless, he was assured vrwas so, and his election was lost. 1Ho desired to know what were Rose's terms. 1 then stated to hii{n distinctly that Roee.s termsn were these-loo4 to cover all the exrnssa of the poll, and 50L more if Sir Robert was succem!ssi. Mr. Lewis.-The terms mentioned were the terms of the 18th ? la. MIard. -Yer0 and Sir Robcrtthen observed, "Then, that makes 1501." Sir Robert shortly afterx that said, "Well, I an going to takeproceedings against Rose with respect to some hbil publisto in uildhali-yard" Mt. Humphreys.-At the same int-rviewv ' Mr. Millaxd.-Oh, yeas; at the same interview, almost immediately after the 1501. vwas mentioned. Hla said he was going to take some proceedings a4ainst Roso with ro. spect to some bill that he had put up in Guildhall.yard. I said to Sir B. Carden, " I hope you wil consider well the course You are about to tLke, for you gave us your assorance, in my communications vwith you and Mr. Alderman Wire's communications-vith you, that it should remain in confidence and undisclosed. Nothing more passed. Mr. Lewis.-Do you know whether immediately after thatconversation the alderman attended hare andnmade an application for this summons 7 Mr. Millard.-I know nothing about it ti'l- I saw the report of the application in the newspapers. Mr. Humphreys.-You may take itfor the faot that that was so Mr. Le;is.-Yes; but I want it upon the notos. Mr. Humphteys.-Sir R. Carden will, tell you that when. you come to cross-exainine him. Mr. Lewis.-Ferhavs I don't want to cross-eaiamine him. Mr. Humphreys.-rhe summons shows it was- issued on. that day. Mr. Lewls.-Now, did you attend the Common-hall on Tuesday the 29th, the day of election ? Mr. Millard.-I did. Mr. Le wis.-Up to that day had the defendant been heard in defence of this complaint? Mr. Millard. -Certainly not. I recaived a, subpona for the hearinp. Mr. Lewis.-Now, did you hear Sir- Ld Carden upon. the austings dvert to this 06ecution of. the defendant' Mr. Msllard.-Yes I th[r-s; hn Icrail i bear him refer to it. ; ainly did Mr. Lewis.-The defendant is well known ae a city election agent, is he not? Mr. Millard.-Yes, he is universally employed in all. important contested city elections. Mr. Lewis.-He is a kind of city hfr. Coppoek. I believe every one flies to secare him if tbey can ? Mr. Millard.-They try to seeure him firs;. The LORD MAYOR.-It has been reported that all the aldermen have been in the habit of employing Mr. Rose. I bog to contradict that; I have not availeii nyself of his services. Mr. Millard.-When I say important elections, I mean for members of Parliament. Mr. Lewis.-Did you lead Mr. Rose to believe, when vou sent him to Mr. Deputy Rebbel's, that he was to> be engaged as the election agent of Sir 1. Cardenx? Mlr. hMillard.-I certainly did. I sent for him for that very purpose. Air. Lewis.-Novr, vras there any communication between you and Rose that whatever took place was to be deemed confidential ? Mr. MiLlard.-AIl communications were ta. be deemed confidential. Re-examined by Mr. Humphreys.-I have only one ques. tion to put to you. You say that Mr. Rose is wel known as a city election agent ? Mr. Millard. -Yes. Mr. Hum phreys.-How many times have you employed him aLs such ? Mr. Millard.-I employed him in theelection of Sir John Key. Mr. Humphreys.-I am not asking you wnhat elections; I baveno right to do that. bMr. Millard.-I have employed him twice. Mr. Humphreys.-How long is it since the last time? Mr. MilUard.-In lS51 I employed him. Mr. Humphreys.-Is that the last time ? Mr. Millard.-That is the last time. Mr. Lewis.-You have not the oonstant employment of agent for Lords Mayor ? MIr. Milard.-I never interfere at all in these things. What 1 did in this case was done out of friendship for Sir Robert. Mr. Humphreys.-It is only or the part of sheriffs that you have been in the habit of employing the defendant 9 Mr. Millard.-I individually declined to do more for Sir R. Carden than a private friend would do for him. Air. Humphreys.-But it Is only on the part of sheriffs that you have been in the habit of employing him, and not Lord layor ? Mr. Millard.-I employed him to assist at one sheriffs election and at one election for an aldermnan. The LoEDr ltA.o said he had an engagement to keep at the other end of the town with a member of the Government, and under these circumstances the farther hearing of the case must be adjourned till Monday (this day), at 12 o'clock. Adjourned accordingly.

FOREIGN JN7RBLLIGEN CA FRANCE. (FROM O1VR OWN CORBXSPONDENT. o -'n ArD3, FRIDAYr, Ocr. 2, 6 m.M Those ijournalists and amateur politicians who strain their ingenuity to discover or invent details of recent interviewvs between crowned heads, and who ventcure, on the strength of the rumours of foreign Chanceleries, or of words let slip by diplomatlits perhaps no better informed than themselves, confidently to state the topics discussed at Osborne snd Stuttgart, and that were to be discussed at Weimar, would save themselves trouble and better employ their time by taking a broader view of these meetings of Monarchs and of their probable general results to Europe. It is presumable that the great persons who have lately come together did not seek each other with the intention of creating, difficulties and of. parting worse friends than they met, but rather with the purpose of facilitating, by a friendly understanding *b settlement of certain difficulties bequeathed to a by the late war, and to the removal of which the Treaty of Paris cannot be said tohave done more than pave the way. It has been rather hastily supposed that these meetings would have the effect of counteracting each other, that the cordiality of Osborne would be chiled by the rendezvous of Stuttgart, and that Weiniar would go far to obliterate the memory of amicable intercourse inthe capital of Wurtemberg. This seems a very narrow view of the case. Whatever coolness may prevafl between certain Governments, nobody, I suppose, expects it to be eternal, or can give a valid reason why harmony should not be completely restored amongst the great family of the European Powers. The meetings that have as yet taken pLace appear to me to have occurred in a very natural order. Before repairing to an interview with a recent foe, the Emperor Napoleon went to visit a faithful ally. This might be taken as an assurance that new friends would not make him forget old ones; but the visit had also other objects, and indeed such an assurance was not necessary, for, notwithstanding the assertions of a few foreign papers, neither England nor its Government ever entertained mistrust or anxiety with respect to the long-talked-of Stuttgart meeting. Between Russia and France there had been for some time prcviouly a certain drawing together, a revival of gofeellng,not unfitly crowned by the meeting of their Sovereigns. And there is nothing ver surprising in the renewal of old amity between the Russian and Austrian Courts, although, partly on aec -unt of its sudden and unexpected announcement, it is the one that seems to have caused most wonder. Now that the Pas3ions engendered by war are stilled, public opinion modifies the judgment passed on the conduct of Austria. Her quarrel moreover, was with Nicholas, and the Emperor Alexander is certainly not bound, the contest that gave rise to it being over, to perpetuate his father's animosities, any more than-it is to be hoped-he proposes pursuing his policy. And, notwithstanding the diatribes of the Constitutionnel, which seems to act the part of a forlorn hope, desperately maintaining the fight which the general and main body are ready to consider at an end, it is the opinion of many that, now that reconciliation Is the order of the day, no very long time may pass before we witness a shaking of hands between Austria and France. Nothing of this kind that we have lately seen, or may shortly see, need be considered to portend changes in existing alliances, but simply an improved understandincg for high objects and the common good. Of the three interviews that have taken place, that of Osborne-although, from theprevioushabits of friendlyintercoursebetweenthe Sovereigns, it was the one that roused least curiosity and comment-should probably be set down as the most important, in so far as regards certain serious questions now pending. A strong opinion daily gains ground that at that meeting a satisfactory understanding was come to respecting the ultimate settlement of the Moldo-Wallachian question-a question the early solution of which, certainly very desirable, depends not, as some of the Paris papers have, with extraordinary haste and inaccuracy, asserted, on the composition and votes of the Danubian Divans, but on the deliberations and decision of the Paris Congress. It is by that Congress, when again assembled, that the future constitution of the Principalities wiU be decided. Divans and Commisioners are mere preliminaries, intended to clear the ground and elucidate the question. It is probably not until the next Conference at Paiis that the views of the Englsh and French Governments with regard to Moldavia and Wallachia will be known, but, when they are, it will perhaps be found that they fall far short of realizing the aspirations of the Unionists and of their suporters in France. A union of some kind there probably will be; but as to its e.xtent and nature wide differences of opinion prevail in the provinces thernselves, and so it wil be found when the Divans neet. Supposing these differences reconciled and the Divnsaree,tht villereyshw vhatis considered most for the advantage of Moldo-Wallachia by the Moldo-WaUacehians themselves. These, however, are not to be the sole judges, neither is the greatest good of their country the only question to be considered. The interests and future tranquillity of Europe are also involved, and these will, of course, be foremost in the consideration of the Paris Conference. What little news there is to-day relates to the recent interviews, which, in conjunction with Indian affairs, at present engross the public attention. From Weimar we learn that the meeting between the two Emperors was most cordial. they embraced each other warmly, and had a conversation of three hours' duration, at which the Empress of Russia, who did not once leave her husband, was the only person present. There is a rumour of a visit to be paid to Berlin by the Emperor Napoleon. It may be unfounded, but there are persons who think that such a project is really on the tapis. Young Murat, who was sent by the Emnperor with a letter to the King of Prussia, thanking him for his courtesy in sending the Prince of Prussia to meet him, was extremely well received, and the King told him that he should write to the Emperor of the French. With respect to the Stuttgart interview, I hear that Count Walewski has addressed a confidential circular to the French Ministers at foreign Courts. Such circulars being not unfrequent (one was sent, I believe, after Osborne), I mention it merely because my informant adds that the document, which defines the line of policy the French Government proposes pursuing in accordance with the great Powers of whose good will it is assured, confirms, by its tenour, all that has been said of the essentiaUy pacific tendency of the Stuttgart meeting. The EmDeror arrived in Paris yesterday evening, quite unexpectedly, coming from the Camp. Early this afternoon he drove along the Boulevards in an open carriage, accompanied by the Empress, on his 'way to the Eastern Railway Station. Two other carriages contained the officers and ladiea in attendance. There was no escort, and his passage seemed nearly unnoticed. He seems still in love with his Camp, and there is a talk of its being prolonged even beyond the 15th inst., should the weather remain fine. A company of actors from Paris is to give representationG there during the stay of the Empress To-night's Pays says that it has private inteill.- gence from Pondicherry of the 30th of August, up to -which date aU was quiet in the French East Indian settlements. On the 30th of August, says the same journal, the steam-transport Shanghai arrived at BomDay, coming from Hongkong, with 600 British soldiers on board. The Shanghai had sailed on the 23d of July, and announced the approaching arrival of two other transports, which were to leave early in August. There is a rather curious article in to-day's Dgbats, written apparently under a feeling of irritation, caused by the petty stlnging of a fraction of the Paris press, which has accused it of too great par- tiality to England, testified by the sympathy it has expressed with her cause in India. Without altogether denying that partiality, the Debats will not admit that it supports England right or wrong, and, to prove this, reproaches her with having neglected her moral mission in India, and inveighs rather strongly, but 'with no great novelty of argument, against Lord Palmerston. I subjoin the most important passages of the article, and trust that the Debats is guilty of exaggeration wben it says that the prevailing sentiment in Europe, and particularly in France, with respect to the position of the British in India, is one of curiosity not unmingled with satisfaction. France is the last country where such an enviou-a and unfriendly feeling ought to be entertained. Besides being our neareat neighbour, and to say nothing of the friendly and constant lnter course between the two countries, the French must be blind to their own interest if they rejoice at what impoverishes us and inflicts deep injury on commerce with the East. I belheve I shall be borne out In saying that when France has been vi8ited by misfortune, as in the calamitous days of 1848, no sentiment of exultation has been either manifested or cherished on the other side of the Channel; and, if the remark be true which I have once or twice heard made, that the generally friendly and sympathetic tone of the Paris press when speaking of the Indian struggle does not fairly reflect the feelings of the nation, I hope and believe that it does at least express the sentiments of all the more enlightened and educated classes of Frenchmen. With the prejudiced and ignorant it is in vain to reason. The DSbats says : " We are accused of being too fAvourable to Englis n- terests in our daily reflections on the affairs of India. We neither understand nor accept this reproach. Certainly we are not of those who, on hearing of the Bengal revolt, exclaimed, I England has just bad her first attak of apop1e.' We view the progress made by Engliah power in India and the extreme East without suspicion or envy. In our opinion, the cause of England in those distant lands Is the cause of olvillzation-the cause of the Indian insurrection is that of barbarim.6 Between then two Rags we cannot hesitate. It ix for that reason that we firmly desire the triumph of England over Its revolted subjects in Bengal. But the sentiment of esteem and sympathy which we cherish for England does not render us blind either to the gravity of the present crids or to the causes which have produced that crisis. We do not be. heve that the moment has arrlved to share the spolls of England. But why is this sentiment not universal in Europe? Why has ngland not encountered on the con. tinent the sympathy which naturaly attaches to the cause she sustins against the brutal atrocity of the barhariansI We are forced to admit that the sentiment which prevails in Europe, and particularly in France, with regard to the dfll culties of England is curiosity mingled with satisfaction. Open wishes are not expressed for the sucoess of the insur. rectlon in India, but many persons woul4 not be deeply afflicted by that resulL Nations of Europe have more thin once been plaoed in a position similar to that of England, and no such sentiment was cherished. In the height of the straggle sustained by Pranoe against the natives of Algeria we never behold our neighbours or rivals sympathize with Abd-el-Kader or the KAbyle chidtains. How are we to explain this pitiful anomaly, which affects our neighbours and alies? England, dnoe she has been mistrees of India, has forgotten to too great an extent the moral mission which she had to accomplish, and has ap peared more occupied in farming out In&da than In civilizing it. The public conscience has interpreted the Indian Inurrection as a just turn of fortune, as a punishment, or at leaat as a trial inflicted by Providence on British pride and ego. tism We mnst likewise take into deep consideration the animcsity created in France and the entire continent by the exclusive and passionate policy of Lord Palmerston. We do justice to the English nation; for 30 years It has thrown away the prejudices and hostile sontlments whic divided Prance and England at other periods. But, if these sentiments of hatred and miserable rivalry have ceased to aimate the British nation, they still exist in the Government which at this moment presides over Its destiiee, They have heen recetly displayed on several important occasions, espeoially in the question of the Prinoipalities and that of the Isthmus of Suez. It has boen thought, jutly or njustly, that the English Government had adopted as a fixed plan to oppose and hamper the most liberal measures and those most favourable to the general Interet of Europe. This policy of a former age, this puerile spite, of whioh Lord Painerston is considered the sys tematio and obstinate representative in the English Cabinet, has exercised, in France and elsewhere, an Influencoe which it is impossible to deny, and whioh we admit with the im. partiality of 'which we have often given proofs.' The following private telegraphic despatch has been received:- " TRIESTE, OcT. L "Acocunts from Constantinopleto the 26thult. announoa that Prince Callimaki wil probably quit the embassy at Vienna. The exohanges continued on the rise. There is a lose of 20 per cent. on paper money, and of 50 per cent. on the bonds of the civil list.

Letters from Athens, of the 24th nit., state that in consequence of the abundance of the crops, the export of corn has been authori:ed." The Mediterranean fleet, under the command of Admiral Tr6houart, composed of the ships of the line Br6tagne, Algesiras, Arcole, Austerlitz, Prince Jerome, Tourville, and Ulm, the steam frigate Iely, and the steam corvette Duchayla, anchored a Toulon roads on the 29th ult. The olives in the department of the Var, which were suffering from want of rain, have been relieved by abundant showers, which fell on the 30th ult. A plentiful crop is now expected. The vintage has finished in the southern departments under the most favourable conditions. The crop of figs is likewise most abundant.

PARIS, Ocr 3, The French Government has received despatchea from Ava, the capital of the Birman Empire, dated the 25th of July. Theyannounce that the Birman Government remains -a tranquil and even impassive spectator of the eveuts which are going forward in British India. The districts in Pegu last occupied by the British troops are garrisoned by merely a few Sepoys, and the towns of Rsangoon, Bassy, and the cantonment of Tage-Mvys, which were reduced to ashes the same day, are still a heap of ruins. A letter from Privas In the Ardeche, dated the 1st inst., announces that fresh inundations have destroyed all the works constructed since the inundation of September last to prevent a repetition of such a calamity. In the valley of the Ardeche all the proprietors of dweling-houses and mills situated near the river have been forced to abandon them, happy to escape with their lives, the water having risen three feet higher than during the last flood. Nothing can ho more miserable than the appearance of the country. The bed of the river for two leagues in length is filled 'with trees torn up by the roots, and the fields which escaped the last inunda- non are now covered with water. The passage of the railway trains between Narbonne and Beziers is again interrupted. Numerous changes are about to be made among the troops which comosoe the garrison of Paris. The 3d and 5th Reginients of Cuirassiers forming part of the division of cavalry of reserve at Versailles, under the command of General d'Allonville, are to exchange quarters with the 1st and 4th Cuirassiers, at present stationed at Lille and Valenciennes.

When, a few weeks ago, I was deploring the lamentable weakness of the Sultan, which had caused him, in spite of his judgment and wishes, to deprive himself of the wdwat counsullor he has hai since his accemion to the throne-Redschid Pasha, any one unacquainted with the state of men and things in Turkey might have imagined that I was led away by partisan feelings, and exaggerated the imrportance of this event to the welfare of the country. But, although a short time only has as yet elapsed. the succesors of Redachid have already given proofs of the spirit whEich animates them. Their firat act was of course to set aide and oppose all measures which the previous Ministry had favoulred, and In the general clearing out the unfortunate Euphrates Valley telegraph project, wrhich had passed the Tanzimat in Redschid's time, but had not yet received the approbation of Ministers and the aanction of the Sultan, was swept away with the rest So far it was all plain siling, but when it became necemary to devise mearures of their own to meet the urgent necessities of the present critical state of Turkey, their weak. nem and inability became manifest at owce. There are men In the Ministry, like Fuad and Mehemet Ruchdl, who by no mes lack intelligence and skill, and others, like Aah, who mean well and would do what is right; .but Aali has not the energy and decision which alone can give authority in a council and force the adhesion of all, and Fuad and Mehemet Ruchdi, with all their ability, have not that acknowledged superiority which would allow them tobecome ayowedly 'the leaders of the Ministy, so that their activity is at work behind the scenes to secure, in an underhana manner, an influence they dare not openly lay claim to, and to thwart any plan which does not originate with themselves. The GranudVizier, Mustaphaisha, a straightforward and honest old man, who, from his high office, should be the centre and soul of tha Cabinet, has lived all his life in Crete, where he was Governor, and, one might almost say, King. He knows nothing of the political habits of Constantinople, and finds himself quite at sea among the intrigues of all sorts by which he is surrounded. In such a state of things all progress is impossible, affairs are at a standstill, and very soon such complications will arise that the return of Redschid to power will be unavoidable. Whatever may be Redschid's. faults this much is certain, that he has that authority without which it is Impossible to govern. Whenever he is Minister, however small his offlice and whosoever be his colleagues, they all look up to him, his word is law, and his opinions are adopted in the councils almost without disusion. There can be no better pioof of hi1 talents and superiority than to see his rivals) who hate him most, bow down at once to his wrill At no time was a firm hand and a clear head more necemsry in the Government than at the present, By entering into the European system of credi and going on the market-places of Europe to contract loans, Turkey has taken the tacit engagement to maintain her credit, and invited a searching scrutiny of her financial system. The active pursuit of the war had left, notwithstanding two loans, some arrears to cover; but the deficit in the several chests of the administration was inwonsiderable, and with time, economy, and the promised development of the resources of the country, it was reasonable to expect that all arream would soon be paida. The debts of the Imperial Treaury were far more numerous, and every day new advances were required to meet the dally wanta of the Palazethere seemed no limit to Imperili magnificence. But even here the case was not hopeless: by a clear statement of the resources and liabilities of the Treasury, by putting some restrictions to further extravagance, and extending the guarantee of the State to the private debts of the Sultan, even the Imperial credit might have been restored. Confidence in the ability of Redachid, the prospect of a continuation of peace, and the probability that the establishment of a National Bank would be the means to introduce order into the transactions of Government and stop the fatal fluctuations in the exchanges, at once raised the credit of Turkey. The pound sterling, which during the war had reached the high price of ]48 piastree, fell to 115: the paper currency was almost at par. But every hope is not realized. Every successive attempt at establishing a bank fails. The Mini try of Redschid is swept awvay, all confidence disappears, but the wants of the Exchequer are every day more imperative. Hitherto the privy purse alone snffered discredit, but the Government itself is now in almost as bad a position. Creditors who had waited patiently, as long as there was a hope, have become clamorous and pressing. The War Department, which has hitherto met its obligations with tolerable regularity, has not a farthing in its chests. It will soon be unable to provide food for the soldiers. An indgnificant loan of 10,000,000 piastres, offered about Galata on what would have been most favourable terms a short time ago, finds no one to take it up; while the exchange, constantly rising, reaches 150 piastres per pound. To stave off the evil hour the Ministry has had recourse to a measure which may procure temporary relief, but will add permanently to the evila measure which, if often resorted to, would prove fatal-a new creation of Sehims, or paper money. 100,000,000 piastres was the sum decided upon, but 75,000,000 piastres only have as yet been issued. They will be employed topy off the most pressing claims on the military and naval departments. Even in the issue of these Sehims the Ministry seems to have lost sight of a principle usefully introduced by their predecessors, to lower as much as possible the rate of interest paid by the Government. When, in March last, Sehims bearing interest at 10 per cent. became due, they were paid off in Caim6s bearing interest at 6 per cent. only. The paper just created will bear interest at the rate of 8 per cent. The reason of this high rate is not obvious; 6 per cent. has lately been considered the legal interest, and the Caim6, which bears it, is sought after as a convenient investment. It will lose favour by this new issue. But the time for mere temporary measures is past, and the Turkish Government must at last make up its mind to adopt some extensive and definite plan of financial reform. The present time may appear unfavourable, as a great sacrifice would be necessary, but it would be wiser and cheaper to 'ace at once the difficulties of the position, and by a sacrifice overcome them, than to allow them to run on accumulating while a favourable opportunity is coming, until at last it may be no longer possible to avoid the disastrous crisis of a bankruptcy. Of al the companies wvhich have in. turn solicited the privilege of establishing a bank in Turkey, one remains, and is every day adding to its influence and power. Under the able direction of Mr. Falconet, the Ottoman Bank is already an important institution of public credit. Its capital, already large, can be increased the moment an extended sphere of action rencers this necessary. The sound and successful manner in which its business has been conducted in Constantinople and at its various branches has secured its reputation both in Tlurkey and in England. It seems to offer every guarantee both to the public and to the Government. Surely, such advantages cannot fail to be perceived and availed of by the advisers of the Sultan. The news has just arrived that the new Moldavian elections are terminated. They are favourable to the IJnionists, but such Is the insgnificance this question has now dwindled into that no one cares about the result. It is evident that the solution of the Danubian Principalities question is no longer at Bucharest or Jassy. AUSTRIA. (BOM OUR OW-H COnPPoXDxa.) VIET;A Sxrr. 30. Nothting more is here known of the mo.vements of the Emperor Francis Joseph than that he reachaed Dresden yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clo'c. The Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar has been Invited by the King of Saxony "to be present at the nI Muvres of the Saxon troops," and he the more w -. ly acoepted the invitation as it gives him an opportunity of paying his respects to the Emperor and of accompanying him on his journey toWeimir. This delicate attention on the part. of hip Serene Highness wlll be a great relief to the minds of sern3 of the Austrian dignitaries, who vrer of opi ion that the descendant of more than 9t' na Emperors offended against etiquelte wA an invitation from a German Sovereign who had never been at his Court. No one here has the st ightest idea of what will take place between the t wo Emperors at Weimar, but there is an impression on my mind that their Interview will be attended with moat important, though perhaps not immediate, results. It is whispered that Prince Gortachakoff Is to have the Grand Cross of St. Stephen, which is the highest order the Emperor of Austria can give to a person who is not a Roman Catholic. The Emperor Alexander goes to Berlin after his interview with the Emperor Francis Joseph, but he will hardly remaia I n that city more than 48 hours, as he pur- poses beinginWarsaw on :the 6th of October. The Neue Miinchezner Zeitung, which is the semi-official organ of the Bavarian Goverament, contains an article on the meeting of the Emperors Alexander and Napoleon which 'meritf your attention. The Munich paper says:- " We hope that the two lonarchs ill take into con. a deration the interests of their subjects, and exchange only -words of peace. Peace, however, can only ba maintained as ong as the rights of nations are respected. We hope and rnst, therefore, that those international rights which are guanteed by the most sared teties wi be ted by the two Emperors. The days of Tilsit and t gone by, for the German race now knows what is I -t politicl mision. Germany respects the rights of other nations, but she is jealous of her own, and will defend them w*th energy should they be attacked either from the west or fom the east. For foreign countries Germany is one in.4ivisible whole, and no German Sovereign could venture to bid defiance to publio opinion by refsing to assist in main*lnlng her dignity and integr.ity. Geman honour and lght have their most wrorthy champions in the Emperor of stria aDd King of Prussia, and there is no German statesnm who wrould not willingly do battle In defence of the honour and rights of the fatherland."a By the foregoing it is to be seen that Bavaria fears for her Rhenish provinoes, but it is not likely that she has any good reason for her apprehensions The interviqw between the Emperors of Russia and Austria at Weimar neutraliz the effect of that between the Emperors Napoleon and Alexander at Stuttgart; and the more immediate result of the meeting of the MIonarchs wlill probably be a reduotion~ of their armies. In fact, the assurance has been given me that a very great!relduction is about to be made in all arms of the Austrian army. According to advices from Bucharest the elections for the Divan ad hoc began in the city on Saturday, the 26th inst. It is well known here that there will be a large majority in favour of the union in the Wallachian Divan ad hoc, but men in office seem to attach inlinitely less Importance to the result of the elections than they did a few weeks ago. The Commissioners are gone to Jassy, but they will be in Buchareat again at the end of this week. Some interesting information rTespecting Russia has been communicated to me by a person who is perfectly well acquainted with the actual state of things. As the foreign public will contribute nothing towards the construction of the Ruasian railroads, the Government has had recourse to the followIng means of raising the necesary funds at home :-Formerly 4 per cent. was paid on all sums deposited in the "Reichs Credit Banken," institutions which in Russa are equivalent to the saving banks in other countries; but In future only 3 per cent. will be paid on the new deposits. It is expected that the consequence or this measure will be that the public will buy railroad shares, bearing 5 per cent. interest, instead of depositing its spare capital in the " Reichs Credit Banken.' My correspondent, who avers that the treasuries of the convents are as empty as those of the State, is of opinion that many years must elapoe before Runia can recover from the effects of the late war. Both In St. Petersburg and in Moscow people complain bitterly of the prodigality of the Imperial family and whisper to each other that the Dowager Evpre has spent about 3,000,OOO. since the death of theEmperorNicholas. His Majesty is by no means popular with the Muscovite party, which accuses him of an undue partiality for his German subjects. On Friday, the 2d of October, the Empress will leave for Tschl, and meet His Majesty at Gmunden, a small town on the beautiful sheet of water of the same name. The Count and Countess Trapani are gone to Dresden and Berlin. A person who is perfectly well informed on French and Austrian financial matters yesterday explained to me how it happened that the French funds rose so suddenly a few days ago. An eminenrt financier received a summons to go to the camp at Chilons, and on his arrival there he received the positive asaiance that a great reduction was about to be made in the army. The financier lost no time in getting back to Paris, where, to use the expression of my Informant, he bought up everything that came in his way. He went a second time to ChAlons, but he made no coup of imuportance on his return to the French capitaL Several respectable travellers have requested me to call the attention of the British public to the fact that the Lombardo-Venetian Railroads are miserably managed. The trunks of the travellers have frequently been opened in the baggage-cars and things of value abstracted from them, and the waiters at the stations are as dishonest as the porters If a large coin is given to a waiter, he rarely has any small money about him, and purposely dawdles about until the bell rings, and the traveller is obliged to depart. Terrible complaints are also made here of the exorbitant charges of the Vienna hotelkeepers, and the Oesteireichische Zeitun9 states that in a well-known inn two foreigners had to pay sLx florins (12s.) for two cold fowls and two cups of tea. The usual charge in the hotels for the half-starved thing here called a IIfowl". is one flori. In another hotel two passengers who remained but ix days in Vienna were charged 24fl. (21. 2s.) for candles. The railroad from Treviglio and Bergamo to Venice wiU be opened on the 12th of October. During the last few days of the month of August 911b. of gold was found at Veree-patakAboudbanya, in Transylvania. The Austrian Government has made a contract with Mr. Brett, who is to construct a submarine telegraph from Ragusa, by way of Corfu, Zante, and Candia, to Alexandria. It is rumoured here that His Holiness the Pope has accepted the resignation of Cardinal Antonelli, but the news is too good to be believed. THE KINGDOM OF THE TWO SICILIES. (FROU OUR OWN CORRESPONDRNT.) NAPLES, SEPT. 28. Much has been said here of visits paid by Prince Satriano (General Filangieri) to the Royal Palace, and many have inferred from it the probability of a change in the policy of His Majesty, as it is well known that Satriano would not take office without receiving carte blanche to remodel affairs My impression is that the King eontemplates no change, that he is perfectly contented with the status quo, and that he cherishes the proverbial odium of one who has been benefited towards his benefactor. Satriano will not be ealled to power, and his visits, or more probably his visit, was nothing more than one of respect on his return from Vienna. All kinds of produce still keep up their prices, and the ports continue to be closed, notwithstanding the overflowing abundance of the harvests. With respect to grain I believe the price is kept up in a great measure by speculators, who are making extensive purchases for sale on the spot, and, as the Government will not open the ports unless it can add to its revenue by imposing a small duty, the probability of such a step seems to be as far off ax ever at present. Grain is 18 carlini and upwards the tomolo, whereas until it falls to 17 carlinl there is no chance of any permission to export. It is easy to perceive that the principles of political economy are little understood in this country. Our vintage is progressing favourably under the circumstances. It is a great change for the better that any wine wll be made, for now for upwards of five years there has been almost an entire failure. The quantity is small, though the quality is good, and, if we cannot say that the disease has disappeared, at least it may be said that in sulphur a perfect remedy has been discovered. The oil harvest, too, promises to be most abundant. The official journal speaks of great damage inflicted on life and property in the provnces of Terra di Lavoro, MoUse, Bari, and other parts of the kingdom. The rain feU in a deluge, while the hailstones were as large as walnuts. The torrents were so swollen In some directions that they swept away bridges, mills, a church, dwelling-hose3, and in one commune created a breach right through the centre of it. Upwards of 60 persons lost their lives. A letter from Florence of the 29th ult. announces that the reigning Grand Duchess is serioulgy indisposed with fever. SPAIN. The Madrid journals of the 28th ult. have oome to hand. The editor of the Discusion has been tried by the Special Tribunal on the Press for having publied a 8editious Article, but he had been acquitted. A telegraphic dexpatch received from Rome announced to the Government that the Arobbishop of Burgos and some other bishops had been preconised in a Consaltory held by the Pope, as was announced some short time back. A Royal decree enacts that an Academy of Moral and Political Sciences shall be e-stablished. A letter says " aumours of a Ministerial crisis continue, and the ad. versaries of the Cabinet allege thxt it cannot lst to the 30th of October, the day fixed for the meeting of the Corteg. It ix believed that the Ministers intend to submit to the Queen a series of measures which they consider indispensable, and that if Her Majesty should not approve them they wil Iesign. It is also believed that in the council which will be held on Friday next some important questions will be discussed. It is sid that the Ministry is resolved that General Lahei-, Count de Balmaseds, shlU replace the Marquis de Viluma as President of the Senate. He, it may be remembered, was one of the Generals spoken of for the Captaincy-General of Cuba." The Madrid Gazette of the 29th ult. publishes the text of the convention signed on the 7th of July last between the Queen of Great Britain and the Queen of Spain on the subject of literary property.

IRELAND. THE BELFAST GOVERMEINT u'OUMY. (FROM OUR OWN COBBESPl w nrwr- DIUBIN. SATURDAV MV hrn' Lne uomnmisioners have at length concluded their tedious labours, and, to judge by the tone of the local journals, 'heir task appears to be a thankles one. The Belfast Mercury insists that the investigation hadlost altogether any practical charcter it first possessed, and that the public time was frittered away in hearing the most frivolous evldence*. "Witnesses, in giving their evidence, were subjected to grossinsultU; gentlernenof hlghpersonalwortlbandlhonounble charcter were exposed to the mogt wanton attacks, and the whole proceedings were conducted without decoruLM or regularity of any kind. When, therefore, the Court denerated iWno a bear-garden, and rffarsn ms a oll full swing, thhe termintion of the inquiry can only be regarded The Nortlsern Whig-mnore bitter in its hostility to Orangeism that the Roman Catholic Ul4erman. -demasn dn from the Government some such stringent measure as will place the Orange confederacy in the same category as the Riband conspiracy. Adopting this extreme view as a text for a lengthened comment upon the declineand fall of the capital of Ulster, the Whig sums up in these terms:- The fall of Belfast from ibt high estate of peace, industry goodwill, and common sense, into the slough of sectarian o and ruffianly anarchy mnay p bly awaken our somnolent tulers to the necesity of ta =ng effective steps to curb the spirit of ascendancy which manifestly atill pervades the Tory strata in this oonntry, and which could never break out in the blackguards of Sandy-row or of Pound-street if it were not known to be cheriahed by hundreds in the hal and castle who wite D.L. or JT. after their names. There is absolutely no use in the Government sending a pair of learned pundits to pry into the mysteries of Ballycarrett, if itYi not prepared rligdly to revise the magistracy, erase the nAme of every individual that has any connexion with an Orange lodge, and for the future decline to confer such privileges on any gentleman who does not give a solemn pledge never to belong to, act with, or patronize any such society. Englishmen can now understand, if they did not previously, that Orangeism was only Iscotched not killed by former proceedings of the Legilature. It is now plan that we have no chanoce f e in Ireland on any condition shortof Orangeism being paced in the same category as Ribandusmi." T IDUN SUFFMVIM The subjoined letter has been addressed by the Lord Bishop of Meath to all the clergy of his dioces. It was written before the day of humiliation was agreed Upon- "Ardbraccan, September, 1857. 11Rev. and dear Sir,-The melancholy eventa which are daUy brought to our notice exhibit in gloomy colours the state of destitution in which the hapless sursviors of Mahomedan and Eindoo atroeities are involved, and claim not only our deepest sympathy and our ardent prayers, but our Immediate and ready help. Without this sympathy Is but a traent emotion, and prayer itself but a solemn mockeary. " Influenoed by this feeling, whib, I doubt not finds an echo in your heart, and anx[ous to give our contributions a diocesan charcSer, it is my earnest desire that you wiU bring before your congreption on some early Sunday (say the 11th of October) the distresses and wants of our unfortunate oountrymen and countrywomen in India. " I would recommend also that to such of your cong tion as may not be present on this occadon you should rsnke a special application, and that you would tranmit the names of sucn as contribute and the proceeds of the coUection to me, or lodge them in my n me in theBankof Navan, with as little delay as posible, that the amount of our diocesan collection may be remitted in one sum to the London committee. " Need I say that meetings for special prayer have my warmest approval, and that I would beseech youin your pri vate and family devotions to remember at the throne of Divine Grace those who, far from us and our happy homes, may be enduring all the horrors or distrese that a barba- rous and implacable foe can inflict?

MATH," In marked contrast to the tone of the foregoing circular let the reader peruse what follows from one of the most eminent prelates of the rival church. In the course of a letter addressed to one of his vicar-generals (Dr. Yore), and dated Rome, Sept. 25, Archbishop Cullen writes,- " It has given me much pleasure to learn that a movement is to be made for the relief of our fellow-countrymen who have been reduced to misery by the dreadful and wide-spread revolution now ragin in India, and menacing the safety of the British emplre. hose poor sufferers are worthy of our deepest sympat y, and it is to be hoped that the efforts made to relieve them will be attended with success Hlowever, before wo take any step in the matter, or call on our flocks to do so, perhaps it would be well to inquire how the fund about to be raised is to be managed, and whether there is any danger that it may be applied by bigots In proselytizing purposes Therecollectionof late transactions excites doubts inmy mind on this head. In the year 1854 you subscribed to the Patriotic Fund, and you were kind enough to hand in my contribution for the same object. I thik, also, that on the same occasion the Catholics of Dublin subscribed very generously according to their means. Now, how was that fund manaed? You recollect, and Canon Grimley recollects, that Catholic clergymen of Dublin applied to the man rs of the fund in favour of the widows and orphans of soldlers killed in the Crimea; yet, as far as I could learn not one shilling was then obtained by suah application. When relief was granted in Dublin a pason was always employed to administer it; and I have heard that he generally selected a Protestant church or vestry as the place of doling it out, thus compelling poor Catholic widows to under6o the mortification of visiting a house of worship which it is against their feelings and consciences ever to enter, and perhaps of waiting for him there before they could see the agent from hom they were to receive asdstance. "You will also recollect that the good Sisters of Mercy, and of St. Clare, and other rel ous communities offered their services to the managers of the PAtriotic Fund, for the education, at a very trifling expense, of the female orphans of the Catholic soldiers. Answers were sent to their proposals, but I believe there was not one single orphan committed to theircare in Dublin, and I suppose tho same may be said of the rest of Ireland. Nor Is it to be imagined that the proposals of the good Sisters were rejected for want of funds, Oh ! no. There was an abundance of money inthe hands of the committee - but, in the impartial exercise of their powers, they thougbt St to apply it to the ereotion or endowment of Protestant institutions. The Times of the 9th of June, 1856 (if I wel recollect), informs us that the committee assigned 140,0001, or 5,000. per annum, for the education of 300 daughters of sailors and soldiers, together with 20,0001. for a house and grounds. As nearly one-half of the army consists of Catholics, very probably one-half of the orphans to be received In the projected house will be of the same religlon. Now, let me Ask, how many Catholics wiCl be e yed In superintending the education of these Catholiochildren ? Most probably there will not be even one; and, under such circumstanoes, what chance will the poor ohildren have of retaining the religion of their fathers ? " Besides the grant of 160,0001. just mentioned, TiZe Times of the same date informs us that an endowment of 25,0001. was granted to the Wellington College; 3,0001. to the Cambridge Asylum for Widows; 8,000C to the Naval School at New-cross; 6,0001. to the Female School at Richmond; and 6,0001. to the Naval and Mtiliary Schools at Plymouth and Portsmouth. These seem to be all grants to Protestant institutions and for Protestant education. Not a shilling voted, It would appear, to give a Catholio education to Catholic orphans? Is this justice ? Would it not have been a source of bitter affliction to the Irish Catholic soldier dying on the shores of the Black Sea had he known that his children would be exposed to be robbed of that faith which he valued more than life? And must not such a system excite feeling-anf indignation in the bosomsof those Catholic soldiers who are now sent to shed their blood for England on the burning plains of India? Surely it is but natural to suppose that they would feel more zlous for the cause in which they are engaged, and more ready to expose their lives to danger, were they assured that the religion of their children would be respected, and those tender objects of their affection brought up in the faith of their fathers. " But to return to our original subject. I am most anxious that everything nossible should be done to relieve the sufferers in India; 1et us, however, have some eourity that the funds collected will not be apphed to the founration of Protestant asylums for the perversion of pecr Catholic orphans. The management of the Patriotie und shows how necessarv it is for us to be cautious. T)* continual complalnts of Catholic bishops and misdouares in India about the attempts made by the EBst India Coni ny to proselyti7e shoul 1 increase our alam Read Dr; ennel's9 late pamphlet, and won vill see to what an extent that company has aeteemnpt- to promote ProtesSantsmi by pernerting the orphans of Irish Catholic soldiers. it appers to me that the proper tfme for coming to a fair understanding about thee matters is before any fund is collected. " PAUL CULLEN." Why does not Dr. Cullen honestly and above board caution the flock committed to hiA care against ubscribing towrds the Indian fund? Sucha course would be more intelligible than dealing in innuendoes and creating doubts as to the objects to which the money mtay be ultimately applied. THE EXODUS. Intypeg of large proportions the Limerick Reporter announces that the "' people are flying out of the country in myriads." Yesterday morning " the scene at the junction was melancholy in the extreme. Nothing could posibly be more so." A gentleman tells the alarmed journal that "in the neighbourhood of Cashel it is almost imposible to procure labourers, and that grass-farms will be the order of the day, should the people continue to fly off. Prosperous timnes and high prices are not keeping them at home."

BOYAL POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTION. A series of important novelties- introduced into the programme for the present week Were privately exhibited on Saturday evening. They was of the most varied description, comprising a new sort of penholder, an improved method of making bread, a system of railway signals, and some dissolving views illtustrative of the rebellion in India. The penbolder, which is Mr Osmont's patent, contains Ink enough to wnte 100 letters, the pen being supplied by twisting the knob at the other extremity of the machine. so that the process of dipping is abolished for ever. The railway signals, which are the invention of Mr. Myers, are shown on a smaitly-constructed little carriage, and the comple display of suddenly-manifested targets, the dcng of bells, the shriek of whistles, and the clack of rattles produce a most imposing effect. The guard ond engine-driver com. municate with each other on an improved method, passen. gers have the means of communicatiDg with the guard, and it may be safely asserted that if the proposed invention does not lessen the number of accideuts it affords every facility for making admonitory noises Less attractive to the eye than the railway carriage, with itsgay banners of alarm, but appealing even more directly to universal sympathies, is Mr. Stevens's bread machine, which kneads the dough and turns it ouS into tis prepared for the purpose, thw,to use the eloquent words of the demonstrator, preventing "~the hand from coming into contact with the staff of life," The series of dissolving views painted onI glass by Messrs. Hine, Clare, Knott, Perring, and Fey, exceedingly beautiful and effective, comprising not only the sites of the rebellion but some of the most important ob jects illustrative of Indian architecture and mythology Thus the laichaelmas season of the Polytechnic sets in w t a good variety of amusement and lnstruction.
CREMOSHNRGARDENS. On Saturday the sum of 3001. was paid into the hands of the Lord Mayor by Mr. Simpson, the proprietor of Cremorne. This sum represented the proceeds of an extra entertainment given on Monday last (after the terminationi of the season) for the benefit of the sufferers from the mutinies in India. AUl the persons engaged on the est"blihmnent performed gratuitously on that oocasion, and had it not been for the unfavotrable state of the weather the sum raised would doubtless have been much larger. A. sympathy writh the great objeots of pnblio interest has generally been visible at Cremorne, as wvas honourably testified in the case of the Wellington College, to wrhich 1,2004*, tho result of benefit performances, was contrihnted by Mr. Simpson.
TEBE COURT 12 THB HIGEHIASs.-The Court has enjoyed a month of the most healthful and bracing weather this year which hbs ever been experienced in the lighlandi of Scotland. The Queen has made excursions to the tops of the principal nountains within 10 nmiles of the castle, and taken sketches of the surrounding scenery. The Prinoc Consort has been mostly engaged in the Deer-foregt and haa killed a number of fine stags, but his sport has not been se good as that of last season. PreLching before the Queen hus become quite a feat, the more popular clergymen having had their sermons noticed by the Court In one case, that of Mr. Caird, of Errol, whose sermon preached before the Court two years ago was published, tho rev. gentleman hba received an autograph letter from the Queen commanding him to publish this year's sermon also. Another clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Stewart, has had Her MaIjesty'sthankasent to him by Colonel Phipps, while a third, the Re-.

AMERICA. LIVERPOOL, SA IURDAY. The British and North American Itoyal Mail steamship Europa, Leitch commwander, has arrived with advices from Boston to the 22dI ult., and New York by telegraph ria Hallifax to the 24th ult. p.m. She brought 55 passengers, but no specie. Oa the 24th ult. the Europa passed the R )yal Mail steamer Canada, hence, for Halifax and Boseton ; on the 26th, in lat. 46 N., long. 55.31 W., passed the brig Camerton, steering west; and on the 2d inst., in lat. 51.12 N., long. 12 XV., signalized the Judith, of Stonehaven, stanrding Bouth. The screw steamship Glasgow, from Glasgow, arrived at New York oil the 21st ult. On the 16th ult., in lat. 43.3, long 56.30 she experienced a severe storm, the wind suddenly chopped from W. to a territic squall from E. toi N. WV., carryiog away every stitch of square canvas, and fore and maintopgallantmastyards, mainyard, and started mainmast. The screw steamship City of Baltimore, hence, and the Indian, from Southampton, had arrived at New York. Tho erection of the sternpost of the Russian frigate General-Admiral, building at New York, was inaugurated by a dinner given at the hotel of the Russian Minister. Thity-seven persons had been poisoned in Alabama with arsenic mixed in their food by a negro cook, at the instigation, it is alleged, of a aungarian. Six of the number had already died. The cook was burnt, and his accomplice was to share the same fate. A despatch from Washington to a Boston papar states:- " Senator Slidel has received a letter from Senator Benjamin, dated City of Mexico, 4th inst., annoUnoing that he and his colleague had succeeded in making satisfactory arzangements with the Mexican Government relative to the Tehnantepec transit roate, and that President Comonfort acted in this matter against the earnest protest of our Minister, Mr. Forsyth." From Havannah we learn that business was dull. The stock of sugar was about 20), 000 boxes; holders refused to seU at the reduced prices. There was little doing in exchange. On London, 10t to 11. Freight dull. The slave trade was reported to be very active. The yellow fevor was still prevalent. Advices from Washington report that official instructions had been issued from the State Department to arrest all hostile expeditions leaving the Utnited States for any other country. In the New York market on the 2tst there was a further decline in stocks, and the latest quotations were as follow :-Virginia Sixes, 86f; Missouri Sixes, 690; New York Central Shares, 66 ; New York and Erie Shares, 16 g; Reading R. R. Shares, 41. ; Michigan Central Shares, 56i ; Cleveland and Toledo Shares, 33i; Panama R. R. Shares, 81; Illinois Central Shares, 88; Illinois Central Bonds, 82; Chicago and R. I. Shares, 65; Milwaukie and Mis., 35; Galena and Chicago, 68i; La Crosse, 12; Cleveland and Pittaburg, 16. The banks were becoming stronger every day by aid of remittances from the interior. Respecting failures the Newo York Courier and BEqnptirer says:- *" The only suspension announced here to-day was that of Messrs. C. W. Field and Co., a firm of well-known wealth, whose suspension will probably be only temporary. The notes of the Yates County Bank of Penn Yan were to-day rejected by the Albany Agency, but will probably be reinstated in a few days." There was some excitement caused by reports of further financial difficulties at Boston and Philadelphia, but there was less trouble among the merchants. Capital continued in active demand, however, at very fuU rates of interest, and the 21st was one of the most stringent days experienced since the commencement of the pressure. To the list of the failures given above the New YorkJournwal of Commerce adds:- "Messrs. Cyrus W. Field and Co., of this citv, paperdealers, have saspended until the return of the head of the house, who is Row on his way home from England, and is expeoted to arrive (at the latest) in the Arabia next week. The other failures of the day here are not of sufficient public interest to be noticed. The failures reported from Philadelphia by telegraph are Messrs. John Faruham and Co.; Eacker, Le&, and Co.; and Thomas P. Remiington, highly respectable houses engaged in the domestic dry goods commission businems; and messs Deal, Milllgan, and Burt, dry goods jobberso We learn that the Huguenot Bank, of New Platz, New York, which was previously reported suspended, resumed business again on the 16th. The extensive machine shop and locomotive works of William Mason and Co., at Taunton, Masse chusette, have stopped, and all the hands employed, about 550 in number, have been discharged, on account of the pecuniary embarrassment connected with the failure of James K. Mills, of Boston, who is the largest ownor in these establishments. The Whittenton Mills (also in Taunton), a large cotton manufacturing establishmnent, of which Willard Lovering is agent, and James 1K. Mills a large owner, has also stopped running for the same reason, and the cmploy6s discharged." Exchange on London, 105i to 106i. The cotton-market was dull, and prices nominal. The stock was reduced from first hauds to about 500 bales, " which is held," Bays the C0orier andl Enpzirer, " Waiting some favourable change in the money-market, which will enable shippers to negotiate, or spinners to obtain cash funds. Quotations, In the absence of demand, must be considered altogether nominal, and the small daily transactions are at very irregular rates. Middling Uplands, in smtall quantities, command 15-c., and New Orleans 15ic. to 15-7c. The accounts of the growing crop have been less favourable during the past week from the Atlantic States, complaints reaching us of shedding of fruit, rulst, &o., and In some localities in Alabama the boll worm is said to have done injury. The great complaint, hovwever, is the lateness of the crop, and its consequent exposuro to injury from storm or early frost." Breadstiifs had taken a turn in favour of the seller, owing to the foreign advices. Wheat was excited and irregular. Pork, beef, and bacon had declined in prices. Lard more firm. Butter higher. Scotch pig iron was quiet. There was a better feeling for spirits of turpentino and common rosin. Sugar quiet. Freights to Liverpool were firmer, with more activity. On the 22d, as reported by telegraph to Boston, stocks were dull ; the sales at the first board were small and the decline in prices general. At the second board there was a better feeling, with more activity and a slight advance in some stocks. Illinois Central Bonds, 83 ; Erie Railroad, 7I Baarlem, 8; Cleveland and Pittsburg, 144; Cleveland and Toledo, 34- ; Chicago and Rock Island, 62- -. New York Central, 66t ; Reading, 42i ; Illinois Central, 85. Money was most stringent and rates of discount higher ; some endorsed paper so'd for 21 to 24, and unondorsed up to as high as ;to per cent. Advices from Boston and Philadelphia stil had a depressing effect on the market. The suspension of the Central Bank and the Bank of the Capitol at Indianopolis was announced. Exchange on London, I 014e to 107 for produce-bills. Cotton was dull ; flour easier ; wheat lower, but irregular; corn lower and dull. More inquiry for sugar ; iron dull; rice dull; tobacco firm ; freights to Liverpool dull. At New Orleans on the 22d cotton was slightly dearer. LATEST BY TELEGRAPH, eich HALIFAX. NEW Y(RK, SEPT. 24, BvEv,NcG. The European advices by the steamship Canada, arrived at Halifax, were published in our journals this morning, and exercised no perceptible effect uipon the markets. Cotton has been quiet at about the rates current on Tuesday. WVheat is firm, and has an advancing tendency. Flour and Indian corn are steady at former rates. The money-market has improved, and a considerable advance has taken place in all kinds of securities. The steamship Ariel, from Southlampton, arrived here on the 23d. NEW ORLEANS, SEPT. 23, Evrxixc. Our cotton-market has been active to-day, the sales footing up 8,000 bales. Quotations are quite frm.
TIrB AMIERicAMS FRITATE PINYMOUT}l.-On Satarday afternoon Capatain Dahlgren and the officers of this frigate, which has been lying in the Southampton Water for the last two or three weeks, were entertained at a sumptuous banquet, given to them by Mr. Alderman An. drews at his Winchester residence. Mr. William Thompson (the United Statese Consl), the Mayor of Southampton (Mr. J. White), and other friends from that town were also among the company. The usual loyal toasts, together with those of an international character appropriate to the occasion, w'ere drunk, and the American officars seemed muoh pleased with the friendly treatment they had experienced. lo fdrigate has since saied on her return to Washington. STEAMf To NEW YORB-The steamship Vanderbilt, Captain Edward Higgins, sailed from Elavre and Cowee on Saturday, for New York, ful of passengers and cargo.

THE INDIAN MUTIiNIES. ACP.- --- -- --Rp The following letter is from a lady at Agra:- " Fort Agra, August 12. "Here we are stil quite wel, thank God, but sadly tired of being cooped up in the fort, and the worst of the matter Is that we do not know when we shall be able to get out. Not that there is any enemy near to be afraid of, but there are no houses left to live in. In consequence of all the fighting men being in the fort the ill-disposed villagers burnt and plundered the whole of the station. There are only about 20 houses unburn in cantonments, and not more than two or three in the civil lines, so we are likely to remain in the fort some time longer. We are, however, allowed to go out,ide the gates in the daytime, and some fortunate persons whose houses, being close to the fort, have not been destroyed, are gone out to live in them. We tried very hard to get one of the houses near the fort, but they were aU taken. We, however, go out for a drive every morning, which is very great pleasure after being shut up so long. Dear 0-, I am sorry to say, has not been at al well lately in consequence of the change of life and very great confinement from being shut up here, but he is quite convalescent, and since we are allowed to take our morning drives he is getting strong, and has regained his appetite. We have been very well ever since we came in the fort, indeed we have nothing to complain of on the score of health. The fort, thank God, is very healthy considering how many human beings are crowded in it. Including servants we have 5,000 persons sleeping every night within the walls. We are aU very cheerful considering the circumstances, and when we assemble outside our quarters we are almost a merry party. We are much with our kind friends, whose quarters are nex tdoor to ours, except in the heat of the day, when we are all obliged to retire to our own dens to escape from the heat, which is then very great. " We drove down yesterday to look at our house, which, being a Puckah house, is not muoh injured-doors taken away, punkahs destroyed, so that it might be made habitable in a few daya; but it is considered too far from the fort for us to live in at present. However, we live in hopes that when General Havelock has relieved Lucknow he will come here on his way to Delhi, and the very idea of his being on the road with his troops wiU quiet down the district and make any part of AgrA safe to live in. We were much cheered last night by the news from Delhi of the destine. tion of the powder manufactory with 500 gunpowder makers. In fact, the rebels are getting (dispirited. I shall not write about the horrors at Cawnpore and Delhi; we can bat humbly thank God Agra has beea sDared. I hope you will get this letter; we are only allowed to send very small light letters, as the dAk is now crried by men, instead of horses." DELHL The following is an extract from a letter by an officer of the Bengal Artillery:- " Camp before Delhi, August 13. "In my last I think I mentioned something about dating thlletter from the ' King's Palace' lnstead of 'Before Delhi ' but we are stil at the old work, holding our own quietly and giving the Pandles a thrashing whenever they venture too close. Although nominally we have several regiments here, in atulnunmberswehavebutfew. At no period, I imagine, have the European regiments, both Queen's and Company's been so weak. With theexception of the 8th and61stthe others are all whole regiments, a few men only being left behind at their respective depots, and yet not one comes up to the strength of a healthy wing. " On the 8th of June, when we first arrived here, I be. lieve by an assault we could probably have taken possession of the city. The enemy, never doubting but that they would easily beat us off, contented themselves by taking up a very strong position -some three lnUes in advance of the cantonmeuts, with a strong zeserve to fall back upon In and about the cantonments themselves, and, as we have since ascertained, didlittle towards strengthening the batteries on the city walls; besides which, their numbers then did no probably exceed 16,000 or 17,000 fighting men. Had we however, taken the city, our force was at that time so small that we should have had great difficulty in merely keeping It, without being able to render assistance to any other part of the country; neither have we been able to do that directly from our present camp, but the mere fact of our being here in front of Delhi has attracted all the matineers to this one spot, without which loadstone they would certainly have wandered all i over the count'ry. Our communiestion with the Punjab would have been cut off by their getting round to the rear. We should have had the greatest difficulty In getting supplies, as with the numbers their army has swelled to they could have surrounded the whole city and rendered our foraging a work of great danger, instead of which we have had a daily post in from the North-west; and after the first few days supplies of every description have been plentiful. Besides this, had a report been spread that the mutineers were on their way to IJmballah and the Punjab, the people would have risen universally with them. Even now it is generally believed that the Putteeala Rajah as well as several Sirdars in the Julltmdur, and other Doabs of the Punjab' are greatly inclned to join the rebels; but, seeing aU work and business carried on as usual, they have sense enough to feel that our Government is not auite at an end, although there Is no doubt it has received a great shook. " Our position here is certainly by nature a wonderfuly secure one, and, if the Pandies oould not have found a better place than Delhi as the head-quarters of their mutiny, with an unlimited magazine at their disposal, I doubt if we could have been so well off anywhere. Providence has assisted us in every way ; from the beginning the weather has been most propitious, and in cantomnents I have never seen troops so healthy as they are here now. Cholera occasionally pays us a visit, but that must always be ex. pected in a large standing camp. The river Jumna completely protects our left front and flank, while the large jheel (water course) which runs away to the south-west is at this season quite impassable for miles, and prevents any surprise onl our right flank, so that a few cavalry are sufficient as a guard for three faces of our position, and we are consequently enabled to devote our whole force to keep our front from sirprise; but to do this whenever we are attacked in any force takes almost every available man In camp. At a moderate caloulation the enemy must muster now nearly 40,000 men, besides guns unlimited, and they certainly work them well; their infantry also fight well, but their cavalry, both regular and irregular, are not worth one sixpence, they do nothing but run a-way. " Of aU the infantry regiments here the most distinguished Is the 60th lifles ; they and the gallant little Ghoorkas in the Sinnore Battalion have borne the brunt of the whole affair, and suffered fearfuly; after them come the ]st Fusileers aud the Gulides. This morning we surprised a battery they had recently erected rather too near to our picketg, and in such a position that our heavy guDis could not bear on it, so it wa5 decided to carry it by assault. The lst Fasileers and Coke's l'unjab Rifles (also a fine corps) did the business well, each regiment capturing two guns. We always suffer immensely in officers. A third of our number have been killed or wounded in the two months, besides which cholera has carried off several; however, we shall soon bring the business to an end. To-morrow a reinforcement under Nicholson comes in, consisting of 1,000 European infantry and about the same number of natives, and a second-class siege train has left Ferozepore en route to this. Whether Sir Patrick Grant arrives or not, as soon as the train comes we shal, I hope, go in. Having waited so long it is better perhaps to finish up well by shelling the town for several days and maldng a decent breach. All agree that taking it by assault is out of the question, and our batteries, on account of the great height of the glacis, will have to be advanced so close that a practicable breach will be made in a day or two after we once commence, so there will be no delay when once we have the train. I do so long to see the inside of this hateful place. It has been proved without a doubt that the King's son shot several European men and women with his own hand, yet even with this there are some people who talk of a pardon for the ' poor misguided king and his family.' I only trust all the women and children wil have been removed, for once inside few will be spared; it will be an extraordinary day for those that see the end of it If the Pandies only wait to fight, but I sometimes think the greater part will be off with the plunder they have got, and wo shall have to follow them up somewhere else. " I have given you this long account of our numerical strength, position, &c., as I have no doubt there will be plenty of people in England, as there are on all these occasions, who wiU be ready to abuse all that has been done here. Even in this country several cry out to take Delhi without any more delay, as If we were not, one and al, anxilous to do so. But the fate of aU India depends on our success; were a failure to be tho result God only knows what would take place-the whole country would, I really believe, turn against us. You, who know Delhi so well, and can understand what treops we really have, will be able to judge as to whether our policy has been the correct one, "This business has been strangely fatal to our chiefs. The fivemnuwhoformedthe I Council of War' first at Umballah are alldead; Generals AnsonandBarnard, BrigadierHallfaxand Colonel Mowatt of cholera, and Colonel Chester, Adjutant. General, killed in action. Then came General Reed, who had to leave hIf dead, and Chamberlain, as Adjutant. General, vwhose wound will incapacitate him for work for montsh. Our preeent commander, Wilson, of the Artillery, is strog and well, and I hope he may have better luck. The P on afford liofs, which wc Qanot, ad on some1 occasions our men have been on the qui vive for 60 hours at a time. AU do their work cheerfully, and no army conld, I am sure, do more than this has. DRTAIL OF TnR ARMY BXFORE DELHI, FROM JUNE 8 TO AUGUST 10, 1857. Resgioexts for Duty on 'he 10th of AutL IB57. PESHAWUR. The following is from an officer serving in the Punjab: Peshawar, July 21. "You vill be glad to learn by this mail that, though risings have taken place in many parts of India dine my last, here we have been tolerably quiet, with the exception of the force at Fort Mackisore, which mado over-tures to the hill tribes, and were discovered intriguing by our indefati. gable Commisoner, Colonel Edwardes. As soon as he heard what was going on, he told the negotiators In the hiUls to ask the Sopoys of the fort to givethem a written promlse to deliver up the fort. Then he had them; and one night.s with a considerable body of cavalry and two guns of the mountain train, under my friend Colonel S.'s old adjutant, Captain B., off he started for the fort, halted half way, and sent abodyof 150'menby anotherroad, sothattheymight get to the rear of the fort by the gray of early dawn. These arrangements, cleverly made and well executed, enabled him to surprise the mutineers. The Colonel arrived before thQ fort before daybreak, and had the pleasure of hearing the neighing of his cavalry horses on the other side, just as he reached the place. They were all unarmed and taken back, and being called upon laid down their arms. The chief negotiator, a havildar, was at that very time in the'hills, and when the roll was called was miesing. He was shortly after brought in by the hill chief, and, two days after, blown away from a gun. " Edwardes deserves great credit for this peaceful termi. nation of his expedition, for, knowing the fort, he had taken the precaution of seizing the keep, the fort itself having no gates. Had the mutineers been able to get into the keep when the colonel summoned them to lay down their arms, they certainly would have fought; but the day before he sent off a Pathan havildar and eight Sepoys with two mules and a couple of empty panniers. All that he told the havildar was to take the panniers into the keep and make them over to the officer who resided there and who com. manded the garrison. The Pathan was further instructed to be very particular to closa the gates at night, and not to open them again on any account till the sun next morning was pretty high. He obeyed his instructions to the letter, and the appearance of the force, before the fort next morning showed him the reason why he had been told to keep the gates shut. "The whole garrison were made prisoners. All the movements here have been made with consummate wisdom hitherto, but we have a very large nativo force here, although without arms; and nothing but anremitting vigilance can save us. Three regiments are armed, and would doubtless turn against us, and five regiments are uuarmed. I cannot conceal from myself that we ate by no meane strong, inasmuch as we have the whole of this large cantonment to protect, and the fort also; and thus the Europeans are parcelled out in guards, and not con. centrated. " Besides them, we have Pathan levies, not yet equal to their work, and some Sikhs, together with a good number of Mooltani horso, who will stand by us. So we must hope for the best; but we have sent away a troop of European Horse Artillery, a horse field battery, and 63 European Foot Artilerymen. This has weakened us and we are making shift by using the officers of the disarmed regiments partly to man the ArtiUlery division. " Our accounts of the 55th Native Infantry; who fled into Swat, and who left that country at the request of the high priest, are very gratifying. Their money is nearly expended and their ammunition also. They have made several attempts to slip through the range of hills bordering on our territory, but the passes have been well guarded by the Pathans, who are favourable to us. Half.a-dozen deter. mined men could hold these passes against a multitude. I saw a letter from the Deputy Commissioner of Huzara to Colonel E-, telling him all that he had been doing, and he says that the Sepoys number about 500, and. Fiat the women of tho hills abuse them for sitting down to cook their meals naked, and that they are now making for Chilas or G{lghit; but if I know these paths at all they will nearly all perish [from hunger and cold, as the coDntry ls without food or inhabitants. Gholab Slngh also is destroying them, yet I do trust that half a-dozen of them may eventually escape to tel1 their countrymen what they have undergone. The 10th Irregular Cavalry, from whom we took every single thing except their shoes and turbans and one rupee in cash, have been dreadfully punished; not being in the habit of walking, they will reach their homes In a most miserable plfght4 and will be a warning to others all along the road. " Our power, certainly, is tremendous. To think that we should be able to stand for one hour against this array, and almost without reinforcements, for they are not yet at Delhi, though near. " Our Brigadier Is Indefatigable in looking after his force here, and he has just hit upon an expedient by which he will be enabled to despatch 400 Europeans in a few hours to any place. He has secured the use of several ammunition carts, and by connecting two together he manages to carr 12 men, and even 16 on an emergency, with their arms and some eatables. He will have relays of the Company's bul. locks at the dlfferent stages on the road, so as to move bu a point without a halt. " The first one was tried by the brigadier last week. The party consisted of four ladies, the brigadier, Colonel Edwardeg, the chaplain, and fonr other officers. They harnessed six artillery horses, each ridden by an officer, and they glloped all over the cantonments. How the ladies must have suffered, for there were no springs. i"Part of my old regiment that mutinied and went to Delhi the other day, left It again and gave themselves up. This Is the only regiment that has done so. I don't know what has beer. done with them; for my part I would destroy them al, for It is impossible to believe them sincere in their repentance when we consider the extraordinary aots of treachery of which these people have been guilty towards us. " The 9th Irregular Cavalry, now before Delhi, allowed the enemy's cavalry to enter camp the other day and cut down many of our people, and yet they arc trusted. What infatuation! " But now nothing can prove in a stronger llght the folly of our Government entrusting to Mussulinans and Hindoos any authority in th6e country. Those very people, our own servants, educated by us and placed in situations of trust, have turned against us at this crisis. Such treason has rarely been witnessed. "The mouths of babblers at home wiU be stopped, I hope, and India henceforward ruled with the strong hand. How absurd the foUy of placing any authority in the hands of such miscreants. " You wiU be glad to hear the news of the almost total annihilation of the 55th Native Infantry, who were trying toescape towards Gilghit; they were attacked by the Mahomedans in themountaitn, many were drowned in crossing a mountain torrent, 60 taken prisoners, and the rest fled In every direction. These 60 will probably be blown Away from the:guns in Huzara. "There is a fight going on now in Eusofzaie, Our Deputy-Comulaidoner, CaptainJames, ha taken a force to a large village known to be rebellious. Nothing but bloodshed all over the country. A friend of mine in Cashmere has offered to raise a corps of Dogr Balipoots for the Britisb, They re Hill Raipoots of the same tribe as Maharajah Gholab Singh. He seems to think that the ladies had better all go to Cashmere for safety, as a few men could hold that country against an rmy." EERUT. The following is from an offioer at Meerut:- " No. 2 Barrack, Meerut. "I have not even now received one latter sinoe the 10th of MAy. What ha3 become of them I cau't say. This has grieved me very much. Situtted as we all are, and have been, letters from England are of tenfold value. It has been a hard fight, and hundreds have been murdered -men, women, and chUdren; at Cawnpoxe and Futtyghur alone fully 350, it not many more. Mothers murdered before their children, and even babies hacked to pieces on their mothers' breasts. The massacre there have been dreadful-horrible-more than any accounts I may have given. I send you a batch of extrcts from the Lahore Chironicte, which, horrible as they are, may give you some satisfaction in reading, as giving proof of the deservedness of the punishments we are inflicting and shall Inflict. Never sinoe the beginning of the -world have such. acts been perpetrated as have been committed here, and by the men we fed and were kind to. Nea-ly 80 men have been hung, and nearly 1,000 killed in the district. We are strongly fortified here, and do not fewr an attack from any number. Delhi has not fallen, but thousands hsve been killed. Our men cannot be restrained, and they are like demons let loose. We hAve had more than 20,000 men attacking 3,000 or 4,000, and they have fled losng hundreds. 600 men at Agr thrashed 5,000, the mutineers being entrenched, and having 12 gans playing round shot and shelL They cannot stand our charge for a moment; 18 gentlemen mounted (all the cavalry we had on this occasion) checked 500 cavalry, and these are but two out of hundreds of Instances of gallantry displayed all over the country. This has saved us, by God's mercy. I as going to Delhi to the camp. I shall be with aSikh oorps. These (the Sikhs), as Also the Gheorkas (hiU men), have fought with us like Europeans. Had it not been for them we might have been all murdered and turned out of the country. Had Buropean troops been sent as asked for and advised, thousands of Uves would have been saved. You Will learn more than I can tell you by the papers. Should God spare my life I wiU give you news of the total destruc. tion of thousands of Sepoys assembled in Delhi from akl parts of India. This is near at hand. Among our enemies are thousands of the worst sort of people,-vlz., ' Goojurs,' and I believe every Mussulman in the cotutry. We have found many here whom every one would have supposed incapable of it, and they have been some of the principal leaders in the riots. The Sepoys have lost all spirit (if they ever had any when opposed to us). The Hindoos and Mussulmans quarrel, and the Hindoos reproach them and say, ' This is all your fault.' No mattor, we care not. We only know their lives are forfeited,and that not one shall be spared. Many innocent may be killed, but they have brought the curse on themselves. Think of their cutting up children before a father's eyes and putting the pieces in his mouth, and putting other babies alive into boxes and burning them! Would any one believe this? Acts like this produce such as the following. The High. landers and others passed through Cawnpore the other day, where those brutal murders had been committed, and they kIllea every native they could find. And they did but justice, for all were implicated. They either helped or remained passive. Columns wil be formed to move about all over the country, and the Sepoys wiU be hunted down like beasts, " We havo a eorps here of mounted volunteers, in number about 30-gentlemen, a few officers, and tradesmen. They went out not long ago against 3,000 Goojurs, people of the villages near here; they killed a great many, cut off the head of their leader, and stuck It on a pole. They are soon put tn flight, their dread of the 'gora log,' or white people, is so great. They are armed with matchlocks, spears, and swords." THE BOMBAY ARMY. The following is an extract of a letter from Belgaum, dated August 23 : "None of the native officers of the 27th Regiment have rebelled. This is a good sign; the rest of the Sepoys will, I hope, remain firm. The Kolapoor mutineers had to travel some distance; 25 were captured st Sawunt Warree. " Aug. 10. "Intelligence reached us to-day of the slaughter of 20 of the Kolapoor mutineers by their own regiment. It appears these men could not get on at all below the ghat where they at first went. They could get no money and no food, sothey came back, and on being observed barricaded themselves in a temple. The officers led out the regiment, who broke Into the place where the men were, and, after a sharp handto-hand fight In close quarters, they bayonetted the whole. A few of the men of the regiments had trifling wounds. Now there are but 25 of the mutineers loose in the country. ."Aug. 11. "Two companies of the 2d EuLropean Light Infantry came in this morning. The poor fellows were drenched to the skin, aud had eaten no food for two days. The officers all marched on foot, and they were for the most part lame when they arrived. These companies are to go on to Dharwar on being relieved by two companies of the 86th. We have now 400 avaUable Europeans, and I think with them and the artillery we equal to Anything. I attended the ourt. martial on Sheik Usman, a greater rogue than the Moonshee. He appears to have directed his letters in English. I saw the letters written inside in the native character, and also the English translation, to the effect that everything was in readiness here. Several leading men in the town and in the native regiments (no names) were ripe for the insurrection. The plan for taldng the fort, making the prisoner com. mander, and cutting the throats of all Christians, was also laid out. The English were a parcel of fools, and did not smell the rat.' There were many other subjects discussed in the epistles, but the pith I have given you, and if these hadnotbeen intercepted we should not havebeen in the land of the living. I afterwards rode up to the camp and passed Ihe European lines. The soldiers looked much more com. fortable with their clean kit, and were enjoying their pipes. " Aug.13, (I To-day n6st exciting events have happened. Two me-n heve been sentenced to death, and are to be blown away from guns to-morrow. The Moonshee's trial came to a close to-day, when he was found guilty. Another man, a Perdassie, was tried by a court-martial at the artillery mes room. The chief witness was the adjutant of one of the regiments, and his testimony was corroborated by the Jemidar. This man, it seems, had come to try and incite the Sepoys to insurrection, and the Jemidar, a Havildar, and Naick, directly they were aware of his intentions, informed the adjutant, who accompanied them to thellnes, whenthey hid him in a hut behind a plain deal door with chinks in It. They then introduced the Perdassie, and the adjutant took down on paper the mutinous conversation. Under such circumstances the rascal was, of course, convicted, and to-morrow wll meet the fate he deserves. I shall go and see him execated, as I thinrk that every Europan ought by his presene to show to the natives his con. currence with the justioe of the sentence; and I am sure when we consider for a moment that had those letters of the lioonshee not been intercepted we should all hAve ha our tbroats cut, it takes away all pity that one might otherwie bave feltforthesowretched men. Ieradthe transhtionsofthe Moonshee's letters, three in number. Like those of the Per dassle, their plans were All arranged as nicely as posible. One ws to the Moulavie of Poona, telling him tho Englsh Were qUite in ignorance as to what was going on. He also wrote to Kolapor, and the mutiny In that place is attributed to him. S- has been Indefatigable in getting evidence and keeping spies. It waz entirely through his Means that these letters were intercepted. These are indeed exciting times. God grant all may be well yet in Bengal, and that no such insurrection may break ont here! I had to break the tidings of the sentences to the pribners this evening, and to obtain a confession, which I believe he got. A"Aug. 14. "This day the traitors were blown away from guns at 4.30 p.m. I mounted my horse, and on the ways met the prisoners In a cart guarded by a detachment of the 64th; presently we arrived at the place of execution. It was on the little course. There was a square formed. On one side were the Mahratts horse; on the other some Shetsandi policoe from the villages at the bottom, and the direction ia which the guns were pointed were the rabble, and at the other face were the 29th and 15th Native Infantry and the 2d Europeans drawn up, and between them and the guns all the Sahib.log stood. Every one was present, from the General downward. The Adjutant-General read the senD tenoe outto the prisoners,and they were then led to theguns, and at a 'given signal off they went. That rascal of a Moonshee waa: drawing 150 rupees -month for instructing officers of regiments in Hindostauee at the very time he was plotting their death. I should have mentioned that a Havildar and four men of the 29th were given up by the reglmsul this morning for plotting against Government, "Aug. 15. seI visted - this morning on the way to the Bymkhaas. He informed me on the previous night he had left the mea nwith a friend who h1A driven him home, but the sharee he Wau to have gone in, and which he had sent away, was stopped near a Muaulman muajid, near a tope of trees, by two men, who had kamlin over their heads They asked if there was a Saib insde, and, on the driver replying no,determined to look themselves, and got into the cart and poked about with a stick. I saw the marks. The Mussuslmans re said to want to kldl a Europeen, to sacrifice him to the newly-made slant who rs-s exected yeterday. I accompanied S- this avening on the rounds. " Aug. 16. "I went down to the llne, and was present at the parade assembled to promote the Jemidar, Havildar, and Naick repectively, on account of the pinful discharge of their duties in maldng known the plot got up by the Perdassie. The General addreased each of them; he a*so called out the adjutant and complimented him, and informed him he had brought his conduct to the notioe of the Commander-in-Chlef. This was a more gratifying spectacle thin that of the day before yesterday. The General has been indefatigable; he told me of the number of proni dentil interferences that had oocurrod for our benefit, but under Providence nothing has tended more to the afety of the Southern Mahratta country thn the judiciouS measures taken by General L. and the fadden throw. lng in of detchmenta of Europea troop. General L has throughout acted promptly, firmly, and judiciously, and, aided by Mr. S-, the superintendent of policoe, has frustrated the plot, which, had It not been discovered, would have caused the ridng of all the native regiments in the division." MISSOUREE. Extract of a letter from a lady, dated Mussouree, August 9:- "- We are very busy working flannel c16thes for our army before DelhL They are very badly off for these things, and being so much exposed at such a season of the year, and In such a proverbially unhealthy locality, and fighting as they have done so nobly, they really deserve to be provided for by us. Mrus. C. and myself have collected 350 rupees here for this purpose, and are constantly at work In consequence, for, with the exception of our own taUors, and one or two others ladies have given up to us, we can get none. Money is scarce, servants ditto, and everything at ruinous prices. Mr.-, the clergyman here, is also col. lecting for the same purpose, and has got some 500 rapees; Mr.-, atLaudour, 900,rupees; add to this the coUections at Sinla, Kussowlee, and Meerat, and our poor soldiers, and the little Ghoorkse too, wil get many comforts, you will see. Wonderful to say, though I never did such a thing in my life before, I have the management of our portion of the business, which keeps me employed from early morning tiU late at night. We meet, with sevoral other ladles, at Dr. C.'s house every day, and as many tailors as we can ooUlet, and stikh away." NYNEE TAL. The following is from an officer at Nynee Tal:- " August 5. "Since I wroteyesterday news has come thatthe Hindoos have risen against the Mahomedans and seized lMoradabad and the guns there, and that they have also spilt and are ready to go at one another's throats in BareiUy. The Mahomedans have been oppressing the Eindoos terribly, and the worm has turned. The Hindoos are numerous enough to win the day if they are stnch. " They are also very well affected to us (at leat in this neighbourhood), and have been sending us constant messages to come back again, which -weshould have done if we had had any force here at all-I mean even two available field guns and 200 or 300 cavalry to go with the Ghoorkas nd us. The Eindoos reaZy seem to mean fighting now. ' This is the best news we have heard for a long time. The religious split will spread everywhere like wild fireinto Delhi itself in all probability-and whichever loses, flindoo or Mahomedan, we ought to win. It also makes us at Nynee Tal quite secure from any attack, for some time to come at any rate. I have sent a copy of this letter to my mother." The following is an extract from a letter received from an Artillery officer at Calcutta, dated August 23:- " Things are on the whole looking much brighter than when last I wrote. The telegraph communication has been restored to Benaes, and the post-office now is open to Cawnpore. News has been just received that Lucknow is safe. General Havelock, although he could not reach tho place, has saved It. The enemy went out to oppose him, and the garrison, taking advantage of this, immediately salUied out took a large quantity of provisions, and went back again aU right. The enemy, finding that there was then no chance of starving them out for a long time, and knowing by experience that they would not easily be forced out, began to quarrel among themselves and to move off. Colonel Inglis, of the 32d Queen's, now commands at Lucknow; he has done good service. " The mutineers at Delhi are on their last legs; they are quarreling among themselves, and have been dreadfully defeated every time they have como out. They are now entirely surrounded, and are begging for mercy, which of course has been refused. Disease is carrying them off by hundreds, and death by the sword or halter awaits the survivors. " What will the natives nowr say? With every advantage on their side, they having chosen their own time, and having succeeded in taking us entirely unawares, and the whole army, with, very few exceptions, having united to expel us, they find us stlll able with a few troops not only to keep but to win back the country, even before the home reinforcements shvU have arrived. The Sepoys have often said that they had won and kept the country for us. Now they seo their distake, It has bcen proved over and over again 'hat 100 Europeams wrl easily beat 1,000 natives, even those disciplined and taught by ourselves"

POLICE. BoW-emsrr.--Shortly after the business of the Court had been disposed of, Mr. Sprague, of Villiers-street, Strand waited u nMr. JARDINE, the presiding magistrate, an, zeuested his worship to perue a letter which he had recived from a clerk of the Charing-oross Hospital, ann Wkich he considered a very i;n3lent production. It would be remembered that on onday morning last,' when his worhip presided, a young girl was charged with having attempted to drown hes i one of the fountain reservoir8 At Trfalg r-square. She was dragged out almost dead, appa. rent, by a young man named Jamee, and he (Ir. Sprague) g procured a cab, they prooeeded with another gentle. man to the above hospital. This was as near 11 o'clock as poe. sible. The door was opened by a porter, who was gtupidl drunk, and an elderly woman, neither of whom would take the poor girl in, although she was in oonvulsions, and ater waiting a-quarter of an hour they proceeded to West. minster Hospital, where hea was Immediately attended to. The next day Mr. Bennett, the house4urgeon, called uponz the magistrate, and very coolly stated that the porter was not drunk- that the hour wa 1 'clock in the morning in. stead of 1x at night ;and that he wasonly a " little aleepy" from being suddenly disturbed. Mr. Bennett added, tt he eame out and spoke to witneas, and that he (hr. Spraguenever maw or spoke to that gentleman on the coca. Qcun. With respect to the hour, it could be seen by the charge-sheet, as well as by the evidenoe of the policeman and others present, that the hour was rightly stated by him (Mr. Sprague) to be U1 o'clock. He attended at Bow.- street the next morning to answer Mr. Bennett's extraor. dins uasertions, but was informed that his Worship would not be sitting again until to-day, The letter referred to Was a follows:- 81rtoI a eroseqsue" by tho weklri oftbo"s of the Catgcoaf Hospltaj to writeto socm upon the alteiseenta which nou bave rmade to bate made, hate coo-d reaom to believe to be wholly void of truth, so farM ber a er ory to te d rrhe ofe othe bstbe t su ortoln cam be enthted h oard wull be repared to Pero their duty : bourt i ot,then th bX w relyo on Yourc d tn an e7arb Powe to bfe a must ensue frm the statuents which, tbrough ou have r~~ ~~ to the thebboar EL wOLoonClerk MEr.

WESTxsTER t.Mr Rlichard Clayton, described as a jobmaster and gingerbeer and sodawater manufacturer, living at 37b, Hugh-street, Belgrave.road, was placed at the bar before Mr. PAnYER, charged with violating the person of Hannah Bond, a diminutilve child under the age of 14 when tho offenco was alleged to have been com. mitted. Mr. PAnwTxu said he would not accopt bail, and the prisoner was remandod for the oompletion of the evidence. WoSP.sThrm W-William and Caroline Pettit, man and wife the former by trade a French polisher, were charged r,efore Mr. D'EYycoURT with the following rob. eries:- Mr. Waltemr of the firm of Walters and Son, silk mannu facturers in Wilson-street, Finsbury, was the prosecutor in. the first case, and he stated that it was the custom of their house to periodically go through their stock and books, and on doing so in the early part of July they were astonished at the discovery that there was a decrease in the quantity of slks to the value of at leat 120. It was utterly impossible to account for this until it was reoollected that in that quarter the premises had been put into a state of thorough repair, and, as it was probable that some of the workmen so employed might have been engaged in the robbery, inqumies were made which resulted in the approe hension of the prisoner. The prosecutor's porter, Edward Lefevre, deposed to the prisoner being one of the workmen employed by the house. decorator engaged by the prosecutors to make the alterations referred to, and that after these alterations were apparently completed the prisoner had repeatedlr called there at an early hour in the morning wnth a large bag apparently filled with tools, and, stating that he had been sent by his master, said he had oome to finish some little odd jobs of lishing which there had not been time to do before. As e had oen so much about the premises previously no SU. plcion was entertained of him, and he was readily admitted tut it ras noticed that he always somehow contrived to leave the house at a time when witness was so engaged that he could not see him. Inspector Brecknell and Evans, a detective officer, stated that in consequenoe of these circumstances being stated to them, they went to the house in Gresham-buildings, City, where they found the prisoner, and charged him with robbing Meesrs. Waltes He strongly denied it, bat oxt searching the place they discovered secreted in a lower room a number of pieces of silk, which were afterwards identified by the prosecutors as having been stolen from them, and also a number of pawnbrokere duplicates. On these boing found the female prisoner who had been asked if she hadanything about herconnected with the robbory, and had declared she had not, was noticed to be uietiy leaving the room, and was followed and stopped by 'vans, who detected her in the act of handing to a man at the door a small paper parcel, which he snatched froma her, and on this being opened it was found to contain no less than 42 duplicates, for dlks, jewelry, and we ring apparel, a great portion of which was believed to be the produce of simUiar robberies Two pawnhrokers' assistants produced portions of the stolen property pledged in the month of July, part by the male prisoner in the assumed name of Bennett, andr part byarwoman whopgve theonameof Mtary Webb, but who was believed by the shopman to have been the female prisoner herself. The second charge was preferred by Mr. Edward Forde, a manufacturer in AIdermnnbnry, who identified the male prisoner as having been employed for two days in decorating his premises, subsequently to which a quantity of property was missed, and he now recognized some gros de Naples and the wrapper round it as his, which he could unhesitatingly do from his private m rks being still upon them. The mal risoner sought for a sumamary adjudication by pleadingguilty to both charges, and Mr. D'EyNcoURT havin dischrged the wife, as most probably acting under theinfluence and control of her husband, sentencod the male prisoner to two separate terms of six and four months' hard labour in the House of Cor. rection. SOUTHwARK.-John Mahoney, a young fellow about 1S years of age, wRs brought before Mr. Co.)=, charged with stealing a travelling-bag containing a purse in which was a check for 91 3s. ld. a Crystal Palace season-ticket, and other property, from 1rs. Lydia Martha Barlow, the wife oE Dr. Barlow, the physician. The prosecutrix stated that she was passing along Black man=street, in the Borough, about 1 o'clock that afternoon, and whiledloougat Mr. Dodson's shop she felt some one snatch her travelling-bag from her, and on looking round she saw the prisoner running away with it up a court close by. Mr. Dodson pursued the prisoner, and eventually he was taken into custody, and her property was recovered. Mr. Henry Dodson, 9S, Blackman-street, said that he savr the prisoner snatch the ba from Airs. Barlow, and he pursued him up the court adjoininz his house into Ltttle Lant. street, where he climbed over a wall. Witness went round and captured him in a watercloset. He was positive that the prisoner was the lad who committed the robbery, as he never lost sight of him until he climbed the wall. PoUce-constable 134 M said that he received informatioa of the robbery, and captured the prisoner in the back premises of a house in Little Lant-street He made no resistance, hut deDied all knowledge of the robbery or the lady. Witness, with tbe assistance of Mr. Dodson, searched the placewhere the prisoner was car tured, and in the watercloset they found Mrs. Barlows bag and al the propert stolen from. her. Mr. CoMBE asked the prisoner whether he woulf or go to the sessions? If the The prisoner, ina sullen manner, said it vwas no use saying anything about It after what the witnecses had stated. He should plead " Guilty," and ask his worship to deal witb him. Mr COErBE said it was an impudent robbery, and ha should sentence him to six months' hard labour. LA%mnnr.-Henry Welch, a stoker employed in the Vauxhall Gasworks, was placed at the bar, charged with Inflictingsuch injuines on his wife as to have caused her death. Police-constable 49 L stated that from information he had received, that the prisoner had seriously imused his wife, he set about making inquiries, and ascertained that the woman wa sying danTrously ill, under the care of Mir. Thompson, surgeon of auxhall.walk. At first the poor woman rallied, but eventually plysis ensued, and as she was stated by her medical attendant to be in imminent danger he felt it his duty to take the prisoner into custody. He had since Iearnt that the unfortunate woman had died that (Saturday) moOrning at 7 o'clock, and that an inquest would beheld on Monday (this day). 'Under such circumstances, he had to ask for a remand. Mr. ELLIOxr acquiesed and remanded the prisoner to this day, and refused to; t him to hail.

Captain Talavera Ve:ron Anson (1811) is appointed to the good-service pension in the gift of the Admiralty by the pro,motion of Captain J. .Kingcomne to flog rank. Captain Anson was commander of the Pylades in the operations against and at the captQer of Canton, and also of Amoy in i41. He recently was Captain of the James Watt, 01. The newly built 5l-gien screw frigate Idelpomene, recently launched at Pembroke, arrived at Spithead on Saturday evening, and *viU go into Portsmouth harbour-to-day to be immediately docked and equipped for commission. The Diadem, 32, I,;0Q-horse power, Captain Moorsoin, C. B. deranged some of her machinery on Friday on her first trial, which prevented a satisfactory report of the result She realized a speed of between 1l and 12 knots. The officers and men of the fleet in Portsmouth harbour have contributed a day's pay towards the fund for the relief of the suflerers by the rebellion in India. The steam transport Duo de Brabant, whioh ^rrived at Woolwich on Friday in charge of a Belgian crew, will in fkuture be known under the name of the Prince Albert, which has been substituted for that of the Dec de Brabant since her engagement for the conveyance of troops to India. Captain Younghusband, who commanded the Sovereign in the transport service during the late Russian war and whose experienoe of 16 years' service aflor.thas rendered himie eligible for the post, has been appointed to the comnmand of the Prince Albert, and has succeeded in engaging an efficient body of officers and crew, who will consist of about 100 of every olass. Each of the officers on entering the Company's service is provided with a complete suit of naval uniform froo of cxpense. According to her rate of peed performed in two trial trips of 16 knots per hour it is expected that she will reach Bombay in, and probably under 60 days, a voyage hitherto unprecedented. The Plrincess Charlotte, another of the Company's vessels, is beiing fitted out at Southam,pton, the whole of their steame-s having been tendered to and accepted by the India-house. The Defenice convict hulk, now in dock at Woolwich,having been condemned as unfit for further service, is ordered to be forthwith broken up. The riggers, wbosae exertions during the fire on board that vessel, were recommended for the consideration of the Lords of the Admiralty, have been granted a bounty of 14 days' extra pay each, the leading man to be presented with a donation of 51. The Defence is the last convict vessel now remaining at Wool. vich, the sister ship Warrior baving been broken up and disposed of by public auction, realizing about 3,0001. The iron screw steam store-ship Industry, Master-Commander George J. IHodges, and the Admiralty yacht Black E.agle, Master-Commander Petley, have arrived at Wool. wich from Portsnsouth. The Industry, laden with vic. tualling stores from Asenfrion, was on her arrival on Satur. day ordered to Deptford to discharge cargo. About 1,000 extra hands were taken into the Rfoyal Arsenal at Woolwich last week, to be employed in the War Department for the stpply of the last India Company, principaUy in cating iron ordnance, and preparing cartridges and ammunition. About 00 additional hands are ordered to be engaged for tle Royal Carriage-square to. eorrow. The military steau store vessel Balaklava arrived at Woolwich on Saturday from the west, laden with returned stores. Mr. W. Ei. Clyma, assistant-paymuaster, was on Saturday appointed to the Ganges, as seowetary's clerk to Admiral Baines. Captain Shawe, late 5th Dragocn C*nards, barrackliiaster at Aberdeen, has beer appointed in a simuilar capacity at Preston, Lanicashire. Captain d. Forbes, late 11th Foot, barrackrnaster at Dandee, succeeds Captain Shawe a; Aberdeen. Tir mhILITIL. The officers of the Ist Royal East Xiddlesex Militia have, through their ccmmnnmding officer, Colonel Wood, for. warded to Lord Paninure an offer of their services. This xegiment is now upwards of 1,000 rankand ile. RIecruiting has proceeded actively for the East Snifolk Artillery Militia, and since the disembodiment of the regimnent a few months s.nce 303 xien have baen enrolled. The West .ssex Militia wil not be callad out this year. The Glaniorganshize Artille-ry Militia has assembled at Swansea, and the men are regularly drilled three times a- day, viz., from 6 to 7, 19 to 1, and :3 to 5, o'clock, making siX hours each day. Tha recruitc do not come in so rapidly as expected. The North l-ncolnthiha Regiment of Militia, which has been ordered to assemble for duty at Lincoln on Wednesday next, will niuster a day latec in consequence of the general fast. The Rtoyal Noteh Glocester tia is to L3 embodied. T'he present head-quarters are at Cirencester, The staff of the {;hropshice M ilitiz have rece-ved orders -to recruit for 40 regiments of the line. The Royal MerioneUshire Rcgimen' of Rifle Militia have assembled at Bala for training. The regiment har attained its full complement.
ji1lNlF'OBw'M.SEXys b i: I.Nlj;.klXV do not pretend to be in the 1;ecrets of the Cabinet. Brt what need he -secrets no longer are the announcemsats that the stalndard for recruits for regiments of' the UIne is reduced *to the lowest limit which it reaohed doing the Russian war -that a further addition of 5,000 men is held in readiness to embark for India; that is to say, four battaions of Anfantry and two of cavalry -and, further, that :l,'000 more of the Mfitia are to be embodied, in ad4ition bt the 15,6CO already designated for garrison duty to eapply the draia upon the troops of the Line sent to tie East. It will be remembered that at the very eve of the proro. gation of Parliament an Aot vws passede to enable the 4<ueen to embody the xhole of tbe Militia force of the B nited Kuingdom, if necessary. At the sa6me time, a surn ,of 200,000W. vas voted to aid in the pa.yment of so cauch of this force as was likely to be requ*red. At that time it was supposei that from 10,000 to 15,000 men Wveld be required of the Militia. It is now foand that a larger namber will be wanted, and the Governnnent are resolved to call out the requisite quantity. The question natualy arises, will it be necemsary to caU Parliament tos t:her b'efore the usual time? We believe that strictly for the purpose of the embodiment of the Militia it will not be necessary to summon Parliament in November, inasmuch as Parliament hag already given authority for that parpose. But if the courge of events should render it necessary to call Parliament together the Government will not shrink from their duty, although, of course, they will not resort to sach a step unleas rendered more necessary than as yet seems iewl to be the case,-Qfrvcr )

FPORCESTE,WJHIBE AGRICULTURA SOCIETY. WORCESTER, SATURDAY. Tho annual meeting of the Worcestershie Agricultural Boclety 'Was held here yestorday, and was remarkable for the u*squalled display of agricultural stock-the best ever -Aown in the county-the attendcance of visitors and the political character of the speeches. The awards of prizes 'which had this yoar been donbled In value, were made in the morning, and in the evening about 150 gentlemen dined together at the GuildbalL The president for the year, the Ron. Frederick Lygon, M.P., took the chatr; and amoig those present were Earl Beauchamp, Viscount Elmley, X,'., the Right Hon. Slr J. S. Pakington, .LP., Sir T. E. Winnington, Bart., M.P.., 3fr. J. H. H. Foley, M.P., and Sir E. H. Lechmere. The Hon. CiiAuR.Nw., in proposing "I the Army and Navy," of course alluded to the Indian mutiny, and observed, in the course of his speech, that while it was right that justice should overtake the evildoers, it was not our duty to meet atrocity with atrocity, for it was the proudest boast of an Englishman that mercy and justice should accompany our victories, but that ptnishment should fall where punishment was due. No language could be too strong to denounce those atrocities, but they should not de. viate from that rigid line of justice -which they had hitberto observed in victory. He could not help expressing his admiration-he might almost say his veneration-for that gSlaut band of men in India who had taken on themselves thetaskof defendingourempirethere. (Loudeheers.) He thought it would be impossible to find, in the pages ot chivalra or of history, any deeds more gallant than those o Gener lHavelock and his gallant band of heroes. (Renewed cheering.) Begardless of the smallness of their number, and actuated by the sentiments which Shakspeare had put in the mouth of King Henry at the battle of Agincourt, he might say of them:- If we are mark'd to die, we armenow "To do our country less; and if to liro, *The fewer men uthe greater are of honons.1 (Loud cheers.) Earl BEaSC55AMSP replied to the toast. Sir T. E. WrNINCTOS gave "the health of the members for the county of Worcester." Viscount ELMLEY, ALP., acknowledged the toast. He gave the Government credit for having so quickly sent off 25,000 men, but they were not justified in leaving the country in such a defenceless state as it had been found in. He then referred to the discussion on the proposition for raising a volunteer corps, and expressed an opinion that if a man could not pay 4501. for a commission he saw no reasan why he could not join the ranks. Re (Lord Elmley) knew men of education who had joined the army, and thelr own telent and ability soon made them non-commissioned offlcers, than whom there was no class of men In England that he had a greater respect for. He considered it a very important point to decide how the army was to be recruited for India. (Hear, hear.) Whatever their experienoe might bave been, he must say that he had a great distrust of all authority when he saw a widely spread conspiracy going on for a considerable time without the knowledge of the authorities. Their present position only showed how little anybody must have known of the character of the Sepoys. He considered the conduct of the Sultan in heading our subscription list would not be without its effect on the nations around. (Cheers.) Mr. FOLEY, ALP., also acknowledged the toast in general terms, and confining himself to agricultural topics. Sir E. H. LECiviERE gave" the members for the borough of Worcestershire." Sir T. E. WiNvNrGTO briefly replied. The Right Hon. Sir J. S. PAKINGTON addressed the meeting at some length in acknowledgment of the toast. First alluding to agricultural subjects, he said the a,ricultural question might be summed up in three expressive words-skill, capital, and security. To secure prosperity a farmer must possess some skill, judiciously apply his capital, and he had a right to expect security, either in long leases, or compensation for unexhausted inprovements. (Loud cheers.) He had just returned from Herefordshire, where he had been told that they had had four har. vests-i, grass; 2, grain; 3, hops; and 4, applesall, both in quality and quantity, as good as could possibly be; and for a scene of fertility and beauty he recommended aU to inspect the apple orchards in the n eighbourhood of Ledbury; a more beauti. ful sight could not gladden the eye of any person. WVhle they had thus occasion to be thankful for these elements of comfort and prosperity at home, they could not close their eyes to the fact that a dark cloud had arisen over a portion of the fortunes of England. He hoped and believed that it was only a passing cloud; but a dark and threatening cloud had arisen, and, at this moment, in that country where only three months ago the representatives of the Queen were exercising power and authority incalmness and security over one of the greatest empires in the world, we saw our own arms turned against us; our soldiers were now our greatest and most ferocious enemies, and a small band of English soldiers, by the exercise of deeds of valour which had never been exceeded, were barely able to keep tleir gi.onnd in some few of the chief strongholds of that country, and were utterly unable, from their paucity of numbers, to protect our countrymen, and, alas ! be must add our countiywomen, from the most dreadful craelties and atrocitics ever committed. (Hear) He (Sir John) was perfectly awrre that one of the rules of the society was that they had nothing to do with politics. He sub-czlbed cordially to that ruIle, but if he read that rule aright It meant this-that they were not to abuse the opportunity which societies of this kind afforded them to seek their own party objects or to promote party interests; but he did not believe that the object of that rule was to impose silence on public men when they attended these meetings in reference to subjects on which the heart of eveiy Englishman was fnu. (1-lear.) If he was not intrudingunduly on their attention (No, no) he would now make some observations on this Painful topic. (Hear, hear.) First he thought it would hardly be becoming for a large body of Englishmen thus to assemble and not to give utterance to the feelings by which they must all be actuated. Further he wished to express a hope that he was not taking any pregumptuous part, and that he was doing nothing which might not be approved by his county friends and neighbours when he told them that, influenced as be was by the present msisis, he had that day ventured to address a letter to the county newspapers, which would be published that night or next morning, expressing a hope tbat the county of Worcester would assemble in a county meeting to express their sentiments on the pre ent crisis of affairs. He had not ventured to take that step on his own authority alone. He had con. sulted the noble Lord-Lieutenpnt and his noble friend on his right, Earl Beauchamp, and they concurred in the wish which he had expressed. He had, therefore, ventured to propose that at the county inmeting they should consider, first, how they should best show, their sympathy for their fellow-countrymen -i India; and secondly, t,at they should present an address to the (Queen, to assure Her Majesty that they appreciated the gravity of the crisis, and that they were prepared to aflord Her Majesty the beat support in their power to conduct the struggle to a triumphart issue. (Loud chests.) He must confess that be felt very anxious that England should speak out in this crisis of its history. Tlhey could not at that moment commit a greater folly than to shut their eyes to the magnitude of the crisis. He thought that the greatest fault that the Government had committed-and here he spoke of the Governinent of India rather than of Her Majesty's Ministers in this country-he thought that the greatest error that the Government had committed had been in underrating the magnitudo of the rebellion, and in speaking of it as only a military mutiny and a passing outbreak which would speedily be subdued. (Hear, hear.) They might depend on it this was not a mere passing military mutiny. He believed that, instead of it being a mere military mutiny, it was a deeply orgamized, lovg-matured conspiracy, with the object of extermimating the English from India. (Hear, hear.) In this aspect they ought to view it, and in viewing it in this aspect was our greatest safety. His advice to the country was, don't let us under. rate the danger, but let us meet it in the spirit of Englishmen determined to subdule it. (Cheers.) He wished to be clear from any misunderstanding as to the opinions which he entertained on this subject. Let it not be supposed that in using this language he felt anything like an approach to despondency or despair. Oni the contrary, he would say, and with sincerity, that the view which he took of the state of affairs-gloomy and auxiousas hc admitted It to be-was a sanguine feeling of ultimate success. There was one fact which they would all have observed in connexion with this rebellion. He thought it was clear to demonstration that the relative superiority, maii to man, of the European over the Hindoo was now as great as it was when the great Clive won the battle of Plassey. It was extraordinary that it should be so when they considered that the soldiers that they (theEnropeans) had now tocontend with were the soldiers whom they had trained sip themselves. But it was the fact that the superiority of the European over the Hindoo was as great now as ever it was; and wben the reinforcements from England should have landed in India and marched to the assistance of our aruiy there he sangaRinely hoped that the authority of the Qaeen of England would soon be reestablished. (Hear, hear.) There was another fact on which he grounded a strong bope, and he formed it on a private letter received a few days since from the Governor of Ceylon, who said we had great reason to be thankful that the matter was not worse than it is. The Governor of Ceylon wrote that we in England had hardly yet a full conce rtion of the danger which we had escaped(A Voice, " 'b oh !")-for that India bad been saved by the premature outbreak at Meerutt. In another fortnight, had not that ont'reak taken place, there would have been a simultaneous massacre of all the Europeans in In4ia (sensation); and his correspondent used this reniarkable expression, that "he verlly believed there would not have been an European left to tell the tale." WVe had been saved that danger by the prcmature outbreak at Meerut. This, then, he would say was the time for Englishmen to prove their loyalty, and at all events to support the Throne ; and, this done, he believed the iriumphant result wvould be to reestablish our dominion in India. lle would add that he fully corcurred in the sentiments expressed hy the hon. chairman in proposing the toast of "x the Army and Navy." Justice must he vindicated, crime must be punished, the power of England must be asserted, and the horrible deeds committed must be treated as they deserved. English feeling would demand that, andit ought to t.e done, but let it be done in no vindictive spirit. Let jitstice be tempered with mercy. It might be perhaps not an accepsable sentinent to them, but it was a sentiment deep in his helrt, and when they came to deal with the mattet after the victory should have been gained let them bear in mind th.t our own hands are not clean. (Hear, hear.) India had i2ot been governed as it ought. (Hear, hear.) It was only yesiuerday that he had submitted to the astonished eyes of a large party in a countryhouse official proof that in collecting the .revenues in India there had been practised in the name of England-he would not say by the authority, ,but te f@cge not Fithout the knowledge of Englishmen-there had been practised tortures little less horrible than those wtich we now deplored. This must be borne in mind In tie day of reckoning, and in dealing with this question let them bear in mlind these two great cardinal objects,-first, that as a great nation we must reestablish the authority of the Sovereign In India- and secondly, that when that authority is reestablished. India must be better governed. (" Hear, hear," and cheers.) We must take care that our past errors are corrected, and our great mission so fulfilled that we may not only reap the benefit in the government of that great empire, but so do it as to promote the happiness, the welfare, and the ultimate civilization of that vast poition of the human race entrusted to our care. (Prolong:ed cheering.) Other toasts followed, and the party broke up at about 9 o'clock.
RAILWAY INTELLIGENCB. BR.ADFORD. WAKEFIETL. ANn T.F.RnR The directors and their friends passed over this line on Saturday, and It will be opened to the public to-day. It is 10 miles loDg and unites the three towns from which it takes its name, by junctions wi' e tho Leeds, Bradford, and Hlalifax line at Leeds and Aid-ley, and with the Lancashire and Yorkshire line at Wakefield. It will accommodate an extensive coal district, and is the shortest line between Leeds, Bradford. and Wakefaeld. It affords the most direct rouate between the two former places and London, rid the GreatNorthern, and arrangements have been made with that company and with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Cominpny for 999 years for working the line. The directors dined together at Wakefield, and the usual toasts were drunk and responded to. IRISH SOUTR-EASTERBN. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Wednesday in Dublin; Mr. J. E. Redmond in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in 2cc Times, was taken as read. The CHAIRMAN said that, as the arrangement between that company and the Great Southern and Western Railway Company was for a fixed amount, It was satisfactory to say that there was no necessity for his troubling thom with many remarks. Their recelpts were fixed, and they had only a control over the expenditure for maintaining the line, which was in exceUent order. He was happy to be able to recommnend them a dividend at the rate of rather more than 35 per cent, per annumn, leaving a surplus for the next account. Sir J. DomRstaTN moved the adoption of the report, which was seconded by Mr. ALE-:NDER, M-P., and carried unanimously. On the motion of Mr. R. WARREN, a dividend for the half-year of 4s. 3d. per share was declared, payable on the 15th of October. A conversation ensued in respect of the conveyaace of the mails on the line and to other places, in the course of which it was stated that the company had only 4d. a-mile for the conveyance of the day mails, which was not equal to the expense of a single horse and car. Mr. [lAUGTOrNo stated that for the last 12 months the railway companies in Ireland having the carriage of the i mails had not received a single shilling from the Post-ofice. A sum of 40,000l. was duo to the Great Southern and Western Railway Company by tbe Post-office for the carriage of mails, but they were unable to ge' a shilling of the jmoney, because the Post-office would not agree to the appointment of an umpire in the arbitration wvho was not of their own selection. The meeting then separated. WATERPORD AND TRAMORE, The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Tuesday in Dublin, Sir J. Dombrain in the chair. The secretary read the report, which stated that the traffic for the half-year ending the 30th of June last amounted for 29,252 passengers to 1,4091. against 27,869 passengers and 1,2321. for the corresponding period of last year, showing an increase of 1,383 passengers and 1771. The receipts for goods and parcels amounted to 1581., and at the corresponding period of last year to 1211., showing an in. crease of 361. The total receipts amoinsted to 1,5671., and i the total increase to 2141. The working expenses have been 'kept on as low a scale as was found consistent with efficiency. The Act of last session authorized the company I to issue preference shares for 10,0001., and thus to obtain the additional capital necessary for the payment of the debts of the company. The directors recommended that the preference lnterest be at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, andthey hope by the operation of the A\ct that adequate soiling stock will be provided to meet the requirements of |the traffic. The six: months' traffic to the 30th of June has nore than cleared the ordinary working expenses for the same period, but, being chargeable with interest on loans, shows a balance against revenue of 42-31. On the motion of the CiLURmAx the report was adopted. The meeting was then made special to authorize the _ aicng of additional eapital. a The CHAiRmN stated that if they succeeded in getting out the proposed shares they would be enabled to reduce the interest they had to pay from Sp per cent. to 5 per cent., being a reduction in amount of 444., and he hoped they would be able to prevail on those to whom they were indebted to take a considerable portion of the preference shares in payment of their claims. Re concluded by moving a formal resolution, authorizing the directors to issue guaranteed preferential shares to the amount of 10,000?. Mr. WA ucN seconded the motion, and it was carried unanimously. On the motion of Mr. GALWZY it was agreed that the preference shares should bear a perpetual guaranteed interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman. DEESIDE EXTENSION. The first turf of the Deeside Extension Railway was cut on Friday by the Marchioness of Huntly, at Rose-hill, near Aboyne. There was a large concourse of spectators present. Mr. JoHN DuNcAN, chairman of the Deeside line, and chief promoter of the extension, introduced the business of the t day,and spoke in very hopeful terms of the prospects of Th eMarchioness of Huntly, assisted by Mr. Willet, engineer of the line, then cut the first turf, and the Earl of Aboyne roiled it away amid the cheers of the oompany. The Marquis of Ht.NTLY congratulated the spectators on the success which had attended the railway enterprise on Deeside. At one time he was rather opposed to railways when they passed through gentlemen's estates, and because they knocked up coaches and horses, of which he was very fond; but now he felt that they were of great public utility, and therefore he was prepared to give them every assistance in his pow er. (Chceers.) A large party dlned together in a marquee at Aboyne in honour of the occasion, and Mr. Duncan stated that the best half of the line being contracted for and already in progress he had no hestation in promising that the whole undertak;ing wvould be finished in 18 months. MIURRAYSHIRE EXTENSION. The first turf of the Murrayshire Extension Railway, from Orton to Cralgellachie, was cut last week at Rothes, near Elgin, by Mrs. Grant, of Glen Grant. There was a large assembly of spectators. This will form the most direct extension to the highlands of the North which has yet baen proposod. GEELONG AND MELBOURNE. This line, from Geelong to Williamstown, a distance of 39 riles, was opened for public traffic by his Excellency the Governor on the 25th of June. A special train of 10 carriages started from Geelong at half-past 10 a.m., conveying his Excellency the Governor, the members of both Houses of Parliament, the corporations of Geelong and Melbourne, the directz-i, shareholders, and officers of the company. The train arrived at Williamstovn at 10 minutes past 12, having performed the journey in one hour and 40 minutes. A fatal accident occurred on the journey to Mir. H. 'Walters, the locomotive superintendent of the line, in consequence of standing on theontaide ledge of the engine and his head bavig ben brought violently in contact with a timber upright. The return journey from Williamatown was performed in one hour and 40 minutes. At 20 minutes past 2 the company proceeded to the banqueting.hall prepared for the occasion in one of the company s passenger sheds. Mr. C. N. Thorne, the chairman of the company, pr ed. Various toasts were given and responded to, and the day was observed in Geelong as a general holyday The trains run three times a-day each way, and it is stated that the traffic is satisfactory. Shortly after the opening day one of the guards collecting tickets while the tram was in motion fell between two carriages, in the act of springing from one footboard to another, and was killed. UntU the completion of the Government line from the junction at Willamstown to Melbourne, now in course of construction, I the remainder of the journey from the former to the latter place will be performed by steamers.

It appeared that the governors were not un-nmIig to place it at the disposal of the city unious, and as the hospital wards were at the present time actually untenanted, the house of occupation at Bethlehem and Holloway prison fi:Hline every requirement, it does seem only just that Briewvell, in accordance with the grant of Edward VI., In June, 155S, should revert to the maintenance of poor and impotent people, snob as the casual poor of the city of London.
A USTRAIArAM POSTAL COMifUA7 T C AIOX. (From the Mfining Jouris) TheGovernmentof VitoriahasgivennoeetothatofSotuth Australia that, in consequence of the latter having declined to pay her proportion of the eubsidy for postal communica. tions between the mother country and the Australian colo. nies, her mails wl not be sent home by the overland route. This refusal on the part of South Australia arises from the fact that the steamer passe" harbours on her own coast on Its way to Melbourne, and the bags, therefore have to be returned to her port by local teaulers. The attention of i the home Government has been called to this unsatisfaetory state of things, and we find that the Post-office authorities in London eontemplate a slight modification of the existing postal route, so as to ad'ust the differences and to remove the dissatisfaction of the South Australians. A dtrect postal communication with South Australia, without any material diversion of the exdsting course of the steamers between Suez and Melbourne, is the great desideratutm of the colony and can be effected with facility by the steamer delivering the bags for Adelaide, &c., at Nepean Bay, Backstaira Passage, which is within a few hours' sail of hir own port. It is accessible in all weathers, and affords ev ry accommoda. tion for vessels of the largest tonnage. We believe that the adoption of this suggestion is the moelification under discussion by the home Goverament. Considerable advantage would acrue to all the Auatralian colonies by making Nepan Bay the first and last place of call to and from Saez, anD rould put an end to all existing causes of complaint; for, by simply laying down a submarine telegraph from this bay to Cape Jervis, and thence ,Aross the country to Goolwa, a total distance of only about iO miles, there to join the wires between Adelaide and Melooarne, direct telegraphic intercourse would be established bebween Nepean Bay Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, and the various princip towns and ports in the three colonies, as the lines are being laid down to connect them. By this simple andinexpensive arrangement the arrival of the mail from Suez would be simultaneously made known in all the colonies, and the heads of the general news be thug anticipated two clear days at Mel. bourne, five days at Sydney, and five days at Adelaide before the delivery of the bags according to Dresent arrangements; while on the return voyage, by calling at Nepean By for the South Australian mail, telegraphic intelligence fromes ih of the provinces would be simultaneously received to concurrent dates for transmission to Europe, so that the advices in England would always be to the same day from each of these important colonies of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. The time thus gained by each province would be considerable, while this notice at Melbourne of the arrival of the mail at Nepean Bay from Suez would give ample time for the local steamers to be made ready for the prompt transmission of the bags, either from Iobson's Bay or Queensdliff, for Sydney, New Zealand, Tasmania, and the other provinces of Australasia.
