NORTHERN CIRCIJT. YO:Ex, MONDA.Y, DEC. 14. (Before Mfr. J.Tstice WILms.) THE HULL TOELGERY CASM Henry Smith Bright was indicted for forging on the 4th of July, 1853, at Hull, a deed of transfer, purporting to be signed by Robert John Taylor, ot certain iraUlway shares in the York, Newcastle, and Berwick Railway Company, with intent to defrand. lio was further charged with uttering the same deed knowing it to be forged. Mr. Overend, Q.C., Mr. Dearsley, and Mr. Maule ap. peared for the prosecution; and Mr. Edwin James, Q.p, (specially zetained), and Mr. Price for the defence. The prisoner, an exceedingly intelligent and respectable looking man, appeared at the bar with his arm in a sling, baving met with some accident. Throughout the trial he took an active interest in what was going on, and wrote many notes to his counseL Mr. OVERE1D, In stating the case, said that the prosocn. tor is the son of a gentleman named John Taylor, who formerly was an extensive corn merchan' at Hull, and who died in June, 1856, without a will, and his son (the prosecutor) then took out administration of the effects of his father, and the present charge arose out of the investigation of the affairs of his father which took place. The prisoner, Henry Smith Bright, was the nephew of the same Mr. John Taylor, and bore a character of the highest possible kind. There was no man in the town of Hull who, either in business knowledge or in intelligent quickness of apprehension of the details of business, or as a religious man, occupied a higher position than Mr. Bright, and therefore If the case was left in the slightest degree of doubt he hoped the jury would give him the benefit of that character which he had enjoyed up to the period of the present charge. The prisoner was not only engaged in this large concern of Mr. Taylor's, but he was connected with various large institutions In Hull, and was the president of a large commercia establishment known as the "Hull Flax-mill Company." The charge the prosecution mnade against the prisoner was that he, on the 4th of July, 1853, had forged the name of Robert John Taylor to a transfer of stock, and by means of that forgery had sold 48 extension shares of the York, Newcastle, and Berwick RailwayCompany, and appropriated the money to his own use. The late Mr. Taylor carried on basiness as a corn merchant with a Mr. Clifford. In 1828 the prisoner was taken into tho concern as clerk, and in 1840 was ad. miuted as a partner. The fLrm was then Taylor, Clifford, and Bright. In 1844 Mr. Cliford retired, and in 1845 the firm was " Taylor and Bright" only, and they carried on the bumanesstogether until Januaiy, 1856, when Mr. John Taylor died. After that the name of the firm was continued, but the business was carried on by Mr. Bright for his owrn sole benefit tiU September, 1857, when he became bankrupt. The late Mr. Taylor was not an educated man, but knew his bnsiness and managed the sales. The prisoner was s man of education, and had the general superintendence of the books and managed the correspondence. The accounts were kept in three different kinds of ledgers, one a general ledger, which contained the various accounts with the names of the parties. The second ledger was called the passive ledger, and contained the general accounts andan account of stock, without the names of persons; and there was a private ledger which had an account of the profit and loss sustained by each partner. They had cashbooks, and a journal as well. In the private ledger the capital of each partner in the conerm was entered. Taylor had 40,0001. entered as capital- Bright brought nothing into the concern. Each year a ivislon of pofits was made and entered in this pri. vate ledger. In 184, the last year of the partnership of Taylor, Clifford, and Bright, an entry was rnade in the pri. vate ledger of the railway share account of each partner. It appeared that each had speculated a good deaL At the end of 1844 it turned out that MIr. Bright, so far from heing successful in his speculations, had lost 3301. This loss Mr. Taylor took on himself, and kindly allowed the sam to be transferred into the general account, and to be treated as a loss to be deducted from the capital account. The private ledger was kept on till 1847, at which time Taylor's capital appeared by it to be 27,0001., and Bright's 3,0001. From that time the private ledger ceased. In 1853 Mr. Taylor's interest in the concern was about 35,0001., and Mr. Bright then owed the concern 11,0001. In 1855 that loss was reduced to a little under 10,0001. All the transactions which took place and alltheaccountswerekeptunder thesupervision of Mr. Bright. On the 30th of May it would appear that 238 York, Newcastle, and Berwick extension shares were owned by the concern, and were valu ed at 3,3131. 17s. 6d.; 149 of them stood In the name of John Taylor, 36 in the name of the prisoner, and 58 in the name of Robert John Taylor. The shares were invested in these different names in order that one or other of the holders might always he able to attend the meetings of shareholders and to vote at them; but Robert John Taylor was ne partner; he was simply cashier to the coneern, and had no substantial interest in it, and these shares were merely invested in his name. The prosecution said that of these 58 shares so standing in the name of Robert John Taylor, Mr. Bright had forged his name for the transfer of 48 of them on the 4th of July, 1853. The first question was, had the prisoner the authority of MIr. Robert John Taylor to sign his name, and it might be suggested that the deceased partner, -Mr. John Taylor, had given such authority, but no such anthority could be given. It required a power of attorney by dead under seal to give any such authority. The transfer deed purported to be signed by Robert John Taylor, and to be witnessed by Mr. Bright, and did not purport to be signed " per procuration," or by Robert John Taylor's authority. The money obtained by the sale of this stock the prisoner had appropriated, not to the partnership con. oern, but to his own private purposes; and the deed so forged he had uttered. These snares stood in the books from 1849 to 1853, and atthe time ot the transfer they stood In the books as partnership property; and if thelate Mr. Join Taylorhad given his assent tohe sale It would be thought that, at all events,some accounat of the transfer would appear in the books;-but although every search had been made in I thebookscn papers of the cencern, nothing of the kind could h fouad, It would b3e supposed, also, tha bataf the sale of these shares they would cease to stand in the books as the property of the concern; but, on the contrary, these shares stood iu the books as the property of the partnership from the time of the sale in 1853 until 1855, when Mr. Taylor died, and they were acconnted for to Mr. Robert Jobn Taylor, as the administrator of his father, as though still unsold. The money for which these sbares had been sold, 1,000, had been applied, 500o. to pay a gentleman named Buchanan, at Liverpooi, with whom the prisoner had been speculating In cotton, and on which account it became necessary to deposit 5001.; and the remaining sum of 5004, bad been sent to Messrs. Alexander Mimle and Co, of Glasgow, in payment of a corn speculation. It would be shown that this firnn had been dealing independently with the prisoner in the course of one year to the amount of upwards of 100,000& ; and the prisoner's correspondence with that firm showed great anxiety that no intimation that he was dealing separately with them should he given to his partner, for he wrote to them repeatedly in the counrse of thiese transactions to advise with him, and not to "1advise Taylor and Bright." On the part of the prosecoution it was said that the prisoner was attempting to raise and use the money in this way for his own private purposes. In addition to this evdence, it would appear that every year the firm had a stock-taking, and they took stock not only of their corn in hand, but also of their railway property, which was valued at the price of the day, and every year this railway stock which had been sold by Mr. Bright was so valued and brought under hIr. Bright's notice, he putting the price of the day in pencil opposite to the stocke It would naturally be asked, how were the dividends of this stock which was sold paid, as the persons who bought it would be entitled to the dividends ? Some of these shares had been trAnsferred to the Rev. Edward Law. son, andI Mr. Lawson would be entitled to the dividends. He would proceed to explain how that was done. Not only were these 48 shares sol , but the whole of the remainder of the 238 shares, except 18, and all theee were kept in tho books as unsold. It appeared that MIr. Bright was a very active man, and was always first at his of*ce of business, and saw the letters before the otber partners and answered tbem- and it would appear that, in order to conceal the sale ot this stock, he had paid the dividends himself from 8D up to the death of Mr. Taylor. These dividends were paid by warrants, and the warrants were still sent for the 18 shares-10 and 8-to Mr. John Taylor and to Mr. Robert John Taylor, and the prisoner had got the money and aigned the receipts, forging their signatures, and to satisfy them he told them that he had made an arrangement with the company topay the dividends by bank post bilLq, as they were more conveniene in mercantile transactions than dividend warrants and In this way he had shown his partner and the pro. secutor bank post bills for 941L 16s., 1164, 1261. S., and other sums as the dividends became due, which he paid ovpr to te proseoutor as the cashier of the partnership. On the dcathofr. Taylor theprnsonerowedthe concern nearlO000. Mr. Taylor left no will, and it was suggested to his son by Mr, Bright, that he should enter into the concern as a partner. This was, however, declined, and it became necessary to ascertain in what condition the firm ws, and how the funds were invested. As explanatory of the prisoner's position he would now read a letter which had been foundin his private papers, which was written in 1854, when he was very ill. (Copy.)

Taylor the prisoner went to Mrx.

This arrangement was carried out in the private ledger from the time it had ceased to be kept in 1847, and it now appeared regularly eatered as though all the railway share losses had been taken by Mr. Taylor hiraself; and although the general ledger showed that the prisoner owed the concern near 10,000&, by the acowunt thus made out it was made to appear that he owed the econern nothing, and thait the concern, on the contrary, was just 1001, in his debt. On being after this appffed to by young Mr. Taylor to settle the [account he referred him to this private ledgeir, na evidencing that he had nothing to do with the railway share account, hut that this was Mr. Taylor's onily, although in the general ledger he appeard to be a partner in these shares, and to have lost 10,OOO1, This was given in evidence as showing an Intention to defraud. He thent urged on young Mr. Taylor to settle matters, and they entered into an agreement, under which Mr. Bright agreed to pay a certain sam, 8,5001., and to take the shares andE other assets of the Dartnership at a valuation, and they were valued to him at i7,5001, He htad thus agreed to purchase the sold shares whicbheh had himself sold, standig neminall1y in the partnership books,.so afraid was he lest the true nature of the transaction should apea.tnesdiwscoverng caldwhatphadubeendonwtthhe pri-an thtagereeet Thi wasfx fo the caseoy fortheBpnroeuption anditwa fornCehre the urtoSaycwethery ftheNretcouldterany doubtltattheany priodnehaforgd thevrose transfers owithou the okpnowledgeof n his parter. oet onTylrn paper of the firme frJomhex custor,adynofeinthepBasnkruptc nmr.

The prisoner had never had ;n opportunity of explaining these accounts. In 1845, when the railway speculations began, they had involved an amount of 159,1534.; for this amount there were above 1,000 operations These were chiefly arranged by Mr. Bright, The books showed a gain to the firm in 1845 of 15,3111. by these operations. In 1846 there was a loss on railway shares of 5,143l. In 1847 there was a loss of 14,7061.; in 1848 there was a loss of 12,2701t, and in 1849 a loss of 22,1161. The profit and loss war earried to the account of each partner, treating them as out of the partnership. He was not aware that the partnership was in the habit of pledging certificates for loans. They speculated in otber things-in corn, in oil, and in hope in 1847 and 1848. He did not know of a depogit of railway certificates with Lawrence, Cazenove, and Co. for an advance of 9,0001. There was no entry In the books of any such transaction. No copies were kept of the correspondence. The accounts with Messrs. Alexander, Milne, and Co., of Glasgow, fromn l851 to 1855 amoumted to 160,0004 These were mercantile transactions, and not specultions. Buchanan's ccount of Liverpool, began in I4, and at the end of November, 1856, it covered about 30,0001. There were bond fide trans. actions-purchases of oil. Mr. Taylor and his son and the prisoner occupied one offloe. The prisoner was very attentive and sedulous in the business-the others were not. Mr. Bright was also chairman of the Hall Flax Mills Company, and was mach absorbed in business, and managed the uniary arrangements of the firm. He was not aware t.he was frequently pressed for money, nor of the emergencies under w 'oh the firm laboured. He did not know that in on year they had 10,000l. to pay in railway oxls Mr. Bright di not live expensively. He was to take one: third of the profits and suSier one-third of the losses, Robert John Taylor, exau1ned,-He resided at Harrow Weald, in Middlesex, and was theon of the late Mr. John Tayor. In 1846 he entered' the concern of his father as junLor clerk, andl became cashier in 1850, His father managed the produce sales, and MIr. Bright attended to the fintacial department and the hooks, Tho witness proved having received bank post bils for the railway dividends from the prisoner, which were represented by him as belng more convenient than dividend warrants in commercial accounts. The witness then proved the facts opened by the learned counsel for the prosecUtion. The receinta to the dividend warrants for the 18 shares were not sigied by him or by his father. The dgnatures were forgeries. The signature of the transfer deed of 48 shares to the Rev. George Lawson, which purported to be his, was a forgery. He haa given no authonty to the prisoner for the signing of hi5 name. He had been shown the private ledger by the prisoner, and the account puzzled him. He had subsequently entered into an agreement to receive 8,500L. in money and 17,5001. in bills for the a*sets of the firm belonging to hls latber. Cross-examined.-In 1851 the prisoner was sent up to London to purchase railway shares, with authority to endeavour to retrieve the losses of the firm, and he was to go and advise with Mr. Uudson, and embark in railway speculations on his own judgment. So far as he knew, the firm was solvent in 1856. Be had no idea that the firm then owed Messrs. Harrison and Watson, the bankers of Hull, 25,0001. The prisoner had paid him since, on account of his father, 8,5001. Mr. George S. Brodcrick, stockbroker, of 53, Threadneedle-street, London, proved selling the shares in question for Mr. Bright. He was cross-examined at congiderable length to show that the transfer deed had been signed in blank, with a view to a possible technical objection to the form of the indict3nent, and that appeared to have been the case. Mr. John Flowers, his clerk, corroborated this evideuce. It was also proved that the letters read by the learned counsel for r t hprsuon were found in the prisoners papers by the oflclal assignee. Aind it wras also proved that n 1.5001 had been rent to dessrs. Buchanan, of ibverpool, by the prisoner, and 5001. to Messre. Atexander Mlimeo and Co., of Glasgow, which together made up the sum wor which the 48 shares were sold in July, 1853. This was the case for the prosecution. Mr. JAMS then proceeded to adidress the jury on behalf of the prisoner. He said all who had heard this ease would be very much struck by the peculiar circumstances under which it had been brought before their attention. They had the case of a gentleman admitted to be of the highest character and integrity, who had embarked largely in busnesw, and who had fanen in the avalanche of ruin which had overtaken other parties as well as himself in Hull, and who, instead of being examined in the Bankruptey Court, where he could give an account of these varied transactions, had been seized in a moment by those who represented the Crown when he was preparng to render a full account in the Bankruptcy Court, and a criminal prosecution had been instituted gainst him. Wbile confined in a gaol he had been called upon to give an account of all these enormous pecuniary transactions, they having by their conduct rendered it impossible for him to do Eo satisfactorily. The learned counsel then contended that the whole of these share transactions were desilngs with tnership property, and that the prisoner had the implied authoritv of his partner for doing what he had done. Mr. Taylor was dead, and the secret rested with him in his grave whether he was not cognianct of every transaction. It was impossible for Mr. Br7ght to prove it. But one partner had as much right as the other to enter into transactions with the partnership funds. The evidence, so far from fixing guilt upon him, contained the most irrestible proof of his innooence. In 1845 the firm was engaged in railway speculations alone to the amount of 159,ODO0., and in above 1,000 transactions, and the prisoner had the sole management of these enormous speculations. He waa required at a moment sometimes to supply 8,0001. or 10 00l0 and he had been drawn into all this gambling and into thig loss of 25,0001. or 30,0001. by Mr. Taylor, and had this to manage in addition to his other business, until the firm at last had been drawn into the most serious difficulties. The learned counsel then drewv attention to the letters which had been read. He would not remark on the good taste of reading the letter marked "most private;" but for the sake of the prisoner he rejoiced that it bad been put in. Be contended that both these letters gave a true and faithfal account of the prisoner's transactions. He owed 10,0001. to the concern. He had since paid 8,5001. of it to the prosecutor, aud had agreed to pay 17,5001. for the assets of the firm, which he contended was In an insolvent condition, and but for his agreeing to do this young Mr. Taylor would have got nothing. With regard to the transactions withAlexander,3i1ne, and Co., of Glasgow, in the prisoner's own name, it was clear that Bright gave order^, and sold to Taylor and Bright, in order to get two sets of bills Into the market, and to endeavour with this fictitious capial to prop up the concern. The prisoner had gained no 9g, as stated in his letter, written wh en he thought he was dying - he had nothing to leave his wife and child but his empty biessing. Be had been at one time worth 10,0001., and could have retired, but Mr. Taylor, urged on by avarice, would go on. There was something startling in the name of forgery in a commercial comamunity; but this was the first case he could recollect of a forgery of partnership property by one partner as against another. In the agreement these shares were recited to belong to the firm, and to be part. nership property; but It was sad that, though dealing with partnershipproperty, the prisoner had applied it to his own use. o prosecution was bound to sbow that the prisoner had no authority from the late Mr. Taylor to do what he had done. As to Robert John Taylor, he was a more tool, be had no Interest in the shares which stood in his name, and there was no attempt to defraud him. In 1853 the amount turned over by the firm was upwards of 1,250,0001.; the prisoner was the financial manager,with power to sgn bills and to make the requisite moneyarrangements. The difficulties of the firm were kept concealed from the clerks, and it was too much to suppose that when money was urgently required for the transactions of the firm which e had to manage he had not the wer to sign these certificates, or that, kept as they were an iron safe in the room common to him and his partner, his partner did not know what certificates they had. The prisoner had not lived extravagantly; he had devoted his timae and energies and abilities to the business of the firm; he had benefited himself nothing by any of these transaotfons, and he appealed not to their sympathy, but to their sense of justlice in the verdict that they'would give. It being now 6 o'clockr, his LOBDS1TTP said the case was of too much importance for the jUTy to give proper attention to the summing up at that hour, and he should therefore ad3ourn the summing up titll to-morrovw morning. The Court then adjourned. TUESDAY. (Beforc Mr. Justice WILLIAMS.) Henry Smith Bright as rn put at the her this morning, at9 o'clock, and the tral of the charge against him of forging, and uttering knowing to be forged, a deed of transfer of railway shares with intent to defraud, was Immediately proceeded with. His LOnDSHrr immediately on taking his seat proceeded to sum up the evidence to the jury. He said the great and only question in this case was whether the deed was in truth a forgery, and, if it were a forgery, then did the prlsoner utter it with a guilty knowledge that it was a forgery ? The deed in question purported to be eiped by Robert Johnx Taylor, and It certainly was a peculiarity in this case that, although they might come to the conclusion that the deed was not executed by Robert John Taylor, or with his assent, yet it by no means followed that it was a forgerv, because Eobert JohnxTaylor was only the nominee and agent of the prisoner, Mr. Bright, and his partner, Mr. Tavlor Robert John Taylor having no interest in and being merel; a clerk In the honse, and the shares were invested in hfs name for convonience only. The consequence of that state of things was this, that If the prisoner honestly put the name of Robert John Taylor to the deea, bond flde intending to sell the property for partnership purposes, it would not be a forgery, notwithstanding Robert John Ta lr did not put or cause to be put his name to the deed. Indeed, the eloquent counsel for the prisoner had gone BO far as to say that being joint partnership property the prisoner had the right to dispose of the shares, but it was his(lordship's duty to tell them that was not so. A partner had the right to put the name of the firm to a docunmentastoa bill of ezehangeoranylastrusnent; andnotwithstandng he did that for his own and not for partnershp, purposes, yetiwasnofor r; itwasonly a fraudulent abuse of the authority withwhic the lawinvested him sea partner. But this was obviously not using the name of the firm, but writing the name of a stranger, Robert John Taylor; and they mugt take the law from bmn that if the prisoner wrote the name of Robert John Taylor In fraud of the aprtnership and withont the knowledge of his partner, and with the fraudulent intent of appropriating the proceeds to his own purposes, and not to the purposes of the partnership, then he Ws gilty of the crime with which he was charged. HMs lordsrtp then proceeded to sum up the evidence in deta}l. The jury retired at a llttle before 11 o'clock, and after an absence of 20 minutes, returned with a verdict of Guilty of forgery, and of uttering the same with intent to defraud. Mr. OvzRntiD said, there were several other cases of the same character, but he did not think he could carry the charge further than this, and with his lordship's sanction he d d not propose to go on. llfr. JA said, the charges as to the bills of exchange were very peculir. His LoxnsEnu said he was bound to say that he could not understa4d the case as to the bills of exchange after reading the deposztions. Mr. OvERN s aaid, on the p art of the prosecution, they did not wish the bills of exchange case to be taken into account at alin the punishment. The prisoner was then called on if he had anything to say why judgment should not pass upon him.. The prisoner, in a firm, clear manner, said,-t My Lord, may I be allowed to say that I have no fault to find with the way In which this prosecution has been conducted, and I thank the jury for the patient attention they have paid to the case. What I now say is with tho full conviction that the crime of which I have been convicted was a few years ago punishable with death; but what I wish to say i that the whole of the trwnsactions connected with my firm oarried on, as a speculativ account in my own name, were so carried on for the sole purpose of retrieving the position into which tho firm had got by ralway engagements in 1846 ; that the principle Of those spculations was known to my partner. and that it was with his knoledge and his privty entirely that we entered on these speculations; that they wre intrusted eRtirely to my management, and were kept from the knowledge of his son, because it s notorious that his son wa not a man of business and they were kept from the knowledge of the clerks beauso their knowledgo would have been ruin to the firs. My lord, the jury have found me gulty and I submit to the punishment which your lordship may ad, Elis LouDsmP then proceeded topas sentence. He aid, I entirely concur with theverdict of the jury, and therefore I need not say I do not bolieve wbhat you say just now. Neverthelees, I have compassion for you-a man fallen from the highly resbectablo station in which you stood. you say trulv tnat a ew" years ago your crime would have been expbiaed on a puhlo ca[ffold; and, though I have compion on you, I should do wrong if I did not pass a sen. eon on commensurate wth your crime, which is one oE2rcat enorulity. The sentene of the Court is that yen be lept in penal servitude 10 years. The prisoner was then removed after acquittals had been takon in eight other indictments against him.

TEiE LEYIA TRAy. More than a week has elapsed since the last efforts were made to move this vessel. As our readers may remember, the efforts were discontinued in consequence of the great diffculty experienced in obtaining anything like secure holdfasts for the river moorings. Partly owing to the immense strain, and partly because of the peculiarly dense nature of the river bed, which prevented the anchors penetrating more than a foot or so in depth, it was quite impossible to make any effective use of this river tackle, which at the present stage of the launch has become absolutely esEential to its further progress. In order, therefore, that a proper hold may be obtained a regular series of large piles has been driven on the opposite bank of the river, one on the wharf of Messrs. Humphry's yard, and the second a little below high water-mark,between the water-gate Ferry and Deptford Dockyard. Each of these clumps of piling are almost similar in strength and arrangement to the piles which serve as a basis for the hydraulic rams in the yard itself, and like them, too, they have not been resorted to tiU the eleventh hour, and in fact until the failure of all other methods has literally forced their adoption upon the engineers. Both these were completed early yesterday morning, and the chains and anchors holding back the moorings by which the Leviathan is dragged with a double purchase towards the river were secured among them. There seems not the least doubt now but that these piles will hold the anchors fast enough, but it is by no means so clear that the launch will be by any means expedited. Under the previous arrangement, in which ordinary anchors were used to hold the moorings, the chains were always breaking, even when the anchors themselves were yielding and coming in foot by foot. What chains will stand now that the anchors are secured and cannot yield an inch ? It was expected that all the arrangements would be completed yesterday in time to make another effort to move the vessel early in the morning. Unfortunately it was impossible to complete the details of the preparations till nearly dark yesterday, when a brief attempt was made more as it was asserted for the purpose of trying the tackle than with any serious intention of commencing operations at so late an hour. Be this as it may, however, a tremendous pressure and strain was kept up upon both fore and aft cradles for about 10 minutes without making the smallest impression upon the inert monster, though the force applied eventually become so great as to drive the feed pipe out of one of the hydraulic rams, and snap a river mooringehainof2j,inches. These mishaps being about equivalent to aday's work thepressurewasthentaken off again, leaving the launchiiig apparatus mainus the services of the ram and chain. Both these, however, can easily be repaired and ready for work this day, when it is positively asserted that the launching is to recommence for the fourth and last time.
COURT O COMMON aOUNCIL. Yesterday a special Court was held for the despatch of public business. The REMEMBnwCER informed the Court that Sir G. Grey had given notice in Parliament of his intention on the 4th of Febraary next to move for leave to bring in a BIU for the better regulation of the Corporation of London. (Hear, hear.) The communication was referred to the Corporation In. quiry Committee. r.WOOD brought up a reporb from the Corporation Inquiry Committee, recommending the Court to deposit a Bi in Parliament for the future regulation of the corpo ration, in conformity with the resolutions agreed to in February last. He moved that the BiU be now read. DePuty HOLr seconded the motion. Mir. A1mxBRTON moved the following amendment:- DThat Sir Lorge Grey having on Saturday lmet, gien notioe In the Hoese of commons that he shaloien Thuraday, the 4th ef pebtary, move fes leave to bring in a Bill for the better regulation of the Corporation of the city ef London, It will he a waste of ttme tonsceeito dThcBn w the drughi rea aiud pesroaby the CorporationInquiryCmmittee new before e Court, and that the ome be adjethed P oivrdinY Deputy LLOYD seonded the amendment.

CITY' COMMISSION OF SEWERS. Yesterday a Court, at which Mr. Deputy Christie presided, was held for the despatch of public business. TBE LATE EXPOSURE OF DEAD BODIES IN; MOOBRILDS 2B5UFAL GItOU1S. Mr. Daw, the chief clerk, read the following letter respecting the prosecuton ordered by the Lord Mayor to he iatituted again3t Mr. Piper, junior, and Mr. Young, juhnior, for disinterring, exposing, and removing dead bodies In the Roman. Catholi;c burisiground, Moorfielc's: s To Ima OLEXSX OF maI COImeSSIONEBB OF BE3Y1lS OF Il OErrz OF hOl-DON "S lr,-The Cenm.itsee ot Aldermen, to wbor; the comDplaint against Mr. Piper and Mr. Yourng wsreported tn the course ot busineess have rolved that It Is not a case which the U(tyt olidtor should be directed to prosecute. * The o sWPint hasving Originatod from tho officer of the Court ot Eewers lutrautel with the arnitary arrangeaeatte of the city. I think it righttoreport lt to you, that actiotn may, Sf to>nght neeseary, be taken " The wttnseaes have been bued over, and they will attend before the Grand Jury this day to sa3ve their rvecoguizauce I hase direted uent. I! tbe Coiurt 3of Sewvs, intend etoconduct the rosecution, I respectfully subhult that tt ouaht to he sent to their solaicior Los his previous approval. aeI Sir. Your obedient servant am OARLEd PEARSUR, City Solicitor." Mr. ABn A1M.-This is a very extraordinary prooeeding on thepart of theCommittee of Aldermen. Nearly a montni ago information was given to the Lord Mayor that proceedIngs were going on at this burialground that were not only injurious to the public health but also an outrage to all publio decency. The Lord Mayor, as I think, very properly ordered the City Solicitor to exammne into the matter and to summon before hinm the parties engaged in the transaction. This having been done the lord M1ayor, as I think with great 0ropriety, ordered proceedings to be taken against two in. dividuals. The City Solicitor has been conducting those proceedings for nearly a month. Yesterday the variois witnesses were summoned before the grand jury, and in the middle of the day we received a letter froma the City Solicitor, informing us that the Committee of Aldermen de. olined going on with the prosecution, because they thonght it the duty of the Court of Sewers to conduct it. Although all the witnesses are in attendanoe at the Central Criminal Court, and when the case may be called on at any moment, no professional man has been instroted to con. tinue the proceedings which the City Solicitor has been carryMig on under the orders of the magistrates of London (Hear, hear.) This is a very serious affair ; it is not a right course of proceeding on the part of gentlemen who order a public prosecution, and back out of it while the case is underinvestigation. I move:- - That this Court proceed to carry on the indictment ordered by the Lord Mayor against Messr Piper and Young. and that the Solicitor he instructed to proceed accordingly." Deputy HOLy, in seconding the motion, said he thought the Committee of Aldermen were quite right in with. drawing from the prosecution as soon as they found that the matter to which it related came under the cognizance of the Commissioners of Sewers. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Dz JERsEY said, It was rather late in the day for tihe Court of Aldermen to send the Commission a letter ol that description after a period when action ought to have beea taken. He hoped it was not too lateto take the prosecution up at the point where the Aldermen had left it, AIr. Ross said he considered It the duty of the com. mission to continue the prosecution. Deputy BowER said he was of opinion that the Commission would only be wasting money by continuing the prosecution, the more especially as he had been given to understand not only that the nuisance complained of had ceased, but that what had been done had been done in entire ignorance of the law. If the motion were carried, they would be prosecuting a gentleman who had only acted as agent, while the guilty would escape. He moved the previous question by way of amendment. Mr. AssBY seconded the amendment. Dr. LETEBny, the medical officer of health, said,-I beg to be permitted to ask the Court, who ure the custodisns of the public health, whether they will permit persons to open graveyards without any consultation whatever with them. (Hear, hear.) I do not apprehend the question has been considered at all as to whether these gentlemen have done wrong knowingly or unknowmgly, or that the matter ought to be sent for trial in order that a fine may be imposed upon them, bat sirmply for the purpose of trying a legal question as to whether the public graveyards of this or any other city can at any moment be turned up by anybody. There is nothing so seriously damaging to the publie health as interfering with a grave. yard. We have instances on record where pestilence has spread from the mere opening of a vault, and where grave. diggers have died from the action of a most virulent poison, and if you permit these things to be done in the city, and allow your functions thus to be set aside, I have no power to act as your sanitary officer.

LONDON AND EASTBBN BANKIN COvlfPANY. EDINBURGH, MONDAY AFTERNOON. Mr. Sheriff IILnLARD, according to adjournment, held a Court this morning at 10 o'clock for the purpose of pro. ceeding further with the examination of Mr. J. E. Stephens, the late manager of the London and Eastern Bank. Ar. Binny, the judiolal trustee, was present, with Mr. Youog and Mr. Webster, his counsel and agent, but no appearance was made either by or for the bankrupt. Mr. W3MSTR stated that he had received a letter from the bankrupt, dated on Saturday, bearing the postmark of Sunday, and recelved by him this morning, It intimated to him that he would not be present that morning, and that he desired an ad ournment of the proceedings, on the grounds, first, of his present ill health, and, second, of his desiring more ttme to examine the books and documents on which he had been questioned. He (Mr. Webster) had at 9 o'clock that morning written to the bankrupt intimating that his letter was unsatisfactory to him, and that unless he appeared before his Lordship at 10 o'clock it would be necessary for the trustee to ask a warrant for his apprehension. As the bankrupt had not appeared, and as no application had been made for adjournment and no cause shown why he had not appeared, he had now to present a potition on behalf of the trustee, praying his Lordship to grant a warrant for his.apprehension, and to detain him in custody for such period as may be necessary. The Sest.-The only thing in the letter that gives any reasonable ground for craving adjournment is his statement with regard to his health, but as he has not given the only legal evidence of it, a medical certificate, it cannot be admitted. Mr. WEBSTER said, he had seen the bankrupt on Friday when he caUed at hlis office, and so far as he could judge he appeared in perfectly good health. m answer to the HEH ITE, Mr. WEBSTER stated that he had had no communication from Mr. Wilkie, the bankrupt's agent. The SFmPr.-The bankrupt says he has instructed Mr. Wilkce to move for an adjournment. Mr. YoTnG.-Probably the better course is to leave the petition in your hands, that you may sign It at a later hour if he does not appear. The SHERr..-Suppose he was to produce a medical certificate that he cannot come; that would be enough? Mr. YOUNG.-Yes, quite. The S zstsra.-I think, in all the drcrumstances, there should be some little delay in granting the warrant. Mr. WLmsTsmt-If there were not some reason to fear that this is rather a mode of obtaining time to- The Simsne.-Satisfy yourself of that. The warrant can remain with me ti-what o'clock shall we ay ? Mr. YOUNG.-At what time would you be satisfied if there be no certificate, and if Mr. Wilkie does not come? The Sc=Bx F.-If you choose to take the responslbility of it you may have itnow. But perhaps it would be as well to adjourn the Court til 12? Mr. YouNG.-Yes; and it may be well to let the bankrupt's agent know that if any delay is to be asked appearance must be made. The SNFmFw.-A note will be sent stating that if appearance is not made at 12 o'clock the bankrupt incurs the danger of having this warrant granted. The Court was adjourned to 12 o'clock, when Mr. Wilide, agent for the bankrupt, appeared, as did ailso Mr. Binny and Mr. Webster. The bankrupt did not aipear. Mr. W =E expressed his regret at being unable to be present in the morning, not having returned from the countryin time. Be begged to crave adjournment of the proceedings for the reasons stated in the bankrupt's letter, which he desired should be entered on the record. Mr. WInSTEt-The letter is not limited to matters properly relating to the appllcation for delay, but oes into other details which ll come out in his examination upon oath, so that I do not think it would be proper that the letter should go on the record. MIr. Stephens, when he reappears, may make any explanation he thinks fit. The only statement in the letter which could relevantly be considered here is the plea of ill health. Now, I submit that this statement by the person himself is not sufficient, and ought to have been accompanied by a medical certi6cate. In these circumstances the trustee is entitled to a pply for a warrant. Of course, if the officer finds the bankrupt not able from il health to attend, he will not execute the warrant; but we have no reason to believe the statement of his ill health. The SEEs?uF.-The more regular way will be for Mr. Wilkie to move for adjournment in respect, first, of hts olient's IU health, and second, that he requires time to examine the books; but I do not see my way to admittlng the letter upon the reeord. Mr. WuLxE.-This seems to have been a very unusual examination, ard has opened up many matters on which the bankrupt was not prepared to answer, and he has been referred to many books and documents which he had almost never seen. The SHERiFF.-That answer was available to the bankrupt whenever the difficulty occurred, so he was under no hardship on that point. Mr. Wrx,sux.-There is no saying to what extent they may go on wi.ith this line of examination, and I think it is a reasonable request that he should have further time to prepare himself for sueh examination. I must make application to have that letter entered on the record. The SEERIFF.-I am afraid I can scarcely sustain this application to enter the letter. A copy of it was also sent to me, which was an irregularity. The Sheriff then gave judgmesit on the question of adjournment. He overruled both grounds of the bankrupt's application, and granted warrant as craved by the trustee. To his decision he appended the followving:t " ote.-The agent for the bank-rupt, Sn opposition to the above warrant, moved for a further adjournment of the proceedings on two grounds-first, his client's ill health;and, second, the necessity of giVing him further time to examine the books and docranents twith a vier to his examination. With regard to the first of these grounds, and consdering thatthebankrupt is in the hands of eompetent legal advisers, the Sheriff Substitute has considered himself bound to overrule the plea of il health, it not being instructed by medical certificate in common form. Of course, if such a certificate be presented to the offlcer executing the warrant, it wiiU be for the officer to report the matter to the SheriffSubstitute. With regard to the seoond plea for delay, it is sufficient to say that, if any question be put which the bankrupt finds he cannot answer, without a further examination of books and documents, it wilU be eompetent for him when such questions are put to call for such books and documents. Bntthe SheriffSabstitute wiU not anticipate that necessity before it arises." Mr. WilE gave notice that within the time prascribed by the statute an appeal would be presented against this deliverance. Appeal under the Act is taken to the Court of ession, but it does not necessarily taAy execation of such warrant. Accordingly the warrant was immediately signed by the Sheriff ana handed over to Mr. Webster, the applicant being the person to undertake the eost and risk of execution. The following Is the bankupt's letter to the trustee, which was handed to the press at the instance of Mr. Wilhe :_ " 24, Northumbtlaad-slreet, Edinburgh, Dec. 12. *lir,-l regret that my health having suffered greatly trom the long-ointinued and harassing examination to which I have been sfbjected I must se'k for an adiournment to some future day before oDnclnduin It. Such aadoumment Is not only oalled for by the state of my health. but I require It to enable meto make a careful unrey of the bank books. I was quite unprepared to go Into such an extended and minute Investigation of the bankes affairs, wIth which, as was reDeatedly urged, my estate has no concern. -It was unseasonable to expect that I should. on the Instant, account for tbe eontents of the many ledgers, books, and documents kept by the subordlnato ofricers of the bank, or that I should have the responsibiltly of the entries therein fixed upon me. "At the last examinatlon the 'Deposlt Journal' was placed In my hando, and I was shown thereentry of a transfer of £5,000 from the account of I Stephens and Others' to my personal account. I was asked whether such transer had been made 1 Pre3uming that the entry wa correct I erroneously answered that It h3d bsea; but a subsequent nspecton of the book In Mr. Webster's hands convince; me that the entry was an error, that such transfer never dld take place, and Mr. Webster has sinos admitted to me that the said entry was wrong. " I submit that the discovery of so serious an error requires that ample time should be allowed for a thorough investigation of the b3nk books, and Iam certaln that after it I shall be able to rectify any Inaccuracies my lengthened examination may have produced. The adjournment will also enable me to show that aU the advances made to Colonel Waugh were brought to the knowledge of and sanctioned by the directors: that the recou,tle3 covering the same were cDnslderel ample; and that so late as Febrary, 1857, Colonel Yates, one of the Committee of Liqaidatlon and a director, assured me that Oolonel Waugh's ' security only"wanted time to make it worth amillion' " I have Instruteed Mr. WIkie to make the necessary appUcation for an adjournmentk and also for an order on the bank to produce the bookn In the custody of the Sheriff-Olerk, that I may deliberatel, and carefully go through them, after which I shall be prepared to oomplete my examination. "I ar, Sir, your most obedient servant, " J. E. STEPHENS. Graham Binny, Esq., Trustee. 9, Hartstreet." Our correspondent condudes his report with the foUlowing accoant of Stephens :-The bankrupt it appears, is not uniknown in Edinburgh, having received hrs medical education at the University there. fle Is a good-looking man of robably 40, and when he first appeared at his examination he was cool, colected, distinct having al the bearing and manner of an inteligent man of business. He graduaUy, however, lost his - eaSY self-possession, and by the fourth day the mental rack had evidently begun to tell severely upon him, he having by this time quite renounced his previous sglf-satisfied and complacent air. The subjects of exmination on Thursday ap- to take him by surprise, and he beat the Dnshconiderblyfor his answers, which he gave, retracted, and repeated. He frequently exhibited, perhaps assumned, the appearanco of confusion; sometimes did not understand, oftenet did not remember. H[is hesitation and amnbignity of answer were particularly seen in reference to his father's trust account, the loans from Lord Gough, and the alleged transfers to his private account, which he admitted, though he denies it in his letter. Twice during Thursday he held private consultations with his agent and counsel, under whose advice evidently he withdrew answers that were rather dangerous admissions, and also changed his vague " I do not remember," to the more frank, bnt equally evasive, "I decline to answer." The bankrupt has certainly encountered both an inquisition and a publicity which he did not expect, and, no doubt, hoped to elude by coming to Scotland; and if he has fled it is nothing to be surprised at. The only wonder is that he should bave been so long in making up his mind, if this was his object. The examination was adjourned from Thunrday last to Monday, and the bankrupt was certainly in Edinburgh up to Sunday evening. Whether he has since fled to London, or further, whetherhe means to return or has fairly gone off, a day or twvo will perhaps clear up; bult certain it is that he is not to be found at Northumberland. street, Edinburgh, and the universal beUef is that unless the messenger atarms be diligent and successful he is not likely to be beard of again here.

FALL OF' A CDIIY.-A large chimney, 120 feet high, in connexion with the Oase Chymical Works at Bowden-dyke, near Howden, the property of Mr. G. Anderson, of Cleckheaton fell 'with a tremendous crash in the vitriol chamber of the establishment on Saturday evening. causing a great destraction of property, the loss of seven lives, and the severe injury of four persons. It appears that the whole of the men regularly eamployed at the works had left for the day, and some plumbers and their assistants were working overttme in the vitriol chamber to get it ready for use on Monday morniug. At about half-past 7 o'clock a loud crash was suddenly heard, and the men vrere in the act of rushing out of the place, when the roof was smashed in by the fal of the chimney, and all the hands wereburled in the ruins. Every effort was made to rescue the unfortunate sufferers, and by half-past 10 o'clock elght persons had been got out, five of them quite dead, two seriously injured, and a boy with one leg broken. On Sunday the bodies of two others killed were recovered. The following is a list of the killed :-John Taylor, plumber, London; John Pearson, plumber, Armley, near Leeds; John Broadbent, plumber, Bradford; William But. terwick, labourer, Howden; George Coultard, labourer, Hovden; Joseph Barker, labourer, Howden; JamesWard, labourer, Drax, near Selby. A plumber named George Wardle, of Manchester, had his leg broken ; another plumber, named Eobert Schofield, of Manchester, was severely crashed; Joseph Clough, plumber, Bradford, sustained severe; internal injuries, and is not expected to rocover; a labonring man named Newton, af Howden, had his leg broken, and received other injuries, Most of the men were married, and some of them have left famulles. Toe greater part of the works are a complete wreck, and the lo3sis estimated at between 4,0001. and 5,0001. The scene alter the accident was very appalling, but the medical men exerted themselves strenuously to aleviate the sufferings of the wounded. An innuest was opened on Monday after. noon by Mr. R. B. Porter, who refused to admit the representatives of the press to the inquest-room. It was expected, however, the inquest would be adjourned for a week,

It appears, from a statement of the progress of thls com. pany's Victoria-bridge up to the end of November, that out of 24 piers 14 have been completed to the level of the tubes, and one to just above the summer water leveL The abutments of the bridge, 242 feet in length, have been comr pleted to the tube level, and the causeways connecting them with the land have also been completed to the level of the rails. The causeway at the northern end of the bridge is 1,400 feet in -length, and that at the southemn end 700 feet irn length. These complete the commrurnication from the land saide to the abutments, It J.& expected by the end of next year that 22 of the piers will he completed, leaving only two to be construated in 1859 In the meantime the construction and erection of the tubes 'will be proceeded with. Two have reached Canada, and several others are in prepartion, so as to insure their erection in the course of next summer. The superstructure of the bridge will be constructed in a similar way to that of the Britannia-bridge over the Menai Strait%, The Victoria-bridge, from shore to shore of the St. Law-. rence, vrl be nearly two miles in length, belng about five and a-half times the length of the Britannia&bridge and seven and a-half times the length of Waterloo-bridge over the Thames. Twenty-four of the tubular spans will be 24 feet each, the centre span being 330 feet, and 60 feet above the gummer level of the river St. Lawrence. The height of the tubes at the abutments will be 36 feet above the summer level, gradually rising in height on each side to the centre span: The length of the bridge between the abutments is 8,000 feet.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENE.B. FMANO. (FROM oUR OWN COIPON-D [The following appeaxed Xn our second edition of yes.teid&y :-1 rEA±U, MONDAY, DEc. 14, 6 r.M. It Is again announced for the twentieth time that WM. de Thouvenel vlill visit Paris during the present uaonth on leave of absence. He has long desired to return to France on urgent private business, but has 'been hitherto prevented by political matters. Much depression continues among the trading classes in Paris and the departments, although no failures of any note have been announced. The ,commercial bills due up to the present date have, generally speaking, been paid regularly. but there is little doubt that sacrifices are made in order to meet these engagements. Great commercial enterprise is not the characteristic of the French, and, how tranquil soever the country may be under the absolute hand of its ruler, the events of 1848 and the sudden overthrow of Governsnent amid general prosperity have introduced a routine of caution from which it is difficult to make them deviate. Much business is done for ready money, and where credit is inevitable people manage to make it as short as possible. For these reasons it is probable that the commercial or financial crisis will not be severely felt as compared withother people of more venturous or less tiid habits, and less recently, or less seriously, affected by political changes. For the present, manufacturing Is in general suspended, and commercial operations in a great measure paralyzed. The reduction of one pr cent, in the rate of discount by the aink iof France has not yet been followed by all the beneficial results that were anticipated on the Stock Exchange. The monthly account of the Bank, as published in the Moniteur of Friday, Is regarded as favourable by commercial men, as it shows an increase of 46,000,000f. in its stock of bullion as compared with the preceding month; but, on the other hand, the decrease of 37,000,000f. in the amount of commercial paper discounted in Paris, and of 40,000,000f. in the departments, clearly indicates the falling off in commercial operations. The Paris flour market on Saturday last was 'eavy, and serious deductions had to be made in order to effect sales. The factors declared 2,077 sacks, of wblch 141 were delivered at prices varying from 46f. to 52f. the sack of 157 kilogramames, according to quality. There was no business done in four of the four marks, and the price of this quality remains nominally at 52f. the sack. The reserve in the market stores has increased to 7,028 -quintals. From the examination of various returns it imay be inferred that wheat has reached its lowest figure; it now remains stationary. A good deal of businesB has been done in oats during the past week, and with little variation in prices. Grain of good quality from the Beauce is quoted at 30f. the measure of 130 kilogrammes; and Champagne, Lorraine, and Burgundy oats at 28f. the 150 kilogrammes. Barley is quoted at 19f., and rye at the same price for 115 kilogrammes. Bran was more in demand at the Halle last week than previously, and the Etampes millers made large sales at 1.3f. the o00 kilogrammes for iammediate delivery in Paris. Picardy bran was offered at 12f. Advices from the cattle markets in the departnents are, in one sense, favourable; the markets are abundantly supplied with sheep and oxen, and the quotations are lower than they were at the corresponding period of last year; but the prices obtaied at the late fairs of Nantes and Rennes did tot satisfy the sellers. The fair of Lons-le-Saulnler on the 5th was favoured by the finest weather, and the demand for prime cattle was more brisk. Since ihen the fair of St. Nicholas at Evreux has been more satisfactory to the graziers of Normandy. Sales of butchers' tallow have been difficult this season in Paris on account of the high price demanded. The firt price asked was 13Wf., but it fell to 12Sf., =27f. 60c., and 127f. The present quotation is 128f. The Paris sugar market is calm, at 129f. the 100 kilograrames for good beetroot. There was but little business done at the Bercy wine market last week.

MONBYf-MA RKETao. CITYINTELLIGBNWB. Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 3 per mille premium, and the short exchange on London is 25 '30 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. Did. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is about 2- Oths per cent. dearer in London than in Paris. At Hamburg, owing to the commercial derangements, no foreign exchange quotations have been published. The quotation of the exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is abouat 109 per cent. for first-class paper. At the present rate of discount here there is consequently no profit on the transmission of gold from this country to the United Staten. The English funds have been dull throughout the day. Consols, which after regular hours yesterday left off at 91i to J, opened at 91# to i, and remained without the slightest alteration to the official close. Subsequently there was a better tendency, and transactions took place at 91g. Bank Stock closed at 217 to 219; Reduced and New Three per Cents., 91i to J; India Bonds, 33s. to 25s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. In the Stock-Exchange loans on Government securities were obtainable at 5 per cent. for short periods, and at 6 to 7 per eent. till the dividends. At the Bank there is still an active demand, but in the open market the choicest bils can be negotiated at 91 to 9k per cent. The foreign stock-market has been buoyant, especially Turkish, which marked as high as 94; after 4 o'clock there was a further rise, the final quotation being 941 to 95i, or fully 2 per cent. above the last price yesterday. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 96k; Mexican, 18k; for the account, 19&; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 75 and 75i; Portuguese, 44 and 43 ; Russian Five per Cents., 104; ditto Four-and a-Half per Cents., 96i and 97; Sardinian, 84i; Spanish New Deferred, 251 and i ; Turkish Six per Cents., 922 and 93 ; for the account, 931 and 94; and the Four per Centx. Guaranteed, 991. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates on Paris were lower than last post; Hamburg was nominaUy about the same, but little business was transacted. Prime bils on Amsterdam were in demand at a fraction below previous quotations. The final prices of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourne this evening were 66f. 40c. for money, and 66f. 65c. for the end of the month, ahowing a fraotional decline. About 210,0001. of gold was taken to the Bank to-day. 110,0001. was Australian, and a great part of the remainder Russian. The letters from Paris state that the stock of bullion in the Bank of France continues to increase, and that all mercantile houses are still restricting their engagements as much as possible. At Lyons the branch of the Bank of France is making advances upon silk at about 50 or 60 per cent. of the market price. The letters from Hamburg of the 13th it. are far from describing any general return of confidence. Additional failures were still expected. The total up to the present time is about 140, and the disclosures consequent upon them, it is said, "have exposed a system of bill accommodation to an extent that must sadly lower Hamburg in the eyes of the commercial world." The liabilities of Messrs. Wiley and Co., sUikmercers, whose bills were mentioned as having been returned yesterday, are about 50,0001. The public must have heard of the National Currency Reform Association. It was established about seven years back with a regular organization, and has issued tracts in thousands.j Its object was to show to the masses that the Bank Act of 1844 was bringing them to ruin ; that it was a " studied and wicked contrivance of Parliament for the benefit of usurers ;" that the grand cause of commercial disasters was not over-production on the part of speculators, bat an "under-production of money" on the part of the State; and that it was the duty of philanthropists and Christians of all denomninations to rise up against it in defence of " plundered industry." The president of this association was Mr. Francis Bennoch. On the 9th of last month the suspension was announced of Messrs. Bennoch, Twentyman, and Rigg. Their business was that of silk agents, and the senior partner was the Mr. Bennoch in question. It must have created surprise that one who for seven years had been instructing the Government and the nation on the principles of finanial science should not have been able to manage with ordinary skill his own monetary affairs, but the contingencies of commerce are such that no one can boast of being secure in all cases. The natural inference was that the firm would be found to have faUlen in consequence of some unexpected disasters; that the principles upon which its business had been conducted would bear the strictest investigation; and that all mercantile persons might bestow on each of the partners that cordial sympathy which is the best alleviation under such difficulties. How far these anticipations have been realized must now be described. At a recent meeting of creditors a statement of the affairs of the house has been submitted by a professional accountant. The firm had been nine years in existence, and was started with a capital of 9,4101., towards which the amount contributed by Mr. Bennoch, the senior partner, was apparently 1,4571. At the date of Its stoppage, on the 9th ult., its liabilities actually requiring to be provided for were 257,6941., while Its aggregate commitments, direct and indirect, seem to have amounted to little short of half a million. As the business was simply that of agents, and was therefore, supposing it to be properly conducted, wholly unconnected with any speculative risks, this is perhaps a total as astounding as any ever presented under similar circumstances. The question, however, is, what are the assets on the other side ? According to the estimate of the accountant their amount on the 27th ult. was 91,3021. In tine years, therefore, a deficiency had been hicurred of 166,3921., and, as this is at the rate of of nearly 19,0001. a-year, and the orlginal capital of the firm was only 9,4101., it appears that during each year of its exist- ence it must, if we take an average caloulation, have lost double the whole amount it was ever worth. But its transactions appear to have been on a grander and less graduated scale. The statement, whatever may be the opinion as to its probability, is that at the beginning of the present year the house had a sRirplus of 38,2481., and in that case a total loss of 204,6401. must have been incurred within les than eleven months. Is it possible, it will be asked, that any mere " agency" business could have led to such a reslt ? The answer is, that although Messrs. eRnnoch described themselves as silk agents, they were in reality silk speculators. With an original capital of 9,4101. they undertook rinks such as were capable of resulting in difference3 to the amount of 166,0001., to be borne by their creditors if the experiment went wrong, and to be appropriated in the contrary case by themselves. The balance-sheet submitted fully indicates the nature of their opera. tions. One of the first items is 50,9501. for depreciation in the value of silk in the hands of brokers, then comes 36,9831. for over-acceptances on goods, then 22,9971. for losses on bad bills, then 3,0001. for " guarantees" of some descrip- tion, and next 33,8941. for liabilities on debts of. Messrs. Lovatt and Gould, of Leek, which Bennoch and Co. have "1 undertaken to pay." The chAracter of the losses on over-acceptances and bad bills will be understood from the notification that, in addition to their connexion with Lovatt and Gould, the firma had relations with the house of Roid and Co., of Derby, which consisted of Mr. eidX Mr. Bennoch, and Mr. Twentyman, and which drew oit Benuoch, Twentyman, and Rigg, of London, for 32,323., as well as with Taylor and Co., of Coventry, eatablished only about a year 1-ack witn a capital of 4,0001., and who drew for 18,7501. against goods now worth only 11,9611., while they were also favoured by the London house with cash advances for 10,6371. It is hard to speak of these things as they deserve, but the duty must be performed without regard to individual feeling. The conclusion is that, after having started with 1,4571., Mr. Bennoeh has enjoyed the command of a great establishment for nine years, has entered into risks which, if they had gone as he hoped, would have made him a merchant prince-a good many of our merchant princes have been made in the same way-and is at the end of the time certainly not much worse off than when he began. Losses, however, have had to be borne. Mr. Bennoch has not sustained any worth mentioning, because he had hardly anything I to lose, but 166,0001. has disappeared out of the pockets of some people. It will be well if, when he next ponders over his tract on " plundered industry," he will consider whether he has exhausted the subject in all its bearings. Meanwhile all who wish for aatisfactory assarance as to the general tone of commercial morality will be anxious to know how this balance-sheet and the accompanying explanations were received by the great body of the creditors. After the recent exhibition at Glasgow it will be hoped that, while putting up with their loss and resolving to make the best of the wreck, such representatives of the trade of London as were present took the opportunity of placing on record by a formal motion their sense of the course that had been pursued. It does not appear, however, that a word of disapproval was uttered. It was simply determined that the concern should be wound up by the partners under friendly inspeco tion, and that as soon as possible even this degree of supervision should be arranged to terminate. Messrs. Durrant, Eaton, Foster, and Evans were appointed to the task, and thus the affair has ended. But for the Bank Charter Act and the under-production of money by the Government-the extra issue of 2,000,0001. of paper was not effected until three days too late-the " disaster," perhaps, might, at an additional cost to the public, have been averted for a short time longer. The following relates to an allusion recently made by Mr. Weguelin to a joint-stock bank failure in Wales which occurzed a few years back:- "1 Sir,-Objections having been made to a statement made by me in the House of Commonrs on the 8th inst., to the effect that the Glamorganshire Bankldng Company had failed and paid a dividend of 18s. or 19s. in the poand, I beg you will allow me to explain in yourcolumnsth%tIreferred to the ' Monmouth and Glamorganshlre BanDking Company, which failed on the 7th of Ootober, 1851. "Iaw, &a., " T. M. WEGUEELIN. "Austin-friars, Dec. 15." On the 10th ult. the suspension was notified at Liverpool of Messrs. B. F. Babcock and Co., with houses also at Glasgow and New York. It was then mentioned that they had been brought down by the absence of remittances from America; that a few months previously they were in possession of a clear capital of 150,0001.; and that they were confident of their ultimate ability not only to pay every one in full, but to secure a considerable surplus. To-day the following gratifying circular has been issued, announcing their resumption of business "Liverpool, Dec. 15. "Referring to our circular of the Uth ult., it affords us much gratification now to announce to you our resumption of payment. " Our overdue acceptances will be paid on presentation at our bankers, with interest. " We beg to thank our creditors for their forbearance in not pressing their claims upon us, and to express our regret at the inconvenience our suspension has occasioned them. "B. F. BABCOCK and Co., LiverpooL "J. F. JAMIESON and Co., Glasgow." A meeting of creditors of Messrs. Mendes Da Costa and Co., West India merchants, whose suspension was announced on the 2d inst., was held this afternoon, when the following statement was submitted by Mr. Coleman, the accountant - I STATZZIENT OF TIIE A.sFAIRS OF hMESSRS.

At the date of suspen. sion the accounts showed a nominal balance in favour of the firm of 73,0001., less 15,0001. to be written off for bad debts, and 9,9001. partners' drawings during a period of eight years. The amount due from the house at St. Thomas's is 112,311L, and it is estimated that, after providing 42,0001. for bills that will go back upon them and diminish the liabilities on this estate to a corresponding amount, and 20,0007. for other charges, that house will be able to pay about 30,0001. out of the balance remaining of 50,0001. The atoppage has been caused by the late heavy commercial disaaters. In answer to questrons Mr. Coleman stated that the bad debtors consist of failed houses, and that the good debts are generally covered by produce, &c. It was finaly resolved to wind up the estate under inspection, and a committee of three creditors was appointed accordingly. Positive statemenxts have been circulated to-day of the embarrassment of firms in Yorkshire largely connected with the wool trade, which, if confirmed, iw ill be likely to lead to numerous difficulties among smaller houses The Ottoman Bank have received 42,0001. in gold from the East. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day an order was made for winding up the London IJnadulterated Food Company. An adjournment of the examination meeting was ordered in the case of Messrs. Gotch and Gotch, bankers, of Kettering. Two other cases came before the Court, in which smal tradesmen had been unforunately Induced to aocept accommodation bills for Messr. D. and J.

" In the United States the relative value of gold to silver iss I to 16, but in Japan It is about I to 31-7th, so that although the Japae20se give the same weight of their gold coin as the foreign coin they receive, yet owing to the difference of relativo valnes, a loss ensues o rnore than 75 per cent. on forelgn gold, As compared with slver. " To illmutrate the operation of the 3d article of the convention, I would state that where Am2ericans have heretofore paid S100 in silver they will now pay $34A. "Very respectflly your obedient servant, "e TOWNSEND HARRIS. To James Keenan, Esq., JUnited States' Consul, Hongkong." For the purpose of further regalating the intercourse of American citizens within the empire of Japan, and after due deliberation, Townsend Harris, Consul-General of the United States of Amnericas within the empire ofJapan, and Inowouye, Prince of Sinanuo, and Nakamoera, Prince of Dewa, Governors of Simoda, al having full powers fro= their respective Governments, have agreed on the following articles, to wit : "Art. 1.

" Art. 2. It being known that American ships coming to the ports of Simoda and Hakodade cannot havo their wants supplieL by the Japanese, it is agreed that American citizens may permanently reside at Simoda and Hakodade, and the Govemrment of the United States may appoint a vice, consul to reside at Hakodade.

LONDON, WBDNZSDAY, DEcOEMBER 16, 1867. Some few days before the end of the isdon a member of the House of Commons ventured I to compare the reward proposed for Sir H. HAVELOCK with the honours and Wealth that would have been heaped on the higlhly connected Crimean Generals, if any one of them could in common decency have been declared worthy. The speaker unluckily referred to the whole Crimean campaign in terms of rather exaggerated disparagement, and incurred from Lord ?ALMJRsToN a rebuke which Was perhaps merited. But Mr. WHITE will have to a certain extent the acquiescence of his countrymen in the opinions which he so clumsily expremsed. Sir HBMY HAVELOCx's penson is confessed to have been insufficient, and as to the Crlxmean campaign, it Is best understood by contrasting it with what is now pasing in India. We are perfectly prepared for the objections which will meet s at the threshold. It will be said that no oomparison can be instituted between a country where we have had military establishments for a century and a little peninsula on which we landed to assault an enemy's stronghold. Others may urge that after all we have now different enemies to cope with, and that victories over Sepoys are not to be put in the scale with victoriea over Russians. But, accepting all such objectionu, it still remains evident to every impartial mind that there does exist in the Indian service a spirit, a method, a military knowledge, a largeness of conception, and an abundance of resource which has no parallel among those who have been so long the favourites of the Horse Guards. As an instance of what English officers are capable we may take the events of the siege of Delhi, as narrated in the official despatch of Si, A. WVLsoN. The General states the great result of his operations,-the seizure of the PING'S Palace and of the entire city, and the precipitate flight of the rebel troops, who, abandoning their camp, property, many of their sick and wounded, and the greater part of their field artillery, fled either across the Jumna or down its right bank. The capture of the KiNG and the execution of three of the Princes followed this complete success. But what were the means by which operations so difficult were carried out by such a handful of men ? General WiLso's despatch answers the question. Every man, every department, worked together ; there was no hitch or blunder, no quarrelling, no recrimination, no shirking of responsibility, no retreat behind the forms of official procedure. The Commisariat fun nished provisions, and did not content itself with making requisitions. The Commissaries of Artillery kept up a constant supply of shot and shell, and were not satisfied with having brought them to within some half-dozen miles of the place. Orders were rightly given and rightly interpreted; seniors commanded with skill, and juniors obeyed with alacrity; the attack was well supported; the cavalry really performed its duties; in fact, all was done which is held to be usual in war, but of which the Crimean campalgn showed such provoking negligence. "For four months of the most trying season of the year," says the despatch, "'this force, "originally very weak in number, has been exposed "to the repeated and deternined attacks of an "enemy far outnumbering it, and supported by a "numerous and powerful artillery." " The duties," adds the General, " impo.ed upon al "have been laborious, haraing, and inc=eant, "and, notwithstanding heavy losses, both in "action and from disease, have been at anl times "zealously and cheerfully performed." To the Artillery, both officers and men, the General offers his thanks, "and particulrly to Lieutenant"Colonel HOGGZ, Director-General of the Artil"lery Depot, who volunteered his services as "Commsary of Ordnance with the iege train, and "throughwhose ablesuperintendenceofthepark and " arTangements for the supply of ammunitiou our "artillery was euabled to. deal out the destruction "which was afterwards effected." Thus we find that though the chief arsenal of the Upper Provinces had been seized by the enemy, though we were originally deficient in siege guns and ammunition, though everything had to be brought immense distances through a country swarming with enemies, yet, when the time came, guns, shot, shell were I all ready, and the assault took place. LieutenantColonel BAID SITn,HChiefEngineerisalsothanked, since, " in ill health and while sufering fromi "the effects of a painful wound, he devoted him-i "self with the greatest ability and assiduity to the "operations of the slege;" andthe whole Engineer, force is mentioned as having "planned and sue"ceeafully carried out in the face of extreme dif"ficulties an attack almost without parallel in "the annals of siege operations." We may well admire the spirit in which this officer, under the burning heat of an Indian summer, and suffering from the pain of his wound, bore up against the exertion and responsibility of conducting a siege in which some 5,000 or 6,000 men, mostly Sikhs hastily levied, were to be opposedto 25,000 Sepoys intrenched behind strong fortifications, and defending a city to which they had always looked with superstitious veneration. Colonel BAnu SsrrD8 , however, persevered to the end ; he did not go off to the hills on sick leave or on his own private affairs; he and his subordinates felt that they were soldiers doing soldiers' work, they laboured at their batteries, and Delhi was taken after " an attack almost without parallel." We will next pass to the Commissariat. " Under "circumstances," says Sir A.WnsoN, "of peculiar "difficulty, in a district the population of which "his been inimical, and in which civil authority "has ceased to exist, this force has from "the commencement been kept well and "sufficiently provisioned with supplies of every "description, the issue of rations having been "as regular both in quantity and quality as in " cantonments." The despatch then mentions the names of the Commissaiat officers whose exertions principally contributed to this happy result. The medical arrangements seem also to have been most satisfactory. " At such a trying "season of the year, and in a notoriously un"healthy locality, the sickness and mortality "have, of conrse, been heavy. In addition, the "hospitals have received almost daily acces "sions of wounded men. The labours of the "rmedical department have, therefore, been un"ceasing; notwithstanding, there has not been "at any time the slightest failure in the arrange"ments for the care and comfort of the very "numerous patients." Who shall say after this that the English are not a military nation ? Here is a little force, bastily gathered to retake a large city and military arsenal garrisoned by a host of desperate Sepoys. The English Army-if its numbers justify the namemight naturally be expected to be deficient in everything. Distances are great, the season hot and unhealthy, the country is hostile and on the point of rising, and communications are with difficulty kept open. If the English force had been destroyed, if the Comnmissariat had furnished no food, if the siege train had brought up no guns, if disease had swept away all that hunger spared, would not officers of every kind and degree have been justified, on the Chelsea precedent, in expecting an honourable acquittal ? They could have let thingB go to ruin without tranagresaing a single regulation or neglecting a single fornality. They could not, indeed, have expected the B3ath and high appointments at home; such honours are reserved to blunderers of a more august class; but under the segis of military routine they might have expected to be saved from national dis. pleasure. But the event has been widely different. This force has not only been preserved, it has not only beaten the enemy, but it has carried on an unprecedented siege, taken a large city defended by au army four times its own strength, dispersed the Sepoy Army, followed it up, driven it from the Doab, reduced a wide district to profound tranquillity, and, to crown all, sent out two columns, one of which, under Colonel GBRATnED, has mrched 140 miles, beaten the enemy some half-dozen times, entered Cawupore, marched on Lucknow, joined the Commander-in-Chief in delivering OUrTABI and IAvEaocx, and then, with unflagging energy, probably taken part in the operations againt the main body of the mutineers. Such is a proof of what officers can do when they know how to do it. The Army's difficulty is the General's opportunity, and the country will honour those who do not complain of obstacles, but surmount them. In this point of view the campaign in India will be a valuable study both to the public and the military profesion.
The increase in the price of land in Lreland is a fact well deserving public attention. When the Encumbered Estates Court first commenced proceedings the estates that went through the Court brought from 12 to 15 years' purchase. Now we find from the Wale of the late Marquis of THOMOm D's property that land is bringing from 20 to 30 years' purchase. The Clare estates, Producing a net actual rental of nearly 4,000l. a-year, and valued at 5,0001. a-year, have soldfor nearly 325,0001., which is 25 years' purchase upon the valued, and 31 years' purchase upon the actual rentaL The Cork estates, producing a net rental of nearly 4,8001., have sold for 111,0001., which is about 23 years' purchase. The principal cause of this improvement is of course to be found in the greater tranquility and more settled state of the country, which has made persons more willing to embark their capital upon Irish land. There could not be a more satisfactory sign of public improvement. Another cause is the actual increase in the value of land in the sense of productiveness. The year 1856 exhibited a considerable addition to the area of land under crops, especially corn crops, which latter alone covered nearly 3,000,000 acres. The increaae of live [stock has also been satisfactory, and an increase of live stock is of course a sign of improvement of soil, where this increase has been gained, as it has in Ireland, without abstracting from the land under crops. We have no doubt that these two are the great causes of the rise in the price of Irish land; but one peculiar reason which has told in the sale of the THomoND estates should also be noticed, because it looks at first sight not a natural cause of increase of price, like those two mentioned, but an artificial one. It was thought that if an opportunity were offered the small farmers would, to a considerable extent, become proprietors of the soil on whicn tneir labours had been expended. Accordingly, in the sale of the THomowND property the experiment was tried, and it completely succeedeL The Clare estates were divided into 183 lots, the Cork estates into 77 lots. The result was what has been just stated,-a sale respectively at 31 and 23 years' purchase. As a matterof simple auction, then, the experiment has decidedly answered, and that is all the auctioneer is responsible for. 33at considerations suggert themselves with respect to some practical results of such sales, which are worth attending to. The number of lots into which the Clare estates have been divided would not give more than an average of from 251. to 301. a-year as the value of each lot; the division of the Cork estates would not thus average more than about 601. The lots, then, produced by the division of these properties being more than 250, here is what appears to an English eye a large creation of small farms. This is upon the assumption that each lot is a separate farm, which may not be, and probably is not, the case. Still the whole division works in this direction, and we have undoubtedly here an extensive creation of what would be considered upon an English standard small farms. Various questions then arise upon the acknowledgment of this fact. These farms have been purchased by small fanners, many of them hitherto the tenants. Where do these men get the money to buy them? If it is their own money, why have they not paid their rents better as tenants ? If it is borrowed money, how do they propose to work their farms so as to enable them to pay the interest of it, with the necessary residuum of profit for themselves, out of the land? It is very clear that, on the scale of prices which these estates have fetched, this interest will be a good deal more than what their de facto rent has been. Even the nominal sum will be an advance, and the practical sum will be atill more in advance of the old rent, for money-lenders cannot be put off as easily as landlords. They are a very different set of people to deal with. In this state of things where is the capital to come from that is to improve this land ? Is all this land handed over indefinitely to bad and niggardly treatment,-to, at best, a very poor sort of French farming ? Were this a ease of English land, these questions, we say, might be asked with considerable regret; but the case of Irish land, when we examine it, is different. Small as the farms created by this sale are, they are considerably largerthan the present average of farms,--or rather, for it is absurd to call them farms-of holdings in Ireland. The average size of farms in Ireland, according to Mr. DozA-AEL s report, in 1856 was nine acres. There were 37,000 holdings not exceeding one acre, 82,000 between l and 5 acres, 180,000 between 5 and 15, 140,000 between 15 and 30, 73,000 between 30 and 50the farms of 50 acres and upwards being a very small minority. This new formation of farms, then, which in England would be a falling back,-a lapse from a system of capital and large farms to a system of no capital and small farms,-is, on the contrary, in Ireland a rise and enlargement in the scale of farming. It is, in fact, an attempt to raise holdings into farms. Capital cannot, of course, be got for Irish cultivation to anything like the extent to which it can be for English. In the necessary absence, therefore, of capital, the interest which ownership will give in the good condition of land may, perhaps, act as the next best stimulus to improvement. The purchasers of these lots will probably be men of some degree of enterprise in their own line, who will bring some activity of mind to bear upon their purchases, an activity which will be aU the greater in consequence of proprietorship. We give this as tho best aspect under which such an experiment as this can be viewed, though, of course, there are other aspects in which it may be viewed not so favourable. There is another consideration which favours this experiment, and that is the greater capacity for improvement belonging to Irish land, implied in the greater room for improvement. In England we have done so much that we can hardly look for an increase of productiveness going on in the same rate in which it has hitherto done; but in Ireland the work of tillage is a much newer one, and therefore productiveness has more room for advance. TLat very simple and elementary part of tillage, for example, which consists of weeding, has hitherto made very little progreBs in Ireland. Even if a farmer here and there does use his hoe or fork, the weeds from his neighbours' land, and even from the high road, overwhelm him, and he feels it useless to contend against the hosts of seeds which every gust of wind carries with it, and scatters as it sweeps over his land. This one improvement would singly, and withont any other, be a very large advance in productiveness; for experiments have exhibited, as the result of weeding alone, an increase of one-fourth, of half as much again, and of as much again, in the produce of land. Mr. DONELLY urges legisation on this subject, as the only step which can secure " clean agriculture" in Ireland. He thinks weeds must be pronounced contrary to law, and be punished by penalty, as being, in real truth, injurious not only to yourself, but to your neighbour. The laws of France and Denmark make neglect of weeds, punishable; the statute of Arzx.A.;s IT. of Scotland denounced the nourisher of weeds as a traitor and " poisoner of the SING'S lands ;" and old Scotch law imposed on bondsmen the fine'of a sheep for each stalk of corn-marigold. Such legislation as this is happily out of date, and we must look to improved farming, and possibly also to the pressure of the instincts of the proprietor, for a more cleanly system of agriculture.
A descriptive account of things in India, written by an experienced observer, and despatched from Allahabad at a date so recent as the 1st of November, is not a communication likely to lack readers just now, and we may assume, therefore, with perfect confidence, that the letter of " A " CnvIvAL," which we yesterday published, has received all the attention which its lively style and instructive matter were calculated to command. As we have been gratified with still later reports of Sir Coini CGAPBaI's movements, we shall not follow our correspondent in his observations upon the expedition to Lucknow; but some of his remarks respecting the disposition of the people aud the general aspect of the country are too important to be passed without notice. In estimating the character of the present rebellion and the prospects of our future administration it must be recollected that the population of Hindostan-apart from its regular divisions of race and caste-contains four distinct elements. Foremost of all we must place " the people" of the country, in the proper sense of the term-that is to say, the masses-the millions, who, not possessing any notable position or profession, constitute the vast body of subjects with which a Government must deal. Next to these we may take the landholders, great and small-not powerful enough to be ranked with native Princes, but occasionally maintaining considerable forces of armed retainers, and always exercising some local influence. In a third class we may put the predatory tribes of the country, representing the relics of a half extinct barbarism, and furnishing up to the present time bands of men who betake themselves to violence and plunder as a natural pursuit whenever the control of civilization and authority happens to be suspended. Lastly, there is, or rather was, the Sepoy Army-a class of which it is quite unnecessary to append any description. It is clear that the most important of these elements is to be found in the population at large -in that prodigious multitude which tills the land, pays the taxes, and would still cover the country in scarcely diminished numbers even if all the more notable classes were extinguished. Tlhese, whether termed villagers or peasants, or husbandcmen or ryots, are the real people of India-the people whose advantage we are bound to study, and without whose favour or acquiescence our dominion could never be maintained for any useful purpose. If the people are with us no other classes can successfully oppose us, and it is now eonQIusively pTe by an accumulation of evidence that we have indeed this support to rely upon. Not only has no popular insurrection ever occurred-not only have our countrymen been almost invariably befriended in their extremity by the villagers whom theyencountered, but we receive unmistakeable proofs of the fact from all sources together. So entirely profeuional, indeed, has been this revolt, and so completely hua it been confined to the Sepoy battalions and their marauding allies, that the cultivation of the land and the ordinary avocations of peasant life have been conducted as uninterruptedly ax if no mutiny had ever taken place. " Nothing is more sur" prWing," says "A CrIVrra," writing from actual observation on the road, " than the way "in which, amid the crash of empire, the people "have this year not only cultivated, but in "many districts cultivated almost as well and as " extensively, as ever." The remark thus made with such little qualification applies, it must be remembered, to the very scene of the revolt, and it is confirmed by a statement equally striking in the hlst letter of our own Bombay correspondent, w1ho, speaking of the country between Delhi and Agra, reports "that the crops are everywhere ox"cellent, and that, incredible as it may appear, "this year's revenue is likely to be almost "entirely saved to the State." Six months ago certain politicians contended strenuously against the assumption that the outbreak was a military outbreak only, and not a popular insurrection, but the point has novr been decisively settled. The mutiny is a monstrous one, no doubt,-serious enough, as we have seen, to endanger the safety of the empire and to evoke all the energies of the State, but it is only a mutiny after alL It is a Sepoy revolt, not a Hindoo rebellion. The case of the landholders is leg clear, though even here we find no general or systematic hostility, except in the province of Oude. It may be observed, too, in passing, that our correspondent, in his explanation of that state of affairs which ix now giving us so much trouble, attributes not the smalest effect or significance to the annexation of the kingdom in question. The landholders in Oude are disatisfied with the British Government, but their disaffection has no reference whatever to the dispossession of a Mahomedan Sovereign or the extinction of a native Administration. The question at issue is an exceedingly old one, and concerns merely that double tenure of land which has produced its embarrnssments a good deal nearer home. In India, as in all Eastern countries, the property of the soil is presumed to rest in the supreme Monarch or Government. TInder the Government are large landholders, and under the landholders the clas of actual cultivators. The point in debate,which has been solved differently in different provinces, involves the distribution of rights between cultivators and landholders; and, as our authorities in Oude decided it in favour rather of the former, the landholders became first dissatisfied, and afterwards committed to rebellion against us, under the natural impulse of a desire to recover what they had lost. The concluding paragraph of the letter before us will have probably created considerable emotion among our readers As far down the country as Cawnpore, that is to say, over the districts where proceedings were likely to be regulated by the policy of the Punjab Administration, Sepoys received their due meed of punishment, but from Cawnpore downwards, where the policy of Calcutta may be supposed to prevail, a striling change became observable. " To our horror and surprise," says "A CIVIUN,r'?" "we see Sepoys of the old stamp "coolly walking along the public roads in broad "daylight, and we find that Government seems "to have taken them under its especial pro"tection." From the remarks which follow it appears as if the circumstances referred to arose from the operation of that famous proclamation of which so much has been said, buit which was censurable rather as ill-timed than ill-devised. Our correspondent, too, betrays the jealousy of his profession by complaining not only that Sepoys roam unmolested, but that " civil rebels" are treted lems considerately. There can, however, be no doubt about the main question. "The "whole Sepoy race," as he truly says, "have "turned on us in the most diabolical way," and as a race they should be utterly destroyed. We are not, of course, aserting that every man out of an army of 150,000 should be shot or hanged, but 'we do affirm that the class should exist no longer, and that the safety of our counzrymen and our empire should never again be imperilled by reliance on a force so utterly untrastworthy. The " Sepoy Army" must disappear-in fact, it has disappeared already through its own treason; and it would be the height of folly to reconstruct such a useless and inflammable mass. Native auxiliaries we must still maintain, and we can do so at all times without difficulty, but that particular element of Indian population from which all our troubles have arisen ought to have been extinguished under any circumstances, and should certainly never be revived, now that it is happily expiring of itself.
At the sitting of the Central Criminal Court yesterday WnraiA ATrw-uil and EDwAaD JACESON and his wife, the persons concerned in the robbery of Lady ELLESMRE'S jewels, were put upon their trial for that offence. With regard to ATTrW5LL, the man who had made a clean breast of it at a previous; seage of the proceedings, and who yesterday pleaded "Guilty," there could of course be but one result. The question, then, as affecting JAcKsox and his wife, resolved itself into one of a felonious receiving of the property. Supposing this question to be decided in the affirmative, it was further to be determined whether or no Mrs. JACKSON was acting under the coercion and authority of her husband, and so to be held free from penal consequences. The evidence against JAcKSoN was eonclusive, but a verdict of Not Gruilty was received against his wife. It appeared that this was not his first offence, but that for some time past he had beern known to the police as a reeeiver of stolen goods. Portions of the produce of no less than four robberies were found in his possession at the time of his arrest. There were other little specks upon his character besides, such as a previous trial at the. Old Bailey for felony. Under these circumstances he received the sharp but well-merited sentence of penal servitude for 10 years. It was considered that ATrwEL had earned a right to a merciful sentence, inasmuch as his voluntary confession had greatly assisted the officers in tracing out the circumstances connected with the robbery. The addition of imprisonment for a period of six months to the term which he is now expiating twas in his case held to be sufficient. It is to be regretted that the stupid, careless servants, to whose negligence Lady ELLESvERP, may mainly attribute her loss, cannot also be made to suffer a suitable penalty for their neglect of the property of their employer.

At the second ooncert, rwhich lWas attended by a very large audience, the full pieces were a symphony by MoZrt (In E fl at), overtures by Rosdni and Auber, and a " selection"from O1 bert IC Diable. A Mr. W. EL YIlls!, with a tenor voice of agreepble quality, and Mln Palmer, were the singers. The gentleman won eonadderLble favour In an air from one of the operas of Donizetti.

Whenever she appears the conoert is regarded as the most attractive of the ason. On the present ocasion she elected one of Mendelson's bet pleoes-the Serwnade and AlUegro Giqosa-a work not less difficult to execute than original ad beautifuL It was played with Mademoiselle Angelina's aocustmed brillancy and smcces The Srcnade, whloh is plaintive in character, was given throughout with charming and unafected senti. ment i while the Rondo Giqjoao displayed an equal amount of spirit znd mechanical proficiency. The reading wa everywhere artistic; and the vivacity rhich Is the prevalent characteristic of the rondo was never onoe lost sght of. The amateur accompanists, under the control of MAdemoiselle Angelina's igorous mind and supple fingers, were compelled to be on the alert, and we have rarely heard them so uniformly careful and effective. The applause at the end was unlversally hearL7 for an audience so difficult to warm up to any degree of enthusiasm. 8cme disppointmaent was felt that Mademoiselle Angelina, who, perhaps, shines even more as a compo6er thn nasanexecutant, should not have indulged her admirers with aew pianoforte conoerto.

The chairman ade an earnest appeal in favour of the object in view, and said It was their bounden duty to come forward In the most effectual manner and as speedily as pos-ible to give relUef to the wives and families of the galant men who have gone to fight our battles and maintain the honour of the country. It was but the other day, he said, that 30,000 men were sent 15,000 miles with their lives in their hands Other countries, such as Prussia and Austria, moved their troops but seldom. This country, therefore, required more than any other that we should have some stem whereby to meet the claims of our soldiers when they go forth to fight our battles; and he thought they should take the opportunity afforded that day to inaugurate a new sytem, that should be parmanent, for ameliorating the condition of those who were left behind when their husbands wer gone into distant lands. After some remarks from General Sir F. W. Wiliams, who reiterated a previous satement in rard to the great desti. tution in which more than 400 famIlies of the Royal Artillery had been left in conasequence of the sudden departure of our soldiers for India, the Rev. Thomas Harding stated the regult of a recent movement at Woolwich, conducted by a committee of ladles, for reUeving the distress alluded to. Major Vandeleur described the proceedings of the commiitee, and the mode Inwhichrellef had been affordedI Tbh tol amount of the subscription was 6264 13s, 3Ad. The meeting was addressed bythe Hon. Arthur Kinnaild, XP.. Alderman Finnis, General Tremenheere. Colonel Browne Mr. W. Angerstein, and Revs Cars Wilson, D. Cooke and A. De In Mere, and the following resolutions were agreed to -" That it is desirable an association be formed with a view of extending relief to the wives and families of our soldiers and sailors gone out to India ; and that it be aLo of a more permanent obaracter, for the purpose of directing Its attention to the oondition of tho wives and children of our soldiers and sailors whenever they are removed on servce, whether in war or pece, in distant and foreign countries; and that a committee (consisting of gentlemen whose names were read) be formed for the purpose of carrying out the foregoiDg resolution, and of organising a central board in London for rceiving subscriptions and devisig ulterior measures." It was arranged that the first meeting of this committee should take place on Monday next.

Meanwhile, hearng that an envoy from the King of Darfur to the Pasha of Epypt had arrived at Cairo, Consul Green placed himself m oommutication with him, and reports that Dr. Vogel (Abdul Wahed), acording to the King of Darfur's envoy, " had departed from Bornoa for Berghami, where he was wleU received, and, after having visited aU localities as he wished, he proceeded to Madagu and thenoe passed to Borgu,-that is to say, Waday, where be met the Vizier of the Prinoe of Waday, named Simalek, who treated him welL He afterwards entered the interior of that province to the capital city, called Wera, where the Prione Selaraf, socailed Sultan of Waday, who is now paralytic, resides, hut in the neighbourhood of Wara there is a sacred mourtain, the asent of which is prohibited to aU persons. Abdul Wahed (Dr. Vogel), whether informed of this or not, ascended this sacred monttain, and when the Prince leora' it he ordered him to be put to death, and so it was.

CALIFOBI'XA. (FBOM OUIR OWj COR RSPO"nmUT. CALFORNA, Nov. D. 'The mail from New York which arrived on last M3onday evening brought us the gloomy intelligence -of the money panic in that city, and of the severe dinancial pressure prevailing over all the Stateb. Mhe intelligence wai not unexpected. The wild land tand railway speculations and the bank expansions -which have been carried on, and the extravagant 'style of living indulged in, particnlarly in New York, had prepared us for this result, and so well prepared was the commercial conimunity of San iFrancisco for the event that it excited a mere impulsive movement of a few hours' duration. Only two houses have suspended, the Amaerican banking 4irm of Sather and Church, and the American com.nercial house of Moore and Folger. The proceedings preliminary to the closing of sies. Sather and Co.'s bank (which are quite Weculiar to California since the failure of So many -of our banks in 1854) are given with fidelity by one -of the local papers of Tuesday last:- I' RUN rUPOX SATR AND CHUrRCH-SUSPiNSION 0o? PAY1MENT-S. SCENE DURING ThE NIOHT AT THE BANX-ALL CRIDITOR PRESEXNT PAiD OFr. "Upon the arrival of the steamer Jobn LI Stephens lst -evening, aud the nows of the -rotest in New York of -draughts drawn by Sather and Church, bankers In this oity, -on the American Exchange Bank, at New York, a large number of attachments were sued out and levied upon the 'firm here. As is generally known, Sather and Church occupy the luckless banking premises of the late Page, Xacon, and Co. Shortly after midnight a great number of -persons collected about the bank and great excitement prevalled. Both Mr. Sather and Mr. Church were present, and notified the crowd that the banking houe would soon be opened. Meanwhile the crowd continued to increase. A Large deputation of the police wrer present, and took their posts about the doors to keep the press of creditors peaceful and orderly, while on the indAdeof the house some $30,000 or $40,000 of atachments were being levied. I At about half-past 2 o'clook this monling Mr. Sather -opened one of the doors of the bouse and invited al wlho 'had claims against the house to enter and be paid off; and at the same time requested all such as had no demands to leave the premises. A stream of persons crowded In and were paid at the counter. At about 4 o'clock, whoa nobody was present asking payment, and after all demands had been satisfied, the bank closed again. " ScEXs AT TH BANK THnS XORNILNG.-AjTACnazrTS IEVUtD.-Doo0 s CLOSED. "The news of the run spread through the ofty, and the -excitement this morning was Intense. At 9 o'clock this morning a crowd had collected again In front of the bank, and when it opened shortly afterwards a great press took place againat the doors. Many women were among the crowd, and anxiety and excitement were to be seen on every side. The sheriffs offlcers continued pressing In with attachments, which were issued ln showers from the Courts. As the crowd increased the excitement increased, and the .packed masses swayed backward and forward in front of an -opening about 2ft. wide, through which now and theni one 'battered creditor could squeeze into the building. Thiscon. tinued till about half-past 9 o'clock, when the doors were -closed and the crowd shut out." From a statement of the assots and liabilities published by the partners, it is believed all their creditors will be paid in fulL Messrs. Tallant and Wilde, bankers, -were heavily -drawn upon on Tuesday, but they sustained themselves. None of the other bankers were subjected to any pressure. The short panic of Tuesday morning was speedily over, and is now rarely spoken of, so quickly does the rapid succession of stirring events incidental to California llfe chase impressions from peoplee' minds. Messrs. Moore and Folger were engaged in the export of domestic produce-chiefly hides, in which -they did a large business. They were in the habit of drawing against their shipments upon Messrs. Willetts and Co,> of New York, and ot negotiatina their bills with Measrs. Sather and Church here; and the failure of the two latter houses brought them to a stand still. The friends of Messrs. Moore and Folger assert that their indebtedness will be liquidated, and their business has been such a good one that they ought to be able to pay all. As California is accused by the rest of the world of -recklessness beyond the usual measure, and of speculative propeneities of more than ordinary intensity, it is proper that I should state-as I do confidently, with the view of allaying the apprehensions of parties abroad who are connected with her commerce, property, and finances-that there is nothing in the late crisis elsewhere to affect her injuriously. That I may not be thought singular in this conviction I will (at the risk of tiring non-commercial readers) quote two short paragraphs from the local ,papers:- " We are not of those who antioipate thAt mueh disaster Ao Californmi will accrue from the untoward events in the Atlantie States. That there will necemslly be a few fail. ures and some pecuniary Zeistreas is to be expected. But, on thevwhole, our people have been expeoting and preparing for such a state of things as at present. Our people -have in the last few years passed through a commercial revolution. Things in this State had alreAdy reached the lowest bottom, and were gradually gaining a more sound basis. The great trouble with California has been the extravagant and luxurious mode of living by all classes of her citizens occasioned by the groat influx of gold. Thousands and thousand, of dollars were sent East for the purohme of luxuries which could well have been dispensed with. Hereafter our people will be more eoonomical. The unparalleled resources of this highly favoured State are such that she with a verv little trouble can supply all her own demands. Capital hereater, instead of being forarded by the million to fil the coffers and save from bankruptoy the heartlees speculators of the East, wi be used In developing our resources and improving our land. California to-day is a-head of any State in the 'Union, and her prospects "brighter. The crisis on the other side will ultimatoly be to her advantage. Thousands of persons now out of employ. ment in the Atlantic States will find their way to our shores with the intention of making this their permanent home, and fuly impressed with the Idea that labour wil meet with its due reoward." Another paper remarks " It is a matter of congratulation to aU Californians thav -with trifling exceptions, we are as yet free from this bhghq -which has fallen upon the natloa. Miost sinoerely do we pray that we may escape this finanoial crash; and, indeed, from all we can learn we feel that in this convulsion California, generally speaking, will not be affected. We have but just recovered from the great convulsions of 1855, and the finanoial condition of the people at large Is considered better than at any previou time in the history of the State. The only mercantile house which was forced to suspend was the well-known firm of Moore and Folger, and it is particularly matter of regret that a house so closely identified with the best interests of the State-that of exporting- native products other than gold-should have found themselves embarrassed, and that, too, by causes wbich tbey could not posibly foresee. With the exceptions referred to, the day passed over without fresh disasters. In fact, with us none are expected at present; our reverses have come and gone; our crisi8 is past; and from thin distance we can obeerve the panics and tumults on the Atlantic seaboard without any dread of the infection reaching us. The causes wbich led to all this ruin and disaster-the bank expansions-the tremendous rallway schemes and other projects representing money, when in fact money was not, but simply paper securities-with all these things as a community we have nought to do. With us a paper currency never existed; with us railroads never grew beyond their projection, and with winter just at our -doors-the season when our vaults, the mines, are about sgain to yield their abundant weaith-with a safe and frugal system of tzade, the result of experience in the past, it would seem that, were the entire globe convalsed with .monetary reverses, California yet might stand firm." I fully endorse these statements, which represent the sentiments of the mercantile community. The true cause of our exemption from the present misfortunes of the Atlantic commercial communities is that, a3 we export so httle, these communities never owe us anything. On the contrary, we -are always in debt to them for our imports. The agents of the Nicaragua Steam Company announce that the communication by this route is about to be speedily resumed. This is " a consummation most devoutly to be wished." The receipts of golddust have been abundant during the last fortnight. The demand both for dust and coin haa increased during the last two days, both being wanted for remittance in preference to bankers' bils. The gold remittance by the steamer this morning will amount to the usual sum exported every fortnight. I cannot say the exact amount. It will be nearly $2,000,000. Our winter haa fairly set in. Yesterday we had a deluge, accompanied by a warm delightful atnmssphere. We expect great receipts from the miues*tfine I ti'e sailing of the next mail, in consequence of the advent of raini It Is gratifying to have to mention that the news of the fiendish atrocities committed in India are always received here with much horror, disgust, and indignation, and have excited strong sympathy for the victims. A very different feeling iu now evinced by the American community from that exhibited so obtrusively and offensively during the Russian war. It looks as if each of the two Anglo-Saxon nations were learning to understand one another better than formerly, and making advances in the virtues of good feeling and esteem. Late discussions in Pariament, and more parficular]y the expremion of his sentiments by Lord Palmnerton, and the tone and conduct of Lord Napier, who has gained goldea opinions of all men in the States, have all tended to produce this amended feeling.

THr. MuntDEn AND SuICrDB IN DnitummoiesTRxwr.-The police up to last evening were unable to obtain any clue to the identity of the murderer. Not so as regards that of the murdered woman. Frominquiries iastl. tuted on the spot it appears that among the numerous applicants at Mr. Harper's yesterday was a young man named Helders, -who stated that he had reason to believe, from the desciption inthe publio papers, that the woman vho had been murdered was nearly related to him. The name of A. Helders, it will be remembered, was legibly written inside the fly leaf of a blotting case found by the poice amoug the luggage at the hotel. Mr. Harper, the proprietor of the hotel, was unable to comply with the earnest request of the applicant to view the body, as the key of the room was In the possession of the coroner's officer Davies. The young man went on to state that his relative was a widow and had tbree chfldren, the eldest of whom was only seven years of sge. She had left them with some relatives at Greenwich and she had not been heard of for some time, but It was supposed that she had gone to the continent. A few days ago a member of the family thought that she sawr her in company with a man who had the appearance of a foreigner. The description as to age, height, and complexion corresponded closely to that given of the unfortunate woman. THE RAxLWAY DisrPTJTs AT MA2iCnzsTxR.-Yeaterday Mr. Higgin, the barrister, appeared before the magistrates at Manchester to prefer a charge of assault against aclty policeman, arising out of the dispistes between the London and North-Western Railway Company and the Manchester, Sheffield, and alncolnshire Railway Company. Mr. Higgil, in substaunce, stated that on Friday last his client, Mr. Marsh, an attorney, came to Manchester by the Warrington and Stockport Railway, and was set down In the London-road station of the NorthWestern and Sheffield Companies, to have an interview with Mr. Watkin, the manager of the Sheffield Railway. On getting out of the tradn at the platform of the Altrincham and South Junction Company, two policemen belong. mng to the city of Manchester police were there One of these polioemea demanded his name and address, vhich he declined to give. He went on to the departure platform of the North-Western and Sheffleld Companies, sad waa going into Mr. Watldn's office, when the other polioeman obstructed the passage, and committed the asault complained of. Mr. Maude, the chairman of the magistrates sald if MIr. Hlggin was coming there to try a right he thought a Court of petit sesdons was hardly the place. Mr. HMggin said, no; be came to complain of the conduct of a member of the city police force. Mr. Maude.-But when the summons was applied for it was said there was no actual violence, so that it was more a oonstructive than an actual assault. Mr. Hlggln.-No; it was an actual assault. Mr. Maude.-But no violence was used beyond the polleman putting his hands upon the plaintiff. Mr. Higgin proceeded to state some further points In the case, and said the policemen 'were menhired by the LondonandNorthWestern Company to annoy the passengers of the Sheffield Company. Mr.Maudesadthatwasstedwhenhe grantedthe summons, and that the police were there to prevent passengers ooming upon the London and North-Western platform. Mr. Ovens, barrister, said he was present for the London and North-Western Company to jutfy the acts of the police. Mr. Maude.-Well then, you come to try a right. Mr. Ovens.-Yes. Mr. Higgin sad he had stated the factS, and if tb6 Bench did not choose to hear him to the termination there was no help for it. M-. Mande did not think it was altogether a question of assault, but what was sought was to raise a question of law, which 'was ta;en out of their hands by the 29th soction of the 3d of George IV. Mr. Ovens said he was there to prove that it wa a question of right, and that the London and North-Western Company claimed a right of lana which had been closed to the public. Mr. MAude thought it was a cas they could not entertan Mlr. Higgin said the Sheffield Company had a equal clam as joint tenants of the ttion, btitthe Bench delined to hearthe case hewas content. The partles then withdrew. THE MT}: LADY MoisLy.-The death of the Dowager Countess of Morley, 'which took place at Salt. ram on Sunday, the 6th inst., aftera short but painful illness, wa not only an irreparable calmity to her relations and intimate friends, but is one of the greatest loeses 'whtch society ever had to deplore, and the grave ought not to be allowed to close over such a valuable life without a brief and humble tribute being paid to her many virtues and admirable qualities. Iady Morley was the daughter of Mr. Talbot, of Gonville. in the county of Norfolk, and was married to John, first Earl of Morley, in 1809. In her youth she was strikingly handsome, and was no less admired for her personal attractions than for her mental powers and the variety of her aocomplihbmenls. Long after old age had dlsumed the lustre of her beauty her eyes of remarkable brightneas and the mobility of her countenance remained to expre3s the unimpairedvigour of her faculties and the unchilled warmth of her heart and feelings. From the moment 'when she was fSrst transplanted by her marriage into the great world of London she became its ornament and delight. Her excellent understanding hua been Improved by a sound education, while nature h bestwed upon her wit both sparkling and refined and an exquisite sense of humour, which were never tinged by any particle of illnature or malice; nor even in the utmost exuberance of socal gaiety was s'e ever tempted to say anything for effect, by 'which the feelings or susceptibilities of others eould be wounded or mortified. Nothing could be more delightful than her conversation. She was original without affectation, brilliant without display, kind without any air of condescensions; agieable alike to old and young. She was the most welcome guest in every society which she enlivened by her presence. Overflowing with real sympathy, and indefatigable in personal devotion, she was cherished with the tenderest affection by al who enjoyed the privi. leRe of her intimraoy, and nothing could exceed the activity of her zeal in behalf of those who ia any way depended or had any claim on her support or assistance. Herself an artist of no inconsiderable merit, she keenly enjoyed and appreciated every branch of art. From her earliest to her latest days her acquaintance 'was songht and valued by artists, and, indeed, by all who by their genius and industry bad gained high profesional distinction for tbemselves. Without having aimed at literary reputation, she wasin the habit of contributing to theamusementof society by opuwcula, in 'which her playful and harmless wit was manifested, and wbere she showed how she could use the weapons of ridicule witbout wounding, and be humorous without being satiricaL A few of these compositions haveappeared in rint, and met with the popularitythey merited. It may we be conceived that the loss of a person of such rare merit must be the sub. ject of unspeakable grief to the few who have the best riaht and the greatest cause to mourn, hut it is impossible tat their feelings should not be shared with more or less intensity by all who lived in the enjoyment of social interourse wvith her, and with such regrets may be intermingled the melancholy reflection that she wtas nearly the last survivor of that brilliant circle which Mr. Canning gathered round him atGlocester-lodge nearly hbaf a century ago,when he w e zenith of his popularity and fame, and where Lady Morley, in the bloom of beauty and sparkling with gaiety and wit, was the most charming of the women who adorned that unrivalled society. ENGLIsa TUAVELLIS AND RoNmA BRIGANDS.-Onl Mondayeveningat7 o'clockavetturino carzriae was plodding its weary way from CivitaVecohia towards Rome, and had reached a spot four miles on this side of Palo, 'when its further progress was opposed by seven bandits anrmed with bludgeons, pistols, and daggers, 'who stopped the vehicle, and proceeded to rifle the passengers, consisting of Dr. Conolly, Roman Catholic Bihop of Halifax, on his way to Rome to pay homaae to the supreme head of the church, Mr. Blake, and Mr. and Mrs. Harper. The bishop was eased of 14111., besides his episcopal chain and cross, and tbepastoral ring, a fine emerald, which he wore, according to custom. iMr. Blake, feeling greatly averse to submitting to spoliation, in his turn manfully resisted the outlaws' invitation to stand and deliver, but he was fin.1ly overpowered by numbers, after being severely beaten and having had a pistol presented at his head, which fortu. nately missed fire. MIr. and Mrs. Harper were robbed of tbeir 'watcbeq, chains, and purses, and altogether the *,lunder reidized by the marauders may be valued at about 1,000 scudli, or over 2COl.-tYlob~e. Fis.E LN WIITECHkrEL.-A fire took place on Monday night In the premises belonging to Mr. G. Bennett, hoeier and outfitter,' No. 100, High-street, Whitechapel. It was caused by soine articles coming in contact with a gas burner, and which becoming ignited firedfseveral other things, nd, beforeany attempt could be made to extingish them, the flams rearhed tha roof of the hoase. The various persons in tho sbop and other parts of the house were enabled, but not without eonsiderable difficulty, to effect a safe retreat.

"They set forth the indomitable courAge and porseverane, tho heroic self-devotion and fortitude, the steady dlscipline, and stern reeolve of English soldiers. " There is no mistaking the earnestnu of purpose with vhich the straggle has been malntained by Major-General Wilson's army. Every heart was in the cause; and while their numbers were, according to all ordinary rule, fearfully unequal to the task, every mau ha given his aid, wherever and m whatever manner it could most avall, to hasten retribution upon a treacheroos and murderous foe. " In the name of outraged humanity, in memory of innocent blood ruthlessly shed, and in acknowledgment of the first signal vengeance inflicted upon the foulest treason, the Governor-General in Council records his gratitude to MajorGeneral Wilson and the brave army of Delhil He does so inthesure conviction thatalike tribute awaits them, not In England only, hut wherever within the limits of civllization the newrs of their well-earned triumph shall reach The General Order then confirms the praise bestowed upon the officers under the command of General Wilson expressing the cordial thanks of the Governor-GeneraL
RUGBY SCBOOL. In consequence of Dr. Goulburn's resignation of the head-mastership, both the ol2 and present Rugbe2ans hd determined to present him with a piece of plate, asa mark of their personal esteem and regard for him. Many old Rugbeians came down on Saturday, and in the evening a most excellent conoert was given by the Rugby School Choral Society. The first part consisted of selections from JTudas MaccIaetus, and the admirable manner in which the choruses were rendered reflects the highest credik on Mr. Walker, the school organist. The entertainment gave the most unmixed satisfaction toa crowded audience. Monday had been fixd for the presentationof the plate, and, notwithstanding the erly hour (9 o'clock), there were a oonsiderable number of vidtors in the Great School, where the school and a large body of old iiugbeians were assembled. The Head of the tchool, Mx. A. Sidgwick, first addressed Dr. Goulburn, and in a few words expressed how sorry the school would be to let Dr. Goulburn leave without presenting some token of their respect and gratitude for all he had done for them, and concluded with a hope for Dr. Goulburn's health and happiness wherever he should hereafter dwelL He then presented the piece of plate, which consisted of a very handsome clook, with a silver laew, surrounded by black marble, and surmounted by a statue of Theology, with appropriate emblems. On the plinth was a bas-relief in silver of the school chapel, to the adornment of which the late Head-raaster has, by his liberality and good tate, so argely conributed. The Inscription is as follows:- V . R. EDOVAILDO ME1RIC GovLBUPu, S. T. P., "SCHOLAB RUOBnsrsmS ALvmcNr ' Hoc BrVVScvriM, "c xVBrxRETA Gs.A11 AmA , " DnDIcAvERvNT." Dr. GOuLBBux, after expressing the great pleare which the presentation gave him, went on to tell the assembled school what his wishes for their future were,-that they might not only be distinguished in the universitieg, which be considered as certain as if he had already the calendar before him, but that [they might be true workers in the cause of good, and, finally, true English Churchmen. He added, that " of all the troubles and anxieties which beset the master of a great school the conduct of the boys themselves might form a large part; but that the boys with whom he had had to do had been extremely docile and affeotionate; that, above all, their behaviour as a congr gation had been to him a never-failing source of pleasure; that the chapel" (represented on the piece of plate before him) " had been the happiest scene of his labours." He concluded with several remarks which were to those present and interested most affecting,-too much so to be represented through the public press. The Rev. HL A. PIAIIARD, student of Christ Church, next, on behalf of the old Rugbeiaus, begged Dr. Goulburn to accept of a mark of personal esteem from his former pupis, whose friendship he had conciliated by his warm and cordial manners, by the conscientious way in which he bad discharged the duties of his arduous poaition, and by the earnestness which marked all his words and actions. Mfr. Pickard also alluded to the enlargement of the School-cloe, and to the kindness with which Dr. Goulburn had promoted those manly games which conduce so much to the training of a healthy mind After expressing a hope for Dr. Goulburn's future succesi Mr. Piokard satd, " he trusted that the friendship com. menced at school rnight be cemented by the proceedings of the day and never cease," concluding inthe words of Jeremy Taylor, "A good man Is the best friend, and therefore soonest to be chosen, longer to be retained, and, indeed, never to be parted with, unless he cease to be that for which he was chosen." He then presented the plece of pla'e which consisted of a msgnificent centre-plece, with emblematical figures on the base and the following inscription:- EDOVARDO MxsYRIcx GOULBnuRX, S.T.P., SCHOLE RvGBEINsTs VIIT. ANNOS PRASIDr, HUMA,NO, MUNIFICO, Pro., NON ILr1ZxIORs Dvicis PvxRITiAE, D.D. Disciprr MAGISTRO Amco AhUcr, XIX. KAL. JAN. A.D. 1857. The applause which greeted this spoech having subsided, Dr. GOULBURNI thanked the numerous subscibsrs, not only for their handsome gift, but also for having taken the trouble to come from different parts of Englmnd to present it. He expressed the gratification which he had experienced when he foand from Mr. Pickard's address that the presentation, which he had supposed would take merely an official turn, was accompanied by the expression of personal feelings so strong and friendly, and that simultaneously from so many quarters. It was far beyond anything he had looked for, and he felt unable adequately to respond, for he could do no justice to his feelings. He withdrew amid enthusiastic and oft-repeated cheering.
SHOEBLACK SOCIETY.-On Monday evening the boys belonging to the East London 1sgwged School aid Shoeblack Society and fiefuge vere eutertained at tea at the premises belonging to the Young Men's Christian Assoclation, in Aldersgate-street.

SUPPOSED MUtDEE AT MIDDITON, NORFOL.- Information vwas received yesterday from the Homeoffice to the effect that a strit investigation should take place into the circumstances attending the finding of a human skeleton, supposed to be the remains of a gentleman named Bell, 'who was missed at Middleton eight years ago and has never since been heard of, and who was supposed to have been foully murdered at that place. It appears that this Mr. John Bell, at the time of his disappear&nce, was living upon his private means, and had reached nearly fourscore yearv. Be had several relatives who exerted themselves to the utmost to discover when and under what circumstances his disappearance took place. All, howvever, thatcould be elicited was that, on the 13th of November, 1849, the old gentleman was seen walking near a bridge In the vicinity of a field called, in the neighbourhood, the Four-Mile Field, on the London-road. An inquiry was set on foot, and rewards were offered from time to time till they Increased to the sum of 120M Even that inducement failed to lead to any satisfactory result. In addition every river in the neighbourhood for some miles round 'was dragged, and every expedient that the circumstances of the case suggested was adopted. Daring these investigations a hat was found that was supposedte belongto the mising gentleman; and a canvas purse and a large knife were also fowad in a dratn near Middleton. The purse, which was quite empty, was identified by his niece as the propertv of the missing man. The search continued for some months, bat no further clue of any kind being obtained it gradualy cooled, and eventually ceased altogether. A few days ago a human skeleton was accidentally dug up. The site of the discovery is a small triangular-shaped piece of land adjoining Townlane, leading from the Norwich taurptie road. Theground was formerly part of the property of a Mr. Wythes who some years ago sold it to Mr. Edward Chilvers. It remained in his possession some time, and about IS months ago he sold it to a Mr. John Wicks, in whose possession it was at the time of the discovery. In the course of last. week Mr, Wicks ordered somae of his labourersmto plough this field; and while one of the men (Burton) was digging down about 15 inches below the surfaco his spade came in cont.ct with some bones. He proceeded to clearthe earth avway, and mare beame visiblel, antil 'what appeared to be a vwhole skleton. 'was exposad to view. Tbe position ;nx which the skeleton wasfound was peculiar. le was lying. on the hack, but the head and legs 'were raised ratherabove t trunk, and one leg was crossed over the other zear the anole. .l appeared that the body had been thrust into a hole not sufldcenl long to allow of its lyimg at full length Upon or near the chees was found a piece of cerroded steel, inrusted with dixt, and bearing an exact resemblancQ to an ordinary razor blade. In aet, from snubquent iave,tig&tion there is no 'aoubt ihut suck is the ease. The labourers being iga'.want or sareless did not attach nuclb impertnce to tb a tiseovery, and began to recover the bones 'with the F,ojL The rumow, however, won spread, and their master., accompanied by tke Rev. Canon Kersley, the rector of tb a parish, went to the spot and stopped their frther procee. Jings. The bones were subeequently exhumed in the most r areftil manner, and decently conveyed to the parish chur' ,b Two mnedica men, Mescsrs. Kendall and Conicher, v sre then called in, and made a minute examination of them, and they gave it as their opinion that it w sthe skeleton of a man who had been buried for some Ye rs. The skull 'was brocen in several pieces, the Haw 'w: - fractured; but a good set of teeth remained. Suppo Ation immediately became rife in the neighbourbood ' ,at the remains were those of old Mr. John Bell, or thoer' of some other man who had been murdered in a mT sterlous manner, and whose body had been hastily interred. IB formation was conveyed to Mr. Wilkin, the coroner of 4,he district, who came down, and in the presence of the medieal men and others, viewed the remains. He then summoned a jury, 'who have since met, and after a view the coroner informed them that, as the case 'was so mysterions, they could not at present come to any decision, that ha should adjourn the inquiry, and lay the facts of the caso before Sir George Grey, the Homo Secretary, and request the advice and assistance of the Government upon the sub. ject. In tbe meantime the most energetic inquiries would be made by the police, and he hoped the next time they met be bhould be in a position to lay such evidenoe before them as would enable them to arrive at a satisfactory solution of this mystery. The jury assented to this mum,e ud thg lnquiry was adjourned.
JUDIOIAL COAMMITTEE of the BIVY COUNCIL, Dec. 15. THE CITY OF LONDON-COLLISION. (Before Loard WSNSLLYDALE, .r. PEIBDETON LEGHr, and Sir J. DODSON. This was a damage suit promoted by the owners and crew of the smack Celerity, 64 tons, and the owners of her cargo, against the City of London. 722 tons, a steamship belonging to the Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company. On the 3d cf January last the CeleriTty was proceeding from the Browyn Bank fishing ground, in the NTorth Sea, to London, with a sargo of fish, and at about 7 o'clock in the evening she wvas hove to near the Gunileet Sand, at the month of the !lixamee, in order that her mainsail mnight be reefed. She weather was clear and the moon shining, but the wind was blowing hard. The City of London, on her way fsom London to Aboerdeen ran into her and she went down bead foromost in less tian two minutes. The mate mnd an apprentice were drowned, and the master and the rest cf the cremw were saved by gettlng into the boat, and then en board the steamer. No light was shown by the smack, Lut it was alleged that the sight was so clear that the stamer must have seen her if a good look out had been kept in titne to have avoided the collision, and that the smaok herself was unable to take any step for that purpose, because she was lying nearly dead upon the water. The ease of the City of London was that she was keeping a good look out and showing proper lights, but in consequence of no light being shown by the smack she was unable to see her until it wras too late to avoid the colhison; that diectly she saw the smack she Ported her helm and stopped her engines, and thawt the smack ldone was to blame for the ident, not having done anything to get out of the way of he steamer, although s¢he was lying Ln the fair way or ordinary track of vessels, and she saw the steamer at a distance of two mile.. It was also contended on behalf of the tmship that the smack not having complied with the Admiralty Regulations of 1852 with regard to the exhi; bition of lights, she was prevented from recovering by the 298th section of the Moerchant Shippig Act (17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 104). The Admiralty Court, assited by the Trinity Brethren, took this view of the case, and dismissed the sUit with costs. Against that decision the Celerity now appealed, Mr. FORSYTH, Q. C., and Dr. JEx.=R were heard In support of the appeal. The Queen's Advocate and Mr. J. Wilde, Q. C., appeared for the respondents, but were not called upon for their argument. Lord WE:.SLEYDALI said the case had been extremely well argued on the part of the appellants, but their Lord. ships were clearly of opinlon that the appelants had not succeeded in satisfygthem that the blame of the collison was attributable to the steamer. If their Lordships enter. tained any doubt on the question they would be hound to give the benefit of it to the party who had obtained the Judgment of the Court below, but they and their assessors concurred with the Court below and its assessors and the conclusion at which they had arrived. No doubt it was the duty of the smack to show lights, and it was clear upon the evidence that if lights had been shown the collision would ,,ave been avoided. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs, and the judgment of the Adimiralty Court affirmed, THE JONGE ANDRUES.-SALXAGE. This was a cause of salvage romoted by Sidney Halsey, the master, and the owners an rew of the fishing smack In. trepid, of Yarmouth, against the Dutch galliot Jonge Au. dries. The servioa was commenced on the 13th of November, 1856, about 50 mUes off Southwold, and continued until the 17th, when the gallot was taken Into Lowestoft Harbour. The Jonge Andries is a Russian vessel, 118 tons burden, and was bound at the time in question from Cronatradt to the river hIaas with a cargo of rye. The owners disputed the claim on the ground that it was a pilotage service, and in support of their case produced the following agreement signed by Captain Steffans and by Sidney alsey .- "The undersgned Captain A. Steftas6 of the shiD De Jouge S.nduies, a%Onowredgsa to haye engaged la pilot aid to sau a-head C&PtaiS, dDiwai, for the price of so, ay £5. At Sea, 13ah of Novemo The salvore alleged that this aeeement was signed by Sidney Halsey, in conee" ence of his having been deceived k the master of the gaNi.t as to her true state, and a1lo Wat the service rendered amounted to a salvage service. The learned judge of the Court of Admiralty, bowvever, held t-hat no deception bad been practised, and that theo claim for a salvage service was harred by the agreement, and pro-nounoed that th tender of 501. made by the Jonge Andries -was sufficient. The Intrepid now appealed against that decision. Mr. Forsyth, Q.C., and Dr. Jenner were counsel for the Balvors; Mr. J. Wilde, Q.C., and Dr. Addams for the owners. At the conclusion of the appeollant case, Mr. P. LEIGH delivered judgment. He said that In construing the agreement upon which the respondents relied their Lordshtps must look at the circumstances underwhich and the relative positions of the parties by whom it was made. The vessel in this case being in considerable difficulties, and requiring assitance, the master hailed a fishing smack, and entered into an agreement with a person who was not following the profession of a pilot to render him the assistance he required. Their Lordships had been much struck with one art of the judgment of the Court below. The learnod udge rsaid it would be a most dangerous doctrine to hold that a pUot by assisting in pumping and doing other work could convert a pilotage service ano salvage service. In that opinion their Lordaships entirely concurred. Holding that opinion, and considering the cireumstances under which the agreement was made, they had come to the conclusion that all the services rendered were included in the agreement ; that the salvors were entitled to no additional componsation beyond the 501, ; and that the judgment of the Court below must bo affirmod with costs.
LA W BBiPO1T. COURT OF CHANCERY. ImcoTN's.iiN. Dxa,. 15. IN LUNACY.-RE ARM,StTha (Befor6 the LORD CnARNCELLOR, and the LORDS JUSTIOS of APTP AT.-. Mr. Cairns and mr. W. Morris appeared In support of an application in this matter for leave to file a bill to stav a sale which had been advertised for Wednesday next. Xt 'was stated that Mr Armstrong was a lady of large fortune, asd lived apart from her husband on her separate Property In the month of August last, at the instance of her husband, Mr Armstrong was found lunatic, but, having escaped to France, she in the month of November obtained leave to sraverse the inquisition, whiyh has not wet been tried. Mrs. Armstrong had a residence at Klensington, the furniture in wvhich it was alleged had been purchased out of the separate estate. This furniture was now advertised for sale by the husband, and it was to stay such sals that the present motion was made. Mr. JOLLIFFE, on behalf of Captain Armstrong, submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court, and said that if the Court thought the sale ouxht not to take place hewould not put Mrs. Armatrong to ae a bill The learned counsel alleged that the furniture had not yet been paid for, and that the husband was being sued for it. Under these eircumstances it was contended that the husband had a perfect right to seU the furniture. The CoURT directed the sale to be stayed, except as to ary articles the parties might mutually agree upon as proper to be sold. The rest of the application must be referred to the Master in Lunacy. Ordered accordingly. IN BANKRUPTCY.-LOITHOUSE V. TRF WELSE POTOSI LEAD AND CO.PPXR MINING COMPANY. This was an appeal petition from an order of Mr. Com*-issioner Fano, plaoing the name of Mr. Lofthouse upon the list of contributories of the above-mentioned company. It appeared that the comnany was originally formed upon the eost-hook principle in the year 1853, for the purpose of working the Bsgairbril and E9galrfraith lead and copper mines in CArdiganshire. The company conducted business down to June, 1857, when it was registered as a " limited" company under the provisions of the Joint-Stock Companies Act, 1856 (19th and 20th of Vic. torla, chap. 47), for the purpose, as was stated, of having the affairs wound up in bankruptcy. At any rate an application was shortly afterwards made to Mfr. Commissioner bane for a winding-up order, which he made. The case of the petitioner, Mr. Lofthouse, was that he took a number of shares In the company as at first constituted, but trans. ferred them to a person named Slaek In the month of Jau. nary, 1857, some six months before the company was registered as " limited." This transfer was made In conformity with ono of the rules of the company in the cost book, which stated that from the time of the transfer the trans. ferror was freed from all liability on behalf of the oompany. By the 63d seotion of the above-mentloned statute It is enacted- '"That a ebareholder in a limited company, who has ceased to be a sharebolder within oae yer tor to the commencement of the winding up of the company, ahal be deemed for the pu:rrse of contribu tion towards payment of the oompanY's debts to bi n exIstig abase. elaoler, and be subJect to the same liablliAes to creditors as if he bad not so oeased to be a abseholder." Itiwas under these cireumstaneese the commissioner placed the name of Mr. Lofthouse on the list of contributories, together with that of Mr. Slack, holding the intentionx of Parliament to have been to keep the transferror of shares able to the company, and merely giving him a right over aalginst his transferree, From this decison Mr. Loft. Loe pedled. The matter was first brought before the aod lsie of Appeal, but was considered of such Impotnce that it was p laced In the pape of the full Court. T contnton on be3 al of the appelunt was that, as he had transferred his share before the comrn latred under the Jolnttook Companies Ac he indinged order had been made in respect of a company to whic be never belonged. The order was supported on the ground that the case came within the C3a clause of the statute, as Mr. Lofthouse had not ceased to be a shareholder for one year before the making of the, winding-up order. The case is the first that has arisen under the statute. bMr. Bacon anId Mr. D)orla appoared for the appellantMr. Selwyn and Mr. Roxburgh in support of the order. The LoRD CHAkNCELLOR, 'without calling for a reply, de. livered the judgment of thae cout ad said it was plain that the decision of the Commissioner could not he sustained. The first point was that the transfer waa ficttious one. That, however, was entirely immnateria, as by one of the rules of the oompany any shareholder migbt eti ofg alle liabiit by AUiterst the company, and at an tm allgivebl up ty bYvig cr notice adthe. fore If the Court weore d upon to pronounce an opinion respecting the transfer, It would hold that the transaction was entered into bod fie, as the compny hbad not demrured to it. By tha step Mr. Lofthouee oeaed to be a partner in the company In the month of January, 1857, and In the month of June following the company was incorpora%ted under the Joint-stock Comp4mies Act, 1856, probably with the view , as had been suggested, of having Its affair wound Up. If that were the object, there was nothing in it to make th. parties ashamed of their conduct. After the order for the winding up of the oompany the Commissione placed the names of Mr. Lofthouse and Kr. Slaek on the list of eontributorles, and the question for the Court to determine was whether he wax right In plaing tbe name of Mr. Lofthouse on such 1lt Now, Mr. Loftbouse was not o- the list of shareholders at the time that the company Wag registered as a "limited" one in June, 1857. By the statute under consideration the existing sharebolders of the company were prlmarily liable for the company's debts, and by the 63d section those persons who had been shareholders within one yesr of the winding-up order were then made liable. The Commissioner had placed the name of Mr. Lofthouse on the b't of contributories on the gronnd that he had- been a holder of shares within a year of the order for winding up; bat in his (the Lord Chancellor's) opinion thatconstrusilon of the Ackt was an entire rnistake. The word " shareholder" in the 63d section must mean a shareholder after the company bad been brought under the operation of the Act. If the other construction were the correct one monstrous injustice might be done, as at the time Mr. Lofthouse joined the company he knew what was his liabllity under the rules, but of course could not contemplate that after he had ceased to beapartnerinthecompanytheremaining partners had power by an alteration of the company to bring him under fresh liabilities. The general scope of the Act, moreover, proved that " shareholder" meant shareholder within the Act, and, therefore, as Mr. Lofthouse had ceased to be a partner in the company before it was registered under the Act, it stood to reaon that he was not a " shareholder" within the meaning of the Act. On that short ground the judgment of the Court below would be reversed, and the name of Mr. Lofthouse erased fromthe list of contributories, and also from the order for a calL Costs out of the estate. The LoRDs JuSTICES coneurred.

I VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS, TUXSDAY, Dxc. 15. LORD V. COLVn. I (Before Ykce-Chancellor Sir R. T. E3ND BSLET.) m1]e nearing oi znesecauses was resumed to-day, wnlen Mr. ROLThaving concluded his address, Mr. QrASsx followed on the same side; and on his Honour's return into court, after the usual temporary retirement at 1 o'clock, Sir FITzRoy K'ELLY Raid, that he wished to trespass on the attention of the Court for a few moments. He had conferred with the Attorney-q*eneral, and it seemed, as far as could be collected from the state of the other business before the Court, just possible, and only just possible, that the remainder of this case, as far as Mr. Glasse and Mr. Welford were concerned, could be heard during the remainder of the present sittingg, supposing that he (Sir Fitzroy Kelly) If physically able, should address the Court. There were two elements to be taken into consideretion, one his own personal inflrmity, which for three or four days would render it imposible for him to proceedwith his duty; and the other, that the Attorney-General was obliged to leave London on Saturday next. Under these circumstances it was proposed, with the sanction of the Court, that the whole of the remainder of the case should be now gone through, leaving it for him (Sir Fitzroy Kelly) and the Attorney-General to be heard at the earliest moment after the vacation. The VIcn-CsHA NcELoR asked If all the counsel cencurred in that proposition? EHe had himself been refleoting that there were only three or four more cause days now remimning before the Christmas recess, and It was problematical if even 81sx days would suffice, to conclude the case, considering the number of counsel yet to beheard. Therefore, if all partiea agreed to the course proposed, he would adopt that course, and adjourn the case after Mr. Glasse and Mr. Welford had been heard, hear Sir Fitzroy Kelly at the commencement of next termn for Mr. and Mr. Moorhouse, and then the Attor. ney-general in reply for Mr. Lord. The Court would then have the benefit of hearing a counsel on both sides after the Adjournment. Mr. AxDmxsox said, that no onehad any objection to such a course. Mr. GLASSE suggested that this Arrangement should be made publio, inasmuch as parties who were interested in causes standing after " Lordv. Colvin" might not be prepared to go on, thinking that it would occupy the rest of the sittings. The VICZ-CHANCELLOR said, that he would give direc. tions that it should be posted up in the office and the court. (Before. Yice-Chance or Mr J. STrT.) SMITH V. PILEfGTON. This was a bill by a member of the building sooety called the Glocestershire andCheltenham AnnuityFund and Mutual Benefit Society, against the directors and managing body of that association ror the redemption of a mortgage granted by the plaintiff to the society, and for a declaration by the Court that the plaintiff Was entitled, on suoh redemption, to a bonns of 251. on each of four shares held by him thereiu. The biU also prayed for an account; and the material question was whether, under the circumstances of the case, the plaintiff was precluded from obtabinng a redemption on the terms asked by him-viz., his being declared entitled to the before-mentioned bonus. The case occupied tho Court almost the -whole day, but it was quite devoid of general intrest. The evidence was very lengthy. Mr. Msllns and Mr. Hlardy were for the plaintiff; Mr. Bacon and Mr. Jessel for the defendants. The VICE-CHANOnnLOn made a deoree declaring the plaintiff entitled to the bonus of 25t. on ecoh of his shares, and for an account, and, after expressing his regret that so small a sum as that in dispute should have been made the ocoasion of a costly litigation, said, that he should make no other order as to CoStS than an order allowing to the plaintiff and defendants no more than 601. respectively out of the funds of the society in respeot of their costs up to the hearing of the cause. (Before Vice-ChanceZlor Sir W. P. WOOD.) BROWNE V. THE LONDON NECROPOLIS AND NATIONAL MAUSOLEUM COMPANY. The arguments in this case were resumed. Mr. Greene and Mr. Dauney followed Mr. Cairns on behalf of the plaintitIs ; Mr. Daniel (with whom was Mr. Osborne) supported the plaintlff's case; Mr. Shapter, Mr. Fooks, Mr. Hardy, and llXr. Biron appeared for other defendants, but took no part in the areuent. The Attorney-General, on behilf of the company, had not concluded his argument for the defence at the rising of the Court.
COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, GIThDHALL, DEC. 15. B3RASS AND ANOTHER V. BAITLAED. tJtutngt at NU Prius, before Lord CAmrBELL and Speciaz Juries.) Lord UAImrBELL said, that on considering the finding of the jury in this ease be was of opinon it smounted to a verdict for the defendant; he adhered, however, to the opinion he had given on the argument of the demurrer, that it was the duty of the owner of goods of a dangerous nature shiped on board a general ship, when the nature of them cou l not bo known from their appearance or from informa. tion given to the owners of the ship, to give notice of their dangerous nature; and he likewise thought It would be no defence on the part of the shipper merely to show it was the fault of some person whom he employed to pack the goods. In this case, however, the jury expressly found that the packages were sufficient, and that the nersons employed by the owners of the ship ought to have linown the nature of t Fhe goods. BROlVN V. BROW-. Mr. Knowles and Mr. Unthank were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. H, Hill and Mr. R. Clark appeared for the defendant. This was an action of ejectment to recover possession of a house and demesne called Cliff-house, near Whitby, formerly the property of Mr. WiUiam Brown. The plaintiff, Mr. William Brown, claimed as eldest son and heir at law. The defendant, Mrs. Amelia Brown, his mother, the widow, claimed under a 'will dated the 6th of November, 1846. The only question was whether that will had been revoked by circumstances whioh subsequently took place; there was no hostility between the parties, but it was necessay to have the verdict of the jury to bind all those taking interest under the will. The late Mr. Brown had four sons and two daughters; for some time previous to 1846 he was on bad terms with the plaintiff, his eldest son, and by the will he only left him an annuity of 50t. a-year, and 2,000. to his ohildren on his death, the annuity not to commence tlll six mon'hs after the death of the present defendant. The bulk of the property was left to four trustees, of whom she was one, In trust to pay her the rents for the support of herself and chUidren; after her death, to the five children (excluding plaintiff) for life, remainder to their children, This will the testator gave to his wife to take care of. In 1855 he was reeonciled to hls eldest son, who went to live with him. Some time In June, 1855, he asked his wife for the will, stating he was going to Mr. Breckon, his solcitor, to make a new one. He called there, and gave instructions for the putpose. The draught wa prepared and approved, and the wll afterwards engrossed bzMr. Breokon hlnaelf, as the testator did not wish any cerk to know the contents; he called at the office on the 21st of July, 1855, and executed it In the preeence of Mr. Breckon and a Mr. Steyenson, who happened to be there at the time. He took the will with him, stating he would leave it at his banker's, and, in order to keep Its provisons secret, he got the draught and burnt it. He died on the l9th of Februay, 1857. Search was then made for the second wi3L It could not be found; but the wiU of 1846 was found in the pocket of testator's great coat where it had laid for saome time. The provisions of the second will were totally inconsistent with the first ; Cliff House and the furniture were given ab3olutely to his wife and an annuity of 3001. a-year. The residue of the realty and personalty was given to two trastees, to be divided, subject to the annulty, between his six children. He was possessed of about 40,0001. real and 10 0001. personal estate. Forthe plaintiff It was contended that the second will bel2ng inconsistent wilth the first operated as a total revocation of it, and under the 22d secton of the Willx Act the mere loss or destrction of the second would not amount to a republicaion of the first, and therefore that the testator had died intestate.

This was an action for br-ah of an agreement t. .enter into p&rtnersahp. The defendant pleaded fraud. It appeared that the plaintiff, Mr. A. MI. Baker, is son of Mr. Charles Baker, who had been engaged in busines as a tfimber rmerchant at Southampton for same years ; that buisiness was very profitable, hut in consequence of other saculations he got embarrassed, and determ ned to give up tne timber business to his son, the plaintiff, An advertise. ment for a Ipartner who could command 2,0001. was inserted in 2'kc Times, and answered by the defendant, who is a genitleman of property rediding In Montpellier.sqaare Brompton. Some negotiation took place; he went down to Southampton and examined the books , the plaintiff stated the average profits for some years, ending 1855, to bh 9251. per annuma; the accounts for 1856 and the early part of 1857 were nob gone Into. On the 224 of Ma6y articles of agreement for a partnership of three years between the plaintiff and defendant were signed. The defendant then consulted his attorney, further inquiries were made. and he refused to carry out tho greement. The plaintiff's farther was gazetted a bankrupt on the 22d of July, and his balance-sheet when filed showed that his business had been a losing one for some time previous, but it was contended by the plaintiff that the losses arose froa other transactions, that the timber business always left profit, and if the defendant's capital had been introduced it would have been extremely profitable. The defence was that on the examination of the accounts it was found that the timber trade produced nothing in 1S56, and only 3001.:in 1855; that, in point of fact, it had entirely died out when the negotiation took place between the arties. In June there was no stock on the premises. Under the bankruDtey of Mr. Baker, 8ea., no assets were realized. and his furnitare 'as held uacler a distress for rent. The defendant was not a man of business, and did not understand accounts. When he went to examine the books he was entirely in the plaintff's hands. The jury foand a verdict for the Plaintiff-Damages, 5001. FL=ENG V. SMrTs. Sir F. Theelger, Air. Prentice, and Mr. Murray were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. O'Malley, and Mr. Honyman appeared for the defendant. The plaintiff is public officer of the Western Bank of Scotland, ad the action was brought against the defendant, a warehouseman in London, a the endorser of two bills of exchange, one for 3241. 12a. 10d., dated the 16th of May, 1857, and the'other for 4251. 2s. 2d., dated the 26th of May, drawn by a Mr. J. H. Anderson -on Mr. A. L. Be"'ger. The defendant denied his endorsement. Mr. PsTBrio stated that the biUls in question had come into the hands of the bank through Messrs. Monteith and Co., of Glasgow. That firm had large transactions with a Mr.War wick, In London, and early this year one of the partners was introducediby him to the defendant, -with a view to future transactions between them. The bills in question were handed to Mr. Warwick by the defendant to be forwarded to Glasgow to Messrs. Monteith for the purpose of being discounted, the arrangement being that they should retain the proceeds for 14 days as a remuneration to them. The 14 days elapsed, and, as the money was not remitted, Mr. Warwiok proceeded to Glasgow and got 1,1001. from Messrs. Monteith, and of which he paid 8001. to the defendant. The bllls not being pald when due, an action was commenced against the defendant under the Bils of Exchange Act, and in his affidavit in support of his application to be let in to defend, the only defence set up was that the bills had been endorsed to the bank by Monteith and Co. after they became due, and said not a word of the alleged forgery. Mr. Charles Warwick.-I am a warehouseman in Friday. street. The defendant carries on buslness in Bow Churohyard. I had many transactlons with Messrs. Monteith and Co. They were in the habit of discounting for me the acceptances of my customer. Iintroduced W. Monteith to the defendant in April last; that was the first time they met personally, but before that Monteith and Co. had two bllU transactions with tho defendant. Mr. Monteith offered defendant to discount any of his bils at the London rate, romitting the proceeds in 14 days. On the 28th of May defendant asked me to get four bills, including the two in question, discounted under this arrangement. He (the defendant) gave me the particulars of them on a piece of paper, but I gave It back to him last October, at his request. It w-s in these words .-"Two bllls drawn by Hayter on Hurrell, 4001. each; Anderson on Bellinger, 3241. 12s. 10d. and 4251. 2s. 2d.; underneath, " endorsed by J. Smith." The paper was in defendant's handwriting and stated the terms -" 8001. to be paid on the 14th of June, and balauce on the 20th." I wrote to Monteith, stating I had the four bhl', describing them as endorsed " J. Smitb," and offered Mon. teith a ride of 14 days if it would suit him to discount them, but that I would not send them unless another transaction was settled. NText day I got a telegram to sond the bills. I went to the defendant, got the bille,and forwarded them to Glasgow. Lord CAiPBmLL.-On this evidenee how can defendant deny his endoysement 2 MEr. O'MALLEY.-Re denies it is his handwriting. Lord CAO£xPB=.-That is no matter if he handed them over purporting to be endorsed. Mr. O'MALXY.- He denies they endorsed when he did. Examination continued.-I had not the bills in my hands for more than half-an-hour. The proceeds did not come to hand wIthin 14 days. I went to Glasgowe bout the 18th of June, and got 1,1001. from Monteith on account of these and other bills. I paid 4501. to defendant on the 21st of June, 1001. on the 24th, and 2501., less discount, on the ist of September. I paid the last in consequence of a letter from the defendant, caUing on the latter to give him the money or the bills. I am acquainted with defendant's handwriting. I should consider the endorsement on the biUs is his writing, but for other circumstances. Cross-examined.-It was not part of the arrangement between tionteith and Co. and the defendant that they were to give him other bils as secaurity for the 14 days. The words, "E Endorsed J. Smith" on the piece of paper handed me by defendant applied to all four bills. I had not seen the bills when I wrote to Monteith on the 28th. Belinger was a stockbroker In London. It could not be a trade bill between him and the defendant ; traders have a general objection to place their niames on bills that are not trade bils. It was about half-past 5 o'clock when I got the bills from the defendant. The two bills now produced are those drawn by Hayter on Hurrell. (The bills were read; they did not appear to be endorsed by defendant.) The four biUs were given tome folded up. Defendant said, "I wll not endorse those bills." I replied, " There is no need for it." I afterwards opened the bills. No doubt I looked at the endorsements. I think if defendant's endorsement was there I should recollect It. I cannot state what names were there. I cannot say whether defendant's name was there or not. The defendant was in the habit of endorsing " Jno. Smith." The bils in this action are endorsed " John Smith" in full. I never saw defendant write his name on a bill in that form. On one bill are the words, " 2 Bowchurchyard." They are not in his handwriting. I sent 1,0981. of bills to Monteith on the 19th of May, and the 1,1001. I got was on account of'alL iAl cannot say whether he then had any of the bills in his possession. He first gave me a check for 8001 for Smith. He did not say for which bills. I said nothing about any of the biUls in particular. I paid Smith the 8001., deduoting the discount oa Hayter's two bills. Re-examined.-I had no interest in the defendant's four bills. I made an affidavit in this cause. At the conclusion of this witnes's examlnation the far. ther hearing of the case was adjourned to this mornisg. SECOND COURT. (Before Mr. Justice ERLE and a Secicd Juries.) BIRCH V. JURY. Mr. Macauley and Mr. Raymond were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Knowles, Mr. H. Smith, and Mr. Hurrell appeared for the defendant. The plaintiff, Sir Thomas B. Blrch, is one of the directors of the Liverpool and London Fire and Life Insurance Com. pany, and the action was brought in his name, to recover from the defendant, who is an auctioneer and surveyor residing in London, the amount of loEs sustained by the company through his negligence. He had been employed in his professional capacity to advise as to tte sufficiency in point of value of certain premises which had been proposed to the company as securit? for a mortga e, and it was alleged he had so grossly failed m point of skill, or had so negligently performed his duty, as to induce the company to advance 7,500l. on his representation that the property was worth 1,1001., whereas the actual value fell very far short of that sum. The case had been tried before and a verdict pased for the plaintiff, damages ls., which was afterwards set aside on payment of costs by the plaintiff. Thepremises in uesti belonged to a Mr. Howard, and were situated atMistley and Manningtree, in Eeex. Prior to 1851 they had been mortgaged for the sum of 3,0001., but Mr. Howard being desirous to obtain a further advance of 8,000!, applied to the defendant, who made application to Mr. Henderson, the secretauy of the plaintiff's company; some negotiatioa took place, and It was ultimately arranged that the defendant should go down, examine the property, and report on its value. The report was made in due course and on the faith of It the company agreed to advance 7,500!. Up to 1854 the interest on the mortgage was paid by Mtr. Howard, but in that year he be- came a bankrupt, and the property was thrown on the company's hands; they put it up for sale, but they could not get an offer; they then offered It to the defenidant for the amount due on foot of the mortgage, but he declined to take it and denied hlsresponsibllity; a small portion had since been sold at a rate far below the defendant's estimate, and the portion still in the possession of the corpany was stated to be far below the value placed onIthy him. A number of witnesses were rcalled In suppport of the plaintiff's case, and It was distinctly stated that at the time the money was advanced the proprty could not have beens worth more than For the defence it was oontended that the property was well wrorth the amounut at which the defendant had valued it, and that he had exercised due diligence and skill in his survey, and several witnesseS were called to prove the cor,rectness of his valuation. I. Mr. JTustice Ens,'s, in summing up, told the jury that if the defendant h;ad acted bon4 MIle and exercised competent I sil and dilgence he was not liable for a saistake, The jury found a verdict for the defendant,

(Before Mr. JU;ice CRESSWL and a Common Jury.) THF ENGLISH AND FOPHG? I= ASSURANCO COMPANT V. SH]WIER. Mr. Hindmarsh appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Grove, Q.C., and Mr. Hughes for the defendant. This was an action to roover the sum of 350L under a covenant contained in a deed executed by the defendaat. and the question raised for the determination of the jarr was whether the deed was the deed of the defendant. A person named Jenkins appled to the insurance oompany for a loan of 3501., and the company agreed to advance thi money provided that he procured two sureties. Jenkia, named the defendant and another person. The deed was iaD *rusted to Jenlins to be executed by the defendant, who is a builder at Cardiff, and the oWher surety. The deed wve, returnied purporting to be execoted by the defendant, bat there not being any attesting witness the company en. trusted the deed again to Jenkins to have the execution witnessed. Jenkins went to thedefendant with an attorney's clerk named Pelly. The defendant then signed a paper, bat Felly did not sign his name as attesting witness until three. quarters of an hour had elapsed. Upon the deed being produced'in court Pelly was unable to May that it was the docomnent that the defendant executed. A Mr. Ensor, an attorney, and Mr. Hays were called to prove that they had been instructed by the company to see the defendant, andc on showing him his signature to the deed, the other part being covered, the defendant admitted that the signatureo was his, but on the whole deed being shown to him he repudiated it. Mr. Adlard, a persor skilled in the comparison of handwriting, was called, and on the deed and several checks having the defendant's signature being shown to him he gave his opinion that the handwriting was the same, and In answer to a question put by the larned Judge, said that the aignature to the deed appeared as if it had been painted, or gone over a second time. The defendant was called and said that Jenkins had asked him to sign a testimonal, and that the pper he signed in the p.-esence of Felly was the testimonial; and in proof of that e said that he gave to Jenkins at the time a small suma of money towards the testimonial, which was not denied by Pelly. He swore positively that the signature to the deed Verdict for the defendant. BRIGHT V. CO&NOP. Mr. Holl appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. G. Francis for the defendant. In this action the plaintliff a carpenter, sought to recover the sum of 651. 17s. 8d., the balance due to him for fitting up a coffeehouse for the defendant, No. 294, Oxford-street. TDhe defendant paid 18.lBs. 4d, into court, and denied bis liability for the residue. After hearing the evidence of three surveyors, who had carefully gone over the work to substantiab the defendant's viewr, the jury immediately found a verdict for the defendant. Mr. Justice CRESSWELL intimated that he should be unable to sit this day, and that Mr. Justice Crowder would sit for the Lord Chief Justice.
COURT OF EXCHEOUERI DT'. In MAILLEPRXE V. THE EQUITABLE :mR InSURAxCE oICE. ('S'fn9s at NiiPri-, at GuildhAl before 3r. Baron BRAXWVI and a S&eciu Jumn- mr. BoviMl and Mr. Jones were counsel for the plaintiff - Mr. Edwivn James and Mr. C. PoUock were counsel for the defendants. In this action,which has lastednmrlythree days,the plaintiff sought to recover 6361.? the anount of his lose sustained on the oceasion of a fire which occutred on his Premises on the night of the 23rd of July last. The clatm of the plaintlff, who carried on the business of a dealer in gIass, consiated of 6001. for stock and 36t. for furniture, and with respect to the first of these branches chiefly the defendants rested their opposition to the claim, on the ground that the value and extent of the property consumed was fraudulently exaggerated, whereby, under a clause of the policy to that effect, the claim became void. Upon the question thus raised there wa a great bodyof evidence adduced on both sides. The plaintiff relled on his Invoices, his friends who spoke to the contents of hbis house just before the fire, and the weighing of the ddbris about 12 weeks after the fire, when the ofEce gave up possession to the plainttff. On the part of the defendant strong reLiance was laid on certain alleged suspicious circumstances connected with the fire itself, and the fact, which was absolutely sworn to by the firemen, that when they vreighed the debris immediately after the fire the weight fell far short of what might be expected to result from such a stock as that alleged by the plaintiff to have been destroyed by the fire. Mr. Baron BRAJWEL, in SuMMing 1u the complicated and contradictory evidence in the case, left it to the jury to say whether they thought the defendants had made out their ple In order to do so, they were bound to prove something more tban exaggeration, which in such cases was not unprecedented, and to satisfy the jury that there had been a wilfully dishonest addition made to the real stock of the plaintiff - and if their minds remained in doubt on this matter the piaintiff would be entitled to a verdict, as the burden of proof on this issue, so all-important to himn rested with the defendants. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 425C. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, at GuiUdlW2 before the LORD CHnxF BARox and Common Juries.) The cases which came on for trial to-day did not justify a report.

Thomas Maxwell Hunt, of Otlton vicarage, clerk In holy orders, shareholders and contributors of the company. and the affidavit of Colonel Austin furnish a somewhat graphic and amusing description of the manner in which the Unadulterated Company is alleged to have set about the work of annihilating this fraudulent and dangerons system. Colonel Austin, in his affidavit, states:- "That, In October, 188. he wa introduced to Mr. W. Crlbb, general manager, and Mr. Henry Ealter, the secretary, promoters of the comn. snmy. le was told by them that the company wLs already in progrees; that nothIng would be done until £25.000 had been subEcribed; that he (Colonel Austin) should becomo a director cad receivet£100 per atnum.

Upon belng designted a director in December, 1856, he came up to town to take an actie part In the management, but wts Informed by Mr. Salter, the secretary, that no board would sit, as the eompany could not afford the fees, and thbA the manager (Mr. Oribb) and himself would do all. In January, 1857, he resigeed his eat, and, alter some difficulty, he got his namDe withdrawn from the proepectus. In Februar, 1857, a new directlon was formed. This included the names of Mr. Heneage and Captain PeeL He was Induced, upon strong representations that tbe n3ew board were a strong and Influoentlal body, to rejoin the direction, and in ApritL1857, ho andhis co-directors for the firnt tlmeobtalned peaeesalon of the nvlute and other books of the oompany and Inveatigated its sff tra.

INSOLVRENT DEBTORW COUBT, Dec. 15. IN RE S. J. HA.YS. I (Bcfore Mr. Commi&eo,ur MTrnTzsv lXtls insolvent, a beershopkeeper at Stratford, apphed to be discharged. Mr. Sargood 'opposed for the Sheriff of Aliiadlesex. It appeared that in March last the sheriff's officer levied an execution upon the goods of one Henwood, which were also seized under an execution for 1504, at the suit of the insolvent. The sheriff sold the goods, paid the amount af the finrst execution, and handed over a balance to the insolvent as the second execution creditor. The latter subsequently brought an action against the sheriff for not paying over the whole amount of the sale, but after a trial at Croydon assizes a verdict was returned for the defendant, who, however, had been put to 143L. costs in defending the action. The complaint was that the Insolvent's claim npon Hienvood was a concocted affair to defeat the execution creditor. The insolvent denied that he had sanctioned the commencement of the action against the sheriff; which he said wvas carnied on sgainst his wish by MEr. Grayson, his attorney. The learned Co.sssrssroyxR adjourned the case for the attendance of Mr. Grayson, observing that if ho should be of opinion that the insolvent had wilfully and wrantonly carried on the action against the sheriff he should p2ro. Dounce a remand as severe as the lawr would permit, but should it be proved that the man had been a dupe and a tool in the hands of his attorney, as wfas suggested, it w ould be a matter for the Law Society to lookc Into. si RB TllOhrAg BXECHI This insolvent, a shipvwright, at Poplar, was opposed by Mr. Denny and severdl creditors in person. It wras compblaied that, having thought fit to enter upon bnildinu speculations, at Bromley, he had raised money at 20 and 30 per cent., and having obtained goods a nd materials from various creditors he had mortgaged the houses upon which such materials wfere used, and had left the creditor8 unpaid. Mtr. Comm issioner MEURHlY regarded the oas0 as one of the most reckless instances of contracting debts that he had ever met with, and therefore ordered the insolvent's discharge to be delayed until the expiration of 14 calendar months f'rom the date of the vesting order. siS RE R.

Mr. M'Comus, a tilo1r in Dublin, wras a creditor for 30?. for clothes supplied in 1855. The insolvent admitted that be had been " cleared" of his debts mn 1854, aiter a previous confinement in the Dublin Marshalsea Prison. His debts nowr amomnted to 3,0001., a large portion of wrhich arose from bill transactions, The learned COsrsnSSxOZRm said the debts had been contracted without reasonable expectation of payment, and therefore the insolvent could not be disehargod until he had been in custody for a space of four calendar mnonths from te date of the vesting order (November 4).

CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, Dec. 15. OLD COURT. (Before the RECORDER.) William Atiwell, alias William Yalsh, 24, dewcribed ag a labourer, Edward Jackson, 31, painter, and Anne Jack. son, his wife, who surrendered to tAke her trlal, and who appeared to be very far advanced in the fansilyway, and Wm allowed to be seated in the dook, were charged with stealing a diamond necklaoe and a quantity of other articles of jewelry, lace, and other property, valued at 1,OOOl. in the indictment, but which was stated to be worth ia reality nearly 16,0001., and said to be the property of Francis Egerton, Earl of Ellesmere, sineo deceased. The prisoners were also charged withfeloniously receiving the property, knowing it to have been stolen. The prisoner AttweU pleaded " Guilty." Mr. Giffard appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Sleigh defended the female prisoner; and Mr. Cooper and Mr. F. H. Lewia were counsel for the prisoner Edward Jackson. The learned counsel for the prosecation, in opening the cae to the jury, said that the inquiry into which they erer about to enter arose out of a robbery that was committed on the 22d of January, 1856, on which day Lady EUes. mere was about to pay a visit to Her Majesty at Wind. sor, and the box containing the property in question was among her ladyship's luggage, and was placed on the top of a cab upon that occasion to be conveyed to the Great Western Railway station. Uppon the cab, however, arriving there it was discovered that the box, which contained a large quantity of valuable property, had been stolen during the journey between Bridgewater-house, the residence of her ladyship, and the railway station, aud, although aiU the xecesary inquiries were rmade br the polloe, and a lrge reward was offered, no traoe ws discovered of any portion of the contents of the box until a short time back, when in consequenoe of a statement made by the prisoner Atiwell, who was at the time under confinement for another offence, the prisoners were taken into custody, and the present obarge preferred against them. The learned counsel then proceeded to give a brief narrative of the facts he proposed to put in evidence, and said that the jury would not have to consider the case of Attwell, because he had pleaded guilty to the offence, and the only question for them wonld be we. tber the evidence brought home the charge to the other prisoners. As to the prisoner Edward Jackson, It appeared to him that the evidence could not leave any reasonable doubt that he had received the property knowing it to have been stolen; but with regard to the female prisoner, who stood in the position of his wife, he admitted that she could not in law be found guilty of the offence imputed to her, if no independent act of receiving should be proved on her part and the jury should believe that what was done by her was done by the authority and under the coercion of her hus. band. The foUolwing evidence was then adduced- Mary Anne Edlin, dy's matd to Lady EUlesmere, proved that on the 22d of January, 1856 she packed up the box containing the property in question, and she identified a box produced by the polie as being the same box. She also Identified somo articles of clothing that were shown to her as having been placed br her in the box on the day of the rebbery. The entire value of the property placed in the box by her she stated to be between fifteen and sixteen thou. sand pounds. Evidence was then given that the box, after It had been packed, was placed on the top of a cab, and that on the vehicle rim g at the Great Wester Railway station it was discovered to have been stolen William Frowd, a cabdriver, proved that on the 22d of January the prisoner Attwell engaged his cab, and a box was placed on it by him and another man, and he drove to Leonard-square, Shoreditch, and stopped at a beershop. The prisoner then took the box on his shoulder and went away in the direction of the house where he ascertined afterwards that the prisoner Jackson resided. Cross-examined.-He should not be able to recognize the man who accompanied Attwell. A witness rho resided about three hundred yards from the house occupied by the prisoner Jackson proved that on the evening of the 22d of January he found the 1ox in which the property had been placed, empty, in his garden. Mrs. Lydia Curling, a Iace cleaner at Pimlico, Identified a Brussels lace shawilthat was produced as one that had been cleaned and mended by her for her ladyshlp. The value of this shawl she said was between 501. and 601. William BlacTrborne, lace manufacturer, identified a black lace shawl as one he had sold to Lady Elesmere for 16 guineas. The witness also identified several lace handkerchiefs, one of bhich he nid was worth five, and the others one guinea each. Thomas EVAns, a sergeant of the G divsion, deposed that on the 18th of October last he was on duty in plain clothes in Old-street, when he saw the prisoner Jackson and another man, and when the prisoner observed him he turned suddenly baek and went up Henry-street and knocked at the door of No.8. Witness went up to him and asked him what he had got. He replied, "What is that to your' Witness told him he beonged to the police, and he must know what he had, and the prisoner then said he should not tell him. He took him into custody and then went to his house, where he found the female prisoner and a man. MrM Jackson hbd a mug in her hand, and witness asked her what she had got there, and he replied, " Only a mug that be has brought to show me." He asked the man where he bad got the mug from, and he at first said he knew nothing about it but afterwards he said he had found it at Shoreditch. Witness then searched the house, and In a drawer in the bedroom he found the four lace handkerchiefs and the lace shawl that had been identified as part of the stolen property. The female prieoner endeavoured to conceal the handkerchiefs, and he took them away from her. She stated when he found the shawl that it had been given to her by her mother before she was married, and she said that she had had the handkerchiefs for eight or nine years The witness then produced a number of other articles that were found by him in different parts of Jackson's house, and said that he tben took the female prisoner to thepolice-station, where her husband was, and upon his seeing her he said to her, "What have they taken away ?" ifi she said in reply " Them handkerchiefs; you know I have had them these eight or nine years." Mrs. Jackson was allowed to go at large upon bail, and on the 24th of October he went again to the house to make a searchand discovered a blacklace veil, which the female prisoner told him had been given to her by her sister. He also discovered some other articles that turned out to have forsued a portion of the stolen proper. The male prisoner underwent several examinations, and upon one occasion after be had been remsnded he addressed him and said they were prosecuting an innocent man. He then said that he did not deny that the box was brought to his house, but he could not help that, and he added that if witness would get him the names of all the shoemakers begining with S in Crown-street and Sun-street he would tell him the one where the wearing apparel was taken to. Hetook him the names on the following day, and Jackson then said he did not see the namo he wanted among them, and he then said he should not give any further information unless a promise was made to him that he should not be prosecuted. Witness told him he could not make him such a promise and the prisoner then said he knew where the diamonds and jewelry were sold, and that one diamond necklace was sold whole to a Jew who lived on a first floor in Bishopsgatestreet for 3001., but he said he did not know the house. He then said that part of the jewellery was thrown down a water closet and a pair of diamond eardrops were thrown into a field in Whitechapel, and if he was let out he would try and find the places. Jackson afterwards said that when tho box was first brought to his bousc he said he would have nothing to do with it, but they told him they had carried it far enough, and would not carry It any further. They then, he said, took the box into the back room and broke it open, aud they thought, from the nature of the contents, that it belonged to some theatrical person. The jewelry, he said, was afterwards taken away in a red handkerchief, and the wearing apparel In a lace veil. Cross-examined. -During the time MIrs Jackson made the statements he referred to her husband was in prlson. Re- examined.-The prisoner Jackson carried on ostensibly the business of an oiL and colourman. e had two shopsone in Leonard-street and the other in Old-street A washerwoman living in Leonard-street proved that sbortly after the robbery the female prisoner, for whom she had been in the habit of washing, gave her some teaspoons, two watches, and a chain, and some silver spoons and articles of jewelry to take care of. She gave them to her in a copper teakettle. Cross-examined.-One of the watches had a "Halbert" to It. (A. laugh.) She meant a chain. Edward Collingridge, a jeweller and gold refiner in Wilderness-row, proved that in October, 1856, he purchased a diamond of the prixoner Edward Jackson, and gave him 161. for it. He afterwards brought him another 0ond for which he offered him 181., but the prisoner would not take that sum, but required 201 This was the case for the prosecution. Mr. COOPER then addressed the jury for the prisoner Edward Jackson. He called their attention to the long perlod that had elapsed between the oommidion of the robbery and the finding of the articles in the possesdon of the prisoner, and sMid that, although it appeared that thee articles were of very onsiderable value to persons who were acquainted with the nature of such property, yet that ordi I nary poople ight riot have bad the sligrIest idea that they were so valuable, and the prisoner or his wife might have purchased them quite innooently, and vithout the slightest nowledge that they were the produce of robbery. lMr. SLMGH addressed the jury for the female prlsoner and the defenoe he urged on her behalf was that all she hi done was under the coercion of her husband, and that she could not therefore legally be convicted upon the present Indictment. The REconrSER then summed up, and explained [to [the jury the views taken by the law of the position of a married 'woman in reference to an offenoe ommitted by her in the presence of her husband, and said that unless they we-e satisfied that she had been guilty of some Independent act of receiving he was of opinion they ought not to convict her. The jury almost immediately returned a verdict of GuiUy against Edward Jackson, and Not Guilty s regarded his wife. The RXCORDER said he should lIke to have some Informa. tion about the prisoner Jacl-son. Mr. GlvxARD said that he ws tried in this court upon a former occasion for reeiving stolen property. He was acquitted upon that occasion. Evans, the police sergeant, informed the Court that among the property that was found in the prisoner's house there were several article that were the produoe of two bzLalesand ota robbe2rrfrom al cab that took place in The REcoRDEI Inquired whether any suspicion restd upon Attwell before he made the ,statement that had been referred to. Mr. GIyIARD mid it appeared that Attwell was suspected before he made the staement, but he was convicted under the name of Walsh at Chelmsford, and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, and some time elapsed before it was ascertained that he was the same person. It seemed that he beleved that suspicion was directed to him inu rofrenca

TRAuMs.-Frank Smith, a marine, belonging to the Peruvian war frigate Amazonian, lying in the East India Docks, 'was,brought up on remand hefore MIr. SELFE, charged 'with attempting to murder a police constable named John Blake, No. c3 H, and with assaultlng several other persons. An. affray arose between American and Peruvian sailors in Ratclxffa Eighway on Satarday night last. That neigh. bourhood was disturbed for several hours, and nine or ten persons were Injured. There were about 20 Pernvians belonging to the Amazonian in a publichouse, they were all armed with kbAves, dirks, and daggers, and they met a number of American seamen whose hands were covered with 'weapons called knuckle-dusters, made of brass, with small and sharp spurs in them to rake out the eyes or tear up the flesh of any person struck with them. Rymes, No. 189 H, kept back the Peravians and obtained a reinforcement of police, who escortedtheArnericans to a place -where they were out of danger. Some of the Peruvians then made an attack on Rymes, who kept them at bay with his truncheon, and took a long knife out of a Peruvian's hand. The Peruvians then went into Ship-alley, Wellolose-square, 'where there was another disturbance among them, and they ill-used some English seamen, who knocked down several Peravians with their fists, and got away. Blake, 83 H, went towards the alley to suppress the disturbance among the Peruvians, and the prisoner, who was concealed in the dark recess of a wall, with a dagger in his hand, made an attempt to stab the policeman, whojurmped back, andthe dagger pierced his own under coat, tore it up, and slightly injured his chin. He was immediately closed upon by one of the prisoner's shipmates, who took his truncheon from him and knocked him down. The prisoner then ran away, followed by another police constable, and the prisoner struck at everyone Le met with his dagger, and several narrowly escaped being kiMled. A por and infirm woman was knocked down by him in his headlong retreat and seriously injured. At length an English seaman put his foot out, tripped up the Peruvian, and he was secured and his knife taken from hib, bnt not before a police-constable 'whom he had attempted to stab had struck him several blows on the head with a truncheon, which completely disabled him. On Sunday night there was another disturbance between the Peruvians and Americane, which was suppressed by the police, who took from them several long knives and Imuckledusters. A collection of daggers, stilettoes, bowie knives, and knuckledusters taken from American and Peruvian seamen were exhibited by inspectors Gernon and Dendy. The Mfagistrate addressed the captain of the Peruvian frigate Amazonian, for whose attendance a summons had been issued, and said he was very sorry to say a great many cases of assault, wounding, and robbery had taken place among the crew of the Amazonian. There had been one death owing to the reckless use of the knife. A considerable number of Peruvians had used dirks, knives, and daggers In a most reckless and dangerous manner. The commander of the Amazonian regretted tbat hls men had behaved so badly on shore, and attributed it to intoxication. Mr. SELnE said It would be as well if American and Peruvian seamen were prohibited from 'wearing, or having in theLr possession, bowle knives, daggers, knuckledusters, and dirks whilethey were on shore. He wished to preserve amicable relations with Peru, bub he should be very glad indeed when the Amazonian took her departure. These things could not be permitted in this country, however they might suit Peru and the United States. He should pass a very light sentence on the prisoner, which was, one month's imprisonment In the House of Correction, but if there -was any more of this, severe punishments would be inflcted. The captain of the Amazonian said he would give the injured woman compensation, and stop it from the wages of the prisoner. Several Peruvians and Americans asked for the restoration of their murderots weapons. These applications were peremptorily refused. SoUT'AvR1K.-Mr. Buncrrac? requested our reporter to acknowledgethe receipt of the following timely donations to the poor-box:-31. 3s. from "T. AL T.," per Messrs. Coutts, and 101. from " C. V." The district of this court is nvow very densely populated with poor people, owing chie0y to the improvements at the west end and the city, which in a great measure has driven the poor inhabitants to the Surrey side of the water, 'where they locate themselves in -the neighbourhood of Bermondsey. The consequences are that the magistrates at this court have at this season of the year many claims on the poor-'cos. Last year 3,000 tickets for coal and 3,000 tickets for bread 'were issued to the poor, and this 'winter, should there be suffcient funds in the system 'will he adoptedL At present, noee,tefuds are very low.

WINTER ASSTZE& NIDLAND CROCUtIT. DBRBY, Dxc. 14. 1nc cOmnlsason for this county was opened on Saturday afternoel before Mr. Baron Channell, and the businoss of the assize was commenced this morning at 10 o'clock. Henry Buxton, aged 21, labourer, was charged, in sEparate indictments, with a highway robbery, on the 17th of October, at AshEord; with another highway robbery, on the 7th of November, at Rowaley; and with two burglaries on the night of the 6th of October-one at Rowsley, and the other at Stanton Leigh. He pleaded " Guilty" to the two burglarles, bub "' Not Guilty" to the other indictments. Mr. MeyneU conducted the prosecution. The prisoner was undefended. In the first case the prosecutrix, Harriet Bagshaw, proved tbat on the afternoon in question she was going along a high road in the parish of Ashford, when she was assailed by the prisoner, a tall, powerful man, who put his hands upon her shoulders and demanded money. She offered him some siver, hoping that that would satisfy him, but the hope was vain, for he seized her very roughly, put his hand on her mouth to stop her crying out, and threw her down upon the ground. He also tore off her scarf, which was fastened by a broach, snatched her gold chain and watch, and rifled her pockets. In her pocket was a purse containing five sovereigns; but she luckily succeeded in turning the raoney out into her pocket, and though the prisoner got possession of the purse he failed ta secure the gold, some of which was found afterwards in her pocket, and some on the ground. The prosecutrix swore dtstinctly to the prisoner as the man who had robbed her; and later the same afternoon be was proved to have offered for sale the gold chain which had been taken. In the second case the prosecutor, Albany Daniels, proved that on the evening of the 7th of November be was going along the Rowsley-road, when the prisoner suddenly started upon him and gave him a violent blow on the face, and knocked him down and took his purse from his pocket, containing 21. 13s. Information having been given to the police he was afterwards apprehended, and secured in spite of violent resi6tance. The constable, who was very severely kicked upon the legs and had suffered considerably from the effects of the prisoner's violence, was commended by the Judge and ordered a reward of 5f. The Jury convicted the prisoner iD both ceass, and The learned J1JDGE sentenced him to 20 years' penal servitude.
WESTERN CIROTJr. EXETER, Dxc. 14. Mr. Justice Willes opened the commission in this city for the county of Devon on Sattrday last. There are about 30 prisoners for trial ; some of the charges upon which they have been committed are of a very serious charactermurder, intent to murder, burglary and intent to murder, manslaughter, obtaining money by threats, and bigamay. James Boghurst, Thomas Brown, and James Coleman, who had been committed on a charge of burglary In the house of William Braddon, at Plympton, and with having assaulted William Braddon, with intent to murder, were placed at the bar. &Mr. KARSIAIE then stated to the Court that he had an afidavit made b asurgeon, who stated that Mr. Braddon was not in a condition to give evidence in the case, but ho thought that by the next assizes he might be able to do so. Hr. Justice Wn:r FS then asked the prisoners if they had any objection to the postponement of thelr trials. The prisoners said they would rather be tried now. Mr. Justice WILLES sald, under the circumstances, he should recommit the prisoners to the next assizes. Henry Burrington Rooper was indicted for uttering a forged check for 41. odd, withintent to defraud John Rlsn. Mir. Bere conducted the prosecution. It appeared that Harris kept a publichouse at Exmouth. The prisoner went there to lodge on the 28th of Sentember, and remained there until the 15th of October, when his bill amounted to upwards of 41. He then offered Harris the check in question, which purported to have been irawn by his uncle. The check was proved tc, be In the handwrlting of the prisoner. The JvnuG having summed up, The Jury remained some time In consultation, and then returned a verdict of Guily'of false pretences,lbut the forgery was not made out to their satisfaction. The JUDGE then told the jury that the prisoner was not charged with the offence of false pretences, but with utteriDa forged check,he knowing it to be forged. T he Jury then returned a verdict of Guilty of the uttering. The JUDGE said he should not do his duty if he treated such an offence with leniency. The sentence would therefore be four years' penal servitude.
OXFORD CIRCUIT. _STAFFORD, DEc. 14. tlSeJOr&c r. Barotn MARaTrN.) Wiollm Allanson, aged 31, tailor, and Mary Ann Allan. oon, aged 30, were charged with uttering a forged 6t, Bank ,of England note, at W-olverhampton, ox the 23d of July, 1857, with intent to defraud. Mr. Boughey, and Mr. IL Matthews appeared for the prosecution. r. xG. Brown defended the prisoners. This prosecution was instituted by tho Governors and Company of the Bak of Bngland, and showed that the prlsoners had been engaged in an extensive system of utter3ng forged Bank of England notes. The particular charge on which the pwisoners were tried wac thatoa uttering a forged fl. Bank of England note at the shop of Mrs. Moseley, - milliner at Wolverhamupton, oa the 23d of last July. It appeared that on that day the female prisoner went into Mr Moseley's shop and purchased a large quantity of tape and cotton, amounting to six or seven shillings in value, and tendereda5. Bankof England note inpayment. The prisoner had lived some years at Wolverbampton, and as she was knowzn to Mrs. Moseley, the latter took the note without suspicion and gave her the change. Some conversation then took place, in the eourse of which the prisoner said she was going to London, and to Australia, and asked Mrs. Moseley to give her a keepsake. At the same time a woman who accompanied the prisoner into the shop said to her, " You must make haste, for your husband is waiting outside." On the 25th of July the prcsecutrix senb the note to Fryer's Bank at Wolverhampton, where it was dis¢overed that the note was forged. It appeared thaS on the same day both the prisoners went to Birkenbead and put up at the Dock Hotel, Butler, a Wolver- hampton policemf.n, followed and took them ixto cuv tody, and tound that they had taken a page by a ship which wes about to sail for Melbourne, in Australia. Their boxes were also found at the Dock Hotel, ineauding a smaU box wihich the female prisoner had given in charge to the barmaid, and which contained three gold and silver watches and a pocketbook. In the pocketbook were 15 sovereigns and also three forged Bank of Eugland notes. The male prisoner said he did not know the notes were bad, but that he had won them of a betting man. In order to show that the female prisoner had uttered the note with a knowledge of its being forged, it was proved that on the 21st of July she had uttered two forged ol. Bank of England notes at Stafford, and on the 22d of July she bad also uttered two other such notes at Wolverhampton. In the course of the sial it appeared that the prisoners had for seven or eight yearslive together at Wolverhampton as man and wife. At the close of the evidence, Mr. BRMoN submitted that. as it was proved the husband was outside the shop when the female prisoner uttered the note, the presumption of the lAw was that she was acting under the coeroion of her husband, and she was entitled to be acquitted. Mr. Baron M xRTnN said that if the learned counsel meant to rely upon that point he ahould like the prose. cutrix to be recaed. Mrs. Moseley was then recalled, and stated that a woman in the shop told the prisoner to make haste as her husband was outside, but she did not see any man. A woman named Caroline Mason, who acompanied the female prisoner into the shop, was also called, and said she heard a woman tell her that her husband was waiting for her, but she did not see him; but having accompanied her for about 1.00 yards, to the Plough, the male prisoner came in in about a minute. Mr. BROWN then contended that the female prlsoner was entitled to be acquitted on the ground that at the time she uttered the note she believed herhusbandwas waiting for her outside, and consequently she was acting under his coercion. Mr. BOUGHEr and Mr. MLATTnws having been heard on this point, Mir. Baron MARTT rnled that it was a question for the jury whether, when the female prisoner uttered the note, the male prisoner was so near that she could be considered as acting under his coercion. His Lordship afterwards left that uestion to the jury, telling them at the same time that the male prisoner gave her the note to get it changed, and she uttered it in his absence knowing it to be forged, they were both liable to be convicted. The jury found both the prisoners Guilty, Mr. Baron MARTLTL sentenced the male prisoner to 15 years' penal servitude, and the female prisoner to 12 months' imprsonment with hard laoour.
TEB HEALTH OF LONDON. (From tho Registrar-General's Weekly Return.) The publio health of the metropolitan districts appears to he returning to a more satisfactory conditlon. In the previous week the deaths registered were 1,428; in the week that ended on Saturday (December 12th) they fell to 1,240. In the ten years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,297. But, as population has increased, it is necessary for comparison that the average should be raised proportionally to the increase, in which caso it Will become 1,427. In consequence of the unusual prevalence of influenza in the second week of December, 1847, the deaths from all causes rose to 2,416; and if the average is corrected with reference to this circumstance, it will be found that the rate of mortality now prevailing differs not much from that which may be expected at this season when no epidemic is present. The births of last week exceed the deatha in the ame period by 563. The deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory orgars, which in the preceding week were 415, declined last week to 336, which is still, however, a rather high mortality. Fatal cases of bronchitis declned in the two weeks from 242 to 185; those of pneumonia were 129 and 119; those of asthma 20 and 17. The deaths from phthiais (or con. sumption), which in the previous week were 168, were last week only 114. Influenza was probably more fatal than the tables indicate ; for the cases returned under the specific designation in the two weeks were respectively only 22 and 19. Scarlatina is at present more fatal than any other disease in the zymotic class; it was fatal last week in 55 cases; 4 of these occurred in the sub-district of Lambeth church (first part). Thirty-six children died of measdes, and 14 of these in the east districts. Of 47 deaths from whooping. cough, the greatest number (15) occurred in the north districts, and so many as five of these in the Regent's Park subdistrict, while only five occurred in the south districts. A manaied of cholera in Lambeth,afterfour days' illness. Two deaths are recorded as the result of insufficient nourishment, while three persons were the victims of intemperance. Seven persons had attained the age of 90 years or upwards; one of these was a man; the rest were widows, three of whom had reached the age of 94. Last week the births of 961 boys and 842 girls-in all 1,803 children-were registered in London, In the ten cor. responding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number number was 1,507. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 30-369 inches. The mean daily barometrical reading was above 20 inches onSaturday, the 5th inst., and continued above that point during the whole of last week. The highest reading was 30-57 inches at the end of the week. The meau temperature of the week was 45, which is 4.50 above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). On Monday the excess of mean temperature above the average was so great as 10 20. The highest temperature was 55.3° on Sunday (the 6th); the lowest was 35-3°, and occurred on Tuesday. Themean daily rangeoftheweekwas 10-8 deg. On Saturday the range was only 5 6 deg. Themean dew point temperature was 43 3 deg., and the difference between this and the mean air temperature was 1- deg. The mean temperature of the water of the 'hames was 459 deg. The mean degree of humidity of the air was 93, complete saturation being represented by 100. A deuse fog prevailed on Tuesday. The mean temperature of the air on that day was 417 deg. ; that of the Thames considerably higher-viz., 46-2 deg, The wind was in the south-west throughout the week. There was no rain.
THE BILLETING SYSTEM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-May I, on behalf of the licensed victuallers of this place, beg you to allow me a space in your valuable columns for the purpose of protesting against the gross injustice infficted on us by the Militia being billeted here for so lengthened a perlod, more especially as there is such a place as the camp at Aldershott ? The lst Royal Surrey Militia has been quartered here for about six weeks, and the bilets extend to a fortnight longer. It is only necessary to say that 99 officers and men are billeted on two houses alone-viz., the Star and Garter, 50 men and six officers, and the Castle Hotel, 39 men and four officers-other houses in proportion. To show the very great expense and inconvenienoe we are subjected to,IImayfurther state that the annoyance Is not confined to the licensed victuallers only, the inhabitants generaUy feel the inconvenienoe and detriment, as Richmond is a place whose prosperity entirely depends upon visitors, and the presence of o00 young men, many of whom are disorderly and dissgolute, converts it from the quiet attractive town it usually is to ill-disciplined barracks. I should inform you that a letter has been addressed to his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge on the subject, to which has been returned a most gracious reply, promising that the Militia shall be removed at the earliest possible opportunity; but even that wiU only afford a temporary relief, whereas it is our desire to obtain a permanent one. We cannot, of course, complain of marching regiments being temporarily quartered upon us, but we protest against the MiLtis infliction for so lengthy a period as above stated, and we sincerely trust by your kindly inserting this letter it may attract the attention of our county members, and that they will next session bring it before Parliament, and obtain for us a removal of the existing eviL I am.

THE NORTHUAMBERLAND ANrD DURHAM BANK. (BY xLECTRro AND nTraINLTIONAL mxanAPa) NEWCASTLE, TUESDAY NIGIT. A special meeting of the shareholders of the Northum'berland and Durham District Bank was held in the Royal Exchange Hotel, in tbis town, this afternoon; Mr. Ridley, MP., in the chair. There was a crowded meeting. Mr. W. B. Ogden, acting director, read * report from the directors. It stated that the calamity which had overtaken the establishment must unquestionably be referred in a great measure to losses sustained by the bank, and still more to the circumstance that maAy of the secu,ities were not of a nature to be readily convertible. Tho directors were entitled to say, as they confidently did, that the difficulties arising from this cause had been struggled with, and considerable amnounts had been realized from what otherwise would have been a total loss. The valuable and profitable business enjoyed by the bank also allowed the appropriation, according te the announcements particularly contained in the reports of 1848 and 1849, and I continued in the subsequent reports, of a considerable sum to meet the current yearly losses, and to operate towards the redemption of those of earlier dates. Though the bankhad Mustained no general run, there hadbeena gradual but constantly prevailing abstraction of its resources. The attention of the directorg, aided by a ntumber of influentil shareholders had been given to what ws one of the oldest and inoomparably the largest inconvertible advance of the banknamely, that due from the members of a large manufacturing establishment in the neighbourhood. They were now enabled to announce that after an allowance had been made for the high rate of interest charged Mr. Jonathan Richardson had guaranteed the payment of nearly the whole of this debt. (Applause.) Considering the respec tabllity and resources of the partners, whose liability remainedunaffected, theshareholdersmight reasonablyconsider the account as satisfactorily arranged. The repayments, from themagnitude of the engagements, would unavoidably extpnd over a somewhat lengthened period, but the amount would bear interest at 5 per cent. per annum. The obl'gation thus entered into by AMr. Richardson was inconsistent with his continuance as a director, and his retirement was th coonsequence. Mr. Matthew Robert Bigge's retirementarose from his being one of the partners answerable for the debt. The mode of meeting the engagements of the bank had formed the subject of the directors' deliberate consideration, while the coDection of assets had their best attention. They were aware, if they hoped for indulgence from the creditors in point of time, the latter had a right to expect that an effort should be made to meet the present emergency. With the concurrence of a considerable number of the principal shareholders, the directors had announced, for these reasons, a call of 51. per share, and placed it with the meeting to confirm that measure. It was impossible at this early period to form a decided opinion as to the precise time within which the settlement of claims on the bank might be made. With reference to the affairs of the bank, it was extremely difficult to arrive at definite conclusions, the result depending upon the value of assets, of which a certain opinion could not at once be formed. So far as the directors could form ajudgment, though calls were absolutely necessary In erder tomeetthepresentdemands, a small portion of the capital might in the endbe preserved. Further examination of the accounts has the lull attention of the board, who invited the appointment of a committee of shareholders to assist in their deliberations. (Cheers.) The directors had considered and would submit to the creditors a distinct proposition for the liquidation of their demands at the earhest date the result of the Assets would allow, w:.'ch object they were most anxious to promote. Report adopted without discusslon. Messrs. John Richardson and Jonathan Prlestman were elected directors in the room of Messrs. Matthew Robert Bigge and Jonathan Richardson. Mers. Robert Mackreth and Charles Milner, Edmund Graham, James Joicy, and Jonathan Priestman, jun., shareholders, were nominated a committee to assist the directors in investigating the affairs of the bank. I' was ob. jected by Eome shareholders that these were interested parties; but after a warm discussion the committee, with power to add two shareholders to their number, was agreed to, with directions to report in three months. The following resolution, after a somewhat animated debate, was adopted:- " That a call of o1. per share be now made, payable in 14 days; and that all payments hitherto made under the call made by the directors be considered a part of the payment." An amendment for deferring it was negatived. In the course of the debate a SrA oLDmR inquired if -the portion of capital which in the report was hoped would be preserved was paid-up capitaL The CHi £m? replied in the affirmative. Another SAr&nOLDER asked if more calls would be made. The CiAiizmAN said no more calls could be made with-' out another special meeting. Mr. Jonx GREY DisTox amnounced the formation of a private bank on the premises, with Messrs. Hawks, Sillick, Grey, and Priestman proprietors; three-fourths of the profit would form a fund for division among suffering shareholders in the District Bank. (Cheers) In answer to questions Mr. PmSnirasAX said it was in. tended to resuscitate the District Bank. Mr. HAWKS stated that the proprietors of the new bank would be glad to transfer their powers to the District Bank when the liabilities of the latter were discharged. A vote of thanks to the chairman aud proprietors of the new bank closed the proceedings.
MSURDEB ANfD SUIOIDE AT OROYDO01. The case of murder and suicide at Croydon came under the investigation of Mr. Carter, the Surrey coroner, yesterday afternoon, at Croydon. It appeared from the evidence that Mr. Willlam Smithers, a clerk in the Bank of England, resided with his mother and a younger brother at Thornton-heath, near Croydon. The younger brother, Mr. Charles Smithers, was a clerk in the faotory of Mr. Bunnett an engineer, at Deptford,-an appointment he was about leaving for the purpose of entering upon a situation he had been promised in the Bank of England. On the morning of Thursday last Mrs. Smithers knocked at the door of Elizabeth Morgan, a servant residing in the house, and desired her to get up, as she heard Mr. Wiliam moving, and supposed he might be wanting to go out. It was then a little after 5 o'cloci. At that timo he was in Charles's bedroom, which was adjacent to that of Mrs. Smithers. As soon as she had dressed herself William called to her, and requested her to bring him a wineglass, as he had got some medicine for his brother. On recejvin the glass he went back again into Charles's room. Wnen she had prepared breakfast she went upstairs to see whether the gentlemen were coming down. She knocked at the door, and reoceiving no answer, listened, when she head one of them snoring. She went downstairs again, thinking she would let them sleep on. About 9 o'clock a lad brought a letter, which he said was to be given to Mr. William Smithers at once, and Elizabeth M3orga44 took it up. Not being able to obtain any reply to rem peated knocks, she opened the door, when both the you men ap red as though they were lying dead in boa. Charles was foaming at the mouth. She asked a young woman residing in the next house to accompany her upstairs, and upon entering the room they found that both the young men were dead. Morgan then ex. claimed, " Goed God, Anne ! here is a poison bottle, and the wineglass I gave Mr. William this morning." They were lying on the bed between the two brothers. Morgan then went into her mistress's bedroom, and found her in a half sitting posture, her head resting against the bed post. She was quite dead. Mr. Bottomley, who was called in, at once. decided that the two brothers had died from the effects of prussia acid, and there could be no doubt that William administered a dose to his brother, probably in his sleep, and that he then took the poison himself. It appears that he administered poison to his mother between the hour when she caUed Morgan and the time Morgan found her deud in bed. Some explanations were given as to the probable cause for the commission of this dreadful series of crimes. Wllialm Smithers had been speculating in the city, and had been unsuccessful. He had borrowed 701. of a friend, which he was unable to pay; he had appropriated to his own use 201. which his mother had intrusted to him to pay some accounts, and from letters which have been found It seems that he was about assigning some life policies as security for his engagements. The mental depression produced by his unsuccessful speculations drove him to the use of brandy, of which within the last few weeks he com. monly drank a pint aX day. The juryAeliberated for an hour, when the folowing ver. dict was returned :-"That Mary Smithers and Charles Smithers were wilfu}ly murdered by the administration of poisonby William Holton Smithers, and that William olton Smithers afterwards committed self-destruction while suffering under temporary mental derangement."
OVERoCOWI)G RAILWAY CARRIAGES.-At the last sitting of the Covaty Court at York an action of some .mportance to railway companies and railway passengers wag tried before Mr. Serjeant Dowling, the judge. An action was brought against t&e North-Eastern hailway Company by a solicitor residing at York for damages for an alleged breach of contract under the following cireamstances_:-Tbe plaintiff took a awond-class return-ticket froma York to Scarborough on the evening of the 21st nlt. He returned on Monday .runing and travelled with only one other paswenger as far as Flaxton station, when the door was unceremoniou61y opened, and 10 other persons, principally farm servants and labourers, who were proceeding to York, rushed into tihe Compartment, which was occupied by 12 persons. The now comers caused the plaintiff considerable annoyance, beba ving in a very coarse and disgraceful manner. Theplaintiffn.7w contended that the company having contracted to allow Aim to travel in a comnfortable manner and to be free from an noyance had broken their agreement by allowing these met,' to get into the second-class compartnent with third-cla es tickets. The second-class seats were made to contain fou.' passengers each; but even supposing they were made for five each the company, it was contended, had no right to cram in a dozen passengers, there being then an excegs of two in the compartment.
