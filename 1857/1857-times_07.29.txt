THR MUTINIES IN INDIA. Yeiterday was published an appendix to thepapers relative to the mutinies in the East Indies, an abstiact of which appeared in Tlhe Tines of Friday last. The papers in this appendix consist of certain Cenclosures" referred to in the despatches previously noticed, including reports from the local authorities, &c., on the prejudices and feelings of the ;epoya about the greased cartridges, and a report of the Special Court of Inquiry assembled at Barrackpore on the 6th of February laat. It appeArs from these papers that the Sepoys, according to the "conviction" of Major-General Rearsey, have been " tampered with by designing villains" when on duty in Fort William and Calcutta, it having been frequently noticed by old military residentS at the station that, after frequent absences on such detached duty, many of thenxm returned to their lines "c with strange ideaA and unsettled minds." Who these " designing villains" are, or were, we are not informed. It further appears, from the report of the Inspector-General of Ordnance and Magazines to the Secretary of the Government of India, dated the 29th of January ast, that "no extraordtnary precaution appears to bave been taken (at the practice depot of Dumdum), to insure the absenoe of any objectionable fat." " It is certainly to be regretted," adds the inspector, with some simplicity, " that ammunition was not prepared expressly for the practice dep6t without any grease at all, 'DUt the subjeot did not occur to me." Enclosure 14 (in No. 3) contains the revelation of a Sepoy to Lieutenant Allen of a plot among four regiments at the Barrackpore Station, those regimentb being determined to rise, because they were. apptehensive of being forced to give up their caste and be made Christians against their will; they intended to burm down and plunder the Bungalows at Barrackpore, and next proposed to march on Calcutta and seizo Fort William. In short, the storm in India appears to have been preceded by the most unmistakable prognostics. T'he history of the disbanding of the l9th Native Rtegiment at Barrackpore is fully given; the minute of the Governor-Generaloof India in Council, recording this fact, states that there are many indications that the aeeds of insubordination were first sown in some of the regiments quartered at Barrackpore. A copy of the " humble petition " of the "faithful officers and Sepoys" of the disbanded regiment is given in the papers before us. This, they contended was "their first fault," and they hoped "the Government would be so kind as to pardon it."
THE INDIAN MUTINY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Not a few of those who are very favourable to a complete change of government for India are of opinion that the natives of that country would regard such change at the present moment as a concesson to the mutinous opposition of the army, and they would therefore defer the consideration of this Important queetion until the complete subjugation of that army and the reetoration of undisputed authority, imch as it was before the recent mutinies, over every part any portion of our Indian empire. I think that thls is entirely an erroneous impression, and formed by those who have never had the opportunity of becoming practically acquainted with the characteristics of the natives of India. It is my firm conviction that a proclamation announcing that India will henceforth be ruled and governed by, and in the name of, the Crown, and that the army shall be & Royal army, owing allegiance and giving service to our gracious Sovereiga the Queen, would not only be hailed with joy and satisfaction, but would be considered by all classes and castes of the natives of India as a measure of stzength and as an intimation that the country shaU forthwith be governed with vigour, firmness, and Integrity, and that tho vacillating, insufficient, and objectionable policy of past years is at an end for ever. The native will assuredly rejoice to know that he has a Sovereign and a defined Government, and wiU no longer ask for explanations nor receive the most unsatisfactory answers regarding that incomprehensible myth, Koompany Bahadoor. I believe, too, that the effect of such a proclamation would be most salutary in diverting tho minds of tho multitude from conspiracies and plots, and in lieu thereof filUig them with hopes and prospects of amelioration, for surely the natives of India are not an exceptional people wh en they assert that they havo grievances to be redressed. Better is it, indeed, that their complaints should be openly made and heard, and relief administered, than that they should remain pent up, and gather strength in secret to break out suddenly and widely in revolt and sedition, with the fearful results which have now brought so much misery, affliction, and deep sorrow to many an English home. No good is obtained for this country either by the maintenance of the present double system of home government for India through the Court of Directors and the Board of ControL Let not selfish and class interests, then, prevail any longer In preventing the abolition of both. But it is always urged in reply to such a proposition, how then is Indin to be governed if you get rid of the East India Company and Court of Directors? It appears to me that the answer to this question is most simple, and at the same time completely consistent with our constitotion:Appoint a Secretary for India, with a ful aand effective establishment of under-secretaries and assistants for each of the presidencies. The Secretary should of course be a Cabinet Minister, with the powers (modified, if necessary, In detail) now exercised by the President of the Board of Control and the East India Directors, and responsible directly to the Crown, Parliament, and country. So far as the home Government of India is concerned no other change seems required. But this change would be equally pleasing and grateful to the few independent Englishmen-that is, those in no way connected with the Government of the country, now established in India in industrial pursults, and in a strugglo to dovelope the vast resources and capabilities of but a small portion of our great Eastern empire. The policy of the East India Company, has, from its original establishment to the present period been one of hostility and opposition to the enterprisiug Englishman, and in proportion as they have been shorn of their commeroial privileges and patronage they have by increased legislative powers kept down and disheartened their countrymen, for unquestionably thishas been the aim and object of the laws known as the Black Acts, so odious to our countrymen and so suicidal in policy. I do hope, now that this country is called upon for the means almost of reconquering India, that thatcountry will no longer be as a sealed book, to be read and interpreted by the few of Leadenhall-street just as the Shastres are between the Brahmin and the people of the East. The struggle may perhaps-I trust not-be postponed yet awhile, but come it wiU whenever the public of England shall think proper to inform itself of the quality and capabilities of their vast conquests, and the certainty of finding in India almost unboumdIed fields for the induetrious, for thu employment of capital, and for every scheme of benevolence and charity.

THE BISHOPRIC OF PERTH, AUsTRALIA.- The ceremony of consecrating the venerable Matthew Blagden Hale, D.D., Archdeacon of Adelaide, to the newly erected bishopric of Perth, in Western Australia, took place on Saturday last, being the festival of St. James, in the cbapel of Iambeth-palace. The consecrating prelates were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and the Bishop of Ri,on. The Vicar-General, Dr. Travers Twiss, an the Registrar.General of the province of Canterbury, Mr. Francis Hart Dyke, attended the Archbishop. After prayers had been read by the Rev. John Thomas, one of his Grace's chaplains, and an impressive sermon preached by the Rev. E. Harold Browne, M.A., Nornslan Professor of Divinity in the University of Cambridge, the Registrar-General read Her Majesty's letters patent, whereby the province of Western Australia and the adjacent islands have been separated from the diocess of Adelaide, and constituted an independent diocess, the see of the bishop bein at Perth, under the metropolitan authority of the Bishop of Sydney, and subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The limits of the new diocess are specified to be "all that portion of the continent of Australia which lies to the westward of the 129th degree of east longitude, reckoning from Greenwich, and all the islands Rdjacent in the Indian and Southern Oceans within the latitudes of 13 deg. 44 min. south, and 35 deg. S min. south, and within the longitudes of 112 deg. 52 mis. east and 1t9 deg. east from the meridian of Green. wicb." nstoimhN T e EAGLw'S NEST.-.m-sTwo foresters of Ibasprck, asssted by some sportsman, lately gained possess of an eagle's nest, and in it a b oung eaglet, about sid weeks old, which they carried alive t-e Innspruck. The nest was found at some little distance from the river Suirenbach, in a small cavern situate in a side8 Of a rooek, and about 150 feet below the summit. One of the forester, named Tschan, had himself let down by means of a' rope, with . piece of wood plaed as a seat. The young eaglet not having given its visitor a friendly reception, but, on the contrary, inflicting several severe woundh on his hand and arm, Tschase was complled in his defence to strike it with Part Of a sheep whic he found in the nest. The eaglet was at last mastered, and placed in a6 basket, and 'i'scban was again hoisted up, glad to escape from the dreadful stench which arose from the remnants of dead animatls in the cavern. Whtile this was going on the female eagle was seen hovering above, buit at very consideraLblebheight. She wasnot firedat, as the guns were reserved in casso of an attack from the male. An eagle has for the last 40 years buflt her nest sometimes oni the rock of Solstein and at others on those of the Hechenberg. The dasntEe cauised by these birds to the game and smaller cattle in tie neighbourbood has been very considerable-
I MILITABY AND NA PA AL INTELLIGENCE. In consequence of the large number of Malines proceed ing to China, the Lords of the Admiralty have decided on removing the battalpon of Royal Marines now -tationed at Deal, uAder tha6obmmand of IAeutnant-Colonel J. R. Gas. cognue and attaching them to the Chatham division. The whole of the officers under orders to embark for China, and who are now on leave of absence, have received orders to join iheir respective head-quarters. The fine clipper siling ships James Baines, 2,515 tons, and the Champion of the Seas, belonging to the Black Ball line of Australian ships sailing from Liverpool, will leave that port to-night or to-morrow (Thursday) morning, the former having on board tbe 42d Highlanders, under the command of Colonel Cameron, filled up to the number of ,o000 men by head-quarters of the 97th Foot, and the latter with the remainder of the 97th, filed up with a wing of the s2d. Lady Cameron and several other wives of officers will also embark on board the James Baines at Portsmouth. The James Baines will be towed to Portamouth, and as far afterwards as may be deemed advisable, by the new steamtug Resolute, which arrived for that purpose yesterday at Liverpool, and the Champion of the Seas will go out in tow of ihe steamtug Blazer. The screw steamers Imperador and Imperatriz are being fitted for the conveyance of troops at Liverpool. The Frolic, 16, sloop, Commander L.. W. Peyton, from the Cape of Good Hope, is to be paid off at Chatham tomorrow. We learn by Electric and International Telegraph that orders were received yesterday at Plymouth to despatch the screw steam guardship Ajax, 60, Captain Robert S. Robinson, and the gunnery ship Cambridge, Captain Arthur W. Jerningham, to Spithead, and they will probably sail from the Sound this morning. We omitted to mention in our Impression of Monday that HI. S. Sanders, surgeon of the 3d Battalion Rifle Brigade, was among the officers who sailed with the last detachment of that regiment from Portsmouth on Sunday last, and that Mrs. Lindsay and child and MIrs. Sanders accompanied their husbands. Her Majesty's paddle steamsloop Barracouta, 6, Commsander Fortescue, arrived at Spithead yesterday afternoon from the China station and the Cape of Good Hope. She left Hongkong on the 19th of May, " all hands piping hot for a demonstration, and complaining of the Admiral's delay in passing the word." She arrived at the Cape on the 3d of June, and left on the 9th. While at the Cape she had very bad weather, heavy gales from the north-west being prevalent. At Table Bay six vessels went on shore on Sunday, the 7th; one with a general cargo struck at her anchors, and had six feet of water in her at sunset. Tho amount of property on the beaoh was 25,0001. No lives were lost. Eleven of the Cape boats were lost, and 6001. was refused to take off an anchor. The Barracouta's boat nearly foundered in making the attempt. After leaving the Cape she experienced a tremendous gale of wind from, the N.W., which, however, lasted only about ten hours. She arrived at St. Helena on the 22d of June, and left on the 2-5th; arrived at Fayal on the 19th, and left on the 20th, Spoke the bark Minna, of South Shields, on the 25th, she wanted longitude; passed the French brig Mogador, of Nantes, on the 26th. The Transit steam troopship arrived at the Cape, on her way to China with troops, on the 27th of May, aU welL The Himalaya steam troop. ship was met by the Barracouta a few hours after leaving the Cape, all welL UIeatennnt W. H. Pym has been appointed to the commnand of the Jasper gunboat, and Lieutenant J. B. Scott is appointed to command the Jaseur gunboat. The foUowing appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty :--Lieutenant W. F. Ruxton, to the Pylsdes; Lieutenant J. C. Wilson, to the Chesapeake; Lieutenant W. F. Irwins, to the Sparrowhawk; Lieutenant G. H. Barnard, to the Indus; Lieutenant Seymour Curtis (additional), to the Indus. _

SPOB2'ING INTBELLIN E. GOODWOOD RACES, TUESDAY. 53even of the thirty events appointed for decision were I brought to an iaue to-day, and the lns4lment of sport was sufficient to heighten the expectations which are entertained of a great and successful meeting. Wednesday and Thursday are the principal days, and they will sustain the prestfge which hs attached to them almost from the establishuient of the meeting. The Southern and Xorthern stables are fully represented. From John Day's alone there are 21 horses, while John Scott has. sent II, Joseph Dawson 8, John Osborne 6, William Day 7, and Mr. Merry, 9.

FEAPFiuL RAIWAY CoLLisioN.-The Leeds MerCUr7 contains the followving account of a fearful and fatal railway coRlision near HEll :-" On Fiday last, as the 4.30 p.m. express passenger train from Hull was proceeding to Beverley, it was run into by a ooal train, whereby one person was killed and several others were severely.iniured. From the informaation we have received, it seems that at about half-a-mile from Hull station the trains cross the rails at a point where the Victoria branch joins the WorthEastern mail line. The passenger trainwas punctual to its' time, and the driver. observing the atproaching coal train, pushed quickly forward for the purpose of getting clear of the crossing; but before this could be accomplished, the engine of the coal train ran into the latter portion of the passenger train, smashing severa carriages. The collision was terrific, as the p gssener train was running at a speed of about 40 miles an hoar. Immediate assistance was rendered to the wounded passengers, and it was fonnd that Mr. Yates, grocer, of Cottingham was so much injured that he died while being removed. The otber persons injured-some of whonm are not expected to live-were Mr. Waddington (Beverley), Mr. Woodall (Beverley), Mr. Wake. merchanW clerk (HuI, Mr. Brocklehurst, Mr. Pexton (Patrington), 1M Kidd (Charles-street, Hull), and several others 'whose names we have been unable to learn, most of whom were conveyed to the Railway HoteL The cause of the aocident appears' to have arisen from the negligence of the driver of the coal train, who did not pay due attention to the signals.".
IBELAND. _ THE SADLfIR8. (FROM OUP. - -- OWN (ORRFAPONDLNT.1 DUBLIN. TUtESbAY MnRINW -- vL wumt; ai a journais take a very desPonding view of the probable effect of the judgment of the House of Lords in the' appeal case of " O'FJaherty v. Wl'Dowell ;" and I the enormous amount of the costs of litigation be taken into account it must be admitted that the proVecta of the unhappy creditors are none of thebrightest. A Tipperary paper says,- ICThere is no douLbt Of the adverse operation of thle judg. inent of the House of Lords in the wase of ' O'Flahhery v M'Dowell' upon the interets of the creditors of the Tpperary BeDk, since nowtheironly means of recoverin their debts froia the properties of the shareholders are either by Interini jtdgments against individtal shareholders, an% xegisternnthoseas mortgages upou the properties (a law meouli to Irelad), or by awating the proceeds of cals of e official manager after his enforcing them. From the latter the creditors entertain little expectation. The Windlng-up Act *astubidto operation. at the instance of the 'Sadlecrs -and theo official matnage'r's services have as yet afrectedlittlefortbhecreditors.beyonddividinthe usets of the bank found in its coffers when it stopped. Among the properties offered for sale in the Encumbered Court in the month of next November is the fee simple estate, situate6in the barony of Ifs aud,Offa.west, belonging to J. W. Burinester, J. F,,lAw, J. Sadleir, a,d 0. Slaleir, and comprising an area of 4,192a. Ir.. 20p., ..annual rent 2,3781. 19s. 7d. The estate was formerly held by theEarl of Glengall, and is not liable to any quit or Crown rent& THE POTA-o CROP. As tbe fate of the potato crop in the south is be. ginniDg to cause some little uneasiness, the subjoined cautious statement from the'Cork Bxaminer of last night is not without interest:- ' " Various accounts continue to be received with respect to the state of the potato crop, according to the locality from which they come'; but there islitle dsc y t'o he ,observed in statements referring to the sae locality. From all the midland- counties the reportg ire detldedly favourable, both with respect to the yield of the crop and the absence of diseasc, and eyen from the interior portion of this county the accounts are comparatively satisfActory. But there is no doubt*hatever that the disease bas appeared in a marked and virulent form throughout an ektonsive dis; trict along the coast of the south. All the bad accounts we receive are from localities in almost the same situation *ith respect to being near the sea. The other'day a statement was made thtt in the vicinity of Skibbereen, the name of which is so memorable in the history of the blight, the crop was sound. We have ascertiined, from accurate authority, that this report is exactly the opposite of the fact. The potato crop in that locality is stated to be very exteneively infected,and also to be far iDferiortothat of last -earin the actual amount of produce. In the coniuonos di7ct sur rounding Bantry we have been informed that the blight has shown itself in some districts to a conisiderablei but sEti a less extent than last year, and alwo at a later period;. and further west, in the vicinty of Berehaven, we learn!rom a gentleman the crop has been attacked, but' tEo new seed is generally found to be esempt from the blight We have also received a letter from Dingle which we cannot give to-day, questioning the statement to whioh we referred lately, that the coantyof Herry was free from-the disease and stating that in certain parishes to the west of this county the crop is much blackened andjnured. However, I we have theassuratce of a clergyman that though such is the case with respectto theparishes referred to, on the oppo~ site side, 'from Dingle to Tralee, the crop'never looked so healthy.' Thus, the account which we give on A 'former ocasion is substantially confirmed. It is astisfactory to fi,d that the accounts from oth'er parts of the country concur in repreeentingthe crop as heilthy-and flourishing. Of course, it would be hkzard6us PA this time to m3ease the p oportion of the crop' affected, even in the localities to which the disease extends. But It may be observed that in later years tha :dise6se has not spread with the same rapidity or for the same length of time as was the case o0L te first appearance," ' ' ' THE BEMPAST RFIOTS. The Belfast Mercurj has some pertinent remarks upox the disgraceill wenes of riot which for ei-ht days were permitted to be enacted it, thenbitzineMi capital, to the surprise of every ope who ina6lgeA;ii -the hope that the age of pary.bsrb4ri nz'such as those had long sin.ce passed -aWay. - Xenjirgt iit the "green" rabble were the imocenta represented by their partisans, or that the 0raneen we'the amiable members of -society o oiy acted on the defensive, the Mlercury observes,- " The thing mos to be regretted in connexion with the late scandalous riots is that' both factions were not fired into, and taught a salutary lesson in the way that savage nature is most ataenable to instruction. Had suoh a rcourse been pursued on- the first or second night of the rioting, it would have proved the most mercifu, and the innocent would- not have suffered as they have done. No doubt, on such occasions there is the danger i that by firing on 'lawless riotets innocent lookers on maSy beacficed. Bat toobviate that dancer as much as possible the order was issued years ago that in quelling riots by such means the police and military should fire lowright into the body of the mob, and-not, by way of foolish threatening, over their heads- and in the case of such riots as for eight days disgraced Beffast, had the authorities intimated their determination to act with vigour, and not to all out the military for mere idle display, there would have been found inthe streets very few 'innocent' persons in- MAYNOOTH COLLEGE.

TIE LEi B .LAm WEsTmiNsTEm EsGH .-The annual dinner given at Pntney by the Leander Club to the Westminster Eights took place on hIonday. The crows met off Ienshaw's, but, as is usual on such occasions, in " jogging up together" the pace of the boats of the respective cIIbs soon became so accelerated as to assume the semblance of a trial of speed. The Westminsters left their stairs by the New Houses of Parliament with the Leander alongside of them, and soon gained the lead. The wind was blowing very strong from the west, andavery rough tide was running, in spite of which the Westminsters Increased the lead tili near Wandsworth. In the smoother water the Leanders Were able to shorten the distance between them and their guesats considerably, coming in through the bridge 13 strokes behind' them. Nothing could exceed the style in which the " Boys"V rowed, or the determined manner in which they brought' tbeir boat up gainst the strong gale blowing. The party then sat down to the usual plaini cold collation at the Star and Garter, and broke tap at an early hour in order to enable the two Westminster crews to reach hoine within the canonical hours.

PARLINMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, TUESDAY, JULY 28. Their Lordships met at 5 o'clock. COURTS OF RECONCILBmE?XT. Ioa BROUGa&n Wresented a petition from the mayor and corporation of Liverpool, to which he begged to caU the best attention of his noble and learned friend on the vwoolsack. The signatures to the petition included the names of the principal mercantile men and of the most respectable inhabitants of that great town, wvho appealed to their lordships on behalf e,f that which they believed would be a very great improv.,oent of the law. They stated that much injury was sufrered in society from litigation which might be prevented, rAl, that actions commenced, it might be in anger or in crror, were often continued through feelings of pride or resentmnent. He (Lord Brougham) might confirm this opinion of the petitioners by reminding their lordships that the examiners of the Court of Chaucery had stated that the great majority of cases which esme before them eli;her had been originally, or ia the course of the suits had-resolved themselves into, mere questions of costs, and had 'thus become the attorneym' actionsrather than these of tSe uominal plaintiffs and defenidants. Tho netitioners tVen stated their bellefthat what vere known as ,ourts of recencilement would bo efficacious in preventirg much useless and unnecessary litigation, and they praes1 the House a-cordingly. FRA.UDULENT TRUSTEES &c., BILL. The LORD CHANCELLOR, in moving the second rending of this Bill, stated that it had come up from the otherIHoue ofParliament, where it had been introduced by his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General, its object -'eing to remedy what was generally felt to be s serious 'defect ir. our present system of law. As tbe law had been handed down, not as a written code, but in a traditionary form from remote ages, it partook very much of the characteristics of the early state of society to which it had origlinlly been adapted. This was particularly the case with reference to the felonious appropriation of -the property of other3. It dealt with the matter in a way which was sufficient, no doubt, in a state of society when personal property consisted only of chattels properly-so called; but it was certainly not very adequate for thewants of the present day, when personal estate admitted of very complicated relations. The difficulty now experienced was this :-The trustee was the legal owner of the property committed to his charge, and the law, therefore, did not meet acase in which he improperly applied that property, which in the eye of the law tblonged to him and not to the beneficial owner. Now, this Bill proposed that if any person, being a trusteo, should with intent to defraud convert or appropriate thatproperty or any part of it to his own use he should boguiYty of a misdemeanoar. He had never heard any objection advanced to the principle of this measure, but objections of a technical nature had, he believed, been started. It was said that it would be extremely difficult to define what should constitute a person a trustee, but he thought that for all practical purposes this difficalty was sufficiently met by the interpretation clause. There was, however, one section of the Bill which would probably re. quire consideration and amendment, and which, as he knew, some of their lordships thought ought to be struck out altogether. The 12th section provided that no prosecution should be instituted against a trustee under this Bill without the sanction of some one of the judges of the superior courts of law or equity or of the Attorney-GeneraL Now, to make the judge who would eventually, perhaps, have to try the case act as a sort ,of grand jury beforehand was a course open to great obiection, and he should therefore feel bound to vary the clause upon this point. There was not the same difficulty In providingthat the sanction of the AttornreyGeneral should be obtained. That was a principle not unknown to our law, for in revenue prosecutions and some others no proceedings could take place without the previous consent of this functionary. He (the Lord Chancellor) was willing, therefore, to provide for the previous sanction of some legal functionary before a prosecution could be instituted against a trustee, because, considering the difEiculty of deciding what were and what were not misapplications of trust funds, it ought not to be in the power of a disappointed beneficiary to cast upon the trustee at his pleasure the slur of a criminal prosecution. The second section of the Bill rendered a banker criminally liable who fraudulently sold and applied for his own purposes the property intrusted to him. This was merely a small extenslonof the law as it stood at present. Another section provided for a most strange incident connected with our law, the existence of which persons unlearned in the law would with dwiculty credit. If a carrier fraudulently made away with a parcel intrusted to him for delivery the law did not hold him guilty of any misdemeanour. He became the bailleo, and was only responsible civilly to the owner of the property. This, no doubt, was owing to the fact that the offence in such a case did not answer the old form of indictment, cepit * eabduxit-a carrier did not take and carry away, because the property wasgiven to him. By the present Bill, however, tbi ofbnce would constitute a misdemeanour. Serious injury had resulted of late to large bodies of shareholders from the malpractices of directors and others; and this Bill rendered it a misdemeanour on the part of directors or officers fraudulently to misappropriate the money of the company, to keep fraudulent accounts, to wnifully destroy hooks, or publish fraudulent statements. These were the principal provsions of the measure, which would only put the law upon the footing on which it now rested in Scotland, and he hoped, therefore, their lordships would consent to give the Bill a second reading. Lord St. LEONARD'S did not rise to oppose this Bill - on the contrary, he approved a great portion of it, and gave it his hearty concurrence; but he very much lamented that it should have been found necessary to make trustees the subject of such highly penal provisions in case of their misapplication of trust funds. No doubt if a trustee, not meaning to aot dishonestly, but having the control of trustmoney, wasinduced by some tempting speculation to invest that money and so lost it, the beneficial owner suffered grievous wrong. If, however, he (Lord St. Leonard's) were asked who upon the whole had suffered most-persons entitled to trust money by the acts of their trustees, or trustees by misapprehension and neglect, through being pursued by the beneficial owners and compelled to make good the losses to the estate, he should be inclined to say that greater hardship was sustained by trustees in the honest discharge of their duties than was occasioned to beneficiaries by the acts of dishonest trustees. He could not but regret that it had been proposed to infliet so serious a punishment as penal servitude upon defaulting trustees, because he believed that under such a law it would be very difficult indeed, and almost impossible, to find any mau who would consent to become a trustee. The Bill did not distinctly define who should be considered a trustee under it, if it should become law. There was much of the Bill which be approved. It was a great improvement on the Bill which was at first submitted to Parlia. ment on this subject. The more he looked at it the stronger beeame his conviction that no honest trustee would be much endangered by its becoming law (hear, hear), but trustees in general would apprehend great danger from it. There had been many instances in which men of perfect honour had invested money belonging to those for whom they were trustees for their own benefit in speculations of different sorts. Nobody could defend that. If there was a profit those trustees put it into their own pockets, but if there was a loss it fell upon those for whom they were trustees. Nevertheless, the courts in this country had been accustomed to deal leniently with such cases, when it was clear that there was no intention to defraud. Their lordships were aware that he had laid on the table a Bill to relievo trustees who acted honestly, though erroneously, from the liabilities to which they were at present exposed. He had adready explained the nature of that Bil, which ho hopaed might pass into a law, because he felt confident that he Legislature relieved trustees from liability in respect of innocent breaches of trust men would refuse to act as trustees. Their lordshipsshouldbearinmindwhat was the relationship between a trustee and his cestui qmse tr-ust. Ithadalways been of a confidential nature. That confidence might have been abused, but surely those trustees who had, without any fraudulent intent, and in mere ignorance, committed a breach of trust ought to be protected against penal consequences. Latterly the office of trustee and executor had become a mere trade. Some parties had established a limited liability company for the purpose of performing for a certain profit the office of trustee and executor, and companies of that sorb must hereafter be resorted to unless the Legislature took care how they dealt with trustees who had no intention to defraud. But of course nothing could be more expensive than that. Hitherto the ofiee of trustee had been filled without the trustee receiving a single shilling of remuneration for his labour. If heavy responsibilities were now to be imposed by the law upon trustees, the Legislature ought to enact that trustees should be legally entitled to remuneration. But how were they to estimate the labour of trustees 9 If trustees were to be euNpected to sacrifice their time and risk their property 2ratuitously, the law ought not to deal harshly with them. fHe concurred with his noble and learned friend on the woolsack in thinking that that part of the Bill which enacted that a prosecution against a trustee should require the sanction of one of the judges ought to ha anenmied haor 51 . ., --- - - upon Tue recommendation of a judge his case would be thereby prejudged, and he would be sent, as it were, with a halter round his neck. Lord BROUGHADf reminded their lordships how anxious oe had always been for a measure of this sort, and how repeatedly he bad oomplained of the great defect and worse than anomaly in our law-an anomaly unknown to the law of every other country in the world-by which a breach of trust, instead of 'being .an aggravation of the offence, as it clearly ought to be, was a complete defenee, and a crime was converted into a mere debt. A Parliamentary cammittee was appointed to in uire into this eubject, and its members ound that crimina breaches of trmst, frauds, and thefts by trustees and quasi trustees, many -of whom were.executors, were of much more frequent occurrence than they had expected. It was found, also, that these breaches of trust chieTVy took place among per. sons of moderate circumstances, such as smaU tradesmen and.others. Individcuals in the higher ranks of life had the protection of professional advice and assistanos, and it was very rare that frauds could hba committed upon them. It was a very ordinary case that if a poor man succeeded to the value of 4001. or 5001. in stock in trade he was compled to proceed against the executor for pasyment, the tter having appropriated, not perhaps the whole, but the greater part of the funds intrusted to him, and the poor man being thus deprived of hie bequest. The case of a fraud and breach of trust by an ezecutor so frequsently occurred>. indeed, that the late Mr. Bell, one of the moe6 celebrated lawyers of the day, used to relate an anecdote on this subject of a family in Westmorland. Three -or four of the sons were tone daq talking about the profession they should choose. On.s = "I will be a farmer;" another said he would be a merchantanother, that he would be a soldier. One boy, however, to the surprise of the others, exclaimed, " I wil be an exeou- tor." Theysaid," Why will yoube an executor?" "Beeause," I be replied, " ever since father has been an executor we have never been without meat in our house." (A. laugh.) He mentioned this story in illustration of his position that i£ *.as munong persons of moderate circumstances that these Eraids most commonly occurred. In one case a man of rank andi fame in the profession of the law spent the whole of the py.operty of his two infant wards, died insolvent, and leftthem upon the parish. There was even an instance of a learned judge who wasted the property of bis infant ward. He thought the Bill well frarned in not going too far, and that great improvements had been adopted in it since it was first printed. A greater offence could not be committed than by an ordinary trr`steo in gambling with tho funds comnnitted to his chr rge, he gaining all the protits where the speculation was successful. There could be no doabt that if ttnst prope'rty Bo employed in speculation could be traced the trustev. could be made accountable to the person whose property 'he held in trust, who would be entitled to his full share of the profits so made. The difficulty of reaching sor.e descriptions of trustees and agents might be got over by the principle of payment. In Scotland a fraud was consi dered of an aggravated eharacter if it were corn3mitted Jy a trustee. he was informed by some of his friends among the Scottish judges that the operation of the law so that country was highly satisfactory, and that the law was so well known and the hazard incurred by the trastee .as so great that an instanco rarely occurred of a criminat p,osecution for this offence. Those learned persons, theme fore, rejoiced to find that England was taking a leaf oat of their book to the great benefit of English jurispra. deuce, and in that congratulation he fully participated. Lord WENSLEYDALE said, he - should not opposo the Eecond reading of tho Bill, which he was of opinion contained some provisions which were well entitled to their lordships' consideration. The measure had been very much improved in its progress througb the other House of Parliament, but it was, he thought, susceptible of stil further amendment. He did not, for instance, concur in the exDediency of passing into a law that portion of it which required that before a prosecution should be instituted the sanction of a judge or of the Attorney-General should be obtained. The sanction of the latter functionary was no doubt rendered necessary under the existing law in those cases in which questions relating to the revenuo or to a violation of the laws connected with the press or points of great political im ortance wore involved, but no such sanction was requirea nnder the operation of any other Act of a nature similar to that under their lordships' notice. The objection, however, which he entertained to the Bill upon that ground was one which could be dealt with only in committee. The Bill was then read a second time, as was also the Trustees Belief Bill. PRISONERS REMOVAL BILL. This Bill was read a third time and passed. PUBLIC WORKS (IRELAND) BILL. This Bill was read a second time, as was also the Turnpike Acts Continuance BilL BANKING BILL. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY, in moving the second reading of this Bill, took occasion to state that its object was to settle the mode in which banks were to be registered, and to apply to them certain provisions of the Joint-Stock Banks Act to the exclusion of the principle of limited liablity. After a few observations from Lord St. LEON1RD'S, The Bil was read a second time. The following BiUs passed through committee :-The Bill Chamber (Scotland) Bi, the Bankruptcy and Real Securities (Scotland)Bill, and the Pablic Health Act (Aldershott) Bill. MILITIA. BALLOT SUSPENSION BILL. Their lordships having gone into committee on this Bil, The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH suggested to the noble lord the Secretary for War that it would be advisable not to press on the Bill at present. It was impossible to say whatturn thepresent state of affairs mighttake or what stops it might be necessary to take in the next fortnight to strengthen the military resources of the country, and he tbought, therefore, that it wvould be advisable not to press on the Bill at present. Lord PANMURE believed that any man who attempted to put into execution a compulsory balot would totally fa'l For his own part he had great confidence ia the patriotic spirit of the people of this country, and he thought that under the voluntary system it would be quite possible to make any addition to the military strength of the country that might be deemed necessary. He could not therefore tbink that any advantage would arise from postponing the Bill. Lord DUNGANNON hoped that the confidence of the noble lord was not misplaced, but he feared that in conse quence of what had taken place in Ireland on disbanding the militia he might find more difficulty than he aaticipated. Ho quite concurred in the suggestion of the noble earl to postpone the measure. The clauses of the Bil were then agreed to. The Portland Harbour Bill and the Chatham Lands, &c., Bill were read a third time and passed. FREE LIBRARIES AND LITERARY INSTITUTIONS. The Duke of NEWCASTLE then rose to call the attention of Her Majesty's Government to the propriety of supplying, under certain regulations, free libraries and other 'terary institutions of the united kingdom with the reports and returns which are printed by the order of Parliament. A few years ago a committee of the other House of Parliament had been appointed to consider whether it would be desirable to distribute Parliamentary papers to those institutions, and that committee reported very favourably apon the subject; but that report had never betn acted upon. He most certainly did not advocate such a measure so mach for the benefit of any particular institution as for that of the public at large, for he believed that it would be a great national advantage that the mass of Parliamentary information, which was yearly increasing in value, should be placed within the reach of the pablic. All that was said in Parliament was daily communicated to the public, mnchto their advantage,through the instrumentality of the public press, while the reports upon which a great portion of their legislation was founded were practically unknown to the general body of the people. It was true that those papers had been made saleable, but that step had not been attended with the result which had been antici pated, for the public generaly did not know through what instrumentality they could obtain those papers, and, as booksellers received no profit upon them, they had no interest in giving any information upon the sabject. In the United States there was a most liberal dispensation of such papers, for all the papers, not only of the Federal Legilature, but also all those of the Legislatures of the various States were sent to the different literary institutions. In this country the principle had been admitted to a limited extent, for the papers connected with the Committee of Council and the Board of Health were circulated among the literary institutions throughout the country. He was aware that it would be necessary to exercise great discrimination as to the institutions to which those papers should be sent, but there was one class to which they might be certainly sent, and that was the class of institutions which had been estabhshed underwhat was called br. Ewart's Act, in such towns as Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Oxford, and other places. One advantage of distributing those papers would be to extend information to thoso who had no' the opportunity of seeing the papers themselves, because in county towns members of the press would have access to them, and would no doubt circulate the information which they might contain through the medium of their respective journals. The expense would not be very great; indeed he believed that MIr. Bausard in his evidence before the committee had estimated it at 1,5OOI. a-year, so that he did not think that any objection could be raised on that score. If the principle which he advocated were adopted it wouald then become necessary to consider under whose management the circulation of those papers should be placed, and there were two plans, either of which might be adopted. It might be placed under the management of one of the numerous departments of the Government connected with science and art, or it might be placed under the control of a committee of the other House, to be apppointed at the commencement of every session. He said a committee of the other House of Parliament because, while ali the papers which were laid on their lordships' table were presented to the House of Commons, many documents which were laidabefore that House were never presented to their lordships. His object in caling attention to this subject at this period of the session was that the Government might consider the report of the com mittee which sat four or five years ago, and might before the commencement of the next session be prepared with some method of carrying its recommendation into effect. The Duke of ARGYLL regretted that his noble friend (Earl Granville), to whose department this subject belonged, was unavoidably absent, having he belleved gone into the conutry to attend a meeting at some mechanics' institution. The calculation of his noble friend that the distribution of these blue-books and other documents would cost only 1,aO0I. per annum prevented there being any objection to the scheme on the ground of expense; but there would be some difficulty as to who should select the papers to be distributed. or his own part, he thought that the suggestion of the noble duke, that this duty should be performed either by the Department of Science and Art or the Committee of Councl on Education was well deserving of consideration. The subject altogether was weU worthy of attention, and he had no doubt would be weU considered by his noble friend the Lord President. Lord REDESDALE suggested that, in order to prevent these papers being sent to institutions which did not desire, or which would niakc no good use of them, the Government should require the payment of a small annual subscription. Lord TALBOT Dv M.ALA.HID]E hoped that if these papers were distributed they would be sent to Irish as weU as to English institutions. Lord STANLEY of ALDEIRLEY said, that the BoaTd of Trade had already, to a certain extent, acted upon the principle advocated by the noble duke by sending to the principal Chambers of Commerce in England the reports of consuls, which they hod received from tho Foreign-offico. With re,gard to the distribution of Parliamentary papers, he thought that they should he sent only to institutions which had a permanent existerce, and not to jthose which were oi so feeting a character as were somne mechanics' institu- After a few words from Lord DuNaGoN the subject dropped. PETTY SESSIONS IN IRELAND. Lord DUJNGANNON asked the Lord Chancellor whether mn the next session of ParLiament it was contemplated to alter and amend the presenlt Petty 6essional Acts in Ireland, s0 as to assimilate them to those now in force in Englaud and Wales ? The LORD CHANCELLOR said, that his right hon. friend the Attorney-General for lIeland had tkis subject under his consideration, and would next session. be prepared to introduce into Parliament a BiUl to consolidate anDd amend the Acts relating to petty sessions in Ireiand; hut not entirely to assimilate them to the English law upon the saase subsect, partly because he thought that the circumstances of Ireland rendered necessary some variations from the 2awws of England, and partly because in some respects he cc n- sidered th a fIead superior to that of the forsntr THE BUSINESS OF THE HOITSE. On the motion of Lord REDESDALE the following resolutions were agreed to: " That this Hfouse will net read any Bill a second time after Friday, the 7th day of August, except Bills of Aid o Supply, or any Bill in relation to which the House shall 1save resolved, before the second reading is moved, that the oirct;mXtances whEiob reuaezF legislation on tho subject of tbe same expedient aro either Of 'such recent occurrence or real urgency as to render the immediate coneiderat.iot of the same necessary.

HOVYSE OF COMMONS, TESDAY, JuLY 28. Tble SPEAXER took the chair at a quarter past 12 o'cock. DOVER AN9 BEVERLEY ELECTIONS. The SPEAKER acquainted the Eouse that certain petitioners, complaining of undue returns for Dover and Beverley, had intimated the intention of not taking further proceedings in reference to the matter of their petitions. GENERAL BOARD OF BEALTH BILL; Sir G. GREY, in moving that the House resolve into cotumittee on this Bill, stated that by several acts of Parliament general permanent powers had been established for the purpose of securing the public health, while a temporary authority alone had been provided by which those powers could be carried into execation. In the course of last year the General Board of Health, as at present constituted, was continued until the 29th of July in the present year, and until the end of the then next session of Parliament. It was therefore necessary that provision should be made for the continuance of the exercise of po.wers which in many parts of the country had proved very beneficial, in the event of the occurrence of any emergency, such as the breaking qnt of an epidemic. The Government thought it unnecessary to continue as a distinct and separate department the Board of Health, and were of opinion, now that a Vice-President of the Council of Education was appointed, with a seat in that House, that the powers vested in the Board of. Health might be placed in the hands of the President of the Conncil of Education, aided by the Vice-President. Thus the Parliamentary responsibility under the proposed arrangement would be quite as complete as at present, and a considerable saving would be effected to the public, as the salary of the President of the Board of. Health and other expenses connected with the board would be immediately reduced. The object of the present BiU was to transfer the powers of the General Board of Health to a committee of the Pdvy Council, but he understood some objection was entertained to the permanent character of the provisions of the measure.' A Bill amending the Public Health Act of 1848 had been i,troduced, the consideration of which had heen delayed so ling by circumstances that it was now impossible it could receive the attention it deserved during the present session. Therefore he admitted that it wonld not he reasonable to ask the House to provide by the BIl which he now proposed should be committed a-permanent authority to carry out the provisions of another measure which yet remained to be discussed, andc under the circumstances all ho should do would-be' to ask the House to alter the present - aeasure to a mere continuance Bill, but to connect with that continuance Bill enactments for the abolition of the office of the President of the Board of Health and the transference of the powers of that board for a temporary eriod to the Education Committee of the Privv Council. He should propose in committee that the present Bill should continue in force only until the 29th of July in next year, and to the end of the then next session of Parliament, and the whole subject in connexion with the Act of 1848 would come under the consideration of Parliaiaent in the ensuing year. Mr. KNIGET moved as an amendment that the House resolve into committee on the Bill on that daythree months. The only way to make the Board of Health do what was night was for the House to deoide that if a Bill amending the Act of 1848 was not submitted for consideration in the present session, the powers- of that board should expire. A number of new towns had grown tp with the increase oE population, and- instead of giving them proper municipal instilutions the Government, by the Public Health Act of 1848, had accorded to them a sort of bastard corporations, and had tried to- establish a centrat board to override all the towns in Englana. The powers of the Board of Healthhad been exercised ia the most offensive manner. The hon. member adverted to severai of the provisions of the Act of 1848, which he thought ought to be amended or repealed, and condemned the centralizing power exercised by the Board of Health... He also objected to the manner in which the subject had been dealt with by the introduction of temporary BiUs, and declared that he should not be satisfied with any measure which did not ynake the local boards of health independent corporations. Re had objections on constitutional grounds to these committes of the Privy Council, which he regarded as an innovation. (Hear, hear.) Sir G. PEC REEL objected altogether to the tranisference of the office of the Board of Health to the Privy Council; and he thought that,considering the state of public busiaes, thte time of the House might be better occupied than in de- llberating upon the provisions of the pr6stnt Bill. 31Mr. PALK said that the Bill held out the prospect of a saving of 3.0001. a-year to the country, - bat by a side wind it took the House wholly unprepared, and rendered perma'nent aU the clauses and powers of the Act of 1818, which bhad only existed from time to time by continuance BiUs. ,That Act had been found to cause great expenses in every district to which It had been applied, ind at the same time it was who?ly ineffective for its purpose, and promoted jobbing. He did not understand the reason of the proposed transference of the powers of the General Board of Health 'to theEducation Committee of the Privy Council, and as far as the saving went that might be effected by the transference of the powers to the Home-office. By refusng- to grant the present continuance BiU the House would compel the Government to bring the eubject under the attention of Parliament early next session. (Hear, hear.) 31r. COWPER said that the Municipal Act did not give the powers which were exercised under the Public Health Act in reference to drainage, cleansing, and aUl matters connected with the purification and improvement of dwellings in towns, and the consequence had been that something like 40 municipalities had adopted the Public Health Act, and bad found its powers of the greatest use and advantage. As for the statement that the Act of 1848 promoted jobbing, all he could say was that the power given to the central board was given to prevent jobbing on the partof the local boards, and all the powers complained of as arbitrary were simply exercised for the benefit of the inhiabitauts of towns by controllng those who governed them. The power of applying the Act against the wish of the inhabitants, though it existed on paper, was never exercised. In the case of Sandgate the mischief arose from the mismanagement of the local board in employing improper people to do their work, and vesting In one individual functions which he was not able to perform. The case of Croydon had been much talked of, but he had lately made inquiries of all the medical men and others in that town as to its state. The answer of Dr. Carpenter, confirmed by all the rest, was to the effect that the drainage of Croydon under the local board had effected great sanitary improvement. The evil which hid been elt there had been corrected by the efforts of the General Board of Health. The exertions of the General Board of Health had led to London being supplied with pure water, but still other towns stood in need of that p rime necessity. A valuable report was being prepared by the General Board of Health on the subject of the wanning and ventilation of the dwellings of the poor, which would be productive of great advantage. Then there was the subject of vaccination, the law on which could not remain as it was, and an enormous mortality arising from smallpox and imperfect vaccination might be checked and prevented by the intervention of a ceatral department. Again the adulteration of food and drugs were matters to deal with which it was necessary to have some central authority. He therefore hoped the House would not be of opmion that it coald abolish the Board of Health without establishing some central department in its place. Sir G. GREY said he was anxious to meet in a spirit of fairness the opponents of the measure, and, admitting that It was desirable that some security should be taken for the consideration of the whole subject next year, he had proposed tohlimit the operation of the Bill according to the usual Parliamentary practice; but, as distrust had been expressed, he was willing to depart from that form, and instead of limiting the operation of the Bill to the 29th of July next year, and to the end of the then next session of Parliament, he would propose a fixed day next year,-the Ist of September,-beyond which the BiUl should not operate. (Hear, hear.) If, however, the House preferred to have a mere continuance Act, tho Government could have no other objection to that course being adopted except that it would involve an expense of some 3,000 or 4,0001. a year to the country. Mr. A.YRTON said that if the right hon. gentleman contented himself with a simple continuance Act until the lt of September next year he would meet the views of all who opposed the present Bill, but ib he went further, and insisted on the transference of the powers of the Board of Health to the Privy Council, he would be met with opposition. It was said that a saving would be effected by this Bill in consequence of the abolition of the office of President of the Board of Health, hbt the same saving might be effected without the Bill by the Government appointing, until the whole question should be discussed. some one now in office to perform the duties under the Bill for the salary he at present received. From the speech of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Cowper) it would seem that the action of the central authority was to be extended to almost every matter, as if the people of England were wholly unable to take care of themselves. (Eear, hear.) He, however, was of opinion that bad local government was better than the best central government, for the political health of the people was even of more importance in the end than their bodily bealth. Sir W. HEATHCOTE said it seemed to him that now the only question before the House was whether in the continuance Bill the powers of the Board of Health should be transferred to another authority. He thought that that was an important part of the matter which waste come under consideration at a future period, and the House snous not anticipate a decision oni itby adopting the provision as to the transfer of powers in the present BilL (Hear.) It would be much better to make this Bi a mere continuance BilL (Hear, hear.) MIr. T. DUNCOMBE said that last September a gentleman who represented the Board of Health attended a congress at Brussels. He made a speech, and above all other things he recommended the people there to have Boards of Health. (Laughter.) H l. COWPER.-e was not a member of the Board of Mr. T. DUNCOMBE said that, at aU events, that gentle. man made a speech in the presence of the Board of Health, and was cheered by the Board of Eealth. (Laughter.) He said the people of Belgium had no idea what Boards of Health had done for England, and tLat by their means the mortalty in nearly 200 towns in England had been diminished about 50 per cent. (A. laugh.) But he did not s6op tbere, but went on to state that the fecunditv of the hatd hanl by the same means been quadrupled. That was corssolat!on to the country gentlemen. (Laughter.) Now, with regard to the present continuanco Bill, he (fr. Dnncombe) objected to the continuance of the Board of Health for six montls, "id if economy was to be effected by the Bill he asked, wh,y aheoi, not tho salaries of tho Boa d of Health be redulced at bcnce ? The board wvas excpensive and totally useless, anXd should he done away with. As for its superintend2nce in respect to the aupplyof wJ.ter in certain towns, the Homemr Department or Board of Works might andertake T'ord EBRINGTON defended the administration of tho Board of Health, contending that the sanitary condition of the great towns had materially improved since the passinE of the Pablic Health Act. According to the testimony of aU ministers of religion dirt, disease, and crime were concurrent, and the Public Health Act was passed becaaso many towns enjoying the benefits of tho lInnicipal Reform Act were, nevertheless, in an unsatisfactory state. A number of those towns subsequently availed themselves of the provisions of the Act. Having devoted many years of his life to the promotion of sanitary reform, and believing it to be connected with the moral and religions improvement of the people, he could not avoid expressing a hope that the House would not abaudon tho principle of legislation which it had adopted on this subject. (He3r, hear.) Mr. HENLEY would prefer to see the Board of Health remaining where it was until the whole subject should be debated next session, and the economy proposed to be carried out could still be effected by the right hon. gentle. man (Mr. Cowper) undertaking in the meanwhile duties with whlch he was familiar connected with that Board. The House then divided, when the numbers appeared,- For the amendment ... ... ... ... 73 Againstit ... ... ,.. ... 98 Majority ... ... ... ... -25 The House accordingly resolved into committee on the Bill. The first clause was then read, providing that, on the ap. pointment of a Committee of Council for lealth, the General Board of Realth should cease, and its powers should be transferred to such committee. Sir G. PECHELL opposed the clause2 After some discussion, I.. Sir G. GREY consented to introduco a simple continuauce Bill, without the transfer of powers to a Committee of Council, and stated that in the appointment of a President of the Boardof Health the object of the Government would be to avoid throwing a charge on the conntry. The House then resumed. YARMOUTH ELECTION COMMITEE. The Earl of MARCH appeared at the bar and reported from the Yarmouth Election Committee that Charles Woolven had that day been guilty of prevarication, and had otherwise misbehaved himself in giving evidence before the committee; and had in consequence been committed to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms. The noble earl having presented the report, moved that the said Charles Woolven be committed to the gaol of Newgate until further orders from the House, and that the Speaker issue his warrant accordingly. The motion was agreed to, and the House then suspended its sittings at a quarter to I o'clock. The House resumed at 6 o'clock. Petitions were presented by Sir G. MowGoo%nmRy, from the magistrates and town-council of the burgh of Peebles, against the Police (Scotland) BiUl; by Mr. W.

RID)LEY asked the First Commissioner of Works whether he could inform the House if there was any probability of steps being taken for carrying out the provisions of the Metropolis Act, by which it was determined that the rivcr Thames should be freed from the sewage of the metropolis. The hon. gentleman said he understood that the health of several officers of the House, and of persons required to attend their proceedings, had been affected by the noxious effluvium arising from the River Thames. Mr. BUTLER asked the First Commissioner of Works when the question of the main drainage of the metropolis was referred to the professionalgentlemen appointed by him to consider the subject; whether the referees were likely to miake their report before the close of the present session; and what course the First Commissioner proposed to take after he received such report, so that no delay might occur in the commencement of the works. Sir B. HALL replied that by the Metropolitan Act of 1855 it was providedthat large intercepting sewers should be made for the purpose of diverting the sewage from the Thames. It was also. provided that those works should be carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works, but that before any works were commenced the plans shoald be submitted to the First Commissioner of Works for his approval. He was anxious to show that so far as the Government were concerned not a day had been lost in dealing with this important subject. Plans-were sent to him by the Metropelltan Board of Works on the 22d of December, and on the 29th of December he referred them to the engineers. In reply to the second question of the hon. member for the Tower Hamlets (Mr. Btntler), he was happy to state that he had to-day seen one of the referees, who informed him that their report would be delivered before the end of this week; and in answer to the hon. gentleman's third question, he could only say that as soon as he received that report he would forward a copy to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and would lay another copy upon the table of the House. With regard to the question of the hon. member for Newcastle-on-Tyne (Mr. Ridley), he could only state that the matter to which he referred rested entirely with the Metropolitan Board of Works. No delay had taken place in his department. He would forward the report of the referees to the .etropolitan Board of Works without any delay, and no doubt they would give that report their immediate coneideration. NEW SOUTH WALES. In reply to a question fros Sir T. ELnHi-NsToiN-, Mr. LABOUCE ERE said that some misconception existed with respect to a reply he had given to a question put to him a few days ago as to tho proposed boundaryline of separation between the colonies of Moreton Bay and New South Wales. He was represented to have said that that boundary line would be between 25 and 25 degrees of south latitude. If he had said so he had made an incorrect statement. The boundary line would lie between the degrees ot28 and 29 south latitude, CONVEYAITCE OF MAILS BY RAIL. Mr. WILSON, in reply to Ur. BULLBtR, said, considering the state of the public business and the advanced period of the session, it was impossible that the BiU relating to the conveyance of mails by railway could be properly discussed before the session terminated with any hope of its being passed into a law, and, under these circumstances, It was not his intention to proceed further with the second reading of the Bill, but he would take an early opportunity of reintroducing it next session. He should tberefore move that the order for its second reading be discharged. The motion was agreed to. THE COMENG INDIAN MAIL, Mr. W. EWART said, seeing the noble lord at the head of the Government in his place, he begged to ask him whether any intelligence had been received by HIer Majesty's Government from India in the course of tho day. Lord PALMERSTON.-The only intelligence which has been received officially by Her Majesty's Government is from Trieste, and the intelligence is that tho packet is in sight, and is expected in the course of an hour. That was at 10 o'clock this morning. I have seen a telegraphic mis. sage which has been received by a private individual, and w2bich is supposed to have come from Turin, but I don't know wbether th3t is authentic or not. The Govermment, however, have received no information except that whilch have mentioned. The probability is, that as the paokat was off Trieste at 10 o'clock this morning, we shall in a very short time have some official intelligence from that plaoe REVISION OF THE LITURGY. Lord R. GROSVENOIR postponed for this seniors, oiz the ground of indisposition, his motion for a commissions for the purpose of considering whether the Liturgy of thlo Church of England is capable of modification., MILITARY EDUCATION. Sir DE LACY EVANS, pursuant to notice, proceedelftb bring forward his resolution suggesting a higher standard of professional instraction and a more complete provision for it than has heretofore obtained for officors in the army, and especially the stafl. He said the subject was one to whiclr public attention had been directed withjWthe last few years by a remarkable concurrence of ciroujnastances, among whiclb were the reports of committees of 1that House, a very important one especially drawn up b ythecom isionersappointel by the Secretary for War, aud the very able speech made ia that Hlouse last session by the right hon. gentlemau thmember for Sough Wilts (Ir. Sidney Herbert). He, ventured to think, however, that some o:her means. were necessary for securing the object which that right hon. gentlemau aud himsel* had in view, and' it wAs to that end that he had to sabmit to the, ;lfouse a resolution which he trusted would meet with the sanction of the Government. He hoped, indeed, that it. would be received by the Government in the same spirit a s the somewhat kindred proposal made recently by the nobler lord the member for the West Riding (Lord Goderich) with respect to the civil service had been entertained by them, believing, as he did, that its adoption, like that of the motion of the noble lord, would strengthen the hands of the, Government. He might remind the House that in. 1799 a staff college was first formed in this country, and that it rendered important services to thcarmy of that day; but after the termInation of the. Peninsular war the institation was reduced from year to year until it ceased to possess the means of imparting instruction to anything hke the extent which it had originally done. In 1832 all Parliamentary aid was withdrawn from', the college, and he believed the Under-Secretary for Warrecently stated in the House that during the last two or three years scarcely a single officer had presented himself' for admission into it. There might perhaps have been some. balf-dozen who had receivedinstruction intheinstitutionsinB that time; bithe was not sure about that. At al events, he thought that was a state of things which ought not to exist. There was evidence in reports which had been laid before both Houses of Parliament that Austria, France, Pzussia, and other military nations applied money to the purpose. The United Stateq, finding in 1814 that their officers wera singularly wanting in knowledge, and that they had probably suffered some defeats in consequence, established X miitary school at West Point on a very extensive scale, and he believed that West Point College was adapted to theplan, as near as possible, of the Ecole Polytechnique of France, though perhaps not so exclusively military in itsobject. He would quote, as an authority upon the necessity of military education of a high standard, Frederick theGreat, in whose memoirs, after the seven years' war, he found this passage :- " The armny had made numerous campaigns, but the quartermaster-general was often in want of good officers for his department. The King wished to form a corps of such officers, and selected 12 individuals, who already possessed some slight acquaintance with engineer duties, for the pur.- pose of instracting them himself. With this view they were made to sketch country, mark off camps, fortify villages, intrench heights, construct stockades, regulate columns of march, and, above all, to try the nature of maTshes and the depth of streams themselves, that they might not be deceived by the negligence of orhers, an& cause an army to depend upon the defensive support of a fordable river, or of a marsh which infantry could eross without being ancle deep." Sir Howard Douglas, one of the most competent, exeriencel, and scientific of our officers, gave most importauc evidence before the committee of the House appointed to inquireinto the subject, and Sir I. Douglas, Colonel Portlock, Colonel Adams, Colonel Addison, and Colonel Prosser, who were particularly engaged in military instruction, gave it as their opinion that the senior and junior departments of the college at Sandhurst were in a mnost unsatisfactory state, and required revision and reform. The pressure of undue influence, however well-intentionedthe au- thorities might be, required that some preventive, such as. had been adopted by continental Governments, should be established, and he ventured to think that none would be so efficient as the introduction of the comoetitive system ofexamination. The committee stated in-their report- " The government of the college is vested in the Board of Commissioners. The official members, in addition to the Governor and Deputy-Governor of the college, are the Commauder-in-Chief, the Secretary at War, the Master-General of the Ordnance, the Quartermaster-General, and Adjutant. General. It is obvious that the pressing and important. duties which fall on these officers can leave them bet little time to devote to the military college." There should be an independent board !to conduct the examinations. The report mentioned that during the Peninsular war, when the general staff was very efficient, a great part of the Quartermaater-General's staff was composed of officers who had been educated at the, senior department. The report expressed an opinion. that the present state of things in the senior departmen: was unsatisfactory, and required revision and reform. The commitee were of opinion that the transferring froum the junior to the senior department a military staif officer was not sufficient. They saw no means of placing the senior department on an efficient footing unless Parliament was prepared to grant aid to that important object. They did not see the ustice by which the cadet was called on to pay for the education of the staff officers The cadets, or rather the families of the cadets, were called onto pay for the education of the staff-officers of the army,. and that system continued for many years, if not to some extent to the present time. The House should recoUec' that during the last half century this country had been, making great proaress, and in no respect greater progress than in education. The grants of public money had gone on in. creasing year by year, and for national schools, factory schools, union workbouse schools, prison schools, &c., theynow amounted to 500,0004 sterling. There was a very handsome expenditure, amounting to 18,5004 this year, for the education of non-commissioned officers, and. privates, and the total suxm. if the children of soldiers were included, was 46,0001. But for officers and especially officers of the army, the sumvwasattheoutslde l.3:s!. It was an extriordinary contrast, and he beheved had bean remarked upon by the Secretary of State. for War in another place. The right hon. gentlemmn the member for South Wiltshire estimated the expense of putting the education of the officers upon a reliable footing, by the appointment of boards of examination, at 5,0001., and sR vote for that amount appeared in the estimates, but unfortunately the right hon. gentleman left office, and the voto dropped out of the estimates. The right hon. gentleman, in a statement upon the subject last year, expressed some disappointment that the Government had come to no decision upon the subject, and that there was no item of the sort in the estimates. Another year brought only the sAme result, and it was a good reason for wishing, at all events, if not to express distrust of the intentions of the Government, to stimulate the Government to use more promptitude and exertion. (Hear.) The first resolution which he should submit was,- "That in the opinion of this House a higher standard of professional instruction and more cornplete provision for it than hitherto deemed requisite ought to be established for the commissioned ranks of the army, bhu especially for the, staff." He ventured to think that that was a proposi'ion which vwas already concurred in not only by the House, but by the country. (Elear, bear.) His resolutian then went on t- state that the object which he had in view " will be besb promoted by recourse to competitive examination of officers desiring to qualify themselves for the staff, and by adopting the same principle, with such qualification as may be necessary, in examinatioa of cand dates nominated bj the Commander;in-Chief for commissions in the cavalry and in. fantry." No fair objection, he thought, could be taken to a certain degree of co':npetitive examination in the case of candidates for staff appointments. Such an examination prevailed in our universities, where the first men of the land-those who occupled leading positions in the twoHouses of Parliament-wiliHngly exposed themselves to aN ordeal similar to that which he proposed for officers. seeking appointmtents on the staff. Even those who did not seek for honours were obliged to pas. an examination, and in many instances they werewhat university men called ' plu*ked." (A lau;h,.) He saw no reason why the officers of the army should not run the risk of being "plucked" also. The officers of the navy were compelled to pass an examination not only for their first, but likewise for their second and third commissions. In 1849, as stated by the right lion, gentleman the memiber for South Wilts an his aditrable letter to Lord Hardinge oF' December, 185 t, the Duke oi Wellington issued an order declaring that for the future there should be an examination of officers for lientenancies as well as for first commissions Notwithstanding the authority of that great man, his proposition with respect to lenSenancies was rtevor carr-Aint^ osene; but, as there was a solmilar ex aamintion in forei armies and in our own navy, it was to be hope d that it might eh renewed. The officers ofr the navy wer undoubtedly more Professional than the officers of the army, and therefore the latter neednot be ashamed to imitate s orne of their proceedings. His resolution next proceeded to urge the expediency of " Preserving the presenit system ofadmission of cadets for the Ordnanoo Corns." He Would not presumae to pass any censuire upon the officers of the. army, and woulclevenavoidquotingthaostatemetsftbfDaf of Wellington, although they were wel k-nown to be v-ery strong, both against the caisiacter of our private soldiers and the efficiency of our officers. The blaame lay, not with the officers, but with the Government,which did not provido the officers with due opportunaities for acqniking that information which it was desirable they should possess In order to the satisfactory discharge of their duties. Some ot tegreatestg authoritieswhob hdwritten upo the Peninsaular sieges had declared that the principal drawback experienced in carrying on those operations arose from an entire want of even rudimentary knowledge on the part of our officers, particularly referring to the ignoranice of the officers and men of the line of tho elementary instruction neces-sary for assisting as working parties. That wats not the fault of the officers, but was owing to the comabined neglect an& favouritism which had so long prevailed in the army. The, present system of admnission of cadets for thbe Ordnance Corps was introduced by tho Duke of Newcastle. It was an open competitive system, and he believed had been fouLnd to work well. He was anxious that it should be preserved, and trusted thatthiere was no truth in the report which had reached him that there was some inclination in certaiua quarters to alter it.

LONDON, WEDN:ESDAY. JULY 29A 1S57. In the House of Lords last night, The Fraudulent Trustees Bill was read a second time on the motion of the LoRD CncMLOt The Duke of EwcAST called the attentioij of the Government to the propriety of supplying Iree libraries and other literary institutions with the reports and returns published by Parlinaent. The Duke of AmGYI admitted that the subject was well worthy of consideration. Some other business was then despatched, After which their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, at the early siding, on the order for going into Committee npou the Geneial Board of IHealth Bill, Sir G. GREY said it was not his intention to persevere in making this a permanent Bil, but he would propose in the Committee to make it a continuance Bill, extending the Aet of 1848 for another year, transferring the powers of the General Board of Health to a Committee of thePrvy7 Council. Mr. KNIGHT, urging various objections to the existing law, moved to defer the =econd reading of the Bil for three months. lThis motion was supportedby Sir G. PECHEL ana MIr. PAL.E. Mr. CowraR insisted upon the zanitAry improvemenits and the reduction of mortality whic1 had resulted from the working of the present 1Jw, and
The Mail which left Bombay on the 1st of this month, sixteen days after the previous departure, may be considered to report affairs as unchanged as they could be in that interval. The Mutiny had continued to spread in the Bengal Army, ,which was to be foreseen; but it had evidertly not exceeded its original bounds. Delhi had not: beeni captured, but the insurgents had betrayed the weaknessoftheirposition bysome considerable sorties, and their own want of courage, discipline, or generaiship by being beaten with great slaughter. So far as regards the besiegers and the besieged time would be in favour of the former, injurious as the example would be in other parts of India. The peaceful and industrious population of Bengal Proper watch the struggle much as we do, only having much more to lose and much less to do. However, as a measure of precaution, t4et native regiments at Calcutta and Barrackpore had been quietly disarmed. At Madras there was an 'uneasy feeling, but neither there nor at Bombay was there the slightest sign of disaffection. Nothing is reported of the Punjab. Here, then, it is evident that the Mutiny is confined to the North-West Provinces, far in the interior, and surrounded by a circle of order and loyalty. On every side our basis of operations is undisturbed, and, at the very worst, it is now little more than one of those local wars 'with a State or confederacy, such as we have had a dozen times over since the beginning of the century. We have no wish whatever to inake the best of the news, but it certainly would cost a little v-iolence to torture more out of it. The worst is told when it is stated that Delhi -was still in the hands of the insurgents; but when we know that General BARNAiJD had only three or four thousand Europeans, while the insurgents were much more numerous, and, in addition to a fanatical population, better provided with artillery and ammunition, we can make allowance for the policy of not bringing the strtuggle to an immediate issue within the ramparts and streets of the city. Every week is now adding to the European force at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief in Bengal, and by this time he must have diverted a considerable part of the Chinese Expedition to a more urgent purpose. As fast as reinforcements arrive at Calcutta, and at the great cities on the Ganges, the nlutinCers higher up will feel the grouud sinking under them, and the toils drawing closer round their lair. Unable to make an impression on any British encampment, short of supplies, and waiting the slow onward march of an irresistible foe, they will soon find disunion and treachery in their own ranks, and those who are still in a condition to make terms for themselves will avoid the evil partnership of men whose crimes are past forgiveness. Thoso incurable though unsuccessful intriguers, the ex-Kting of OuDx and his Minister, had been detected in correspondence with the mutineers and put out of harm's way in Fort William. It will be remembered that before the annexation of Oude the weakness of the Royal Family and its utter want of principle had drawn it into the habit of intriguing with one faction against another; and Mahomedans and EHindoos were destroying one another, both with the Royal warrant. These intrigues, it was said in those days, necessarily ramified throughout all India, as there was hardly a regiment in our service in which was not to be found both Mahomedans and 7Tindoos with relations and friends in the kdngdom of Oude, and engaged in its quarrels. It was not to be expected that his ex-Majesty could keep long out of his own element of faction. Whether he had much hand in causing the Mutiny is of little importance; but so long as he was at large he probably had no more power of keeping clear of it than the miserable puppet in the Palace of Delhi. However, he is now in good hands; and, as Government has proof of his share in the conspiracy, the stoppage of his allowance will contribute to pay the costs of the war. These measures-the disarming of the natives, and the impriso4pment of the ex-King of OUDE, ahow a state of things rather new to the quiet population of Calcutta. It had also been considered necessary to pass an Act placing the Press under a license system. Of so bare an annoincement nothing can be said. No doubt, the Press must acknowledge " a state of siege ;" but India has not suffered hitherto from too free a discussion of political questions, or too much knowledge of public affairs. The news from China would be very important if any news could now be important which did not bear directlyon the great struggle going on underthe walls of Delhl. But here, as in India, the progress of affairs has been much what might have been anticipated. The Chinese figlht with increasing pertinacity and discipline, and show themselves not only better soldiers than in the last war, but even more successful. In two engagements they have killed and wounded altogether 83 of our men. They have not, however, been able to avert the total destruction of their fleet. Our flotilla of gunboats, having done this service, wil now be able to visit all the river forts, and show themselves at Canton without interruption. As that city is thus actually in our power, there seems no substantial reason why the mere proof of this should not obtain for us all the objects of the expedition without further bloodshed or military operations. The steamer which brought this Mail arrived at Trieste at 9 o'clock yesterday morning, and there was no mechanical reason why the news should not have been delivered in this metropolis in time for our Second Edition. It is difficult to say whether the rumour spread in the StockExchange yesterday, and preceded by some heavy sales, was a safe guess, or really what was aleged, a dlespateh from Trieste via Turin. The particulars of the rumour were either matters of general notoriety or very probable. It was known that the cholera had committed great ravages, that General BAnNARD had been delayed by want od supplies, and that some native regiments had been 'disarmed at Calcutta, while few people were yesterday morning so sanguine as to expect that Delhi had been taken. Yet, on the whole, the rumour is so like the despatch, that we cannot but suspect it the work of the wire. Why, then, should it produce so much dismay, and send the funds down more than a half per cent. ? The answer is, that a mere rumour always is more terrible than an authentic statement, and half a report always worse than a whole one. A rumour professes to be only a fragment of a more important whole, and leaves much to the I imagination. It striles onthe earlikethe echodr distant booming of a louder report. At] il events, in the despatch before us we see no reason why the funds should fall. It is, then, for the interest of the public and the abatemont of, unneceasary alarm, that we should have as fUll news and as early as can be, and that ho speculator, or other private person, should be allowed to anticipato us, and pre-engage the public mind with a garbled, and therefore alarming report, dreamed up, of course, expressly to influence the market.
TIEOrAS FuLL=R BACoN has been convicted, at last. After escaping the perils of an indictment. for arson, and a still more serious charge of mprdering his two infant children, he has at length been found guilty of having administered poisoa to his own mother with the intention of destroying her life. The circumstances of the case are curious, not only from the peculiar history. of the prisoner, for he had already been twice accused and twice acquitted upon most weighty charges-not only from the terrible character of the offence for which he stood arraigned, for this. was nothing less than the deliberate murder of his own mother, but from the length of time which had elapsed since the perpetration of the offence and the nature of the evidence by which alone it could be supported. Upwards of two years have passed away since the crime was committed, if the crime was committed at all. It was necessary to exhume the body in order to procure proof of the cause of death, for it does not seem that any suspicion existed even in the minn of the medical gentleman who had attended on the deceased during her last ilness that her death was due to the administration of poison. Wow, the death occurred on Tuesday night, the U1th of May, 1855. The first question, then, for decision was, did ANN BACON die by poison, and was that poison arsenic? This question must be answered in the affirmative, if we are to place any reliance upon the conclusions of scientific men. The body was exhumed in February of the present year, so that neaily two years had elapsed since the date of the death. The presence of a very small quantity of arsenic was established on the authority of Dr. ALRaED TAYLO, the Lecturer on Chymuitry and Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital. This, however, was not the real point. The conclusion that the deceased had swallowed a large quantity of arsenic rested upon the fact that the viscera were found in such a high state of preservation as to exclude any other hypothesis than that arsenic, or some arsenical preparation, had been administered to her in large quantity during life. " The contents of the abdo"men," said Dr. TAxnoR, "w were well preserved. "That is an ordinary effect of arsenic. The "parts described by Mr. JAcisow," the surgeon who made the post mortem examination, " were "placed in a jar. I have had occasion to observe "that copper and antimony will preserve, but I "never saw viscera-preserved as in this case, save "by arsenic." This seems positive enough, but we furthermore find that Dr. TAYLOR, according to the report of his evidence, said-" Considering "the length of time between the death and the "exhumation, my opinion is that the preservation "of the parts co2d only be attributed to arsenic,"arsenic having been found there." More than this, the poison must have been admninistered dluing life, for at the time of death there was more in the intestines than in the stomach;the poison was passing out of the body. If, then, any reliance can be placed upon scientific testimony and chymical analysis, Aix BACON died, if not from arsenic, at least after having been dosed with arsenic. The symptoms of her Iast illness, as vwitnessed at the time and described at the trial by the medical gentleman in attendance upon her, tally perfectly with this view of the case, althougli he does not seem to have had any suspicion in May, 1855, that his patient was dying by poison. Still, we say, despite of the slight degree of hesitation which may arise from this circumstance, there can be no reasonable doubt that 'NN BACON was poisoned-poisoned by arsenic, although the medical evidence was not sufficiently clear and decided to warrant a conviction for actual murder. There was a gap between the exhibition of the arsenical symptoms and the last thrues of the deceased, which was not filled up by the testimony of the medical witness, and consequently the charge of murder was abandoned. The next question is-assuming that ANN BACON was dosed with arsenic just before her death-was this by her own act?7-was it the result of accident 7-was it by the act of some other person ? If so, on whom does the guilt rest ? The Lincoln jury on Saturday last found that the guilty man was THoias FuLLR BACON -that the son poisoned, or endeavoured to poison, his own mother. The hypothesis of suicide is so completely negatived by the facts of the case that it will be unnecessary to dwell on it for a moment. Acc:dent there may possibly have been, though this explanation is very improbable, as the reader may judge after consideration of the case. There remains the suggestion that AXN BACON was poisoned intentionally by a human hand, and the jury have decided that that hand was the hand of her own son. The ascertained facts are briefly as follows *-ANx BACON lived at Stamford; she was possessed of some little propertyquite enough to be an inducement to a person in the prisoner's condition of life to wish her out of the way, although it would be in the highest degree unfair and irrational to infer the coninission of so heinous a crime from the mere fact that the death of the mother would benefit the son. If reasonable grounds, however, can be shown aliunde for the supposition that TnomAs BAcoN did give poison to his mother, there is the motive. It appears that on the 12th of May, 1855, ANN BACON was in her usual state oi health. On the following day, Sunday, she dined with the prisoner, and was during the dinmer seized with vomitings and purgings. Who was present at this dinner v We do not find this stated. It would surely have been a proceeding of some risk to administer poison to one out of several at a common repast. The prisoner immediately ran for the medical gentleman-Mr. B3AnnE-who had attended his mother during an illness in the previous -arch. He considered the case at the time to be one of English cholera, and administered an astringent and an anodyne. " My " view of the case," said Mr. BABUBm, " was "that ANN BACON had been ill from an " attack of brain fever in March, that she had "an attack of English cholera on Sunday, and on "Tuesday symptoms of a disease of the brain." Still, the symptoms on the Sunday and Monday were consistent with the hypothesis of poisoning by arsenic, and the symptoms on Tuesday might have been the secondary symptoms of arsenic. It is but fair to the convict BACON to add, that his conduct during his mother's illness -a buch as might have been expected frora an innocent man. Immediately she was taken ill he ran for the doctor who had attended her during her previous illness. . 'When she was remqved from his house to her own, at about 6 p.mt on the Sunday evening, his siter-in-law was 'ent for, and found THoMAs BACON in attendance upon his mother. During the Monday and Tmesday he came at intervals, sometimes with his wife; to see her. His wife, it will be remembered, is now in the madhouse, to which she has been consigned for the murder of her two children while under the prohipting*`of insanity. There is no reason to suppose 'that ANN BACON -was again dosed with arsenic after 'her removal to her own house, although some mention was made of a square bottle-unlike a medicine, bottlecontaining some whitish liquid, which the sisterin-law imagined to be peppermint-*ater, and which THoUAs BAcoN 'removed after his mother's death. No great importance, however, seems to have been attached to this incident. Substantially it would appear, both from the sequence of the sYmptoms and from the degree and nature of the surveillance under which she was held, that Ai. BAcoa did not receive any more poison after lher removal to her own house on the Sunday evening at 6 o'clock. The question is, had the prisonler given her poison previously at his ownrl house-during the dinner on the Sunday afternoon ? One point that told greatly against him was, that asemnic was clearly traced into his possession just before the time at which the fatal event occurred. About a week before ANW BAcoN's death the prisoner had sent his apprentice to purcha'e sixpennyworth' of arsenic from a neighbouring druggist; bat the druggist had very properly refused to supply it. TRo3rAs BACON told the lad that he wanted the arsenic for the purpose of hardening iron. It does not, however, appear that arsenic is used in that process, neither was there any hardening 'work forward .in his shop at the time; at least, so said the apprentice. Again, on the 8th' of May THomtAs BAcoiN purchased twopennyworth of arsenic from a druggist at Stanmford, but he bouggAt it publicly; he signed the book in the presence of a witness whom he himself called in. If he was a murderer, then, in act or in intention, he was a very clumsy one. Arseic, however, there was, no doubt, in his house on Sunday, the 13th of. May, and it would' seem tolerably clear that AN BACON, at his house on that day, pirtook of some composition which 'had been drugged with arsenic. Was the poison inserted by the hand of her son, THOMAs BACON ? To this question the jury say, " Ay !" On the other hand, we must not forget that' there was present in the household another person, who has since been found guilty-as far as an insane person can be guilty-of the murder of her two children. The case is one which admits of doubts in favour- of the convict, for 'the circumstance which makes mainly against himnamely, the purchase of the arsenic-was so publicly transacted as to inspire hesitation in the belief that he would use the poison so openly obtained for the murder of his own mother under the eyes of so many witnesses.
There may be something in the character of the fanatical Democrats of the Continent which extorts admiration, if not respect; but certainly nothing that we know of their British imitators leads us to believe that the language or conduct of the race will gain by translation into English diction or by application to English circumstances. Mr. SnTrrH O'BnnEN has been looked upon for many years as the least offensive of the Irish malcontents. Like the King Mm-ny VI. of the classic Pinitock', he has been " respectable rather for the vices he " wanted than for the virtues he possessed." He was of a good family in Munster, which claimed descent from BRxNro BoBtr, he was known to be of irritable temperament, he had no reason to practise agitation for his own advantage, and therefore might be presumed sincere; so, in spite of insolence, perversity, seditious speeches, incentives to rebellion, and participation in an actual rising, he has been allowed to keep something lik'e a fair character. It is a singular feature of our social system that a man who has committed the highest offence known to the law should stil not entirely lose caste among his fellows, merely because his obstinacy and malevolence and mischief were coupled with a kind of morbid sense of honour I which restrained him from the meannesses of some around him. Mr. Smurr O'UBRin returned from his banishment a few months ago with a pretty clear reputation. He had been abroad some eight years, and, if a true patriot, ought to have lono M since learnt to sigh for a return to his country. People, therefore, were disposed to believe that, being a sadder, he would prove a wiser man. He would doubtless return to Ireland forgetful of the kingdom of Munster, or even of the glories of a Celtic meeting, and would either retire completely into private life, or use whatever influence remained to him for the improvement of those in his immediate neighbourhood. What course the fallen agitator may intend to pursue we cannot say. Ireland is now content and peaceable; population has diminished and production has increased; the voice of sedition is hushed; the army is small, yet large enough for the g,arrison of a tranquil land ; the platform orators trade is gone. It would seem, certainly, that if even Mr. SMxT4 O'BRUN desires to return to political life, he would do well to recognize the great change which has taken place during his own residence in Ausbalia and Belgium. To an observer it appears that he has two careers before him-either to lead a private life and perform the duties of a country gentleman, or to wipe out the remembrances of his former follies by a few years of moderate behaviour, and then once more to enter the political arena. But if ever a man was intent on his own humiliation it was the late member for Limerick when he wrote the letter to Mr. O'FLAnETY, which appeared in our Irish inteligence yesterday. If this be the way in which men who have played a prominent part in Irish politics can bring themselves to write, then Ireland may well despair of regeneration from the exertions of her patriots. Mr. O'B s= was the leader in a movement which had the sympathy of a numerous, though misguided, band of Irishmen; he had a place in the history of his time, and his agitation, his insurrection, his capture and condemnation, are at least part of the later annals of the country. One would think that he would have sufficient sense of decency and dignity to avoid lowering the events in which he had a share. Yet, unable to avoid mingling in the petty conflicts of commonplace Irish life, the hero of Ballingarry now, after the lapse of nine years, dilates on the most miserable part of his adventures in 1848. The abstraction of certain letters from his portmanteau he feels, after all his exile and sufferings, to be a terrible grievance, and he goes so far as to accuse the General who received him after his_ capture of' a base piece of espionage, committed under influences to which he. affects' to 'allude in a covert manner. It appears that' Taifter- M. O'BRn was appreheided it Thukl6s he asked General M'DoxiALD's leave to send fdf a portmanteau which he had left at Cashel. When a prisoner haz been arrested for high treason a fevr days after having had a skirmish with the QuN&s forces, vwhen he is placed under the charge of a military offlicer, who has reason to believe that he has been corresponding, and is still correspondin&, with rebels about him, it seems but natural that any articles forwarded, to him should undergo inspeetioi,, The porteanteau of Mr. Ssrr (YBRns3f was examined as any box or bag of a suspected political offender would have been, and a sensible man would long ago have forgotten the circum. stance. - But this perverse and ill-conditioned gentleman forgets nothing, and probably imaginer a great deal. When he was captured the. General offered him a glass of champagne and other civilities, and Mr. O'BnixR asserts that he spoke in an incoherent manner. As his letter to Mr. O'FLAUERTY is directed against Sir. T. RED2flGTON, so it is insinuated that the latter gave way to a wanton and impudent curiosity in inspecting the contents of the portmanteau. Eow far the writer descends is ihown by the accusation that a set of studs was abstracted by the officials at the Castle. The whole letter is a proof of what maiserable materials the leaders of the Irish Rebellion were composed. Take the Democrats of France and Italy-wrongheaded, desperate, malignant as they are. Can any one believe that Mazzmi or one of his friends would remember whether in the crisis. of 1848 a paltry set of studs was forthcoming or all his shirts were right? Would the men who rose the' other day in Italy recollect years after with what air they were offered champagne; or, if they did recollect it, would they care to publish a sneer against. the tourteous officer who thus endeavoured to show them respect ? Snch stateraents, such insinnations, and such a tone as belong to Mr. O'Bnes letter are the best proofs of the hollowness of his cause and the feebleness and vanity of the men who supported it.

Tur BANsRw y SBlEPSTrw,s.-The three men, Thomas Simpson, William Bennett, and John Cope, who were captured on Friday morning last while in the act of stealing sheey at a place called Storr's-mill, near Barnsley, as reported In 2The Tmes of Monday, were brou_htIup for re-examination before Mr. T. Taylor, Wedt iding magistrate, at the Barnsley Court-house on Monday. From -the evidence of the two police-constables, Boothman and Robertshaw, who apprehended the prisoners, it appeas that two of the latter were engaged in securing a sheep each, while the third was stationedin a lane adjoining tho field to keep watch. This man's attention was attracted by the noise made by the policemen's dogs, and he immediately gave a signal, upon which the two men in the field retreated into the lane, The dogs were then let loose, and they were in the act of seizing the men when th shouted, "Call your dogs off, or they'll worry us." The constables went up to them and inquired what they were doing there at that time of night. Simpson replied, "' We have been resting ourselves; -we have been at Ludhill looking for work." He was asked where he came from. He answered, "I come from Shafton. and thoae other two come from Leeds, and are going to Wakefield. My name is John Walker, if thou wants to know and I have a wife and family at Shafton." The policemen said the priionerswere on the right road, and directed them to proceed, the eonstables folowing them closely until they arrived atBoothman's house, when Robertshaw vot in front of them, drewr his cutlas, ad ordered them to fgo into he house. Thne prisoners looked at each other astounded, butI the constables urged them in and locked the door. Varlous implements for comm itting robberies wvere found upon them, ad they were then handcuffed. They were fully committed for triaL. FIREs BRoB SrorN-TAEous IGNrrOIN.-At a quarter past 7 p.m., of the 25th Inst., a fire took place on the roof of a back warehouse connected with the extensive premises possessed by Messrs. Hearon and Co., wholesale druggists, No. 95, Bishopagate. The fire was observed by the neighbours5 who immediately sent for the firemen; on their amval the warehouse was found locked, and no one within. On obtaining access by the first floor windows they, after some trouble, found their way to the roof of the back warehouse, and while the firemen were leading their hose up to the point of danger the foreman (Mr. Fogo), who wasaireadyonthe roof, obtained a number of buckets of water from the people on the adjoining roofs and extlnguished the fire. On examining into the cause it was observed that the lead flat where the fire took placa was covered with a wooden grating, a great number of clear glass bottles filled with eastor oil [were placed on the parapet walls, and wooden stanids made for the purpose of holding them. It is believed that a quantity of sawdust and other matter had collected under the grating, sorme oil had been spilt and the heat of the sun had caused the whole to take fire. This Is by nol means a solitary case of the kmd, and those who deal in oiUs cannot be too careful in preventing their contact with sawdust, cotton waste, hemp, or any similar vegetable substaace, espbcally in such weather as we have at present. Tha fire was strong enough to fire the grating and stands, andmeltthelead of the roof, The floor belowr was saturated with oil aid water, and but for timely assistance the consequences might have been very serious, not only to Messrs. Hearon nd Co.'s premises but te the whole neighbourhood.

* REPORT OF TEm nilGATION CO3u"SSIOh-xRS.- A bluebook of 160 pages, published last week, contains the 17th general report of the Emigration Commissioners for the past year, 1856. The emigration during the last 42 years, from 1815 to 1856, amounted to 4,470,319 soials ; but of this large number more than 2,798,163 emigrated duribng the last dennium. The emIgration during 185 and 1856 reached only to 176,807 and 176,554 respectively. The largest emigration took place between 1847 and 18a4 both inclusive. The Irish famine in the former yea at once double& the largest emiigrationt of former years, and in 1852 the number of emigranr,i which had gone on increasing since 1857, attained its maximum, of 368,764 The number afterwards decreased, and in M855 and 1856 it fell to less than one iaoiety of what it had attained in 1852, and less than three-fifths of the average of the octetnial periocl ending with 1854. The cause of this decline are obvious. Itis the result partly of abundance of employment in ordinary pursuits, but mainly of the demand occasioned by the late war in all departments conuiected with the navy and the army. 'While, last year, the whole emigration was 52-55 per cent. of the whole emigration of 1851, the Iriah emigration of 1856 was but 28417 per cent, of the Irish- emigration of 1851, ancd the regular progress, as well as the rapidity of the decrease, shows that it must be owing to a permanent improvement.in the position of the people, and to no mere momentary or accidental cause. That the moral amelioration of the people of Ireland has been collateral with their increased materIal prosperity the records of the criminal returns, which -we noticed in Tlhe Time, a few days ago, afford irrefragable proof. It will be observed that the emigration of 1856 was almost exactl the same as in 1855, but in the distnbution of the emigrangs the difference is somewhat greater, there being anx increase to the United States of Ami-erica of 8,423, while to Australia there is a doerease of 7,725 and to British North America of 1,58. The great bulk of the emaigrants consisted of those classes of labourers and mechanics who would be nost likely to succeed in the countries which they have chosen as their future residence. The mortality in the emigration to NorthAmerica has been extraordinrily smalI -a circumstance partly to be attributed to the working ot the Passengers Ac of 1855. The emigration to Australia, as already stated, exhibits a decrease as compared with 1855. The number was 44,584, against 52,309 in 1855 and 83,237 In 1854 Of the 44,384 emlFants of last year 20,385 wore "assisteda and 24,199 unmssited. The mortality was low. Tbo emigrants were thus distributed-y&n, &ew South Wales, 5,394 males and 4,357 females; to Victoria, 14,632 males and 9,533 females; to South Australi, 2,70 males ana 1,801 females, to Western Australia (were emigrants are now much in demand) only 62 malesand 63 females; to Tasmania, 923 males and 888 females; and tc New Zealad, 2,270 males and 1,703 females. The Irihh emigrants, particularly those of the female sex, are, as ix wellknown, very much in disfavour in she Australi ncolo. nies, on account of their comparative immorality, inefficiency, and uncleanliness, and the commissioners explain that Ireland has sent out an undue proportion of late owing to the difficulty produced by the pate) warot obtaining emigrants in the sister kdngdoms of England and Scotland. There is still a deficiency of well-trained female domesiio servants among our emigrants, and great as is the demand for them in the colonies the commissioners have nohope of being able to supply it. respectable and competent femsal servants are too well off at home to be wlling to Incur the disruption of family ties and the risk of a tedious voyage to an unknown and in many respects disagreeable country like Australia, for the mere chance of the unmcertain prospects which emigration holds out to them. The disproportion between the sexes of enmgrants to Australia It is difficult to cope with, and the objection of the colonists to receive young women fromlrelad increa themdifficrty.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES-OFFYCE, Wednesday Mrning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 6 p.m.:- The Emperor left Plombieres this morning for Cb&lons-sur-Marne. He will to-morrow morning review the troops encamped there, and leave imme. diately after for Paris, where he is expected at halfpast 6 or 7 in the evening. A battalion of the Imperial Guard and a battalion of the line will receive him at the Strasburg railroad station, and the usual escort of cavalry will attend him to St. Cloud. The Emperor and Empress will embark on Wednesday, the 5th, at Havre for Osborne, where they will spend six or seven days. It is believed that this visit to Osborne will not be a mere ex change of compliments, but that during the Emperor's brief sojourn several weighty matters will be discussed between the two Sovereigns and their respective Ministers. Count Walewski will accompany the Emperor. Perhaps it is considered that the moment is come to place on a firmer footing tban ever the Anglo-French aliance. It may be doubted whether any temptation would be strong enough to estrange the Emperor from the alliance, but circumstances are too grave to permit even the appearance, I wiU not say of estrangement, but o doubt on that point. That Russian agency has been busy in India is the opinion of men who are not accustomed to be led away by mere suspicion, but who profess to have good reasons for forming their conclusions. They now call to mind the dark hints of approaching danger to " one of the Allies" expressed by Russian agents and spies in Paris towards the close of the Crimean campaign. These hints were not then very clearly understood by the few whose ears they reached, or they passed unheeded. It wonld be ciurious to ascertain whether the English Government has any just grounds for believing that the action of Russia has been busy in India, particularly during the interval between the fall of Sebastopol and the Persian war. The King of Wurtemberg is expected in Paris on Thursday, and, it is said, will spend a fortnight or three weeks at Biarritz during the sojourn of the Emperor and Empress in that place. It would appear that there is no documentariy evidence sufficient to implicate M. Ledru Rollin in the alleged Italian conspiracy for the assassination of the Emperor. It is affirmed, however, that the depositions of the witnesses-that is, of the persons arrested who have turned informers, are very strong. Such evidence, unsupported by any other, would be hardly sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused. With reference to Mazzini, it is said in official quarlers that there exists a series of correspondence establishing his relation -with the accused. The affair will come on next week at the Assize Court of the Seine, and the public wiU soon be able to judge what value ought to be set on the declarations of men placed in such circumstances as the prisoners are. This is the anniversary of the Revolution of July, 1830, and it seems to pass as much unnoticed by the press and the public generaly, so far as I can discover, as if it had never occurred. For the present the state of British India seems to be the paramount subject of conversation with every one, and the arrival of the next mail is here expected with an anxiety little short of that felt in London. M. Spirikofl, Director-General of Telegraphs in Rmusia, has arrived in Paris, charged with a mission relative to the organization of a telegraphic comnmunication between France and Russia. The Minister of Marine has, at the demand of the Governor of Senegal, despatched several ships of war to reinforce the French squadron' on that coast. Among them are the steam cutter Anacreon and the Bourasque, a gunboat of the first-class. The Journal dut Haine says:- " If we are well informed, the Chamber of Commerce has received an official intimation of the resolutions of the French Government relative to the question of the Transatlantic packets. The New York line is to be accorded to llavre, with a subvention of 3,000,000f.; the Antilles line to Nantes, with 6,00o,000f.; and the Brazils line to Bordeaux and Marseilles, with 5,000,000f. Each port is requested to present a company prepared to undertake the Iine assigned so it." The following private telegraphic despatch has been received:- " MARSEILLES, JULY 28. " The mail from India has not yet been signalled. " The English steamer Vigilant is lying here, waiting the orders of Admiral Lyons, and of Admiral Cochrane, vho is to replace him.

The lull in Italian politics that has succeeded the late attempt to create a storm is for the present, at least, most profound. Turin, which for many reas on s may be considered the c entre of the Italian political world, is now suffering that annual drought of national news that we are accustomed to see develope d at this time of year by the total absence of all subjects of local interest in the publie press. Parliament is up, and legislators, Ministers, and diplomatists are, for the most part, away on their private affairs, or seeking health and coolness at some of the numerous watering-plac of Piedmont, where people are wont to go from hence in search of the salubrious under no ordinary difficulties. The truth is, the heat at this time of year in Turin is positively stiffing, so that no one who is not absolutely obliged would ever think of remaining here during the present and following month, and therefore it in that many hydropathic establishments, in various valleys of the Alp3, with or without the attraction of mineral waters -whose history is probably not yet writ in the books of Murray or Bradshaw, and thus, of course, still remain unknown to the orthodoxBritish tourist-have sprung into fame with the increased facilities of locomotion offered by the railway system; and to them crowds now resort from aU the cities of the kingdom, for the very laudable object of amusing andc washing themselves, regardless of the want of all such reasonable accommodation as our countrymen and country women generally consider indispensable to comfort in all circumstances. Bat Piedmontese ideas are less fastidious on these matters, and consequently the citizens of Turin and other towns are happily able to enjoy the cool mountain breezes and the bracing effects of the mountain torrents, with as little gefle as a Loadoner might experience at Brighton or Hastings, and foreigners whose lot is cast here are fain to imitate their philosophy as best they may. The Parliamentary session having been closed, it wiU probably not be very long before a Royal decree appears dissolving the Representative Chamber and ordering a new election; for, although the present Chamber has not yet completed the full term of its legitimate existence-that is to say, has not sat for five sessions-still, as it has voted five budgets, it may be considered to have accomplished the financial duties of the country for five whole years, and it has long been evident that a fresh choice of representatives would be agreeable to the electors in general. The expiring Chamber of Deputies, however, is one which has deserved well of the country, and will probably enjoy an undying reputation with posterity. To enumerate the various acts passed by it would occupy too much of your space without interesting the English reader. It will suffice to say that it has in its time sanctioned some of the greatest of those reforms through which this country has passed during the last 10 years. It has sanctioned a fresh valuation of the country for the purposes of adjusting taxation; it has abolished the corn duties; it has reformed the civil and penal codes, and the prison regulations; it has suppressed certain religious communities, and the privileged places in certain professions ; it has abolished the usury laws; it has sanctioned the transfer of the Royal Navy and Arsenal from Genoa to Spezzia, and made it law that every man fit to bear arms shall be available for the service of the State if required; it has liberally voted concessions for the many railway schemes presented, ending with the gigantic project of piercing the Alps under the Mont Cenis; and it cordially approved of the Anglo-French Alliance, and that policy which prompted an active part in the late great struggle, and which finally ended by giving this country a place in the Supreme Council of European nations. The majority which carried these important measures was the offspring of that connutbio or junction of parties, under the leaderships of Count Cavour and Signor Rattazzi, effected during a former Parliament. The fusion of the Right and Left centres of the House gave theCavour Ministry such a decided majority in the Representative Chamber as has enabled it to defy all the attacks of the extreme parties on every occasion, though often exposed to the muenaces of the most unnatural coalitions, organized solely for the purpose of ousting the Ministry if possible, and without any regard to who might succeed it, and this has been the mainspring of the late cry which has been raised against the Minister of the Interior, on the plea of his want of foresight in the Genoa affair the other day. You will see from the fact of what this union has accomplished how improbable it is that Count Cavour would consent willingly to its dissolution, or that the representatives of really friendly Powers would take any steps calculated to force it on him. Those who call out for the removal of Signor Rattazzi have for aim the subsequent overthrow of Count C&vOur, and with him the reversion, as they hope, of his whole course of policy, foreign and domestic. Under a Ministry of the Right, forced on the King, the clerical and retrograde party Hatter themselves they would soon undo all the reforms of Count Cavour, though still preserving the outward form of the Constitution, and they are to this end supported by the solemn protestations of foreign Ministers of despotic Sovereigns against the organization of the Piedmontese police and the administration of the Minister of the Interior. It is in this state of affairs that Government is now about to appeal to the sense of the country, and no one conversant with the state of public opinion appears to doubt the result being a confirmation of that confidence in Ministers so often expressed through its representatives of late years. His Holiness the Pope is still at Bologna, having returned there from his short visits to Modena and Ferrara, but is expected to leave soon for Florence and Pisa, although the day of his departure is not yet decided on. There is no longer any hope entertained of Pius IX. granting reforms for the Legations or attending to the suggestions of his subjects there, as expressed in the addresses of Bologna, Ravonna, Ferrara, &c. The plot of M. Mazzini came most apropos to save him from the embarrassment in which he might possibly have been placed between his own convictions of right and wrong, and his inability to act. I have heard, indeed, on what may be considered excellent authority, that had it not been for the recent outbreaks in Italy the French Government would have urged on His Holiness the necessity of reforming the administration in those provinces, but that, of course, for the present, it refrains from pressing the subject. Not vainly, therefore, does the Austrian Gazette assert that the performance of M. Mazzhii at Genoa has been of the greatest service to the cause of despotism, although the revolutionary party has not quite succeeded in shaking the foundations of the constitutional throne of this country, as the Gazette in question anticipated it would do. The following proclamation was posted in the streets of Leghorn on the 18th inst., by order of the Governor:- " His Excellency Luigi Bargag]i, Governor of the city, reminds the well-disposed population, in order that they may may not be led into error by the insinuations of evil. minded individuals, that the laws in force prohibit all de. scription of popular manifestation whatsoever in the streets, or in any other publio place, tending to express wishes or demands, and that any persons offending against the law shall be severely punished, conformably 'with the 206th Article of the Penal Code." THE STATE OF1 NAPLES. (iFROM OUR ONVN CORESPOWDNTr.) NAPLES, JULY 23. The foreign press, while expressing its full sympathy with the Italians as an oppressed people, neverthelesshasblamed themfor the recent and other abortive attempts. I do not think that a sufficiently broad line of diatinction has been drawn between -the "Italians' as a nation and a few headstrong desperadoes who, having nothing to lose and every. thing to gain by commotion, are willing to cast not only their own but the interests of millions on the torn of the die. That the Italians, as a nation, were hostile to the late attempt has been sufficiently proved by facts; they kept aloof. You cannot meet with a sober Neapolitan who does not condemn it as treason against liberty, and, if any further evidence of their feelings were wanted, it would be found in the declaration which I sent you some days since. Indeed, a long and varied experieace among the people of the South has shown to me, if I may pay our country the compliment, that they are becoming not merely more Anglicized in their attachments, but more Anglicized in their mode of thinking. Conspirators they must always be so long as they are oppressed, but the worst forms of I old Italian conspiracy they abjure. Placing fuU faith in the force of public opinion, they are much more intent on enlightening and sharpening the inteUect than in polishing the dagger, and are equal!y intent on discovering- and exposing the mistakes of their rulers and on avoiding the commission of any on their own part. This, it appears to me, is but a just tribute to the great body of Neapolitans, who have lost some portion of publie sympathy perhap i in consequence of an error, which must be attributed to a few only. FoUowing up these remarks by a description of parties, it wil of course be inferred that the great national party is the Constitutional party. They have not mingled in recent events, either by act or sympathy; indeed it is difficult to describe the intensity of their indignation against the mad marploti who have been scattering firebrands through the country; but in proportion to their moderation is their resolution, and I believe that there is no body of men whom the Government holds so much in suspicion and hatred as it does these men. The Government is right, for the influence of these men is the irresistible influence of reason. The next party in point of strength is that of the Muratists. It has been strong and on the increase in the Calabrias. It has little or no forqe in the capital, though agents have been here, and have bestowed much activity in the distribution of money, placards, and promises. Still, by the body of the nation, Muratism is regarded only as the resource of desperation, and by different sections of opinion the following objec tions are urged against it:-" It is a party without a head; the man whose name it bears will risk nothing, but wiU condescend, in case of success, to enjoy the fruits of the labour of others. And in this case the Neapolitans had rather struggle an I win Success for themselves. Again, in the event of success, what do they gain? A French Prince tributary to France; instead of which they are resolved on independence, and aa Italian Sovereign. Among more violent men, as Mazziniani for instance, the anti-Muratist feeling has been so strong that they would have taken up arms to oppose Murat. Thus this party, with a name only, may be considered to have no real pied d terre in the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. As to the Mazziniani, two words wiU dispose of them. They might always have been counted, and in proportion to their insignificant number, was their violence. The scanty elements of that party are now scattered, and to no persons is this a greater relief than to the Neapolitan Liberals themselves, who have always dreaded them as their worst enemies. Differing as these three parties do among themselves, there is one point on which they are united heart and soul, and that is in abhorrence of the actual Government-they will never cease to conspire against it, and,in spite of continual failures disturbances and rumours of disturbances will ever form a principal feature in the history of thisunhappy country. As to the Royalists, I have made no count of them. They are l*eried servants, whose attach ment is to their pay, and who are ready to change their livery any or every morning. Nothing is yet decided about the Cagliari, and, indeed, Naples is singularly devoid of news. His Majesty is at Castelamare. The Count of Syracuse is passing his qiUleggiatura at his delightful vila in Sorrento. By the by, the peace of this little place was disturbed last week by five or six men being brought in under arrest and placed in prison. The singular history is as fol lows:-The French steamer the Meteor is here taking a trigonometrical survey of the Bay. Wish ing to make some observations from inland, permission was asked of the Intendente, and a request urged that the local authorities might be advised of it. So off they set, an officer and a body of men, for one of the line of mountains caUed Vico Alvano, at the back of Meton. They had no sooner begun to fix their poles than they were assailed by the tenants of Prince Colonna Pagliario, and ordered to lie on the ground-an order which was enforced by guns being presented at them. The Frenchmen remonstrated, but they were accused of raising the tree of liberty. One man had his head broken, another his arm seriously injured by a fall in his flight. After some time the Frenchmen managed to get away, and presented their complaint to the judge of Sorrento, and the loyal Neapolitans were immediately arrested. The report was presented by the judge in person to his superior, the Superintendent at Castelamare, and the Kiing, on hearing of it, was greatly displeased, and ordered the facts to be thoroughly sifted. The Centaur, Captaiu Clifford, returned toNaple3 from Messina yesterday. Exchange on London, 547. AMERICA. (BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPPH.) LIVERPOOL, WEDiTESDAY MONeING. The United States mail steamer Columbia has arrived, with advices from New York to the 18th inst., and $100,000 specie on freight. The Royal mail steamer America, hence, arrived at Boston on the 17th inst. The Waihington correspondent of the NeAw Yor7k Herald, under date of July 15, writes- ' Advices have been received here from Costa Rica, vsi4 Panaama, which state that President Mora had declared the grant of the Nicaragua transit route, conceded by that R- public and Nicaragua jointly to Mr. Webster, to have lapsed from a non-compliance with its conditions by the grantee. The lapse was occasioned by the non-payment of the stipalated half milUion dollars on or before the 1st day of June. It has been determined that as soon as the new Government of Nicaragua should be consolidated the two Re. publics will send Commissioners to the country to negotiate a sale of the grant, and the immediate opening of icteroceanic communication by it." A telegraphic despatch had been received at Washington by the President, dated Leavenworth, July 16, from Governor Walker, stating that a serious insurrection had broken out at Lawrence, and that he had called out the United States troops to suppress it. The Governor had issued a proclamation, declaring his intention to put down all opposition to the territorial laws by force. At Quebee the coroner's jury had returned a verdict of manslauglhter againstthe owner, Captain, pilot, and mate of the steamer Montreal.| Trade at New York was dull; the money market was in a gool position, with a moderato demand at 8 to 9 and 10 per cent. for prime 60 days, anLd 7 per cent. on call. The stock market had taken a turn in favour of buyers, but there was a feeling of confidence in higher prices in the future. In exchange little was done for the Columbia, and rates were unchanged. In cotton a further advance of i to i cent had taken place. Flour had also advanced 10 to 15 cents. Freights were without change. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCR, (FROM OUR OWt CORRESPONDMUN .)

The line has been completed for some time, and has been used for the conveyance of coal over a considerable portion of it, but until Monday its use was confined to the contractor. It runs through an entirely agricultural district. It is a narrow gauge single line of easy gradients, and runs out of the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway near to Leominster, passing vid Pombridge to Kington. It has already reduced the price of coal in the district. The opening was celebrated with great rejoicing and festivity. A special train conveying tho directors and their friends left Leominster in the morning for Kington, where there was a public d6jefincr, after which the party returned to Leominster, and at 5 o'clock Lord Bateman, chairman of the company, was to preside at a dinner at the Royal Oak Hotel.

MONEY-AMARKETanWITYINTBLLIGBNo. Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 4 par mule premium, and the short exchange on London is 25.20 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. 10id. per ounce for standard gold it appears that gold is about 3-lOths per cent. dearer in Paris than in tondon. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 422 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13.4k per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 2-lOths per cent. dearer in London than in Hamburg. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 109k per cent., which, when compared with the Mint proportions between the two countries, shows that the exchange is about at par; and, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves scarcely any profit on the importation of gold from the United States. The funds, which opened to-day at a decline of an eighth from the closing prices of last evening, manifested much steadiness until between 12 and 1 o'clock, when a succession of heavy sales caused great excitement, and rumours of al kinds were current, Consolsmeanwhile experiencinga falof five - eighths per cent. Of course, the general supposition was that the speculators were acting upon Indian intelligence; but for a short time a report was actively circulated that a new attempt had been made on the life of the Emperor Napoleon. WVhen the telegraphic quotations from the Paris Bourse had shown this to be totally unfounded attention was concentrated entirely on tho possibilityof the arrival of the overland mail having become privately known, although up to the close of business nothing had reached the India-house. The statement was that a message had been received vid Turin to the effect that Delhi had not been taken, that the cholera was committing great havoc among the insurgents as well as among the British troops outside of the town, that the latter were short of ammunition, and, finally, that it had been found necessary to disarm the native regiments remaining in Calcuttae Even assuming, however, aU this to be true, it is difficult to see why it shouild cause a panic in Consols. The greatest anxiety hitherto has been lest the mutiny should spread to the Bombay and Madras armies, and in that respect there does not appear to have been an unfavourable word. It may therefore be concluded that other causes must have been in operation to produce tho severe decline, and, among these, it has been suggested that Mr. Giustiniani, who failed yesterday for 300,0001., may have had a large speculative account open in favour of a rise, and that this has been suddenly closed. The fact, also, of a considerable increase in the demand for money having been observable, both in the Stock-Exchange and in the discountmarket, as well as at the Bank, must have contri buted to the prevailing distrust, while the steady withdrawals of bullion which now daily take place doubtless operated in the same direction. The first transactions in Consols were at 91g to i for money, whence they receded to 901 to 9L From this there was little recovery, and the last official quotations were 90o to 91 for money, and 91. to i for the account. After regular hours there was a renewed faU of an eighth. Loans on Government securities were in request at 51 per cent., and the amounts offering were small. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 216; Reduced, 91 ] to J; New Three per Cents., 91i to i; India Stock, 214 to 217; India Bonds, 25s. to 16s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 7s. to 3s. discount. The market for foreign securities continues dull, the principal transactions being confined to Turkish, which closed at a further decline. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed there was no alteration. BrazL lian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 1011; ditto, Four-and-a-Eialf per Cents., 1852, 954; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 81i; Portuguese, 44 ; Russian Five per Cents., lllj;1 Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 941, 94, and 93k; the Four per Cents. Guarantee, 102k and i ; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents. 64; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 9&8. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates were generally the same as last post. The final price of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 66f. 60c. for both money and account, showing a decline of not quite an eighth. A further sumn of 45,0001. in gold bars was withdrawn from the Bank to-day to pay for silver purchases on the continent. The total taken since Thursday last has been about 200,0001. At the Court of Baiikrnptcy to-day a third-class certificate was granted to J. A. Pervanoglu, Greek merchant, and one of the first-class to G. C. Franghiadi, Greek merchant. The certificate of Octave Foa, merchant, was opposed chiefly on the ground of his having obtained double advance upon cargoes, and an adjournment was ordered. The statement just made by Lord Brougham on the existing defects of the bankruptcy courts will, perhaps, stimulmte the Government during the approaching recess to prepare a scheme of amendment. But,although the improvements urged were far from extensive, the tone of the Lord Cbancellor afforded little hope that they are likely to be vigorously taken up. The great evil of the present condition of the question is the damage it inflicts upon public morality. Everything that deters creditors from bringing the conduct of failed firms before an impartial tribunal operates as an encouragement to the fraudulent trader. Where affairs are wound up under private inspection the representations of the debtor are always more or less taken for granted, and while the honest man abstains from turning this fact to his own advantage it proves to the unscrupulous an irresistible temptation. Both, however, occupy afterwards the same position in society. Indeed, if there is any difference, it is against the honest man, since he frankly admits all his mistakes, while the more practised operator resorts to every kind of concealment and sophistry, and usually ends by extracting a general expression of " sympathy" from his deluded supporter. The records of the past few years indicate the field that is open to every bold adventurer. He may go on with a lavish personal expenditure, and wind up with liabilities for 100,0001.-they must never be less than 50,0001. if he desires to be respected-and at the end, although he may be unable to show assets for more than a quarter of that amount, or to give a single satisfactory reason in the shape of unforeseen calamity to account for the disappearance of the remainder, he can rely that few questions will be asked, and that the whole matterwillbe smoothlv adjusted. t;hould any dissatisfied sufferer manifest a disposition to severity, it is only necessary that some friend of the insolvent, after enlaTging upon the readiness shown by that gentleman to facilitate the liquidation,-he having actually offered to con. tinue his best services in the cause for three months, or even longer, on a proper allowance being made to him,-should threaten every obstructive with the fact that if any want of unanimity is shown the case must be carried into bankruptcy, where, in- stead of 4s. or 5s. in the pound, which might now be realized, there will, at the best, be a prospect of half-a-crown. From that moment all opposition is over. The creditors sign a deed of arrangement, vrite off their losses, wait patiently for the small pittance pronmised, and never make another inquiry. That such results should be witnessed when, as Lord Broughain observed, speaking from the experience of the past three years, out of 120 bankruptcies, with assets amounting in the aggre- gate to 90,0001., the creditors got only 44,0001,, the whole of the balance having been swal. lowed up by expenses, can hardly create surprise. Even under the best system the inducements on the part of creditors to shun a publh court are very strong, Eince those who have made large lose ae never anxious to parade them, but with the cextainty that the pecuniary results would be wose, even although sonie reserved assets mi3h t often be extracted w hich under a pri- Nate liquidation would never he heard of, there can be no doubt as to which will be preferred.

STAT' OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, Jtrx 28. The yarn-marl-et continues in the same healthy state as last week. There are no stocks, and spinners are manv of them under contract, so that prices move symrpathotically with the rise in the cotton-market, and buyers have no alternative buit to concede the advar,ces demanded. Quotations are generally about 81d. per lb. higher upon mnule, and td. to id. upon water-twist, than lastw eek. 'lliereis still a fair business for Germany, and the homhe trade are free buyers both of cops and warps. All numbers froinn S's to 24's are in fair request for the Mediterranean, at fully Jd. per lb. advance, but in yarns suitable for India there is nothiag doing. In cloth there is now a demand for ahrost every description; of fabric, except those sritable to India, and longeloths, T-clotbs, and soine kinds of printers are rather dearer. Light miuslins suitable to the GlaCgow trade are in fair request. India shirtiDgs, nmadapollatms, and jaconots remain urnsaleable, and will probably remain so until more encouraging advices fronm India aro in hand. There is great anxiety about the news by the overlan.d nail, now expected, not only on aecount of the great amount of comnnmercial property in India jeopardized by the revolt of the native troops, but in conseguence of the many personal connexions of firms here whose lives may have been sacrificed.

ELECTION INTELLIGBNCB. CITY OF LONDON. Baron do Rothschild having vacated his seat as one of the members for the city of London, in consequence of the rejection of the Parliamentary Oaths Bill by the House of Lords, the nomination of a candidate to supply the vacancy thereby occasioned took place yesterday at the GuildhalU It being well understood that the citizens of London were determined to exercise their franchise free from all dictation or control in the choice of their representative, and that they were determined again, for the fifth time, to elect Baron de Rothschild as a fit and proper person to represent them in Parliament, no opposition was for a moment contemplated to the re-election of that gentleman. At 12 o'clock lessrs. Mechi and Keats, the sheriffsof London, appeared on the hustings, and were immediately followed by the Baron de Rothschild and his friends. As soon asthe Baron was seen he was received by lond and protracted eheering by a large body of electors assembled in the hall. Besides his proposer and seconider, Mfr. M. T. Smith, M.P., and Mr. Alderman Wire, there w.re present Mr. Crawford, M.P., Mr. Brady, MYP., Aldermen Salomons, Sir G. Carroll, Humphery, and Rose; Messrs. Jeremiah Pilcher, Mr. J. Hall, W. Hawes, James UnIderwood, J. D. Gannel, &e. The preliminary proceedings having been gone through, Mr. Sheriff MECHI said that, in pursuance of Her Majesty's writ, which had just been read, it was his duty to hear the names of the candidates to be proposed to them for their choice; and he had no doubt, as free-born Englishmen, they would give a fair and patient hearing to every man who might address them, whatever their opinions might be. (Cheers.) Mr. MI. T. SaITH, MP., then came forward to propose Baron Lionel de Rothschild. (Loud cheerg.) Be said it was only within the last half hour that he received an intimation that it was the wish of Baron de Rothschild and of the Liberal party by whom he was sulporttd that he should propose that gentleman to them as their future representative. (Cheers.) He was about going abroad at that very time, but he determined not to lose the high honour and great gratification of performing the duty which had beea allotted to him. (Cheers.) He addressed them in the confident belief that he was doing his duty as a member of Parliament in vindicating the rights and privileges of the House of Commons, which, by an immense majority of 140 of its members, had declared that no jest, no honourable man should be prevented from taking hi- place in the Legislature of this country, whatever might be his religion. (Cheers.) This question was, in fact, settled as early as the year 1829, when the Legislature, after many years of contention, aftervarious changes of Government, and duringa period when the country was witnessing the mnst important events and was engaged in a perilous war, resolved that the Roman Catholies should not be excluded front Parliamuent on account o their religion. (Cheezs.) By that resolution it was declared that no man had a right to inquire what were the religious feelings and opinions of any person who should be returned to Parliament. It was an impertinent question to ask of any man what his religious opinions were. That was an affair altogether between the individual and his God. (Cheers.) Hie begged to propose, which he did with the highest satisfaction, that Baron de Rothschild be elected as a fit and proper person to represent the city of London in Parliament. (Cheers.) Mr. Alderman WIRE, in seconding the nomination, observed that he was about to say that it afforded him great pleasure in standing before them on the present occasion, hut he recalled the words, for it was with deep regret that he had to address them on account of the proceedings of the House of Lords. (Groans and cheers.) Four times had they returned Baron de Rothschild as tbeir member; four times had the House of Commons been engaged in discussing the propriety of enacting a law to enable that gentleman to take his seat; and four times had the House of Lords stood in successfild opposition to the repeated demands of the citizens of London, of the votes of the House of Commons, and of the wishes of the Executive Government of the day. It would he for that meeting, by the return they should then make, unanimously, triumphantly, constitutionally to vindicate the rights of the electoral body of this kingdom, and to say to the House of Lords that they must no longer trifle with the privileges of the people. (Loud cheers.) It was their undoubted right to eleet any person whom they might think proper to send to the House of Commons. Looking at the law, as rightly interpreted, he maintained that it was never intended to exclude the Jews: and it was an usurpation of authority over the rights of the people to reject the man whom they had so repeatedly chosen. They were called upon by the Queen'swritto elect a fit and proper person tobetheir representative in Parliament, and he confidently asserted that Baron do Rothschild was in all respects that flt and proper person. (Cheers.) Was be a fib person, was he a |discreet person ? Look at his mercantile charactcr; he was at the head of the largest mercantile and monetary agency throughout the world. His name bore with it a repntation for Englishi honour and integrity to every port where a ship found entrance and to every country where commerce was carried on. (Cheers.) Looking at his private oharacteor, which they had a right to do, he might safely compare it with that of the brightest, the best, and the purest of the House of Lords. As a father he was beloved, as a husband he was adored, and as a friend he was one of the kindest and one of the most largehearted men whom it was any one's happiness ever to know, and who did honour to the virtuous circle in which he moved. (Loud cheering.) He therefore mnaintained that in electing such a man they did indeed elect a fit and proper person to represent them in Parliament. (Cheers,) 1D the House of Comnons the people required men of large Snancial knowledge-men who understood how taxes ought to be impobed, collected, and expended, and who were capable of giving the Government the benefit of a wide experience such as had enabled Baron Rothschild and his family to be at the head of the commercial interests of this country. (Cheers.) What reason did the House of Lords assign for rejecting such a man ? If it resolved itself into a question of constitutional law, did it not constitutionally rest with the people, and not with the Lords ? They were not about to send a man to the Rouse of Lords. though he hoped to see the day when the Jew would be a momber even of that august assembly. (Cheers.) ht their present ditty was to return a member to the Commons'Eouse, and with that the Lords had nothing whatever to do. It was a constitutional maxim that a peer should not interfere with the election of a member of the House of Commons, though it was well known that they sometimes have driven their tenants like slaves to the hustings to vote for the men whom they wished to be chosen. It was but recently that the Lords resisted the Queen's nrerogativo in asserting what they believed to be their privilege. Her Mlajesty, baving selected a man of profound legal learning, whose character would add dignity to any a-embly, to be a peer for life, the Lords objected, and said that theirprivileges were above the prerogative of the Crown, that they alone were the judgesas to who should be members of their House, and that they would nothave alife peeramong them. Sothat,without the condition that thetitle should go to the descendants of the newly created peer, although they might he born fools and idiots, it was their determination that no man should sit in their assembly. (Cheers and laughter.) Another reason assigned for rejectine the Jews was that it would unebristianize Parliannent. Would that the two Houses were Christianized! If they were there would be no contest between classes as to admitting into any assembly men illustrious for their virtbes and talentwhether Jews or Christians. It was proposed, should the Lords reject Lord John Russell's Bill, to seat Baron Rotbschild by a resolution of the House of Conimons in virtue of their own inherent privileges,-a course which they ouight at first to have pursued. But then they were told it would be illegal to do so. It was not illegal for the House of Lords to reject Lord Wensleydale. Why, then, should it be illcgal on the part of the House of Commons to follow that example ? It would be for the cit;zens of London to say, after bayinjelecteaBaronRotbsebild fiveimes,whetbertheywould sit quietly by and suffer the House of Lords to dictate to them, to the electors of the country, and to the House of Commons who should be elected and take their seats in the Commnons' House. He hoped that should Lord John Russell fail to get his Bill passed during the present session the House of Commons would take the matter into their own hands and accede to Mr. Dillwyn's proposition to seat Baron Rothschild by a resolution of the Houise. (Cheers.) There were always prophets of evil who could never see thin"s through the right medium. There were distinguiished men in the Lords who said it would be illegal to proceed by resolution, and that it would be bringing the House of Commons into collision with the courts of law. But, had the people any fear of the courts of law ? (Cheers.) Tho courts of law had before now been compelled to succumb to a resolution of the House of Commons. Oh'er) He would like to see the man who would bebold enough as a judge, after he had read the resolution of the House of Commons, if any per. son should bring an action against Baron lRothschild for sitti=g and voting in that House, to direct the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff. He did not believe that anv judge, though he might be old and well read in the constitutional law of the country, would venture to give sush a direction. (Cheers.) But it was asked -whethev they would go beyond the democratic constitutioi of the 'United States, where the Senate had power from time to time to reject any Bill offered to them; but gentlemen who urged this argument forgot that there was a wise provision in the constitution of the United Stateswhich declared that if the Senate rejected a Bill three tines, and it should be passed a fourth time by the House of Representatives, it sbould become law in spite of any resolution of the Senate. The House of Commons had passed a Bill four times, and the Lords had rejected it four times. Would they reject it a fifth time ? Hie feared they would be persistent in error and intolerance. What, then was to be done -with the House of Lords ? (Cheers.) Would the people destroy it ? (Loud cries of " No, no !") No! they all respected the House of Lords in the exercise of their legitimate and proper frnctions. They looked to the Lords in times of danger for security. At the same time they must not purchase that security too dearly. They must not let the House of Lords interfere with the rights and privileges of the electors of this country, or the result would be that the House of Commons itself would be riothing, the electors would be nothing, the Government of the country would be nothing, and the Lords would dictate and rule, and, instead of a limited monarchy, an oligarchy would be established-the most hateful species of government that ever existed. (Cheers.) He was told he ought not to abusethe House of Lords. God forbidhe should ! But he wished to tell them that they were wrong. Many peers and bishops voted for the Parliamentary Oaths Bill. AU honour to the men who in that bigoted assembly stood out as landmarks of liberty to vote against this last remaining rag of intolerance I (Cheers.) Mr. MxECI then asked whether any elector had any other candidate to propose. No peragn coming forwaxd the SREitx called for a show of bands, when every hand in the haU was held up in favour of Baron Rothschild. Mr. Sheriff MECaI then declared that Baron Lionel de Rothschild had been duly elected to serve in the present Parliament as one of the members for the city of London. The announcement was received with loud applause. Baron ROTHSCeHLD then presented himself to the meet. ing, and was received with vociferous cheering. He said,Gentlemen, I do not know how to express my feelings of gratitude on this occasion. I cannot find words to thank you for the confidence which you have again reposed in me, It was on this very day, the 28th of July, 10 years ago, that I first had the honour of addressing you and of making my first appearance in public life. Since then, my position-I may almost say our position-is wonderfuUy changed. At my first election I met with a great and even powerful opposition. My return was then regarded as a very great victory; but how much greater must we regard my triumph of this day, when you have re-elected me unanimously ? (Cheers, and a faint cry of " No.") Well, the gentleman who says "No" may be right. There may be one or two persons in the crowd who do not agree in your decision. But can I not say with pride that I have been triumphantly, if not unanimously returned, when no opponent has been found to contest the seat with me? (Cheers.) I conclude, therefore, thatnone of the citizens of London entertain any strong hostility towards the cause which we are now advocating. (Hear, hear.) Gentlemen, what has been the great argument urgedagainst our measure by the leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords? Why, that the country has not declared itself properly on this question. But I askyou, is there any city or town intho kingdom where any member of the Jewish persuasion lives that has not responded to our appealin the same enlightened manner as the citizens of London have done ? (Hear.) There are many distri-ts of the country,-for example, the rural villages, and the large estates of the nobility, where there are no Jews to be found, and certainly where there are no Jews their claims can hardly be expected to be much discussed or pressed upon the Legislature. This is not, like the repeal of the corn laws, a question which concerns everybody; it only interests those places in which Jews reside; and I repeat that those places have come forward to echo the sentiments of the citizens of London. May I not, therefore, say that since I first had the honour of appearing before you our cause has gained greatly, seeing that, whereas we then encountered a strong and violent opposition, now we have none whatever to contend against ? (Cheers.) I congratulate myself on the fact that this question has not only been advancing in public favour, but is now being viewed as one which affects the rights, not of the Jews alone, but of the constituencies of the kingdom, and even of the House of Commons itself. (Cheers.) The representatives of the people, I rejoice to find, are taking the ruestion up as their own. (Hear, hear.) And what does Lord Derby recommend us to do? He recommends us to agitate; he says, "We have seen no riots, no disturbances such as we saw on the carrying of other great measures." But in this country good sense has always prevailed; and I am sure that, without the necessity of agitation, without the necessity of resorting to the same means to gain our end as were adopted on similar occasions, the good sense of the House of Lords will at last induce them to yield. (Hear, hear.) But if the leader of the Opposition continues the same strain-if he insists on having agitation -I dare say we shall have many opportunities of satisfying him. (" Hear," and a laugh.) If he is determined that this question shall not be settled vithout a controversy out of doors, I for my own Dart am quite prepared to meet him. (Cheers.) I anm quite prepard to maintainthat when a measure is backed not only by so large and so important a constituency as the first city of the empire, but by a majority of 140 members of the House of Commons, a narrow majority of 32 in the House of Lords cannot permanently resist it. (Hear, hear.) Many questions are likely to be brought forward during the approaching recess, some of them, perhaps, affecting the House of Lordsthemselves. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Yoa know that we are to have a new Reform BiLl, and if this decreasing majority of peers obstinately nersist in holding out we shaU have many opportunities of encountering the noble lord who heads them on his own ground. (Cheers.) You are aware, gentlemen, that a Bill on this subject, introduced by your representative, Lord J. Russell, stands for a second reading in the House of Commons to-morrow. Now, last night in the House of Lords a day was fixed, after which their lordships wiU receive no new Bil that maybesentuptothem; we mustthereforeencourage that noble lord to hasten in every possible way the passing of his BilL Should his zneasure, however, be unfortunately defeated, we have every reason to expect from what the noble lord has stated in the House of Commons that he wiU use all the other means in his power to obtain our object. (Cheers.) We all know that in the House of Commnons there is no man better acquainted than that noble lord with the constitutional mode of carrying any measure; and we also know that anything proposed by him in that sense would be sure of success. (Hear, hear.) Well, Lord J. Russell leads us to hope that in the event of his Bill being thrown out, he will endeavour in some other way to effeot our object. Gentlemen, I fully believe that he will. (Cheers.) Every argument in favour of our measure is already familiar to you. You are perfectly cognizant of aU that has passed. It would be idle, therefore, for me now to refer to Mr. Dillwyn's motion, or to comment on the manner in which the House of Lords have behaved. Neither need I repeat that I attach little weight to many of the assertions made against the Governnent in regard to their not having done aU that they might have done to carry this question. I will only add that as long as I enjoy your kind support I shal be only too proud to havo my name associated with this great constituency. (Hear, hear.) I aain thank you heartily for this renewed mark of your confidence, and I sincerely hope that when our Bil passes into law the manner in which I shall be found to discharge my duties as your representative wiLl justify the trust that you have reposed in me. (Loud cheers.) ,Mr.F3. BENOC}IX rose to move the foiowing resolution- mZ.: "T.at the best thanks of the citizens of London are eminently due and are berebyrespectfully tendered to their representatives, Lord J. Rnsell, Sir J. Duke, t. W. Crawford, Eaq., to those enlightened and independent membersgof the House of Commons, and also to that patrteic minority of spiriMal and lay Peers in the House of Lords who by their votes on the Parliamentary Oatbs Bill asserted the freedom of election, maintained the privileges of the House of Commons, and vindicated the griat cause of religious liberty." This resolution was intended to fortify the Liberal members of the House of Commons in the position they had taken up, and to stimulate them to still greater exertion. Those gentlemen had only to resolve, and this question was carried. Their supporters in the House of Lords also deserved their gratitude. The members of that House ought to know that they would be narrowly watched. The independence of the Upper House, no doubt, should be upheld; but that assembly ought to be warned that, if they still refused to concede the just rights of the constituency, some leEs welcome mode than any yet proposed would in aU human probability be ado,pted to enforce them. (Cheers). Mr. Sheriff M1EHiI intimated tlat the resolution did not come within the strict business of the day, and was not therefore his affair. (A. laugh.) A sheriff had no right to have any political feeling. (Avoice.-" We will excuse you, and laughter.) Mr. W. J. H.ALL seconded the resolution, which, he thought it was the duty of the sheriff to allow to be discussed. The Prince Consort had told them a few years ago that the British constitution did not work well. Whether or not his Royal Highness would like to introduce an Austrian constitution into this country he could not say ; but certainly we had an Austrian constitution already. (A laugh.) The constitutiou of King, Lords, and Commons no longer existed, because a measure to enable the people to elect their own representatives irrespective of their religious opinions had been dis. allowed by the House of Lords, although it had repeatedly obtained the concurrent assent of large majorities of the House of Commons and of successive Ministries of the day, who must also be understood to speak the sentiments of their Sovereign. The Upper House had declared itself supreme. Not only had it recently encroached upon a prerogative of the Crown held for the benefit of the people,bLutit insisted upon arbitrarily excluding wvhom it pleased from the House of Commons as well as from its own chamber. (Hear, hear.) This was an electors' question, and the citizens ought to lay down their lives rather than surrender rights which they held in trust for their children, and on which the House of Lords sought to trample. There was a point beyond which that House ought not to be permitted to go, and that point was now arrived at. (Cbeers.) Mr. Hall concluded by putting the resolution to the show of hands and by declaring it to be carried unanimously. Mr. CRtAWFORD, M.P., returned thanks for the compliment which had been paid to the members for the city, and also to the Liberal members of the House of Commons generally. The hon. gentleman observed thnt thero was no chance of Lord Jobn Russell's Bill passing this session unless the Premier made way for its progress. The Liberal members, however, if properly united, could easily wring such a concession from the noble viscount. (Cheers.) Baron RoTIISCIntD then proposed a vote of thanks to tho sberiffs, which was seconded by AMr. CRAWVFORD, and carried by acclamation. Mr. Sheriff ?iEczs acknowledged the compliment, and the Sheriffs then withdrew. Mr. HARK;ERt, the crier, formally announced the proceedings to be at an end, when some confusion was created by AIr. G. P. Dodd, a Common Councilman, advancing to the rostrum and attempting to propose another resolution. The Crier and Mr. Dodd, for some time, both addressed the crowd at once, but it is hardly necessary to say that in such a rivahly the stentorian lungs of the professional toastmaster had the decided advantage. The official proolama. tion that everybody should depart having been concluded, Mr. DODD at length obtained a hearing. The resolution which he proposed called upon the independent members of the House of Commons and the Government to suspend the Standing Orders, with a view to give the precedence to Lord J. Russell's Bill, and recommended tbem, in the event of the rejection of that measure by the Upper House, to proceed forthwith to seat Baron Rothschild by resolution. IThe motion was seconded by Mr. WJT33R~ulSy and declared to be carried unanimously. The assemblage then quietly dispersed.

COMfMITTEE FOR PFi VZLR'EE EOUSE OF LORDS. MONDAY. JurY 27- __ THE. GREAT SHREBWSBURY CARM- -anesr 1,orasbups sat this morning as a Committee for Privileges to resume the hearing of this case. The Lord Cbancellor, Lord Brongham, Lord St. Leonard's, Lord Wenpleydale, and several other peers were present. At the sitting of the House, Sir . KELI.Y tendered some slight further documentary evidence on behalf of the claimant, and he was then proceeding to sum up the claimant's evidence, when Lord ST. LEONARD'S said, the Hoase could not hear him until after the cases of the parties who appeared in opposition to the claim had been concluded. Major Talbot had sent in a document by which he declined offering any active opposition to the ciaim, but he prayed to be allowed to watch the case. The House would, therefore, only hear Mr. Serjeant Byles and the Attorney-General against the claLim. hlr. R. PALSIER, on behalf of Major Talbot, said, he had received new evidence, which he was prepared to lay before ,Ldord Sr. LEOARD'S.- Xe yonprepared to produce the Mr. R. PAIiIER said, certainly he-was. t Tthe LOtoRD CANCELLOR asked if there was an affidavit Mr. PALMER said, that one could be prepared at once. Sir P. THSIsGER said, that Major Talbot had adopted a singular course. He had first been permitted by the indulgence of their Lordships tolodge a case, and then, having declined to offer anyactive oppstion he now sought to give evidence without having lodged any case at all. Mr. R. PALMER said, he must have made himself misunderstood, for he merely wished to inform their Lordships that he had obtained fresh evidence. He did not propose to produce it before the House. He merely wished to watch the case. Sir F. TBIISIGER said, he had no objection to his learned friend watching the case provided he remained silent. At the suggestion of the HouS, Mr. Serjeant BYLES proceeded to open the case of the Duke of Norfolles second son, in opposition to the claim, by saying that there was no wish on tho part of the Dnke of Norfolk to controvert any honours or emoluments to which Lord Talbot might lay claim. He had not the elightest idea of this devise to his younger son until the death of the late earl. He, however, was the natural guardian of his child, who was an infant not merely in the legal sense of the word, but a child of a few months old and therefore hq was bound in duty to that child to defend its possessions. He should show at least 13 persons as to whom no reasonable evidence had been given that they had died without issue. He could not entertain any reasonable doubt that this was not the last claim to the earldom of Shrewsbury which their Lordships would have to decide upon. Their Lordships would recollect the case of Lord Willoughby, in which the title had been in the possession of a younger branch of the family for a period of 150 years, at the expiration of which time an obscure person livming on Tower-hill came to their Lordships' house and proved to demonstration that he was the true heir to the title through the elder branch, and he took his seat in this House as a Peer. It was only within the last 1l months that the issue of the first Earl of Shrewsbury, whoever they might be, had received notice that they might be entitled to this splendid inheritance. It was most likely from information they had received that several persons would put in their claims to the title. It was true that there had been notices in the public newspapers, but it was not until this case had been published, and the evidence laid before the world, that the parties would know of their rights. He submitted that the case required the must exctraordinary vigilance on the part of their Lordships, for they had to go back for 300 years through the pedigree of a most prolific family, in which there had been many second marriages, and which was now submitted for the first time to anything like a judicial investigation. There was already one person at their Lordships'barwhoclaimed to have sprmng from an issue not mentioned in the case of the claimant. and if time were allowed there was no doubt but that more persons would have appeared before their Lordships. According to the Act of Parliament a person had nothing to do bat to show that he was the real Earl of Shrewshury and he would enter at once into the possession of 45.0001. per annum. 'Whoever was to hold the estates, were it Lord Talbot or were it the Dake of Norfolk's second son, they would always hold it with the sword of doubt suspended over their heads, as the moment a new person proved his right to the title the estates under the Act of Parliament would pass to him vwithout regard to the Statute of Limitations. He (Ur. Serjeant Byles) did not wish to express any disrespect to the judges who were to decide this claim, but he must observe the fact, that at the fag end of the first session after the late earl's death Lord Howard was threatened with the loss of these estates without his having been enabled to prep are his case, or obtain sufficient evidence. Ho should, owever, make such observations upon the claimant's case as he considered necessary, and he should also lay before their Lordships such evidence as he had in his power. He would not trouble their Lordships by going into the claimant's pedigree at large, bat he would content himself by simply laying before their Lordships the weaknesses which presented themselves to his mind in looking at the claimant's case. Before he proceeded to open the case on behalf of the Duke of Norfolk he begged to remind their lordships that Sir F. Thesiger said that he should mainly rest his case upon two documents-the recital in the private Act of Parliament of 1718 and the Benefactor's Pediree. He conld not do justice to the case which he should have the honour to present to their Lordships unless he were indulged with an opportunity of making some observations npon these two pieces of evidence, for if they were to be received by the House without any such observations at all the difficulties with which he should have to contend would be much increased. He would call their Lordships' attention in the first place to the recital in the deed of 1718, executed a year after the death of the Duke of Shrewsbury, and the circumstances under which that recital was introduced in the deed. The father of the duke was Francis, the 11th earl, who was killed in a duel, and his eldest son Charles was left a minor, and the executor of this Francis was WiUiam of Witting. ton, who it was said by the claimant was the father of the Bishop of Salisbury, and who, at all events, must have been perfectly well known to the Duke of Slrewsbury. Most of the members of this illustrious family were Catholics. The Duke of Shrewsbury made the settlement of 1700 when he was in the country, and after he had retired from public business. He would beg their Lordships' attention to the condition of the Catholics at this time, because it would have a most important bearing upon the case. In the early part of the year 1700 an Act of Parliament, the l1th and 12th Wiliam III., c. 4, was passed, entitled "an Act for further preventing the growth of Popery." The provisions of that Act seemed almost incredible to us of the present time. The 100th section gave a reward of 1001. to any informer who should convict a Roman Catholic bishop, prie-st, or gentleman of celebrating mass, and the second section inDficted imprisonment for life upon the parties so offending. The third section was the most iTrportant; it rendered Catholic landowners incapable of taking or holding lands, and enacted that if witbin six montbs after coming to the age of 18 Catholics did not abjure their faith by making a declaration against transubstantiation, their estates should go atonce to the next of kin being a Protestant. The title and the lands were thus at the merev of their nearest relations, and any informer might inflict upon them these severe penalties, without incurring the risk of which they could not practise the sacred rites of their most august religion. Iord BROUGRAM.-What did you say, Mr. Serjeant Byles,-of what religion? We didnot hear you distinctly. 31r. Serjeant B3YLXS-Of their religion; be would use that term if their Lordships preferred it. Under these circumstances he would point their Lordships' attention to the state of the family at this period. Gilbert was a Catholic priest, and George was also a Catholic. Sir John, of Longford, was a Catholic next in succession, and Sir John, of Lacock, was the only Protestant. Jobn of Longford had no children. The Bishop of Salisbury was perfectly well known to the duke, who had been his benefactor, and who it might be presumed wished to benefit him further. It was under the:e circumstances that the duke had to settle very large estates in his name and blood. The duke, who appeared to have been aperson of very great wealth indeed, in settling his estates only made the bishop a trustee, and did not leave them to the bishop as a possible heir to the title, but rather excluded him from the possession of them, which would not bave been done supposing it was known he had a chanec of becoming the earl. He snbmitted that the bisbop was not in the position that the claimant endeavoured to place him in, or that the duke knew that between himself and the bishop there were a great number of persons who would have a prior claim to the title and the estates. The recital in the deed he should contend was made at the instance of the bishop, and was therefore not a proper doennient to be received in evidence by their Lordships. With respect to the pedigree contained in the Benefactors, he contsnded that the proof of the signature of Gilbert Talbot to it was not sufficiently proved by the comparison of the initial letters " G. T." on Gilbert Talbot's will with the signature purporting to be his in the Benefactors. BEsdees this want .f authenticity lie should show that there were a great many erasures, and upwards of 13 persons vvho would be proved to have existed of whom the Benefactors made no mention, and who were not proved by the claimant to have died without issue. UJnder these circumstanes he treated thbattheir Lordshipq would not allow the claim of Lord Talbot to the title of E3arlof Shrewabury. At the conclusion of the learned seijeant>'s address, Their L.ORDSITIIS deferred the further bearing of the case for the opposing parties until half-past 10 to-morrow. JUsLY 28. Their Lordships resumed the hearing of the case in opposition to this claim at half-past 10 o'clock this morning. Mr. Serjeant BYLEs proceeded to produce evidence for the purpose of showing the incorrectness of the Benefactor's pedigree. In order to show this several ancient wills, deeds, and inquisitions were tendered, in which a great many persons bearing the name of Tnlbot were referred to who were not mentioned in the Benefactor's pedigree. Amzong these were a Sir Hnmphrey Talbot and a John Talbot, said to be the issue of the first Earl of Talbot by a second marriage. In the first line a Thomas wsa mentioned, said to be a brother of the fourth earL of whom al subse. quent trace was lost. William, a son of the fourth earl, said to have died without issue, was stated in certain documents to have had a son Walter, of whom no subsequent trace could be found. As to tbe second line Sir Gilbert of Grafton was said by the claimant to have had by his first marriage only one son, Gilbert, but in the will of the abovementioned Sir Hum. pbrey. Sir Gilbert of Grafton was said to have had a second sons Humphrey. A will of Gilbert, the eldest son, stated thar he had two sons, Humphrey and Walter. Walter was said to bave had issue who could be traced for several can. tories. Sir John of Abbington was stated to have bad two sons and five daughters by his first marriage, which were not mentioned in the Benefactors, and Jobn, the tenth earl, was said to have had a third brother, Gilbert, liv i 1609. With respeot to the third line the claimant's pedigree was admitted to be correct down to Sherrington of Rndge who was stated by the Benefactors to have had six sons, *l hut one of whom died without issue. By the deeds put in videnco it was now attempted to he proved tha besides the six sons he had fonr daughters, and that the sixth son, Gilbert, said to have died without issue, had one son and two daughters. Charles, a grandson of Sherrington, was also said to have had issue, mentioned in certain deeds. Another grandson of Sherrington, not mentioned by the Benefactors, was stated to have had issue. By his second marriage, according to the claimant's pedigree, Sherrington bad three sons, of whom George and Edfward were said to have died without issue, whereas it was now attempted to be proved that George hada son William. If the case thus endeavonred to be made out by the arties in opposition be correct, the title and estates have en in the hands of wrongful possessors for upwards of two centuries, and not one of the present claimants would be entitled to them. Thus the second son of the Dakeo of Norfolk would be able to keep psession of the estates until Fome person came forward who could make out his claim to the title to their lordships' satisfaction. At the conclusion of the documentary evidence, The Rev. Dr. Logan and the Rev. Dr. Rock, both Catholio clergymen, were called for the purpose of speaking to conversations they had had with John, the last Earl but one of Shrewsbury, in which he had said that Lord Talbot had no claim to the earldom in case of Bertram's death, and that he did not belong to the same family. The Rev. Dr. Rock said, he had had his attention drawn to the evidence of Mrs. Hibbard, which aupeared in Tlt Times, and knewing that he could give e~yldence in con. tradietion to hers he had felt it his dutty to tender it. The hearing will be resumed on Thbrsd-y morning.

This appeal came on before the Lords Justices on the 28th of May, when their Lordships made an order suspending the Injunction until the 29th of July, and directing the motion to stand over until this day without prejudice to any queston, the Stockport Company undertaking in the meantime to use all possible diligence to complete the branch line in question in the suit. Lord Justice EIlrsGU BBUCE said, he expected that the two companies would come to some arrangement, and it was highly satisfactory that they had done so. EXPARTE GRAY, INi RE THE XRWCASTrnvUPoX p,' MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY, This was a case where the Lords Justices had directed an action to le tried, and now came on upon the equity reserved, The facts are in some degree complicated, and had better be reserved until the whole case has been heard. Mr. LEE and Mr. F. S. WmrLrs were heard for Mr. Gray.

CE.LETHWAIT. This was an appeal from an order of Vice-Chancellor Wood refusing to dissolve an injunction which had been granted by him, ex parte, to restrain the cutting down of ornamental timber. The short point may be thus stated,Mr. Nathaniel Micklethwait was in 1812 the owner of the Beeston estate and the Taverham-hall estate, both in the county of Norfolk, and then settled the same upon bimself for life, and after various remainders remainder to himself .in fee-simple. He lived at Beeston until 182:3, when he removed to Taverham-hall, where he continued to reside. In 1845 he, with the approbation of his eldet son, the tenant for life in remainder, under the settlement of 1812 (however irregularly) pulled down the mansion-house of Beeston, but left the gardens, shrubbery, grounds, and timber as they were, excepting a few trees he had cut down and some underwood he had planted under the avenue of trees. In 1852 Mr. Micklethwait made his will, settling these estates (subject to the limitations of the settlement of 1812) upon his second son Mr. John Nathaniel Micklethwait for life, with dlivers remainders over. In January, 1856, he died, and his eldest son, the tenant for life in remainder, died in July following, and, leaving no child, the limitations of the settlement of 1812 failed, and the second son, Mr. J. N. Micklethwait, became tenant for life in possession. In the will this gentleman was made dispunishable of waste, except volantary waste, in pulling down houses and not rebuilding others of equal value. The present tenant for life, being about to cut downl53 oak trees stand. ing in the north and south parks, part of which constituted a portion of the avenue to the Beeston-house when it stood, the person next in remainder filed his bill to restrain this proceeding, and an injunction was granted to restrain it ; and upon motion Vice-Chancellor Wood refused to dissolve it, his Elonour being of opinion that the timber was ornamental timber, notwithstanding that the mansion-house had been pulled down. The case, by arrangement, has been converted into a hearing from a decree. Mr. Cairns and Mr. Lewin supported the order of the Vice-Chancellor and for the plaintiff on the whole case; Mr. Bedwell is for parties in remainder; hfr. Rolt and Mr. G. M. Giffard were for the appellant, on the motion for the defendant in the suit. The defendant's case is not concluded.
VICE-CHANOCELORS' COURT, TuESDAY. Jumv2R COOKE V. CHOLION-MIw.V tiucjorc Vtce-Clancelor Si7' R T. Knwr.RqT.V.V % n his suit was instituted to administer the estate of the late Sir Gregory Page Turner, and now came on upon the petition of the testator's widow, and her daughter, Mrs. Fryer, by Sir Winston Barron as next friend, and prayed that the encumbrances, amonnting to 88,0001., which the personalty was insufficient to pay, miebt be paid off sale of sufficient part of such real estate. The estates were hmited by the will of the late Sir Gregory Page Turner to his wife Lady Page Turner for life, with remainderto Mrs. Fryer (his daughter) for Ihfe, with remainder to her children in tail, with the next limitation in favour of the present baronet, Sir Edward Page Tunmer, and afterwards to Sir Winston Barron. The will contained no direction as to payment of encumbrances out of the realty, and the question was, whether an equity existed by which a tenant for life could require a sale ot the real estate to pay off such encumbrances. MIr. Baily and Mr. Jessel appeared in support of the petition; UIr. Glasse and Mr. Freeling opposed it; Mr. C. P. Cooper appeared for the trustees. The VIro-CHANCELLOB said, that upon the will the intention of the testator was to have all his debts, &c., paid out of his personal estate, and, if there was any surplus, that the mortgages, which were created by himself, should be paid out of such surplus. There was nothing, therefore, providing for the events which had happened, and the mortgage debts were left to be dealt with according to the ordinary course. No direction was given by the original decree in respect of mortgages, but it being the undoubted right of persons for whose benefit the estate was being administered te have a direction, not only to pay debts but to disecharge the property from mortgages, tbe question was whether the Court had indicated any intention to deal with them ? It had not. Why, did not appear, and, in the absence of sach a direction, the Court having authority now todo so, there must be an inquiry as to what portion of the real estate it would be fit and proper to sell for the purpose of discharging the mortgage debts which were encumbrances on the estate. As to directing an account, although that might have been done by summons, it was competent for the Coart to make that part of the order. (Beforc Vice-7zatneUor Sir W. P. WOOD.) ITAYTER V. TUCKER. The arguments in this case were resumed. The question, as has been already stated, is whether a sum of 1621. cash, arising from the sale of shares held by the testator in various mines conducted upon the cost-book system, could be treated as pure personalty, and as such available for a gift in the testator's will to the poor of the parish of Cranborne; or whether it was in effect an interest arising out of land, and within the provisions of the statute of Charitable Uses (9th of George IL, cap. 36). Mr. De Gex was for the plaintiff; MIr. Willcox and Mr. Schomberg appeared for the next of kin; and Mr. Rolt and Mr. Bush in support of the charitable bequest. The VICE-C1uANCELTOn said that in the absence of any further evidence as to these shares, it appeared to be settled that shares in a trading partnership were not an interest in land within the statute; but he was unwiUing to decide the case until some inquiry had been made as to the way in which these shares were held. Let the matter stand unti Saturday next for this purpose. CARTER V. GIREN. The question in this case was as to the validity of a residuary be uest contained in the wil of the late Rev. Rowland il in favour of "the ViUage Itinerancy, or Evangelical Association for the Pro gation of the Gospel," which was now known as " the heological Seminary, and Socisty for the Propagation of the Gospel," the contention of the next of kin being that, looking at the objects of this association as set forth in a deed of declaration executed in 1811, the bequest could not he carried into effect without the purchase and devotion of land for the purposes of mortmiain, and therefore that it was void un ler the statute of 9th George II., cap. 36. Some questions also arose upon a codicil and a deed declaring trusts for similar MrRolt, M. Daniel, Mr. WiDcock, Mr. W. M. James, Mr. Giffard, 3Mr. Osborne, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Kenyon, Mr. W. D. Lewis, and Mr. Whitehorne appeared for the several parties. The Vic-CEChNcELLOR, after observing that he had a strong opinion that the gift was valid, said that he would look into the authorities and give judgment on Thursday morning. ________

BANEBUPICY COURT, Basinghagerc, July 28. IN RE OAVp -, [BeJorc Jrr. .ObQ Thea bankrupt was a merchant ofA Old Broadl-sheet. Messr. Hart's statement Of his affairs show a capital in January, 1855, of 11,2581., and present unsecared debts about 28,0001,, the assets being supposed to be barelysnffi. cient to pay a dividend of Is. 6d. m the pound. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. nurray opposed for tho assignees; Mr. Lawrance T'pered. a protracted examination of the bankrupt, which occasioned considerable discaussion. The case will be best given in the form of a descriptive summary. The bankrupt, it would appear, Came to England in 1843. He WaS for fives years in the house of Ireatler and Meville, and for some time successfully carried on the business of a comn mission agent. He then embarked into very large transactions on his own account. The official assignee reports vexy favourably of the manner in which the accounts have been kept. The bankruptcy occurred on the 28th of February, 1857. On the 18th of February the bankrupt bought about 1,700L worth of tin, and immediately obtained an advance upon tho samo of. about the same amount. On the 23d of February he paid 2,3001. to Messrs. Bischoffheim and Goldsmidt. It was suggested that this payment was preferential and seriously affected the bankrupt's conduct. The bankrupt admitted that about November last he obtained a double advance on the same goods under the following circumstances. He first obtained advances to the amount of 2,3001. from Messrs. Bischoffheim and Co. by a representation to the wharfinger that the goods were his property. He sabsequently obtained a similar advance from another party on the bill of lading of the property as lying in the Docks. It was urged that the bankrapt had ootained the tin as a means of making good the wrong he had committed spon Messrs. Bischoffheim and Co. The payment of 2,300WL was made to them, as the bankrupt stated, on the morning of the 23d of Febraary, and at a later hour of the same day he resolved to take into consideration his position in consequence of a letter then received. Mr. Murray contended, however, that the llarseilles Postmark upon the letter warranted the belief that the letter had been received on the morning of the day, and, it was sugested, before the payment to Meesra. Bischoffheim and Go dsmidt had been made. For the bankrupt it was stated that during the month of February his payments had amounted to 30,0001, and that they included the payment of several thousand pounds subsequent to the payment to Messrs. Bischoffheim snd Goldsmidt; that he had received between the 18th and 23d of February a sum of 2,0001. from his brother-in-law, and who had not been repaid that amount. On the other hand the bankrupt acknowledged that he had erred in receiving advances upon cargoes of goods, and that he could not have paid Messrs. Bischofiheim and Co. their advances on the day he did but for the proceeds of the tin, although be could have paid it between the 2-3d and the 28th of February. Mr. Lkwmsxcn said, that al the parties towards whom the bankrupt had acted irregalarly had been paid, and the points in the case he understood to be whether this had been done preferentially. That would be for the consideration of the Court upon the evidence before it. Mr. MuRRAY said, that it was due to commerce that the obtaining advances by traders both on goods at the wharfinger's and upon the bills of lading should be brought before the Court. It was an important question. The Co ussioNmm sgaid, he was disposed to view the case favourably before he heard the evidence. It was, however, one of the greatest blots that could affect a merchant to obtain double advances upon goods, first at the wharfinger's, and next on the bills of lading. It struck him that a loose mode of business mnst be carried on by wharfingers, or such transactions could not take place. Nine-tenths of commercial business was carried on by advances, and if this practice should be permitted it would strike at the root of onr commercial system. It appeared from some further evidence that the bankrupt had received 9001, in the monthof February for the purchase of saltpetre, and that he had only purchased and delivered 52. worthl. The difference was proved against his His HONOuR ordered an adjomrnment to November. In the meantime the evidence would be laid before him, and he would give the same his best consideration. I RE J. A. PERVANOGLU. The bankrupt (a Greek) was a merchant of Union-court, Old Broad-street. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. Gole appeared for creditors; Mr. Lawrance for the bankrupt. His HoNouR said the bankrupt's accounts extended over a period of only two years and a month. His unsecured debts were now nearly 13,0001., and there were liabilites to the further amount of about the same sum. There would not be a farthing for the creditors. The bankrunt's trading had been most reckless and improvident, and objectionable in the] highest degree. TTe would receive only a third class certificate, and but for good bookkeeping there must have been a suspension. IN RE G. C. FRANGEIADL The bankrupt (a Greek) was a merchant of Greshamhouse, Old Broad-street, trading as Franghiadi Sons. The unsecured debts exceed 110,0001., and there are liabilities to the further amount of about 60,0001. The available assets are about 25,0001. This was the certificate meeting. MIr. Peachey for the assignee, and mr. Iawrance for the bankrupt, asked for a first-class certificate. Mr. M. AiRAHAMs for a creditor said, he had objected on a former occasion that certain property had not been given up. It was due to the bankrupt to state that he was satisfie4 on that point. The losses and trade and personal e,penses had, however, been at the rate of 16.0001. a year, while the profits were only 3,000L a-year. The personal expenditure ofthe bankrupt (a bachelor) had been at the rate of 1,2001, a-year, and his estate did not pa more than 5s. in the pound. The bankrupt ht a been a partner with two others in houses abroad, and they had kept up their credit by drawing upon each other. Had a second-class certificate been asked for he would not have said sword. Mr. LAw.Axcz, In reference to the personal expenditure of 1,1007 or 1,2001. a-year, thought it moderate, considering the bankrupt's position as a merchant. , The style in which the merchant princes of our days, and especially foreign merchants, lived, was enough to take the breath out of ordinary persons. TheCo lsso- V had a foreign merchant here the other day, and the rent of one of his houses was 7501. a-year. I have observed that thoforeign merchant generally keeps better books than the English merchant. Imust also observe that his personal expenditure is generally r. LAwRANCE proceeded to urge that the failuare had been occasioned entirely by the cessation of the Russian war. Mrs. Seacole had relied upon the continuance of the war, and Mr. Evans, with that learned commissioner's cus. tomary gallantry, had awarded a first-class certificate. He (Mr. Lawrance) did not for a moment suggest that the learned Commissioner had been unduly influenced by the charms of the lady. (Laughter.) On the contrary, he felt that Mtrs. Seacole was fully entitled to a firet-class certificate, and he must contend that the bankrupt was similarly entitled thereto. His HONOUR reviewed the circumstances, aud believing that the failmuo had been occasioned entirely by the stoppage of the war granted a first-class certificate. (Before Afr. Commissioner- FA.m) I1N RE J. NELSON. The bankrupt was an auctioneer, of Chapel-place, Oxfordstreet, and Hammeramith; he was also a wine merchant, of Fenchureh-street. Thiswas a meeting for the proof of debts and choice of Mr. Chidley appeared for the petitioning creditor; Mr. Lawrance for the bankrupt. Mr. B. C. Jones, of Moorgate-street, tobacconist, opposed in person the bankrupt's discharge from prison. Mr. Commissioner Goulburn, in the cases of Pinkstone and other bankrupts, had refused to order their discharge, there being no assets. The bankrupt, examined, said there were no a6sets in court. He was, however, the owner of eight houses at Goldhawk-terrace, Shepherd's Bush, for which about two years ago he gave 2,6001. They were now mortgaged for 1, 2001 cr 1,400?. Mr. Jones.-Will the mortgagee make any further advance upon them? The CommissossERs.-Yon need not answer that question. I see no reason to keep the bankrupt in prison. Discbarge ordered accordingly. The decision was received with manifestations of approbation.
I ThSOLrVENT DEBTOIS' COURT, Jvly 28. LSN RE JOHN CATTOV. (Before th Cinr CoxxIs-r OI te - nvens, an eiaerly man, petitioned under the Pro. tection Act. Mr. Pittar appeared for creditors. The case was before the Court on a former day, when some amended accounts were required to show the disposition of a sum of 1,500/., and also that some furniture might be valued. An account had been filed, shovwing that nearly 9001. had been lent to one of the insolvent's sons, who had passed through this court, and about 400. had been disposed of in gifts to another son. Mr. PrrvAR asked for the costs of opposition to be allowed out of the estate. The CHms Co(Josirssiom, however, was not satisfied with tho accounts, and ordered the case to stand adjourned until Novemberfor further information; the question of costs to be reserved. (Beforc Mr: Commisioner Mu:PHY.) IN RE ASHEP. STEIN. This insolvent, who had been a tailor and clothier at the East-end, was to have been heard to-day, but was not presnt. Mr. Nichols and Mr. Sargood appeared for creditors. It was announced that tho insolvent, who is confined in Ncwgate upon a chargo of arson, was too ill to be brought up. Mr. SARGOOD said, the creditors were anxious to have inI formalion respecting certain statements in the balanme. sheet. In five months, from February to June, the insolvent bad obtained goods from various, creditors to the extent of 3,090!., andhadpaid only 1,738to. There was a de- ficiency of 1 L to be accounted for, and the explanation given was a loss of 100I. by a fire and the debts due to the estate. One debtor, MIr. WViTheims, for 5001, had been summoned toattend,and theocreitors wished to examine Mr. WilheIms was called, but by the advice of his solicitor, Mr. Lewis, of EIyplac declined to be sworn, as the insolvenit was not present. Mr. SAItGOOD contended that the insolvent's presence was not absolutely twecessary to enable the creditors to examine witnesses respecting the estate. Mr. Commissioner MuRPHy though the insolvent onght to be present when witnesses were examined, and adjourned the case Until FridLy to ascertain whether the insolverit would be in a fit state to be brought up on that day. 3N KR JOHN ELSON.

Mr. Deedes and Ar. Robinson conducted the prosecution Mr. Serjeant Ballatine 'was s*ecially retained with Mr. G. Denman to defend the prisoner. The circumstances under which thii charge was preferred 'were of rather an extraordnary character. The deceased, ir. ?d'Carroll, was a very young man, and it appeared that at the time he met with his death he waa a lieutenant in 'he 44th Regiment, and was stationed with that regiment at Walmer barracks, near DeaL The priaoner kept the Ship pub1ichoo6e upon the }Esplasade at Deal, and about 1 o'clock on the morning of the -29th of Marchthe deceased spoke to a cossgardmuan, nam4ed Morden, who asa on duty on the Beplanade, and asked him to tell him where he oould get something to drink, and at the same time stated that he had b)een to the Sandwich electionand had l0st dg. The deceased ws at this timne evidently. the worse for liquor. Morden directed him to the house kept by the prisoner, and lie knocked at the door, which was opened by lIrs. Baker. the wie of the prisoner, and he asked her to let him have a gLas8 of grog " upon tick." She replied tha she did not allow any one to have liquor **upon tick," and told him to go xbout hiB business. This refusal evidently excited the deceased, and he called out to Mrs. Baker that she rnight go to-, and she would find that a hot place enough for her. The deceased had a rather thick stick writh him at the time, and, although thero was no0 distinct evidence to slhowv that he actually did resort tol any violence, yet it appeared that after the deceased had1 eOne away Mrs. Baker complained to MIorden that the| young gentleman had thrust his stick into her mouth, and had forced out twso of her teeth, and there was no doubtl that. she made this statement;to her husband, and that this led to the fatal event that afterwrards occurred. The de-eased had gone away inx the direction of the barracks at 'Walmer, when the prisoner came out of his house vwitheut a hat or coat, and evidently in a great p as. sion, and he inquired which way the deceased had gOne, and, on his being informed, he 'went in that direction, but returned in aboat five or ten minfutes and went into his house; and he then, aooording to the evidence of voe of the witnesses, named Deesent, went into the tap. roomn, after he had put on his hat and coat and took up the poker from the lire place in the tap-room, placed it ini his poocet, and left the house a second time. lie was then seen to proceed again in the direction of the barracks, evidently in pursuit of the deceased, and shortly afterwards cries wvere heard, but it appeared that no notice was taken of them;and, although there was no doubt that the prisoner overtook; the deceased, and that he inflicted upon him the injuries w.hich caused his death, there was no evidence whatever to show what took place, or under what circumnstances the fatal njuries wrere inflicted. The prisoner was very soon afterwards seen comiing towards his own house, and it was observed that there ws something sticking out of his pocket, the end of wrhich appearedlike the head of a pokcer. At half-past 6 o'clock on the samne morning the deceased ws found lying on the seashore on the route he 'would have had to pass to eotto the barakina almost lifeless state, nearly mnaensih¶e and unable to speak, and he was removed to his quarters, where he died about 9 o'clock, wfithout beirg able to give any explanation of the circumstances under w.hich he had lost his life. UJpon a podt mortenm exansina. iion it 'was discovered that there was a fracture of the skull seven inches in length, which, with its consequenoces wvas the cause of death;* and Mr. Mason, the surgeon who 'w as called in, expressed his opinion that this injur 'was of a nature that wfould bave been occaisioned by a violent blowv from such a weaponasa pker. It appeared tbat wFhen the prisoner returned to Deal the second time he told Morden, the coastgnardman, that he "had caught the deceased near the tollgate. and that he had something in his pocket, anud he gave it to him." He wras asked where he had left the deceased, and he said that he had left him -breast the dockyard, and near the red light, and he also stated that before he cameaw fromhi hie told him that he kept a publichouse in Deal, aud that if he wvanted him he could find him. The prisoner, it appeared. 'was taken into custody on the samne day, and en his being told that he was charged wvith killing anman by beatmng him upon the head, he said that the man had thrust a stick into hi wife's mouth and neatly drew out her tongue, and he went after himu with a bayin, or small stink, and that when he came up with him the man struck him, and hc was obliged to use his stick. The cap of the deceased 'was found near the tollgate, and it was suggested gn the part of the prosecution that the fatal affray had taken place at this spot, and that the body of the deceased had been afterwards carried to the place where It was fountd, atnd where it might possibly have bcena washed away by the tide.~osb Thede *Serjeant BALLrANTIN made a meet powerful and able defence for the prisoner, and while he dmitted that it would he impossible for him to deny that kt was by his hand that the unfortunate young genteman had met his death he said he entertained a confident hopertbat whean th jury looked at all the circumstances surrounding the sad occurrence they would feel that they were not calledupon to return a verdict the effect of which wdould undouelybe to consign the risoner to the scaffold; but tha tey would come to the conclusion that a verdict of manslaughter hould be quite tauficient to satisfy theo nds of justice. He thed called the athtntion of the hnsy to the facts, and aid that whether the deceased had made nue of violence tohards the wife of the prisoner or noa there oould be no doubt that tho prisoner -leoved that hg, had done so, and itiwas inder this impression he had revolved upon ipfliitiag some chastisement upon the deceased; hut he subithtd tlat there was notbin to show that t he had any dea intention onhis mind, and there was no evdence as to what actually occuraed upon his coming up with the deceased, or to prove that tbe statement made by himseif upon the sub- iect was not the troth, Be concluded by stating that he felt assured the jury would reake allowance for the feelings of a husband who was placed in the position of the prisoner, and who had reason to believe that his wife had teen most grossly insulted audassaulted, and that, although they might entertin no doubth tatrthe prshoner had been the unhappy cause of the death of the deceased, yet, at the same time, they would feel that the act wlas not comnitted onder such circumstances Es 'would anmount to the dreadful crime of gilful murder.

The cuse list oontains an entry of seven causes, one of which is marked fora sDecial jury. The calendar contains a list of only 14 prisone.s, charged with offences of a light character. CIvIL CoURT.-(Beforc Mr. Baron BRAaIsWn and a Com- mon Jury.) SIUDMOIm V. DARBY. Mr. Serjeaut Pigott and Mr. Gray appeared for the plaintiffr and. Mr. Skinner, Q.C., and Yr. Dowdeswell for the deiendant. The plaintiffin this action, J. Skidmore, was amine agent livig at Brierly-hill, in Staffordshire, and he sued the defendant, J. Darby, a maltster, at the same place, to reeover a sum of money as commiss0on for the sale of a mine in the Forest of Dean. It appeared that the defendant had come Into possession of the mino in quesUion upon the death of his father. to whom the plaintiff had formerly sold it. On old Mr. Darby's death it had been again placed in the laintiff's hands for sale, and subsequently to old Darby's .eath the defendant had given the plaintiff a written authority to sell the mine for 1,2001. upon the terms that he should have 51. per cent. as commission and whatever sum he could get beyond 1,2001. According to the plaintiff's evidence he found a purchaser for the mine in a Mr. Gibbons, who, by means of his agent, a Mr. Jones, agreed to purchase the mine for 1,5001. This agreenent was reduced to writing and signed by the plaintiffand Jones. When tendered in evidence it appeared that the agreemxent had only a penny stamp affixed, upon which the sum of 1ll. 2s. 6d., to include the penalty and stamp, waspaid Into court, and the document was read. The defendant subsequently concluded an agreement with the same Mr. Gibbons for the sale of the mine for 1,2001., bat promised the plaintiff to pay him hi8 commission; but, as this was not done, the present action was brought. The defence was that the plaintiff had not received any authority from the defendant to sell the mine, and having paid 151. into court the defendant contended he was not further hable. After a lengthened tral the jury were of the same opinion, and found for the defendant. CRIrIsUAr CovrRT.-(Before Ifr Baron UARTm.) Joseph Jones, 44, labourer, and Joseph Dodd (on bail) were charged with stealing 3501b. weight of lead and 401b. weight of tin, the property of Ezer Penzor, on the 8th of July, 1857, at Bridgenorth. Mr. Scotland appeared for the prosecution, Mr. Kettle defended Dodd. The otherprisoner was undefended. It appeared that the prisoner Jones was the servant of Mr. renzor, a builder and plumber at Bridgnorth, who on the 10th of July last, missed about haR a ton of lead from his premises and also a quantity of tin. Within a few days after the prisoner Dovd had sold lead mixed with tin to a marine store dealer at Wolverhampton. It did not appear that there had been any concealment or secrery i the removal or sale of the goods, nor did the price at which they were sold raise any just suspicion of guilt. Jones did not deny the sale of tho lead to Dodd, but stated that he had bought it of several persons, whom he named. Mr. KETTL;, for Dodd, cross-examined the witnesses to show that tin, which was one of the component parts of solder, was often found in old lead.

NORFOLK CiRATrr- NORWICE, JULY 27. The commissions for the county of Norfolk and thc city of Norwich were opened yesterday afternoon, and this morning both the learned judges proceeded to the despatch of business, Lord Campbell predding on the civil side,. where there is an entry of one undefended cause tor the city, and 13 causes for the county, of which two are marked for trial by special juties. The city calendsr contains the names of 13 prisoners, tho principal cases being a charge of concealment of birth, and one in which five persons are charged with an extensive system of robbery at a confectioner's. The calendar for the county embraces one charge of murder, one of perjury, one of forgery, one of concealment of birth, one of burglary, one of rape, and several ordinary larcenies. NIst PRIUS COIJBT.-(Before Lord CA?APBELL) SWANYX V. AGAS ANTD HUNT. Mr. Serjeant Wells and Mr. Evans were counsel for the plamntiff; Mr. Palmer and Mr. Couch represented the do. fendant8. This was an action for false imprisonment. The defendant Agas is a small farmer, and Hunt a parish constable. It appeared from the evidence of the plaintiff and his brother, who are dealers, that they bought four bullocks of Air. Agas in April last at an inn, for which they paid 11. down and a cbeck for 63M., which was drawn by a fnend named Larko, who wrote on the back of the cheek-, "This check for 631. for four bullocks," af ter which the defendant Agas endorsed it. This done, the plaintiff's brother and Larke fetched avway thefour bullocks fromthe prenmsesof thedeferndant anddrove them past the inn. In the course of the same day the defandaut overtook the bullocks, insisted that he hbd only sold three, and gave the fourth in charge of the defendant Hlunt, with orders to take any one into custody who should take it away from him. In consequence of this order Hunt took the plaintiff into custody that evening on his insisting lapon having all the bullocks. After tbeee hours the dc. fendant Agas came, pnd when asked wbat should be done with the plaintiff, he said, "Oh,. you may sell him if youL like, upon which the constable, Hunt, .let him go at large. On the part of the defendant it was contended thab theplaintiff and his brother had obtained the fourth bullock fraudulently from him, and that, in fact, the bargain was only for three bulIocks. The jury decided the dispute by finding a verdict for the plaintiff for bl. damages. AGAS V. SWVA-. The same learned counsel appeared in this case as in the last, the plaintiff sueing for the price of the fourth bullock. By COnsEnt a set procasu was entered.
MIDLANfl CTR(TTT'i DERBY, JULY 27. Ar. Justice Creswell arrived here on Saturday afternoon and opened the commission. The Court was then adjourned to 10 o'clock this mornng.C The business on the Civil side is unusually heavy, there being au entry of 19 causes, of which foar are to be tried by special jies. The usual number is not more than teven or eight. The calendar contains the names of 34 prisoners, but the charges generally are not of a serious charaterf There are however, two charges oE arson, three of burglary, four of robbery, two of night poaching, one of riot, three of stealing post letters, one of perjury, and one of uttering a forged guarantee.
NORTITFRN (IT cqTorrT NEWCASTLE. JULY 27. Alr. .Iaron Watson arrived at this town on Saturdayafternoon from Darham and immediately opened the commission, Mr. Baron Channell not finishing the assizo at that town till late on Saturday night. Their Lordships yesterday attended divino service at St. Nicholas Church. This morning Mr. Baron Watson gat at the Guildhall for the trial of the town prisoners at 9 o'dock and was asisted by Mr. Overend, Q. C., in the Magistrates' Room. Mr. Baron C5lA?NELL charged the grnmd jury for the county at the Moot-hall at 10 o'clock. The calendar for the towrn contains the names of 23 prisoners, nearly all charged with assaults and robberies in the streets of Newcastle. The county calendar contains the names of only eight prisoners, one of whom Is charged with stealing a Post-office letter, the rest with ordinary robberies. The cause Ist contains an entry of four causes for the town and three for the county. One of them is a new trial in a pedigree cause, which is expected to occupy two days. 'The criminal cases tried to-day before Mr. Baron Chan. neU were of the most ordinary description.
POLICB. ARTLOROUGH-STRMEET.-HenryMolser, a foreigner, waS brought up for final examination, charged with various felonies. Two cases wore found to be complete,-One for stealing a quantity of silk- the other for stealing 12 biliard balls. The prisoner pleaded "Guilty." and was sentenced to six months' hard labour for the first offence, and two months' additional for the second offence. 21. received from " W. J. B.," for William Bray. MAoYLEBonx.-Richard Stapleton, residing in Aberdeen place, St. John's-wood, was charged, on a summons which had been served upon him by Osborne the oficer, with having severely beaten Sarah, his wife. The victim of the prisoner's violence, who was very re ctably dressed and carried in her arms an infant, detailed her grievances, and stated that the prisoner was in the constrat babitof r-treating her. On the 25th inst. he came home. when he struck and kicked her in a moab bratal manner. Her right eye was braised and swollen, and she had marks of violence--(they were deposed to by a woman who examined her in the magistrate's private room)-upon the lower part of her legs and thighs. Mr. Bn;Glmn addressed the prisoner In snitable de. nunciatory terms with regard to the shameful nature of his coaduct, and committed him to hard laboar in the House of Correction for four months. Ile was then locked up. WsntsRsTnn-Daniel McCartby, a stout labourer, was charged with a series of violent and unprovoked assaults. Jo Purchase, a horsekeeper. living at No. 5, Great Peter-street, Westminster, stated that a little after 12 on Monday night he was within a few doors of his own home when the defendant came up to him and said " Aint you going to stand something?" Complainant inquired why he should treat him, when defendant observed that he would sive him something, and immediately struck him a violent blow in the eye and knocked him down; after which he pulled him up from the ground and gave him anotherviolent blow in the face. Ho then ran away and got into his house, where the police captured him. Samuel Gordon, 241B, said, that he saw the complainant rising from the ground disfigured with a black eye, and defendant running away from him. He pursued the latter, who got into his house, upon whioh he and his father and mother barrcaded the door. As prosecutor informed him that when the defendant pulled him up to strike him he attempted to rob him, witness, assisted by another constable, proceeded to break open the door, when defeadant kicked at himtwice through one of the broken panels. Thomas Robinson, 236 B, said, that defendant swore he would knock dowrn with a poker the first man who entered, and when witness got into the house defendant gave him two blows across the leg with a poker. Another constablo proved that defendant was very violent and assaulted him. The complainant, Purchase, on being recallecd, said, that he hadno doubtthe defendant intended torobhim, for when he dragged him up to strike him the second time he turned one |of his trousers pockets inside out. Defendant having pleaded intoxication as an excuse for his violence, Mr. ARaSOLD ordered him to pay a fine of 5Z. for the assault on Purchase, or be committed for two months; and in addition to suffer a further imprisonment of a month for assaulting the police. WoRSmIP-sTRsEr.-Elisa Austin, a dissipated-looking woman of 31, was charged with the following outrage. On the preceding day a man named Arnold, with whom the prisoner has been living for the last three years, was charged at this court with a most brutal assault upon her. The prisoner was then proved to have been disgracefully drunk, while the man was perfcctly sober. Some quarrel ensued between them, which led to her smashing the windows, which so enraged Arnold that he struck her two fearful blows on the sides of her head and then a third in the face, which knocked her down with such violence that her head struck against the pavement and rebounded from it, leavingher senseless, with two black eyes andher features shockingly contused and disfigured. The woman, notwithstanding, stontly denied that she had been struack at all, declaring her injuries to have been sustained by her falling from a wall, but the constable had seen the assault committed, and, it having been proved that Arnold had before assaulted her with smilar violence and undergone a long term of imprisonment for it, he was again sent to the House of Correction for six months' hard labour. After the ran had been so sentenced the prisoner went back again to the house, and was packing up some things to take to the pawnbroker's, when Arnold's son, a little fellow 12 years old, tried to prevent her, and entreated her not to do so. She so threatened him with violence that the boy let her have her way and went into the street, from which the prisoner caled hi to come into the house. He saw she had a blaok-handled knife in her hand, was terrified and refused to go in, on which the prisoner rushed at him, dragged him mn by his hair, and on getting him over the threshold stabbed at the boy with the knife. He putup his handto save himself from the blowv, and partially did so, but at the expense of a severe cut on one of his thumbs. A number of the neighboours, who had heard the child's screams, then ran into the house, and there found the prisoner and the boy, the latter bleeding seriously from the hand, and the knife with which she had stabbed at him being found 'lung upon a shelf. Statham, the constable, deposed to the prisoner using the most horrible language, swAearing that she would have the boy's life, and he describd her as, in his opinion, ene of the very Aworst women to be found in the whole world. The prisoner denied that she had so assailed the boy, and said that he had injured his hand with the bolt of the shutter * but . D EyxcougT sentenced her to three months' hard labour, and, in addition, ordered her to flied bail for a similar term at the expiration of the first. TnAmos.-Mharia Chandler, aged 11, was brought up on remand before Mr. YAnDLEY, charged with committing numerous robberies in the shops of tradesmen in Highstreet, Shadweil, Ratcliff-highway, and other places; and Charlotte Chandler, her mother, aged 35, was charged with receiving a portion of the property, well knowing it to be stolen. Mr. YARDI,Y said, it was perfectly shocking to hear such a case. A girl of tender tears had been comnuitting numerous robberies, and her mother was charged as a receiver. He should not adjudicate on the case, but send it before a jury for trial, with liberty for the mother to put in sureties for her appearance at the sessions. The evidenco against the mother was that she first denied the possession of the stolen property afterwards found in her room. If the mother knew the character of the girl that told very much against her.

THB PUBLIU Jr.A9tPl. (From the registra=-eneral's WeAldy Io;itort.) The mortality of tho metropolitan distriots exhibits Rn inorease. The deaths rogistered in London wero in two pro ceding weeks 988 and 1,061t; in tlto week that etdoll oi Satudrday, July 25, they roso to 1,20'9. In tho ton yoer 1847-56 the average number of deaths in tlo wookl ceorro sponding with last week was 1,102, buti tho deatlhs of last week occurred in an increased population, and for tho pur. pose of comparison the average must be ratsod in proportion to the increase, by which it will become 1,212. Tho rato of mortality now provaiLng Is theroforo as h4;b aS the average rate, although the period* from whioh tho latter is derived includes the last week of July in 184D, whon epi demic cholera had spread to a considerable extont, and wa fatal in 783 cases. In the last two weeks the meanL temperature of the air has been 68 deg., and on seven out of the 14 days the thermometer has risen above 84 deg. In London diarrhoea, or the complaiut now known a3 " the aummer cholera," is the zesult of a high temperature, and, as tho heat is greater than usual, the disease has developed itself with more than its usual vigour. The following numbers of deaths from diarrhoea exhibit its progress during the present month; in the week that ended July the 4th they were 65, in the two following weeks 133 and 160, and last week 259. Last year, in one week, the deaths from diarrhma rose to 253 under a mean temperature of 67 deg., but at a period when the summer was three weeks nmore in advance. In a very large majority of the 259 cases young children are tho victims; 206 occurred in the first year of life, 26 at the age of one year and less than two, 1 at ages varying from two years to ten, and 16 at the age of 20 and upwards. Besides these 28 cases are referred to cholera (comprising deaths by E1 English cholera," " choleraic diarrhca," &o.), and under this head also a large proportion-viz., 23-occurred to children. In all fatal cases of cholera it is desirable that the duration of the previous stage of diarrhcea, when it can be ascertained, should be stated by the medical attendant on his certificate. Typhus and common fever were fatal in 44 cases, moasles In 40; whooping cough is now reduced to 37; and it is satisfactory to find that only 13 are due to scarlatina, and that not a single death from smallpoz is returned. Three persons died from carbuncle; two from intemperance. Five nonagenarians are returned, the oldest of whom was a widow, who died at the age of 96 years. Last week the births of 779 boys and 852 girls, in all 1,631 children, were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,430. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean heighb of the barometer in the week was 29828 inches. The mean temperature of the week was 68-3 deg., which is 67 deg. above the average of the same week in 43 year On Thursday and Friday the mean temperature was 71 deg., which is more than 9 deg. above the average. The highest temperature in the week was 86 deg. on Thursday in the shade; and the highest point in the sun (110 deg.) was attained on the same day. The lowest was 511 deg. on Tuesday. The range of the week was 34 3 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 57-1 deg., and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air (representing the dryness) is so great as 11-2 deg. The mean temperature of the water of the Thames was 69 5. The direction of the wind was generally south-west. It blow strong on the last three days. There ws no rain, except some In driving showers on the evening of Tuesday.
TO THE EDITOR OF T2,H TIMES. Sir,-As there is still hope that Lord Cam pbell's Bil for the Suppression of Obscene Prints and Publications may yet be discussed in the House of Commons during the present session you may perhaps think it worth while to give pub. licity to the following fact, which strongly proves the necessity that exists for such a measure:-There caine, some months ago, to the ship of which I am chaplain, a letter addressed "To the Senior M1dshi man of Her Majesty's ship -." The officer bearing tfat rank discovered on opening it that it contained a list of prints and books of the most abominable character, with detailed descriptions so disgusting that I should hope their revolting nature would in most cases defeat the objeot of the publishers. The young gentleman who received the letter handed it to me in order that I might take measures to have the offender brought to justicei and I enclosed the envelope with its contents to Sir Peter ]aurie, in the hope that he would take the matter up and have the publisher punished as he deserved but as £ have not heard anything farther on the subject i conclude that my communication failed to reach that magistrate, I have not heard whether similar letters were received in other ships in Her Majesty's service, but, as the onewhich I describe appeared to be a circnlar, I have little doubt but that the ocers oE otherships have been insulted in the same manner as the young gentleman vwho handed that letter to me. The statement of this fact should enlist as strennous sup. porters of the BiU all who have at heart the interests of Her Eaiestv's PFavy. T ALm qir A 2TAVAL OC&PLAIbT.

Sir,-In reference to some remarks in lThi Times of .Saturday on tho Declaration of the Clergy on Mrriago and Divorce, permit me respectfully to observe that the DecLs. ration does not say that marriage is indi&oluble, but only expresses the desire of those who sign it that facilities unauthorized by Holy Scripture and the Church may not be given to divorce, Requesting the favour of an insertion of this correCtion in your next ntumber. I am. Sir. your obedient ,evP.t4 J. EDWAD VAUX 3eCrA tArvv thn l;.I,. l P.S. The signattxes to the Dec1aration have reached this monming upwards of 7,000. 46, Vincont-square, S.W,, July 27. THE REPRMIVED CoEv14r.-It has already been stated in T7he Eimu that the sentence of death passed on Sarah Jamieson at the late Yyrk assizes for the murder of her infant child, whose remains were found in a mautlated state In various places, has been commuted to penal servitude for life. After her conviction she was visited by a clergy. man residing in the neighbourhood of her late residence, who in a letter to a friend says,-" Nothing will ever zemove the impression which the interview I had with her made upon my mind-vnz., that she did not murder her child, aid not mangle and dissever its limbs, or in any way. hurt or injure herchild. Her crime was leaving it on the moor, whether with the hope that it might perish, or under the expectation that some one might possibly find and pro. vide for it, that God alone knowvs. '
MIM0IIL OF THE LA-TE M-. MAItCY.-Wi HaM 1.. laroy was born at Sturbridge, Worcester coanty, ltiihsalinnettso December 12, 1786. His parents were in eomforetblo ilroumstatces and gave him a good education, whlilh was completed *A Boston university, whence he graduated with honour In 1808. He soon after settled in 'roay as a lawyer but devoted bimsef mainly to politics which wore then einning to be of absorbing interest. In. bued with the political faith of Jefferson he ardently sup. ported the pollcy of which President Madison and Governor Tompkins were the leading exponents. He ardently supported tho declratiQn of war against Great Britain, volun. teered to serve in said war, and is said to have captured a British flag in some skirmisi on our northern frortier. We believe, however, that his services in council were deemed more valuable than any he could render in the field. pn 1816 ho was appointed Recorder of the city of Troy, hut Identifying himself with the "Backtil" opposition to Governor Clinton be was removed in 1818. In 1821 the Bucktails acceded to power on the election of Governor Yates, and made Mr. llarcy Adjxtant-General, from which post he was transferred to the more responsible one of Controller in 1823. He thereupon removed from Troy to Albany, which city he has ever since considered his home. He soon became a member of the famed "Albany Regency," an association of able and energetic politicians; by whom the politics of our State were raainly directed for a number of years. In 1829 he was appointed a justice of our Supreme Court, and in 1831 transferred thence to the United States' Senate, wherein he served with distinction until the close of 1832, when he was elected Governor over Francis Granger, at the same time that General Jackson was rechosen to the Presidency. In 1834 his re-election for Governor was opposed by William H. Seward, but be was ro-elected, as he been first chosen, by about 12,000 majority. Inl186eowasopposed byJesseBael, whom he beat by near 30,000 mjority. In 1838 he was supoorted for the fourth and last time, but was for u second time opposed by W. iH. Seward, who was now elected by over 1, 000 majority, after a most spirited contest. The election now turned on the financial policy which had culminated in the specie circular, sub- , and intro- duction of small bills; and we believe there is no dispute as to the fact that Governor Marcy, while he had heartilv co-operated in the war on the United Sttes' Bank wul1d have chosen to stand aloof from these measures o'f qjuc hostility to the State banls EHe has not since been a candidate for popular election. Governor Marcy returned to 'fflce in 1845, on the acession of President Polk, who appointed him Secretary of War. Webelieve it to be genezally conceded that he discharged the duties of this Imp rtant post with energy and marked ability, and that he Bignally contributed therein to the genera vigour and snccess of the war on Mexico, He retired, of courso with bis superior, on the accession of General Taylor to the Presidency. He had supported General Cass for President in 1848, without sundering his personal relations with the an Burens1 , Cambreling, Dix, and other leaders of the Fiee-soil Democracy, and he became an early and efficient negotiator for that re-union of the party which was so completely consummated in the contest of 1852. General Pierce, on assuming the Presidency, offered him the portfolio of the Stato Department, which he accepted, though his tastes and pursuits had hitherto led him away from the field of foreign politics. Probably no greener Secretary of State ever entered upon the dutiesof that postgret few or none everfilled it more effectively Several of Ins State papers willIong be treasured and adZired, and he may be said to have reflected honour even on thfo administration of General Pierce-an achievement to which few men would have proved equaL That he was its good genius was very generally realied. That he never approved nor countenanced the violation of the Missouri Compact is beyond doWbt; and this is all the foundation there ever was for the Southern report that he was about to join the "Black Republicans." wad he yielded to his natural impulses in 1854, resigned his seat in theCabinet, and placed himself at the headl f the opposition to Douglas's nTebraska oy he might, perha * have diedPresidentof the United tate G But Govemor Marcy was trained in that mistaken political school which holds it better to be wrong in the Democratic p rty than right out of it, and he lived and died in conformity with th4 error.

Both persons are of advanced xge, and had been in the habit of joking and " chaffing" each other about their martial experience. OD Thursday they met at a publichouse in Pezahore, when the disputes between them were renewed; and, although several men interfered, the vords led to blows until a regular fight took place between the two. Checketts struck Johnson a violent blow on the side of the head, knocking him down upon a stone foor. He became insensible, and died on Sunday from effusion of blood on tbe brain. At the coroner's inquest a verdict of 3Manslaughter" against Checketts was returned.
