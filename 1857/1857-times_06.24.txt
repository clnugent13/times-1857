.EDUCATIONAL CONFBRENOE. Yesterday morning the members assisting at ther im. portant conforences met to pursue their inquiries and discassions at the Thatched House Tavern, St. James's. On this occasion there was no general meeting of the vhole body, as the object of the day's proccedings ws to hear papers read on the causes which impeded the general pro. grees of education, the state of education abroad, &o., and to encourage a discussion of the various suggestions to which they gave rise. This business was therefore distributed among fivo sections, 'which met in different rooms, and were presided over by different chairmen. The deeision and resolution at which each section has arrived will be promulgated at the final general meeting at WillWs's Rooms to-morrow (this day), All the rooms in which tho sectional meetings were hold wore much crowded throughout the day, the great majority of the audience in most cases being clergymen connected with schools for the children of the 'working classes in all parts of the country. In SBErioN A the Bishop of Oxford presided, except during a brief Interval, when he was compelled to attend at Her Majesty's Drawing Room, when tho Bishop of Durham filled the chair till his return. In addition to these right rev. prelates, there were also present Lord Kinnaird, Sir Harry Verney, M.P., Mr. Hadfield, M.P., Mr. E. Miall, &c. The first paper read was one by the Rev. Mr. Mitchell. one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools, " On the evidence afforded by the reports of Her Majesty's inspectors as to the early age at which children are taken away from school," mnd which stated that 66 per cent. of the children of the -working classes remained beyond their tenth year at school, but only 6 per cent. compleced their 14th year there. Ten years, however, formed the usual age at which the children quitted. A direct compulsory system of education was not to be thought of, but the indirect compulsion of inducement might be used with propriety and great effect by the Government holding out the reward of subordinate positions to such only as were educated. Immense progress in edu.| cation had been made of late yearsby the worldng olases, v «one could go among them without feeling this-thene was less drunkenness and less profanity and blasphemy -less instances of misconduct in the parks which they frequented. That 'was proved by the fact that among the visitors to Hampton Court last year, of the 17taken Into custody eight belonged to the upper classes, and the two punished for drunkenness were gentlemen, or at least esquires. Tho second paper 'was by Mr. Flint on the same subject, with special reference to schools not under Government inspection, and which entered into elaborateI statisticn as to the ages when the children quitted school in all pats of Bngland, and even in different parts of the same county. The paper forcibly illustrated the truth of the assertion that the withdrawal of children fromu school did not depend upon the poverty of the parents, but npon the general demand which existed in the neighbourhood for children's labour, which led the employer to say that, if the child's service were not given, those of the parent would be dispensed with. The Factory Act prevented the employment of children in collieries under the age of 10 years, but its clauses did not apply to working the ironstone mines, where children were employed irom the most tender age, on the ground, as masters alleged, that labour required its apprenticeship as well an any other trade, and that the child that was not put to work early would never become a good daily labourer, A third brief paper on the same subject, especially with reference to lengthening the term of education, by Mr. Baines, was then read, after which the sections proceeded to discuss the questions raised. The Bishop of DURRA31 and the Rev. Mr. BuRGESs csmmenced the discussion, and suggested that some legal enactment, like the Factory Act, which prevented children being put to work too young, should also prevent their being removed from school ore their education was fairly completed. The Bishop of OxrotD thought that if any compulsory system of education was adopted it must be supported by a general rate, and therefore be under the control of the ratepayer. Several other speakers took past in the discussion, some advocating the necessity for legal enactments, some maintaining that it should rather be caUed the protection of the law, to save the poor from the compulsion which was often put on them by Diasters and employers and the relieving officers of workhouses. No immediate conclusion was, howv. evcr, come to, and the section after eomo time proceeded wit.h the other papers before it, commencing with that of M1r. W. Fl. Heyett, F.ILS., which entered at length into the statistics of the last census in as fares they bore on the children at school, at work, al d at neither. The next paper was Mr. Goodman's, on the result of returus from Birmingbam, showing the degree in 'which labour mnd idleness respectively interfere with education, 'which pointed out with much clearness the causes which led to the demand for children's labour, and the various reasons which induced the parents to prefer the factory to the schooL A brief paper on the same subject by the Rev. S. Earnshaw, of Sheffield, having also been read, the discussion was resumed, many of the speakers being in favour of some species of Legislative compulsion, in order to the proper education of the children of the working classes-au Act to operate in the same manner as the Factory Act. Canon Burgess, however, contended against the compulsory system with force and olearness. His opinions seemed to be shared by a majority of the meeting, and a resolution in favour of his views was eventually come to. SE(sTioN B. The business appointed for consideration by this section, presided over by the Right Hon. W. Cowprt, LP., 'was the inquiry into the circumstances attending the romoval of children froin the schools in continental countries, with a view to seeing how far that removal toek place at a later or an earlier age as compared with the same event in these countries. The proceedings were opened by Mr. Joseph Kay, who, in a paper of great research and ability, took a sketch cf the rapid increase of population in the manufaoturing districts in Lancashire. showing that ft had far outgrowvnthe ordinary means of education; the consequence of which was that the children of the working classes were aUowed to remain, not only in a filthy and squalid state as regarded their physical condition, but socially were trained up in habits of vice and crime, as the large number of con victions of children of this class fully showed. In Swvitzerland, in Holland, Denmark, and throughout nearly the whole of Germany, all the children between the ages of five and 15 years were compelled to attendachool, and were thus saved from the moral and physical evils arising from the 'want of a proper system of supervision. Their dressin school was clean and orderly, their playgrounds dry and spacious, and they were made to appear in clean dress, and were supplied with books and other educational apparatus. In Switzerland there was, for the sake of better classification, in each school-house about 10 school-rooms. 1 these schools the children of all classes in the com'tunity began their education, and the child of the professional man-nay, of the nobleman-sat upon the same bench with the child of the day-labourer. It was calculated that one-fourth the whole population of Switzerland, one-sixth the population of Prussia, and one-eighth of that of Holand were attending the national schools. If in these schools they were only to learn to read and write there was still a great rorel advantage flowing from such a system of training and association. If the parent was not able to provide suitable clothing, and pay for the education of his children at these schools, the cost was defrayed by a parochial rate, And care was taken that the children should not be taken away at a too early age. In Holland no person was relieved out of the poor-rates who did not send his children to schooL In each parish a school committee levied a local rate, out of which they built and kept in repair school-houses andteaehers'residences, paid the salaries of the teachers themselves, provided books and other educational apparatus, including a good dry playground, and secured a proper system of school inspection. They also bore the expense of the clothing and edueation of those children whose parents were not in a position to do so -Te next paper read was one by Md. Bug6ne Iendo, of the Ministry of Instruction in France, upon tho esytem of the primary schools and industrial training. The evil of an early removal of the children from schools was, it stated, severely felt in France, and was attributable to the vague and uncertain character of the teaching, inasmuch as it was not shown to them to have much connexion with the interests of the trades they were about to engage in, anDd neither the children themselves nor their parents were convinced of its practical utility. The R1ev. Mr. Glennie next read a paper from the Rev. Dr. Matter, of Strnabourg, formerly inspector of schools underthe Government of Louis Philippe. The early removal of children from school prevailed, he said, less in the mining than in the agricultural and manufacturing districts of France, and was to be attributed to the poverty of the people, a desire to add to their luxuries, a natural love of dissipation, the demand for labour in the manufactories, and the insufiiciency of Government interference. The evilsarising from these circumstances vere the counteracting of all ambition on the the part of the people to rise above their position, an ignorance of religion and sound moral training, the demoralization of entire distrioc and the impoverishment of the physical constitution of the people. The remedy for them consisted in the enforcement of tho factory lavw of 1841, the granting of certificates of proper training and a good scheme of prizes, and the adoption of the half-timo system. The last was on tho state of education in Germany by Captain Boscawen Ibbeteon. Jt Pmsi,umed that the systemn there in vogue was pelfect, and attributed such perfection to the liberality of tbo Government and of the municipal bodies, to the cartainty of employment which those who proved their attaIn|ments by a public examination enjoyed, to tho gradation of cohools, to the mingling of amnusement with study, and to a propor ysytem of school inspection. From the conversation which followed those papers it appeared that from the cir cumstance of education being on the continent compulsory the stroets of the great towns were completely free of vagrants ; that the females were in Prussia, except in the Roman Catholic districts, where the sisters of charity took charge of, trained in the some schools with the males with. out any injury to their morals, and that the sumerior class of education which they received did not disqualify them for performing the duties of thier several stations in life. SECTioN C. The chair in this section was taken by Sir J. K. Shuttle worth, supported by the Rev. Canon Moseley, Canon Mel. ville, Lord Kinnaird, Sir John Palington, &c. The Rev. J. P. NoRBis, one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools, read the first paper-" On the working of the Staffordshire certificate and registration scheme, andon the best method for its extension to alL" In these schools certificatea of attendance at school were required until the children had received a certain amount of education, and efforta weremade with employers to take those children into employ with such certificates, in preferenee to those not possessing them. In 13 months 1,500 children had been registered, and many employers took these certificates as a recommendation to employment. The attendance required at school was two years regularly subsequently to the ninth birthday. No hostility had been shown to the scheme, and the parents set the greatest value on the certificates. Out of the 1,500 children 540 had received their second half-yearly dertiSicate, and 157 had applied for their third certificates. He would recommend the formation of a central board in London, In conjunction with whom local committees could be formed, end thus extend the system throughout the kingdom. The essential distinction between this and the prize scheme was that the latter looked to an intellecttl test, while this senome did not, but showed that the children had regularly attended schooL The Rev.W. J. KIEDmy, one of Her Majeaty'sInspectors of Schools "on the principles to be observed in promoting school attendance," after alluding to the causes for irregular attendance at school, which he considered to be the indifference of parents, the poverty of parents, and the demand for juvenile labour, he came to the proposals for their remedy, which, he thought, was to be found in some degree iu Mr. Tremenheere's plan for voluntary association of theeducated classes for examination of the children of the poor, with prizes and certificates. Though this might do for a time, he was afraid it would not last, as it was difficult to keep voluntary associations together for any length of time. Voluntary educational efforts had neverflourished; all such educational bodies, including dlocesan boards, training schools, and the National Association, were allowed to languish for want of funds. He was fearful of the success of prize schemes. He therefore recommended that such schemes should not be started on any grand scale. Let them be established on rather a contracted basis; and if they were good they would grow. As regarded the certificate scheme, he did not think they could give general education certificates of value; and the small capitalists would not fetter themselves in their engagements of labour, their object being rather to get cheap than educated labour. Besides, many children would be excluded from the certificates, the parents being too poor to pay the fees for tbeir children attending schools; and it would be unjust to deprive such children of the chances of employment. He was altogether opposed to compulsory education; and if they in any way interfered with the labour-market it was impossible to say how much they would disarrange the manufacturing interests of the kingdom. He proposed that the country should be marked out into districts; that an officer should be appointed in every district to employ himself in endeavouring to get the children to attend the schools, with power to pay the fees where necessary. A voluntary association had been at work at Manchester carrying out this object with great success-3,000 additional children attending the sohools, and 1,2001 per annum added by the fees to the income of those schools. Fearing the permanency, however, of any voluntary association, he thought such a scheme might be carried out by a permanent body. Papers on similar subjects having also been read by the Rev. NAsH SETEPnE?NsoN, of Birmingham, Mr. S. TnxBxNXEERE, and Mr. T. HAle, the whole subject was discussed at length, and eventually a resolution was carried to be laid before the final meeting, to the effect that the certificate and prize schemes were worthy of more extended trial but that such a plan should be only regarded as subsidiary to other agencies for acting upon the irregularity and insufficiency of the time of school attendance. SECroN D. In this section, which was presided over by the Very Rev. IL P. Hamilton, M.A, F.LS., Dean of Salisbury, Mr. Alexander RmoPRAvz, Inspector of Factories, read a paper " on the operation of the half-time system in factories." Subsequently, the Rev. C. EH BROMBY, of the Cheltenham Training School, delivered an address " on voluntary halftime schemes." The next paper was read by the Rev. P. MArRS}rAL, of lulme, and was upon " Factory education, v ith suggestions forimprovement." The deficiencies in factory education arose (he said) from the new social phenomena which have been developed in the growth of our manufacturing population. The early factory Acts implied domestic and parochial influencesupon the young factory " hands." The increase firat of numbers in the factory, aud second of the population in our towns, has destroyed the former influence, and very much weakened the latter ; and not merely has it destroyed the influence of a quasi-domestio tie between the employer and the " apprentice," it has, further, by rendering the child independent at an early age, loosened the sacred influence of its natural home. Improvement must be sought, therefore, by other influence, correspondent to the parochial and domestic ties which have been weakened or lost. These remarks applied not so much to children while at school as to the time between youth and manhood, the most important period of education, and one for which the Universities are supposed to provide in other ranks of life. A system of morning and evening schools in which the teachers should be those employed in the factory might prove a remedy for this; these teachers to be elected, examined, and paid somewhat on the present system of " pupil teachers." Mr. E. CHADWICK, giving the results of his experienoe as a member of the Factory Commission, moved a rolution which was seconded by Mr. AiOYD, .P.,- "4 That, in the opinion of this section, the careful examination of the results of instruction in good half-time schools, as compared with the results of instruction for the ordinary full time in the same or the like schools, is fraught with most important conclusions, affecting the whole scheme of education for the labouring classes." Mr. AxRoYD, M.P., gave an interesting account of his own sohools at Halifax. He wanted to compcl factory employers to receive no one into their works without a certificate of his education. In the school, at Haley Hill there were-in the infants' school, 385, 256 in the boys', and 254 in the girls' school; students of the Working Men's College (five evenings a-week), 160; young men under instruction three evenings a-week, 159. At Copley there were 600 in the schools, making a total of 1,805 belonging to the establishment. Mr. J. T. BUNCE read a paper on " feeding and evening schools." He expressed doubts whether the Factory Acts were applicable to the whole kingdom, and thought " halftime" schemes were desirable ; he doubted the possibility of establishing them, unless in exceptional cases. He recommended the extension of schools in which food sbould be given to the children, and work received from them in return; and he cited the instance of such a school suocessfully carried on in Birmingham. As regarded evening schools, he suggested that they would be successful if conducted by certificated masters, paid by Government grants: and if the nature of the instruction was specialy adapted to the trading requirements of the districts in which they were founded. Finally, he pointed out the necessity for combining amusement with instruction in evening schools. Mr. I. F. WINFML, of Birmingham, then read a paper upon " the importance of factory schools, and of evening factory schools especiaUy," as a, remedy for the evils existing in the hardware districts fro-m the too early employment of children. He stated the objections existing at present to a limitation of age, below whiclr they could not be employed. The earnings of children tended Tery ;aterially to swel the family fund, without which parents earning small wages could not support their families, and masters (as hardware manufacturers are now constituted) must not only give the time in the day time for the education of their children, but suffer the more serious loss resulting from change of hands. He stated from experience that evening schools connected with places of worship were inefficient, because the attendance was not compulsory nor were the teachers paid. He cited the case of the schools connected with the works belonging to his father and bimself in Birmingham. Between 200 and 300 children there had a free, good, practicaleducation. Every boy under 18 who entered the works must attend the sehool; but this rule, though necessary at the first establIshment of the school, was not so now, for when boys were not at work they voluntarily came to the evening school. Great good had resulted from this school in the improved conduct of the boys, and gratitude of the people. With this paper, which was much applauded by the coml piwy, the reading of papers terminated. .&W a very long discussion, the resolutions to be submittad o Ahe general mecting, sugge5ting remedies for the evils Pointed out in the various papers, were eventually cried, and the proceedings were adjourned till this day. SZCrreN B. This Was a supplemental section, formed after the meeting of Monday, to disoose of the surplus papers which it was found impossibloe for the other sections to consider In the time allotted for their sittings. The chair was taken by the Very Rev. the Dean of BristoL The first paper read was "On Juvenile Delinquenoy in its Relation to Ignoranoe," by MisB Carpenter. It commenced by remarking uPon the evil inflaence exercised by the juvenile delinquent class upon the morais of the youth with whom they camo in contact, :to which evil influences, acting upon ignorant minds, it -traced the greater portion of the itvenile crime of England, and then went into a lengthened series of statistics, founded apon the report of the police of Liverpool, which showed that a very small percentage of the persons who were accused of crimes had any education deserving of the name. It also stated that the generally recived statement of the number of juvenile cri. inrls in England wan very much overrated, because it did not take cognizance of the very large numbor of those who had been convicted several times in one year, and, who therefore appeared several times on the list. According to the experience of the Parkhurst efornmatory, those who entered the institution with any education gqnerally belonged to the middle classes, aud had evidently been dragged doivn by the force of evil comPanionship or example, and had not originated' or suggested the crimea for which they were punished. A vast number of those who were under training in reform. atories professed to have been at school forvaryingperiods, Eome long and some short, but at the samme time they were found utterly deficient, even in the most common rudiments of knowledge. In concluding, the paper pointed to the great good which had been effected by the ragged schools, by iving thechildren moral and industrious habits, as welL as Intellectual culture, and recommended that, in consideration of the manifest benefit that was cohtinually accruing from them, they were deserving of Government aid more than any other description of schools towhich assistance was nowgranted; nd that the inadaptibility of the votes of the Committee of Council on Education to the ragged schools ought to be taken into the most serious consideration of the conference. After the reading a lengthened discussion followed a'pon the genuineness o the statistics contained in the paper, and a resolution was eventually passed, calling the attention of the conference to the recommendation relative to raggead schools. The second paper vras by lMr. J. Symons, one of Hier Majesty's Inspectors of Schools,1" On IndustrialTraining, as aaadjunct to school teaching." Mr. Symons stated thatthe average time ocoupied in te education of the middle and upper classes was about six years, while in the lower classes it seldom exceeded three or four; consequently, the greatest advantage ought to be taken of that short period during vwhich the children were under their care, and the best instruction, both in quantity and kind, provided for them. According to lis ownr experience, however, such was not always the case. With the quantity of instruotion given he did not find fault, but the kind was, in many instrnceg, useless and abortive in its results. Children, for instafce" were taught the weight of Goliah's spear and the dimensions of the ark, end yet could not tell the chief mineral or agriCultural products of their own country. After nine years' experience of industrial schools, he could, on the contrary give his most unqualified testimony in their favour. Though In many instauces half the day was occupied in field labour, yet the progress made during the other half by the pupils was sucn as was seldom witnessed in a national school where all the day was devoted to study. The industrial schools, also, if more extended, would in some measure tend to remove the grejudice of parents against sending the children to school, by showing them that the knowledge they were acquiring was not merely theoretical, but of practical benefit.r" After some shortdiscussion upon the topics of the paper, a resolution was founded on its recommendation, which was carried -in due form. Tho thirdpaper wasbytheRev. Mr.GIBDLESTONE,-"Wtill an improvement in the dwellings of the labouring classes have any influence on the value which they attach to the education of their children, and can any use be made of the electoral franchise in the samo direction?' He said that in estimating the progress they had made in education it was necessary for them to distinguish between school-rooms and schools. The former was like a clock case without its works. They had school-houses enough throughout the country, but the scholars and the internal arrangements were often wanting. From his own experience, he had known that where the dwellings. of the parents were of a clean and orderly description, there was nearly always a desire to send their children to school. With regard to the influence of education on the franchise, the rev. gentleman threw out a number of suggestions re;-. tive to the expediency of conferring the right of voting Upon those W1e pOc'essd a certificate of education, and those votes should outnumber the legitimate influence of property qualification. ae suggested that schoolmasters and those possessing the certificate qualification alluded to, should be formed into collegiate bodies, returning a certain number of members to the Lower House. The two remaining papers were read, one by Mr. W. L. Sargent, on the proposed middle-class examinations as a means of stimulating the education of the lower clases; and the other by the Rov. H. G. Robinson, of the Traini.g. school, York, entitled, " Suggestions of plans for retaining chldre- At school till . mror. advaoed age," which ltter proposed that the Committee of Council should establish a member of distinction, both honorary and substantial, as well as exhibitors, to give the poorer class a fair chance of obtaining a good situation by industry and application. The section, having concluded its business, proceeded to the consideration of its report to the meeting this day.
A NBW PAR[C. TO THE EDITOR OF THE[ TIMES. Sir,-The House of Commons has this afternoon done much to simplify the question of parks for the metropolis. It had been supposed that the funds for the purchase of Hampstead-heath, Fisburypark, and Rotherithe-park were to be drawn partly from the Treasury asd partly from the rates levied by the Metropolitan Board. By its vote this afternoon, in a very large House, it has been made clear that the House of Commons will refuse to provide any part of the funds out of the general revenues of the country, and will throw the whole burd,qn on the metropolis itself. The Board of Works must now, therefore, take up the question " pure and simple," as the phrase is. By the Act of last year the Legislature threw the duty of providing " parks and open spaces" upon the Metropolitan Board. By its present vote it has also cast upon that Board the task of providing the whole of the funds. The question now is whether the Board wil have courage enough to address itself to this duty. The parks required are-1, Fiasbury; 2, Rotherhithe; 3, Hampstead-heath. The cost of the whole will be about 400,0001 A rate of Id. in the pound on the whole metropolis will discharge the whole amount in less than ten years. If the money were borrowed, and the debt spread over a larger period, the rate niight be reduced to a farthing per annum. The Metropolitan Board must now show whether it possesses any moral fitness for the duties cast upon it. The city of New York is now providing itself with a new park of 750 acres, atacost of $10,000,000. Will London, with four times the population of New York, shrink back alarmed at the thought of an expenditure of as many shilings? I am, Sir, yours, &c.. A S&!FMRW.RI OlR T'1. 1DrAD June 23.
THE MIDDLE CLASS EXAMINATIONS TO TRE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-Your correspondent from Cambridge, who signs himsef "A Fellow of a College," and whose letter appears in your paper of this morning, has approached a subject which seems to be regarded as asnimportant by the graduates of the sister University, but which really involves the first principles of our academical constitution. If schools, or municipal bodies, or, in fact, any communities in England, wish the Universities formally to undertake the examination of boys, and to grant them certificates for a certain amount of proficiency, I can see nothing in the execution of such a plan that is disadvantageous in itself or inconsistent with the character and functions of Oxford and Cambridge. But it does appear to me preposterous that we should be called upon to bestow titles on mere boys, who are not connected with either University, and have not completed any course of study, which is proper to such a corporation as Cambridge or Oxford; and, of all titles, that of "associaWt appears to me most unsuitable. It is Already applied to the probationary members of the Royal Academy -to those who, being of a certain standing, have exhibited pictures along with tSe Academicians, and whom, therefore, it admits to a sort of baccalaureate. But, as your correspondent observns, the boys to be examined ac. cording to the proposd plan are not associated with us, and it does not at all follow that they will ulti. mately become members of either University. I would therefore suggest that the Universities ahoul d confer no titles upon these candidates from the middle-class schools, not even that of " literate," for we do not bestow this de. signation on our own undergraduates, though they pass more than one University examination before they proceed- to their first degree ; but that a certificate without a title should be granted to any one who is able to meet the proposed test, and that such a certificate, or, if necessary, two such certificates, should enable a student to be matriculated at either University without any further examination. By such an arrangement we should not only glve due encouragement, or correction, to the middle-class schools, but we should pave the way for the establisbment of a University matriculation test, which is the great desideratum both at Oxford and Cambridge; whereas, by conferring the title of " associate" or " literate," we should authorize a host ot half-educated striplings to take the name of one of ourgrest seats of learning-very much in vain.

THE INDIAN ARMY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have read with the deepest attention your reports on the recent debates in Parliament connected with India, its native troops and missionaries ;.and, as one gravely concernea in the final isAue, I beg the favour of a place in your columns for a few words in reference to the present state of affairs in Bengal. I must commence by stating prominently that if the recommendation addressed by me under the authority of the then Commander in 6hief to the Government of India in 1853, had not been most culpably disregarded, the existing disaffection among the native troops would never have arsen-not, at leastI as connected with the greasing of cartridges -for in that year, when some rifle ammunition was sent out to India from this country, and certain experiments in connexion with it wereordered, occasion wastaken in my office urgently to recommend to the Government that "in the greasing composition nothing should be used which could possibly offend the caste or religious. prejudices of the natives I" That recommendation was addressed under my signature as Adjutant-General to the Military. Secretary of the Government; it must obviously have been entirely disregarded ! I do not presume to say with whom specifically the blame of this most cuipable. neglect may rest,-only investigation can settle that point,-but I conceive that either the Military Secretary or the officer presiding in chief over the Ordnance Department in Calcutta is, one or both, the party implicated. As far as I can learn with accurasy at this distance, the ferment existing arose, first, from the glaring error of greasing cartridges in the Calcutta arsenal, after the English receipt, with tallow; and, secondly, in issuing to the native troops similarly greased cartridges, sent out direet from England, hat. which ought, of course, only to have been issued -to the European troops. It appears truly wonderful that it should not have occurred to any of the authorities in Calcutta charged with the issaing of these cartridges that tallow made of the fat of al kinds of animals, a filthy composition at the best, would seriously outrage the feelings and prejudices of all the native troops, whether Moslems or Hindoos. My humble opinion is that the Government of India should have insisted on learning with whom rested the blame of the grave errors committed. And the facts of the case having been ascertained, a frank explanation should have been issued for the informa tionof the native troops; by such a course the European officers would have been armed with a truthful and candid explanation, whereas now, in fact, the officers themselves do not in general know exactly how or in what manner the greasing process originated. It is not, perhaps, yet too late to communicate beneficially with the Government of India upon these points. A search in the M ilitary Secretary's office will, without doubt, bring to light the neglected recommendation of the late Commanderin-Chief to the effec above stated. And now for a few words generally on the subject of the disaffection of the native army. A regiment has been disbanded; a "1 jemadar "-that is, a native subaltern officer-of the 34th Native Infantry has been hung; another native officer of long standing, -of the 70th Native Infantry, has been dismissed; two sepoys of the 2d Grenadier Regiment have been condemned to imprisonment for 14 years, and yet, with all these examples of the punishment awarded to the mutinous and disaflected, little effect appears to have been produced. The Sd Cavalry refuse to obey orders; the recruits of the artillery at Meerut have been summarily dismissed for the same offence, and other instances abound; Government paper is reported to have been offered for sale in Oude at 30 per cent. discount; the burning of barracks and of the houses of the European officers at Meerut and Umballah still continues, and everything goes to prove that disaffection still pervades the army generally, participated in by the doo community at large. The cause of all this is not alone to be looked for inthe grave mistake which has been fallen into by the Calcutta functionaries concerned in the issuing of the cartridges. Many causes have combined, not the least of which is the obstinate perseverance displayed in withdrawing from regiments, for civil employ, so many valuable officers, and in posting to the command of divisions, brigades, and regiments worn-out or otherwise incompetent men-Queen's as well as Company's ;-combined evils which will yet result, I fear, in the committal of many more heinouscrimes and offences againstdiscipline; for the curtain bas not yet dropped upon the sad performances now being enacted. True wisdom consists, I conceive, not in ignoring or underrating danger, but in foreseeing and meeting it with courage and firmness. How far the knowledge and experience of the officer now at the bead of the army in India is equal to an emergency it is not for me to judge, but I will say that the crisis is a very grave one, that what may come to pass should be looked to, and that measures should be taken to replace General Anson, if ill-health or other cause should remove him from the very responsible post he occupies. If a successor is to be sought General Grant is at hand, commanding the Madms Presidency, and a thorough knowledge of the feelings of the sepoys in Bengal, acquired during a routine of 32 years' service, enables me confidently to say that the presence of this justly popular officer at that Presidency as commander in chief would restore immediate confidence among the sepoys, to whom he is well known, and where he is much beloved and respected. Sir, when a great State convulsion is impending it becomes every man individually to offer such counsel as his experience or connexion with the matter in hand may dictate, and upon that principle I have endeavoured to act in thus publicly addressing myself to you, my strenuous advocacy ia anotherymatter with the Hon. Court of Directors (the only one I have made since my retirement from their service) having proved eminently unsuccessful. I am, Sir, your obedient humble gervant- t. T.

Very little is known, generally speang respect i the history of this establishment, though theaT plah ~~~~~~~~~~~ tMa he -opo nmany families resident in Winchester have frequently visited them, and can testify to the amiability and courtesy of their manners, as well as to the eerenity and hanpiness of their pious life. As to the history of the convent, the fol. lowing summary, though somewhat concise, may prove interestug to a porton of ourreaders :-This community was the first monastery of English nuns founded on the continent after the dissolution of the religious houses in England at the Reformation; and at the close of the lat century, 'when the FrenchRevolation compamedthevarionsEoglishreligious establishments existin rance and the Low Countries to seek an a9ylumn and, thi community was the first also that reached our shores, landing at St. Katharine's stairs, London, on the 6th of J,179 In the year 1597, the Right Ron. LadyMaryPercy, daughter of Lord Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland, E.G, escaped, after a long imprisonment, on account of her religion, to Brussels where, with the assistance of theRev-FatherWilliam Hilt of the Society of Jesus, she obtained a brief from Pone Clement VIIL empowering her to found at Brussels the first English Benedictine Convent. Having purchased a houEe, she, -with some other Englsh ladies who desired to embrace a reUlgous state, took possesso of it onl the 11th of July, 1599. By the advice of Father Holt Lady Mary Percy had obtained leave for Dame Joanna Berkieley, (daughter of Sir John Berkeley, of Beverston, in Glocestershire, Ent.), a professed Benedictine of the great abbey of St. Peter's, at Rheims, to come to govern the new monastery, and she was solemnly blessed and inostaled as their Abbess by the Right Hon. and Most Rev. Lord Matbias Van Hon° Archbishop of Mechlin, on the 14th of November, 1899. Eiglit days afterwards she gave the habit to Lady Mary P!ercy and to seven other ladies, among whom were two daughters of Lord Arundel, of Wardour, and also to four lay sisters. This ceremony was honoured with the presence of their Royal Hig'hnesses tbe Archduke Albert and the Archduchess lsabella, Infanta of Spain, and by all the grandees of their court; and a general holyday was observed throughout the city. Their oyal Higlmesses gave a sumptuous dinner to the inmates, and partook of it themselves in the refectory. At the end of 12 months there was another day of great rejoicing tbronghout Brussels, and theirRoyal fighnesses and court again attended the monastery to witness the profession of these ladies, and they gave another noble banquet. To show the spirit of these ladies it may be stated that in the following year, when the Infanta graciously offered to endow the convent with a good annual renta, they, fearing that they might be deprived of the free and entire ltberty of, choosing their own Abbesses, thought it best not to accept the proffered: Royal favour. At the death of Lady Joanna Berkeley, in 1616, the community elected as her successor the Lady Mary Percy, who from that time rled over the monastery for 26 years, she having died on the 16th of September, 1642, In the 74th year of her a..e The community continued to flourish, and so increased in numbers that in 1623 it sent a filiation to Cambray, which is now located at Stanbrook, near Worcester, and in the following year a filiation to Ghent, which cemmunity is now located at Oulton, in Staffordshire. In 1652 the Cambray community sent out a filiation to Paris, and it is now established at Rugeley; andthat of Cbent sent out no fewer than three filatfons, which were severally founded in 1652, 1662, and 1665, at Boulogne, (afterwards removed to Pontois, near Paris) Dunkirk, and Ypres. The last still flourishes at Ypres, and was the only community which remained in the Low Countries at the time of the French Revolution. That of Danldrk (now settled at Hammersmnith) had been therejoined by the Pontois community, who brolke up their own establishment in 1784. It is a practiee with these eommunitiesevery year to comn.unicate with the mother house and pay their respects and reverence. The parent establishment had existed for a period of nearly 200 years, and had numbered among its members many individuals descended from some of the oldest and best of English families, when it was assailed by the votaries of anarchy and infidelity. The pe3ceful inimates were compelled to quit their ancient monastery and seek anewhome. Theyquitted Brussels onthe 22dof June, 1794, assed through Antwerpb and arrived at Rotterdam on the 36th. Tere they emnbarkedl for England on the 2d of July, and landed on the 6th of the same month at St. Katharine's stairs, near the Tower of London, where they were received by their friends, and among others by the Right Rev. Dr. Douglas, the CatholicBischop of the London dise triot, who generously offered them his hor.se at Winchester (the late convent). On teo 9th of July thev left London for WVinchester, and on their arrival they were received by the Rev. Dr. ilner, the wellmknown Winchester historian, who rendered them every aEsistance in his power, and endeavoured to make them as comfortable as circumstanceswould permit, Howevetr they continutd for some years in an unsettled state, expecting to be enabled to return to Brussels and regain possession of their own church and monstery; but every year made it more bopeless, so that at lat they quietly settled down. Yet the smalnems of their grounds was a subject continually regretted; and, as time progressed, the erection of new buildings, which overlooked their premises and encroached upon their privacy, together with the gradual &ymptoms of decay of their house-whicbl was built as fax back as the reign of Charles I.-induced them to tum their attention to the advisability of finding another new and mor6 suitable home Eo, after a few more yesrs had elaSpsed, they suc. ceedea in meettig with an eligble piece of uroperty, with extensive groundsattached,at Est Bergholt, in Suffolk, and enl which stands a large mansion, built about a century since by Sir John Hankey, of which the community have iut takenpossession. Duringthe64yearsoftheirresidenceintin chestcr the above relitious body have buried four Abbesses who governed in sucoessot, and the lady who new- rules over them was dlected in I381 She was solemnly blessed and installed by bis Eminence Cardinal Wiseman, on the 35th of Augost in the same rear, and is the 16th Abbess of their monastery, reckoning from the time of its foundation in the year 1699--H4mpskhijr Ch ronice,
PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOlUSE OF LORDS, TuEsDAY, JuN 23. The LORD ChANCELLOR took his seat on the woolsack at 1 o'clock. The Earl of DUNGANNON presented a petition from Rookhil, in the county of Cork, against the Bill for the abolition of ministers' money. The Earl of SEAFTESBURY presented a petition from tkachers of BetheEda Sunday-school, Leeds, for reaslatio, of beerhouses; also a petition from Poor Law guardians of li-re Union, in Wilts, Dorset, and Somerset, to the same effect; one from the Board of Guardians of East London Union for equalization of poor-rates 7 and orne from certain members oM the United Church of ingland and Ireland at Dingle, against the Muisters' Money Bill. ST. JAMES'S PARKL The Earl of MALMESBURY gave notice that on Monday, the 29th inst., he would call the attention of the House to the correspondence which had taken place between the Treasury and the Board of Worlks in reference to St. James's Park. Lord CAMPBELL presented a petition from several mercantile gentlemen connected vith the colonies, _praying that a writ of error from the decisions of the colonial courts might be allowed to be issued in criminal cases to the Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster. His lordship took occabion to state that he d&d not concur in the prayer of the petition. VEXATIOUS SUITS. Lord BROUGHAM obtained leave to introduce a Bill, similar to that which he had introduced last session and the session before, to prevent vexatious litigation. The Bill was read a first time. The Bishop of OXFORD presented a petition from lay members of the church of England residing at Liverpool against certain provisions of the Divorce Bill; also petitions irom the clergy of the rural deanery of Chipping-Norton, and from the rural deanery of Henley, expressing their alarm at the alterations which the Bill proposed to effect in the law of marriage and divorce; and one from the inhabitants of Whitney against the traffic in opium, as existing between India and China. The Earl of CLANCARTY presented a petition from the board of guardians of a parish in Galway, praying for an inquiryl into the operation of the law of settlement, and complaining of the hardship which was entailed upon Irish paupers under the present eystem of removal. The Earl of ALBEMARLE presented petitions from the civil servants of the Royal Arsenal of Woolwich the mechanical officers of 'Woolwich Dockyard, the ivil servants of the port of Cowes and of the port of Scarborough, against the present system of superannuation allowances. EXPLORATION OF AUSTRALIA. The Duke of NEWCASTLE said that he wished to put a question with regard to the exploration of Central Australia to the noble earl the President of the Council. When he had the honour of holding the office of Secretary fer the Colonies an expedition haa been organized for the purpose of exploring Central Australia, and he had been fortunate enough to secure the services of a gentleman whose experience eminently qualified him for the position, a Mr. Giegory, to undertake the superintendence of the expedition. The subject was one of great public interest, and the question which be wished to put to the noble earl was whether any report had been received by Her Majesty's Government connected with that expedition, and if any had been received whether there would be any objection to lay it upon their lordships' table. Earl GRANVILLE said that a report had been recei-3d by the Government, and that report bore testimony to ths judgment which had been displayed by bis noble friend in the choice of Mr. Gregory to act as head of the exploring party. The result of that expedition had been that fertile .land had been discovered on the confines of Victoria; but the land in the interior of the country was sterile. He agreed with the noble duke that the subject was one upon which the public was entitled to every information which could be afforded, and there was no objection on the part of the Government to furnish all the information which they posseEsed. JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES ACT AMENDMENT BILL. This Bill was read a second time. DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILL. On the motion of the LORD CAOELLOR this Bill wse read a third time. On the question that the Bill do pass, Lord REDESDALE moved an amendment upon clause 3, the effect of which was to take from the new court established by the Bill the power of granting divorce a vlfculo. The court was a new court, and he thought that it would be safer not at once to confide to it powers so extensive. With every inducement to the people to be discontented with the present law no discontent had been felt. Under these circumstances, and seeing that the feeling of the country as expressed in petitions was against this measure and not in its favonr, he should move the omission from the third clause of the words " or divorce." Lord CAMPBELL was surprised to hear the noble lord say that the country had been taken by surprise by this measure. Five long years ago a commission was appointed to inquire into this subject; three Bils had been laid upon their lordships' table, and one had received their assent and been sent down to the other House of Parliament. The noble lord had said that there were few petitions for the Bil, but who was to petition in its favour ? Was it to be the injured husband in contemplation ? The petitions which had been presented against the Bill had proceeded upon misapprehension, not to say misrepresentation. They alleged that this Bill would introduce laxity of proceeding, and would enable every one to obtain a divorce. Practically speaking, this measure would make no alteration in the law; it would only confide its administration to a different tribunal. Hitherto the two Houses of Parliament had decided cases of divorce nominally legislatively, but reaUy judicially; this Bi7l would ereot a judicial tribunal before which such cases could be judicially considered and satisfactorily decided. It was a poor compliment to those who would constitute that court to say that the cases would bedealt 'with in a sloveuly manner and without sufdicient pains being bestowed upon them. The men who were to fill the office of judges in It were wel versed in judicial proceedings; he knew not that any complaint of neglect of their duties had ever been made against them, and it was not likely that they would now forfeit their h gh reputations. The Earl of MALMESBURY did not think that their lordships had yet arrived at a satisfactory solution of the di iculties by which this question was surrounded. It was said that this Bil would remove the hardship to which under the existing law the woman was subjected. But how was that done? Up to the present time the only punishment which a guilty woman received from society was that it turned its back upon her. Under this Bill, however, she was to be brought before a judicial tribunal, and might be condemned to prison like a drunken prostitute or a shoplifter. Nor would this measure put an end to the scandal which was said to attend the existing mode of procedure. The court could not sit with closed doors, and therefore its proceedings, and not only its proceedings, but aiso particulars as to the imprisonment of guilty parties, would be published in the newspanersm Thus, instead of being diminished, the snandal would be increased. It had aiso been urged that the lower classes had no means of obtainig divorces, but no such means were afforded to them by this Bill. A single court sitting in London might be very useful for persons residing in the metropolis, but could confer no benefit on the lower classes who lived at a distance. lis principal objection to the Bil however, was that it made adultery a public crime, instead of a private wrong. Hle felt all the infamy of the action for crim. con., but' the object of that proceeding was, not to remunerate the man but to show that this was a private wrong, and not a public' crime. Some of his right rev, friends had said that adultery was a great sin, and therefore ought to be treated as a public wrong and to be publicly punished. Be knew adultery was a great sin, hut it was impomible to legislate civilly upon the decalogue. We boasted of our religious liberty, and therefore could not legislate upon the firt or second commandments. On the third we had tried to legislate, but had facied. With regard to the fourth, we had met with such difficulties that our legislation was a mass of contradictions, and absurd in the eyes of the public. The public could not interfere with adultery as with theft or murder. They could take no steps forits prevention. How woulda ma betreated who went to a husband and told him that he ought to look sharper after his 'wife tHe (therEarl of Malmesbury) protested, not onlytas a legislator, buLt with all the natural feelings o a gentleman, against the adultery of the woman being consideredw apublicroinme, and against her being dragged before ttte publi and punished by imprisonment. The fact of a woman being treated in that mnanner would prevent men from petitioning the Court. Few would like to see their wives dragged to prison and treated as criminals. He did net go so far as to say that there ought to he no divorce, for it would be very hard that a man should be tied for life to a profligate woman, but a geat mistake had been made by this Bill in the mannler in whi oh it treated the questio, It ws purey a moal quetonaqusinf -would not bear the ap earanc of reeieo h woman. Nothing had surprised psim mnore throughout these discussions than the extraordinary ignorance of human nature and human feelings which some of the most eloquent of their lordships had displayed in handling this question. Cjonsidering all the difficulties of the case, he felt bound to support the amendment of his noble friend. The Earl of WICKLOW said that when first this question had come before their lordsbips he had been induced to support a proposition for facilitating divorces, from a feeling that the rich man ought not to be placed at s-och an advantage over the poor man in this respect. That he still thought an evil which ought to beremedied ; but, on mature consideration, he felt bound to say that the arguments urged against this Bill were infinitely stronger than that single one in its favour. He should rejoice greatly if his noble friend on the woolsack would consent to the amendment of the noblo baron opposite. It would be infinitely better that the amendment of the existing law set forth in the preamble,of wvhioh he heartily approved, should be first carried out before attempting to make any newv law with regard to so important a subject as divorce. The moment the Bill etopped out of the preamble it was opposed to the existing law of the land and to the law of God. By both of these marriage was indissoluble, and this Bill, if passed into law, would be the first great inroad on that principle. As the noble lord 'who moved the amendment had said, the public at large were taken by surprise by this Bill. No doubt the question had been under discussion now for some time before com. mittees and commissions, but it had never been discussed publicly. It had been said that the arTpment that by the sxistlng law of the land marriage was indissoluble wA advanced a cgntury and a-htlf tgo late; because duri%, that time divorces had been granted every year, but every ca5e of a private Bill introduced to grant a divorce only showed that by the law divorce was impossible. On the religious, parb oY the cass he would content himself with saying that he was thoroughly convinced the law of Scripture was opposed to this Bill. There was an opinion abroad-he did not know whether it had found an echo in that House during these debates-that there was a tendency in some portions of the Community towards Rome, and that those who had opposed this Bill were of that party. Circumstances had occurred of late years to give a colouring to that opinion, but it was entirely destitute of any real foundaton. general tendency was quite the reverse-it was towars the loose theories of Germau Protestantism; and he believed that this Bill was entirely in that direotion. In Germany, they were told, it was as easy to get rid of a wife as it wS to get rid of a servant with us. If this Bil were passed, and the prindple of the indissolubilityefrmarriage were once broken through, Parliament would be asked before long to go further in tbe same direction, and lhe hoped therefore that their lordships would resist the first step by affirmiing the amendments Lord BROUGHAM rose to administer some relief to the two noble lords who had preceded him, having great respe"t for their opinions and their scruples, from the burden which this BiU appeared to have imposed upon their minds. The sum and substance of their objection to this Bil seemed to be that a change was about to be made in the existing law, which had alway. declared divorce to be impossible in proportion as marriage was by that law indissoluble. But, in point of fact, the law was violated aud set at nought just as often as their lordships were caled on to do so, and all the conditions required were complied with. He did not say that every marriage was dissolved on such applio . tion being made, but the rule had constantly beon that as often as certain conditions were fulfilled and certain requisites complied with the party petitioning for a divorce had his marriage dissolved, and that as a matter of course. (Hear.) It was, indeed, just as much a matter of course as that in an action at law tV e jury should return a verdiot according to the evidence and the oath they had taken. Did it not, therefore, amount to a jest to talk of indissolubility in such a case as this ? (Hear.) To illustrate the extraordinary character of their present mode of proceeding, he might state that it was a standing order of their lordahips' House, not only that no divorce Bill should pass, but that no such Bill should be even presented to the House unless It contained, among other things, a clause forbidding the marrce of the adulterer and the adulteress. Bat what followed'? Why, that this clause which the standing order rendered imperative, was uniformly struck from the BiU in oora. mittee. (Hear.) Wasthisaconsistentorintelligiblecourse to ursue? HEear.) Was it consistent with the dignity of their lordsips House that such a mockery shoud be practised with regard to a matter so important as one of their standing orders? (Hear, hear.) One word with refer. ence to the tribunals appointed under the Bil. It had been said that if they made divorce in reality ajudicial proceeding, to be dealt with judicially like other matters, it would be. come a matter of course to comply with with every petition for divorce; but such an idea would never be entertained by any person who had any professional experience. Hear, hear.) Hewouldventure to express the opinion that, if there was any one particular class of cases that would excite greater attention than another, it would be the divorce cases brought before these tribunals. (Hear, hear.) That, he. was satisfied, would be in accordance with the experience of all professional men, for the judges, pure and exalted as they were, were not exalted above all human thoughts and human feelings; and even the purest and sternest of mortals, in dealing with such questions as these, would not fail to give to them the most careful and deliberate attention. (Hear, hear.) Bat, independently of the interest that would naturally be excited in such cases, their very importance would secure for them the fullest and most searching inquiry. No courb that could be established no professional man raised to the situation of a judge, would ever be found deviating from the strict rule of anxiously sifting and searching into the nature of thewhole of these cases. Suspicion seized the minds of judges as wel as other men; and the suspicion that all was not so right in the case of the petitioners, and that all was not so wrong in that of the defendant as might be represented, was sure to enter deeply into their minds, and to lead themtoathorough and sifting investigation. (Hear.) All circumstances must be proved before the judges, as at present, in that House. Let It not be supposed tbat there would be any very great increase in the number of divorces, although undoubtedly there might be some slight increase when the hindrances which were presented at present to persons of smaU means who wished to obtain divorces were removed. He could not avoid referring to the example of Scotland upon that point. In no part of Christendom was there a more sacred regard for, or more reverential awe of, the Holy Scriptures than in Scotland; yet there, from time out of mind, had divorces been granted upon proper appli. cation to the courts. He did not quote the case of Scotland in order to prove that noble lords who objected to follow her example were wrong in their views, but simply to show the opinion of that most religious people as to the dissolubility of marriage. Quitting, however, the theological question, he thought the example of Scotlandwas most importantin another way. Noble lords had said, if the law were relaxed, and divorces were made more easily procurable by the poorer classes, the number of applications would be alarm. ingly increased. But how was it in Scotland, where a law had existed so long, and whichenabled an aggrieved erson at a moderate cost to obtain the relief he desired ? Instead of divorces being frequent, there were only 17 in one year, and in two other years the number of divorces granted were respectively 10 and 20. He had no apprehension that any measure rendering the law somewhat, although notaltogether equal as between rich and poor, would have the effect of induciug afrequency of divorces. But an objection had been urged against the Bill upon the ground that, if it were passed, Parliament would inunediately be asked to go further, and there was no knowing where such legislation would stop. That objection might berased against everychangeinthe law, andthe proper answer to it was, " Wait until any unreasonable proposition is brought forward, and then oppose it." There was, however, one point in the BiU which he thought required consideration, and that was the nature of the penalty to be in lieted upon the guilty parties. He wasin favour oftreating adultery as a misdemeanour, but not as one punishable by fine or imprisonment at the option of the Court. He thought the penalty should be absolutely a pecuniary one, as, among other objections to the infliction of imprisonment for adultery, he could never consent to permit personsjto be tried, convicted, and punished without the intervention of a jury. Besides, after obtaining a divorce, no husband would like to proceed to a prosecution of the woman whom he had put away. The abolition of the action for criminal conversation well deserved the serious consideration nf their lordships. He had received communications from many parties, inclading persons of high judicial authority, offering objections to this part of the measure, or, at least, insisting upon the necessity of providing some efficient substitute. He was the more disposed te listen to the complaints of his correspondents because some of the parties suing for divorce belonged to the humbler classes of soclety, to whom the loss of a wife was a serious pecuniary evil. (Hear, hear.) In the upper ranks it was a question of feeling rather than of personal interest, and it might very well be said that an injury to the feelings of a party was not a matter for pecuniay compensation. But to a poor man the loss of the services of his wife-the loss of the benefit which he derived from her superintendence of his family-was a serious pecuniary less, and he could not help thinking that some remedy should be provided for such a case. (Hear, ear.) f proposition had been submitted to their lordships for defraying the expenses of the husband in suing for a divorce; but he went further, and said that compensation should also be awarded out of the fine imposed upon the adulterer. He knew that one of the judges held that, as an officer did not hesitate to receive damages for a stain upon his honour, there was no reason whv a pecuniary compensation should not be given to a husband for his wounded feelings. Upon the whole, he trusted that their lordships would agree to the Bill as it now stood, with the exception of the imprisonment of the adulterer, for any collision between the two branches of the Legislature ought to be deeply deplored, and if the Bill were altered in the direction indicated by the amendments upon the paper it would have little chance of passing the other House. (Bear, hear.) Lord WENSLEYDALE said that the question before their lordships was a mere dispute about terms. The law of England unuoubtedly was that divorce d vincU]o could not be pronounced by any court; but a prctice had grown up durin the last two centuries of disolviing marriage by specia Acts of the Legislature;- and Parliament had unquestionably the right of conferin~g the pwowr up on any reglary cnsttutd ribnalwhih i mihtbe pleased to estalis. Fr hs on pat, e hd eteraind considerable doubs a to he ropretyof te pesen mesur; but, as misson,conistng f vey larnd prsos, e was not pre- The Earl of CARNARVON said that the Bill esablished a 'new c-Ourt, it provided protection for women who had been deserted by their husbaids, d he believed it abolished the actionl of criminal cnertion l those wer important expdint,wie% th ney rsatinize All thecor weremorn chages, tand he thought it would be as well to see how the machinery of the new court acted before putting upon it the at pressure of dealing with divorces a vinsculo. He rufullyagreed that thie more that question was discussed the more doubts were created, and he asked the Governmeit not to drive him and other peers to vote against the thirareading by refusing to acept the amendment of the noble lord. The Bishop of OXFORD said there were masny of their lordships who believed that, whatever doubts there might be as to the general pwer of remarriage after divorce, there was no doubt tEat the words of our Lord forbade the adlulterous woman remarrying in the lifetime of her husband. If they passed the amendment of the noble lord opposite they introduced all the amendmaents of the law contemplated by the Bill short of that which made such marriages possible ; hut, if the amendment were rejected and the Bdl passed in its present shape they intentionally and knowiugly declared that the law of England should contradict the law of Christ. (No.) He believed that this question of divorce had not yet made entrancee into the publi id e had that day received a letter saying that the I clergy themselves were only beginning to awake to what Iwere the proposed alterations. He therefore thought iit hbly expedien.t, while they organized the new court, law conthne question to rest, not that he would have the al as sat present, a systemn of piivilegia, but tha hewoud aoida settle meat of what the aw should be dsrng, maske di,tofetnh mrvmet hc h of the measure b euigt dp h mnmn o proposed. The LORD CHANCELLOR thought it necessary, bafore putting the question, to remove the erroneous impression wbh9 wouldT~ prg~RbWy be produiced by whet bad sisti Ag from the right rev. prelate. The right rev. prelate said that mnanymenihers of their lordships' Houeo disapproved of that portion of tho Bill which enabled the adulterous woman to remarrTy in the lifetime of her husband, and left it to be inferred that this amendment would remedy that objection. I But the amendment, in fact, was di-ected to the rejection of the Bill. (Hear, hear.) He must complain of the course which his noble fiend had taken in moving that amendment. Their lord-hips mi2ht rely upon it that the forms of thei Proceedings were foundea substantially upon good sense. Men it was proposed to read a Bill a third time any noble lord would do right to vote for its being read a third time that day six months if he thought that it could never be made, with any amendments, a proper measure. But if he thought that with amendments it could be made a proper measure he ought to allow the Bill to be read a third time, and propose amendments on the question that the Bill do pass. The course taken by the noble lord was to propose on the third reading different amendments which, n substance, were absolutely idle-namely, that the new court, instead of being called a Court of Marriage and Divorce, should be called a Court of Marriage. if the amendments stopped there the alteration would be very incongruous, because the object of the Bill was to enable the court to grant divcrces% and therefore it was a court of marringe and divorce. The proposition went further-f and to make such amendments as shall be consequent thereon." What was meant by consequent thereon? Did it mean as far only as *vas consequent upon altering the name of the court, or did it mean to make the Bil totally different from that which their lordships had considered in committee ? SHear.) Hethought the course taken bythe noblelord very inconvenient. At the same time they were invited to divide upon thiB question. Were they or were they not prepared to sanction ti measure to make divorce a vinczdo a iudicial instead of a legislative proceeding ? (Hear.) He could hardly conceive that any one would gravely state that the measure tookthepublic by surprise. (ifear.) Seven or eightyears ago a Royal commission Issued to inquire into the subject. Four or five years ago the commission made their report. Four or five BUIls had been Introduced at various times, and a select committee of their lordships loolred into the question last year, with a degree of care and accuracy which had been rarely equalled and never surpassed. (Hear, hear.) To be gravely told that the discussion of the Bill at the last stage took the country by surprise was an attempt to draw very largely upon the credulity of their lordships. (Hear, hear.) If the measure were not ripe, he wanted to know at what period of the world's history would it ever be ripe for decision? (Hear, hear.) He would only add in answer to his noble friend (Earl of Wioldow) that if he believed the Bill calculated to lead to those evils which were figured as making the marriage bond too lax in some of the Northern States of Germany, he would throw it in the fire rather than ask their lordships to sanctlon It. (Hear, hear.) He thought it would have no such consequences. For 200 years the principle of the Bill had been in operation, and scarcely a single attempt had been made to gain divorce for any caut e but adultery. If the feeling of the country had not bean altored for320 years he did not believe the change from a legislative to a judicial proceeding would have any effect whatever. (Hear, hear.) A suggestion had been thrown out that the anticipation of justice being made acces3ible to the poor would not be realized. Now, that be altogether demed. It was perfectly true that the rich enjoyed advantages which the poor did not ossess;but that was a state of things which was incidental to the very existence of men in society, and which no legislation could obviate. The rich, for instance, could. always com. mand the services of the ablest lawyers, while the poor man was not in a position to avadl himself of their aid. There was, however, no good reason why, in the tribunal which the Bill proposed to establish, the expense of a suit should involve the outlay of one farthing more than if it had been instituted before a judge whose jurisdiction did, not extend beyond actions for the recovery of the small sum of 5Z. He might add that the poor man, in cases relating to property mightnowsueinforcnaulmeinthecourts0f Westminster, and the judges of the new tribanal would in framing the rules for tho conduct of its business be enabled to extend the system of suing in fermd pauperis as far as might seem to be expedient. There could be no doubt, at all events, that the effect of the Bill would be to enlarge the area ofthose personswho were entitled toclaim the relidf which it provided, and he therefore trusted that their lordships would reject all amendments which had for their oblect, either directly or indirectly, to render valueless that which was the substantial feature of the measure. (Hear.) Afterafew observations from the Bishop of BAwGoB, who was quite inaudible in the gallery, The House divided. Contents ... ... ... ... .. 91 Not content ... ... ... 34 Majority against the amiendnent ... -57 The Earl of DONOUGHMORE then moved an amendment, the effect of which was that a wife might obtain a divorce a vineulo even if the adultery of which she accused her husband had not been incestuous. Lord CAMPBELL opposed the amendment. A commission, upon which he himself had sat, had unanimously =veulat the conclusion that the same liberty should not be granted to the wife as regarded procuring a dissolution of marriage which was allowed to the husbafnd. The principle upon which that conclusion was arrived at was that it was not expedient that divorce should be granted upon the suit of the wife unless the conduct of her husband had been such as to render cohabitation impossible. The first in. stance in which a divorce a vfncuo had been granted upon the prayer of the wife was in the time of Lord Thurlow, 'and m that case a divorce had been granted upon the ground that future cohabitation between the parties was impossible. The amendment was negatived without a division. Lord LYNDHUBST proposed an amendment, the effect of which was to enable a woman to obtain a divorce if she had been deserted by her husband for more than five years without reasonable cause. The amendment was negatived without a division. The LORD CHANCELLOR then moved, in the absence of Lord St. Leonard's, to strike out from the Bill the words " fie or imprisonment," the effect of which was to remove all power of imprisonment of either party, but to enable the court to impose a fine on the adulterer or to make him pay costs. In most cases a husband would not care to obtain a divorce if he thought that by so doing he would subject his wife to imprisonment; and as to imposing a fine upon her, that was at once nugatory. The Bishop of OXFORD oonsidered that the words pro. posedto bo struck out formedthegreatestsecurityforparity of life among the lower orders. lf those words were struck out, persons, either from a temporary quarrel, or from any other cause, might procure a divorce, and there would be no safeguard against a woman going to live with her paramour and her husband with his for the purpose of procuring a dissolution of the marziage tie. Their lordships then divided, when the numbers were- For the amendment ... ... ... ... 49 Against ... ... ... ... 29 Majority- ... ... ... ... 20 The amendment was therefore carried. Earl NELSON moved an amendment upon the 54th clause, providing that in case of the remarriage of divorced persons such marriage should take place in the office of the regstrar, or in some building registered under the Marriage and Registration Act, and according to the form and provisions of that Act. The object of this amendment was to provide that, as this matter had been argued on purely civil grounds, so the remarriage, if it took place, should be only a ciVil marg. Unless this amendment were ageed to the clergy of the established church, who believed that marriage was indissoluble, and that the marriage of the adulterer and adulteress was sinful, would be obliged to perform that marriage and to read the solemn servioe established for that ceremony by the church of England. There had been some question as to whether the law of the church was opposed to this legislation, but, be that as it might, there occurred in one of the prayers for the marriage service these words, " that it should never be lawful to put asunder those whom thou by matrimony haut made one." Could any conscientious clergyman who believed that this legislation was contrary to the law of God celedrate such a marnage; or could he pronounce God's blessing over the parties, and thus confirm them in their adultery ? The clergy had entered into a contract with the State, they had signed the 39 Articles, and yet the State, without conslting the clergy, broke that, imposed a 40th article without obtaining their assent to it, and demanded from them the discharge of a duty which they bad not contracted to perform. It might be said that, under the present system, clergymen had already married divorced persons, but these would naturally go to be married at places where they were not known. so that the clergyman would have no opportunity of findig out what they veri It was said, too, that in relieving the consciences of the clergy the consciences of the laity might be endangered; bue surely, as this privilege of divorce had been obtained on civil grounds, the parties who had obtained it might remain content with a civil marriage. Those who put the conscience of the registrar in comparison with the consciences of the clergy clearly did not understad theposition in which the clergy were placed by this BilL The registrar had merely to perform an official duty of registering certain namesinabook. Hehadnottopronounce thechurch'sblessing over the parties, nor to do anything which gave a religious character to the ceremony. Besides, if he objected to per- ormingthnese marriages, he was not obligedtobe aregistrar, all the other professions were open to him; but a clergyman, if he had such objections and acted on them, must starve. It was said that this amendment would endanger the union between Church and State, but the only union which it would endanger would be that which would ive usaclergy without a conscience. The union between Uhurch and State might be kept up by doing justice to the Church, and by the Church obeying where she was pledged to obey; but by this Bill the State was proposing to do that towards the Church which would be looked upon as dishonest in transactions between man and man. It was true thaI not many petitions had been presented on the subject, but he had received many letters from clergymen expessing very strongly their feelings with reference to it. He contended that if they did away with an ecclesiastical statute on purely civil grounds, by which marriages not hitherto legal were made so, they were bound to reheve clergymen from the performance of such marriages. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of WINCHELSEA believed it was the opinion of a great, majority of the clery of the chunh of England that the mnarriage of the adulterer with the aduteI-ress during the lifetime of her husband was contrary to the word of God-an opinion in which he concusreod-aud he contended that they were therefore entitled to the relief sought for them by the noble earL. If there were no other reuon 'why he should oppose this Bill, the fact that it lelsdsch marriages would be sufficient. He objected toteHouse of Lords changing that which had been the law of thkis coantry for 200 years, and laying downaprnil tat was in direct opposition to the will of the! Am hty. (gear, hear.) Even if he could approve the BUil before the House, hxe objected to the machfinery whichx it employed, for it would fai to give redreBs to the great body of those who were placed under the painfu necessity of seeking relief at the hands of the tribunal established under the Bil. For a law to be just it ouht to metet eqally the wants of every class of the c0.-omulnlity. Hetrte that the House would not do wrong to theo consciences of thoseo clergymen who felt tha4t they would be acting contrAry to the law of God If they united in the sacred ties of marria3e the class of persons pointed out In the BilL (Hear, hear.) The LORD CHANCELLIOR said this questien was now before them for the third time. An nameadment, not precisely the same in words, but the same in spirit with that now before their lordships, was moved in the committee on the Bill, and negatived in a very full House. On the recommitment of the Bill thS noble earl (Earl Nelson) moved the question in precisel the same words as now, and after discussion it was again negatived. It was now moved for the third time. (Hear.) Undoubtedly his noble friend had a right to call oa their lordships to reconsider the matter; bat he thought the House ought not, without good reason, and unless something not previously understood or known was brought before it, to unsettle a matter that had nlready been well aud maturely considered. The point was, that there were conscientious clergymen who thoaht it inconsistent with their duty to celebrate a marriage between two persons ono of whom had been dlivorced Now, he should like to know where these conscientious seruples were to end. A somewhat similar objection had been urged two or three years since, in a debate which took place upon the subject of reading the burial service over the bodies of oertain persons, but it was met by the reply that clergymen were bound by the law of the lad, and must obey it. So if the law of the land declared that it was proper to allow cerain parties to be married, it was a law that must be obeyed. It had been said that parties married by the registrar might afterwards be married by a clergyman, but he (the Lord Chancellor) thought it was exoeedingly doubtful whether sach a courSe would be waranted by the Act of Parlia, ment; and, if it were to be declared that divorced parties should be allowed to Marry at a registrars office, it would clearly imply that the7 oould be married there only. Upon the ground that parties when divorced should be placed in the same position as unmarried personsi and were therefore entitled to be married in the same manner as Her MajesWs other subjects, he hoped their lordships would reject the amendment. The Bishop of OXFORD said his amendment had been drawn with a view to meet the objection of the noble and learned lord. The words were "In the office of any regis. trar, or in any baUding erected under the General Registra. tion Act, according to the manner and form, and sabject to the provisions contained in the said Act." No new power of marrying by a registrar was created, but the power was to be subjcttothe provitnons containedinthatAct,one of which was thatthe relieous ceremonymightbe dterwards performed if the parties chose, and could find a clergman to officiate, The noble and learned lord had compared the scruples of the clergy to marry divorced persons with those which were entertained by some respecting tho reading of the burial service in particular cases, but in trath there was a vast difference. Every clergyman who held an office in the church accepted such office with the knowledge that he was-to act in aceordance with the law of the realm, bat the hardship which he complained of in the present instance was that, after cle en had taken upon themselves an office which they could not vacate, the Legislature was about to alter the law of the land, and to compel them to act in a manner which they considered to be contrary to the laws of ,od. (Hear, hear.) He did not wish to prolong a needless discussion, for he gathered from what had passed that a majority against the amendment had been secured; but he desired to impress upon their lordships the deep interest with which the qnestion was viewed by many of the most estimable clergymen of the church of England. He had on a previous evemng read a letter from an archdewcon in the diocess of Glocester, amost respected and aged clergyman, and holding what were known as Evangelicad opinlons, in which he declared that the Bill if passed would be a cruel and oppressive act towards the church of England. It had aeen urged against the amendment that there was no procedent for it. But that was a mistake, for in the Marriage Act of last year, a similar clause had been introduced; and in 1850, when a highly respected friend of his introduoed a B3I to legalize the marriage of a widower with a decased wife's sister, he expressly declared that he did not seek to force the clergy to perform those m a -s, and a d to an amendment making such marriage vaTid only forcivil purpoes. e contended, therefore, there were precedents or such a lause as was now proposed. It was true that the Government had a majority, but even were the clause rejectedthe questiqn would setll remain unsettledL (Hear.) DIssatIsfaction would be spread throughout the church at an alteration in the conditions upon which conscientious clergymen held their offices, and which put them to the alternative of yielding their benefices, or of acting, as they believed, contrary to the Word of God. Surely the conscientious scruples of clergymen of the church of England were not to be less regarded than the conscientious scru ls of any other class of Her Majesty's subjects. Theyhad undertaken to obey the law of the lancd, which was In accordance with the word of God. It was now proposed to change that law in a manner they conceived to be contrary to God's Word, and yet they were caUed upon to sacrifice their consciences or give up their offices. Hle hoped their lordships would pause before they inflicted so great a wrong upon the clergy of England. (H., hear.) Lord CAMPBELL said that the right rev. prelate had argued as if the clause proposedwas directed against the guilty parties, whereas it was levelled against the injured husband, who miht be a pattern of fidelity and of every religious duty. o compel such a man to have his remarriage celebrated in . manner which could not fail to be hurtful to his conscienoe-in the office of a registrar-was a measure which he trusted their lordships would never sanction. Lord REDESDALE maintained that it could not fairly be called a burden'up'on conscience to compel a man to have his marriage celebrated in the first instance in the office of a registrar. He might have the religious ceremony performed afterwards. It was no matter of surprise to him that there had hitherto been majorities in favour of the Bill, because it was a Government measure, and all the adherents of Ministers had been summoned to support it, whereas there hadbeen nothing like a " whip) " on the other side. TheBishop of EXETER said that until the remarlk of the Lord Chief-Justice were addressed to their lordships, it was his intention to support the clause, but, instructed by that noble and learned lord as to the effect of the proposition, he was bound to say that he could not subject an injured husband to the indignity of being married in the office of a registrar. Viscount DUNGANNON could not consent to confound the innocent with the guilty, and was, therefore, constrained to vote against the amendment. Their lordships then divided, when the numbers were For the amendment ... ... ... ... 19 Against it ... ... 47 Majority against the amendment ... -28 The amendment was therefore lost. The Bishop of EXETER said he should acquiesce in the decision of their lordships by which the amendment of the most rev. the Archbishop of Canterbury, to prevent the guilty party marrying again, was rejected, although he regretted it. But he did not think they were called upon to ao more than not to exclude guilty parties from matrimony, and he could not consent to their being married with the most solemn ceremony of the church, which from first to last presumed, not only the sacredness of marriage, but the fitness of the parties who offered themsdves. Adultery rendered persons liable to the censure of the church, and the tDitle of these persons to marriage was simply their adultery. The celebration of such marriages according to the rites of the church would be making the holy offices the merest instruments of State policy. (Hear.) He should t'herefore move that the following proviso be added to clause 54: Bll" Provided that, after sentence of divorce shaU have been duly pronounced in any suit by reason of adultery committed by either party, it shall be lawful for the party by reason of whose adultery the said sentence shall have been pronounced, in case of his or her intending to intermarry with the party with whom such adultery has been committed, to make and subscribe a declaration in conjunction with such last-mentionedparty before any one of the jadges of the Court of Marriage and Divorce, or by any person to be commissioned by the said Court under the official to receive such declaration, in the terms of the schedule herennto annexed; andaupon such declaration being made as aforesaid, it shaU be lawful for the judge, or the person so commissioned, to declare the said parties to be lawfuly married; andsuch marriage shall begood andlawful to aU intents and purpcoses whatsoever. Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall make lawful any marriaeg between any parties who are now disabled by law from contracting marriage together by reason of consanguinity or affinity." The LORD CHANCELLOR thought the amendment was one which was open to considerable objection. The result of its adoption would be to create a new sort of marriage, hitherto utterly unknown to the laws of this country, andto deprive the parties involved of the power of having their marriage celebrated by the church, and consequently of the benefit to be derived from making it a religious ceremony. Lord CAMPBELL said, the proviso would impose upon him, or any other judge of the new coart, the obligation of declaring the partis in question to be lawfully married, if theysoughttohave that ceremony performed. Now, Nappose he were a conscientious person (a laugh), he miht have some scrnple about taking that course, and ye' if! he were not to do it he should be liable to be dischargod from his office. The Bishop of EXETER observed that, notwithstanding the very extreme supposition of the noble and Ilearned lord that he had a conscience (renewed laughter), he could hot understand how the noble and learnea lord could object to cary into execution that which the law of the land had declared to be legal. To adopt the course of having the marriage weremony, under the circumstances of the caso, performed in the church, would be to inffict a grievous wound upon her, and would be contrary to the very essence of the sacred service. Their lordships then divided, when the numbers were:- Content ... ... ... 24 Non-Content .. .. ... ... 38 Majority ... ... ... -14 On the motion of the LORD CHANCELLoR the last clause of the Bill was strnck out. The question having been put that the Bill do pass, The Bishop of OXFORD said, that he did not intend to reopen the whole question, but he wished to protest t) the last against the Bill, which, as he belEeved, was contrary to God's Word, and to the law of the church of England, and would be fruitful of future crime and misery. (Eear, hear,) By passing this Bill their lordships were dealing a more fatal blow at family purity than they could have done by any other enactment, (Hear, hear.) Entertaining these views, he could not allow the Bill to pass without again dividing their lordships, in order that the names of those who opposed it at its last stage might stand on record for posterity. Their lordahips nad been led on to this measure by the example of Scotland, but they had removed from it all the th, such as they were, which had in Scotland prevented the full operation of the evil principle. They were now pasdng a Bill which professed to give the same relief to the poor as to the rich; but it was impossible that that object could be effected by a ingle court sitting in Lonaon. It vas impossible that a poor man from the country could bring his witnesses up to town and carry his cause in that court This was a Bill for the rich. It was an immunity for adulterers aud adulteresses in the high places of Eng- land. If this mnisacable BiU passed into a law they would be compelled to give to inferior jurisdictions power to settlo thens nice questions, in order that theY might give to the poor the same justice, if the eilled it jstice, which this Bill gave to the rich, by the necessary introduction of unlimited collusion. Upon that ground he entreated their lordsbips to refuse to pass the Bill. They had taken from it all the guards by which it mas originally aecompanied, or which h been ina troduced into it, and it would be launched forth-first, to give an unjust advantage to wealtb, and subsequently, threugh the increase of collusion, to destroy the morals of the pOOr.

The LORD CHEANCELLOR~e, in3n. the second reading of this Bill, explained that its principal object was to remove a doubt as to whether the Act of Parliament passed in the beginning of the reign of Wiliam IV., rendering lawfuleducational cbarities for Roman Catholics, was retrospective or not. It had been decided that it was retrospective, but some ingenious gentleman had since raiedadoubt on the subject, and it wasnow proposed to pass this Bill to remove any such doubt. The Bill' ilso provided that it should be lawful for the trustees of Roman Catholic charities to enrol theia within a year after the paaiing of this Act, with the sme effect as it they had been registered from the beginning. It further provided that in the case of trusts Party lawful and party unlawful the Court of Chancery should investigate and decide what part of the trust should be aplied to lawful uses, and what to the unlawfal or superstiious uses. There was a clause to provide that, where there was a doubt about the charity, the usage of 25 years should be conclusive. The Bill wasthenread a seeond time.

FINSEURY PARK (No. 2) BILL. Lord R. GROSVENOR moved the second reading of this Mr. WILLIAMS aid that his constituents objected to this measure beause they were never likely to receive any -benefit from it, and because no scheme had been promulgated by the First Commigsioner of Works for the establishment of parks in other parts of the metropolis The inhabitants of Newington, Vamberwell, and other populous districts in the borough of Lambeth wanted a park as much as the; people of Finabury, but they saw no prospect of obtaining one. It was proposed that the Government sehould advance 50,OOO1. towardls the formation of Finsbury Parkl, but he found no mention of this in the Bill, and should like toknow whetherthe Govern. ment had withdrawn that promise or not. When a park w.as wanted for L,ambeth it was made by subscription, and he would recommend the people of Finabury to do the same. He moved that the Bill be read a second time that day six Sir J. SHELLEY seconded the amendment. Mr. COX said that the borough of Finsbury, of which he had the honour to be a representative, had increased its population 200 per cent. in 20 years, and now contained ,000 persons. Unless the present BiMpassed there would never be an open spaoc in the borough. In 1851, when it was found the boronuh was so crowded, appliction was made to Lord J. Bussell, then at the heat of Her MajWesys Governmentj who directed notices to be prepared for the formation of a, park for Finsbury. Before, however, a BiU could be brought in a change of Ministry occurred. Subsequent attempts were made under the Government of Lord Derby to obtain a park for Finsbury, but again a change of Ministry frastrated the design. When the Metropolitan Board of Works was established it was felt that they were the proper body to deal with the question of new parks for the metropolis, and Parliament gave them the power to form publio parks. The present Bill was the first step towards carrying this Act into effect, and the MetropoHtan Board of Works designed to form three parks-one for Finsbury, a second for Bermondsey, and a third for Hampstead-heath. They had not been able to give the requisite notices in time for the two last mentioned parks, but it was their intention to proceed next session with a Bil for a park for Bermondsey, and for throwing open Hampstead.heath for public use. The rate necessary for the present park, if spread over 20 years, would not amount to more than afarthing in the pound per annum. He believed that the ratepayers of the metrophls would be gld to payseosmalla sum, since theywould save more than aojubleth amount in doctors' bill. He did not beleve the House would have heard any objections to this bi if the people of Lambeth had not already obtained their Kennington Park enclosure and their park at Batterea. (Cheers.) Mr. CLAY thought it a mistake to suppose that the advantages of a public park in the metropoliswere confined to those who livea in its immediate vicinity. (Hear.) Seeing the rateat which the metropolis was extending itself he was an advocate for a belt of parks all round London,and the sooner these improvements were made the cheaper they would ba made. (Hear, hear.) Sir J. SHELLEY did not oppose this Bil because he objected to a general rate for these parks, but because the position selected for Finsbury Park was not the best that could be found, or one that was likely to give the people of Finsbury an open place, accessible to the crowded districts of the borough. Knowing the difficulties with which the.-Metropolitan Board of Works had to contend, it was much to be regretted that their first propodtion should be one of so objectionable a nature. Powers such as those now asked for should, under any circumstances, be regarded with jealousy, and he felt bound to resist the present application for them. Lord R. GROSVENOR was sorry that the metropolis should exhibit to Parliament the unseemly spectacle of a House divided against itself. (Hear.) Those who had no scruples about taming the whole empire for metropolitan improvements were found the first to resist any measure to tax themselves for the benefit of their neighbours. (Hear.) The opposition to this Bill was nothing but a most impudent attempt on the part of the people of Lambeth and Westminster, who had two large parks kept up fer them from the public funds, to escape their fair contribution towards a park for zhe unfortunate denizens of Finsbury. As to the particular spot chosen for this park being beyond the metropolitan district, if they delayed the purchase of the land a single year longer they would.be compelled to go stiU further out or a site. The whole of these desirable improvements, including Hampstead-heath, Finsbury Park, an Bermondsey Park, would not entail a heavier rate on the property of the metropolis than id. in the pound. Mtr. SPOONER, without entering into the quarrel of metropolitan members, wished to know whether it was true that the Government had promised, if this Bill passed, to recommend to Parliament a vote of 50,0001. from the national exchequer towards the completion of this park. If the public taxes were devoted to such a purpose, every other large town in the kingdom proposing to provide itself with a park would hsve an equal claim to a eimilar contribution. Mr. T. DUNCOMBE said that the estimated cost of this park was 300,0001., towards which the Government.-of course with the sanction of Parliament-was to give 50,000h The scheme had received the approval of successive Governments, and it was now about to be carried out under the Metropolitan Board of Works, chiefly, by means of a rate on the inhabitants of the metropolis. This park was not intended for Finsbury alone, but for the whole of the northern part of London. the population of which was now between 500.000 and 600,000, and was daily increasing. When he was first returned for Finsbury, Islington had only 2,000 or 3,000 reglstered electors, and a population of be. tween 30,000 and 40,000- but it had now above 10,000 registered electors, ana a popnlation of between 130,000 ind 140,000. io more ungenerous or unreasonable propositon than that of the hon. member for Lambeth could have been made. That hon. gentleman had said that the proposed park would be of no more use to Lambeth than to the people at the Land's.end; bat he had got his Battersea Park and Eenington-common, which had cost the whole of the united .ungdom between 200,0001. and 300,000. And even this veryyear a sum of 8,0001. had been voted by the House for the completion of the Battersea Park wbich he had got for himself and the Battersea boys to disport themeelves in. (Laughter.) Now, of what use he (Mr. Duncombe) might ask was that park at Battersea to the people of Finabury and the northern district I And it was for the ver reason that it was of no use to them that it was sought to form a park at Finsbury. He did not believe that if the ratepayers of Lambeth or Westminster were canvassed on the question they would object to being taxed for a perk at limabury. Their representatives in the Metropoit-a Board of Works, he believed, had assented to the introduc. tion of the Bill. Mr. HENLEY should rejoice to see a park formed, niot only at Finsbury but in every other place where there was a crowded population, and but for the intimatioi of the hon. member for Fiusbury that tho Government had given a sort of pledge that a certain sum in aid would be asked from the House by the Govern ment towards the formation of the pr sed ak, he should have willngly supported the Bill. he right hon. baronet the membeir for Marylebone bad conferred great benefit upon the metropolis by the creationx of the Metro. politan Board of 'Works for the managment of the saibra of this Vastrmetropolis. The right hon. gentleman t~ok esPecialcare to vest them with ample taxing power. which he (Mr. Henley) was quite certain would secure their popularity. (Laughter.) He did not see anything in the BilrelaMng to any arrangement with the Government as to a vote of money out of the public purs, but that there mrght be no misunderstanding the Government oughttomake a dstinct declaration whether they hi any promise e people of Flnsbhry before the Houle was asked to agree to tsecond reading. (Hear, hear.) Lot the ratepayers of the metropolis tax themselves for the proposed perk (HKear, hear.) He was convinced that they wobuld exercise a sound discretion upon that subject. (Laughter.)

But it ws ridiculous to put a oountry town on a par Witln London, for London was the mietropolos of thewholeempire, and every part of the empire -was intere forin the wlloubing of its capital. (Hear, bear.)

He wa3 not quite surewhether the arrangement was to form partrof the Bill, or whether the propoal was to be male contingent on the pasing of the measure.

(Hear.)

WOOD thought that thersne proposed byte tion. and learned gentleman who bad just spoken was not that whicht fairly arose upon the question that this Bill be read a, second time. Any opposition with respect to a grant of money in aid of this park would properly arise upon aclause. in the Bill, and not onL t-he secondt reading; and, as an appre- henision appeared to exist that the GOvernment were under - some engagement to advance money to other parka, he begged to state that no such engagement or understandinghad been come to with respect to any other park wrhme. er.. It should not be forgotten that the constituents of the honand learned maember for the Tower Hamlets had bad a, ~ak provided for them at the public expense. (Hear, MIr. RICABRDO looked upon this proposition as the first. steptowards a grant of 50,0001. for the construction of a parkinFinsbury ; and as his constituLents were anxious to. mnake a park for themselves, and were subscribing money for the purpose, he feared that he should not be able to per- suade them that there was any justice in callig upon them, to give money for a park in Finsbury when the Finshury pIeople subscribed nothing for making a park in the Stafford.. -shire Potteries. (Hear, hear.) Seeing the immense sums, of money that were being expended in museumas and_ gal- leries in the metropolis, he should on every occasiont set h isface against grants of public money for the local purposes or the metropolis.

He.- would suggest, therefore, that some gentleman who wasopposed to the grant of 50n0001 should ec ove that the Bil be adjounmed for a fortniht, and that the decision come to. should be a test of the opinion of the House with respect to' the grant. He. proposed this course, because Itwrould bevery hard to thr-ow out the BUil on the ground of an ob'e. tionL to the grant and nothing else. If the House tiien~ should decido against the grant, it would be for the Board oP Works to decide whether, under those circumstnces, they would proceed with the Bill. {Hear, hear.) Mr. SL&NEY supported the secondreading. Mr. MILES said that there could be no objection to thex formation of this park if it were made by means of locza taxation, but he had a decided objection to the advance opf 50.000. of public money to this first ricketty production of the MeItropolitan Board of Works.

The committee appointed to inquire into the allegations contained in Mr. Newall's petition met again on Monday and yesterday; but, as the resolution come to by them on Saturday for the exclusion of the public was enforced during a portion of Monday's and the whole of yesterday's sitting, the account we are able to give of the proceedings isnecessarily imperfect. Mr. Harris, a sohcstor atRocadale, and deputy returningofficer, stated that be was the agent for the petitioners against the successful candidate at the late election ; that lIothwell had for the last 16 years voted with the Liberal party in the borough; that he had brought Rothwell to London for the purpose of getting him a saituation, and aso with a view to prevent any tampering with him at Bockdale; and that with the same view Rothwell had been talen to Paris by Mr. Livesey, an alderman and cottonLpinner of the borough. He knew a person namod John J-ord, but he thought Lord had not taken an active part in the election. A letter (handed to witness by Mr. Roebuck) purporting to be written by Lord to Rothwell, and stating that if Lord were examined before the eleotion committee the result maust be his ruin, was, he believed, in Lord's handwriting. Peter Johnson was reported to be connected with the Conservative , and to beseretary to the Registration Society. He could not give any positive information with regard to the letters he had recently recelved on the subject of this petition without referin to his papers. the secrtary to the Rochdale Reform Associion, said that he came to L^ndon on the 26th of May, and at flrst stayed at Ryder's Hotel with fr. Livesey and RothwelL Subequently Rothwell removed to a artmnents in the BlaCkfrlsrs.roadl On Thursday Rothweli in. formed him that Peter Johnson wished to get him out of theway. Rothwell afterwards told him thatbehadhad an interview with Peter Johnson, at which Jobnson had offered him 50& to go to New Orleans. On Friday evening he saw Johnson and Lord In conwersation at the Elephant and Castle, and Johnson was there served withthe Speaker's summons to attend at the bar of the House. He had paid Rothwell's hotel expenses after Mr. Livesey left, and had lent him 21. Mr. Harri having refreehed his memaory by an examination of his papers, said he did not think he had received a letter from tothwell on Friday. Mr. Livesey went to Paris for his health, and took Rothwell in order to get him out of the reach of the influenoe of the Rochdale people. Rothwell had obtained employment in London, but -he wM not awre that it was through Mr. Livesey's influence. Mr. Newall, the Parliamentary agent, was also examined, and expressed his belief, from what passed at a conversatio between Mr. Harris, Mr. Livesev, nd himself, that there aiio on the other sde to get Bothwell out of At this stge of the proceodings the room was cleared, and the doors remnued losed until the rising of the com- Yesterday the committee met at hal-past 2 o'clock, but the public were excluded during the whole of the sitting.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, J.UNZ 24 1857. In the Rouse of Lords last night the third readinm of the Divorce Bill was discussed at some length the first amendment being one moved by Lord REDmDEA:, which, if carried, would have deprived the new Court to be established of the power of granting divorces a vinetdo. Lord Crrszrna deprecated any such restriction; but Lord MALB YBuR not only supported the amendment, but condemned those provisions in the Bill which attached penal consequences to a conviction for adultery. Lord Wicaww also lamented all the evil consequences which he foresaw might flow from any Act which affirmed the dissolubility of marriage, but Lord BRoUGium "administered relief," as he called it, to those two noble Lords, by reminding them that marriages had always been dissoluble, and that, as a matter of course, if certain conditions prescribed by a Standing Order of that House were fulfilled,a divorce was granted. He did notbelieve that there would be any great increase in the number of divorces after the passiDg of this Bill, to which he recommended their Lordships to agree, with the exception of that clause which entailed the punishment of the adulterer otherwiwe than by a pecuniary fine. Lord CARnxrvow and the Bishop of OxFonD also spoke in favour of the amendment, but, after a reply from the LoBD CHAwcLLoR, it was rejected by a majority of 57. Two other amendments were negatived without a division, but one, moved by the LORD C NCoR, striking out the words " fine and imprisonment," to which lord BROUGHAM had objected, was carried by a mnajority of 20. Another amendment, moved by Lord NELSoN, aud supported by the Bishop of OxvoRD, providing that the re-marriage of divorcee persons should be only a civil marriage, and that the clergy should not be compelled to solemnize such marriage, was also defeated, principally upon the suggestion of Lord CAP4itRL, by a msajority of 28, as was one almost similar moved by the Bishop of EETaER. On the question that "the Bill do pass," the Bishop of OxroaD once more protested against it, and divided the House, but was defeated by a majority of 21. The Bill therefore passed, and their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, at the time of private business, a long and animated debate arose upon the order for the second reading of the Finsbury Park (No. 2) Bill, with especial reference to an alleged agreement on the part of the Government to contribute 50,0001 towards the expenses of the Park. Lord PALMERSTON frankly acknowledged that the Government had agreed, if the Bill were brought in, to propose to Parliament to grant 50, 1. towards this object, and he defended the arrangementor understknding, which was, of course he added, subject to the decision of the House, and was no objection to the second reading of the Bill. A division was taken upon the question that the dlebate be adjourned, which was carried by 214 to 123. This decision wias3 understood to be adverse to the principle of granting public money towrards such objects. The debate was adjourned until Thursday. Sir D. NORF.YS, iD moving for leave to bring in a Bill to providt; for the management of the fiscal a:fairs of c!,uijties in Ireland by electoral Boards, described in strong coidemnatory terms the existing grand jury system of managemLent, ancd from its cbaracter he inferred the nee-ssity of an entire reform. A large suax of money, upwards of 1,000,0001. a-year, hp observed, was collected and disbursed under tbis faulty system, and he proposed to eubAtitutt electoral Boards or a system analogous to that of the Poor Law. Colonel FRENCH, meaning to meet the motion by a direct negative, defended the grand jury system, which, he said, was sirple and economical, whereas the system proposedto besubstitutd was cumbrous in its machinery aud expensive. IzB. B3AGWHFLL considered the granld jury sytem to be one of the greatest anomaies; -but he eoul4 not vote- for bringing' iii the proposed Bill, whdch would, in his opinion, mike a bad sytm te thound times worse. The motion was supported by Mr. M'Mxoxr mid Mr. CooGA. Mr. I. HsERBSIT admitte that oertain iWperf.c. tions did exist in the grand jury ystem, and would be glad, he said, to be instrumental in remedyig the defects; but he did not believe that the syste' was such as would justify the vivid descripti o£ Sir D. Nonxmys. He wax redy to acoodu to a liberil modification of the grand jury system, but rXot to so extensive a change as would sweep that system entirely away. fr..M.Aauraz, M£r. GraxE, and Mr. Bowyows spoke in condemnation of the grand jury system, and Lord C. HAxmTiow in its defence. Sir D. Noanays withdrew his motion. Mr. J. B. SmTH moved a resolution, "That it is expedient that Parliament shall direct its immediate attention to the best mode of removing the obstacles which impede the application of Briti capital and skill to the improvement of the productive powers of Indi" He adverted to the sucoes of our late wise commercial policy, which had created a demand at home for raw materials; to the short supplr of cotton, indispensable for our manufactures and to thedangerof afailure of supply of that artiele from America. In this state of things we posessed in India an unllimnited extent of lanld adapted to the growthofcotton. It had been asked, he said, why the manufacturers of this country did not sead agents to India to buy cotton; but if, as the fact was, few English went to India thatfact alone a ground for inquiry. The reil cause, he insised, wasthatIndiangovernmentwas synonymouswithba - government; and he read statements showing the absence of roads and meahs of carriage in India and the want of facilities forirrigation, which woul prodigiously increase the produce of. cotton. A, serious obstacle to the improvemen. of India and to, the resort of Europeans thither consisted, lhe observed, in the tenure of the land, and the manner in which the land revenue was assesed. There w-i~ abundant evidence that India was capable of producing not only cotton, but sugar, tobacco, flax, hemp, and other articles, and if obstacles were removed, and the condition of the people ameliorated, the consumption of our manufactures, he believed, would be enormous,-equal to our exports to the rest of the world. Tfese obstacles the Government had the powerto remove, and public works for that object realized a profit in. India, which in some cases amounted to 200 per cent.,-a result that would, in his opinion, jut the borrowing of money for the purpose, and Ind might thus be covered with public works. Mr. S H cited authorities upon all these points, and to show that the poverty of the ryots was so abject that they could not cultivate without advances, for which an interest of 30 to 70 per cent. was exacted. In concluaion, he animadverted upon the mamner inwhich charges against the East India Company's government were usually met, by denials which eventually proved to be groundless. The motion was seconded by Mr. Tu1ExB, who urged the immense importance of the cotton trade, in which the demand for the raw material hadovertaken the supply, and that we must look to India to .make up the deficiency; and if the cotton was raised from the American instead of the indigenous seed, the quantity, as well as value of the wool, would be greatly increased. Mr. MAzGLES observed that the subject was of great importance, but one that ws little understood. This motion, assuming that the productive powers of India were impeded, was brought forward at a time when those powers were such that India produced and sent to this country a great dealmore than we were able to take. If those who wanted cotton from India would, instead of calling upon JTurrIM to help them, help themselves by adopting the same means which were taken by those who wanted other articles,-sending agents to India,there was no amount of cotton they might not get, and within a short time. He asked why the tenure of land should affect the cultivation of cotton more than that of indigo or sugar. He pointed out certain misapprehensions of Air. SmiTH regarding the proprietorship of the land in India and the survey about to be introduced into the Madras Presidency. He stated the sums which had been expended upon public work?, and the extent of roads already executed, one railroad csrrying a pound of cotton 650rmilea for a farthing. Of works for irrigation, besides the Gauges canal, 810 miles in length,he specified other similar undertakings, and the large area of 20,000 square miles, over which the works now in the course of execution extended. He followed Mr. S3im into many of his details, and declared that the East India Company were doing all that men could do to extend and develope the internal resources of India, but he protested against their being expected to do what no Government ought to do. LOrd STANLY replied to Mlr. MANIGIE He contended that the Indian Government had no right to take advantage of its own wrong-doing; that there would be a demand for Indian cotton in this country if the cotton-growing districts were so open to the seaboard that it was poesible to brin, it from the interior to compete with American cotton in the ordinary state of the market. With reference to the works we had executed in India, if we took the native States as they pased into our hands, he observed, and compared the works made therein and the proportion they bore to the resources and population of their dynasties with those of our Government, giving the latter credit for the Ganges Canal and other similar works, he was much mistaken if. on a fair comparison, it would not be found that many of those dynastes had provided better for the material wants of the country. He remarked upon the strong tendency to a war policy in India, and that if works of internal improvement were to be postponed until there was a surplus of Indian revenue he apprehended the delay would be a very long one. MIr. SLxsiYM observed that muchof the speech of Mr. Srn applied to a state of things which existed several years ago, and many of his facts and statements were derived from old documents. He referred the Hlouse to more recent returns, whicel would show that of late about one-eighth of the whole revenue of India was expended upon public works, while the condition of the people waa improving year by year. No one had said what the Government of India should do in the matter of roads which they had not done. What was wanted to promote the growth of cotton in India wascapital and European superintendence. He moved the previous question. On the motion of Sir E. PAmBy, the debate was adjourned till Tuesday next. Lord RAuiNyAIS obtained leave, to bring in a Bill to amend the Act 12th and 13th Victoria, for the more effectual prevention of cruelty to animals. Mr. BLAcK moved a resolution, that the salaries of the Scotch inspectors and surveyors of taxes are inadequate for the duties they have to discharge, and that the remuneration for their servicesshould be placed on the same scale as those of England and Ireland. Mr. WzsoN could not consent to a motion which would impose upon the Hous& a function properly belonging to the departments connected with the revenue of the country. After some remarks by Mr. KINNAnD, lr. CRAUFMInD, and Colonel SYKES, the motion was neg,atived. Mr. G BnIm had leave to bring in a Bill to alter and amend the Railway Trafflic Act. Mr. WAxnEN moved for leave to bring in a Bill to empower the House of Commons and its comi mittees to take evidence upon oath. He notied the distinction-between the evidence as given before the committees of this House and that taken in the other House, where the witnesses *ere more guarded. Lord PnRmxoi had no objection, and leave was given. 1r. MAssay likewise obtained leave to introduce certain Bills, and he withdrew the Highways Bill. The Wills, &c., of British Subjects Abroad Bill was read a second time. The Alehouse Licensing Bill was read a third time and passed. The Charitable Uses Bill passed through oim. mittee. The report of the Committee of Supply Ws brought up'and agreed to. Other B3ills were advanced their respe,b smages, and the House, after some further business, adjourned at about half-past 1 o'clock,.
The House of Commons came to a decision last night to which it may not have given the thought it deserves, and which it may hereafter wish to reverse, but which is of more than usual importance, and has something to be said for it. It has decided by a special vote, and under a distinct understanding as to the meaning of that vote, that the auggestion of a new Park, involving the health, comfort, and ornament of the metropolis, is a purely local, and not a national, affair. A Buccession of members, chiefly country gentlemen, but some of them representing metropolitan districts out of the reach of the proposed Park, objected not to the proposal itself, but to the supposed intention of the Government to contribute a portion of the cost. On the very arguments of the objectors themselves, who complained of the sums already lavished on metropolitan buildings and institutions, the vote against any further step in this direction is a new era. It is a protest on the part of the nation against the metropolis, and a resolution for the future to leave the latter to itself, oA the ground that enough has been done for it already. The fact hitherto has been that this metropolis, like the metropolis of every other country, has received an exceptional and a very mixed treatment, made up partly of favouritism, partly of jealousy, but arising naturally from the idea that the metropolis belongs to the whole people, and ia their commoh meeting-ground. The metropolis has never, to this day, been permitted to govern itself, or to tax itself, like any other municipality; and the reason always alleged is that so great a lo3al power would not be a safe neighbour to the Legislature and the Court. The jealousy his been carried so far in this instance as to give the metropolis, even undee the Reform Act, a share in the representation so ridiculously small for its numbers as rather to pacify remonstrance than satisfy justice. Only the other day did the metropolis receive, for the first time, powers to levy a farthing in the pound for any purpose whatever, and even then under extraordinary limitations. On the other hand, the metropolis-at all events, the West-end and certain other district&has been immensely benefited by natiohal grants, and the expenditure flowing from the aeat of Government and the centre of the fashionable world. Such is the exceptional, or, as it is now called, anomalous system, hitherto supposed and pursued, The House of Commons, in the face of a usage continued up to this very year, has now made a protest against it. As the question is so decided, and the appeal actually made to the metropolis, as represented in the Board of Works, we can only address ourselves to the latter. Wo advise them to accept the decision, inconvenient as it may be, and vexatious as it may seem. It certainly is high time to relieve the Legislature as much as possible of all merely local afairs, and particularly of metropolitan business. Parliament has shown a wish to let the metropolis govern itself by the creation of the Board; and, if the powers of that Board are not ample enough, Parliament can no longer hesitate to supply. that defect. The metropolis on the whole, and in all its parts, has not profited so much by the presence of the Legislature and the Court in the city of Westminster as that it should wish to be still a mere appendage of the State, divided and governed by a superior power, and the object of its precarious bounties. It has every reason for wishing to be independent-that is, in the same sense that any other town is; governing itself, taxing itself, and deciding for itself, within the same limitations as other towns, for what objects to tax its citizens. The reign of anomalies is passing away. We have destroyed class interests. We are waging war with religious exclusions. We have swept away many Parliamentary inequalities, and next year we axe to attack the remainder. The metropolis itRelf expects to be represented more in proportion to its numbers. So let there be an end of -etropolitan favouritism. Let London henceforth be a locality. The Board of Works has only to adopt this view, and proceed with the Bill without the expected subsidy, and no doubt it will receive an adequate enlargement of its powers. We should be sorry a Session should be lost, for it was but the otner day we had before us the plan of a Park containing 500 acres, with an entrance at King's-cross, and costing no more than the humbler project which now is all that can be hoped for. Let the Board of Works trust in itself and in the cause of this great metropolis, and we have no doubt it wil soon find itself all the more comfortable for not having to hang about the Home-office, bargain with the Treasury, and canvass the House of Commons.
We observed the other day that the best method of escaping a financial dead lock was to be found, probably, in such a reduction of old sources of expenditure as would leave a reasonable margin for the pressure of new obligations. That these obligations should present themselves is, we fear, a matter oh necessity. The nxaturalcourse of ever.ts in a country like Oura will birMb1' zib, s'ch' a result to - pass, norcl do 'we see ;'i -d _ -stive is, to ba discovered betwewr - I tX ,.iid timely economy when we com7a 4''- the adjustment of the balance. Unhappily tn! growth at one erid of the account is a good deal more perceptible thau the decay at the other, and ar we scan the successive debates upon Supply we fail to descry the abatements of which we are in search. Yet our Parliamentary report of yesterday contained one or two promising topics-topics suggestive of a possible equilibrium between ebb and flow. From this desirable category we are afraid we must except the New Houses of Parliament. To be sure, the public outlay in this branch ought to be drawing to a close, and. the completion of the structure would be equivalent to the saving of a good round sum annually. But, what wifh one I thing and what 'with another, the prospect appears hopeless. Sir B. fLL could not even pretend to answer the plain inquiry of Mr. W. WimiAms, " when it was probable that " the expenditure upon the Houses of Parlia" ment would cease," and the question, in fact, provoked a laugb. Then it has become evident, as Mr. HENLEY remarked, " even upon a casual "inspection, that the stone was going to pieces in "all directions;" and Sir B Amm acknowledged further that the "rust was certainly showing itelf " in different parts of the roof," so that the cost of repairs is likely enough to begin before the cost of construction has ended. Moreover, there is a huge block of new Public Offices looming in the distance, the estimated charge of which is put at 5,000,0001. Now, if the Houses of Parliament, having been originally computed to cost 2G0,0001., have already cost 2,000,0001., what are we to suppose will be the ultimate expense of the new edifices, which start from a figure twenty times as large? Although, therefore, it was stated in plain words by Lord C. H.SITTow that "if the " House had exercised a proper vigilance over this " expenditure 500,0001. might easily have been "saved," we cannot look withmuch confidence for any reduction under the head of Public Buildings. Two other subjects, however, offer better grounds for hope. Mr. COIRD called attention to the management of the CnoWn estates, and asserted his belief very distinctly that if they were but superintended "with the same prudence as private property, "their net income would be equal to the amount "of the Civil List." Nor did he omit to give reasons for his opinion. The expense of managemeat last year, including the outlay upon buildings and improvements contingent upon such property, was equivalent to 33 per cent. on the total amount of revenue received; and the entire profit realized on 100,000 acres of land " might be said to be " something less than 3s. 10d. an acre." A better margin for improvement could hardly be desired, and one of Mr. CAriDus suggestions pointed in the direction of very comprehensive retrenchment indeed. " There was no occasion," said he, "to "keep up an expensive department, and there " seemed no reason why the whole of the manage"ment of the woods and forests should not be "carried on at an expense of 4,0001. or 5,0001. "a-year." Mr. WILSON s reply, if it did not quite keep pace with these anticipations, at any rate gave some agreeable prospects. The large percentage of outlay was accounted for by the expenditure necessary in bringing unproductive land into profitable condition;, so that as time went on there should be considerable advantages forthcoming in this quarter. Already we are told of an estate let for 2,500g. a-year which four or five years ago was covered with timber of no value whatever. The other matter deserving consideration from this point of view appeared in the short discusaion which ensued upon a votoof 21V,2401. for thePoor Law Commission, and which Sir H. WiLO1uGHBY opened by asking "whether there was any hope "now, after a lapse of nearly 21 years, of reducing "the great expenditure of the present depart"ment, and of arriving at that happy state of things "when thePoorLawCommission might be dispensed "with." It has certainly been. shown by recent events that a superintending authority may find very beneficial occupation in correcting the natural defects of local Boards; but, although pauiperism has been unquestionably on the decline in the United Kingdom, have the establishments charged with the duty of administration in these respects undergone a proportionate reduction ? Sir G. PzcansLLremarked, that the " work done by " the Board generally was very small while the " salaries were very large," and, though we are not aware of the precise difference between the expenses of 1857 and those of 1848, -we think there is no department in which it would be more reasonable to look for reduction than this. Our increased expenditure will probably be based for the most part on the increasing prosperity of the country, on the progress of opinion in various directions, on the advance made by the arts and sciences, and on the greater consideration extended by Government to the several classes of the people. But it ought to be implied, almost necessarily, in these presumptions, that the condition of the aggregate population has been improved; with such improvement should follow the decrease of pauperism, and -with the decrease of pauperism the necessity for those establishments by which the work of relief is superintended. We make these remarks generally, but in Ireland, at any rate, it is certain that pauperism has been actually and largely on the decline. An official Report upon the Administration of the Poor Laws in Ireland represents that the expenditure for the year terminating at Michaehmas, 1855, showed a reduction of 10 per cent. on the year preceding; that 1856 has shown a further reduction of 1G per cent. on 1855, and that " a fur" ther large percentage of reduction" is anticipated in the current year, when balanced against 1856. Surely, under these circumstances, not only Poorrates themselves, but Poor Law establishments of all kinds, ought to show a gradual diminution, and thus leave room for the obligations of another period. We repeat that we do not think the difficulties of the case will ever be successfully met by mere resistance to the new demands which the courge of events is sure to produce. The true policy is to look carefully about and see what has become obsolete or useles-what can be lopped off as fresh charges come on. In private life, though we live, perhaps, on the whole, more expensively thau our forefathers, yet we do not combine the. luxuries of 1857 with the extravagance of 1782, and keep both going together. If some charges have been increased others have been diminished, and we make roomn for fresh calls by discarding the old ones. If we travel more we drink less: and we dress more cheaply if we are better lodged. Perhaps in the public service there may be more Commissions, but there are fewer sinecures; and, though there are additional expenses, there may be better management. This we are convinced is the true direction to be taken in administrative reforms. It may be impossible to refuse a reasonable demand for State interventiou, but it will be easy enough to make provision for the outlay by a reduction of charges which, like all such things, may have a strong inherent vitality, but which time itself has rendered neeless.

She has brought 112,564 dollar specie on freight. On the 14th imst., in lat. 41 N., long. 56, the mizen masthead was struck by lightning, carrying away part of the mast. The TUnited States' mail steamship Ericsson had arrivods at New York. A despatch from New Orleans reports the opeOiing of the Tehuantepec route, vessels having cormenced arriving at Ventosa Bay. Advices from Vera Criz state that extensive operations were in progress there to oppose an Invasion by Spanish troops. The New York money-market did not appear to be affected by the withdrawal of the specie per Arabia, the supply continuing liberal and fully adequate to the limited demand. There was more commercial paper offering than a week previously. Foreign exchange closed firm, hut not very active The average rate for. bankes' bills on L-ndon was Stocks exhibited a better feeling, but prices continued weak and low. R-ailway bonds were again heavy. Cotton continued inactive. Flour was heavy, with holders rather precsing sales. The receipts were light. Wheat was unsettled. Corn was dull.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. meh following appeared in our second edition of yes. teldav:-1 Il:MT ATTmf 4VVN MflRPAPn-PMV, p PARIS, M0oNDAY, JuNz 22, 6 P.3. At half-past 4 o'clock this afternoon the voting terminated in Paris, as throughout France, and at the hour I write the tellers are counting the tickets in aU the Mlairies The result wiU probably not be known with certainty before to-morrow. What may be the case in the depart. ments I cannot say, but so far as Paris is concerned the elections have certainly produced an excitement far greater than any one anticipated. It was, as I have already mentioned, but little felt yes-. terday; but the whole of this day, and partioularly the early part of it, the sovereign people was up and stirring. The right of taking out the voting tickets did not end with the commencement of the ballot; it continued yesterday and up to the last moment to-day, so that, between the crowds who flocked to take out their bulletins and those anxious to deposit them, the Mairies and the other voting-places were crowded to the utmost. The recommendation that had been given to the working classes to proceed en masse teday rather than yesterday was observed punictually. I proceed to give you the result of my obaervations during a hurried visit to the various polling booths up to 2 o'clock. In the first and second arrondissements the excitement was very considerable. This is not to be wondered at, as the population of the one amounts to 112,000? and of the other to 114,000 inhabitants. The third arrondissement comprises a population of at least 65,000 souls. It is the centre of commerce, the haitt comamerce, the extensive dealers in the fabrics of Mulhouse and Rouen, manufacturers of shawls, &c. It is also the headquarters of what may be termed the Opposition bourgeoisie, the class who have been at all times disposed to give a " lesson" to the Government, whether that Government be Republican, Royalist, or Inperialist, Liberal or illiberal, Constitutional or the reverse. The bourgeois of this arrondissement are by temperament and taste frcmcieurs par excellence. Though none have suffered more severely by revolution, though none are less Republican, nevertheless, from the symptoms which were apparent to-day, I should not bs at all surprised if General Cnvaignac obtained a majority of votes in this arrondissemnent. The fifth arrondissement contains a population of about 97,000 inhabitants, the greater part of whom are manufacturers of the art dcles de Paris, copper and iron founders, lookingglass-makers, cartwrrights, harnessmakers, &c. In this arrondissement there was great activity. In the sicth arrondissement, of about 70,000 the same continuous movement was visible. N'early the whole population is composed of the working classes. The men were on foot from an early hour, and with hardly an intermission they crowded to the Mairies in their shirt sleeves, with bare arms, in sabots-in fact, in their working dress, as they left the workshops-a sieglig6 the most negligent. They exercised their sovereignty in the most unceremonious manner, and it was evident that they had not forgotten the sans fagen habits of 1848. the eighth arrondissement contains a population of about 114,000. The Faubourg St. Antoine precented a most animated aspect. The workmen issued in groups from the winehouses to the votingplaces the whole of the day, and many seemed to be all the better, or rather all the worse, for their libations. So far as personal appearance went, they were pretty much in the same state as their friends of the sixth arrondissement. It is in the eighth arrondicsement that are found in the greatest number the partisans of the Democratic and Socialist Republic -men after M. Louis Blanc's own heart. In the ninth arrondissement the movement was not remarkable up to 12 o'clock. The principal feature was the number of ecclesiastics proceeding to deposit their votes in the urn. In this quarter of Paris chiefy reside the manufacturers of sacerdotal vestments, sacred vessels, and church ornaments. In the tenth arrondissement, which is one of the most extensive of the capital, the animation was less relatively to the population, which is about 115,000. The twelfth is one of the most extensive and the poorest of the capital. It is the seat of the corporation of itinerant ragmen. It is there that the highly " doctored" eau-de-vie finds its most numerous and devoted consumers; and from all that could be seen alcohol played a considerable part in the electoral movement of the qcuarter this morning, as several of these worthy citizens exhibited so much eccentricity in their demeanour that they had to be ejected summarily from the voting-room. In this quarter also a good number of ecclesiastics voted. In aluding to the eighth Ishould observe that in many cases the difference of calling seems to influence their political tendencies. For instance, the ornamental papermakers, cabinetmakers, metal founders, and enginemakers, wiU have most probably voted against the Government candidate; the market gardeners rather in favour ; the coppersmiths (who are, I believe, mrincipally from Auvergne) the same; the dealers in old ironware rather divided; but the journeymen brewers generaUy favourable. On Saturday and yesterday additional carriages were put on to the trains, for the considerable numbers who are located in the country, in the neighbourhood of Paris, and who were coming in to vote. The following circular was sent round last evening from the Hotel de Ville to many of the electors who had not as yet taken out their tickets:- "Prefecture of the Department of the Seine, Paris, June 21. "Sir,-The elections for doputies to the LegislativeoBody commenced this day. "E Each person is at liberty to exeroise or not the rights which the Constitution confers on him Now, as certain parties have systematicaUy advocated abstaining from the vote, many electors would,perhaps, regret being involuntarily associated with them, either through forgetfulness or in consequence of their occupations. I therefore take the liberty of reminding you that the voting will remain open to-morrow (Monday) from 8 o'clock in the morning till 4 in the afternoon. " Receive, Sir, &o., " G. E. IRAUSSMAINN, Prefect of the Seine." The counting of the tickets in the 110 sections of Paris, which began at 4 o'clock, when the voting terminated, will not be completed till a late hour. I may add that, though the electoral excitement has been greater than any one supposed, everything, so far as I have been able to ascertain, was carried on tranquilly. The Emperor leaves on an early day for Plombiures. He intends spending his time there in the most tranquil and retired manner. Tents and marquees have been already sent. M. Mocquard (private secretary), the Prince de la Tour d'Auvergne, and General Fleury accompany him. The trade of Paris is in much the same position it was in a week since. The shopkeepers are doing a I trifling business, and the wholesale houses receive from time to time some insignificant orders from the I provinces. A few purchasers have made their ap-i pearance for the fair of Beaucaire, which will commence nex' month. Some surprise is expressed that there are so few buyers for the United States in the market, as the last accounts from New York announce that the importations there had fallen to one-half the usual average during the months of April and May last, ard that the stock of French goods in store is nearly exhausted. The official an- | noug0e0nent of the signature of a treaty of cox-a merce between the French and Russian Govern- ments, and the important modifications which the, Rpuisan Government proposes to introduce into the' Imperial Customs' tariff, are expeted to give afresh impulse to the exportation oE French produce to Russia. The demand from St. Petersburg, which was considerable for a few months after the conclusion of peace, had again fallen ofin consequence of the exorbitant duties imposed on French manufactured gooda on their arrival in Russia. The silk crop is sufficiently advanced in the south of France for the growers to be certain that it will be more productive than last year. M. Dumas, who was commissioned by the Academy of Sciences to investigate the causes of the disease which destroyed so many silkworms last year, and to discover a means of removing it, proceeded to Alais last month for the purpose of minutely examining the state of matters HIe has since communicated to the Academy the resulta of his observations. M. Dumas has discovered that all the reports relative to the leaves of the mulberry trees being diseased are unfounded. The leaves throughout the south this year are splendid, andwheretheeggs are sound the resulta have been most satisfactory. M. Dumas states that the eggs produced in France, Spain, Piedmont, and lombazdy haFve in tenersI failed, as wrell as many of those imported from the Eat, but it is suspeete tlbat the lattbr wereo produced in infeoti coulstries and sent to the st to B6 Id aB if proa nod-theii: The eggs from Adrianople, Lebanon, and the Roman States were remarkably successful. When.. ever M. Dumas could ascertain the origin of the Bound eggs he universally found that they were produced in a mountainous country-that is,in pure air frequently renewed, and that the silkworms were fed on mulberry trees grown in elevated situations. One fact demonstrates what influence an elevated situation exercises on the health of the silkworm. M. Dumas found an intelligent breeder of silkworms, named Etienne, living on the small mountain of St. Germain, near Alais. Four years since he used eggs brought from Italy, and his success was comrplete. While all the silkworms bred inthe low grounds died, he again succeeded, and even last year he produced a quantity of eggs sufficient for himself and for several other breeders. His success and that of the other breeders who made use of his eggs was so great that at this moment the entire country is astonished at it. M. Dumas says in conclusion, that this year the breeders have tr!ed every description of egg and every system. They were favoured by admirable spring weather and faultless mulberry leaves. It may be expected, therefore, that next year, if the weather should prove favourable,the experience now gained will enable the breeders to resume the course of their ancient prosperity. The Paris corn-market, as weeU as those in the departments, is excewsively quiet. Everybody is convinced that the farmers have stil in their barns a sufficient qnantity of corn to last until the approaching harvest, but the markets are not oversupplied, and that prevents prices falling as low as might be expected. The corn crops are already ripe in the south of France, Italy, and Algeria. Some samples of corn have already been received from Algeria, but no arrivals thence can be depended on before the end of niext month sufficient to produce a favourable influence on the French markets. The price of flour in Paris has not varied for the last eight days. The nominal price of the best marks is 74f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes, but no great quantity could find buyers at more than 73f. o0c. Oats are everywhere rising. They are quoted in Paris at 34f. the 150 kilogrammes. It is the only crop which suffered from the dry weather, and only a moderate return is expected. Rye is offered at a reduction of If. 50c. per 116 kilogrammes. Barley has likewise fallen 70c. the hectoltre. The sale of wine is dull at Bercy, and still there is no reduction in prices. The approaching vintage is watched with anxiety. It is 20 years since the vineyards promised so well at this season of the year. The blossoming has commenced throughout the south under the most favourable auspices. The appearance of the oidium is spoken of in some localities but the vinedrewsers are prepared to resist it with energy. Wines of superior quality ae nevertheless exorbitantly dear in the south. There are some proprietors who will not sell the little stocks they have in their cellars on any terms. There is a slight reduction in the price of ordinary wine at Bordeaux, and in the principal towns of Languedoc. The arrival of Spanish wine at Cette, which had diminished for a time, has again considerably increased. From the 6th to the 8th of June 12 ships laden with wine arrived from Spanish ports, to add to the considerable stock of various wines collected at Cette. There has been a slight decline in the price of beetroot spirits inParis. Beetroot spirits of 36 degrees strength are quoted at from 116f. to 118f. the hectolitre.

I alluded in my last letter to an agitation which has commenced in Bulgaria. Although of no great importance at the present moment, it deserves to be noticed-first, because its immediate object Is the redress of a grievance; and next because even this small beginning indicates the direction which the spirit of the population in that part is taking, and the influences which are busy in fostering it. It is well known that while the Russian troops occupied the left bank of the Danube during the late war, but more especially during the siege of Silistria, every effort was made to induce the Bulgarians to rise. These attempts failed, in spite of a number ofactive emissaries, who had been sent there even before the beginning of hostilities; the only result produced was, that a few hundreds were induced to join the Russo-Greek Legion, and that a number of families from the districts occupied by the Russian troops followed them after their retreat, and expatriatedthemselves. But,if theRussiantroops retired from Bulgaria, the emissaries found means of remaining in the Turkish dominions south of the Danube, as was shown when some well known persons reappeared at the end of the war, to everybody's astonlishment, in Constantinople, coming not from Russia, but from the interlor of European Turkey. Yet even without this it would have been easy to guess where they had passed their time, for very soon after the Treaty of Paris was signed it became known that, encouraged by the stipulations which the Western Powers had made for the Danubian provinces, the Bulgarians hoped to interest them in their own fate, and to obtain through their mediation an independent internal administration under a native prince. A petition to this effect was to be presented to the Porte, as well as to the representatives of the foreign Powers at Constantinople, but it was too great a step to be practicable, and it would very likely never have occurred to the inhabitants themselves, who have been too effectually subjected to the central Government to have kept anything but a vague tradition of their former independence. Their voice was so feeble that it was scarcely heard, and the scheme failed; but the idea which prompted it has not been abandoned for all that, and appears now under a more moderate and practical shape. Instead of an independent civil administration, a national church government is now demanded, and a number of petitions from Bulgarian communities have been presented to the Porte complaining against the higher clergy sent there from Constantinople, and against their endeavours to suppress the Slavonic language in the liturgy, and to introduce the Greek language instead. In order fully to understand the tendency of this step, I must remind your readers of a thing which is very often overlooked, if not forgotten, in Europe; namely that the immense majority of the Christians of the 6riental Church in European Turkey are not Greeks by race or language. indeed, out of the 10,000,000 belonging to that religion in European Turkey only 1,000,000 are Greeks ; of the rest 4,000,000 are Rounians, in Wallachia and Moldavia, less than 3,000,000 Armenians, and all the rest are either Slaves by race or have become Slavonians in the course of time. Of this number the Bulgars are rather more than 3,000,000. With the exception of the neans and 1,000,000 of Servians, who constitutedthemselves as early as the 14th century into a national church, aUl the Christians of the Oriental Church are under the spiritual rule of the Greek Patriarch and his Synod at Constantinople. The conquest of the Turks, instead of taking away from the power of the Patriarchs, rather increased it by adding considerable temporal to their spiritual power. They were fully aware of the advantages which would be derived from an arrangement by 'which they had such a hold over the great number of their non-3ahomedan subjects. The centralization of the Church Government at Constantinople became by degrees the means of establishing a kind of oligarchy in fivour of a small number of Fana- riote failies, whose members have been now for centuries in posseesion of the thunders as well as rich benefices of the Oriental Church. All bishops and higher Church dignitaries are lnvariably chosen from among these few privileged families, while the inferior clergy alone, who have no chance of rising toa higherscale in the hierarchy, are chosen by the inhabitantsof the provinces. Hlence there la all over the provinces a standing feud between the higher clergy of the Oriental Church, acting under the inspira- tion of the Synod and the Patriarch of Constantinople,' and the lower clergy, whose members are little better than the flocks committed to their charge. This feud is naturally greatest where the language of the people is not Greek, which is the case in Bulgaria. Not only have the G(reek bishops, who scarcely ever know a word of Bulgarian, no direct communication with their flocks, over whose proprt aad peron their i ei90n ex tends, but even with the meamera of the inferior clergy, who know just enough Greek to read, but not to understand, the liturgy, ,and can only speak it through interpreters. This state of things has been long a matter of grievance, but recently the Bu]garians think that they havs found an additional aubject of grievance. They complain that the bishops try to introduce the Greek language into the liturgy instead of the Slavonic, in which the service was hitherto in most places performed. In consequence of the petitions presented, a Turkish Commiesioner was sent there to ascertain the trutb, and, according to his report; there has been no violence applied in forcing on-the Bulgarians the Greek language, either in church or school. Of course it is difficult to ascertain the truth in such matters,- but the probabilty3 i that the Greek language has crept inin many places in. observed by the people, who follow more the external forms than the spirit of prayer during divine service, and that now those who have an intereat ia the fate of those who speak the Slavonic lapguaga have directed the attention of the Bulaarians to this quiet Rellenizing process, which has leen going'on by meas of the Church.. If there is real ground for complaint, it would be good policy in the Turks to removeit, for it ought to be remembered that the high Greek clergy, whose power formerly was advantageous to the Turkish Government, might use some day or other this same power, if it is unchecked, for purposew rather in opposition to the interests of the Government. Five of the steamers which have been ord6red In England for the Rusian Imperial Steam Na. vigation Company have pased through the Bosphorus to Odessa, and one of them has come back already on her trial trip. From the specimen which was here a few days ago, there ought to be no great apprehension about them; they are, on an average, of 700 tons, built of iron and would not be capable of carrying a gun of any size. Of course, they might carry- troops; but how can the building of such ships be prevented.? The first lne on which these steamers will run will be that of Constantinople and the Black Sea, where an active competition is threatening the Austrian Lloyd's, not only from that side, but likewise from that of the French Messegeries Inzdrideal. These latter have already begun to run on the Galatz line; and henceforth there wiMP' be a steamer of this compny every Tuesday. The company is, besides, making preparations for the Sinope and Trebizonde lines, as well as for that of Salonica and Volo. Everybody is rejoicing here at this competition, as it will do away with the most obnoxious monopoly which can be conceived. The formation oE the. Native Bank has been delayed. All artangemena wrere to have been made on Wednesday lasi and, the subscriptions opened, but the, meeting has been deferred until to-morrow. In the meantinn all trade and money transactions are at a standstill, for everybody is anxious to await the result of this new combination.
RAILWAY AND MINING SRARES. Tueaday Evening. The railway-market has been quiet to-day, and prices show no material alteration. IDulness has been the general cbamactkrlstic of business, owing to the temporary 'cessation of speculation. In banking, ining, and miscellanaeous there was a fair number of transaationls at steady prices.. OSDflNAY Sl}AUE8: MID SrOa
dfONKY-MARBBTadWITYIKTEBLLGBNtq Tusay Evening. The quotation of gold at Pari4 is about 4 per mule premium, and the short exchange on London is 2a.25per . sterling. OnHcotprinothese rates with the English shint price of 3t. 17a. 10od per ounce for standard gold it appear that gold is about 1-10th per cent. dearer ia Paris than in Loindon. BY advlces from Hamburg the price of gold is 423kpermark, andthe short exchange on Ldondon is 13.4 noer l1. sterling. Standard gold at the English Minb^price is therefore about 1-10th per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in Ljondon. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 109i per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is lightly in favour of England; and, after malking allowance for charges of transport and difference of interept, the present rate leaves a small profit on the importation of gold from the United States. The funds remain without animation, and the atagnation of business in the Stock-Exchange is such as is rarely witnessed until the autumn. Consols for the 9th of July have stood throughout the day at the closing price of last evening-93t to i ec dividend. Money was in demand on Government securities at the Bank minimum.rate of 6 per cent., and it was said that some moderate amounts were required to pay offE loans lately advancedby the East Itidia Company. Bank Stock closed at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92i to 93 * New Threeper Cents., 93 Exchequer Bonds, 98Sto *; India Bonds, 8x to 5s. discount; and Exchequer Bills, 3s. discount to par. In the discount-market and at the Bank of England, the demand for money to-day was.extremely active. This, however, is necessarily the case at the present period of the quarter, when large amounts are absorbed at the Bank on account of revenue payments. Scarcity being thus created in the open market, there is, of course, no remedy for it except in the shape of increased advances and loaus from that establishment. i Foreign securities were heavy, at a further slight decline. In Turkish Six per Cents. the transactio"s were at 951 ; for the account, 96i; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 102; Danish Five per Cents., 102; EcuadorNew Consolidated, 14; Portuguese Three per Cents., for the account, 47; Sardinian. Five per Cents., for the account, 89i; Spanish Three per Cents., 42 ; and Duteh Two-anda- per Cents., 65g. In the foreign exchanges the rates on the whole may be considered the same as last year. The final quotalions of the French Tnree per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. Wc. for money, and 68f. 65e. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eighth. About 70,0001. out of the gold brought from New York by the Arabia was sold to the Bank to-day. The Washington is expected on Friday with a further supply, both on French and English account. lFromtheannouncementof theVice-president of the Board of Trade in the House of Commons last night it appears that the new Government Bill for amendidg the law of joint-stock banks, while it will simplify all the general requiremeusts connected with this class of public companies by bringing them into harmony with those relating to other undertakings, willstill leave them with an exceptional feature by the denial of limited liability. The continuance of this anomaly, howvever, seems not to be the fault of the Governmnent, but rather a necesary sacrifice to prejudices to which it would be usele3s at present to run counter. With a single exception, each of the various remarks upon the subject addressed to the House laxt night went to show the evils of the existing system. No one pretends to deny that if there is one description of business more than another which it is desirable should be thrown exclusively into the hands of prudent and wealthy persons it is that of banking, and that the direct effect of the law which renders all the partners in banking companies liable to their last shilling and their last acre is to deter all who are remarkable for great wealth and great caution from having anything to do with them. In place of a Board of direction and a proprietary whose very names would be a guarantee for vigilance and honour, we have occasionally, as in the csse of almost all those jointstock banks which have failed, a reckless set of managers and a needyproprietary, thevalue of whose unlimited liability is found, when brought to a test, after tedious andexpensive law proceedings and compromises, to be in reality very limited indeed. The publicaredeluded, therefore, by afanciedsecurityinto trusting a class of men who are not entitled to conafdence, and deprived of the services of those who are best fitted to control such institutions and give a tone to the financial business of the country. They are also taught to rely upon legal and artificial precantions, instead of upon the exercise of their own intelHgence. Yet, in the face of these circumstances, and also of the great fact that the banking establishment whose name throughout the world is a synonym for safety and solidity has furnished an example from Its foundation down to this day-a period of more than a century and a half-of the effects of the opposite plan, it is probable that some years must yet elapse before the Legislature will be induced to take a broader view of the question than that which now prevails. The chief argument to justify the incongruity of a different law for banking companies from that of other joint-stock undertaldngs is that extra precautions are required for all concerns dealing with money. But, in the first place, any precautions which are good in one case 3must be good in others, even if they are not so vitally essential; and, in the next, it is a mere fallacy to speak of a bank being especially distinguished in the character of its liabilities from any otter trading corporation. If they do not all deal in money, they all deal in money's worth, and it does not make much difference to a creditor in the case of failure whether his claim arises from his having trusted the company with 100,000 sovereigns or with a thousand bales of silk, or any other commodity worth 100,000 sovereigns in the market. The law, if it stands, therefore, must be permitted to stand as an instance of the self-defeating operation of blind timidity. It is true that one member last night stood upon the ground " that the principle of limited liability is vicious in itself, and is opposed to the maxim that the man who enters into trade aud gets more than the reoular rate of interest should be held responsible for his liabilities." Happily, however, all discussion as to the correctness of the princilpe of limited liability has been set at rest. The only point now is whether banks are to constitute an exception. As to the doctuine about a man being re3ponsible for his liabilities, it has nothing to do with the matter. Every man, whether in banks or anything else, should be responsible for his liabilities to the uttermost farthing. What is insisted upon is that if a man wishes to borrow money or undertakes any other transaetion upon the public stipulation that his liability in so doing shall be distinctly defined within certain limits, and another man is ready and anxious to deal with him on those terms, the State should not interfere in the matter by interposing a rohibition on the paternal ground that it would not ae safe to leave individuals to the free exercise of their own judgment as to the conditions and extent to which they will repose trust in others. They may trnst, says the prohibitive law, a penni- less adventurer to any amount, with the guarantee of hia unlimited liability; but, whatever may be their inclination, they must not trust an honest and wealthy man who offers them certain advantages upon the stipulation that under certain circumstances they shall not call upon him for more than a specified sum. At a meeting of the South Australian Bankindg Company, held to-day, Mfr. E. Divett presiding, the dividend declared was at the rate of 12 per cent. per annum, free of inecome-tax, and the report anad accounts were unanimously adopted. In answer to questions it was stated that the directors are under no advances, that the wecuritieshave been examined and found correct, and that the reeerve-fund is invested in Government and colonial guaranteed stocks or bonds. The general explanations were received as satisfactory, and the proposal for raising additional capital, owing toa general increase of business, was agreed to. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- " The condition of South Australia during the pat year has been such as to require increased caution in the manage. mert of the company's affairs.

LAW vEPOnT VICE-CHANCBLLORCiCT9UTT .TmT-V 92 INNES V. YITCTrTTT. I1.fore VtCC (:&aYceuor Sir PI 'r. KINDElRSL1Y.- Mr. BAILY and Mr. CoTroy moved in this case, which Las been very recently before the public and fully reported in The imes, that the order serving certain parties (de. fendants) out of the jurisdiction might be discharged. It wiU be remembered that the plaintifti, who are resident in England, claim property to the amount of nearly 700 OOOl. as the heirs and next of kin of a lady named Jane Innes, who made a testamentary trust disposition in the Scotch form, leaving all the property in question to trustees upon trust as she should appoint, and, in default, to her nearest heird and executors whomsoever. The defendants, claiming to be such nearest heirs and next of kin, were duly, by proceedings in the Scotch Courts, put into possession of the real and personal estate without the knowledge of the plaintiff, as they alleged, or, as they also alleged, snch proceedings as were requisite, in the way of advertisement or otherwise, to enab[e prties claiming adversely to come in. This bill was tneon fied, charging every species of fraud anainst the defendants Alexander Mitchell nud William Mtchell, and a breach of trust against the trustees, and praying accordingly and for an account. This bill was demurred to, both for want of equity and orc tenus, but both demurrers were overruled, not deciding the question of jurisdiction as to dealing with the Scotch instrument and Scotch property, but that fraud being charged against both defendants, and it not being certain that some relief could not be given at the hearing, the demurrers could not be sustained. An order was made to serve some of the defendants who were domiciled in Scotland, and therefore out of the jurisdiction, such order heinm upor an ordinary ex parte motion under the 33d order of M'ay, 1845, and it was now asked that stch order might be discharged, on the ground that another suit was pending in Scotland by a person named Simpson, who claimed three-fourths of the testatrix's personalty, such claim involving the same question as was here pending, the defendants claiming as first cousin twice removed, and Simpson as first cousin once removed. The question was a very import-ant one-namely, whether a party in England could bering ito this country a suit properly a Scotch one, Scot. land being for such purpose the same as any other foreign country. Mr. ANncBSOw and Mr. MKILLER opposed the motion, contending that the Court would stultify itself if it granted this motion, for, although a discretion was given, the order, vhich was made to remedy a want of jastice, would be neutralized. Moreover, the question in the Scotch suit did not touch this case, which rested on the assumption that neither party (the defendants and Simpson) were entitled, hlr. BAILY was heard in reply. The Vic&CHiAsnELonL said, that the granting of the order in question was discretionary, and of that, looking at the Acts of Parliament relating to the service, there was not the least doubt. The order of May, 1845, stood on the same footing. But there were many cases, and this was one, in which it was impossible, on an ecx parte application for the order, to judge of the merits, and therefore the Court granted the order, and its leaning ought to be to grant sueo an order. There might be difficulty and inconvenience in exercising the discretion, but that was no reason why it should not be exercised, and if the order were improperly made there was no reason why it should not be discharged; indeed, the cases went to that. The defendants' was a strong case, every feature being Scotch; but the plaintiffs' case very much varied that, for they were Englishmen, residing here, and happening to have Scotch relations, who had more than half a million of money in the English funds, and on that he was bound to decide the question. His Honour then referred to the case as made by the bill and said that there being so large a property acnaUy in the Bank of England, under an 1nglish probate whereby the executor had submitted to account here, the plaintiffs claimed as legatees, and it could not beaidthat they could not have a remedy here, although the Courts of Scotland might be a proper tribunal, and moreover as the Courts of Scotland did not give discovery on oath, that was a reason why this Court could better deal with the question; baving also jurisdiction over the Bank of England, which the Scotch Courts had not. The Scotch suit did not prevent the plaintiffs having the relief he asked; this motion must, therefore, be refused without costs. (Before ce. Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) Numerous motions occupied the attention of the Court to-day, but they were not of the slightest interest either to the profession or the public.
V(rnpr oi O(TT .wvVQ Rmnrt -- - 'rAVT.PR v --. (Skuingo at Mai Prius, before nd Special Juries.) Mr. EL Chambers, Mr. Joyce, audMr. G. Tayler were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill and Mr. Unthank for the defendant. This was an action of trover to recover possession of the dock warrants for seven hogsheads of brandy. The defendant pleaded " not guilty," and that the warrants were not the property of the plaintiff. It appeared that the plaintiff carries on buiness as a wine and spirit merchant at the Coal-exchange vaults. In the month of October last a person named Reichloser ap. plied to a Mr. Osborn to sell seven hogsheads of brandy, the warrants for which were in the possession of the defendant, who is a spirit-broker in Eart-street, Mark-lane. Osborn applied to the plaintiff, who agreed to buy the brandy if Reichloser would take some wine in part payment. Reich. loser, consented to do so. The plaintiff then applied to defendant, who stated he would give up the warrants on receiving the amount of his advance8. On that understanding plaintiff agreed to purchase the seven hop beads. On the 20th of October Reichloser called at plain. tiff's office. He was not there, but the purchase was conmpleted by Osborn. The plaintiff afterwards asked defend. ant to try and sell the brandy for him. Defendant agreed to do so, and several interviews took place between them. About a week after the sale defendant sent for the plaintiff and informed him that the brandy had been stopped by the Wine Growing Company, whose property it originally had been, and that he could not deliver it up without an in. demnity. This plaintiff declined to give, but tendered the amount of defendant's advances, whinc was refused, and the warrants were handed over to the agents of the Wine Growing Company, who had indemnified defendant. The invoice pnce of the brandy was 1931. Os. 6d. The plaintiff denied having had any previous knowledge of Reichloser. In support of the plaintiff's evidence Mr. Osborn was called. Hle stated he knew nothing of Relchloser until he was introduced to him for this transaction. When Rtechloser called on him to complete the sale, he sent a person named Opady to the defendant to ascertain what the amount of his advances was. Opady brought back a memorandum, stating the amount to be 1281. 13s. 7d. Before paying over the money, however, he went himself to the defendanfs office, and asked, " Was it all right?" and it was only on the assurance to that effect of the defendant that he paid over the money. The defence set up was, that the warrants had been obtained by fraud from the Wine Growing Company, and had come into the possession of the plaintiff under circumstances which could not give him atitle against the real owner. It appeared that the Wine GrowiDg Company were represented in this country by Messrs. Ruth and Co. ; Messrs. Howes and Edwards acted as their brokers. They had also a sort of general agent, a Mr. D'Aillee, who, however, never interfered in the sales. He had in his office a young lad of about 16 years of age named Reichloser, the son of the party who had sold the brandy to tho plaintiff. Some time since Mr. D'Alllee had occasion to go to America, and left hi8 offico in charge of this boy, with instructions to forward his letters and papers and to refer all customers to Messrs. Howes and Edwards. The boy managed to get possession of two warrants from Messrs. Huth and Co., which he filled up with his own name. He got another from Messrs. Howes and Edwards in favour of Mr. D'Aillee, whose name he forged to the delverv paper. He gave the orders to his father, who got an introduction to the defendant and obtained the advances from him in the regular course of his business. Reichloser represented he was in the trade, but it turned out he was a tailor. Some time after he took anotber warrant to the defendant, but his suspicions were excited by the fact that the brandy was a rocent importation; ho communicated with MIessrs. Howes and Ed. wards, and a short investigation led to the discovery of the young Reichloser's frauds; he and his father had since absconded. The Wine Company being satisfied that the defendant had acted bond lide they paid the amount of his advances, and now defended this action. Lord CMNIPBELL said, that the question for the jury was whether the plaintiff's purchase of the brandy was a band fide one. The Wine Company had been defrauded, but under such circumstances as would bind them if the plaintiff was a bond fide purchaser. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff; damages, 6W. 4s. Ilid. His LoRmscip refused to stay execution. ROBINS V. ?ERRY. Mr. Wilde and Mr. Garth were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill and Mr. Phipson for the defendant. This action was brought to try whether the district board of works were empowered, under the Metropolis Local Management Act, to compel the plaintiff to remove a house which he had lately erected in Queen's-road, Bayswater, and which, they alleged, encroached on the regular line of the street. After the case had been partially opened, at the sggestion of his LORDSHIP, who said an important question arose on the construction of the Act, the matter was agreed to be turned into a special oase. Verdict for the plaintiff, subject to a special case. (Before a Common Jury.) LUDLOW V. TE4 BASTERLR COUNTIES RAILWAY COXPFNy. Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Hawkins were counsel for the plaintiff; MIr. Bovill, Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, and Mr. B nebby for the defendants. This action was brought th recover compensation for in. juries sustained by the plaintiff through the negligence of the defendants' servants. Defendants had pald flO(. into court. Mr. E. JAMES, in opening the -* se for the plaintiff, stated that the defendants by payimg -o ney into court had admnitted that their negligence had caused the accldent which ccurred at the Stratford station on the 17th of October, and. the only question for the jury was the amount of compenBation which the plaintiff, who was a gentleman in a very eatensivo way of business, was entitled to receive for the very serious injuries he had sustained, and from the effects of which he would never completely recover. Mr. Fleming, a gentleman connected with a morning taper, stated he had known the plaintiff for some years. He ad formerly carried on a large business in Oxford-street, ed afterwards opened a large establiBshment in Colchester. He was a most active and energetic man, bat was so changed y the accident that his friends could not recognize him, His memory had suffered very much. Cro8sscxaniined.-He had not seen anything of the plaintiff for tho 12 nonths preceding the accident, and knew notlsing of his eironstaves for that period. He bad assisted plaintiff in getting up this action, and had received 101. for is expenses in going to Chatham and other places in reference to this matter. He bad not got any portion of the 6001., nor did he expect any of the further damages. Plaintiff had compounded with his creditors at Colchester in December, 185a. Plaintiff had an office in Belle Sauvageo yard, called the London and Essex Labour office. Mr. Allaston, surgeon at Sydenbam, was caUed in to see the plaintiff on the 19th of April last. Pijintiff was lying on hia Back in a state of great alarm and agitation, and complained of a great pain in the head and numbuess of the right side. The symptoms of the plaintiff were such as would be produced if he had received a concuEsion of the spine in the previous October. Cross-examined.-An injury to the spine does occasionally nOt display itself for some time after the accident. Mr. Ludlow, the plaintiff, was then called.-He said he was now in no business. At the time of the accident he was a clothoing contractor at Chatham. On the 17th of Obtoher he was com'ing up the defendants' line from Tilbury. At the Stratford statonla collision took place, and his head was knocked agis the side of the carriage. HEo was rendered ineansible He went home to his house in the 'Wand&worth-road. A Mrr. Jones was called in, and bn his recommendation he went to Brighton. He has since been unable to attend to any business. He suffers from extreme nervousness. Cross-examined.-He resided in Jersey from 1842 to 1847. He carried on no business there. He then went to Dublin, and established a shirt manufactory. He afterwards established a business in Colchester,:which he carried on till the early part of last year. He compounded 'with his creditors in 1865. His debts were about 7001. He paid some I0s., and others 13s. in the pound. He then established an office in the Belle Sauvage yard. Ho realized enough to pay off all his creditors in full, with one or two exceptions. He afterwards went to the Wandsworth-road, and remained there until January of this year. He did not tailthere. He had known Mr. Fleming for some years, but he had taken no part in getting up this caEe, and he had'not paid him any monev Re-examined.-At the time of the accident he could make more than 5001. or 6001. a-year. Cross-examined.-He then had 951., and did not owe more than 501. He walked bome to the Wandsworth-road after the accident. At the conclusion of this witness's evidence the further hearing of the case was adjourned to this morning. (Sittings in Banco, after Term, before Mr. Justice CoLE- RIDGE, Mfr. Justice WIGITMAN, Mr. Tustice ERLE, and Mr. Justice CROMwITow.) The COtURT sat in Banco this day and proceeded with the cases in the special paper. TnE NATOR OF COLCHESTER V. PRESTNEY AND OTHERS. This was an action brought to try the right of the defend. ants, as individual burgesees of the borough of Colohester, to dredge for oysters at all times, and without restriction, in the river Colne, within the limits of the fishery granted to the burgesses by a charter of Richard I. The question depended on the construction of ancient charters, some of them in Latin, and was of itself of little interest to the public; but, notwithstanding this, the Court was crowded with eager spectators, if not listeners, during the argument. This was owng to the circumstance that the learned counsel, Mr. Havens. who argued the case for the defendants (and who, we believe, was a candidate for Colchester at the last election), appeared in court with what is a most unusual ornament in Westminster-hall-viz., a long flowing moustache and beard. The learned gentleman's beard was of a length and consistency such as no Crimean hero whom we have seen could boast of ; and its dark brown colour contrasted rather strongly with the snowy white. ness of the learned gentleman's wi. Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. R. E. Turner, appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Havens and Mr. Lush for the defendants. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE said, it was quite clear that judgment ought to be given for the plaintiffs. The corporate body had exercised the right for many centuries, and there had been no exercise of the right now claimed by iridividual corporators. The word '-all" in the charter was relied upon by the defendants; but his lordship thought that the word did not conclusively apply to individuals so as to override the universal usage during so long a period. The usage, too, had both law and reason in its favour, for it was difflicult to see how the right set up by the defendants could be exercised. The other Judges expressed similar opinions. Judgment for the plaintiffs.
COURT OF COMMON PLBAS, WmsTnxssPm JuN 23. BAIfSTOW AND ANOTHER V. HEYWOOD. vwtZnys et a VUL ertUs, after Term, at Westininster, before Mr. Justice CBR;wu and a Special Jurv.) This was an issue direoted by the Vice-ChanceUor to bo tried, to ascertain -whether or not the plaintiffs were entitled under an agreement to a patent. Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Quain appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Aston for the defendant. The plaintiffs, it appeared, are manufacturers at Sutton Mills, Cross IEill, near leeds, in Yorkshire, and the defendant was aprint designer in their employment, receiving a salary of 401. a-year. Ee invented a gauze weaving machine, with a crcss-over motion, and the plaintiffs took oat a patent for it, and paid the expenses, about o001., and they contended that in consideration of their paying these exSenses it was verbally agreed between them And the defen. uant that they should have an equal property in the patent, and a right to use 100 of the machines. This agreement was denied by the defendant, who contended he had never parted with his sole right to the patent, which wa taken out in his name. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, that the agreement was mnade as alleged. JONES V. HALES. This was an action against the registered proprietor of the Daily News for a libel, to which the defendant pleaded "Not guilty" and a justification. Mr. Serjeant Byles, Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and Mr. Keane appeared for the plaintiff; and ir. Hugh il, Q.C., and Mr. Lush, Q.C., for the defendant. Mr. Serjeant B7ass, in his opening to the jury, said the plaintiff, Dr. Jones, had practised in the profession of medi. cine for a long course of years at Lutterworth, and now resided near the Regent's Park. The defendant was the registered proprietor of the Daily News, and the action was brought for a very sorious libel contained in the Daily Nexus of the 10th of November, 1856. It was only doing justice to that newspaper to say that it did not allow itself to deal in libels. The one, however, of which the plaintiff now complained was one which a gentleman could not allow to pan without notice. He might say that where a man's character was dealt with unfairly and unjustly the best way was topass it over In silence, and live it down; but where the libel was of such a character as the present one it was absolutely necessary, if a man would hold up his head in society, that he should appeal to the law for redress. He gathered from what appeared in the libel that a gentleman named Brettle, of large fortune, who had a house in Wood-street, and also at Belper, and who resided in Paris, having an income of some 4,0001. or 5,0001. a-year, died at Paris in November, 1856, under extraordinary cir cumnt sucetF. In detailing the circumstances of his death a paragraph appeared in the Daily Necs of November the 15th, under the head of " Foreigu Coriespondence," which was as follow, *Paris, Saturday. "Wementioned two or three days since that Eome friends of the latg Mr. Alfred 0. Brettle, entertaining suspicions that the cauee of his death had not been truly stated, had appled to the Procureur-Tm. petal for a post mortem exautination. The fuceral tox place before any oder on the subject was made. But the result of a judicial nqufry has so far oonfimed the grounds for suspicion t1hat the authoritie have thought It rigbt to haye the body exhumed. A post mortem examinationw.u ado hi -o) by Dr. Tardieu, the eminent surgeon usually employed in such caes, and the contenbs ot the stomach. theheart, llver, and lungsenclosedin twosealedj,have been taken away to be examined, The subject causes so much excitement among the English reesdenta of the Paubourg St, Honore, and in so generally talked of that I no longer fear to prejudice any one by eisng an outline of the case an it has been represented to me. Mr. Brettle was a gentleman of large fortune, amounting, as some say, to 0O.000, and asother smy to £100.000. The whole ofthis fortune is andistood to be left to anEnglhlady, now In Paris, who waa no reltton to &th deceased. He was in a bad state of body, owing to intemporate habits, anditappearsthat he was o a aen and injured agooddeal by afall from the boxsoi hls carclage, which occurred, notatOh fntlly, as stated by mistake, but on the La Mfarbe racecourse After that accident he was taken home and placed under the care of his ordinar knedical attendant, Dr. 'Carthy, an English subject, but a licensed member of the French Faculty of Medicine, He got considerably better, and Dr. M'Cmrthy did not consider him in any immediate danger' However, whether by bis own wish or not I have not heard, a Dr. Jones, who, it seems, had attended him on Previous occasions, was sent for by telegraph from London, and it is alleged that Dr. Jones proceeded to treat him without putting himself in communication with Dr. M'Carthy, which, it is said, according to the medical etiquette usualy observed, he ought to have done. This Dr. Jones admiaistered to the patient a white powder, which he took from his watstcoat pocket, and two hours after taking this powder M.r Brettle died, Now, the clrcumstanceo which are oeosidered to call for explanatlon on the pasrt of Dr. Jones are that he at first signed a certitdcet that deceased had died from epilepsy; that he subsequently stated that he and Dr. M'Oarthy were both prepared to certify that ooncuinon of the brain was ths cause of death, the fact being that Dr. &l'Carthy decline to concer in any such cetificate. that he has ou several occa6ions admitted that the medicine he administered to Mr. BEettle waa a most potent one, and that when pressed to say what it was his only answer in, 'That is my secret,' On being interrogated by the CommIwsay of Po'i¢e, and saked to produce a specimen of the powder, he maid he had none left, but he finally wrote a prescripticn or making it up. Although the circumstances certailWy call for that thorouRh investigation which they will receive, I cannot help thibking that It wiMl turn out that there has been no wilful goisoning In she case. In the meantime Dr. Jones has been ordered not to leave Parts, and is under surveillauce." If slanders vvere current, it was no excuse when repeating them. It had been decided that to publish a libel of anybody, imputing to him gross misconduot, and at the Same time to say that you heard it, was no justification, because, if it were so, the most outrageous libel3 might be published of anybody by merely professing that the writer had heard it. When the writer meant to justify such a report he must not only say that he heard it, but must prove its truth. Some of the facts in the libel were correctly stated, as that a gentlemasn named Brettle was living in Paris, of large fortune, who had had a severe fall from his carriage. But it was not trae that the funeral had taken place as desoribed. The statement that he had left his fortune to an English lady who was no relative contained a dark insinuation, coupled with what followed, that the deceased died in two hones after Dr. Jones had administered to him a white powder from his waistcoat pocket. The effect of it was that there were people in: Paris who said and believed that Dr. Jones had murdered Mr. Brettle. No one but must say that this wa alibd ofa most serious character, and ib was for his learned frend in support of his second plea to prove it, The fihst isse he (Mr. Serjeant Byles) should prove by provlng the publica. tion of it by the defendant. William King Hales was then proved to be the publisher of the Daily News, and the newspaper containing the libel was put in evidence. This was the case for the plaintiff. lr. li submitted that there was no case, as there was no identification of the plaintiff Mr. Whiam onzyJ 70nes was then called to supply this endenee, by leave of hi Lordship. His father resided at Lutterwort , and attended Mr. Brettle. Cross-examined.-Had heard his father had attended him for delirium tremens. He had heard from his father of the death of Mr. Brettle, and that ah English lady, no relation, succeeded to the better part of his fortune. This was the case for the plaintiff Mr. Hsr,r then addressed the jury for the deFendant. He said his friend had made use of some general observations, that when a man's private character was assailed in this manner it was due to himself to require some explanation. Let them try Dr. Jones by this test. The libel was published on the 10th ef November. Instead of asking for explanation and indignantly denying its trath, lie had commenced an action on the 13th of November, an soon as it was possible, not thinking it requisite to ask for any explanation. He had not condescended to write to the Daity Aews, which his friend had said was not in the habit of publishing libels, for any explanation. Why had Dr. Jones not, ventured to pledge his oath that day that the facts stated in the libel were not true? Dr. Jons bhad given the deceased three-quarters of a grain of -tartar emetic, and had kcept this secret and unexplained to the deceased's medical attendant. It was the duty of a newspaper to publish everything relating to matters paiblioly comnmented on. The learned counsel then went on to contend that he should prove all the matters stated in the libel to be true, and that it merely detailed the particulars of a transaction publicly commented on. What had been published had been so without an atom of maaeb, and was not suoh a publication as demanded damages from a jury. But damages Dr. Jenes sought, and to put costa into the pocket of his attorney. He contended that the libel was a fair comment, and substantially true, and sAd he should seek for a verdict at their hands. At this stage of the case it was adjourned untl to-morrow morning, when the witnesses for the defence will be examined. SECOND COURT. (Sittintg at Niri Prius, at Westminster, ofore Mfr. JTugc CROwDER and Common Juriea.) MADVEWS V. MJUTCH. This was an action of trover to recover a watcb claimed by the plaintiff, Margaret Andrews, and held by the husband of her sister Ann. Mr. Worsley and Mr. Day were for the plaintiff. and Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. J. Thompson for the defendant. It appeared that in the year 1848 the father of the plaintiff and of the defendant's wife became insane, an- was removed into an asylau, whereupon several of thus most valuable articles of his property found their way into the hands of his relatives. Mr. Mutch, the defendant, having become possessed of a gold watch valued at 70L by one daughter oftthe lunatic, was allowed to retain it for some time, but on one occasion when he took it out of his pocket, Margaret, the plaintiff, said, " That is mine; my father gave it to me." Upon which Mr. Mutch, or his wife, said, "He was not in a fit state to give it to any one." A dispute having subsequently arisen as to the right to this watch lAr. Mutchclained to hold it as a securitv for advances made by him, and alleged to be due from the estate of the lunatie, who has since died. The main point in dispute seemed to be whether the watoh had been actually given or merely promised to the liaintiff; and different versions of the conversation above alluded to were given by differnt members of the family, who gave evidence in the cause. Mr. Serjeant Simn having addressed the jury for the defence, the learned counsel for the plaintiff was not called uon for his reply, and they returned a verdict for the paintiff. Mr. Mutch then handed the watch (a large old-fashioned gold one) to his attorney, who gave it up at once to the plaintiff, and the sisters left the court, expressing very audibly their respective opinions of the conduct of each other in the matter. PERBY V. DAVIS AN{D OEmnS. Mr. Edward James, Q c., and Mr. Cook Evans appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Hugh Hill, Q.C., and Mr. Lewis for the defendant Davis; and Mr. M. Smith, Q.C., and Mr. Cleave for the other defendants. This was an action of ejectment brought to recover pos session of a wharf and premises on the banks of the nver Thames, in Duke-street, Chelsea, upon the ground of a for. feiture, by carrying on a business which was alleged to be a nuisance to the neighbourhood, and more especially to the occupiers of the White Hart Tavern. It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that the premises in question had been easedbyhimin theyearl830 to the defendantDavis, atarent of 181. per annum, upon certain covenants. In the year 1854 Davis granted an under lease to the other defendants, Berry and Keef, who, in the first instance, used the wharf as a place for landing coals and other merchandise; but in the month of November last they sold off everything, and having made certain alterations in the premises they began a new business, which was now complained of as a nuisance. They used the wharf as a place at which they collected* all the dung from stable yards, cowsheds. &c., in the neigh. bourhood, and shot it into barges which lay alonpside the wharf, and thence carried it up the river to the various market-gardeners, to be laid on the land. As many as3Ocartloads of dung were brought there in a day and shotintothe bes, eomo of which wwould contain-as many as 60 and.60 loads, This was naturally complained of by the neigh. bours, and a memorial was presented to the vestry, complaining of the nuisance. Dr. Barclay, the medical officer of health, and Mr. Alder, the inspector of nuisances, were instructed to inquire into the matter, and upon their report proceedings were instituted against the occupiers of the premises; but, as this action was pending, nothing had been decided. Shortly before the alterations had been made the plaintiff had seen the defehdant Davis, and read to him the covenant from his lease, by which he was forbidden to " do any matter or thing of any nature or kind which might obstruct the view of the river from the White Hart publichouse, or that shall grow, or be a nuisance or annoyance to the occupier or occupiers thereof, nor make any externalalterationwhatsoever inthesaidpremises, nor any internal alteration in the said dwelling-house that may lessen the value thereof," without the consent inwriting of the lessors. The plaintiff now called several witnesses to show.that the defendants had considerably altered the premises without consent; and that they had created an intolerable nuisance, which must necessarily be a nuisance and "' =ao ance to the occupiers of the White Hart." It appeared that the plaintiff was only a lessee, and was bound by a similar covenant in his lease, and he had brought this action, as he said, to protect himself, and to prevent his own ejection from property of considerable value. All the witnesses called by the laintiff spoke iu very strong terms as to the nuisance whicoa had been created. They described it as of the most sickening character, and as the ne plus ultra of foul smell, and Dr. Barelay expressed his opinion that such an accumulation of soil was decidedly prejudicialto health. The Inspector of Nuisances gave similar evidence. Mr. SaiTH objected that, as it did not appear that "the occupier of the White Hart" complained of the alleged nuisance, the defendant had not incurred any forfeiture; but, this objection being for the purposes of the trial overruled, the learned counsel proceeded to call witnesses to aegative the plaintiff's case. Berry was called, and saidthat what he had done to the premises was a decided improvement, and he was confirmed in this respect by two other witnesses. He also said the plaintiff had seen the alterations going on, and had not complained. Gregory, the .andlord of the White Hart, which was exactly opposite the wharf, was called; and, on being asked whether the wharf was a nuisance to him, he said, "I have never smeltthe dung since it has been there." (Laughter.) A healthylooking woman, a Mrs. Rickards, a carman's wife, who lived in a house adjoining the wharf, said, "I smell nothing." (Lauhter.) She also said she liked the smell (laughter), and she was sure it promoted her health. (Laughter.) Miss Gregory, also of the White Hart, said she felt no nuisance or annoyance from the business carried on at the wharf; and two other witnesses from the neighbourhood spoke to the same effect. Mr. Smith and Mr. James having severally addressed the jury, Mr. Justice CRowDER ummed up the evidence. His Lordship thought there was ground for the plaintiff's bringing the aotion, as it appeared be incurred the risk of losing property to a much larger amount. But it would be for the jury to say, first, whether there had been any substantial alteration made in the Premises by the defendants; and, if so, whether it affected their value. The jury found that there had been an alteration made but it had not lessened the value. They also found that the plaintiff had waived the forfeiture. Mr. Justice CROwDB then asked the jury whether they believed the wharf was a nuisance or annoyance to the occupiers of the White Hart, telling them, atthe same time, that they ought to find for the plaintiff if they thought the wharf would be a nuisance or annoyance to ordinay per. sons. The jury said that, in their opinion, it was not a nuisance, and found for the defendants. Mr. EVANS submitted that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict if there had been an alteration of the premise, even though their value was not lessened, and teat there was no evidence of a waiver. Mr. Justice O WowDXn gave the plaintiff leave to move upon that point, but directed the verdict to be entered for the defendants. Verdict for the defendants.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER. TurESDAY. .TTm 92 TtAlz,nv-p v- vn?? MUsl2igs at Nisi Prius, before Arr. Baron MARTIN and a SPecia Jurv.) Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Mr. Joyce, and Mr. Doyle were counsel for the plaint=; Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Lush, and Mr. Sleigh appeared for the defendant. This case, whichwas partly heaTd yesterday, was rzsmed this morning. The plaintiff by his declaration, first, complained of certain slanderous statements made before'Sir R. W. Carden at Guildhall, with reference to the Sanmari tan Institution, and his conduct in reference thereto as resident secretary; and next that the defendant had subsequently malioiously and without probable cause, and with the view of oppressing the plaintiff and inducing him to forbear from pressing this action, the writ in which had been ismed in the meantime, caused certain summonses to be taken out charging the plaintiff with having obtained beer, flour, and biscuits upon false and fraudulent pretenoe, and thereby put the plaintiff to great expenses in defending himself against those charges, which were ultimately dis. missed. To this the defendant pleaded " Not Guilty" generally, and, as to the slander, he pleaded that the words were true in substance and effect. Mr. Serjeant BALLANT=f, having opened the case on tho part of the pitiff es one whiclh caUed for anple d4amage at the hands of the jury, proceeded to.support his state. ment by the following witnesses, whose evidence, in consequence of the publicity given to the proceedings at Guild hall, we subjoin, in er4mo, in so far as the principal fats are concerned Mr. Griffin.-I attended the GuildhallPolice.courtlormy brother as a reporter, when the defendant came forward and made a fstatesment with ^redferenche stotheg Saemaitn on Friday, the 6th of December, 1856 He read the state ment, which I think he then handed to me.

It was distinctly understood that the plaintiff was to have rations forhimself and his family, just like a magter of a workhouse had. If the plaintift' had not he must have starved. I never heard of any complaint. Mr. Baron MtAmTm, at the close of the plaintiff's cas, stated that he would amend the first count by altering it into one for libel, instead of slander. As it stood, the words were not, in his opinion, actionable, and as the defendant bad reduced them into writing, it was a libel or - nothing. As to the second and third oounts there was clearly no case. Mr. Serjeant BArTTAyvnxz abandoned those counts, and assented to the amendment. Mr. LusH then addressed the jury for the defendant in the temporary absence of 3Mr. James, and at the close of his address the Court adjourned. At the sitting this morning the following witnesses were examined insupportof the defendant's case. Mr. Potter.-Iam the defendant, andone of theguardians of the West London Union. I carry on my business in Farringdon-street. I became acquainted with the Samaritan Institution and the dormitory, in consequercie of something I heard about them. I went to the Guildhal and made a satement before Mlr, Alderman Carden. Before that there had been. oomplanta to me as a guardian of the way in which the institution was carn on by the master of the workhouse. Before I spoke to the magistrate I made a statement-to Mr Martin, the ¢lerk at Guildhall, as to the course I was about to adop-. I showed him the statement in his private room PDd I Ve94 wnt bl r tbs faderm%u ad made it in public, .it is true, to the best of . tuton n te mntb OfSePtember before to swe the dormitories nd other plee I kow it Wu maintained by public contibutions. 1had received an anonymous letter and severalverbal communcation aboutthefustitution. Those satements wero voluntLrily made to me. The writ in the action did not influence me in going before the alderman at all. I received this letter from the alderman, stating he he would sit and her the farher satements which I had to ranks on va day nmed by him. Crna-examined.-I had written to 'hb io say Ihad re. ceivedfurther information, and asked him to appoint a day I went to him at his eounting-house while tke case was going on and saw him. I cannot state distinctly the detaUs of what I went to cpe&k to him about. I asked him to allow me to speak to him, and he said that he could not, situAted as he was, listen to me, and I left. I heard about the beer I from thre persons. I do not live in town. I pass the in. stitution on my way to the union. I pass it frequently. The doors have always been closed. I never saw any one there. I never made any inquiry before I made my state. ment. I wrote it before Ilwent and took itto the Mansion. house, when I was directed to go to the quludhall, and I did so. I saw a paper onuide the institution with the amesofa president and vice.president on it. I knew nothlag of Sir L1 W. Carden till thin statement ws made. Mxr. Martin, the clerk to the Gfidhalil Court, proved that M.Potter handed him tthe written statement, which hie gave to the reporter, and that Alderman Car,den was there Cross-examined.No doubt) it Was given to me with the vievr of beinz &publse Willin MoDbs, one of the city police.-The institution is on my beat, and [ have known It as long as it existed. Soup and bread were given to the poor, but never nmore than in small quantities at a time. I have takenx many poor to the workhouse who have been refused relief at the insti. taton. They had subscribers' tickets. Relief is given at vaanous times-seldom, two days running. There would eb about 200 there while the doors were open, which was about an hour. The activity was greater at Christmas-day. Cross-examined.-The place was very much frequented by thieves, who hung about and robbed the poor wvho came from the country of their tickets, and sometimes the passers-by. It was a dangerous place on that account. The thieves would go into the lavatories the first thing in the morning, and then hang about to thieve. Sergeant Porter and four otber polioe, who were mattendance at the institution on Chiistmas day, 1855, were then called. They proved that,though they themselves had been once or twice daring their duties, which were very harassing, and at dinner afterwards, when some of them dined with the servants, no beer was given to the poor, nor even water; but those who required the latter got it from the lavatories. One man swore that he saw the beer drawn for himself from a barrel uear the door, andthatit was not drawn any more. None of them saw any mugs at alL Mr. Cole, the inspector of the city police.-I lived oppo. ite, and have seen people go away. I have tasted the soup. It was very weak and unpalatable, though not unwholesome. Cross-examined.-It wras not so good as we have in the City-not fit for an alderman, certainly. John Cooke.-I was in the service of the institntion at Christmas day, 1855. I kept the tap of the beer all that day, and the next morning I gave it up. No porter was given to the poor that das. The servants and police had some. There were biscuits sent, which were taken upetairs to the store-room. I saw them next when the family of the plaintiff ate themn. There wa no library for the r. I saw the newspapers, and then I wrote to Mr. Potter. Cr-exned.I was .a clerk, and not one of the poor. I was not dishrgedfordrunkenness, I was there till the 29th of December. Barber sent me away suddenly, and gave me a week's wages On the 21st (this date was afterwards corrected to the 31st) I wrote to Barber a letter complainng of my dismissal (the letter also contained a tbreat that the,writer would mike a oomplaint elsewhere). Re-examined.-My wages were 14s. per week and rations. John Bright.-I was the cook at Christmas, 1855. We made 60 or 70 gallons of soup. - There were two kinds of soup. We drew off the first and then diluted the rest with water and gave that to the poor. If any subscribers came they tasted the best soup. It is not true that soup was given to the amouats stated by the plaintiff's evidence in December, 18M, and January 1856. We gave a small basin to each and some bread cut up. They complained of it latterly. I remember the Christmas dinner. There were two barrels sent to the institution. There were 100 mugs got, hut Mr. Barber sent them back, saying they were too lage, and that he would not distribute any beer to the poor. Some smaller ones came afterWards. I never saw any one in the institution but the pliintiff£ Crosa-examined.-Iwent away with a coat beloning to the institution, and returned it after a week, I kept it because I was looked up that night. I asked for relief when I had three or four shillings in my-pocket, so I was given in charge with tho coat on. I returned it as soon as Igt out. Mr. .Mountaephen, the superintendent of Field-lane Ragged School, stated that after he saw the first paragraph in t e papers he wrote to Mr. Potter, stating what he had observed of the Samaritau Intitution, 'vhich was opposite to his residence. He had known many apply who did not get relief. Mr. Baron M.uRTw.-No doubl,it would be impossible to supply all the idle poor in the metropolis. Phillips, the master of the workhouse, proved that he had made a communication also to Mr. Potter before that gentleman had gone to the alderman. Mr. Palmer, of the firm of Huntly and Palmer, biscuitbakers, at Reading.-We sent a barrel of biscuits to the institution for the Christmas dinner, 1855, in consequence of -..a circula%r We received fZmM]rbet Atiugthe iteutioIX of the coninittee to givo v dinnertothepoor on Christmas. day as before, and thanking us for one we had sent the previous year. Similar evidence having been given in respect of the donations of flour and beer, the case for the defendant closed with the evidence of Mr. Buchanan, the defendant's solioitor, who proved that he took out the summonses because the alderman had refused to hear anything further unless a specific and regular charge was preferred. Mr. Baron MARTiN then summed up the whole case to the jury. As to the libel the question forthem was whether the written statement constituted a libel, in their opinion. If it did, the next point was whether it was true. If so, the defendant was entitled to a verdict. on the first count. Then, as to the summonses, the complaint was that they were taken out maliciously, and 'without reasonable or probable cause. The question of malice was for the jury, and they would say whether the defendant acted from a bond jade public spirit or maliciously, with a view to prejudice the plaintiff. As to the reasonable cause that was for the judge, and he thought there was on the facts cause for the summons, in respect of the biscuits, for that they had not been used for the dinner was admitted, and, though there might not be a sufficient case to support the charg, there might weU be enough to warrant one not a lawyer in preferring it as Mr. Potter had done. As to that summons, then, the defendant was clearly entitled to a verdict. As to the beer, there was contradictory evidence whether that was used for the poor; but, if not, the do. fendant would also be entitled to a verdict. As to the flour, there was no foundation for that charge, and the question would be whether the defendant had preferred it mali. ciously. If not; there must be a verdict for the defendant for that also. The jury retired, and, after an absence of some hours, returned a specal verdict, finding the written statement to be libelous, Ut true, and that the defendant did not act maliciously. At the same time, the foreman stated that it was the unauimous opinion of the jury that Mr., Mrs., and MiEs Barber had all given their evidence without any design to misrepresent the facts. It may be therefore stated in general terms that the jury found a verdict for the defendant. SECOND COURT. PIDGEON V. MUNDAY. We deeply regret that an error should have occurred in the report of this case which appeared in our impression of Monday last. We stated that the jury returned a verdict or the plaitiff; it should have been for the defendant. The foreman oE the jury delivered the verdict in a low tone, and, in consequence of the usual noise in a court of law at the conclusion of a case, he was misunderstood by our re-

The prisoner, it will be rcollected, was ,ndicted for murder, and convicted. Against that convic. tion there was a writ of error to the Court of Queen's Bench, which affirmed the conviction. Against that judg. ment this writ of error was brought. Mr. F. Russell (with him Mr. Denman) appeared for the prsoner, and Mr. Welsby on the part of the prosecution. Mr. RuEsxuL: stated the different proceedings that had taken place in the courts below. The errors alleged were the same that had been set forth in the Court of Queen's Bench. It appeared that on the trial a juror named Ironmonger was called, and the counsel for the prosecution prayed that he might be ordered to stand by. The counsejfor the prisoner prayed that cause might be shown before any other person should be called, and he urged that Ironmonger ought not to ordered to stand by, butthe Court directed that he should stand by. The list was then Rone through, some jurors were challenged, some were elected, and seme were ordered to stand by on the prayor of the Crown. The panel having been gone through, only nine bad been elected to servo, when Ironmonger was again caled, and at the instance of the Crown was again ordered to stand by. The jury were ultlmatel; sworn, Ironmonger not being one of them. The learned counsel then probeeded -with his argumeent. The main objection wa that jurors badbeen improperly set aside. It had been held that the disalowing or allowing a challenge of jurors was grotind of error. If the Crown had been allowed improperly 'to teb aside a juror, it was error on the record, andjudgment must be reversed. When Ironmonger was called a second time he ought not to have been set aside on the prayer of the pro. ecution, the panel having been gone through. If he had been challenged the first time it would have been riht to have set him ade. When tbe panel bad been gone through theqright of the Crown to chalenge was at an end, unless upon cause being shown. The CO JusmCel said he.ihqught that would be ad. mitted, but he apprehended the Crown would say the panel had not been gon9througb. Mr. W-sBY'-gid the question would be what "fgone through" meant. Mr. RUesmLi would oontend that the panel wa sgone through when allthe jurors ha bencaDed. It was tlot in the discretion cf the Cortthe counsel of the CrowA had aowerto chal]mge. The question turned on the td of .ELwredL1,wbrieh haa been repeated in the 6th George IV, and that statute gave the powver to the Crowrn to challenge for cause, Tho Vrowjn was thereforo to asDg4 causo fo~tbte cbaUleage, and that caewasto be inquizedintobfo s other uror wu sworn. The calenges were to he tsia be. fore the inquisition was taken.

Thbt it wds an absolute prerogative of the UCrown was an error, axjang from Lord Coke's mirAding of some of ti;e iore ancient authorities. She atute was pased, therfore, to correct an abuse which had been usurped. If the words of the statute were strictly taken, they aust be held to be in favour of the doctrine now contended fow by the prisoner. In civil causes a party need not show eause until after the panel had been gone through, and therefore it might have been contended ttat the Crown ought not to be in a worse position tin a sub,iect If one chaileagedthe array he must ahow cause forthwitb, and not wait until the panel was gone through.

RUSSEL would come to that shortly. If a plintiff challenged ajuror, and the panel was thenl gone goTou g thereas a question whether the defendant oulD subw quently chbaenge that same juror. Tbe decisions upon that point were conlicti, bt it would aeem to hav bSeen decided that the defendant could not so challenge thsi ame juror. This showed that the time for challenging without cauEe was when the pamel was first being called. In riminal cases thispractioe atome time applied. A prisoner was not to show cause until the panel had been gone through, and he might then waive his showing ause, & definite point of time was gLven, and tht was when the panel was gone through. In 1, Yeatris, 309, the Crown had challenged, andr wa pressed to assign cause, but the panel was ordered firat to be gone through. In 8, SCaSe Trial, 335, a man was tried forhigh treason in 1551 - ajuror war chalenged by the Crowrn; it was objcted that Le must show cause, but it was held that this could not be done until the panel had been gone through. In9 S9a&e 2Was, page 12, in 1582, it was said by Pemberton, C. J., that the, way to have a challenge for cause wa to chaLlengoe ill the regt of the panel, and then the Crown must at once show cause. Again, in t'hc same year, a man wAs ceba with abduction and was tried at bar; the Crown cha.Ieiged juror. The prisoner'icounsel then said, " We will chalenge all the rest so as to drive the Crown to shoir cause." The judges then held that the Crown must show cause, But not immediately. InlZapmonci oeperts, 473, itwas held that. the panel must all be called before cause shown. )n 1.2 Rate Trals, 675, a juror said he was an ancient map, -a not fit to serve. He ws then challenged by the Crown, and it was held that the panel mnst be gone.through before cause shown, ana then if there were not 12 leftto try, cause must be shown. In lS, Stac 2be, 312, Peter Cooke was tried for high treason; the panel was gone through. Clarke a juror) was then called. He had not before answered lhe Crown challenged him, and its said. that the Crown could challenge till the panel w4a gone through, but now it must show cause. It seemed hat Clarke had been in court all the time, 'but hid not answered. .e was sworn. The learned counsel now contended that the moment the panel had beea gone through the power of the Crown to diallinge without causeeaed. Along dscusson took place as to the actual pratice of caling tejury at the OldBailey and at the assizes. Mr. RUSsBLL then, cited other cases as .to the mode adopted when all the names of the jurors had been called. In one case it had been contended that the Crown.had no, right to challenge without showiing cause 1mmediately, but it hadbeen decided that the proper tfme for rhowing cause was when the panel had been gone through In "Geach'Ps case the prisoner had challenged 13, aud the Crown had challenged 37. When the panel had been gone through the jury was not complete. Mr. Baron Parke said that the panel must be called over as before, omittingthosechsllenged by the prisoner perem torily. The first perhs caled had been challenged by the Crown, and the judge held that cause must then he shown, Some of the jurors who had before been called, but had not then answered, apon be'in called a second time, aswered, and the judge then refued to allow the Crown to challenge those persons without at once ahowing cause. The CH=Z JusTcE sid there was an objection to that, because the p risonermightratherhave challengedth6eethan the persons Me had before challenged. I r. RusszLL said that would be a hardahip on the prisoner, butit would be hard upon him if the7 Crown could be permitted to chaUenge those persons without showin cause. The Court lwotld not look to the reason of the juror being absent when first called. Mr.Baron CHANNELL, s ing there to be one panel for both courts, and the officer having gone through the list sent into the other court for more jurors, would Mr. Ruisell say that beforethose other jurors came in the list had been. gomethcrongh? Mr, RusSxLr thought it should be so considered. 'Why should the power of the Crown be extended, as it rnight be abused? The Cusur JUsTIcE said the Court must distinguish between political and other cases. The Clerkof Asize might call a jury believing them to be intellgent, instead of which they turned out to be particularly stupid, wouldhe be wrong in omitting them on the second jury? Mr. RusSELL objected to the officer having that power without a special Act Df Paliament. The rest of the, jurors were not called because they were performing snother duty, being at the time engaged upon another trial. It Jsrstiervorj,econidredtha tey were not at the time upon the ewJe-u n-o -nqn sell's case was complete that other jury had given their verdict; but stil the panel had been gone through, and Ironmbonger ought to have been swvorn, or cause ought to The Cnxr JUsrsCE.-If the other jury came into court, could it beosad -the panel had beenx gone throughI until their. names had been called? Mr. RussErz thought the case of Geach answered that question. If there had been an improper election of the jury, there eught to be redress, and surely this was to be obtained by error. To order a juror to stand by was ajudg. ment of the Court, and there was error to that jadgment. A juror might be excused for many reasons, but he must not be ordered to stand by without cause. The CH:Fr JUSrCI:.-It was onl aprolongation of the order that Ironmonger should stand by, and while the discusdon about it was going on the other jury came in. It all turned upon whether the panel had been perused or not. Mr. RuSSmu said that there had been two applic tions that the juror should stand by, and there w oen ho orders All might have been ordered to stnd byltiU the other jury came in. Supposing they had not come in till ater Ironmonger's case had been gone through, when could it have been said that the panel had been gone through 7 The first callnghrough the panel must be held to be a going tbrough. Where was the limit? In early times the Crown had only the power of challenging one juror peremptorily; now a practice had grown up givng the Crown an extraordinary power of selecting a jury. Could there be a reason for increasing that power U In no other country was it possessed. If this power eed, it mustapply to all courts. He submitted that the real power of the Crown only extended to challenge for cause. The intention of the statute of 33d Edward L was to take away the power of the Crown to delay showing cause. If a judge could have the power of directing jurors to stand by he would have the power of selecting the jury. 'The CHmx JUSTICE.-If the judge saw a gross act of -injustice contemplated, could he not take the means of defeating it? Mr. RUSSELL thonght not. There was a proper mode to be adopted. In calling the jurors the Court had noright toorder a juror to stand by on the demand ofthe prosecution. An order to stand by was not good without adaing until the panel was gone through. The CHIE JUSTIoE.-That was merely teling a man to wait. Mr. RUSSLL smid it was a challenge not properly stated. The CHEEF JUSTIoC.-If the panel had been gone through the other jury could not have been called. Ifit had notbeengonethrough quoad that jury, thetime for the Crown challenge had not arrived. Mr. RUSSEhL said the Crown might challenge either of the 12 new men, but it must show cause in the first instance when he challenged them. One of the jurors, named Phillp otts, sad he had conscientious scruples against the punisnment of death, and, on the prayer of the Crown, he was ordered to stand by. The learned counsel sumiatted that this waserroneous: that hsving been once received as a jurymanbtheOCrown could not challenge him-the time hadt gone by. The 0 JUsvrCE.- Supposing both parties not to know anything of the man passed him, and then the man said he th duty ofttaheYjudgae topeurt himaside? Theease occurred Mi . RussELL said a man might say that to get off servimg; but in 33, StaouT riWa 1 ,Thistlwoo d'.case, a juror made a similar objections,'but the judge ruled that it was no objection ia poinit oflaw, and the juror was sworn. The judge ought not to _hfve the power on his discretion of~ putting a juror aside. Conscientious scruples were not sufficient to ordersa man to stand by. The record did not show thatthe jur-ors were good and lawful men of the county of Kent. it said the sheriff had returned the persons fol- houn, the further having addresa ed the Court for ro hu,tefuter argumcnts wer adjourned to to-morrow.

The bankrupt had, moreover, zealously assisted in the realization of his estate. For all these favourable features he gave the bankrupt credit. There was not any taint of irand or dishonesty in the case- but, on the other hand, he had to deal with figure, which showed a most disastrous trade.

Several solicitors opposed, on the ground of imnproper conduct on the part of the bankrupt, who was examined, but The COmIiIxssioNEn observed that he was only dealing at present with the figures, and he mustreserve the question of conduct until the certificate meeting, unless it could be proved that the bankrupt had brought himself within the Tenal clauses of the A ct. One of the parties alleged that the bankrupt had adopted a course which he said was becoming common in the cityviz., that of obtaining goods irom abroad on credit, and then effering a composition. T^he case would almost disgrace the Insolvent Debtors' Court. The COMXasSSsONEn.-It does look a little fit for that court, certainly. I caunot say anything as to the bankrupt's conduct aow.

.IIDDLESEX SESSIONS. (Before Mr. PAsH y,EY Q.C., Asaistant-Tudge.) Cornelius Aherne was indicted for having stolen a waistcoat and some silk handkerchiefs. yr. Poland prosecuted; Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the prisoner. The prosecutor was the mate of a ship caUed the Spirit of the North, lying in the West India Dock, and the charge aganst the prisoner, who is what is termed a " lumper," was that he had while in care of the ship stolen the articles in question from a drawer in the cabin. Mr. METCALFEI having addressed the jury, they said they were of opinion that there was a doubt in the case, and therefore Acquitted the prisoner. A gentleman who had attended to speak to the prisoner's previous good character gave him some money, and sent b5inbck to his work. Foar boys, named William Lewis, 15, Wiliam West, 14, lenry Brown, 13, and Henry Pennyfather, 12, were indicted for stealing 201b. of horsehair, the property of Edward Bolton Walmsley. They pleaded "Guilty." Foulsbam, an officer of the Westminster House of Correction, proved that Lewis had been committed to that prison five times, West seven times, Pennyfather six times, and Brown twice. The AssisTAN.JTnDgE sentenced each of them to be imprisoned in the House of Correction for four months, and then to be detained in a reformatory institution for four Years. Angusta odhehere vwas indicted for stealing, and also for raudulentlyobtaining three perambulators by false pretences. She pleaded " Guilty." The frauds were separate. She was sentenced to six months' hard labour. Thomas Madden, 22, Richard Anderson, 32, Michael Coglan, 25, and Bridget TaUy, 24, were indicted for having stolen a watch, value 61., the property of Hemy Baley Clive, from his person. Mr. Poland prosecuted ; Mr. Dorle appeared for Tallv. On the night of the illuminations in honour of the Qaeen's birthday the prosecutor was at the Opera House, and as he was about to leave he was jostled by a mob in the Colonnade, and some one stole his wateh from his right hand waistcoat pocket. A person tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him if he had lost anything, and he at once missed his watch. A policeman saw the four prisoners in company with another person, and, suspecting them, he watched their proceedings. He stated that he saw Taully standing near the prosecutor, and place her hand in front 'of him, hastily withdraw it, and pass something to MIadden, who handed it to Coglan. The latter got away and was not taken until the next day. A young man named Harrington was called. He deposed, -1 live at No. 6, Poole's-buildings, Mount-pleasant, Gray'sinn-lane, and am employed now as a supornumerary at the Princess's Theatre. 1 am occasionally a house painter. I was convicted at the Old BaUey six years ago last month, and was sentenced to seven years' transportation, and I have had a ticket of leave three years next October. On the evening in question I was in the Haymarket, when I saw the prisoners, and knowing Coglan to be a ticketof-leaver like myself, I watched them. I saw them attempt to get a watch from a gentleman's pocket, but they did not succeed. Two of them got in front ef the proseqgtor and two behind, well covering him and wedging himm. Madden tried to get his watch. I was close to them at that moment, and heard the woman say, "' Out of the b- way, and let me get at it." That was in a whisper, but I heard it. Madden got aside, and the woman got her hand round to the gentleman's pocket, and got the watch off the swivel of the chain. She had got something in her hand when she withdrew it, which she handed to Madden, and from him it went to Coglan. A liceman was close by. I asked the gentleman if he had ost anything. He said his watch. I then laid hold of Tally and another woman, who was one of the lot as well, but who got awav. Cross-examined.-I don't consider myself much of a fooL Once I was much the other way, perhaps, but I am now reformed. I am a repentant ticket-of-leave man now. I know a policeman by his look, although he wears plain clothes. The policeman in this case was in plain clothes, but I knew he was a policeman. I have given evidence in two other cases. I was tried on the 12th of May, 1851. It wvas for larceny-picking a gentleman's pocket. I don't see how it signifies whatit was. At all events, I robbed the gentleman, and suffered. Well, if you must knov, it was a handkerchief. 1 had been convicted before that, but only summarily. When I was discharged I had a character for good conduct. I have seen Coglan with thieves in White. chapel since he has had his ticket, but he has not seen me. All my evidence is true. Coglan.-This is all malice, He and I were working together in 185.3 in Portsmouth Dockyard. We had some 'words and a fight, for whioh we were punished. This is through that. Witness.- That's wrong. We were at Wakefield before we went to Portsnmouth, but we did not work in the same yard. I had no words with him, and never fought, and was only punished once, and that was for tobacco. I knew Madden as well as the others. Madden, in his defence, said he was accidentally in the Haymarket when, seeirg a bother in a crowd, he went to see what it was, when he was taken into custody as being concerned. Ho know nothing whatever of it. Coglan.- It is true, gentlemen, I am a ticket-of-leave inan I don't wish to hide it. I was convicted and suffered; ut since I have been out I have tried hard to get an honest living, ut the police and such as that witness hunt us down like hounds would their prey. They do do it, as we too weU know. I was thero by accident; this convict sees me, and, out of a spite, which began at Portsmoutb, he has done this. That was tho first timne he had seen me since; and allof it is concocted by him and the policeman. Anderson.-I'm innocent; that's all I've got to say. Mr. DorLic, in his address to the jury, strongly denourmced 6ihe conduct of Harrington, and hodped that by exoluding his .evidence entirely from their consi eration there would be such A doubt in the case as would justify them inuasemitting the prisoners. The jury found all four Guilty. ,Afo-mer conviction wa4 then proved against Coglan. . policeman suggested that Harrington could give infor spatj9n respecting convictions of Anderson and Aladden. The A&sSsTANT JUI)CE refused to hear hini. He de. *forred- the sentence for the present, there being another case .agxinst Coglan. (Before Mir.

POLICE. MlALonoRouHsRsesr.-Received Fs., for Mary avin. MARYLEBONn-MArv Anne Barton was charged with violently assaulting her husband, ThomAs Barton, residding in Union.street, Lis on.grove. The evidence went to show that on the same day compl.ainaut found his wife drinkig with her mbther at a pblichouse; she wvas drunk, and on his requiring her to go quietly home she refused to do 7so, and she struck him k icked him, and bit him severely on the 'hand, A gies dleal of blood came from the wound she had inflicted. The. prisoner was given into the custody of Slocombe, 144 D, to whom she said that if she was sent lo prison she would "remember" her husband when ahe eame out. The prisoner, who for a long time past baa by her dranken habits and violence towards complainant made his home miserable, wa fined 40s., or a month in the House of Correction. WESTMINSTEs.-James Snow, a. powerful young Itbourer, was charged with violently assaulting his wife, a very creditable-lookeig woman, to whom he had only been married a few weeks. After hearing evidence, Mr. ARINOLD said that, although this cse was not so bad as some brought before him, he felt it his duty to commit defendant for two months to hard labour in the House of Correction. 'THAMs.-Lmin Apoo was charged with assaulting Sangtoo and hitting him on the head with a hammer. The parties in this case are Chinamen, and as repulsive as dirt and crime can make them. They have on more than one occasion given much trouble, and keep brethels and lodginghousea for Chinamen and Lascars in a pestiferous p lace called Bluegate.fields, Shadwell. Sangtob formerly lived in one of Apoo's " lust houses " (as translated by the interpreter, a native of Penang), and, aquarrel having taken place between them, the comp l"manu`t entered into the same nefarious business on his own account, at No. 2, Victoria. place, Bluegate-fields. On the evening of Monday, the 16th instant the complainant was standing at his own door, when Apooabused him, and used ve7 dreadfulthraatstowardshim. On the following night the defendant waited for his country. manseveral hours, and at last met with him near his own door, and, after lavishing some more abuse upon him, seized him by the hair, and attempted to bite him. Sangtoo got away from his savage assailant, and was pursuedby bim, and struck on the head with a heavy hamnier, and knocked down. The mark of the blow was visiblo on Sangtoo'e head. His evidence was confirmed by Maria Turner, an Irish girl, who said Ap was watching for the complainant from 6 until 11 o'clock on the night m question. A woman named Sanderson, alias Buckley, who keeps a lodgin-house for Chinesevagrants, in Bluegate-fields, also stated that Sangtoo was violently assaulted. There was a colony of Chinese beggars in the place. They started every morning for the west-end and suburbs, and the profits of their beggi excursions amounted to 2s., 3s., and 4s. per day each, and sometimes a little more. The defendant kept two brothels, with three girls in each for the special society of the Chinamen, who spent their evenings wit)s them, After a long investlgation, bringing forth details of horrible vice among the Chinamen in Bluegate-fields, and the filth amid which they lived. Mr. YARDLEn said, this case disclosed a most strange feature in our social system, and it was not the first time he had heard of it and commented upon it. There was a colony, or nest, of 50 to 90 Chinamen in Blue. gate-fields, who left that vile and filthy place every morn ing to solicit alms, distributed themselves and roved about the west-end of London in the day time, and came back in the evening to their city of refuge, where they had an establishment of brothels and other luaxuries, not to be named, suitable to their peculiar tastes. Ai dreadful state of things existed, and if not put a stop to by vigorous and rigorous measures, the Chinese vagrants would make themselves known to all the world by a horrid pestilence. As far as his duty and his authority went, he would not hesi. tate to do all in his power to put down such a nuisnce, which existed only through the mistaken charity of people at the west-end, who gave money to Chinese mendican, which they expended in the infamous houses described by the interpreter and witnesses. The charitable people at the west-end did not know the incalculable mischief they caused by giving money to Chinese vagrants, who ought to be closely looked after by the police. He knew that serious crimes were committed in Bluegate. fields. He was not disposed to be lenient to Apoo, although he was a foreigner, after the revolting detas he had heard and considering that the defendant was the proprietor of two brothels in which he kept women for the especial solace of 50 or 90 Chinese beggars who resorted to m nightly, and considering also that Apoo had been most ably defended, and that he was realizing large gains by his immoral and pestilential trade, he did no thaink he should be treating him with excessive rigour if he ordered him to pay a fine of 3d., or be imprisoned for one month. The penalty was instantly paid. SOUTIWARK.-James Harrington and James Waltho, two ruffianly-looking and cowardly fellows, de'ibod as hawkors, were charged with committing murderous assaults upon Police-constables 136 and 231, M divison, both of whom were unable to attend, owing to the serious injuries inflioted on them, the latter officer being in a dangerous stato at Guy's Hosptal. George Bonsor 11 M, said that about 11 o'clock On the previous night his attention was called to the Crown publi. aouse, Kent-stiaet, where he was told two constables were nearly murdered, and others seriously Injured by a mob of ruffians. He immediately proceeded there, and saw several persons fighting. There were two other constables attempt. ing to disperse the mob, but they were attacked in such a brutal manner that had not Mr. Bruce, the landlord of the Crown publichouse, dragged them in and closed his doors they must have been murdered. Witness distinctly saw the prisoners most active among the mob, and perceiving them attack 231 M and trip him up, he took hold of them to secure them. While doing so the prisoner Bar. rington kicked 231 If, and another man struck him on the head with a brickbat. Witness secoured Harrington. and with assistance oonveyed him to the stationhouse. There were upwards of 100 ruffians collected about the spot, and before n got there 231 X was deluged in blood, as well as 186 A, who were eventuaUy dragged into the Crown publichouse, whence the former was conveyed to the hospital and the latter to the station-house, where they both remained at present in a very bad state. Witness on his return assisted in securing the prisoner Waltho for assautlting 186 3I. HE stawl hhim take up a brickbat and strike that officer with it on Inspector Mackenzie said he was on duty at the stationhouse on the previous night, when information was brought to him of a riot and attack on the constables in Kent-street. He immediately sent a force to their assistance, when they found the two' injured constables in the care of Mr. and Mrs Bruce' of the Crown publichouse, who at the daniger .f thir live tected them from the uRruly and mur- derous mob. He (Mr. Mackenzie) asked his worship to remand the prisoners, to ascertain the fate of the injured constables. Mr. COsIBE accordingly remanded them for a week, and directed the inspector to inform him if anything sedously affected either of the officers. Shortly afterwards Mr. Bruce, the landlord of the Crown publichouse, attended to ask how he should be recompensed for the injury done to his premises. He was positive that had he not, with the assistance of his wife and servants, dragged the injured conatables into his house they would have been muill.red. In doing so both he and his wife were much hurt, and all the windows were broken by the mob. Mr. CosiBE told him he had ascertained from the inspector and the constable that he had acted-in praiseworthy manner by protecting the officers from the violence of the mob, and he was sure that by a proper representation of his loss the Commissioners of Police would make it good EHe should recommend him to lay the facts immediately before the superintendenLt of police.

IL De Horsey, which arrnved at Sheerness on Sunday last from the North America and West India station, is ordered to be paid off there. During her passge home she experienced very heavy weather. In consequence of the defects of her decks, waterways, topsides, &c., from leakage, there has not been either a man or officer whose hammock or cot has not been perfectly saturated with water either by sea or rain. In her engine and machinery department there are no defects whatever. With 181b. pressure she makes 80 revolutions per minute, with a vacounm of 27, making by log 1OJ knots under steam and mnoderate sail set.

ThoeHilLa Mitchell, hired bark, landed the convict3she took from Portsmouth on the 15th, and the military guard (18 men of the 55th Regiment) in charge joined the head. quters of their corps in the afternoon. .The master of the British brig Betsy, which arrived at Gibraltar on the forenoon of the 13th from the wi stward, reported having seen on the previous day, off Cape Spartel, under saiL a three-maste. steamer, with red funnel and black top, which was supposed to be the British Queen, from Liverpool on tte 3d inst. for Gibraltar and Italy. The agents of the company immediately despatched the steamtug Orient to render such assistanoe as might be required, and at dawn the followitg morning (Sunday) the Orient discovered the British Queen, which she took in tow, and tIhey arrived at Gibraltar aboutt noon the same day. The only inijr which the British Queen had sutained was the shaft giving way on the 9th inst. off the Burlings. She pro. eeded under sail, and would have arrived at Gibraltar nearly at her time had not the 6esterly wind, set in so strongly. Both crew and passengers testioed to the good sailing qualities of the British Queen, and said that few sailing ships could have done better under the circumstanoes. The necessary repairs were being proceeded with, and the voyage would, no doubt, ba resumed in a few days. The Cadiz Boletin de Comcro, of the 13th lust., sttes that the Spanish steamer Douro was wrecked while on her passage from Marseilles on the 6th inst., during a thick fog, off Cape Bagun (coast of Catalonia). Crew and passengers all saved. The French steam sloop FuIton, of threo guns, Cdatain Fauvel, left Cadiz on the 8th inst. for the westward, taldkig in tow the thiee ganboats Stridente, Couleurvine, and Rafale ; and the Austrian steam sloop Elizabetta, Captain A. Wissier, also left that port on the same day for the westward. On the Alhambra's leaving Lisbon the only foreign vessels of war in the Tagus were Her Majesw's ship Princess Royal and the united Statew frigate Constellation. The steamer Hydaspes, pioneer of the European and Amerlin Company's now Antwerp and .Brazil line, after filling all her spare room with cargo, left Lisbon at daybreak on the 11th The Royal mail packt Avon aso left for Brazil on the 14th. Lisbon exchanges by this ma.il were quoted for three months as follows:-London, 53i; Paris, 534; Genoa, 532; Hamnburg, 47; Amsterdam, 41A. On London the supply of bills was rather larger than for the last few packets, with a limited amount of money, whichcnsed the exchange to rise to the quoted rate, and business closed with paper over at that rate. Stock continued at the same prices asby the pre. 'sious mail, but with a slight tendency to improve, as some buyers had appeared. The quotations are as follow:-Three per Cents. Registered, 451 to 46 ex div.; Coupons, 45.1 ex div.; Deferred, 28 to 28&; Bank of Portugal shares, 1L to 11 per cent. premium; Bank of Oporto, 22i to 25 per cent. premium. The Sultan (Perinsular and Oriental Company'ssteaxer), with the out-ard mnails from Southampton of the l7th inst., s8ailed from Vigo for IAsbon on the 20th at 9 45 am. Off Cape Poca, on the 19th, the AIhambra passed the English screw steamer Vasco do Gana, bound for Lisbon. On the 22d, off the Start, she passed the brig Vesta, the Patrican, and the ship William Pierre, of North Shields, with loss of figrehead and part of cutwater, wishing to be reported.
ImPo RTNT T Pmn DESIOX.-A case of considerable importance to agriculturists and turnpike toll. collectors has just been brought under the consideration of the Judge of the Bath County Court. The plaints; named Strange, is the toll-collector at the Swainswick-gate, about two miles from Bath, and the defendant, Mr. MAtthews, a respectable farmer, residing at Charmey-down, 'who baz a steam-engine used for thrasin'g and chaff-cutting rpes which he lets out on hire to the agriculturists in t eih bourhood. The extension of steam machinery to agricultural pursuits has led to a great deal of litigation and disputation between toll-collectors and farmers before the local magistrates in many country districts, and the decisions have been so opposed in different counties that the paries to the pre sont aetion, In a friendly manner, resolved to take the judgment of the judge of the County Court upon the question of liability to toll. There was in this case the peculiarity that the defendant's engine, when passing through the gate was not attached to the thr'ahing-machine, and as -t¶e 17th of Victoria, cap. 135, sec. 6, was expressly passed to exempt thrashing machines, which had previously gven occasion to much ltigation in consequence of ma is trates in different localities having sometimes decided that they came within the term " implements of husbandry," and others that they did not, it was contended by the legal adviser of the plaintiff that though threshing machines were exempt steam-engines were not, and that the defendant was liable to tolL This opinion was confirmed by the Somerset magistratesbefore whom the cose was at first brought; but his Honour hzving, after a good deal of argument on both sides, taken time to considor his judgment, came to a different conclusion. His Honour delivered the following judgmeht at the last sitting :-" This is an action in which the plaititiff as lse of turmpike tolls, seeks to recover the sum of 2;. for toll of a carrge on wheels, drawn by horses, and bearing a steam-engine,-the engine being used for working a machine whicb, when put in action by the steam engine, threshes the corn cuts the chaff, winnows the corn, and puts it into the sack. The defendant contends that the engine is exempt from toll xi an ' implement of husbandry,' writhin the meaning of the 3d of George IV., cap. 126, sect. 32. A doubt was raised as to the jurisdiction of tho County Court, on the ground that the case involved a question of title to tolls. The plaintiff's title as lessee was not, however, in dispute, but only the claim of exemption for the parcular article, and accordingly the case prooeeded upon the merits, the single question being, as before stated, whether the engine is or is not ar Iimplement of husbandry. The term 'implemeiit' has in the abstract no precise or definite meaning, but always derives its signification from the connexion in which it is used. Thus, when we speak of implements of manufacture, implements of household, implements of husbandry, tuere is no diffiuelty in uncdertandinpg that what is spoken of is some Instrument, or tool, or machine usd in carryireg on the particular sort of work or business specified. Now, where words of doubtful meaning or -apDlication are found in Acts of Parliament it is necessary to inquire whether its scope and object are such as to re. quire a verbal and strict or a liberal construction. In the present instance the Act Is undoubtedly to be liberally construed, the manifest intention of the Legislature being by these clauses of exemption to protect and encourage a ri culture. Thu)g m the cLso of IH igginbottomv. Perks' (8 Taun., 801), Chief Justice Dallas, in giving judgment upon a similar question of exemption from turnpike toll, ssys,-' It is an exemptiont Inx favour of agriculture, and to he beneficially construed,' In Guninga a Toteisc on the Zar of Ms, p. 162, the isme rule of constmution is clearly laid down. Now the engine in question is specially constructed, as both prov'ed andi idmitted; for purposes essentia to the carrying on of the farming business, anad it is said to be occasonally used for other pu_YpoN4s such as sawing timber, driving a flour-mill, &o.; but that ita usualand primary application is topurpomse tritlya aroul. turad there can be no doubt. In the proceedings and pnxbli. cations Of 1--noulturaL societies it is classed under the head of "A grcUltural Implements,"l and under that denornina. tk, prime bave been repeatedly awarded to the maanttfac. turer. For thesm reasons I am of opinion that it is exempt from toll as- a n Implemenut of husbandry,1 and that judgment must be for the defendant."
