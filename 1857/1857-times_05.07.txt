I ]:Q?7ALIZATION OF POOIBATRS. Yesterday a deputation from the clergy of the "et end of London, oonsisting of Canon Champney, rctor o AVhitechapel the Rev. G. H. M'Gill, incumbent of Chrst. Church, St. 6orge's lEast; the Rev. W. l'Call, ineumbent of St. Mmars, St. George's East; Rev. G. T. Driffleld, rector of Bow; andthe Rev. B,. C. Smith. Senior curate oF Stepney, had an interview with the Poor Law Boar respecting the equxlization of poor-rates in the maetropo. litan panshes. Canon CAN IArPs said the deputation appeared there onz the part of theirpoorparishionersratherthanforthemae1vss Thelfact was that the West-end was elbowing out its poor; that tho city, which was a city of warehouses, was doing the same; and the great docks at the East-end, acting s as Poverful magnet, attracted the poor from their own loautieg in search of work and concentrated them along tho line of the river. The effect of this was that a or population which did not in any way belong totile east, wag drawn and located there, and as thopoor flowed inthe rich flowed out, so that the district becam. every year rnore subject to high poor-rates, although esery year less able to raise them. It was the desire of thoserepresented by the deputation that this unequal and, as they conceived, unjust pressure should be put an end to by the' equalization of the poor-rates throughout the metropolitan districts; and he submitted to the Board a petition got np.- for presentation to both Houses of Parliament to'this effect,. signed by 36 clergymen in the east end of London representinga population of something like 360,000. Theo PxsI&T of the BOARD (Mr. Bonverie) asked ir the deputation were prepared with any specific plan. There, could be no doubt that as long as the poor were locally maintained there would be inequality of burdens, and thatthere must always be some places where the rates would be heavier than in others. This was inherent in the present system. Then, again, had the deputation taken into consideration the mode in which the rates were to be adminis. tered, as welU as the mode in which they were to beraised? The Rev. G. 3'GixL said they were not prepared to, answer that question but what the deputation asked wa. that the poorer parishes of London should Lot pay in a far larger proportion than the richer towards the support of thepoor. Under the present system the poorer a parish.was, and the less able to sustain burlrdens of this sort, the more is contriWuted to the poor-rate. Thus, the parish he represented, that of St. George's-in-the-East, paid 3s. 4d. in thepound to the poor-rate, while St. George's-in-he-WeaX paid 74d. Moreover, in spite of the crushing rates nowt levied lm the easter parishes of the metropolis the poorwere. not adequately supported. The relieving officer, imagining. that in doing so he was taking care of the interests of the ratepayers gave a labouring man a 41b.-los.f andsa shiling a-week, upon which it was imposible that he could subsist. In fac, if the poor in the districts to °which he was alludinu were adequately relieved, he believed that the rates woult be la s. or M., instead of 3s. or 4s. in the pound. As a. matter of justice they asked that these poor pereons, wholaboured for those at the wed end as wellpasp at the east end, of London, should be supported by both a tlike. Mr. BOUVER1,4-That is precisely the point upon whicf the inhabitants of the xicher parishes would join issue with you. They would deny that they ought to be called upn, "as amatter ofjustiie," to supportyour poor. The Rev. G. Hefari nc-But we deny the poremiss thate teyare our poor exclusively. They work for the benefitpof rich rather t sgd for the benefit of poor diticts ; yet the latter aecaled upon tosupport them. The rev.gentlemamn proceedled to observe that unless something were done to.- remedy the evil complained of the property ian the east end of London must be virtually confiscated. in 1836 the number of in-door por in St. George's-in.the-East was 5213, ouLt-. door poor, 1,27, and the rate collected per quarter, 2,n5e. Since theR there had been a gradual increase under all three heads until In 1856 the number of in-dovor nid out-doorPoor 'was 1,414 and 3,698 respectively, while the rates of pedsurnmer and nr,ichaeImas quarters, 1856, were 7,9741. and 8,4561. To his certain knowledge, some of the parish'oners bad beex obisged to pawn their goods in orderbtac y their poor-rates. He felt convinced that if the poor pa=est :were made to pay beyond their meas in this way, such payments being inadequate after all tosupport those applY*nd for reL ief,oando if the wrcere p ihe s werep allowed to escape,. ith peace pof kL o n d o w o uld n hot c o nt uet isa . T h e m en w ho - not respect parochialebounds. Mr.Bou~sii sid hatwasraterlike an argament. TeRel.G. M'Gi said he ouly adduced it because he feltthat the Goverment of the country was responsible for the peace of the country, and because as a clergyman he wasanxious to see means adopted whereby that peace should bepreserved. or. Bo in wished to bring the deputation back to the practical point before him. Could they go tr o St. George's, Heanover-suare, and ask the ratepayers thered to'contribute towards the support of the poor mn the eat eni of Lonaon? Apgin, were they prenared. to mcaintain thatthe administration of these rates if evualized, should be extill left in the hands of their la auth orities, and thatthey should thus have the privilege of putting their hando. ainto the pockets of th gwnole metropolis, the metropolis having no voice in theexpendliture? The deputation themselves reprewstsen that if the poor'were adequately relieved the rates would be IosO or 129. in the pound. Nowe, theoprestent systemn afforded themost effectual security aginst e 'which could be given, because those whlo adminhtered therate felttha theywererpendingtheirown money. Butsit was a pretty general impression that no such security would be had if the ratepayers knew thatotherpeople's uoneywasn . being ult in relieving their poor.wrsltl extravagance in the expenditure,this would be a less evil thane ith ruinofthd.e aepyersoins tere districts. oBut theyi bade, no rit to beassu that guardaose hof the poordas men of h onour, w ould. not b s c efur o f tc h er pe pr 'si i m on e y as o f t h e ro w I f ia t w e r e h i s c a s ebe tho u g hta h ee m es h o ul d he evenmorecarful f oter eopl's oney than of his Mr. BoTvEmiri.-That sounds wel in theory, but it isnnot found to be the case practically. The Rev. W.Th'CatL thought all London might be regarded as one parish, thesinterests of which were interrningled and"the same. Mi Bouvrr said itwas only questiongof shiftngla turden; but, unfortunately, just in the same prrtion as the east end of theotown wao anxious to shift this burdoen to others the rest of the metropolis would be unwilling to have it shifted. Some persons were in favour of a national rebut he believed that all those who had looked narowly to the subtect tured from such a proposition vrraion shudder. The Rev. P. C. Sagner observed there was an example of *consolidated nrate throughout the metropolis for sanitary 1Mr. otroVE threphled that there was no indefinite, element of extension about that rate as there was soutthe poor-rate. The latter possessed aboertain elasticity, A tendency to expand, resulting from the pressure for relief, which required "the sew " to be put on pretty tightly in order to prevent it from bcoming an intolerable burden. Now, the only security agist extravagant expenditure was, as he had before obervted, in the prnciple ofalocal rating. If they once took off the protection afforded. by that system there would soon be higher rates, not only in the districts represeted by the deputation, but through. ,ut the whole metropolis. Thus the east end of London eould not relieve themselves, while*they would inxvolve heironeigaboum Then,tagain,itwaquitoclear that they could not stop at the metropolis. If Lndon were once made subeet to a general rate for the maintenance of the ior, hedi'd not see that they could help applying the sameprinciple to the whole country, and having a national rate. At all events, he had no doubt the casekof the metropolis, with the rating so altered, would bo cited as en argaijient for a national rate, whereas he was quite sure that the general feeling of the country was against the adoption of such a princip e. CThe Rev. G. ioGmr.-It would be objected that a nat Pnal rato would lad to centralization h ut we do nottsk that any such resultsmneea be feard as regards the. metropolis. Mr. BouvimH-Your system would lead to mwetropolitan cpntralization. TheRev. G. BrGanLm,iclitwasthoughtthatifinquir.yweme made by acommittee of the House of Commons the presentineqruality might be remedlied,and the rich disticts of London made to contribute in proper proportion to therelief of the poor throughout t'he metropolis generally. They had consulted their members, who were unanimous in tgrinlng that thereshould boe an investigation of theo whole matter. - lb. BouvRinu said that as regarded a committee of~ i#quiry he did not think the Government would be da- psd to move for such a committee, and if it were proposed by othera it would be for them to consider the propriety of' a~eig to it or otherwise. He was unable to engage thatIkrdPiallmerston would assent to any such proposal, butslbould probably have some conversation with his Lordshipon the subject. He wished to knowwhether the deputationL bid held any communication with their brethren at the, wvist end of London on the subject. Had they any ideasofthe resistance with which their plan would be maet?f The Rev. G. WGruL said they had no reason to apprehendl any great amount of resistanc;e to the equalizatio o te oor-rates throughout London. At presentthe clergv at the West-end often had alarge amount of money placed in theirbends for pupos of charity, and did not know where tobestow it. The deputation wero moving in this mattersimply because, as clergymen, they saw that, in spite of ail. the burdens of the distriet, the poor were rnot adequately relieved. Canon CrAm,ivs also wished it to be understood that the clergy now represented had no desire to embarrass the Government, but came forward because they felt most keenly the living starvation in which the poor were kept in, the eastern districts of London. He had been 20 years in Whitechapel, and often at his door had poor persons come on the very verge of starvation, receivinga timely mea, which had sometimes saved mother andcehad fromm ' in the streets. The children of their schools had Seen f by hundreds simply to keep them from starving. MIr. Bouvina was afraid this was en indication ihat tkose chmved with the administration of te poor-rates did not do their duty. He was afraid that he hadakeeuer preciation of the dieiltes to be encountered than the deputation seemed to po-sess. But, though he was not pared to initiate any Parliamentary action, he pro&n that if the subject came before te Governmentin this way it should receivefdispacsionate consideration Mr. ?dCALL asked whetber the Government would oppose any apglication for a committee of inquirv if made, by an indepen ant member. Mr. BOUV'ERIE could not undertake to answer this quesu tion. It wm3 hardly right to anticipate what the Govern. meat would dlo wmit respect to anY hypothetical mnotionL i m~htbe ubmttd t th soseof Common&. a mtio wa sumited heywouid decide. e v~~~~~~~~~~~e Aftr smefurhe coveraton hedeputation retied tbanking theoPresident and theBoard for the pjata receipts for the wek .uding May2 10,9414 4d4
MO.YY-MABRKETandCITYI2rTELLIGENCE. Wednesday Evening. The funds maintain their newly acquired firmness, and have closed to day at a further slight advance. Consols for money opened at 93i to J, and remained steady throughout the day, gaining increased strength towards the termination of business, the improving tendency being further manifested after regular hours, when transactions took place at 931 to i for money, and 93 to 94 for the 4th of June. The dealers were occupied with the alrrangements or the settlement vvhich tskes place to-morrow, z,nd, owing to the effect of the partial revival of confidence in stimulating speculators to carry forward their operations until June, loans on stock -were in augmented demand. For short periods 6q Ter cent. was paid, while for any lengthened time 7 per cent. was the lowest rate. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 2]3; Reduced, 92 to 4; New Three per Cents., 921 to i; India Stock, 220 to 222 ;Bxchequer Bonds, 984 to i; India Bonds, .Ss. to 4s. discount; and Exchequer-biUs (June) Zis. to Is. discount, (March) Is. discount to 2B. premium. Owing to the amolnt of bills paid off at the Bank during the past three days the supply of money in the discount market bas been considerably reduced, and the demand this afternoon was therefore very active. It is believed, however, that at the Bank the pressure has much dirninished. The 2,000,0001. of Exchequer Bonds, series C, -wi be paid off the day after to-morrow. The mode in which the sum will be reinvested by the Government on account of the savings-banks is still unknown; but, as the Government broker is understood to have lately purchased Exchequor Bills for the support of that market, it is conjectured that as long 5Ms these remain at a discount similar operations wiU be continued. Foreign sectuities were firm, and prices continue to be well supported. In Turkish the operations for money took place at 9 and i; and for the account at 93gi, and ,. TheFour per Cents. guaranteed were dealt in at 100w for money and ,1the account. Brazilian Five per Cents, .or money, '100k atid 100 ; for the account, 101; the Five per Cents. N-ew, 1004; Danish Three per Cents., 854; Ecuador New Consolidated, 14; New Grenada, active, 230; Dexican, for account, 23J and i-; Russian Five per Cents., 105 and 1054 ; the Four -and a-Half per Cents., 96; the small, 97; Spanish Three per Cents., 414; the New Deferred 254 and 4-; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 654; and Four per Cents. Certificates, 974. The corn-market was steady this morning at the rates of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per -Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were G9f. SOc. for money, and 69f. 70c. for the end of the month, showing a further recovery of threeeighths per cent., chiefly in consequence of money purchases. About 90,0001. of the Australian gold brought by the Anglesey was taken to the Bank to-day. It is uncertain if the remainder will be taken there or sent to the continent; but the expectation is, that a further considerable portion will be retained. The Thames has arrived from Port PhiUip with 4,780 ounces of gold, valued at 19,1201. The continental letters state that the appearance of the exchanges at all points is favourable for this country. At Hamburg the rate of discount has receded to 54 per cent. There is little denmand for specie, and as the Bank of France do not seem at present to be urgent purchasers it is presumed that their stock of bullion is not undergoing any serious diminution. A statement that the capital of the Bank of France is to be raised to 12,000,0001., instead of 8,000,0001. as at first proposed, so that while 4,COO,0001. is employed as a loan to the Government, an additional 4,000,0001. may be available for coninercial purposes, has created satisfaction on the Bourse, although it can have no effect upon the money-market, since this amount can be obtained only by its withdrawal from other channels where it is needed. The satisfactory statement is added, however, that the existing rule, prohibiting the Bank from charging more than 6 per cent. discount, which has been at the bottom of aU the chief difficulties of the establishment, is to be rescinded. Some purchases were offered to be made in Russian railvays to-day at I premium by the persons interested in making a market for them. Scarcely any valid transactions, however, occurred, because the public at large, having refused to take them, can have none to sell, while the few persons who have subscribed for the sake of standing well with the Russian Government or the contractors, are, of course, obliged to resist the temptation of parting with them immediately. The stoppage of an undertaking called the General Wood Cutting Company, with liabilities for about 80,0001., was announced this morning. It had been some years in operation, and the number of shareholders, although it included persons of great respectability, had become small. During the war the company executed a large quantity of work Tor the Government. A dividend of about 10s. in the poundl seems to be anticipated. At the first meeting of the WVestern Bank of London, held to-day, Mr. J. A. Roebuck, M.P., in the chair, the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. In alluding'l to the progress of business and the difficulties with which the Directors have had to contend the Chairman referred to the distinction between joint-stock and private banking, and awarded the preference to the former, expressing a conviction that no injury can accrue to the shareholders unless there be collusion between the Directors and the Manager. He adverted to the failures of Messrs. Strahan, Paul, and Co., and the Royal British Bank, and asserted that in the latter case the absence of dae vigilance on the part of the shareholders had in a measure been productive of the mischief. With regard to the Western Bank of London every precaution has been adopted to secure honesty and prudent management, and the whole transactions are brought under consideration weekly and quarterly, so that conceahnent in any shape is impossible. A regular examination of securities is also made. The Directors, having every desire to satisfy the shareholders of the correct conduct of business, have determined to recommend the election of two Auditors from the general body to inspect the accounts, in addition to those appoinited under the deed of settlement. While having endeavoured to exercise great discretion in regulating their banking business, and confilling it strictly toRlegitimnate channels, the Board confess that the item of preliminary expenses is large. amounting to 13,30(1. Of this 6,0001. has been paid to promoters-a claim considered excessive, but which was settled when the Board were without experience in such affairs-3,5001. for law expenditure, and 1,0001. for brokers' allowance, the remainder comprising salary to the late Governor, P Manager, and Secretary, and advertisements. Much surprise was evinced at this announcement, and as the names of the promoters included the solicitor to the Bank, Mr. J. S. Rymer, an explanation was requested. Mr. Rymer, in reply, stated that, although his name appeared in the letter of the promoters he was not really one of them, but having given an indemnity to bear aU thle p.-enmmiary expenses in case of faiure, and having devoted his time and that of his establishmnent, for six maonths, to the organization of the bank, he thought he was entitled to some remuneration. The expenses included the charter, which cost from 1,5001. to 2,0001. He volunteered to offer to any committee all the details of expenditure, as far as his office wau concerned, and if they were not then satisfied the vote of two-thirds of the Directors 'could terminate his connexion with the bank. A long and irregular discussion then took place, and the Directors were strongly urged to confine their operations to the chief establishment and to abstain from opening branches. In answer to questiona it was mentioned that the value of the investments in Government stock, &c., are taken at the price at which they were pur'chased. About 1,4001. will nowhave to be laid out upon premises, &c., but a portion of the property in Brook-street purchased by the bank, for which 6,0001. has already been offered, remains to be realized. Witb, regard to a suggestion for in. creasing the qualification of each Director from 10 shares to 20 or 50, the Chairman at once stated that if any alteration took place he should immediately retire, as, not being a rich man, and believing that the essentials of management were care and probity, and not wealth, he could not fall in with the proposition. Further discusasion took place, and the number of the Directors having been settled at 15, the additional Auditors were elected and votes of thanks were passed. It was stated that the Board, in the aggregate, hold oue- iuth Qf t shares, and that during the period they have bain in office they have not taken any remuneration. "The directors novw for the first time meet the share. hOlders of the bank, and submit a general statement, ending the 30th of April. The directors ill be prepared to submit a detailedl statement of their profit and loss account after the 30th of June, at the end of their finatoial year. ThiH bank was established because it was believed that the western part of the metropolis needed and could support an independent joint-stock bank. The experience of the past year hau proved the truth of this anticipation, for in spite of unprecedented circumstances, arising from the excited and disturbed state of mind in the mercantile ublic, the bank has steadily advanced, has weekly increased e number of its customers, and by the cautious mode of its proceeding has strengthened the pulblic confidence in its stability and eventual success. This resulit ha, in a great measure, been dule to the lahours and experience of th manager, whose services the directors were so fortunate as to secure. The first auditors appointed under the deed of settlement are Mr. J. HL Williams, actuary of the English and Scottish Life Assurance Company, and Air. J. Nettleten, secretary to the Legal and General Life Assurance Company. TAhese gentlemen, although the time has not yet arrived for a complete audit, have examined the accounts of the bank t p to the 30th of April, in order that the directors might be able to lay before the shareholders a satisfactory statement of the actual affairs of the bank."

RAILTW AY INTELLIGENCE. lNFS'Is 1VT. A N1l.P.Q The directors of this company state in their report that the receipts for the six months ending the 31st of December, 1856, exhibit an increase over those of the corresponding half-year of 1855 on the old line of 865l., and on the guaranteed lines, which during that period had been extended nine miles, of l,1211. It must be borne in mind that on the latter, especially on the Thielt branch, little time has yet been allowed for the development of its traffic. The receipts on the company's lines from the 1st of July to the 31st of December amounted to 20,2751., and the total expenditure to 14,4161., leaving a balance of 5,8591. This balance I eing added to that of the last year ana ;o a sum on account cf the Government gnarantee not yet determined, as weeU as to other small sums, deductions being made for the fixed charges on the undertaking, as well as for other items, leaves an available balance of 5,0241., which will allow of a dividend on the old shares of 3s. 6d. per share, carrying forward a balance of 2411. to the next account. This dividend it is proposed to declare at the meeting of the company in Brages on the 16th of May, and the payment at the offices in London and Bruges on and after the 26thinst. In pursuance of the resolution of the general meeting of the 17th of Mlay and the 27th of November, 1855, the directors have continued to apply the interest on 540 preference shares bought in by them on behalf of the company in the purchase and redemption of the company's original shares, of which they possess 235, in addition to 40 shares purchased in anticipation of the payments to be received during the present month. The report of Mr. Chantrell, the managing director, states that the receipts for the kalf-year ending the 31st of December last on the old line from Bruges to Courtrai amounted to 300,001f. (12,0001. ; on the new lines from Courtrai to Poperinghe, 167,976f. (6,7191.); andfrom Ingelmundserto Deynze, 3S,896fE (1,5561.). The annual receipts on the old line bad gradually increased from 11,7541. in 1848 to 21,9721. in 1856, being an increase in eight years of 87 per cent. In respect of the Government guarantee, the method adopted by Government for determining the working expenses of the guaranteed lines is very onerous on the company and unjust to the old line, which is obliged to bear the difference between the real cost of working the branches and the proportion of the general expenditure which attaches to them under the present interpretation of the convention. An appeal has been made to the Minister of Pablic Work, backed by the written opinion of eminent counsel, fully admitting the jusice of the company's claim, and it was expected that before the meeting they would obtain a favourable solution from that high functionary. The whole of tho lines are in excellent working order, and the working stock generally is in a very efficient state. The servants of theocompany continue to fulfil thedr rsective duties in the most atisfatory manner. The construction acconnt shows that 601,8471. has been received and 594,7571. expended, leaving a balance of 7,0901. TRAPIC RETURNS.

MISS A. GODDABDZS SOZISrz The sixth of these entertnments, and the ILst or the pre3ent year, took. placef yesterday. evening before an gudienoe of connoisseurs amsembled for no other purpose than that of hearing and appreciatingmusio of the higbeit class. They found, as at tho preceding soir&q, exactly what they came for; and, indeed, were not likely to obtain anything else from the concert giver, who has evidently no taste for music that is either flimrsyorrhapsodical, having won her laurels by unflinching advocacy of the best and most classical models. The following Was the short btt Pignificant programme - rA1iT L. SOnataIn A-pianoandviolin. Mozart Air. " Cbefaro'Guk gong, "TheGarlandl Giuendelkoh.

The distbnguihing feature atthese performances, of which, though all deserved attention, we were only able to notice one, has been the later pianoforte sonatas of Beethoven, commencing at Op. 101 at terminating at Op. 1L What are the sesthetic pecnliarties of ties3 sonatas, and what etreme mechanical difficulties they present, we have at. tempted to explain. It remains only to state that miss Arabella Goddard has performed the whole of them in one uninterrupted series, and rithiu a short interval of time--a feat without precedent. Theinterest they exited, livelyfrom the first, augmented with every successive performance; and as one sonata after another appeared, each was pronounced nperiorto that which had gonebefore. Thocli:nax attained last night, in Op. 106, the longest, most'elaborats, and most trying to the player of the five, set a seal upon the artistic' triumph of oar young pianist.; The unvarying refinement of her performance added to its v4gou and animation, and, last not least, the clearnesj and accuracy with which the mninutesc details were elucidated, testified to the enthusiasm that musn'have urged her on -to accompliih the Tery arduous taNk she had met herself for her own satifsetion, no less than for that of comRetent judges Miss God. dard had already twioe in pubhlo successfully attempted this oolossal work, which to the chimber compositions of Beethoven stands iunch in the same relation as thst ninth symphony to his orchestral music; but the third essay far surpassed its predebessors. While the execution of the unparalleled " f7uga a tre vod con acure lictnien' exhibited if possible, a greater amount of finish and briliancy than before, the reading of the first movement was broader; that of the scherzo displayed still more ease and lightness; and, above all, the adagio-the most pathetically expressive of Beethoven's slow movements-was marked throughout by earnestness and depth of sentiment combined with a keen apprehension of its most recondite beauties. This afforded even a higher gratification than all the rest, since it declared Miss Goddard the possessor ofintRllectual qualifications without which the most surprising mainual proficiency is of little worth-qualifications which, in consequence of her unpretending manner when seated before the instrument, were formerly denied her by some who believe that there Oca be no feeling and sensibility unfoss aecompanied by gesticulations, as if te province of a pianist, like that of a dancer, were to aim at expression through the medium of pantomime. We oonfess a preference for that quiet Rngfish demeanour which ehows the performer wholly engrossed in the musio to be performed, and anxious to draw attention to its beauties rather than to her own individal merits. After what has been said it is almost sauerfluous to add that the "32 variations on an original theune0-one of Beethoven's most extaordinary, freaks of fancy-were plaed tcperfection, since, difficult as they are, they are mere ehild's play inthe hands of one who has known how to wind through the labyrinthine complexities of the great sonata in B flat. The graceful, melodious, and unaffected work of Mozart, the violin part in which was admirably executed by MIr. Carrodus, seems to be an especial favourite with Miss Goddard, and gave unequivocal pleasure, anxious as were the audience for the BIethoven displays, which created an unparalleled sensation. After the great sonata, which brought the concert to an end, the whole room cheered the young performer, who, whatever her previous achievements, never before so triumphantly established her claim to be regarded as an artist of the very highest order. The singers were Miss aslle and Mr. Charles Braham. The lady's "Che fari" would have been more acceptable vithout the ornaments at the end. Mr. Braham sang Mendelssohn's graceful song with extreme good taste, and Signor Foss6 displayed his accustomed talent as accompanist.
MUSICAL UNION. The second concert was a very good one. The quartets were Beethoven's in G (op. 18) and Mendelssobn's in D (op. 44). These were potsiblk selected with a viow to comparing the former in his simplest with the latter in his most elaborate manner. At any rate, the comparison was inevitable and interesting. The quartet in G (like that in A, with the variations, from the same set) shows the spiring Beethoven in an unusually amiable mood. His mind must have been in a state of unaccustomed calm during the process of its composition. Haydn himself never gave birth to melodies brighter or more cheerful. It is pleasant to con. template Beethoven-with whom gloom and despondency were too constantly and intimately associated-under such exceptional conditions, allowing his fancy to indulge in a train of thought at oncoeso iunocent and joyous. The quartet in G was written when its author was strongly influenced by Mozart, from the captivations of whose style it was impossible for such a man to escape at an age wheu enthusiasm was youngest. Indications of this may be cited in several parts of the work, occasionally, indeed, bordering upon plagiarism. On the other hand, the quartet of Mendelssohi in its most imnortant movements (the first and last) is fun oft| that restfess and feverish excitement which was an attribute of the man and distinguished him from every other composer. Oily in the two middle movements, among the most exquisite that ever feU from his pen,- do we find the tran- quilhity which pervades the work o£ Beethoven from end to; end, and even here (espeCally in the andante) a deep vein of melancholy suggests the unwilling rest of an exhausted spirit rather than the serenity of an untroubled one. As we have alluded to the influence of Mozart over Beethoven, we may hint at the influence that Beethoven exercised over Mendelssohn, a remarkable instance of which may be found in the minuet of the quartet in D, unquestionably suggested by the minuet of Beethoven's Op. 18 in the same key. The first appearance of Madame -Clara SchumLann was Important, not only on account of her renown as a pianist, but because she performed the whole of Beethoven a magnificent Sonata pa iowta in F minor,-a work too often inartistically presented in a mutilated form. This has never been the dustom with Madame Schumann, who more than 20 years ago-'-as Clara Wieck-endeared herself to all true artists by her ardent love for the works of the greatest masters, wbich she executed in a manner that excited universal admiration. So long and brilliant a career as hers enforces respect. Madame Schumann has won her laurels nobly, and we should regret to be the first to pluck one of them from her brow. I Exception might otherwise be made to her somewhat overdrawn reading of the firgt movement in the Sonata Apasssionata, which was sometiiaes less passionate than spas. modic, and to tEe occasibnal indistinctness of manipulation and frequent abuse of the paWeZ, which marred in a great measure her otherwise very fine execution of the finale. The andante con moto, with variations, although taken too slow, was in many places so perfect in its expression as to be beyond the reach of criticism. We are aware that it is now the fashion abroad, among a special school of pianists, to play the works of classical masters in a manner of which the composers themselveas never had a notion, and which it must he confessed by no means enhances the legitimate, eflect of their music, since it is less natural than eccentric. We rre sorry to find a gifted and accomplished artis like Madame Schumann insensibly falling at this late hour into an error inimical to genuine expression; and we trust that even the admiration excited by her brilliant talents will fail to make such artifices pass muster in England for real musical sentiment, with which they have little in common. The applause bestowed upon Madaame Schumann, who performed the sonata without book, was unanimous. The very faults of such a player are invested with a certain charm; but while in her they may escape animadversion, and sometimes even create enthnsiasm, any attempt to imitate them would be fatal. Mannerism belonas to the individual, and can never safely be adopted as in example. The quartets were intrusted to Herr Ernst, Herr Gofriie, Mr. Blagrove, and AL Paque. With the first-the adnejoi excepted, which was played to perfection-we were not entirely satisfied; but in the admirable work of Mendelssohn the genius of Herr Ernst shone pre-eminent. We have rarely listened to a more spirited and masterly reading of the first and last movements, and have never heard the unpretending minuet, or the pathetic andante in B minor (one of the most characteristic of all the aspirations of Mendelssohn), performed with more consummate excellence. The whole quartet was warmly applauded. In his "analytical programme" tho director of the Musical Union wrtes as follows .- To the students of clasSical pianoforte muslc ve commend an attentive perusal of the ' Sonata Aponaw 'owta w.l our ana:ais, and to iisten attentively to the valuable leson they vill receive from its performacce this day,' if the performance of Madame Schumann had not been more intelligible than the "au alyis' ol Mr. Ella we fear the " lesson" would not have been worth much. We cannot afford space for more than two paragraphs, which we quote as epecimens of tho most superlative nonsense ever dignif&edi with the nAme of criticism. To.. first alludes to the pasage from. the slow movement to the jinake:- "With tbiS discord begins tbeflnarl fr. and at the fifth bar, in rapid C.eseut, hu rIe d from tle top to the bottom of th is nmurmuring tvolcano, as M. Lenz calls it, a h.rritane of net,s plun)ze into the olbes below. a few p3sFagea of octaves iu the Laws dmini. Ieading to the Lubject at the twentietk bar." The second relates exclusively to thelfinale:- - The two melodio figmres quoted, in combination with the agitar;o subject, are sigularl beautiful, and fruiful of imagery to a pocticajI tenlliereininf.

lO0VDON, THPBSDAY, MAY 7, 1857. On the reawoning of our opponents themselves, we might, if we pleased, claim the new House of Commons as a very great triumph. They have aacribed to us a plausible style and penmicious principles, especially suited to the taste of the conceited and arrogant nglishluan. This they say has told on tho Elections. Were it so we should believe ourselves more than umsually represented m the House, and should accordingly proceed to declare our entire confidence in it, and to invite the people of Englund to repose umder its shadow. But it is wholly out of our power to do so. Bad as we are, vain as we may be, crafty as our enemies believe us, we cannot say that we expect anything very much out of the way from the Parliament which meets for business to-ay. Purged though it be of the Manchester School, and some two or three other Schools that were rng up under the authority of this or that name-this or that living profeasor,-it nevertheless is substantiaUy composed of the same ingredients as all formbr British Parliaments. It meets under much the same conditions; it has been returned under the same variety of feelings and influences; and is very likely to act in the main as its numerous predecessors have done. Nor is it expedient to affect a greater confidence than we feel. The theory, and, indeed, the great safeguard of English freedom, is that no such absolute confidence is reposed in Parliament as shall lull discussion out of doors. The theory of an absolute Government is, that it does enjoy entire confidence, and has a carte bllele for all ineasure3 of reform and improvement. it is supposed to be feeling, thinking, and acting for the nation, and so to supersede the necessity of these political operations on the part of the governed or ruled. In such States people may write pamphlets and essays in periodicals, and they may respectfully submit projects to an Emperor or a Minister, but they must not attempt to raise public opinion, to congregate a party, to make an organization, or obtain any social weight or impetus for the creations of their minds. They must trust Government. No doubt there have been, and may be still, absolute Governments that deserve to be so trusted. No doubt a good man, unfortunately for his happiness and virtue, enabled to do just what he pleases, may find it a great help to have no opposition to neutralize, no stupidity to enlighten, no clamours to put down, no intrigues to baffle,-nothing to do, in fact, but pure and simple government. But, it is enough for us, this is not the case of our rulers. They have to fight while they work, and do only a tithe of what they wish, because they otherwise would do nothing. Such are the usual and constitutional circumstances under which Parliament this day assembles and Ham MAJESrys Government meets it; under which, too, the nation looks on. Though it seems harsh to say so, there is no confidence lost among these various parties. What confidence there may be is guarded, held in hand, and ever ready to be withdrawn. What, then, is Govemnent to do, or Parliament to do, under these circumstances I There is a sort of conventional way of expecting each new Session to do wonders, to have a budget of measures somewhere forthcoming, and to intend to do what an ALFRED or a PxTErx the GRuAT might do if blest with a little brief authority over us. But this conventional expectation, if it be not simply foolish, or even malicious, is at all events as inconsistent with the character of our constitution as it is with invariable fact. No Session ever did achieve much of its own. Sesdons may have wound up jobs long in hand; they may have wiped off long arrears; they may have had the benefit of a truce of parties, when the understanding was that both sides ghould divide the honour of the legislation, the one having introduced the several measures, the other passed them. But even in these instances the rseults have been far below the pompous enumerations made by friendly prophets at the opening of the Session. In the present instance there is no truce of parties; there is no accumulation of measures; there is no sudden accession of a political body that had spent a long banishment in the preparation of projects. The articles of the two great Quarterlies in these days are no longer draughts of Bills written under the inspiration of leading statesmen. In fact, the nation has no stock on hand. Wh- ^nce, then, are the measures to come ? The only stock is that which remains from the last Session, opened by a Speech which promised very little indeed, but still more than Mess. COBDEN and GLADSTON permitted it to do. No time has been lost,-not a day, or even an hour,-.yet we are novf getting Into the month of May, and 'Woe to any Bill brought into Parliament later than the lst of July I This leaves us but saven or eight weeks for the introduetion and full discussion of measures; and, if this Sesdon does pass what it inherits from the last, that is as much as we can fairly expect it to do. There were dropped lat year, and consequently expected from the abortive Session of this spring, various measureafor the reform of the law, affecting Marriage and Divorce, Frauds under Trust, and Joint-stock Banks. They, we believe, will be all brought under the consideration of the new Parliament without further loss of time. It Is said, too, that there will be one more appeal to the generosity and consistency of the Legisature in behalf of the Jews, now. the last victims of political exclusion. We need scarcely say that Government does not intend to squander away its small modicum of time in a wild effort at Parliamentary PReform That must hang over for the present. It is necessary, perhaps, the publio should be reminded that there is the usual number of Private Bills, and a very unusual number of Election Petitions; and that the little vagary which has just lost the nation six weeks of Parliamentary action has left private business rather in arrear. Did any of our readers expect more ? Do any deplore that the year 1857 should pass with so slight a harvest of reform ? Are they already drawing ill auguries of the PALM1STON Administration ? Well, there is one course which is open to all politicians, in or out of Parliament, if they are only unfettered by faction and open to any appeal. It is to discharge that duty whi&h we nave awcribed to the Englishman, and which no Parliament can take off his hands. It rests with the public themselves to discover and declare their wants, to embody those wanta in reasonable forms, and to press them with a friendly force on Governments and Legislatures. What, then, are the evils to be amended? What are the measures that the nation wants Lord PAL5EnSTON to pass? What gentle and onstitutional agitations are in progress ? Where are those confessed and crying necessities the neglect of which wil be inexcusable in Government? Now that the great war is over; now that another war is over too; now that we have a House of Commons conveniently divided into a good Ministerial majority and one moderate minority, there is an opening for measures of " progressive improvement," or of even a stronger character, if necessary ; but if they are not introduced-if they exist nowhere in any stage of development or any palpable form, it must be quite as much the fault of the British public as of Legislatures or Cabinets.
Our expectation that news might arrivo of further hostilities in Persia has not been disappointed. Mohammerah was captured by the British forces on the 26th of March. The loos on our side, as -will be seen by the despatch given in another column, was comparatively trifling. By another message from Sir JJ=s OuTrA we learn that the flying expeditionW to Ahwaz, -whither the Persian force retreated, bad returned to Mohammerah on the 4th of April completely successfuL The enemy had retreated towards Dizful, at the base of the mountains, before a small British detachment, a gun was captured, and large military gtores seized and destroyed. Though, in one sense, these gallant operations may be said to be useless, as having taken place after the Treaty of Peace had been signed in Paris, we cannot regard them but as most important and satisfactory. To begin with merely material advantages, there is no doubt that the possession of the plain of the Karoon, between Mohammerah and Shuster, will afford to our army during the ensuing summer the means of establshing a healthy encampment, in a comparatively fertile country, and amid populations which we are told by Sir JAxEss OuTRzAs despatch are friendly, and are sending in their submission. Whatever may be the temperature during summer of the flat countries drained by the Tigris, it is generally stated that they offer a favourable contrast to the insupportable heats and malaria which prevail on the shores of the Gulf. As, then, the Persian territory is to be occupied until after the evacuation of Herat, it is no small matter that before the cessation of hostilities we should have secured possession of a district where our troops may remain in health and plenty. Delays may arise from accident or from the evasions of the Asiatic Power to which we are opposed, and in any case it is as well that our troops should not be compelled to pas even one July in Bushire or on the rock of Xarrack. But the moral effects of the victory are of even greater importance. The Persians have not had Frenchmen, and German, and Rumsians among them for so many years without learning sometbing of their own strength and weakness; nor is there any reason to believe that the Court of Teheran, with all its ignorance, has been without a certain acumen in this affair. The false account of the battle of Khooshab, andthe description of the British return as a retreat, are very well to salve wounded vanity or to animate a discouraged people, but the STAn's advisers, whether Dative or foreign, know that the real strength of the country lies in its inaccessibility. in fact, a descent on Bushire might -well lose its terrors for a Court which had found by experience that the operation hitherto had led to nothing. Persia, certainly, might be unwilling to part with her only port, but still might decide to brave the power of a nation which seemed unable to do more than occupy a point on her coast. For the third time British troops had appeared in the Persian Gulf with hostile intent, but never before had they advanced into the country far enough to alarr even Shiras and the cities of the South. We cannot wonder, then, that there should have been plenty of advisers ready to counsel the masterly policy of pasive resistance "Let the English take Karrack and Busbire; they "can do nothing else; they only wish to frighten "you, and if you are not frightened they will be "glad to make peace on any terms, and to get rid "of the barren rock and the decaying town, where "fever and cholera are hovering over their troops." So would say Russia, so would say all the naturalized adventurers, and native cunning would feel the force of the argument. We doubt therefore whether the capture of Bushire alone would have exercised much influence over the Persian Court for the future. We had only done what we did years ago, and we should retire as we had retired before. "What can " England do ?" would have been the taunt always in the mouths of Teheran politicians. " Russia can " attack us, conquer province, and keep them; "even Affghans and Tartars worry us in the East; "but England's only notion of a campaign is to "come to our shores, take a town, and then go "bacl: again." But the capture of Mo'hammerah is a very different operation. It meas, anfd will be felt to mean, that the British Government is resolved to make its power felt and respected, even by a resort to the last extremities. The capture of Bushire might have been called a demonstration,the capture of Mohammerah was the beginning of a campaign. It tells the Persida that, if forced into conquest, we will conquer. The capture of Mohammerah means the occupation of Khusis. tan, of the VaUey of the Tigris, of the whole Persian Gulf. The SHAH is made to feel that the question of peace with England concerns the very existence of his empire. Thus, not only the brilliancy and completeness of the victory itself, but the determined policy of which it has given sign, are calculated to have their influence throughout Central Asia. Nor can the secondary advantage of an ascendancy over the Arab tribes be forgotten. Already, we have Lttle doubt, the story of the fall of Mohammerah has been told all through Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Kurdistan. The despatch relates that the Arabs are friendly and submissive; and there can be little doubt that the influence of the Englisn name ovor those wild races will be much strengthened by the exploit of Sir "GAXES OUT.&sr. The event has taken place at a good ibme. A principal obrtacle to the improvement of those regions has been the independence and uncontrolable spirit of the Arabs. Even now, in any discussion relating to the development, of Asia Minor and the Valley of the Euphrates, it is generally urged that the wandering tribes are too irreclaimably savage to permit civilization to enter the lands they occupy. Such an event as the capture of Mohammerah and thoencampment of a victorious British army among them -iust do much to establish an influence which future enterprise may turn to good account. For all these reasons, while regretting that our troops should have fought a second battle after the war had been virtually terminated and the news of peace must have been on the very point of reaching them, we cannot but hope for many benefits from their galLant exploit.
Good laws, it is said, originate in bad customs. According to this rather cynical doctrine, our Statute-book, we dare say, might be held to prove, not the vigilance of the Legislature, but the depravity of the nation-not the wisdom of Parliament, but the inveteracy of the ill-doing with which it dealt. There was one country which enacted penalties against parricide of a strange and frightful severity; there was another in which no name existed for such a crime. Which oI these should be considered aa recognizing the obligations of filial piety in the greatest degree? The answer might leave room, perhaps, for a good deal of casuistry, and certainly, if we wera to apply a similar test to our own laws, and attempt, as an example, to ascertain from their provisions whether England was distinguished or otherwise for purity of practice at Elections to ParElainent, we should be likely enough to find ourselves in considerable perplexity. As an illustration of the extent to which legislation on this subject has been carried, let the reader attend to a case heard in the Queen's Bench on Tuesday last, and observe the remarks of the Judges on the allegations and arguments produced. In a certain town during the late Elections a poll was taken after the usual fashion to decide between the claims of two rival candidates. A father and son were bakers in the place, and, were canvassed during the proceedings, and on the very day of the polling, by a clergyman who, in more than one capacity, was a large customer for bread. He requested the votes of the tradesmen in question for the candidate of his own choice, and, as it was alleged, had coupled his application with a distinct threat of withdrawing his custom in case of refusal. The bakers, however, 'voted the other way, the custom was withdrawn, and then came the proceeding against the clergyman for "u undue influence." As it happened, the features of this particular case rendered the application of the Act less difficult than it might have been. On one aide it was affirmed that the threats alluded to were made in plain language, and under circumstances which left no doubt of their nature or purport; on the other these allegations were denied, and the Court held that the denial went to the substance of the charge; so that no points of refinement or complication arose in the interpretation of the law. A few words, however, will soon show the perplexities which ouch cases may involve. By the Statute in question it is enacted, that " every person who shall, directly or indirectly, by " himself or by any other person on his behalf, "make use of, or threaten to make use of, " any force, violence, or restraint, or inflict or "threaten the infliction,byhimself or byorthrough " any other person, of any injury, damage, harm, " or loss, or in any other manner practise intimri- dation upon or against any person in order to "induce or compel such person to vote, or refrain " from voting, or on account of such person having "voted or refrained from voting at any Election, "he shall be deemed," &c. Now, the offence thus constituted, it was held by the Judges, would be undoubtedly committed by any threat to withdraw custom from a tradesman on account of his not voting as desired. If, in the case before the Court, the defendant had so acted he would have been amenable to the law; he escaped only because he was able substantially to rebut the charge. But now observe what a field is opened for doubt, conflict of rights, and litigation. Of course, no man is entitled to influence by intimidation the suthage of another, and of course a threat which would involve a loss of daily subsistence amounts to intimidation. But, if a man's vote is his own, so also is his custom. If he has a right to select his member of Parliament, he has a right also to select his butcher or his baker. Such dealings, like thoughts, are always held to be free. Lord CAMBUL. wisely discriminated as follows -" After the EBedt" was over, of course " every person would be at liberty to employ " whom he pleased as his tradesnen, but " ot during the BlZeio to threatem to with"draw his custom." A canvasser, therefore, might make up his own mind to punish a noncompliant voter, and might execute his resolution, provided only that he abstained at the moment irom intimating his determination in actionable terms. Any man has a right to take his custom where he pleases, but not to use it at a particular period as an instrument of compulsion against the opinions of another. This offers some escape from the difficulty; but how, then, are we to understand the last sentence of the clause above quoted, which makes the infliction of harm or loss actionable if exercised " on account of such person having " voted or refrained frowm voting," &c. Do not these words cover also proceedings posterior to an Election 7 Suppose A. B., having been a good customer to C. D., asks C. D. for his vote, and is refused. Suppose he says nothing at the time, but discontinues his dealings with C. D.; and then suppose C. D. could bring his action and put A. B. on his answer as to the cause of such discontinuance; if A. B. should admit that he had withdrawn his custom because C. D. had voted for an obnoxious candidate, would not this amount to an infliction of harm on account of a vote given at an Election, and be an act punishable accordingly? Yet, of all practices in the present day, what is more common than that of exclusive or partial dealing-of dealing decided by the political or religious sympathies of the parties concerned ? Dissenters deal with Dissenters, Papists with Papists, Jews with Jews; may not like flock to like also In the case of Conservatives or Radicals ? Such exclusive fellowship and mutual alliance has sometimes been rather serviceable than otherwise in protecting the infancy of opinion, and if there is a right of selection there must also be a right of change. If one man has taken his custom to another on the presumption that he belongs to a certain fraternity, and then finds out his mistake, is he to have no power of retracing his steps ?. Observe, again, what a specious colour may be given to the proceeding. A man admits that he has withdrawn his custom from a certain grocer on account of the said grocer's vote; but what if he alleges thst the candidate for whom the grocer voted held opinions unquestionably deserving to be proscribed, or that the voter had promised to vote otherwise; that he had voted otherwise at former elections, and that therefore, irpetively of any political question, he had lost his title to confidence by his tergiversation or bad faith;-would not these be cognizable arguments ? In the very case before us the defendant alleged that, though he had indeed withdrawn his custom, it was because the tradesman had " made false state"S ments," was " a dangerous person," and " un"worthy of credit." We avow ourselves advocates for freedom of opinion and purity of Election to the very utmost degree in which these blesings can be secured, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the very sincerity of political convictions often carries intolerance in its train, and that it may be hard to circumscibe the operation of this intolerance without trenching upon the liberties of the individuaL Take, for example, any ardent follower of Mr. BRIG}T or Mr. COBDNu,-and they have many such, no doubt,-might not he think war so incalculable an evil that no man who promoted it or supported its promoters waa a man with whom he could satisfactorily maintain any dealings ? Might not an enthusiastic partisan on the other side declare he would have nothing to do with those who had no sympathy for the valour and efforts of our soldiers ? Take a stronger case stiU -that of religious differences. It is possible, we believe, to find men who would rather go without meat altogether than buy it of a butcher who had given his vote and intere6t in favour of tenets opposed to their own. Takle the whole case, in! short, in its general application. What in the world is to be the result in a country town after an Election if no man can take his custom from a " blue" voter to a " yellow" voter without being liable to proceedings for so doing ? It appears to us that the Act has become applicable to trahsactions with which it was never intended to' interfere. Its object no doubt was, as Mr. Justice Ens remarked, to secure the voter in the calm emercise of his judgment, to eliminate the operation of selfish motives on his decision, and to protect his private interests while he was discharging his public duty. In so far as it may accomplish this end, and prevent the tyranny of the opulent or the powerful over the weak and needy, its provisions are unquestionably beneficial. The case before the Court, for instance, if it had been fairly established, involved the exercise of what might have been justly termed intimidation, aud what therefore it was most desirable to put a check to by law. But dealings may take place not only between superiors and inferiors, but between equals or nearly equals, and in the great majority of cases must be of this kind. Such dealings are practically determined on both sides in their origin as well as their continuance by a thousand different motives of partiality or preference, and how political sympathies are to be exQn ed from thia list we confess we findl it hard, ta understand. Finally, as the question of ' agen' is to be introduced into this matter as well M that of bribery-if every candidast is thus open to attack on all the counts of treating, bribery, and unduly influencing, either. by himself or by aome other person on his behalf, where is the man who can be sure that he has escaped this taint of universal Sin?
The public will have great cause to complain of the ATroaNzy-GEsNm&L if he allows the late Directors of the British Bank to ride off triumphantly upon their own disclosures of their own frauds. Can the law in its existing state touch these men? We believe it can. Eaough appears upon the face of the examinations recently taken before the Bank. ruptcy Court to justify the conclusion that an indict|ment for conspiracy to defraud certain persons can be so framed as to touch at least some of the Directors of the Royal BritishBank. That the point is encumbered with legal technicalities we are well aware, but they are not of such a character as to present insuperable difficulties to the sdil of a practised criminal lawyer. Sir RiC}D BmEm has not yet moved in the matter, but he should be made aware that the public look to him, as the highest executive law officer of the CowwRw, I for protection against the recurrence of similar offences against public morality and the security of commerce. Many and important as are the avocations of the QuEss ATToRro -GnsomA, no more imperative duty rests upon him than to ascertain if these Directors, or any of them, can be made amenable to the penalties of the law. Sir RIoCnAD BETHLL, although we believe he has not himself practised as a crimnal lawyer, can eaily command the assistance of other gentlemen who have devoted their attention more particularly to the prosecUtion of criminals. Let the two or three best criminal lawyers in the country be fairly charged with the duty of ascertaining if such an indictment us the one named can be framed with reasonable expectation of prosecuting it to a successful issue. If this can be done, the matter should be followed up without delay; if not, at least Sir RICHARD BErnr wil have the satisfaction of feeling that he has done all that lay in his power to bring the criminals to justice. If the law break down in his hands, that is no fault of his; but, as long as there remains a hope of visiting these offenders with the punishment due to their crimes, do not let the matter be cast aside as one not even doesrving of investigation. It would be impossible, in the brief space to which these remarks must be confined, to go in detail through the variou5 considerations which have led us to the conclusion that an indictment for conspiracy to defraud certain persons can be framed and sutained against at least as many of the Directors, inclusive of the Deputy-Chairman, as were connected with the late transactions of the Bank. It may well be-we hope we are wrongbut it may well be that the wholesale embezzlement, in point of fact, by which the earlier transactions of the Directors were characterized does not amount to embezzlement in point of law. Let the case, however, in all its details be submitted to the judgment of two or three of our most skilful criminal lawyers. It will be for them to consider whom they can reach, and who may go free,-not because they are less criminal than their fellows, but because the law of England, which has slain men by the score for stealing small sums, is unable to reach more notorious criminals, who have swindled those who trustedthem out of enormous sams of money. Let the case of each man-EsDAIE, STAPrx=ON, CAMEROBN PErATr, HurEMY BROWVN-, and the rest of them-be carefully gone through, and at least let an effort be made to bring them to justico. Sir RIcu&AED BzYnxx will be guilty of a gross dereliction of a most solemn duty if he allow this case to sip through merely on account of a popular prejudice that nothing can be done in it. If it is so, it is a disgrace to our laws; but there is abundant ground for seeing if the law is really so impotent. The necessary investigation is not a very costly proces, and, as it wil be transacted in private, no harm will be done in case of failure.

TElE LATB LADY ASHBUBTON. Amid the grief that will be felt by many relations and fiends for the death of Harriet Mary, Lady Ashburton, which occurred at Paris on Monday last, there is a place for a wider and less private sorrowr; for, although notoriety was most repugnant to her nature, yet her remarkable qualities, when combined with her high social atation, had made known her name and extended her influence beyond the circle of those she honoured with her friendship or delighted with her intimacy. To them, indeed, may wel be left the memory of her deep affections and of her more private virtues, but there is carcely a man of any political or literary eminence in this country who may not claim a part in the recoLection of her intelligent sympathy and just consideration. Married young to a man of great intellectual and moral worth, she has for the last 30 years enjoyed a position which it would be pedantry not to acknowledge as one of much public utility. The hospitality of Lord and Lady Ashburton has in all respects been honourable to English manners; it has been open to all excellence and liberal to all opinions; it has shown the luxury of wealth compatible with simplicity of life, and mental superiority without a taint of pride or affectation. It is the mistress of Bath House and of the Grange who has now passed away in the prime of life and in the perfection of her facultiesa bnoble English lady, who in a country where the authority of 7women is less jealously watched and more willingly admitted, would have been a public personage, but who here has been content to limnit her genius ti> those uses that circumstances have allowed and caustom has sanctioned. This is not the time or place nicely to delineate the character, or to balance with an accurate hand the merits of tbis distinguished lady. But in an age and country where the charm and grace of sodal existence daily become more rare, the departure of one who possemed those qualities in so abundant a measure must not pass unnoticed. If the profusion of her wit and the brightness of her raillery sometimes astonishea a society accustomed to a vapid and colourless conversation, they were all the more attractive to graver minds wbich comprehended with how much reflection and with what just perception they were accompanied. In fact, it was through the veil of her fine humour alone that her aingular good sense, her penetration of character, her solid information, and, above all, her deep love of truth, were fully to be traced and understood. Her apprehensions, so to say, of moral and intellectual greatness were so large that she shrunk from brmging her own klnowledge and that of others to the test of ordin&ay discussion, and thus, we fear, has left behind her little written evidence of her great powers. In the same spirit her intercourse with men of letters and of science Was utterly devoid of any notion of patronage, and she showed a marked dislike to draw thea out or use their abilities for any other purpose than that of proraoting their pleasure and her own. Thus, too, in the dibtribution of her wealth, she avoided the common currents of charity, and devoted it mainly to the comfort of those with whora she had some local relation and over whose interests she exercised a close personal superintendence. Lady Ashburton never aspired to fame, but she coveted the love and the respect of the good and wise; and it can be the only consolation of those who were dearest to her to feel how fully this deire has been acoomplished.
IRELAND. ]2;C1tTBEMRrT 'PC:ATV- II.qr (FFBO OUR OWN COR'S3PO.DENT.1 DUBLIN, WEKDZAY MORfNG. Another portion of the Portarlington estates was put up for sale yesterday. It comprised upwards of 7,000 acres situated in the county of Tipperary, and was offiered in 19 lots, the gross net rental of which was set down at 2,7001. a-year, but estimated at a much higher figure according to Griffith'. valuation. Eighteen of the lots were quickly disposed of, one having been previously sold by private contract. The amount realized by the sale was 42,2811. There were four other sales of properties lying in the city of Limerick, the counties of Clare, Carlow, Meath, Dublin, and Sligo respectively, the whole of which produced the round sum of 47,0001. THE cOLOLoUGH WMIL CAS The arguments to change the venue from Wexford to Dublin in the new trial ordered by the House of Lords commenced yesterday morning before the Lord Chancellor, and, not being concluded at the rising of the Court, the wordy warfare is to be resumed this morninz. It is computed that the protracted proceedingsin this extraordinary case have already cost the litigant parties a sum of not less than 30,0001. There is a formidable bar engaged on both sides-indeed, nearly all the leaders in Chancery hold briefs. X3IGATION FR10t SOU. One of theLimerick journals (the Repoffer) writes in a tone of alarm at the continuance of the population drain. The people, it is said, are literally flying in thousands from the Irish shores. If emigration proceed at this pace the Limerick journal fears there will not be hands to till the soil.

THE CHINESE IN BORNEO. The followinIg interesting letter, written by a lady, resident in the house of the Bishop of Labuan, at Sarawak, at the time of the Chinese insurrection, has been forwarded to us for publication - "SARlAWAK, MARCH 17. " We were arousedsoon after 7 o'cloek on the nightof the 19th of February by a most alarming uproar,-guns firing. 'shrieks, and yelLa. At first I thought that it was some Chinese New-year rejoioing, but- was quickly undeceived. I ran to Mrs. M'Dougall's room, and was miet by the Bishop wAho told us get dressed immediately, as he had no doubs ',ut that it was the Knngsi. These Chinese lived at Bauh, :about 30 miles up the river, and were gold-washers. From -the north verandah we saw the flashes from the guns, and *ho light from the torches discovered to us a most dis. orderly rabble. In a few moments the Rajah's house burst into a flane, with Mr. Crookshank's to the left and Mr. - i_ddleton's to the right. The fort was soon taken. We assembled in the dining.room,-ourselves, the school peoplo and the two families of Channons, expecting evory moment some dreadful fate. The Bishop 'kelt in the midst of us and commended us to God. It was all he could do; resistance would have been vain. We started once for the jungle, but he recalled las; flight was impossible with such a party. Till morning dawned we sat aud watched in agony for the fate of thoso around us. With early morning came a Malay, who told us tbat the Rajah had escaped; that Mr. -Crookshank was wounded; and that Mrs. Crookshank 'was lying near tho ashes of her house severely wounded. A man then came from the Kungsl chief to tell ms that we had nothing to fear, that the Bishop was an 'orang baik' (good man), and they did not wish to injure im. They saent for him to tend their wounded. Meanwhile everything was prepared to receive MIrs. Crookshank, lout tho Rungsl around her would not let her come. Three 'times the attempt was made, until at last the Bishop obh tained permission to receive her. Poor thing ! the wretches surrounded tbem before they heard them. They tried to escape through the bathhouse; her white dress betrayed her, and a Kungal gave her a fearful gash in the thigh. She fell, of course; her busbandtried to defend her, but vas obliged to fly. He had a cut in his arm. She crawled i?rom the spot whore she fell and tried to hide, but thoy aliscovered her. Her fortitude and self command are wonderfuL The IRajah had been very far from well, so that Panty (his servant) slept in the room next to his. He was aroused, and at once saw that flight was his only safety He escaped through the bathhouse, sword in hand, and swam across a creek, and went to the Datoo Banda's, where MIr. Crooksbank joined him. Mr. Nicholet, a youth of 16, on a visit to the Rajah, was killed. Middleton escaped, but his two little sons were killed, and Mr. Wellington, who came out with us. Mrs. Middleton escaped almost miracuiously. "The 20th passed heavily. The Bishop, Datoo Banda, MIr. Helms, and Mr. 1uppell met the Kungai in CounciL After this they went away. The Bishop obtained the consent of the Kungai to msnd away his wife and family to Singapore. They made the distinction between us, as British subjects, and the Government people here. At 3 o'clock (Friday, the 20th) Mrs. M'Dougall, Alan, the two children, and I, went in the lifeboat, intending to join the Goodluek at the mouth of the river. The Datoo Banda at that very time expressed his determination to follow the Kungsi to Bauh. Mr. Ruppell was determined to go to Singapore. Mr. Helms wa3 lost In tho jungle, thus leaving the Bishop alone in this terrible extremity. On Saturday the Datoo followed the Kongai up the river, bat was unable to effect anything. Evorything seemed so ,q'et that tho Rajah thought of returning. The Bishop raot him at Tanah Puteh, and on his return told all to be 'ready for flight at a moment's notice. Sunday morning the Kungsi camne again, The Rajah came up in a boat, but the 11alays were worsted. The misoreants were left in possssion, and they immediately set fire to the Malay vilage. "I n the meantime we reached tho Goodluck, but found it (a small sehooner) so crowded with fugitive Chinese that we at once decided that it was impossible to go to Singapore. It was quite late at night, and our orew deserted us, when Mr. Helmis most fortunately arrived, after having hid in the jungle all day. He took us to Yemang, a Malay -village; we stayed in the boat that night and were received into a native house on Saturday. In the night Mrs. ZDougall had a letter from the Bishop, teling us to go up -again with Middleton and Orymble, who then joined us. We did so the next day, but soon saw the smoke from Huchin, and, not long after, the boats flying from Sarwak. Poor Mrs. Crookshank was lying at the bottom of a boat withoutanymattress e took someinandaUlmetatYemaug, where we divided-the Bishop, Mrs. M'DougaU and the -children, Mr. and Mrs. Crookohank, the Stah1s, and Channons and school for Linga; Mr. Tidman, Miss Coomes, and myself, with Mr. Helms, for Sambas; the Rajah and his folowers in a Malay war-boat. It was a dreadful night. On the next day, about midday, we descried the Sir James Brooke entering the river and were soon on board. The lajah almost immediately came up, and we went to Sarawak amid eager preparations for war. A few shots from our great guns cleared the place of the Kungei. We proceeded to the Malay viUage, where the Rajah was most joyfuUy received, and, returning, anchored before the town. A large " Bals" was collcted from all quarters. In a few days E3lidah was retaken, Bauh, Sininwon, &c., burnt to the ground, and the Kungsi driven from the country with the loss of nearly 1,200 fighting men and all their treasure. Our church, house, and school stand, but property of every kdnd has been carried away or wantonly destroyed, except the books. The cup and paten belonging to the communion service have boen recovered. AU the valuables were carried away, wearing apparel, &c., out to pieces; but we are well off compared with others. TheRajahas lost every. thing. He now wears tho native dress, and lives in the fort, which has been strengthened. He is, indeed, a noble man, so unselfish, so kindly thoughtful for alL, and so energetic in all his plans. The loyalty and devotion of his native subjects have been a great support to him. He applied to the DuLtch Government for help, and a war steamer arrived from Singapore on Monday. The work is done, but it is pleasant to know that there is help so near. The Bishop has been staying at Linga, a small fort about 10 miles from Benting, Mr. Chambers' station, without books or occupation, but obliged to stay with Mrs. Crookshank. She is now out of danger, and wind and weather permitting they will be here on Friday or Saturday. I sha'l have the house in somewhat better order; but if you Ihave never seen a house which has been ransacked and pillaged you can have no idea of' what it is."

THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS. TO Ta EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Yoir correspondent " An Administrmtive Reformer," in a letter headed " Public Accounts," in your paper of this day, brings a charge against the Government of supporting what he calls the " net system," and of not publishing the gross accounts of the Public Income and Expenditure; but his letter contains a refutation of his own asser,tion, inasmuch as he gives at the foot of it the gross amouints, taken from documents published by .the Government. Your correspondent does not appear to be aware that the accounts of the Pnblic Income and Expenditure, which are now laid before Parliament, and published every three months, give the gross results -both of inicome and expenditure, and that gross as -weU as net accounts have been published for many years in the annual Finance Accounts. The truth is that both statements are constantly caUled for by members of Parliament, and that the Government publishes the accounts showing both the gross and the net income and expenditure, in order that it may meet the wishes and wants of all.

PlTNGE ALBERTS VISIT TO SALFORD. SIMSld OUR O0V FRnoTIR.R MANCRESTER, MAY 6. According to the programme originaUy laid down, hi8 Royal Highness the Prince Consort, after the, opeDing of the Art Treasures Exhibition, was to have presided at a grand inaugural concert at the Freetrade-hal the same evening. The lamented j death of the Duchess of Gloceater frustrated this arrangement, greatly to the disappointment of the Manchester amateurs, who had justly regarded the musical entertainment as forning the moat appropriate finale to the Art inauguration of the day. Hia Royal H ighness passed the evening quite privately at Aboey-hall, and the concert, thus shorn of its chief attraction in the eyes, of the public, had nothing to recomzmend it but its music, and consequently excited only slight attention compared to what was anticipated. The Prince's visit to Salford to-day wvas one of the most thoroughly popular displays we have ever witnessed. The interesti excited by it among the populace was in no respect inferior to that taken in the opening of the Art Treasures Exhibition itself. In order that his Royal Highness might ce enabled to leave Manchester at 12 o'clock all the proceedings were fixed to take place at unusually early hours. Visitors who had the good fortune to be provided withticketswere requested to be in their places at the premature hour of 8 30 a.m., and p-unctuality was insured bythe Albert-bridge leading to Salford being close_d at 9 o'clock precisely. Perhaps, under these circumstances, it was 'quite as well that any great demonstration, such as the concert was intended to have been, did not take place the evening before, or a considerable number of the rank and fashion of Manchester would have had to witness the proceedings at Salford the last thing before they went to bed. With the ordinary street crowd the early hour seemed to make no difference, and all the various thoroughfares leading to Salford were tbronged long before the hour fixed for his Royal Highness to pass. Nearly every house was decorated with a profusion of f9ags and streamers, the weather was magnificent, and aU looked as gay and cheerful and as animated as could possibly have been wished. The Salford Museum and Free iUbrary stands almost in the centre of Peel-park-a fine piece of ground 32 acres in extent. It is called after the great statesman in consequence of his having contributed 1,0001. towards its purchase for the people of Manchester. A fiuz bronze statue of Peel himself, by Noble, stands in front of the portico. The Free Library attached to the Museum was instituted under Mr. Ewart's Free Libraries Act, on the 7th of January, 1850. The late Lord Ellesmere and the present Bishop of Manchester were, we believe, the main contributors of bools and money towards its institution. It started in 1850 with 7,000 volumes. Since that time the building has been considerably enlarged, at an expense of 9,0001, and the number of volumes has been increased to upwards of 20,000. At present there are 3,000 regular borrowers on its books, 800 of whom are women in the humble ranks of life. Since its foundation a steadily progressive improvement has taken place in the class and character of the works most used. A new wing to the building has just been added, which the present exhibition of the paintings of local artists most worthily inaugurates. It was arranged that the address from the Mayor and Corporation of SaLford should be presented to Prince Albert in the reading-room of the Museum, after which, and having been conducted through the various rooms of the collection, and inspected the works of local artists, the inauguration of the statue of Her Majesty should take place in the park. The reading-room was filled with a select party of visitors, among whom were-The Earl of Burlington, the Dean of Manchester, General Sir Harry Smith, Sir J. Patter, M.P., Mr. Aspinall Tumer, M.P., Mr. N. Money, M. P., the Hon. Neal Dow, Mr. Langworthy, Aldermen Ross, Higgins, Mr. Wanklyn, Mr. 0. Bradley, Mr. J. Wright, Sir B. Heywood, &c. At a little after half-past 9 o'clock his Royal Highness, accompanied by the Mayor of Manchester, the Marquis of Abercorn, Viscount Torrington, Major-General Grey, General Seymour, and General Ponsonby, arrived in Royal carriages at Albert-bridge, the boundary of the borough of Salford, where Mr. Heels the Mayor, was in waiting to receive him. The ioyal procession then proceeded to Peel-park, and the distinguished visitors alighted at the main entrance of the Library and Museum, where a guard of honour was in attendance. Thence his Royal Highness was immediately conducted through the handsome library to the reading-room. His reception here was perfectly enthusiastic, and the cheering was prolonged for some time. His Highness, who was dressed in deep mourning, appeared much pleased and struck with the hearty cordiality of his reception. Having taken his place on a raised dals, Mr. Heelis, the Mayor of Salford, accompanied by the Chairman of the Library and Museum Committee, advanced, and in a clear and impresive voice read the following address:- "To HIS ROYAL H ionNEss TrE PRINGS ALBERT, CONSORT Or HEiR MOST GRACIOUS MAIJSTY THE QUESN. "We, the Mayor, Aldermer, and Burgesses of the borough of Salford, in the county palaUne of LAnoster, in council assembled, beg leave to approach your Royal High. ness with feelings o-profeund respect and devoted attachment. We esbrcoe the opportunity afforded by your Royal Highness's visit to this neighbourhood of tendering our hearty congratulations on the recent birth of a princess, and the prospect of Her Majesty's speedy restoration to her usual health and strength, and we would add our earnest hope that this addition to the R oyal family circle may not only prove a source of happiness to the august parents, but may conduce to the cementing more firmly, if that be possible, the ties and obligations of a loyal, devoted, and affectionate people to their beloved Sovereign. We deeply regret that Her Majesty and your Royal Highness have to mourn the loss of her Royal Highness the Duchess of Glocester, the last of a now bygone generation of the Royal family of Eng. land,-- lady not more exalted in station than generally be. loved and respected, and endeared to the nation by a long life of unostentatious virtue. We sincerely oondole with Her Majesty and your Royal Highness on this bereavement. Your Royal Highness's visit to Manchester has for its object the promotion of an attempt made in the great community of which we are part to afford a pure, innocent, and unprecedented means of refining and elevating the taste, feelings, and intelligence of the people at large, which attempt, with God's blessing, we feel msredwill be crowned with complete success. We are awre that when Your Royal Highness first consented to bestow your patron. age, and to endeavour to procure that of Her Majesty, to the exhibition undertaken with such views, and now opened under such favourab e auspices, it was your expresed wish that it might result in something permanent, and that It should not be what its predecessors apparently have been,ephemeral. We are therefore emboldened to draw your Royal Highness's attention to the building in which we are now assembled, and the library and museum which it contaius, and to put forward their claims to be in some degree anticipatory of your Royal Highness's desires. The original btuilding and the park in vwhich it stands were purchased by voluntary subscription, aided by a slight and insignificant grant out of the fund which had been placed at the disposal of Government for such purposes. Since that time very considerable additions have been made to the fabric at the cost of this community. The libracy and museum have been formed principally by individual contributions, .iome of them of a muificent character in point of amount, and we hope we may point to the facts that since the opening of the library and museum in January, 1850, they have been visited by 2,362,619 persons; that the books lent out amount on an average to 72,000 annually, and the number of readers in the library to 100,000 anuuaUy, as proofs of the estimation in which the institution is locallv held, and the advantage taken of the facilities which it affords. It may be proper also to inform your Royal Highness that the estimated value of the books and the articles in the museurml is 15,0001. We would recall to the recol- lection of your Rolal Highness your former visit to thia park, in October, 1851. On that occasion Her Majesty was graciously pleased to receive an address from us, in the prcsence of 80,COO Suuday school children and teachers-an assemblage without parallel in its chacter, and one of which we believe Her Majesty and your Royal Highnses have a pleasing recollection. To commemorab th at visit therehaf been executed and recently erected ix the park a statue of Her Majesty,which we respectfully pry your Royal Highness to inaugurate. A substantial amous.oSt heI cost of that statue has been defrayed by the zoluntary small but hearty contributions of children ant) teachers, from whose minds the remembrance of what jAsed cannot be tffaced, but who have been desirous of haxAing down io posterity the memorial o£ an event in which, tey wre- personaly engaged, which 'bought them into. the pr4see" of their revered Sover :gn, and which formna a.bright. w,t in tbai% existence. eWrtmthsat youx Pa Highun wilJ convey to Her Most Gracious Majesty the expression of what we beieve to bo the feeling of the thous'%nds of her yon7 g subjeots who were present in October, 1i51, and our own cordial sympathy with that feeling, along w.th our assurance of devoted loyalty and attachment, and our earnest prayer that she may long be spared by Providence to reign over these reabms and a united and prosperoize pw,ple. " Given under the common seal of the said Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the said borough this 4th day of May, 1857, "S r i S HE,, Mayor." As the Mayor ceased there was again a long outburst of cheering, which having subsided, the Prinlce read the followting reply:- "Mr. Isyor, Aldermen, and Gentlemen,-I thank you with sllmy heart for the addres3 which you have presented, and for your warm expressions of cttachment to the Queen. It must be very pleasing to her to find her subjects uniting with her in joy and satisfaction in any event which tends to inorease ber happiness and that of her family, and, on the other hand, sympathizing with her in her sorrow when the inscrutable decrees of Providence have visited them with affliction. "M My presence here to-day may testify to you, in return, that any object which may be designed for the advancement of the prosperity and happiness of her people commands her personal interest and solicitude. " I may be aUowed to congratulate you upon the achievement of a work of such usefulness to this vast community as the creation of this Park, Library, and Museum, giving at once the means of healthful recration and mental improvement to a population employed day after day, wthout relief, in the monotonous labour of factory work. "I congratulate you, however, particularly, upon your success in proving to your fellow-citizens that these means of recreation and improvement are objects worthy of their individual exertions, and on the fact that they have them. selves made tho sacrifices which were necessary to procures blessing to them, which they will doubly feel as their own. "The statistics to whioh you have referred, sbowing the number of persons who have availed themselves of the boon, amply testify that this is the case, and that any attempt to graft upon the Art Treasures Exhibition, now attracting the attention of Europe to Manchester, a permanent institution would be in accordance with the spirit of the people, and would probably succeed in furthering obiects the benefit of which, for their welfare, they have learnt to appreciate. " It is with pleasure that I comply with your request to inaugurate the statue which loyalty has erected on the spot where the Queen met for the firt time your body, in the presence of 80,000 children enjoying the blessing of school tuition. That they may grow up an addition to the aotive powers and strength of their country is my anxious wish, and may succeeding generation, seeing the Queen's statue in the midst of this park, findin its contemplation an assurance that where loyalty and attachment to the Sovereign, as the representative of the Institutions of the country, are linked to an ardent love of progress, founded upon self-reliance and self-improvement, a country cannot fail to prosper, under the favour of the Almighty." 1 The Right Rev the Lord Bishop of Manchester then presented to his Royal Highness the following, address of the Institutional Asociation of Lancashire and Cheshire - " To FIELD-XiRSHAL is ROYAL HIGnmEss PnrucE ALBERT OF SAXR-CoBUiG AwD GoTA, K.G. "May it please your Royal Highness,-We, the Central Committee and delegates of 100 associated lancashire and Cheshire Literary and Mechanics' Institutions, represent- ing 20,000 members, of whom upwards of 6,000 attend evening classes for elementary instruction, beg leave lo approach your Royal Highness with the assurance of our devoted loyalty to the person and family of Her Most Gra- cious Majesty our beloved Queen, and to offer our grateful acknowledgments for the honour and advantage conferre upon our association by the patronage and support of your Royal Highness. ,-The first free itinerating library in Great Britain of clesified and systematically arranged books was commenced by this association in 1852, but, as its extension depended entirely upon the contributions of the wealthy, only six boxes of books were collected and issued in the firast year of its operation. " Early in 1854 your Royal Highness munificently aided the effort by a donation of books eminently calculated to instruct aud improve the workdng classes In those great social and domestic duties which belong to the citizen and the parent, and tend to promote his health, comfort, and general wellbeing. "From the day when your Royal Highness's gift was re- ceived by this assooiatlon the books have been in constant and active circulation, and it will doubtless be a source of gratification to gour Royal Highnoss to be informed thAt eaoh of the volumes relating to health and domestic economy and management hu been ised and re-issued 300 times among male and female factory operatives thus afFording the most gratifying proof that the improvement of home, family comfort, and sooial respetability are objects of warm interest among our artisans. " Indeed, we may venture most respectfully to express our convictiou that the stil more rapid progress of our operatives as good and valuable members of society Is chiefly hindered by the pre ailing want of information and absence of training upon the subject of home, Its wants, and how to sapply them. "The deep interest tiken by your Royal Highness in this subject and the response by the peoplo themselves to the endeavours so graciously made for amehorating the condition of the homes of the labouring population will, we trust, be found a.qouroe of oncouragement and consolation to the efforts mace by others to promote so benevolent and important an object. " In instituting a series of public and private ex amintions of the members attending evening classes, upon the subjcts forming elementary education, with the tntentioa to distribute to succeseful candidatee honorary rewards and certificaies of merit, we [shall, we trus, meet with the gracious countenance and approval of your Royal Highness. " We humbly yet warmly thank your Royal Highness for the devoted interest you manifest in the welfare of every institution having for It8 object the extension of knowledge and the elevation and refinement of taste. Youir gracious patronage to the Institutional Ass iation Is an encourage. ment to our efforts, and while it is a strong incentive to our renewed exertions it assures at the same time the factory operative, and the agricultural labourer, and the aris n of Iancashire and Cheshire that their intellectual culture and soci lamelioration reeive the anxious consideration of the consort of our beloved Sovereign. " That our gracious Sovereign, your Royal Highness, and your Royal offspring may be long continued to promote the advancement and the elevation of an enlightened, prosperous, and grateful people is our earnest prayer to the Divine Author of all Good," His Royal Highness then, accompanied by the Mayors of Salford andMadncheater, and attende d by his suite and official visitors, walked leisu relythroughthevarious rooms of the Museum. For those devoted to the reception of the different stuffed specimens of natural history a very slight inspection ufficed ; but his Royal Highness remained a considerable time in the new wing, where a really fine collection of the works of local arists was displayed. At the door of this wing he was met by Mr. Hamraeraley, the Chairman of the Exhibition, who, on the part of the local artist, presented the Prince with a brief address. The party then proceeded to inspect the collection of paintings at their leisure, those most conspicuous for any particular feature either connected with the work itself or the artist being pointed out to the attention of the Prince by M1r. E nmnqrsley. Amnong the paintings which most attracted the at. tention of his Royal ighiness was "a Family Group," executed with much boldnea b olf fstyl an d individuality by Mr. R. Crozier. A work by Mr. Bradley, numbered 112 in the catalo-ae, and " The Peasanta' Holyday," by MIr. hi?rk Anthony, came in next for admiration. A portrait by Bradley and another of Liverseege, by the same artist, with a very carefully finished view in North Wales by Mr. H. a. Whaite, received marked attention . A companion p icture to the last-mentioned subject, also by Whaite, and one by W. Keeling entitled "Love's Mesenger," were much admired. "The Master is come and calleth for thee," a most perfect and feeling realization of its subject, by F. Stone, A.R.A., detained the Prince for some time. " Spring," a light and genial little work by J. Chapman, and a moat beau- tifully finished pair of iews of Derwenttwater and L och K atrine by Mr. PI>yl, drew my expressions of warm commendation from his Royal Highness. Among the water-colour drawings the two that elicited more admiration than any otbers an thhs room were a family group by J. Bostock, a very beautiful work , and an exquisite landsca'pe by W Hull. Before these his Royal Higbnews remained some time, The inspection of the LecalArts ER hibition being over,the party proceeded through the Mluseum to Peel-parkto inaug-urateth ef- statu Q of Her Most Graciousa Majesty. The statue is erect uupon the spotiro m vwhich, wher, in 1851, the Queen visited Manchester a ad Peel-park, she saw an assemblage of no I les s than 80,001) childre f'.om t te Manchesesr andL ~;aYordi free sschols. The statue is placed to cerameirorste this event, a nd&, as the inscription on IU X pedea states q s. la.Xe portiou of the expenses I connected with its erection were met by penny contributions from the little children themeelves. The cause and manner of its erection sender it one of the most touching memorials in the kinggdom, and one of which both the people of Manehester and their Sovereign may well feel proud, and look upon with feelings of no ordinary emotion. As the Prince emerged from the Museum the figure was enveloped in a long mantle of linen which concealed its fine proportions till the meinent should arrive for unveiling it. A proper cazwpied platform, covered with scarlet cloth, was erecaed in front of the statue for the Royal party. On the west was a platform for the privileged public, and on the east a large galleryaccommodated upward& of 2,000 children from the Sunday scools. Draperied gallries for the accommodation of ladies adjoined these, ao that the statue was quite surrounded, except on that side facing the Free Library and Museum. Beyond the galleries was an immense concourse of spectators, who pRshed and strove with laudabletenacity for the best places, aa, who seemed fearfulof missing even the most ordinazy detail of the proeaedings of the day. The neat parterres in Peel-park suffered sadly by this pessistent loyalty. Tulips, lilies, and violets were soon rendered literally as "dirt under their feet," and a year's careful hortieuIture will hardly remove the ruinous traces of one day's extreme loyalty ox the part of the crowd. The Prince Consort having taken his place under the canopy, the MIayor of Salford, addressing him3, said:- " The statue which is now before us, and which I have now the pleasure to ask your Royal Highness to inaugurate was erected to commemorate the vit of Her Majesty to a place in October, 1851, aud her reception on that oeca. Sion by a concourse of Sunday-school teachers and scholars, to the number of at least 80,000. Many of these are now here present, and I am sure they joia With me in fervent prayer and cordial wish that this may long remain a sttue to our Sovereign's honour, living as eho does in the hearts of her affectionate subjects, and that she may long continue to reign over a prosperous, united, and loyal people." After these few remarka his Royal Highness bowed, and, giving the signal, the figure was instantly unveiled, and amid a Royal salute from artillery and that beat of all Royal salutes, the tremendous cheers of a loyal people, a noble figure of the Queen was displayed. The statue is decidedly one of the best of the many of Her Majesty which we have had occasion to remark upon. It is colossal, relatively speaking; that is, the actual statue appears about nine feet high. It represents the Queen in her robes of State, and in the bloom of womanhood. The likeness is perfect, and its attitude portrays with surpassing fidelity that calm and unaffected dignity which so distinguishes the Sovereign. The artist appeas to have shunned coldness as much as exaggeration in striving after effect, and in avoiding both extremes has attained the difficult medium which secures success. The taste and sdill of Mr. Noble in both design and execution have never been more conspicuously displayed. At the base of the figure is the following inscription in gold letters - " To commemorate thevisit of Her Most Gracious Maesty to7ihe Peel-park, Salford, October the 10th, 1851, this memorial was erected by the contributions, aided by publio subscription, of 80,000 Sunday-school teachers and scholars, who were present to welcome Her Majesty on that joyful oocasion.-THoxAs Aecraw, Mayor of Salford." His Royal Highness then, accompanied as before by the Mayors of Salford and Manchester, and attended by his suite, took his departure, escorted by several of the 7th Dragoon Guards. The cheers as he quitted the park were almost deafening, and more hearty and continued acclamations could not have been bestowed upon the Sovereign herself. The guard of honour followed the cortege, and the procession closed with the fieldbattery of artillery which had fired the salutes. The whole route through Manchester was a continued ovation. The great thoroughfare of Market-street was completely blocked up with thousands of spectators whao made the very air ring with their incessant cheers. In this manner his Royal Highness proceeded to the London and North-Western Railway-station in the London-road, whence, precisely at 12 o'clock, he started for the metropolis in a special train. The very interesting nature of the proceedings of course attracted the dite of Manchester to Salford, and in so far affected the first day's attendance at theArtTresureExhibition. 3evertheless, the number of visitors was very considerable under the circumstances. In consequence of a considerable time being required to remove the benches, chairs, and other small furniture provided extensively for the opening ceremony the publiE were not admitted to-day till after 12 o'clock. Tomorrow it is anticipated that the attendance will be still more numerous. Before leaving the local artists' exhibition his Royal Highness expresed his gratification to Mr. Hammeraley and stated that he would be most happy to give his patronage to a local fine arts aca'.demy such as alluded to in the following address:- ADDRxss TO mS RoYAL HGim-Ess PRr;CE ALBxERT FROM THE EXECUTIVE COMSITTEE OF THE PxgtPARiK ExHBITiox or LOCAL ART. " The Executive Committee of the Local Art Exhibition in Peel-park, Salford, feel themselves highly honoured in being permitted to address Tour Royal Highness, and in thus joining the citizens of Mauchester sod the burgesses of Salford in a cordial and respectful welcome to this district. " The Executive Committee of the local Art Exhibition in Peel-park, Salford, desre, in addition to this general welcome, to address your Royal Highness on a question vitally related to the advancement of the fine arts in this county-an advancement in which It is wel known your Royal Highness takes the warmest interests. " Your Royal Highness yesterday opened to tbe world a oollection of the art treasures of Great Britain, thus sub. mitting to universal gaze, to universal improvement, a collection of art thoughts such as the world has never before had an opportunity of beholding. This act placed your Royal Highness before this country in a position unknown since the days of Pericles. With all respect we say that yesterday's event related a Prince Royal of England to one of the most potent engines of civilizetion, and art received one of its crowning honours and most lastng tributes by the presence your Royal Highness conferred upon it. Yesterday thus saw the union of arts, and all its genial influences, with the magnificence of State, and the countenance of a friendly Royalty, distngaished for its intellect, its widespread goodness, and its domestic virtue. The event of yesterday Is an English, a European, a world's event. it was unique in its kind, but so far as art is concerned it must necessarily be somewhat fugitive in its result, And it is the balief of the Executive Committee of the Local Arts Exhibition at Peel-park that your Royal Highness desires art thoughts and art endeavours to have a quite general and permanent foundation and inflaence. Under this belief this committee desires your Royal Elighness to examine the works of the artists of this district, and to give your friendly aid to a desire to give a decidedly academic character to art effort in this locality. "This committee venture to think that art, if merely centralized, is of little public good; under the influence of this idea the committee who now presume to addres your Royl Highness hope that you will giv your name and patronage to a proposal to create a Manchester Academy of Fine Art, the obiecs and purposex of this academy being the consolidation of art labour in this city and neighbourhood. The only object of this academy would be that of instrucinkg its members in the night principles af art and of sprading ameng its patronsa right appreciation Of beauty.

When the horses were drawn up in a line they were thrown into confusion by the brealdig away of Dulcamara, Codrington, Cardsharper, Van Dunck, JAnet, Drmour, Peeping Tom, and December; Codrington and Dulcamara. ran to the stand before they were stopped, and Card3harper, overpowering his rider, went twico round the course And was notstopped till he had gone the entlre distance to..be run over for the Cup. At about 20 minutes past 4 an admirable start waseffected, Commotion being first off. but on turning into the straight he VAR joined by' Bay Hilton, Peeping Tom, and: Van Dunck, Thus they passed the Grand Stand the. first time, and on rounding the top turn Vin.. Danek showed slightly in advance, Commotion belng in lose attsAdance, Cardsharper, Gemma di Vergy, and' Riseber foUowving in the order named. On entering the-Dee. side of the course Cardshapex rushed to the front, Van. Dunck and Commotion lyng side by side next, Peeping Tom and Gemma di Vergy in couples next. On re-entering. the straight Commotion went up to Cardshrner, and on passng the Grand Stand the second time was running nearly head and head with him, Via. Dunck going on third, Gemmna di Vergy fourth, Peeping T-m, Tarbit, and Drumour heading the ruck.. In. the extreme rear were Igight and Cumberbnd, who, were at thi point pulled up. On going along the Deeside of the couse the second time Commotion took a clea.lead, and Duleamara drew into the second place, Gomma di Vr going on third, Risebei and Lance next, nearly abreast witb Drumour, and leamington in their wake side by side. Conmeotion held the lead round the turn, when he dropp back, and Riseber waa,.le}ftin possession of the lead, PukLmara being second, Gemma di. vergy third, Ieamington and Dramonr fourth and fifth. At the distarce Leauiingien drew to the front and headed. Riseber, and Cemma di Vergy was soon afterwardsgbeaten. DTumour in the next few strides " split" Riseber and Dal. camals, and took seconA place, but coutd not quite reach. Leamington, who won by a neck; a length between the second and third.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. [Aportionof the following appeaed in oursecond edition of vtsterdav :-1 (FROMI OUR OWN COBRREPONDNT.) PARTS, TuzsDA&Y, MAY 5, 6 pm.. The Neuchatel question, which everybody believed and hoped was, after so many delays and difficulties, disposed of, seems pretty nearly as far from a final settlement as on the 1st of April Iast. Wl'hat will next be done it is difficult to say. Switzerland accepted the decision of the Representatives of the Powers, to her great mortifica. e tion certainly, but still she accepted it, and was prepared to abide by that acceptance. But the King of Prussia apparently did not mean to do so, as he now demands further modifications. If the King did not intend to abide by its decision, why did he consent to have the matter settled by the Conference ? With undue acerbity, little generosity, and no slight injustice, the Monitentr has already administered several reprimands to the Confederation. The Confederation knew better than the Emperor of the French what sort of man the King of Prussia was, and the reliance they placed on his word was measured by that knowledge. The Moniteur, that was so ready to whip up Switzerland for the slightest slip, will now, I trust, be just and courageous enough to lay the lash upon the Royal defaulter of Potsdam. One of the Emperor'sMinisters said, inthe course of aspeech he made the other dayat the inauguration of a section of the Western Railroad, that the Sovereigns of Europe were coming to Paris pour s'incliner devant Naprceon III." This, which would be mere bombast in the mouth even of an old Bonapaxtist, was more extraordinsry in the mouth of a gentleman whose political antecedents were by no means Imperialist. An order, it is true, was sent round to the press to publish the speech only after the version in the Mon iteur, and the flight to which the orator rose inter pocula was lost to the world. The erasure, howrever, does not imply that such a belief ts not entertained at the Tuileries. If so, the King of Prussia, as one of the Sovereigns who has " inclined himself," vicariously, and in the person of his nephew,will no doubt submit tothe same treatment which Switzerland has received. We trust, therefore, that to-morrow or next day the Moniteur will contain one of those stern lessons on good faith and moderation which have hitherto been only dealt out to the weak. What the next phase of this affair will be I do not venture to say, but I doubt if the Confederation will make a single concession more. As it is, the dissatisfaction in Switzerland is great, as the guarantees awarded to Prussia unquestionably gave a power of intervention, and it is not probable the Federal Council will do anything to increase that exasperation. A private letter from Bologna (Papal States), dated the 30th of April, speaks of the effect produced in that city by the official announcement of the Pope's approaching departure from Rome. A rumour to that effect had prevailed for some time, but until it was officially communicated few believed it. The season for quitting Rome has not yet arrived, and various conjectures are hazarded on this premature movement. There are two great festivals of the Church-Corpus Chrigti and St.Peter -which faU in the month of June, and which are invariably celebrated by the Pontiff in his capital. It is thought that there mnst be some extraordinary reasons for his now departing from that custom. Can it be that His Holiness thinks he has had sufficient of French surveillance, and that he has been persuaded to intrust himself once for all to the care or custody of the Austrians? A few who have confidence in the sincerity of the Pope's intentions, and his anxiety for the welfare of his subjects, think that he has resolved on introducing at least some of the reforms which have been so often promised and so long delayed; and a task which would be difficult, if not impossible, at Rome, under the eye and influence of Cardinal Antonelli and the Sacred College, might be of comparatively easy execution in a distant town of his States. So long as Cardinal Antonelli is by the side of the Pope the chances of reforms are slight indeed. His influence is that of a strong will over a weak one; and whenever Pius IX.. appearm disposed to relent the Cardinal is sure to turn him from his purpose by drawing a picture of the fearful consequences which would follow any relaxation of the present system. Cardinal Antonelli remains at Rome during the Pope's absence. The letter to which I allude says that great surprise is felt at this determination, and some apprehension lest the Revolutionists should be troublesome in the meantime. The Emperor went at 1 o'clock yesterday to visit the Grand Duke Constanitine, and presented him with the grand cordon of the Legion of fHonour. The Prince went in the evening to the Grand Ora to witness the representation of the ballet of m_aco &peada. The Grand Duke, accompanied by his suite and the members of the Russian Embassy, attended, at 10 o'clock this morning, at the Greek Chapel in the Rue de Berri (Faubourg St. Honor6), where a religious service was performed in honour of the f8te of the Empress Dowager and of the Grand Duchess Nicolaiewna. The congregation was chiefly composed of Russians, several of whom were presented to the Grand Duke. The fact of this being the anniversary of the death of the Emperor Nanoleon I. led several people who were not fanilar wvith the Greek calendar to suppose that the religious service was commemorative of that event, and that his Highness only meant to pay a delicate compliment to Napoleon III. After the servicethe Prince proe6eded toViuceimes,rhere he had been invited to breakfast by the commander of the fortress. Experiments were made at the Polygon for the satisfaction of the Grand Duke, who, as a matter of course, greatly admired the skill and accuracy of the artillerymen. He dines at the Russiau Embassy this evening. The Grand Duke conversed a good deal with Marshal Pelissier at the ball given by the Minister of Marine the other night. Their remarks naturally turned upon Sebastopol. " When I heard that you had taken the command," his Highness said, " and that you had selected the Malakhoff as the point of attack, I knew that the place must fall, and that it was only a question of time. Our object was to prolong the defence till winter." What the other Duke said is not recorded. It is said that his Highness is to be named an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences of Paris. The 36th anniversary of the death of Napoleon 1. was celebrated as usual at the Hotel des Invalides. A mass in commemoration of the deceased was celebrated by the chaplain of the Invalides, in presence of General Count Ornano, the Governor, the General Commanding, and the entire stafK. Places were reserved in the nave for the great bodies of the State. M. Billault, the Milister of the Interior, attired in mourning, and wearing the decoration of Graiid Officer of the Legion of Honour, attended, as also did Baron de Lacrosse, Generals Lafontaine and Foucher in uniform, and General Pelet in the costume of senator, M.Larabit, Colonel Laborde, and several members of the two Chambers and of the great bodies of the State. On the right of the tiquet d'honeur, formed of invalides. were placed delegates from the veterans of the Empire, attired in their old-fashioned uniforms. The Princes of the Imperial family attended the service in the Chapel of the Tuileries. The Ohurch of the Invalides was filled with private persons, and a number of old soldiers came to pray forthe repose of the soul of him whom,when living,they regarded as a demigod. The eight magnificent lustres pre- sented oy Prince Jerome were lighted. After the ceremony the old soldiers were permitted to visit Napoleon's tomb, and to pray in the chapel of St. Jerome, in which the ashes of the great man aro deposited. The appointment of the Abbe Canino Bonaparte to the dignity of Grand Almoner to the Emperor is now decided on. The GrandAlbnonry will comprise three distinct branches, and three First Almoners, p laced under the jlurisdiction of the Grand Almoner. The branches will consist of-1. The Emperor's Household. 2. The War Department. 3. The Marine. The Bishop of Nancy will remain First Almoner of the Emperor's Household. the Abbe Coquereau First Almoner of the Fleet, and the Abb4 Parahere First Almoner of the Army. The following is the text of the exposg des motifs of the Bill presented to the Legislative Body, opening a credit of 180,000f. for the purchase of the tomb and habitation of the Emperor Napoleon I. at St. Helena:- " The Emperor has charged us with the mision of presenting to the Legislative Body a Bill for the purchasa in the Ifsland of St. Helena of the residence of Longwood, and the tomb in which for 20 years the mortal remains of the farst Napoleon were deposited. The exhumation of 1840 did not remove everything from the Island of St. lIelena, rs two great relics still remained there-an open prison anid an empty tomb. But industial pursuits and speculation do not riways pause or bow before Tespect for great men. The residence of Longwvod bas been appropriated to the uses of an agriculturai establish. ment. The house in which Napoleon resided has been converted into a farm building; a barn stands in the place where ho diotated his ideas; and the room where he breathed his last is now converted into a stable. His tomb has also undergone deplorable trans. formations. The ground in which the remains of the Emperor lay belongs to a private individual; Amen. can speculation disputes the possession of it with the patriotism of France. It was necessary to put an end to these profanations. The Government of Her Britannic Majesty interposed its good offices to enable France to pur. chase these relics-a testimony of 80 muoh granderV and of such great suffering. T hanks to its intervention, the domain of the State will extend beyond the ocean to that land where unequalled destinies 'were accomplished. Under a preceding Government the shore where St. Louis expired in the Regency of Tunie, near ancient Carthage was consecrated by a mausoleum. A homage as striking wll be rendered to the Emperor, who died undez the sun of the tropics. Two great souvenirs will thus be raised at the two extrminties of that African land which our arms have opened to civilization. Places visited by glory have their immortality, like heroes. MIarked by an nnexampled event, the smaU Island of St. Helena is, in the midst of the sea, an historical monument. Nothing will ever efface it from the memory of man. The Imperial LouvTe will not eclipse the house at Longwood, nor will the crypt at the Invalides throw oblivion on the Atlantic tomb. The whole of France will thus unite in the august solicitude which surrounds vwith a fresh veneration these profaned relics, and rescue them from mercantile degradations to restore themto the piety of history."

The diplomatic conflict between Germany and Denmark, to which the present Ministerial anarchy in Copenhagen has for the present interposed a trace, is one that threatens to bring the two countries sooner or later to the sad realities of war. The conflict has been going on for nine montbs now, and there are at length evident symptoms that it mrust soon come to a crisis; the various European Powers, on whose assistance, as againt Gernany, the late Minister, Von Scheele, reckoned, have declined to back Denmark in the course she is pursaing towards the German Duchies, which, as members of the German Confederation, have a claim upon Gerrmanyforsupport. The retirementof HerrvonScheele from political life, whether temporary or definitive, will produce but little change in that course, forming as it does a main feature of the policy of the national party in Denmark; this course is d.e fended as being the consistent prosecution of the principles recognized and guaranteed by the six Powers of Europe (the great Powers and Sweden) in the London Protocol of 1852; for it is in the name of "the integrityof the kingdom of Denmark," guaranteed by that Prctocol,that the Danish Government is striving to crush the German Duchies into an amalgamation with Deumark Proper at the eacrifice of their nationality, their language, their guaranteed rights, and their property. To meet the necessities of the Danish exchequer that Government proceeded last summer to dispose of certain State domains belonging to Holstein and Lauenburg, the disposal of which as national property is vested in the Estates of the two Duchies; this forms the salient point of the present conflict with Germany, but it is only a single and a small point of a much larger question at issue. To the remonstrances put forward by the two German Powers on this head last June the Danish Government took four months to answer, and, when the answer did come, it contained neither justification of the past nor promise for the future. In a few weeks Austria and Prissia remitted to Copenhagen renewed statements of the German grievances which they found unredressed by the Danish communication, and to this second representation Denmarkansweredonlyaftera lapse of threemonths. The nature of this last Danish reply was so indicative of a determination to proceed in the course adopted that the German Powers had no other alternative, prior to breaking off all diplomatic intercourse with Denmark, than to inform the Danish Ministers at Berlin and Vienna that if a satisfactory arrangement were not made within three weeks they would bring the matter before the Bund at Frankfort. The form which the ulti-atuum of the German Powers assumed was that of an inquiry whether the Danish Government was willing or not to afford to the Estates of Holstein and Lauenburg an opportunity, by the convocation of a Special Diet, to express their own resolutions with regard to the changes lately introduced into their constitutions by the Danish Government without fist consulting them, and whether the right of complaint is to be left open to them in all constitutional matters. This ultimatum was conveyed by word of mouth to the Danish Ministers in Berlin and Vienna on March 28. The period left for consideration on the part of the Danish Government was three weeks, but, as the expiration of that term found the Danish Cabinet in a state of thorough anarchy, the German Powers caused the assurance to be given in Copenhagen, by their representatives, that, bearing these circumstances in mind, they should not look upon the abeyance of an answer as a refusal. That is how the matter stands at present between Germany and Denmark. The motion that was lately made in the House of Notables here, and the resolution then passed, " to call on His Majesty's Government, in conjunction with their allies, to continue to exert themselves to procure the guarantees (given by Denmark to Germany with reference to the Duchies) to be respected," contributes very little in any way to a furtherance of the cause. This cause is one in which the whole of Germany, the entire population of every State, is perfectly unanimous; and if foreign Powers withhold all interference in this matter, one which lies solely between the German Confederation and the Duke of Holstein and Lauenburg (the King of Denmark), Europe will be surprised by the rare spectacle of Gernany being for; once ina way unanimous. One peculiarity of the above. mentioned motion having been made and adopted in the House of Notables is, that it was the same party and a former First Chamber in Prussia that a few years back passed a resolution condemnatory of the Schleswig-Holsteiners in their struggle -with Deamark, and in favour of the authority of the Duke of Holstein being restored in his duchy. The present movement has, therefore, nothing in common with the Schleswig-Holetein affair of former days, and involves no disputed points of constructive political and constitutional rights derived from documents of the dark ages; bui, on the contrary refers to spe. cific obligations entered into, signed, and sealed by the King of Denmark in 1850, 1851, and 1852, in his negotiations with the German Powers. The only |thing worth reporting connected wvith that motion is, that the Mqinister-President, during the preliminary discussion of it in comunittee, stated that-. "HEe should not oppose the motion; on the contrary, he recognised the good intention which prompted it-the more o,FO as it was strictly in conformity with the course hitherto pursued by the Government. lhe subject, howeover, must be approached very delicately, seeing that diplomatic negotiations were still pending, and that Prussia attached great value to aoting in concert with Austria, and must avoid in any way appearing to agitate for her ownvi ews within the confines of the Confederation. Pruia wa fully determined, in concert with Austria, to extend to the German Doohies the due protection of their rights, and to embrace for that purpose the course kept open to that end by their constitutions." The motion passed all but unanimously in the Houe o Noabls, or f te treevoies hicldi not join the 83 in its favour one objected on merely formal grounds The courae the Ministerial crisis is taking in Copenhagen proniises ill for a speedy settlement of the conflict with Germany. Herr von Scheele was not compelled to leave the Ministry and public life by the approach of this conflict, but by dissensions with his colleagues on the subject of Scandinavism and the management of the Sound Dues' subject in the Rigsraad. In all the negotiations which MMI. Andrae and Hall, two of the surviving members of the late Cabinet, have carried on with Baron ScheelePleEsen and with Baron von Billow to induce them to accept the poi4euilles of Holstein and Foreign Affairs respectively the former have steadily refulsed to draw up any distinct programme for the future Ministry in which justice to the German Duchies should form an item. The conseguence is, that up to the present time no new Ministry is formed, although it is now nearly a month since Herr von Scheele went out. There are no more statesmen left in Denmark to be applied to, and there will soon be nothing left but to take Herr von Scheele back again. The plan which the Danish Ministers hadput forward for employing the amounts received for the redemption of the Soind Dues in paying off entirely or in part the foreign debt of Denmark, for which the Sound Dues were security has been set aside by the Danishmajority in the kigoraad, and in its stead it is now proposed to found with the money a " Sound Fund," in order, as they state in the plea they put forward, that it may remain a memento that this money is the produce of a " Danish dc.main," so that, in case of the present domain question being settled in favour of the Germad, Duchies, the entire 30 millions of thalers arising from the redemption of the Sound Dues may be recognized as the property of Denmark alone. Now, these Sound Dues that have just been redeemel have always hitherto figured in the budget of the entire monarchy, i.e., kingdom and duchies, and have been raised not simply in the Sound and Belts, but also in the Eider Canal, that runs between Schleswig and Holstein; and of these the transit dues overland across the Cimbric Penisula form a part, and have been redeemed with them. When Germany was agitating for the repeal of the Sound Dues Denmark always represented the impolicy of that course, as tending to diminish a source of revenue of which the German Duchies were entitled to a share; and this retention of the common property of the entire monarchy, as though it belonged to the kingdom of Denmark alone, occurs at a moment when that State is embroile1 vith Germany for having sold, for Danish purposes, domains m HoL-tein and Lauenburg, the possessioa of which is guaranteed to those Duchies by repeated treaties entered into between Denmark and Germany. The language Denmark holds oa this occasion to the duchies is "What you have is mine, and what I have is my own." TURKEY. (FROM AN OCCAMSONAL COnREsrPONDNTr.) CONSTANTINOPLE, Apnm 24. Yesterday w£s the day fixed for the Nildah, or faoniailles, of the Sultan's three daughters, who had been promised in marriage some time ago to Mahmoud Pasha, son of Fethi Ahmed Pasha,. Grand Master of the Artillery; Ethem Pasha, soa of Mehemet Ali Pasha, Capitan Pasha; and El Hami Pasha, son of the late Abbas Pasha,Viceroy of Egypt. It had been arranged that the ceremony should take place at the same time for the three at the Palace of Top-Kapou or Seraglio Point, which, although abandoned by the Sultans as a residenc2 since the overthrow of the Janissaries, is still the traditional place where many grand ceremonies are performed. To this palace therefore the Sultanas were to proceed in state from Dolma Bakch6, and to witness the procession all thc harems of Constantinople had poured forth their inmates from an early hour; every window, every shop, every little nook whence it was possible to catch a view of the procession in the long distance from Dolma-Bakche to Top-Kapou was covered with Turkish women; they were squatting all around and all one upon another, decked out in their gayest ferejees, of all the colours of the rainbow, topped with their white head-dresses, which contraste^d with the black faces of their attendants. Wherever the street widened it was lined with carriages, in which were reclining the slaves and favourites of the wealthy, and in many of these was to be noticed a lovely face reluctantly concealed behind the curtains, which would now and then be gently drawn aside by delicate white fingers covered with gems, to allow of the admiration of the European passers-by. The Sultanas left Dolma Bakchg at I1 a.m. At the head of the corMtge was the KislarAga, or chief of the black eunuchs. He rode a superb charger magnificently caparisoned; he is frightfully ugly, but his dress was so brilliant, the gold was thrown over it insuch profase masses, that it stayed the eye and prevented his ugliness being noticed. Then came the three Sultanas, each in a state carriage glittering with silver and gold, and draswn by horses whose trappings were also studded with silver and gold ornaments. There were eunuchs riding on all sides, and all in fine clothes and on splendid horses. Each Sultana was attended by her mother and by one slave. As they drove rapidly past a blaze of diamonds flashed across the eyes. Then came tho other slaves and female attendants in about 3) cauriages, vieing with their mistresses in the spletdoar of their dresses and iewels, and many far surpassing them in their charms. Although the Sultanas went to the Seraglso in person, neither they nor their future bridegrooms appear at the ceremony of betrothal. This is performed by procuration. The - islarAa represents the Sultan and_the Sultanas on this occsion, and the Grand Vizier,RedschidPasha, represented the bridegrooms. The witnesses were Reza Pasha, the Seraskier, Chefik Pasha, of the fint, and Aof Ghelio Pasha, son-in-law of the Sultan. iLike every Turkish father, the Sultan stipulates the sum his son-in-law is to pay for his daughter, and this sum becomes her dowvry. This was fixed at 5,000 Turkish pounds in this instance. The marriage contract is read before the witnesses, prayers are pronounced, and the first chapter of the Koran read, and this part of the ceremony is over. The Sultanas return to their residence, and are followe1 there by the presents offered by their ]iancs. The presents are by no means the least important part of the ceremony, and are taken to the Imperial Palace in great state. First, three beautiful Arab chargers, magnificently caparisoned, were le I past. The saddlecloths were of the handsomest embroidery in precious stones I ever saw, even in this land of embroideries. These were a present to the Sultan himself from his future sons-in-law. Then came the presents to the Sultanas themselves, -first, sweetmeats of all sorts contained in covered china vessels; five of these vessels are put on a tray, and a cage of hoops and gauze of various colours, trimmed gaily with ribands and flowers, covers the tray, which is borne on a man's head. A hundred suchi trays of sweetmeats were borne past from each bridegroom. Then came other trays, larger, ten in numaber, on which were placed shawls and articles of dress; ten pieces of the rilchest brocade of silver' and goi were among the dresses offered by El Ha mi P aqha, and various rich cashmere shawls. Thea came two carriages, in each of which w as an , enormous coffer covered with velvet and ornamented with silver plates, full of costly per- fumeries. Then came the more precious articles on teatrays, covered with a silver cage, surmounted in those sent by El Harai Pasha, by a golden eagle, with spread wings. As the presents offered by El ELa'mi Pasba were by far the most costly and tastefal, Iwill contentm yself with describingthese. First, the 5,000 pounds dowry was carried past in five red satin bags on five trays. Then the headdress forthebride on her wedding day-a gold and silver knot for supporting the hair at the back of the head and a band of velvet embroidered in briiants and pearls with a verse of the Koran for the front. Thenthe veil of silk which is thrown over the bride, embroidered in pearls and briliants. and with no less than 700 carats of brilliants on it,-then the slippers, also one ma s of pearls and diamonds, and the pattens used in the bath, covered with gold and precious stone s,-then the round toilet glaas, of which the back was a plate of gold beautiifuly worked, and also studded with precious stones. Precious s'tones were scattered in profusion in all these articles of every-day use, so to speak, btt now came the jewels themselves - a splendid diamond tiara, very high, and lnng enough to go round to the back of the head, with a large bunch of flowers in diamonds dropping over the irght ear ; this had bee n set in Pawis, and s beautiful in design, as well as costly. A pair f daod earrngs,withswitdiamond drpof g freattsizeeand perfectly oval shape. These gems, without anequal in [ h olXhdbeen - the property of El Hami Psaks's ' lastlgy, a ring, with one very large diamond, also of perfect shape and colour. Numerous other articles of less importance, though of great beauty, were offered by El Hami Pasha, who spared neither money nor trouble to find presents for his bride suited to his immense wealth. It is calculated that in jewels alone he has spent over 120,0001. sterling. The same articles pretty nearly were offered to the other Sultanas by MIahmoud Pasha and by Ethem Pasha ; but, of course, they did not attempt to rlval the riches of their fature brother-in-law, El Hami Pasha. It took the same number of men to carry their presents-120 men, besides two carriages. It was a pretty sight to see all these riches go by between the crowds of curious of the fairer sex especiaUy, and to watch the various sensations oa their countenauces as the sun shone on all these treasures. What will be theeffect on thelittle Sultanas to whom aU this finery is desined ? The eldest is scarcely 15-a mere child in our ideas. Although ths three have been betrothed, only one wiU be married this year-that one which is destined to Ethem Pasha, son of Mehemet Ali Pasha, who must not be confused with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose name is also Ethem Pasha. After the presents had been received at the Palace the fature bridegrooms were admitted to see His Majesty, and the Sultanassentpresentato theirhou.es; asnuffbox in gold and brilliants, a handkerchief embroidered in brilliants, the whole enveloped in a magnificent boktcha, or wrapper, also richly embroidered. The Ramazan, or month of fasting, commences on Saturday next, and the Turks have already for some weeks past been preparing themselves by doing nothing for the idleness to which they more completely give themselves up during that month. SWITZERLAND. The following letter has been addressed by Colonel Denzler, Member of the Grand Council of Switzerland, to the Council of State of the Canton of NeuchateL It is looked upon as a manifestation of great importance, as emanating from a person highly respected, and holding a high rank in the Federal army. Colonel Denzler is a citizen of Zurich, but, having married a rich heiress of the Canton of Neuclmtel, he procured the right of citizenship of that canto; where he is settled. It was ColonelDenzlerwho commanded the Republican troops against the Royalist insurrection, and he enjoys the confidence of the army:- ,M Monsieur President and Gentlemen,-I learnt yesterday, from theRund,the semi-official organ of theFederalCounci that the latter had resolved, on Saturday last, to submit to you the proposal of an arrangement of the Paris Conference concerning the NeuchUtel question, a proposal against which there is much to be said. " I understand, knowing the tempenment of the Federal Council, that it is anxious to throw the responsibility of accepting or reiecting that proposal upon a third party, and has selected you as its cat's-paw to take the chestnuts out of the fire. * I learn to-day, from the same joural, that the Government of the canton of NeuchAtel will declare itself satisfied, and it is asserted that a deputation of the said Government will arrive at Berne to-day, boaring that doclaration. "1 Gentlemen, as leader of the Republican troops who, on the 4th of September, 1856, re-established constittitonal order in the Canton of Neuchitel, and as a member of the Grand Council, I take the liberty of alddressing a few words upon your course of action, premisig that what the Bund has advanced is true. "1 L I do not understand that you can consent that the Ring of Prussia shall maintain in future the title of ' Prince of Neuch&tel and Valengin.' " 2. 1 do not understand that you can consent that he sball have an indemnity of 1,000,000f., that he may therewith reward the men who caused the disturbance of peace among us. " 3. I do not understand that you can take a decision on this subject, on your own responsibility, without consulting the g3rand CounciL " I do not think that the Swiss people in general, and the NeuchAtel people in particular, mean that the authorities should aceept aUl those conditions and submnit to them, and that they are content to continue to follow that policy of petty traders, which has already caused us so many huml7ia. tions. "I hope the Ncuchfitel people and its Grand Council will oppose the propositions which it is wished to impose upon us. I also hope that the Federal Assembly will not accept them. It is better to remain in the status quo. We shall find means enough in the Canton of Neuchatelto keep the Royalists in check. "I declare to you at once that during the next session of the Grand Council I shall bring forward a motion on the subject. " Accept, Monsieur President and gentlemen, the assur auce of my high consideration. ". DENZLER, Colonel, Member of the Grand Council. "Fleurier, April 28." SPAIN. (FROM OUR OWN CoREsPOINDMT.) MADRID, MAY 1. Nothing could be tamer or less animated than the opening of the Cortes, which took place to-day. In both Chambers the Duke of Valencia, who looks wan and harass-d, read the Queen's Speech in a voice so low that in the galleries it was scarcely possible to gather even its substance. In the UIpper House, when he concluded, an aged senator cried, " Viva la Reina!" His colleagues feebly responded, " Vita P but the galleries, which in Spain are wont to be noisy on such occasions and loudly to echo the cheers of the senators, were mute. The same thing occurred in the Congress. The Speech read, it appeared for two or three seconds as if it were to be received in silence. Happily a deputy, whose name I know not (the Chamoer is full of new faces), threw himself with Curtian daring into the breach, wayed his primrose glove, and shouted, "Live the Queen !" But, oh, how faint the response! How different from the hearty burst that hailed the Jinale of the Royal Speech at the opening of the Constituent Assembly ! Half the deputies were mute, and in the galleries one voice, and one only, took up the cry, making the silence of the remainder more striking. There were few strangers present, and no one of note was in the diplomatic tribuna. The principal points of the Queen's Speech were sent to you some days ago. A literal translation is subjoined:- " Seilores Seaadores y Diputados;-Never has my satisfaction been greater at seeing myself in the midst of you after the disturbances that have agitated the kingdom; but I trust in Divine Providence that even greater shall my satisfaction be when, by your co-operation and efforts, we .see erased from all hearts the memory of those sad events, in the same manner that it is effaced from mine. Then only shall we succeed in uniting all Spaniards in one common object, and in restoring our native land to the high place that belongs to it, and from which division and discord among its own sons alone can make it descend. " With the greatest consolation of my heart I announce to you the renewal of relations with the Holy See. Smoothed away by my Government the difficulties that opposed so desirable an event, I have sent to Rome an Ambassador who in my name may tighten the sacred bonds that unite the Spanish Monarchy with the common father of the faithful. " I have also the greatest satisfaction in announcing to you that relations with our ancient ally the Emperor of all the Russias have been re-established. "- Diplomatic relations with the Mexican Republic have been interrupted in consequence of deplorable events. I hope that this interruption wi not be of long duration; the Mexican nation and Government will not desire to identify themselves (and of this they have begun to give proofs) with acts as contrary to justice as to humanity by leaving them unpunished, nor will they oblige Spain, with whom so many ties unite them, to exact the reparation of those injuries. "'With aU other nations good understanding and friendship subsist. " The internal state of the monarchy is as far as may be satisfactory. The scarcity of means of subsistence and the exorbitant prices of articles of the first nocessity have constantly occupied my Government, and the criisi, almost vanquished, does not now inspire apprehension of the grave complications and risks which it threatened at the commencement. " Public tranquillity and internal security ve completely guaranteed, and in their shadow has been effected, with all liberty and without disturbances, the munica elections, and those of the deputies to the Cortes. I have also been able to give way without fear to the maternal impulses of my heart, granting a political amnesty so general and complete that there was not a single Spaniard excluded from its benefits, and to whom the gates of his native land were not opened. " MIy Governm ent will give you a circumstantial account of the means adopted for the re-establshment of the laws that ruled in 1854, and the observance of which was interruptedby the events of that year, L1gality, respect to con- atitutional1 powers, as wel as publi conv i onsly require that re-esablihient e ce, " The colonies, as well in America as in Asia, prosper and increase in wealth and 'well-being under the shadow of a protecting and tutedary Adminlstration, and their inhait ants reap the fruit due to the fidelity which has preserveda them fron the accumulation of evil; in which others find themselves involved. "The army and the navy, which by their acknow. ledged valour and discipline have zendered at all times so many services to the Throne and to the State, have aways merited my special benevolence and attention, and my Go. vernment is vigilant to maintain the public force in the situation demanded by its merits and by the high ends to which it is destined. " The Concordat celebrated with the Holy See has been re-established in all its force and vigour, as was demanded by my Royal word and religious feelings; and, moreover other dispositions hate been prescribed to restore to the church that liberty with which its Divine Founder endowed it, and which has been so well respected at all times by the religious Spanish people and by my glorious pro genitors. "The imperious neeesityofadaptingthc publicservices to the requirements of tho new situstion has obliged my Government to order and put in execution the estimates that will be presented to you, and to contract a loan which, relieving the Treasury, should lower the exoessive interest of money, and permit capital to be employed in the promotion of the iational activity. Of all this my Government will render you an account for the suitable ceorresponding) resolution. " Public works have beerl promoted with the utmost activity, as was required by their recognized importanoe, and by the necemsity of finding work for the needy classes during the great deAess of food. "Such, wiiores &nadores y Dipuados, is the genera sate of the monarchy, and I trust in God that from day to day it will go on improving and increasing with scrupulous respect to the laws, with that stability which is more neces. eary than ever afier so manny years of disturbances, and with the guarantee of the constitationsl institutions which thus confim and strengtben the prerogatives of the Throne and tie rights of public lirty. "-With thisobject my Government wi propose to you au important measure-the reform of the Senate, restricting ihe conditions of admission, combining the dignity of Senator with the highest charges of Church and State, in. troducing heirdom as a new element of stability and force, and as a means of maintsning and preserving in aperma. nent manner the glorious names of those who, in present and past times, have served and illustrated their country. " Besides the estimates of the present ye, those of the next will be presented to you. In these my Government proposes to submit to your approbation. the necesary reforms and variations to establish a balance between receipts and expenditure, with permanent resources; and I reckon on your co-operation and efforts to obtain a result without which neither tho finances nor credit can ever reach their due develspment. " Tho press, govemed some time past by temporary regulations, requires a fixed and stable law, which, permitting the most ample discussion of public afairs, may free it from the abuses and excesses which have so frequently compromised it. This law will very shortly be submitted to your approbation. "There will also be proposed to you important dispo. sitions to give to public instruction the legal stability it demands, to remove the obstacles that oppose the rapid execution of public works, and to connect with the great lines of communication of all classes the provincial and municipal roads, so necessry to the development of agricul. ture and conimerce. " A law with respect to mortgages will not less contribute to this result; it will remove all uncertinty concerning the condition and charges of immovable property, facilitate transactions relating to them, diminish in consequence the interest of the sums lent, and mobilize in a certain degree this great mass of property, which at present, with great prejudice to agriculture and industry, is almost locked up. " These are, Sefhores Senadores y Diputados, the principal measures that will be submitted to you by my Government during the session, and I hope that you will devote yourselves ardently to their examination and approbation. "Thus, working aU coniointly for the common good, casting to oblivion old motives of division and discord, and reckoning, as ever, on the aid of Divine Providence, I have the utmost confidence that we shall very soon see our country prosperous and happy, which is, I doubt not, your hobeard sole object, as it is the moat ardent desire of my The Three per Cents, were done at 40 05; the Deferred, 26 55.
DAVTD HUAfE AND THE NAPIERS. TO THE EDITOR OF TBE TIMES. Sir,-I see it stted in an extract from either the 3d or 4th volume of the Life of GeneraZ Sir Ch4arlu Napier, " that Lord Lynedoch and my father (Napier's father) were schoolboys together, under the same tutor, Hume the Historian." I confess that this statement has not a little surprised me. There is no trace of Hume's ever being engaged as a tutor, unless he should be considered as such during his residence with the Marquis of Annandale. Lord Lynedoch was born in 1750, and could hardly require the services of a tutor til he was at le>st 10 or 12 years of age. Bt in1760 Hume vas nearly 50 years of ago, and had attained to a very high degree of reputation, and also to considerable wealth; and, such being the case, it seems very unlikely that he would have undertaken to act as tutor to mere boys. No trace of his having done so is to be found either in his letters or those of his friends. Perhaps, how. ever, Sir William Napier will be good enough to clear up this mystery, by informing us when, and under what cir. cumstances, Hume the Historian became tutor to his father and Lord Lynedoch.

THE TwouBs wrE NEw GANAD.A.-Ei circumstances like those surrounding our relations with New Granada it is always safe to predict other than a violent result. They may afford a basis for loud-toned negotiation, truculent menace, or fierce demonstration; but they are clearly insufficient of themselves to support an appeal to the last resort of nations. The uUimatum of Mi. Morse hls been rejected. It has even been met with a counter claim for indemnity. The special envoy has sought his home in disgust- the Envoy Extraordinary is understood to follow bard behind. We have thus the elements of a very pretty quarrel, an orthodox casus bels, as clear as the worst of those disputes iu regard to which the great European Powers are apt to fall together by the ears And yet there are so many dissuasives from a conflict upon any quarrel less than one involving national existenee or independence that we shall be excused from believing in the war until we hear the first cannonade. Aside from the railroad and Its collaferal shipping interests, we have so manv relations with New Granada, strengthening and closing jearly, that a declaration of war must inflict equal injury upn beth The $400,000 demanded by Mr. Morse, the refu of which is the real provocation, is less than 20 per cent, of the actual profit which our commercial traffic realizesyea2ly from uninterrupted intercourse with the ports of that State. Dismissng, therefore, the vapourish and indefinite eonsidera. tions of national honour and vanity which befog the question, we have only to weigh the loss of a warlike adventure against the profit of peaceful trade to apPreCiate the impolicy of a reckless recourse to that appel,so hose to elevated civilization and so irreconcileabl hothe to gressive spirit of the age. Economically and commerciaiAv speakLing, we are less able to afford such a measure than New Grnada herself. We should lose more, we might gan less. If, in closing the war with a treaty, we inVst upon more than the indemnity pressed by our agents as an Winwum, with the expenses of the contest, perhaps, added, we shaU depart from tho wellestablished principles of our Government. Even that will not pay for suspended intercourse, impaired credit, and the injury inflioted upon the alled E apublie, whose prosperity is so vital an eement in the welare of the United States. If we insist upon less it will be an admission that the war was trivial and gratuitous, or that we have had the worst of it-a dilemma either horm of which mnust gore us lamentably. There is no way of presentingthe subiect, indeed, which does not threaten us with senous mischief, immediate or eventuaL Truxe the actual odds and probabilities of warfare are largely m favour of the United States. To blockade the three ports of Santa Martha, Carthagens, and Savanilla, upon the Carribean Sea, would be the work of a month. Panama, with ita hive of cut-throats and entpurses, might he " shaled" to ruins inless tine. The tranEit route might be taken possession of, and the income derived by the Bogotan Government from the railroad transferred to the interest account of our claim. Deprived of revenue from Cuvstoms, upon wrhich the Government depends exclusively, there are nzo internal resources to draw upon in their place to prosecute the war. Every strategical point would be tothe advantage of their foe. For the p ion of the isthmnus there could not be the semnblanceofacontest. Without a marine, and with American ships guarding either estremity of the transit, it must be next to impossible to transport troops thither by water in number. adequate to the exigencies of defence. By land the access, owing tothe natural traits of the isthmus, ispracticallyout of thequestion. And if it were not, and if we might preconceive a pitched battle there between American and native armies, what other event than triumph have we reason to anticipate? The Spaniard. though of pure Castilian blood, was pro. nounce by Wellington worse than worthless as a soldier when intermixed, as in Spanish America, with effete Indian tribes and negroes, some still less respectful term of disparagement i5 deserved; he is what the Mexicans proved in heir resistance to Taylor and Scott, or the Central Aneri. cans in their impotent opposition to Walker, that pestilent intruder, whom disease and want, not human antagonism, seem destined to subdue. There can be no doubt, in ahort, about the result of a conflict between North and South Americans in a strictly military sense, and as little in a commercial point of view. Regarding the latter as of greatly supernor moment, we trust that, setting all private solicitations and ur-gence aside, the President will exhaulst all the means of amicable adjustment, arbitration, and mediation, or whatever else, before he recgnmmsads extreme measures,-1fiC Yes-k .Zim¢5.

BARNES V. JAY. This casecamse beforeothe CouLrt on futhtTer directions. The suit was instituted for the administration of the estata of the late G. 0. Taylor. In the year 1,841, on the occasion of the separation of Air, and .mx. Garthon, Mr. Taylor en. tered into) the usual covenant with Mr. Garthon to, indemn. nify hima against the debts of his -wife. A question was now raised as to the right of Mfr. Garthon to have a sum of SOoa, which was the full amount of Mr. Taylorr 'ssets, retained in court in order to indepmniy Mir. Garthon against his liability to p his wife's debtL. It appeared that Mr. Garthon had given notice of the covenant to Air. Taylores executos, but that hIr. Garthon had not proved the deedoE separatio in which such covenant was contained before the Master; and the plaintffs, who were entitled to the above sun of 80W1. resisted the claim of Mr. Garthon that the same shoula be retained in court as before mentioned, hut offered to enter into a covenant with him to indeinify him against his wife's debts. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Busk appeared for the plaintiffs, 1ir Malins and Mr. Hingeston for AIr. Garthon, Air. G. L. Rutsell for Mr. Jay, Yr. Taylor's personal representative, and Mr. Cole and Ar. Borrett for other parties. The VIcE-CnC&cxLLOU directed the cause to stand over until the first cause day in Trinity Term, with liberty to Mr. Gartbon to make suchapplication as he might be advised as to proving Tylor's covenant. In the meantime Mr. Garthon would also have the opportunity of consideripg whether he would not be satisfied with the plaintif' covenant. (Before ecCh-canelor Sir W. P. Wool,) YXM V. EDWARDS. Thevsc -CHIcELLoR g&ve judgment in this case, which has been recently argued before him. The bill was filed by the sons of John Yenm, deceased, to restrain the defendants, the devisees under their mother's will, from proceeding in ejectment against them in respnct of certain small portions of land in the Forest of Dean. which had been formerly encroachments upn the title of the Crown, and had been allotted by the Forest Commissioners to the widow of John Yem. It appeared that John Yem for more than 20 years before his death in 1824 had been in possession of 2a. 3sr. 31p. of land in the Forest of Dean by encroachment (20 perches having been in his pos. session for only seven years before his death). By his will, made in 1824, John Yem divided his real estte to his wife, Benedicta Yem, and after her death ordered the same to be equaly divided between his sons, the plaintifs, or such of them as should bo living at her death. At this period the Forest of Dean was subject to an Act of the 20th of Charles 1L, which enacted that any gift, grant, estate, or interest, &c.,obtainedin the enclosure of the forest should, ipto fato, be null and void. 'Notwithstanding this Act encroachments had been made upon the forest from time to time by various persons, the land possessed by John Yem having been thus obtained. In 1832 a commission ws appointed And a survey made of the forest. In 1834 the commissioners made their report, in which they divided the encroachments into three classes:-First, encroachments before 177, coloured red in the survey, as to which they recommended that a freehold of inheritance should be declared to be in the possessors, subject to a condition as to no additional houses being built thereon' second, encroachments between 1787 and 1812, coloe blue, as to which it was recommended that C*sea for three lives shonld be granted to the possessors, at a nominal rent; third, encroachments after 1812, coloured yellow, as to which it was recommended that terms from 14 to 21 years should be granted to the possessors, at smral (but not merely nominal) rents. An Act-the st and 2d of Victoria, cap. 42-was passed in 1838, to carry into effect the recommendations of the report, enacting that the encroach. nents coloured red should be held by thepossessors, as if the Act of 20 Car. TL had never passed, and freed from the Crown's title; that the Woods and Forests Commissionerv should he empowered to grant leases to the possessors of the encroachments coloured blue for three lives, renewabio from time to time, and also to grant leases of the encroachments coloured yellow for 14 or 21 years, with power for the possessors of " bluo" and "y ellow" to purcbase the fee simple at 25 yeas purchase on the rent reserved within 10 years from the passmng of the Act. It was also enacted by' sect. 12 that in case of any dispute between persons as to theirright to have a lease and conveyance of the encroachments granted to them pursuant to the Act the matter should bereferred to the verderers of the forest, wbose decision should be finaL The landin the possession of John Yem, and taken under his will by Benedicta Yem, was described in the schedule to the report as "red" and. -blue." After the passing of the Act 1st and 2d of Victoria, cap. 42, Mrs. Ye-, having previously obtained a lease thereof, applied to purchase the portions coloured blue, and obtained a conveyance in fee at a small consideration from the Commissioners of Woods and Forests. Mrs. Yem hed the property until her death in 185& She had made a w i by which she devid au'l her real estate to the defeddants, Edwards and Cooper, upon trusts, for sale. The defendants had commenced actions of ejectmeut against the plaintiffs to recover possession of the property, and in restraint of these actions the present bill had been filed. On behalf of the plaintiffs it was contended that the pessessory title in John Yem had been merely confirmed by the Act ist and 2dof Victoria, cap. 42, and the ourchase by Benedicta Yem under its provisions; that she Sad not purchased for her own benefit alone, but for the benefit of all those entitled in remainder, and that the lands in question were subject to tho esual incidents of property; that she had no power of converting her life estate under her husband's will into a fee; and that her will was therefore inoperative. 3r. Jessel appeared for the plaintiffs; Mr. Bolt and Mr. Southgate were for the defendants. The VsCE-CHASCELxuOR, after stating the case, said that the question was how far the plaintiffs were entitled, a title havimngbeen established in their father, vhich he had not at the time of making his will-how far they were entitled to say that the tenant for life, having acquired an interest, must be taken to have acquired it for the benefit of the estate according to the ordinary rule. As to the "red," clearly no question was oontemplated, the Legislature having dealt with it as if the feessmmple had always been in the possefsors,and the statute of Charles If. had never been passed. As to the lands coloured " blue," the Legislature had nso intention of dealing with any equities existing betweel the parties. It was intended that, as to these later encroachments, the persons in posession should not be treaked as actual owners, but that the right of the Crows should be recognized by the payment of a small noninal rent, To assume that the Legislature, in thus ratifying the poss"ssorvtitle, contemplated that themnere possession should. deteiminin the rights of all parties would create extreme diffibulty. Take thecase of a mortgage -where a mortgagor was in possesnion anterior to the report and the statute which made oit hisproperty; wash tonholdit free and dischargedcofthe mortgago debt? Onstheeother hand, wasthe cortgagee, if in possession, to hola the property free fromx the equity of redemtion?a fo with a guardian, as well might it be said that e was entitled to retain the property for his own benefit, discharged from all right in the infant. iNo such case could have ben contemplated. As to sectioni 12 (the clause as to disputes), it sw med to refer to the case of adverse claimants to an enroachment ta betweehx themaselves. The tenant for life, and not the tenant in. frlainder, would be the proper person to have the grant arade to him. Loeokin at a passage in theoreport of the conitasioners, their vievawws clearly indicated that the title in fee being obtained by the person in possession, his title would be assumied to be lawfl, and that it was witla the legal title alone that they promed to deal. This could notc aply as between trustee in p anpt i e truso or tenant forlurfe andthos in remainder, and he must hold that onf payment of certain smalle sums nwhich were payable by Benedicta Yem the plaintifs weresentitled to relief.

COIThT OF QVXEN'S BENCE, WEnuqS2 MAv g AL%ASEILL V. TIIE QUEEN (TN ERR)PflI (;SNi&9 tn BanCO, before Lord CAMPBELL and Justices WIGHTMN, ERLE, and CROMPTOx.) The plaintiff in error, Thomas Mansell, had been tried before Mr. Baron BramweU at the last winter assizes held at Maidston )for the wilful murder of ilexander M'Burney, and, on con iction, judgment of death was passed upon him. A writ of error being brought, the prisoner in the early part of this term was brought into this court by Itabeas c'rpus, to assign errors upon the record, and this being done the prisoner was again brought up on Saturday last, when the alleged errors were argued. 'Mr. F. RUSSBLL (with whom was the Hon. Mr. George Denman) was heard for the plaintiff in error, and Mr. WELSBY (with whom was Mr. Ribton) for the Crown. The record set out the commission of the judges, the fmd. ing of a true bill for murder, the prisoner's plea of " Not Gulty," the award of a jury of " good and lawful men of the country" to try the prisoner, and the panel of jurymen xeturned by the sheriffs for the purpose aforesaid, whose names were set out. It then stated that certain names were called in the order in which they appeared in the panel, and when they came were peremptorily chaUenged by the prisoner; and that three others were called in order, and were " elected to be sworn." The next called was WiUiam Ironmonger, and when he came Mr. Ribton, the counsel for the prosecution, prayed that he (Ironmonger) might be ordered to " stand by." Mr. Russell, the counsel for the prisoner, prayed that, if the counsel for the prosecution chaUenged the jurynan, he should challenge him forthwith and show the cause of chaUenge forthwith, and that, by the laws of the realm, he (Ironmonger) ought not to be ordered to "stand by." The Court, however, ordered and adjudged that Ironmonger should " stand by." The next who was caUed came, and was I Ielected to be sworn." Several other jurymen were in like manner ordered to " stand by," and others were *' elected to be sworn," making the number of jurymen thus elected to be aworn amount to nine. The record then stated that, forasmuch as the remainder of the persons eiepannelled as a jury were sworn and charged by the Court to give their verdict upon another indictment against one George Chap3nan, and while aU the other persons were being called had been and still were committed to the custody of the sheriff by the Court, to be kept tiUl they had given their verdict, therefore the said remainder were not called. Thereupon the said WiUiam Ironmonger was again called, Tnd again appeared. Mr. Ribton, the counsel for the prosecunion, again prayed that he might be ordered to "stand by," rnd MIr. Russell, the counsel for the prisoner, again prayed that if the counsel for the Crown challenged the juryman the cause of challenge should be shown forthwith. Thereupon the 12 jurymen before referred to came into court and gave their verdict, and were forthwith discharged from the custody of the sheriff. The counsel for the Crown bereupon prayed that W. Ironmonger might be ordered to "stand by" until the said 12 jurymen should be called to 3serve on the jury. The counsel for the prisoner objected, Tnd prayed that in default of the counsel for the Crown chaUlenging WiiUiam Ironmonger, and assigning cause of rhaUenge, he (Ironmonger) forthwith be elected to be sworn to serve on the jury. The Court thereupon ordered WVilliam Ironmonger to "stand by," and three other jurymon from the discharged jury were "elected to be sworn,"thusmaking upthenumber 12. One of the 12 elected jurymen, named Jabez Philpott, without being sworn, hereupon said he had " conscientious scruples against capital punishments." The counsel for the proseoution p,rayed that bc might be ordered to "stand by;" but the c ounsel for the prisoner objeoted that, if the juryman was challenged, cause of challenge ought to be shown forth. with. Thereupon the learned judge said, " Undoubtedly, If you feel you cannot do your duty, you are quite right in saying so, and had better withdraw ;" and the juryman was ordered to " stand by," notwithstanding the objection of the prisoner's counsel, that, if challenged, cause of chal. lenge ought to be shown forthwith, and in default thereof that the said Jabez Philpott ought to be sworn. Six other jurymen were then caUed, and ordered to "stand by ;" another was peremptorily challenged by the prisoner, and then another was elected. These made up the numbcr of 12, who were sworn, notwith. anding the prisoner's protest, The record then went on state that the jury so sworn found the prisoner " Guilty," and judgment of death was passed upon him. The assignment of errors stated that there was error in the record-1. Because it did not show any sufficient ground why the jurors told to " stand by" were not sworn. 2. Because it appeared that the said jurymen were ordered to " stand by," whereas the Court had no power to make such an order, which was unknown to the law, vague, and uncertain, and, at any rate, ought not to have been made till they had been chaUenged, though the Crown might not be bound to show the cause of challenge forthwith. 3. Because after all the names of the jurymen in the panel had been caUed, omitting the 12 who ,were locked up, only nine were elected, and the panel vas begun again by caUing the name of Ironmonger a second time. He was again ordered to "stand by," though Le ought to have been sworn. 4. Because the jurymen ought not to have been caUed out of their regular order at the nomination of the counsel for the Crown. 5. Because after Jabez Philpott had been elected to be sworn, and stated lo had " conscientious scruples against capital punishments," he could not be chaUenged or ordered to " stand by," and the entertaining such scruples was no cause of cballenge, and the judge had no jurisdiction to tell him to -withdraw, or to order him to " stand by," until it was found by triers that he was not indifferent between the Queen and the prisoner. G. Because it did not appear tiat the jurors elected were sworn in due course of law. 7. Because the matters in the record were no', sufficient to warrant the judgment; and 8. Becauso judgment was given for the Queen, whereas it ought to have been given for the prisoner. It therefore prayed that judgment might be reversed. Upon this there was a joinder in error by Mr. Robinson, the coroner and attorney for the Queen in this court. After the argument on the above assignment of errors the Court said they would take time to consider, and give judgment this day; and they ordered that the prisoner should in the meantime be kept in the gaol at Newgate, and brought up this day at the sitting of the Court. Ac. cordingly, at 10 o'clock this morning the prisoner was brought into court in the charge of a keeper, to whom he was handcuffed. Lord CAMPBELL then delivered the judgment of the Court, as follows :-Having anxiously considered this case, and examined all the authorities cited during the argument at the bar, we have all come to the conclusion that none of the errors assigned can be supported,-the prisoner having been convicted and sentenced to death, after a fair trial according to the laws of England. Oar judgment chiefly depends upon the right construction of the ancient statute 33d of Edward L, entitled "An ordinance for Inquests," which was re-enacted by the 6th of George IV., cap. 50. An abuse had arisen in the administration of justice by the Crown assuuing an unlimlited right of challenging jurors without assigning cause, whereby t" inquests remained untakeR." In this way the Crown could, in an arbitrary manner, on every criminal trial chaUenge so many of the jurors returned on the panel by the sheriff that 12 did not remain to make a jury, and the trial might be indefinitely postponed pro defectu juratorur,2, to the great oppression of the subject, and in contravention of the words of Magna Charta, " Nuli deferenusjustitian ve'.rectdun." The remedy was to give to the party accused a right to be tried by the jurors summoned upon h 5 arraignment if, after the limited number of challenges to which he was entitled without cause assigned, there remained 12 jurors of those returned upon the panel to whose qu"lification and unindifferency no specific objection, to be proved by legal evidence, could be made. To prevent the tri4 going off for want of jurors by the peremptory challenge of the Crown it is enacted that " they who sue for the Crown shaU assign of their challenge a cause certain, and the truth of the same chaDenge shal be inquired of according to the custom of the court." But there was no intention of taking away all power of peremptory challenge from the Crown while that power, to the number of 35, was left to the prisoner. Indeed, unless this power were given, under certain re3trie. tions, to both sides it is quite obvious that justice could not be satisfactorily adminisered; for it must often happen tbAt a juror is returned on the panel who does not stand indifferent and who is not fit to serve on the trial, although no legal evidence could be adduced to prove his unfitness. The object of the statute is fully attained if the Crown be prevented from exercising its power of peremptory challenge sO as to msake the trial go off while there are 12 of those returred upon the panel who cannot be proved to be liable to a valid objection. Accordingly the course has invariably been, from the passing of the statute to the present time, to permit the Crown to challenge without cause tiU the panel has been called over and exhausted, and then to caU over the names of the jurors peremptorily chaUenged. by the Crown, and to put the Crown to assign cause, so that if there are 12 of those upon the panel as to whom no jut cause of objection can be assigned the trial may proceed. ln our books of authority the rule is laid down that " the King need not show any cause of his chaUenge till the whole panel be gone through and it appears that there wil not be a fuU jury without the pcrson so eballenged." This rule (with a view probably of conveying to the bystanders the notion that it operates harshly against the prisoner) has often been questioned, but it has as often been recognized and established by the presiding judges. The last instance of this was on the trial of John. rust for high treason in the year 1840, when Lord Chief Justice Tindal, the presiding judge, without calling uponthecounselfor the Crown for an answer, observed, *We are called upon after a construction has been put upon the Act of Parliament from the very period when it was passed in the 33d of Edward I. down to the present time, to put a different construction upon it. Where would be the certainty of the law of England, and what certainty would there be for prisoners as well as for the public, if judges acting accordig to their own discretion, neglecting those rules of interpretation which wise men before them have laid down, and which have been sanctioned by invariable usage, were to do that for the first time which we are now called upnon to do-namely, to put a construction different from that which has been put by all who have gone before us? It appears, however, to me that upon the language of the Act itself it is by no means an unfair or imrproper conclusion to say that the Crown is not to be caDed upon to challenge for cause until the panel has been gone through." Porke B. and Wiliams J., the aesociated judges, clearly concurred in this opinion. We may further observe that as the statute of Edward L was re-enacted in ipsisimi8sverbi, after the c\*nstruction had EO long been put upon it, this construction must be considered to have the sanction of the Legislature; and indeed there is no reason to suppose that it bas ever worked injustice. Therefore the first ground of error assigned, that there were jurors ordered to stand by on the application of the counsel for the prosecution without any cause being assigned,entirelyfails; and no objection can be taken to the regularity of the proceedings till the panel bad been once gonethroughwithout a jury beingformed. What was the state of things according to the record, and what was then done? Twelve of the jurors returned upon the panel were at that time shut up deliberating upon their verdict in the case of George Chapman, and their names had not been called. Thereupon the name of Wm. Ironmonger, who had been before challenged by the Crown without cause being assigned, was agi called, and, bein again chaDlenged by the Crown, thu prisoner's counsel prayed that the Crown might now be put to assign cause, and that otherwise Wm. Ironmon er should not bo ordered to istand by. At this moment, befose any judgment was given by the court, the 12 jurors who sat as the jury upon Chapman came into Court, and gave their verdict, and were discharged, They being now in court, and the formation of the Jury in ansell's case beisngu progress, the counsel for the Crown prayed that Wilham Ironmonger should be ordered to stand by until the 12 who bad served in Chap. man's case should be called to serve on the jury between thie Queen and Thomas Mansell. This was objeoted to by the counsel for the prisoner, wbo prayed that Wi. Ironmonger should be sworn upon the jury unless cause of challenge were forthwith assigned by the Crown. The Court adjudged that Wm. Ironmonger should stand by, and further that the names of the jurors who so came into court should then be caled instead of the name of Jacoa) Jacobs, who stood in the panel next after Wm. Ironmonger. The counsel for the prisoncr argued before us that all those proceedings subsequent to the calling of the name of William Ironmonger the second time were erroneous. To decide :pon his objections we must consider what is the meaning of " going through or perusing the panel," according to tue rule laid down upon this subject. If it be that when the panel has been once called over no iurors who. did not answer to their names, and who were then absent, can be afterwards called and considered as jurors on the panel, although they immediately afterwards come into court before any other step in the proceeding was perfected, the plaintiff in error would he entitled to succeed, for we do not attach any importance to the fact that the names of the 12 jurors in Chapman's jury were not called in going over the panel when they were shut up in the custody of the sheriff. But this seems a very narrow construction of the rule; it would lead to very inconvenient consequences, and it is not at all necessary for the object which the statute had in view. Suppose that a juror is absent from court for some tempo. ra.ry purpose when bis name is called, and he returns into court immediately after the last name on the panel has been called, and offers to serve, and, being unobjectionable, he would make up a jury of 12, is he to be rejected, and is the list of those before challenged by the Crown to be again resorted to, so that the Crowu may be put to assign cause of challenge ? According to the modern practice of baving at the assizes one panel of jurors both for civil and criminal trials, and having two criminal courts sitting at the same time, it can hardly ever be expected that all the jurors in the panel should answer to their names or be in court at the same time when the names in the panel are called over and the Crown would often be entirely deprived of the limited right of challenging without cause, preserved to it for the due administration of justice, if, when the panel has once been called over, the obligation of challenging for cause the jurors ordered to stand by were immediately to arise. But we are of opinion that the panel is not to be conSidered as ' gone through," so as to require the Crown to assign cause of challenge, tilI it is exhausted-i. e., till, according to the usual practice of the Court and what may reasonably be done, the fact is ascertained that there are no more of the jurors in the panel whose attendance may be procured, and that, without requiring the Crown to assign cause of challenge, the trial could not proceed. In the present case the panel had not been exhausted, although once called over, and the 12 jurors who had served on Chapman's jury came into court when only nine jurors had been elected to be sworn for Miansell's jury, and when the remaining three might be taken from those 12 as conveniently and as much for the advantage of the'prisoner as if they bad all been in court and had answered to their names when the panel was first called over. In none of the cases referred toby the prisoner's counsel do we find anything to differ from this view of the subject No doubt it may he assumed, primd face, that all the jurors in the panel were in court when the panel was called over, and if, when it has been once called over,there is not a full jury made, the usual course would be immediately to call the names over sgain, andlto put the Crown upon assignig cause of challenge; the language used by the judges on these occasions is in reference to this supposition, that all were in court and answered to their names; but there is no decision or dicum to the effect that the panel may not be called over again, with a view to see whether there may not he some of the jurors in the panel who may have come into court, and who may make up a full jury, without putting the Crown to assign cause of challenge. It is always understood that the peremptory challenges of the Crown shall not put off the trial nor admit a bupplemental padel of jurors to be retuned by the sheriff. But, taking care to treat as jurors who may serve on the jury only those who are returned on the original panel, there is nothing to show that they are not to be deemed for all purposes on the panel if they appear and are ready to be sworn before the formation of the jury is completed. Neitherrin Koningsmark's casE, nor in O'Coigley'a case, nor in Horne Tooke's case does anything occur to countenance the doctrine now contended for on behalf of the prisoner. In Spencer Cowper's case Baron Hatsell does intimate an opinion that, under the circumstances there stated, the Crown ought to show cause of challenge, but that was after it had been ascertained that a full jury could not be made out from the panel by reason of the peremptory challenges of the prosecutor, and there can be no doubt that under such circumstances cause of challenge must be assigned. Chief reliance was placed en "Regina v. Geach" 9 Car. and Payne 499). But there Parke B., who presided, laid down the well-known rule, "The Crown may challenge without showing cause tiUl the panel is gone through and if there is not a full jury they must show cause." It turning out after once ca ling over the whole panel that there was not a full jury the learned judge says, "The The proper course will be to call the panel over in the same order as before, calling those who did not answer before, and omitting to call those who have been peremptorily challenged by the prisoner." Nothing more was decided or said which can be considered applicable to the present case, the description which followed being merely as to what is a good cause of challenge. Now, there can be no doubt that the course pointed out by the learned judge was, under the circumstances, the proper course, but is there any reason that if, after the panel had been once called over, and before any further step had been taken for the formation of the jur, jurors on the panel who had been called and did not at first answer had come into court in sufficient nu-mber to make a full jury they would have been rejected, and the Crown would have been put to assign cause forits challenges 6 Air. Welsby brought to our notice one instance since the revolution of 1688, and therefore to be respected, in which, upon a trial for high treason, it was decided by a judge of great eminence and high character that, after the panel had been once called over, it ought to be called over again with a view to procure the attendance of jurors who had not been in court when it was first called over. In the State Trials, Vol. XIII., p. 317, we find the following dialoguie recorded as having occurred during the trial of Peter Cook :- " Clerk of Arraigns.-My Lord, we have gone through the panel, we must now call the defaulters again. Thomas Clark, "Clark.-Here. "Sir B. Shower.-Was he here when he was caled over? " Attorney-Gener-.-That is nothing; he is here now. "Sir B. Shower,-But if there be a default of the jury, endl the King's counsel have challenged any one, they ought to show their cause; therefore we desire that they may show their cause why they challenged Mr. Simmons. "Lord Chief Justice Treby.-The King has power to challenge without showing cause till the panel he gone through, but if there be a default. of j rors when. the King challenges the King's counsel must show cause. "Sir B. Shower.-There is a default of jurors, mny Toret") "Lord Chief Justice Trebv.-Nobody is recorded absolutely a defaulter if he comes in time to be sworn." So Mr. Clark was sworn, instead of the King being obliged to show cause for challenging Mr. Simmons. This therefore, is an authority expressly in point, to show that Wm. Ironmonger was properly ordered to stand by, other jurors in the anel being ready to be sworn in sufficient numbers to ma6e up a full jury without him. Mr. Rus3ell dwelt much on a supposed vested interest that the prisoner had acquired in Wm. Ironmeonger as one of the jury to try him, unless cause could be shown by the Crown to prove that he did not stnd indifferent, But in truth, and accord. ing to law, there is no necessity nor right that a prisoner shall be tried by a particular jurynan till the prisoner has been given in charge to the jury. After the prisoners have had their challenges, the oath of the juryman is, "You shall well and truly try, and,a true deliverance make, between our Sovereign Lady the Qneen and the several prisoners you shal have in charge." When the prsoner is given in charge to the jury, by that jury he must be tried, and in felony or treason the jury cannot separate till they have found their verdict. But (as otten happens at the assizes) before a particular prisoner who has had his challenges is given in charge to the jury the Court rises and the juryseparate. Next morning a new jury is caled, when the prsoner again has his challenges, and possibly there may not be one individual upon the second jury tbat was sworn uponthe first. Yet t is regular. we now come to the assignment of error respecting Jabez Fhilpott. The facts, as gathered from the record, are that he was allowed to go into the jury-box with intent that he should be sworn and serve as a juryman, without any objection being made to him on either side. Then, before being sworn, he spontaneously said that 'he had conscientious scruples against capital punishments." The counsel for the Crown, without assgning this as acause of chalenge, simply prayedthe CourtthatJabezPhilpottshouldbeorderedtortand by. The prisoner's counsel prayed that the Crown should show cause of challenge. The presiding iudge said, IUndoubtedly, if you feel that vou cannot do your duty, you are quite right in saying so, and you had better withdraw." Jabez Philpott then withdrew, and thereupon it was " adjudged and ordered by the Court that Jabez Philpott should stand by." It is contended that this was erroneous, and that the Court was bound to order Jabez Philpott to be sworn upon the jury. But we are of opinion that the Court was bound, on the prayer of the counsel for the Crown, to order him to stand by. We here attach no weight to what Jabez Philpott said, and we consider this a challenge by the Crown without aseinging cause, the panel not yet being exhausted, and there being a probability that a full iury might be made up without swearing this individual. Nor do we attach any weight to the remnark which fell from the learned Judge, although it be unnecessarily set out upon the record. tut we wish it to be understood that we by no means acquiesce in the doctrine boldly contended for at the bar, on the authority of " Brownlow" (41), that a judge, on the trial of a criminal case, has no authority, there being no challenge either by the Crown or by the prisoner, to excuse a juryman on the panel when he is called, or to order him to withdraw, although he is palpably unfit, by physical or mental infirmity, to do his duty in the jury-box. We are not now to define the limits of this authority; but we cannot doubt that there may be cases, as if a juryman were completely deaf, or blind, or afficted with bodily disease which rendered it impossible for him tocontinue in the jury bhrx without danger to his life, or were insane, or druni, or with his mind so occupied by the impending death of a near relative tbat he could not duly attend to the evidence, in which, although, from there being no counsel employed on either side, or for some other reason, there is no objection made to the juryman being sworn, it would be the duty of the judge to prevent the scandal and the perversion of justice which would arise froa compelling or permitting such a juryman to be sworn, and to join in a verdict on the life or death of a fellow-creature. We bave now to attend to some objections of mere form, which it is said afford sufficient ground for reversing the judgment. Exception is taken to the expression in the record that the Court ordered and adjudged jurymen " to stand by,"-said to be language unknown to the law. The meaning of it, however, is quite obvious-namely, that being challenged by the Crown, the consideration of the challenge should be postponed till it should be seen whetber a fuU jury might not be made without them by others in the panel. No authority has been cited to show that "challenge" is a vox sqgnata which must be used like "feloniously," or " burglariously," or " of malice aforethought 2" and if the expression conveys no legal meaning error caunmot be assigned upon it. Another objection pointed out by the prsoner's counsel was, that the record states that abez Philpott had been " caUed and elected to the intent that he should be sworn" before the prayer on behalf of the Crown that he should stand by. But he had not been sworn, and the statement can only mean that he bad been allowed to enter the box that he mnight be swom and serve upon the jury, if, when be came to the book to be sworn, and before he was sworn, no objection should be made to him. There can be no doubt that at this time he might have been chaUenged by the prisoner, and the record shows that the prisoner's counsel required that cause of chaUenge should then be shown against him by the Crown. If he could then have been chaUenged for cause by the Crown, what reason can there be for saying that he could not then be challenged by the Crown without cause, there being still several jurors present who had not been challenged either by the Crown or the prisoner, from whom a full jury might be made? Then it was objected that the record does not show that the jurors named in the panel were " good and law'ul men of the county of Rent," and the case of "Whitebead v. the Queeni' (7 Q. B., 582) was cited, in which MIr. Justice Patteson expressed an opinion that the caption of an indictment was bad for not showing that the indictment was found by good and lawful men of the county; but, whether that opinion be right or wrong, in the present case by reasonable intendment the jurors must be taken to have been good and lawful Kentish men. The award of the venire to the sheriff of Kent requires him "to have before the Queen's justices Food and lawfulmenofthecountyaforesaid qualifiedaccording to law, by whom the truth of the matter may be better known." The record goes on to allege that the said sheriff, for the purpose aforesaid, empannels and returms the persons folowing, and arrays them in a panel, &c. He professea to obey the mandate he has received, and we must presume that he has done his duty and has obeyed it. We do not think it necessary to take further notice of the objection deduced from the supposed want of power in a commissioner under a commission of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery, to do what might be done by the Court of King's Bench than to say that, although in various matters the Court of Queen's Bench has powers which do not belong to commissioners of oyer and torminer and general gaol delivery, the statute in queation must receive the same construction before all courts and al judges, and a party accused must have the same rights when on trial for his life before whatever court or judge he may be tried. We have only furtber to notice teojcnththe namsi b ae after it had been gone through once, were not read iu the order in which theysto in the pauel, the 12 irors who had served on the trial of Chapman standing in different parts of the panel and being now caled over consecutively, instead of the clerk of assire calling the name of Jacob Jacobs, which stood immediately after that of William Ironmonger. There are sayings to be found in the books that the proper course is to call the names of the jurors as they stand in the panel, but them is no authority for asserting that this course may not be departed from when convenience requires; and if the jurors who had served on Chapman's jury were to be caled at all, the convenient course clearly was to call them immediately and consecutively, as all the others had been before caUled and had been either sworn or challenged. At Frost's trial for high treason the counsel for the prisoner objected to the jurors being caled in the order in which they stood in the paneL When they are empannelled in alphabetical orderit seems absurd to reqire that on each trial the clerk of assize must begin with tnc ' As ' and tf a second jury is called it is difficuIt to .ay in what order, according to the rule contended for, the names ought to be called, so as to avoid the risk of the judgment being reversed upon a writ of error. There was here an additional gravamen, that the order in which the names were read was suggested by the counsel for the Crown. But if the order was in itself unobjectionable, it could not become illegal from havin% been sugested either on behalf of the Crown or the prisoner. Having thus travelled through all the alleged errors assigned ou the rscord, and found that none of them can be sup. ported in point of law, we have only to give judgment for the Crown. The prisoner, who during the delivery of the above judgment was seated in the custody of his keeper, then rose, and Mr. Justice WIGIrMMAN, the senior puisne judge, ad. dressedhim as follows :-Thomas Mause l, you have been indicted for the murder of Alexander M'Burney, and convicted of that offence at the winter assizes for the county of Kent, held at Maidstone in December last. Sentence of death was then passed upon you, upon that conviction, which still remains unexecuted, you having brought a writ of error ianthis court, on which judgment has just be-n pronounced. I shall not pass that sentence upon you, but I order that the keeper of the gaol of Newgate, in whose custody yon now are, do deliver you to the sheriff of the county of Kent and the keeper of the gaol there ; and that the said sheriff and keeper do execute the said sentence sf death on Monday, the 18th of May. The prisoner was then removed.

COURT OP EXCMQUM4 WEDmSAy. mAy n NLw TRIAL PAPViP Usitti,W in Ba"n_ CROJUCH V. THE GREAT WSTERN RAILWAY COMWANY. This was an action by the well-known carrier, who has been long engaged in litigation with railway companies, to recorer damages from the defendants for negfecting to deliver a certain parcel at Plymouth. Thedefendantsb their pleas denied the breach as alleged, and also pleaded that the said parcel was offered and tendered to the consignee (who was the plaintiff himself, he being also consignor) at Plymouth, when he refused to pay the sum of zs. s;d. then demanded for the carriage. To this last plea the plaintiff replied that after such tender and refusal he within a reasonable time offered to pay the sum so demanded, and required the defendants to deliver the parcel to him, which tey refused to do. At the trial, before the Lord Chief Baron, it appeared that the parcel in I question was delivered by the plaintiff to, and accepted by, the defendants in London, to be carried to Plymouth as an ordinary parcel, on which the carriage would be ls. 6d. or thereabouts. In the course of transit the parcel burst, and it was then found to be a packed parceL ae South Deven Railway thereupon, as the agents of the defendants, on tendering the parcel at Plymouth demanded 2s. 3d., which sum the plaintiff refused to pay. Upon this the company told the plaintiff the parcel would be sent back to London, and in accordance with that intimation the parcel was returned that night to London. On the following day the plaintiff called at the office at Plymouth and tendered the sum demanded, when he learnt that the parcel was in London. Upon these facts the jury found that the parcel had been sent up to London before a reasonable time had elapsed within which the plaintiff had a right to tender the sum demanded, and they returned a verdict for the plaintiff. Afterwards, this rule for a new trial or to enter a verdict for the defendant was obtained on the gronnds,-1st, that the defendants were not liable under the circumstances; 2d, that they were not bound to keep the parcelat Plymouth after the refusal of the plaintiff, and that if the act of sending it back to London was wrongful it was tho act of the South Devon Ilailway Company, for which the defendants were not responsible. The rule also claimed a new trial on the ground that the ending of the jury as to the question of unreasonableness was contrary to the evidence. Mr. JoSELH BPROw showed cause against and Mr. BovnLL and Mr. UNTA?E supported the rule. At the conclusion of the argumentk The CHsx BARON intimated that their Lordships would consider the case. Judgment deferred. bILLS V. HOLTON AND OTHERS. Mr. HASESA S and Mr. C. POLLOCK showed cause against the rule which had been obtained by the defendants to s3t aside the verdict for the plaintiff and to enter a nonsuit. This was an action charging the defendants, who are trustees of the Sheerness Waterworks Company, with negligently damnaging a well which they had leased with other works to the plaintiff. It appears that the water in the well having become discoloured in June last, the plaintiff, though his lease bound him to repair, applied to the company, who determined to repair it, and entered into contracts for that purpose. By the bungling management of the workmen employed by the party who undertook the '.b, the well, which was 368 feet deep, after various misiaps, fellin altogether, proving the old adage that "it is well to let well alone," whereby the plaintiff lost all the profits of the season. The answer to this was that the defendants were not liable, and that the plaintiff ought to go elsewhere for compensation. The jury having found a verdict for the plaintiff for 1301., sub. iect to the set-off of the defendants for rent, which had been pleaded to the money counts, it was now argued tbat, though the company might not have beon liable to do the repairs, yet that, as they had, through the defendants, undertaken that obligation, they were bound by an implied contract so to do the work as not to injure the plaintiff. . BOV, Mr. LUSH, and Mr. HANNEN appeared in support of the rule, contending that there was no evidence io fix them with any responsibility for the negligence of the wormen, throughwhich, the mischief complained of by the plaintiff had arisen. Th:e Cany, upon considering the whole case, was of opinion that there ought to be a new trial, with the view of ascertaining through a jury what the precise undertaking or contract was under which the defendants hadunadertak3en the repairs. The role must therefore be made absolute for a new triaL Judgment accordingly.
CI UPT OF BANERUPTCY, Bao4nghau-trA mmy 6. I RE GEORGE CO N.%TArTTN'V VPv n-I I (Bcfore Mr. C&mmukin,nor t.mwrY I The bankrupt is described as a merchant, of Greshamhouse, Old Broad-street, trading under the style or firm of C. Franghiadi, Sons. His accounts commence January, 1853, with a capital of 12,500l., and close March 14, 1857, with the follow n items :-Dr., unsecured creditors, 91,4981.; creditors aiding security, 13,7681.; liabilities, 82,9391., of which it is expected 25,200L will come against the estate. Cr., Cash, 3,65 * good debtos, 4,2421.; other debtors, 10,4371., as estimated to realize 14291; property, 14,7481. ; property held by creditors. 15,2191. amount due from Franghiadi and Valenti, 23,2451; amount due by X. Valenti, 3,4121 The profits of the bankrupt are put down at 13,9781.; the losses at 40,1351; the trade expenses at 20,5841.; and the drawings at5,055N. The liabilities, 82,9391, include to the Bank of London 13,933L; the London Discount Company 12,6651; the London Joint Stock Bank 8,4031.; the National Discount Company 14,9931.; and the Royal Bank of Lverpool, 4,6251 These liabilities arise a most exclusively from the bankrupt's draughts upon or endorsements of the biDs of Greek and other foreign houses. Subjoined is an abstract of the leading points of the heport of the official assignee (Mr. Pennell) :-" The bank. rupt, who is a Grcek, commenced business at Liverpool in January, 1853, with a bon fd capital of 12,5001. consist, lug of cash and goods placed to the credit of the hovere i house by the bankrupt's father. He appears to havc ec also connected in partnership with mercantile houses at Trieste and Alexandria. Of the unsecured debts of 91,4981,, the sum of 41,924L. consists of billa drawn by the houses in Alexandria and Trieste upon, and accepted by, the house in London. It is expected that of the liabilities, 82,939L, not more than 25,2601. will become proveable against the estate; this calculation is, however, to some extent conjecturaL The trade expenses of 20,5841. consist of travelling expenses, stationery, and stamps 13,2691. ; interest, 6 001.; in. smrance, 1,3061. These entries have been reguiarly passed through the books, and, although the total is of such serious amount, he sees no reason to doubt that it has been expended. The losses, 40,1351, are 15,8031. on merchandise, 5,668 by freights, and 14,4764 by bad debts. The bankrupt's trading consisted in importinv ILdian corn, wheat, wool, cotton, rice, &c., and upon ail sach imports a commission of 10 per cent. was charged, that forming part of the profits, and making a charge on the merchandise. The bankrupt's books have been well kept, and corroborate his balance-sheet." This was the examination meeting. Mr. PEACEEY, for the trade assignees, and Mr. Pennell, the official assignee, concurred in opinion that the accounts were such as the bankrupt might pass upon. Mr. CUDLEY, for Mr. Luzard, of Paris, the petitioning crecitor, asked for an adjournment to allow time for inquiry. The bankrupt suspended payment on the 20th of February. Twenty-two days after that time lie was adjdicated bankrupt. His accounts, as submitted to the creditors on February 22, were widely different from those now furnished. He might instance the unsecured creditors being then returned at 12,7541., whereas they were now returned at 91,498. Hlis HoNoup said that both the official and trade assgnees being satisfied, the bankrupt mi2ht pass, all questions being reserved for the certificate meeting. IN RE ELL. The bankrupt was a china and glass dealer in Blackfriarsroad. MIr. DOXIIA applied on his behalf for a first class certificate, and attributed the bankrupt's failure entirely to his being a shareholder in the loyal British Baink. The COIJRT granted a first class certificate. (Before Mfr. Commsioner FON;BLANQU.) L25 RE JAMES STBVENS TREIP. The bankrupt was a dealer in mining shares, of Lombard. street-chambers, Clement's-lane. It would appear from a statement of affairs by Messrs. Harding and Puilein that his debts are 15,0001., the assets being about 5001. This was the examination meeting. The accounts not having been filed in time, Mr. LLNX;rTER6, for the assignees, and Mr. WYATr, for the bankrupt, concurred in the necessity for an adJournment. Adjournment accordingly. IN RE VAN RAALTE, JUT. The bankrupt was an importer of French goods, of Glocester-terrace, Hoxton. This was the certificate meetinA g Mr. _agley opposed, Mr. Depree supported. His HONOuR said, he had a doubt whether the certificate ought not to be refused altogether. The bankrupt had given away his creditors' money, and his course of trading had ben most unjustifiable. The bankrupt would receive a third class certificate after two yeer' suspension, three months being without protection.

Mr. Hughes, being the fist witness sworn, said that in compliance with the warrant intruasted to him on the previous (Tuesday) night, about 8 o'clock, he proceeded to the house of Mr. Russell for the purpose of carrying it into execution. (The warrant was produced, and was datedthe 30th of April.) He had been informed previously that betting was carried on at the house. He went there with several police officers. When he entered he saw several persons in front of the bar. The defendant (Wuasell), whom he then did not know, wasbehind the bar. He asked for Mr. Thomas Russell. Hesaid, "Iamathe person." Witnesshadpreviously stated that he was a superintendent of 'olice and showed hLs warrant. He inquired of Mr. Russeh if he were the owner and occupier of tho house. He replied that he wwa. Be sent Mr. Inspector MLckerel with several polioeconstables to search the rooms. The other persons were found them in them. Mr. Rusll was also searched. On him were found 19 sovereigns and 2L 10s. in silver. In two measuring pots money was also found-in one 49 sovereigns, and In the other l6. 10s. 6d. He remained in the bar pa.lour while the constables were away. Whlte he was there Mr. Russellobserved, "If you can take myrword, there is not a betting-book in the house. There has been such a botheraboutbttin-hooks thatItookcarethere should be none in the house." Mr. Herring.-And very proper too. Policeman Cocks, 1911), stated that on the 28th of Apil he received instructions from Mr. Hughes to visit the house of the defendant RusselL He went there the next day, between 11 and 12@clock. Hesav him (Russell) and the barmaid behind the bar. A man came in vvho asked the odds against Blink Bonnie, which was to run for the thousand guineas stakes. The prisoner went to the end of the bar, and spoke to a ma. (He was identified among the other prisoners, nd stated that his name was May.) Mr. Russell said something to May, who then wrote down in a book. Many other persons then came in, and stood in front of the bar. Witness was in plain clothes. Upon so many comI ing a person exclaimed, " Don't crowvd about the bar-w.e shal have the 'Robert' about uas presently." Mr. BROUGHToN.-The Roberts? Cocks.-Yes, Sir; that is the nickname we go by from the Marble-arch al along Oxford-street. (Laughter ) MEr. Herring.-I have often heard that they were called "Bobbies," but never " Roberts' before. (Laughter.) CockL.-The man said he would back Harkaway. He gave something to Mr. Russell over the bar. Mr. Russell went to May, who entered something in a book. He gave aome money to the man, who observed that the horse ran at Newimarket on the 30th. In answer to further questions the witness said that he saw Mr. RusseU give money to several persons. He gave several sovereigns to a man named Murrel, a cheesemonger.a Mr. Herring remarked that there was no horse namned "Harkawavy. '(A book was produced which showed that the horse alluded to went by the name of Empress). The witness further proved that he accompanied Mr. Superintendent Hughes the previous (Tnesday) night, and that when told on the former occasion to visit the house he was directed by Mr. Hughes not to bet. Police-constable Crisp, 352 A, said that last Thursday he went about noon with a friend to the house of the prisonerRussel. Hewas in plain clothes. A coachman cameiD, who offered to back a horse that was to run at Chester for the thousand guineas stakes. Another man put down tbree half-crowns. A respectably dressed man, whose name he understood to be Mdgell, came in. Mr. RnsseU saidtohim, "I have not your name in the bnok; you must havA backed your horse somewhere else." Mr. Russell then gave him a Bank of England note. Witness could not say whether it was a 5. or 10Z note. Upon receiving the money he said he would stake lOs. on Blink Bonnie axnd some other starter. He put the money on the bar, which Mr. Russell took up. Another person came in, and Mr. Bussell said to him, " I suppose you have come for your money." He gave the man several sovereigns. On wida2 itness was again there, when he heard Mr. Russell say, "I do not bet to-day; I am paying off' The witness further stated that he was at the house with the superinteudent on Tuesday night. He corroborated whbat had been already deposed to, and produced a book and several other documents, printed and manuscript, relating to betting transactions. MIr. Inspector Mackerel also corroborated the evidence above given, and produced several oetting papers connected with the past and ensuing races. Mr. Herring cross-examined the several witnesses, but without shaking their evidence. Mr. Hughes having stated that he had no further witnesses to examine, Mr. Herring remarked upon the evidence, and said that, With the exception of four of the prisoners who had in their possession papers referring to horseracing, and Mr. Russell, ther was no evidenco upon which they could be legally detbined, and he thought that the magistrate would not consider the mere fact of being in possession of such papers wvas sfficient for him(Ms.Bronton) to inflict penalties on them. He had similar papers in his possession at home and if the superintendent went to the House of Commons he would find many members having racing calendars betting-books. &c., in their pockets. With respect to his chient, MIr. Russell, he hoped that-, should the magitstrate think this an offence, as it was the first time such a charge was ever brought against him, and as he had promised to him (Mfr. Herring) not to offend again, the smallest possible penalty woufld be tmposed. MIr. BROUos'rON remarked that the Act was very defective as regarded persons found in a betting-house against whom no charge had been brought, and that the Act o= Parhament required no penalty to be put upon those found unaer such circumstances. The charge had been clearly proved against the defendantRussell,who, he wasofopinion, had been carrying on for some time the business of a betting-house. Much credit was due to Mr. Swperintendent Hughes for the ability he had exercised in carrying the warrant into effect, and which had been done with much discretion. He should discharge all the prisoners except Mr. RusselL He was liable to a penalty of 1001. and six mnonths'imprisonnment with hard la60ur. Be should act as many of his brother magistrates had acted in cases similar to that which was now before him. An example ought to be made of persons like the deFendant keeping betting- The prisoner was fined in the mitigated penalty of 251., or two months' imprisonment in default. Mr. Herring asked to have the property found on the prisoners returned to them. MEr. Hughes said that every document, with the exception tf thatt whichreferred to bettingtransactions, he was willing Mr. BaOUGIETON offered no objection. Mr. RusseU paid the 25L penalty. CL]zxxWErT-George Gayton, a private watchman, was charged with being concerned with two other men in custody in stealing eight gallons of valuable foreign brandy, a quantity of cigars and tobacco, and four bottles of port wiane, the property of his master, Mr. Hinton, the proprietor of te Bighbbur Barn Tavern. The prisoner was remanded until Monday next, when the other prisoners will als^o be brought up. SeVThWAP..-Thomas Genge, the proprietor of the Great Britain beershop, in the Waterloo-road, surrendered to his bal, charged with being concerned with three others not yet in cu y in violentlv assaulting Simon Nelson, a Prussian Jew, carrying on busmess as a draper in NicholassTuIe, Southampton, and robbing him of 40 sovereigns in his beershop. br. Solomon a papeared for the accused. Mr. COMBz si he should at once commit theprisoner for trial. Mr. Solomon supposed the same bail would be accepted. He was a wealthy tradaesan, and there had been no complaint ainst the housebefore amagistrate until the present unfortunate transaction. MIr. COMBa accented the same bail, sud the prisoner was liberated until th& next Old Bailey Sessions, on Monday next. L&MBEI5.-Mr. Standedge attendod before Mr. ELLInOT, and, addressing him, sad,-A person named David M'lKsy, and not M'Cabe, made a statement before your worship on Monday last, in which my name waNs mentioned; I therefore trust you ^ill allow me to say a few words in explanation. It is not true that M'Kay was employed by me after the election, nor is it true that I was one of Mr. Wilkinson's agents or one of his committee. Being desirous to expose the corrupt ypractices which I have reason to believe have Tasen place, . amIacting in concert with some other -entlen en to obtain information. M'Ka volunteered to give me information of the nature referre to, and said he could prove severad cases of bribery. I told him if he could establish any case to my satisfaction I would engage his services. He made statements, giving me names of persons and addresses and particulars in detail. Being determined to obtain a corroboration of his statements before I entered into an engs ement with him, I passed several days in investigating the tacts alleged by him, and I founi. all that he bad told me was a tisue of fabrications, not only untrae, but destitute of the slightest foundation. Indignant at his conduct, and treating with indifference the threats he had made on the subject, I refused to see or hold any communication with him. In conclusion Mr. Standedge said that M'Kay had assailed others as well as him, and he trusted that ass explanation would receive the same amount of publication as the complaint of MWKay. -Mr. ELUioTT remarked that he had no control over the press - but still as a matter of fairness he had no doubt his (Mr. Standedge's) wish would be complied with.

THE CROPS IN THE MIDLAND COUNTn.-The -last week has been a trying time for the husbandman A good deal of rain and some snow feU in April, with occasional daysof aetuallyhotweather,whichwere verytrying to vegetation. The wheat at one time grew rapidly, too fas', perhaps, rendering it susceptible of injury by frost, and in many places it looks yellow. The dry weather of the last fortnight, however, has been highly beneficial. In many places it is verl thick requiring the free use of the hoe and harrow. On the whole, the wheat crop in the counties of Glocester, Worcester, and Hereford is highly promising. Barley sowing has been at Inst brought to a concluEion; it was much interrupted by the wet. Beans have come up well, and oats where planted, though not many are grown in the midland district, look welL Vetches are luxuriant, and the seed pastures promise abundantly. There can be no doubt that the crop of grass will be one of the heaviest which we have had in this district for years past. The rain came just in the nick of time for it, insurng for the swath a good start, and already grass is very thiLk and growing, better than could be expected with the cold north-easterly winds which we have now had blowing some time, but which, it is hoped, wil soon be blown out to give way to warm growing weather. This cool, dry weather, however, is very suitable to the fruit crops. The slight frosts which we have had have as yet done no injury either to the early fruit blossom or the early potatoes. The latter are just appearing above ground, and with a little care may be protected from iniury br night frost for another fortnight, at the expiration of which time they may be reckoned out of danger. The pear and cherry blossom is coming out ploriouly, and the Worcestershire and Here. fordshire orchasds are assuming their usual beautiful vernal appearance. Apples show a most abundant bloom, and there is every prospect of a most bountiful crol of fruit throughout Rerefordshire, Glocestershire, and Worcestershire which will, it is hoped, compensate for the total failure oE last year. Cider and perry are becoming very scarce and dear. ATIEmPED SUICIDE.-On Saturday afternoon a determined attempt at self-destruction was made by a journeymau smith named Thomas Jane residing with his father at Rampisham, a village near Evershot, Dorsetshire, at which place there is a station of the Great Western Bail. way. There had been a funeral at the house during the iday, and for some days previously Janes had been in a very dejected state of mind. Medical assistance was at once obtained from Evershot, and Mr. Clapoot, surgeon, sewed up three deep gashes in Janes's throat, which that unfortunate man had made with a razor. Had the man not held the ildn of his throat with his hand while using the razor death inust have ensued. After the surgeon had left him on Saturday a guard was placed over him by Janes's father until Tuesday, when he was brought before the magistrates (Mr. J. Henming and Mr. W. L. Henning) at the Shirehall, Dorchester, in the custody of Sergeant Tee, of the county con. stabulary. After the case had been fuly heard and the man Jppearing to be q.ite sane, although Mr. Clpoot EaidJanes was insane when e saw him on Saturday, the bench carefully considered the matter, and determined on the faithful promise of the father to take care of the sufferer until Saturday next, when the case will be taken before a faUll bench. On the representation of the father, who is a very respectable person, the committal to prison for the interim-presunnng the sanity of Janes at the time of the suicidal at. tempt-was foregone. The man is 29 years of age, and, although married, has not lived continuously with his wife for two years. [Advertisement.)-" Dr. Armstrong's Personal Narrative of She Disoorery of th,.

The Commisioners will hold their meetings at No. 1, White.] hall-ysmd, lately occupied by the Army Works Corps. Dating the past few days a series of highly interesting experiments have been undertaken at the head-quarters of the Bo,yal Engineers' establishment, Chatham, in the presence of Major-General T. Blanshard, C.B., Colonel H. Sandham, wid other offlcers of the Royal Engineers, for the purpose v,f examining and testing a new description of suspension'bridge for the passago of artillery, cavalry, and infantry over rivers and streams, the invention of Sergeant-Major J. ,Jones, R.E. The spot selected for the experiments was a portion of the river Medway, aS St. Mary's-creek, adjoining the practising ground of the Sappers and Miners, where one of the newly-invented bridges was constructed over the creek. The chief merit of the inventionconsists ia its er treme simplicity, as a field bridgo of this description can be consTucted aad thrown across A river of from 6§ to 160 feet span iu less then tkree hours, and when comnneted wil be capable of sastainixg the pass2gedPfheavy field-pieces and any Zsnimber rf troops required to proceed over it; after which Iat can be taken te pieces in an exceedingly seort time9, and 'transported with the troops. 'Segeant-MA.or UTones's suspension-bridge is formed by usin the -shet-iron bands of 'she new-gabions introdneoed into tke service, whidh are also 'his invention ; these bands tre each 'i feet 3 inches in length, and Bjinches wide, with a 20-gauge, ani are fastened together'by means of the holes rnd buttens used in -enoircling thegabion.

THE TEBURE 'OF r AND ~rN INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIh:ES. Sir.-Your Calcutta coaespondext appears to.labour under a misapprehension of the nature of ryotwar, as existing in the ceded districts of Bellary and Cuddapah, on the Masdras establishment. The term simply imports that the settlementoftherevenueis mado with the individual ryot or cultivator for the land be occupies, and is used in contradistinction to the zemindory and.other systems according to which lands paying revenue-are held by middle-men. In the districts above named the ryotwar system is based upon a survey and assessment I by fields. The rent can never exceed the assessment, nor can the ryotbe dispossessed of his land so long as he pays the regalated charge upon it. le may, however, alienate-it by sale or otherwis ; and it w!ould certainly acquire a marketable value if by improve. ment it should be rendered-capable of-yielding a free return beyond the rent exigible by Governmont and the ordinary profits of agriculture. Under all private transfers the claim of the State remains, of course, unimpaired. The ryotwar system possesses advantages peculiar to itself. It necessitates a far more intimate connexion between the European officers of the Government and the agricultural lasses, who constitute the bulk of the people, than any ether plan of revenue adiainistration requires -or. admits - and thus it is better calculated than rany other for making , sneraly known the prinoiplas of our rule, and for promoting attachment to our Government. The duties it imposes are fitted to call forth aU the. energies of the most gifted public servants, and So rkeep them in constant play, and thus to train men for the highest degrees of public usefulness. lt affords employment to.a large number of native servants of the Brahminical,caste, who are excellent men of :usiness, and who would obheswise have, difficulty in finding means of subsistence. The pubaicity with .-which its details are conducted is highlyfavourable to the prevention of abuses; and if acts of oppres nliaveoake, place under it, they must assuredly be asoribed, not to the system itself, but to faults in its administration. - Conducted by prudent zealous, and pamstaking men, actuated with kindly feelings towards the people, it is probaiAythe 'best plan of admini-s 'tration both for the Government and -its &gricultural subjects. A modersate assessmn et as, 'nevertheless, essential to itS success. The ceded districts became Briffsh possessions' in 1800and under the personal and enlightened direction and superintendence of thot eminently distinguished iuan,, the late ir Thomas Munro, they were surveyed .and assessed, and ryotwar was introduced into them as an organized system. Before it had, hbeo-ver, been lo3sig in operation it was sap. planted by a vilags lease system, and, this having pruped a failuwe, the rvotn'ar system was restored' to the districts, which had bean deteriorated underthe-loases-first for three and then for ten yea-s. -No name with which I am acquAnted.4ever stood so.high as that ef the lament2d Sir Thomas Munro in respect of profound knowledge of Eadian revenue affairs; -and- the system of man;Cement whi,ch had the approval of -his mature judgment as the best,caited for the provinces,into which it Vwas atf.int introduead under his immediate care as principal colloctor, and aiterwards reverted to under - his con-- trolling authority as'G-overnor, must 'undoubtedly possess strong grownds of recommendation.

The children were taught reading, Vthiag, afrithmetic, orthography, gramnmar, an outline of histcry audgeography, with an occasional collective lesson on oommontlhings, and a Bible lesson daily. The elder girls weo dailytaught needlewerk. 563 obildren had tbeen admil.ted Ito the dayschool during the past year, whence 47 girls-had obtained plwces, and 58 boys ; and.33.'totally *destitute boys and five girls had also been received into per- :auennt refuges. Thus 143 boys and girls had been provided for fron this department of the institution. The average number of children attending the day-school in the merning was 260; in the afternoon 290. Many of the boys who had obtained situations fromn the schools had been employed by the committee, who could testify to their good behaviour. The demand for boys from the -school had of lsae been so great that the-supply was checked till new monitors could be brought into training to assist in the school. The girls' industrialsewing class was in every way important. It imparted the kind of instruetion. which was of the greatest service. 'It was a pro- paation for their going into service to obtain a livelihood by4heir own industry. le average attendance at the class was 90, 32 of whom had left during the year for situations. Ot of 250 who had entered the alass the lady superintendent reportecl that not one of them had gone astray. Two who had gone wrong before they joined the class became reformed, and were now filling situations. By the cash aocount it appeared that the balance of last year and the eash received during the present year made an aggreg3ge sum of 1,4461. lls. 5d., and that the amount of disbursements for salaries, rent, books, prizes, &c., was 1,2641. Os. 4Ad., leaving a balance in hand of 1821. 1ls. Old.; of course exclusive of the contributions of the evening. Lord JOHN RUSSELL then came forward to move the first resolution. Hlis Lo-dship was received with enthusiastic cheering. His Lordship said that the resolution he had to move began by stating that the success so manifestly attending the various operations of that institution during the past year demnanded the expres. sion of their warmest gratitude to Almighty God. That statement he thought was fully borne out by the details contained in the report, which described the various benefits that had been conferred on the -objects of the institution. It was found that those who appeared to be the most abject and wretched outcasts of society had, by every means possessed by the institution-fer the committee were not so blind as to look to one means only-been brought to consider what were their duties, and to become good subjects, good men and women, and good Christians. (Cheers.) Among the means thus used was furnishing, at an easy rate, persons with clothes; for those who were ragged and who 'lived at a home which was filthy with every physical and moral contamination, soon lost all resnect for themselves and fell into the ways of vice and crime, feeling as if there was no one who cared for them either in this world or the next. But, happily, they were in error in that respect. In the physical world they were told that seeds, after having been embalmed with an Egyptian mummy for thousands of years, had been sowu and had showu that their vitality was undiminished, and that the wheat corn from those seeds had again sprung up to fertilize the earth; and could they for a moment think that the Almighty Being who thus preserved vitality in what apparently was a worthless piece of weed should not preserve a vitalty in the soul of man ? (cheers) and thatthere should not, when the person seemed sunk in the lowest depths of wretchedness and vice, be an ember in that soul which might be rekindled, and which being rekindled might produce a flame thatmight finally lead to an immortal life? (Cheers.) The question was whether or not it was possible to redeem those beings who seemed to have no sense of what was due to themselves,--either in regard to their present or their fature state,-or what was due to the Almighty who created them? There might be objections made to the efforts of such societies as those they were then advocating, and it might be said that, although in some particular instsnces, arising from oertain peculiar influences, a few hundreds of people might be thus rescued, and some might find refuge in these schools and temporary homes, yet the great mass would still remain unaffected by all the efforts of these institutions. That argument might be good at the present moment, but there was no reason to think it would be the case at all future time. On the contrary, there was every reason to believe that if the efforts now making were to become general, and if, not individuals only, but the whole community and the State itself, were to take proper methods to insure that education should everywhere be extended, at some future time, not very remote, they might rescue society in general from those dreadful evils which, whether they were looked upn as physical, or as moral, or as polticl or, Lastly, as religious calamities, were of the gravest and most serious kind. (Cheers.) Persons engaged in the benevolent work of preachingtemperance had calculated the large amount which was expended by the population of the kingdom for spirituous liquors only. He believed that if one-tenth of that sum were devoted to educating the people and teaching them their duty to -God and mnan, a great result indeed would be gained; and although crime would not cease, and although persons would, doubtless, stil fal in the way of temptation, yet a far better resalt would be exhibited to the world, and they would have the satisfaction of knowing that the present criminal and vicious part of the population would be sensibly decreased in number. He was convinced that by the constant operation of a society like the one he was then addresming,-its members acting day by day, and not as in his own case giving an occasional attendance only,-a general result would be produced greater than any person could at present anticipate. (Cheers.) The noble lord then moved the following resolution:- "Th.t the sucoess so 'manifestly attending the various operations of this intltution during the past yeas demnands the express on of our warmest gmtitude to Almighty God, ana that the report thereof be printed and circulate4 under the direction of the The Rev. Mr. AVEIDNG seconded the resolution, and Mr. DALTON supported it by an able speech, in the course of whioh he said that the zel question before the meeting was whether a large number of degraded and uninstructed poor children should remain as they were, or whether the means of Ragged Schools should -be augmented, so that they might be rescued from their wretched condition and be made useful members of society. The resolution was adopted unanimously. The following resolution was then moved by the Rev. Mr. MACGUIRE, seconded by the Rev. Dr. ARCHER, and supported by Mr. PAYNE, in a most humorous speech:- "C onvinced that the earxycultivattonof the ha'-it of aelf-dependence Is essential to the happineas end wellbeing of mnan, aud seeing that get rrmnnei ien to the-development ot this principle in all depatmens o thi intitutlioi. accompanied byte'luayi itune The d esolttion wags d e to, and a collectio u Was then made, andthe contribaeions towvards thefunds of the socieey A retotdution tas then pased appointing thi omficere and commits3e for the ensuiagishearto-toe Earl of Sha rtesbury President, and the Dake of argyll Vihee-Presidento NAe vnici of thanks, ex rewd iu he most complimentary teres, olution wassagred -, aaatond ato Lord Shaftesbthry for ls ndnss 1 prsidng oer he,eeting. made, dthe cnmtrhtten towardsteft d of the ompimen w oereove lo wwib eral.? te wee Akilresolsuation wasthenzard, appowinthinthofficyidcers an comem.ithinttheo esusnogthe saor.e TEa rfn ShatelsteIr bheirbal coodtin esOf th4fi3deebt dwAiPtioss If becthey were Pever e osien and te o dkes of edctionl ic-e4s iden.er ne hai- er boafebtank, eofleasr-in the mi t complimEes eanta thers, waaithno passe thed , acamdant aod haftesbuay yoherae watboniern i.sWemo , no (Che Y 4fe hdreiremined bu atf ors cku nes teaching. & er tpreid e te e m tingt shttime they ms noave CsIr?U ackowldge the Z complimenti1adids pnandtokccsind toc tobee theatve wappste obhectionsa hagod be sot h system ofid4ia raining.thb socety Somterb ecation atiie wedb thie rlaggedchaoo was ticolow.

THE LUNDHfLL COLLIBBY EXPLOSIO2. LNDEaLL WuEDNESDAY AFTEsNoOx. 3i4even weeks have now elapsed since the occurrence o ' 'this fearful calanity, anad only about one-fifth of the bodies ,of the unfortusne men Idlled have as yet been recovered, and it is to be feared that some weeks at least will elpse Ufore the whole cn" ha cn The fallsuf roof are the great obstacles which interpose as a barrier to the recovery of the bodies, all of which will have to be carefully removed before the work of recovery can be considered to be complete. Up to yesterday afternoon 31 bodies had been recovered, and from that time up to this afternoon 11 more had beeu bronght out. A littUa before 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon the men at work under Mr. Webster discovered three bodies in the third boardgate on the south side of the pit, which were identised as those of Thomas Logan, of West Melton, aged 33 ears; Richard Corbridge, of Lnudhill, aged 27; and Alfred Windle, of Lundhill, aged 30-all of whom were foundtogether, and had every appearance of having been ab dinner when the explosion took place. They were removed to the reception.shed, and will be interred this day. in the next relay, under Mr. W. P. Maddison, two more bodies were found in the same boardgate. a little before 6 o'lock, and proved to be those of Josiah Witney, of Lundhill, aged 24, and Daniel Chieholm, of West Melton, ewed 27. 'lhe knowled e of the working places in which the men were employeyFis a means of leading to their more speedy identification. When the workmen come upon any bodies the relatives of the men known to have been working in that partioular part of the mine are sent for, with a vievw to theiridentification; and so far many persons have been found in the places where they were known to have been working, and been identified accordingly. This morning (Wednesday), a little before 6 o'clock, three more bodies were found in the second boardgate, on the south side, one of which on being brought out was identified as that of Peter M'AUister, of Lundhill, aged 26 years, but the other two, up to the time of my leaving the spot this afternoon, ha not been identified, At noon to.day three more bodies, which had been fonnd in the second boardgate on the south side, were brought out, and identified as Abram Wildsmith, of Jump, aged 18; John Malkin, of Lundhill, aged 22. and Levi Jackson, of Lundhill, aged 44. The number of bodies lying in the shed at the time our report was despatched was 19, of which 13 are going to be interred,-10 in the general grave in Darfield Churchyard, two at Wath-upon-Dearne, and one at West Melton. The total number of bodies now recovered is 42, and it is expected that more wiU be brought out this evening. It seems to be generaUy considered that the majority of the workmen were killed instantaneonsly, and were unable to leave the places where they were working. At the time of the explosion the greater number would be in their benks, or working places, and their first impulse on the occurrence would be to run out of them as speedily as possible, and get down the boardgates to the bottom of the shaft. The bodies not found in the boardgates must be in the benka, and the inference is that from faDs of roof or the prevalence of afterdamp the miners were prevented from leaving their work-places, and any inspection of those places has as yet been impossible, owing to the devastation caused by the falls of roof. Every precaution is taken by the committee in charge to preserve the health and safety of the volunteers, and no expense is spared to have everything done that science and skll can accomplish in recovering the bodies of the unfortunates, and clearing the mine of those obstructions which prevent a thorough and scientiiic examination of the entire workings. The: committee who have the distribution of the funds collected for the relief of the widows and orphans are using their best endeavours to realize such a sum as it is expected wvill be requiredto meet the wants of the sufferers, bat which yet falls abortof wrhatis wanted. The sub-committee, essrs. Cooke, Osteliffe, Marshall, and Hopwood, attend weekly at the schoolroom at WombweD, wnen a sum of something like 70l. is distributed.
BB1rTIS} AND FOBEIGN BIBLE SOCIETY.-The 53d annual meeting of the supporters of this society was held at Exeter-halU yesterday morning. The Earl of Shaftesbury presided. The report, which was read by the Rev. S. P. Bergme, the secretary, gave a detailed account of the operations of the society at home and i the several countries in which its agents are employed, with the following general results :-lssues of the society last year from the depository at home, 1,001,965 copies; from the depositozies abrod, 515,893 copies; total, 1,517,858, being an increase of 43,464 copies over the circulation of any preceding year. This total would have been greater had the return of the Chinese distribution been complete, and if it had included the issues of the afflhated Indian societies. The issues from the comnmencement of the society amount to 32,381,759 oapiet of the Bible, the New Testaument, and portions of the New Testament. Among the special facts recorded it was stated that a short time since a large ouantity of copies of the Scriptures was sent to St. Peteisburg, the duty amounting to 4131., which the Emperor, on application, readily remitted; andthatinTurkey, a copy having beenpresented to the Sultan by an agent of the society, His Majesty had ordered portions of it to be read to him every day. With reference to China, the report expressed a hope that the present hostilities would lead to a more extended opening in that country for the diffusion of the Word of Cod. The receipts for the year ending the 31st of March have exceeded those of any preceding year (excluding the special funds). The amount applicable to the general purposes of the society is 68,3811. 15s. 3d., and the amount received for Bibles and Testaments, 69,3741. l9s. Sd.; making the total receipts from the ordinary sources of income 137,7561. 14s. lid., being 9,0311. 4s. 10d. more than in any former year. To the above must be added the sum of 993. 2s. 4d. for the Chinese New Testament Fund, making a grand total of 138,7491, 17s. 3d. The ordinary payments have amounted to 132,0941. 4s. 7d., and the payments on account of the Jubilee and Chinese New Testament Fands to 6,8901. 18s. 10d,; making the total expenditure of the year amount to 138,9S51. 3s. 5d. It was also stated in the report that the Bishops of London, Glocester and Bristol, and Ripon had accepted the office of vice-presidents of the society. In moving the adoption of the report the Bishop of London alluded to his appointment as one of the vicepresidents. It was a great satisfaction to him to be thus honoured. It would be a satisfaction to him under any chraumstanoes to receive such an honour at the hands of so large a body of Christans; but he hau a peculiar satisfaction for hilnself, and he wished to take that opportunity of publicly stating it, in being so honoured by a body which consisted of others than the members of the church of England. (Applause.) They were brought together continuaUy, as members of the church of ngland, labouring in their sphere day after day, but the occasions were not many in which they were able to meet their brother Christians of other bodies, to help them, as the latter had helped the church in the cause of Christ. (Applause.) They might, perhaps, from being confined to those who so perfectly agreed with themselves, be apt to magnify the points of difference between themselves and other For himself, it had been his happiness throughout life to be able to cooperate in many great and important works, in the smaller sphere in which he had laboured, with persons who had diflered from him most materiaUy. There were points of agreement which were far greater than their points of difference (applause); and, if there were nothing else to recommend the Bible Society to him as an individual, it would be that it gave him an opportunity of joining heart and hand with so many persons from whom otherwise he was much separated. (Applause.) The meeting was also addressed by the Bishop of Winchester, the Rev. Newman Hall, the Bon. and Rev. Baptist Noel, the Bishop of lupert's Laud, the 11v.

AN AxjvmNaOE IN A DRAW-WELL.-A short dfitance beyond Brandling-placs, and near to the Moor Edge, is a draw-well, about 35 feet deep, 3 feet 5 inches in diameter, with water to within about 8 feet of tbe top. On Sunday morning last a hat was found near the spot, and certain finger marks on the sides of the well indicated that a struggle for life and-death had very recently taken place. Atfirit it was whispered that a mau had been drowned in the old well, and eventually a vague rumnor to the effect reached the Prudhoe-steeet police-station. LongD oles and grappling irons were in immediate requisition, gut after some hours' labour the eearch was given up as hopeless, and the bystanders slowly and sorrowfully returned to their homes. And thus the matter rested, until a pitman belonging to 4Boaforth-row, named Wiliam Craven, haring heard that an unelaimed bat was lying at the stationhouse, came and ideutified it as bis property. He said that on Satuaday.evening he was g,6g home over the Moor intoxicated in company with some of his neighbours, and having quarrelled wth them he retrsed towards the town. He renembered nothing after that but having plumped very suddenly overhead into a deep hae full of water. On coming to the surf.ce he worked himsef clear of the water by means of his feet and shoulders, and while in this position le stated he fel asleep several times, but awoke on finding himself slipping down again. How he got into the well, how long ho re,ujained in the perilous situation in which he eted himself to have been placed, and Ios he t aMain, he was totally unable to remem:.er; but this he did reaollect, that he went over to Gateshead to some of his friends, wet, cold, and hungry, and minus his coat, hat, and two waistcoats.-.Vcwtcas5e Cleronidce.

"1In the preceding report you also saw that during 18555 we had subscribed for loAns Issued by dtielrent companies. That part of our operations has assumed this Year very considerable extension.

During the same period of the first nine mon-bs of the Year the average of that category of " Rerorts' was about 16,000.0O0 at each balf-monthly settlement. " We insist on this period of the first nino months of last year because It was fron that moment that, under the plessure of circetm. stances which It was difficult to command, the Bauk or Franre was compelled to take restrictive measues, which casDed in all credit relations such a perturbat:on that every cetabllihmcit, wbether public or private, was oompeUed to check its opertsisms. " The total amount of the " Reportsl effected by us In 1850 in I Reute and shares was ,03,000.100 of fratca. " It was at the moment wben we were using zucah efforts to facilitate a transition towards better times that a crisis broke out which. although it may be attributed to general causes, oertairny owed Its violence and Its rsapidity to the meaures which the two first establishments in Eumrpe were compelled to adopt under the empire ot the constitution wbhch governs them. ' Doubtless, the expenase of the war and the outlay caused by several years of scrcity ha& prepared thu elements of this crisis: but wo thin that It is possible to ward off the danzer of the state or thitgs by combining efforts unfortunately isolated and by supporting public contidenoe. " W mu!, oweer.be allowed to remark that at that moment theo Ordit MiobUier kept ita head to tt.e stOrm, and may justly claim the honour of having, by its energceUr and calm attitude, powerfully oontributed In reanimating oonfidenoeand in raining theprice of secuities of all kinds. "In those difficult moments. when everything became a cAuse of alarm for dbttrbed imaginations the bearing of the wants of the railwV e mpaule wu exaggerated, nd hesitation fas felt at the nocosaity of giving a Prompt And extensive satisfaction t theu,. These gat instrtnent of national prosperity almost became a pubilo embarraesment. "Under these Ircumr taces, not only did the Crfdit Mobiller non diminish the credits which itmade to these undertakings, but it Increased them. What is more It officially ofrered two thinMs-1. To gurchase with the coseration of several foreign houes, the Relntes eld hy the Back of Francs, sa as to be able to furnish to that establishment the means of effectually increasing Its metallic reserve, and to oontinue Its advrsoss on Rentes and railway shares: and, Z To provide for the wants of all the railway companies by subscribing to the amount of 304.050 000 of francs to tho losms which they had to issue for 1857. the Or-l.it Mobilier and it directos declaring that they were ready to cngage themselves personally in that loan to the amount of 200,000,000, it the sum of 100,000,000 were subscribed by the other banking houses. -Those two propositions remained without result, And the CrOdit 3lobiler being compelled to renounce the ideaof aonyunited meaCreg Was obliged to oonfine Itself to providing for the wants of such OOaDpauies as It was usually connected with. It had, bowever, formed a correct judgment of the situation of affairs, and the sole fact of its havingc made the propoaition doubtiees contnhuted not a little to aUay uneasmess, and show tbat persona were too prompt iu giving way to fale alama. "The crisi althoush warded off, had not the less bad for effect to reduce in a mraterial manuer ths profits on which our company thought it might calculate, thanks to the simple amrelioration of * redit. We think that the preceding statement will have sufflcen e Jsu6 fed the motlves which induced us to conine ourselves wita re- itncted scale aod to postpone the definitive reallratfon of the affairs which we had communicated to you lat year. For some of theee affairs the solutions are still entire. As far as regards that of the Transatlautic packets, with a view to which wehad constituted Ue Compagnie Maritime, we hope that it will be shortly settled In a manner sat factory to the Interest of all. "We think we have the lcore right not to remain unconnected with It. asin acoordance with the Compagns blaritime, in the name of which we claim a participation In this great undertaking, we have not hesitated to Impose on ourselves considerable sacrfices " Of our different projects of railways in Francs, that relaktive to the extenpion of the concesonios of the line from Grenoble to St. ktambert towards Lyons and Valence is the only one which hs been reaized by decree of the 18th of March, 1857. Tbe oompany only waits for the homologatlon of its new statutes, which are at this momont under examinatiou by the Council of State. -Continued sod reguar relations hare been established between our company and the fip;anish Ctedit Mobilier Company; that isUtito lion which, by the power It has reserved to ltself of entering into affair abroad, may caim a right to naturalirtton on our soil wil lend us a very useful co-ot'eratcon. It may render as, by Itg panicipatIon ia the affairs of our country, the support which we are dispoeed to give it for Frech frontier the Line w~lh is'b cb oounnect° all t'haoseo the Peinsulat to the Feench nes, is one of the first and one of the principal undertakings to wvhich thatsoopeny hasN devotedit t efforts. 8uch a work, which excites eqiual interest on both sides of the Pyrenese, must be accomplished Dy the onmbinedi strength of the two couiarles, anud will thus establis a fresh bend between the twvo inntitUirons. This raSiway will improve the manufactures and the commerce of our tsoothem provinces, as the lines of Belgiumu and Germany have energetically tended to derelope the prosperity oftour departments in the north and east ot Frenoee -The Spanish rasiwvsys vwilt brin6 to us the necessary raw materilah for our different brancebs of inuswtry, and also alimentary produoce tI ey vc 1 carry back In return our fas cy articles auna nor mna- factinve, From the nature of the service which they are called on to penuor they are destined to a prosperity sO much the greater, anthey wrill succeed to an extremely Imperfect apstcum of communIcatIon, and will hava to provide for all the wants of transport wsithout having atutbing to featr from the competition of the present roads. " To sum up. Gentiemee, It ist very easy for you, from the above statement, to see that finig the lset ear the total capital whISch we l ave been abletodispose of has been devoied to esffaire of creat natIonal interest, and of the most uaeful, If not of the moast brilltnt nature. hforeover, in order to take an efficacious part in the great tnudertsklnm5 of the country, It Is nut necessary to incessantly ce-operate in -toe f6rmatlon of newe affairs.

" t was withthis view-It; was for this object-that, neawly two yeam ago, we thought of doubling our capital. as the Government now csila au the Bs.k o 'a of ds and asattdid In principlel12months ago for the np,count Bankr. " In order to double the capital of the Credfit NGMoblr two modes mlghtbeadotaed. The numberof the sbaesmintlbteincreasedtor bonda reimbursable aLa long11 periOdmt6ghtbe Issued. BdWescothssetwc plans we chose the latter, becamse it had the advantage of placing at our dispDsta theseineresurceswithouttsncreasing the amssof aecer ties of a variable revenue, and which for that ressonhare a cbhasates essetialy eventual. What was then neeessary. and what is istlt mnore go at the present time, Is to diminish the quantity of floating securities, whether Bentes or sbaree, which encumber the mnarket, weigh on the prices at every liquidation, and thus neoessarijy increase the rates for continuations, and coDnsequently augment the rate cf Interest In all commerctal or Industilalsslatlous. Thence whichx we can constantly make of the Capital arisin from cur bonds allows, us to devote to them a remunerating Interest which has nothing eventual in It. "We snay, gentlemen, lay claim to the honour of having introducet the system of the simultaneous employment of bonds and ahaies In the oconst,tutioa of the capital of the great railway oempsnle-a6 ITye tem the dtvelopement of which has so powerfully coDntrbute t3 the compiet!on of our public works. "Before 184 no other moans was understood for getting togvtbter the capital necessary for ldudstris companes than thalt of, the Issue of aoertsin n,,mber of Shares. If some companies were induced to raise loans It was ontly by exceptioni, and InL order to remedy the in. sufficiency of their calculations: but no one bad the Idea at the orilcn of the companies of diriding the capital necesrary for their formation into shares and bonds As, therefore, It is admitted that In ind"se the risk of loss is compensated for by the hope of gaining p~r tionally high dividends, and asat thecriodwe allude to the bul=tn seaulIewhich hare sincebhorn attained bythe railways werenot known tbe greater partof those immencse works which have omuch incrased hav been Indefintely retarded if it ad ben eoesaxyto secure to the iv ole of the capital thediai which itelaimned, or at leas%t the Government would have be." sompetled to conztribute to their execution by large subeeslons "The same Idlea which guided us when we advised the creation of bonds which have sbcued the prosperity of our raiways led us to apply the sante system wheuwe preparedthe constitution of the Crldit blobilleir. " It is certan that In spite of the Increased value of all railway sihares the developemront of the produce of those gret undertakingsi and the regular rednAton In the Interest of capital mStvll lead to a fresh Improvement in the value of those securities. It is salsocertgai that the revenue derived fromthem is higher thAn lw t w oberr'as to the inceaseed value of railway htbaq equall? applies to the public (nods, which, In additon to the 'fAcial nlecessities created by the war and the scarcity, must see their gW-1 inse int proportion to the diminution in the rate of interest " It Is therefore evident that a prudent and oppoctune cooversSm ofthse eeerittiesinto brds of the Crldit Mobix-ermust lead, e.ithe in the revenue or the amelioratlcn of the capital, to censideraUe Pved, And what Is v irthy of remark Is that it in vredaey In mnoments of crisis tht this movement; of conversion might acquiem tha Vevlese activity, and consequently increased utility, because it Is then ilia. a preferenceis felt for inventin3gata fied Intertetr#Aber thaninunzer. tald infuezod byspeculation. "eilseuo(f raway bonds checkshin aceirtain degree the rise In the price of Rentos, and therefore the more Anxiety the public ehoan to purebee those secarities the more Is It scught to restrain the creation of them. This tendency, perkaps, arises from the eftect being taken for the clause, In fact, when we Coolly examine the iuto which ear;e birth to the creatioan of bonds. it mitut be admitted thatI a siven mass sf capital being nece-sary to complete the works under. taken, or to awsry out those called for by the country, it was Indispeo. sable to find it somewhere that being the cate, there waa no othker altemnatlvethan to creakte bonds or shares. It isa matter of doubt to us wrhether the injury to the public funds -aould have been less disastrous it the latter mode had been chosen.

I THE OTHER SIDE Op THE PICTURE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your able leading article on the painful subje&brought before the noticoe of the public by "AL B. B.,'you tell some wholesome truths on the side of the question. relating to women. There is a side no ls important re.- lating to men, on which I shall be thankful if you wM4 allowr me the opportunity of saying a few words. The laws which society imposes in the present day in. respect of marriage upon young men belonging to themiddle class are in the highest degree unnatural, and arethe real cause of most of our social corruptions. The father of a family has in many instanou risen from a comparatively humble origin to a position of easy comre. tenoe. Hs wife has her crriage; he ascociates with men. of wealth grter than bis own. His sonzreabch the age' when, in the natural course of things, they ought to many and eatablish a home for themselves. It would seem no great hardship that a young couple should begin on the same level as their parents began, and be content for therfirt few years with the mere necesuries of life; and thre are thousands who, were it not for society, would gladly mzrnw on such terms. But here the tyrant world inzterpose; the son must not marry until he can maintan an, esablishment on much the ame footing as his father's. If he dare to set the lair at defiance his family lose caste, and ha and his wife are quietly dropt out of the circle in whici they have hitherto moved. All that society will allowis. an apgement, andthenwehavethes d butfamiliarsight. of two young lovers wearing out their beet yeas with hesrta 2A.a wi hope long deferred; often, after all, ending in d p , or in the shattered health of the poor girL, ==alAAto bast up against the harasseg anxiety. Orevm hem a l.-g engagement does finally end in mariage, how &= : are the chances of happiness ! The union. wbich, if aawe at first, would have proved happy under worldly di!E=hy, has lost its brightness when postponed until middle life, even with competence and a carriages Perhaps the e3rly sruggles would have only strengthene& the bondsof affection; buthere I feel that Iam ondangerous ground. Already I hear society loudly exclaiming that I am. advocating improvident marriage6, that I would flood the country with genteel paupers, that I am advising what is contray to the best interests of society. But stop awhile, society. Your picture of marriages a- 35, with a Belgravian house for the happy couple, a footman. in splendid uniform, and at least a brougham, is very pleasing; butthere is areverseto thecanvass, andthatavery dark one. How has the bridegroom been living since he attained bis manhood ? I believe that there are very manyyoung men who are keeping themselves pure amid all thetemptations of London life. God's blessing be with them for they are the salt of our corrupt city. But I know that there are thousands who are living in sin, chiefly in consequence of the impoesibility (as the world says) of theirmarrying. Some go quietly with the stream, and do as others do around them, almost without a thought of the misery they are causing and the curse they are laying up for themselves. But many, perhaps most of them, are wretched under the convictions of their conscienoe. Living in the midst of temptation, they have not sufficient principle to resist its fascination, and although they know where God intends that they shall find their safety, yet they dare not offend their family, alienate their friends, and lose theirsocial position by making what the world calls an impmdent marriage. The very feeling which Heaven has given as a chief purifier of man's nature is darkening their consdenoe and hardening their heaH, because the lawof sodetycontradicts the law of God. I might touch upon even a more terrible result of the present state of things-medicsr men and clergymen will understand what I mean,-but I dare not, and I have said enough. I must in Eadness confess that in the face of the powerful' tyranny of sodal law in this country it is difficult to suggestany general remedy for this evil. But the mischief is on. the increase with our increasing worship of money, and publio attention ought to be appealed to on the subject. If our American eulogist be right in commending " pluci" asw orp e of our distinctive characteristics, it is not our young men who should ltak the quality. If they will shake off the affectations of club life, and claim a position in society for themselves and for their wives, because they are qualifieT for it by education and character, and not merely because they represent so much money, they will soon force the world to give way, and strike down one of the greatesthindrances to their owrn happiness, both temporal ant eternal. It will not in general be difficult to bring the daughtersover to the ssme opinion. Mothersand dstersare seldom y hardhearted in such cases, and by united efforts the stern father may ba induced to give his blessing, even. tbQ'ugh tho happy oouple (aye, happy, let the world sneera, It will) haw to begin on little more than the proverbial hr'ad and cheese. Th6 reognaition of this principle would do much to check somo a oiur moct deadly social evils. It would make many a girl whomi tho tyranny of the world now dooms to a joylsosaelibacy a happy wife and mother, It would raise the tone of chacter of our young men, bringing out intohealtSful exercise the home afections,which are now deniedt them, at the very time of life when their influence is msod; beneficial. It would drive away all frivolityandeffenminacy before the realities of steady work, which early marri&Mg would oblige them to face It would purify our streets, adcheck many a bitter pang of conscience, and save many a souL We are experiencing the bitter fruits of mads lawlet us see whether God's law w1il not work better.
