Buddhist Pilgrims.*
BUDDHIST PILGRIMS.*
Mf. Stainlas Julien has commenced the publication of a work entitled " Les P Uerins Bouddhists` 1I he first volume, published in the year 1853, cont, ns the biography of Eiouen-thsang, who, in the mniddle of the 7th century A.D., travelled from ( ihina through Central Asia to India. The second, Y liich hasjust reached us, gives us the first portion of
tiouen-thsang's owadiary. There arenot manybooks c i iravel which can be compared with these volumes.
:licuen-thsang passed through countries which few l,. d visited before him. He describes some parts of ts.e world which no one has explored since, and wbere even our modern maps contain hardly more iban the ingenious conjectures of Alexander von £umboldt. Ris observations are minute; his geographical, statistical, and historical remarks most accurate and trustworthy. The chief object of his jravels was to study the religion of Buddha, the great reformer of India. Some Chinese pilgrims visited India before, several after, his time. Yiouenthsang, however, is considered by the Chinese thei - nelves as the most distinguished of these pilgrims, and M. Stanislas *Julien has rightly assigned to himn the first place in his collection.
In order to understand what Hiouen-thsang was, and to appreciate his life and his labours we must first cast a gLance at the history of the reiigion which, however unattractive and even repulsive it may appear to ourselves, inspired her votary with the true spirit of devotion and self-sacrifice. That religion has now existed for about 2,400 years. To millions and millions of human beings it hls been the only preparation for a higher life placed within their reachl. And even at the present day it counts among the hordes of Asia a more numerous airay of believers than any other faith, not excluding Mohanimedanism or Christianity. The religion of Buddha took its origin in India about the mniddle of the sixth century B.C., but it did not art umnie its politicul importance till about the time of Alexander's invasion. We knowvlittle, therefore, of
lts first origin and spreading, because the canonical 'vorks on which we must rely for information belong to a much later period, and are strongly tinged with a legendary character. The very existence of such a being as Buddha, the son of Suddhodana, King of Kapilavastu, has been doubted. But what can never be doubted is this, that Buddhism, such as we know it in Russia and Sweden on the very threshold of European civilization, in the north of Asia, in Mougolia, Tatary, China, Thibet, Siam, B3uniah, and Ceylon, had its origin in India. Doctrines similar to those of Buddha existed in that country long before his time, We can trace them
flke meandering roots below the surface long before we reach the point wshere the roots strike up into a etemn, and the stem branches off again into fruitbearing branches. What was original and new in :Buddha was his changing a philosophical system into a practical doctrine; his taking the wisdom of the fewv, and coining as much of it as he thought genuine for the benefit of the many; his breaking with the traditional formalities of the past, and proclaiming for the first time, in spite of castes and creeds, the equality of the rich and the poor, the foolish and the wise, the twice-born and the outcast. Buddhism, as a religion and as a political fact, was a reaction against Ilrabmanism, though it retained mruch of that more primitive form of faith and worship. Buddhism, in its historical growth, presupposes Brahnmanism, and, however hostile the mutual relation of these two religions may have been at different periods of Indian history, it can be shown withut much difficulty that the latter was but a natural consequence of the former.
Brahmanism had started, like the religion of the Greeks, the Romans, the Germans, Slaves, and Celts, wvith a simple and intelligible mythological phrascology. In the Veda, for there is but one real V'eda, the names of all the so-called gods or Devas betray their original physical character and meaniing without disguise. The fire ras praised and invoked by the name of Agni (ignis); the earth by the name of Prithvi (the broad); the sky by the name of Dijaqts (Jupiter), and afterwards of indra: the firmament and the waters by the name of Varuma (Obpavog). The sun was invoked by miany names, Buch as A54iryea, Sai&ti, Vishnu, or illitra; and the dawn rejoiced in the titles of Ushas, Usrvasi, Alianat, and 8drya. Nor was the moon forgotten. For though it is mentioned but rarely under its usual name of t7andra, it is alluded to under the more sacred appellation of &ma; and each of its four phases had received its own denomination. There is hardly any part of nature, if it could impress the human mind in any way with the Ideas of a higher power, of order, eternity, or beneficence, whether the winds, or the rivers, or the trees, or the mountains, without a name and representative in the early Hindoo Pantheon. No doubt there existed in the human mind from the very beginning something, whether we call it a suspicionI, an innate idea, an intuition, or a sense of the Divine power. lVhat distinguishes man from the rest of the animal creation is chiefly that ineradicable feeling- of dependence and reliance upon sone higher power, a consciousness of bondage from 'wbiwh the very name of " religion" was derived. " lt is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves." The presence of that power was felt everywhere, and nowhere more clearly and stron(gly than in the rising and setting of the sun, in the change of day and night, of sprinu and winter, of birth and death. Btut, although the Divine presence was felt everywhere, it was impossible in that early period of thought, and with a language incapable as yet of expressing anything ibut material objects, to conceive the idea of God in its purity and fulniess, or to assign to it an adequate and worthy expression. Children cannot think the thoughts of men, and the poets of the Veda could mot speak the language of Aristotle. It was by a slow process that the human mind elaborated the idea of one absolute and supreme GodLead; and by a still slower process that the liumau language matured a word to express that idea. A period of growth was inevitable, and those who, from a mere guess of their own do not hesitate to speak authoritatively of a primeval revelation which imparted to the pagan world the idea of the Godhead in all its purity forget that, however pure, and sublime, and spintual that revelation might have been, there was no language capable as yet of expressing the high and immaterial conceptions of that Heaven-sent message. The real history of religion during the earliest mythological period represents to us a slow process of fermentation in thought and language, with its various interruptions, its overf'owings, its coolings, its deposits, and its gradual clearing from all extra3aeousaud foreign admixture. This is not only the case in India, in Greece, and in Germany. In Peru, and wher ever the primitive formations of the intellectual world crop out, the process is exactly the same. " The religion of the sun," as it has been boldly said by the author of the Spanish Comgust in America, '' Mas inevitable." It was like a deep furrow which that heavenly luminary drew, in its silent procession from east to west, over the fallow mind of the gazing multitude, and in the impression left there by the first rising and setting of the sun there lay the dark seed of a faith in a more than human being, the first intimation of a life without beginning. of a world without end. Manifold seed fell after: wards into the soil once broken. Somethlng divine
was discovered in everything that moved and lived. Nanies were stammered forth in anxious haste, and no single name could fully express what lay hidden in
the human mind and wanted expression,-the idea of an absolute, and perfect, and supreme, and immortal
Being. Thus a countless host of so-called gods was called into being. and for a time seemed to satisfy the wants of a thoughtless multitude. But there were thoughtful men at all times, and their reason protested against the contradictions of a mythological phraseology, though it had been hallowed by
sacred customs and traditions. That rebellious reason had been at work from the very first, always ready to break the yoke of names and formulas
which no longer expressed what they were intended to express. The idea which had yearned for utterance was the idea of a supreme and absolute :Power, and that yearning was not satisfied by such names as Kronos, Zeus, and Apollon. The very sound of such a word as "God," used in the plural, jarred on the ear, as if we were to speak of two
nriverses or of a single twin. There are many words, as Greek and Latin grammarians tell us, which, if used in the plural, have a different meaning from whatthey have in the singular. The
Latin a'des means a temple; if used in the plural it mean a house, Deus and Esdc ought to be added to the same class of words. The idea of supreme perfecticn excluded limitation, and the idea of God excluded the possibility of many gods. This may seem language too abstract and metaphysical for the early times of which we are speaking. But the ancient poets of the Vedic hymns have expressed the same thought with perfect clearness and simplicity. In the Rig-Yeda ], 164, 46, we read:-
That which is one the sages speak of in many waysthey call it Agni, Yasm, Matarivan."
and again, Rig-Veda, X:., 121-

Besides the plurality of gods, -which was sure to lead to their destruction, there was a taint of mortality which they could not throw off. They all derived their being from the life of nature. The god who represented the sun was liable, in the mythological language of antiquity, to all the accidents which threatened the solar luminary. Though be might rise in immortal youth in the morning, he was conquered by the shadows of the night, and the powers of winter seemed to overthrow his heavenly throne. There is nothing in nature free from change, and the gods of nature fell under the thraldom of nature's laws. There must be one God, there must be one unchanging Deity. This was the silent conviction of the human mind. There are many gods, liable to all the vicissitudes of life; this was the answer of mythological religion.
It is curious to observe in how various ways these two opposite principles were kept for a time from open conflict, and how long the heathen temples resisted the enemy which was slowly and imperceptibly undermining their very foundations. In Greece this mortal element, inherent in all gods, was eliminated to a great extent by the conception of heroes. Whatever was too human in the ancient legends told of Zeus and Apollon was transferred to socalled half-gods or heroes, who were represented as the sons or favourites of the gods, whose fate they bore under a slightly altered namne. The twofold character of Hercules as a god and as a hero is acknowledged even by Herodotus, and some of his epithets would have been sufficient to indicate his solar and originally divine character. But, in order to make some of the legends told of the solar deity possible or conceivable, it was necessary to represent Hercules as a more human being, and to make him rise to the seat of the Immortals only after he had endured the toils and sufferings incompatible with the dignity of an Olympian god. We find the same idea in Peru, only thatthere it ledto differentresults. A thinking, or, as he was called, a freethinking,Inca* remarked that this perpetual travelling of the sun was a sign of servitude, and he threw doubts upon the divine nature of suchanunquietthingasthat great luminary appeared to him to be. And this misgiving led to a tradition which, even should itbeunfounded in history, had some truth in itself, that there was in Peru an earlier worship-that of an invisible Deity, the Creator of the world,-Pachacamac. In Greece, also, there are signs of a similar craving after the " Unknown God." Asupreme God was wanted, and Zeus, the stripling of Creta, was raised to that rank. He became god above all gods-&,rc6rwv ztos, as Pindar calls hin. Yet more was wanted than a mere Zeus; and thus a supreme Fate or Spell was imagined before which all the gods, and even Zeus, had to bow. The most awful solution, however, of the problem belongs to Teutonic mythology. Here, also, some heroes were introduced, but their death was only the beginning of the final catastrophe. " All gods must die." Such is the last word of that religion which had grown up in the forests of Germany, and found a last refuge among the glaciers and volcanoes of Iceland. The death of Sigurd, the descendant of Odin, could not avert the death of Balder the son of Odin; and the death of Balder was soon to be followed by the death of Odin himself, and of all the immortal gods,
All this was inevitable, and Prometheus, the man of forethought, could safely predict the fall of Zeus. The struggles by which reason and faith overthrow tradition and superstition vary in different countries and at different times; but the final victory is always on their side. In India the same antagonism manifested itself, but what there seemed at first a victory of reason turned out to be a most disastrous defeat. At first there was hardly a struggle. On the primitive mythological stratum of thought two new formations arose--the Brahmanical philosophy and the Brahmanical ceremonial; the one opening all avenues to philosophical thought, the other fencing all religious feeling within the narrowest barriers. Both derived their authority from the same source. Both professed to carry out ,he meaning and purpose of the Veda. Thus we see, on the one side, the growth of a numerous and powerful priesthood, and the establishment of a ceremonial whichl embraced every moment of a man's life from his birth to his death. There was )io event which might have moved the heart to a spontaneous outpouring of praise or thanksgivina which was not regutlated by priestly formulas. Every prayer was prescribed, everv sacrifice determined. Every god had his share, and the claims of each deity on the adoration of the faithful were set down with such punctiliousness, the danger of offending their pride was represented with such vivid colours, that no one would venture to approach their presence without the assistance of a well-paid staff of masters of divine ceremonies. It was impossible to avoid sin without the help of the Brahmans. They alone knew the food that might properly be eaten, the air which might properly be breathed, the dress which might properly be worn. They alone could tell what god should be invoked, what sacrificebe offered, and the slightest mistake of pronunciation, the slightest neglect about clariHied butter, or the length of the ladle in which it was to be offered, might
bring destruction upon the head of the unassisted I worshipper. No nation was ever so completely I priestridden as the Hindoos under the sway of the brahmnanic law. Yet, on the other side, the same people were allowed to indulge in the most unrestrained freedom of thought, and in the schools of their philosophy the very names of their
gods were never mentioned. Their existence was neither denied nor asserted; they were of no greater importancein the system of the world of thoughtthan trees or mountains, men or animals; and to offer sacrifices to them with a hope of rewards, so far from being meritorious, was considered as dangerous to that emancipation to which a clear perception of philosophical truth was to lead the patient student. There was one system which taught that there:
existed but one Being, without a second ; that' everything else which seemed to exist was but a dream and illusion, and that this illusion might be removed by a true knowledge of the one Being. There was another system which admitted two principles-one a subjective and self-existent mind, the other matter, endowed with qualities. Hlere the world, with its joys and sorrows, was explained as the result of the subjective self, reflecting itself in the mirror of matter; and final emancipation was obtained by turning away the eyes from the play of nature, and being absorbed in the knowledge of the true andabsolute self. A third system started withthe admission of atoms, and explained every effect, including the elements and the mind, animals, men,
and gods, from the concurrence of these atoms. In fact, as M. Cousin remarked many years ago, the history of the philosophy of India is " un abreg6 de l'histoire enti6re de la philosophie." The germs of all these systems were traced back to the Veedas, Br&hmanas, and the Upanishads, and the man who believed in any of them was considered as
orthodox as the devout worshipper of Agni-the one 'was saved by knowledge and faith, the other by works and faith.
Such was the state of the Hindoo mind when Buddhism arose; or, rather, such was the state of the Hindoo mind which gave rise to Buddhism. Buddha himself went through the school of the Brahmans. He performed their penances, he studied their philosophy, and he at last claimed the name of the Buddha, or theEalightened, whenhe threw away the whole ceremonial, with its sacrifices, superstitions, penances, and castes, as worthles3, and changed the complicated systems of philosophy into a short doctrine of salvation. This doctrine of salvation has been caUed pure Atheism and Nihilism, and it no doubt was liable to both charges in its metaphysical portions, and in that form in which we chiefly k;now it. It was Atheistic, not because it denied the existence of such gods as Indra and Brahma. Buddha did not even condescend to deny their existence. But it was Atheistic, like the Sankhya philosophy, which admitted but one subjective self, and considered creation as an ilusion of that self, imaging itself for a while in the mirror of nature. As there was no reality in creation, there could be no real Creator. All that seamed to exist was the result of ignorance. To remove that ignorance was to remove the cause of aU that seemed to exist. How a religion which taught the annihilation of all existence, of all thought, of aU individuality and personality, as the highest object of anl endeavours, could have laid hold of the minds of millions of human beings, and how at the same time, by enforcing the duties of morality, justice, kindness, and self-sacrifice, it could have exercised a decidedly beneficial influence, not only on the natives of India, but on the lowest barbarians of Central Asia, is one of the riddles which no philosophy has yet been able to solve. The morality which it teaches is not a morality of expediency and rewards. Virtue is not enjoined because it necessarily lea, to happiness. No; virtue isto be practised, but happiness is to be shunned, and the only reward for virtue is that it subdues the passions, and thus prepares the human mind for that knowledge which is to end in complete annihilation. There are ten commandments whichBuddha imposes on his disciples. They are-not to kill, not to steal. not to commit adultery, not to lie, not to get intoxicated, to abstain from unseasonable meals, to abstain from public spectacles, to abstain from expensive dresses, not to have a large bed, not to receive silver or gold. The duties of those who embraced a religious life were more severe. They were not allowed to wear any dress except rags collected in cemeteries, and these rags they had to sew together with their own hands; a yellow cloak was to be thrown over these rags. Their food was to be extremely simple, and they were not to possess anything, except what they could get by collecting alms from door to door in their wooden bowl. They had but one meal in the morning, and were not allowed to touch any food after midday. They were to live in forests, not in cities, and their only shelter was to be the shadow of a tree. There they were to sit, to spread their carpet, but not to lie down even during sleep. They were allowed to enter the nearest city or village in order to beg, but they had to return to their forest before night, and the only change which was allowed, or rather prescribed, was when they hadto spend some nights m the cemeteries, there to meditate on the vanity of all things. And what was the object of all this asceticism? Simply to guide each individual toward that path which would finally bring him to Nirvina, to utter extinction or annihilation. Theverydefinitionof virtue was thatit belped man to cross over to the other shore, and that other shore was not death, but cessation of all being. Thus charity was considered a virtue; modesty, patience, courage, contemplation, and science, all were virtues, but they were practised only as means of arriving at deliverance. Buddha himself exhibited the perfection of all these virtues. His charity knew no bounds. When he saw a tigress starved, and unable to feed her cubs, he made a oharitable oblation of his body to be devoured by them. Hiouenthsang visited the place on the banks of the Indus where this miracle was supposed to have happened, and he remarks that the soil is still red there from the blood of Buddha, and that the trees and flowers have the same colour. As to the modesty of Buddha nothing could exceed it. One day King Prasenajit, the protector of Buddha, called on him to perform miracle in order to silence his adversaries, the Brahrnans. Buddha consented. He performed the required miracles; but he exclaimed, " Great Kinge, 1do not teach the law to my pupils, telling them, Go, ye saints, and before the eyes of the Brahmans and householders perform, by means of your supernatural powers, miracles greater than any man can perform. I tel thenm, when I teach them the law, Live, ye saints, hiding your good works and showing your sins." And yet, al this self-sacrificing charity, all this self-sacrificing humility, by which the life of Buddha was distinguished throughout, and which he preached to the multitudes that came to listen to him, had but one object, and that object was final annihilation. Itis impossible almost to believe it, and yetwhen we turn away our eyes from thepleasing picture of that high morality which Buddha preached for the first time to all classes of men, and look into the dark pages of his code of religious metaphysics, we find no other explanation. Fortunately, the millions who embraced the doctrine of Buddha, and were saved by it from the depths of barbarism,brutality, and selfishness, were unable to fathom the meaning of his metaphysicaldoctrines. With them the Nirvfna, to which they aspired, became only a relative deliverance from the miseries of human life ; nay, it took the bright colours of a Paradise, to be regained by the pious worshipper of Buddha. But was this the meaning of Buddha himself ? In his " FourVerities" he does not, indeed, define Nirvina, except by cessation of all pain; but when he traces the cause of pain, and teaches the means of destroying not only pain itself, but the cause of pain, we shall see that his Nirvina assumes a very different meaning. Hfis " Four Verities" are very simple. The first asserts the existence of pain; the second asserts that the cause of pain lies in sin; the third asserts that pain may cease again by Nirviua; the fourth shows the way that leads to Nirvana. This way to Nirv&na consists in eight things-right faith (orthodoxy), right judgment (logic), right language (veracity), right purpose (honesty), right practice (religious life), right obedience (lawful life), right memory, and right meditation. All these precepts might be understood as part of a simply moral code, closing with a kind of mystic meditation on the highest object of thought, and with a yearning after deliverance from all worldly ties. Similar systems have prevailed in many parts of the world, without denying the existence of an absolute Being, or of a something towards which the human mind tends, in which it is absorbed or even annihilated. Awful as such a mysticism may appear, yet it leaves still something that exists, it acknowledges a feeling of dependence in rman. It knows of a first caise, though it may have nothing to predicate of it except that it is T6 ,ILVOeV iKav77r6v. A return is possible from that desert. The first cause may be called to life again. It may takethe names of Creator, Preserver,Ruler, and when the simplicity and helplessness of the child have re-entered the heart of man the name of father will come back to the lips which had uttered in vain all
tme mames of a philosophical despair. But from the NirvIna of the Buddhist metaphysician there is no returm He starts fromthe ideathat the highest object is to escape pain. Life in his eyes is nothing but misery; birth the cause of all evil, from which even death cannot deliver him, because he believes in an eternal cycle of existence, or in transnigration. There is no deliverance from evil, except by breaking through the prison walls, not only of life, but of existence ; and by extirpating the cause of existence. What, then, is the cause of existence? The cause of existence, says the Buddhist metaphysician, is attachment-an inclination towards something, and this attachment arises from thirst or desire. Desire presuipposes perception of the object desired; perception presupposes contact; conxtact, at least a sentient contact, presupposes the senses, and, as the senses can only perceive what has form and name, or what is distinct, distinction is the real cause of all the effects which end in existence, birth, and pain. Now, this distinction is itself the result of conceptions or ideas; bat these ideas, so iar from being, as in Greek philosophy, the true and everlasting forms of the absolute, are themselves mere illuions, the effects of ignorance (avidyt). Ignorance, therefore, is really the primary cause of all that zeems to exist. To know that ignorance, as the root of all evil, is the same as to deatroy it, and with it all effects that flowed from it. In order to see how this doctrine affects the individual, let us watch the last moments of Buddha. He enters into the first stage of meditation when he feels freedom from sin, Ecquire a knowledge of the nature of all things, and

bas no desire except that of Nirv&na. But he still feels pleasure,-he even uses his reasoning and discrimninating powers. The use of these powers ceases in the second stage of meditation, -when nothing remains but a desire after Nlrv&na, and a general feeling of satisfaction, arising from his intellectual perfection. That satisfaction, also, is extinguished in the third stage. Indifference succeeds; yet there iS still self-consciousness, and a certain amount of physical pleasure. These last remnants are destroyed in the fourth stage; memory fades away, allpleasure and pain are gone, and the doors of Nirvana now open before him. After having passed these four stages once Buddha went through them a second time, but he died before he attained again to the fourth stage. We must soar still higher, and though we may feel giddy and disgusted we must sit out the tragedy till the curtain falls. After the four stages of meditation are passed, the Buddha (and every being is to become a Buddha) enters into the infinity of apace; then into the infinity of intelligence; and thence he passes into the region of nothing. But even here there is no rest. There is stil something left-the idea of the nothing in which he rejoices. That also must be destroyed, and it is destroyed in the fourth and last region, where there is not even the idea of a nothing left, and where there is complete rest, undisturbed by nothing, or what is not nothing. There are few persons who will take the trouble of reasoning out such hallucinations; least of all, persons who are accustomed to the sober language of Greek philosophy, and it is the more interesting to hear the opinion which one of the best Aristotelian scholars of the present day, after a patient examination of the authentic documents of Buddhism, has lormed of its system of metaphysics. x Barth6l6my SaintHilsire, in a review published in the Journal des Savants, says
"Buddhisr has no God- it has not even the confused aid vague notion of a Universai Spirit in which the human soul, according to the orthodox doctrine of Brahmnuism, and the &5khya philosophy, may be absorbed. nor does it admit nature, in the proper sense of the word, and it ignores that profound di¶ison between spirit and matter which forms the system and the gory of Kpila. It confounds man with all that surrounds Ium, all the while preaching to him the haws of virtue. Buddhism, therefore, cannot umte the human soul, which it does not even mention, with a God, whom it igores; nor with natnre, which it does not know better. Nothing remained but to annihilate the soul; and in order to be quite sure that the soul may not reappear under some new form in this world, Which has been cursed as the abode of illusion and misery, Buddhism destroys its very elements, and never gets tired of glorying in this achievement. What more is wanted? If this is not the absolute nothing, what is NirvAtal"
Such religion, we should say, was made for a madhouse. But Buddhism was an advance, if compared with Brahlmanism; it has stood its ground for centuries, and if truth could be decided by majorities the show of hands at the present day would be in favour of Buddha. The metaphysics of Buddhisn, lie the metaphysics of most religions, not excluding our own Gnosticism and Mysticism, were beyond the reach of all, except a few hardened philosophers or ecstatic dreamers. Human nature could not be changed. Out of the very nothing it mnade a new Paradise; and he who had left no place in the whole universe for a divine Being was deified himself by the multitudes who wanted a person whom they could worship, a friend before whom they could pour out their most secret griefs, a King whose help they might invoke. And there remained the code of a pure morality, proclaimed by Buddha. There remained the spirit of charity, 'indness, and universal pity with which he had inspired his disciples. There remained the simplicity of the ceremonial he had taught, the equality of all men which he had declared, the religious toleration which he had preached from the beginning. There remained much, therefore, to account for the rapid strides which his doctrine made from Ceylon to the Tundras of the Samoyedes, and we shall see in the simple story of the life of Eiouen-thsang that Buddhism, with all its defects, has had its heroes, its martyrs, and its saints.

TIPPERAIY BAiNK LiTGATION.
From the nature of an application made yesterday in the Court of Exchequer it would appear that the prospects of the creditors of the Sadleir bank swindle are even less cheering than they were a few months since. Counsel applied on behalf of the plaintiff, Mr. Patrick Mulqueny, a creditor of the 'ipperary Bank, for liberty to issue writs of scire facias on the judgment obtained by the plaintiff against Mr. M'Dowell, as official manager under the Winding-up Acts. The amount of the plaintiff's claim was 3721. Plaintiff's attorney had made an affidavit that there was no prospect of any further dividend becoming payable than that of 2s. in the pound, already paid; and that questions as to whether the official manager had aay power to enforce payment of the debts due to the bank, or of the calls made by him on the contributories, were now pending in the Court of Common Pleas and other courts. Counsel applied for the conditional order as against Messrs. James Sadleir, James Scully, Vincent Scully, and John Bennett. The Court granted a conditional order, and allowed one month for service of it in consequence of all the parties against whom the application was made, save Mr. Vincent Scully, residing out of the jurisdiction of the Court. In the Court of Queen's Bench, on the same day, counsel moved on the part of the public officer of the Newcastle Bank that the pleas filed by James Sadleir to a WIit of scirefacias should be set aside with costs. The plaintiff had recently obtained a verdict for 25,0001., and judgment upon that verdict against the official manager of the Tipperary bank pro formd, and forthwith proceeded to enfore the operation of the judgment against certain parties, among the rest James Sadleir. On the 17th of February a scire facias issued against Sadleir, in whose behalf two defences, wholly untenable, were filed without the leave of a Judge or the Court. The defences sought to raise the question, whether the Banking Act forbade the applieation of the 6th of George IV. to the ease, and the additional question, whether or not James Sadleir was a member of the Tipperary Banking Company? The defence denied that he was a member of the Tipperary Banking Company, and raising thus a question of law as to the application of the 6th of George IV. to the case, and of fact as to membership; and both defences being pleaded without leave, should be regarded as embarrassing and intended only for delay, and therefore be set aside, with costs. The Court finally gave liberty to the defendant to amnend the defences, he paying the costs of the motion.

A CUNNING CAT.-One day the cook in a monastery, when he laid the dinner, found one brother's portion of meat missing. He supposed that he had miscalculated, made good the deficiency, and thought of it no more til the next day, when he had again too little at dinner-time by one monk's comnmons. He suspected knavery, and resolved to watch for the thief. On the third day he was quite sure that he had his meat cut into the right number of portions, and was about to dish up, when he was called off by a ring at the outer gate. When he came back there was aainamonk's allowance gone. Next day he againpaid specialheed to his calculations, and, when he was on the point of dirhigup, again there was a ring at the gate to araw him from the kitchen. He 'went no further than the eutside of the kitchen door, when saw that the cat jumped in at the window, and was out again in an instant with a piece of meat. Another day's watching showed that it was the cat also who by leaping up atit, set the bellringing with her paws, and thus having, as she supposed, pulled the cook out of the kitchen, made the coast clear for her own piraUcal proceedings, The monks then settled it In conclave that the cat should be left thus to earn for the remainder of her days doublo rat1ons while they spread abroad the story of her cunning.

Great Exhibition Of Art Treasures.
GREAT EXEIBITION OF ART TREASUREL,.
(FROM OU OWN COR3EsPOWD3ENT
MANCHESTER, APRMn 15.
Mr. Creswick, R.A., h coDme down from London to assist Mr. Egg in arranging the pictures of living artists. The work is one of great difficulty and delicacy, and it is not surprising that Mr. Ego' should wish the labour and responsibility to be shared by another. Great progress is being made in every department of the Exhibition. Contributions arrive daily in large numbers. The officialr, however, do not seem to be overwhelmed by them, and are confident that everything will be ready for he opening on the 5th proximo. The members of the executive committee spend the whole of every day in the building, and appear to go through an amount of work which is perfectly astonishing, considering that it is entirely gratuitous. The public, too, are beginning to take increased interest
vinthe progress of the undertaking, which they evince by assembling in groups opposite the principal entrance, and gazing curiously at every box and package that arrives
The general museum of art will be arranged in cases similar to thosa used at Marlborough-house, and exhibited in the great central hall extending fromthe main entrance to the trausept. It is intended toillustrate thevarious epochs of ornamental art from the Anglo-Saxon period to the present day, and will consist of specimens of every kind of manufacture to which decoration has been applied. It is especially rich in articles belonging to the Medi£eval and Renaissance periods, and the examples which it contains-not meant as models for servile imitation, but as sources of fruitful suggestions-will no doubt be productive of great advantage, and give an incalculable impulse to the several branches of ornamental industry. The executive committee, in forming this extraordinary and unique collection, have been most generously assisted by all classes of the community, from HerMajestythe Queentothe owner of even a single article of historical or artistic interest. Mr. Waring, the superintendent of the museum, has been indefatigable in his exertions to make the department as complete as possible, and has succeeded in procuring specimens from the Royal collection, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Duke of Richmond, the Marquis of Breadslbane, the Marquis of Bath, the Earl of Cadogan, Lord Hastings, Sir Anthony Rothschild, General Ly2on, Cardinal Wisem the civil and ecclesiastical dignitaries of Oxford, Ca
bridge, York, and other cities, and from Messrs. Slade, Cheney, Addington, Field, Goff, Napier, and a great number of other well-known collectors. The museum, in addition, includes the whole of the Bernal and Soulage collections, constituting in themselves art expositions of the most remarkable character, to which nothing equal has hitherto been seen in England. In short, the collection richly and fullyustrates every species of manufacture and decoration in glass, earthenware, marble, wood, ivory, and the precious metals, together with the arts of the goldsmith, the carver, the enameller, the watchmaker, the locksmith, and the cutler.
In the cases devoted to articles in glass the visitor cannot fail to be struck by the splendid specimens contributed by the Duke of Buccleuch and MIr. Felix Slade. For beauty of form, lightness of material, and richness of ornamentation, nothing could surpass their examples of Venetian and German glass. It was at one time believed that if poison were poured into some of the finer kinds of Venetian glass the vessels would break to pieces. We know not whether the experiment was ever tried, but, after seeing the extreme delicacy of the articles exhibited by the Duke of Buccleuch and Mr. Slade, few will be disposed to deny that the statement is not so improbable as it might at first sight appear. The collection also contains many beautiful examples of engraving on glass, commenced with the diamond point by theVenetians in the 16th century, and subsequently greatly improved by maolhinery in Germany, France, and Holland. Etching on glass is likewise illustrated by numerous interesting specimens, and perhaps one of the most curious articles in the collection is an Arabian glass lamp contributed by Mr. J. W. Wyld.
In metal-work the museum is remarkably rich. With great generosity the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the colleges of Stonyhurst and Oscott,and many of the principal cities and towns in England have placed al their valuable relics of the Mediceval and Renaissance periods at the disposal of the executive committee. Some of the contibutions of private collectors, moreover, are of the most extraordinary character, illustrating in the amplest manner the art of the goldsmith and working in metals generally. Here are the crosier of William of Wykeham and the pastoral staff of Bishop Fox, from oxford; the rich plate of Oriel and Corpus; the maces and swords of York, Norwich, Oxford, and Chester; a number of beautiful cups and tankards belonging to the Marquis of Breadalbane; and the magnificent plate of the Duke of Devonshire. Her Majesty contributes a splendid shield, attributed to Benvenuto Cellini; and in the articles exhibited by the Earl of Cadogan, Cardinal Wiseman, Mr. Beresford Hope, and others, the history of metal-work may be traced from the earliest times to the present.
The examples of majolica ware are distinguished by richness of colour and beauty of design. Lord Hastings and Mr. Addington contribute some good specimens of various classes from the Hispano-Moorish, with its dark brown ornamental patterns on a white ground to the blue and yellow figured dishes of Pesaro. Of earthenware somne beautiful examples are exhibited by Sir Anthony Rothschild. They belong to the style which is known as thatof Dianaof Poictiers, andare designed and executedwithgreatdelicacy.ThePalissyware,remarkable for its fish, lizards, leaves, shells, and other natural objects coloured in relief, is represented by numerous specimens; while of delft Lord Hastings, Mr. Bohn, Mr. Mayer, Mr. Stirling, and Messrs. Minton, [have furnished examples characterized by great picturesqueness and quaintness of design. Many articles of English stoneware are included in the collection. The taste and skiLl of Wedgwood, the great English potter, are exemplified by a large number of his most beautiful productions, and some amusing imitations of the majolica ware are seen in the pieces of early English pottery contributed by Mr. Bradbury and Mr. Mills. Examples are exhibitedof some of the most remarkable manufactures of European porcelain. Her Majesty contributes several fine specimens of Dresden and Sevres, and many private collections have combined theirresourcestoillustrate the works of Berlin, Copenhagen, Douai, Buen Retiro, and Capo di Monte. Nor is there any lack of English china. Among the most interesting examples are some pieces of old Chelsea ware contributed by the Earl of Cadogan, the Earl of Chesterfield, and M1r. Addington, and here also are numerous specimens of the productions of Swansea, Lowestoft, Bow, Worcester, and Derby. The case of Oriental porcelain contains many pieces of Chinese, Japanese, and Persian ware. Choice examples of the first are furnished by the Queen, Lord Hlastings, and Mr. Fischer. Of the second Mr. Davidson exhibits some delicate and elegantly ornamented specimens; while of the third the contributions of MIr. Franks, Mr. Falkener, and Messrs. Minton are beautiful alike in design, execution, and colour.
Perhaps no section of the museum will be more interesting to the archnaologist aud the public generaLly than the one illustrative of working in ivory. Every style is here represented. The
cnaracteristics of the late Roman school are seen in the folding and votive tablets of Mr. Mayer; the stiff conventionalities of the Byzantine in the plaques of the Rev. Mr. Sneyd; and the curious Scandinavian designs in the drinking horns of Mr. Blackburn and the Dean and Chapter of York. Nothing could be finer than the celebrated medifeval pieces which constituted the late Dyce and Fejervary collections, and which are exhibited by Colonel Meyrick and Mr. Mayer; while " the Seasons" of Mr. Field, "the Christ at the Pillar" of Mr. Goff, the " Adam and Eve" of Mr. Phillip, and the splendid plateau of MIr. Beresford Hope fully illustrate the great period of the Renaissance.
Of the Bernal and Soulage collections it is sufficient to say that they form part of the general museum. The contents of the former, which fiU five cases, afford an extraordina idea of the great ingenuity, taste, and artistic ablity of past ages in every department of ornasiental art. Those of the ;latter-majolica ware, Venetian glass, medallions, ;furniture, and al-have been purchased by the members of the executive commnittee for the purpose of being added to the exhibition.
The collection of arms and armour, second only to that in the Tower, wil be attached to the general museum and exhibited in the great central hall. It will .e -arranged by Mr. PlanchU, Rouge Croix Rerald, and will form a prominent and attracive
feature of the exhibition. The suits of Armour fromithe celebratedMeyrickeollection include charm ing and elaborateexamplesof damascened,chased,and embossed metalwork. The embossed and inlaid suits of Alfonso,Duke of Ferrara, and of a Bavarian Knight are particolarly fine. Beyond the transept there is a court devoted to the exhibition of Oriental productions. The contributions to thisdepartment, especially those of Her Majesty, the East India Company, Mr. Fischer,. and Mr. Falkener are various and full of interest. Some extraoriin;ary specimens of ornamental armour and arms are exhibited, and the whole illutrates in an inatructive manner the history, life, and customs of the various Asiatic peoDles and tribes. The collection has been placed under the charge of Dr. Royle.
The central hall will be adorned witht some of the works of our best sculptors. Here the visitor will eee the "Hunter," the "Cupid and Psyche," and the "Aurora" of Gibson; the " Pastoral Nymph" and the "Girl at the Fountain" of Spence; the "Sabrina" and the "Ophelia" of Marshall; the "Ino'and Infant Bacchus" of Wyatt; the "Andremed" of Macdonald; and the "Love Triumphant" of M'DowalL Lord Ward contributes the famous "Venus" of Canova, and the art of the sculptor will be mustrated by many other examples.
But it would be vain to attempt to enumerate, within reasonable limits, a hundredth part of the objects contained in the general museum. Whole classesevenmustbe leftunnoticed. Nothing has been said of the brilliant enamels, the rare mosaics, the costly jewelry, the masterpieces in bronze and terra cotta which the committee have brought together from aU parts of the United Kingdom. mme idea of the extent, richness, and variety of the collection may be formed when it is stated that upwards of 6,000 articles each remarkable for the beauty of its material, the brilliancy of its colour, and the exquisite taste of its workmanship or the elegance of its design, are combined in one daz7ling mass to astonish and delight the beholder. The labour required to collect and arrange such a vast multitude of treasures must have been inumense, and still greater, if possible, must be the liberality and public spirit of those who have consented to part for a season with possesions so rare and valuable.
Lord Robert Cecil On Education.
LOBD ROBERT CECIL ON ZDUCA2'IO.y.
On Wednesday afternoon Lord Robert Cecil, XP., addressing an influential meeting at Stamford on the sabject of education, made the following observations:-
His LOBeDSHaxr said, he was well aware that this was not a subject that excited any very groat popular attention, or that brought any great interest to bear upon it. He sup. posed there was something unromantic in the materils of which it was composed, that little English children conning over their lessons were not so interesting to contemplate as Hindoos sitting under the shde of a banyan tree. If we came to deal with people of our own country, with unfortunate creatures lying in % state of worme than heathen duarknes almost at our very doors, it was next to impossible to arouse any earnest effort on their behalf. But if we were appealed to in behalf of a race of people thousands of mniles away, whose languge we could not understand, -Whose customs and religion provoked our wonder, whose very ideas were totally different to our own, the sympathy of every one, both male and female, was at once excited and there was no diffioulty in raisig contributions This was really a very curious anomaly, bat it had been established by very long experience. And yet, in referenoe to education, it puzzled him very much; because English. men were generally more alive to their own interest than to any other subject; and in nothing was their own interest touched so nearly as in the matter of education. We had recently passed over a very excting time ;he alluded to the general election. We had had sneeches from the hustings upon various important questions, and amaong the political predictions haarded had been that of an organic change in our representation. He was not going to troublethem with politics, or say what he thought upon such a measure; but this was very certain, that everybody would agree, whatever their political creed might be, that no such organic chane could possibly be deemed safe unless the people were educated to meet it. NoW, itwassometiMes said -he hadheard it said in that town -that we were educating the pneople too highly; that, whatever may have been the case ZD years ago, the people of England now knew quite as much as they ought to know. That was a notion not confined to that town. The other day he saw a speech of a glant major addressed to a metropolitan constitueno.
Mjor Reed said he thought every man in England perfectly competent to educate himself. (Lauhter.) Tho3e who had read he Times newspaper, and he supposed that included all present-mus know that within a very few weeks there had been a frightful exposure of the abyss of ignoranoe upon which we were standing. Everybody must have read the extraordinary details of a belief in witchcraft, furnished by magistrates from different parts of the country, which showed that that most ludicrous of all superstitions still clung with unyielding tenacity to our rural population. Most of these people were strict believers in witchcraft. They believed thaet whenever a cow fel ill or a pig died some old woman ought to be tried for it; and that if anybody was out late at night they had been carried off by some spiteful neighbour, and whirled 1OO mriles an hour through the air. The very people who believed these things woud he the people who, by the organic changes alluded to, would be intrusted with the choice of their representatives in Parliament. Now, remember what the choice of a representative meant. It meant the choice of the person who made the laws, who imposed the taxes we were to pay, and who devised m2easues for the security of our nhies and ,Perty. Now, if 'wewihed to extend the franchise to the people in qestion, it would be absolute madness to do so unless the educated classesmade "a strong puU and a pull altogether" to educate them up to the
uttes which they would have to perform. (Applase.) But that was not the only light in which this question of education should be viewed. We were entering upon one of the geatest social changes that any nation ever ventured upon. We were trying one of the most stuatling exneriments ever attempted; that was in reference to the abolition of trans. portation. For the last 200 years we had been able to pour ont the stream of moral pollution created at home upon other countries where its influence had been less felt and where that influence did not react upon ourselves. It was true that in continental countries they had not had that resource, but in those countries they had a despotic form of Government, which had immense power by the influence of the police. By means of surveillance and espionage they kept a strong grasp upon the criminal population. Novr, for the first time in the history of the world, poesessiDg a crowded population with every temptation to crime, and without any of those resources which were at the command of arbitrary Governments, we were turnng a stream of the most hardened criminals upon the social system of this country, to go back into their own neighbourhoot and be the centres from which crime might radiate. From all he saw and heard he feared this state of things would be unchanged, and that that was the system we should have to pursue; and the only chance we had to mitigate these evils and to remedy the dangers that threatened us was to stop the source of crime; and that was in a great measure ignorance. (Hear, hear.) Be did not say that education would absolately abolish crime. There must be a very different and higher machinery brought to bear upon it. But he did say that knowledge was a powerful gent in the repression of crime: the two were antagonistic one to the other. We exercised over a child in school an influence which lasted for life; an it wAs the only occasion during which the upper and lower classes were brought into contact. If we gave a taste for knowledge to children, they would grow up with it; and every man who possessed that taste had somet else than the society of th ,pblchouse iin which to psa his long winter evenings. Those who were acquaied with the administration of the laws would tell them that it was tho sin of drunkenness, contracted in these long evenings spent in the publichouse, to which our frightful criminal statis ties were mainly due. Therefore, for the safety ourselves and of our children, and in order to remedy the frightful dangers with which this new system threatened us, it was our interest as weU as our duty to strain every nerve to extend the education of the people. (Applaus.) But he would not appeal to them me= upon this ground: there were much higher motives for the spread of education. It was part of the great scheme of evangelization. There were now around us heathens a' degraded as oould be found in anynation in the world; and what was a stronger fact still, not only were there such heathens, but he would venture to say there was nowhere in the world that stolid, invincible, insuperable ignorance which was to be found in the genuine English peasant. Perhaps they were better here in Iancolnshire; but he thought he might safelysay that those of Sussex hailnot their equal. In more southern countries they were quick to catch ideas, quick to exercise their faculties; nature made up for the deficiencies of man. And if we went to those who were called par cdzaencc " savages," whr the very necessty of their position, the necessity of providing for themselves daily food by their own sIU and cnnnin made them ten times as quick and bright as the 13nglis
labourer for whom everything was provided. He had travellea among and ha add i tercourse with natives of New Zealand, and marked the difference betweena thenm and the English labourer; and, though we were in the habit of speaking of the former asa i poor benighted savage," and pleading for him at our misonary meetings, he was in intellect and in theo qulckness of hIlfaculties fsar superior to our own countrymen. Therefore he thought we ought to give to this matter of edueation our most earnest attention. It affected our interests and it affected our duty- it was the thing for which we lived upon earth. The greas object wa. the proation of the religion which Erd been intruse to us; and if we did not do something to stem this tide of ignorance which our fathers had allowed to grow to this height-and we mnust remember that wre had to deel with the arrears as well as to discharge our own present dutr-if we d3id not do this, all that we valued most highly, adl the
bnefits of civiliation and religion would be swept aay. (Applause.)

LONDON, FRTDAY, APRIL 17, 1857,
Our coltmns yesterday recorded the rather rare instance in these days of a man founding a public institution at his own cost and in his own lifetime. Mr. Bitowzr, M.P. for South Lancashire, who on Wednesday laid the first stone of a new Free Library and Museum at Liverpool, is not a man vwlo would wish to be set up as an example of benevolence, In wishing that his own name might be connected with the institution he has merely indulged a natural feeling for the locality and the people among whom he has lived and to whom his sympathies are engaged. No man ever yet had children or friends who did not wish to be long remembered among them. No one ever founded house and home, or even went long to the same church, without a hope that his name might survive as long as any warmth of affection, any social gratitude, or any kind of fragrance lingered about it. But we feel it a public duty to draw Mr. BRowN's munificence into the light of day and make our comments upon it. WNhy is this kind of thing so uncommon? When fortunes are going aboutbegging-when thousands have accumulated with a magical facility wealth which they know not how to dispose of-when the Legislature itself interferes, wisely, as we believe, to prevent the public from benefiting by deathbed caprices of feeling or of judgment-how is it that so fevw men do these public works, which they yet live to see, and direct, and enjoy ? In point of fact, if people could be warned by experience, a rich man without children or other personal objects of interest very seldom gets as much enjoyment out of his money as he would from some public application of it. Sav:ng money 'till one knows not how to will it; spending it in land that will go to one knows not whom ; buildirng houses that wil soon be inhabited by strangers, or by nobody at allU and speculations indulged in from the morbid restlessness of age,none of them offer so much prospect of constant and wholesome interest as the foundation of some work of public and undoubted utility. Then, why is not this more done ? The fact is so flagrant that we would rather receive answers than give them. Some regard we admit there is for the souls of men; some, too, for their bodies. Men found churches and preachers to show the way to Hleaven, and we have institutions enough to give
bread and meat, clothes, medicine, clean water, and such material appliances. But between the highest aspirations of the soul and the common wants of the body there is a vast gap to be filled up. Why is it that men do not found libraries, museums, reading-rooms, picture ana sculpture galleries, colleges, public walks and gardens, and all those less necessary things, which, while they pretend only to refresh and amuse, ae natural and efficacious steps from the lower life to the higher, from earth to Heaven ?
*Mr. BRowN's speech on laying the first stone was an answer to another question,-how these tbings do in some cases come to be done? It has been a growing idea in his mind. He had the local attachment; he felt the interest; he was for a long time a member of a literary institution cailed the Historic Society, which has a good library and reading-room; he had the examples of the old Public Library at Liverpool, and the collection of natural history bequeathed by the late Lord DmiBY to the townn; he has been much interested in several questions affecting commerce; he has seen the value of reading in opening men's. minds to the abandonment of error and the adoption of improvement; so at last he greatly desired to see a Free Library in Liverpool. First he offered 6,0001. towardsthis object; then he doubled it; then he proposed to take the whole cost, and we have no fear of damping Mr. Bnowx's generosity if we venture to anticipate that from first to Last he will find himself let in for about double the sum which he even now imagines. This is the way in which such ideas grow, and, to our mind, it is better they should grow in this way. We would rather see a man's benevolence gradually develope from a five guinea subscription to an expenditure of 50,0001. than that he should devote that sum to the purpose all at once, on some sudden inspiration. There is more hoart and soul in growing plans. It is the course of nature. Experience and good advice, common sense, and reasonable sympathy with men's actual wants have more chance this way thban with the application of a round sum. 'lThe best works are those which take a man's whole life, and bud in his childhood, and bear fruit in his old age. Great scandal comes to public benevolence from the vast sums which have been lavished without that feeling and tact which are necessary to practical success. It is easy enough to engage an architect, to plan a fine building, to invite tenders, and get the work well done, with little more result than to add one more useless building to the many that already encumber the British soil. Utility must be made agreeable, pliant, and seductive; the miind of mau must be courted and won. Now, Mr. BRows is eminently a practical man. He has been all his life accustomed to adapt the means to the end. He has had to deal with the wants of men, to respect those wants, and find his interest and pleasure in ministering to them. He has had to use human agencies; he has had good servauts and bad ones; and he knows what makes a good one, and what makes a bad one. He has not acquired that respect for popular ignorance which is still found 'in some quarters. He is the man to found a Library and a Museum, and not only to found, but to fill it. It is true he designs this, as we understand, chiefly as a receptacle for present accumulations and expected contributions; but no doubt he will have something to to do with the contents, and it is better that he should.
And there are indeed people who can decry the idea of a public room where men of all classes can sit down and read what books they please. Well no doubt, the profersion of literature, and particular scientific inquiries, can be carried on to better advantage in private libraries, with a comfortable chair, a good table, a good fire, and a pair of waxlights, all to one's self. It must be admitted, too, that there may be, and probably is, a great deal of nonsenrse, of folly, of coxcombry, and much that is laughable as well as hollow and bad in a public reading-room. Artisans will either read popular novels or periodicals, or puzzle their brains to no purpose over poetry or science above their taste or their grasp. It must be considered, however, that we have to deal with actual men and actual things, with the world as it is, not as it ought to be, or as we may fancy it ought to be. Mechanics read to nearly as much purpose as their betters. Gentlemen with 5,0001. a-year, and even young men at those famous seats of learning, Oxford and Cambridge, do not confine themselves to Divinity, Philosophy, History, Mathematics, and the " ologies." Literature itself is an existent fact, a growth of time, not a day's manufacture. We cannot imagine a book and have it made. The various societies for the spread of sound knowledge know this too well. They can none of them get a good readable history of England, or of any other country, to be useful and interesting, in a reasonable compass. There is no choice but to take the books that are in the world, only excluding those that are outrageously bad, and then collect them before the men that are in the world, leaving the actual minds of the -world to feed as they list on its actual literature. They will wander about, and lose themselves, perhaps; but there will be a little more light and a little less chance of error in a public reading-room, with thousands of bookz, than when a man sits down in his own house, surrounded by his family, to some old volume picked up from a bookstall, or gropes in the dark after some invention, which, as Mr. BRoWN says, has been found out many times before. Knowledge is always pursued under difficulties and distractions, and they will certainly not be aggravated by libraries and museums.
It has been said that there are no subjects so
It has been said that there are no subjects so difficult to impress on the public mind in this country as Indian subjects. We believe that at one time there was great truth in the saying, but a very perceptible stride has been taken in this matter during the last few years, and we now ask the attention of our readers to the affairs of Bengal with a tolerable confidence in the result of our request. The question, too, is a very Eerious and pertinent one, for it concerns nothing less than the rights of British subjects on British territory and under British government.
We shall not be presumning too much on the reader's memory if we suppose him to recollect that by the constitution of our Indian Empire a Supreme Court of Justice has been established in Bengal, the Judges in which receive their appoin'. ments from the Cnoww, and exercise a jurisdiction independent of the Company. To this Court alone, except in cases of petty assault, have British subjects resident in the country been hitherto criminally amenable, and trial has been conducted by jury, as in England. That this centralization of justice in Calcutta was attended with its inconsveniences there can be no difficulty in beLieving, but it carried with it, at any rate, securities of the utmost importance to the liberties and property of our countrymnen who might be living under the Company's aithority, in the midst of an enormous foreign population. This Supreme Court it is now, in pursuance of the recommendations of the Indian Law Commissioners, proposed to abolish, and to render British residents amenab]e to certain other Courts, four in number, according to the nature of the charges preferred. The frst of these, for the cognizance of graver offences, ae the
Courts of Session, in which a Company'a Judge is to preside, and a jury of not less than three, nor more than nine, taken from a certain registered class, including natives, is to decide, not necesarily by unanimity, but by the opinion of two-thirds. In the other thrae Courts the Judges are to be represented by the Company's magistrates and their asistants, in a de-
,cending scale of rank, and with a graduated scale of authority, their powers of punishment ranging from two years' imprisonment and 1001. fine to tbree months of the former penalty and 101. of the latter, but in all three cases the jurisdiction is to be summary, and no jury is to be employed.
We need be at little pains to explain the havock which will be wrought with British privileges if these arrangements should be aciually carried out. Our countrymen wil be sufferers in every possible way. They will first lose in the Judge. In the Supreme Court the presiding officer is not only a trained lawyer of proved ability and professional distinction, but, inasmuch as his office is not held at the pleasure of the Company, his independence is beyond reach of imputation. In the new Courts the Judges wiU be Company's servantsa capacity which implies not merely dependence, since their employers can suspend or remove them, but very possibly more or less incompotence besides, for there is no distinct judicial department in the Company's service, and the office of Judge is taken by succession or arrangement, like that of Collector or Commissioner, as one step in a comprehensive career. The next loss will be in the jury. By the composition of the Supreme Court Englishmen, thongh living on the banks of the Ganges, retain the advantages of this national institution as securely as on the banks of the Thames-a protection more than ever inestimable in a country where the publicity of affairs prevails but imperfectly, and professional assistance is not easily to be procured. In all the new Courts this security will be wanting. Even in the Sessions Courts, which will comprise a jury, as that jury may include any number of natives, and as natives have no such respect for oaths as we have, the safeguard is virtually lost. To say this is no calumny against Indians, for their views in such matters are perfectly notorious, so that all the guarantees provided by the Supreme Court will be sacrificed together, and with consequences which may assume the most alarming character. An Englishman may be put upon his trial before an incompetent or intimidated judge; he may be prosecuted at the suit of a wealthy and unscrupulous native; he may be assailed by such evidence as that prosecutor can readily eommand, and, without any of the protection derivable from a jury, he may be sentenced to imprisonment in a country where imprisonment, from the operation of the climate, may probably be death. As an illustration of the new code, the reader may understand that it is rendered penal to say anything insulting to any religious creed. Now, suppose a Christian missionary preaching to natives,-what is more likely than that some expressions of his discours should be reported as offensive to Brabminism, and that the delinquency may be established before one of the new Courts? Yet, in such a case imprisonment might follow, and with it such a martyrdom as has never yet boon included in the risks of propagating the Gospel.
If further evidence were needed to expose the flagrant injustice of these propositions, it would be found in the significant fact that every civil, military, and naval servant of theCompany itself is to be exempted from the jurisdiction of these tribunals, so that the conseauences are to be borne by the independent residents alone. In all respects, too, of precedent or presumption the design appears equally indefensible. Generally speaking, our usage has been rather to force the institution of a jury upon populations unprepared and unsolicitous for it, whereas we are now proposing to deprive our own countrymen of it against their will. But three or four years ago the competence of Indian Judges even for the current service of India was roughly impugned, whereas we are now designing to subject Englishmen as well as natives to their authority. That such prospects as these should excite a lively alarm in the breasts of all British residents will appear in no degree surprising. A few weeks since nearly 1,000 Europeans assembled in the Town-hall at Calcutta to protest against this unwarrantable interference with their national rights.
We can conceive some of the motives of administative economy which may haveprompted this proceeding, but we are at a loss to find in any of them a justification for the conclusion. If imiformity be desirable, it would surely be better to remodel the bad Courts by the good ones than to assimilate the good to the bad. If mere convenience carries any weight, that might be an argument for establishing good branch Courts in the provinces, but not for abolisbing that existing in the capital-not to mention that this is a consideration for the residents themselves. But, though convenience and economy are important things, they are not important enough to decide a matter like this, which involves questions of the very highest importance to the prosperity of our Empire in the East. We believe it to be of the utmost consequence to the progress of India that the intelligence, the energies, and the capital of Britain should be attracted to a territory which wants no other accessories to render it the richest in the world. India is no longer a land of gold and diamonds, but it is a land teeming with treasures by the side of which jewels are dross. We never hear of the failure of any commodity in the country of its production but what we are told that India, with proper app'iances, would yield it to perfection. We know that the Deccan can grow cotton enough for all the mills of Lancashire. We know that the slopes of the Himalayas can grow tea as good as we get from Shanghai. No sooner had the silk crop fallen short than the Neilgherry Hills were reported as possessing one of the best climates in the world for restoring the supply, and in the last Indian papers arriving in this country it was stated as an unquestionable fact that every costly drug imported for medicinal
purposes from Europe or Amenrca had its counterpart in the botany of India. With all these precious capabilities India is a country not half developed. It does not require any laborious clearing, like California or Australia, but simply cultivating, irrigating, and intersecting by roads. It demands, in short, nothing but the application of those means with which this country overflows, and to attract those means to it no assurance can be so effective as that of good government and freedom. In our opiuion, everything should be done to naturalize the enterprise of Englishmen in India, and it is for this reason that
we look with especial dissatisfaction upon measure3 which must inevitably tend to repel it. That India must for long wear the aspect of a military settlement we are perfectly aware; it is only at that cost that we can preserve its tranquillity and leave its resources room to expand; but, unless this ex-
pansion is accomplished in the meantime, we shalU have nothing to produce as the positive fruit of our dominion. Let the armies of India comm%ud peace; but let Euglishmen be induced by the certainty of fair play and freedom to turn that pea ~e to uses which make it a double blessing.
The inquiry into the origin of that fearful
I The inquiry into the origin of that fea-rful
explosion at Lundhill, by which 189 persons
perished, has established the fact that the accident must have been the resut of culpable carelesness, and has eEcited the opinion of at least one competent witness that the 'node of working aU the coal mines in the Barnsley district is moat dangerous. The seam of coal in thix district is known to yield large quantities of inflammable gas, or Biredamp, and is therefore said to be fiery. Yet here, where more than ordinay precautions were neceasary in the management of the miming, moro than ordinary carelesness was displayed. The colliers, we are told, do not blame anybody for the accident, and perhaps it is natural that, with the callousness engendered by ignorance and by habit, they should come to regard their perilous position with somewhat of the indifference of fataists. By no theory of chance or fate, however, wiU the educated public be satisfied when they continualy bear of these terrible calamities, by which hundreds of families are at once made desolate. In the present instance, especially, we can conceive that, whether justly or not, indignation would be excited by the enormous sacrifice of life, when regarded in comparison with the feeble attempts to rescue any of the sufferers. It wiU be remembered that the explosion took place shortly after midday on the 19th of February last, when the miners were dining, there being at that time 208 persons in the pit. It was four hours before any one descended the shaft to ascertain the extent of the calamity, or to attempt the rescue of the miners. In four hours more, after only 19 men had been rescued, and when it was found that a part of the pit was on fire, the flames rushing out of the ventilating shaft to an immense-height, it was determined to save property at the poesible sacrifice of life, by closing the mouth of the pit and stopping tho current of air that fed the flames. It was a fearful alternative, and, timorous and feeble as the attempts to rescue the sufferers appear to have been, we are disposed to think that under the circumstances more could not have been done. At the same time, if such are the dangers to which miners are exposed, and if such are the alternatives which masters have to meet, howv vividly does it illustrate the responsibility of their position and the neeessity of a conscience perfectly clear I It generaUy happens that when these terrible accidents occur the miners are immediately at fault-they are guilty of the imprudence of using a naked light; in some cases, as in the instance of the Swansea Explosion, reported on Monday last, the foolhardy workman uses it in spite of the warnings of fellow-workmen, who suffer with him for his crime. But, if the miner is immediately to blame, it is fair also to inquire how far he may be the victim of a system which permits so enormous a discretion to ignorant individuals who have not a momentfs thought, no self-control, no idea of the value of life. Is it fair to the individual miner to expect that a man in his forlorn position, if he had his option as to the use or disuse of a certain light, would be likely to err on the safe side? And is it fair to the miners collectively that they should be placed in the power of any one of their number who, for his own ease and gratification, may be reckless enough, notwithstanding their entreaties, to take the cap off his DAVY lamp ?
From the evidence which we published on Saturday it wil be found that on the day of the explosion there was not a single DAVY lamp in use in any part of the Lundhill Pit, and the miners were never required to use it, except when they actuaUy came in contact with what are called " blowers"-that is to say, streams of gas issuing from the coal. It will be asked, how could such a system be permitted in working a seam of coal known to be of the fiery or dangerous kind? Because reliance was placed on7 the attempt to prevent accidents by perfect ventilation. Not that the ventilation was by any means perfect. In some parts of the pit the air was quite stagnant; in most of the air passages there was some deficiency of arrangement; and at the bottom of the ventilating shaft there was a contrivance which it appears to us must have aggravated the danger. The mine was ventilated by a copious stream of air entering at the mouth of the pit, traversing the various passages, and finally emerging by a shaft, at the bottom of which was a large furnace for the purpose of attracting the air. This mine of extremely gaseous coal, therefore, was carefully ventilated with the object of carrying away aU the explomive air, and matters were so arranged that aU the inflammable gas which it was proposed to disperse was concentrated upon a furnace, where it might have the very best chance of exploding. There are many other pits besides that of Lundhill in which the ventilation is contrived on similar principles, wanting what is caUed a " dumb drift," by means of which the foul air may pass out of the mine without coming into contact with the furnace. Apart from these errors of design, the pit seems to have been weU ventilated, in the sense of having plenty of air, and some of the colliers complain of having had too much, the strong currents of air interfering with the light of their candles. In that last word lies the mischief. The men were allowed to use candles and ordinary lamps; they were not compelled to use the DAvy, although other mines in the same seam are worked entirely with this safety lamp, and it was known that at any time a " blower" might fil some part of the pit with inflammable gas. How the accident actually occurred will probably never be ascertained. The most reasonable conjecture is that a part of the roof which is known to have been fragile gave way, and that instantly there was a " blower," or outburst of gas, which, coming into contact with the nearest naked light, produced this fearful catastrophe.
While the neglect of proper precautions is not by any means to be excused, it is impossible in considering this subject to overlook the fact that there seems to be a strong objection among miners to the adoption of the DAvy lamp. The masters and overseers can compel the use of it, and with the gauze locked, so as to secure it from the attempts of the miners to
expose the light. But the light of the DAvY lamp when properly covered is so feeble that we cannot altogether wonder at the masters being willing to dispense with it as much as possible; and, when the use of it is left to the discretion of the men, who is not ready to forgive them if in the midst of their dark, dreary work, they crave a more certain glimmer, and light their talow candles at the risk of being blown to pieces? We are not moles, we are not bats, we are not gnomes; it is not without suffering that any of us can be brought to work in the outer darkness, an(d doing violence to that sense which is the most delicate, the most inspiriting, the most precious that we have. The DAVY lamp was a brilliant inveation, and it is an excellent defence. But if it defends life it offends nature. It is a precaution that must be used at the expense of one of our strongest desires, and experience has shown that miners wiU incur the most terrible risks rather than use it under ordinary circumstances. We cannot help asking whether it is not possible, by increasing the size and power of the DAVY, to produce a lamp which shall be safe, which shall give plenty of light, which miners shall not be tempted to tamper with, aud which masters shall have no excuse for withholding from their workmenu

DIABOLIcAL ATrE'r.-As a workman of the extensive powder-mill of St. Chamas(BouchesduRhone), which belongs to the Government, was on Saturday afternoon about to reLume his work in one of the rooms, in which there were at least 10 tons of gunpowder, he perceived some blueish substance in the midst of the powder be had to handle; and on examining it found the heds of a dozen chymical matches, so arranged as probably to cause an explosion on being touched. He immediately summoned his ohiefs, and the heads of the matches were removed with the greatest care. The operation was attended with considerable danger, as, in addition to the vast quantity of gunpowder in the place, there were at least 30 tons in an adjacent storehouse. As it was imnonsible to suspect ary one of the workmen of the establishment of having formed the design of causing an explosion, inasmuch as in all probability he would become a victim of it himself, suspicion fell on a young man named Nouttet, a stranger to the establishment, who on some pretext had entered it just as the wcrkmen were suspending work to go to dinner. He was sought for everywhore, and was at last found stationed on the top of a higb hill which overlooks the mill, gazing earnestly below, as if in momentary expectation of some great event. He was at once arested, anud as his replies to the questions put to him were not satisfactoIy he has been detained in custody. About two months ago a terrible explosion, which did great damage and killed five persons, took place in the same mill, and the cause of it was never discovered.

The steamer Genova, from the Brazils, put in here yesterday for coals, and leaves again to-day for Genoa, at the same hour as the Tagus packet for Southampton. She left Rio de Janeiro eight days after the Tamar, whose news was reported in 2 h Time. of the 25th of March. Her dates aro:-Rio de .Janeiro, March 5; Bahia, March 10; Per. nambuco, March 14; Sb. Vincent, March 28; Madeira, April 5.
The Royal mail packet Medway, with the outward mails from Southampton, had arrived at Pernambuco on the 5th of March, and was expected at Rio in time to leave again for Europe on the 17th, so that she may be expected to arrive at Southampton about the same time as the Tagus, which takes this report.
TheGenovabeing under quarantine, I have had no opportunityofcoUectingany political newsfrom Rio deJaneiro,and, my commercial letters from that port having miscarried, I can only say generally that the markets are reported by a merchant here in the trade to have remained in the same state as when the Tamar left.
Pernambuco advices respecting sugars note a continuedl active demand, and an advance in browns of 100 reis pber arroba. The last quotations are-ordinary, 2.900, or 27a. 7d per owt., free on board; superior, 3,350, or31s. 6d. per cwt. free on board. Whites were at 3,600 to 5,000, or 34s. 1ld. to 47a. per cwt., free on board. Cotton, 7,400 to 7,500, or 7jd. to 7jd. perlb., free onboard. Freights continued dull, the last charter being at 35s. and 5 per cent. for united kingdom, with nsual extras for continental ports. Exchange 27id., at which money offered freely. The yellow fever had quite disappeared, and left the province of Per. nambuco once more in a healthy state.
Bahia letters state that sugars continued in active demand-3,200 reis for good browns, and 4,000 reis for whites, which are equal to 2Ss. l1d. and 35s. lid. per cwt. free ou board; while ordinary browns could be had at 3,100 reis, ov 28s. Id. per ow No cotton remained on hand at Babhia and at Maceio it was selling at 7,200 reis to 7,40 reis' Freights to London, 40s.; Liverpool, 30s.; and to Channel, 45s.

The Late Thunderstorm In France.-The
ThE LATE TXIuMZDSTOTI I- FBRogc&-The storm which prevailed on Friday last in several of the departments was attended with melancholy con-
sequences in certain parts of the Oise. At Chevieres a' young man who was at work with his parents in potato field was knocked down by the lightning and kIlled oa the Fpot. Hi"s cp was burut, his boots ripped up, and a part of the chain of his vwatch melted. At Sauqueuse St. Lucien, as two m3en named Caron and Geffroy were passing a windmill, the miller requested their assistance to turn round the sails, as he feared a atorm was coming on. Scarcely had they completed their task, when the rain began to fall in torrents, and they ran for shelter, Caron into a stable, and Geffroy nd the miller into the mill. When the storm, rhich lasted for some time, was over, Caron came out of his hiding-place, and called for his oompanion, but,not receiving any answer, commenced* a earch for him, and found him near the shaft of the mill, quite dead. The lightnin, had perforated a small hole at the back of his neck, and several similar holes were found in different parts of the body. EIs clothes remained uninjured. Caron states that, from the place in which lie stood in the stable he sar the lightning fall on the mill five different times, bat no injury appears to have been done to the building. Daring the storm the electric fluid fell on the wires of the telegraph between the stations of Bfueil and Boisset (1ure), and melted the metal for a distance of alout half a mile, overtuning at the same timedour or friveof the wooden sup. porters. It findlly entered the ground on the iron-way, tearing up several of the sleepers, and leaving a large hole wrhich would most prohahily have caused an accident, had it no; b-een perceived in hime.

The banquet given by the town to Mr. Brown, af some mark of its Appreciation of the munificence displayed by Uht gentleman by his princely gift, was hold at St. Jeorge's-hall. Upwards of 800 persons were present, the jprlncipal table being ocoupied by Lord Stanley, General Sir flrzy Smith, Lord Talbot, Sir J. Pakington, Mr. monckton
EIffnee, Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne, the Bishop of Chester, SirJT. P. IL Shuttleworth, Major-General the Ron. Sir Edward Cust, Mr. Joseph C. Ewart, Mr. J. Cheetham, My 1. B. Horsfall, &c. Mr. James HolIno again officiated for .ho Mayor, Mr. Shand, who was prevented by illness from being present.
Grace having been sad by the Rev. Mr. CAXPBELL, the -Rector of Liverpool,
The CHIARHMA1 read the foUowing letter which had been received from the Earl of Derby:-
"XLord Derby preentshis hcospliments to the Mayor of Liverpool, andregrets that hls absence from home for the remainder of this week Wi prerent his baring the pleasure of atteadl.g the ceremony of uaying the fettone ot the new Museum, on wednesday, and the dinmer afterwards at the St. George's-halL He Yesrets thla the more, as
lndependemtly of the personal literest which he cannot but feel in the -ccadion, hle rould have had much pleasurc in paying, by his attend=ce, a well-merited tribute of respect to Mr. Brown for his liberal zauincece and public spirit; and he will be gre,tly obUged to the Mayor if he will have the goodness to offer to that gentleman this oxenes8lon of bis feellngs.
" Knowaley, AprIl 13."
The DBPUTY-MAYOR gave "the Queen," 'wishing HIer lajesty a speedy recovery. (Cheers.) Air:-" (;od save the Queen."
" Prirce Albert, Alberz Prince of Wales, and the rest of jibe Royal Family," was also received with enthusiasm.
"The health of the bishop and clergy of the diocess" .-was given from the chair.
The Lord Bishop of Ca sTiR, in responding, spoke thus -of Mr. Brown and hisi gift:-I beg hin. to believe thattthere is not any person present here who agrees mnore cordially -than myself in all the public testirnonies of honour and respect paid hins by all classes of Liverpool this day, on an occasion wvhich, leg me say, interests all classes-1 say, it interests all classes. A public library had become a publio want; and I anm glad to hear it, for it is the necessary, the -happy result of the progress of education among the people. I know very well that the education of our people fals short of the point which we wish it should reach; and many nen, prominent in station, have turned their minds to devise somo practical plans to extend the benefits of education, and no one indeed more than our distinguished Visitor with whose compauy we are now honoured-Sir John Pakington (cheers)-one who, if he bas shared the -fate of many pbilanthropists-if he has not been .able to gain univerald assent for his own particular plan, bas certainly gained universal respect and honour for the enlightened philanthropy which has prompted 'his energies and his efforts. (Hear, hear.) But let the defects of education be what they may, I -mnay say that even in my own memory education has mnade groat advances in this country--great advances in almost nl classes-but I aa going to nmention only one-I speak of the class of superior artisans, mechanics, and working men. (Hear, hear.) The persons who compose that class are most of them well instructed in the elemoentary parts of learning, and are naturalUy eager to increase their stock of knowledge. There has been latterly an intellectual appotite and taste orested in them w hich seeks for intellectual food. A newv class has been added to the reading public of this country. But the classes of which I am speaking-the persons compesing those classes are not in a condition to afford libraries in their owna homes. God be thanked, every one of them can have at Ihome one lhook worth all the books of the world beside-* he can have the Bible at home to call his own to bless andi sanctify his household and all that it contains. But for otherbooks, Hf he iS to have access to them, he must depend upon public libraries for the supply-libraries where men of his class can go and borrow works for the payment of a email sum, or without any pal-mnt. Now, our worthy friend has come forward at this moment to supply what I have designated as a public want-a freeLibrary for LiverpooL. (Cheers.) Things bad been tending to this point. Ail things wore in a prosperous turn for the last step, wvhich we have now reacbed, for a Large collection of books had been alreaoy formed, and was ready for the public use through the enlightened liberality of the corporation of L^iverpool. (Cheers.) The experiment has been tried for more than a year-more than two years-and has been found eminently successful. Mlultitudes have flocked to profit by the opportunities thus afforded for their intellectnalimxprovement, and I rejoice from my heart in that success. But one thing still was wanting-a building fit to receive that colloction of books, -with such additions to it as will from time to time be necessary, in order to keep pace with the progress of lterat-ure and knowledge, (Hear.) Th at want has been supplied also, and 1 rejoice that iny friend has been the man to come forward to do himself and Liverpool the honour of erecting the Free Library and Museutm for Liverpool. Itwill contain a store of uLseful, tnstructive, and entertaining books, in every department of our Itterature. No doutbt care will be taken to erclude all immoral, all improper books; care will be taken to do that. I grieve to say that I havo seen it stated in the public prints that vast numbers of such immoral works are continually isuing from the press. I grieve, I say, if this be so. But
if it be. there is one comfort, that the foul and loathsome| publications shun the light of day-that they hide themtselves away with the conscioosne8s of guilt and shame upon te.The Free Library supplies an antidote to these-a store of wholesonme, healthful, general literature, such as will foster good principles and generous sentiments and manly spirit, such as, under God's blessing, v,ill not only enlarge the understanding hut improve and purify and elevate the heart. (Cheers.5 I rejoice that we are on the wiay to see the accomplishment of this great work. I rejoice at the step that has been taken to-day, and I rejoice also to usnderstand thait the building, wvhen comlpleted, will receive that magnificent collection of objects of natural history which was presented to the town by the Earl of Derby. (Cheers.)
The CllAIRMA1.X next gave " the army and navy," coupling with the toast the names of Lieutenant-General * Sir Harry Smith and Lord Talbot. (Cheers.)
The toast wvas drunk with enthusiasm, the baud playing ",ths British Grenadiers" and "Rule, BritanDia."
Sir RARItY Sr-IIra rose amid great cheering. RIe said * MSr. MSayor, my lords, and gentlemen, the honour you have conferred upon mue in associating my name and deeds with the British army is one for which I gratefully thank you. This is not the first occasion upon wvhich I have been indebted to the borough of Liverpool. When in command in India, and when I was fortunately successful by the gal.
latry of the soldiers under me, I received a most complimnentary and congratulatory address upon my victory. I have, it is true, boost almost al over the world;* and proud am I to say that I never beard the name of the British mierehant mentioned but as a man of integrity, honour, and enterprise. (Applause.) Happy am I to be here now among you to record that feeling which I individually posess, and which I have so universally heard expressed. (Applause. And now, gentlemen, we will revert to the *army. It isnowv under the energetic command of his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge; it is progressing favour. ably in every way; and, as this is an occasion uplon which Ieducation is the principal subject, I will mention that upon
a recent inspection of the 25th Regiment there wrere 340 of that regiment voluntarily attending the school, and progressing in the higher branches of architecture and in practical knowledge. (Applause.' Sinces the days of old, when our army was ever successful and considered highly honour. able1 the archers of those days were thought the best sol1diers in the world, so now may I say are our infantry considered. We are advancing rapidly in the imp)rovement of the armn called the MKinid rifle, and the distant nire is more exact than I can well describce; but I trust that the old systemn of gaining victories by the bayonet, which, in other words, is a rush of gallant men upon a given point, keeping before them their enemies, will not be lost sight of, and that English soldier's will still learn *to grapple wfith their enemies. (Loud applause.) Our gallant army, as you well knowv, has roenetly returned from a most severe and arduons camnpaign, having added additional laurebs to their standard and to the gory of their country. A considerable portion of that army is now abcout *to embark, or has embarked, for foreigKn service, to carry on a distant and costly was-a war which, I trust, will soon aand spoeedily be terminated; for, howvever unfortunately it may have commenced, it is one which must be supportedi. (Applause.) If England doss not support Hier Majesty's representatives and hor officers in authority thus distantly 8ituated, I say England's glory must diminish; and had the person I alUnde to referred 10,000 miles off for instrucliionls, I say there is nota man in England, on such an oca* n, who would not have condemned him. (Applause.)
nitish soldiers are ever ready to .fight, nor do they split straws or dwell upon legal technicalities.. (Laughter, and
'"Hear !") Eogland is insulted; her honour is tarnished, and redress must oe achieved. They go to w ork humanely but manfulUy, and never more so than upon an occasion wvhen the flag of HIer Majesty the Queen is insulted and the national honour of England domied. (Applause.) It has been my misfortune, I mcay say, to have been placed in a similar position to the person I allude to. And when we s ee the enemy, whose duty it is to preserve peace, treating wtth contempt tho person who has been intrusted by his country to suppres rebellion or to d .tro the foe, then I say that we feel that he-who is placed'' Ainadistan and
sponsible stuation demands and will receive, I do believe, the bupport of his country. (The gallant general resumed his seat amtid enthueinstio cheering.)
Earl TALBOT replied in a spirited specch on behalf of the navy.
After "the health of the Lord-Lieutenant of the - county,"
The CUATR31AN proposed the toast of the evening,"'the health of William Brown." He said,-My lords -and gentlemen, I now approach with some diffidence the toast of the eveniug, because I feel my inability to do full justice to it - but I therefore ask you, gentlemen, to do an act of justice to yourselves, as well as to the dis. tinguished geutleman on my right hand, who is weU 'worthy of your warmest regards. For nearly 50 years as a Liverpool merchant his name has been among us a household term, and he is yet spared to crown a long and active life by a princely act, which is an example to others, and will perpetuate his name to future ages. (Ap. plause.) I claim Mr. Brown as one who sprung from the middle classes of life-i's one who was early cast upon the ocean of business, and most manfally, most successfmUy, and most honourably has he played his part. (Applause.) He is a proof of what may be effected with individual enterprise, with individual honesty, and individual integrity, in a country whichis blessed withfree institutions, where every man is permitted to reap the fruit of his own industry, and to enployi the fruit of that industry for the purpose of blesinug Iis fellow-mon (ceeors) and extending the benefits of education, and in ptomoting those numerous insti tutlOns which, blessed be GUd, under the Christian
riples EngLand, are scattered like bright gems over
fae of5 of our land. (Loud applause.) Eminent ra have partaken ra themr tof a naVtionlt iTtnhititof a \eoiJ charcter, he s-tands out ia bold relief among thosfe. wnf.
nent merchants--among the galyxy of cotimercial men of whom Liverpool mhy indeed be proud; and, thank God, we have had numbers of men of that character, of that talent, and of that benevolence, who, by their enterpise, have sent their ships to penetrate into every sea-their sis have whitened every t4ore; they have been the means of connecting us vwith distant lands-they have been the means of giving employrcent to our manufacturers, by their enter. prise in exporting the manufactures of Englishmen to other , countries, au importing those raw materials which cause
the chimneys of Manchester to smoke, and give employment to the porters on our quays. It is such men who have raised this port from being merely a fishing village to the Leatest connercial emporium in the world. (Applause.) unasguming as lay frienid here is in private life, he has yet been selected to represent the great commercial and smanufacturriig district of Lancashire in the Imperial Parliament, and faithfully and honourably has he performed the duly iLmjposed upon him. (Applause.) Of his princely munificence vou have to-day had a striking ex ample, and therefore you are judges quite as well as Ia.
But just as that princely merchant, Guy, has connected his nams witb London by the hospital lie founded, and just as George lieriot has connected his name with the magnificent educational institution of modern Athensso will the namie of Mr. Brown (applause) be for ever connected with Liverpool; and fature gener tions will peint to the magnificen- establishment of which this day the first stone Was laid with cheering, and will remember the name of the beneficent founder, aud bless him for his bene. volence. (Applause.) Gentlemen, it needs no words-It needs no graceful terms. to tell you the estimation in which he in held by his fellow-townsmen. The assemblage which I see before mime, which has been brought together for the purpose of doing him justice and doing him honour, is far more eloquent than the most burnmg words or the most tbrilling thoughts. (Applause.) And, gentlemen, we are able to preseut to, that institution a portrait of my excelent friend by Sir John Watson Gordon; and there is a well-known sculptor (M'Dowell),'present at this momnent, who will be much mlore familiar with the lineaments of my friend's face than even I myself am before long. (Applause.) The portrait is to hang in the building of which he is the donor. His statue is to stand amOng the distinguished meo whom I see in some of the niohes of this magnificent hall (loud applause and cheers)-a tribute of respect froml the corporation and from the town. But although we shall poseess that portrait as a memorial of him, and though his statue will stand in one of those niches to convey to future geierations the lineameuts of him whom we have msernbled to honour, I trust it will be long before we part with the original (applause), and that it may please God in Iis bounty long to spare him, that he may still employ his great wealth in blessing others, with a fuil knowledge that those,blessingr will fall upon his own head a hundred fold. (Applause.) entlemen, I know that my.excellent friend loves not the language of eulogy, but still the pro. ceedings of this day comnpel me to use it. I, however, will say no more than this, that I call upon you with one heart and one voice to do justice to our eminent townsman. I simply, therefore, propose to you the health of William Brown, and I call upon you to do justice to itstanding, and to drink it in three tines three. (Immense cheering.)
Air :- " The Fine Old English Gentleman."
Mr. BROw.' then arose, amid great cheering, and said, --Mr. Mayor, ladies, my lords, and gentlemen,-It is impossible for ine to be otberwise than embarrassed and nervous to find myself tbus unexpectedly honoured in being asked to this iuagni6c nt banquet by my fellow-townsmen, to mark and conhnemorate the occasion which has brought us together, and still more so from the very flattering manner in which you, Mr. Mayor, have been pleased to mention my name. I am not vaimi enough to suppose that I deserve a tithe of what you have said. Laying the foundation stone of a Free Library naturally turns our attention to its educational advantages; and I trust all those who are desirous of improving their minds, and who in our prosperous town I hope are not fewv, will attend there, as knowledge is of the first and last importance to make useful and respectable members of society. Nothing contributes more to a man's happiness than to endeavour to make himself master of his respective caUing, and to cultivate a taste for scientific and literary pursuits. When we look round us, and see the advantages that arise from them, it is the duty of us all in our respective walks of life to aid them as far as lies in our power. No age of the world has been more productive than the last 100 years of that talent and that genius whioh have conferred the most important benefits on mrankind. Taking into view our commercial advantages arising fromn our mineral wealth, a climate most favourable to continuous labour, and our perfect freedom of action under a constitutional Government, I see no end to our onward progress if we avail ourselves of the advantages we possess. The more we advance the greater field we find for urther advancement. The more we know the better we see our way to obtain further knowledge. I have no pretensions to be a man of science or a mau of letters, but
hold in the highest estimation men who em Iy those talents with which they are blessed for the beneat of their fellowman. Our quays and our docks would cuta poorfigure withouttheaid of the botanist, thechymist,themecbanic, the esgineer, and many others whopursue usefulandphilosophical pursuits, which are every day maldng progress towards greater perfection; and we must all feel greatly indebted to those noblermen and gentlemen -who ale endeavouring to reconcile those unfortunate and unhappy differences of opinion among religious sects that have hitherto prevented a harmonious union for the general education of the people. Let us hope that those difficulties will soon be surmotnted. When we consider the intelligent arrangements of our Transatlantic friends who have accomplished that end, and the care taken by them for the education of every class, it can create no surprise, on reading the reports of the Royal Commissioners who were sent out to their Industrial Exhibition, to find the progress they have made in the useful arts of lif. We have obtained from them much valuable information and many mechanical improvemnents. We must exert ourselves in tbis honourable competition to preserve our oaste among the nations of the earth, by having an equaUy well-educated people. Science has already done much for us. It has made that gint power
steam, subservient to the use of man-I may say to bridge the ocean, and set at defiance both the winds and the waves and bas furnished this little island with a manufacturing power which could not be accomplished by the unaided manual labour of two Chinese empires, or 600,000,000 people. But what are we to say of a more recent application of a power which can carry a message for us at the rate of 188,000 miles in a minute ? It is not impos. sible that means may be found to make It a stil more powerful agent than steam. I hone and expect, before the year is out, we shall be able to send a mes8age from the Old World to the New as quick as thought. It is clear we live in an age of progress. ne lTimes announced the other day that tb is probable we shall not be dependant on raising silkworms for the production of that valuable raw material, as it has been discovered that it Is in the leaves of the mulberry tree, and can by a chymical process be obtained froni them to any extent. If this discovery can be carried out with economy, it may make a complete revolution in the use of cotton by the substitution of silk and we niay see our females clothed In robes that added to the dignity of a Roman Emperor. Discoveries of this Idnd fill us with wonder and amazement. They are due to advaucicg science, and I think clearly point out that there is yet an iumense field of enterprise open to the world. The long peace we had from 1815 to the commence. ment of the late Russian war was no doubt extremely favourable to human progress. Let us hope that our difficulties with China may be of short duration, and end in an honourable adjustment of our differences, and that peaceful commerce will continmu to extend, and carry Christianity and civilizatisn to every Part of the habitable globe. W'e cannot but feel ourselves in an enviable position that it has been our good fortune and our destiny to plant the Saxon race, with our language, our laws, our literature, and our religion, in some of the most rising countries in the world, who feel an honest pride in acknowledging our paternity, where family differences never should arise to disturb thatgood understanding andharmony which now happily everywhere exist, and which it is the duty of aU to cultivate and perpetuate. It is impossible for me to sit down without again assurin you, collectively and individually, that I duly appreciate the honour you are conferring on me. So long as I live I shall ever look back oa this day as oiie of the most happy and most pleasing of my life; and I again beg to sincerely thank you.
" The Health of the Members for South Lincashire (Mr. Brown and Mr. John Cheetham)" was drank. with three tunes three.
Mir. CIIEETRIAM, in responding, spoke in eulogistic term of Mr. Brown as a representative of the people, and as a man who had extended his beneficence in the manner they had witnessed that day. lei who struck off the fetters of the siave or enlarged liberty was a benefactor, but he was one of tho greatest beniefactors they could ha-ce who sought to elevate intellectually, morally, and religiously his fellow men. (Cheers.) He congratulated Mr. Brown, too, in being his own executor in this business and in thus showing a determination to perpetuate the instution, deivering it from all future chances of misappropriation, by connecting it with the Corporation of LiverpooL being in their hands it could not, without gross negligence in the citizens themselves, be diverted from its original object. (Cbeers.)
'The Members for the Borough" was given from the Chair, and received with applause.
MIr. T. B. HOItSFALL and Mr. BWAIT having responded, Mr. HORSFALL gave " The House of Stanley." (Cheers.) I am sure, be said, that the toast will be received by every one with that cordiality and with that admiration of the conduct of the Earl ot Derby and of Lord Stanley to vvhich they are so justly entitled. (Cheers.) This would
not be a fitting occasion on which to bring forward the records of history, where the House of Stanley has stood in an honourable and pre-eminent position for centuries past. It would still be a less fitting occasion to allude to the political eareer of the Earl of 2Derby, or of Lord Stanley; but I am quite sure that It is a fitting occasion for Liverpool gracefuUy to say to the soa
that they entertain the highest respect and regard for his illustrious father (loud cheers), one who takes so deep an interest in the welfare of Liverpool (hear. hear, hear), and which has been shown on no occasion more than on a recent one when he presented to the inhabitants
of this town a most magnificent collection of natual hlistory, now known as time Derby Museam. (Cheers.) Sir, I wi only venture to express one hope-one in which I am sure every individual in this building will oin, and tha is that the illnstrious head and the llustnous heir of the house of Stanley may long be spared, not as mere hereditary ornaments to our constitution (hear, hear), but that they may loog Ite spared to add, as I am sure they wil add, wisdom to our legislature, and exert their best energies for the prosperity of our c:untry. (Cheers.) I beg to propose to you " The House of Stanley."
The toast was drunk with enthusiasm.
Lord STANLEY, in repying, said,-My lords and gentle. men, I am afraid that Mr. HorsfUll might hove found the same fault with ma that the deputy-mayor has just now found witll one of your borough members. (Laughter.)

(Hear, hear.) If we are to go back to those old times-I believe it is now something mnore than 500 years ag-nearly one-twelfth of the whole recorded annals of the human race-since an ancestor of mine obtained a license fom the Crown to embattle and fortify a house, the site of which lies somewhere-I know not exactly where-buried nmong the crowded streeta and buildingp of this vast commercial capitaL There may be some vanity in such reminiscences of past times; but, standing here, I may be permitted to say that none can more rejoice, none can more exult in the present greatness and the glory of the town of Liverpool than these to whose forefathers were committed the charge of watching over its earlier and still undeveloped infancy. Gentlemen, we are told that society in the present day has changed, and in some respects it is so. (Hear hear.) Our improved mebns of communication everywhere, the rapidity with which transit is effected from one pt of the country to another, have done much to dispellocalreudcei and to destroy
rovincial peculiaritiea, But, though they may have destroyed prejud and houh they may have destroyed provincial peculiahies, though ther may have fused as it Were the various elements of these peculiarities into one similar whole, I do not believe that those characteristics of the present time have destroyed-I do not believe that they have materally weakened those ties of local attachment and local sympathy which are founded upon common interests with the present-upon commonremi
niscences of the past-when a mutual repository of friend. ship and good offlces plays so inmportant and valuable a part in our social system. (Cheers.) At lest' I know this, that in that political arena-the House of Commons-where my lot is chiefly cast, we who come from Iancashire, notWithstanding many diversities of public opinion and conduct -whatever may be the political ranks in which we serveare apt to look upon one another with feelings of mutual friendslhip and goodwill. (" Hear," and cheers.) We are proud, and justly proud, of the intelligenoe and activity of tat section of the population among which we are called ; we are proud, and we may weU be proud, of the vastinfluence which this county exercises over the counsels of the State (cheers); we are proud, and it is a reasonable pride, of the more than common proportion of eminent men whom Lancashire in the present century has contributed to the national service. (Hear, hear.) Aud, gentlemen, I think the ceremony which we have witnessed to-day shows us that we have something else of which we may be proud. (tear, hear.) Gentlemen, with what we see and know before us, it would be not merely an injustice, it would be not merely a calumny, it would be am absurdity, and a contradiction to palpable fact, were any one to assert that the great maritime and mercantile interests of England are less patriotic or less intere%ted in national affairs than any other class in this or any other country. (Cheeras) They have borne ungrudgiugly their share, and something more than their share, of the the public burdens. (Cheers.) They have never hesitated when, on such questions as peace and war, which sometimes arise,-they have never hesitated, when occasion called for it, to sacrifice their private interests to the general advantage of the country; they have not onlynot shrank from taking unon themselves the burdens and the responsibilities of property, but they have gone out of theirway to bear burdens which no other person could have laid upon them, and to undertake responsibilities which they might fairly and honestly decline to assume. ("Hear, hear," and cheers.) There are, gentlemen, I hope, and believe, many proprietors of wealth-perhaps I should say most of the proprietors of wealth-who regard that wealth as a trust, and who are wiling, more or less, to use it for the public service; but it is a peculiar advantage of those whose property is of their own creatig that tbey are enabled, Deing comparatively free from the claims which custom and society impose in the case of heriditary fortune-being more, in fact, the reasters of vwhat they possess, they are enabled, if such be their pleasure, to contribute far more larely and more directly to the requirements of society and of the public. (Cheers) That, gentlemen, is a great advantage, and nobly that advantagehas been used. (Eheers.) I will not weary you by repeating what, in one form of words or another, has been said a hundred times to-day ; I will only repeat in public what I said just now to Mr. Brown in private, that I envy him his feelings on this occasion. And I wil only add, that though, as we all know, he is well acquainted with the best modes of investing capital to advantage, I beliove he Will find that this last investment is the best he ever made. (Cheers.) The town of Liveroool may thank him for contributing what will be hereafter and in future always one of the principal ornaments of its streets; the friends of education may thank him for having given an impulse to the cause which puts to shame the comparative apathy both of indivduas and of public bodies elsewhere (cheers) ; but public men may think him, and England maythank him-and it is to this that I attach the greatest importancefor giving to those who are not possessors of wealth-to the poor and to the labouring classes of this country-a signal proof that wealth is viewed by those who possess it, not as a means of pleasure, not as an enjoyment of luxrry, but as one means among many of obtaining the respect and the gratitude of our fellow-d(tizesn8(ear, hear," and cheer8)-as one means among many of alleviating those hard thoughts and that envy which, In a country of occasional distress and unequal fortunes, will Inevitably arlse -as one means among miany of doing good and permanent service to England, and of promoting the proressive Improvement of mankind. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, if a ift liko that which we are this day celebrating had been obvloisl
dictated by any motives of ambition, you would acceptit with thanks, but you would feel that thegiver had had hi8 reward. (Hear, hear.) If, also, it were a posthumous benefaction you would think the donor entitled to your thanls, but you would feel that the gift had been made at no sacrifice of present enjoyment. (Hear, hear.) Bat, as it is, you are well aware that Mr. Brown can have no personal object or interest to serve, except, indeed, the wish that I apprehend Is felt in all generons minds-the wish of honourably connecting his rsame with the history of the community among whom his life has been passed. (Cheers.) He will see, we trust, the completion of his own liberality. (Hear.) He will live to witness the enjoyment which many thousands derive from the gift which we are celebrating this day. (Cheers.) Gent'lemen, some allusion has been made to an institntion with which a member of my family has some counexion, and which is called, I beliove, the Derby Museum. I am afraid that is, in point of magnitude, very unworthy to be compared with the gift of Mr. Brown; but I cannot help expressing the gratification that I feel on hearing that the two are to be coupled and connected together in the annals of this year. (Hear, hear.) Gentlemen, before I sit down let me express to you in my father's name his regret that it was impossible for him to be with gou to-day. (Hear, hear.) The cause in which we have all been speakingis one to which no eloquence can do snore than justice; and I can only express my sincere regret that you should not have been enabled to have his advocaoy instead of mine. (Loud cheers.)
MIr. J. C. BWART, MP., gave " The health of the Right Hon. Sir John Pakington." (Loud cheers.)
Sir JoHN PA}GTON, on rising, Was received with cheers. He said,-Mr. Mayor, my lords, and gentlemen, I !am deeply grateful for the kind and cordial reception which you have done me the honour of extending to one who personaDy is a stranger among you. I should be gaulty of affectation if I were to deny that I am both grateful for and gratified by the manner in which my hon. friend, the member for Liverpool, has so kindly, and, I fear, so par. tially, referred to my exertions on that great question, the education of the people. But, gentlemen, deeply thankful as I feel for this kindness on yonr part, I feel yet more grateful for the compliment which has been paid me in inviting me t attend here upon this occasion, and to be a witness of what I cannot but feel-with my mind altogether free from local bias or local partiality-one of the most striking, one of the most gratifying scenes which in my life it has ever been my lot to witness. (Loud cheers.) Gentlemen, it is true that I am one of those who think that the struggle between light and darkness, between ignorance and know. ledge, is not yet satisfactorily settled in this country. (Great cheering.) It is true that I am one of those who do very deeply feel that the condition of ignorance in which so large a portion of the population of this country, both in our crowded towns and in our rural districts, yet remains is no, only, as my hon. friend has said, a national disgrace, but it is a national danger. (Cheers.) Acting npon this conviction, itis trueI have endeayouredto arouse the feeling of Parliament and the feeling of the country into the belief that the time had come when prejudices should be b inished, and when difflculties should be trampled under foot (cheers); and that thus, by the exertion of that strong, energetic wil which Anglo-Saxons know well how so emso when -itin ocao cal the fot, en
to eniploT When fitgocsoScUte oessome scheme should be adopted to bring a sound education to every man's door. (Cheers.) Bat, gentlemen, I feel no less deeply thit any exertions, any humble exertionw, of mine 3 s direction, or of those who act with me inthis rat cause, are really as nothiug compared to that maniicent benevolence and generosity, that practial mode of giving while we are only struggling to achieve what the generosit
of myhon. friend has given. (Cheems) Iamgltofl2d that you thus welcome a sentiment w hchIsureyonI feel with true and heartfelt sincerity; and if anything coul
have added to the satisfaction and pleasure with which I, as an Englishman loving my cauntry, haln act which does honour to my country, it is teo see, as I have sees this morning, the mainer inwhich the peopleof Liverpool.appre-

The rev. Rector CAhieeso ti proposed "iThe health of Mr. William Ewait, the member for Doinfries. (Cheers.)
Mr. W. EWVART, M.P., in rising to respond, was vehemently applauded. He said,-My lords and gentlemen, at this period of the entertainment I shall not feel myself

This great town I hope is destined at some time or other to achieve something of the intellectual fame of Athens, while it will infinitely surpass the commedrcial tame of Carthage and of Tyre. Gentlemen. my right hon. friend Sir John.Vakdngton, and my rev. friend who has done ie the great honour of proposing my health, have alluded to some exertions of y own in this very cause of promo1
free libraries for the benefit of the people of this country i
confess, as mny right hon. friend has probably experienced it in the cause of education, it is somewhat of an arduous labour to force such a question through the Legislature of this ou And it may be compared to that sort of labouernhic is described by onte of our most emineent poets when he says -
-As Sthsus aga-ist the Infernal inteep
"Heaves the huge reck, whoEe motions ne'ar may sleep.
Such is the desiny of meany a man who tois in the cause of education. And yet, gentlemen, I recollect that, in the committee over which I had the honour to preside, there was one object over a l others which they laid down as desirable for the people of this country, and thatrwas, that they should haiv the power of educating themselves. Gentlemen, I am alEaost afraid sometimes in these days of public examinations, we may lay too much stress upon mere educational examination. I am for that sort of free scope being given to the le which may enable the people to form themselves by free and independent development, and not to impose upon themn to too great a degree the shackles of a sort of Government system of examination. ("Hear, hear,' and applause.) It has con tiuly said by Edward Gibbon, in the account of his own life,-" Society stimulates the intellect, but solitude is the nurse of genius." And it is my belief that more will be done by this free and public institution than by beaurocratie rules, borrowed from foreign countries,althoungh we mn y borrow rsomething from them with great benefit and good effect. Another
rinciple laid down by the Committee onePublc ibraries, of which I waschairman, was this, that therestablishment of such institutions would encourage the donations of private individuals- and here we se that principle exemplified in the Mustrhius example of ourn lstrious townsman. (Hlear, hear.) Gentlemen, I can conceive, as has been truly said by the noble lord who has honoured us by his presence, ad delighteld us, as he always does, by his observations this day, that no situation is more enviable to a citizen of this country than that of Mr. Brown at the present moment. But, Gentle. men, Mr. Brown stands not only before the presnt oeneration-he stands also before posterity; and he may enjoy the uestof all leasures, the sense of feeling his good acts will bfelt when he can no longer feel them. It is, perhaps,a sort of divine pleasure to feelwthat -when we aregone, and are no longer sensible to what passesin this world below, thereeanr othersion whom our deeds wil confer benefits
andothat sort of superior and almost divine pleasnre may be shared by these who do such deeds as this dAy have been done by our honoured felow-townsman, o r. Brown. (Applausei) Gentlemen, I will detainx you for one moment longer. There a others who have done good service in this great local act. There are those in your Town-council who have formed your Free Library Committee. Tiey have toied in silence, but they have toiled withagod effocn alsnd atmthe head of it, the chairman of the comnittee, is a gentleman with whom I have had the honour to consult on this important subjeot-I mean Mr. Picton (applause)t; and I propose to you, gentlemen, the health of the promoter, the advocate, and the friend of your local free library" oThe Health of Mr. Picton." (Applause.)
Thestoast was responde to with enthusiram.
Mr. PiCTof then rose and saidw-Mr. Chairman, I feel it diftfiult, if not impossible, to express myself adequately on the present occasion. To have hadtomy name thus pebicly brought forward and recognized in connexion with the proceedings of this day-a day, ever to be honourably remembered in the aunals of Liverpool-will be to the latest period of my life a subject of pleaing recollection. It is about seven years since the subject of a free
pu tblc libraryndat felt brought under the notice of the Town-conil ofe Atiserpool.eThe want of such an institutionhdng beenfl ; there needed but a voice to give utterance to the feelng. I only did what any one else might have done equally well or better. The result has been such as far to surpass the most sanguine expectations of all concerned. From this day begins a new phase in the history of the institution. A fit local habitation, is all that is wanted to elevate it to its proper rank; and this, thanks to the munificence of our noble townsman, we sha l soon
Permit me to say, in retring, that noone san =terwie, ofter future of England when we see the interest taken by the leading public men of all parties in institutions like these. To see on one platform aly le m Stanley, with his expensive and genBrous sympathie with every movement for the intellectual improvement of the rmeso; Sir John Pakington, who has nobly burst asder the ties of party in hiis efforts for the education of the people ; Wil-

Mr. Moi,cio-Nc cMirsea, M. rP., then rose andi said,M1r. Deputy Mayor and Gentlemeu;. it does not become one who has bee-n invited to this banquet to rofese anything, otherwise, after the interesting andt various- discourses you have beard, I should have thought it,hrdly became me to hicrease the number of your spesehes. Bab to any one who has.been interested in any way with the literature of his

P aoes not become me in such an aadience ae iis, and to s-sob a man as you, Sir,,-it doss not bneme me ta speak of the advantages ofednoation. It dosnot beomome to saeekto you of books,-you, who knnoAtheit value just as waa I do. I wonld ratxhr image to neyself, M3 Mayor, what vwuld have been the ieelings of a atranger eoming into thin city this noraing. and witnessing this sigular spectacle I think it posibl* he might hae said, -wen he saw ths bus mart of Live l auspendad_your shops shut, yowr active popu ltfonidling in the streets-he might have said, "'What is this for?" And when bo was told it was to celebrate the foundation of the library, be might have said, "What des Liverpool want with books? What does Liverpool, -whose population has been qua2upled in the time of Mr. Brown, want with the, researchesof hoay antiquity? What does wiverpool, ich iB making the histouy of England, want with reading history? What has Liverpool to do with ReographZ; when she can leaa Fby sending her ships, her noble fleets, forth to every sea on the glob-when she hears th* various languages in her streets and on the ships thatcrowd the Mersey?' But thetre have been among you ons who have another feeling, and who have felt L Liverpool could do good with books. Andvthe straze -might have told yon he had been in various cities anrl en historic sites -he had seen magnificent librariea lying together covered writh dust, unresd and unregraed -and he might have told you the costly libraries of Wenice did not prevent the decay of that great city, or mary other of the popuionus haunts of men. But ho might h4rve been answered, as Mr Brown would have answered hi3m, that these cities fell be cause they didnot knon how to combine the materi%i and moral elements of manlind-because they did not know how to bring t, gether tbe activity of daily life and the intellectual intprests which books can furnish and intellectual means " an supply. (Applauseu And, gentlemen, the library wl ich you are about to establish will not be one of those which lie hid in mnsty and nnnoticed bookcases, bait & hlbrary 'eIekL as a, monxetary 0irulatioik-
whioh will be current amjng the upeople. Your booksw wll be bils of hand, pessing trom h t to hand s-.--o interest wbererer tbey go-the best of intefest. (]p '
And if that stranger, whom I vas trying to bring before you, came from one of those ooantries of She globe which does not enjoy, as we do, the advantages of frew estitutmees, he might have been atonijebed at the aspect of the oelreba tion; he would have seen Tour flags flying, yopopulac
bhouting-all in bonour of one of Your private citizem. He would have seen the most spontaneous e£ t, of respect and veneration which a free na0ion could show to a free msn. And when you heard the salute &ing from your fort in honour of the Princem born yesterdiy, you were glad to eombine tho5e sounds with the shouts for the prince of the peope wbichbyou have heard to-day, (Applause.) Ad, gentlemen we xnt remember that this celebration has a meaning. There is a large population far away over the Atlantic-our brothers in anmther hemisphere. (ApplaUse.) I would eall Mtr. Brown a citizen of both worlds (hear, hemr), and is ny a crowded city of our brethren on the other side of the Atlantic will the celebration of this day be read. It is he and such s he who have brought together the two great countries of Bngland and America It is he xnd such ashe, before the electric wire had been laid down. underneath the aurisee of the, gret Atlantic, lying on a, rook which PBovidenc tseems to have raised for the specind purpose of uniting the two great empires-it is he anr such as he -who have brougt together these two nations by the elbctricity of comr n iAterest and common sympathy and feelin¢. It omy obct to bring before you and to drink the healtbof a.citizen of the great republic of the United States. That oonnexion. wkich Mr. Brown hs establishedlbetwel themateriintrestsr of England and America Natl;aniel Hawthorne has done much to cement. (Applause.) His " ScarktLettee has etruck te, the heat of every man with whom it came into contact, He has built his house of " Seven, Gables" in. every town, in Englhd, and as for his " TwLoe.told Talosi" we- well wIsh they bed been told ten times (Laughter and applause.) Gentlemen, therefore, in givini3yon tho heaitlth of tliat dim. tinguisbed citizen of tho Unittd Statfe, a2d' that i- tinguisbed citizen of the literatueof the world, D) believe yoU Will join with me, and that you.will feel-younare in no degree dev'iating from tbo special) purpo3e for which we have met together. (Applause M And those two great nations, speaking the same great speech, carying.ot in the main the same great institutions, are the hope and. the blesdng of mahniud-tho hope of the fature- world, and, underProvidence, a blessing to the nations. I give on "The United States of America.
The toast was enthusiasticaUy respoaded to,.
Mr. N. HAWTHORNE, United States? Consul, said,-hr. Mayor, my lords, and gentlemen, I appear in this hall before you, not in any individual capacity of my own, but as the representative of mycountry, ani especialli. of the literature of America; and I heartily wish, theb literary men of America had a better re resentativo-one vfho has done more for the cause of literature than I have done, and one who could have acknowledged better than I possibly can the honour that has bee:e conferred' mien them. (Cleers. The hon. gentleman who has aUded to me haa made allusions also to some productions of my own. That praise, gentlemen, is the more valuable, cOming asit does from one who is so eminently qpalified to express an opinion when a thing is well done. His praiso is very gratifying, for there is nothing in literary repuation so dear to an American as a, knowledge that he is considered worthy of commendation, in the land of his ancestors. (Loud cheers.) But, gentlemen r must not forget that I am not speakng here in myF ow behalf, but on behalf of the literature of my country, and on behalf of the literary men of Amerlca,-the poets, the historians, the novelists of America. I thank youk for I have no rght to decline any applause which ysa% may he pleased to award tothem, how much soever Imight feel inclined to decline that honour to myself individua.y (" Hear, hear," and cheers.) The circumstances of our country have directed much of our attention to the rough side of life, instead of to those softening influenes which. are favourable to literary productions ; but it is somaethingto me to think that we bave accomplished an act of grtitude-of heartfelt gratitude-to England. It is something to my countrymen to know tbat they have yet maintained the old Anglo-Saxon spirit, and that it has some hold upon them now in their literary pursuits. It gives me happmess to believe thIs, be. cause the more we return to you for the great measune of enjoyment that we have received from you the more we s aid yon in promoting peace and goodwill, in which I hope the two nations wiU ever contiaue, because every Ameican who has written books which Englnd is content to receive into her literature has contritted something to that excelUent result. Having responded to the toast which has been proposed, I might sit down, bh. I cannot do so, and You will pardon me ; for, as km been justly observed, had the ties been drawn but a little closer America would hase ceDed Mr. Brown heer son. (Cheers.) At all events, he has the conne.ion by blood, by friendship, by affection in aU the interests of life, which lwe shall not certainly forget, neither Will he. (Loud cheers.) It is good for our country that there should be such men-men connected with one country, and with another, and yet not the less true to their own Woved land. (Cheers.) It was proved, and not very long ago eitber, that it wss good for both countries that he was here (hear, hear) -that he gasped one in his right hand and the other In his left. :3ir,I assure him, on behalf of my fellow-countrymen, that we are always as proud of him as if he were one of us; we are proud of his good deeds, of his ill,strions Ihfe, and of his great acts of noble and enlightened bene. ficence. (Cheers.) This last is the deed conceived in the very spirit and done In the very spirit in which an enlightened benefactor should snek to benefit his country-by considering the means by wvhich he miiht best promote human happiness throughont the worla. Gnlmn
thank you. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I
Mr. BsiOxN gave the "HIealth of the Deputy-Mayor," and that gentleman having responded the proceedings terminated._
In the evening a 3oiree was ven at the Coeoeort4sal, Lord Nelson-street, by the orkcing classes, at which the following address was presented to lir. Brown:-
" Sir,-It is rarely that it fZlls to the lot ot any community to commem"orte an act of sech spontaneous munificence as that recently displayed by you In the foundatlon of a Free IAbrary and Museum fcr the use of your fellow-towsmen. Although we are aware that such actg ot generosity carry with them their own reward. and that your highest satisitncion will resut from the ooneclOuness of having noblY Performed what you conceived to be a publio duty, we canmot deny ourselae tho pleasure ot expressng our deep see of the benefit and blesAing which by that act you have confered upon us.
"The advantages of lostitutions such as that yonare bout to found It would be impossble to overrate. They are recognized as among the necessities of the age, and are epecially vnalble to such of us as are precluded by or limited meas from formlng librarie of ourown.
" Holdlng the general opinion of our feilow1-towncme, in this respect, Ie think ourselves fortinate that the locality choen for the con templated bistitution is within our own ward.
":Permit us, therefore, to tender you this sincere, thonGi impDrfect, expresion of our esteem aud gratitud4e and to add our DraSoe that your life may be spared to see the good vwork o0mpleted;, and to enjoy an earnest of tbose fruits of extended usefulnes which, under the blessing of God, we hope and believe it wiU proride."

[A portion of tho following appeared In our second edition of yesterdav :-1
PARIS, APRIL 15, 6 P.M.
The Grand Duke Constantine is expected at Toulon on the 20th or 21st. He will proceed at once to Marseilles on board of the Reine Hortense, and review the fleet and examine the docks and arsenal. The next day he will proceed to Lyons, but will not, I believe, stop there any time; he will pass the night at Chalons-sur-Saone. He intends to inspeet with much attention the well-known foundries of the Creuzot (Saone-et-Loire). He will be here about the end of the month and will take up his quarters at Fontainebleau, where great preparations are being made to receive him and his suite.
General Todtleben has presented the Emperor of the French with a copy, magnificently bound, of his journal of the siege of Sebastopol, kept by himself day by day. This most interesting diary is written in Russian, with a French translation on each page. The Minister of Marine had a brilliant reception last night, at which numerous Russian officers were present.
The Committee of Defence, which is composed of military men of high rank, on the question of the projected lines of railroad in Russia being brought before it, have, I am assured, expressed the opinion that these lines of communication are of a decidedly strategic charaeter, and that, by the facilities they afford,from85,000 tolOO,000menoouldbetransported from various points of the empire to Kaffa in eight days. The con,ession for thes^e lines was obtained by M. de Moray.
General Bourbak-i, who served in the Crimean war, and who was wounded at the battle of the Alma and at the Malakhoff, has been appointed to the command of a division at Constantine. General M'Mahon, who had an audience of the Emperor yesterday, left Paris this morning to take the command of a division of the army in Algeria. The division will take part in the expedition against the Kabyles, which is to coinmence on the 10th of May. In military circles some importance appears to be attached to this expedition, as, if successful, tending to consolidate or perhaps extend the French power im Africa. It will, at all events, give occupation to a large body of the army, which it may not be politic to leave idle.
Accounts from Bucharest of the 6th state, that two days before a deputation of landed proprietors, advocates, and several young boyards of high station, paid visits to the Commissioners of the Europeau Powers. On this occasion the following address was presented to Sir Henry Lytton Btilwer*.
'Excellency,-The Reoumans welcome with delight In you the worthy representative of free England -the Envoy of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen of Great Britain. They indulge in the firm hope that your presence among them will powerfully oontribute to deliver them from all restraint, and thereby secure to them an unshackled manifestation of the wishes of the country, with entire independence in the elections. We have the greater right to expect an attentive oare on the part of the Commissioners in the applioation of the electoral law, as we have not taken any part in drawing it up. We have too long lived without liberty for abuses not to be rife, particularly at a distance from the capital. We solicit the attention of your Excellency to this point. We take great pleasure in reminding you that at the Congress of Paris the representative of Her Britannic Majesty was the first to strongly insist on the necessity of taking into account the free wishes of the country; and from what Power can we expect this elec. toral independence, which is so necessary for us, if not from that one which has had the happy privilege of enjoying for ages the benefits of free institutions ? Your Excellency, who have shown yourself everywhere and at all times the warmest defender of liberty of conscience, as also one of the most constant supporters of representative government, cannot fail to secure that liberty in our country. We pray you, therefore, to accept the sentiments of hope and of gratitude which we offer you in the name of our countrymen of al classes."
The following reply was made by the Euglish Commissioner:-
" Gentlemen,-I have listened attentively to the words 'which you have just addressed to me, and my first duty is to thank you for all the obliging sentiments you have expressed towards my country, my Government, and myself. With regard to the question to which you particularly call my attention,-namely, the elections which are shortly to take place, the Ottoman Government has declared its intentions in the most solemn and precise manner, and, arriving direct from Constantinople, I am able to assure you that the Sublime Porte desires with sincerity what it has declared without hesitation. I iuiut also believe that the Government of this Principality, at the head of which is placed a prince whose family is one of the illustrations of your annals, and who, from his reputation for frankness and straightforward conduct, was pointed out for the confidence of the Sultan, will, in such a critical moment, execute the instructions it has received with scrupulous fidelity. Such is cer. tainly its du'y. On the other hand, itisfortheWallachian people, and especially for you, gentlemen, whose position in the centre of society should maintain a proper equilibrium in it, torender,by the prudent abilityof yourconduct, thetask imposed on the authorities easier. No one doubts your inteUi. gence, that gift of Heaven is visible on all the faces which surround me, bat experience alone enables what is difficult to be distinguished from what is impossible, thseory from practice, and so it is permitted to doubt if, in circumstances as novel as they are difficult, youa win have aU the prudence, all the moderation, and all the tact which (believe on that point an Englishman, proud of the epithet which you have accorded to his country) every nation which is desirous of enjoying the advantages of a liberal government and a representative system should possess. Employ, then, I beg of you, aU your efforts to make yourselves remarkable by these virtues and these civic talents, which, perhaps, are what is the least expected from you, but which will confer on you the greatest amount of honour, and which wil unite the esteem and confidence of Europe to the sympathy with which you have already known how to inspire her. All the members of the commission of which I form a part will, I am persuaded, regard with atten. tive impartiality all that may pass either far from or near to the capital; and viUl act in common accord, and in con. formity with their instructions, in all circumstances which may attract their attention, and which may appear contrary to the spirit which has dictated their mission. For my own part, gentlemen, you may be certain that I wil always add good intentions to the zeal and enlightened experience of my colleagues."
A few more arrests were, it is said, made yesterday and the day before. I have not noticed the various stories, some of them extravagant enough, which have been current about these arrests. It is hardly necessary to say that secret societies never wholly disappear in France. They may be more or less quiet-more or less dangerous-more or less withdrawn from the public eye, but they do not cease to exist, and their influence is never wholly unfelt. When a certain time elapses, and when a movement is observable, the authorities think it useful to lay their hands on a few dozens. To do this it is necessary to entice them out of their hidingplaces, as rats are coaxed out of their holes. In the meantime the traps are prepared, and as the conspirators become visible or tangible they are caught when least aware of their danger. The rateatehera in the present instance have been rather successful, though it is probable that at least one-third of the arrested are agents of the secret police. I believe these arrests to be nothing more than one of those sweepings which take place every now and then. The principal charge against the persons now in custody is for conspiring with a view to an attempt on the person of the Emperor. M. Treilhard isthe magistrate who is charged with investigating, the of 'eces of which they are accused.
The 1Momiter publIshes the official return of the taxes and indirect revenue for the first quarter of 1857, as compared with the corresponding period of 1856. The items which show the greatest improvement are .-Duty on potable liquors, 3,655,000f.; import duty on different merchandise, 3,381,O0Of.; ditto on foreign sugar, 1,480,000f.; duty on that manufactured of beetroot sugar, 1,267,000f.; sale of tobacco, 1,935,000f.; registration dues, 727,000f.; salt duty (consumption), 458,000f.; stamp duty, 403,000f.; import duty on French colonial sugar, 329,000f.; sale of gunpowder, 271,0OOf. ; Post-office, 103,000f. ; import duty on corn, 46,000f.; navigation dues, 43,000f.; transmission of money, 13,000f, The only items of revenue whieh show a faling off are-Conveyance by malles postes, 32,000f. ; sundry Customs' duties, 20,000f.; and accidental receipts, 19,000f. On these returns the Moniteus' remarks as follows :-" It results from these figures-1. That
*produce of the first quarter of 1857 exceeds by 1,202,000f. that of the corresponding quarter of 856. 2. That this augmentation would have been 16,886,000f. if the year 1856 had not been leap year. 3. That in this increase the month of March stands for 7,170,OG0f."
The arrivals of wheat at Marseilles on the 13th
amounted to 35,000 hectolitres. During the last week the quantity was 125,000 hectolitres. Price3 were ln consequence tending downwards.
The following private telegraphic despatches have been receivedB A
-BERN-B. AramL 14.
"The Bund declares that it can affirm from a certain source that the Federal Council bas never consented, as afflmed by some journals, to admit as just the payment of an indemnity by Switzerland to the King of Prussia. ' It is possible,' adds the Buand, ' that the Plenipotentiaries may have admitted that condition into the project of arrange. mnet, but Switzerland has not given her consent to this cornbination. The Government of Berne, on the contrary, maintains its first opinion not to pay anything as an indemnity.'
" The same journal declares that a direct u4derstanding betwoon Prussia and Switzerland is imposible, and expres the opinion that probably the Plenipotentiaries will draw up a project of arrangement, which they will propose separately to each of the two Powers interested."
" COPENHAGEN, ApsIL 14, EVENING.
"The Faedrelandet announces that the King has succes. sively called on M. Bluhme, and afterwards on M. Tilliach, to form a Ministry. It is said that the former has refused, but the answer of the latter is not known.
"It is not probable that the old Ministry will remain in office."

" The Minister of the Interior informed the Minister of Finance, under date of March 8, that His Majesty the Em.
peror, on the representation of the Minister for Foreign I Aiairs with regard to the nue¢ssity, in consequence of the
abolition of the Sound Dues, of issuing fresh quarantine ' regulations for vessels coming through the Sound to our ports in the Baltic, has boen graciously pleased, in accordance with the resolution of the Committee of Ministers on the 19th of February of this year, to command:-
" ' 1. In future neither receipts for the payment of Sound Dues nor Danish quarantine certificates ar to be required of vessels as indispensable to their admission into our Baltic ports.
1' '2. It is to be made incumbent on all captains of vessels entering the said ports with cargoes to provide themselves at the port where they take in their cargoes with certi ficates attested by our consular agents as to the satisfao. tory sanitary state of the neighbourhood whence they come, or else procure for themselves quarantine certificates in such French, English, Dutch, or Norwegian ports as they may be obliged to put in to; with the proviso always, that these documents be attested by our consular agents; and that
"' 3. These regulations are to remain in force only for the term of this year, should the state of the public health during that period remain as satisfactory as it is at present.,' '
Advices from St. Petersburg state that the Grand Duke Constantine will prolong his stay abroad until the Emperor commences his trip to his western provinces and to Warsaw. The Grand Duke's longest stay will be made in France, where he will inspect the ports, dockyards, and fleet, and subsequently visit the Imperial Court at the Tuileries. There is no mention anywhere of the Grand I)uke's visiting England. The expectation that the Grand Duke Michael wifl, immediately after his marriaoe, take the StadthoLderabip cf Poland gais strength and consistency; the presence of Prince Gortachakoff in St. Petersburg, whither he has brought the usual annual report of his administration of the past year, is being made use of, as is believed, to make the last arrangements for relieving the Prince of a burden of office from which he has long since desired to be delivered. The Belvedere Palace, in Warsaw, is being put in order, as is thought, for the future residence of the Grand Duke Michael and his bride, but it is not by any means impossible that these are preparations selely for the approaching visit of the Emperor; there is also another palace being got ready for him in St. Petersburg, but of this it is said that it is to be used by him only occasionally when he comes up to the capital of the empire. The Grand Duke Nicholas, on the other hand, is about to purchase a large estate in Lithuania, at present the property of Prince Leo Radziwill, AdjutantGeneral of the Emperor, and it seems to be his intention to reside there from time to time.
ITle lmperial family have come to the rescue of the railroad speculators, and have not only purchased a considerable number of shares, but have done it in such a way that aU Russia may understand it is expected that the rest of the nation shall follow the example. At present the ardour of loyalty and speculation seems not to have manifested itself to any great extent; while, on the other hand, the shares of other companies, whose prospects of a remunerative return are somewhat brighter, meet witlh a ready sale. For instan0ce a small company has been formed under the name of Hydrostat, for the purchase of an unexpired term (seven years) of a patent taken out by a countryman of ours named Peterton, for raising sunken and stranded vessels and cargoes on the coast of the Bay of Finland.
Two members of the Volhynian nobility, name I Rosenthal and Chavrousld, have been sentenced to the loss of their rank and deportation to the furthest confines of Siberia, for having excited the serfs of the estate Volnianka, in the government of Eieif, against their lawful lords and masters, while the first named had further added to the heinousness of his crime by writing and publishing a work of an excitiun nature, and subsequently made an attempt at suiicide. This is probably the only authentic information we shall ever get about the insurrection of the serfs in the western provinces, of which we heard some very magnified reports about two years since.
The promise which the Emperor made in September of last year, that the inhabitants of Bessarabia and New Russia should be indemnified for the losses the war had caused them, has at length been put in the way of fulfilment. A special commission is to be nominated, to sit in Odessa and examine the claims for compensation sent in; the GovernorGeneral Strogonoff, who is now on a journey connected with this business, has already received 500,000rs. for the purpose of meeting the most urgent clains; and the YMinister of the Interior has been empowered to open a general subscription to this end throughout the empire. These two provinces are further to receive from the State a dispensation from all taxes and duties for two years, as well as a remission of arrears. The Taurian Peninsula, as having suffered still more, is to be treated still more liberally, and be liberated from all im. posts-Sebastopol for 10, Kertch, Eupatoria, and Balaklava for five years to come. Out of the 80 vessels which the Russians sunk in the barbour of Sebastopol, 16 have already been raised,-the Chersonese steamer, of 200-horse power, four transports, one brig, two schooners, two tenders, and siX smaller craft. The Chersonose is being repaired at Nieholaleff. The four transports are already in ful acivity on the Black Sea, in addition to six sailing transports, and a few steamers of from 60 to 103-horse power, The naval, force there lately received an addition of five screw schooners, which are to be employed in cruising along the eastern coast of the Black Sea, and conveying rntgried of war. t
A good many accldents have occurred at Sebastopol and the neighbourhood from the unexpecte4
bursting of shells, which had been extracted from the earth, into which they had plunged short of the Russian position; the duty of bursting, which these projectiles seem to have omitted on falling into the soft ground of the earthworks they appear to have been over ready to fulfil now tht they are no longer wanted. In consequence of these accidents it has been forbidden to bring any of these inopportunue guests into the town, and the local authorities have appointed a proper person to collect all the old twice-cast iron outside the town, and strict orders have been given that any other person finding any shot, shell, or other spent ball, shall not meddle with it.
Tenders for the conveyance of large quantities of iron from the 'Ural foundries for the use of the shipbuilding works at Nicholaieff have been advertised for in the Latter town. The iron consists of lighter and heavier articles,-rods and plates, or, on the other hand, anchors, &c., and the total weight
amounts to 228,438 pouds. The ironworks deliver I the goods at Dubowka, on the Wolga (but how they get them there is not explained), and the contractors for the transport are to remove them thence by land to a place called Kalatschinsk, and thence down the Don and through the Sea of Azoff, along the coast of the Black Sea, up the Bug, to Nicholaieff.
News has been received in St. Petersburg of the new Bessarabian frontier having been marked out on the 15th of Marob, and the ceded territory having been evacuated on the 19th. These events had been followed also by the retirement of the English fleet from the Black Sea on the 29th.
Since the last-mentioned expedition of the Russians on the left wing of their Caucasian position in the direction of the Great Tschetschna there was a second undertaken on the 9th of February, for the purpose of keeping open the clearing tihey had commenced making on the former occasion through the forest towards the Aul Hortun. Oa this occasion also Schamyl ordered his people to obstruct the Russians; in consequence much human life was sacrificed in a vsariety of skirmishes; the Russians maintain that this time they have attained their end, though at a loss of two officers killed and 11 privates wounded.
STATE OF TURKEY.

CO STANOPL, ApRs 6.
On Thursday last, 150 Poles, soldiers of the late Polish Legion, embarked on board a Turkish steamer for the mouth of the river Salemvria, the ancient Peneus, in Thessaly. The far-famed Vale of Tempe will afford a refuge to these men, who have been subsisting on the generosity of the Turkish Government since the close of the war. They will form an agriculturalcolonyon the estatesof Redschid Pasaa, the Grand Vizier, who owns almost all that part of Thessaly. Redehid Pasha has granted to them, on most liberal conditions, lands, cattle, seeds, and agricultural implements, and will also make the necessary advances in money to enrble them to wait for the produce of a harvest, when they will be able to take care of themselves. By the kind solicitude of Count and Countess Zamoyski, the wives and families of such as have any will shortly come out to join them in the colony; and to provide wives for the remainder, a certain number of Catholic Slavo-Bosniac families will be admitted into the colony on the same conditions as the Poles, provided they each bring with them two marriageable young women. The Poles Will form a distinct commune, under the laws of Turkey, and will be under the spiritual care of the Abb6 Caczanowski, late principal chaplain to the legion. RedschidPasha has undertaken to erect a hospital and a church and parsonage at his own expense, and will also build suitable houses for the colonista. Every care has been taken to insure the moral and material prosperity of the colony; and, as the lands allotted are of great fertility and very salubrious, there is every prospect of its prosperity. Such of the Poles as preferred remaining in the military career have been incorporated in a regiment of Dragoons lately created* for the guard of the Turkish and Greek frontier, so much infested by brigands.
The British fleet has passed the Dardauelles aud arrived in Smyrna. As soon as the Turkish Government received thisintelligence it issued a circular to announce that the Dardanelles are henceforth closed to ships of war of all nationm that are not provided with a special firman for going through, thus re-establshing the rule in existence before the war.
Letters from Crete announce that the anniversary of the proclamation of the Hatti Humayoun had been celebrated there with great solemnity by the population and by the Governor, Vely Pasha. Under the intelligent rule of Vely Pasha this island is everydaybecoming more and more prosperous, and improvements are introduced unknown not only in other parts of the empire, but even in the capital. Thus, the streets are lighted in the three principal towns-Canea, Retimo, and Candia, and a police has been created in the-island on the model of the London police. An English engineer, Mr. Lionel Woodward, has also been employed to make a plan for the reconstruction of the town of Candia, recently destroyed by an earthquake, and to lay down a road connecting the three principal towns one to another. As it is necessary to pay for every improvement, of course the Government has met with some opposition among the less enlightened inhabitants of the island; but one would never have expected to find at the head of the malcontents opposed to progress the Consul of France. Her Majesty's ship Gladiator was in Suda-bay by the last accounts, having taken to Candia Mr. Coxe, of Oxford, who is making researches for old manuscripts in the Greek convents in the East.
SPAIN.
(FROM OUP OWN oos0RRoDiMT.)
MADRID, APRIL 9.
Espartero has sent to the Barcelona newspapers copies of a letter or manifesto addressed to the electors of that city who voted for him in the late elections, thanking them for their support, and explaining his political conduct. The journals announce their intention of publishing the document if they can obtain permision; meanwhile its essence has been given by a Lthographic sheet published in Madrid, and which is supposed to receive occasional information from Government. Accord. ing to this r6sum-, which there are grounds for believing to be correct as far as it goes, Espartero resigned office because the Queen declined his proposal to accept the resignations of both Escosura and O'Donnell, and insisted on retaining O'Donnell. Hls counsel being thus rejected, Espartero considered that he could not, consistently with his dignity, continue at the head of the Government. Having resigned, he says that he declared, fist through the raedium of an intimate friend and afterwards in person, his opinion that the National Guard should not show itself hostile to O'Donnell's Government until that Government should have shown by its acts that it was the enemy of the liberties conquered by the revolution and of the laws passed by the Constituent Cortes. When, notwithstandin
this expression of his opinion, the Madrid Nationals, by the agreement of its chiefs, assernbled^, and the contest began, he declares that
he made the most terrible sacrifice by rerm,aining passive at the moment that he beheld in confict the two great principles-Liberty and Monarchyto the defence of which he had devoted his life. He saw plainly that, whichever of those two principles gained the day, the result would be fatal to one or both of them. He foresaw that if, in a decisive struggle, the National Guard was vanquished, liberty would perish by the excesses of the reaction, and that the blood of his best frienis would then have flowed in vain. If, upon the other hand,the revolutionary party triumphed, the revolution would go beyond the point to which he had desired to conduct it ; it would sweep away the throne, he should be powerless to rescue the monarchy, and its overthrow would justify the calumnious accusations of which he had so long been the object, and which supposed him capable of designs agaiust the throne of Isabella II., for whose support he had so repeatedly shed his blood on the field of battle.
It had been announced that, independently of the customary feetwashing, the Queen would this Holy Thursd.ay visit on foot, in procession, the principal churches in Madrid. Last night it became known that counter orders had been given, and that neither of these ceremonies would take place. The procession to the churches is by no means of regular annual occurrence, but the washing of the eet of 12 poor men and as many women on Good Friday
has been regularly performed by the Sovereig.ns of Spain for a very long period, and has not been omitted probably within the memoryof any now living. the unusual and sudden decision of Her Majesty has therefore caused a great deal of con-
versation, and has given riso to many Conjectures and reports, some of them silly enough. Democratic conspiracieu,projecteddistuxbances, even an intended attempt at 555&55Uh1tiohs are among the gravest reasonsalleged. It if perhaps quite as kasoaable to attribute the deviation fromn established -usage to a woman's caprice, or to a sUdden fluctuation of the Royal humour. The usual dinner, clothes, and alms will be given to the poor persons who had been designated to have their feet washed by the Queen.
The Gaztt publishes a complete and general amnesty for all persons implicated in the Carlist conspiracies and rections of the last two years.
Letters froithatalonia represent the cotton manufactures of that province to be in a very depressed state, and attribute this partly to the extensive ssnuggllng carried on and partly to the apprehensions entertained of a reform in the Spanish ta There can be little doubt that free trade doctrines are gainng partisans and advocates in Spain, but as yet we do not see our way to a Government that would venture on such reforms to any realy important extent.
You will, perhaps, have already learned by a more direct route that a portion of the Spanish creditors in Mexico, representing upwards of 2 500 000 dollars in the convention have addressed tleM7exicanGovernment, settingforththat, as it has admitted their credits to be good, they wish to receive the 8 per cent. of the Customs revenue, as stipulated in 1853 in the treaty with S,pain. The Mexican Government has agreed tolthis, and has ordered the funds in question to be paid over to the person emnpowered to act for those creditors, who, it appears, have w/ithdrawrn their powers from 3Jarrera, the general agent, of whose conduct they do not approve. It is thought that this measure of the Government will contribute to the settlement of the question, since it must be takenas evidence that Mexico hasbeen and is ready to satisfy valid claims, while she insists on the revision of the doubtful ones, in accordance with the Government of Spain.
Members of the present Spanish Cabinet positively denythe truth of a recent report that extensive changes were to be expected in its composition, but admit that slight modifications may posibly take place before the meeting of the Cortes.
AprIL IL
It appears that the Court physicians have " indicated the probability"' that the Queen is in an interesting situation, and that this was the reason why the ceremonies in which she was to have taken the principal part on Holy Thursday and Good Frday were counter-ordered.
A semi-official paper announces the conclusion of the long-looked-for postal treaty between England and Spain. It ought to be a good one, for it has been long enough negotiating, owing to the interminable delays habitual toSgpanish Governments, which seem to have a special talent for raisn difficulties where none exist. The decision of the French Government as to the rate of postage on letters passing thraugh France is all, it is said, that is now wanting to enable the parties to the treaty finally to conclude it.
Tne report that Don Jose Concha would come to Spain to take his seat in the Senate is contradicted. Considering the pending discussion with Mexico, it would certainly not be a convenient time for him to absent himself, although General Lemery, whose judgment and exertions while Captain-General of Porto Rico have won him good opinions on aU sides, as well as the warm approbation of the Government, would be an excellent and highly competent substitute. But a change would have its inconveniences until the affair is settled with Mexico, and, moreover, General Lemery, who so lately left one West Indian Island on account of the state of his health, might be indisposed so soon to set out for another.
The Fenix, the Rianzareg paper, puts forward Senor Mon as President of the Congress. He is expected to return to Madrid in time for the opening of the Cortes. Notwithstanding all the overtures made to him by Narvaez, he is not likely to join the present Government. It would be less siurprising to see him, on afuture day, the coHleague or O'Donnell, to whom he is well inclined. But, according to present appearances, we shall have a retrograde Cabinet before that combination comes round.
The religious ceremonies and constant churchgoing of the last few days have distated attention from politics. Yesterday no newspapers were published, and those of to-day are devoid of interest.
Royal Italian Opera.
POYAL ITALIAN OPERA.
Nomu was given last night, with Grisi, grand, energetic, and passionate as ever, in the part of the Druidess; all the fine points-from the trio, in which Pollo is overwhelmed, to the duet, where, touched by the heroic self-sacrifice of his abandoned wife, the erring Proconsul insists upon sharing her fate-telling with an effect that years have been wholy unable to diminish. The performance was a triumph of histrionic and lyric art from beginning to ead, and the enthusm as genuine as if the audience had never been moved before by the same admirable exhibition. After each act there was a unanimous recall, and at the end of each striking display unbounded applause. In fact, Grid is stil the Norma, her successor having yet to appear.
Signor Gardoni, recovered from his cold, sang the music of the faithless Pollio with the utmost feeling and sensibility; and Madamoisele Marai, who made her rentr6e in Adalgisa, was received with the favour due to her undoubted talents. We have frequently had occasion to reimark that no one has undertaken a certain class of characters, second in nominal rank, but of the highest im. portance to the general effect of operatic performances, with such legitimate succeas as this young lady, since the secession of lademoiselle Amilia Corbari (in 1850) deprived the Royal Italian Opera of the most accomplished and admirable of comnimimar-i. The part of the High Priest, Oroveso, was sustained with distinguished ability by Signor Tagliafico. On the whole we have not witnessed a more efficient performance of Norm= for some time. The orohestra and chorus were perfect; and even Signor Soldi, the most earnest and prominent of Flavios', surpassed him. self in zeal. There was a fashionable attendance, and the performance afforded unqualified satisfaction.
In our notice of the alterations and improvements in the interior of the house we should have mentioned the abolition of those pigeon holes (pleasantly denominated boxes) on a level with the gallery, which were not only useless for general purposes, but a positive eyesore, on account of their extreme ugliness and architecturally illogical position. The removal of these uncomfortable and unsightly enclosures bas been welcomed on al sides with approval, and the aspect of the salle is materially improved by their absence.
The Boiler Explosion At Leebrook.
THE BOILER EXPLOSION AT LBEBROOK.
LEEBROOX1, Arpm _5.
The inquest on the bodies of the two women, Bridget Fox and Julia Flinn, who were killed by the explosion of a boiler at Messrs. Bagnall's works on Saturday, as reported in T7ie Times of Tuesday, was opened last week before Mr. Hinchliffe, coroner.
Mary Churok identified the bodies.-The deceased woman had her leg blown off, and her head smashad to pieces.
Solomon Lees was at work on the premises, heard the explosion, and saw the boiler blown up m the air. Did not see any of the engineers at work that morning.
Henry Wood, another workman, deposed that the engineer who had been on all night was present when the explosion took place. The engine had been started, but had stopped about 10 minutes when the explosion took place.
David Sill, manager of the works at Messrs. Bagnall's, at Leebrook, deposed that there were three boilers at work, and that two enginears-one for the night and the other for the day-were employed. Their names were Eobert Turner and William Cartwright. The boilers were low-pressure condensing boilers, with two safety-valves in each of them, ana were connected by a steam-pipe. The ex-
loded boiler was put up three years ago; it was then new. t' had been blown into four pieces. Both engineers were present-they were just changing-when the explosion took place. The exploded boiler was repaired a month ago. There were no stays to the boiler. Had since examined the plates, which presented no appearance of having been heated. The nvets were torn through in some places, and the solid plates in others. Some of the plates were half an inch thick, the others not so thick. Could give no explanation of the explosion.
William Cartwright, also employed at the works, said, the pressure was not more than 191b. to the square inch, whereas the boiler would bear 501b.
The inquest was adjourned to obtain evidence as to the cause of the explosion.
STRINGB MAnRTAGE.-A correspondent of the Abingdon Virginian, writing from Marion, Smythe county, r,lates a singular case of mara. He says -"We have within half a nile of this place a person who has remained in one position (flat on his back) for 16 years or more. His joints are as stiff as if he never had any. He can move bis head slightly, can move his hands a little, is unable to eat a single mouthful unless pu' into his mouth is fat, very hearty and cheerful, and within the last two years has married a goodlooking and merry girL The clergyman who married this nLan aid he had some scruples about it until he had a long conversation with both the parties. He saw they were etontvwg married. The young lady stood by the bed of the groom, as she could not take his hand, or he could not reach it out, and they were made one."
Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MTONBY-MABKTand CITYINTZLLIGANCg.
Thuracdy Evening.
The English funds opened this morning with a less unsteady appearanco, and subsequently experienced an improvement of an eighth. Consols for money were first quoted 92g to J, whence, in consequence of purchases on the part of the public aud the nonadoption of any further restrictions by the Bank they advanced to 921 to J. For the 7th of May the last price was 93i to J. During the morninag the market was aided by a considerable sum having been lent on Government securities at 6i per cent. for two months. The Bank also maade some loaus for the extended term of a fortnight at 7 per cent., but their practice from day to-day wiU depend entirely on the state of the demand. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 215; Reduced, 911 to i; New Three perCents., 9l to J; India Stocl, 221 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to i; and India Bonds, 10s. to 5s. discount. In the existing state of the discount-market there is a total absence of demand for Exchequer-bills, and the Barch descriptions were quoted 5s. discount to par. Unless an easier condition shall soon be experienced, the Chancellor of the Exchequer may therefore have to consider the desirableness of an increase in their rate to keep them marketable.
There was again a very active demand for money to-day both in the discount-market and at the Bank. It is believed there were no receipts or withdrawals of gold.
Foreign ecurities continue depressed, but quotations were rather more steady towards the close. In Turkish Six per Cents. the transactions took place at 93S for money, aud 94£ and + for the account. Mexlcan was dealt in at 23g; Brazilian Five per Cents., 10O; Chilian Three per Cents., 79; Peruvian Three per Cents., 5M; Sardinian Five per CentL, On; Spanish New Deferred, 25; Spanish Certificates, 69 and J per cent.; Venezuela, 36&; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 99; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 96g.
The final quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 70c. for money and 70f. 10c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of about a quarter per cent.
The letters from Paris mention a slight diminution in the demand for discounts. The contemplated increase of the capital of the Bank of France in order that it may be advanced on Rentes appears little else than a loan of 4,000,0001. in disguise.
The perpleiities of the money-market seem greater than over. For many months persons have been looking to the present period as that at which some turn in the unfavourable course of our bulLion balances mig,ht be expected, and instead we have the Bank reverting to almost its highest rate of discount, while its stock of gold is reduced to a point lower than at any time in the last 10 years. The question is, can this sudden increase of pressure be attributed to temporary causes, or is it only a regular stage of a condition which has already existed for two or three years, and must now be considered permanent ? On the favourable side we have the fact that, looking at the course of a great number of years, the rate of discount in England averages about 4 per cent., and that consequently any advauce beyond this point has always hitherto been followed by a proportionate reaction; next, that the trade of the country has for the last 27 months been of unprecodented magnitude and healthypin nearly every department; next that, notwithstanding the profits thus made, there has been an unusual abstinence from speculative commitments either at home or abroad; and, finally, that the agricultural retarns of the kingdom have for the last two years, to say the least, been perfectly satisfactory. With a profitable export business, an economical expenditure, and a good yield of home produce, the circumstance that the balance of cash payments between ourselves and the rest of the world is uninterruptedly against us seems an extraordinary anomaly. Last year the conviction that our position in these respects could lead only to a rapid improvement in our moneymarket was so strong that the most persevering warnings were necessary to prevent the public from at once running wildly into every description of foreign adventure, and their sur. prise, therefore, may well be great, when, after 12 months' continuance of such prosperity, they find themselves increasingly in debt to other nations. The chief explanation offered is that the great commercial developement consequent upon the gold discoveries and other causes has created a demand for capital beyond all former experience. This, however, is little better than a superficial assumption. There has been no unexpected addition to the population of the world nor any conversion of nations from barbarism to civilization to warrant the belief that our mercantile transactions have been suddenly forced to such magnitude that our entire yearly gains are insufficient to supply the extra capital requiSite for carrying them on. The Australian discoveries are now aix years old, the population of those colonies is still insignificant, a large portion of them continue their old avocation8 of producing wool and taUoW, and the occupation of the remainder who are engaged in gold-finding can have no material effect either In increasing or diminiahing the wealth of the world, or in leading to an alteration of the rate of interest, however extraordinary may be its influence on the other relations of property. It is true that our exports last year were 20,000,000L- above any recent average, and that an augmentation is still taking place, but commercial men know with what a slight increase of actual money an improved trade to this extent may, in timeswhen credit is perfectlysound, be carried on. A large part of the addition, moreover, is merely consequent upon higher prices, and, although these involve a proportionate increase in the movements of capital, their effects are in most cases balanced in the course of a few months; since if we have to pay more for our raw material we have also more to receive for our manufactured goods, and the ultimate bullion balances in settlement can therefore in no way be affected. Hence the doctrine that the spread of commerce wil accoumt for the phenomena now in progress must be discarded as unsatisfactory, or, at all events, insufficient. Further reasons must
be sought, and they will probably be found much more in consonance with the ordinary course of affairs. A failure of crops in some part of the world is generally at the bottom of all monetary disturbances, and in the present instance this solution is one among others. The loss of silk last year in Italy and France, the vine blight, the deficient yield of wheat in France, the Peninsula, and many parts of Germany, the destruction of the corn crop in the United States in 1855, and the transfer consequent apon the war of part of our Russian trade to India seem enough. The official efforts on the continent to conceal from the people their real position in times of disaster have prevented the extent of impoverishment sustained by France and other countries during the past year from becoming accurately known; but no one doubts that it has been such as would explain a very severe revulsion. Indeed, the surprise has been that, while the grounds for distress in that country have been perfectly apparent, she has esc1ped with a degree of monetary pressure not greater than that wituessed in England. Has not this result, however, been solely consequent upon the extent to which she has drawn upon English capital t It is believed that the fall in her Government funds and tailway securities has been arrested
eolely by itvestments from this side. Political order
being maintained, while the extent of her agr1vuItural losm have been as much as possible concealed,' the confidence of English capitalists in her securities h- not been shaken, anid with every fresh decline tondon investors hive been disposed to ioprease their stake. In this way we have mitigateM -4e pressure, and taken it in a great degree on our own shoulders. At the same time, the fact of a most important portion of European trade' benmg diverted to China and India hs caused a temporary lock-up both of money and produce, since probably at no time throughout tlio past year has there been at sea less than 1,500,0001. of specie, and an equal value in silk, tea, hemp, &c., beyond what would otherwise have been so situated. Aloiig with these circumu,aces there have aLso been many minor ones. The conviction that with the prevailing prosperity of the country it was imPossible that the pressure for money could continue has been so perseveringly held that invetments-usually too large and incautious-in American stocks have been continued to a much heavier extent than ha been supposed, in order to secure the advantage of low prices in New York. The gradual absorption of bullion by the Austrian Bank in preparation for a resmption of specie payments In January next has likewise had au inflluence, as well as the search for silver to supply the China market, which has kept a large quantity of gold in transiu throughout Europe and South America. Lately, the Persiar and Chinese wars have added to the demand, while for a long period the call have been steady for the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, and also for the Indian lines. These considerations appear ample to account for our present position without a resort to any particular theories, and they are all of a character to encourage a belief that affairs will after some time resume their ordinary channeL Good crops, however, can alone be the foundation of any permanent change. At present the silk harvest promises well, but it is too early to form any conclusive opinion. The season appears also to have been generally favourable for grain, but that must be an anxious question for several months, Under no circumstances, however, can a return to cheap money be anticipated for several year. While the commercial pressure has been going on a multitude of claims for useful public works in our colo. nies and elsewhere, with large guarantees, have been held in abeyance, and these will offer opportunities to cause all persons to congratulats themselves if they have kept their capital available. That any one will be found under such circumstances now willing to commit himself to au indefinite outlay on Russian railways with 4t per cent. as his utmost prospect, and with many posibilities to interfere even with that, is a contingency that can hardly be entertained.

At a meeting of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, held to-da3, Captain C. E. 3Mangles, M.P., presiding, a dividend of 21. per share for the second half of 1856 was declared, with a bonus of 11. 10. per share out of the amount beyond 200,000N. standing to the credit of the insurance account, the whole free of income-tax. The discussion was prncipally of a congratulatory nature, the chairman having explained at length the chief items in the financial statement. With regard to the repairs and the deterioration fund it has been considered prudent to make an appropriation of about 8 per cent., but hereafter it will be possible, it is thought, to limit the amount to 6 per cent. The success of the works for the recovery of the Tyne and the circumstances attending the los of the Tay were alluded to, great credit being given to the engineers and others who in the former case made the necessary arrangements. In answer to questions it was stated that the coal contract has been renewed at the rate of 9s. for coal at Newport, and at 18s. for that delivered at Southampton, and that the retiring pension to Captain Chappell is 5001. a-year. An inspection of the mtercolonial service has lately been made, and the directors will give the report and suggestions they have received early consideration. At the close of the proceedings a special resolution was passed authorizing the Board to set apart 1,0001. per annum towards the payment of premiums on the life assurances of the captains and other officers.
Letters from Lisbon mention that Sir Morton Peto was returning to England, after concluding arrangements with the Portuguese Government for the continuation of their railways toOporto and the Spanish frontier. The actual terms have not transpired, but it is understood Sir M. Peto properly declines to proceed until the claims of the English contractors of the line to Santarem have been adjusted.
The London and Eastern lBauking Corporation have called a meeting for the 28th inst., "to receive a report of the directors." On the part of the shareholders it is observed that what is wanted is a report from the investigating committee and the accountant, and that until the extent of their individual and collective culpability shall have been ascertained the directors should abstain from offering any statements interfering with the course of affairs.
Advices from the Cape of Good Hope state that the Columbian steamer, with the Australian mail of the 14th of January, arrived at the Cape on the 18th of February.

EAST KENT.
A meeting of tho inhabitants and others interested in the extension of the East Kent Railway from Strood to St. Mary Cray was held at Farningham on Wednesday, MIr. W. Martin, M.P., in the chair.
Mr. HoLnoYD, the secretary of the East Kent Company, explained that the portion of the East Kent Pailway from Chatham to Farningham would be opened for traffic in the course of September next, and that the remainder of the line to Dover was now in course of construction. The proposed new line from Strood to St. Mary Cray would form a junction with the East Kent line at Strood, and in connexion with St. Mary Cray and Bromley and the West-end and Crystal Palace Railways give the public the advantages of two metropolitan termini-one at the Waterloo station of the London and South-Western Railway, and the other at the West-end terminus, near the Ranelagh-bridge, across the Thames, now in course of construction. T'he East Kent company were promoting the extension from Strood to St. Mlary Cray, which, when completed, would put Faversham, Sheerness, Canterbury, Margate, Ramsgate, and Dover in direct communication with the metropolitan termini to which he had alluded. The proposed through line rid St. Mary Cray to Dover would pass through one of the most pounlous districts of the county, and have the advantage of being fed by numerous and valuable branches. The East Kent ine also joined the North Kent Railway at Strood, by which they would have access over it to London. bridge - but it was admitted by the proprietors of the South-hastern Company that the traffic over the North Kent line to the London-bridge station was at present so very considerable that it would be totally unequal to accommodate an increase to any great extent from the East Kent Railway, hence the great advantage of the proposed line, to fill up the gap between Strood and St. Mary Cray.
Mr. CAuPBELLn moved a resolution, to the effect that, in the opinion of the meeting, the proposed line from Strood to St. Mary Cray would be of great local and public advantage.
Mr. DRAY seconded the motion.
Mr. HicKsoxN hoped that if the bill were passed that the construction of the line would not be prevented in consequence of any so-called amicable arrangements with the South-Eastern Company. He thought the meeting ought to obtain a pledge from the chairman of the East Kent Railway to that effect. gHear, hear).
Mr. BELL, the soheitor of the Mid-Kent Railway Comprny, stated that the East Kent Railway Company were bound by agreements with theWest-End and Crystal Palace and the Mid-Kent Railway companies not to enter into any arrangement with the South-Eastern Railway Company except upon the footing of the construction of the line from Strood to St. Mary Cray, and further 20,0001., or 10 per cent. of the whole capital, had been paid into the bands of the Accountant-General, which could not be got out of the Court of Chancery until the line was made.
The resolution was then carried unanimously.
On the motion of Mr. B,%uBN-TT, Mr. NxArnF and Mr. DENT, resolutions were passed to the effect that the pro. posed line was imperatively required by the district and public - that it was the only line that would relieve the North kent Railway and the London-bridge terminus; that the meeting viewed the proposed line with satisfaction; and they considered that the proposed relief line of the SouthEastern Company from Dartford to the Greenwich Junction was not required, and was promoted in vlolation of the agreement on the faith of which the Mid-Kent Company obtained their Act for the line to St. Mary Cray.
A deputation, consisting of Messrs. Campbell, Dray, Manby, Hall, and Fletcher, was appointed to wait on Lord Darnley with a view to urge him to reconsider his determination of opposing the bilL
Lord SONsDES, in reply to some observations, stated that they might depend upon it that the East Kent Railway directors would go straightforward and endeavour to do what they could to carry the line through.
A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceedings.

COURT OF CHANCERY. TlTTRRnAV AV,, 1R
BRYAN V. IAWAT(PM
(Before the LOBD COAWPTi.un \
Tehis parb-heard petition of Her Majesty's AttorneyGeneral on behalf of Her Majesty, seeking to recover from the European Life Insurance and Annuity Company a certain amount of legacy-duty, was this morning resumed.
The petition stated that by the will of Clementina Bryan, dated ugust, 1819, the interest on a sum of 29,55. 8s. lOd. Bank Annuities was given to Mary, then the wife of the lato Sir John Milley Doyle, for her life, and after her decease to the said Sir John Willey Doyle for bis life, with divers subsequent remainders over. As the annuity was not given to the separate use of Lady Doyle, and as no settlement was made on her marriage, Sir John Milley Doyle was entitled to receive the dividends during his wife's life, and in the year 182D he borrowed a considerable sum of money from the European Life Insurance Company by granting them annuities to the yearly amount o 731. 10s, during his own life, chargeable upon the beforementioned dividends. The duty payablo on Lady Doyle's life interest, calculated under the statute as an annuity, was duly paid by four yearly instalmenta, commencing in the year 1820, and the 29.658. 10s. 4d. Bank Annuities were in the month of July, 1844, by order of this Court, transferred into the name of the AccountantGeneral to the credit of this cause. Lady Do7le was divorced by Act of Parliament from her husband in the year 1823, and 3C01 a-year out of the dividends was ordered to be paid to her separte use. The remainder of the dividends were by several orders of this Court paid to the European Insurance-offi¢e down to the time of the death of Lady Doyle, which took place on the 10th of February, 185L In June, 1851, an order was made, on the petition of the insurance company, directing the whole of the future dividends to be paid to them, to be appliedby them in payment -firstly, of their own annuities of 7314 10s. ; then as to 1001. yearly in liquidating the arrears due to them; and then to pay the surplus of such dividends to Sir John MflleyDoyle. Nothing whatever was said at this time respecting the legacy duty payable on such reversionary life interest of Sir John MEley Dovle in the stock; but on the 13th of August, 1853, Thomas 7halley Bolton, the solicitor tothe company, wrote a letter to the Controler of Legacy Duties in the following terms:-
`S1r,-X shalbeumuch oblged by 3-r fmrahlogmne wlthacesrtidcate tobe produoedto the Accoustanit-General that the iegacy duty payable on the acnauty to Mary Doyle bha been duly paid.'
A printed form to that effect was filled up and given to the clerk who brought the letter, and at the same time a memorandum was made in the books of the Legacy Duty-office that Marv Doyle was stil alive. Sir John Milley Doyle died in the month of August, 1856, at which time the Controllor of Legacy Duties first became aware that the duty on SirJohn eilley Doyle's life interest had become payable, and it was upon these grounds it was asked that the European Life nsurance and Annuity Company might be oraered to reftnd so much of the dividends received by them under the order of June, 1851, as would ecual in amount the duty of 10 per cent, payable in respect of such life interest, and also pay the costs of the petition.
The Attorney-Genera and Mr. Hanson appeared for the Crown ; Mr. Cairns and Mr. Busk for the insurance Com-
T nhe LoRrD aCH x.on said the petition involved many important considerations. Formerly great difficulty existed in the Accountan'-General's office in ascertaining whether legacy duty was payable in respect of the various amounts transferred there, but to an extent that difficulty had been remedied by an order of this Court made in the year 1854. His Lordship then adverted to the factsof the case, and said that no one could doubt duty was payable under the Act by each person who became entitled to successive life estates, to be calculated where the duties were different as annuities, and to be paid in solido out of the capital where the rates were equaL The duty had been duly paid on Lady Doyle's life interest, but upon her death the duty payable in respect of Sir John Milley Doyle's interest had been overlooked, and an order wrongfully obtained from this Court for payment of the whole of the dividends to the insurance comany. That such order was wrong was manifest from the 25th section of the 36th of George III, chap. 52, which expressly enjoined this Cotrt in all suits concerning the administration of the personal estate of any person to provide for the due payment of the legacy duty, bow, in the first place it was an Important question of fact for this Court to ascertain how it was that the duty payable on Sir John Milley Doyle's life interest was not provided for at the time the petition of 1851 was presentedl It had been urged that there had been an improper concealment by the solictor of the insnce comprny, and it was his (the Lord Chancellor's) duty to consider whether such was ten case. He had given his best attention to all that had been said in court on that and the preceding day, and had also looked carefully through the affaidavits2 and he must say that he could not bring his mind to believe that the solicitor did not know that the duty was then unpaid. It was the bounden duty of a solicitor to take care that the Court was not misled into making an order that was contrary to law, and therefore the conduct of a solictor who was ancilary to the taking of money out of court without pymg the obligations imwsed on it by law was highly to be reprobated In the present case the most charitable construction of the solicitoes conduct was that he passively permitted the Court to fall into the error. With respect to the letter of August, 1853, it was quite clear that the solicitor to the insurance company mnust have known when the Accountant-General asked ora certificate of the duty having been paid on Lady Doyle's life interest that the duty on Sir John Miley Doyle's interest had not been paid. iSuch was the conclusion he (the Lord Chancellor) had arrived at, either that the solicitor actually knew the duty had not been paid, or that he had every r6ason to suppose it had not been paid, and therefore abstained from making any inquiry, which amounted to constructive knowledge of thefact. That being his impression of the evidence, it only remained to see what were the rights of the Crown; and upon that point he had had considerable doubts. Probably the strict legal way to proceed was by action to recover bask the money from those who had wrongfully received it, as it was out of the question to sup. pose at a;erson could ' his legac, and that the assignee would be absolvedfrom all liablity provided he obtained payment of the legacy fromithe executor without deduction of the legacy duty The Crown would then lose Its right altogether. in such a case as the one now under consideration in former times the way would have been for the Crown, by an information in the nature of a bill of review, to have corrected the order of June, 1851; but in modern days the Court had diverged fromsuch a roundabout course, and substitated a summary way of proceeding. Feeling satisfied, therefore, that any other proceedings would not bring out any new facts, he should take a coarse not strictly, perhaps. n; ht in form, and make an order on the petition that the European Life Insurance Company pay to the Inland Revenue-office the legacy duty ch-.rgeable upon the life interest of the late Sir John MIley Doyle, and also pay the costs of the petition.

SAUNDERS V. RATINn-R
(Before VIce-CAzancdio SiT.T v;I
This bill was filed by John Saunders, eldest son of John Saunders, who was a hoop-bender carrying on a large business in that trade, who died in 1841. It appeared that for somo time before the testator's death his wife (now dead) drew checks in his name, and otherwise transacted business for him and his son. Thomas Harry Saunders had been in partnership with and consequently had money transactions with him, and in September, 1838, the testator took a bond from him for 7,0001. as in respect of all that was due to him from his son as such partner, with a sum of l,000l appearing and admitted due upon the account between them. In 1843 the members of the family, including the plaintiff, the defendant Thomas Harry Saunders, the widow, and three daughters, joined in a release to the executors, the widow executing such release also as representing two daughters who were of mental incapacity. A suit was then insttuted by the plaintiff to set aside that release, and for an account; but at the hearing the part of the relief asked as to the release was given up, and an account taken upon that footine. The plaintiff then presented a petition to impeach all the proceedings and that petition was dismissed. The present bil was then fled in 1853, seeking to charge Thomas Harry Saunders with a large sum received as agent of his father. The answer of Thomas Harry Saunders to this bil set up the Statute of Limitations, and denied aU agency, stating that the 8,0001. had been accounted for to the widow. The plaintiff contended that, as the defendant only admitted ,OOOh to have been due, but as it was proved that he had received other sums, those must have been received as agent for his father, and there had been an admission within six years of receipt of money in another suit of " Saunders v Walter" in the account of the legacies by Thomas Harry Saunders.
Mx. C. P. Cooper and Mr. J. S. Moore appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. naily, Mr. Glasse, Mr. Dickinson, Mr. Druce1 and Mr. Ient appeared for the several defendants; but without calling upon them,
The VICE-CHAmECLOn thought that the suit was a most ill-advised one, and it was clear upon the facts that if %be defendant Thomas Harry Saunders, was agent of any one, It was of tie widow, but certainly not of the father, for the moneyshe received he merelyreceived as messenger of the testhtor. If he had been such agent, the statute was a clear bar, and would have been even if the testator were ling, for 12 years had elapsed since any money had been received. The release was also clearly binding upon the plaintiff, and the bill must be dismissed with costs.

The hearing of this motion for n injunction was resamed, and occupied nearly the entire day. At the conclusion ot the defendants' case his Honour granted an interlocutory injunction in the terms asked for by the plaintiffs. The ground upon which the injunction was granted rested en-
fraly upon the construction of a cl e in the Stockton and Darlington Railwa Act, 1855, which, in his Honoure, opinion, it ws proper snould be determined at the hearing of the cause before the com, ny wero allowed to take oossesion of the lands in queshon i and his Honour there ore put the lntiffs upon an undertrldng to give notice of

THE QUXKK V. ROLLANDS.
1mzUngs zn Banco, befor Lord CA?TBKLL, and Justica
WIGELTMw, EnL, and CROMPTON.)
Sir F. T sGIM (with whom was mr. Bodkln) said he was instracted on the part of the Hon. Mr. Clements, formerly YP. for the county of Leitrim, to move fo: a rule calling upon Stewart Erskine Rollands, who dated his letters from the Aray and Navy Club, to show cause why a criminal information shotdd not be filed against him for using grossly insulting language, tending to produce a breach of tho peace, under the most unjustifiable circumstances. The learned counsel stated at some length the circumstances out of which the application arose, and read a long correspondence which had taken place between the parties, and which terminated by a personal interview at the applicant's house, in Grosvenor-zquar,when Mr. Rollands told himnhe was "a coward and a coundreL" It appeared fromthe learned gentleman's statement that a Mr. Koss, of Bladensburg, in the county of Down, as the friend of Mr. D. Urquhart, of St. Anne's, in the county of Cork, had endeavoured to effect a settlement of a difference which had taken place between thatgentleman,andaDr. Barter,alsoofSt.Anne's, btt did not succeed in so doing. Subsequently, Mr. Ross wrote two letters to Mr. Urquliat in which he made use of expressions that were offensive to [r.Urqnhkr. Adifference having thus arisen between Mr. Ross and Mr. Urquhart, Mr. Ross deputed Mr. Clemente (the applicant) and Mr. Urquhart deputed Mr. Rollands to act as their respective friends to -ettle the dis"ute. The two friends agreed to communicate their views in writing, and a long correspondence took place, in which it appeard that Rollands reqnired Mfr. Ross to withdraw the imputation supposed to be cast upon Mr. Ur nhart in the following passage of the letter winch he hadwritte to him:-
"I am unnpeakably ahamed o£ and sexed witht myself *or not Flung at once pies, ted tba exanton. rt I, my fainEg so be a1owr
Cleggisbelfenga ondcmten. Int resneof mind r ed en t- thernnore I alloe to be rldo wed hbr yorather than tanganindependent stand and uvewing th matter with my own esee. I hase dtone bad ae,le to you an tbe Doctos, and I now make this tardr aI teas too late) act of ccanltiee."
Mr. Clemnents, on the pert of Mr. Ross, in reference to the expression that ha (Rosa) had allowred himself to be hutrried on and swayed by Mr. Uruhr rather than taking
an independent stnd, and viemnig the matter with his own eyes, replied that no one but Mr. Ross himself could know whether such had been the effect of his communicaItions with MIr. Urquhart, but that it was impossible for him
to deny it, if such were the fact; but he contended that Mr. Ross, in his assertion of it, blamed no one but himself, and imputed no fault to lr. Urquhart; and when it appeared that Mr. Urquhart had taken umbrage at it, he, through the applicant, disclaimed all offensive meanine'
and expressed sirRrt that any offence had been caused. Under these circumstances the applicant would not be a
artyto Mr. Ross's having a hostle meeting with Mr. urquart, and closed the correspondenoe. Mr. Roliands then wrote aletter expressng his regretthathe should deem it compatible with honour to refuse, on the part of his friend, to withdraw a false statement or to give satisfaction. A few days after the applicant received another letter from Hr. Rollands, enclomng one from Mir. Urquhart, and asking for another interview, in which he said he had no doubt the matter might be settled in five minutes. The applicant replied that he could not consent to reopen the correspondence, as he had done, on the p of Mr. Ross, all that he considered to be required of him as a man of honour - and he reminded Mr. Rollands that when gentlemen endeavou-ed to settle a difference of this kind it was contrary to usage that the principals should join in the discussion, and he therefore could take no notice of Mr. Urquhart's letter. To that letter no answer was received, but on the 5th of March last Mr. Rollands called upon him at his residence in Grosvenor-square, and presented to him a letter which he said was from Mr. Urquhart. The applicant declined to receive it and said that if Mr. Rollands were to leave it he should send it back without reading it. Thereupon Mr. Roliands said, " Then I must tell you that you are a coward and a scoundrel," and immediately walked out of the room. The applicant stated that he believed Mr. Rollands's object was to provoke him to commit abreach of the pee. Under these circumstances Mr. Clements was advised to come to this Court for protection. Notice of the application had been given, and the learned counsel trusted the Court would think that Mr. Clements had acted as a gentleman and a man of honour, and was entitled to the mterference of the Court in his favour.
Lord CAMPBELL said the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause.
Rule nii granted.
DELAIUE V. DIlCKESON.
This was an action for the infringement of the plaintiff's patent for the manufacture of ensvelopes, on the trial of which at Guildhall, before Lord Campbel, at the sittings after last term, the plaintiff obtained a verdict.
hr. Serjeant Bynxs (with whom was Mr. Webster) now moved for a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant on certain points reserved, and also for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence.
Lord CAhPBELL said the learned ser eant might take a rule to show cause. His Lordship added that the jury had expressed a strong opinion in favour of the plaintiff, in which he (Lord Campbell) concurred.
Rule nisi granted.
ROUX V. WISEMAN,
-Mr. KEATING, Q.C.(with whom was Mr. Phipson), moved for a rule caling upon the plaintiff in this action to show cause why the verdict which had been found in his favour should not be set aside, and a new trial granted, upon the ground that the verdict was against the evidence, and that the damages were excessive. The learned counsel stated that the action was in detenue, and was tried before Mrr Justice Crowder at the last Glocester assizes, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 500L. damages. The document which the plaintiff sought to recover from the defendant, Cardinal Wiseman, vAs a paper signed by Letitia Wyse, a first cousin of the Emperor of the Frenob, whereby the said Letitia Wyse acknowledged herself to be indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 25,OOOf The plaintiff, the Abbe Roux, was a French priestk and on being examined through an interpreter he stated that, having received civilities from Cardinal Fesch at Rome, and being at Paris in 1845, and hearing that Letitia Bonaparte, who was the wife of Mr. Wyse, the English Minister at Athens, was in distress, he determined to assist her. He accordingly took todgings for her, and showed her vaTious acts of kindness, which he described, and advanced money for her assistance. This continued till the year 1847, when he said he made out an account of his advances, and went over it with Mrs. Wyse in the presence oi a Madame Blanchon, her governess, whom he had been unable to find. According to that account, he said, 25,000f. were due from Madame Wyse to the Abb6; and he said that on that occasion Madame Wysesigned the document which was the sub ject of the action. He stated that Madame Wyse had separated from her husband, and that he, being desirous of effecting a reconciliation between them, came over to Engl3nd, and saw Cardinal Wiseman on the subject. At the same time he showed the document to the Cardinal, andalso some bils for 8,000f. which had been signed by Mr. Wyse's son Alfred. He said that the Cardinal, who was at that time only a bishop, had received the docu. ment and the bills, upon the understanding that the bo;D were to be given over unconditionally to Mr. Wyse, but that the other document was to be held by the bishop, who undertook to obtain payment of the amount from Mr. Wyse. The plaintiff said the defendant was to receive payment from Mr. Wyse, and otherwise the document was not to be parted with. Theplaintiffsaidhehad had an interview with Mx. Wyse, but he did not know tiU the year 1854 that the paper had passed out of the defendant's hands. The plaintiff returned to France, and nothing more was done for seven years; but in the year 1854 the Cardinal was in Paris, and the plaintiff, having heard that the Emperor was paying the debts of his family, apphed to him for the document. According to the plaintiffs state. ment the Cardinal said ho would look for the document and would send it to him. The plaintiff came to England in November, 1854, and, as the Cardinal could not find the document, the Abbe requested him to write a letter to the Emperor, stating that he had seen a paper of the kind described. At first the Cardinal promised to do so, but he subsequently declined. The plaintiff had been stationed at Chelsea by the Cardinal, but at the end of the year 1855 complaints were made against him which necessitated an inquiry, andahe was suspended. In a few months after he brought the present action. The learned counsel then proceeded to state that the Abb6 had several times positively sworn that it was not till the year 1854 he knew that the document was in Mr. Wyse's hands. A letter was then pro. duced to him, which he admitted to be in his handwriting containing a passage which showed thecontrary. It appeared from the letter that on the 9th of 3farch, 1848. the Abb6 knew that the document was in the hands of Mr. Wyse, and yet for seven Tears he had tken no stops. His explanation of the contradiction was most unsatisfactory.
Lord ClCAm.PXnL said that if the document was handed over to Mr.Wyse with the plaintif's concurrence the action could not be sustained.
rr. KXATIIG said, the plaintiff had p roved his own case entirely. The defendant, Cardinal Wseman, was called, and stated that the pllntiff came to him in November, 1847 with no other introductionthan statingthathe was a French
iest, who felt great interest in the Wysefamily. HEo sid ewied to effect a reconciliatin between Mr. and M
Wyse, and, as they werermembers of his (the Cardinal's) con. gregation and religion, the Cardinal undertook to sneak to MIr. Wyse on the subject. At the same time] the Ab produced the document and bills, wohich the Cardinal read, and recollected that the document was an acknowrledgment of a debt of 25,000f. dnae from M WYs nd was desbed a " sacred debt." The Cardinal, howver, sworo positively that he had never undertaken the offioe of procuring pay ment of the debt, that he had never received the document at all and that it had never been in his custody. He was asked if he had not made an Answer to an interrogtory which was inconsistent with that statement ? oe admitted that he had done so, but he sad that on further considera.
tion, he was able to swear positively that he had never had the document.
Lord CmpnBe.-How was it supposed to have got into Mr.Wyse's hands?
Mr. KE&TING.-Through the plaintiff himself The Cardinal sadd he had heard nothing of the matter for seven years till the year 1854, whea the Archbishop of Paris asked 6isu to interest himself in favour of a certain
riest. The plaintiff was th-n introduced to him, and on ni ae}ing for the docament the Cardinal said he would look for it, and if he found it he should have it. There could be no doubt that he did look for it, and that the plaintiff made several applications for it. The Cardinal xtated that the plaintiff had applied for a certificate that he had een the document, aud that he had given him one; but he afterwards asked him to write a letter to the Em.
ror, which he at first promisedto do, but subseqnently

counsel then referred to the dapositon made by Madame
Wyse on being examined under a commission.
Lord OCIPysxrL-Dind she deny the signing of the doox.- Mr. KxATING.-She did not deny that she had signed the docunent, but she said that she signedthree documents produced to her by the Abbe, one of which was an acknow. edgment of a debt of 25,000f. and another for 60,06f., and that she signed the documents in order that the Abb6 might show them to the Archbishop of Paris as an explanation of his frequent visits at her house. She further stated that, though he had made several advances on her account those advances had been repaid, and that upon the whole le was her debtor in a smAll amount. The learned counsel then referred to the Abbe's letter of the 9th of March, 1848, which showed that at that time he knew the document was in Mr. Wyse's hands, and made no complaint.
Lord C xrPB.RU said that if the document was given to Mr. Wyse with the plaintiff's concurrence the action could not be sustined.
Mr. KlAyGa urged that the plaintiff's letter of the 9th of M\farch wa the only iieoe of written evidence, and the plaintiff's explanation ot it was most unsatisfactor. It Wag, that when r.

Lord COAMBEu said that with respect to the amount of the daumges the defendant might have some difficnlty, for it mlght be supposed that His Imperial Majesty would pay the debt on being atisfied that the document was executed.
Mr. K-aM G submitted the damages wero too high. Mrs. Wyse was a married woman, and she gave an account of the execution of the document which would induce the Emperor to hesitate before paying a debt which she repudiated.
Lord CA XRLL said the learned counsel might take a rule on both grounds, and the Court would hear both sides.
Rule nin granted.
THE QVXEN V. BARNWETL (CLERB).
Mr. S3ns2M moved for a rule caling upon the Rev. E. L. Barnwell, the master of the endowed grammar school at Ruthven, in the county of Denbigh, to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against him for the offence of "undue influence" committed by him at the recent election of a member to serve in ParTliment for the Denbighshize boroughs. The offence of " undue influence"
wscreted by the fith section of the Corrupt practices prevti which eacted that "every person who
1, directly or indirectly, by himself, or by any other person on his behalf, make use of, or threaten to make use of, anyforoe, volence, or restraint, or infict, or threaten

Treherme, father and son, were bakes m the market.place at Ruthven, and they supplied bread to the llev. Mr. Barnwell and his school, as well as to Bishop Goodman's charity, out of the funds of which 50 loaves were weekly given away by the churchwardens, and to another charity (Pelwell's), which
gave away 51. worth of bread yer Beth father and son ad votes, and they were eagerly canvassed both for Mr. Mainwaring and for his opponent, Mr. Morris. On the day of the poll the Rev. Mr. Baruwell several times called upon the younger Treherne and pressed him to vote for Mainwaring, but he was answered that he (Treherme) had several persons to please besides Mr. Barn. well, and that he should either vote for Morris or stsnd neuter. Mr. Barnwell then threatened that if he did not vote for Mainwaring he would be churchwarden next year, and he would take the charity bread from him; he also said " he would look black at him" and take away his own cestom. He called a second time and told Treherne's wife if her husband did not vote as he wished " he should make no more bread for the church." He caled a third time and made similar threats, but, notwithstanding this intimidation, both father and son recorded their votes for Mr. Morris From that day, the 30th of March, the Rev. Mr. Barmwell had withdrawn his custom and ceased to deal with them. The learned counsel said he believed this Was the first time An application of this kind had been made to the COUrt under theo Act.
Lord CAPRxLL said this was the first general election which had taken place since the Act pamsed.
* Mr. S N'm said the object of the section was to protect voters in the exercise of the franchise, and so to render the vote by ballot less necessary.
Lord CAssBELT.-You don't wish us to express any opinion on the ballot ? (Laughter.)

CURLEVIS V. THE EARL OF MORNMGTON.
Mr. H. Hill and Mr. T. Jones were counsel for the plain. tiff; Mr. E. James and Mr. Hance for the defendant.
This action was brought against the Earl of Mornington as administrator of his son, the late Hon. James P. H. T. L. Welesley, to recover the amount of certain goods sup phedto that gentlem^n. The defendant pleaded the general
issue,anid that the debt was barred by the Statute of
Mr. HL HInL stated that the plaintifi; Mr. . C. Cur. lewis, was a tailor, carrying on business in Conduit-street. In 1837 the late Mr. Weliesley, who was then an officer in the 12th Lancers, became a customer of his. In the early part of 1839 the account amounted to 7051 7s 8d. Mr. Wellesley, on being applied to, requse hti

but no money was paid. Further clothes were sup lied, andinSeptebenr, the onthadrisen tol,0341 6s2d.
When the plaintiff applied to Mir. Wellesley for money he stated that his brother, Lord Wellesley, was arranging his affairs, and requested that the account might be again fur. nished. The amount was not paid, and when M1r. Wellesley left England, in 1845, the value of the clothes supplied was 1,5591. 7s. 3d. He remained abroad until his death, in October, 185L In January of that year the plaintiff, in order to prevent his debt from being barred, issued a writ against Mr Wellesley, which was continued from time to time, and was running at his death In the course of the year 1854 the plaintiff was informed that br. Wellesley wus entitled to some property in Ireland, which might be made available for the payment of his debts, and in August he filed a bill in Chancery against the defendant. In April, 1855, he issued a citation from the Ecclesiastical Court caling on the defendant to take out administration to his son. The letters of administration were granted on the 3d of July, and in November following the present action was commenced. In the course of the year 1843 Mr. Wellesley had paid two small sums of 591 and 1001., and in 1844 a sum of 351. In March, 1845, fr. Curlewis was pressed for mneWb Mr Spilsbury, his linendraper He applied toMr wellc61ey, who consented to accept a biL

Wellesley was in the habit of borrowing money from him. The two paymaents, however, in 1843 were not on foot of that account. The charges were the usual ones. He had only one caRle of prices, but after 12 months he charied interest at 5 per cent. ir. Wellesley was well aware of that, and it was stated on the bils sent to him.

UOWWN V. IHELLA17f
(Sittings in Banco.)
The Ron. G. DES-NAx moved to set aside the award of the arbitrators herein. It appeared that there being cross 6ctions between the parties, who stood towards each other in the relation of landlord and tenant, the defendsait obtained an order for a compulsory reference to a Judge of a County Court, who thereuppon heard the eases. DTning the progress of the evidence the attention of the dearned judge was called to the state of tho tpleadings in both actions by tie plaintiff, who olalind the right bo a findig in his wovr on two isees on the addmissions mAde by his ont. Te lexaned judge,'however, ,said that he did not kno, mand did not want to -now, anythiag about special pleading, withoct which they got on 'very well in the County GoIUts, -ad eventually made a general award in the actionbrought by the landlerd for the siefendant, thus ignoring the adumssions made by the de'fendant. He also made an awazd in the same instrument in the other action, thowuh there were two -rders of refer'ence, aad, both the findings Wng distasteful to the land~lord, a notion was mode lat harm to set-aside the award and to refer the causes to anether arbisrtor. The Court made this rule absolbte, on the ground ttat the arbitrator had not found on iii the itsues, but 'referred it back to 1im'to et It right. The lenned arbitrator thereupon made two awards, and as to the action by the -landlord, found expreasly on aU the issues for the tenant.
Mr. Dsis7AN tow conknded, insupport of his motion, -that the award ought to be set aside-.frst, because the arbi'trator had made a mistalo on the merits by finding against
the admissions by the defendant, and also becausse his intiination to disregard theissues and -decide without reference to special pleading amnounted to misconduct. As to the 'flrst point, it was argued that this being a compulsory refer. -ence the plaintiff-wasonot bound-by the mistake of the judge so imposed on him. -As to the second, it 'was contended that the present awzrd having been made after the former discussion, and beimg a repetition of the former in substance, the arbitrator had thereby evinced a determination .to disregard his dzty, in whic -tcase he would be guilty of legal misconduct.
Mtr. Baron BRAmwELL-The learned judge need not be -under any such- etarm about spcial pleading as he appears to entertain.; but he may be-sure of one thing, and that is that he will never learn the ast without trying to do so.
The CnxxV BARON said, that if the learned counsel -would hand up the affidavits the Court would look into theem and give jud4ment shortly, so as to enable the learned counsel to move within the -irst seven days of the term in 'the other cause, if he should be so advised.
Judgment deferred accordingly.
ITERKIfNS V. TILE NATreNAL ASSURANCE AN-D LN-T-
MEN'T ASSOCIATION.
Mr. QuANni moved to rescind the order of Mr. Justice 'Voleridge, setting aside the judgment signed by the plaintiff.
It appeared that an order was made by consent for the payment by the defendaut of a certain sum and taxed costs with the usual leave to the plaintiff to sign judgment on deTault of the defendant inpaying either the one or the other. 'Under this order the plaintiff's attorney and the clerk of that of the defendant attended the taxation, and as soon as the Msasterhad signed the allocatur the plaintiffs attorney asked the clerk for the debt and costs so taxed, and on beina told that he liad no money about him wherewith to pay he thereupon signed the judgment in question. It was now urged that the judgment was strictly regular; that the ~defendant's attorney -aught to have gone to the taxation prepared to pay, and that having not done so when demand was made he had committed such a default as justified the plaintiff in signing such judgment.
The CouRT, however, suggested that it was not reasonable to expect a clerk to go to taxation at the Master's-office prepared to pay the amount of debt and costs, whatever that might be, in moneys numbered. Such a practice was most rrational, and without laying down wbht would be a reasonable time, it wvasenough to say that the time given was un.easonable. The order of the learned Judge setting aside a judgment thus snapped was quite correct. The Master, moreover, reported that the practice was not to sign judgment, as had here been done.
Mr. QUAEN would not set up his opinion against the Master's report, but he had had considerable experience in such practice (laughter), and he should certainly say it was -every day's praotice to sign judgment immediately after the taxation if the money were not at onoe paid.
The Coura adhered to the opinion that such a practice would be most unreasonable. Some time ought to be given 'to a man to get the money, and none had been allowed -here.
Rulo refused accordingly.
Siuiungj at Niei Priuu, before Mr. Baron WATSON and

This was the first day of the sitting in Easter Term. There were 33 causes set down for trial, two being remanets, four special juries, and fonr being undefended.
The two causes tried this morning were of no interest to te public, and would not justify a report.

MLASION-QsTSE.-Mr. John Graham, of Brook's-wharf, (Queenhlithe, andJobin Wing, a lighterman, appeared before the LoRD MAY-OR ill answer to a simnmons which had been obtained against them by the City Solicitor, and which -charged them with having committed a nuisance at common law within the oity of Landon, by permitting 20 tons of sheep's hoofs to zemain on board a barge in a putrid state and condition, whereby offensive and noxious smells and vapours had arisen, to the annoyance and nuisance of the
The City Solicitor appeared fo,r the prosecution. The -difencants, who pleaded "Not Guilty,' were not represented by legal advisers.
'Mr. William Anderson Rose, Alderman -of the ward of '-Queenhithe, was smorn, and said,-%On or about the 2d inst. my attention was called to the state of a nuisance from a ;barge lying off Brook'e-wharf, Queenhithe. My attention was drawn by one of the inhabitants of the ward to a very - dreadful smell whioh pervaded the neighbourhood. I immediately proceeded to the spot, and found abarge aground, laden with bags containing, as I was told by the proprietor of-the wharf. green hoofg, and from which arose a putrid 'fermnented smell. The defendant (Ur. Graham) was present upon that occasion, and upon my speakirg to him in reference to the nuisance he said that the e wners of -the hoofs had engaged freight on board a ship, but that the vessel was not in a condition to receive the hoofs. I believe he also caid that he thought it very likely that the owners of the-ship might object tothe condition of the freight. I told him that acomplaint had been made-to me as the alderman of the ward by several of the inhabitants, and that 1 should immediately apply to the Lord Mayor to exercise any powers he might possess for the removal of the dangerous nuimance. I then applied to the Lord Mayor, who gave instructions to the wator-bailiff to get the nuince removed. Mr. Graham told see that the barge should I-e removed directly after higEi water to belowbridge.
MAr. F. Hov.311, of 16, Quieenhithe, said,-I recoUect the barge with the hoofs Iying off Broolk's wharf on the day in question, when I observed,a very offensive smell ptoceed from it. SeveroE of my neighbours also conmplained of it. :[ then cornmnaiicated with Alderman Rose. The cargo was "steaming," and the smell that came fromn it was of sq offensive a character that I left my plare of business and went home earli*r than I otherwise should have done. I obserxed the smell 500 or fi00 yards from the spot where th e barge was lying.
Mr. J. LK i'ooper, cf Queenhithe.-The esnell that arose froim the bargo tainted the whole atmosphere near Brook'swharf. I obseTved it-3O yards from where the barge was lying. It was very .olTnsive, and found its way into my counting-house.
Samuel Evans, a city ietective officer, said,-In conmequence of information I received I went down the river to look for the barge, the Sarei, on the 7th inst. I found her lying off Horselydown, new7ly opposite Pickle Herring Wharf, almost in the eentre of the river. An inspestor of the Thames Police accoumpanicd mne. Our noses led us to the spot where the barge was nioored. It contained a large quantity of sheep's hoofs, w'hich were steaming, anid so very got that we could hardly touch them with our hands. I took a &zmple of the cargo, whicb I produce. [The witness produced about half a domen of the hoofs in a piper. Although they were in a dry state the siench that arose from them was almost intolerable. The Lord Mayor ordered them to be taken out of court immediately.] I first saw the barge about 1 o'clock in the day. About 4 o'clock the shme afternoon steam was still arising from the cargo, as well as a very dreadful stench. On the following day I saw Mfr. Graham, who said that the hoof.s had been taken on board for the purpose oE bweinlg sent to Scotlasd, but thati the captain of the ship had refused to take then on accountI ,of thelir stinking condition. On A subsequent occasion I went down the river and found that the cargo wa being anloaded at St. Bride's Wharf. Wapping.
Mr. XN. baundets, the City Water Bailiff, said,-MyattenLion wax acflled to this nuisance on the 31st nult The barge -as tlthan Iy.;g off Brook's-wharf. The cargo was ia a very 9t4,sm" corditon, J nd she bags were smoking, I Xw Mr,
Graham, who told me t!at the barge would be removed at high water. I gave drections to my watermau to watch
hat was done with 'the barge, and on the following morning I fOund it on the lower side of Southwark-bridge. The hoofs wera then being transferred from one bargo to snother. The stench ariging from the cargo was ittolerable. I next 'aw the barge containing the hoofs on the 6th inst., end, npon inquiring what was going to be done with it, was told by the men oa board that they were geing to take it UWay immediately.
' The LORD MAYo&-Did you allow this operation to continue without taking Any means to vrevent it ?
Witness.-I have no power to pzevent it. I should be verz happy if I had. The barge was moved about from day to day, and therefore I had no authority to interfere.
The LoRD XLYvO-This summons was taken out in consequence of instructions from myself. I experienced the horrible smell that came from the barge while attending to my nublic duties on the river. Had I known that the water baliff had no authority to interfere, I should have taken upon myeelf the responsibility, as conservator of the river, of immediately putting a stop to the nuisnce.
John Moore, the water-bailiffs waterman, said-I went to Brook-wharf and saw the barge, the contents of which sent forth a very bad stench. The barge was afterwards taken away and moored to a buoy near the lower part of Southwark-bridge. The day following I saw her at St. Katharine's-wharf. She then went over to Mark Brown's wharf. I missed her from there, and when I saw her next she was lying off Pickle Herring-stairs. I afterwards saw her below the Tunel-pier. I aaw the defendant Wing, and asked him what he was going to do with the cargo, and he toldme that hecouki not get a ship. The cargo was eventually taken out and deposited on a wharf at Wapping.
Cross-examined by Wing.-It is my opinion that you tried all you could to get rid of the cargo, but that you. could not find a ship to take jt.
The LORD MAYOR.-A more horrible stench I never smelt in my life, and upon making inquiries I found that it proceeded from a barge which I had ordered to be removed eight or ten days previously.
Wing.-The hoofs were perfectly sweet and dry when I took them on board, my Lord.
Austin Gann, who was next called, corroborated the evidence of the detective officer Evans with respect to the stench that arose from the cargo of hoofs.
The further hearing of the case was here postponed, for the purpose of enabling the defendants to procure professional assistance.
MA,RLEnosrL-Jamnes Butler was placed at the bar before Mx. BRouGsiTo2 charged with the following violent assault on police-constables, and Anne Butler, his sister, was charged with attempting to rescue him from the custody of the officers.
Between 12 and 1 o'clock yesterday morning the male prisoner wAs in Nottingham-mews, High-street, Marylebone, in altercation with some other person. A policeman of the D division, No. 300, went up to him and requested that he would be quiet. He became more exasperated, and struck the officer, who was knocked down. A crowd assembled, when, as the constable was in some danger of his life, it was found necessary to send for some other officers. Policemen Nos. 234 and 61 came up, when they were successively knocked down by him (James Butler). He was subsequently taken to tbe station-house. The evidence against the woman was, that she was under the influence of liqluor, and attempted to rescue her brother from the police.
The Rev. J. M'Donald, minister of Hinde-street Chapel, No. 17, Beaumont-street, said that he was going to bed when he heard the disturbance. le went into the mewc, where he saw that the pohoc were hkely to be overpowered. He called to two corporals of the Grenadier Guards to go to their asesistance. They ran down the mews, and took their bayonets from their sheaths. With them they kept the crowd back. It required six policemen to convey the male prisoner to the station-house.
Sergeant Defter stated that the male prisoner had been several times committed for assaults on the police and for felonies.
James Butler was sent for three months to the House of Correction for the assaults on the police, and his sister was fined bs., or in default seven days.
WoRssnnP-srxET.-James Stuart, a respectable-looking young man, was charged with the following disgraceful conduct
On the preceding evening the prisoner entered a public house in the Mile-end-road, accompanied by two girls of the town, with whom he for some time stood drinking at the bar, but at last his conduct became so disgraceful, and he made use of such disgusting language in the hearing of the landlady and her daughter, that the landlord ordered him either to desist or leave the house. The prisoner became greatly enraged, loaded the landlord with opprobrious epithets, seized a tumbler, which he flung at his head with great force, but fortunately missed his aim, and only struck him violently with it in the chest, and then grasped hold of another tumbler, and sent it smashing among 14 glasses of brandy and water, which stood ready mixed for the company in the parlour, and the greater portion of which glasses were soon dying from the counter to the floor, broken to pieces. A policeman fortunately came up at the moment, and the defendant was given into custody; but on reaching the station he expressed much charin that he had not effected more misohief, and threateningly told the laudlord that he would very soon see him again.
The prisoner pleaded intoxication as an excuse, denied finging the glasses, and declared that one of the women who were with him had done so; but this was distinctly refuted by the landlord's daughter, who also deposed to the prisoner being perfectly sober at the time; and
Mr. IUMMiLL sentenced him to pay 20s. for the assault, together with the smount of the damage he had committed; or, in default, suffer two terms of seven and 14 days in the House of Correction, and in addition to put in bail for his peaceable behaviour for a further term of three montbs.
CLRmKEIiwELL.-John Rears, a respectable looking young man, was finally examined before Mr. TynBWnIT-, charged with having attempted to obtain a situation under false pretence.
Mr. Gay, from the office of Messrs. Wire and Childe, attended for the prosecution, and said that since the prisoner's former examination the case had assumed a differeit aspect, It had been discovered that he was connected with a notorious gang, who were in the habit of obtaining siluations with false characters, and referring to each other ; and a woman who had been referred to by the prisoner, and had given him an excellent but false character, was convicted and sentenced by Mr. Jardine, of Bow-street, in the penalty of 201. The particulars of the case have already appeared in the newspapers.
Mr. Robert George Thurston, of the Parr's Head, Crossstreet, Ishngton, identified the prisoner as having got into his service as barman with a fictitious character, and immediately afterwards he commenced his drunkenness and dishonesty, and he discharged bim.
Mr. Shannon, of the Blue Posts, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy. square, gave similar testimony. Other cases were heard, and there was a numerous attendance of licensed victuallers in court who manifested great interest.
The prisoner said he would plead "Guilty" and throw himself upon the mercy of the Court. Distress urged him to the commission of the offence.
Mr. TYRWIITTsaid, such cases were fraught with the greatest mischief and danger to the public, and called for the severest punishment. By such surreptitious means persons obtained situations, and respectable persons were plundered to an alarming extent. He convicted the prisoner in the penalty of 201. and 10s. costs, or three months' imprisonment with hard labour in the House of Correction.
SOUWARK,.-James Brown, 37, who described himsoif as a smith, residing at 58, Friar-street, Southwark, was brought before Mr. BuRciHAm for final examination, chaed with uttering a forged 101. Bank of England note to
r. Joseph Pdgeon, the landlord of the Coachmakere' Arms wine vauits Robert- street, Blackfriars.-road.
Mr. BuaCHsAIx, after the usual caution, asked the prisoner whether he wished to say anything to the charge?
Hteh replied that he should reserve his defence until Mr. BuRcliliA then fully comnitted him to Newgate for trial.
LAuIrI.L-John Gibson, John Cole, William Mills, and Thomas Harting were placed at the bar before Mr. ELLIOTT on a charge of breaking into a pigeon-house belonging to Dr. Paul, of (jamberwell-house Lunatic Asylum, and stealing therefrom 26 pigeons and two Guinea fowls; and Henry Etteridge was also charged with receiving the same with a gtiilty knowledge.
The priconer Harting was admitted as Queen's evidence, and stated that on laturday evening last he was at the Gardeners'Arms beerhouse, in South-street, Camberwell, and there met t-he prisoners Gibson, Cole, and Mills, the former of whoni hzd a sack. After remaining there a short time they all three left, and in about three-quarters of an hour returned wit,a some live things, which he had no doubt were pigeons, in the sack. On the following morning he saw the prisoners standing with the prisoner Etteridge at his gate, and they subseguently told him they had sold the 26 pigeons and two Guinea fowls to Etteridge for 13s.

The following is extracted from a Plymouth paper.- "The 66th Begiment hAs this week been removed from this garrison to Aldershott by train, We understand that the 54th will very shortly foUow thern, though it is not ascertained if to the same destination; but such a coatingency is very probable, if we Are to refer to the fact that for some reason or other these two regiments have for many years been associated in the same quarters, both at home and abroad. We understand a very interesting ceremony took place in the messroom of the 54th on Friday week, when a sumptuous silver salver, and an elegant cigar-box, in the shape of a mortar, were presented to their late colonel, now Major-General W. Yorke Moore, who was esaeoially invited from London by his brother officers to receive this appropriate mark of their regard for their old coloneL We understand that the subject was kept private among the offacers and their friends, of whom 38 sat down to dinner,-all old acquaintanesu of Generil 3oore The plate was presented, in the name of all present, by Colonel
offkt, in a toncaing address, Which was responded to by the Major-General with much feeling. We find that Major-General Moore was much esteemed whfile in the regiment, and we regret our inability to give a more detailed account of what took place, as we think that too much publicity cannot be given to transactions of this kind, happening as they do so rarely, and manifesting that espit de corps and good fellowship which it is gratifying to witness in the British army."
The iron steam troopship Himalaya left Spithead at 1 prn, yesterday for China under steam. She passed the Boscawen to the westward of the Nab at a quarter before 2, thus aceomplishing, by the aid of steam, in an hour and a quarter the same distance which it took a fast-sailing new two-decker eighthours to do, beating to windward. The Himalaya was last seen with her topgallahltmasts down and yards pointed to the wind steering fast down Channel, wind, S.W. Captain Milne, R.N., the Transport Lord of the Admiralty, inspected her before leaving Portsmouth harbour, as did Major-General Breton.
yesterday a further discharge of troops, to the number of 107 non-commissioned officers and men of various cavalry and infantry regiments, toolo place at St. Mary's Barracks, Chatham. The troops discharged were selected from the following regiments :-5th Dragoon Guards, 7th Dragoon Guards, 15th Hussars, 4th King's Own, 6th, 10th, 13th Light Infantry, 19th, 23d Welsh Fusileers, 2cth Came. ronisans, 42d Highianders, 50th Queen's Own, 51st Light Infantry, 53d, 54th, 60th Rifles, 64tb, 66th 72d and 79th Highlanders, 85th, 98th, and the Rifle Brigade.

The Boscawen, 70, got underway yesterday morning at a quarter before 8 o'clock, for Plymouth, and worked out of Spithead under all plain sail with a moderate breeze from the S,S.W. She was not out of sight, behind the Isle of Wight, until 4 in the afternoon, standing down Channel under cou.-ses, topsails, and topgalantsails. She wiU be paid off all standing.
Yesterday morning the squadron of Royal gorse Artilery, nuder the comramand of Colonel Wood, and the whole o' the batteries, under the command of Colonel Teesdale, after forming in parade colurnns, were drawn up on Woolwichcommon in order to prferrm some evolutions in the presence of Lord Bloomfield, Eer Majesty's Envoy at the Court of Prussia. His Excellency, accompanied by Major-General Sir W. F. WiUiams, Commandant at Woolwich, Colonel BloomSfield, Second Commandant, and the ordinary garrison staff, in undress uniforms, proceeded to the ground at halfpast 12, and, having taken up their station at the flagstaff, the troops commenced marching past, and then retired to the distance of 800 or 900 yards, facing the flagstaff, where they halted and loaded their guns. A precipitate charge was then made in advance and a voUey fired. The guns were being reloaded when a gunner of the C troop, named Mark Sharp, who was in the act of ramming home the charge, was seriously injured by the pormatare esplosion of the piece. The sufferer was conveyed to the hospital, where it was found necessary to amputate the thumb of his right hand, the first joint having bhen carried away by the discharge of the ramrod. The left side of his face and eye likewise suffered severely. The evolutions were shortly afterwards discontinued, the troops defiling and returning to quarters. The ground was kept by the battalions of Foot Artillery, in command of Colonel R;ddeU-in short, preparations were ordered for a field day's inspection, but the unfavourable state of the weather drew the proceedings to ar early termination. His Lordship then repaired to the residenoe of General Williams, where he partook of luncheon, and afterwards visited the departments of the Royal ArsenaL
A number of the principal inhabitants of Woolwich, taking into consideration the distressing condition of the umemployed, who are desirous of emigrating to Canada, have most humanely promised to head a subscription fund which itisproposedtoraise, soes to enable some 300or 400to emigrate free of the Government bounty. It is understood to be in contemplation to freight a couple of line-of-battle ships in which to convey the bulk of the necessitous to the home of their adoption. Each person emploNed in the Royal Arsenal has consented to contribute a h day's pay and the heads of departments have promised their support towards the above-named fund. A public meeting is to be convened on Wednesday next, at the Town-hall, at which General Sir W. Codrington wiU be invited to preside, in order to further the object of the fund.

The Sale Of Poisons.
THE SALE OF POISONS.
TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-You did me the favour, a few weeks since, to publish a letter containing some remarks on poisoning by the essential oil of bitter almonds. Another death appears to have been the consequence of the careless sale of that poison.
Yoiu jpaper of the 10th inst. contains some particulars of a saicideby prussic acid at Bolton. An inquest was held there, and a druggist examined, who stated that he remembered to have sold a pennyworth of the essence to a servant; he further went on to say that " it was commonly sold for cooking purposes, under the name of ratafla."
It does not appear from the inquiry that the person who destroyed herself was the person to whom the essence of almonds was sold; but we are almost led to infer that there must have been some connexion between them, else why have had the druggist as a witness in this particular case ?
In commonwith many other persons I have thought much on the question of the sale of poisons, and, although I feel it to be one set about with many difficulties, yet I think something might be done to lessen the growing evil; and I do hope it may engage the serious attention of onr Legislature durig the oncommg session.
I am told that strychnia is now very commonly sold to, and used by, gamekeepers, for the purpose of destroying vermin. I think this ought not to be. In the two notorious cases which happened last year-viz., of Palmer and of Dove-I do not see very well how strychnia or prassic acid could have been denied to the former person, but surely there was no reason why the wretched man Dove should have been allowed to purchase strychnia.
It is a curious fact that poisoning by oxalic acid, which was so common some years ago, appears now comparatively of rare occurrence. During six yeaTs' attendance at Guyis Hospita4 commencing in the year 1849, I do not remember more than two cases of poisoning by that particular acid being admitted into the house. The substances which appear to be more generally chosen at resent for the destruc. tion of life are those which science has lately given to the wcrld (the alkoids and the cyanides), and, although it may be urged that many of these are largely used in the arts now-a-days, yet I think they should not be permitted to be sold indiscriminately by chynrists, and, if at all, only to those persons whom they may well know use them professionally. Thus I imagine (aithogh eases of accidental death may result from them) we shaUl do much towrards removing that growing evil, that reninement of poisoning, which at present appears to be rivalling the days of Biorgia.
I - am, Sir. vyour obedient sSrv4.,,

North Riding Of Yorkshire Election.
NORBH RIDING OF YORKSHIRE BLROTIOt.
TO TCH EDrITORl OF THE TTRliS,
Sir,-My attention has been drawn to the letter of "J. B.." i your jourtialof the 13th, in refereno to the above electiou. After making all reasonable allowanoe for the soreness of Mr. Dundas friends under their defeat the truths of this remarkable contest should in fairness be told. As a member of Mr. Cayley's central committee, regident in York, which I have just left, I was a witnen of it throughout.
The number of electors in 12,23 ; of these 9,685 polled. Tho candidates were Colonel Doncombe, on the Conservative side; the Hon. J 0. Dandags the Earl of Zetlsnd's brother), on the Whig aristocratical dde; and Mx. Cayley, who has for 25 years represented the independent party in the Riding&
It may be premised that this same battle was fought by the same parties in 1832, br. Dandeds uncle, Mr. RamEden, being thou defeated by Mr. Cayley. But at that election the Conservatives proved so Strong that they tried, although unsuccessfully, to turn Mr. Cayley out in 1835.
The same spirit, in faet, which returned Wilberforoe in 1807 (in spite of an expenditure of a quarter of a million by the honses of Fitzwillanm and Harewood) returned Cayley at these two contests, and has returned him again now.
Sinoe 1823 the riding has been uncontested till this electioD, of which here is an analygis of the poll as sent out by Mr. Dundsa's own committee
This ay speaks, one would think, clear enough for itself.
The spits between "Duncombe and Cayley,' if read in. differently Cayley and Duncombe, and ice versd (which they ought to e), speak the truthastotherealseam of the riding in favour of the two old members. The splits be'ween " Dundes and Duncombe" mean simply the consistent effort made by the Whig families to bring in what "J. B. calls a high Tory in preference to a temperate Reforrer. For these splits tho Dundas party actively canvassed.
The plumpers for Dundas show principally the rural power of the same Whig families, deducting some 700 or oOO for town votes, and the same number snapped up by his agents being first in the field. If there had been the ballot, for which Mr. Dundas contends, the landlords and agents who stood sentinels at the doors of the polling. booths might not have stood him in the stead they did, and he would have been at least 2,000 lower on the poa. Gains. borough and Richmond (of which Reeth is an appanage) are the Dundas strongholds, as Kirbymoorside and part of Thirsk are those of Colonel Dunoomhe.
The plumpers of the latter speak for themselves. His party for a fortnight before the election deemed him un-afe.
Mr. Cayley never canvassed for plumpers til a few days before the election.
When to this it is added that Mfr. Cayley's volunteer canvassers were a week or ten days behind the paid agents of the other candidates-that many districts went wholl
uncanvassed by his friends-that from the first (although offered a large subscription urse) he resolved to make this contest one of principle and spontaneous support-that he employed Lot one paid agent, secured no conveyances, and brought up only about adozen infirm men to the poll; while the other candidates absorbed nearly every solicitor and every vehicle in the riding in their pay, and spent at least 101. for every 11. expended by Mr. Cayley, it re9uires little more to prove which was really the popular candidate, or that this was one of the noblest triumphs ever won at an
Of Mr. Cayley's sentiments it is unnecessarv for me to speak. Youprobably know them quite as weU as " J. B.," wao states that which is not true in referenoe to Mr. Cayley's speech after his election. He said merely that his desire was to support Lord Palmerston as long as he thought him vieht and that he would do the same by Lord Derby or any oter hMiister.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-With reference to the letter of " J. L S.," in 2The Times of the 6th inst., and that of " H." in 1i% Tiam of to-day, it has occurred to me to send you the following extract from the lemoir of the late Bishop Shirley. In a communication to a friend he thus writes from the place of which he was then the vicar (p. 149 of the Memoir) :-" I ams orry to Say tha' I cannot comply with your request that I should take an active part in pronoting Lord Waterpark's eloction. My vote vill be much at his Lordship's service, bht I am anxious, as far as possible, to keep myself clear of electioneering contentions. It is my duty and my desire to be the minister and friend of the whole of my parish, and not of a party only; and I shall therefore studiously avoid presenting myself to my people in the light of a political partisan. Besides which, I really have not time for these matters."
These words of an eminently holy and active man, of one who Ithough dead, yet speaketh" in the admirable memoir which has been published of his life, may be pordered with advantage by the many ministers of the Gospel who, in recently playing a prominent part on the hustinzs, mrust have done so to the prejudice of private pastoral duties in their own parishes; and it is to be feared that the mental disturbance of the electioneering weekday must, like a loc-l disturbance on the surface of the ocean, which extends to far-distant shores, have also in some degreo mado itself felt in the services of the following Sabbath.

The Explosion Near Swansea.-The inquest
THEx Expsio NEAP. SWANS=A-The inquest upon the three persons kiled by the explosion at the Gorse Colliery on the 9th inst. (an account of which appeared in 7he Timaes on Monday last) was held on Wednesday at the Travelee's Well, Casbadell, about two miles from Swansea, and within a short distance of the colliery, before Mr. Charles Collins, coroner for the district, and a jury consisting of 14 persons. Mr. Thomas Evans. Government Inspector of Mines for the South Wales district, was present, and Mr. J. T. Jenkin, solicitor, of Swansea, appearod to watch the proceedings on behalf Messrs. Richards and Glasbrook, the proprietors of the colliery. Several witnesses were examined, brut, as the evidence as to the cause of the explogion was imperfect, the inquest was adjourned to the 29th inst.
VOWE By BAYLOT IN AusTRALyi,-Tho combination of p resent secrecy in the act of voting, with facilities for disclosure if it should be at any future time desirable, is the object of the plan which has been devised by the Legislature of Victoria. The new electoral law for that colony which has been forwarded to England for the Royal assent has been presented to the House of Commons in compliance with an address requiring it; and the provisions relating to the baUot form a curions commentary on the .abuses towch that system in its purity is felt to be liable. The following are the principal features of the scheme :-Alt each polingbooth there are to be provided pen and ink, and a locked box with a slit in the lid capable of receiving the ballot. paper. Into the booth the voters are to enter singly, and no one else, except the returning officer or his deputy and the scrutineers of the candidates, are to intrude under pain of prosecution for a misdemeanour. These scrutineers may be to the number of one for each candidate at each polling place, and they are sworn not to attempt to ascertain for whom any one may vote, or to aid in the discovery of the same, unless legaUy required so to do. The returning officer has a number of printed papers, bearing the names of all the candidates, and sufficient in number for all the electors who may be expected to record their votes. He gives one of these papers to each voter after having satisfied himself as to his title to voteand the voter, retiring, as we understand, behind a screen, crossesoutthe names of all tho candidates for whom he does not intend to vote, and then folding up the paper so as to conceal its contents, drops it into the box. lnat a very imPOrtant precaution has first been taken. The officer writes on the outside of the paper the number which stands OPPOsite to the name of the voter on the register, at the same time checking off the name of the elector on the register itself, which lies before hi.m. The votes, being counted in the presence of the ecrutineers, are sealed up and sent to the clerk of the Legislative Council or Assembly, by whom they are kept two years before being destroyed. By these means it is hoped to evade the heavy objoction to the ballot, that with it there can be no scrutiny, and tbe c^ndidates must be wrholly in the hands of the returnig ofl.oers. If} retii bo disputed, the validity of every vote ,an be e.xamined into by tho identification of the voter -ko& haapigotepler-En1 lrit

Remarks ere w ise made in favour of the adoption of the qstem of alternte work and school daya for boys employed m farm labour. A. commnnication from the Den of Hereford ws reed, in which he expressed his cordil approval of the plans and& principles oi the association, and his most earnest wishes for - its continued success, The treasurer's account showed that,
although the annual subsciption is small-amounting only. to 4s.-there remained a balanoe of several pounds in. hand. The secretry of the Depwade Deanery Agsociation. next read his report, from which It appeared that the soiet
s yet in its infancy; the district occupied by its opera. tions included about one-half of the parishes in the deanery. Its bookcases were well received, and the lectures hl. excited much interest among the people. The third aocia.. tion represented was that for thDeanery of lngworth. Its work had been mainly confined to the town of Aylshamanl its neighbourhood, were for along time effective primary. instruction has been provided, in its different forms, for thePopulation. The meeting, which had been preceded by Divine service in the parish church, ooncluded with the dis. tribution of the prizes to the adult scholar The arch. decon was assisted in this work by Mr. Holmes, who, iDr handing to two of his own labounrers oertificates that they had attended the Brooke evening class on 125 evening . during the winter, observed that he had not two better workmen on his etate than the two then before him. HRis beet labourers, he found, were those who attended the night. school, and he cordially recommended his tenants to pub before their workien the advantages which they wouldt denve from following the example. Archdeacon Bouverig. expressed his desire to adopt the uggestion of the report by offering to the A nentural Association two prizes of it. and 1OL respectitely for those young men, farm labourergm the district, who should be found on examination most proficient in reading, writing, spelling, and elementary arithmetic. On the adjournment of the meeting nearlr 40 gentlemen sat down to dinner, discussing the sub3ects which had been brought before their notice - *nd desiring to extend to other parts of the county the simple and irexpensive machinery by means of which effective instruction might be provided for the rural pOpulation, A resolution has been unanimously passed that3. the deanery associations appeared to be well qualified by their constitution and pslan to seoure the object which they,
desired to promote. The meeting ws attended by personsof every shade of religious opinion; neither of the great sections of the Church was unrepresented, and all expresser n ecrnest desire for the continuance and extension of the work, and a confidence in its ultimate suooess. Erly is,. the evening the party broke up, its constituents returning. to their bomes in the different parts of the county. The Earl of Albemarle, who was present 1lst year, expressed his regret by letter that he could not render his personal assistance at the meeting owing to presting engagements tern Ba7ning, Sir John Boileau, and many other gentlemen ot -nuence in Norfolk had also expressed their fullest concurrence in the object of the asociations, with their earnest hopes for their success, and promises of support in any form in which it might be required. It was stated that
every infornation and detail connected with the plans. which have been adopted would be most gladly rendered to, persons interested in the promotion of the social and moral welfare of our labouring classes by the institution oC agencies similar to those employed by these societies, in. reply to oommunications addressed to the Secretary of the.

The Weavers Of Kidderminster.
TIEE WBA VERs OP KIDDEzBINsTzBr
TO THE EDITOR OF TME TImES.
Sir,-The extract which I subjoin may be interestng to many of your readers, as supplying some details in the pashistory of Kiddermin6ter which do not come within tha scope of " An Old Beformer's" long and valuable letter in Thze Timas of to-day. It is taken from the writings of one whose name is known all over the world, and whose con. nexion with Kidderminster has conferred on the town a distinction of no small value. Richard Baxter carried on his ministry there at the period of the Civil Wars and of tha Commonwealth.
I copy from Baxtes Life and Works, Orme's edition; voL 1, pp. 118 nd 119.
"1 My public preaching met with an attentive, diligent auditory. . . . The congregation was usually full, so that we were fain to build five galleries after my coming thitber; the church ielf being very capacious md thea most commodious and convenient that ever I was in. Our private meetings also were fall. On the Lord's-days there was no disorder to be seen in the streets ; but you might hear a hundred families singing psalms and repeating sermons as you passed through them. In a word, when I camo thither frst there was aboat one family in a street that worshipped God and called on His name, and when I came away there were some streets where there was not one poor family in tho side that did not Po, and that did not, by professing serious godliness, give us hopes of their sincerityaud in those families which were the worst, being inns aui alehouses, usually some persons in each house did seem tobe re]igious.
" Though our administration of the Lord's Supper was so ordere as displeas6ed many, and the far greater park kept avway, we had 600 that were communicants...
" When I set upon personal conference with each. family, and catechizing them, there were very fewr familios in all the town that refused to come, and those few wrere beggars at the towns ends, who were so ignorant that ther
wrere ashamed it hould be manifest ..............Yet many ignorant and ungodly persons there werer still among us; but most of them were in the parish, and not in the town, a.nd in three parts of the parnsh which were farthest from the town."
Till within the last 30 years the wrorking populationK of Kaidderminster did not bear the character which now sounhappily attaches to it. The old Iweavers, whom I have known myself, the remains of the generationswho lived and worked before the great strike of 1828, were mern of an entirely different type from their juniors and suc.
The change in the natuer of the trade of the town has prohably had something to do with this. The staple trade was formerly the manufacture of stuffs and bombaznes, anl the weaver usually had his loom at home. But the manufacture of Brussels carpets has been carried. on in factoriesa where many circumstances combined to exercise a most in. jurious influence uponl the morals of the weavers and their families. Very great advantage in this respect will be fonn'
to result from the recent applicationof st power to thet Brussels carpet-weaving.
Btthe great deterioration of the character of the weave! dso,as Ibleve, from the strike of 1828. Circumstanoes. had made it necesay to reduce the price of wveaving: Brussels carpeting from ls. to lOd. per yard. The wreavers resisted this reduction for six months, and I have frequently been told by one who had known thema intimately all hi5 life,-htmseif a weaver's son,-that from that time tha whole tone of the men had changed-that " the town had. never seemed the same place since."

Lady Franklin's Arctic Expedition.
LADY FAZKLMRS ARCTIC EXPEDITIO1Y.
TO THE1 EDITOR OF TEE TI[MS.
Sir,-I shall feel obliged by or inserting these fevr lines in respect to Lrdy Franklin's expedition JUnded to im your jonrna.l of yesekrday's date, and to the suggeste4i lhoan of the BResolute, whizh would be a groat asisanoe to her.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~to
Cordially assenting in your kind remark that she deserves welle the sympathy of her countrymen, I am anxious to recall to their recollection that this nob'le lady eqipped
almost wvholly at her own cost, three separate expeditious us, search of Sir John Franklin and the missing crewrsof the Erebus and Terror, twro of which wrere despabched to the very locality where vestiges have since been found.
It was the only part not provided for by the swarching squadrons, and by a singl=ar fatality, appesrs to be the spot which, had it been explored, wonld oertinly have le4 to the rescne of some, if not of aM, those engaged in the ex. p2edition.
It zannot, therefore, be a matter of surprise to anyone that Lady Franklin should be more thab ever anxious to
search that haiowed ground where some of the brave spiribs doubtless fell, and thus endeavour to clear up th4 mystery w hich still hangs over their sad fate,
I am one of those who, like Dr. Kane, Captain Hartgtein; and many of. our own experienced Arctic officers, think ih quite possible that there may even yet be survivors; buts whether there are or not, every one must admit that tho sarch Is left in an unsatisfactory stte, and most hearti1 wisjluoe to L%dy Franklin's unparlleled exerVjon0&
I am. Sir. Your obedient servant.
