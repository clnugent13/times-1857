PETITIONS. Petitions were pIresented by Sir R. W. CAJD (lume Tously signed) hom the clergy in the diocess of Gloceswer and Bristol, against the Divorce Bill; by Mr. CceULNO. HA.

GRERNWVOOD, frqm the medical practitioners at Bingley and Keighley, Yorkshire; by Mr. REBOw, from Mr. 8eabroolr, medical practitioner at Brighton, and from Mr. Mann, medical practitioner at Boxford, in Saffolk, in favour of mr. Headlam's Bill; and fromthe same, for a redress of the grievances suffered by surgeons of Poor LAw Unions ; by Mr. IfZAN LEY, from the medical profession resident in Newark- and byMrHmiiaYARcD, from the maedioal officers of Whitehaven Union, praying for a redress of their grievances; by Mr. CARs, from the North-East Agricultural Association of Ireland, for a uniform siystem of weights and measures overI the united kingdom; and by M£r. BtmaXa, from William. Spencer, practitioner of medicine at lIigh Bickington, Devon, praying that the MIedical Profesaion Bill introduced by MIr. Eleadlam may pass into a lawv. FAIRK= BURGHS ELECTION. Mr. COBBETT presented a petition from lMr. James Merry, a member of the House, whose return for the Falkirk distract of burghs was dis.puted, complaining that either a new petition had been substitated on the subject of his election, or that the original document as to which the recognizances had been entered into had been so altered by erasures and interlineations as to make it substantially no longer the same petition. Mr. Merry prayed the House t take into consideration the allegations of his petition, and do him justice on the merits, and either refer it to a select committee or to the committee appointed to try the validity of the election. Ipon the motion of the hon. nd learned gentleman, the petition of Mr. Merry was ordered to be printed with the votes and taken into consideration at 12 o'clock to-morrow (this day). SLIGO ELECTION. Mr. BUTT presented a petition from Mr. J. P. Somers, a member of the House, complaining that at the last election for this borough the petitioner and the Right Hon. John Wynne were candidates; that the petitioner, having a maority of votes, was declared duly elected; that a petition had been subsequently presented agaist the election, re-. speckng whioh an inquiry was now pending; that since then actions had been brought in the Cout of Queen', Bench in Ireland against the returning officer for rejecting votes; that such actions hnd been brought at the instance and carried on at the expense of the said Right Hon. John Wynne; that their institution wvas a breach of the privileges of the House, whose sole right, as he submitted, it was to decide respecting the election of its members; And the petitioner therefore prayed the H[OUse to make such orders as they might thnk expedient. On the maotion of the hon. and learned gentleman the petition was ordered to be printed and taken into consideration at 12 o'clock to-morrow (this day). POOR LAW MEDICAL OFFICERS. Iu reply to Mr. MIOoDY, Mr. BOIUVERIE said that under the Poor Law Amendment Act the overseer was entitled in cases of urgent necessity to give an order for medical relief to such persons as he thought required it. A case of this kind, alluded to by the hon. gentleman, had occurred in the Somersetshire union, but afterwards the guardians, not believing it to be a case of urgent necessity, refused to allow such relief. The medical officer, in consequence, brought an action against the overseer in the County Court, and the judge dedded that the overseer was not personally liable. As far as he (Mr. Bouverie) had the means of judging, that decision was right in point of law, nor had the Poor Taw Board (though they had offered some advice to the guardians in the particular case referred to) any intenltion of altering the general law in tbis respect, Cartainly medical officers of unions seemed exposed to some hardships in such a case, but, at the same time, those gentlemen had the power of protecting themselves, because they could judge whether the case which they were called upon to attend was one of urgent necessity, and if it was not they could decline to act upon the order of the overseer. Medical officers, however, should be very careful in exercising their discretion in such instances, because if, after al, the case turned out to be one of urgent necessity, they would be held responsible. MAYO MELCTION. Mr. SOHOLEFIELD moved that the evidence taken before the Mayo Election Cormmittee should be printed; and gave notice that to-morrow he should move the usapension of the writ until the evidence was placed in the hands of members. (Hear, hear.) JUDGMENTS EXECUTION, &c., BILL. The House went into committee on this Bil, Mr. BouvE= in the chair. On clause 5, Xr. AYRTON wished to know what steos had ben taken to bring the Bill under the notice of thoe aw officers of the Crown, and what determination they had comoto respecting It. Tho LORD ADVOCATE said the law officers of the Crown had held no consultatlon on the subject dnce the Bill was last in committee. Puch a consultation na"on-x _: ^l50-% in measure w.. 'Arp suvr provisions of which they had already acweded. Colonel FRENCE asked, whether another day was to be vasted in an attempt to force upon Ireland a Bitl which the Irish rmembers were determined to resist? He mnoved that tho Chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again. Mr. HEADLAM approved theprincipleof thoBillWnd-7d supported it throughout. He could not help thinking, however,thatthelHousehaddevotedas much timeto its discusson as was due to its importance, or as was fair to other hon. mermbers whose measures were now pending. (Rear.) If there had been any reasonable chance of the bill passing this session, he 'might have continued to support it ; but looking at the determined opposition offered to its progress, he thought no such chance existed, and he should therefore voto in favour of reporting progress. (Hear, hear.) The committee then divided. The numbers Were.- For reporting progress ... ... ... 33 Againstib ... ... ... - ... 58 Majority -.. ..-25 Mr. MAGUIRE said that the opponents of the Bill wer, quite determined that it should not pass this year, and he suggested that the hon. member who had introduced it should submit it to the Lord-Advocate for Scotland, the Attorney-General for England, anid the Attorney.General for Ireland, to be by them considered and amended; then, if the hon. aud learned member would introduce it in aa amended form next session, he (Mr. Maguire) would support it. Under the present circumstances he moved that the Chairman do leave the chair. The LORD-ADVOCATE regretted that the Irish mine hers were so unanimously opposed to this rmeasure, hecause he did not see how it affected Irishmen any more than Englishmen or Seotchmen. As there certainly was no prospect of passing it, however, during this session, he suggested to his hon. and learned friend that he should zot further proceed with it at- present, although he maust express hig regret that an opposition which, so far as he knew, had never been based on any iatelligible principle, should have been successful in opposing the progress of the Bill. (Hear, Mr. SPOONER said that the opposition to this Bill was by no means confined to Ixish members; for many Englishmen objected to it on the ground that, under it, judgments obtained in the Scotch courts, by a procedure of which no one knew anything, might be entered in the courts of London, and would come into as full force as if they had been obtained by a procedure subject to all the guards and precautions which the English law threwround it. (Hear, hear.) Mr. r'CALNN also opposed the Bill, being persuaded as a mercantile man that it was fraught with most dangerous principles, and that it might lead to fraudulent and collusive judgmnents. Mr. WATRIN said that although ho had hitlerto beon cOnsistent in supportisg the Bill, he thought, considering the period of the session, that it ought to be withdrawn for the present. Ee regarded the Bill as a stop in the right direction, and hb thought that if the hon. member for Avr magnanimously consented to withdraw it at this time, he ought to bave an assarance from the Government that they would introduce it in an amended form as a Government measure next session. (Hear, hear4 Be supported the Bill because'it tended to produce uniformity in the law, aud to prevernt the anomaly of having one law for lngland, another for Ireland, and another for Scotland, when all were under the same Imperial Government. Mr. CQlliUFURD said that, after the appeal which had been mnade to him by the Lord-Advocate and by other hon. members, ho thought that he should best discharge his duty by not further pressing the Bill during the present session Re must observe, however, that the Bil as it now stood had received the approval of all tho law offlcers of the Crown, that .it had now been proceeded with as far as the 9th Olnuse, and that not a single material amendment had been tiade in the framework or phraseology of the measure. Be 4ssw ao Teason why the subject which the Bill contemplated should not be undertaken by a private member, and he gave notice that next session he should again a'ddress himself to it, and shoultiLe-introduce a similar measure upon the subject. After some fartber4bservations, The CK&israrLN left4he chair, and the House resumed. ZARIRID WOMEN BILL On the motion for the -seond reading of this Bill, Sir J. Y. BULLEEl rose to move as an amendment, on behalf of his hon. and &earned friend the member foWaLingf4rd, that the ,BIA be? read a second time this day three nmonths. i}e btAlieved that the measure was calculated to intrviuce into families a great deal of discomfort and disi)wsionl. It was not his intention, he said, to enter into a detail of teo difficulties which wrould be likely to atfse m ider the Bid if it became law, because they were of too deL Icate a nataro to be canvassed in that House; btt he migh0 state his belief that there were very few mothers of famil es, having the control of property which they ought todevo. '%e tthe benefit of the whole of their children a&Lke, who w di. L avenerve and composure enough to refuse togrant peuniarya i(roAny one of their children-say their first-bore-wlo mistlcsand in geed of such assistance, (Hear, seae.) 4gen, 1lABill as It stood, a 6'arAea woman becoming poseetd of property aftermarriage ad the power of alienating that property, and of dealirg With it as she pleased. She might, with tho best intmtions, lay it out, without consulting her husband, in Uson worthless railway shares or in some unround sr.eculatien, and the husband might find that the whole of that property, to which be bha looked, perhaps, for the maintenance of himself during his lifetime, and for the benefit of his chDdren afterwards, had been swvept away. Ee believed that the Bill had been intro. duced to meet nn exceptional class of cases, which onght to be dealt with separately-such as where a wife who lived apart from her hasband entered upon some business by herself, and therefrom acquired property, which in the present state of the law the husband couad take possession of. He did not attempt to defend that state of things, but he did not consider that such cases belonged to society at large; and he thought that, as a general measure, theBill was uncalled for. Of coure he could not be expected to enter into the legal and technical objections to the measure, but in the absence of his hon. and learned friend he had no hesitation in moving as an amendment that it be read a second time this day three months. (B3esr) Mr. . liES, whose name was on the back of the Bill, stated that he regarded the question far more as a socil than as a legal one. The position of married women in this country was peculiar in this respect, that there existed- with regard to them a law, which applied to all married wonen alike, unless they entered into an express contract for the purpose of modifying or avoiding that law. The object of the ill, then, was to make the law for all classes that which by custom it had become for the wealthy classes, forit very rarely happened that on the marriage of a womau possessing property her property was not made the sabject of the most careful arrangement. This had produced the most striking conflict between the commou,law and equity on this matter; for while the former declared that the wife could hold no property, yet equity allowed her to hold property settled on her at the time of the marriage, and to bequeath it according to the terms of the gattlemeat. Again, by the common law the husband had a right to the earn ngs of his wife; but it was held in equity that the wife had an absolute right to all earnings connected with tho settled property. It was said that the cases quoted in support of a Bill like the qresent were pecu}iar cases, bitt he maintained that they were such as might happen at any time. Take the two cases mentioned by Mr. UnderSecretary Waddington. One was the case of a lady possess. ing considerable property who married a man by whom she was treated with great crnelty; she was deserted, and left almost peness by him. The man died Boon after, and then she discovered to her horror that she was left entirely penniless, all her property being beqiueathed by her husband to an illegitimate son of hli. Another case was that of a woman whose husband had committed a brutal assault on her, for which he was condemned by a court of law. In the meantime, her father dying, a considerable portion of property devolved to her. That property under the law went to the husband, and he being a felon escheatedto the Crown. Nothing buLt some suchalteration in the:law aswas proposed by the present Bill could meet that state of things. The hon. gentleman then referred to the French law-to the rs6gime dotal and to the communaut dc biens; observing that the first resembled the marriage settlement in this country, and that the latter, which was the practice followed in 99 cases ort of 100, established the common possession of property by husband and wife, no portion of that property being capable of alienation without the consent of both parties. On suficient grounds, however, either party could apply for a setparation de biews, and then the property of the wife would be secured to herseLf. Perhaps it rmight be said that this would be a more desirable state of the law than that which was now proposed to be enacted, but he did not think so, as it was not applicable to the state of domestic life in this country, and might tend to familiarize the people to an objectionable degree with the idea of separaton between man and wife. At the same time he believed that the rejection of a measure like the present would lead to the adoption of such a state of things as he had just described. It might be said that at this late period of the session it would not be advisable to proceed with the consideration of the present Bill, particularly as another Bill, with some similar provisions, ws likely soon to come underdiscussion. That other measure, however, was connected with the establishment of a new court of divorce; and as it might not be carried in that House he trusted that the second reading of the present measure wouldbeassented to. LordBrougham had placed a reform of the law in respect to this subJect on a level with the abolition of the slave trade aud other great measures of that kind, and those who talked of the chance of domestic peace being disturbed by such an enactment as the present should hear in mind that they would disturb that domestic peace much more by leaving the law as it stood. The present condition of married women was in the zesects to wvhich the Bill referred alien to our habits and feelings, and it would be nerogadT rynt to attempt o improve that ungenerousand unmanly not Mr. MASSEY said, that as he understood from the hon. and learued memberfor Devonport (Sir E. Perry) that he had communicated with the Attorney-General on the subject of the present Bill, and that that law ofEcer approved it, but was desirous of introducing some extensive nodifliaisons into tho measure, he should support the second reading. There was a distinction in the mode in which the propertyof married women was treated by courts of common law and courts of equity, and as there was that conEfict of jurisdiction it might well be said that the matter was not at present in a satisfactory state. Whether the provWions of the Bil were in accordance with the state of the law recognised by the courts of equity and with the habits of society in this country was another question. Some of those provisions appeared to stand in need of careful revision, or they might disturb the whole of the relations of married life, an,d revolutionize all the principles which applied to the rights of property in this country. (Eear, hear.) He admitted the great hardship which was suffered by a woman in not having, when separated from a profligate husband, the power of applying theproceeds of her own industry to her own subsistence or to the sns3istence of her children. He did not believe that It was not possible for the Legfislature to nnd a reuxeuy for snar evm, lar ruemter of the 4th clause of the Bill relating tothe earnings of a wife in separate trade would be to set every creditor at defiance, and to drive the estate of husband and wife into the Court of Chancery. (Hear, hear.) When he saw one particalar and known gevance dealt with in a manner so loose and unsatisfactory ho could not but givo his assent to the proposed second readIng, with the qulfcation that the Bill required the most careful consideration. He believed that such a Bill must nodergo the careftl revision of a committee Upstairs, composed of lawyers and others in whose judgmernt the Hlouse waslikelytoplaceconfidence. (HIear,hear.) Theexisting state of things calledfor legislation, bat it must be cautious legislation, and he feared that at the present advanced state of the sesdon the hon. andlearned gentleman woaldscarcely be able to induce a sufficient number of gentlemen to consent to act as a committee to consider the BilL However, the hon. and learned gentleman would partly have attained his object by ventilating the question, and next year, whether taken up by him or any other member, it would be felt to deserve the attentive consideration of Parliament. Mr. HIADFIELD thought the measure should be referred to a select committee, and that it then might be put in a ratisfactory state. There was not a more pressing evil than the atate of the law with respect to married women. Mr. SPOONER trusted that the Bill would bo with. drawn. He thought the House was not prepared to adopt the principle of the measure, which began by saying that a married woman should be capable of being sued as if she were a fcmnaws sole, without the slightest reservation that she should be sued only for mnatters arising under the Bill. That was a principle the House could not sanction Bo far as to pass the second reading of the BilL Again, it was provided that no marriage solemnized after the passing of the Bill should make any change whatever in the property possessed either by the husband or the wife except in so far as it should be specified in any settlement made before marriage. How many marriages ho should like to know in the middle classes took place in which settlements were not made? The higher classes would be exemptedfrom the operation of this Bill, but what would be its effect on the lower classes? The moment a married woman acquired property after marriage the whole of the existing lawv in respect to such property would be suspended. He was prepared for some change in the law; and if the BiU were confined to the sing e object of protecting the wife's property against the husband, in cases where the wife was separated by decree of court or by agreement, so that she aight possess the means of livelihood for herself and familT, he should not object to it, but he could not consent to send to a committee upstairs- a Bill like the present containing unsound and objectionable principles. Mtr. B AGWELL suggested that the BiU ought to be extended to Ireland. Sir B. PERRY said, he had no objection to adopt that Buggestion, but, as the Govermment assented to the second reading of the Bill, he could not follow the advice of the hon. member for North Warwickshire, and withdraw the BilL The principle of the Bil was not to be found, as that hon. member conceived, in the first clause, or in a word of a clause, but in the preamble,which declared that the law of property with respect to married womern was unjust in pnnciple and grievous in operation, and ought to be altered. The first clause, to which the hon. member objected, was intended to give to aU nnarried women the same rights as those only possessed now who had settle- ments. The common law of the land gave the whole of the property of the wife, whether acquired before or after marriage, to the husband. Hie contended that that principle was unsound, and that it behoved that Honse to amend it. He had not heard any Objection of validity urged to the BilL The hon. Under-Secretary for the Home Department had objected to the fourth clause, respecting the earnings of a wife in separate trade, and the hon. gentleman was not, perhaps, aware that in the city of London such a usage existed. A married woman living with her husband, but carrying on a separate trade, was there entitled by lavw to all the profits of that trade, and might be made bankrupt. That law had existed from time imnenorial, and worked well. The objections which had been urged to the Bill were objections of detail, and he should be most wiUing to take them into consideration. With this feeling, be readily adopted the suggestion of the Under-Secretary for the Home Department to refer the Bill to a select com. mittee-a course which he proposed some veeks ago to the hon. and learned mrember for Wallingford (tr. Mains), but which was rejected by him. The Attorney-General for Ireland assented to his proposal that the Bill should be referred to aselect committee, and if the Governmnentwould give a pledge that that course should be adopted he (Sir . Perry) would not press the Bill this session. He could not, however, consent to withdraw the Bi immedtiately, and for tbis reason. Irt a few days a very important measure, the Divorce Bill, would be brought under the consideration of the Houme. During the discussiorL which occurred with reference to that measure in another place several clauses had been introduced with the object of protecting the interest of married womet. It was very probable that the Divorce Bill vould encounter great opposition n that House (bear, bear), and hethought it most desirs&le if that Bill choudd be thrown out that some xi the claneecin the present measure hould be discussed at a norning lt.ig in order tha the nature of the obiectione antertained to hoern might he clearly understood. The sub. t 4gbt PheW e wefe,rrerl rg a Belect committee. ani h. boped that beforo tho end of the next sesion of Parliament those blots which now rendered the law of England on this subject a scandal mlght be remored. The course proposed by this Bil had been sanctioned by tbe Eoman lawyers, who were masters of jurisprudence, and byoar brthren in the United States, vho had sO far amended the common law of; England. Mr. MILES recommended the hon. baronet (Sir J. Y. Boller) to withdraw his amendment. He thought many of tho clauses would operate very beneficially, and he hoped that next session the measure might be presented to the House in such a fotm that they would be enabled to give it theirsauction. MIr. J. D. FITZGERALD understood it ws intended to propose the extension of the mesumre to Ireland, and he coui therefore onl assent to the second reading of the Bill under protest ("H ear," and a laugh.) He did not regard this Bill as one calculated to amend the law, but to effect a complete revolution in the law, whlch would disturb all the relatiens of husband and wife. (Flear, hear.) He could not help saying that it was, in his opinion, a most rashly constructed measure (bear, kear), and one which was likely to lead to very mischlevous consequences. He was far from maintaining that the law affiectig husband snd wife did not require amendment, bit he thought it was a most dangerous experiment to attempt such a change as would be effected by this measure. The Bill would enable a married woman to contract what debts she pleased; to bind herself personally; to enter into litigation, tosue and besned, withoutthe kiiowledgoorcontrol of a husband or trustee; and the consequence might be that a gentleman who was strongly attached to an extravagant wife might find ber arrested at his dinner table in respect of transaetions of wrhich he hadno cognizance whatever. It had been said that married women were now llole to be sued. If a married woman was possessed af property settled to her sole and separate use which the husband could net touch, she was not liable to be sued; bat if she entered into engagements under circumstances which the law con. sidered pro tanto an appointment of her property, proceedings might be taken In equity for the application of the property to the discharge of her liabilities. He thought this Bill would in fact afford the maeans of effocting a sammary divorce between husband and wife. Re would gladly assist his hoa. and learned friend in endeavourlug in com. mnttee to amend the law relating to husband and wife, but if this Bill were to be read a second time hemustenter his protest 'aluSt its principle, which he regarded as far too large, and lts details which he thought would be found to operate most injuriously. 3Mr. ROEBUCK said, his hon. wad learned friend who last addressed the House had spokea of this Bil as an experiment, but he must be aware that ita principle had been adopted in al those countries which were subject to the Roman law. The object of the Bill wag to continne the wife as a legal entity after her marriage, whereas by the present law of England her marriage merged her existence in that of her husband. She could not acquire property, although ahe maight contract debts; and it frequently happened, especially among the poorer classes, that wlhen the -ife of a profligate husband who had deserted her succeeded to property the dranken rascal came in and seized everything she had acquired. He (Mr. Roebuck), therefore, hailed this endeavour to remedy such a disgraceful atate Of the law with the greatest satisfaction (hear, hear), aud he hob d the Honse would assent to the second reading of the Mr. DE VERE said, if he had required any inducement to vote against the Bill it 'was afforded by the statement of his hon. and learned friend that he intended in committee to propose the extension of ite provisions to Ireland. (oHear," and laughter.) lie was far from desiring the applfcation of the measure to Ireland, and on looking over the Bill the clause which struck him as lest open to objec. tion was that which provided that the measure should not extend to Ireland. (Laughter.) He did not oppose the Bill because he considered that the law affecting husband and wife was not capable of very great improvement, bnt because he believed such imnprovements would not be effected by thi3 measure, which would, on the contrary, have a tendency to interrupt and destroy the intimate and confidential relations which ought to exist between husband and wife. Sir J. BULLER said, if he correctly understood that the hon. and learned member for Devonport (Sir E. Perry) merely proposed to read the Bill a second time, and then to abandon it or the present session, he was ready to withdraw his amendment. Sir E. PERRY did not entertainthe slightest expectation of passing the Bill this session; but if it should be read a second time he hoped that, in the event of the Divorce Bill being thrown out, the Honse wvould consent to discuss, at a morning sitting, the principles embodied in this measure. Sir J. BULLER intimated that, mnder the circumstances, he felt it his duty to press the amendment. The House then divided, when tlhero were,- For the second reading ... - .120 For the amendment... ... .. ... 65 Majority ... ... ... ... - The Bill was ascordingly read a second time. SCIENTIFIC AND LITERAllY SOCIETIES BILL The HIouse then went into committee on this Bill, Mr. THOIoEJLY in the chair. On clause 1 being read, Mr. HUTT stated that the object of the Bill was to ILnend the 6th and 7th Victoria, which provided that scientific and literary institutions generally should be exempted from the payment of local rates. Fsom the construction put Upon the termsof that statute by various decisions of courts of law the intentions of its framers had been in a greatmeasure defeated, and the present effect of the Act 6th and 7th Victoria was to benefit literary and cientific societies established by the wealthier classea. He wished by this Bill, which he had introduced at the request of the SocietYg of Arts, to extend the exemption from local taxes to mechanics' institutions ana the humbler class of literary societies which had Ibeen establshed by the spontaneous efforts of the people for their own instruction and improvement. He trusted that, as the object of the measure wat to promote popular edrtcatlon, 5r would receive the, anction of the House. The clause was agreed to. On clause 2, Mr. SPOONBE, moved the omission of tho words "sciene " and " literature," observing, that the exemption of institutious devoted to such purposes from local rates would, in towns where thoso rates were extremely heavy, increase the burden of taxation thrown upon hard-working mechanics and artisans. He was desirous of limitiun the exemption to institutions established for strictly educational purposes. Mr. W. EWART supported the clause, 1Mr. JOHN LOCKEF supported tho amendment, becanse it tended to narrow the operation of the Bill, to the priaciple of which be was altogether opposed on the ground that it was wrong to tax, for the support of institutions of this kind, large numbers of the community who, as in Southwark, which he represented, derived no benefit whatever Mr. B. P. BOUVERIE thought it would be harl on the hon. member for Gateshead (Mfr. Hutt), after the House had affirmed the principle of the Bill, to emasoulate it in the way which the amendment proposed to do. HIe agreed thas it was undesirable to carry these exemptions from rating further than they had already gone, but the committoe would bear in mind that the exemption sought to be established by this Bill was one which aiready existed in some cases, and that this was only an attempt to apply that exemption to analogous institutions which it was doubtful whether the existing lavw intended to embrace. Mr. PULLER said, if he had to choose between institutions purely educational and those of a scientific and literary kind so-caued, he ohould elect in favour of mechanics intitqkteg and societies of that kind, which were osainontly educational and useful to the humbler orders of the community, and therefore well entitled to the exemption sought to bs established by the clause as its stood. MWr. BERESFORD.HOPE supported tho clause as it stood, contending that it was the duty of Parliament, and of all who wished to see the education of the people promoted, rather to stretch a point on the side of mercy and generosity than to seek to impose harsh and unnecessary restrictions on tho enfranchisement and development of institutions and societies of the kind contemplated by this Bill. He also reminded the committee that, with the divided opinions of the country, a national system of education was impossible, and contended that they ought to fill up the existing gap as weUl as they could. Mr. RIDLEY considered that the Bill was simply a supplementary measure to an existing Act of Parliament, and was only meant to carry out the original intention of that Act on point which had been ambiguously expressed. He therefore supported the clause as it stood. Mr. AYRTON supported the amendment, but at the same time objected to the principle of the Bill, holding, as he did, that no house, land, or building ought to be ea- i empted from rating, unless exclusively used by the whole of the inhabitants within the particular area of rating. Colonel SYKES supported the clanse as it stood, as did also Colonel THompsoN, the rormer on the ground that it was merely explanatory of an existing Act. Mr. PEASE passed an eulogiEm on literary and mechanics' institutions, and claimed for them every kind of encouragement that the Legislature could extend to them, on the ground that for the last 30 years they had been incalculably usefal in educating the humbler orders of the Community. Mr. PALK complained of the loose wav in which the clause was drawn, and expressed his apprehension that in some cases it might possibly from that cause have a dangerous or undesirable operation. Sir W, JOLIUFFFE believed that extremely little benefit would be derived from exemption, because it rendered such institutions unpopular, and in nine cases out of ten merely increased the value of the premises and the amonnt of rent. MIr. T. COLLINS, jun., thongh favourable to mechanies' Intitutions, was opposed to exempting them from rates. The committee thon divided upon Mr. Spooner's amendment, anad the numbers were, For the amendment ... ... 81 Against it ... , .. L Majority against the amendment ... -50 The words "science and literature" were therefore retained. Mr. BOIJVERIE moved the omission of the word "educatiOn' in the 14th line of the same clause, Ile would not have objeeted to exempt schools for the poor, but the word education was so general that it would exempt establsments of a very different kind. Mr. EWAPRT wished to retainI the word. Ir. HARDY was opposed to all exemptions and wonld support the amendment of the right hon. gentleman. He would move by and by the incrtion of the word "exclusively" to test the feelng of tho committeo, and to asoertain whether they wished to exempt societies, nominally literarxy and scientific, but in reality enjoying allthe luxuric of a. London club.i )Xx, POJ;113? said, there was no foundation for the sup-J position that the words of the Clause would exempt sacl clubts a the Atheaium blr. W. MI LES sugested the sabstitation of "elemen. tanr or eveniing Feboo1s .tablished for the use of the poor,?' for the vagnetermn "edacatlon." Mr. BOUVERIE would be very wMv1ing to exempt xnca schools, but he was told It wa impossible to bring them tnder the operation of this Bill, which contemplateaocie ties having rules established for their rasnagement. The coimmittee divided, and there voted- For the amiendmnent . ... . 11 Against it ... ... ... .. .. 8 Majority ... ... ... -29' The word "education i was accordingly expunged. Mr. HARDY moved theinsertion of the word "fine before the word "arts." Mr. H UT'r opposed the motion, on the ground that whilO, it would exempt from the payment of rates galleries oh paintiDg and st.atuary, it would include institutions estsblished for teaohing reading, writing, and arithmetic, and. for instructing the people mn thearit of ehymistry and alL branches of knowledge which mnight eillustratd by expeu_ments. Mr. PALK saupported the Totion, ai. &Mr. W. RWATm opposed it. The committee then divided, when the numbers were,- For the motion . ... ... ... 97 Against it . 96 Majority .. .-1 The word " fine" was eonaequently insertd. Mr. BERESFOELD.HOPE moved the insertion after the, word " arts" of the words " or elementary instruction.* Mr. BOu VEzUI sAda, the eommintteehad already decidea that the exemption should not be caried faxther than at. present. Fle therefore opposedtheamendment. The amnendment was negatived without a division. Mr. RARDY toved the insertion of the word ;'exclusivelyr after the word. "arts." The effect, he aid, woul&' be to confine the exemption to those buildings2 or parts ofbuildings, which were devoted excluslvely to science, literature, or the fine artg. Mr. BUTT opposed the amendment, whi was mereretention of the existing law. Mr. JOHN LOCKEWas of oplnion that somelimitatior2 should be imposed. Mr. W. BWART thought the clause as it stood waqsufficiently restrictive, and therefore opposed the amendmient. Ir. PEASE hoped the House would not aSsent to an.- amendment, the effect of which would be to exclude,mechanices' institutes from the advantages or tshe Bill 1E hon. gentlemen objected to those institutions; or were oP posed to the spread of education by such means, they ahou l± say so in terms. Colonel SYKES wished to know Whether, If the amend. inent should be carried, the takdlg of a newspaper by P.. meebaics' instituto would. exclude it from the operation or the Bill? Mr. HARDY thought it wAs unfair that those who ob.. jected to the form of thist Bill should. be denounced as objecting to the spread of education. (Hear, bear.) Thetamendment was intended. only to place the matter in the.- sFne position as it was in at preent. Without the amendment the clause would only give rise to litigation. With. the amend ment there wrould ho no difficulty, as the law haa} been already clearly laid down by the j tdges. The committee then divided, when there appeared,- For the amendment .- - .. 14 Against .. ... .. . .. 69 Majority ... . .. 5.. 4 Ir. HUT said, after the decision of the committeeo whioh entirely changed the object of the measure, he did notz think it would be of any use to proceed further, and he, therefore should. move that the Chalrn report progress,. (Hear.) The CnAtrctAN accordingly reported progress, and tbue, House resumued. MEDICAL PROFESSION (No. 1) BP Mr. HEADLAM, before moving that the order for th.- committee upon this Bil be disclhaged, wished to say a fewwords in explanation. After the House had assented to the second reading of the Bill it became the duty of those_. who were charged with the conduct of ittoconsiderwhether there wvas any prospect of being able to pass it during thE precent session. It appeared to them that it would be use. less to proceed at present. He wished, however, to call thu.. attention of the Goverument to tis3 important and difficulty: saubject, and as the House had by a considerable madoritsanctioned the measure he had introduced be thought itt would be the duty of the Government to bring in a BilL based upon the same principles. (Eear.) Should they dcc so, he undertook to give it his most earnest support; but if they should not do so, or should seek to legsate in the spirit of their recent Bill, he should offer his most strenuouse opposition. The hon. momber thenx moved that the ordeL± for the committee be discharged, The motion was agreed to, and the Bill accordingly watwithdrawn. SUPPLY. The Report of Supply wras brought u~ ~dp agreed to, with the exception of the vote for civl- contingencies. which, at Sir H. Willoughisy's suggestion, was poA... poned. *LAMBETHE LECTION.

Tar NEW HousrS or PARLJANmT-T.-The tim8is now come when judgments can be fairly formed by the unprofessional eye-to which architectural lelevationues and " projections" are hopeless mysteries-upon the tDtal and fnal effect of the new Houses of Parliament frora certain pointR of view; and It may be well to point out to a, publio proverbially indifferent to the excelleno of wbat is_. their own the faotthat their 3metropolis now affords arL architectural coup dcacil such as, for magnificence, it is no, exaggeration to say the world cannot match. The three. principal towers, respectively of the enormous heigbts of NA0. 320, and 300 feet, as seen, for example, from Westminster-bridge, constitute in combination with the variousmicor elevations of the louvres, or smoke-sbafts, and the raised rooEs of the extremities of ihe edifice a spectacle which we irnagine that few persons can have lookced upon for the first time without a powerful emotion of wondertanL delight. From this point of view the vastness of the nasses, the eye-exciting altitude to which they soar, and the etronbut harmonized contrasts in which they stand to each other are elements of effect that are scaroely at all diminished bh the frippery of the ornamentation, which is, in fact, entirely overwhelmed by these noble and forcible features. Let us candidly confess that this one view is of a magniil- cence not wholly disproportionate to the prodigioas cost oiFmoney at which we havepurchased it; and let us not refuss. to enjoiy the sight of it for reasoRs which, if alloweed to infiuence us in other cases, would deprive us of the Power ofderinng pleasure from some of the greatest effortsof iAscient, architectural art.-National Raicw, new number.

IONBY-MAiRKT and OITYINTBLLIaGNCE. Wednesday Evening. -ho alarm among the numerous apvculators for a vrise has increased to-day, and many large sales have been effected in order to close accouuts. Con-o9 1;or money, which left off yesterday at 91i to 92, -ere first quoted 91i. Several fluctua'ious then followed, and at length the price declined to 914. tA slight rally then occurred, and the latest trausac- tions were at 91i to g f6r money, and 9QI to & for rt-he end of the month. The public during the day thowed a disposition to make purchases, but there -were also some considerable realizations, amion?1 -which was one on account of the Court of 'Chancery. The sole cause for the growing *-iistrust seemed to consist in the idea of the large 'eipenditure which the present movement of troops -will involve, and the deficiency likely to occur in ,the lndian revenue from the disorganization of the --ountry and the plunder already effected of the ,public Treasuries. WYith regard to the geueral intelligence by the last mail, all doubt as to whether ,the public ae in full posseasion of its worst detaw!s -was removed last night by the declaration of the tGovernment that nothing has been kept back. 33ank Stook left off at 213k to 215; RAeducd, 91i --o i; Noew Three per Cents., 9la to;; India Stock, :213 to 215; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3X. pm. India-bonds experienced a further docline in conise* quence of the uncertainty as te the manner in -which the India Company will raise the aupplies that nust now be needful, a ad the last quotation was -90s. to lOs. discount. In the Stock-Exchange to-day the rate for loans on Government securities was 5q per cent. In the ,discount-market, also, there was an increased -demand, and at the Bank the applications for short advances were rather numerous. The anticipations, however, of a reduction in the rate to1norrow appear to. gain strength. The transactiona in foreign securities have been -ehiefly confined to Turkish. The Six per Cents. .,opened at a fall of 0 from the last prices of yester- day, and grad13tly receded to the close, when. they -were fully 11 lower. She Four per Cents.

The corn-market this mnorniig was again extremely lteavy, and sales could not have been forced even at -1he decline of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per *Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening wtre 466f. 65c. for money and 66f. 80c. for the end of the -2nonth, showing another decline of an eightb. A further sum of 120,0001. in gold was sold to the 33ank to-day, principally Australian, but partly American. At a meeting of the Royal Mail Steam Company -to-day the proposed terms of amalgamation with the Euroncan and Australian Mail Company, an outline of which was given in Tlle Timed of Friday, were approved by a large majority. An amendment was moved, but was supported by only 14 votes. The Ceylon Railway Company have received a notification from the Government that their terms have been finally sanctioned; and the guaranteed interest of 6 per cent. will accordingly accrue upon - all the shares from the 6th inst. The Scottish Australian Company have issued their report, preparatory to a mneeting on the 24th. After writing off 3,7261. for bad asets, the accounts eholv a profit of the half-year of 11,0741., out of -which a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent. Dpr annum is proposed, leaving 1,0741. to be carried to 1he reserved fund, which will thus be augmented to 5,9iGl. The contacttor tho sale of the1Boa Accord property has been conipleted, and the results will appear in the next accounts. The half-yearly meeting of the London and WVestminster Bank took place this afternoon, Mr. Aldermnaan Salomons in the chair, when the report and accounts were unanimously adopted, and a dividend and bonus were decLared at the rate together of 18 per cent. per annum, free of income-tax. The chairman congratulated the proprietors upon the steady progress of the bank, and the confidence reposed in it by the public, as shown by an increase of nearly 2,500,000l. in the deposits. He observed -that a sure means to maintain that confidence was -to have a large reserve fund. He proposed, therefore, to let the rest, or surplus, accumulate by the addition of 5 per cent. yearly upon its capital, and also any unappropriated profits at the close of each year, until it shall reach 250,0001. He further explained that 10,2711., balance of profit and loss after payment of the dividend, is to be carried forward to meet liabilities extending over the succeeding six months, and to provide for the contingency of reduced profits during that period. A question haing been put respecting the item of 2,(C001. for the building fund, the chairman stated that the whole of the expense for the new buildings -will be cleared off in about five years. The resolulion for increasing the rest, or surplus fund, was then agreed to. The following is an abstract of the report and accounts:- " The directors have to report that, after making provision for all bad and doubtful debt-, paying the income-tax, and setting apart 2,0001. towards the new buildings in. Lothbbry, Bloomsbury, Temple-bar, and Southlwark, the net profits of the last half-year amount to 104,0211. Out of this sum the directors have allowed interest at the rate of 5 per cent. upon the rest or surphis fund, and they now declare a div2dend to the sharebolders at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, and also a bonus of 6 per cent. upon the capital. After these payments are made there is a balance of 0,2711., which is carried forward to the credit of the profi and loss account for the current half-year. Tbe Malance of 9781. remaining unappropriated from the profits of the year 1856, the directors have placed to the credit of the surplus fund, whicb, with the addition of 3,W. intereat, amounts to 154,7281.

In answer to a question respeot ing that portion of the report relatingto a mfxm-cvm -dividend of 20 per cent, th chairman stated it was not proposed to declare a divdend at that rate smnles the profie should in additiQu be sufilvient to make the usual provision for the reserved fund. In the event of the profits not reaching that point the dividend only would be affected, the addition to the reserved fund remaining unaltered. It was further stated that none of the directors were in debt to the bank, that a complete audit of the stocls and Securities held is made quarterly or oftener, and that the directors regularly examine the register of transfers. The folloing is an abstract of the report a-nd account:- " The directors have the satisfactiorL of informing the proprietors that, after payment of all charges, and including the sum of 257,7711. for interest paid and due to custouers on their current and deposit aecounts; nmaking aumple provieion for all bad and doubtful debts, and deduct*ag 20,0511. for rebate of bills not due, the net profits of the year ending the 30th of June last amount to 1.36,2261. The directors now declare a dividend of o per cent., and a bonus of 7A per cent., for the last six months, which, with the dividend and bonus paid in January last, amount to 20 per cent., clear of income-tax, for the year, and they have added 23 per cent on the paid-up capital to the reserved fund. After payment oft e dividend and bonus for the year, amounting to 20,000., and the addition of 15,0001. to the reserved fund (which will thus amount to 150.000h), an unappropriated sum remains of 20,351!. to bh carried to profit and loss new account, for rebate, and a further sum of 1,2261. to undivided profit. The directors believe that it will be satisfactory to indicate the course they intend to recommend for the adoption of the proprietors with reference to future dividends, which is to limit the dividend and bonus to 20 per cent per annum as a maximum, to be paid wherever the profits of the year will justify it, after making due provsion for the reserved fund, and to car all surpltts above the diviend declared to the credit of that fond untU it shall amount to 250,000l., when the direotors iXll submit a proposal for capitai ag a portion of it, by makmng an addition to enoh share.

After thee modern faBhion, he will only use it as a vehicle for the most reckless contradictions, couched in language such as happily belongs to no fashion modern or ancient, ever set by any one capable of the smallest selfrestramint. On Tuesday the Times gave a summary of the case of the preference shareholders of the Great Northern Railway, as it Was " understood," and mentioned also that it had beep hoped, if a wrong view had been taken of it, that the Conumittee of the House of Lords would at least in giving an adverse decision have pointed out where the error lay. This rdsumd llr. Denison in a frenzy of passionate excitement, has denounced o 11 v. acrios ofthe =Qigagr?su uaemess-ne ever saw"-" gross and deliberate falsehoods"-" misstatements beyond the excuse of ignorance," and untruths which "'the writer very well knew to be such." Mr. Denison evidently believes there are stronger weapons than argument, and he is perfectly right, since in any sphere above the lowest the moment a question ia to be tested by the outpouring of a vocabulary of abuse there is no choice but to retire. ButMr. Denison has not been wise enough to keep to his peculiar forte. His letter is not confined to abuse. It contains a long strirng of positive as.sertions, accompanied by observations which but for his refusal to have them so styled might be taken for arguments. These must be exposed, and then Mr. Denison must bo left to exercise his infirmities upon his, railway constituents or, if he deem it expedient, upon any one who may venture to rub against him in the House of Commons. He commences with the assertion that the non-prevention and nondiscovery of the frauds of Redpath cam in no way be attributed to mismanagement or neglect on the part of the directors. It was all the fault of Ir. W. H. Clark, the head registrar. Mr. Clark has already answered that accusation, and there is no need to re-discuss it. If Mlr. Clark was wrong in not looking after Mr. Redpath, Mr. Denison was w-rong in not looking after Mr. Clark. In a chain of this sort we cannot commit the meanness of stopping at aubordinates. Moreover, Mr. ]Denison was perfectly conversant -with Redpath's habits and modes of expenditure, the Board knowing at the time they appointed him thab he had been " a successful speculator." Mr. Denison next affirms that the statement that the preference shareholdersshould have so much dividend " per annum" is false. On this point the best answer will be furnished by the following extract of a letter from Mr. Haggard, a preference shareholder, who attended the meeting on Wednesday*. "The chairman (Mr. Denison), upon beingasked whether the Act creatingthepreference stocks does not declare that tho rate of interest saall be at the rate of so much per contum per annum, replied he did not know. Mr. Scott, a proprietor, then read a clause from their Act, stating that the 4A preference stock was to receive so much per centumn per annum '" Considering that Mr. Denison, although chairman of the company, was thus wholly ignorant up to Wednesday last, and that he was then enlightened in the manner described, his present unhesitating contradiction is the more remarkable. His next assertion is that it is untrue that the directors declared they could not support any Bill that could tbrow upon the preference shareholders any portion of the loss, yet in the succeeding line he admits that the directors said " they could not take upoa themselves to support any such Bill." In the blind conigestion of anger he seems to contradict and affirm without being conscious of what he is doing. Next, he says, " it is not true that the directors suppressed the recommendation of Lord Redesdale, that, as a penalty for their neglect, the directors sbould take the burden of the loss upon themselves, or that Lord RedeBdale ever expressed any such opinion." If Mr. Denison will refer to the report of the meeting last Wednesday he will find the following:- "Tl;e chairman (Mr. Denison) read the follow ing remarks of loRd Redsdale :-' There has been gross neglect in the management (cheers), or so great a fraud could not have been carried on during a period of three or four years without detection; and it would appear reasonable that the whole dividends upon the amont of stock held by every director necessary to qualify him for such office should be altogether sop ended, and appropriated to the payment$ required to repaoce the spurious capital duing such time as may be alowed by Parliament -for such settlement.' The cheirman, in reply to questions, acknoledged thaat he had these OtrwionsS of Lord .Resdaie's at the Ket meeing." The next denial of this gentleman is that it is untrue that many of the parties destined to be muleted seemed until the eleventh hour to have no consciousness of what was intended, but on that point Mr. Denison must really allow the parties in question to be the best judges of their own consciousness. Finally he says,- " The statemnent that the proxies obtained by the di,rectors when they professed an intention to act justly by the preference shareholders were used to carry the day against hem I pronouncoe to be a gross and deliberate falseb.oZd.' Here he would have been less open to rebLeke than in his other asseverations but for the ever- prompt accusation of deliberate misrepresentatijn. Comnmon sagaoity might have taught 0iimn e,ven in the total absence of that feeling which causes. men of wellregulated mnulds to avoid sueh assurnp'ions, that no deliberate misrepresentation vwas Ple'y to be made on a point -which could be instWAIlT corrected by a reference to printed reports. It .appears that he did not aotually use the, proxies, the notorious fadt of his haling them in his pocket, and of which he hknsel'j subsequently boasted, having, wccordiug ! a 9 .e st,te w .em ts of his oppo- nents, rendered any use of them nnnecessary by preventing a poll from being demanded. Mr. Denison's letter has now been gone through pu;ragraph by paragraph, and it may be asked whether a more painful specimen of intemperance could have been exhibited. The most severe charges in the remarks of 2'1e Yinzes related to his taunts against hIs own constituents, his fabrications regarding their objects, and his insinuation that Lord St. Leonard's and Lord Wensleydale had been stimulated by sordid motives. Respecting these he makes neither allusion nor apology. Henceforth he may hope to pursue his way secure from notice. There are persons to wrhom every one gives the wall, even if they are not entitled to it. Mr. Denison is of that order, and he shall enjoy all its privileges.
EXEOUT012SHrPS. TO THE EDITOB OF TUEI ThIESn Sir,-Now that the whole subject of pro bate and executorships is being overhauled by akrlamerant it may not be amiss for mue to menstion one poinat which has in a considerable degree been overlooked. There is no preoise time within which the Ecclesiastical Courts will cite an executor to prove a will; but the Stamp Act (55th George III., cap. 184, sec. 37) requires it to be done within six months fronm the testator's death, if ths property be taken possession of and administered, but not otberwise. The penalty for neglect Is 1001. Now, Sir, let me give vou a case which has recently come under my own observation. The person named in tho will accepts the executership hut, being ill-advised, he says to te testator's family (2alof them of age), " I shall not at present receive' any portion of deceased's personal property. Of course then I cannot ay yoV u any, though I am very sorry rou stand ian aeed of it. I am only following Ought this to be so, Sir? Are the testator's family to be compelled to beg the loan of their daily bread from Dodson and Fogg, becauso the executor chooses to patronize those legal harpies? Are the family, if they will not borrow, to be kept in a state of penniless beggary, or to intrade on friends for months and months and get from them their board aud lGdging? Is the youngest aon, who is of age however, to forego the profesuson of his choice because the executor will not pay hiim out of the personalty the wherewith to pursue his studies? The executor can do all this and does do it under the eanction of the letter of the Stamp Act. The 37th section of it virtually says, " If you will let the personal property runnto ruin; if you will receive no rents, debts, or dividenas; if you will pay nothing out of it, but let the family starve for all you care, then you are exemapt from all pains atnd penalties; you may xejoico in your own mhief and in Other'S miserY." lwo nyu w icifadi Surely, Sir, the lw on this point needs amendment. Executors must not only be allowed, bat compelled to do fnmlly from stavig by dilidnigng t8hae perona,lty, ife yhouoy get probate before six months from the death." Instead of being perrissive, let the language be compulsory-" You shaltlkeep the family by dividing the personalty; you shall ML A. July 14. 1 am, Sir, youzs, &c.
TEE RELIEF OF IlYIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THlE TIMES. Sir,-I would venture to suggest the following plan to assist the East India Company in the present state of affairs in India : I would grant the Company leave to organize 12 regiments of infantry and four battalions of artillery at once-that is. six European regiments for Calcatta, with two battalions of artillery, three regiments and one battalion of artillery for Madras, and the same for Bombay. Iwould permit militia to volunteer with arms, clothing &c., complete, seleoting only men who had been four to six ~_h --- r ---dA -_ - - -- A'. A &3- -T the coast easy for embaTcation of troops, and order to such depdts all the Company's officers now in Eingland (who may, from causes connected with climate only, be unable to leave England) to help to organize these men, I wonld offer a good bounty, and make the men wlho had been sergeants in embodied militia sergeants in the*e regiments as far as-posrible, I would give some commissions in these regiments to militia officers, and some to the officers of'the regular service on half-pay. I would send a few adjutants of militia, with their staff, to the depots selected, to receive and get together the volunteers at first (selecting adiutants from regirnents, of course, near at hand to' your dep6t), until the Company's officers could join. I would have all the militia volunteers clothed, armed, and completed to their kits, at the head-quarters of their militia regiment, as this would save much time and trouble at the several dep6ts; it would most likely assist to prevent desertion also. As militia clothing is nearly all the same, the change of facings and buttons could be rade on the passage out by commanding officers. If you did this I believe yon could send out artillery at once (or as soon as you rould get ships) fit to man the guns in all tne forts at tao several Presidencies, and could soon organize your infantry, which, to prevent confusion, might be formed by regiments one at a time at each depot, and shipped as soon as complete, care being taken to organize the staff of another ready before one is shipped. I do not consider it necessary to go into minute detaiL The payment for militia arms, &o., could be moade to Her Majesty as might be considered best, and All the rest could be done with ease by militia adjutants with the present staff, the Company finding the officers ready to receive the men, and finding the money also. This plan, if carried out, would organize 2,400 men of artillery, in four battalions. consisting of 600 men each. Of infantry 12,00X, or 12 battalions of 1,000 men each. The proportion of men, to be furnished b militia regi gents would he only as follows, viz. :-For the 22 militia artillery regiments which bave been embodied 109 men For the 112 infantry regiments of militia that have been embodied 103 men each regiment.

SCRzW COL1;ERS AtND T'E COAL TRADX.-The passage down tho lower reaches of the Tyne on Monday of te olarge screw collier tho William Corey, on an expermental trip to sea, attracted general attention, and caused much Epeculation among seaaring men; for if the experiment succeeds of ranning such a large class of vessels in the coal trade at a profit, the prediction made in 17ee Tinus a few years ago that in a very short period of time sailing vessels would be superseded in the London coal trade by iron screw steamers will be a matter of certainty, as the William Corey bears the samo relation to the present class of screw colhers as they do to collier brigs. The William Corey is the pioneer of a 'deet of laage screw colliers intended to rin between Cardiff and London, to supply the market with Welsh steaxn coaL She is owned by Mr. Hugh Taylor, of Backworth; Mr. William Corey, of London; *r. John Nixon, of Cardiff; and other gontlemen well known on the Coal-Excbange. It is but a few years sinco the first steam collier was launched, and the average cargo carried by these vesse]s does not exceed 6'0 tons, with engines of about 60 horse-power. The William Coreyis intended to carry a cargo of 1,500 tons, exclusive of 150 tons of fuel, and she has engines of 120-horse powor. The iron hull of this vessel is so constructed that 400 tons of water can be admitted into her bottom to act as ballast, a large and efficient steam pump being also provided to discharge this water within three hours, thus avoiding any detention in port to discharge ballast. She is of immense streegth, which may be inferred from the fact that when she is laden she wvll weigh 3,000 tons; and it is estimated that she will deliver into the port of London during one year the enormous qnantity of 50,000 tons of Welsh coaL Hydrauli machinery has been erected in the Victoria Docks for the entice discharge of her cargo in 16 hours. The chairman of the coal trade of Northumberland and Durham, 'with a large party connected with raining in the north, was on board during the experimental trip on Monday, which was to the Coquet and back to Shields bar. At lamcheon some interesting statements were made with regard to this class of vessels. Mr. Taylor said that he and his partners had built this vessel with no view to run down sailing vessels, but to maintain the competition with railways. is the London market; and he had little doubt that in a short time, if the experiment succeeded, he and his partners would give the builders, Messrs. Mitchell and Co., of Low Walker, an order for a vessel double the sos ;jor he had no hesitation in saying, that in four or five years' time steamvessels carrying from 3,000 to 5,00 tons of coals wouldbe employed in the coal trade; for, as they saw, the William. C¢ory was worked -with as few hands as a vessel of much lows3 tonnage. We learnt on board that the owners anticipate to sail the vessel at about 3s. 6d. per ton, and that a vessel twice her size could be sailed at 2s. per ton, of this.the owners are perfectly satisfied. She bas 23 hands ou board, and has been bult and finished for sea at a cost of something like 23,N03. She is an exceedingly handsome-looking vessel, close and compact, as iron vessels generally are. She Is of great length, longer than the Dake of Welington; and with a stiff breeze on the beam made someth'ng more than eight knots an hour on her trial trip.

I GBEAT NORTHERN RAILWAY. TO TERE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In T'c 2"mes of Wednesday -we obeervealetterfrm Mr. Edmund Denison, M.P., Chairman of tho Great Northern Railway Company, in which he complains of a series on grossn misrepresentations in your city article of the 14th inst. WVe arO not aware whether you derived any of the facts upon which that article Is founded from the Committee of Preference Shareholders, butwe are bound to etate that the facts there stated are substantially correct. We WMll go through Mr. Denison's letter. L He complains that Redpath's frauds should still be attributed to the neglect of the directors, and obeerves that the only person on whose neglect the committee of eitber Houee of Parliament made any remark was Mr. W. H. Clark, the late registrar. Nevertheless, the conduct of the directors In appointing Mr. Clark, whom-as he himself, in his letter of the 3d of March, published in the report of the 4th of March last, says they knew to be utterly incom. oteint, wbile they also knew that Redpath at a smal salary porformed the business-does, we think, look rather like mis. enanagement and neglect of the directors. 2. Mr. Denison denies that there is Any stipulation ia Jliy Ace of the company that any of the preference share. holders should have so much dividend "per annum." Now, by the Great Northern Railway Acts Amendment Act, 1849, sec. 26, it is enacted that it ahall be law!tl for ths company, with the assent of three-fifths of the votes at any general meeting, to guarantee "the payment of dividendsnot exoeeding in any aee 7 per cent, per annum, on any particular shares which the company may, by any of the before recited Acts, be authorizod to issue in preference to the payment thereof on ordinary shares of the company." By the Great Northern Railvay Act (No. 1). 1851, sec. 5, it is e.ncted that thoecompany may "guaranteethe payment of dividends not exceeding in any case 7 per cent. pet annum" ou the shares which the company were thereby authorized to issue. By the Great Northern Railway (eommnnicationwithllanchester, Sheffield, andIinoh1shl Railway)Act, 1851, sea. 12, the.corpany are authorized 'to grantee the payment of dividends not exceeding irx !ay case 7 per cent. per annuM" on the shares Which the company were thereby authorized to issue " in prefer. ence to the payment of dividends on the ordinay shares ot the companr,"&c. Several of the classes of preference ehares have been created respetively c nde the authorityof these Aicts of Parliamenrt. -n the Great Northern Railwary Act, 1855, sem. 4, the holders-of shares thereby created are to be entitled to the paymenlt of fixed dividends "at the rate of 5 per cent. Per annum, in preference to the payment of dividend on the ordinary shares of the company." With regard to the alleged opinion of the A ttorney-gene. ral, that no claim by preference shareholders to dividend per annum can be maintained, we doubt if that learned gentlemrs eattention was ever directed to the distinction between a year's dividend and half a year's dividend as regards the preference shareholders' rights. 3. Mr. Denison says, it is not true that the directors de. clared "they could not support any Bill that would throw upon the preference stock anY portion of the loss; and sayS that itis truethat they said they "could not take upon themselves" to do it. Where is the substantial differenca of the phrases? 4. Mr. Denison says, it is not true that the directors sup. pressed " tho reoommendation of Lord Redesdate, that as a penalty for their neglect the directors should talce the burden of the loss upon themselves ;" and that Lord Rledes. dale ezpressed no such opinion. Lord Redeedale's remarks were:- "There has been gross neglect in the management. . " It wo-.ld appear reasonable that the whole dividends on the amoant of stock held by every director as nece.sary to qualify hira for such oflice should be altogether suspended, and appropriated to the payments required to replace the spurious capital during such time As may be allowed by Parliament for such settlement.y At the meeting of shareholders on the sth inst. zir. Denison admitted that the directors had that statement at the meeting of the 12th of March, and that they did nm snake it known. This was suppression on their part, sad Lord Redesdale's opinion looks very like that stated in your city article; perhaps, not quite so severe, 5. Mr. Denison says that,- "So far from its being true that many of. the parties destined to be anulcted seemed until the eleventh hour to have no conscioasness of what was intended, that a report of the proceedings on the 12th of March hgd been in the hands of every shareholder for four months," a Nowr, the only resolutininth t etat_ P directors seek.to justify the Bill they introduced into Par14menthnfis sessionx g-that no divndendbe declared; that loeses-causedhy Redpath's frauds; and that the directors were authorzed so to apply such balance and to take umch pro. ceedings In Parliament as they might deem most con. ducive to the interest of the company. Istherea syllall3 in this resolution to lead the preferene sharehehiem to suspoct that tkey were to be restricted in respect of thelr preference interest or dividend to the revenuo of the on s half-year ending the 3lst of December last? As soon as the sinister nature of the Bil (going, in this respect, far beyond the resolution of the 12th of March) was discovered, of course the preference sbareholders began to bestir them. eclves, as well they might. 6. With regard to Mr. Denison's complaint of being im. properly charged with using the proxies of preference shareholders against their interest, it is, no doubt, quite true, as he says, that no poll was come to on the 12th of Mrch, and consequently the proxies were not actuslly used. We leave Mr. Denisor to justify himself in obtain. ing such proxies after putting forth the assurance in tha 44thp aragraph of the Report of the 4th of Match, and then, without any notice to the preference shareholders who gave those proxies, or any opportunity afforded them to bestow them elsewhere, wbeeling about and supporting a Bill detrimental to their interest, in direct contravention of that assurance. 7. As to Mr:. Denison's boast of a large excess of votes at the last meeting, Towe remind him and your readsrs that the shareholders present who supported the amendment were 110, while those present who suppor5ed- the Bill as framed' Were only 105. It remains to be seen how long Mr. Denison. wil continue tSa be intrusted with the, proxies of a msajority in number and value of sharoholders whose votes are re. corded at meetings of the company. In conclusimn, we cannot help. observing that- the contest is reduced to the question. whether the prefe. rence sharehalders are to be arbitrarily restrictedby this Bil totone half-years revenue, or, it nob declared by Ais Bill to. be entitled to look to a year's revenue, at least left in possassion of their existinX rights upon the subject. I-his evidence before the committee of the Zouse of Lords on Friday lst Mr. Denisonx appears,by the shorthand writer's notes,to have saidl that hestated at the meeting of the 12th of- arch "-tlbis-deterniina. tion of LordRIdesdale-vin., that the lossesahould bepaid out of the earnings-of the half- .ear, %nd&that he would :otlet thn losses be capitalised." A.few lines lower dovm in the same page Mr. Derison says,-"I have-never said tbat he (Lord Redeodale) sa;d that the losses wore to be paid cut of thei half-year's revesnu. Whbat he sead wase uhis,, that it shalt not be capitaized, but it- shall be paid oat of oarnings ot the company.,' What Mr. Denison row meanathat ho,said on. this point at the mceting of the 12th of Mr-tch is beyond cur compre. hension. Allvwo know is that 'he B,il. now promoted ia a'arliament by him anithe diroetors proposes, although in vew covert language, to restrict the proferenceshareholdera to a single hall-year, although it impliodly adamits.that they are at present entitledto lookto-a whole llb Tis injurious and nafair proulaion the preference shareholders will continue o oppose- by every legitate moans in their power.

IRISH LAND SALES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In The Times of Thursday your Dublin correspondent cal attention to the profit realizedby theland speculations of the Messrs. Sadleir in the Encumbered Etates Court of that city, "as a striking proof of the sur- sing increas nwithin a few brief years of the valuo of lan'd iu Lrelaud." And he quotes three lots, of which the first, bought in 1852 for 8,500, fetched on Tuesday 13,0001. - the second, bought in 1854 for 5,3001., brought 12,0001. ; and the third, purchased in 1855 for 8101., was sold for 1,4001. I fear that these cases must suggestgraver, and loss agreeable reflections than any that spring from the change of prices in the land-market of Ireland. Iho proceedings and praotices in the Encumbored Estates Court were strongly commented upon in the House of Lords in 1854, and the operations of the Sadleirs were then alluded to. I trust these pregnant instances of at least the past working of this court my be remembered by our legislators in the next session of Parliament, when the continuance and constitution of the court .nust be considered. Your correspondent cannot mean to state that the value of land in Ireland generaUy has more than doubled since 1854, or that it has increased since 1855 in tho ratio of 8 to 14.

SUITORS IN PARILIAMREhT. TO THE EDITOR O1P THE TIMES. Sir,-This is professedly an age of improvement, and, notwithstanding that fact, those persons who are engaged in sohlcti'g and obtaining the sanction of Parliament to private Bis are subjected to the greatest possible annoyance in the highest court in thisrealm.Probably, Sir, you will ba so good as to publish the following statement of facts, in order that thosewhose duty itistomakebetterarrangements may know the grievances wo suffer, but can no longer endure:- Yesterday (Tuesday| 31 BiDls were set down In the list of Bills to betaken by the Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords, and the parties interested in the progress of ihe Bills were requested to attend the committee at 12.45. The parties who could attend at that hour did so (and fortunately). The Houso, however, was sitting as a Committee of Privileges, and during the very short adJourn-ent of the House the noble lord (Redesdale), the .hairman of committees, left the House, did all that in his power lay, and disposed of several cases, and then the House resumedits sitting. Now comes the ground of complaint. The several parties concerned professionally for the 31 Bils, Parliamentary agents and their clerks, solicitors and their clerks, engineers and their assistants, and witnesses pro. bably to the number of 90 persons in all, had to remain,with the exception aforesaid (until the rising of the Committee of Privileges at 4 o'clock), in a small space leading to the Strangers' gallery and to the room formerly known as the Reporters'room--a place so utterly unfit for the purpose that they were crowded and hustled together like so -nany sheep in a railway truck, without a seat and in an atmosphere most oppressive to bear ; the messenger in attendance threatening the parties with the police unless they made more room for the peers, which, without taking down the walls. they would have had a difficulty in doing. At 4 o'clock the Committee of Privileges adjourned, and then the chainan of committees and several noble lords proceeded with a case opposed on Standing Orders, leaving the unopposed cases to follow (a very proper arrangemnent, no doubt); but from 1 o'clook until nearly 7 the persons in attendance, and Mayig heavy House fees, had not the most remote chance or obtaining a seat, except on the stone stairs leading to the Reporters' and Strangers'gali leries. Is this as it should be ? Ought persons to be compelled to wait like beggars anXiOus to rcceive the crnubs that fall from the rich man's table? Surely, if from unavoidable cauees suitors in Parliament musA wait until their case is called on, they should in that large ile have alotted to theni some place better than the Black Hole at Calcutta, and at least a seat and a cup of cold water in the dog ,days. Hoping, Sir, that you will bo so good as to insert this letter, and by that means draw the attention of the officials ht.t,hn and I remain. voursobedientlv. A SUFFERER FROM EXHAUSTION.

...wV.Y, THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1857. The House of Commons yesterday having again resolved itself into Committee to consider the details of the Judgments Execution, &c., Bill, the opposition to the measure continuing, and even increasing in strength, Mr. CRAJUFURD, who introduced the Bill, consented to a motion that the Chairman should leave the chair, so that the BiU is virtually withdrawn. On the order, moved by Sir E. PERRY, for the second reading of the Married Women Bill, Sir J. Y. BuLLEu, in the absence of Mr. MALNs, moved to defer the second reading for six months, urging, among other objections to the Bil, that it would introduce into families a great deal of dis. comfort and dissension. Mr. Miu.Es, whose name was on the back of the Bill, argued in support of it upon social grounds, affecting not the higher classes but the mass of the community. Mr. MAssEY said that, understanding from Sir E. PERRY that the ATTosN-Ez-G ERAL approved the principle of the Bil, he could not consent to vote for the amendment. The question-a very large and important one-well deserved the attention of the House, and was not to be summarily disposed of. The Bill, however, stood in very great need of revision in the committee, and he pointed out some of the details which were, in his opinion, most objectionable, suggesting that it would be better to refer the Bill to a Select Committee. After some remarks by Mr. HinADsILD, Mr. SPooix, and Mr. BAoWELL, Sir E. PERiy replied to objections, and agreed to Mr. MAssEY's suggestion that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. Mr. MixEs recommended that legislation upon this subject should be deferred until the next session. Mr. J. D. FITzGERALD consented to the second reading of the Bil, considering that the law required alteration, but he consented under protest, believing it to be a most rashly constructed measure, that would lead to considerable evil and great confusion. It was an attempt not to amend the law, but to revolutionize it. Mr. RoEBIC} having spoken briefly in favour of the Bill, and Mr. DE YERR against it, upon a divi. vision the amendment was negatived by 120 to 65. The Bill was read a second time. The House then went into committee upon the Scientific and Literary Societies Bill, the early clauses of which underwent alterations so important that at length Mr. HurT, who had charge of the Bill, moved that the Chairman leave the chair. On the motion of Mr. HEADLAhr the order for the second reading of the Medical Profession (No. 1) Bill was discharged. The report of the Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to. The other orders were gone through without discussion, and after some other business the B1ouse adjourned at 6 o'clock.
In forming an opinion on the Maritime Convention of Paris Lord JOHY RUSSELL cannot be accused of the precipitation which he imputed to Lord CLARENDoN on Taesday night. The state of *international law may possibly be alarming, but there is certainly no recent or sudden cause for alarm. A year and three months have elapsed since the time at which the maritime supremacy of England is alleged to have been hastily sacrificed. It is true that, owing to the pressure of diplomatic necessities, the arraugement was effected without previous reference to Parliament or to the country, but the seeming irregularity has been condoned by general acquiescence in the new code of Maritime Law. It is some consolation, too, that Lord CrmsNooN did not sell the predominance of his country for nothing. The old rule that an enemy's goods may be followed in a neutral bottom was undeniably sanctioned by usage, and in no way inconsistent with reason. As Lord JOHN RUSSELL justly observes, tho ownler of property on the sea has no right to expect the immunities which are some- times conceded to farming stock or furniture. It may be added that the exemption of moveables from the risks of warfare on land has been found highly precarious and uncertain; but, in truth, the tradition of civilized nations is the only foundation of the laws of war, International jurisprudence in this respect consists of a few definite limitations imposed on the license of a condition in which all compacts and relations are for the time suspended. An enemy's goods may be seized at sea, because the great Maritime IPowers have never yet pledged themselves to abstain from availing themselves of the privileges arising from superior force. Within the last century several combinations of the minor States have been formed for the express purpose of extorting the surrender of the English claim against neutrals. In every instance the attempt has been wholly unsuccessful. The Armed Neutrality of 1780, the Northern Confederation of 1801, and the Allied Powers of 1814 were in turn compelled to acquiesce in the maintenance of the ancient law. The present Government had the fullest right to abide by the pretensions of former times, but it was their duty to inquire whether tnis glorious inheritance had not become by a change of circumstances a damnosa hluremditas, aburdensome property, which it might be desirable to abandon, and highly advantageous to dispose of for an adequate consideration. In the days of Navigation Laws and of protective duties it was consistent with the established policy of the country to discountenance neutral commerce. Free Trade, on the other hand, welcomes buyers and sellers from every climate, and acquiesces, but unwillingly, in the necessity of refusing the profitable visits of the enemy. Russian goods were in the height of the war entitled to free circulation by land; and if the blockades had allowed similar facilities by sea the advantage would have been almost equally divided I between the belligerents. Lord CLA&uE2NDN may, perhaps, also have taken into consideration the inconvenience of a right which can only be maintained by force. The old Maritime Law involved the probability of a quarrel with America during a French war, with France during an American war, and with both in the event of a conflict with Russia. A knight errant might hesitate to throw away a favour which was challenged by every passer-by, but he would scarcely be sorry at last of an honourable excuse for laying it aside. The sacrifice on the part of the secondary maritime Powers of the right of issuing letters of marque furnished more than an equivalent for the concession that free ships make free goods. When a rich man and a poor man agree to respect each other's property it is easy to see that the advantage rests with the capitalist. The trade of England, perhaps, exceeds tenfold that of France, and the same proportion determines the comparative benefit to be derived from the restriction of legal piracy. During the great war French commerce offered but a limited temptation to private adventurers, who were almost as obnoxious to the regular cruisers with whom they competed as to the merchantmen whom they plundered. The enemy, on lhe other hand, excluded from the markets of the East and of the West, devoted his maritime energies in a great measure to the employment of privateers. The narrow seas, and even the Straits of Dover, swarmed with corsairs, attracted by the innumerable vessels which sought the mouth of the Thames. The traveller with empty pockets may sing in the presence of the highwayman, but England cannot afford to become the victim of robbery in consideration of an acknowledged right to rob in turn. Of the four propositions of Paris two were nugatory, or already established by law. English j Lz, .. - ._,I.,J ~.jo (vUUw,aIth VA~ptUlvu Ur neutral goods under an enemy's flag; and the Government has, since the revocation of the famous Orders in Council, tacitly renounced the light of proclaiming paper blockades. The adrission that the flag covers the goods, even if it were in itself disadvantageous to England, would have been abundantly compensated by the agreement that privateering was to be abandoned in Europe. Mr. LINDSAY seems to have forgotten that the underwriters will be far more moderate in their demand for premiums when merchantmen are only exposed to capture by regular Government cruisers. The Power which has the largest trade and the strongest navy is, on both grounds, interested in abolishing the right of seizure by private interlopers. When the Convention of Paris was transmitted to Washington Mr. MARCY, with an amiable candour, declared his intention of considering it with a view to the interests of the United States in the contingency of a war with England. The Americans have as much to lose at sea as ourselves, but they have a coniparatively insignificant navy. It was therefore natural that they should wish to diminish captures; but they were likely to suffer a disadvantage by allowing ships of war a monopoly of plunder. The Secretary of State was perfectly justified in looking to the interests of his country, although he used an untenable argument when he assumed that private enterprise would make up for the deficient strength of the national marine. It is well known that privateers never fight, but it cannot be denied that in a war with England they might be a formidable weapon in the hands of the UJnited States. Mr. M. rCY offered to subscribe three out of the four articles of the European Ccnvention, but the parties to the Treaty of Paris had agreed to make the concession of any part conditional on the acceptance of the whole. As an alternative, he made a bold and comprehensive proposal. The American Government undertook to renounce the use of Letters of Marque on condition that the property of belligerents at sea should be wholly exempt from capture; and, if the offer was made in good faith, it is to be regretted t'hat E1ngland did not at once close with the suggestion. Lord PATZIERSTON intimated in his Manchester speech an inclination to acquiesce in the project, but it was necessary to consult the Powers which had signed the Treaty of Paris, and it was thought desirable to examine the various results which might arise from such a revolution in Maritime Law. Before a decision could be formed the Cabinet of Washington became alarmed at the possibility that its offer would be accepted. Mr. Bucvnuskx and General CAss have intimated their disinclination to follow up the discussion, nor is there any reason to hope that so desirable an object will soon become attainable. In the mean time the laws of war between England and America are wholly unaffected by the Convention of Paris. The maritime weapon which is really indispensable to England is the right of blockade. Mr. lincy's plan would have relieved traders from the necessity of procuring convoys, while it would have enabled the English fleets to close the principal ports of the enemy, and in this manner the maximum of efficiency in the navy would have been combined with the minimium1i of loss to commerce. The tidings of the proposed bargain were, as experience has since proved, much too good to be true. If, however, the Government has not obtained everything which might have been wished, it has done the country solid service in procuring the abolition of European privateering. The singular coterie which has employed itself for 20 years in collecting materials for the impeachment of Lord PALBiERsToN has repeatedly alarmed provincial patriots by the exposure of the gross treason practised at Paris. Lord JoifN RussxLL might have been expected to take a calmer view of the question; but his friendghip for the present Ministryis so jealous and sensitive that he sometimes imagines the errors which he deprecates with the characteristic susceptibility of affection.
On Tuesday night, as we yesterday reported, the House of Commons agreed, on the motion of Mr. C. BUXTON, to address the Cnoww on the subject of the African Slave Trade, and Lord BRouo(nr has given notice that he -will this evening move the House of Lords to the same purpose. The revival of this famous topic, after a year or two's comparative suspense, is due immediately, per. haps, to that capture of a slaver the details of which excited so much horror a few weeks ago; but the position of the question is such that the renewal of the controversy was an event which might at any moment be anticipated. It is perfectly true, as Mr. BUXTON remarked, that the exertions of this country, continued with unabating zeal throughout a whole generation, have reduced the Slave Trade to dimensions comparatively small. At no period, however, has it been entirely or everywhere extinguished. On the first removal or diversion of the pressure employed to stifle it the traffic resumes its wonted vigour, and it even exhibits, independently of these conditions, ¶uctuations of its own. At this very time, for example, although there has been no relaxation of vigilance on the part of our preventive squadron, the importation of Slaves into Cuba has actually increased twentyfold, according to Mr. BuxToiN's description, during the last two years. The number of these wretched beings landed in that colony 10 years ago was about 1,000, whereas in 1855 and 18f56 the supplies averaged 20,000. Of Brazil,.too, it is alleged that a coercive policy is still necessary to maintain the improvement established, so that all our efforts appear to terminate in a species of success which itself is partial, and the durability of which is measured by a continuance of the same exertions which achieved it. It is no wonder, therefore, that such a state of things should be regarded as unsatisfactory, or that projects of various kinds should be entertained for placing matters, if possible, on a better footing. Our maritime patrol is only maintained at a heavy cost, and, while our own colonies are gasping for want of labour, the Cuban planters still contrive to enrich themselves by contraband importations of these dreadful cargoes. Three principal suggestions have recently been laid before the public. One turns upon an earnest expostulation with the Spanish Government, which undoubtedly stands bound by treaty to extinguish this detestable trade in its own colonies as effectually as we have suppressed it in the British West Indies; the second reconimends an extension of the blockade from the African coast to the shores of Cuba; and the third involves the more decided and comprehensive policy of taking under our own superintendence those exportations of labour which we have never been able to stop. It is to the last of these that we are disposed to attribute the greatest weight and the greatest promise. Spain has hitherto eluded the instances of our diplomatists, however urgent, and Lord PALMERSTON explained in the course of the debate the impossibility, under existing circumstances, of adopting towards the Government of Madrid that course which had been taken with respect to BraziL As regards the efficiency of cruisers off the coast of Cuba, though the scheme has found considerable favour in some quarters, Mr. BUXTON expressed himself with very little confidence; so that, upon the whole, the prospects tv IJ voIAA-1 by Lbh v.nplV nnt of broo Nogro labour, if such a project could be safely accomplished, appear the most encouraging. We do not dissemble the difficulties which such an undertaking might involve, or overlook the apprehensions it would be likely to create. Beyond doubt, the exportation of Negroes from Africa, unless we could be assured of the bon&l fide character of the proceeding, might be equivalent, as far as Africa is concerned, to the revival of the Slave Trade under another designation. MIr. BUXTON admitted, candidly enough, the great advantage of the plan, if it could be unobjectionably executed, and thougrht that a proper system of emigration might be encouraged at those points of the coast where the authority of the British Government prevailed. The danger lies in exciting the cupidity of the chiefs of the interior by establishing a demand for an article in which they would unhesitatingly deal-the bodies of their subjects, or their neighbours. If it were once known that Negroes were in request for shipment to the West Indies, they would be brought down to the coast, after having been captured or coerced, without a will of their own, and, as far as regards this stage of the proceedings, the consequences would be as bad as if the vessel waiting to embark them were a genuine slaver. Traffic in human flesh would be revived, to the prejudice of the more legitimate and valuable industry which has lately arisen, and the results of which we discern in importations to the amount of 3,000,0001. per annum. Instead of producing palm-oil, the African chiefs would take to kidnapping and war, until the condition of the country would become as deplorable as it was a generation or two since. We acknowledge at once the reality of the risks thus depicted, and, if we still regard the scheme as promising, it is becauisein this matter there are risks in every direction, while in none are tlle advantages so attractive as here. Take the actual state of the case at this moment. A demand for Negroes on the coast of Africa not only exists but has always existed, more or less briskly, in spite of everything we could do to extinguish it. By taking this demand, therefore, into our own hands we should not be creating or fostering any passions previously unknown. If 20,000 Slaves a-year are landed alive in Cuba, at least 60,000 must be captured every Year in Africa, and, under actual circumstances, must be carried through all the horrors not only of the original foray, but of the barracoons, the middle passage, and the career of Slavery itself at last. By a system of free emigration these horrors would, at least, be terminated in every stage but one. Possibly the desire of the chiefs to sell men, and consequently to steal them, Might prove irrepressible, but at any rate the shocking miseries of the slave ship and all the infamous conditions of slave life would be escaped, and theNegro, once on board the emigrant-ship, would be secure or better treatment and greater freedom than he enjoyed at home. In the system itself there is certainly nothing undesirablc. The lot of a Negro on his native soil is not for the most part so fortunate that we need repine at his exchanging it for a good service with good wages and good opportunities of self-elevation. Nobody could deny that the position of the Coolies at the Alauritius, as described the other day by MIr. LAOtcnzuzER, is infinitely superior to the position of the Negro on his own shores as described by his own advocate, Air. M. FoRSTBn. Allthe difficulty is comprised in one point-the production of the Negro at the place of embarcation. If he could be forthcoming there of his own free will there would be an end of the controversy; it is because he would be probably driven to the coast for virtual sale that the scheme is disapproved. But is this difficulty really insurmountable 1 Recollect how many perplexities wonid be escaped by the solution of this single problem. It is reasonable to xuppose that by these means the Slave Trade itself would be at last utterly extinguished, for who would give 3001.-the present price-for an emaciated captive, when he could procure the passage of a free labourer of the same race for 71. lOs. ? Free labour, moreover, will beat slave labour out of tho field by open competition, as has, been actually proved in the Miauritius. Then, again, look at our unfortunate colonies. We do not quarrel with the interest expresmed by Lord PAL£mBToN and Mr. Buxiox in the lawful commerce of Africa, but we confess to some regard also for the trade of our own West Indies -for a trade which, if labour were only procurable, would stock our markets to overflowing with cotton, sugar, and every other product of tropical industry. No doubt the development of Africa may be fraught with marvellous consequences, but it mustr at least be distant, whereas in our own settlement3 there is no such development to be waite& for. Everything but labour is there already-British territory, British capital, British skil. Why should such soil be unproductive when it could be brought under most remunerative cultivation by the agency of men who, through this very employment, might better their own condition and contribute to the civilization of their hitherto degraded race? If the question involves its difficulties we think we may fairly say that it promises inca6culable results.
It is due to the wishes of the people, to the proper influence of the Commons, to the credit of the country that something should be done in the question of Jewish Disabilities.. Ten years have now elapsed since a Jew was frst elected. to Parliament, and, in spite of numerous decisions of the Lower House. in spite of three or four re-elections by the constituency, in spite of the general voice of the public and the agreement of every man worthy of the name of a statesman, the intolerant exclusion is still maintained. Nothing can be further from our intention than to enter once more into this interminable discussion. Itis necessarily our lot to have to repeat the same things over and over again on a great many subjects, for any politician or writer who is too studious of novelty and contemns the drudgery of precept upon precept, line upon line, can hope to produce little effect. But with the hackneyed objections about unchristianizing the Legislature and hindering the fulfilment of prophecy we must decline having any more to do. The facts are plain and simple. The spirit of modern society, and consequently of modern legislation, is against the exclusion of any man on account of his religion. The Jews, who are Englishinen like their neighbours, are prevented from sitting in the House of Commons by a form of words which means little, attached to an oath which means nothing. Succeeding Ministries have endeavoured by everyconcession and by every courtesy to conquer the obstinacy of the House of Lords. Lord JonN RUsELL proposed the omission of the words " on " the true faith of a Christian," and in this he was supported by the late Sir R. PEEL, by Lord G. BENTmc, and several of the chief men of the Conservative party. Subsequent years have witnessed the introduction of a variety of measures for the attainment of this same object under different forms. The Upper lIouse has been humoured and deferred to in every way, and yet the result is the same; each successive BiU has been rejected, and the question is now as far from settlement as ever. That it must be settled is evident. Accordd ing to the actual state of things Baron RoTrSCaTD is legaUy elected, inasmuch as he is not an alien, or a minor. or a clergyman, and yet he cannot take his seat. As long as a constituency chooses to return a Jew, the disetssion which has now been prolonged during a considerable period of human life must continue. Now, the opponents of Jewish Emancipation wni not bring the matter to an issue by moving that the recusant member be compeled to swear or resign his seat; they wilU use no means to carry the arguments of their party to their legitimate conclusion. Having rejected the settlement proposed by the M1inistry, by the mass of the nation, by the best men of the Conservative party, they have not the courage to come forward with any proposition of their own. If the House of Commons acquiesce in the judgment of the Lords, as Sir FREDERIcO THEsiGER and his friends would have them, it will merely amount to this, that any Jews who may in future be elected-whether one, or two, or ten, or twenty-will be excluded from sitting, but yet remain undisturbed in their honorary rank as members. This is the effect of the Tory vote, and no one of the number seeks to explain or modify it by bringing in a Bill or moving a resolution in the sense of his own opinions. Thus is the Eouse of Commons played with by a set of its own members; thus is its dignity compromised by the cavalier obstinacy of the Lords; thus is the national representation left incomplete and its laws undecided. We cannot wonder, then, that there should! exist a general wish for the House to take this matter into its own hands. The words " on " the true faith of a Christian" were evidently introduced into the Oath to add solemnity, to bind more strictly the conscience. It is impossible for ingenuity to devise any other reason for their use. Therefore, if the Oath is to be taken by any one to whom the words are not especially solemn, and whose conscience does not require them for the enforcement of the obligation, com. mon sense must demand that they be omitted. It is against the plainest deductions of reason that these words should form part of the substance of the Oath. The Oath is to the effect that the swearer abjures the STUARTS ; now, if the clause concerning the true faith of a Christian be an essential part of the Oath, it follows that no one who is not a Christian can, by the law of England, abjure the STUARTS; which is absurd. Therefore, although the House of Conunons in its deference.-its too great deference-to the Upper House has abstained from altering the usual form of Oath by its own authority, there is, we think, no reason why it should not now take the matter into consideration, and, consistently with the spirit of recent legislation, and, we believe, with the actual state of the law, admit the Jewish member for London by a resolution that he be allowed to take the Oath in the form most binding on his conscience. The question whether the words " on the true "faith of a Christian"' may be omitted is a point of law. By whom is it then to be settled I Evidently by the House of Commons itself. The House must, we think, be held to be the only judge of its own . forms ; and if it come to the conclusion that the Oath of Abjuration may be taken by a Jew, no other authority can gainsay it. WVe are glad to hear that this question is liikely to be subn;itted speedily to the House. It wil then remain for the Commons to take -what steps *they think proper for the maintecnance of their own privileges. They have an example in the occurrences of last year, when the Lords refused permission to a Peer for life to take his seat in their Chamber. Here, indeed, w'as an instance of a House of Parliament asserting its owa illdependence, as in the most memorable days of constitutional feud. A riglht which had always been considered as belonging to the CROwN was questioned, and thou&l 'ltina4tely it was not total
The danger of the crisis in the North-Western Provinces of India seems at length to be appreciated by the QUEaN'S Government. It Uas been resolved to act with vigour, and that re-solution will no doubt be fortified by the intelligence 'which for some time to come we shall receive by ,each successive mail. We would communicate in a few words the general nature of the precautions already taken. A steam squadron is to be vsent to India. As the exigencies of the service dhave already absorbed the number of seamen actually voted, it is intended to apply to Parlia,ment for an additional vote of 2,000 seamen, *-a application which will, no doubt, at once -receive the sanction of the Legislature. We -should gladly hear that this squadron, or a *portion of it, was to be used for the conveyance of troops. The advantage of a steam *squadron in the Indian Seas is, of course, undeniable, but it must not be forgotten that the ,presence of one European Regiment in Upper India -would outweigh that of a steam-frigate in the EBay of Bengal. The primary value of these steamehips for this emergency is as transports. 'They -cannot bring their guns to bear upoIl the mutimeers, who will most assuredly not select the sea-coast as the scene of their operations. One fact, how*ever, wVe may speak of with certainty. A con siderable force of artiUery is to be despatched by the nost rapid conveyance at hand; and in this arm, as it appears from the reports forwarded home, -the Bengal establishment is, unfortunately, defi-cient. With regard to the regiments actually ordered to the scene of hostilities-independently of the -regiments which have been moved from the other .presidencies and from the Persian Gulf upon the -disturbed districts-the force which had been -appropriated to the Chinese operations has been intercepted at Point de Galle by summons from Lord CAwNiNo, and this measure has «received the-&entire approval and confirmation of the authorities at home. In order to fill up the -vacuum in the China service caused by the withdrawal of these troops, it is proposed to despatch a battalion of Marines to Rongkong with the least possible delay. This is precisely the class of force best adapted to the conduct of operations in that quarter. The service required is essentially one of an amphibious character, to be best performed by a force which can act either ,by land or by water, as occasion may require. It is an affair of rivers and creeks, and of an extended seaboaxd-precisely, in fact, the service for whicl the Marines are especiaUy adapted by their peculiar training. Eere again is another example of the great value of this most admirable corps, 'which will, no doubt, rise every day higher in public estimation as the conditions of modern -warfare are better known and appreciatel. It is most fortunate that, as this Indian diffi-culty has fallen upon us in so unexpected a -mainer, affairs in China should be going on so v.ell. By the advices just received it appears -that the Cantonese are so hampered for want of provisions that a mere blockade of their river -would be sufficient to bring them to terms. It -would be needless to add that the affair will receive -a very different solution-sharp, forcible, and -decisive, but yet not such a one as will .entail the necessity of any very extraordinary exertions on the part of this country. The Persian -war is at an end. Matters seem quiet at the Cape, and it is of the highest importance that they should remain so. The Cape colony now contains about 10,000 troops, whereof certainly 5,000 should Jbe available for Indian service. These are not raw recruits, but veteran soldiers, inured to a hot climate and the exigencies of a campaign. If 'this force could be transported at once to Calcutta it would add enormously to the strength of the Government. So far, we could not have commenced the task of the re*conquest of Upper India under better auspices. :Let there not exist any self-deception as to the real nature of the contest upon which -we have just entered. The result is certain success if we do wut use the means at our disposal- with judgmnent and energy, but it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of the crisis. So much of India remains still British India as is under the control or the awe of British troops, but not a square league more. Let us at least act upon this conviction as the surest earnest of a speedy success. For a long time past it has been wliispered among men wvho had experience of Indian affairs that sooner or later India would revolt from our rule, -and, perhaps, be lost to us for ever. The first part of the prophecy is fulfiled, or in course of fulfilzment. It rests with ourselves to avert the latter and more formidable evil.
PRINCE NAPOLEON AT MANCRESTER.-Prnce Napoleon was at the Exhibition of Art Treasures yesterday morning at an early hour, and after completing his examimation of the works of art there exhibited wert through the Botanic Gardens, and then returned to the Queen's Hotel. In the afternoon he proceeded by the London and NorthWestern and by the North Staffordshire lines of railway to Stoke-upon-Trent, in the Potteries, where he would arrive about 2 o'clock. His Royal Highness, after visiting some of the prinoipal manufactories of earthenware and China, was expected back in Manchester last eveniDg.

j SECOND EDITION. I . _. _ THE TIMABOFFIOB, Vursdaey Morning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), 6 p.m..- A grand dinner was given on the 12th to Lord Lyons, at the residence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Turin. All the Ministers were present. On the following day he was entertained at the Palace. Accounts from Spezzia of the 12th state that Lord Lyons was to sail thence with his fleet on the 14th, for Toulon, where he wiU remain some days, and then proceed to Algiers. The Toulon fleet, under Admiral Trehouart, sailed from that port on the 12th for a cruise. Letters from Rome announce that the Pope had restored to liberty three prisoners confined in the fort of Paliano: they'had stiUl an imprisonment of some months to undergo. The Diplomatic Corps had almost all quitted Rome. The French and Austrian Ambassadors alone remained, at the request of Cardinal AntoneUi. Colonel Pisacane, the leader of the late insurrection in Calabria, was admitted into the Foreign Legion in Algeria at the recommendation of the Duke de Montebello, at that time French Ambassador at Naples. His appointment was signed by General Trezel, Minister of War. He entered as Second Lieutenant, rose to the rank of Lieutenant, and resigned in the year 1848. His resignation was accepted by M. Arago, Minister of War ad interim of the French Republic. He distinguished himself at the Military School of Naples, and held the rank of Lieutenant of Engineers in the Neapolitan army. General Mellinet, who now commands a division of the Imperial Guard, was Colonel of the Foreign Legion when Pisacane entered. The Wmotiteuti publishes the official return of the receipts of the Customs and Excise for the first six months of the present year. As compared with 1856, they show an increase of 3,739,000f. for the month of June, and of 26,285,000f. for the six months. The Marquis de Belmont, the Emperor's Chamberlain, died of apoplexy on Monday at Quevilla, the seat of his aunt, Madame de Fitz-James. It is said that General Macmahon is to be promoted to the rank of Marshal of France, on the occasion of the Emperor'sfete, the 15th August. The news of the harvest from nearly all quarters of France is most cheering. In some the reaping is over, and in other places, where the corn is not yet ripe for the sickle, the heat, which in Paris at least is intense, will soon bring it to maturity. Letters from Burtin, in Corsica, of the 13th, mention that in some parts of the island the yield of grain is superabundant, and good throughout the entire. The price of wheat, which had been high, bas fallen 20f. the hectolitre. In the Calvados wheat has fallen 3f. the hectolitre. The price of fat oxen has also declined. The effect of the heat in Paris begins to be sensibly felt; thoroughfares are no longer thronged during the day with loungers; promenaders fly from the heat which turns the streets into furnaces, and take refuge in the Bois de Boulogae or the Pr6 Catalan, till a late hour of the night, when one seeks shelter within doors from the hot air without; the houses are like stoves, and, to enjoy anything like a cool atmosphere within the fortifications of the capital, one has to descend to the cellars. All who can do so are flying to the country, where, though the sun is in full force, the air is pure. The Emperor lives in the mnest simple fashion at Plombibres, without show of any kind, and troubling himself as little as possible with State affairs. The date of Queen Victoria's visit in not fixed, nor has it been officially made known as yet. Should it take place, Her Majesty will probably be received at Comnp tgne instead of Fontainebleau.

Berlin is never a very lively place at the best of times, not even at the height of the season; out of the season, which is abont eight months of the year, it rivals Bath or Cheltenham for prosy, monotonous insipidity, and aeording to all accounts these unexciting qualities have seldom been so amply developed as within the last month or six weeks. At length, however, there seems some chance of the soulless corpse of Berlin life being partially resuscitated by the retina of the Court, and the arrival of the Imperial visitors at Potsdam. It is now settled that the King and Queen return to Sans Souci to-mot - row afternoon, from Teplitz ,. thus somewhat abridging the stay that the King at first intended to make there on his retuin from Marienbad and Vienna. The Dowager Empress of Russia is expected on the 16th at Sans Souci. The State apartments at the Russian Embassy have also been parlially refurnished and redecorated in preparation for her visit, and that of the Emperor; and the private chapel of the Embassy, in -which Divine service according to the Greek ritual is performed, has been materiallyechanged by its ample and so thorough repairs and decorations as to require to be fresh inaugurated. This took place on Sunday evening last, and yesterday forenoon service was celebrated there in honour of the Empress-Mothers birthday. The decoration of the walls is of white and gold, while the ground glass of theowindows throws a "dim religious light ;" the simplicity of this elegant decoration serves to throw into prominent relief the high altar, which is constructed of oak and richly gilt, as well as adorned with pictures of saints. The arrival of thfo Emperor of Russia is expected about two days after that of the Empress-Mother, but seems not yet to be quite certain; his stay, however, on this occasion is to be shortened to two days, to make up for which he will in September pay this Court a more lengthened visit. The accounts from Kissingen, where the Emperor and Empress have been staying for the last week, describe the Monarch of All the Russias as leading as simple a life there as any private gentleman would; when he and theEmpress first enteredKissengen theyhad each of them one of their children on their lap, although their numerous suite required 120 horseas and from 16 to 20 vehicles for the luggage; audi at least once a day the Emperor is to be seen en, foot, in plain clothes, leading one of his little Lboys by the hand, and smoking his cigar, tbreadiAg his way through the groups of visitors to 'the - i,t vi9Xv nsz. In addition to Generals Todtleben, Budbterg, and Adlerberg, there are Couit Nesseirode and BWoi i Seebach to be seen generally in the groups immediately about the Emperor. Count Nessrode will leave Kissengen this week for Paris, which he has not re-visited mince t815. In - addition to the above-named, the King and Queen of Bavaria, and Herr von der Pfordten, the Bavarian Premier, have for some littlo timae past been staying at the same Bad, and it seems to be a favourite notion with those politicians whose talent lies in shrewd combination in advance, that a meeting of the Emperors of Russia, Austria, and France is to be brought about very shortly on Bavarian territory. This idea has just gained strength from the fact that the Grand Duke of Eessen-Darmstadt, the brother of the Empress of Russia, a week back sent M. de Grancy, the Eessian Minister at Parie, to wait upon the Emperor Louis Napoleon at Plombieres, and on his return set off himself last Saturday moining, accompanied by the above-mentioned Minister at Paris, the Hessian Minister at Vienna, and the Hessian Minister-President. All these conjectures and combinatioms are supposed to be invested with certainty of correctness by the circumstance that the Bavarian Lieutenant-General von Hohenhausen had an audience of the Grand Duke shortly before his departure from Darmstadt. The Prince of Wales arrived at Cologne on Satur day, and after a stay of a few hours proceeded up the Rhine to Konigawinter, where an hotel has been engaged and fitted up for him and his suite. On the day before a very elegant State carriage arrived at Coblentz by steamer from England, a present from the Queen to the Prince and Princess of Prussia. An interesting paragraph has been going the round of the papers of late informing us that the colossal stone crucifix, which formerly stood on the bridge over the Elbe, at Dresden, but which, in spite of its weighing 33 owt., and being soldered into the solid rock with 5 cwt. of lead, was washed away in 1845, together with a portion of the bridge, has just been found in the bed of the river opposite to the garden of the Japanese Palace. The very interesting story, however, is not yet true, whatever it may become in the course of years. The fa^ts on which it is founded are, that a steamer plying about tbere, in consequence of the present very low water in the Elbe touched with its',keel a large stone lying at the bottom, of which nothing was known when the Elbe was last as low as it is now, viz., in 1842; trgo, people conclude it must have come there since. The examination of the stone by divers has, however, not led as yet to the identification of the well-known pediment of the crucifix, and, still less, to the finding of the crucifix itself. SPAIN. (FROM OUR OWN CORn!SPOhDENm.) IIADRID, JULY 1L The foolish and hopeless insurrection of a handful of Democrats in the south of Spain has had the deplorable effect of bringing persecution upon numerous persons who had nothing at all to do with it, but who are obnoxious to the Government. Had MM. Narvaez and Nocedal themselves got up the revolt it could not have occurred at a more opportune moment, or better have answered their purpose. Just at the time when the public mind is exasperated by the law on the press, and by other measures which have nominally been passed through the Cortes, but in reality arbitrarily decreed, a pretext for intimidation is furnished. Full advantage is taken of it. Besides many arrests in the provinces, a very large number of persons-it is said as many as 300, but there is no means of ascertaining exactly-have been seized and imprisoned in Madrid during the last three or four nights. Many of the captives are sent off to Leganes, a poor village about four miles from Madrid, where there are a madhouse and a large military barrack. A Government organ yesterday announced that 70 had been sent thither the night before last. In the Congress, yesterday, Senor Gonzalez do la Vega, one of three or four deoputies who, in spite of the overpowering odds, stoutly make head against the Government, and at least denounce the illegalities they cannot prevent, rose and said that, for some days past, many arrests had been made in this capital, that among the numerous prisoners were a number of taxpayers, handicraftsmen, and orderly persons, who certainly could -not be considered as vagabonds, He desired to know the reasons for which the Govern ment ordered such arrests, and sent these persons in stringsto Leganes, at a time when the province is not in a state of siege, when no special law has been passed to authorize the suspension of constitutional guarantees, and when the Cortes are sitting. For sole reply to this very proper question Senor Moyano said that the Government had heard it, and would answer at a suitable time. Meanwhile, arrests continue, and people are marched away in gangs, like galley slaves, and cast into prison without any charge being communicated to them. Colonel Riego, a nephew of the celebrated Riego, has been imprisoned, but, fortunately for him, he has been placed, as a military man, at the disposal of the Captain-General of the provincs, who will doubtless see that justice Is done him. The manager of the Peninsula, a newspaper of advanced Liberal politics, [is also in prison, and begs either to be told his crime or released, but can obtain neither. Asquerino, another journalist, [rather hot-headed, and ultra, was Bo unfortunate as to have private business at Seville just when the disturbances broke out in that neighbourhood. On the 7th instant he was transferred from his hotel to the military prison, and the bail offered for him by some of the first persons in Seville was refused. In some of the electoral districts of Madrid persons have been arrested merely, it is said and believed, because they were active in opposing the Government candidates at the elections for the Cortes. The alarm that prevails is considerable. I know, positively, of inquiries having been made by respectable persons in easy circumstances whether they could not, by renouncing their nationality, get taken under the protection of a foreign embassy, so perilous do they consider their position to be. One of the chief characteristics of the present Minister of the Interior is his unforgiving and spiteful disposition, and he is nowtaking the opportunity of revenging himself on those who worked the most zealously against him at the time of tho electionsthose famous elections, so fairly conducted according to the Government and its organs, but at which, nevertljeless, it is notorious that the domestic ser vants of grandees were sent up with fictitious papers to vote for Ministerial candidates in the districts where these were hard run by the Opposition. The Iberia, which keeps a register of the insurrections and disturbances that occur in Spain under the Narvaez Ministry, has attained the number of 80, not including some of the most recent. It is true that few of them were of much importance,but they, nevertheless, prove great discontent in the country. And it is to be observed that of many of them, which happen in remote places, nearly the only accounts received are those given by the Government. Nothing has been published of an am- buscade in which it is said that a detachment of the Madrid chasseurs, proceeding southwards, were caught, and from which they did not escape without considerable loss. The Government accounts are all rose-ooloured. Bodies of insurgents are routed with,greatloss of dead andprisoners by small bodies of troops.which lose not a man. This is the usual s-AtEi of Spaniah bulletiaq and official reports, and th As it is.that few of ' details given areworth TepoA ffrciaVSo s QresjyndWetp *Autoi2rafa, the usual channt of Mhnlsterial inven. tions, is to be:credited only wien it relates things unfavourable to Government, and this it very rarely does. It mentions, by the bye, that amos-g other excesses committed by the insurgentain Utrera, they inflicted a number of stabs on a portrait of the Queen which hung in the hall of the Apuntamniento. It is unnecessary to trouble you with many particularr of the proceedings in the Cortes, these being reduced toa mere farce, and everything going on just as the Government chooses, with scarcely a shadow of opposition. The law of the press ws the last subject brought before those AssemblIea that rstill possessed some interest-an interest it owed to the fact that although opposition in the Congress was crushed by unfair manceuvres and violations of the regulations, the feeling out of doors was strong upon the question, and the newspapers made what fight they could. Yesterday, in the Senate, the authorization to put the law in force was conceded to the Government by 64 votes against 17. A Ministerial organ said last night that means have been employed to retain in Madrid enough deputies to vote the law of constitutional reform, which would leave the Congress at liberty to devote itself next session to the quiet discussion of the budget and of other matters of material interest. On the other hand, some of the Opposition journals, referring to the indecent rapidity with which TaliOus important measures have been hurried and pushed through the Chambers, express suspicions that it is the intention of Ministers to wait a long while before again assembling the legislative bodies. The Mexican negotiator, Senor Lafzagua, is still In Madrid, and to-day he has an interviewwith, Senor Pidal,-a final one, there is reason to think, and there can scarcely be a hope that it will have any good result. It is probably a last attempt at conciliation, and, if fruitless, it is to be expected that Senor Largua will avail himself of the opportunity to take his non-oficial leave of the stubborn Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs. Perhaps, if Senor Pidal be sincere in his desire to avoid hostilities, he will adopt the lest plan that now seems practicable, and send a commissioner to Mexico charged to propose an ultimat.um to the Comonfort Government, and, should that be rejected, to transmit to General Concha orders for immediate action. This idea of sending an uatimattm is, however, peremptorily repudiated by the Correspondencia, which is well known to receive most of its inspirations from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The semi-official sheet adds- " Our Government occupies itself at this moment with the important Mexican question, and proofs w;ll goon be seen that Spain is enduring only until she is wounded in her national honour. To this end, it is said that two war steamers, the Ulloa and the Cizarro, are aboat to sail from Cadiz for the Havannah, taking out instructions for General Concha from the Madlid Government, and also conveyng more troops and matc,rid of war for the expedition against Mexico, which Spain will inevitably undertake nuless rhe receives full satisfaction from that Republic." It is very easy to talk, in Bombastes' vein, of Spanish honour, which, of late years at least, has not always been preserved very bright and unsullied, but we are no longer in the days when every trifle was deemed sufficient grounds for a war, affecting not only the nations immediately engaged, but others whose interests would suffer by it. Certain Sparish newspapers have for a long time past indulged in every species of threat and invective against Mexico, but no facts have been stated, or proofs given, either by the press or by this Government, to show that there really are sufficient grounds for hostilities. It is unnecessary to enter again upon the facts of the case. As far as they can be ascertained, they have already been repeatedly placed before the public. It remains to be seen whether England and France will allow two petty Powers-for Spain, with her deeply, embarrassed finances and internal discords, and In the state to which maisgovernment has brought her, deserves no higher designation-to engage in a conffict which, if persisted in, might, and most probably would, bring about extremely unpleasant and even dangerous complications. The funds these last few days have b_en feeble and falling in price. It could hardly be otherwise with the prevalent feeling of uneasiness and discontent.

A letter from Berne of the 9th inst. says "The National Council of Switzerland commenced today the consideration of the conduct of affairs by the Federal Council during the year 1856. The principal discussion took place on the episcopal difference of Ticino, the deputies being desirous of severing the bonds which connect that canton for ecclesiastical mattecS with the bishoprics of Como and Milan. AL Fornerod, President of the Federal Council, showed that the course of negotiations did not depend solely on the Federal Council, but that body, he declared, was endeavouring to so conduct them as to lead to a resalt favourable to the honour of Switzerland. The Assembly was afterwards occupied with various propositions, one of which tended to accord to the Federal Counicil the abolute right of regulating everything concerning the permission t reside in the cantons. MA. Furrer, Martin, and Blanchenay demonstratedin the clearest manner that the proposition covld not be acceded to, as it was quite at variance with the cantonal sovereignty. This day the Federal Council, the members of the Government of Berne, and the Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the Federal Chambers, are invited to dine at the cantine of the Federal Shooting-match." A serious accident occurred last week at the bridge of St. Maurice, in Switzerland. An omnibus with 11 passengers was proceeding from the railway station of St. Manrice to Bex, when, in crossing the bridge, it came in contact with a stone-post, and was huried into the Rhine from a height of 40 feet. A lad had two legs broken, and his life is considered in danger. Several persons were seriously injured. Three boys, a gentleman, and an English lady, escaped unhurt. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES.

The extremely hot weather towards the close of last month, when the wheat was in blossom eneraDy throughout Worcestershirs, Gloestershire, and lIerefordshire, led to some apprehmsions of a failure in the kerning, but happily at 1hso critical moment when it was wanting we had some most acceptable thunder showers, which did no harm to the crors but hda wonderfully fructifying effect, and have added some bushels. per acre to the produce. The wheat is now ful, and, ia for. ward situations, is beginning to harden. The present sunny hot weather just suits it, and unless a very great thange takes place we shall have a very early and no douhl a very bountiful harvest, for, independent of the avera arodce beiing larger than usual, there is an increased Pbreadth of wheat planted, especially in Herefordshize.

ITRE INDIAN -AMY IN THE PUNJAB. (FROx OUR OWN COXYPOND £UNJ'AB, MAY 29. It id dfulic to know wlhat to write; certainly not for lack of matter; it requires but a man with eyes, ears, and understanding to write volumes, for, in truth, we in India are at this moment witnessing one of the greatest crises that the Civilized portiox of the human raew has ever pased through. Under theBe CircamstaDceS tlhe difflculty is to know what not to write-to dicard whatever is local and acci. dental, and yet to present a lively picture of the struggle whith the English made in May, 18K, when, as by -a earthquake, their power was shaken to its centre. I know I write with Bombay 11 days ahead of me. The advauce on Delhi, which now is future, will be pest and recorded before this letter quits India. Knewing ald this, assuming that, as regards the main features of the robelion, you are in advance of yoursorrespoedent, I will state briefly what I have seen in the Punsab-and North-Westen Proinces for the last eventful fortnight. The news burst onr India like a~ thundereap' that tthe native regiments. at Meerat and, Delh,i had mutinied, maurdered their officers, maesacred a3 the 'English inhabitants of Delhi placed, thel King of Delhi on the throne, and threatened the empirep, All this happened on the l1th of May. On the 13tSh it waasknown by telegraph to3uropea-t onlythroughout Iendia-4 say, to Europeans onl3s. for immedi,ately the post was stopped, and' an embargo' placed, on- all, native- correspondence: It is niot' too muchil ,to-say that'the telegraph saved'India. Whether-or!not the-report is true that the loth' of May was.the date fixed for a general rising of the Sepoy, regi.- ments andimassad-fe of all Eurapeans-in-the-Bengal Presidency cannot be known yet-perhaps-neverwill be known. It true, and certainly the rumourappeared: with strange coincidence at places far aparti.the- 3f Cavaly spoilt all by beginingon thie' '11th at Delhib Dn a moment the news -was- flashed, to Lahore- and Pesha.ur, to Allahabadand Cacutta,. to Bombay and Madras; and all' British Indis, was-on the alert. You will underatandI that for one' sUtton-wherethere is a Ruropean' regiment there are half-a-dozen. guarded solely by native troops. The whole Bengalarmy had, beoome for the moment untrust worthy. The first impulwe of the Europeans; however, was somethin&g better than that of mereself-preservation. The eivil authorities in the Punjab called at once on the population. I hopethe remnant of young Itndia, if' it exists- in thenew,House of Common3,.wil unlearn somespeecheawhen they hear that the Punjab populition hasresponded to a man.. The Sirdars and Jagheerdars" the indulged aristocracy,"'to use a phrase of thes covenant-have offered' men and arms, and'the offer has been- accepted.;: the villagers have- seized' fugitive mutineerar and' brought them to the civil authorities. The common- people in the roadsarecareful to evince towards Europeans a demeanour more respectful.than their ordinary respect ;. in theimportant cities of Jullundher and Hoshiarpur-the district officer was received by the people with enthusiasm-; the ranks of, the irregular army are thrown open, and recruita flock in crowds to besworn in. I'misced four servants in themorning,. and heard inthe evening-that tlieywere soldiers of theState. Every officer has-provided for his distriot; intwo days the wholeoffeneive and defensive resouroes, at his disposal were'broughtrinto action. Provision' was made to increase our-police -and irregulars; provision was made for a, last struggle of Europeans-if the worstcame to-the-worst. The Government -was not idle. Before the native troops had heard of themassacre at- Delhi- they were summoned to theirseveral parade grounds at Lahore and Peshawur, and in the presence of English artillery disarmed; Native chiefs who have been 'well treated in the day of triumph have been caUled upon to aid us ia the day of trial.. Not one has flinched. - A moveable column of Europsans- and PnnjabIrregulars was ordered to assemble at Jhelum, to pounce at once on any spot where sedition showeditself. Such were the energetic efforts made in three days-the 16th, 17th, and- 18th-days which, will not soon be forgotten by Englishmen in thePunjab. On tho-19th it began to-be apparent that the crisis as regarded these provinoes was past. Wewere ready; the people were with us to a man; andthe mutineers were cowed. When once it was clear that the Punjab was not a- source of danger, it became equally olear that it wasa mine of strength. The Jhehlm column, composed of Europeans andPunjabis, is advancingto join the force which, under General Anson, is even now on its way to Delhi. I believe that there, as elsewhere, the crisis-is- over, and that it remains only to -exact a fearful retribution, and then to set our house in order. If we are ever caught sleeping again we deserve the fate which now we have, if we haves just escaped. In the Punjab Sir John Lawrence has been worth o,000 European soldiers. Everywhere his voice has been heard; every aet of his has been full of vigour' and prompt wisdom;- and he has shown as the result of his administration a loyalpeople,eager to. join the Government in the suppression of a military rebellon.. It is the essence of the Punjab administration-to -have good subordinate officers. England has no better representatives than those -men. who, in thelast fortnight, have looked- the greatest possibledanger in the face, met it, quelled it, and, l believe, turned it to profit. In Oude, again, 5,000 European soldiersl powerhas appeared in the new Chief Commissioners Sir Henry Lawrence. With that wonderful gift of governing natives-indeed, of governingmen,which. Sir Henry possesses-he has reduced that province, intimately connected as it is with-the native regulararmy, fulli as it is. of all the elements of- rebellion; he has reduced it to loyalty by precautions, by firmness, by a speech, and some presents. The 7th Oudes Infantry was mutinous; Sir Henry disbanded them. Previous to the limcovery of this mutiny the soldiers. of the 7th proposed flagrant acti to the 48th Nativelnfantry1 quarteed- at lucknow. A native officer of the 48th- had the int?iguers arrested and deliverel them up to-justice. I have-told you how Sir-Henry dealt with the mutineers, whose mutiny consisted' -rather in ggrumbling than any, overt act. But he, ' did not forgat the othor ride of justice. He held 'an open Durban; ho denounced- in soldierly- language tho- foul- deeds of the miscreants- ,at Delhi, who3o iu6quities had just been. heard of. He pzinted, out as a contra3b to the traitorous mrutineers those brave soldiers who had- at. -one met suggestions of rebeion by arresting the, uggustors.

MANCHESTEB BXHIBITION OF ABT TREASURES. (Continued from T7 iTimeu of June 18.) Between 1640 and 1694 the gallery of the Archduke Lesopold William, Governor of the Low Countries, was under the superintendence of David Teniers, the son of a popular Antwerp painter of the same name. This young man, born in 1610, 'was remarkable for the facility of his pencil, and his power not merely of representing the faces and things round about him,but of imitating the styles of all preceding masters, both Italian and Flemish. He was the most rapid of workmen, and his method of paiating with thiu transparent colour, on which the I;ghts, laid with a well-filled brush, chiefly served to indicate precise form, was snited to this rapid production. He is said to have often finished a picture in a day, and used to say, laughingly, that to hold all his works a gallery of two leagues long would be required. There exist not lesI than 1,089 known pictures of his, in aU of which ve find a perfection of workmanship to which no other painter can be said to approach. He was rich, popular, and happy in his art, living en. seigneur in the ChAteau of Perk, between Antwerp and Mechlin, and painting the peasant life and rustic nature of the neighbourhood. In the Manchester Exhibition are some 15 of his pictures, of which (896) " the Death of Leander" and (897) " the Triumph of Neptune" are worthy of remark as examples of his imitative manner, being quite in the spirit and style of the Caracci working on a small scale. The other examples include most of the painter's favourite subjects:" A Guard-room" (983), with its drinking and dicing troopers, and scattered arms and accoutrements; " Ninepin-players " (1,018), with a landscape of great truth to nature; a quartette of boozing boors (1,021), from Her Majesty's collection, and divers village festivals, cabarets, smokers, cardplayers, and old women peeling onions. Who does not know the gray clayey walls, the up-turned tub that serves for a table, the old man in violet jerkin and gray hose, and his boon companion in gray doublet and red cap and feather, and the " canewes' of Flemish stoneware, and the tobacco-pipes, and the red earthen pots, and the tame owl on his perch, and the unfranmed print pinned to the wall? He sometimes, however, aspired to higher subjects, and there is one picture here, " A Christ crowned with Thorns" (1,022), from Lord Ward's collection, which is a curious instance of that purely Dutoh treatment of a sacred subject of which other examples are here furnished in an "I Adoration of the Shepherds" (1,072), by Adrian Ostade (from the collection of Mr. John Walter, M.P.), and a " Marriage of Cana" (946), by Jan Steen, from the eame collection. We ought not to forget, however, in considering Teniers, thathewas essentially at theorders of his employer. Wemay regret that so much sldl was pent on such subjects as generaUy employed his pencil. The best that can be said in his justification is that he paintedcontemporaryrealities,andwaspartandparcee of the life of his time, especially that large part of it which was spent in the beerhouse. Adrian Brauwer may be cited as a type of time wasted and talent drowned in such places. The small picture of his here (1,042) of "Boors Quarrelling" is not sufficient to give any true notion of his powers. He was the most distinguished pupil of Frank Hals, and the master of the younger Teniers after he came out of the hands of his father. With great natural power of painting, he sotted and guzzled away his life, died in the hospital of Antwerp at 32, and was buried in a pauper's grave. But Rubens, on learning his death, had the body disinterred, and gave him a decent and respectful tomb in the Church of the Carinelites. His pictures are scarce, as might be expected from so brief a life so flung away. Jan Steen is generally referred to as a similar instance of confirmed sottishness. It is somewhat difficult to reconcile the current stories of Jan Steen's confirmed tippling, which broke him first as a brewer then as a tavernkeeper-both which liquorish trades he is said successively to have combined with his painting-with the number of pictures be painted, and the qualities of firm touoh, elaborate composition, and nice discrimination of the ignoble character which they possess in so eminent a degree. Examine any of the nine pictures of his here-for example, the famous "Village School" (935), contributed by Lord Ellesmere-and see if you can believe that the diseased brain, bleared eye, and shaky hand of a drunkard could have conceived and executed that self-imDortant old pedagogue who is nibbing a pen, or the children whom his wife is guiding through cries-cross row, ferule in hand? Wilkie never painted anything showing as nice observation or fine finish. Or take the otber achool picture (1,051), where the beermuddled master is asleep and the most hideous and defiant disorder rages, in the midst of which the pig, who has walked in and is devouring the leaves of a book, seems the only creature animated by any hunger after knowledge. But into this picture enters another and sadder element, which we seem to see in most of Jan Steen's works, and which, indeed, is peculiar to them-a spirit of cynical contempt for the world and its ways, an outpouring of scorn, whose loud laughter has no mirthfulness. Jan Steen a merry painter ! What mirth is there in these "Marauders Attacking and Pillaoing Peasants" (934), as naked and grim a picture of the horrors of war'as ever was painted ? Even in the profuse eating and driniking of " The Dinner" (936), from the Hope gallery, and the " Marriage of Cana" (946), in the half-tipsy gravity of the dancing pair and the nicely graduated beeriness of the bystanders, in the merrymaking there seems to us infininitesadness and ecorn, and no frank enjoyment. Jan Steen is the Holbein of Dutch art. The skeleton always sits at his tavern tables and fiddles at his kermesses. The only two pictures of his here in which the death's head is not visible are the "Party in a Tavern Balcony" (932), where a drunken old bascso profondo is roaring out a song, to which other topers are listening, some keeping time with eye and finger, others trying to read the words over the singer's shoulder, others listening vacantly, with minds far away in Liquorland ; and the " Wandering Musician" (933), in which a ballad singer, after entertaining some peasants, has sent round the hat, and is trying to screw out a contribution from what seems a very hopeless quarter. In this last picture there is a warm and pleasant sunniness that reminds one of Cuyp, and an admirable daylhgbt effect both in landscape and figures. A life-size female portrait of a fat hostess asleep is an example of the painter's work on a scale which he seldom attempted. Of the two Ostades (both of whom are wellrepresented at Manchester) Adrian was the pupil of Frank Bals, and fellow-student of the unhappy Brauwer. le worked in Haarlem till 1662, but wasfrightened away by the French invasion as far as Amsterdam, on his way to his native Lubeck. His apprehensions were calmed at Amsterdam, and, settling there, he painted in that city till his death, in 1685. In Adrian Van Ostade we find nothing of the peculiar cynical sadness of Jan Steen. He frankly painted the outward nature and faces round about him with exquisite skill of manipulation, and a precision and charm of handling only inferior to that mastery of touch which characterizes the younger Teniers. Among the siX pictures of his here the "Still Life" (740), contributed by Lord Uver:stone, is an example of the elder Ostade's masterly power of representation. " The Musicians" (730), from Her Majesty's collection, an interior with a violin-player and singers,full of golden effectof sunset, and the "Court-yard,"with peasants, from Mr. H. T. Hope's gallery, are beautiful specimens of the characteristic qualities of the master, his fine transparent depth and exquisite handling. "The Adoration of the Shepherds," sent by Mr. Walter, has already been referred to. Mr. Holford sends a fine smaU picture of "A A Man and his Wife Sittitng at a Table." Isaac Van Ostade, the younger brother and pupil of Adrian, may here be studied in four large pictures, of which one (759), "Travellers Halting at an Inn," from Buckingham Palace, is remarkable for its force and precision, and contrasts in these respects with a subject of the same kind not far off, attributed to the same painter. Al the four works of 1saac Van Ostade here shown are in his later arid better manner. Of Schalken, the pupil of Gerard Douw, so woll known for his candle light effects, the Exhibition contains one of the three unusually fine specimens at Buckingham Palace, " Le Roi Detrouss6," where in a game of forfeits, one of the party, having had to strip to his shirt, is seatedon the floor, half merry, half rueful, among a party of gontlemen ^an ladies, who are enjoying the situation. In colour and execution Schallen here shows himself not far 1 bebind his master. Teniers, and is said to have been sometimes preferred to him in the master's lifetime, to the great mortification of Teniers. His pictures here, " Interior, with figures" (1,067), " A Country Party" (1,624), the latter one of his finest works (from the collection of Lord Listowell), show how inferior he was to Teniers. There is, indeed, so little resemblance between their styles that we feel inclined to doubt the pupillage altogether. Of the elder, or Franz Mierin, the most accomplished of all Gerard })ouw's pupils, whose works are valuable in proportionto their rarity, Manchester is fortunate m possessing tbree small but admirable little pictures. In perfection of trathful finish Mieris hardly falls short of his master, and, indeed, merits a lower place chiefly from the smaller size, And even more trivial subjects, of his works. The single figure called a "Pedestrian" (1,078),. from the Holford gallerv, is full of mice character, genially and delicately given. One enjoys the contents of the flask with the shrewdold roadater. The second picture is from Mr. H. T. Hope's collection, "A Gentleman" (1,073), dated 1660. He has been enjoying his flask of Rhenisb, a dish of crayfish, and the girl of the house is making out the score. The third picture (1,056), from Miss Bredel's small but fine collection, represents a comely girl " skinking" to a cavalier, while a comrade sleeps at a neighbouring table, and a second couple are seen making love in a doorwvay beyond. In point of size and completeness of execution, truth of light and sha~de, and harmnony of tone, this picture isone of the finestexamples of the master in EDngland. If we wish to contrast commendable and manly with false and effeminate finish, we cannot do better than turn from Franz Mieris to his son Wilhelm, in whose work all truth of effect is lost in the ivory-like smoothness to which he work his surface, whatever he may be representinJg. Here are good average examples of the "Fishmongers', Poulterers', and Greengrocers' shops," for which William Mieris is famous (1,06, 1,070). Perhaps we ought to have classed Mienis the elder rather wtith the painters of conversation-pieces, like Terburg and Metu than with the painters of boors and cabarets B3e has more analogy in touch and tone, as well as in subject, with the former, who are here abundantly exemplified. As with Teniers and Jan Steen, life with these men is very much a matter of eating and drinking; only the rude village beerhouse has become a well furnished room; the frieze jerkin and clouted shoes are turned into a buff coat or a velvet doublet and boots of cordovan; for the stuff gown and linen mob we have ratin and velvet andc a silken hood; for the beer we drink Rhenish and the pipe is flung away. Gerard Terburg, the master of this school, probably rstudied under Douw, though this is not certain. fle travelled in Italy and worked in Rome before settling at Deventer, where he spent the later years of his life. His great work is the picture of " the Plenipotentiaries," arsembled at the Congress of Munster, In 1648. After painting it Terburg, by invitation of the Spanish Ambassador at the Congress, visited Madrid, where many of his pictures may soill be seen in the Royal collection. His known works are few in number, and highly valued for the perfection of their finish, especially in the costume of the ladies. They have a better claim to distinction in the art with which Terburg generaly suggests in his compositions a little domestic drama. He almost always takes a point of suspense. Tt may be a trumpeter waiting to carry a letter, which a cavalier is deeply meditating. You feel that much hangs on that letter, and you amuseyourself by wondering if it be the answer to a summons to surrender, or a cartel, or a biletdoua; or it is a lady writing a letter, and a cavalier stealing on tiptoe to look over her shoulder, and you wonder if he will read in the letter a rivals name or his own; or, it is a group like this from Lord Ellesmere's gallery, sometimes called " Paternal Advice," sometimes the " Satin Gown" according as the namers have thought more of the one or other of the above-noted merits of the painter. There are three known repetitions of this pioturethe one now here, one at Amsterdam, and another at Berlin. To our mind the picture seems 111named. The sensible-looking gentleman in the chair is not throwing away advice on the handsome girl in the white satin gown ;-handsome she surely is, though.her back is toward us. He is simply, with raised hand and bent finger, keeping time to the song she is singing. You may see the sheet of music in her hand. Of the picture attributed to the same master, absurdly called " the Council of Trent" (524), we can give no account. It does not seem to us to have any of the characteristics of the painter. Gabriel Metsa was the pupil, and scarcely the inferior of Terburg, ki the treatment of similar subjects. Here is a capital specimen of him, "the Intruder," a rude gallant, who, defiant of the resisting Abigail, has burst his way into the room where one boina-roba is at her toilet, while another is just stepping out of bed, alarmed at the noise. It is full of expression and admirable throughout in colour and composition. Eglon Van der Neer, tho son of Aort Van der Neer (the painter of moonlights), is another master of the scarlet velvet jacket, white satin petticoat, and laced-hood style, here represented by just such comely, white-skinned clemish models as these painters loved (1,048), and " a Pair of Lovers at a Table" (951), from Mr. Hope's gallery. Gaspar Netecher is another excellent painter of the school of Terburg; here to 'b studied in "a Lady in White Satin feeding a Parrot at a Window" (1,058), from Mr. Hope's collection. Ochterveldo is another pupil of the same master, of whom here is a pleasant little picture, with considerable humour, of "A Girl tickling a Sleeping Cavalier with a Feather" (1,064), from the collection of Mr. John Walter. Who does not know the gray horse of Wouvermans ? of whose pictures one might almost open one's description as Mr. James does his novels,"In a sunny morning of May, 16-two travellers might be observed riding," &c. We know nothing certain of the life of Wouvermans, not even who was his master. What is recorded by Houbraken and D'Argenville of his'great poverty, of his giving his daughter a portion of 20,000 guilders, of his having burnt his drawings lest his son should follow his father's profession, besides the obvious contradictions these stories involve, seems to rest on no reliable authority. All we know, in fact, of this painter are his works-his halts, horsefairs, skirmishes, hunting and hawking parties, farriers' shops, and sutlers' booths. His subjects certainly indicate anything but poor circumstances. He seems to have been conversant with the amusements and occupations of the rich, and paints with a spirit and finish little characteristic of work done for bread under the pressure of clamorousneed. Here is the celebrated group of "Soldiers at a Cabaret (980), from Buckingham Palace, calledthe "Coup de Pistolet," from the petronel which one of the troopers is firing in the air. A very important and spirited " Cavalry Charge" (989), from the Fesch collection, sent by the Earl of Ellesmere, and the well-known " Course au Hareng" (088), the property of Mr. Holford, in which peasants on cart-horses are rumning at a rope with a herring attached to it, at which each rider takes a snap as he passes under it, wita the riSB of a tumble. -Here, too, is a vwinter scene (994), with tho figures beautifully touched, and a truthful effect of breaking sunlight, contributed by MiBs Bredel; a " Horse-fair," sent by Mr. Lloyd (938), and "IA Camp-follower or Gipay suckling her Child, near a Cart with a gray Horse,' also from Mr. Hlolford's collection (986). Le Duo was a pupil of Paul Potter, who figures here only as a painter of a family group (974), very truthful, though unlike his usual class of subjects, which more resemble Wouvermans. Van der Meulen, after his early studies under Peter Snayers, at Brussels, visited Paris, when he was presented by Le Bran to Louis XIV., and was employed officiaUy to commemorate the military achievements of " Le Grand Monarque," following him for this purpose on his military promenades and all his statelyplayings at soldiers. His beat works are at Versa'les. Here are two of his smaller battle-pieces (976, 977), with Louis XIV. in all the glory of periwig, cuirass, laced coat, and jackboots, a masquerade Mars of most martial and buckram magnificence. Wyck (1,616-1,088) was an imitator, and probably a pupil of Wouvermans, of whom here is an inter- esting and large picture, curious for costume and subject, of "John Sobiesky raising the Siege of Vienna" (1,840), contrbuted by the Hon. Warren Vernon. Far and avway at the head of the Dutch cattle painters, in the very first rank, indeed, of al who have ever painted cattle or ldscape, stands Paul Potter. Popular ashewvas in his lifetime, whenprinces and nobles eempctsd for his wrorlcs, the market value of his picturs has increased so enormously that - ,, ,,.1 .t 3w; =,,},j,Pli s,fA 10)0 r q nan few Wot. has within the present century fetched 2,8001. Nor is this an isolated case. The rise in the cost of every picture of this master which has come into the market for the last 30 years has been in nearly the gane proportion. Lovers of nature wiU tolerate an immense amount of enthusiasm for Paul Potter. There is a singular charm in his skies and in the meadows, or bits of broken road, in which he sets his groups of cows aud goats, or his 3maneged, croptailed, round-limbed horses. The Manchester Exhibition contains three of these charming pictures, small, but with such a sentiment of nature in their skies, their Ettle bits of meadow, and willow clumps, as we cannot hope to convey in words. These are the landscapes, of which one, representing " Two Cows and a Bull" (998), formerly formied part of the Nieuwenhuys Collection, and now belongs to Mr. John Walter; of this the sky is breezy, with gray rolling clouds. The second of the three (1,006), from Mir. Hope's gaUlery, represents a bull standing on a rising ground, forming a group with somb cows and sheep; it is backed by a stormy sky, out of which comes a wind that whitens the willows. The third is a most delicious little silvery landscape of Mr. Holford's, with an ass and two goats (1,002). Between these three gems it is difficult to choose. In comparison with them we care little for the more celebrated picture from the Royal colection of " The Scene in front of a Stable," with a frightened boy, wvho, running off with puppies, has been fiercely asiled by the bereaved bitch, or the other two Paul Potters here-Mr. Hope's " Man in a Barn" (764), or Mr. Sanderson's "Peasant with a gray and a brown Horse" (766). Berghem seems artificial after the unforced truth of Paul Potter. Clever in composition and dexterous in manipulation as he is, Iqfighem in none of his pictures impresses us as a sincere and unaffected lover of nature. Paul Potter never paints a picture but he shows himself one. The small landscape (804) from the Holford collection, known while it formed part of Mr. Beckford's gallery as the " Little Diamond," is the gem of the seven Berghems here, The large lanldscape (108) isan evident imitation of Rubens. The "Snow Scen@~' (805) is clever and curious, from its contrast with the effects most frequently painted by the master. There is a capital head of a cow, life size (999), and a group of skirmishers, or sportsmen trying to get a shot at wild ducks, we scarce know which (979), which is full of spirit, sketchy, but refreshingly inartificial for a work of Berghem's. Of Berghem's pupil, Karel du Jardin, here is a curious portrait subject (720), representing William the Taciturn and the painter, with a capital scene of the mnan*ge (971), contributed by Mr. T. Baring, which formerly beloni to the FonthilCollection, as well as a spirited "HEtalt" (1,038), with the date 1655, belonging to Mr. Holford, and some " Cows in a Meadow" (978), sent by Her Majesty. Solomon Ruysdael (1,008) and Suion Van Der Does (1,00]) are each represented by a picture of cattle in combination with landscape. Turning from the polders to the towns, we may walk with Van der Heyden along the lindenbordered side paths which skirt the canals of Amsterdam (741), or, with Pieter de Hooge, may tarn from the street into the cool and spacious hall (950) in which that dignified gentleman and his worship. fulilady in her black silk coiffe are walkdng so composedly. De Hooge was probably a pupil of Douw, but this is not certain. He devoted himself to the representation of light, and succeeded marvellously in rendering both its indoor and outdoor effects. In the picture we have described, however, it is odd that, striking as the effect of light is, it is perfectly false. All the shadows of the pillars and other objects in the hall are thrown from right to left, while the light from the window in the room, into which the hall opens, falls from left to right. Mr. Walter's De Hooge, a garden scene, with shady alleys and ladies and gentlemen playing at ninepins, is a work of consummate truth of effect. It is like a scene of real tranquil, country-house, afternoon amusements, observed through a diminishing glass. In comparison with this the "Mother Nursing" (945), aad the " Old Woman" (1,060), with beaclothes on her arm, calling to a child at a glass door, appear less marvellous for illusion than they would if they hung alone as exampls of the painter. Space will not allow ns to do more than mentioni the frost scenes of Schellineks (1,017), Van Beerestraaten (1,026), and Mans (1,012), all good of their kind. Nor can we pause to compare the marvellous flowers and fruits of Van Os (1,014, 1,015), Vani eem Baptiste, and Van Oelst (941), with the still more luscious masses of colour of Van Huysum (940, 943, 1,009, and 1,010). The cabinet portrait subjects of Van Musseher (952), and Peter Van Schuppen (965), " a Harbour," by Van Lint (962), the fowls of Houdekoeter, the insects of Johann KeBsel (1,016, 1,062), the vegetables of Adrian Van 'Utrecht, and the game of Weenix, we must be content merely to name. With this enumeration we have closed our notice of the Dutch and Flemish section of the Manchester Exbibition.
TuE VIcERoYALTY oF DuBL.-On Mfonday the Corporation of Dublin presented an address to his Excellency on the question of abolition, insisting upon the im. policy of destroying the office of Viceroy. Lord Carlisle returned a reply which has given great satisfaction to the Dublin publio. His Lorship said,-"I am convinced that the continuance of the Viceregal Court contributes materially to make our own capital a place of increased resort and importance, and I cannot treat as purely frivolous the influences that act upon the trade and prosperity of an ancient and populous city, or believe that they do not radiate to a rar wider circuit. And, while I chould be far from seeking to prejudge what alteration of existing establishments the lapse of time or change of circumstances may recommend, I stiU conceive that the precipitate abolition of an office which, under one modification or another, has now subsisted for nearly seven centuries, which has preceded and survived a separate Legislature, and has engrained itself into the laws, customs, and feelings of an entire people, cannot be effected without difficulties and complcations which very great and obvious commensurate benefits should alone persuade us to encounter. There is one point on which I yet feel more strongly assured. We have pereeived how small a fraction of the Irish representation has voted in favour of the abolition of the Irish Viceroyalty. I am clearly of opinion it would be neither prudent, generous, nor just to change this ancient form of administration without a marked concurrence on the part of the loyal and well-disposed portion of the Irish people." EmCTo2z ExPENsES.-lmTe expenses of the candidates at the Canterbury, Sandwich, and Rochester elections have been published. In the first place there were four candidates, the successful ones being the Hon. H. Butler Johnstone and Sir Wiliam Somervile. Mr. Johnstone got in for 1381. 16s. Id. Of this sum the professional services amount to 391.; clerks and messengers to 801.; and one-third part of the expenses for erecting the hustings to 581. People wonder what there was in the rough pile of wood erected on the occasion to cost 1751a Sir William Somerville's total expenditure amounts to only 2671. 13s. 3d. For clerks and messengers 561. was given; for tradesmen's biUs 31. 14s. An announcement is made by the election auditor that the defeated candidate, who went to the poll (Mr. C. Purton Cooper, Q. C.,) not having paid the election bills no abstract could be published. At Sandwich, where there were fourcandidates,the successful gentlemen wereLordC. Paget and Mr.E.K.Iugessen. The expenses of tho first amounted to 2251.; of the second to 2501; and of Mr. M'Gregor, who was defeated, to 3161. Each of the candidates paid between 501. and 601. for professional services. At Rochester Mr. W. G. Romaine was the unsuccessful and Sir F. Smith the successful candidate. The first paid for his defeat 3411. 8s. Id.; the second for his success 3551. 9s. 4d, The coat of erecting the hustings wfrs 381., which makes still more remarkable the 1751 charged at Canterbury. THE MooRs.-Accounts of the moors continue ia almost every case favourable. On the Knockando hins, in Lower Strathspey, the broods are plentiful but not larg", while partridges promise very well on the low grounds. In Abernetby a great many of the grouse died during the -winter, but the remaining birds bred well, and sport would have been good by the 12th of August but for a flood of rain upon the 5th of June. Previously the weather was very dry, which induced the young broods to lie by the sides of the watercourses; in this position, the brooks swelllng rapidly, a great many of them were drowned and carried away. Coveys, however, are not unplentiful, and they are strong, numbering from seven to twelve. On Baynao and the higher portions of the Abernethy shootings, and also wel up on the Cairngorms, as well as on the shootings of Glenmore, some part of the younger birds must have saffered from the snow lying to a great depth about the mriddle of June. On the Darnaway moors, in Morayshire, the grouse are strong and healthy, numbering from seven to eight in each covey. The reports of the grouse shootings on the Inverness and Ross-shire moors are not quite so encouraging. In Glen-Urquhart many of the birds were barren. The coveys in consequenee are not numerous, and they are later than usual. Neats with eggs stil unhatched were to be seen until near the end of last month, The extra number of barren birds is, of course, the result of a disease from which the grouse in that quarter suffered so severely, and from which they have not yet perfectly recovered. As the deaths have mostly occurred among fEmale birds, sportsmen would do wel to eonfine themselves as much as possible to shooting male birds, so as to give the ground a chance of recovering. On the Cromir Lmoors, on Deeside, Aberdeenishire, the birds are numerous and strong. The eoveys number from eight to ten, and in some instances they are to be found numbering 12 and up-wards. They were beginning to take wing by the end of June, and by the 12th of August few cheepers will be found except on grounds with a northern exDosure. Nob a diseased bird has been seen on the whole range of hills in this quarter. The sport, it may safely be cukated, will bnr.w above anD avernoe.-Ranffshre.1 Jo'.^f
INDUSBRIAL EDUCATION. TO THEE EDITOR OF THE TIM:ES. Sir,-The expediency ot an inidustrial training of the phildren of the working classes as a great national object is at last receiving that share of attention it so well deserves. We are arriving at the conviction that the education of any cla4s of our fellow creatures should, to be really valuable, be of a nature to qualify them to perform the practical duties of the station in life to which, under God, they have been called. I have long foreseen that the endeavour to create a race of village " prodigies" could only end as it has done. Out of a certain number of young brains submitted to the process a very small number attain that measure of intellectual excellence which qualifies them to rise-if opportunity offersabeve the station in life to which they were born. The rest remain onhand, with heade crammed with an amount and variety of teaching, which they have neither the disposition or the time to turn to any profitable account, the direct tendency of -which, however, has had this effect-it has rendered head and hand little fitted for the monotonous, unintellectual work by which alone, in their peculiar station of life, they can earn life's support. On a somewhat similar mistaken principle I have seen money misspent by landlords in building dwellings for the labourers. There is a great expenditure in niaking the " new cottages " picturesque, and so constructing them that theyabound in ingenious contrivances for a most overstrained provision for all that cm conduce to morality and decency; the inmates feel, from the constantintrusionof "company from the houie" that they are on "show." and therefore live in an enforced tidiness, scarcely made palatable by the " tips" and praises of the inquisitive visitors who form the landlord's audience, as he points out with his stick, above, anad below, and about the dwelling, all the happy contrivanceshe has employed to compass the " moral" and the "sanitary" of cottage life. Of course, small families of wonderful habits are chosen for these dwellings, for they must live a Sunday life every day, while the lord or the squire "be down home." In the meantime, such hag been the cost of these hotbeds of tidy economy that the same estate will very likely, for 20 such, have further off from the mansion 40 or 50 dwellinga in which human life is simply pig life glazed and staircased. Just so with schools, you are shown theiz walls furnished with diagrams explanatory of the rudiments of the severest science; the class-room has its large wooden model of the steam-eng-ine, an orrery, a large collection of " objects" in aid of lessons combining amusement with instruction in the several ologies. The master and mistress are most superior people, quite equal to the tutorial and schoolroom requirements in any private family of rank. The first class is called into the class-room; the master in an easy off-hand way knocks at the brains of the 10 or 12 boys in turn ; these brains open at the knock, and out comes without hesitation a stream of knowledge monotoned, which the same master might knock in vain for at the brain-doors of half the House of Peerstwo-thirds of the House of Commons. You are probably too glad to plead a pressing engagement to escape the offer kindly made to yourself to examine the class. Now, Sir, I admit it to be very wonderful that4 what we hear on these occasions should flow as it does through teeth that masticate bacon as the rule, butcer's meat as the rare exception. But I question the real value of these pearls to those who expectorate them. Bill Hubbard cannot serve two masters-a brain craving to revel in the paths of science, a stomach desirous of food only to be obtained behind the plough. He will either have taken in knowledge that he will soon forget, as a mere school lesson belonging only to school days; or, if hehas really acquired a taste for all the mental refinement to which he has been introduced, he will be very unhappy and discontented when the call of a hard working life shuts him out from its indulgence. But I am told " these boys wiU rise above their station; they must, their intelligence will command a market." Is it not a fact that at this very moment there is a supply of educated youths in the land far above the demand for them; that even professional men who have voted for bankers, merchants, and even " Ministers," cannot get an opening foundat thes nallestsalary for " a well educated youth, the son of most respectable parents ?" I do not dispute that many great men have worked their way to eminence from a very low origin, and so may it ever be, ag,it surely will be. The mistake 1 see made is the attempt to put the seeds of greatness per force into the brains of a whole class. I don't want to have 40 boys spoilt for plain, honest, perspiratory labour that some five may become possibly eminent in literature, or comparatively wealthy at the desk of a Government office. Success is the great sweetener of toil ; for a village boy to succeedin his destinedpath of labour, heart and hand must work together; practice alone will give skill; it is skill in work that makes it reaRy grateful to hand and heart. Ploughing, hedgig, draining, turnip hoeing, even turnip topping, may be ill or well done; in each perfection is the resuft of practice, it has its reward, not simply in money value, but in that feeling of our nature which sees and feels a triumph in success. For the sake of the true happiness of the children of the agricultural labourers, I pray to see a day when industrial training may be considered of more value than it is at present; but I am not blind to the great difficulty of obtaining it. There is, I fear, no way by which outdoor labour can be taught with any real great result by any modification of mere schooling. I know it has been tried, and with some little success, but in practice the farm field, the stable, and the barn must be the real school To make a good servant you want a disposition to serve as well as the power to do so. Boys or girls working at industrial pursuits in classes, under teachers, get "handy;" but more than this is wanted. A master watchmaker could make 20 boys expert in a good deal of the manipulation of his trade in a school, but there is a something which can only be got in the shop required to make any one of these a valuable apprentice. Temper has to be formed for service, and can only be formed in service. Girls may be taught in massesto wash, iron, work, and cook, and yet make bad servants if kept too long from actual service. The "ways" of a kitchen, a laundry, housemaids' " ways," can only be acquired at the real scene of action. I am satisfied that the greatest charity the rich can bestow on the working classes of their several neighbourhoods is to make their own households, stables, and gardens, schools of industry. Let them take a young girl into the kitchen, the laundry, under the housemaid; encouraging cook, Martha, and Mary to aid in the work of training them in their several departments; let it be imderstood that this is schooling for service-not service-their food the sole wages for the first year ; aive the ruiing powers of the kitchen, laundry, nd bc>edrooms a small bonus for every child so trained for a year; let these, if possible, still attend the Sunday school; thus, at an expense which would scarcely be felt, there would be real and abiding benefit done. If gardener and groom had alsoo their schOlastic apprentice, here, too, good would be achieved. In some cases it might be advisable to have two girls in each department, taking week -by week in turn; the week at home to be given, half eaoh day to the school, the other half to home duty. a to that overatrained prudery which says it would expose the morals of these young girls to Unfair trial by sending them into large establishments, my answer is, look at all to which they are exposed at home; and further, I am satisfied that wherever a master or mistress of a household are of a disposition thus to help the poor around them their servants will themselves be too well chosen not to be trusted to abstain from injuring by word or deed those their employers would benefit.

THE SCOTOH DEER FoRx Ts.-During the whole season there has not been a single unfavourable excoeptionin onr reports of the prospect of the deer forests in the north. Lord Alexander Russell and family, we learn, are expected very soon at their beautiful highland home, Donne of Rothlemur2hus. lis Lordship will find the condition of his deer forest everything he could wish. The stags are numerons and in prime condition, and the heads Will be early at maturity. To the Culnakyle grounds a very important acquisition has been made in the enolosure, to the e.xtnt of 12 milee in circumference, of a rough secluded pat of the forest, whioh, although done only for the preservatien of he wood, will tend to harbour and protect vast numbers of roe deer, and even a stray herd of red deer may heretake refuge occasionally, for it will soon become an excellent p2eserve. In the western glens of Inverness-shire very gra)ifyine accounts are given of the forests. The deer are thrfiiaR erednglywel.-lBawTskire .ou,fnqf
ELECTION COMMIITBES. LAMBETIT. The Committee on reassembling3yesterday morning delibarated for a shbrt time upon an ppcation hich had been made to them by letter by Mr. Jhodes, the ;entloman aUuded to on the previous day by Mr. Roupelln his evidence, to be allowed to give an explanation of the part he had taken in the transactions to which Mr. Roupell had referred. On the admission of the publie, The CHAiRmAN informed Mr. Rhodes that the statement respecting him made by Mr. Roupell was only indenta to, and nota^part oF, the case; but, as it had obtained pub. licity, the Committee wiould aloe him to attend after the bad arrived at their decision, and make a statement for the puroeeof leunghinmself. fr. ¶Bhodes said he had attonded for the purpose o£ stating that his communication wtith Mr. Roupell was en. tirely unoonnected with the PetitiOners. lix. B. JBr~ said, the only question he wished to put to Mr. Rhodes was whether that gentleman had had any communication with Mr. Harrison or Mr. Cross? It was eventually agreed that the counsel on either side should be at liberty to call either Mr. Cross or lMr. Rhodes, mnerely for the purpose of making clear what connxion existed between them, but upon an intimation made by the Joseph Tredre, the witness who had been taken Into custody by thoSerjeant-at.Arms on the previous day, was firstexamined by MIr. JAMES. Hie stated that during the election he was employed as a canvasser by Mr. Gillam, the chairman of the committee at the Sm-roy Caal Tavern. There were 13 committeemen, all of whom acted as caunvas. sers. About fo tdays before the election he was preent at theSmty CnalTavern, whEen Mr. ECoupell, MIr. Doulton, M.uran,sd Gillamwerethere.

He had sent to the persons who employed himto say that he should not appear unless he was paid. He hadreceived no communicahon from either party. 5e was not aware that he was disobeying the orders of the House in keeping out of the wray. The CaussAx.-It depends upon the merclfvl eond. deration of the House whether or not you will be seat to &ewgate. The witness then withdrew. Mr. Rhodes was then examined by Mr. JA3ne.-He aid he was a hop merchant in the Borough. He had a private residence in the Brixton-road, and he was a voter for Lambeth. He had made no communication to Mr. Roupell, for which he had not either directly or indirectly any authority from the petitioners or any of their agents. He had never seen any of them upon the subject of the petition. He had been subpcenaed by Mfr. Roupell. About a fortnight ago he had an interview with Mr. Roupell in reference to a railway; it had, however, no connexion whatever with the petition. On cross-examination by Mr. SLADE, Mr. Rhodes saidthat he had acted as chairman at one of Mr. Wilkinson's meetings, and had at first been chairmnan of the princial coraitteee. He was not aware that he knew the parties to the petition personally. He had not subscribed towards defraying the expenses of the petition. He had refused to have anything to do with the petition. On the 15th of April he was present at tho Horns Tavern, when the subject was mooted,but bewithdrew before anythingwas done. He went to the meeting for the purpose of considering whether or not a dinner should be given to Mr. Wilkinson. Mr. Rhodes, at the conclusion of his examination, re9uested permniision to make his exculpatory statement, as =.Boupell had madea statement. The CIHAiRMIAN, however, said the committee were satisfied that Mr. Rhodes had no connexion with the petitioners, and they saw no necessity for hs making any further statement, as it would not bear upon the subject of their inquiry. Whatever Mr. Rhodes had done ws without any authority from the petitioners. Mr. Rhodes.-Decidedly. Mr. Rhodes again urged the committee to allow him to make a statement, but the learned counsel for the sitting member aia they were not desirous to prosecute the matter any further, and the CAAx again intimated that any furthey statement would be irrelevant; the witneas thereupon retired. Mr. Samuel Cross was next examined by Mr. E. JESt. He said that he was employed by Messrs. Harrison to assist in getting up the petition. HEe met MIr. Roupell on Tuesday week in the lobby of the House of Commons. He had not sent in a messago to Mr. RoupelL but he had met Mr. Roupe31 in the messenger's-room. He did not then know Mr. Xoupell, and was introduced tohim by a third person. This third person was talking about the petition, and he (Mr. Cross), wishing to know the truth withrespect to some reports he had heard in reference to Mr. Ronpell and the South London Railway, asked Mr. Roupell what he had to do with that railway. Mr. Roupell then said he was certain that the South London Railway Coinpany was at the bottom of the pstition, and mentioned certan rumours especting it. Mr. Roupell also said that the petition was a stockjobbing affair, and that the petitioners had deusited 1,000., but he would spend 5,0001. to sweat it, and t t his grandfather had spent a large sum of money in law and bcen a gainer by it. Mr. Cross again stated that his meeting with Ar. Roupell was purely accidental, and he had not gone to him with any intention of talking about the petition. He hadno authority to enter into any negotiationrespectiun the petition, but only wanted to know whether Mr. Roupelf in. tended to fight it. On being cross-examined by Mr. SLADE, the witness sad his office was at 20, Great George-street, where one of the offloces of the South London RAilway was situated. He signed the petition on the 29th of May. On the Tuesday when he was at the House of Commonshehad expressedSde. sire to the messenger at the door to see Mr. Roupell, and the messenger had said that he would point himioit. The messenger led him to suppose that he would communicate to Mr. Roupell his desire to see him. Twenty minutes afterwards Mr. Roupell walkedpromiscuously lnt.o the doorkeeper's room. Some one pointed out Mr. Roupell as he went into the room, and hefollowed him. He went to see Mr. Roupell for his own satidaction, to obtain information as to the truth of certain rumours he had heard respecting Mr. Roupell and the South London Railway. He was not connected with the railway, but he had heard that 60 persons belonging to it had been served with the Speaker's warrants. Hle also wanted to know Mr. RouelL (A laugh). Mr. Roupell told him that the South London people were at the bottom of the petition. He replied that that was a great mistake. Mr. Roupell said he had had a communication from other parties, but he did not mention the comnmunication. He named Mr. Rhodes as havlng comrnunicated with him about the withdrawal of the petition. Witness observed that members petitioned against liked to get rid of the petitions. He did not tell Mr. Roupell who he was, nor did he lead him to suppose that he had come from Mr. Harrison, or was connected with the petitioners. He had conversed with Mr. Roupell as an utter stranger. By the CoJnilr3--The person whointroduced him did not mention his name. They were talking about the petition when he went into the room, and the gentleman said, " This is a friend of mine." Mr. Roupell might draw his own condusions as to his position in reference to the petitioners, bat he (witness had not stated it. He might have led Mr. Roupelltobeevo that he could obtain te withdrawal of the petition. By Mr. SLADE.-He thought he had led MIr. Roupell to believe it. He said that two brothers-the Messrs. Harrison -were managing the petition, and that one of them was anxious to get rid of it. He also said that he thought he might use some influence with one of those gentlemen if Mr. Roupcll wanted to get rid of it. Mr. Roupell said that if he consentod he should be so beset in Lambeth that he should not be able to-walk about, orsomethingtothateffect. Witness did not name any terms, but said that one of the Messrs. Harrison would use his influence for the withdrawal of the petition if Mr. Roupell would not press for costs. Mr. SLADE.-Did Mx. ROupell sNy he would see thom d----afirst Witness.-No; he said he had such influence in Lambeth that if ho were turned out he would return a Radical ten times worse than himself. He admitted that Mr. Roupell's refusal was so emphatic that he did not press the matter. Be (witness) was a Parliamentary and election agent. On re-examination he said tbat his conversation with Mr. Roupell had been interrupted. He had no conversa tion with Mess. Harrison in reforence to his interview with Mrx. Roupell. By the CommiTT'r.-He was at the House of Commons on the o0casion in question on other business. His friend told him that Mr. Roupell was a idoe sort of fellow, and he might as well krnowv him.

SLAD: then summed up oi bebalf of the sdtting member, declaring at the outset that ho did not know what he had to answer, as not a scrap of ease had been made out in support of the prayer of the petition. The learned counsel then went through the evidence for the purpose of showing that the election had been properly conducted by Mr. Roupell, and that no illegal or unjustifiable practices had been resorted to in order to obtain the large majority by vhich he had been returned. Mr. Serjeant BALLAMTJXE replied upon the whole case, submitting that a large expenditure, not warranted by the A ct, had been proved to have taken place for the purpose of influencing the voters at the last election, and that the mannIer i;n which the accounts had been rendered on behalf oi M9r.

THE LATE FEARFUL CATAsT1WPHB rEA9 QUBBEO. The evexts in connexion with the burning of the steamw eip Montreal, near Quebec, by which from Z50 to 300 per eons, prinpally emigrts from Scotland, hane perihed, continue to absorb the attention of the citizess, who appear determined to make the moat searching investigation into the cause of the calamity. An inquest had been held and adjourned on twr- occalions, on one of which the jury engaged a steamboat and visited the wreck. The quebeo Morning ChronicTc says:- It is asserted by some that the Montreal was on fire before she left Quebec. A witness, already examined at the nquess, sWears he saw unmistakeable evidence that the beat was on fire while passing SiUlery Cove. A natural inference is dravwn from this that the Alontreal ought to have been rn ashore earlier thail she was, and much indignation is felt among the citizens under the impression that human lfe has been recklesly sacriticed. The steamer Napoleon was the reans of saving 10 eabin and 109 steerage pasengers, and too much credit cannot be given to Captain Cot6, of this boat, for without his assibtance there are few of those tually saved who wouId not have 'erished. The Montreal, it appeals, struck on a ledge of rocks at Point de Dgal, at about80 feetfromtheshore. When she didsothe water was about 6i feet deep, The frantic passengers threw thens selves pronscuously into the water. There was a scor on bowd, which some say was burnt on the deck; others that it vws lowered and swamped. One of the boats of the Mon. treal was lowered by Mr. Hayes, of Montreal It was im. mediately sunk by the pasengers rushing into it. Those who could attempted to swim towards the shore, and of about 50 who succeeded five remained at Caproug, or went on to Quebec. The remainder were taken on board the steamer Napoleon. This steamboat was about balf,a-mlle ahead when the Miontreal was seen in a blaze, steering for the shore. Captain Cot6 reversed the. engines and backed her to the wreck. He despatched two boats and a bateau which was lSing over the rails of his boat. Theywere manned by the mate and purser, and they picked up and conveyed those struggling in the water au on the wreck, first totheshore, and after allhad been rescued on board the Napoleon. Captain Cote could not persuade the foreman, one Cameron, to launchthebateau, so e compelled him to do so, under the threat of pitching him overboard, and this oa2au was the means of saving a large number of persons, The Napoleon lay by the wreck for two hours and a half, and not. a soul was to be. s6en when sheleft The 16 bodies which she took into Montreal were those of persons picked up dead in the water. The conduct of Captain Cvot and his crew, it is gezerally admitted, is deserving of all praise." dmong the persons on board who lost their lives wag the Hon. Stephen C. Phillips, of Salem. The Boston Aidvertier, iu speaking of his death, says :-"HEo had been to Three livers, where one of his sons resldes, and was on his way to Montreal to takethe railroad for home. He wa for rny years an eminent and highly succesfu merobant of Salem, ndtookaprominentpolitical position. Eehad represented Essexsouth district in Congressfrom1834to t838, when he was elected mayor of Salem, which office beheld by successive re-elections until 1842. In 1848 and 1849 he was the candidate of the Free Soil party forthe office of Governor of Massachusetts, but was defeated" A number of the bodies having been taken t6 Montreal, an inquest was abont to be held upon them, but the coroner decided that it was not within his jurisdiction, the accident having occurred and the bodies been picked up in another district. The people on shore are stated to have been too intent upon plunder to render any assistance to those who reached the shore. The special correspondent of the Montred Gaztte says:'Boats manned by crimps and other ruffian were all Saturday, Sunday, and Monday prowling around the wreck, robbing the dead, and carrying off the effects which were found afloat or cast ashore. No man interposed to put a stop to this disgraceful proceeding. Men were seen to draw up dead bodies, plunder their pockets, and drop them again into the river. Bodies brought down on Mondayfrom the wreck reached Quebec with their pockets turned iside out, and the contents gone. A Mr. Ledyard wasseen atthecounterof O'Neill'sflotel, before starting. to put his pocket-book, containing a large amount, into his breast pocket; yet when his body was found not a dollar renmaied. Another young man, who lost his mother, informned me that she had in her bosom a short time before she leaped overboard a small sum of money in Quebec bank bisls When he found her body lying among the dead her dress had been torn open and the money was gone. Ono widow told me her husband had a large amount about his person before his death, but when the body was brought in all was gone. Poor Nlcholson, ayoung manwho had twice gone up to the wreck on foot to seek the body of his father, told me that he had o00 sovereigns about his person. He begged of the people in the boats time after time to take him out with them to the wreck to search for the body, but none would do it." The ifont-caZ Weekly Tuanscript says:-"If the statements of some of our contemporaries be correct, the direness of the calamity is greatly aggravated by its cause. They assert- and many persons likely to know have borne them out-that the boat was always unsafe- that she was pronounced by a party sent to examine her on behalf of a westerm board of underwriters too unsafe to be insured; and that she was run at a most reckless speed; and that so susceptible was she of taking fire, and so constantly were her boilers overheated, that a person hid to be stationed in a putieularpart of the vessel to givethe abnu ande+tinguish the flames." The same correspondent accuses the captain and crew of having consulted their own safety without thinking of that of the passengers, and says that when the former was requested by one of the passengers to run the boat ashore he bade him go to-; that the steamer was not furnished with life preservers - no efforts were made by the officers or crew to preserve order; and that all was panic, disorder, confusion, and madness. Numerous instnces of bravery and heroism are recorded. One of these was the saving ot her two children by Mrs. Broomfield, whose husband is in the employ of the Grand Trunk Company at Toronto. She held to a rope with one hand, keeping1the head of one child above water with tho other, and holding the other up by fastening her teeth in its dress. So heavy as the load that two 4f her teeth gave way and were lost, yet she still retained her hold. At last a boat went towards her, and men were screaming all about her to be taken on board. She could not scream, but a man, seeing her situation, took the boat to her, telling themi she neeaed aid most. Then her strength gave way at the prospect of relief and safety, and she was near drowingbefore she could be lifted into the boat. She is a slight, delicate womnan in appearance. -~ ~ ~~~h

LAW 1REPORT. COURT OF CHANCERY. LIcoLN's-INx. JULY 15. VARDEN V. BOWYER. (Before the LOID CuA?NCELLOB.I This was a part-heard appeal from a decree of ViceChancellor Kindersley, dismi8sing the biU with costs. The object of the suit was to set aside a mortgage executed by the plaintiff in favour of his three sisters for 1,5004. It appeared that the plaintUf became entitled under his fatber's wil to certain real estate of the estimated value of 5,7001., subject to a life interest given to his mother and to the payment of 5001. to his sisters. There was also some per. sonal estate left by the testator, and on the death of the tenant for life tho arrangement now sought to be set aside was entered into by the plaintiff and his sisters, under the professional assistanc of Messrs. Potter and Wood, soli. cibtos, at Manchester. The objection to the transaction urged on behalf of the plaint-if was that he was a very iterate person, and did not understand the purport and effect of the deed. The question turned entirely upon the evidence. Mr. Glasse and Mr. Lewin appeared for the appellant. MIr. BAiLY and Mr. SixersoN supported the decree. The LoRD CiANCELUOR went through the evidence at some length, and said that it was manifest that the plaintiff was indebted to his sisters to some extent, and the impression on his mind was that the claim made by the sisters was a correct one. At any rate, the arrangement was a family one, which this Court would not disturb, unless there was clear evidence that the parties were unaware of their rights. he plaintiff had been brought up to agricultural pursuits, and, although he appeared to have been a dull idle boy, capab1e ot reading and writing but little, there was nothing to show he was not aware of what he was doing when he signed the deed. The solicitors who managed the business had not ventured to say that he was ignorant of his rights, and in all probability nothing would have been heard of the matter had not the plaintiff married and taken the advice of strangers. The Vice-Chancellor had done right in dismissing the bill with costs; and in like manner the appeal would he dismissed, with costs. (Before the LoBD8 JusTicyS of APPxAL) GROSVENOR V. THE HAMPSTEAD JUNCTION RAILWAY * ~~~COMPAN,Y. The bill in this case was filed by Lord L bert Grosvenor, Earl Talbot, Mr. Benjamin Bond Cabbell, and Mr. Donald Fraser, the trustees of the St. Pancras Almshouses Institution, praying for an injunction to restrain the abovenamed Eailway Company from entering upon or interfering with an acre of ground purchased by them for the Governesses' Benevolent Institution, on which is built part of the almshouses, or that, if they are entitled to take any part of the land, they may he decreed to take the whole. The agreemnent to buy the land from the Governesses' Institution was entered into on the 29th of January, 1852, and the trustees bound themEelves to use the acre of land for the purpose of buiding the almshouses and for no other purpose, and the trustees obtained possession from the 2d of February following for that purpose. On the 11th of April the trustees entered into a contract to build the alrnshouses according to the plan. On the 1st of December, 1852, the company gave notice of their intention to apply for an Act, and in August, 1854, the Act received the Royal assent and became law, at which time the almshouses were built sO far as they at present exist, being the centre portion, the plans6showing an intention to erect wings at each end, the extreme ends of the present buildings showing, by the projection of bricks and the recessing in the walls for gratesa tbat a continuation both east and west was intended. On the 16th of August, soon after the Royal assent, the Governesses' Institution executed the conveyance to the trustees, pursuant to the contract, and it was not until the tst of August, 1854, that the company gave notice to the tustees of their intention to take part of the land for the purposes of the railway company. Upon this the trustees, on tne 13th of October, 1854, gave a notice to the company requiring them to take the whole or none. A correspondence ensued, wbich seemed to have extended through May and the rest of 1854, the whole of 1855 and 1856, and to have ended in April, 1857, on the 6th of which month the company gave notice that they intended to take part, and not the whole; whereupon the trusteestgave the comuany notice the next day of an intention to file the bill. It seems that the company proposed to pasS their line within a few inches (36 inches) of the eastern end of the buildings now ereoted, and passing directly over by arch or otherwiso the land upon which the eastern wing of the almshouses Is by the plan intended to be erected and the question is whether the company are by law entitled to take the part they require, instead of taking the whole of the acre of land with the buildings now upon it, the trustees contending that the 92d section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 which requires a company to take the whole of a building applied to this caEe. The company insisted that, as at the time when they gave their notice of an intention to apply for their Act there was no building erected, it was too late for the trustees to inslst upon this objection, they having, with a fuU knowledge of the intentions of the co pany, proceeded to build the centre part of the buildTing; and, further, that the trustees wero not bound by their contract to build the wings until their funds would allow-a state of things which never may arise, and therefore that they were not in a condition to interfere with the company. Vice-Chancellor Wood refused the injunction, on the ground (apparently) that the building as now standing was a complete erection, and therefore not within the Act, and, further, that the remainder of the acre was not sufficiently enclosed to constitute a " curtilage" to the building now finished. Mr. WILLCOCK and Mr. ToRitiANo, for the trustees, supported their appeal from the decision of the Vice-Chancellor. Mr. ROLT and Mr. SPBED, for the company, argued that the deeision of his Honour was perfectly correct, Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUCE said that the argument of the counsel for the comjpany went to this, that the Act of P arliament allowed a railway company to take against an owner's consent a yard or garden belonging to a man's house, without taking the house; and this was contended for as part of the law of a civilized country-in a country professing to be governed bylaw. It was shocking to reason tG see that a country should. be governed by an Act contain. ng the absurdity found in the 92d section. Mr. SPEED, by way of iUustration, said that if the trustees were correct it must be held that if an Act passed t>o make a railway across the Thames, and part of the line would pass over the corner of King's Bonch-walk, the company would be hound to take the whole of the Templo; or, If aline would touch the corner of New-square, Lincoln'sinn, the company wonld be hound to buy the whole of that extensive inn of court. Mr. WILLCOCK was heard in reply, and contended that the illustrations put by Mr. Speed were by no means sufficient to answer the case, for it was clear that if a railway company interfered with the buildings of a coUege, such, for instance, as the common-hail or tho library, the whole must be purchased if the law allowed the property to be interfereo with at all. Lord Ju1stice KNIOrII BRuCE said that the singular manner in which the 92d section of tho Act was drawn had given rise to various questions as to the true meaning of the word "house"-whether it ought to be read in its more limited sense in which it was popularly understood or according to the signification put upon it in legal phraseology. His Lordship thought it would be a gross injustice to deprive a man of his right to read that word in its largest and fuUlest acceptation. All questions arising from the vagueness of the 92d section his Lordship had thought were long ago settled. With the utmost respect to the opinion of Vice-Chancellor Wood,-and no rnan could express more sincerely than his Lordship did his respect for the opinion of that learned judge,-he was of opinion that this railway company were proposing to take part of a house, seeing that they intended to take part of the land, though they did not propose to touch the building. The injunction must be granted. Lord Justice TURNER said that the question in this case arose on the construction of the 92d section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, by which it was enacted " that no party shall at any time be required to sell or convey to the promoters of the undertaking a part only of any house or otherbuilding or manufactory, if such party be willing and able to sell and convey the whole thereof." The argument was that the word " building" in that section interpreted the word "house," so as to confine it to the actual edifiee of the house. His Lordship, however, could not agree with that view. On the contrary, it appeared to himn that the intention of the word was to extend the operation of the Act to buildings connected with manufactories. The only means by which the Act could reasonably bo interpreted was by considering what wasthe legal construction of the word "house" in other instruments. That would depend upon the circumstances of the property. In the present case there was a road, and between the road and the building was an open space; and he qucstion was whether, if this property were described in a conveyance as a " house," this intervening space would pass. His Lordship was of opinion that it would do so, and he was confirmed in this opinion by the fact that it was intended for a garden. If, therefore, this intervening space would pass under the word "house" there was nothing here to consder in the case, except the question whether the conpany intended to tatke a part of this land which was intended for a garden. If, indeed, the pco.pany could maintain that the building was composed of separate tenements, it might be arguable that only that tenement ought to be purchased at the back of which the piece of land taken was situated. Bat it was impossible to contend that the edifice was not all one house. The injunction, therefore, mnust stand. Mr. SP'ED said he supposed the order would bo for the injunction, unless the company should elect to puirchase the whole, of hich intention they would give notice to the trustees.
ROLLS' COURT. RA-NCF.RV-TANVV. .Tnrv WICU V. PARIKER AND OTIIERS. (Before the MASTER of the ROLLS.) as- u ce was resume. triss morning. The object of the suit was to impeach a deed, as being voluntary and fraudulent, and therefore void as against creditors under the statute of Elizabeth. The ease set up by the Bill was that Wiliam Parker, the younger, who was formerly an auctioneer, being early in the year 1S53 in insolvent circumstances, and contemplating arrest, and the necessity of petitioning the Insolvent Court for relief, on the l'Jth of February in tbat year executed a deed of assignment to 1aactilda Parker, his sister, for an alleged consideration of 1301. It was contended that this deed was not only void as being made voluntarily and in contemplation of isolvency, but that the consideration (if any was given) was wholly inadequate to cover the value of the property comprised in it. It appeared that Parker was entitled to a reversionary interest under the marriage settlement of his father %nd mother, and also was possessed of a policy of insurance upon the life of a person named Gye (being, in fact, all the property he had), which he made over to his sister by this deed. In support of the plaintiff's case it was proved thatin January, 1863, William Parker, jun., purchased mrine tons of farina from Mr. Cardinal, a merchant at Rotterdam, as it was alleged under fraudulent representations ae,to his ability to pay for the same. He gave his acceptance for the amount (1661. 8s.), payable at two months' date at the br;.king house of Messrs. Spooner, Attwood, and Co.

Spooner and Co. Ho ultimately filed his petition and scheaule in the Insolvent Court, and after many ad. 'ourninenta for the purpose of producing his sister in court, who was abroad, and refused to oome over for that purpose, Parker was remanded to prison for 14 months. He now disclaimed all interest in the matter in question, and, as it was understood, has lately gone to America. The defendant Matilda Parker by her answer swore that ahe advanced some time before the execution of the deed threa sums of 80L, 201., and 204, and 101. in gold on the execution of the deed; that when she paid the lst sum .he gave up the I 0 U'i which she had taken for the previous advauces, and paid the 104 in gold. Mr. DIamels, her solicitor, who prepared the deed, in his examination stated that he saw some papers handed over, but could not say what they were, and that he did not see any money pass I upon the occasion when the deed was executed. His BoSourn said that the case was surrounded with very grave suspicion, and that his present impreesion was that he could give no credence to the story which had been put forward on the part of the defendant. He would, however take time to read through the evidence before giving a finai decision upon the subject. If he thought these was a fair ground for further inquiry he would direct an issue to be tried, but in any event he would not give William Parker or the defendant Matilda Parker, any costa. The trustees nnder Mr. and Mrs. Parker's marriage settlement, who were blameless parties, would, of course, have their costs. Mr. Iloyd, Q.C., and MIr. llendall appeared for the plaintiff; lr.

The original bill was filed in tho year 1839 for the administration of the estato of Thomas Teague, who was very extensively engaged in mining operations in Corn. walL A decree was made In the suit, and a reference made to Master Lynch, but no report was ever made therein. The supplemental bill was filed by one of the olaisnts under l eague's will against the executors, charging them with devastavit and wilful default, the principal question in the case being whether the plaintiff might not have ob. taiued the relief sought by a common order of revivor, without filing a supplemental bilL Mr. GLAssz, for the plaintiff, offered to read an afridavit made by the defendants in the original suit, consisting of several thousand foLos, and referred to in the defendant's answer - but The 'rIcz-CHANcELLoR said that no notice having been given by the plaintiff of his intention to read this affidavit it cenid not be read, and the cause accordingly stood over to give such notice. Mr. Baily, Mr. Swanston, hlr. Tripp, Mr. Eackett, and Mtr. ENarsiake appeared for the various palrties. (Before Vie-C7zanecior SirW. P. WOOD.) RBE lAWBONE'S BEQUEST. The VICE-CHANCELLoR gave judgment in this case, and said that the petitioner was the assignee in insolvency of one ltawbone, who was entitled to a reversionary interest under the wiiU of his father, made in 1828. The death of the tenant for life, upon which tho reversion was expectant, did not take place until January, 1856. In July, 1841, Rawbone took the benefit of the Insolvent Debtors' Act, and all his property became vested in Sturgis, the assignee In insolvency, who had presented this petition. In 1854 Rawbono became also bankrupt. In December, 1856, the assignee in insolvency for the first time received notice of this reversionary interest, which had been excluded from his schedule by the insolvent, though he was bound to have disclosed it. Neither the assiguees in insolvenoy nor in bank. ruptoy had had any notice of the fund until it was paid ir,to court by the trustees, and the question was vhether it was "within the order and dispoition of the bankrupt, with the consent of the true owner." When the petition was before him in March last he had come to an erroneous conclusion, baving held that this reversionary interest was not 'within the order and disposition clause; so that the petitioner was entitled as against the assignees in bankruptcy. The point had been dince decided by the Lords Justices in " Bartlett 7. Bartlett" (5, Weekly Reporter, 541), which had occasioned the matter to be again argued before him. Admittiig that this reversionary interest was within the order and disposition of the bankrupt, was it so with " the consent of the true owner," the assignee in insolvency ? If any lackes could be predicated on the part of the assIgnee in insolvency, he 8hould at once follow those authorities which established that laches amounted to consent by bim. Could any course be suggested by which he could possibly have come to the knowledge of this property ? He was unable to see any. The property hadbeenfraudulentlyexcludedfromhis schedulebyRawbone, and, asthe assigneeneither knew norhadanymeans of knowing of its existence, it could not be held that he had given his consent. The order, therefore, made upon the former occasion, giving the fund to the peUtioner, 3r. Sturgis, would remain undisturbed. Mr. Osborne, Mr. Cracknall, and Mr. Waller appeared upon the petition. RE STmOTHER. The VICE-CHANCELLOB gave judgment in this case also, which was a petition for the taxation of a solicitor's bill for the costs of obtaining an Act of Parliament more than a year after the bill had been delivered. After 12 months (his Honour said) there could be no order for taxation except upon special circumstances, and as to their existence the whole contest turned. He had had considerable doubt upon the case after the delay which had occurred, but at the same time there were items challenged in the bill as to which no satisfactory explanstion could be given. Without imputing any intentional fraud to the solicitor, there was so gross an amount of overcharge as to render it im Possible that the bill could be allowed to remain untxed. The bill was sent in in January, 1856, and the petitioners had at finst complained of the charges, in answer to which they had been told by the solicitor that their complaint arose wholly from their ignorance of Parliamentary proceedings and practice. With respect to special circumstances it was not necessary that overtharge and pressure should be combined. this case therelhad een aholoding by on bbth aides from i March, 1856, and no demand by the solicitor upon the peti- I tioners until after the period for obtainingtaxation. Twelve months had elapsed. Under the circumstances he should make the order putting the petitioners on the terms of paying interest upon the amount. THE LEOi5NSTER CANAL NAVIGATION COMrANY V. THE SHRWVSBUIcY AND HEREFORD RAILWAY COMPANY. The arguments in this suit, which, as already stated in TCe ti2eS of Tuesday last, is for the specifio performance of a contract by the railway company to purchase the canal from the plaintiffs, were resumed. Mr. ROLT and Mr. GIrFARD, on behalf of the defendants, contended that no agreement could be treated as binding upon a company unless every requisite prescribed by tho Act of Incorporation had been complied with. Here there had been nothing to amount to part performance; the agreement was merely by parol, and the railway company could not contract except in pursuance of the machinery given for that purpoee, which had not been complied with in this case, there being no contract under the corporate seal or under the hand of two directors. Air. DANssL (with whom wero Mr. Dickinson and Mr. Stallard) was heard in reply. The VICE-CII&NCELLor, said that he must reserve his judgment; at the same time the difficulty might be at once put an end to if any two members of the direction were honest enough to give effect tothe contract by affixingtheir signatures to it.

SUMMEB ASSIZES. TIOMP F. TR.t.TTv'I CHELMSFORD. JULY 15. CROWN Smic-(Beforc the LORD CmFx BARoN.) Charles Finch, 26, a sullen, determined looking young man, was charged with the wilful murder of Harrlet Freeborn bycutting her throat at the parish of Rivenhall, on the Mr. Prentice and Mr. Bramston conducted the prosecution; the prisoner was defended by Mr. Woollett. It appeared from the statement of the learned counsel for the prosecution, and the evidence adducedto support it, that theprisoner wasa labouring man, belongingto Rivenhall, and that during the Russian war he entered the Land Tran=ort Corps, and was employed in the Crimea, and returned fomu thence about a year and awhalf ago. The deceased was a respectable young woman belonging to Kelvedon, but a few days before the 24th of M1ay, which was a Sunday, she had been in the service of a farmer named Upson at RivenhalL The prisoner and the deceased had been what is termed keepmg company together, both before and after the prisoner had been to the Crimea, but it would seem that shortly before the fatal occurrence he entertained the impression, for which, however, there did not appear to b L the slightest foundation, that during his absence the deceased had received attentions from another man, and he was repeatedly heard to declare that he would do her some injury. They were walking togetherouthe 19th of May, and the prisoner a day or two afterwards told one of thewitnesses that he had a razor in his pocket at that time, and that he wvs jealous of her in consequence of her having been intimate with some young man In London, and that he would do for her the first opportunity that offered itself. On the following afternoon the unfortunate young woman left her master's house about 3 o'clock for the purpose of going to church, and just as she arrived at a stile in a field near the town the prisoner suddenly jumped over the stile, and, without saying a word, he inflicted a wound on her throat with a razor. He then went away a short distance, and returned and gave her another wound in the throat, and, subsequently, a third, one of them severing the windpipe, and being of a very dangerous character. The deceased contrived to make her way to her master's house, where Mr. Tompkins, a surgeon, of itham, promptly attended, and dressed the wounds, and for some time there appearedaprospect of herrecovery, but on the 26th of June she became worse and died on that day, and upon a post mortcm examination it was discovered that the injuries the deceased had received had caused extensive inflammation of the windpipe, and that this was the cause of death. The prisoner was taken into custody sitting in a ditch near the spot where the dreadful deed had been committed, and his jacket and cap, covered with blood, were found near him, and a razor, which was the instrument he had made use of, was picked up close by him. He appeared to make no secret of hishaving committed the crime, and was originally committed to take his trial for wounding with intent to murder, but upon the event of the death of the deceased subee. quently taking place the coroner's jury returned a verdict of wiful murder against the prisoner, and he was now tried upon that inquisition. Medley, one of the Essex constabulary, who took charge of the prisoner, proved eome of the above facts, and he also stated that on the following day, while the prisoner was confined in the Witham police-station, he sent for him to his cell, and when he went in to him he said, "That - girl has been the ruin of me. I got hold of her, and gave hera cut with the razor, and she said, 'Don't do that Charles you know I love you.' She then asked me to kiss her, and'I cut her again, and then went away, and abe said I was a blackguard, and I went back and cut her again " The witness said that he saw the prisoner again on the 3ith of May, and he exclaimed, "Fifteen years' transportation, or life I" The prisoner then inquired if she was alive, And he told him she was, and he said, "I don't care a---I wish I had killed the -, and then I should have known what I had got to stand to. Upon being cross-examined by Mr. WooLL=T the witness said that the prisoner was swinging his arms about and appeared excited whenhe made these observations. He had known the prisoner for some time, and remembered his coming baok from the Crimea, but he had never heard that he had had an attack of brain fever or that his mind was in any way affected. The stAteM3it made by the unfortunate young woman shortly before her death was then put In. It was as follows: -"I live at Kelvedon, but on the 24th of May I was in the service of Mr. Upson, a farmer at RivenhalL On Sunday afternoon I went from my master's house with the intention of going to church, and was crossing a field and bad got to the stile. When I got to the stile Charles Finch came over the stile and cut me with a razor, and at the same time said, ' You are a dead woman; I will be hung for you.' I said, 'You blackguard -' and he came to me and cut me twice more. He came suddenly upon me at first, and I sid, You made me jump.' He said, 'Wh7' and I replied, 'Because I was making haste-to church. Mr. WOOLLrTT made an earnest appeal to the jury on behalf of the risoner; and he said he was instructed that while in the brmmea he had suffered a severe attack of brain fever, which had affected his intellect, and he endeavoured to show that he was not responsible, on account of the state of his mind, for the act he had committed. He called no witnesses for the prisoner. The Lord Cxsp BARox, in summing up, said that if there had been any foundation for the suggestion made on behalf of the prisoner it should have been established by evidence, and if any application had been made to him to postpone the trial to procure testimony of that description he should have granted it; but the jury must deal with the csEe as it stood, and they would very much neglect their duty if they acted upon any surmise, or were indnoed to come to the conclusion that the prisoner was not criminaUy responsible for the act he had committed, in the absence of all evidence to support such a sug stion. The jury retire, and in about ro minutes they returned into court, and gave a verdict of Guily. The LoRD C3Fxr BAnoN then put on the black cap, and proceeded to.pass sentence of doat inth te usual form upon the prisoner, at the same time telling him that his crime was of such a nature that his fate was inevitable, and that he must expect no mercy in this world. The prisoner, who did not betray the least emotion, either during the trial or when sentence of death was pronounced, was then removed from the bar.
NORFOLT aTR.m7Tm AYLESBURY. TuEsDA.Y. JMIT 14. Iur. Justice Willtims opened the commission for the county of Bucke yesterday. and this morning Lord Campbell arrived from London at 10 o'clock, when both the courts were opened for the despatoh of business. On the civil aide there is one special and one common jury cause. On the Crown side the calendar contains the names of 14 prlsoners, and embraces one charge of murder, one of arson, one of forgery, one of highway robbery, four of burglary, twoof false pretences, one of larceny, and one of wilfully obstructing a railway train. CxRowN COUnT.-(Beforc Lord CAmPBZLL) Charles Doggrell, aged 27, and Edward Birch, aged 33, 'were indicted for a burglary at the residence of Wr. Mitchell, the lessee of the St. James's Theatre; on the 5th of May. Mr. Payne was counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Metcalfe defended the prisoners. Mr. Mlitchell owns a house at Iver, but is seldom in residence. However, on the 4th of May he went to enjoy his otium cam dignikte'at Iver, and retired to rest at the usial hour. In the dead of night his man-servant was disturbed by footsteps below, and, stealing to the top of the staircase in his nightshirt, beard two men walking about the hall and drawing-room. He at once ecalled out," Who's there 1" and received for answer, "Who's that, you- ? Lay down, or we'll blow your brains out." The vaiant butler, nothing daunted, rejoined, "Will you? Ill soon be down upon you," and re ired to his bedroom, where hung a Prodigious old sword. Irawing this weapon from its rusty sheath, tho butler sallied down to the lower floor, where he made such good use of his voice and weapon that the burglars beat a sudden retreat through the window by which they had entered,but not before theyhad coDeeted a few valuables from the drawing-room. Early next morning a constable fell in with the two prisoners, in whose possession most of Mr. Mitchell's property was found, besides which awkward fact the butler identified one of them by his voice. Mr. METOALFE having waived his address to the Ju The CErF JUSTICE commended the learned counsei for his judgment and discretion, as the case was too clear to admit of argument, and when that was the case it was the duty of counsel to abetain from attempting impossibilities. The jury having at once found the prisoners Guilty, they were both sentenced to five years' penal servitude. James IRanter, aged 32, was indicted for maliciously firing certain furze growing on Hudwell-common, in the parh of Eddlesborough, the property of the Earl of Powis, the sole acting trustee under the will of the late Earl of Bridgewater. Mr. Mills conducted the case for the prosecution. The risoner, who is an Irish tramp, called at the house of a tarmeron the 17th of June last, and asked for relief, and being met by a refusal he was afterwards seen to go into the high furze growing close to the homesteadi and deliberately to set fnre to it in two places, after which he made off. Two labourers, who had witnessed the transaction, pursued and overtook him, and when one remarked that it was a mercy he had not set fire to the stacks and all the placohe replied with an oath, "That's just what I meant to do. I should like to burn the - to a cinder." The Jury found the prisoner GuiUy, and he was thereupon sentenced to three years' penal servitude. Caroline Marson, aged 44, was indicted for the wilful murder of the female child of her daughter Emma Marson, at Olney, on the 13th of December last. Mr. Power conducted the case for the prosecution; Mr. Dasent, at the humane request of thelearned Chief Justice, watched the case for the defence. The prisoner lives at Olney, where also reside under her roof her daughter Emma, aged 20, and her son William, aged 16, all of whom occupied the same bedroom, together with an illegitimate child of Emma, aged three years. On the night of the 13th of December William Marson was disturbed by the faint cry of a newly-born baby, and, opening his eyes, saw his mother standing with a light near his sister's bed, the curtains of which were drawn. Immediately after his mother came to his bedside and moved the light across his eyes, as if to satisfy herself whether he was asleep. The boy closed his4eyes during the examination, and then his mother returned to the other bed, saying " He's fast asleep." In about 10 minutes the boy fel aslee again, and next day he noticed that his sister was not abou as uaL In a few days he talked about the occurrences of the night, and after a few months his sister made a statement that shehadbeen delivered of a girl on the night of the 13th of December, and that her mother had taken the child away, and had told her she had tbrown the body into the prily of an inn where she worked. This placo was searched, aud in it was found the body of a full-grown female child wrapped in a shawl, and in a state of incipient putrefiction. The body was taken to a surgeon, who pronounced thatthe child had been[born alive, and had died of suffocation or exhaustion produced by loss of blood, caused by, a lacerated wound in the neck, which had severod the jugular vein, and might have been produced by some blunt matrument, and during life. Upon this the prisoner was taken into oustody, ad then ohe stated that, though guilty of concealing the birth of her daughter's child, she was Lnnocent of its death. The prisoner then went on in natal and unaffected terms to give a narrative of the ooourrenoes of that night, stating that when she received the child from its mother it was motionless, and that after she had kept It for three or four days she had disposed of it where it had been found. Lord CAuPBELL, in sunnminup this distreseing and mys.. terious case to the jur, dwelut much on the appearanoe of truthpresemnted by the prisoner's narrative, ana echoed the argument of the earned consel whom he had requested to defend her, that there wasnot any evidence whatever to i- icatetheprisonc in this dreadful offence, but that,of ne1rdaughter,wlhom it was impossibletoGviewtinany other light than that of an accomplice, if there was any gilt attributable to the prisoner. On the whole, his LordVsbip thought the evidence was not of so satisfactory a nature as to warrant a verdict of guilty; but if the jury should come to the conclusion that the child camne by its death in consequence of injury wilfully inflicted by the prisoner it would then be their duty to oonvict her. The jury deliberated for 10 minutesw and then returned a verdict of Not Guilty. WNE PRIus Coura. BIROWN V. COLLIER. Mr. Power and Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. O'Mlley and Mr. Keane were counsel for the defendanlt. This wasanaction of ejectment to recover a small piece of land bituate on Backland.common. It appe,_ed that in 1843 the Enclosure Comnissioners for the parish eold the lsnd in question to Leonard Brown, the son of the plain. tiff, who advanced money from time to time till his son owed him 401. in 1853, when a mortgage was executed at,the office of a respectable solicitor, who took the instructions from the original conveyancer to Ieonard Brown. The plaintiff was then tenant of his son at 2L per annum, and aftr his son quitted Buckland the plaintiff oddly enough attorned to the defendant as his landlord and the owner of the field in question under a purchase from his son subsequent to his own mortgage. So matters rested till the plaintif's horse trespassed on this land, and a lawsuit eneued between the plaintiff and the defendant. During the course of this litigation the old man, who was re sented as "an innocent fellow." awoke to the fact thaf he had been paying rent to the defendant while he was, in fact, the owner of the land, and on inquiry it turned out that Leonardhad stolen the writingafromhis mother andhad sold the landto theplaintiff in spite of themortgage. Theplintiff then was advised to bring this action, the defence to which was that he had lent himself to his son in getting up a fraudulent mortgage to save his propertyfrom his creditors, and that the object having been attained the son had afterwards sold the property to the defendant, after which he had committed suicide. the learned JUDG left it to the jury to say whether they thought the mortgage to the plaintiff w as a abond f one or a sham, as suggested by the defendant. the jury found for the plaintiff, thus affirming his mort- (Before a Spcial JTury.)

NORTERRx (ITDcqTTp YORK. JULY 14. CROWN COURT.-(Before Mrr. Baron C AIxLL4 Richard Stead Was indicted for forging and nttering a certificate of his character with intent to deceive Bernard Granville La rd, and obtain thereby an appointment in the East Riding consabulary at Beverley, on the 18th of lJr. Thompson and Mr. Newton prosecuted, and Mr. MIliddleton defended the prisoner. It appeared that in consequence of the appointment of a county polico force in Yorkshire at the close of last year it was determined by the magistrates of the East Ridin to apinta lice force of 60 men, at the head of whom MJaor Iayaxwa3 appointed, and with him rested the selection of the police force. The prisoner applied for one of the appointments to Major layard by letter from York, representing that he had formerly been in the service of Admiral Parker, of Swillington-park, and had afterwards been elght months in the Liverpool po]ice force. In support of this application he enclosed a recommendation purportingto be written by " W. Oldham," by direetion of he head of that force, and stating his character to be good. In consecuence Major Layard appointed him as one of the constables of the East R'dint nlice force. Afterwards receiving come information t at the prisoner had not been in either situation he caused inquiries to be made, wvhich showed the written characters which had been sent on his behalf to be forgeries. It was proved that therewansno such person as "W. Oldham" in the lverpool force, and that the written character was a forgery. The learned counsel for the defence having addressed the ! os LORDsar summed up, and The jury foud the prisoner Guilt.y. Hlis LodsEp said the offence he had committed was one calculated to produce most injurious effects if not sopped, and he should consdder what sentence he ahould pa- Isac Rushforth, aged 42, and who is marked In the calendar as reading imperfectly, was indicted for feloniously administering a quantity of seeds of paradise to Kitty Littlewood, with mntent to procure abortion, at East Arsey, on the 2d of February last. Mr. Shaw prosecuted, and Mr. Middleton defended the prisoner. From the opening statement of the learned counsel and from the evidence of the prosecutrix, a sallow, ill-favoured looking young woman, of 26 years of age, it appeared that at thematter end of last year she resided with her father at Sheffield, and the prisoner lived in the Dewsbury-road, Leeds. rhe prisoner, it appeared, had got a reputation as a wizard, and the prosecutrix having been unwell for a considerable time, and the doctors she employed doing her no ood, acting on the advice of a neighbour, she went with her father to Leeds to consult the prisoner. The prisoner, as the prosecutrix described it, "ruled her planet and gave her some pills." Not imuroving under his treatment, she sent for him to Sheffield, and the prisoner then told her she would never prosper unless she went to live at West Ardsley-a place near Leeds, and easily accessible. She and her father accordingly went to live at West Ardsley, and there the prisoner frequently saw her. At firsthe gave her some medicine, which he said was for palpitation of the heart. He then told her she would never be wel unless she suffered him to have connexion with her. This she refused several times. She afterwards removed to East Ardsley, and the prisoner continued to attend her, and at length she permitted him to have an improper intercourse with her, on his representation that she would never get well unless she did. On one occasion he gave her something which stupefied her, and it was on that occasion that the intercourse commenced, and it was afterwards continned for some time. At length she became in the familyway, and the prisoner then brought her a quantity of seeds of paradise, and told her to make tea of it, and drink it. She did so, and had a miEcarriage on the 26th of March. On another occasion after that the prisoner brought her a bullock's heart and some shoemaker's awls. He burnt the heartand said the awls were to keep her enemies off. She was to place them under her pillow and wear them in her pocket. He also sent her two pieces of parchment as charms, and said one would get her a young man and the other was to prevent her being bewitched. She gave him l. for these, On cross-exammation it appeared she had had a child six years ago, and that the prisoner had given up visiting her before she preferred this charge. The inspector of police who took the prisoner inte custody found a great number of fortune-telling books at his house, and books relatin to "ruling the planets." Onbeingtakeninto custody he said he had ruled the prosecutrix's planet and found she was bewitched; he ruled it a second time, and thought she was not. He found her illness arose from want of a man, and had told her so, and then had intercourse with her, which she permitted. It was proved that the adminiistration of an infusion of seeds of paradise was likely to be very injurious to a pregnant woman, and to procure abortion. The learned counsel for the prisoner objected that there was no proof of the administering of the drug by the prisoner. His LORDSuP overruled this objection, and, The learned counsel having addressed the jury for the defence, Bis LORmsnn sLmzmed up, and The jury found the prisoner Guilty. His LoRDsmn said it was quite lamentable to think that such an amount of ignorance should prevail. The prisoner had availed himself of the ignorance of the prosecutrix to seduceher, and afterwards, to save her from a certain amount of exposure, but also to save himself, he had caused her to take a noxious drug calculated to procure abortion.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Is there no member of the Home or Indian Government sharpwitted enough to perceive that what are wanted for the transport of troops to India in the present fearful emergency are sailing vessels that can steam, and not steamers that cannotsail? Itistoencountercalmsandlightand head wind3 that steam power is requisite, and snrely no class of vessels can be so well adapted for this purpose as our screw frigates. If they cannot be made available in this our hour of dire necessity, in Heaven'sname, Sir, w4en are we to depend on them? I should like to ask Lord Palmerston, who tells the House of Commons "the Government feel no alarm," what he does feel a subject of alarm. Is it because Lord Canning reports that the Government-house at Calcutta in not likely to be sacked, and that Delhi will, in all probability, be wrested from the mutineera with or without the aid of "siege train," that the Government "feel no alarm ." Does the Premier know that there are hundreds of out-stations where the civil authorities are carrying on their duties in the midst, perhaps, of a a disaffected population, and depending solely for| protection, 'ith their familiea and dependents, on a small guard of Sepoya (probably detached from some mutinous regiment), and who are exposed to murder, violation, and pillago unless instant and imme- 'iate measures are taken to re-establish our moral power by the rapid reinforcement of our physical resources? Has the Government been asked when, underthe most favourable circumstances, they expect these reinforcements of troops to reach the scene of peril and disaster, and, with reference to the present alarming outbreak, what will probably be the state of things when they do arrve? I, Sir, am no alarmist, but I only repeat that our position is one of great possible peril, and that no measures can be too prompt, no expense too great, no exertions too energetic, to avertwhat may prove to be, despite poor General Anson and his siege train, despite all the experience and gallantry of his successor, General Grant, and of his supersessor, General Campbell, and of his successor, whoever he may be, the most frightful calamity of the age in which we live, the moat damaging blow to the power and greatness of England. May I be permitted to add that many years' experience of the feeling and character of the Madras army, and some knowledge of that of Bombay, lead me to feel sanguine that their fidelity and loyalty will remain (as a body) intact and unimpeachable, but that no one knows the extent and ramifications of this conspiracy T May Heaven grant us in our leaders strong minds and stout hearts to meet the danger !

MEH NIGHT-HOUSS OF LONDON. TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES; Sir,-Nolwthat we enjoy a ahort respite from the sadow of those long coming events, Mr. Hardy's Bill and the comet, perhaps you will allow one whose occasions of obser. vation are but too frequent to say a word in anticipation of the contemplated Goverment measure for remodelling our licensing system. * It is to be regretted that a question of such vast social importanoe should bo placed in abeyance by our besetting national sins of self.interest and faction, which do more to obstruct the progress of measures Of public utilty hin desPOtism itself, as the public works of France, under the Iron rule of Louis Napoleon, abundantly prove; and never, surely, was the blindness of party zeal more strikingly exemplified than in the all but universal misapprehenion which prevails upon the subject. By some mysterious process of ratiocination it is aesumed and granted that the pub. lichouse is *l that is respectable and orderly and the beer shop all that is low and disreputable. Thia is not only not true, but in numberless instances the reverse of the truth, and ifthe deputation of magnates who so dogmatically took their stand upon their country experiences in their interview with Sir George Grey the other day will venture upon a tour of observation a la Haroun Airsechid and the Lord Mayor of London, they will find scenes disgraceful not only to a Christian communitybut to human natureenad In and about publichouses hours after the humble beershop has beoome dark and silent. I am not going to vouch for the respectability of the frequenters of the latter class of houses, but they are at least obliged to turnout ata iepectable hour; and here I must take the liberty of correcting the assumption of your correspondent " A Thirsty Soul" that "the beershop keeper is required to closehis house every night at0.30." The time of closing is not the same in ailparts of themetropolis,and, so far asI can speak from my own personal knowvledge, the earliest is l o'clock, while in some districta they &re allowed to keep open until 12 o'dock. u al, however, punctuality is enforced under a penaltY which, apart from the worry of, mind, few would care to risk for a matter of half-an-Jour's profits, while the publican may keep his house 6pen, as many of them do, all night long, Saturday and Sunday excepted, and it is worthy of obeerva. tion, and of recollection too, that those nights when the working classes-who are, sad to say, the drinking clases also-have most leisure and money are nights comparatively of decorum mnd quiet in the neighbourhood cursed by such houwses. The respectability of ahouse-depends not-so nuch upon the scale of its accommodation or the character of its frequenters as on the time of closing. An houses of entertainment or amusemeutkept open beyond the general timeof closing are necessarily disorderly and a nuisance to their respeetive nelghbourboods, the clans of persons then sirring, with the exception of a few jackmsses in broad cloth and gold neck-chains, w'ho have left all the little sense they posEessed in the publichouse now closed over the way, and those, still fewer, who are belated by accident or necessity, being a simple mixture of thieves and prostitutes, and what. ever else there is of vile and detestablo in low London life. For the accommodation of such characters it is that we find publchouses and pleshops staring open at 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, and coffeehouses at all hours, thus becoming so many centres of profligacy and dismal woehumour; and the fewer they are in number the lager the circle they take in of this night-walking rabble-rout. To Include pieshops and coffeehouses, particularly the latter, In this indictment may seem a far-fetched idoa, and many who have considered the matter crudely and superfIcially have prejudged Hr. Hardy's Bill, of whicb I am by no means an advocate, as one of Alcohol versus Coffee. Those persons are evidently not in the habit of perambulating the streets of London between midnight and gray mornlng, or they would not require to bq told that a coffeehouse open must be a greater evi than a publichouso closed. It is quite true that a well. conducted coffeehouse, with its newspapers and periodicals, and "' cup that cheers but not inebriates," Ia, to a certain extent, a counter-charm to the gin palace and beershop, and as such deserves, Instead of the surveillance of the police, the countenance of every lover of order, but the night-houses are by no means of this innocuous charse ter, and in dealing with them it may be found necessary to curtail tbeimmunities of the general body. Whether those night-housee are the cause or the effect of the nebulae of nastiness which surround them might be a question of some difficulty, were it not for the fact that they are to be found with all their marks in the most aristocratic neighbour. hoods. It requires, however, no great force of ugument to prove-what, in fact, any person wMlling to undertake a night's adventures pro bono puUico can prove for himselfthat they are the resort and a very convenient cover for the thieves of their respective neighbourhoods, and of other neighbourhoods too, affording them not only a sanctuary where they can laugh to scorn the utmost vigilance of the police, but a ready excuse when found by the latter under circumstances of time and place which otherwise they would find it rather difficult to account for. Here it is that the chldren of the slums are initiated into the mysteries of crime; that the youtb, hesitating, perhaps, Qlweenthe infinenoe of a fond mother an4.tbe example of a bad father, is dragged into the vortex by the proficient in, iniquity-the centres these from which graduates of both sexes choosetheir different walks in crinallife, all leading, alas, to the ame point. But those dens of low abandonment are not frequenied by thieves only; the early victim of parental neglect, or worse, has to pass through a probationary courso of com panionship before he is aditted into the fmternity. rt youthful profligate, old in depravity, whomyou see swagger. ing arm-in-arm with a filthy prostitute In the stream of warm light which the open door throws across the pave. ment, is the son of a man who eats his crust daily in the sweat of his brow, whie his hard earnings go to the ginshop and his clothes to the pawnbroker's to supply the unnatural cravings of the drunken wife and mother; and a visit to the interior will show us the children of the worldng and thieving classes wallowing together in the same foul sink of debauchery. It is a sad sight this-one more disheartening to the Christian andthe philanthropist than even the masses of outcast pauperism which grovel on the damp litter within or shiver on the cold pavement without our work. houses-a sight which makes a right-thinking man almost wish for despotism itself as a means of cutting away those moral cancers from our social system. A plain and simpleway of dealing with theevil-tooplain and simple, and, perhapstoolittle financial to be entertained by the collective wisdom-would be to license all houses of entertainment and amusement of whatever sort open after a certain hour at night, say 10 o'clock, exempting all such, and such only, as closed at or before that hour. This would be at once an encouragement to the latter, and a gua. rautee for the good behaviour of the former; and in a Christian country, perhaps, its tendency to the elevation of the public morals, even at the expense of the revenue, might be a further recommendation; such, however, is our maudlin respect for what we call the rights of individuals-6 even the right to do wrong-that I am doubtful if we shall ever get beyond the good intentions of the Legislature. Of what use will it be to extend a power which, to its present extent, is little better than a mockery in our hands-to make the coffeehouses amenable to an Act which we aluow the publichouses to run a coach-and-six through ? It is true that comparatively few of the latter are what is caled "night" houses; but why should there be one?-why, with the power of prevention which our licensing system gives us, allow a single house to remain open after 12 o'clock? To pass laws without enforcing them is to bring the Legislature and the Executive together into contempt, and if our licensing system have any intention beyond that of adding to the revenue, that Intention is defeated by allowing the publican a discretionary latitude in addition to his license. The law makes no difference between the receiver of stolen property and the thief, and I see no reason why any immunity should be accorded to houses open for the reception of thieves and their victims when the respectable portion of the community are in their beds, and, I was going to say, asleep, but it is notso easy to sleep amid a pandemonium of drunken uproar and beastly riot, to say nothing Of the tortaring thought of the impres. sible minds of our children being familiarized from their earliest development with its diabolical orgies. Are those places reported by the police? and, if so, whose fault is it that such a moral pestilence, outraging public decency and order, remains unchecked? The responsibility, s0 far as the police are ooncerned, rests with the higher officers. All the consable on the beat can do is to report to his sergeant or inspector, who, unless they walk about with their eyes shut, must be, in nine cases out of ten, as well acquainted with the fact as he is himself. There is evidently a gross neglect of duty somewhere, and itis high time to put an end to a stato of things which is fast reducing us below the level of European civilization. A FOLECEVAN. THE CALDONI&W O(ANAL.-The 52d report on this canal, published yesterday, states thereceipts during the year ended the lst of May, 1857, to have been 5,4081., and tho expenditure 6,1521., leaving a deficit of about 7441. Although the trade with Russia has nownearly recovered its position prior to thewar, the extreme prevalence of easterly inds durlngthelast aintheprecedfngyearhasoperated, by facilitating the north-about passage westwards, to diminish the resort of foreign vessels and the larger class of traders to the canal, as well as the relative proportion of steam towage to the general amount of traffic.

XPRAVIXIAN AND RIFVBR PLATE MAILS. SOUTHAMPTON, WjDNSDAY.' the Royal Manl Company's steamship Medway, Captain J. G. Parker, arived at 6 p.m. to-day, with the Bra2ilian, und River Plte mails, in charge'of Lieutenant Payne, R.N., AdmiraTtyagenh Her dates are,-Buenos Ayres, June 2; Ilontevid, 5; Rio de Janeiro, 14; Bahia, 19; Pernambuco, 22; St.. Vincent (Cape Verdes), July 1; Teneriffe, 6; Msdeir 8; Lisbon, UL She landed 55 pussengers at 7isbou, and brings 116 to Southampton. Op. freight she has specie from Teneriffe value 6001., daimonds value O0,300.; and a cargo consisting of 230 barrels of tapioca, liS1 bags of cocoa, 779 bas of coffee, 217 bales of tobacco, and 73 bale3 of cochineal. The Anglo-Brarilian Bank was the object of great attention on the part of the Imperial Government. Several propoeals had been made by other parties. The AngloBrazilian Bank was started by Mr. G. S. Brandon, sUpported by inflteatial persons ia London, who have guaranteed the capital to the Government, and it is said that the charter wiU be obtained this month-capital one million, with power to increase, to issue their own notes. The money-market had been very tight; discounts at 12 per cent., and no gold in the market. This bank proposed to supply the deficiency. From Rio there is nothing new in politics. The new tariff would come into operation on the 1st of July. The G}overnment, it was understood, were disposed to make ome modifications in it, but no one knew what they would be. The coffee-market reopened on the 9%h ult., at a decline of 103 reis to 200 reis as oompared with rates quoted on the 13th of May. About 101,000 bags had subsequently been sold; in aU 145,000 bags since the last steamer, of which 69,000 were for the United States, 71,000 for the Channel and North of Europe, and 5,000 for the Mediterranean. Sugar, white, was quoted at 4 800 to 5 400 ; and brown, 3-600 to 4 000. Hides were wanting; only 360 very ordinary ones in stock. Exchange on London ruled at 27id. to 28d., the bulk of the business having been done at the formarrate; Hamburg, 650; Paris, 343 to 345. Discount continued without alteration. Freights remained dull, and the few charters effected were at 35s. for the Elbe, 35s. to 45s. for the Channel, and 50c. to 70c. for the United States. From the Bahia Price Current of the 18th of Juno we learn that in import articles no transactiona of importance had taken place. Of codfish there were no arrivals, and stocks were rapidly diminishing, amounting only to about 300 barrels. In export articles great dulness prevailed in the beginning of the week, owing to the expected arrival of the Petropolis steamer; with the exception of a sale of leaf tobacco, which was said to have been effected at 5-W00 per arroba for closed leaf seconds, and 6-500 for firsts, no transactions of importance were effected. After the steamer's arrival the sugar-market again partly regained its former activity, and considerable lists of whites changod hands at 4-600 per arroba. Cotton and coffee continued neglected, and prices of hides and rum remained unaltered. In other articles no altera. iion. In freights a vessel was chartered for the Channel at 45sa. per ton. Exchange transactions have been effected at 28d. 90 days' sight, and 270id. 60 days' sight. Our correspondent at Pernambuco writes On the 22d of June as follows: " Our sugar-market continues active, andin spite of the heavy rains entries have been fair,-say since the 1st of the month 25,000 bags. We estimate the stocks for sale and shipment at about 80,000 bags.

The weather was very fine, and officers and men seemed in the highest spirits. The Calabar, which is to take the third portion of the 88th, arrived at Spithead from London yesterday, goes into Portsmouth harbour to-day, and will embark her troopsato-morrow, and sail on Saturday. The last portion will embark on the 22d in the Cambodia, which was hourly expected at Portsmouth when this report left. All other ships ordered to embark troops at Portsmouth are to be towed from the Thames to that port to save time and insure punctualty in their despatch. Owing to the large number of trooDS proceeding from Chatham to India, for the purpose of joining'the headquarters of their respective regiments in Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, the depOt companies of the Indian regiments at that garrison have been reduced far below their required strength. An order was accordingly received at Chatham yesterday, dircoting that recruiting parties are to proceed immediately to various stations for the purpose of enlisting men for the following regiments now serving in India, viz.: -10th Foot, 24th, 29th, 32d, 52d (Light Infantry), 60th (Royal Rifles), 3d battalion, 61st, 74th (Highlanders), 78th (Highlanders), 81st, 86th, and 87th (Royal Irish Fusileers) Regiments. Nearly 3,000 of the most efficient troops have been given by the depOts at Chatham to the regiments now in India. On Tuesday three officers and 176 rank and file of the 60th Rides arrived at Dublin by the steamer Timora, from Jersey. After disembarking the troops formed on the quay, and proceeded to the Richmond Barracks, where they will remain untilthe arrival of the transport at Kingstown which is to convey them, with other troops, to India. The following letter, dated from Her Majesty's sloop Cyclops, St. John's, Newfoundland, July 1, gives some interesting. particulars respecting the survey of the course for the Atlantic telegraph cable:- " As the opening a communication between Ireland and Newfoundland by submarine telegraph is inow occupying a considerable amount of publio attention, a few paWticulars of the proceedings of Her Majesty's steam sloop Cyclops, Lieutenant D&yman, appointed to survey the course for the bed of the cable, may not be unacceptable. She has within the last three weeks determined the depths of the ocean on the exact line on which it is Proposed to lay the cable. It has been found that the be of the ocean varies considerably in depth between the two termini; it will therefore be of considerable importance that in laying down the cable allowance be made for the several inequalities. Various subjects of scientific interest will, it is confidently hoped, receive some light from the Cyclops' voyage, as she has succeeded in ascertaining the temperature and density of the water at great depths and in procuring and preserving samples of water from them, and bringing up from the bed of the ocean specimens of its formation in considerable quantities. These specimens present some curious anomalies, being composedpartly of microscopic marine animas, and also, in one instance, nearlyin mid oeean, and from a depth of about 1,580 fathoms of portions of a shell which when perfect must have been the tenes ment of a much larger animal than we have reason to believe has everbeenfound or procured from such depths; partcles of stone have also been brought up from the greatest depths, and on approaching the Newfoundland coast, at the distance of 150 miles, the whole of the bottom was one gravel bank to the me,idian of 52°. The Cyclops received from the authorities every facility for carrying out the duties she has been engaged in, but the limited time allowed her has taxed to the utmost the ingenuity and energies of her officers and men." The Vulcan, iron steam troopship, lately paid off at Portsmouthand dismantled, is ordered to have her rig altered from a ship to a bark, and to be got ready immediately for further service. The William Hammond freightship, lately arrived at Portsmouth with part of the 36th Regiment from Jamaica, is again taken up by the Government to convey troops for India. Her Majesty's steam-frigate Tribune, 31, Captain Harry Edgell, arrived at Hongkong on the 14th of May in 60 days from Callao, having had ftne weather across. A letter from her says :-" She touched at the Sandwich Islands for eoal, all well on board. She is ordered up the river. Pearl and Esk daily expected. A court-martial was held on board the Nankin on the 22d, to try the carpenter for drunkenness and using mutinous expressions towards the first lieutenant. The Court was composed of Captain Edgell, President; Captains Shadwell, of the Highflyer ; Hall, of the Calcutta; Commanders Corbett and Rolland, and Mr. W. Jeans, Judge-Advocate. The prisoner was sentenced to be dismissed the service. All quiet up the river. The Chinese are strongly fortifying some of the creeks where their junks are collected in large numbers. 'The squadron Is healthy." Captain John Robb has been appointed naval aide-decamp to the Queen, vice Rear-Admiral Smart, who has attained flag rank by the demise of Admiral Sir R. Howe Bromley. The East India CompDany's Government have been pleased to present the sum of 1,0001 to Mr. John'Anderson, Inspector of machinery in Woolwich Arsenal, as an ackmowledgment of their appreciation of the value of his patent bullet machinery, recently introduced into their service in India. The Royal Dutch steamer Cycloop, which conveyed Her Majesty the Qaeen of Holland and suite to Woolwich, left on her return voyage to Helvoetsluys yesterdav at noon. The Pioneer steamvessel, fitted with a bow on Griffith's plan, was yesterday tried down the river. An officer of the engineer department of Woolwich and some Government officials were on board by order of the Admiralty. The following appointtuents were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- Commander J. Seccombe, to (the Vulcan; Lieutenant G. Borlase, to the Vulcan; Lieutenant W. E. Stone, to the Leopard; F. B. Henwood, master, to the Coastguard; E. J, Kemp, master, to the Coastguard; W. E. S. Brome, midshipnan, to the Leopard; John Lyon, paymaster, to the Amethyst.
NEXT WEEK.-When quite a youth I spent two years in making up.my mind that I would commence the study of the French language next week. My fate had placed me as junior clerk in the counting-house of a London merchant who had extensive dealings with Parisian houses. Here, by muy industry and application (for do not let any one suppose by the confession I am about to make that I lack either of those qualities), I had become a great favourite with my employer. There seemed every certainty of my ultimate promotion to a much better position 'in the office. One thing alone stood in my way; it was my ignorance of French, and consequent inability to manage the continental correspondence. No sooner did this fact dawn Upon me than, with the promptness of determination upon which I pride myself, I firmly resolved to commence takinz lessons in French. I would begin next week. There was no hurry, to be sure, for there was no immediate prospect of a change, and I, of course, could not expect advancement till a vacancy arose. Stil], it was only prudent to be prepared for anything that nmight occur. So I would not delay. I would begin next week. Never was I more Serious in making a resolution-not even now about my five-act comedy-than I was then, and yet the next week, and the next, and many next weeks, passed, and I had not begun may French. It was not that I had forgotten my determination. By no means. But something or other always happened-nothing of consequence, it is true, iuere trifles generally-which called for sny attention. Well, it was no great matter after all. What could a few days signify? I would get these little matters off ny mind first, and then I would begin in earnest. And so a month or two slipped by, aud all at once it struck nme that I was no nearer beginning than I was when first I made my resolution. Should I commence that moment? No, no! I laughed at my own suggestion of such precipitate haste. Had I not strength of mind enough to trust my determination ? Besides, the prospect of a vacancy was as reiuote as eve. I would thougb, positively and without fail,' begin next week. It was nearly two years after this that the long-looked-for vacancy did actually occur; and what made the matter more provokiug was the fact that I really did and do still believe that the following week I absolutely should have set to work preparing myself for it.-Dikenis oseiwk Woscs. TIlE NEmv HAltvEST.-Bread was the day before yesterday sold by a baker in Parid which was made hrom wheat of the present year, grown on a farm at Vitreuil, near Blois.

RAILWAY INTBLLjGBtEvcE. GRAND TRUNK OF CAIADA. wrne iondon directors of this company state in their report that the sections of the railway that were unfinished at the date of the last report,-namely, from Guelph to Str&tford, 25 mnles, and from Brockville to Toronto, 210 miles, were completed for traffic in October last year, thus making the total mileage of the company 849 miles. Previously to the opening of the above sections the chief en- *neer of the company reported that the original estimates or engines, rolling stock, and sidings, as revised by the railway committee of the Canadian Legislature in 1852, were insufficient, and that to carry on the traffic with effect a considerable addition to this stock and further sidings and station accommodation would be required. Orders have been given for 47 engines. Of these 8 are being built in England, 32 in Canada, and 7 in the United States. The number of additional goods waggons ordered this year has been 400, of which 100 were ordered at Hamilton, Canada West, 100 in the United States, and 200 at the company's workshops, MontreaL About one-half of the foregoing stock has already been delivered, and the remainder will be completed during the present summer. The works of the Victoria-bridge have been carried on successfully up to the close of the Last season. The two abutments and nine of the piers are now compleetd, and the ironwork for the tubes is in a state of proportionate progress. In the last session of the Canadian Parliament application was made to the Legislature, representing that the Act of 1856 did not afford that relief to the company which its requirements demanded; and an Act has been passed by which, under certain conditions, the claim of the province upon the company in respect of the debt of upwards of 3,00,0001. is postponed to the payment of dividend to the shareholders at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. The effect of this most important concession, for which the thanks of the shareholders are justly due to the Canadian Government and Legislature, is to place the share and debenture capital in the most favourable position. The whole capital on which interest is payable at the present time, exclusive of the rent for the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railway, is 5,144,9901., of which 216,190L consists of preference bonds, 1 888,1001. of debenture capital, and 3,040,7001. of share capital. To the 5,144,990L must be added balance of preferenoo bonds created but not yet issued and of calls on preference bonds issued 1,783,810L, balance of debentures to be issued to Messrs. Peto and Co. on account of Victoria-bridge 61,3001., and balance of shares to ditto 174,9501.; thus making the whole capital, including the cost of the Victoria-bridge and the other works required by the Act of 1856, 7,165,0501., in lien of 12,900,0001, the amount of capital authorized. The liabilities of the company amount to 681,6051., and the sum required for additional rollin stock, station and other accommodation, is 503,6211. The Mareholder. will be asked at the special meeting to be held on the 25th of August at Toronto for an increase of capital to the extent of 2,000,0001. The resolution wil ony seek for authority to issue an amount not excbeding 1,050,0001. in debentures, 500,0001. of this issue is to be in substitution of the C debentures created last year, which will be cancelled. The directors recommend that these debentures be created on the following terms, vz,,that they rank immediately after the existing debentures of the company, and bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum; and that one-third be repayable in five years, onethird in 10 years, and one-third in 15 years. The directors believe that no circumstances are likely to arise which will make the issue of the surplus shares, the amount of which is 1,583,2001., necessary; and nothing wil be done by them with reference to this capital without the sanction of the shareholders, given at a general meeting. It is the opinion of the directors that there is no reason for doubting the future prosperity of the railway, and that it is obvious the infancy of so large a system can afford no real test of its future greatness. It is satisfactory to be able to add that the weekly returns of the current year show a considerable increase in the passenger traffic. Arratgements now in progress cannot fail to add largely to the revenue of the railway. The directors learn by their last advices from Canada that a traffic agreement of a very satisfactory character is nearly completed between the Montreal Ocean Steam Company and the Gand Trunk Company. A monthly line of screw steamers from Liverpool to Portland, calling at St. John's, Newfoundland, and Halifax, was established at the commencement of this year, and the directors are informed that it is about to be converted into a fortnightly line. Other steamship proprietors have been in communication with the company on the subject of running vessels in connexion with the Grand Trunk Railway. At the commencement of the present year a through traffic and emigration department was organized in the London office. Iany of the persons who have already travelled with through tickets, purchased previously to their leaving Great Britain, have communcated to their friends at home the excellence of the arrangements for their proteoction, and the comfort and speed with which they have been conveyed to their destinations. The receipts on capital account to the 31st of December, 1856, amounted to 7,727,4301., and the expenditure to 7551,5891., leaving a balance of 175,8401. The revenue for tie half-year endinf the 31st of December, 1856, showed that 170,8361 had been received and 143,853l. expended, leaving a balanoe of 26,9831. MIDLAND. A special meeting of this company was held on Tnesday at Derby, to consider a Bill now before Parliament authorizing the North-Western Railway Company to abandon: a portion of their railway, and sell or grant a lease of their undertaking to the Mfidland Company; Mr. Elis in the The C &cr? explained the object of the BilL It gave power to the Lancaster and Carlisle and,the Midland Companies, or either of them, to purchase or lease the Northwestern lino, or to amalgamate with it. The directors recommended the proprietors to assent to the Bill, as the permissive powers might be useful to them. The Lancaster and Carie and North-Western Companies had already approved the Bill. A formal resolution approving the Bill, in compliance with the standing orders of the House of Lords, was carried. The CHA xiAN then called attention to the Bill promoted by the Post-office authorities for the purpose of taking the rrangement of the trains on railways into their own hands, He trusted that every shareholder in the company would use his influence with members of Parliament to request their attention to the matter, and, if possible, prevent the passing of so objectionable a measure. Some of the shareholders expressed their gratification at the course adopted by the chairmen and directors of nearly all the railway companies in the kingdom with regard to opposing the rost-office measure, and trusted they would unite in as cordial a manner to remove other oppressive measures injurious to railway property, The proceedings concluded wfith a vote of thanks to the chairman. GLASGOW AND SOUl-WESTERN. A special meeting of this company was held on Monday at Glasgow, to consider a Bill now before Parliament for authorizing a railway from Castle Douglas to Portpatrick. The Lord Provost of Glasgow occupied the chair, The CEAIRMAN explained that the Glasgow and South. Western Company had agreed to subscribe 60,0001. to the undertaking, the Lancaster and Carlisle 40,0001., and the Belfast and County Down 15, 0001., making together 115,0001L subscribed by railway companies. The local promoters of the Bill had subscribed 245,0001., or would do so, makinl the total subscribed 360,0001., the total share eapits being 460,0001., and the borrowing powers 150,0001. The BiU was promoted with the entire concur rence of the Lancaster and Carlisleand theLondon and North-Western Railway Companies, and it had the support of every leading landowner upon the line, Out of about 600 acres required for the railway, only about 20 acres were held by parties dissenting. Permissive powers to subscribe to the undertakin were y the Bill given to the Caledonian and London and North-Western Railway Companies ; and the promoters hoped they would take part of the unalotted stoo, if necessary. Permissive powers were given to the Lancaster and Carlisle to subscribe a further saun ,,f 60, 0001., and to the Glasgow and South-Western a further sum of 40,0001.; but they would require the assent of three-fourths of the paid-up capital represented at meetings of the respective companies specially convened for the purpose. The Belfast and County Down Company were completing their system of lines to Donaghadee, so that the railway arrangements at both sidee of the Channel were in train for concentrating the traffic at the two nearest ports of Donaghadee and Portpatrick. A resolution approving the Bill was passed unanimously, and the meeting separated. CALEDONIAN. A special meeting of this company was held on Monday, at Glasgow, Ur. W. Johnstone in the chair. The CHuIRmAN explained that the meeting was convened in compliance with the standing orders ot the House of Lords to consider two Bills now before Parliament, one to make a railway from their line to Strathaven, and the other to make a railway from Portpatrick to Castle Douglas. Those Bills contained permissive clauses authorizing working arrangements between the Caledonian and the other two companies. Be had no hesitation in recommending tho shareholders to approve the BilLs, which were in fact promoted by other parties. The Secretary read the heads of a Bill to enable the Hamilton and Strathaven Company to make a railway from the al edonhan line near Hamilton to Stratbaven. owers were Contained in the Bill to enable the Caledonian Com. pany to work the line and to enter into arrangements with regard to tolls. &c. Tfhe CHAIRIAN moved a formal resolution approving the BilL which was seconded by Mr. M'MiCKING, and carried unanimously. The Secretary read the heads of the British and Irish Grand Junction Railway Bill for making a railway froLa Portpatrick to Castle Douglas. It would form a junctioa at the latter place with a line now in course of constructio i from Castle Douglas to Dumfries, giving communicatio s between Ireland and Scotland, and through Scotland ta England. They would run over a portion of the Caledonian line from Gretna to Carlisle. On the motion of the CHAIRMAN, seconded by Mr. M'MICEING, a formal resolution approving the Bill was carried unanimously. A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceedings. i CONVEYANCE OF MAILS BY RAILWAY. On Monday afternoon a very numerous deoutation of chairmen, directors, ad other gentlemen connected with the railway interet waited on Lord Palmerston and the Chancelor of the Exchequer on the subject of the Bill now before Parliament to make further provision for the conveyance of mails by railway. The deputation consisted of the Marquis of Chandos, the Marquis of Stafford, Captain Huish, and afr. Stewart (of the London and North-Western Railway), Captain Bulkeley and Mr. Brunel (Great Western Railway), Mr. Packe and Mr.' Denison, M.P. (Great NQrthan Railway), Mr. Locke, M P.

Allpurt (Midland Railway), M9r. Dcesini., Mb.P,, aud Mr, Je Get .g,utheru old Western rf Ireand), Vscount ViRiers and Mfr. Saxnders (South Wales Railway), and Mr. Coates and others representing all the leading wlays in the kingdom. The main objections to the Bill bainng been detailed by the deputatien, Lord Pslmerston, after some discussion, agreed to postpone the second reading of the Bill, and intimated that in the meantime he would consult the autho. rities mainly interested in the matter. REPORTS OF COMMITTEES ON RAILWAY BILLS. Mr. CoRRY reported from the Committee on Group 7 of Ralway Bills that the additional capital proposed to be raised by the company under the Bill ia 10,OOl., of which sum 10,0004. are to be raised by the creation of new ordinary shares, to be applied to the construction of the branch raili way to Caerph ily, and 90,0001 to be raised by the issue of preferenoe shares for the general purposes of the existiMn undertaking, and the amount of loan they are empowered to raise is, with the snms already Luthorized to be raised, not to exceed in the whole 100,000., when the whole of the oapital shall have been subscribed for, and one-half thereof paid up.

HA YMAREKT THEATRE. The firs tribute of the theatrical profession to the memory of the late Mr. Douglas Jerrold was paid last night at tho Haymarket, when the Housekeeper and the Prisoner of War were performed. We may take occasion to remark that great judgment has been shown by the Committee of the "Jerrold Fund" In selecting pieces to be played in honour of the departed dramatist. Of those of his works that lack the melodramatio element the two naned above are unquestionably the most popular, and were therefore rightly produced at the theatre that, above every house in London, is associated with British comedy. Of his more melodramatic works, on the other hand, thefavourites are the RentDay and BWack Eyed Swsan, and hence these are rightly announced for performance at the Adelphi, the theatre that, above every house in London, is associated with the higher class of melodrama. The cast of the Housekeeper last night was as follow3:Sydney Maynard .Mr. Howe. Tom Purple.. Mr. W. FArson. lather Oliver .. .. .. .. .. Mkr. sWebster. Simon Box .Mr. Euckstone. Daguorre .. .. .. .. .. .. Mr. Braid. Lavafe .Ilr. L. Walter. e i. . . . . r. Roger,. in .Mr. Clark- Christopher 1ayer .Mr. E Villies irellya Mm Reynolds. WidowDuckling .. .. .. .. .. Mr. Poynter. Sophy Hawes .Misa KL Witon. The actors in the above list belong, with one exception, to the Haymarket company. The one exception is Mr. Benjamin Webster, who played Father Oliver when the piece was first produced at the same theatre, on the 17th of July, 1833, and thusestablished his reputation as an actor of mnarked idiosyncrasies. The memory of Mr. Jerrold would not have been adequately honoured had not the manager of the Adelphi visited the Haymarket to represent, with his ancient mastery, that imperturbable Jesuit that has had so many sucecesses upon the London stage. It should be observed that MIr. Bulckstone is the original Simon Box. Of the rest of the performers all are professionally younger than the Housekeeper,-at least, in the eyes of the London -public. At the conclusion of the first piece the following address, written by Mr. Samuel Lucas, was delivered by Mr. Phelps:- "Welcome, ln Jerrold's name I From Jerrold's tomb This greeting chases half the gathering gloom, A*- torus our 0orrmr for hi. moorta part uTo joy and pride In his immortal art. "If of this art, enduring at its prime, "We gather salvage from the wvreck of time, "You, mindful of the storms and struggles pawt% "Receive and welcome It to shore at last. Truesto yourselves, and to each other true *In honouring one who greatly honoured you, "Behind this curtain you can greet at will "His genius living and triumphaut stiL There waits the actor-there the scene is -et, And there the author's thought is pregnant yet There the lght offsPring, of his fancy sprung, "Betray their parent by their Enslis tongue, Reflect his native hunour in their part, "Or draw their pathos from his manly heart. "As t was of old, In England's clasEio age, "Et own oreations amply flU our stage. "Theirs is the savour and the zest we crave, S' Surging and sparklng like a Chaanel wave, "With altthathadbeen Attie, but the Nine Steepd them in English and a stronger brine. "Forge6tful of their state here kings may sit "Subjects themselves to his imperi3a wit"Wi that flows on regardless-ree as air, "Like the rough waters around OCuute'd chair. "You humbler men, who come to see the play "And cheer the playwright, carry this away,-- "The man was stllU more worthy of regard, And-though he smote the hilittines so hard"He fought a fair, a brave, and generous fight, "And struck in honour's name for ruth and right: "Hopeless of cross orriband-taking heed "Iesfor his fortunesthan the common need; "So-for his guerdon and tbe common catne- "Do you now crownhiS with your just applause." In the production of the Prisoner of War great pains were taken to awaken a reminiscence of old times. The piece was originally brought out on the 3d of February, 1842, when Mtr. Macready was making his last gallant struggle to preserve one of the " Large houses" as a home for the legiti. mate drama. The suburban managers had not then commenced their experiments, as missionaries of " legitimacy " in the outskirts of London, and Mr. Phelos, little dreaming that he would so soon become a dramatic chieftain of Pentonville, was content to devote all his bluff humour and manly pathos to the delineation of Captain Channel. Wiilingly did he visit the Raymarket last night, not only to deliver the address, but to conjure up the image of " Old Drury" as it was in better days, and never was a character more genuinely represented than the stern bnt affectionate veteran, in whom anger and kindliness are ever contending for the mastery. The brother and sister, Peter and Polly Palhnall, the former always ready to lie for the honour of his native country, the latter marvellous with her short waist and her intense sentimentality, ever stood high among the impersonations of the "Keeleys," and these too were at the Haymarket last night for the benefit of the " .Jerrold Fund." They both did their utmaost; indeed, so overpowering was the comical misery displayed by Mrs. lKeeley on reading the letter of her incarcerated sweethoEart that she was honoured with a call at the end of the scene-a compliment usually reserved for Italian vocalists.

We have confined our remarks to those artistb who have, as it were, gone out of their way in aid of the " Jerrold fund " and to whose performance an historical interest is attached. Let us add by way of conclusion, that the pieces were played in the beat spirit throughout, and that the numerous audience who had assembled to honour the author's memory were most enthusias ic in demonstrating the gratification afforded them by the actors, The Adelphi performance wil take place on Wednesday, the 29th inst.

The finest portion of the armour was sold to-day, consisting of sever3l splendid suits in the Talbot Gallery-a very fine tilting cap-A-pie suit of plate armour, engraved, 82 guinew; a suit of fluted armour, of globose form, date 1550, 91 guineas; a grand equestrinfigur ofa knight, in a complete suit of fine plate armour, fluted, the figure holding in his hand a beautiful State sword, inscribed, *Ego sum Talbotti, pro vincere inimicos suno," old for 71 guineas. Several flags and banners in the armoury were next sold. A blue silk flag, carried bythe Earlof Shrewsbury at the funeral of William IV, was withdrawn. A number of curiosities and ornamental objects closed the sale. These included figures of Le Grand Talbotand his Countess-sold for 15s. 1 and a bust of Sir Gilbert Talbot, of Grafton Mfanor, carved in wood. The proceeds of the day's sale was upwards of 9001., being about 1,7001. for the whole. The sale of the porcelain, sculpture, marbles, and marble tables in the TLlbot Gallery, the Picture Gallery, and the Conservatory will commence to-morrow, and the general im. pression is that for several of the articles there will be great competition and high prices realized. The marbles include the celebrated mosaic Reoman table, with exotic birds in the centre, said to be the most splendid of its kind in the empire.
MODERN LATINITY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I was glad to find that the Latin inscription of the Royal VictoriaAylumisannounced asonly "intended" to be cut in stone; and I hope the authorities will revise it before it is placed as a permanent memorial of English Latinity. In hac ade, according to the rule which we learn at school, "ecta in the plural signifieth a house," could apply only to the chapeL And, thoughinstances of the use of the Eingular for a house may be fished up in doubtful readings or from inferior authors, good taste would avoid what loks lilke a solecism. Coloniis ac,apudIn1dos is a sad cacophony; akjue should be used before a voweL Strangest of all is it that the inscription does not define the future inhabitants of the house as the orphan daughters of naval and military men, but simply benc de c paa nwritonum. Surelythose who aut mrneorrcs alios fecere nierenda are not exclusively " the soldiers, seamen, and marines of the asalm-n" IL
