" Her Majesty commands us to express to you her satis. faction that the present state of affairs in Europe inspires a well-grounded confidence in the continuance of peace. "T The arrangements connected with the funl execttion of the stipulations of the Treaty of Pnris have, from various causes. not yet been completed; but Her Majesty trusts that by the earnest efforts of the contracting parties to that treaall that remains to be done with reference to its stipulations may ere long be satisfactorily settled. " Her Majesty commands us to inform you that the extensive mutinies which have broken out among the native troopS of the army of Bengal, foHowed by serious disturbances in many parts of that presidency, have occasioned to Her Majesty extreme concern, and the babarities which have been inflicted upon many of Her Majesty's subjects in India and the sufferings which have been endured have flled HerMajesty's heart with the deepest grief; while the conduct of many civil and military offieers who have been plaoed in circmstances of much difficulty, and have been exposed to great danger, has excited Her Majesty's warmest admiration. " Her Majesty commands us to inform you that she 'wll omit no measure calculated to quell these grave disorders; and Her Majesty is confident that, with thae blessing of Providence, the powerful means at her disposal will enable her to accomplish that end. "6endemm of the Homue of Commour, "Her Majesty commands us to tbank you for the liberal suppiles which yon have voted for the service of the present year, and for the assuraness which you have given her of your readiness to afford Her Majesty whatever support may be necessary for the restoration of tranquility in India.

"My Lords and (entlemen, "Her Majesty commands us to convey to you her heart. felt acknowledgments for the provision which you have mdse for her beloved daughter, the Princess Royal, on her approaching mawriage with his Royal Highness Prince Yrederick William of Prussia.

" We Are commanded by Her Majesty to ecxpress to you ber eonfidence that on your return to your several coumties you will employ that influence which so justly belongs to you to promote the welfare and happiness of her loyal aud faithful people ; and she prays that the blessing of Almighty God may attend and prosper your endeavours." The Commisson of Prorogation having been read by the clerk at the table, The LORD CEANCELLOR declared the Parlianent prorogued to Friday, the 6th of November next, and the proceedings, which were obviously uninteresting from the small number of ladies 'who graced the benches and the strangers' galery, 'were brought to a close at 20 minutes to 2 o'clock.

Lord PA .MEESTOlT. The question of the hon. and gallant general is one deserving of attention, but until we get a more detailed account from the Governor-General of the condition of the persons referred to it is impossible to ay in wat way wre can he most useful to them.

A MEzp. or PAn2&esT SaoT.-On Thurs. day afternoon, About a quarter past 1 o'clock, tr. James Platt, one of the members of Parliament for Oldha, wg Accidentally shot on the inoors at his estate, near Greenfield, Saddleworth, and the wounds proved fatl in litUle more than an hour afterwards. The circamstances attending the fatal occurrenoe are of a very distressing character. It sp. pears that the bho. gentleman, who recenUy rarnea to Werneth-park from the dischae of his .arliaioentesz duties, went out in the forenoon, about 31 o'clocl, to have a day's shooting. He was accompni by his intimate friend, Mr. Josiah Rsdchffe, the major of Oldham, aud other gentlemen. After they hCa been shooting about two bours the party came, in the pur. suit of poort, to a gully in the moors, which the deoeiAel gentleman was the first to cross. Mr. Josiah Badcliffe, the myor, was following about six yards distant carryisg bic gun in a horizontal position. In taking the leap ove.r the gnily he stumbled a little, and the trigger caught his leg, causing the gun to go off, And the con. tents to lodge in the calf of Mr. Pkatts right lag. The wound was inmediately bandaged by one of the arty, and the unfortunate deoesed carried intothe ameeeper's honse, which was not very far di*atSat Adsw gp., But he never rallied; tbe shock was too get for ilag we kly consti'ution; aud, although there walitte ion at blood from the wound, and the bandage WAS AS ffficint ae could have been put on by the most akdlful of the po. fesdon, Mr. Platt died at About half-pest 2 o'clock. Immse distely on the ccident taking place an express wam nt to Oldham for the family ourgeon, but he wa not at had, and otber medical men, but they were too ate to rends, anyU asistance. The lmentable atality has thrown a gloom over Oldham, and plunged inanv of tbe leading famili of that district in the deepest distre . The worth of the deceased is best kinown where it has been most dsplard; and the friends of s1l that concerns the proserty of t town and people of Oldhan will regret, writh te friends of progress generally, the cutting down, Na the ealy ae oe 34, of a gentleman whose amiable disposition,. energy habucter, and pbLooc mafulnees, had ind or himikbe high position which he held. it wa W. Pjat who Wu tae means of ousting Mr. W. J. Fox at the last kel on for Oldham.w- and,juk,r g'zaminer.

MfoQ.NTiARKBTj X do.ITYINTBLLTG&CEB. Friday Eventng. The 01ditional detaila published from Iadia today have produced great gloom, and the funds have e,xpienced a further decline. The apparently daktrous conflict with the mutineers before Agra 'aa the chief subject of regret, but increased uaeGasiness is felt from the fact of a rising having been -AttemPted at Ryderabad, where any serious move;nent might be likely to operate unfavourably on the Madras army. Consols for money opened at the elosing quotation of yesterday, 901 to j, and reesded to 90i, at which they remained for some time wvith a very flat appearance. Ultimately there were buyers at 90j for money, while for the 9th 'f Septemaber the last price was 90i to J. iFor the new account in October transactions ihave been entered into at 90g. As the foreign exChangea show dulness, the market would have been anoreunfavourably affected but for tbe counteract;ing influence of a further large fall in the price of 'Wheat and the continued prospect of gold arrivala. Bank' Stock left off at 214 to 215 ; Reduced, aO to i; New Three per Cents., 9Lg to 91; India -Stock, 211 to 213; India Bonds, 203. to 17s. dis-count; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. In the discount-market to-day the demiand was active, and nothing is now done below the Bank -2ninlirum. Thle foreiga stock-market continues steady, but -only a moderate amount of business has been transacted. Mexican vwere negotiated for the account at 22+; Peruvian Four-and-a- Half per Cents., 82i; Rmsian Five per Cents., 112i; ditto, Nour-and-a-Haif per Cents., 99 and 98k; and the E;msgl, 99X; Spanish Deferred, 202; Turkish Six per Cents;, 94j; for the account, 94, ;, and J; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed for the ac'Count, 99. -In the foreign excbanges this afternoon the rates zvere generally a shade lower than last post. In the corn-market his morning there wan a 'uirther dedine of between 3s. and 4c. per qusrter. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week showis great animation, and an advance of .id. per lb. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was -66f. 95c. for both money and account, showing heavires, without any material alteration. A further total of 66,0001. Australian gold was -sold to the Bank to-day. The Baltic from New York has brought 170,0001., and the Persia, which may be looked for to-morrow *sfternoon, wil also beliely to have a large amount. The letters from Hamburg state that the demand for money has abated, and that the supply is now abundant at 6+ per cent. The next Indian telegraph is expected on Saturday, the 12th of September. In the colonial produce-markets dlring the week the tone has been steady, and prices exhibit little -alteration. The improvement recently established uipon saltpetre and indigo has been strengthened by he telegraphic intelligence fror. Bengal; but the -other leading staples are not miuh influenced. 'Tbere has been a better demand for sugar both for -Shipment and bome consumption, and at the com.snencement quotations ihowed a recovery of ls. to 23. 6d. from the lowest point of lt week. To-day, -however, this wvas entirely lost upon soft low deacriptions. The heavy supply of foreign muscovado -tends to check the upward course of the market, and speculators do not appear to have regained con-fidence. The public sales of plantation Ceylon coffee went off with rather more spirit at a rise of Is. to 2s. The first of the Dutch Trading Company's sales of Java vill commence on the 31st inst. The Cbina news is considered favourable to an advance in tea, and common Congou within the past S`wo days has been dealt in at ls. 2kd. per lb. Rice has temporarily attracted a speculative inquiry, but is now again dull, closing at rather lower rates. In spices there has been no change. In saltpetre a eurther rise has occurred of 2a. to 3s. A considerable -quantity of nitrate of soda has changed hands, landed and afloat, at very firm prices. Of indigo there are now few sellers even at the late advance of 6d. to 9d. upon dedrable qualities. A coTrebpondent complains, and with justice, if the statements he makes on the subject are correct, that the allusions to the conduct exhibited bv the Chairman and Diractors of the Great Nortbern Railway in their patronage of Redpath have been fartoo xnild. It has been said merely that tbey committed the fault of appointing him when, according to their -own admission, they knew he had been a speculator, -snd tnat they contiiuaed him in his responsible ..post, without check or supervision of any kind, through anotorious career of extravagance. :But -accordg to the information now furnished, -and which can easily be corrected if it is inaccurate, their laxity was of a still more extraordinary description. Redpath, it is affirmed, began his career in the office of Messrs. Wilcox and Anderson, with twhom he served six years, when he left them owing to a deficiency in his accounts. He then engaged in business for himself, and failed in six months, paying about Is. 6d. in the pound. Meanwhile he had -narried a respectable woman, through whose friends "he got into the &ervice of the Brighton Railway Company as a supernumerary clerk; but when the question arose for keeping bim perma. nently they applied to Mlessrs. Wilcox and Anderson for his character, who refused to give him one. Rejected from the Brighton Company, he is next heard of in the service of the Great [Northern. The question aTises, how did he get there? Did the Brighton Company give him a false character or no character, or did the same influence which got him into the Brighton without a character get him into the Great Northern with<out one l And tbi vwas the man ultimately selected for the most confidential post in the company's gift, and who, according to the recent report of the Com.naittee of Investigation, was allowed by the secretary to use the stamp representing his signature at pleasure, in the face of circumstances constantly transpiring that should have excited euspicion even If the miost unexampled testimonials had been received to previous character ' It is to be hoped some explanation may be given. Hitherto the .directors have endeavoured to throw blame upon subordinates-a course open in most cases to those who vwil condescend to resort to it; but it is not to be supposed that they leave the nomination of all the head officers of the company to the subordi.. xiatea, even although when the patronage has been exercised they may find it convenient to take no further troublo and to consign the whole set to their own control. The annexed is another communication on the eame subject:_ '- Sir,-To your adnmirable strictures on the lamentabole .Great Northern Railvay frauda will you permnit me to add -the figures They convey an instructive lesson. Redpath at first began tiaiidly; finding there was no master's eye, he iDecamo embold6ned, until he abstracted the enormous sum of 219,6001. The amount of blindness on the part of the -directors seems almost incredible. *From the report just issued of the Committee of Investiastion the first fraud aepears to be nn _ £219,632 10o "Your obedient servant, A reprewentative of the comrmittee of preference :Sbareholders also sends ibe following- " ffir,-By - smpplemental report of the directors of the 'Great Northerm Rnilway, circulated this morning, it a tbat they refnse to pay any dividend to the preference share'holders at the next meeting, because they have not had an opportunity of appealing from the decision of the Vioe. tCanoellor before doing so. "I solicit your attention to the following factg*- "1L Before the case was argued the counsel for the prelerence shareholders offered to be bound by the Vice-Chan-cellor' judgmentk without appeal, but that offer woe refused 'by the counsel for the directors.

STATE OF TADE. AANCHRSTER, Am. 2&', we hve still an umsettled and feverish market, the large operations in cotton st Liverpool this week, where the sales have averaged 13,000 bales per day and led to bigher rates, baving oompelled manufacturers to make constant attempts to raise their quotations in an equal degree. The rise in cotton is about id. per lb. during the week, and in most cases spinners have advanced their prices to the same extent for yarn; but rnanufacturers have found much difficulty in following their example. Those who have advanced their quotation sf6nd a diffliculty in selling, the advanoe in cotton being mostly the result of a speculative feeling, while the demand here for cotton goods is one almost entircly.ree from speculation. In domestics, printing cloths, shir eings, and almost al fabrics, the basiness done has been moderate, btt in rmost of them sufficient to take off production. In yarns the ranid rise has led to a good deal of hesitation, but considerablc business has been done by the home trade and for Germany. The week's transactions, however, have probably been somewhat checked by these high rates.
FrATAL RAILWAY COLLIBION AT WATCHEr. On Tuesday afternoon r. Mfonokton, ooroner for West Somerset, opened as inquiry into the cause of the deaths of Mr. John James and two other men named George Wft liams and Henry Giles, who were killed by two engines coming into colision on the West Somerset Mineral Railway on Saturday afternoon, when about 15 other persons were frightfully injured. It appeared from the evider ce of Philip Norris, a clerk in the office of the Blrandon-hill Iron Company, that on Satur. day afternoon he got upon an engine on the single line of rails now in progreFs along with Mr. James WiUiam Thomas, the engine driver, and flmat, the stoker; and attached to the engine was a coal truck, in which were abo-t 30 men and boys. The party left Roadwater about 4 o'clock, in. tending to go to Watchet to receive their weekswage When the trainreached Washford, Olles, the man in chare of the railway crossing there, held up a flag signal for the erogine to stop at the crossinz. Theengine was stopped some of the men got off the truck and others got on, and Giles also got on the engine for the purpose of preventing the driver proceeding further. At this time a man named Backingham wasstandingtthe crossing, and be warned the men of the danger of going on to Watchet. The deceased Giles distinotly said to the engine-driver " You must not go on, as Aliok (the driver of the Watebet engine) ia coming up sith two trucks of coaL" In spite of this warning Mr. James, who was second enSneerin charge of the works on the line, in the absence of r. Rice Hopkins, civil engineer, expzessed awih to S o on to Watchet, aud ordered the driver to go on that he might reach the post-office in time to post someletters endhe seemed certain of arriving at Watobet before the engine with the coal trucks had started. The engine then went On and aboat half way between Washforderossing andWatchet it met the other engine. When the men on tbe Roadwater engine became aware of the peril they were in the other engine wasabout 200 yards off. The break was put on and the steam shut off; the witness (Norris) jumped off, and as he fell to the groxund the collision took place. Whien Mr. James ordered the engine-driver (Thoma to go on he hesitated for two or three seconds. Mr. James then urged him to go on, and said, "Oh, we'll be in time." Thomas then drove on at about the rate of 20 miles an houruntil about half way between Washford and the place wbere the accident happened; he then slackened his speed and sounded the whistle to warn the other engine. There was no shunting place between Washford and Watebet, so that one engine could passthe other. Other witnesses spoke to the same facts, and it was stated in evidence that the Poad water engine usuaUy took down the workmen on the Saturday night, and it was quite unusual for the Watchet engine to leave at that time. Mr. Thomas Brown, of Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire, one of the directors and prornoters of the West Somrerset Mineral Railway, was present at the inquest, and in reply to questions from the coroner, stated that the directors appointed Mr. Rice Eopnns, of London, their engineer, and intrsted him with the sole management and construction of the line, thus making thimtnhanswekrable for omissions and coNmions in referenoe To he work.s The jury intimated that the presence of Mr. Hopkins as a witness -was indispensable, and the inqteest was therefore adjourned for a week that he mtght attend.
THE INDIAN ARB)Y. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TINES. Sir,-I have lately been favoured with so large a space in your valuable columns that I feel very reluctant either to trespass again upon your liberality or intrude farther mny opinions upon the public. But your correspondent " Spec. | tator," whose letter appears in Monday's impression of 171e Tim=es, seems to have misunderstood my views concerning the future military establishments of our Indian Brmpiro, and, as others may have dose the same, 1 hope you will allow me to set him right through the medium of your colaumns. jBforo entering upon tho question, however, I desire to record my grateful sense of your praiseworthy liberality in so freely opening up your columns to thefrank expression of public opinion on this all-important question, even when that opinion may differ from your owrn. Such a course I consider highly calculated to lead to sound conclusions on the point discussed as wleU as one most honourable to a I.ublie journal. Yvur correspondent " Spectator" would appear to infer that I advocate the entire abolition of our native soldiery in India. But this is not the case. I most distinctly stated in my last letter to you that we could nob do without them, and even pointed out the character of the levies of which they should be composed. What I did say-and now deliberately repeat-was that we no longer require the enormous native armies which we bave so long beencompelledtomaintain to overawe neighbour. jng Powers, with their large and often well-disciplined forces. Neither these Powers nor their armies longer exist. And if our large native army was required chiefly, if not entirely, with reference to these-and this will hardly be disputedthen it follows, as a matter of course, that this large regular army is no longer necessary, and should at least be greatly reduced. BuLt I would even say more than this, I would add that an immense alien army of this kind, raised from the people of a " subj6ct kingdom," as you, Sir, most correctly term it, vwithout any foreign foe to oppose, becomes a serious evil in a State. It is not only a heavy and needless burden on our finances, but is a most dangerous element of rebellion, the most ready instrument to be employed by every seditious and disaffected subject of our Indian dominions. The easy and idle life of the Sepoy in cantonments renders him pecnliarly open to be tampered with, and he presents not only the best soil in which to scatter the seeds of sedition, but when these take root the result is such as could never othervdse occur. It is only because they are soldiers armed and disciplined that they become both formidablo in revolt and the most suitable body for the disaffected to tamper with. I repeat, and I chaUenge contradiction, that with the exception of our native army our Indian empire possesses fewer elements of successful insurrection against her rulers than any other nation on the earth, and for the veryreasons to which yourefer inyour able articleonLord Shaftesbury' motion in the House of Peers-namely, the antagonism of races and castes for which India has ever been so distinguishecL The native army alone is to be feared for the future, and I hesitate not to say that with only the same force of British soldiers as we have kept there for some years past thab empire would be far more secure withot our large native army than with it ! I therefore insist that both from motives of economy and of common prudence it becomes our duty to do away with tho great bulk of our native soldiery, whatever we may substitute for them. I am wholly at a less to understand on what grounds your correspondent asserts that my "reasoning would at ones annihilate the armies of Bombay and Madras." I never contemplated such a thing. I believe, however, that in these armies you possess the same dangerous element oz insurrection. They are as much alien armies as that which has just burst from us, and therefore present the same prepared soil for the seeds of sedition ; and having no longer any faith in the security supposed to exist in the vatious castes and rAces of which those armaies are composed, after the late fraternizing of Hindoo and Mahommedan in the Bengal army-races the most antagonistic-I should cease to recruit for these armies until they were redauced to half their present strength. Keeping up the present strength of European officers, portions of them might then be em. ployed in the Presidency which has so suddenly ceased or nearly so to have a native army. If the Madras Sepoy is available for Burmah and Penang, and the Bombay soldier for Aden and Bushire, the former should be equally available for the Bengal provinces and the latter for Mooltan and the Punjab. Certainly, if we are to retain any considerable force of native regulars they should be held largely in solu. tion, that in case of revolt they might easily be disposed of by our European troops. Your correspondent asserts, and you, Sir, appear to hold a similar opinion, that in all countries, and especiaUy in India, there exists " a vast number of unsettled men whose occupation from generation to generation has been that of arms," and that it would be dangerous to allow such " to fall into the ranks of freebooters or to engage in tho service, of foreign Powers." I firmly believe there is no such thing to fear. I wholly deny that there is any such normal military element existing in India more than in England. That elempent is created by our demand for soldiers. Our recruits are chiefly, and the Hlindoos almost entirely, obtained from the fami1ies of those employed in agricultnre, and 'who, but for our requirements, would continue in their pastoral or agricultural occupation. Cease to recruit, and this material will soon cease to exist. And were any suoh bady likely to continue after the demand had ceased I ask, Where are the "foreign Powers" possessing either the wealtl^ or the wlll to employ them ? I repeat, None such now exis. As to yc.ur eaorrepondent's propoml to re-form an rmy out of all ran1kL and from which cate must be inexorably banished," I can only appeal to every offlcer acqu3inted with the people of the Bengal I'rcsideucq to say of hatvalueseUoh an irMy would besas sols.3 7 U 5 fja "an" wik amateril in the' sup.of a f tU ibatxsdthald& "3arine Battildn,,gf ws 'q .

Deprssed and tooteinmed for centuries by the dominszit castes, they have bcauoe debasd ans, dispirited, and are wholly devoid of that courae a chivalrous daring so necessary to makles man anythinglike 5oldier. Such men would be as li}dy, if neiot a0ge hii¶y, than the high caste Sepoy to be sccessfuliv tampedr witt by the evil-disposed, while they would be utterly worthiest In any hour of difficulty and danger.. Yon are perfectlyright iayour observationsuponLo Shaftesbury's objection to the preference given In jecrlt;. ing to high caste men. That preferenee 12w no regard WhAt*ver to the religion of the youth offering iimielf for esilistment. Certain castegonly ar enlistd bwamse, Is I have said, those of the iufeorir castes Molni, So be deficiont both in the stamina and courago neoeisr b qualify them for the work of a soldier when said upor. But I have-yet to learn tlbt any preference bhe b ig n. to a Brahmin over a Rajpoot, or over a MusuILma, wth0 WAs as well formed otherwis feor a solAier. I .ra&er believe there is A feeling against the Br,hmins)&ongjlze officers of the service; and the oommanding ofdoers of regiments generaUly object to hxving more thanu a. fsrta Dumber of such. Bat the fact of our having, s a rule,haf of our regiments Mahonmnedan must prove that no respeo: is paid to the religious position of tie Brahmin In fast, the very idea of such a thing to all who know anything of the Indian army is simply ridiculous. Men of high Casta make good soldiers, but, as we havo proved by horrible experience, can become the most treacherou frLends; but low caste natives would generally prove bad soldiers, if isot even dastards, and would, when the opportunit. offered, prove equally treacherous and fiendish PA their big', caste brethren. After what ha oocnrred I maintain, and I an supported by what is writtek by hunredas of offieers on the spot, that we never can put oonfideno in the native soldiers again. Our enly monfidene for the fotre must be found in the vastly superior force of the conquering race You think it " desirable to disclaim as long as posible the character of conquerors ruling by main force over an itamens disafted populition ;" but from my expjeriena of the native, and after what has happened, as weU afroom the knowledge ot what human nature is, I am painfully convinced that if we are to hold India at all we must do so wfholly and entirel as conquerors ruling by fear I arm also to beoblig to difer from you in thinking that it will be time enough to consider whether India is to be held bD the potent influence of European troops lone when 'Madras and Bombay-when the Sikh3 and Scinde Irregulars have revolted. We should have an sal theverysame thinga year ago of the now defWndes ot Delhi,'the late army of Bengal. Itwillbe found that the different composition of that army from those of MAdra end Bombay has had nothing to do with the revolt. This is only the natural struggle for power on the part of a mere . nary army when once possessed with the idea that. they amra the strongest party. Your assertion that "it is eaier to draO soldiers from a hundred millions than from twenty. eight" may be undeniable, but the question to be next solved is whether these soldiers, d-rwn from the hundred millions of the subject race, are in the present positon of our Indian Empire not more an evil than a good, more an element of destruction than of plotection; and whether tho one European soldier from the twenty-eight Uillions will not afford you far more security InJditha the fournxtiv& and alien soldiors from the hundred miUions of the son. quered and subjeot races. Depend upon it, the costly lesson we have just learnt will have been wasted upon us altogether it we ever rely hebs. after with as much confidence as ever upon the Asiatic bat. taloons of the empire. I am. Sir. vour most .bnh,-. -4 J. a. MAODONALD, LieutaantcolonaeL Aug. 26. TO THE EDITOB. OF THE T1 %. S-r,-Haing served in all the Presidencies of India, in Ceylon, Southzrn Africa, anD the West Indies I wish to offer, through your journal, Born remarks on the varioug suggestions of your correspondents for the reorganization of the Indian Army. I entirely concur in opinion withs those who advocate the enlistment of native soldiers without referencetoesat.;and to obviste all future inconvenience it should be expreilW understood at the period of enrolment that, while abstaining from all interference with tsixr prejndices, no oornsideration of that cort should be allowed to interfere with the Implicit discharge of every niuitazy4nty. A sick Sepo, on entering the hospital of our corp*, readily txlceg 'rwine or any other nourishment frqnB the hands of the surgon or the nurse, aud we have also seen thbt he ha rnade no scruple of using greased cartridges vainst Ids offioers an( their -wives anc children. By disregarding such prejudioes a higher staudtrd of morals wvll be inculecatel througx the example of his offlicer and the aprit de corp which prevails in those parts of the Indian army where thi principle has been observed. The native army my be organized either byenrolling mezt of various racesandeastesin the same corp, or,asin the cass of the irregulars, by raising and embodying corps composed of particular races JSikhs, Goorkabs, &c.), and, as the efficiency of a corps ii India is increaed by the services of tkelt families in the field, they should be allowed to accompany them; and such corps as are composed of one race slhould, as far as possible, be employed in districts where they are unconnectedwith the inhabitanta. On emergencies their wives and children might be plaoed in deplit with one or two depot companies for their protection -when moved, anci if their sons should be declar el;gSble to enrolnent wlien of the age, say, of 14, they might be encouraged to atteud the regimental schools for* instructlon in the Englialt language, the diffuiion of which ought by every meas to ba promoted in substitution for the vatious dlects whicIk previil in different parts of India. The Cafifres and other Africin races 'ould be wall adapted for military 8ervice in India. An African corps front Ceylon was employed in the Travancore war of 1807T-, ian i suach corps can be abornited in Africa they would be com. pletely Buropeanized under Bribth officers, and readily, Christianized. If raised in Soath¢rn Africa they could be partly disciplined there, with the assistance of. the Qneen'a troops. They ought to be allowed an'leven.encouraged to take their families to India,-and mility colonioe of themn should bh formed, where the depots might be stationed. It is well known that the African race surpass alt othera in energy and enduramce when exposed to tropical heat, which the'mixed races of India are eveu less able to endare than the acclimatized European, when temperate in lia habits. If the West India regiments ereencouraged to recruitalse in Barbadoes some good soldiers might be obtained, without interfering with the labour-uiarket, in an island more densely populated than China (8(.0 to the square mile), and where the loss of nearly 2D,0W people in the cholera did not sensibly affect the plantation labourers. As the disposition of the people of India in their relationi to us as Chrstians isimperfectlyunderstood in this0ountry,. It may be important to us thst we should not aume it from the conduct of a set of pampered and taugrateful mis. ereants, who in return for the heroic confidende reposed iz them by their offioers have betrayed the baseneowof thek nature in the indulnce of their siest passions. * In the life and memoirs of the o06ebrated apostle oe India, Swartz, it is recorded that he wa employed it a critioal period as the aofiAen*ia agent. of the Govermuent to Tippoo Sultan, the formidable Xsissunlza=. ruler at Seringapatam, where, througlh Abe respect in which he was held, he was enabled to wcomplish the objects ot his mission.

LONDON, SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, 1857. The House of Lords yesterday was summoned to hear HEa MAJxSTY'S Speech proroguing Parliament read by the Lords Commissioners. In the House of Commons, in reply to Mr. BaISCOs, Lord PAIMaRSTON said the proposed telegraphic communication with India by way of the Euphrates had been undertaken by a private company, with certain contingent arrangements with il1S MArEsTY's Government; but the Turkish Government had not given its permission for carrying out the scheme. With respect to the line by Snez down the Red Sea and to Kurrachee a private company waa oontemplating such a plan, and as far as the Government could aid them without applying to Parliament it would be glad to do ao. In answer to an inquiry by Sir DE I&cy EvAs, Mr. MAoias said the Government of India had been instructed to render the most ample assistance, not only to the families of their civil and military servants, but to all destitute persons. The House was then summoned to the House of Lords, and the session terminated.
The Session which has just tardily and, it must be said, gloomily closed is one the worth of which will come out in time, and already shows in adver- sity. No recital of labours, indeed, not a | thousand counted hours of sitting and listening and dividing, not even what is actuaUy done,-which, even by the admission of opponents, is something considerable,-can prevent the imagination from ever reverting to one sad subject that weighs upon every British bosom. Occupying as it does a principal place in IHI MsmsrY'S Speech, ere that Speech can be delivered the one absorbing theme receives a darker shade and more heartrending illustration. At the head of this dark catalogue the eye almost refuses to take in the fearful murder of 240 women and children. Then there follows a list of fifty namnes, military and civil officers of all ranks and employments, either assassinated by the men they had long trusted, or butchered after capitulation, or slain in unequal and desperate conflict. Such is not the time to dwell long on the disentangled knots and vanquished obstacles of domestic legislation. However, in this country we know by long experience that there is honourable toil, and no little glory, even in these household affairs. Empires may rise and fall elsewhere, dynasties may start up and grow venerable, before, in this country, a Htouse of Commons, a Court of Law, a CoUege, a profession, a vested interest, an office, a form, a thing or word that happens to be five hundred years old can receive one jot or tittle of alteration. So there is some credit even in these humble matters, and if we look to the labour, and to the skill and resolution displayed, we may see the justice of HER MAsry's thanks to the two Houses. In England it is something to reform the jtuisdiction for the proving of Wils, to put the law of Divorce on a regular footing, and save Parliament from a responsibility which does not properly attach to it; to make a serious attempt to punish fraudulent breaches of trust; to do anything that promises a better system of secondary punishments, to effect a closer control over Joint-stock Banks, to make any impression on those laws of Insolvency and Bankruptcy which all but the simple have found it easy to evade, and even use for their convenience, or take one step in the progressive improvement of the law. Such deeds can only be told in a pedestrian strain, and eloquence itself would recoil from pauper lunatics, county police, transportation, and British Bankers. Nor is this the whole of the drudgery that has been done during these f.our of the hottest months ever known in this country. 4ll the election petitions have been patiently hLeard and decided, with hardly a murmur. More than alL to one particular measure there has been a more dogged and vexatious oppositionx than even to the repeal of the Corn Laws, or any other popular measure. All this the House of Commons endured with cheerfulness, though it might have envied every factory child in the kingdom its ligater task, its shorter hours, its freeer fancy, and less pestiferous atmosphere. The House of Coamons deserves the thanks of the country for sitting at such work twelve, sixteen hours aday, up to tihe middle of this month. Then it went its way and there was no holding it together. It was not pleasure, it was not health, it was life that was in question. Could we look only at home, with a glance now and then at the neighbouring continent, we might betake ourselves 'to the'country with hearts as light as they usually are at the end of August. There is no serious or any threotening obstacle to the entire executiow ofXthIeeaty of Paris. There is nothing as yet to be said of Persia. We have commuted a troublesome impost that detained every vesel at the entrance of the Baltic; and elsewhere all Europe is peaceful, and as friendly as one Government can be with another of a totally different -character. With one State which has not shown uniform sympathy with our exertions and our loses we are about to join a link in the form of an interesting and promising marriage. But, while I thus buying and selling and manrying ard giving in marriage, there has come upon us from across the world suoh a storm of disaster as even our checkered history can find no parallel for. Confiding too much in the sleep of a bloody fanaticism and the servility of a gentle barbarism,-confiding too much in our own genius and destiny, we have been fairly overreached by a treacherous conspiracy. India, for a hundred years up to the present day the scene of glorious victoriea over magnificent hosts, and the.nur3ery of our most heroic nsmes, is now darkened and ensanguined. with & fearful number of hideous massacres. Soldiers, judges, men of peace of all profes3iony, ministers of the Gospel, women and children, are the viotuii. What has ever been known, though not always remembered, the dignified Mahomedan and the soft Hindoo show that under thewe fair exteriors there ever lurk the instincts of the fiercest and the foulest animals in creation. Scarce a household of the better classee but mourns the death, perhaps worse sufferings, of some one never before imagined in such dreadful associations. We cannot wonder that Hxa MaraTy left other lips to tell how deeply she is affected by these events. But as if from her lips, and with all the devotion due to a Sovereign and a lady, we accept the solemn appeal, when Queen VICronA commands her servants to inform Parliament that she will omit no measure cdonulated to quell these grave disorders, apd is confident that, with the blesing of PRovIDRNnx, the powerful means at her disposal will enable her to accomplish that end. Yes; our cause is just. On the whole, we have been benefactors to India. We have long maintained peace, and even prosperity, among those countles maillions. Change their natures we could not. There is not the thought of wanton tyranny to paralyze our arm. What, then, need we fear ? Not the murderers of unarmed men, of women, and children,-not beings who can devise and perpetrate atrocities that even the stern red Indian, as we were told the other day, would recoil from. We venture to back up this appeal from the Throne with an expression of our own earnest wishes and confident hopes that during the reess HER MAJEry's Government will draw without stint on their Parliamentary powers and the resources of the country. We trust that nothing short of nece3sity will be allowed to limit the scale of our armaments for the East. We have not merely to reconquer strong positions and extensive districts, not merely to destroy some fifty regiments of treacherous and cowardly mutineers, not merely to chastise and terrify into submission independent princes, numerous contingents, crowds of Irregulars, whole tribes of robbers and murderers, and a population naturally apt to side with the strong; but, more than all, we have to perform in the eyes of the world, and for the benefit of the human race, a tremendous act of vengeatce. England, religion, and civilization have received the moat intolerable insult that Mahomedan fanaticism could devise inasyBtematic series of deliberatebrutalities on European women and children. Throughout aUl the East this is the particular mode of expressing the utmost national scorn and defiance. A people, it is there felt, that cannot, or does not choose, to protect and avenge its women is no people at all, and unfit to be served or obeyed. The Mahomedans of every class do not allow their women to be seen by the eye of man, and nowhere is this scruple so strong as in Hindostan, where even Turks and Persians are thought less refined. However dissolute an old Begum may be, -and some of them are something extraordinary in this way,-wherever she goes curtains and drape. ries must protect her from the profanation of miale eyes. In various less settled districts of Hindoetan, -Rajpootana, for instance,-where the state of society makes it difficult to protect women from insult, it is customary to destroy most female iDfants, in order to prevent what would be a disgrace to the tribe, but which a foe would always, for that reason, be ready to perpetrate. Now, we in India stand in this respect on tender ground. Tbey cannot understand, though to a certain extent th 3y envy, the freedom of our female society. Bat this is the particular point on which they hold us most accessible to insult, and accordingly the native journals have always been full of the moot scandalous libels upon English ladies. Balls, picnics, morning calls, and every occasion on which English gentlemen and ladies see one another, are continually recorded with malicious additions. There can be no doubt of a design in the horrors committed on our women and girls; and, if there were any doubt, it would be removed by the manner and method which has been delibertely adopted. It ought to be known, reluctant as we are to tell it, that the women and unmarried girls who fell into the hands of the mutineers and populace of Delhi were carried in procession for hours through the chief thoroughfare of the city, with every horror that could degrade them in the eyes of the people, previous to the last brutalities and cruelties that then, in the sight of thousanuds, were perpetrated upon them. It was done of settled purpose, to degrade England, to degrade Europe, to degrade a Christian empire and a Christian Qusmf. Now, we say it after fu deliberation, and with a due regard to the objections always forthcoming against any real and effectual policy, that not one stone of that city should be left upon another. Delhi should for the' future be only known in history as Sodom and Gomorrha, so tbat. its place shall not be known. We are well aware that this will try the fidelity of some friends, but they cannot really be our friends if they wish to preserve the memorial of our disgrace. It must be fully explaied to them that no disrespect is intended ta the Mahomedan dynasties or the Mahomedan religion, but we desire also that no disrespect shau be intended or permitted to uls. An execution ot this solemn character is not to be performed without a proper force; but, if thirty thousand British soldiers are required to keep order on the occasion, we trust that no Englishman would be found to grudge a year's more Income-tax that the work may be done. It will be the eighth time that Delhi has been destroyed, and never before was its destruction so merited. All Asia Will-'be wiser and better for the example.
The first Session after the General Election -ha passed without founding any new reputation. Satirists delight to dwell on the seeming mediocrity of the qualities which are required in a popular assembly, and a stranger dropping in occasionally during a prosy debate might be inclined to adopt the same slighting tone; but that can be no easy struggle in which so many competitors fail; not, withstanding the universally coveted prizes which reward sucoes. Year after year passes by, and Parliament succeeds Parliament; but the Ptze leaders remain in poesesion of the superioiity which several of them attained in a bygone generation. Lordl PALmsTow Wa s aredyl na old member of the House, long experienced mi 0ffie, when he first entered the Cabinet, 30 years ago;LIord Jonw Russ=r was the leader of the dominant party in 1834. At astillearlierperiodSirJAmsG i was a prominent colleague of Lord Grxy. W. GLADsToWE, although he belongs to a younger generation, was a succeful speaker in the days of LOrd =oUIM?Z. Mr. DISRA= boasts a Parliamentary experience of more than twenty yea. Some aspirants to senatorial honoirs may be kept silent by the restraints of office, but the great body of independent or unplaced membes are compelled to recognize the accustomed leptls., M1r. GrADTsoNz has not raised his positicn by the recent displays of his unriyalled oraiwricad powers. In the early part of the Sessin he appeared to be atoning by a judicious silence foitlheintemperance of his unsuccessful attacks oiz the Government; but, although the Estimateg-4ere allowed to pass without comment, the ]&sian debate once more reminded the House t4at i os eloquent ealker was also mot deficient int,st. The Divorce Bill weemed an occasion contrived for the purpose of exhlbiting all Mr. GLADSTONE'S defects. The religious questions which were intro-duced into the debate called forth aU his hairsplitting ingenuity; and the detailed nature of I the discussion in Committee gave abundant oppor- tunities for wrangling and for refining. A con1 siderable minority sympathized with the efforts | wbich were made to defeat the Bill; but fewr among them can have felt that Mr. GLADSTONE'S advocacy had reaUly benefited their cause. Sir R- BETrnzr gained Parliamentary reputation by a readiness equal to that of his untiring adversary. An assailant is expected to be fertile in objections ; but the subtlety which is regarded as vexatious in conducting an attack does credit to the resources of the defence. Mr. DISRir has not gained the Parliamentary ground which has been lost by his rival and recent ally. As a speak-er the Opposition leader becomes more pompous and tiresome as he gains additional confidence from length of tenure. His pretensions to statesmanship have not been confirmed by his principal effort during the Session. No discussion was wanted in a matter on which the nation was unammous inl feeling, and far more anxious to watch events than to ascertain their causes. A military mutiny is not to be talked down, and the mode of suppressing it is altogether irrespective of its origin. A patriot would not have seized the opportunity of dilating on the alleged mistakes of Indian rulers, and he would have carefully avoided any phrases which might seem to identify the interests of the mutineers with those of the Princes and the people of India. It may be added that a judicious party politician would in this and in other cases have assumeed the language of a patriot, but Mir. DIs8B.I, in his anxiety to display his cleverness, too often forgets that it is impossible to be thought wise without appearing to be in earnest. The secondary luminaries of the Conservative Party were from circumstances temporarily obscured. Mr. WALPOLX took a liberal course on the Divorce Bill, and Sir JoHN PAKINGTOX, with laudable candour, supported the admission of Jews into Parliament. The tendency of the most eminent leaders of the party of resistance to imitate Sir ROBERT PENL in his gradual -concessions is curious and instructive. Sir J. PAEIGTON deserved the reward of a fieldday on education, followed by the summary rejection of a Bill which he would without difficulty have obtained leave to introduce; but unfortunately the exigencies of public business and the prolixity of Mr. GainDSTONE on Divorce rendered it impossible to assign a .ay for the triangular dual of Sir J. PAXMGTON, Mx. Hma2v, and Lord J. Rlrssmrt. The veteran Whig Leader has carefullyabstained from renewing the demonstrations against the Government which had helped to precipitate the general election. In the Persian debate Lord J. Russx, without retracting his censures on recent proceedings in the East, expressed disapprobation of Mr. Rosnucx's motion. His resolution, brought forward at the close of Mr. DIsRAELI's essay on India, exhibited something of his ancient readiness in observing and directing the inclination of the House. The victory on the Oaths Bill was too easy to be glorious, and the subsequent attempt to effect the same object without legislation incurred the condemnation of failure. The recent changes in the personal composition of the House of Commons have probably deprived Lord J. RuSSELL of his former confidence in his own power. Although he has apparently no younger rival to dread, it is doubtful whether he will hereafter be able to recover his former position. Sooner or later h., will probably deem it advisable to seek in the Upper House a fresh field of utility and influence. The members of the M,inistry have not been called upon to take a prominent part in the debates. Sir C. WooD has only had occasion to explain various naval details, and to utter a final protest in favour of the ilemened Transit, which will never again call for his apologies. Sir 0. Lxvws was allowed to carry through his financial proposals without much opposition, and the House always listens with respect to a Minister who is perfectly acquainted with the business of his department. The present CHxNcmoR of the ExCHEQUER also enjoys acertain advantage from the contrast between his unpretending statements and the luminous and voluminous orations of his predecessor. That large class of members which habitually accepts Budgets on trust always suspected the soundness of Mr. GLADSTONE'S schemes, because they appeared so plausible, as described in his speeches. Lord PALMExSTON has, perhaps, never succeeded in managing the House of Commons so well as in the present Session. The confidence derived from a large majority may have rendered his task easier, but he also appears to have acquired additional skill from the experience of a Premiership now extending far into its third year. Readiness in explanation, calmness of temper, and judgment in selecting the moment of interference are the first qualities required in the leader of the House of Commons. Lord Pn1rERsToN seldom speaks unnecessarily, and he always speaks with authority. In discussions on foreign policy or on other political questions of pressing interest it is natural that his knowledge and reputation should add peculiar weight to his statements of opinion. A more peculiar opportunity for exhibiting Parliamentary tact was afforded by the debates on the Divorce Bill. The Pnmr MiNisTER left the A'ToRxEY-GrNRRAL to bear the brunt of the battle, but when his subordinate was hard pressed he was always ready to interfere with an effective rebpke to his opponents, or with a welltimed compromise. Prosperity and success are highly favourable to the development of the faculties. Lord PALIEmSTOX is for the first time in his long career at the head of a party as well as of the Government, and he shows that he knows how to maintain his position. His enemies charge him with a disposition to provoke diplomatic quarrels, but the House of Commons uniformly finds him the most temperate and gracious of leaders.
There is no rule without an exception. When Sir JOSHUA REYNiOLDS laid it down that no painting eould look well of which blue was the prominent and engrossing colour GAIN8IBOROUGH painted in defiance the " Blue Boy." We could not get on a day without this maxim. At the tame time exceptions to the rule may be allowed to far that it becomes a question which is the rule and which the exception. Sometimes, when it has been taken quietly for granted a long time that uch anad such is the rule, we become gradually aware of so many exceptions to it that we have suddenly to pull up and ask ourselves fairly which ia the rule. We have been accustomed, for example, to talk about " English honesty." We say that as a nation we are honest. That is the character we give of ourselves. Honesty is one of our adinitted virtues. And we seem to have more than our own testimony to the fact. All over the Continent we offer a bit of paper, and our "C ompte" is instantly settled. " English honesty," then, is allowed. But now come in various awkward facts on the other side. There are those .qonstant mercantile exposures-the British Bank affair, just over; the Great Northern Railway and London and Eastern Bank crashes, now before us; 'the Surrey Gardens affair, the delinquencies at Liverpool. Then there is the. confessed wholesale adilterationx£ food What aza we tosay to theae. facts? How are we to admit them without peril 1o our motto of "English honety r' "Beware of universals," said the philosopher. This caution is so generaUy admittoa that when we make universal assertions we make them commonly with the tacit understanding that they are not to be taken. universally. Whatever has been X said about English honesty, no Englishman in his senses ever denied that there was a great deal of dishonesty in England. That was taken for ! granted as the simplest fact. There is no Royal | road to virtue here any more than elsewhere. Honesty is tried, and honesty gives way, our gaols, our hulks, our reformatories, our penal settlements testifying to the fact. But it will be said that there must be something more than this very simple fact, which everybody has always admitted, involved in these tremendous exposures; that dishonesty is prominent now, that it is a conspicuous fact, a fact of the day, whereas it once skulked behind the wall, and dared not show its face. We reply that there is notbing more whatever. Everybody knows that there are a great many dishonest men in England. That never has been a secret. The speculative freedom, the fertility, the energy, the pliancy of trade, the boundless resources and conveniences at its command, the demand which capital creates for investments, all conspire nowr to give these men opportunity and room for the exercise of their craft. They come forward with swelling projects, which make a great noise and attract lists of shareholders, and operations are conducted for some time on a large scale, till a crash comes. People then speak of the gigantic, the enormous, the colossal fraud; and they are very right; but the impression is produced that there is an enormous number of culprits, whereas the enormity is in the fraud itself-not in the number of the agents. We will venture to say that in most of these cases the real conspirators have not amounted to onefourth part of the number sacred to thieves. A knot of half-a-dozen men gets itself upon a Board of Directors, and forthwith becomes the managing centre of that Board and of the whole company. No other man can get in a finger. A shareholder of a railway complains that the room from which the formal decisions of the company issued is too smnall to hold a fourth of the shareholders, and those who attend might as well be away for anything they can really do. The programme is prearranged, a succession of glib speakers propose and second, everybody who gets up to doubt or oppose is declared out of order, and a packed meeting ratifies the schemes of the knot. Mr. Coorsiu's aflidavit on the Surrey Gardens case gives a picture of a court of shareholders. First, they were totally ignorant of what was coming before the meeting, being exprewsly told that nothing but ordinary business would be discussed This notice kept numbers away altogether; those who came, having been kept waiting " in the large concert " room" till the moment for action arrived, were informed that the committee and lunch were in an adjoining room, upon which a door opened and disclosed " a plentiful supply of sandwiches "and wine" at one end tf a table and a bundle of accounts at the other. It need not be said which attracted moat immediate notice-that the shareholders rushed upon the sandwiches, leaving the bundle for subsequent inspection. A gentleman then rose up and moved that " the account be received, " approved, and adopted"-a resolution which was carried, or asserted by the secretary to be carried; and Mr. CooBzs, on perusing in the course of the evening one of this bundle of papers, discovered that the meeting had unconsciously passed a sum of 14,0001. purchase-money to Mfr. Corpocz for Ili years' lease of the Gardens. It should be added that besides the sandwiches a dividend of ten per cent, upon the profits of an insolvent company had also been employed as an expedient to soothe the feelings of the meeting. Such is the real part which shareholders are allowed to take in the administration of these gigantic concerns. A very few persons-in the Surrey Gardens case they appear reducible to two -make an immense number of dupes; but the imagination, when we talk off-hand about these colossal frauds, confounds the knaves and tce dupes together. The thousand innocent men who have been taken in swell the aggregate of dishonesty; whereas the only crime the mass has really committed is that of losing their own money, the dishonesty residing in a small central fccus. The pathetic complaints of M. JuL.EM are echoes from the depth of innocent shareholding suffering, and show how true and faithful confidence is rewarded in this world-a confidence which actually preferred his company's check to his own money taken up at night to his own room by his own ticket-keeper. The shareholder is, indeed, the very type of childlike innocence and guilelessness, and it is most cruel that he should be made to swell our aggregate of dishonesty. His griefs ought to be immortalized in elegiacs, and the lyre ought to breathe its most plaintive strains whenever it touches upon his grievances; but he should not be classed among the national criminals. It is not so easy to defend " English honesty" when we come to the fact of the large adulteration of food. Hlere is undoubtedly a caee in which whole classes of tradesmen behave dishonestly. The public, it is true, which is the most numerous party, is the dupe, and not the culprit; still the culprit class is very large. How are we to reconcile this fact with " English honesty ?" We will not, for our part, make the attempt, but are wiling to confess, as far as it goes, a blo0 upon the national name. It is MozmrAioxE, we think, woo saysythat you never can tell from one characteristic of a man that he may not show at certain times, or in particular ways, the very opposite one. Thia is a philosopher's opinion of our inconsistent natare. Many and many a man is rmlly extremely honest, and may be thoroughly trusted in ninety-nine things out of a hundred, but in the hundredth he fails. HIe has bis dishonest corner, which has never been swept. Nor must we forget that "English honesty," while it still, we trust, at bottom and in the mein continues a lawfl boast, is severely tried by the increased competition and hard struggles of modern trade. The gripe of real pecuniary want is a sharp trial, which nobody knows bow he will stand till he is brought to the test. Meanwhile, if a satirist is severe upon modern trade and its infirmities and irregularities, he m lst aleo remember that no classes of tramesmen, however large, are ever discovered in depattures from honesty without public indignation being excited. The public standard of honesty keeps up in spite of all prtial faUings away from it, and feela itself scandalized whenever particular claues do not conform. If we have the shame of the crime, then we must have the credit ofj the punishment of it. The national mind, if it allows itself ever to fall, is at the same time its own restorer.

SECOND EDIflQN* H TIM OFFIE, S,tursy fmitng . -~~ ~~~~ . ..'... IVI U T I N I. E S,. IN I TN -D I-A,.-. By the arrival of the Overland Mhil we bate received our private correspondence and paperi from Bombay to July 30th; Calcutta, July 20th; and Hongkong July loth. The following is the letter of our Bombay corre-.. spondent, dated Bombay, July 30:- "S closed my last letter with a aomewhat oonfident expression of hope that when next I wrote I should be able to announce to you the capture of Delhi. In that expectation I was not singular. It was shared by those best able by receipt of accurate information to reflect the opinions of parties nearer to the scene of action than we are here. But there soon appeared rea3On to beliove that we had been too sanguine in assigning so early a date for-the fall of the rebel stronghold; and for many days now' I have been prepared to repeat the old story that, by our latest accounts, Delhi still holds oat agaist Us. The reinforcements, indeed, of which I spoke in my last, have reached our camp-one wing of the 8th (King's), one of the 61st, a oompany of Foot Artillery, Major Olphert's troop of Horse Artilery, and two guns of a native troop, the 17th Irregular Cavalry (escorting a large ammaunition train), the 2d Punjab Cavalry, the 1st Punjab Infantry, and the 4th Sikh Infantry; but the native portion of the troops thus added to the besieging force are not entirely and uniformly trumtworthy, brigaded though they are with Europea. The Sikha and indigenous Punjabees, indeed, one may venture, even in these days of delusion and disaffection, to pronounoe true as steeL They are doing excellent 'service, showing themselves on all I oocions zealous and eager to encounter the Sepoya, towards whom they entertain a national feeling of animosity which has been stimulated by a report, true or falbe, that the mutineers have mardered all people of Sikh extraction that have fallen into their hands. Even with the Ghoorkhas of the Sirmoor battalion, who 'fight magnificently' or the Guide Corps, which 'is the admiration of every one,' (I quote priviite letters from the camp,) these Excellent soldiers will hardly lose by comparison. But the cavalry regiments of the Panjab force contain many Mussulmans and high-caste Hindoos, from Hindostan (Proper) eud Rohilcund, while the Bengal Irregular Cavalry regiments are mainly composed of such elements. These men are as a clas utterly disloyal, and their presence with the force in any numbers must be embarrassing. And so it has proved. In the 2d Panjab Cavalry it has been found necessary to disarm some 70 Bindostan men and to hang three, one a superior native officer. The 17th Irregulars have not, so far as we have heard, behaved amiss yet, but of the 9th Irregularz, which have been some time with the force, several troopera have deserted, and the 4th Irregulars have, I believe, murdered their adjutant, While on detachraent duty. Still the strength of the army is respectable, no doubt. There are three infantry brigades, each about 2,000strong, commanded by Colonels Showers of the Company's army, Long, field of the 8th, and Jones of the 61st (the senior Lieutenant-Colonel of the 8th). - Hartley, after bringing the wing of his regiment to Delhi went to UTmballah, to fill the post of brigadier, vacant by the death of Colonel Halifax (from cholera). Tne cavalry and artiUery are also in considerable strength, the field branch of the latter arm especially. But it has not been considered prudent to hazard an assault before the place. For although an attack would probably be successful, although that is to say an entrance would be, with whatever loss, effected by escalade, still the difficulties attendant upon the complete subjugation and occupation of a city nine miles in circumnference, containing 150,000 inhabitants mainly hostile to the assailants, and large numbers of armed and disciplined mutineers are not lightly to be encountered. Let us for the present be coatent to know that our little force holds in check the great body of the mutineers of the Ben,gal army; that it will shortly receive farther reinforcements of English and Sikh troops from the Panjab; that the enemy, though largely augwented in numbers, have never yet shown themselves outside the walls without being repulsed with heavy loss; that there are intern.l disensions among them, and that they must Io suffering severely, not only from our shot and shell, but from fever and cholera, while our camp is comparatively healthy. When the not far-off day of final reckoning arrives God will defend the right. I may appear, perhaps, unduly vehement and vindictive. I endeavour to write temperately, but I assure you it is no easy matter to preserve a uniform tone of -unimpassioned narration when op. prcssed by the recollection of the hundred treacheries end murders and horrors unutterable that have been perpetrated by the rebels since the Meerut outbreak on the 10th of May. "In my last I brought down the journal of the .iege to the 27th of June, when the mutineers made their first appearance oubzide the city, after the severe handling they met with on the 23d. The fighting on this day, though lasting some houre, was confined to the outposts, and ceased towards the afternoon, when a heavy fall of rain, the first of the season, occurred. The two following days were quiet, but on the 30th the enemy showed themselves in fc rce among the enclosures on our right, and gave our pickets and supports a long morning's wo-k, in the course of which we lo3t a promising young officer, Lieutenant Yorke, of the late 3d Native Infantry. On the next day, the ist of July, there was observed from the EngL;sh lines, on the ridge, a large ercampment on the further Eide of the Jumnua, and opposite to Delhi. It was the whole body' of the Robi!cund mutineers from the three stations of Bareilly, bgiora.dabad, and Shabjehanpoor, four regiments of irfanthy, one of iFregular cavAjqy, and a battery oC arttLlery. For a time it had been boped, as I wrots a fol tDight ago, that tbey world find theGung imp-8sable, but the anticipated rise of the river did not take place-it wr.n crossed at Gurmukte.er, the usuMl p!ace of psasage, the Dorab was traversed and Delhiwsas attained.

An immediate attack on the part of the reinforcements was anticipated frotm the known practice of the insurgents in regard-to new arrivals. Accordingly, on the atemoon of the 3d they came out in force and threatened the rght rear of the English position. But, finding ourmpe well prepared, they drew off and marh w & Y1 severalmiles to our rear along the Kurnaulroadas far as Alipore, the place where our arny bivouacksthe night befor the advace upon WDehi and the irbrush withi the enemy., Theyfhought,'it-is up posed, to. meet and capture a tr of Iat -athat Was under v.niVo'to'

The IJnitd State' mail steamship Baltie, Captain Eootock arrixed 1031Braornimg with advice from TfewYork to the 16th instant, and $841,000 in specia. On leaving her moorings at the Novelty Works, on the 16tha she grounded on a mulabank, and was detained till the following day. Two steamers-the J. W. Harrir and the Metr6polia-came iato coUllsion near blawe York, and the former immediately sank, and only11 out of 27 persons on board were saved. the captain lost his three children. An affecting incident1nitelstion to t hls catastrophe is mentioned in a Newr York paper. " An old gray.headed gentleman came inktotbe<ipper sialoon of the Metropolis, where Captain Simith ws siting at a table naking thi euserd to savera rtorte: ad, walking up to the captain, re?ched out his band, wli graspe= by that of Captain Smith, who said, 'How dq you do, Mr. Gordon?' at the same time aveg his face from that of Mr. Gordon. the vaseot tbeelb geii eeny b the tears which began to trickle down hi8 fa. bhe old gentleman, in a tremulous voice, and *ithout answer. ang the captain's interrogatory, said, II came to sk &boat my dwhter, 'were Is dhe! is bhe alive, or not?' 'She is gone,' replied the captein, which announcement seemed to be too aush for the poor man, who exclaiming, ' Oh, my God, do you tell me so, is it poible'e sank dowu into u seat and wept like a cbild for several minutes, during which time there was not a dry eyein the saloon. He had a few words moro with Mr. Gordon, in relation to the sad affair, wbo then~retired from. I thC cbin eeplnv meet bitterly. Captain Smith then returned to the table at which the reporters were sitting, and. addressing them, said- She was a most beutiful girl only 18 years of age, and only to think her father brought I her doen to m7 'ouoas las evening and gave her Into my charge to take to her friends in Neir London, but now she has gone wvith my children, I hope to a better world.'" Lengthy descriptions of a fife given to Mr. Pea.. body, of London, by Mr. Wetmore at Newport oecupy the papers. That in the ?Vevw york Times a headed as follows .

A letter from Plaeentis B, Newfondand, states that the Newfoundland Telegraph Company purpose changing the route of their line. The company have already expended uipwarda of on this iWand, including the short submarine cable to Cape Breton, running along the whole southern front of the island, from St. John's in the eastern to Point au Basque in the western end of the island. From here a submarine lino of 74 miles carries it to Cape Breton, then overland to the Gut of Canso, whi&h it paeas with a 'ubm%rino cable of two miles,-it connects with the established lines of Nev Brunswick and Maine. Three years were employed in the completion of the island portion, commencing in 1854 and finishing in October, 1856, vrorking owith 600 men during five months of every year. The labour was immeuse, cutting amend as they went tbrough 400 miles of parfect wilderness. The experience of three years has proved that it is almost impossible to kep up this ummense extent of line through an almost perfect -wilderness during tbe storms and ice of a Newfoundland winter. The connexion is broken after every storm, so that the company has now resolved, int}e event of the success of the ocean telegraph, to lay another submarine line, either to the rnainland of Nova Scotia, or even to the States themselves To test thepractcabiity of this the steaer ArCtj had been despatched to make a careful examination of Trinity Bay. It is a deep indentation of the northern shore, separating the eastern peinan'a of Newrfondlald from the main island. General Rusk, a ;nember of the IUnited States, Senate, had committed suicide at AlemAdria by shooting himself through the head with a rifle. According to the New York Rerald Lord Napier Is said to be urging upon our Government the necessity of sending moyev essels to the coast of Mrica eto ssist in suppressiug the slave trade. Tlhe numnbor of gnus we nowi maintain there is 63, while by the A#hburton treaty tbe numbaer should be 80. This is csused by the fact that seve I ra of the veese3a kx%eb}e o\?figed to ease 'home from the expiration of the term of enlistmient of their crews, and the Secretary of thie Navy has not had any vessels with whioh he could replace them.

RAILWAY ACCIDENTS 0- TO THE EDITO R OP TfB TMS. Sir,-In the late acwident on the Brighton line at Redhill, by which the usual amount of shaldngs and bruises, but happily no fatal injuries, h&ve been received, a Bi6hQp Inconvenienoed, and " rather forcibly" demanding compensa. tion, may have the effeot of fixing tho attention of the au thorities on the necessity of keeping up a commnunicatioa between the engine-driver and guard by some means tha5 will "work" when required, and otherwise providing for the safety and comfort of travellers. But, Sir, the result of this accident, by whioh the engine and certain of the carriages were thrown off the line, nata. rally causes one to speculate on the means of escape under such a circumstance, and calaS to mindP a vory mnpleasat practice that exists of locldng all the doors next the platform before starting, the opposite doors being left unlocked for thbe exit of pasengers at the various intermediate stations. But as the windows, too, in some carriages are strongly defended by brass baus, in case of an upset or overturn on the only unlocked side, what chance would the terrified pas. sengers have of getting out until released, perbaps after great delay?

THE UTED STATEA. I (nwxsL OUI3 O0WN2 ~OO3SJWO2rDMNT.) NEW YORK, AAYG 15. The Central America, from Aspinwall, with San Franceio dates to the 20th of July, and' with $1,241,055 treasure, arrived hero the day before yesterday. Her news is more important than anythig thatwe have had from thePacific coast forsom- time. The Democratic party, who are largely in tha majority, have declared in favour of paying the uaconatitutiotoal debt. A private letter from a friend whose political affinities are republican says," The Democratic Convention, thanks for it, has repudiated repudiation, and advocated honesty. This settles the question, for all the 'regular Democratic tickets' will have 'aye' on them. Bad as you may hold us in New York, I never did believe that the people of California ever would submit to repudiation." With the Democratic vote in favour of the recognition of the debt [ fancy that there will be little doubt of the result. 'California is not going to place herself bythesideof Miehigan, Florida, and Mississippi. The news from Central America, which country may be regarded as the pivot on which the Americaa foreign policy turns, is interesting, though rather as foreshadowing events of greater importance thaa as of any immediate importanceitself. TheTennessee had arrived out, and it was stated that the Nicaragua transit route was again to be openedunder nev auspices. The correspondent of the New York Times rmakes some curious statements as to the number of men that perished in Walker's expediw tion. He says that- "The books of the old accessory Transit Company of Charles Morgan and Sons prove thAt no less than7,00o men have been shipped ap the San Juan, river, and 3,500 received from California. Mr. Bortwick; late Secretary o' State to General Walker, tells me that he can prove, by documentay evidence, tbht no less than 5,700 Filibuster bave found their graves in Nicaragua." The jurisdiction of the Isthmus and the settlement of the pending difficulties with New Granada also occupy the attentior of the President at Washington. One of the morning journals had yesterday the following telegraphic despatch from its Washington correspondent: "General Herran and Secretary Cass have closed tbelr informal conferences on the New Granadian treaiy, and the result will be reduced to writing, and tho treaty concluded, it is supposed, during the next week. The only points of difference 'oetween the negotlators were the transit dutie aud the postal arrangements. General Herran submitted big proposition on those points yesterday, but if not acceptable to our Government he agrees to subscribe to the niews of General CasS.' This seems explicit and satisfactory. But, unfortunately, another correspondent of another morning paper, writing from the same place, at the same time, says:- " The negotiation 'with General Herran prooeeds slowly and unsatisfacto-ily. New Granada refues to grant jurisdihtion over the railroad route, or the use of the islands for naval stations, or to seoure payment of an adequate indem. nity. It is understood that General Cass wll nake s peremptory demand, of which Berran's instructions will prevent his acceptance, and that diplomatic interoourse wil tlhen cease." These extracts show how much confidence is to b 3 placed in telegraphic correspondence. The negtiations at Washington have neither been progressing unsatisfactorily nor is there any presea, appearance that they wiUl be brought to a close. Ont the contrary, I know that they are going on well, and I think that from outside causes thLere ii every probability that the present differences will not be entirely disposed of before the opening of Congress. The parties interested on each side will endeavour to bring things to a close before then, but I do not believe they will succeed in doing so. General Cass is averse to any acquisition of territory on the Isthmus. He has been and will be very hardly pressed to acquire at least enough for a naval station at each end of the Panama route, whic4 is justly represented to him as substantially an American route and of more interest to the United Stetes than to any other Power. These views are urged with great force in Washington. Mfeanwhile the Government of New Granada shows a disposition to take into its own hands the proteetion of the Isthinus and the safety of the passengers. Admitting i the want of a proper force to quell the Panalmn riots, by which so many lives were sacrificed, it no w prOpOSes to place the jurisdiction of the route in the hands of a special officer, whose force, however, the railroad compsny are to be called upon to pay. Thus the foreigner whose energy and eaterprise lhave p-t new life into the sluggish blood of Panama has increased the rental of its real estat§ more than sixfold, has swelled its imports from $160,000 to $1,600,000, and has made it everything that it is, is to be called upoa to pay for the additional cost of administration which the new and improved state of things renders necessary. Heavy duties are also still contemplated upon the products entered for domestic consumnptiop, upon the same excellent principle of econoeny. The Panama Railroad Company also complain of the attempts of the Government of New Granada to violate the fundamental contract with the company. And on the whole the coraplications of the Central Amerieari qauestion are so great that I question, as I have already- said, w-hether it will be deemed ad- visable to determine them before the Ineeting of I Congress. Still this is but a matter of personal opinion. In might have added, while noticing a few of the benefits which the people of the Isthmus have received from the infusion of a little active blood i among them, the advance in wages from something like 20 cents a day to a dollar. This, however, naturally comes with the prosperity that has rooted the grams from the streets of Panama, and lined them with capacious and well-filled stores. The Missouri election has unexpectedly terminated in the choice of Rollins, the independent antislavery candidate, This is one of the most important political results within my recollection. The question was directly presented to the people of a slave State whether they would celect a man who would not resist a project for emancipation, and it has been decided that they will not. This foreshadows emancipation in Missounri. It does not necessarily follow that any other slave State will do the same thing. When Kansas is made a free State Missouri will be bounded on three sides by free States. Her slave property, from this circumstance, becomes uncertain, as it may take to itself wings any day, and, in fact, does so whenever it pleabes. Dred Scott was immortalized from that State, and still lives there in amazement at his own glory. The soil at Missouri, its climate, and its productions are as much adapted to free as to slave labour. Hemp, tobacco, and Indian corn are its ataple agricultural products; but its commerce and its manufactures promise to be of greater value than its agriculture. St. Louis, the depot of the former, is near the junction of the Missoturi and Misissippi, with an inland navigation of thousands of miles in every direction, With great accumulated wealth, a large tonnage, an promises to become the great city of the interior . r this country. The mouatains at Missouri are full of mineral wealth-rich to a proverb-and want !only to be struck with the hand of well-directed industry to yield a stream of wealth. The pop.rtion df the eastern part of the State is youtx and largely from the free States. It is easy to see that all these causes might easily bring about in Missouri a feeliDg in favour of emancipation not sriared by the other frontier States. Neither di dMr. Rollins press his claims entirely on this ground. In a part of his last speech at St. Louis he solicited the votes of his listeners on another ground which strongly appealed to the sympathies of a young comaunity, however great a political beresy it may seem in an over populated country. He said, substantially, " There is my opponent, gentlemen, a bachelor, who has contributed nothing to the population of Missouri, and population is what Missouri wants. I, on the contrary, have a beautiful wife and seven lovely childre,' all born naMissour.," and the brazen throats of the crowd . Lre filled with one hurrah of approval. The stock-market has again "'caved" in, mnder the questionable action of the Miehigan Southern Board, in regard to their stock.

"On the 5th of July an obstinate battle was fought before Agra between the garrison of that place and theNeemuch mutineers, who had marched tbither, with reinforcementa, which brought their numbers up to 10,000 men.

TiE MASSA CRES A T CA WNPOBE A.YD A RA. 4iajor-General Sir Hugh Masy Wheeler, XC.B., whose melancholy death at Cawnpore haa followed so closely upon the losses which we have sustaned in the persons of Sir H. M. Lawrence and General Barnard, was one of the mogt distinguished officers in the Indian servico, as he prove4 in the Sikh var. He was the sOn of the Iate Captain Hugh Wheeler,-of the Indian army, and grandson of Mr. Frank Wheeler, of Bllyrire, county of Limerick, by Magaret, eldest daughter of the Right Ron. Hugh, first Lord assy in the Irish Peerage. He was himslf born at Ballywir i 1789, so that at the time of his death he had reached his 68th year. He received his early edncation at Richmond, Sarrey, znd at the Grammar School, Bath. He entered the military ervice of the East India Company in 1803, when he teceived his fiNt oomniisdon in the Bengal Inz fantry. In the next year he mruched with his regiment, under Lord Lake, against Delhi. Having risen steadily through the intermediate ranks, he becamo colonal of the 48th Bengal Native Infantry in 1846, and in the same year was appointed first-class brigadier, in command of field forces; in 1854 he attained the rank of major-general In Deoembor, 1845, previouts to the hard-fought hattles of Moodkee and Ferozesbah, the gallant General (then Bri. gadier) Wheeler, with a force of. 4,500 nn and 21 guns' covered the villago of Bassean, where the large depot of stores hadbeen collected for the army under Sir Henry Hardinge, Lord Gough, and Sir Harry Smith, and thus rendered important services wtich contributed in their mesure to the gaining of those victories. fe received the order of the Doranee Empire in 1848, and was honoured a few years since for his distinguished merits by being ap. pointed on of the aides-de.-omp to Her Majesty. Having been repeatedlytbanked bythe Governor-General and Comrnander.in-Chief for his valuable eervices in the Sikb cam. paigns and in the conquest of the Punjab, he was created a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1850, and since thse time has held command of the district of Ca-upore. The Indian despatches during the war in the Punjab show that these honoura were by no mnans cheaply earned by Goneril Wheeler. In October, 1848, he effete the reduction of the strong fortress ef Rungur Nuggul with the loes of only a single man, and by his conduct on this occasion earned the warmrest approval of Lord Gough, then Commander-in Chlef, who formaly congratulatea the Brigadier on the result, which, ir his opinion, was " eptirely to be ascribed to the soldier-like and jtdicious arrangments of that gallant offieer." In the following mouth of govem. ber, in t despatbch addtessed to the Governor-G6neral, I,ord Goigh states that he " has directed tho Ad. jsstant-Geperal to convey to Brigadier-General Wheeler his hearty oungratulations and tban}s for the iuportant servicesi which he and the brave troops under his command have rendered in the reduction of the fortres3 olf ullalwalhas" again with the loss of only one man killed and five wbunded. Again, in a despstch from the Adjuttaut. General to the Governor-General, dated "Camp before Chilitawallah, January 30,1849," it is stated that Brigadier Wheeler, in command of thb Punjab Division and of tho JaUlundur field force, supported by Major Batler and Lieu. tenant Hodson, assaulted and captured the heights of Dcli in the course of his operations against the rebel Pam Singh, in spite of the difficalties presented by rlvers almost unfordable and ihonntains deerne dimpregnablo. And, finally, isR the general order isued by him on the receipt of the despatch of Sir W. Gilbert, X.CB., announcing the termination of hostilities in the Punjab, the Governor-Genera thus expresses himself :-" Brigadier-General Wheeler C.B., has oxecuted the several duties which have been committed to him with great skill and scocess, and the Governor. General has been happy in being able to convey to him his thanks tLas pub3icly." It only remais to be added that, unlike Sir Henry Law,ence, Sir James Ontram, aud most othet distinguished Indian officers, the services and reputation of Genra! Wheeler were almost wholly of a military character, and that he does not appear to have been employed in politica or diplomatic situaitions. But even if this be so, the mill. tary reputation which he has left behind bim is of the highest order. Brigadiet General A. Jack entered the Compauy's servioe in 1823, and was appointed Colonel of the 42d Regiment of Bengal Light Infantry in 1851. At the time of his death he was inzcommand of the mitaxy station at Cawmpore. Colonel Wlliams, whose namne is mentioned in the list of rictlxs.who fell at Cahwpore, we presune must be Colonel S. WiUiams, of the 56th Bengal Native Infantry which was stationed at that city. He entered the army in 1820, and served with distinction till hia appoint. ment as lieutenant colonel of his regiment in 185i. Captain 'Sir George Parker, arst., entered the military servsce of the East India Company In 1831, and was ap. pointed captain of the 74th Bengal Native Infantry in 1845. He vas joipt magistrate atMeersat,and in charge of Abkaxee in 1847. He appears to have been in the civil employ of the Coopany at the time of his death at Cawnpore. We feir ie can do nothing to relieve the anxiety which nmust exist until it is kmown definitely who is the Colonel Lindsaiy returned as klled. The list is evidently quite incorrect with regard to both names and military ranks, and as in the Bengal service there are aeveral of the name of Liadsay, the most painful uncertainty must be endured until the arrival of details. The same remarks will apply to the officers named Quin ad Smith.. Colonel Prout we fear must mean Major W. RB.1rout of the 56,h Native lnfantry, whiah w as tationed at Cavfnpore. Fe nutered' tho East India; Company's service in 1839, and received his majority in 1854. The officer named Redman, who is also returned as killd, seems evidently to be Lieutenant F. Redman of te 1st Regiment of Native Infantry. His regiment was stationxed at Cawipore. The offlicer inenticned ma Colonel Supple appears on reference to the Bengal -Army List to bOeEnsign in the 1st Native Infanhty, which was stationed at Cawnpore. He entered the Company's service in 1856. Captain W. L. Halliday ntered the Bengal service in 1842, and was maAe Captinof the 56th Bengal Native Iafantry in 1853. The regiment was stationed at Cawnpore, Tbe Colonel Reynolds in the list appears to be a Captain J. H. Reynolds, of the 53d Regiment of BeDgal Native Infan3ry, :wh was also stationed at Cawnpore. Heenterod the service in 1838, and becmae captain in his regiment in Colonel Prole is W. J. Prole, a lieutenant of the 584 Bengal lIative Infant, which regiment was statinoed at Cawnpo". He entered the Company's service in 1854. Colonsl Bckford, C.B., was colonel of the 56th BegimeInt of Bongil Oative TIfantry. He entered the asviae In 1804, and obtained his regimant in 1848. 'ieC4lcnel Dempeter, mentioned in the list seems to be Dr. Dempaer, a superintendent surgeon of the Bengal rsmy, who wad' stationed at Cawnpore. The dato of his appoint. ment to that staion is 1854. The ColonelJervis of the list, we fear, refers to Captain F. V. R. Jervis, of the 56th Bengal Native lIufatry. He entered the Company's service in 1842. no e Colema ChAlwiu ia tno doubt the terinary sr8U 'ttsched to the Ist bigade of Ariyer tationed PA Co- pore, athere is none other of that name in the Bsrgqp service, In the fearful druggle which appears to have tAka before Agra between the garrison of that plce and tbe Neemuebh mutineers many gallant oflicers are tepork&lto have falen. Major Thomas Is evidently Captaut G T. Thomas, of the 3d Etaropean Regiment, which was stationed at Agra Of the two names which immediately follow that of Captain Thomas-Oaptain D'Oyly and Lieutenant Lambe-there are several of the same designation and rankin the Bengal service, and which of them had been advanced to Agra at the time of the engagement it is impossible to aay. Lieutenant A. Pond was of the 3d Europeaa Regi. mnei.t, now stationed at Agra, as was also Lieutenant C. 3 N. Fellows. The Compan3's civil service list affords no clue as to who, was the gentleman named " O'Connor," wvho is reported to have fallen. There is a deputy pol lector at Barelly named C. Horn, but none at Agr& whie we find no mention of any one of the name of P Hlora or "Carlton." The gentleman naned " Smith' Eeems to be Mr. A. Smith, Assistant Under- Gommissioner of Bavenue at the Meerut station, but there is also a gentleL named A. C. Saath, who holds a similar appointment at Rohilcund. It is imupossible to conjecture who is the gentleman named -Jordan" in the return, as his name does not appear in the civll serrioe ILt of any of the three presidencies. There is also no gentleman named 'Prendergast" ia the Bengal civil servtoe, though there are two in that of Madras The same obeesrvaion will apply to the nane of "Whiteray." There ig aB. W. Black, who ranks as Asdstant AdjutantGeneral in the Artiery staff of the Madras service. There ara no suchinames ag s Burdbrank!' or " Freeze" in the civi servioclist of any of the preaidencies The "Ontram" evi. demly refers to Francis Boyd Ontram, Assistant Under. -Commissioner of Reveanue, Della Dividon. The "Olddeld" is doubtless Richard C. Oldfield, Asist. ant-BSooretary to Governmen' and Assistant-Accounant North-Western Provinces. There is no such name as " Deedes" in the Ocvil service of any presidency. Captain Bishop 'was of the 46th lNgtive Infantry, and stationed at Sealcote He was appointd in 1838, and ob. tabed his captaincy in 1953. Dr. J. C. Graham wfas medcal storekeeper at Sealcote. There Is no rmention made in any East India Directory of ,he Rev. Mr. Hunter being stationed at Sealoote, neither do we find the nime in the hlt of the chaplains in the4ervioe of the 3tast India Company. Lieutenant-Colonel Brlud C.B., who is maentioned as wounded, entered the East Idi Companys service In 1820, and was appointed to the oommanQd at Sealcote With tho acting rank of brigadier in 1853. With regard to the reported massare at Seetapore, there are sueh a number of officers of all ranks nared Bird in the Bengal service, not one of 'whom appears in the Compsny'slistas stationed at Seetapore,that it is impossible to hazard a conjecture as to 'who is the officer referred to in the telegraphio despatch. There is, or was unfortunately, a Lieutenat G. Snel, of the lOth Infantry,stationed at Seetapore'who seems to bethe officer refeired to above. A Rev. Mr. Govin also appears in the Company' list of chaplains stationed at Saugar. There are two lieutenants named Bax in the Bengal arny, bat one of them is reported on fumlough, the other, G. J. Bax, of the 48th Native infantry, is stationed at A4ahabad, There is also a Lieutanant H. R. Christian, of the 68th Native Infantry, stationed at Bareifly. It wll be seen from these numerous errors 'which eris as to the rxmes and ranks of the officers and civilians men tioned iD she telegraphic despatch that its details cannot be entirely depended upon. It is, however, much to be feared that ia the mDain it will prove but too correct.

Yecterday mnorning Her Majesty, accompanied by his Royal Highness the nince Consort, their Royal HighneBses the Princem Royal, princess Alice, Prince Arthur, and the Princenses Helena and Louisa, and attended by the usual suite, started at 8 o'clock in the Royal train for Scotland.

Her M1ajesty, the Prince Consort, famnly, and suite arrived at Edinbargb at 6 28, twelve minutes before they were expected. The evening wMs very beautifal and elear, and thousands Were assombled on the parks -mid hillside to greet the Royal party in passing to the Palace.

COURT CIRCULAR. Baron de Wydonbrnck, for many years First Secretary of the Austrian l:mbassy at the Court of St. James's, left town yestorday after a short sojourn. The Barou's de. parture was hastened for the ceremony of the christening of his son, for whom his Royal Highnes" the Duke Augustas of Saxe Coburg Goths stands godfather. The report that Baron de Wydaubruck came to London on a special mission respeeting the question of tho Danubian Principalities is void of foundation.

THI INDIAN T I ------ M. - . , I: The following is au extract from j letbr WHOt at Dinapore, June so, by ani ofnee of the!6th Ofade - Irregular Infantry "TQ*e troops zoetinied here on thie .eb of Snpday. t Sthqf June. Capain Gordon nd inymadf erpernesorsi the quarter-guard all night. About 3 Aecock on th morning of the 9th we were told to prepare to go to the river, and were only Allowed to take a chauge of elothm, when we were put on board a little country boat and told to sbhift for ourselves. There rere foar boat and in one of them were our Colonel, Captain Gordon, myself, and me of}icer of the Artillery, and one of the 22d. Colone Goedney and the remaining officers were in the other boat. In this manner we started. Before we hbad got far down the riser we saw the oflieers of the 22d had got into an English- cutter, and were saiing away at a great rate, so wr put ian shore and got a lager bet and some boatEuen to pulL In the afternoon we passed them, and on we wrent until we camne eur , fort called Tandah, by which no boats are allowed to go and ail BEropeans killed A;s we passed down Yhe miver we had to lie in the bottom of the boat; for if we had teen recognized we should have been murdered. About ai miles below Adjudheawe were ordered to go ashore by some poloemen, but we told the boatmen to go ahead as if they did not hear them, whereupon they said they would shant un; but vwe still kept on, as we had a good stiff breeze in our favour. About dix miles further we came upon the rear. uard of the 17th Native Infsntry, whichl was marching 'owardN Fyzabad, and here they had musket piled and sentries who looked and shouted bt the boat, but, not seeing a y Europeans, did not make much noise. Two miles fur. theron we saw six Irregular Cavalrymen on the bank of the river, and although tbey looked hard at the boat, eand shouted, yet none fired. When within two miles of Tandak we bad to halt until dark, so e to pas the fort; here Captain Gordon's bearer and one of the boatmen ran away, ancd I had to bring the only servant we had and the four remaining boatmen down the bank into the boat at the point of my. sword; tking toI them] was of nouse. FassingTaudahwehadtogowithi2Oyardsof the shore. The water was so shalloww e could see tbe natives cooking and hear them talking, yet it was too dark ior them to see us. The forts at this plae extend for about 14 miles dovn the river. Just as we had got past the raooan iosw. While passing we came within five yrd of a bo6t, but our boatmen happened to know those of the other boat, to they Asked where each other were going, and never saw us at the bottom of the boat. Captain Gordon's servant was rlmost frightened to death, and I had the greatest difficulty in keeping him quiet. A nigger is a great cowar2d when. danger is near. As soon sa day began to break we had to lie by a sandbank, for there were sOrne more forts, sad we v ere within two rmiles of the first fort We had nothing t° Iat the whole of the day before, and now our food wa llour and water baked in a fire with dried oows dung, and muddy water to drink We remained there until 4 p.m., when we were suddenly surprised to see about 50 villagers ranning with All their might towards us-some with guns, others with swords, and the remaluder with clubs; we immediately put into the stream and cocked our pistols, saw the rascals run into the water breast high, when. tbey stopped and flied A volleyat us; but fortunately without effect. It was too evident the whole country had risen, and that escape Across the country was impossible. After pulling a short way down the river the aatives, seeing they eould not get at us, ceased their pursuit. We then haltedl until dark to enable us to pass tbe forts; often the boatmen. told us not to whisper, but to keep down ready for an attack, for we had often to go close in shore, and were determinedto fight through if possible. Next morning we had to stay in a cr6ek close by a village called Gola; but before arriving there we were made to put in shere at a large village, where we paid 10 rupees to a policeman to let us off. The boatmen said it was no use firing, the rupees would anwer much better. Before the polioemas. put his head into the boat the men told him it was a 'yana,' bat as soon as he got into the boat and saw five fellows armed to the teeth he was well pleased to take the 'dibs,' and shouted for us to proceed immediately. The people on shore shouted out for him to rob the boat, but he knenw better. At Gola we were so tired that we all fell asleep, and upon my awaking I discovered tha.t all the boat. men and our only servant had ran away, taking with them the fevw rupees we had. However, there was a large village close by, where a native prince and an'ineigo planter (a Frenchman) resided, so we set off to waolk in & blazing hot sun. The prince happened to be one of the few remaining faithful to the British, and the planter seeing the whole country up around him agreed to start, with his wife and family, along witli us the following morning. We got the first meal there thot we had had for three days, and from that place our diet was spare And bad, and the water extremnely dirty. We had a guard of 30 Sepoys fromn the Rajah to take us to Dinapore, for we had to pass a very strong fort ab'out 10 roiles below GolA, and it was on Account of this -plae, no doubot, that our boatmen. deserted us on the previous day, However, we jot on all right Ofter this, and arrived here on the morning of the 17th, when we heArd that many officers who left Fyzabad on the morning of the 9th had been murdered and drowned. 'Upon our arrival here we were received most heartily by the officers of the 8th Native Inantry, who do their utmost to make us comfortable. All the ladies were left atFyzabad under the charge of Rajah Nann Singh, who promAsed to protect them, but, as he was our pTisoner within two days of the mutiny, I doubted his fidelity. I was to have re. mained with the ladies at Fyzabad, but as iny regiment pro. mised to fight I was kept with it, ancd then sent off with the other officers. Almost all the ladies Arrived here laa night from Fyzabad in a pitiful condition. They had been robbed of every thing at Gorriekpore, and only escaped with. their lives. They were kept prisoners in a fort on the river for a week, and were almost starved to death. I cannot describe half the miseries they have endured. "1 have lost nearly everything I have, but Adjutant Grant, of the 8th Native Infantry, with whom Captain. Gordon and myself are staying, has given us abundance of shirts, flatnels, &e., and he is a noble specimen of alicotchman. We seem to have escaped by Providence, as almost every man who started with us from Fyzsbad has beent either murdered or drowned. To give you an account of men coming up the country and the way in 'which Euro. peans are murdered and natives hung in return wouln occupy too much time, but. every d7y brings us some freh account of bloodshed."
SEETAPORE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIUE.& ; Sir,-I have as yet seen no accovut in the papers of the mutiny of the 41st Reginent at this station, excepting tbe report that the major and several officers had fallen; and the following particulars, which I 'will condense from two letters received from an officer of that regiment and his wife, may be interesting to those who may have hd filends or relatives at that station. The mutiny broke out on the 3d of June. A Sepoy came in the rnorning of that day to acquaint my friend of the determination at the soldiersto mutiny, but stted that they would not harm their officers if they would leave the plac The regiment was divided, a part being stationed about a mile and a h3lf from the others, and as more plunder was to he had in the town itself the mutineers first attacked It. The Colonel, although warned by a friendly Sepoy, would not believe that the regiment intendea to mutiny, and conductea twro of the disappointed companies to the treasury, and there be and another officer were shot. The sergeant-major was alo killed, and one other offaoer wounded. The officers had reoeived orders, of course, to remain with their men, but on hearing the Bring in the town the mnerL at once disbanded themselves, rushing there to joirt in 'be plunder. A fe* faithful Sepoys now implored the officers to escape, and, seeing the bungalows and lines in & blaze, they left about roontin their buggies. The party consisted of 12 officers, six l1dies, and as mazry children,' with a number of the wives and children of civilians Labout 50 in All. During their jourmey they hed. to avoid the high zod, and were obliged to go °over xavines ploughediflelds, and places where no wheeled catriage could ever befope.havo passd. The part halted for an hour only and weretporsued by the mutineers, after they had satiated themselvs by mnurdering about 50 people in the town, men, women,and children; butforunatelytheyzreachedTuncnow, a distancJ of 50 miles, in safety, esorted by 2 Sepoys who Lemainedafaithfnl to them. The party were two daysand a night on the road, and the beat was intense. They lost all they posa4ssed, and escaped with only the things they had on. Tbe Uttiou was burt to the ground.

THE KTNGDOM OF TRETIW ,NI'I ,i,S. (rRow OUR OWN . NAPLES. Auc. 20. The Piedmontese Government still coitizlues its remonstrances with the Neapolitau Government for the detention of the cargo of the Cagliari and the clothes of the crew, though such remonAtrances are for ever met with the same pusitive refusaL Every effort bas been made to show hiow f -olish aild unreasonable is such conduct, but in vain ; the Neapolitan Governmnent will listen to no reinoustrance -hear no reason. When did it ever do so ? There can be no doubt that it is puttitng itself into a very false and odious position with Piedmiont by this irritating conduct. I have already informe.( you that allthe refusals t) accede to the wishes of the Sardinian Charg6 d'Affaires and the British Acting-Consul have been accoinpanied by as6urances that the prisoners shall be treated with ogui riquardo compatible with their position as ':suspects." What is meant by oyip¢ rigiardo in Neapolitaix official language appears to be the denial of their clothes during the intense heat of the summer, and keeping the prisoners on the allowance of beans aud bread, so as to render it necessary f,r the Sardinian Steam Compalny to advance them 42 carlini a-day. There is so tuuch consistency in this proceding that I cannot help calling your attention to it. Crrelty and cajolery ever characterize it ; it martyrizesvwith a smile and exposes you to torture with the moss refihued courtesy. Your subjects, poor fellows, must eat beans and wear the same shirt for three months, as far as depends on us; but they shall be treated with every possible considerationstate senra pensiere. It is in such a. manner that the Neapolitan Government is now laughing at the British and Sardinian Governtnents. I now hear that the trial at Salerno is not likely to come on until the end of September. The istuziwoe of the cause is conducted almost under the eye of Hlis Majesty. Tbe Intendente of Salerno iscontinually at Castellamare, and a story circulates that the King has dictated most particular inbtructions to the Procureur-General of Salerno, Signor Pacifico, as to the mnanner in wbich the cause is to be treated. Of course, this is nothing more than might have been anticipated, as, perhaps, in no part of Europe is the tbeory of an absolute monarchy so completely carried out as in Naples, where directors and Ministers are set up for ahowaud knocked down like ninepins when so it pleaseth him. Some little excitement has been created here by the diamissal of the captains of three of the steamers plying between Naples and Marseilles. They require in this country the patent of Government before they can serve, and this it is which has been withdrawn from them. Captains Ferrara and Minutoli have been deprived of it for having " lost the confidence of the Government." It is probable that they are suspected of having introduced political papers and pamphlets. Petitions have been presented in their favour, but they have not been even received. In the case of the third there is every probability of his being restored, for it is only a case of smuggling, and who does not smuggle in Naples? Rather, I shonld ask, who observes the Custom-house regulations? Though we have now two crops of grain on hand, no decree permitting its exportation makes its appearance, though that it must do so is evident to all. It is simply a question of time. Those who are likely to be best informed are of opinion that it will not be out till the end of the next month, and this for two reasons-1st, because the official returns have not been all received by the Govermment; and, secondly, because Government will be likely to wait until the price of grain falls to a much lower price, so as to bear the imposition of a smaaU duty. The delay, therefore, is probably a question of revenue. As the season advances the King continues to take his evening drives, protracting them till a late hour and returning surrounded by a host of lazzaroni bearing torches. &c. The quiet village of Sorrento was lately stirred up "'ab imis" by a visit from His Majesty. In an ordinary hack, accompanied by two mounted Gendarmes, the King of the Two Sicilies made his entry. The great man of the place sent round the head of the Urban Guard to " recommend" an illumination. Whc could resist it? Candles anrd lamps were in immediate requisition, and by the time His Majesty returned the whole place was in a blaze. The authorities supplied the facchini of the place with torches, and amid the shouts of " Viva o Re," uttered by these half-clothed lazzaroni and mariners, the 1ing returned to Castellamare. His Majesty, which was the most interesting point, left a sum of money to be divided among his torch-bearers, and so ended this " voluntary illuminatiov and fervid and enthusiastic demonstration of affection for the adored Sovereign." One hears so much of these voluntary deroonstrations that I am glad to have the opportunity of giving you the details of one.

TIB DANUBIAN PRINCIPAL I 7'JI5. . .......... V--X (FRno oUn OWN CORI'ESrONDNT. , BUCHEAREST, AUG. 19. It is More than a week since the news arrived here that the English and French Governrnents l ad come to an understanding about the ditticaltiet which have been so imprudently raised in the Principalities, and the telegraph from Constantinople says still that things remain there is statu quothat is, that the Ambassadors are qi1arrelling and doing their best again to disturb the nnder6taisding between their Governments. This is very uusatisfactory, but will not come unexpectedly to any one 'who knovws the circumstances there. The British and Austrian Ambassadors, who have put themselves so prominently forward in maintaining the legality of the elections in Moldavia whenthe Turkish Government was already inclined to yield, cannot but consider as a defeat the arrangement which has been concluded between the British and French Governments, and according to which the elections are to be annulled. Their opponents, on the other hand, encouraged by this triumph, endeavour to make the moat of their advantageous position. The ill-fated Turkish Government finds itzelf, as usual, " between the bamnmer and the anvil." It is the parapet behind which the two parties fight, and it receives the blows and missiles which they aim at each other. As the Turkish Gxovernment was no party to the arrangement which has been co"ncluded between France and England, its consent was necessary to carry this arrangement into effect; beBides this, it was scarctly possible to regnilate all the detail questions in England. Thus, although the matter was settled in principle, virtually the whole question remained in the hands of those who bad been the cause of the complication. Of course, such a precious opportunity to renew the battle was not lost, and it is raging more violently than ever, animated as it is Iby wounded vanity on the one side and by the con- fidence of a late triumph on the other It seems inconceivable that the two Governments did not foresee this, and that they did not take measures to stop it. I said only a few days ago, when the telegraphic news of a settlement of this question in Englancd arrived, that before long we should bave another difficulty, unless those whose vanity provokes them are removed, and in less than a week my prediction has been verified. If the two Governments are sincere in their wishes to maintain their good understanding, and if they bave, as they I pretend, the welfare of Turkey at heart, they must endwith that. It is not alone a question of the present, but of the future. During the whole of the Eastern war France and England, going hand in hand at Constantinople, acquired an infuence there which was only justified by exceptional circumstances. These have ceased for everybody, except the two Ambassadors. They seem still to chink that nothing has changed, and never was the pressure of foreign representatives at Constantinople greater than it is at present. Encou-raged by the conduct of the two heads of Pern diplomacy, the dii minorum gentium have likewise ass,umed a tone 'which has never been heard before. It is useless to guarantee the independence of Turkey on paper so long as this state of things lasts. We intend to raise the moral power of Turkey, and what can be more pernicious to authority than this constant direct interference, this game at shuttle.. cock, which is allowed to go on? Is it not possible for the Powers to come to an understanding by which, for at least a year, no higher diplomatic agent should he accredited at Con- stantinople ? This interregnum of Chargts I d Affaires would do more to set,tle Turkcey than any orders and advices from the Governments to their Ambawsadors, which are not observed. The pretext which has beenr seized upon to bring about a new complication is the inquiry into the conduct of Vogorides, the Kaimakan of Moldavia, for exerting unlawful influence in the late elections. You will remember that in May, long before the elections took place, the four Commissioners of France, Russia, Prussia, and Sardinia reported the grievances which the IJnionists in Moldavia had Laid before them against the Xaimakas to the agents of their respective Governments at Constantinople, and these latter dematnded his dismissal The Conference which took place did not adopt this viewv. Since then the dismissal of this functionary became a standing feud between the two parties. No means were left untried to obtain this point. As It was from want of proofs that the Turitish Government [refused to accede to this dewand, it was necessary to find thema. Ior this purpose recourse was had to an eypedient which would scarcely be adolitted by the rost barefaced court of law, but which, it seemo, is perfectly admissilile in diplomacy. Several pri.- vate letters written by different persons to Prince Vogerides vrere subtracted And sent to the Commnssioners. The four on which the greatest stres 'was laid were one from Baron Prokescb, the Austrian Minister at Constantinople; one from the father of Vogorides at Constantinople; another frota his brother-in-law, wbo is at the same time RapuEiaya, or Charge d'.ffaires, of Moldavia at Con- otntinople; and one from 6is brother, who is Con- . seiller d' Ambassade in London. These four letters are similar in their spirit; all assure Vogorides of the satisfaction which his conduct has given hitherto to the Turkiah Governmenit, and encourage him to continue in the way he has begun; they advise hima, above all, not to be afraid of responsibility, as the letter of Baron Prokesch says there may be circumstances in which the Porte cannot act according to its desire, and where the activity of thel Porte must cease his ought to begin. I must confess I never could see the importance which has been attributed to these letters. They are far too vague to be called proofs. General phrases, however Machiavellic, show little mote than the intention, and it is only after the equally important point has been proved that those intentions have been acted upon that a condemnation ought to follow ; however, they may be deemed sufficient to satisfy an inquiry. When these letters were brought forward they were takenl by the adverse pa:'ty in this sense, and, instead of trying to exculpate the Kaimakan of Moldavia, the Turkish Government proposed as a compromise that both the Raimakans, of Wallachsia as well as Moldavia, should be called to Constantinople to stand their trial, as, according, to the Turkish Government, if the EaimakanL of Moldaviawas blameable for using his influence against the Union, that of Wallachia was equally guilty for doing the same in favour of the Union. This proposition waa not aecepted, and the relations between Turkey and the Four Powers were broken off. Nowr that the other points have been more or less settled in England, this has been again revived. As the case stoed until a few days ago nothing could be more unfair and, at thesame time, more impolitic. Unless it was wanted to condemn him because he could not do an imposibility, there was no serious ground of complaint against the Kiaimak;an. The ide3 of union is an essentially Wallachian idea, and, as I told you in one of my last letters, it is so strongly rooted that even those who are unfavourable to it do not dare to express their opinions on the subject. But nothing would be more unjust than to charge the Kaimakan, Alexander Ghika, with this unaninaty of feeling. HIe found the stream so strong that it was impossible to stein it. Was it not wiser to acknowiedge this impossibility, and to try to guide and regulate the stream w hich could"not be stopped ? A foolish opposition would have only strengthened the force and violence of the current. Hi oliev bitherto was to keep a strict neutrality, and to repress, by the strength which this irmpartiality gave him, the violence of the extreme party. When the difficulties arose about the interpretation of the firman, and a violent struggle about it was preparing, he stopped it by referrng the explanations to those who made the firman. When the explanations were given he had the 2lectoral lists prepared accordingly, and I have not heard of a single complaint against them. In spite of the excitement, which is a natural consequence under the circumstances, and in spite of the agitation which the advanced party tries to create, the moderate party are likely to get the upper hand everywhere. Indeed, the hatred which the Kaimakan inspires in the extreme party ought to have been the best reason for supporting him. Since the beginning of his government he has been battling agai}nit them. When he was named they expected to get the whole direction of affairs into their own hands, and when they sawr that he was determined to follow a mode. rate and impartial policy they became his enemies, and the not uncommon sighM presented itself of the two extremie parties working,each in its own wayfor the same end. Hitherto, therefore, there was not only no reasonable ground of complaint against him, but, on the ocovary, every Governmeut whi&hwas z"llym4u for a quiet settlement of thif question ought to have supported a man who, by his moderatiou un the oLe han. andI bY bis great popularity with the lower classes on the other, would be so useful to keep things from running to extremes. UJnfortunately, a few days ago a circumstance occurred which may be interpreted as a partiality for the Unionists against the Porte. I told you that the UJnionist Club serenaded the French Coxnminizioner on the Pvening of the Eminperor's fete-day. The thingin itself would have been innocent enough, and even the hurrabs for the union could scarcely be construed into high treason, but it was exceed. ingly unwise of the Kaimakan at the present mo. ment, especially when the relations between the Porte sad France are stil interrupted, to allow his military band to figure at the serenade, and his functionaries to take part in the demonstration, for it asaumed thus San ofileial character. I am inclined to attribute this mistake to a momentary weakness and yielding to the extreme party, although it is a pity be did not perceive that their main object was only to compromise him. He has thuis himself given arms into the hands of his adversaries, who are anxiouis to upset him. The effecte of this momentary mistake begin already to be felt. The Turkish Commimsioner has received very strong instruetions from bis Government, and asks for explanations; the French Commisioner, on the contrary, has declared that he would consider as an insult to his Emperor any steps which might be taken in this respect. Here is a new pretext for complications, quite sufficient to answer the purpose. You will see it will be seized told of- at Constantinople to make out a case against the Kaimakan, and thus to carry the point of exculpating Vogorides by accusing Ghika. This exculpating one's otwn faults by accusing others has been the policy all along on both sides, the Austrians extcsing their violence by the violence of the French, and vice versd. In. the meantiine Eussia mzay laugh in her sleeve at the policy of Europe, which Is help. ing her interests so well; and history's verdict one day will be, " Tu l'as voulu, George Danvln."
THE GERMAN LEGION AND THE ZVOLISH MILITIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMEs. Sir,-In. common with Mr. Adderley, the House of Com. mons, and I trust I may say every EngliEhman, (excepting, of course, Cabinet Ministers), I was much astonished to fnd that the German Leginn at the Cape had from the date of its arival in that colony up to the present time been fn the receipt of fnll pay. Mr. Labouchere said " that the Governor of the Cape counsdered it desirable that they should be embodied, so that they might become useful as soldiers in case theyv 3re required," and seemed to think great credit was due to him for having so embodied them, as it would allow more regiments from the Cape to be sent to India. Does Mr. Labouchere mean to say that when these Germans arrived the Governor of the Cape foresaw the eventa that have so recently taken place in India ? If so, he was certainly the only Government official at home or abroad who did; if not, wi!l the War Department eon. descend to explain why-s Sir De Lacy Evans very pro. perly asks-were 2,300 men added to the strength of the amy without the country knowing anything about it ? I have the honour to belong to a regiment of Miilita which dariung the late war served Her Majesty by doing duty at one of her principal garrison towns, and alsO by service in the Mediterranean; and in every case, it the opinion of those placed in authority to judge in such cases is to be relled on, we did our duty well. At all events, during oar stay abroad, which extended over a year, not a cnime occuma in the regiment of suffieient magnitude to cause us once to make use of the military prison, and on our being disembodied, out of 850 men, to all ef whom. the colonel gave a written charater, there were not found 10 men whose coaduct did not entitle them to receive a recommendation to the farmers of the parishes from which they had been taken, appising them that during their absence from horne their conduct had been "good," "very good," or "excellent," as the ease might be. But, Sir, how were these men disnissed to their homes by tho Waofice ? It is trae a bounty of 10s. was to be given to each man, but another ciroular also stated it was to be retained in order to supply them with neoesaries wh$en agan caled out; so that if the county had not como nobly forward with private subecriptions many of these poor fellows, vio for two years had willingly served fer Majesty for the magnicfeut sm of Is. Id. a.doy, would have been turned adrift withoot a shiling in their pockets. Con. trst this with the treatment of the Germans, Each wan was given a large sum to emigrote to one of our finesiaolonles, and from that time, although we have been at peace nd have had 11 British regiments stationed at the Cape, theso foreign favouritcs have been kept on full pay. M3y I ask you It this is even commoAs justioe, much ISS a course likely to produce enthusisam asnng Englishmen ? Without the inducement of the full pay I, aBritish officer, who h*ve served in the Militia ever since it was first embodied In 1852, and have since then filled nearly every staff appointment in it, would gladly have taken advantage of the beneite held ouLt to the officers od the Foreign legion and taken out with me 200 or 300 true.hearted countrymus; and go doubt there ae plenty of other Mfilitia officers who would have done so likewise; but no, the advantages thus held out were not to be given to our own people, who had in all cases gainedf the esteem and confidence of the public, but to a set of foreign desparadoes, wbo in too many caw, s had been the curse and terror of the neighbourhood in which they had been quartered, and -vith whom Englishmen have no smpathy. I conclude that a portion of tho ilitia *wll almost immediately be embodied; if so, I trust the Government will hold out some stronger inducement to both men and officers to join its ranks than they did duing the late war. I have the honour to be a captain, not by reason of my wealth, but by service, and can bring with me testimonials of my fitness for active military employment, and if allowed to enter one of the ner- battalions with my present rank would take into it 100, or, if requIred, 200 fine youg fellows, wiling ad able to fight for their Queen anywhere. Then, why, Sir, I ask yon, am I not allowed to take my position in the army openly and fairly, in preference to introducing in an un English and underhand manner 2,300 foreign mercenaries ? I have the honour to be your obedient servant, A MILITIA CAPTAfL,

IRELAND. (nIoM OQUi owW COaRESPONDRX. I) UML,1i., MrDAY MORWG. TEr BBlT18H ASSOCTITIoX. ne morning papers groan under the weight of the rhported proceedings of the British Association yesterday. The Ysaings and doings of the Seven sections are given with a fidelity that would not discredit the professional skill usually displayed in the production of a Parliamentary debate of the first importanoe. Twelve or thirteen columns of the minutest type are devoted to the readings of tbe papers, to the exclusion of almost every other topic of public interest. A con vrsc azos in the evening at the Royal Dublin Society's house in Kildsrstreet wound up the second day's feast of reason. AD.IISTmATION OF JUSTICE. The re-arrest of Spoilen, with a view of putting him upon his trial on the minor charge of robbery, is regarded by mnore than one Irish journal as a 'we effort to appease the public mind, roused nd dissatisfied as it is at all the fruitlees proceedings of the officials who had the conduct of the Broadstone prosecution. Adverting to the lamentable failuro of justice in this instance, a King's County paper (the Cshronicle) enumerates a dismal catalogue of mlrders perpetrated in that quarter which up to the present have defied all attempts at detection, and which, as in the case of the ill-fated Mr. Little, will probably never comae under the cognizance of a hurman tribunal _ " In this county the escape of * murderer is the rule, with scaroely a single excepion. Mr. Pike *was shot on the high road in the da5light, almost within view of the polio., yet his maurderers are undetected. Mr. Lloyd's murder, perpetrated in the gtreet of this town, is still unmevenged; so is that of Sir. Cage and others; and, la-tly, the assassins of the lamented Mr. William Manifold are at large. The Government on each occasion offered a reward, bat no one came forward to earn it, and then they satisfied theamselves with sending down some detectives utterly ignorant of the county and its people. We had. in this county a detective at considerable expense who did not make a single detection, and who at a court of inquiry was proved to have ccnpied himself in the more congenial parsait of cultivating a farm and heding pigs. The entire system for the discovery sad repression of crime requires to be remodelled and altered, sinoe the present is, andoubtedly, de- fective. The constabul4ry is more military than civil in its. constitution, regulations, and organ!7Ation. Its members are fettered and restrained by the strictness of military rule ard of formal duties, and they ar not permitted that freedom foy exertion in their vocation which would best instre tbe successful and cetain detection of criminals, and which, with the repression of crime, is the object for which that fozce was constituted." To this list of undiscovered assassins may be added the murderers of Mrs. Sarah Kelly, Mr. Callaghan, and others of recent date. No doubt, a conviction was had in one of the most mysterious and fearful, murders ever perpetrated in any country; but in that case, too, justice was eventually foiled, and for reasons which up to this hour are wholly inexplicable. Mr. Wiliam Burke Kirwan, the hero of the Ireland's Eye tragedy, is still a living man, and for anything that is known to the contrary in the enjoyment of good health and spirits in the salubrious cimrate of Swan ECiver. Tun CATTLE 3IURRAIN. Information has come from so many quarters that it is quite impossible to entertain serious doubts of ifs general correctness, although it may be hoped that the extent of the calamity is somewhat exaggerated. According to private letters the longdreaded cattle murrain has broken out in a virulent form in parts of the counties of Louth and Meath, and in a district about 15 or 16 miUes fronn Dublin on the north-east side. One party is said to have lost in an incredibly short time 40 out of 106 head of black cattle, while a strugglng farmer, the owner of 10 cows, has had nearly his whole stock swept off by the disorder. A gentleman just returned from the King's County states that the distemper was raging in that quarter, and that in every instance which had come under his obaservation te attach had ended fatally. 13xcept I the places specified there are no accounts of any appearance of the disease, and there is nothing to lead to the belief that it haa become an epidemic.

WOWBA&PjR ArUSICXL FESTI PAL. IYROt OUf OWYN RVORTR) WORCESTBII, AuG. 2& The 134th meetifn of the choirs i; virtually concadaed. Nothing using except ihe dress ball, which usully winds up tho festival in tlle new GunldhalL A dreom had been entertained by some of the fairest of the citizen, and of those from the country around who came to WoDrcestar to attend the performances at the Cathedral and CoUege-hill, that a personage of the highest distinction would perhaps assit at this ceremony, but the flattering vision was dispelled early in the afternoon of yesterday. The ball takes place to. nigh, ancd is expected to be well attended. The splendid weather is in its farour. The sit has not hid himself once during the week, and the wonder is that such an unprecedented continuance of blue sky should have exercised so little direct influeneo on the success of the meeting. The sdden appearance, and as sudde. di&appearance, of a comet In the form and likeness of a Royal scion haa had a great deal more. The last evening concert was the best attended of the three (about 730 besng presnt), and the programme was the longest. The first part was devoted to an admirablea election from the works of Mozart-& selection adapted to exhibit not only the greatness bat the prodigious variety of his geniu. The symphony in Eflat-the most graceful an d lovely of the seven grand compositions upon which the reputxation of Uozml as a composer of orchestral symphonies is based written in the same month as the G minor and the sodenomninated .Tupiuer, of which wonderful inspirations it is in every way a fit aSSociate-lnaugumted the selection, and was for the rmost part played with greater care, and I therefore with greater effect, than fell to the lot of Men.. delssohn on Tuesday or Beethoven on Wednesday. It was listened to with attention, and further strengthened our opinion that the policy of introducing one such continuous instrumental work at every concert is a wise one. The vocal features in the Mozart selection were the quartet I "Flacido e il mar," from Idomenw-the operA that, for particular reasons (psychological) its gifted author loved the best -which dowing and tranquil piece was scarcely given with the necessary smoothness; " Madamina," by Herr Formes, whose singing was as usual accompanied by a certain dramatic significance not by any meaun ont of plaee in a concert-room; the air, "Zefliretti lusinghieri," another fine specimen of the beauties of Idomeneo, in which Madame Novello displayed her accustomed vocal excellence; the familiar " Crudel perchbe" extremely woll sung by Madame and M. Weiss; the graceful air, "Quando il piasto" (fSciraglio), in which Signor Gardoni showed both a. tre appreciation of the music and a power of making its beauty felt by others; the air, " Quando miro," which the recitative excepted, where the orchcstra was nearly coming to a standuill) w finishad a performanca at to elicit an encore for Miss Dolby, who repeated the last movement with her usual urbanity; and the famous sestet, " Sola sola," in which, although the principal singers already named took part and were further aided by Miss L. Vinning and Mr. Thoma., there wa not much to call for unmeasured eulogium. Altogether thi selection was quite refreshing, and made an imprteon so vivid that for a time " Travatores" aind " Traviata 1were forgotten. Mozats music unaided afforded intense gratification forupwards of an hour and a-half, and that to a provincial andience of mixed oharacter. Itwas th raomen. tary triumph of genuine beauty, beauty unadoned, over its painted and powdered eembLce-, triumph, in ahort, of melody and aense over " roulades" and rhodomon4ade. The second part of the conoert was s follows-- Overture-" La este di Nirenze . Frank McI. Vauiata-" May Dsj I. acf-rsen. Duelto-"Mlmererew . . .. ..

The frankly rustic character of the opening chorus, "Who shall be Queen of tho MAy 1" the vigorous and marked expresdon of the pat-9SOg (" The hunt's up"), and the manterly conduct of the final chorus, wbere the " revels" are illustrated, and one of the oldest and quainteat of Bong lish tunes, for fife and drum, is introduced and elaborated with Admirable effect, were immediately felt by the audience and acknowledged Accordingly, The loudest applause followed the termination of theperformance. Mr. acfiarren should turn his attention to other works of the 3ame form and character. Oar modern English musicians have for the most part been wanting in English character ald English sentiment; bat that these may be used as elements in a composition of high musical pretenbions is encifently demonstrated by the Author of Mfay Day. The " Miserere" from 11 Trovore had ample justice done to it by Madame Novello and Mr. Sims Reeves, who s-ug their very best; It is, however, rather a lugubrioas feature in a concert programme. " The reaper and the flowers," one of Mr. Balfe's most genial settings of Long. fellow's poetry, ig iust suited to Mr. Weiss, nor could Mrs. Veiss have selected a fairer exaomple of the musical genius of Bishop, or better fitted to her own peculiarities, than the adr from Zumar; both pieces were unbackneyed, and both were heard with satisfaction. Mr. R. Blagrove displayed the sdll and faiiity for which he Is noted in his concertina solo; and the Irish ballds of Miss Dolby ("Oh bay of Dublin," and "K atie's letter"), acompanied by her self on the pianoforte, aud delivered with peculiar point ind Archness, enchanted everybody as of old. The dutt tror. La Traviat (the everlasting " Parigi O care") could scarcely have been sung better thin by Mfadame NTovello and Signor Gardoni; but either the passionate aspirations of the phthysical Violetta 'were not mado sufficiently evident by the lady, or the audience was impenetra ble to their appeal; at any rate, the duet fell flat, as it invariably does, away from the footlamps. M[r. Sims Reeves sng " Come into the garden, Maud" (in which Mr. Belfe, having exhausted Longfellow, lays Tennyson under contribution) with touching and fervid expression, and quite enraptred his hearers, who encored him with unaninimity; but the popnl,r English tenor was obstinate ths time, and, adhering to the prudent rule he has recently lid down for himself, could not be persuaded. Some "w wit" from the gallery called out, " Come on to the platform, Sims ;" but the summons was in vain, and Mr. " Sims' only reappeared to sing one of the verses of the nxtional anthem in association with Miss Louisa Vinning aud Miss Dolby, at the termination of the concert. Earlr service in the cathedral this morning was Again numerously attended. The musical selections comprised-" venite"-Grand Chb t, Humphrey; Psalams -Double Chant, 2o,. 49, Dr, Boyce; Service-Travers in F.; and Anthem- " Hear my crying," No. 77, Weldon. On the whole, the members of the three choirs and Mr. TownBhend Smith, oi Hereford Cathedral, who presided at the organ each day, may be fairly complimented on the zeal and eficerncy with which they have performed their duties on these oceaions-datles not less honourable, since they were for the benefit of those whose circumstances did not permit of their attending the performances of oratorios, *ud who vrere thus in a manner permitted to enjoy their share of the abundanoe of sacred mausic engendered by the festival. The collection at the last morning service was 4. 8s. 4d, so that, after All, the hu-mbler classes may be said to have Added their mite to the fund for the widows and orphans. The Messia to-day brought the largest attendance to the cathedral. The Jessiah is an unfailing source of profit to these sud all other music meetings; it ha been so for a century and more. When Handel wrote the Ace&iah be may be sid to have foumded a perpetual charity. The performance of this immortal piece was-what it Wsldom feils to be, since every singer and every player is as familiar with it as with tlhe Lord's Praver-admirable in rearly all respects The singers-Mesdsmnes Novello and Weiss, Misses Dolby andPslmer, Messrs. W.eiss and Tbomas, flerr Forsues and fr. Sims Reeves (who aloile had anundivided duty to perform)-all sang their best, while the cho. rues were imnpressive and grand to a degree. The audience rose and remained standing during "For unto us a thud is born," "Glory to God," "Hollelujab," and " Worthy Is the LambV-s custom the propriety of which however it may be arraigned in a conoert-room, ca scarcely be questioned iu a ckurcl, more ese cially since all these choruwes (aud many others in the Jfessiah) are virtuolly hymns of praise and thanksgiving. Who has got heard the "H afllelujah!' in a cathedral has a new sensation in store. The very first strains excite such an influence that it ix impossible to remain unmoved, aud the act of rising seems to be an irresistible impulse on the part of the congregation wbich foroes them to rise And take pert in the act of worship. The colleo'ion of the charity was 253 123. lUd. This swells the gross amount to upwards of 9704, which additional donations are sure to make 1,0004

When the unhap..y man was informed that al efforts to save his life had failed he became very much depressed, and the full extent of his awful position and the fate which awaited him seemed to come with gt foroe upon him.

OA WAPOR. TO THE EDITOR OF TE1E TIMES. Sir,-The European troops-the loth, 64th, and 84th_ mentioned by the Bombay Times appear never to have reached Cawnpore. On the 27th of May Sir Hugh Wheeler had seven gns, 60 artillerymen, and 60 of the Queen's 32d- i. e., 10 troops; to theae nay be added 15O civiliacs, and tne officers of the Ust, 584, -ad 56th Begirwents of Sative Irsntry, 2d Light Cavalry, and two eoinpaniesof Artilery, wbo were not murdered when the troops first mutinied There were probably about 350 Enropeanx uder Sir XIugh Wheeer, and as mUny ladies, women, and chldrem During the months of Aprl and May tevel balls had been giveis by the different rniments, and there Ws an -unuually largenu. her of ladies at the station. Sir lugh Wheeler threw up oome hsatily.contucited works ar=und two large detched barraccs, having a range of uncompleted barcks to the north-west, which posdbly formed a kind of breastwork; north-east from hig intreneh. mnnt he had connecting lines up to a new church, also surrounded by earthworks, both church and barcasfullof women and hildren, and so pressed for accommodation rere they tha ldies were lying in the balconies under the srnblinds or " jalousise&" The mutiny appears to have followed close upon the lntreneohment; but four nails have now pedc., v period of two months of barrowing guspense to al those iutereated. Wheeler telegraphed daily for reinforcements untilthe communication ws cut oflf and sent offnine letters one of which, of the 24th of June, reahed Sir Henry Law. rence, who was able to communicate with Allaehbad. Imagine the postion of these unhappy men ! The thermo. meter then stood at 100 degrees'in Well regulated buildings, their supplies became rliited to grain and sugar, and the ladies were dying from horrorandprivation. In this vstplain they were surrounded by 4,000 mutinous troops, swelled subsequently by the forces of I-ens Sahib, the Mahratta wretch, and for these six weeks ordnance numrerically superior to their own wereplayingon them. Istterlythere must have been double the number of guns from the quantity apparently taken by Goneral Havelock. With what mockery must such remarks as those eontained in the speech of Mr. Disraelt on the 19th inst., in the Houe of Commons, have met the eyes of those interested In the fate of Cawnpore, which was then well-known to be ae one way or the other. And in high quarters I bave been met with this reply, when expressing anxiety about the fate of Cawnpore.:-" Oh, they are sasf there; there are Enro. pean troops at that station." My poor young brother, who had just obtained his lien. tenancy in the Ist Native Infantry, and who had only been four years In India, was rentioned by General Elavelock in writing to thO Commander-in-Chief at Calcutta on the 1st of July As among the caulties. Mfy brother wrote on the 17th of May, speaking of the mutiny at Mteerut, " if this spreads Very few Of us will escape to tell the tale. We belove our men to be true to us, hut One alone can tell, in whom we must all put our trust" Tis prediction, poor fellow, was only too truy vrise. On the l9th of May, the lst time he wrote (at leut it ig the lat letter received), he sys, "4We are under a right good General here (Wheeler), one who bas always been & friend to the Sepoy, but one who will put down withL a strong band the first zigns of rebellion." Yet see the result; the Asitic charctr is as dark a deceitful s ever, and the atrocities recently perpetrated, of which we bave no parllel even in Holy Writ, show, that it Is a untameable as in the days of Clearchus.

'VHB COURImMARITIAL O0X COLONBL J. CLARUBE CUANTHAd, FRIDAY. The general court-martial which has been sitting for the Lsst 10 dacys at Chatham Garrison for the trial of LieutenantColonel J. Clarke again assembled at Chatham Barracks 1A 12 o'clock this day, wnder the presidency of Colonel El Jervis, Commandant of the Provisional Battalion, for the I purpose of hearing an aiidress from the prisoner on the evidence given for the defence. The >REsTghXT (to the prlsoner).-Colonel Clarke, have you aDy further witnesses to be er.amined ? Colonel Clarke raid he had not, and then proceeded to Address the Court as follows:- mr.PresidentandGentlemen,-Although feeling that I am ltogether guliltless of the heavy charges brought againt zne l am at a loss how to address myself to the task of repeing them, I oan only repent mny distinct denial of hav1ng been guilty of insubordination in thought or expression, nseither does Colonel Hill in his charges accuse me of insubordination. After a lapse of five months, during which I wma in asrret upon one set of charges, I find myself at the lst moment arraigned upon three aggravated accusations. 'Why is not Colonel Hill present to support these charges? In the original copy of the charges furnished to me he is the princpal witness. Does he fear the testof cross-examination or shrink from supporting on oath the allegations which he has aoscruple to permithis friend andadviser,Captain AMends, to swear to? Mrs. EilU arrived by the July steamer, bat has absented herself from the court on a certificated plea of ill. health. Captain Hill, 2d West India Regiment, who returned in August, has made a solemn declaration to me that he made it a point not to listen to the conversation with Colonel Hill, and knew nothing whatever about the trans. actions. The Court is called on, upon the unsupported testimony oE one contradictory vitness, to believe a number of irmputations little accordant with probability, or the whole of my military Career. The Court will perceive that there is no proof offered of my being ordered to embark on hoard Her Majsiesty's steamer Perseverance, and proceed with a detaohment of my corps to Batburst, Gambia, ban that I was ordered to to relinquish the command of my men and quit the station, * proceeding which was an excess of authority andan abuse of power, as well as a very gross insult towards an old cfficer w ho had served in higher Rieitary position,s than him- elf for aseries of years. The Court vill remember that they stopped me when I was about to bring nut in evidence the motives which indnuenced Colonel Blill, and, as they then considered this course to be irrelevant, it is nether desirable nor proper that I should at this stage enter upon that discussion. I am in confident expectation that the Court will not consider that I made use of the expressions in the manner or with the culpable constraction that has been given to them, as being opposed to the line of conduct which I pursued throughout, for they have seen that I did not carry out any such opinion. When Colonel Hil's reciment embarked I embXrked with them. I allowed him the supremacy which it is said I would not. I obeyed his orders, submitted to arrest, and a junior officer did assume the command of my men, contrary to my alleged prediction construed into soeusatory matter against me In the fourth charge. The Court may be at a less to conceive a motive for the numerous de. partures from the truth-not bearing upon the chargesinto which the witness for the prosecution (Captain Mends) has been betrayed; but when they recollect he had to seen Colonel Hi from the continued irregularities per. saitted in his favour by that officer the reason becomes appa. rent. When this witness admits, and I hope it has been recorded, that I expressed no doubt of Colonel Hill's authority as long as his regiment remained at Sierra Leone, and his men had not been ordered to embark till the evenlig of the 6th of Miarch, and even at the time of the inter. view, and until the 8th of Marcb, were on shore; and, further, that Colonel Hil told me to assume that they had embarked for the purpose ef friendly argument, he shows -that it was proceeding on hypotheses, and therefore takes aU the insubordination out of the second, third, and fourth charges. If the Court considers the first charge disposed of, they will observe how irreconcileable with truth is Captain Mends's account of the opening of my interview vwith Colonel Hill. Captain Mends states-first, that I was to go to the Gambia because there was no field-officer there, and subsequently admitted that it was because there were disturbances; both these statements being disproved. He sUttes his presumptive confidence that Colonel Hill an-sounoed his arrival at Sierra Leone in orders; it has been proved he did not do so. He states that Colonel Hill gave no reason to Fort Adjutant Watson to be conveyed to me when he ordered me to the Gambia; it has been proved a reason was given me, and that an untrue one. How, indeed, should I bave otherwise known it? On being questioned as to whether he advised Colonel Hill in drawing up the charges, he at first indignantly denied it, on the ground of Colonel Hill being too old an officer to require his advice; but on being checked by the lresident he altered his testimony and acknowledged the very opposite,-namely, that he had b5een consulted, and had given his opinion and thrown out suggestions thereon. F3earful of blatze being attached to Colonel Hill, he swears positively that his company was ith him 12 months at lYaterloo, in Africa, whereas Lieutenant Cody distinctly proves that during those 12 mionths Captain Mends's company was at Towcr-hill Barracks, MSierra Leone, commanded by Lieutenant Davenport and others. Lieutenant Tucker would have corroborated the whole of Lieutenant Cody's evidence, but, conscious that I was wearying the Court, I abstained from caling him and other witnesses to prove that and othor matters which appeared to be abundantly established, CaDtain Mends admits that the late Captain Pearson asked Colonel HliU for the letter of the 8th of November, 18500, on the occasion of its being read on parade on the 7th March, but, immediately forgetting, says that Colonel Hill was not resent; Lieutenant -ody proves the contrary. Captain tends is forced to admit that he assisted in framing these .eharges, and has an interest in substantiating them. In his anxiety to prove that I was cognizant of the Horse Guards' letter of the Sth of November, 15B5, he pretends to believe that I heard it read on parade from my quarters, while Captain M1acauley proves I did not, and Lieutenant Cody showed that I could not. The fact is wVc-th nothing to the prosecution, but shows the animus of the witness. With the same disposition to injure me, he swears the letter to Colonel Hill was taken from a book of circulars in the .brigade-office, but it was wrung from him in cross-examination that the only thing which was remembered of this letter that has been brought against me was, that the coin-nands were separated. He is certain there was an order of Colonel Hill's assumingthe commandon his return to Sierra Leone, but all the evidences swear that there was nothing of the kind. He also swears that he was in orders to command the troops; it is proved that he was not, and that Captain Pearson commanded. He swears that I surrendered myself a prisoner after the reading of the Adjutant-General's letter, after the parade on the 7th of March, forgettixag that I was a prisoner at the time; it has been proved to the Court that I never surrendered myself. Captain Mends also swears -that he remained at Sierra Leone instead of embarking with his regiment, because he was president of an unapproved court-msrtial, Lieutenant Cody shows the untruth of this pretext and assertion. I call upon the Court, in the mater, sts of truth and justice, to reject the entire evidence *of Captain Mends on the second, third, and fourth charges. On the first and fifth charges I shall cffer no remarks. The address of Colonel Clarke was listened to by the Court with marked attention, and at its conclusion the prisoner handed in a number of testimonials as to character, which were read by the Deputy Judge-Advocate. The following officers had forwarded the prisoner testimonials: Lieutenant-General Sir J. Campbell, Lieutenant-General G. Middlemore, Lieutenant-General Sir Lionel Smith, ILord Giesielg, Sir J. Whittingham, and Colonel Doyle. A letter was read from Captain Mends, in which he gave an explanation relative to certain mistakes he had inadvertently made in bis evidence, which he took that op. portunity of acknowledging. The court was then cleared to enable the members to deliberate on their finding previously to the evidence and decision being forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief. The court remained closed about balf-an-bour.
THE MILITIA. TO TEE EDITORI OF THE TIMES. Sir,-With the various opinions as to the exact number of men a Militia regiment ought to furnish I have nothing to do, the quarrel I have vith the authorities not being their taking my men, but the mode in which they do so. No one, I imagine, doubts that a most important part of the duties of Militia is from time to time to furnish recruits for the Line ; at all events, I, for one, most certainly con. sider it as the busi ness of myeelf and my officers. But I cannot conceive it to be necessary or desirable that the discipline I and every officer in the regiment have been for months inouleating should be at once dissolved by an inroad of drunken recruiting sergeants sent from various corps and turned loose among my people Mwithout in reality any power of interference on my part. Any officer of Militia will bear me out in calling to mind the scenes when " volunteering orders" were giv en in the last war, and the disgracoful proceedings in consequence. There are many modes in which all this may be avoided, into which I will not now enter further than to protest against a renewal of scenes which for days together made the head-quarters of a Militia rememnt a greater beargaiden and a more disgusting sight than the bar of the loivest Irish pothouse. I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant, A LIEUTENANT-COLONEL-COMMANDANT OF MILITIA. Aug. 28.

RAILWAY INTBLLIGBCNB. EAST KENT. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yester. day at the London Tavern, LDrd Sondes in the chair. Mr. Holroyd, the secretary, read the report, an abstract of which, has appeared in Tlw Times. The CHAntAIMS having moved a formal resolution for the adoption of the report, Mr. LuSELNGTON seconded the motion, and in doing so stated that the directors had done everything in their power to exoedite the contractors, with a view to the opening of the line. They had been impeded in their operations at one or two points, particularly near Rochester and Sittingbourne. Those delays would prevent the posaibility of opening the first section of the line in September, as intended. Notwehstanding those delays the directors would endeavour to open the line as soon as possible. A very full account had been given in the report of their proceedings in Parliament, with a view to obtain an extension of their line from Strood to St. Xary Cray, seoas by means of other lines to have an independent entrance into Lonlon. The report of the committee of the House of Commnons on those Bills was very ambiguous, the chairman of the committee having stated that they had very reluctantly rejected the East Kent Bil, and assented to the South-Eastern Bill for the "relief line" from Lowisham to Dsrtford. BuLt when the latter Bill came before the House of Lords that pert of the Bill was rejected, so that the promoters had merely power to conxstruct a junction line at Tonbridge and to do some other matters; the Lewisham and Dartford line was, in fact, thrown out by the House of Lords. Both pasties were very much in the same position as they were in before the session commenced. There was not much gained by either party. He considered that the East Kent had a right to an independent route from the metronolis to Dover. It was not necessary then to enter into the question. They wished as much as possible to abstain from Parliamentary contests, but they felt that the proposed extension line was not only of importance to the company, but also of great national importance. He trusted they would leave the matter in the hands of the directors, and, although they would abstain as much as they could from Parliamnentary contests, yet they felt bound to go to Parliament again next sesion. He contended that their scheme was not a new one, and that it formed part of the original scheme contemplated by the residents of the county. They merely wished to carry out the original design which the South-Eastern Company had pledged themselves to make, but they had not performed their promise in that respectThey now wanted a direct and independent access to the west end of London. Mr. HAsRTRnDo said that they should confine themselves to making the original East Kent line. He considered the extension from Strood to London a new scheme, and he was therefore opposed to it. He thought they had difficulties enough, without increasing them. He wisbed to know whether they intended to issue a preference stock to raise the requisite money, as he thought it impossible, in the present state of the money-market, to issue the original shares even at a discount, unless in connexion with the houth-Eastern Company. Mr. IOLROYD stated that they had re-issued 6,C00 forfeited shares, and there was no reason why they should not issue more when an opportunity offered. Mr. HARTRIDGE wanted a statement of assets and liabilities, and wished to know whether the directors were satisfied with the progress made by the contractors. Mr. STARLING, So ,ar from considering the proposed extension from Strood to the Crays of no consequence, thought it was of vital importance that they should obtain it. He had become a Shareholder in the undertaking because of that new feature, and he hoped every effort would be made to obtain the sanction of Parliament. By making the 16 miles from Strood to the Crays they would be enabled to avail themselves of the advantage of a West-end terminus. If they could accomplish the undertaking they had in hand, and make that extension, he considered they would hsve a good ten percent. The SECRETARY, in reply to questions, explained the difficulties they had had in consequenos of Chancery proceed. ings, which had delayed the construction ef part of the hcavieet portion of their line. Those obstructions had been removed, and he might state that the arrangements of the directors had been suh that the contractors had never on any occasion to wait for money. ae thought, if Mr. Hartridge would notice that 150,000Z. had been raised throush the exertions of the directors in the last half-year, he woed not look upon their affairs in a desponding manner. They had not failed in anything, and he had no doubt the directors would carry out the undertaking to a successful issue, The report was then unanimously adopted. On the motion of Colonel RI.rs, secended by Mr. Starling, a resolution was passed authorizing the directors to take such steps in the next session of Parliament as they nmight deem requisite for the interests of the company. Sir R. CARDEx, in zeply to some observations by Mr. Hartridge, said if he had not known his old friend he would have thought that he was a wolf in sheep's clothing. There was no doubt they had had their difficulties, but they felt that they had a good line, and if bad lines could get subFcriptions they thought there woald not be munh difficulty in obtaining them for a good line. He had no doubt that all the difficulties would be overcome by the directors. He then proposed a resolation confirming the forfeiture of certain Dover Extension shares, and authorizing the directors to sell or otherwise dispose of the same. Sir J. TYsDEN seconded the motion, and in doing so said they had no wish to be oppoeed to the South-Eastern Company. It had been admitted by them that the North Kent LoW required to be relieved of some of its traffic; what would it be when the East Kent line w7as opened ? Under those circumstances it became of the utmost importance to have the lne frQm Strood to the Crays, and he hoped the proprietors would give the directors power to carry out that extension. The resolution -was then adopted. Mr. DENT asked if Mr. Coles Chald was a shareholder in the East Kent Company, as it was stated at the SouthEBatern meeting, an account of which appeared in The Times of that morning. The SECRETARY said he had never been a shareholder in the East Kent Company. Mr. DENT said he asked the question in justice to Mr. Coles Child, and begged to state that when the Crays line was projected Mr. Coles Child was applied to as landowner at Bromley, and he refused to corme to any terms with them until they had made arrangements with the SouthEastern Company, of which he w,as adirector. Arrangements wlere made, and he sgreed to accept shares for his land, hut he was not a large shareholder, as stated, for he lbsd not yet received axny shares. Sir J. ETYanm^s wished it were true that Mr. Ccles Child was a large shareholder in the East Kent Company. On the motion of Mr. HAsrTHDGE, seconded by Mr. STARLI-NG, the best thanks of the meeting were voted to the cbairman and directors for their exertions in promoting the interests of the company, and the meeting zeparated. WIMBLEDON AND CROYDON. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at the offices in Parliament-street, yesterday, Mr. W. Reed in the chair. The CHAIRMAiN, having expressed his regret at the paucity of the attendance of proprietors, stated that all they had to do was to declare the usual dividend, which he believed would be acceptable to all. The dividend, at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, free of income-tax, was declared; and it appearing that after the contractors were paid there remained a oalance in hand of 1301., it was placed at the disposal of the directors to pay the expenses of the past six months and travelling expenses. The usual vote of thanks closed the proceedings. WHITEHA.VEN JUNCTION. The half-yearly meeting of this coinpany was held at Whitehaven on Thursday, the Earl of Lonmdale in the chair. hr. H. Cook, the secretary, read the report, which stated that the available balance amonnted to 1,7411., out of which the directors proposed a dividend at the rate of 6s. per sbare, leaving 24U. Had it not been for some extraordinary disbursements of a kind generally charged to capital, the revenue would have enabled the proprietors to declare a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. The traffic had more than doubled within the laat five years, and this had necessitated the use of more powerfu?, engines, and in the renewal of the permanent way it had been laid with heavier rails. The capital of the company having been all expended, the directors considered it desirable to apply to Parliament for power to raise additional capital, to provide means for laying the roads with heavier rails, and for additional carrying stock. Various circumstances, such as the erection of new blast furnaces, the opening of new collieries, and the increaee of mineral traffic, rendered it necessary to provide additional means of conveyance. An abstract of the accounts has appeare i in qhne Times. The CMIURMAX hoped the shareholders would coneider the report satisfactory. It was eminently so as compared with the state of their affairs at the same time last year. They now fully understood their position, and instead of being indebted to the hank 3,0001., as they were 12 months ago, they had now that amount standing to their credit. Their line had been in se for 10 or 12 years, and the rails began to show symptoms of wearing out. They would, of course, wear faster in consequence of increased traffic, but thatincrease would enablethem morereadilytorepairorrenew them. Some were of opinion that,with the probability of such a large increase of trade as there had been and was likely to he on the lines in the western division of Cumberland, they should at once doauble their line. Others thought that by increasing the number of sidings the doublung of the line might be postponed for some years. But that was a matter whicb would be for their consideration. at a special meeting. They had had a very encouaraging increase in the traffic, hut having had the good fortane to en gage a personuas mnanger who was exceedingly econ omicall in Ai arrangementsthe espenditure had not increased in a proportionate ratio. He concluded by moving the adoption of the report. blr. MILLER seconded the motion, which was agreed to. Mr. ARMITSTEAD moved that a dividend of 6s. per share be declared, which was seconded by Mr. J. B. Wilson, and carried. The retiring directors, the Earl of Lonsdale, Yr. W. Miller, and the Rev. Henry Lowther, were then re-elected, ard the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the chairman. WELLS AND FAKENHA&L The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Thursday at Fakenham, Mr. H. W. Keary in the ohair. The Secretary (Mr. lutt) read the report of the directors, which stated that the lino, stations, and works were completed, with the exception of tho Wells Harbour branch, now in progress, and a tramway proposed to he constructed along the quay. The opening of the maian lne was now only delayed for the completion of a junction with the Eastern Counties aad Norfolk rilvva) s at Fakenham, and the necessary arrangements for station acowmmodation there and for working the line. Negotiations were being actively carried on to effect these objeces. The acoonots showed that 73809l. bad been received, and 71,5971. expended, leavingabalauceof 2,2111. - The CHAIRMAN, in moving the adoiption ef the report eaid, contracts were signed on the 2Ket of September, 1855, and the wotks were comnpleted witbin a week of the time specified (June 1, l857); but difficulties over which the *- l- ^ . . ^ ^ c,e,s h'' t-A ,ted the onening of tho line. T.hoso diffionlties, which had arisen between the compauy and the Bastern Counties board, were now drawing to a conclusion. Mr. TILL having referred to the present satisfactory position of the negotiations with the E;stern Countiee Company 'with regard to the jundion and other matters, the report was unanimously adopted. In reply to a question, Mr. TILL stated that he thought the best coursa they eould pursue would be to work the ine under an arrangemont with the Eastern Counties Company at the lowest3 possible rate. If the agreenenS acted oppresaively, a meeting of the shareholders could then be called to determine on the course to be pursued. tThe proceedings closed with the usa1 compliment to the chairman. WARRINGTON AND STOCPORT. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Thursday, at Waxrington, Mr. W. C. Fosbery in the chair. The report stated that the totalexpendituze was 285,9861., In which was included 8,2501. forleited to the Board of Trade, through the non-completlon of the extension to Stockport, and 3,5001. of accounts due. To meet tho outlay the paid up capital amounted to 169,5101.; the loans on mortgage to 6E,70vl.* loans by the directors, 15,000l.; other loans, 23,969?.; leaving a balance of 14,8061. to be provided for by new loans. The directors intended to apply to Par. liment for powers to raise 3-3,786., which, with unismued stock amounting to 20,4901.,vwould legaUlyprovide for all unsecured loans and liabilities at present existing. Tbh. revenue account showed an income of 6,224t. for the half-year against 3,8411. for the previous half.year, leaving a profit of 5251., after paying all interest upon loans, mortgages, &o., and various arrears of ground rent. Tbo 5251. had been used in reduction of a defiit of 8501. on the previous half-year. The CAiRmA-4N, in moving the adoption of the repork, referred to the original capital and mortgage account of 253,0W01. Ln 1853, the extension of the line to Stookport was sanctioned by the shareholders, an act of Par- utao otained, and every effort made by the directors to raise the necessary capital, but unfortunately the calls made to the shareholders were not responded to. ln cons6quence, iu addition to 253,0001. of original capital, they hadto pay 11,7911. on the account, and a sum on a- count of the Manchester Extension. They tried in 1853 for runng power over the South Junction line, but failed, so that the snm lost in the attempt, ano those before named, fell upon the Warrington andtStockport line, and brought up the expenditure from 253,0001. to 274,0001. In addition to that they had the loks of the deposit on the extension to Stockport scheme, amqunting to 8,250., which would fall upon them if the line were stot made within a year. That sum was forfeited to the toard of Trade, owing to a resolution by b1r. Cardwell, when he was president there, to prevent lines being proposed for factious purposes. Si x of the director were bound by bond for the payment of the money, thus 20,04LI. wa 8lost on the Stockport line, which, with the previous named sum, made the total expenditure 285,0001., instead of 253,0001. If the extension had never been attempted, the cost of the origna line would have been within the estimate. Dulring the last six months the revenue was more than doubtfuL. They had charged the last hall-year wich all the liabilities belonging to it, and with 6301. of arrears, which they had no meanus otherwise of paying, and if the directors had not raised 15,0001. last half-year he did not see howr they could have prevented the company from bankruptcy. Now they had paid all, and had a balace of 5251. on the half-year. The grea.t increase had been since the opening of the Eixhibition in Mfay, The increase on the eight weeLs from June showed 1,3001. above the corresponding period. That was very satisfatotry, and he named it to show that the arrangement w7ith the South Junction ComPany had saved them from bankruptcy. He had no fear for the fnture. The traffic development was so great that even if the exhibition were closed he believed they would be able to pay a small dividend next half-year, The accounts were then passed, and after a vote of thanks to the chairman, the meeting separated.- Wc,-sington Chiar. cian. EAST LANCASHIRE. The half-yearly meeting was held yesterday at Bury, Mr. T. Dugdale in the chair. The CHAIRMIAN recapitulated the various topics alluded to in the half-yearly report and statement of account, an abstract of which has appeared in ie Times. A comparison of the working expenses of the last with former half-years showed a reduction from 48&2 per cent. in December, 1855 to rather under 41 per cent. in June, 1857. The road wa; now in better repair, under maintenance by the company. than when under contract. The reduction in loans, re ferred to in the report, was not to be permanent, as the directors intended to re-borrow the money as they deemed i it expedient. The di-ectors considered that the shareholder; I would be fully justified in declaring a dividend of 5 per cent I per annum, becausotheincreasedreceiptsledthem to believe that this rate of dividend would be maintained, and the state of the recerve fund warranted the withdrawal of a small sum in aid. At Christmas, 1855, the reserve fund amounted to 61,3571., and after the proposed withdrawal it would amount to 6l,2111. He moved the adoptien of the rePOrt and accounts. M RIL.R (director) seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously, as was also a resolution declaring the various preference dividends, and a dividend of 5 per cent. annum on the ordinary stock, all payable on the 8th ofI 3etember. c2hairman,eding8 conoluded w, ith a vote of thanks to the EASTERN UNION. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at Ipawich, Sir SamuelBignold presided. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in Thce Times, was taken as read. The C xAnna&c, in moving its adoption, said the earnlngs of the undertaking were steadily on the increase. The increase of the traffic on the Eastern Counties, I Norfolk, and Eastern Union lines, as comtared with the corresponding half-year of 1856, was 2e,000L., of which the share allotted to the Eastern Union, after deducting working expenses, was 1,7001.. This enabled the directors to mee' the proprietors with an imp roved dividend. Twelve months since the dividend was 12s. on theA stock and 8s. onthe B and C stock; to-daythe dividend would be 15s. on the A stock and lOs. on the B and C stock. This was an encouraging state of things. During the last seven half-years there had been a growing increase in the receipts, and he believed the proprietors might look forward to a better and better state -of things. Three years since the Eastern Counties Company advanced the Eastern Union| 200,0004 on debentures, aud he was happy to say that the debentures had been recently renewed, the Eastern Counties Company having found that they could renew them without any detriment to their own interests. Mr. JOCELYN seconded the motion for the adoption of the report and accounts, which was carried, A resolution was also carried unanimously declaring the dividends of 15s. on the A stock, and 10s. on the B and O stock. M1r. WEBB, one of the directors, complained of the as- counts rendered by the Eastern Counties Company, and I advocated the raising of 100,(001. with the view of clearing off outstanding liabilities and closing the capital account. He also urged the importance of keeping up a full number of trains on the Eastern Union line. It would affect the arrangement for amalgamation. The CHAIRMIAN, adverting to the suggestion for closing the capital account, said the directors were most anxious to close it, but the difficulty was to raise the snm required to pay off all liabilities. WVith regard to the traffic arrangement, the only alternative open to the Eastern Union was to commence law proceedings, and the burden of the proprie. tors' song had always been ' Don't have recourse to lawvv" The proceedings closed with a cordial vote of thanks to the chairman and directors. SOUTH YORESH1B:. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Sheffield yesterday; Dr. Dymond in the ohair. The directors' rerort, of which an abstract appeared in The Tnmes of Monday, 'was taken as read. The CHAIR3LaN congratulated the shareholders on the steady increase of the traffic as shown in the accounts. The increase during the last half-year had been at the rate of 21 percent. The amount paid in dividends during the corresponding half-year of 1856 upon the ordinary and preference stock was 11,3171., and the amount payable for the present half-year 15,5001., so that there was a considerable increase in the gross amount- but the capital on which dividend had to be paid was also greater, and that, with an increase in the rate of interest and other things, had rendered thishalf-year's dividends less han the directors had hoped they would be. The traffic receipts had, however, increased at the rate of 5001. a-week every year for the last four years, and if that increase continued, as there was every reason to hope, he trusted they would be able to make a better dividend in fature. Mr. H. STANIFORTH, of Shbffield, remarked that du-ing the seven weeks that had passed of the current half-year the tralic had been less than before. The CrOArnasi explained that at this particular period the traffic, especially in coal, was smaller than during the rest of the yeas, znd the diminution had been still greater this year owing to the Great Northern having overstocked themselves with coal to secure a reduction in the oharge for transit. They had no doubt the increase during the latter pbrt of the half vear would be snoh as to make an inorease at the end of the half-year after the rate he had mentioned. Mr. STANIFORTU said the increase of traffic ha4 been satisfactory, but he was disappointed that the dividend should have fallen from 4 per cent. last to 2.1 per cent. this half-year, though the net traffic receipts were about the same. He complained that the working expenses were 54 per cent,, while the maimum of well-managed lines was from 40.to 45. Mr. BAXTR stated that if they deducted 2,0001. paid for the rent of the Barnsley branch the working expenses were only 49 per cent., which for a line of 30 miles, the principal traffio on which was coal, was not unreasonable. The directors were, however, reviewing the whole expenditure to see where economy oould be introduced. The extendion to Readby could be made at a cost of 3,0001. a-mile without an Act of Parliament, but the directors had notthought it desirable to further increase their capital until the shareholders were inreceipt of a better dividend. The receipts had increased 5001. a-weekeach sucoeeding year. Au addi. tional 5001. a-week would give them 4 per cent. next year, *nd another 5001. after that 6 per cent. Their present receipts had been obtained in a continued unfavourable state of the coal-market. They could not get t,o pame rate for carriage with low as with high prices of coal, and when he told them that ld. per ton increase on the present charges for carriage would give a-half per oent. dividend they would see how the price of ooal must always act on the line, After some further observations the report was adopted i Ihe dividends were declared, and the proceedings concluded 'with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors l SOMERSET CENTRAlh The report of the directors states that the sntm received from the Bristol and Exeter Company for rent of the line, from Eighbridge to Glastonbury for the past half-year amounts to 1,8091., and from other sources to 2521, making a total of 2,0611. on revenue account. The disposable balance, including 1931. from the previous account, is 1,605. The directors rec3mrmend a dividend on the original shara Caplitl of 70,0001.at the usual rate of 4 pernt per anm, leEc income-tax, which Will leave a balance of 2724 The directors propose to issue 850 shares, representing 17,00L.. to complete the 3ine to Wells, as preference sabres, at 5 per cent, The surveyor has been instructed to treat for the purchase bf the requisite land. 'The extension to Buraham is finished, and will shortly be opened for general trsffic. essrs. Rigby are to construot the extension to Brnton for 85,0001. The warrants for the dividends wil be -issued on the 3d of September. The engineer's reportstates that the Biruhamn branch has been passed by the Government inspector, and that the works on the Wells line can be put in hand as soon as the directors are in possession of the neces8ary fands. The plans of the Braton line are complete, and the land is being purchased, so+hat the works may be commenced at an early pernod. Thedcapital account showed tbat 110,3171. had been received, and 108,4751. expended, leaving a balance of 1,8421. STOKES BAY. A meeting of the Stokes Bay Railway and Isle of Wight Ferry Company was summoned for yesterday, but, there not being a quorum present, it was adjourned until October. TREE3=NGLISH AND IRISE M AGZINETIC TELEGRAPH COMIPANY. An extraordinary meeting of the shareholders was held in Liverpool ye5teeday for the purpose of winding up the company under tho provisions of the Joint-stock Companles Act; Mr. Crosby occupying the chsir. The CHIAIIRAN explained that the resolution which was about to be submitted had already been unanimously adopted at a numerously attended meeting of the shareholders under an Act which was then imperfect. A supplemental Act had beer peased thin session, and it therefore became necessary that the resolution they had previously carried should be again come to. Mr. PAacixiu then moved, and Mr. JoNisS seconded, the following resolation:- "That the Ehnlish and Dish Msgnetto Company be wosud up voluntarDy under the proYislons of the Jolnt stock CoLupauea As% 1863-57." [The affairs of this company and of the British Company have been merged into one company called "The Mag. netic Telegraph Company."] Mr. T. D. HoRNBY moved the adjornment of the meeting 3!L-. CosN stseconded the amendment. The CHAIRMI&? said the directors bad come to the determination that whatever the arrangement was between them and the patentees it should be carrned out honourably, fuly, and fairly. The amendment wras lost, and the original motion carried by 14 to 3. The CRHAncSrA? stated that the income for the quarter ending the 3st of March last was 15,20l, in round numbers, and their expenses 8,8004, leaving a net profit of 6; 4001.; in the quarter ending the 30th of June their income was 19,2801., and their expenses 10,4081., leaving a net profit of 8,8701. against G,4001. on the previous quarter; so that their income for the half-year was 34,0001. and their expeuses 18,600., leaving a net rofitof 15 4001., which had given to th5English and -Trish company 5 per cent., and to the British 4 per cent. as arranged. after psaing interest on preference shares, Dt. leaving 1,0301. as a reserve fund for the next half-year. Six weeks of the present qularter had ge:e and a comparative statement ofthe business done on the first six weeks of the two previous quarters would show a still more gratifying result. The net revenue in the six vreeks of the first quarter was 3,105,; in the six weeks of the second quarter, 4,400t., and in the six weeks of the third quarter, 4,685i, showing a regalar -increase. (Cheers.) He did not pledge himself to any .promise, but had no doubt that their dividend for the current half-year would be 6 per cent., and ofthe British 5 per cent., with a further surplus added to profit. (Cheers.) Be might also mention that the saving effected by the two companies working together had been at the rate of 7,5004 a-year. iCheers.) This terminated the proceedings, and the meeting separated. The following are the receipts of railways for the past week:-
BsrmlsHARcrEoLoarccr AssocrArTo-,r.-OnThursI day a large party of the members of this association started for Great Yarmouth for the purpose of inspecting the antiquities of that town and the neighbourhood. The visitors were received in the town-hall by the mayor, Mr. 0. C. Aldred. Mr. C. J. Palmer, deputy mayor, officiated as oonductor of the party in the absence of Mr. Aldred, and the I visitors first proceeded to inspect Air. Palmer's mansion on the south quay. This house was built in 1596 by Mr. Benjami Cowvper, and it afterwards passed into the possesion of Mr. John Carter, whose son, Benjamin Carter, married Mary, daughter of General Ireton by his wife, Bridget, eldest daughter of Oliver CromwelL If tradition is to be believed, a final meeting to eonsult as to what was to be done with Charles L, previous to bringing him to trial was held in one of the apartments. Mr. Palmer next conducted the party to the fragmentary remains of Gray Friars Monastery. Attention was directed to some merchants' marks in front of a house on the Soath.quay, and a visit was paid toa house close by, in vwhich there is a fine moulded ceiling of the timeofJames . Some remains of theold town wall and a de fence raisd in 1588 against the Spanish A rmada, which was then supposed to he near the coast, were also pointed out N-Ath the ruins of some towers of the date of Henry II., and one or two other objects of interest, Mr. Palmer pointed out some curious archways, &c., and exhibited a charter of ling .John, by which Yarmouth was made a free port. The comWany then proceededto the beautiful church of St. Nicholas, muit ahout the year 1100 by Herbert de Losinga, Bishop of Norwich. The srchitectural features of the church having been explained by Mr. Palmer and Mr. 0. E. Davis, the p arty proceeded, after a short interval of rest, to Caistor Castle, said to have been built by Sir John Fastolf about the early part of the 15th century. The oastle is in ruins, and caly some portions of the north and west walls, with the tower, remain. A paper was read bv Mr. T. J. Pettigrew on the history of the castle and on a Roman station supposed to be the ancient Garianonum. Prom Caistor the party proceeded to Burgh, from which place they returned to the Town-hallat Yarmouth. There a public dinner took place, and a meeting At Mr. Pualer's house fOllowed. Finally the visitors returned to Torwich by a special train, which left Yarmonth at 10.30 p.m. Yesterday an excursion waS made into West Norfolk, East Dereham Churob, Walsingham, and Biuham Priories, and 2ast B,rshauv-hall being among the objects of interest visited.
