THE CAPTUBE OF DELHI. THE OFFCIA DESPATCEES. FROM 1 AJOR-GXRBP A. WISOX, COMMAYWING Dznur FIELD FORCE, TO THZ ADJUTANT-GEwxrEL Or ml ARMY. Delhi, Sept. 22. Sir,-In continuation of may de h of the 16th inRf r now have the honour to forward a report, for the informetion of the Major-General comandLng in the Upper Pro. vinces, his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, and the Government, of the further operations of the force under my command since that date. During the 17th and 18th we continued to take up advanced posts in the face of conidderable opposition on tho part of the rebels, and not without loss to ourselves, three (3) officers being killed, and a number of men kldled and wounded. On the evaning of the 19th the Barn Bastion, which had given us oonsiderable annoyance, was surpried and captured. On the morning of the 20th our troops puahed on and occapied the Lahoresgate, from which an unuopposed advance was made on the other bastions and gateways until, the whole of the defenoes of the city were In our hands. From the timeof our firt entering the city an uninterrupted and vigorous fire from our gu and mortars was kept up on the palaoe, Junna Mwjtd, and other Important posts in possession of the rebels; and as we took up our varioug positions In advace, our light guns and mortrs were brought forward and used with effeet on the streets and houses in their neighboarhood. The resut of this heavy and unceasing bombardment, da of the steady and perevering advanoe of our troops, has been the evacuation of the palace by the Kng, the entire desertion of the city by the inhabitants, rnd the precipitate flight of the rebel troops-who, abandoning their camp, property, many of their sick nd rwounded, and the greater part of the'r field artillery, hare fled in utter disorganIzation,.sonl 4,000 or 5,000 across the bridge of boats Into the Doab, the remainder down the right bank of the Jumna. The gate of the palace having been blown In, It was occupied by our troops at about noon on the 20th, and my head-quarters estAblished in it the same day. The great dimirution of our strength by losses in action during the last few days, added to the severe sickness prevailing among the troops, has prevented my immediately orgazing and sending a column in purasit, but a force,* under command of Lientenant-Colonel Greathed, will march to-morrow morning towards Bolundshulhur and Allyghar to intercept the rebels, whose intentions are said to be to cross the Jumna at Muttra. My intelligence, however, I regret to say, is very defective. The King, who accompanied the troops, it is believed, for some short distance, last night gave hisnalf up to a party of Irregular Cavalry, whom I had sent out in the direction of the legitives, and he is now a prisoner under a guard of Europeant soldiers. Three of the shahzadtrs who are knownto have taken a prominent part in the-atrocities attending the insurrection have been this day captured by Captain Hedson, and shot on the spot. Thus has the imnportant duty committed to this force been accomplished, and its object attained. Delhi, the foous of rebellion and insurretion, and the scene of so much horrible cruelty, taken and made desolate; the King a prisoner in our hands; And the mrttineers, notwithstanding their great numerical superiority and their vast resources in ordnance, and all the munitions and appliances of war. defeated on every occasion of engagement with our troope, are now driven with saughter in confusion and dismay from their boasted stronghold. The details of the operations have been so fully entered into in my previOus deapatch and arnexed reports and returns from the various coramanding ofiicers that little remains for me to say, but to again express my unqualified approbation of the conduct and spirit of the whole of the troops, not only on this oocaion, but during the entire period they have been in the field. For four months of the most trying season of the year this force, origialy very weak in number, has been exposed to the repeated and determined attacks of an enemy ar outnumbering it, and supported by a numerous and powerful artillery. The duties imposed upon all have been laborious, harassing, and incessant, and notwithstanding heavy losses, both in action and from disease, have been at all times zealously and cheerfully performed. I beg to add my most cordial concurrence in the commendations bestowed by officers commanding brigades, columns, and detachments on the offioers and men named in their several reports, and I have to express my own deep obligations to those officers themselves for the valuable assisatace I have at all times received from them. To Mlajor F. Gattskell,who recently assumed command of the artiery luthe- field, consequent on Brigadier Garbett having beeui disabled by a wound, and to the officers and men of that distinguished arm, to whose energy and untiring zeal the successful isgue of the operations is so largely attributable, I hAve to offcr my hearty thanks. And particularly am I indebted to that excellent officer Lieutenant-Colonel Hogge, Director of the Atillery DepSt, who volunteered his services as Commissary of Ordnance with the siege train, through whose able superintendence of the park and arrangements for the supplyof ammunition to the batteries our artMery was enabled to deal out the destruction which was effected; as also to Captain J. Young, Deputy Commissary, and Mr. J. ftolesbary, Assistant Commissary of Ordnance, for their exertions during the whole siege. To Lieutenant-Colonel Baird Smith, Cbief Engineer, who, in ill health and while suffering from the effiects of a painful wound, devoted himself with the greatest bility and assiduity to the conduct of the difficult and Important operations of the siege; to his galant and eminently talented second, Captain A. Taylor; and to the whole of the officers and men of the Engineer Brigade, my thanks and acknowledgments are especially due for having planned and successnfully carried out, in the face of extreme and unusual difficulties, an attack almost wlthout parallel in the annals of siege operations. To that most brilliant officer, Brigadier-General J. Nicholson, whose professional character and qualifications are so well known and appreciated, I am under the greatest obligations for the daring manner in which he led his columna to the assault; and I deeply denlore that his services are for the present lost to the State. To Brigadier Hope Grant, C. B., Commanding the Cavalry Brigade, and to Brigadiers J. Longfield and W. Jones, C. B., Commanding Infantry Brigades, I am deeply indebted; and I have to offer my best thanks to Colonel G. Campbell, commanding fler Majesty's 52d Light Infantry, and to that intrepid and exceUent officer, htajor C. Reid, of the Sirmoor Battalion, both wounded whil4 gallantly leading columns of attack; as alEo to Colonel J. Jones, commanding the 1st battalion 60th Royal Rifles-a regiment which has shown a glorious example both in its daring gallantry and its perfect discipline, to the whole force-for the ability with which he covered the advance of the assaulting columns. I have pleasure also in bringing favourably to notice the services rendered by Lientenant-Colonel 1 P. Burn, attached as Field-Oficer to the lst brigade of Infantry, and by Captain Seymour Blane, Her Majesty's 52d Light Infantry, Major of Brigade to Brigadier-General Nicholson. Colonel J. L. Denniss, of Her Majesty's o2d Light Infantry, whom I placed in charge of tbe camp during the operations, is entitled to my thanks and acknowledgmrents for the able dispositions le made with the troops under his command for the dne protection of his Important charge, To the officers of the General Staff of the Army, and to those of the Staff of the Field Force, mycordial acknowledgments are due for the admirable manner in which they have performed their responsible duties. To that very distinguished officer, Brigadier-General N.B. Chamberlain, Adjutant-General of the Army, who, though still incapacitated byEa severe woound previously received, proceeded to the ridge at Hlndoo Rao's, and performed sse itial service after Major Reid had been wounded and it became necessary to resume that position. To Captain H. W. Norman, Assistant Adjutant-General of the Army, who on this, as on each and every occasion, has been distingui8hed by his gaUantry, zeal, and professional ability. To that experienced officer, Major P1. S. Ewart, DeputyAssistant-Adjutant-General, and his gallant and energetic coadjutor, Captaln D. M. Stewart, Deputy-Assistant-Adja. tant-General, who hare conducted the duties of this important department with the force much to my satisfaction; and to Captain E. B. Johnson, Assistant-Adjutant of Artillery, who volunteered to command the 24-pounder breaching battery, most ably and effectualy carried out the duty assigned to him, and who rejoined my persoDal staff on the morning of the assault, and who has throughout these operations given me tho most zealous and efficient sup- port, I am greatly indebted for the assistance they hare afforded me. I beg also to bring very favourably to notice the officers of the Quartermaster-General's Department, Captain D. C. Shute, Captain H. ML Garstin, and Captain W. S. P. Hodson, who has performed such good and gallant eervice with his newly-raised regiment of Irregular Horse, ind at the same time conducted the duties of the Intelligence Department under the orders of the Quartermaster.GenerAl flat Troop, ot Brigado Hore Artillery. 2 ditto, 3d dttto No. 7 I4ght mield B%tteTy, 9t:h laucerm, lt, 2d, *nd Eth Puniab CAvaby, 1Fods=ns E3om (O2O, 2 oompies PonJb Sapp Her Majestl's Eth Regimtnt, Her HAestb's 71h ditto, Sd xud 4th Panjab Infantry. t Mlhza MoghuI, leflzS Kme.r SFltan, 'oD of Fe Ktatg; KjrZb Abo" BuW, gpn, ditto, with rare ability and suocess, also that actirve and glant offioer, Lieutenant F.

IL Turnbn)l, 2rd alde-d&camp, Captain E. F. D. Lowe and Ileutenant F. C. Lowe, extra aides-de-camp, I am under great obligations for the zel and readiness with hich tey on this and all other occasions have performed their dutlea. My thanks ae als due to Major.EL A. Oavry, who attnded mo on the day of the aault. For the valuable aid at all times rendered bytthe offioer5 of the civil service lwho have been attached to the force I have to record my warm aoknowledgments. Mr. Hervey Greathed, agent to the Deputy.Governor, North-Western Provinces (whose subeequent sudden death I deeply lament). and Mr. . B. Saur, ders, both of whom attended no in action and made themselves most useful; Sir T. Melalfo, Whose gallantry in conducting Colonel Campbell's asa ult_ in& column through the city was conspicuous; and Mr. B. W. Clifford, who was also in attendanco on me, are all entitled to my thanks. While, however, in acknowledging the servioes of thos officerc whose good fortune it was to be present at the as. sault, and In the action of the 14th, I have only peorfmed a grateful duty, I should be greatly wanting if I faled to record the names of those who have previouslydistingulShed themselves, but who, incapadtated by wounds or siclmess, were unablo to join In the operations of that day. Among these I have specially to notice Brigadier st. G. D. Showers, whose cool gll-ntry on the numerous cocasons in which he haa bes engaged has been conspicuous. AlEo Colonel A. Becher, Quartermaster-Genernl of the Army, who, though prevented by a severe wound, recelved In June last, from taking an actve part 3n the fied, has at Al tmes rendered me zeslous assistance. " Lieutenant-Colonel T. Seaton, C.B., of the 33th Native Infantry, attached to the force, a most valuable and experienced officer, of whose services I have been deprived owing to a wound received by him on the 23d of Jly. "That admirable officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Murray fc. kenzie, oommanding the st Brigade of Horse Artillery, of whose services I have also been deprived by a wound which he received when in charge of the heavy batteries at am early stage of our operations. That officer so distInguished In our frontier warfare, Major J. Coke, commanding the 1st Punjab Rifles, severely wounded at the head of his regiment on the 12th of Angust . and the gallant comnmander of the Guides, Captain H. D. Daly, who was very severely wounded leading a most daring charge on the enemy's guns in the action of the l9th of June. I need not observe how largely the success and effciency of an army depends on the regularity of its supplies. 'Under circumstances of peculiar difflculty, in a district the popu lation of which has beon inimical, and in which civil autho rity has ceased to exist, this force has, from the commence ment, been kept well and sufficiently provisioned with sup plies of every dewription, the issue of rations to the Soldiers having been as regular, both in quantity and quality, as in cantonments. My warmest thanks are therefore due to Lieutenant-Colonel W. B. Thompson, Deputy.CommissaryGeneral, the admirable and indefatigable head of that department in the field; as also to Lieutenant T. H. Sibley, prk. cipal executive officer; to Liertenant Waterfield, and to the other officers serving in that department. With the medical arrangements of Saperintending Surgeon B. Tritton I have every reason to be satisfied, and he is entitled to my cordial acknowledgments. At such a trying season of the year, and In a notoriously unhealthy locality, the sickness and mortality have, of course, been heavy. In addition to those sufferings from disease, the hospitals have received almost daily accessions of wounded men. The labours, therefore, of the medical department have been unceasing, notwithstanding there has not been at any time the slightest failure in the arrangements for the care and comfort of the very numerous patients. Among those medical officers whose unwearied zeal and supedror abllity have come promlnently before me, areOfficiating Superintending Surgeon C. i'Rinnon, M1.D., who has been in the medical charge of the Ist brigade Horse Artillery; Surgeon J. H. Berr Innes, 60th Royal Rifles; Surgeon T. P. Brougham, 1st Fusileers; Surgeon E. Haue of the 2d Fusileers; Asistant-Surgeon J. J. Clifford, M.D., of the 9th LAnoers; and Assistant-Surgeon W. F. Mactire, MLD., on the personal staff of the late CommanderIn-Chief. Credit Is also due to Surgeon D. Scott, M.D., medical storekeeper. The duties and offices of l'rovost-Marshal to the force have been conducted by avery deserving old non-commisdoned officer, Serjeant-Major Stoud, 3d Brigade Horse Artillery, whom I rocommend to favourable consideration for a commission. The names of other non.commisloned officers deservig of a similar reward I shall have tho pleasurc of submitting hereafter. I should neither be fulfilling the ropeatedly expressed wishes of tho Artillery officers attached to this force, nor following the dictates of my orwn inclination, if I failed to acknowledge the valuable assistance which ha3, throughout the operations before Delhi, been most cheerfully given by the non-commlissioned officers and men of Her Majestys 9th IAncers and the 6th Dragoon Guards in working the batteries. Without it, owing to the comparatively small number of artillerymen, I should have been quite unable to man the batteries effidently, or to keep up the heavy fire which, aided by these men, I have happily been able to do To these regiments, therefore, and to Brigadier Grant, who so readily placed a certain number of his men at my disposal for such purpose, I tender my best thanks. It would be an omission on my part were I to pa over in silence the good services and loyal conduct of one who has already been rewarded by the Government for the friendly assistanco he rendered to our army in Affghanistau-I al. lude to the Wawab Jan Fishan Khan, who, with his brave nephew, Sirdar Bahadoor Meer Khan, and their retainers accompatied me from Meerut, was present at the actions on the Hindun, and has since taken part in noarly every action in which this force hs been engaged. Of the loyal services rendered to the State by the Rajah of Puttiala, which must be so well known to the Government, it may not be considered necessary for me to speak; but it is incumbent on me in my capacity as commander of this force to acknowledge officiaUy the great assistanco the Rajah's troops have afforded me in enablng the numerous convoys of ammunition and stores to travel in ecUrity and safety to my camp under their escort aud protection. Equally is it my duty to bring prominently to the notice of Government the admirable serviee performed by the Jheend Rajah and his troops, under command of Lieutenant. Colonel H. F. Dunsford. They have not only had very haraing duties to canry out in the constant escort of convoys of sick and wounded men, ammunition, &c., but theY have also aided me in the field on more than one occasion, and finally participated in the assault of the city. Ladly, I trust I may be excused if I thus publicly acknolledge the all-important and invaluable aid for which Iam indebted to the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, Sir John Lawrence, K.C.B., to whose indefatigable exertions in reinforcing me with every available soldier in the Punjab the successful result of our operations is, I unhesitatingly pronounce, attributable and I take this opportunity of recognizing the advantage derived from the presence of the troops of his Highness the Maharajah Runbeer Sing in alliance with the British force, the moral effect of which has been great. And, although unsuccessful, I regret to say, in the actual accomplishmentof that part of the operationsin which the Jummoo' Contingent was engaged on the 14th, I can attach no particle of blame to those troops, as I consider, under the circumstances in which they were placed, the very strong posi. tion which they had to attack, and the prolonged and determined resistance which they encountered from an enemy superior to them In number, arms, training, and experience, that they behaved, under their gallant commander, Captain R C. Lawrence, and the other British officers serving with them, to whom my best thanks are dne, as well as they could have been expected to do. I hat' AX- ., -l A. WIIZON.

DARING Bur;GLARY.-In the course of Thursday night or early on Friday morning au extensive robbery was committed at the premises in the occupation of Mfr. W. Rayner, jeweller, situate In the central thorough. fare of Castle-stree,, Swansea, and witbin a short distance of She police station The burglars, who were evidently accomplshed hands, entered the house through the coal drop. Hlaving thus reached the coal cellar, the entrance to the jdtehen was a matter of comparative ease. By means of a carpenter's " bit'' a round piece of the door was taken out and the bolts withdrawn. By the same process every door between the kitchen and the shop was dealt witb, and so noiselesly that although three or four persons slept in the house not a soutnd was heard. Having reached the shop, the thieves made sbort work of It. They carried off between 60 and 70 gold watches, varying in price from 51. to 241. - from 120 to 130 silver ditto, ranging m prioe from 21. lOs. to 91. ; a large nuraber of gold rings, a quantity of costly jewelry, besides all the cash found in the shop. In addidon to the above all the wvtches of customers under repair were taken away. The entire value of the property etolen is estimated at nearly 1,0001. The police are onthe alert, endeavouring to trace the perpetators of thig serious burglary.
CHINA. (mTiomz Ouir OWVN CORRESPONDENT.) SHANGHAI, OCT. 23. A change has come over the policy of the authorities in the south. The French Ambassador has arrived in the mouth of the Canton river. The projected northern voyage is definitively abandoned. It is reported that the order has gone forth that Cantoa shall be taken, and I must return to my post of observation. I hope to add a postscript to this letter with a Hongkong date. When we have settled our differences with the Cantonese, the scene of action will be removed to these northern ports. The Chinese officials, or " the Milandarins," as it is the custom to call them, are of opinion that our decisive move, in order to acerce the Court of Pekin, will be to cut off the supply of food to the capital. They reason, according to Chinese logic, from the precedent of the last war; and, for once, I am inclined to adopt the same conclusion, and from the same premises. In our previous experience the Court was immovable so long as we only killed, burnt, and destroyed in the provinces. Directly we put a muzzle upon the mouths of the populace of Pekin the Court was at our feet ; so it will be again. I have been investigating how Pekin is fed. I cannot quote my authorities without certain loss of the heads of my informants, but the following may be implicitly relied upon as in the main correct. There are nine of the eighteen provinces of China which produce rice, and have, or rather had, means of water communication with Pekin. These provinceS are-Fuhkien, Chekiang, Kiangsi, Shantung, Hupeb, Hunan, Kiangsi, Nganh%vui, and Szchuen. These provinces, according to ancient precedent, pay their tribute to the capital , in rice. They are botund to contribute in the aggregate 10,000 junks, each containing 1,000 piculs of 1331b. English; but in the arrangement of the proportion Shuntang and Hunan, on account of their poverty or their small extent, only pay as half a province each. This arrangement gave an annual supply of 10,000,000 piculs to the Imperial city, which, at the regular allowance of about llb. per day per mouth-such is the capacity of the measure meted out to the soldiery-would feed a population of 3,000,000. The calculation, therefore, as is necessary in all large calculations, allowed largely for a difference between figures and facts. The rebellion, however, and especially the occupation of Chekiang, upon the Yang-tse, has deranged this comfortable state of things. The provinces southof the Yang-tse can no longer communicate with the capital by the inner waters; Szchuen Is obliged to send silver to Kiangsi, and there purchase the rice which could not be sent from the province itself. In recent years the 10,000,000 piculs have been enormously diminished; and the Pekin Gazette has contained many lamentations on this score. So late as the 26th of September there is a memorial on this subject. The number of the 20th of September contains the answer of officers to the urgent orders already given to collect rice and send it round by Tiensin. There is no trade at Pekin, and the supply is necessarily a very critical affair. Nankin formerly sent three millions, and Nankin bas now other mouths to feed. The China merchants who bought the Szchuen rice were never paid, for the four lacs of dollars sent from that province to pay for it were embezzled by the Mandarins-an irregularity which has not tended to facilitate matters. The other provinces had experienced iaundations and locusts, and had Imperial or rebel armies in their neighbourhood, and they paid their quotas with difficulty. But still, tautt bien qwe rmal, Pekin has been fed. The supply, however, no longer reaches the city as formerly by the Imperial Canal and the other ianer waters, but the junks start from the coast, and by seaboard they voyage to the Gulf of Pecheli and the mouth of the Peiho. The custom is to gather the rice together upon the coast so soon as the harvest is got in. About the 1st of January of our year the Custom-houses lay embargo upon the junks, and retain them for the annual voyage to Tiensin. Immediately after the commencement of the new year, which occurs early in February, the junks start, and, struggling against the adverse monsoon, make their way in perhaps five or sixweeks to the mouth of the Peiho. About the tenth day of the second month is the day calculated for their arrival, for by this time the ice has disappeared from the river. If this freight should arrive safe in Pekin our war with China wil last for 12 months longer. The Chinese are quite alive to this their vital difficulty. They are talking of assembling this year's fleet at Lehoo, a place not marked in our maps, about fifty miles to the north of Woosung, which was used for the same purpose when Shanghai was in the hands of the rebels four years since. The Government has lately also been buying some steamers. They now have three in their service, and, although chasing pirates and quelling rebels is the ostensible object, I fancy that towing rice junks at a critical moment is their real destination. That rice is being collected with extraordinary activity in Kiangsu, and that the mandarins are under strong pressure, are evident. The Chinese say there is generally a stand of wind on the 10th moon (January) under favour of which the junks can work up north. The seheme is not badly conceived, and it may possibly be successfuL The mandarins shrewdly calculate that in. all probability the barbarians wlll take it for granted that the junkB will not sail northwards tiU the change of the monsoon, and that they will not care to keep the sea and blockade the coast in January, and it the filat-bottomed rice boats can once escape up into the gulf of Pecheli, that gulf wiUl be so shallow at that period of the year that the steamers cannot folow them. If they can run into the Yellow River they will also be safe, for thence northwards the inner waters to Pekin are open. It is impossible to guess what insuperable impediments the courtesy of the French Emperor towards his long-tailed Imperial brother, or the " mother wit" of Mr. Commissioner Reed, or the instructions from Downing-street, may interpose to a blockade of the whole coast north of Shanghai, but I take it that if left to their own devices neither Lord Elgin nor Admiral Seymour is a man to allow such a march as this to be stolen upon them. With Canton in hand, and with this fleet of rice-junks kept outside, Lord Elgin's road to Pekin would be strewn with flowers, and his negotiations at the Court would be of a very curt and satisfactory character. It is an uncomfortable thing to have to state any fact upon Chinese authority, for you know that if a falsehood will serve the turn they never have recourse to truth. The Chinese, however, all tell me that the Russians have been to Tiensin, and they give me circumstantial details of the transactions there, and name even the officers commissioned to meet them'. According to these accounts the two Governments are upon the most friendly terms. The Chinese affirm that the object of the visits of the Russian admiral to the port of Shanghai has been to keep the Court of Pekin informed of the preparations and intentions of the English, and they hint that the Russians have led them to believe that at the proper moment Russia will interpose her mediation to settle the differences. If these statements are not true they are weU invented. The two Courts are undoubtedly aux petits soilS just now. The Pekin. Gazette of the 26th of September reports the return of E-ke-le, a Chinese of-ficer who had been sent to the Court of Rusia to present condolences on the death of Nicholas. The Gazette simply states that the Envoy, having had an audience with the present Emperor, had returned. Perhaps I am inclined to believe more of this information because I get it fror peculiar and exclusive sources; but, at any rate, it is safe to conclude that the Chinese are quite alive to every point of the game they are now playing, and that they are disposed to avail themselves of Russia. Before we leave Shanghai I must ask the British public to accompany me in a morning walk upon the Bund. It will be hard if we do not find some few scenes there illustrative of Chinese life and manners. We will start from the hotel, which notifies its whereabouts in the rear of the settlement by a high flagstaffand a most demonstrative banner. The street wefollowis bounded bythegarden walls and entrances of several " hongs "-ornamented detached residences resembling a little the villas in the Regent'spark. Our path is through a crowd of jostling Coolles. Tney are carrying, balanced on their bamboo poles, chests of tea, bales of silk, bricks of Syeee silver, and burdens more multifarious. It is hard work. They earn by continuous labour nearly 8s. a-day. But a man is worn out in about seven years, and he then retires on bi ecQnomies, And enjoys bia )Mdly- earned leisure upon a small plot of ground in the interior. ve now see them at full work loading and discharging cargo. Each as he goes emits a sound like the moan of a man in pain, " Ah ho; ah ho." From early morning till eventide this chorus of sorro'aful sound flls the air. It is more multitudious and monotonous than the croak of the froIs in the swamps, than the harsh grating cry of the, cicad(e upon the boughs. The habit, so far as I can discover, is confined to this port; but a Shanghai porter can no more do his work without his " Ah ho !" than a London paviour can get on without his " Hough." When the English first came here the house servants brought up the soups and the legs of mutton singing their " Ah ho" in procession through the dining-room. This was promptly put down; but the out-of-door chorus sttll proceeds. Every moment from 800 chests comes this sad monotonous cry, depressing to the spirits of new comers. We make our way through this croaking crowd, and debouch upon the Bund-the broad embankment, having on one side the wide river, with 70 square-rigged vessels lying at easy anchor in its noble reach; and on the other side the "ccompounds," or ornamental grounds, each containing the hong and the;~godowas of some one of the principalEuropean commercial houses. The only building on the Bund which is of Chinese architecture ir, the Custom-house, which is like a josshouse. There is something going on at the Custom-house. The Toutai's suite fill the outer courtyard. Some 20 fellows wearing mandarins' caps with fox-tails sticking out behind have swords at their sides and form the military escort. Their trousers are much patched and their odour is not fragrant; yet, if one of these ragged ruffians would come to London and r,ubmit to he washed Mrs. Leo Hunter wonld ask lords and ladies to meet him and present him to her guests as " a mandarin from China,." There are two curious creatures having enormous gilt hares on their heads and pheasant feathers protruding behind. They are rather shabbier and dirtier than their military comrades and look as though they had been turned out of Mr. Richardson's booth for lack of cleanliness. There are two executioners, conspicuous by their black conical caps, their dark costume, and their iron chains, worn like a sword belt. The larger one is said to be of wonderful skill in taking off heads; the smaller excels in produci,ng exquisite torture with the bamboo. Let us go inside. There is incense burning, and priests are chanting. Mandarins, with white or red buttons to their caps, silk dresses, and very dirty hands, are knocking their heads upon the ground before a little joss. It is a Chinese ceremonial day. They have turned the Custom-house into a josshouse for the nonce, and are come here to "chin-chin" the God of Wealth, which means to pray for a good harvest of import and export duties. The rite is soon performed, the Toutai comes forth, the procession is formed. It would look splendid in drawing or photograph, but it is squalid and ludicrous in its shabby reality. The Toutai mounts his pony, the large crimson parasol ia raised above his head- " Ilnterque slgna turpe militalia "Sol spicit conopiumn"-I and the cort6ge moves off. About this Custom-house there is a grave matter to be debated. At the instance of the three treaty Powers the Chinese authorities have established at this port a triumvirate of European inspectors, or collectors of Customs-an Englishman, a Frenchman, and an American. They were originally selected by their respective Goverinnents. They each receive 2,0001. a-year-a salary not too great to compensate them for the odium which the discharge of their dutiesinvolves. The English Government has ceased to interfere or to recognize Mr. Lay as havimg any other capacity than that of an officer of the Chinese Government. The French and American Consuls retain an influence in the nomination and control of the inspectors of their respective nations. The effect of this Custom-house arrangement is that the duties of the port of Shanghai are received in full. At the other ports the old system of corruption prevails, and the Chinese cellectors make their private bargains-usually about one-half of the tariff prices. Nothing but strong intrinsic vitality has enabled the trade of Shanghai to thrive, in spite of this great disadvantage. The English merchants are divided in opinion upon this subject of duty collecting. Some think that the Chinese should he left to themselves; that we should deal with the officials as we do in England with the farmers of turnpike tolls, every man making his own contract bargain. Others think that the inspecting system should be extended to aU the ports. A third party are in favour of the abolition of all dutiea at the ports, allowing the Chinese to collect their own import aud export duties inside. It is a difficult subject, almost impossible to be satisfactorily arranged by any treaty which shall give to the Chinese Government the action of an independent Power; but the difficulty arises from the incurable corruption of the Chinese magistracy, and the crumbling rottenness of the Government. Having to deal with such a nation, the necessities of self-protection give us rights which we should not have if we were dealing with honest men. There is a sound of gongs, and a crepitation of smaU crackers at the north end of the bund, and the coolies leaving their work to look on. As it is a day for sight-seeing, and sight-seeing is our business, let us follow the crowd. It is a burial procession. The mother of a Chinese opium broker is going to her last home. She carries with her all her little comforts and necessities wherewith to begin life in the next world. Many palanquins appear at unequal distances, preceded and followed by coolies marching four abreast. These litters contain small joss-houses, and basins holding fruits, and sweat meats, and bean cakes, and other orthodox Buddhist comestibles. There is good store also of silvered and gilded paper made to resemble solid ingots of gold and silver. This is the wealth wherewith she is to appear in the land of ghoats as a respectable, well-to-do matron. But if this bullion pass current among the ghosts, they have lostthe qualities which most distinguish them in the flesh. In life a Chinaman can distinguish the exact fineness of a piece of silver by the touch, so muoh so that the word "touch" is used as a technical term to indicate the quality of each description of bullion; it must be very harrowing to the feelings of the ghost of a Chinese comprador to find himself obliged to deal in these shadowy ingots. On marches the procession. There are little boys blowing sbhriU trunmpets and other stranger wind instruments, men excruciating our ears with cymbals and gongs, and grave adults exploding strings of erackers. Then comes the coffin-a strong wooden case like a carved and ornamented trunk of a tree. It is half covered by draperies, and is borne by 12 coolies. It is hermetically sealed with that tenacious plaster the Chinese call "cehunam." It will he borne to a josshouse in the city, and thence to a spot in one of her son's fields. Here it will rest on the surface of the ground. After the time of mourning is past a few spadefulls of earth will be shovelled upon it, then year by year a few more till a mound arises and rank grass and Cbinese lilies spring up, and this old lady's habitation adds another unit to the myriads of sacred burrows which cumber the ricn soil, and serve no purpose but a harbour for the pheasants when the crops are cut. Our English books upon China say that only hills are set apart for this purpose. Sir John Davis falls into this error. But our English writers, for the most part, write only of what they have seen on the banks of the Canton river. Between Shanghai and Keehim, I have seen thousands of acres of alluvial soil which the plough never turns because they are sacred to the dead. We have plenty of time to look about us, for the procession yet drags its slow length along. The denizens of tbe Bund have turned out to look, and business is proceeding. There is an English merchaut arranging the sale of a cargo of rice with a Chinaman. "Wantee numba one bad licee for that sojernumba one bad licee ?" '5lNumber one bad rice for your soldiers," says the indignant Briton. " Why, we always have the best provisions we can obtain for our soldiers and sailors." Heaven forgive the patriotic man of commerce ! but he never saw a weavelly biscuit, or opened a tin of Crimean preserved meat. "0, maskee, nuniba one bad licee too much good for sojerinan." X We are separated from these bargainers by a fisherman and his wife, who push their way by. The lady, who is not in her premicre jeunesse, has large natural feet, and, having tucked up her trowsers, displays a pair of calves whieh an Irish porter might envy. Takiffg advantage of their wake, stiffly totters upon her small deer's feet an ordinary Chinawoman of. the urban population. She has no pvys Wgtever. The X CIVlq of hlg leg v ere destroyed by the operation which produced that beautiful foot, and from the knee downwards her leg is but skin and bone.. Do you ask how this strange deformity is produced ? Stand back out of the crowd, inside the entrance to Mr. Hearers compound, and I will tel you. There are small-footed ladies at Hongkong who gain a very fair livelihood by exhibiting their pedal extremities to sea captains and other curious Europeans at a dollar a-head; but, as so superficial an examination of this national peculiarity did not satisfy me, I had recourse to some of my good friends among the missionaries. By their aid I obtained that some poor Chinese women should bring me a complete gamnut of little girls from the missionary schools. Many of these female children probably owed their lives to the persuasion (aided by opportune donations of rice) of my missionary friend and his lady, but their influence had been powerless to prevent the torture of their feet. On the appointed day they were all seated in a row in my friend's library, and their feet, which I suspect had undergone a preparatory washing, were unbound by their mammas. The first was a child of two years old. Her penance had just commencea. WVhen the bandage of blue cotton was taken off I found that the great toe had been left untouched, but the other four had been forced down under the baU of the foot, and closely bound in that position. The child, therefore, walkied upon the knuckle joints of her four toes. The toes were red and inflamed, and the ligature caused evident pain. In the next three children (all of ages advancing at small intervals) the preparation was only to the same extent; it was confined to the four toes; gradualy, however, these four toes, ceding to the continual pressure, lost their articulations and their identity as limbs, and became amalgamated with the sole of the foot. In the eldest of the four the redness and inflammation had entirely disappeared, the foot was cool and painless and appeared as though the four toes had been cut off by a knife. The foot was now somewhat the shape of a trowel. In the fifth girl I saw the commencement of the second operation-a torture under which sickly children frequently die. The sole of the foot was now curved into the shape of a bow; the great toe and the heel being brought together as near as possible. Take a jujube and double it till two points of the lozenge nearly meet, and you will see what I mean. This is done very gradually. The bandage is never slackened-month by month it is drawn tighter-the foot infilames and swells, but the ! tender mamma perseveres-as the bones aud tendons accommodate themeelves to the position constrained by the bandage so it is drawn tighter. At laat the ball of the natural foot fits into the hollow of the sole, the root of the great too is brought into contact with the heel. The foot is a shapeless lump. The Instep is where the ankle was, and all that is left to go into the slipper and to tread the ground is the ball of the great toe and the heeL This is the small foot of the Chinese woman-a bit of toe and a bit of heel, with a mark, like a cicatrice left after a huge cut, running up between them. Two of the girls were yet suffering great pain, and their feet were hot and inflamed, but in the eldest the operation was complete. She had attained to the position of a small-footed woman, and her feet were quite cool, had no corns, and were not tender to the touch. One of the mammas, influenoed perhaps by a llttle liberality in the article of rice money, intrusted me with a Chinese mystre de toilette. Sometimes, it seems, when a woman is expected to have to do hard work, her toe and heel are not drawn so tightly together as to produce the true "small foot." To disguise this imperfection upon her marriage day she has recourse to art. A piece of cork, shaped like an inverted sugar-loaf, is strapped on to her foot, and the small part goes into her slipper and passes for her foot. Thus are we poor men deceived! While we are gossipping about small feet the old lady's bulrial procession comes to an end. It would be hissed at Astey's, and would be regarded with blank astonishment at the Princess's, but it is very successful at Shanghai. The opium broker has done his duty as a good son. If he keeps his two years of mourning properly, and if none of his wives should commit the indiscretion of having a child withintwo years, comnmencing from nine months after this time (for the prevent Emperor is supposed to owe all his misfortimes to an unfortunate acciIdent of this sort), he wil be esteemed a very respectable man for evermore. The Bund resumes its normal state, and the "Ah ho's " are again in ful chorus. What snall we do next? It is half-past 1 o'clock, tiffin time at Shanghai. Youhave made yourcalls on ariving here, and your cards have been duly returned, so you are free to go and come at tiffln time in all their hospitable hongs. No lack of good dishes or of pleasant iced drinks at a Shanghai tiffin. Where the junior partner, with his employ6s of silk inspector, and tea-taster, and bookkeper and clerks, holds a separate mess, the allowance from the house to that mess is never less than 50 Shanghai dollars per month per head, or something more than 2001. a- year to each employ' for the table alone. We may enter boldly. There is no chance of finding people making shifts with small commons in China. There is a great charm in European society at aU the ports. Everybody is able, and is, indeed, obliged to have a lordly indierence to expense. They cannot control it, and they must let it go. There is no struggling and contriving to keep up appearances. The profits are large and the expenditure is greatlaissez aller. Tiffin however, is a bad habit, if we can keep ouk of it. iet us rather stroll towards the city and trust to chance for a light lunch. " A'Iin, get a Coolie and folow us with some dollars and some cash"-the rascal wouldn't carry a string of copper cash himself to save his father's tail. it is a long stretch from the English settlement to the Chinese city. We must pass through the French concession in front of Mr. Conolly's hong, wherein that gentleman, with exaggerated Shangai hospitality, has just taken in a distressed Singapore tiger, whose roaring attracts a crowd of Chinese around his gates. A Chinese city is no novelty to us who have journeyed together through so many of them; but a festival day always has some objects of interest. In Pekia the "Board of Rites" busies itself about many things; and among others it sets apart two days in every month as the days upon which alone marriages can take place. To-day is one of these days, and in consequence thereof several gorgeous palanquins, like rniniature Lord Mayor's coaches taken off their wheels, and containing ladies all splendid in jewels and gold, are passing through the narrow streets, These ladies have jewelled crowns upon their heads, and veils of strings of pearls falling over their faces, and embroidered satin tunics, and fans of gold tissue. They are going, properly accompanied, to their new homes. One of them is just entering the house of a distillerwith whom I have some acquaintance. We shall be welcomer; let usgo in. The house is decorated for the fete. It is hung with lanterns inside and out. The courtyard is fu]l of relatives and hangers-on; and at the gate is the comprador, who receives the money offerings of the visitors; the prln- cipal room opening upon the courtyard is prepared for the feast. Lanterns are hung from the ceilings, a small joss house with candles and incense before it is at one end, and in the middle is the table on which stand the small basins of sauces and sliced shellfish, and goose flesh and sweetmeats, and cakes, which are the precursive appetizers to a Chinese dinner. The bride- groom (the son of the proprietor) is lounging on a chair in his shirt-sleeves smoking ; the bride is gone up to her chamber, where she is sitting on her nuptial couch and receiving her guests. We may go up if we please, but it is less trouble to wait and look about Uw til she comes down. We crack a joke or two with the bridegroom, and he retires to put on his gorgeous array, and then the bride appears followed by her retinue of bridesmaids, and escorted by an old wom an, the go-between who has made upthe mateh. Wepresentourselves in due form, and the bride, who, in spite of her high crown and embroidered tunic and trousers, looks nervous and twitchy and slightly convulsive, just as she might if her name were Brown and if we had accosted her at the door of the vestry room of St. George's, Hanover-square, returns our salutation and would like to pass on. But such is not selon Ze3 r~gless. The duenna insists upon our admiring the beauty of the headdress and the thickness of the embroidered satin whereof her tunic is made; but, above all, she wiU pull up the trousers to exhibit the faultless proportions of the little feet. They are marvellouly small. A flea couldn't find room to hop in that slipper. " Chin, chin I " let us be off. There is another decorated dwelling on our way, but it is a cottage, and presents a di9gQj awne, Tbre Mmv Mg dAin9klg saxk shu at table, while the bride, dressed in her borrowed bravery, Sits on a barrel in the most dis. tant corner, alone and unnoticed. To-morrow and for ever more she wMll be a beast of burden. Perhaps, however, she will, in the fulness of time, oreate her own distractions. A few years may probably see a crowd cf mangey brats, exhibiting every form and species of cutaneous complaint, fighting and yelling over their rice basins, and, aided by tiee mother's shrew voice and the grandmother's croak, making their neighbourhood unbearable. Such a family lived opposite to my bedroom window at Ning,po. From early cockrow to sun-down the screams and shrill cries were unintermittent. The nuisance burst into being all on a sudden; but I found, on inquiry, that it had existed in its present aggravated form about two years before, and was then cured. After many vain remonstrances an English merchant complamned to the Toutar. Next day the lord of the house was sent for to the Prefecture, and being suspended by the thumbs received 40 blows of the bamboo; he was then dismissed with a warning. When that respectable housekeeper returned disjointed and macerated to his dwelling he went in and shut his doors about him. What happened in the bosom of that family no man may know; but thenceforward the rice was eaten Inside the house, and the screams did not vibrate in the street. When I heard of this I thought I would try what a threat of the Toutar would do; so I sent my boy down with a message. He returned with the air of an envoy who has failed. " Well, what does the woman say ?" " She talkee no care-last moon husband dead." We must on, it is not pleasant to linger in the streets of a Chinese city. The porters jostle you, and the palanquins push you aside, and the smells assail you. The French Jesuit, to whom a compatriote applied to send her specimens of aU the finest scents of China, rather exaggerated when he replied, "Alas! Madam, in China, there isbut one scent." and that is not a perfume." There are many scents, but with the exception of the white blossom wherewith they scent their teas none of them are perfumes. We bustle our way through the narrow streets. We pass the temples and the yamuns, unentered, for we have seen a hundred such before, and we reach the tea gardens of Shanghai city. These are worth a visit, for they are the best I have seen in China. A Chinese garden is usually about 20 yards square, but these cover an area of ten acres. It is an irregular figure flanked by rows of shops, rudely analogous to those of the Palais Royal. The area is traversed in all directions by broad canals of stagnant water, all grown over with green, and crossed by zigzagwooden bridges, of the willow pattern platemodel, sadly out of repair, and destitute of paint. Where the water is not, there are lumps of artificial rockwork, and large pavilion shaped tearooms, perhaps 20 in number. Here self-heating kettles of gigantic proportions are always hissing and bubbling; and at the little tables the Chinese population are drinking tea, smoking, eating almond hardbake or pomegranates, playing dominoes, or arranging bargains. There are interstices also of vacant land, and these are occupied by jugglers andpeepahow men. From the upper room of one of these teahouses we shall have a view of the whole scene, and A'Lin will order us a cup of tea and some cakes for lunch. The jugglers ancd gymnasts below are doing much the same kind of tricks which their brethren of England and France perform. M. Houdin and Mr. Anderson would find their equals among these less pretending wizards. I am told that those peep-shows which old men are looking into, and laughing, and which young boys are not prevented from seeing, contain representations of the grossest obscenity. Here is a ventriloquist who, attracted by our European costumes at the casement, has come up to perform. " Give him a dollar, &'Lln, and tell him to beDoin." That dirty, halfclad wanderer would make another fortune for Barnum. He unfolds his pack, and constructs out of some curtains a smaU closed room. Into this he retires, and immediately a little vaudeville is heard in progress inside. Half a dozen voices in rapid dialogue, sounds, and movements, and cries of animals, and the clatter of falling articles, tell the action of the plot. The company from the tea-tables, who had gathered round, wag their tails with laughter, especially at the broadest sallies of humour, and at the most indecorous dirdouemts. In truth, there is no difficulty, even to us, in comprehending whnat is supposed to be going on in that little room. The incidents are, indeed, somewhat of the broadest-not so bad as the scenes in our orthodox old English comedies, such as The Custom of the Country, for instance, or The Cosciotts Lovers; but still they are very minutely descriptive of facts not proper to be described. The man's talent, however, would gain him full audiences in Europe without the aid of grossness. "Ho lai"-" fire, there." Shall we light a cheroot and stroll about? Don't make too sure, Mr. Bull, that the gentleman in the mandarin cap, who is holding you by the button and grinning in your face, is saying anything complimentary about you. In a journey up the country a fat Frenchman, who had equipped himself in an old mandarin coat, a huge pair of China boots, and a black wide-a-wake, was leaning upon a bamboo spear, while his boat was being drawn over one of those mud embankments, which serve the purpose of our locks. He also was very much flattered at the politeness of an old man who prostrated himself three times before him, and chin-chin-ed him. Unluckily an interpreter was present, who explained that this old man took our French friend for the Dev.l, and was worshipping him in that capacity according to Chinese rites. In fact, the Frenchman in his antique disguise rather resembled a Chinese idoL. But ask the French Consul at Shanghai about this; he can tell the story better than I can. Some of the best shops of Shanghai city open upon the tea-gardens; some resound with the buzz of imprisoned insects and the song of caged birds; there are " curio" shops, where are to be seen antiquities of dynasties long anterior to the Christian era, carefully wrought by living hands; there are caricatures of the English barbarians, one of which I cannot refrain from buying ; there are carvings in bamboo, very inferior to Canton; there are shops for fans, and embroideries and silks, decidedly inferior to Ningpo. There is also the studio of a portrait painter, not probably a dangerous rival to Lamqua, of Macao. There is loud talking in that studio. A Yankee captain is inspectingaportrait of himself, which has been painted at a contract price of some $20. The Yankee is a man about 40, with streaks of gray in his bushy hair and beard, with a slight defect in one eye, a large nose, and a pockmarked face. Yet, withal, thanks to his affluence of hair and an expression of jaunty deter. mination and devil-may-care go-aheadness, he is a manly-looldngfellow. Heislookingruefully,however, at this counterfeit presentment of himself which is to go to the girl of his heart at New York. It is a most laughter-moving caricature of all the salient points of his physiognomy. The Yankee swears that it is no more like him than hickory nuts are like thunder. The artist has produced a small lookingglass, which he places beside the portrait, and, pointing to the gray hair and the squinting eye and the pockmarks of the portrait, and then to the present originals from which they were copied, says triumphantly at each verification, " Hab got Hab got? BEab got. How can make handsome man 'spose no got handsome face V' Let us leave these parties, for there seems likelihood of a hot dispute, and, arming ourselves with another che-oot as a defence against bad smells, retrace our steps through the city, and out at the east gate. We are again upon the Bund. The sun is down, and the European population are tak;ing exercise in the short twilight. The merchants and their wives are returning in carriages or on horseback from their ride round the racecourse, or are walking; the missionaries and their wives are riding up and down on their ponies. The shadows grow deeper, and you can scarce recogni2e your acquaintances as they pass. And now, Mr. Bull, it is time to go in and dress for dinner. I hope during our day's stroll I have given you some notion of the city and settlement of Shanghai, which, if you are a wise man, and open up the Yang-tse-EKang, will be a most important place both to you and to your descendants for many a long generation. HONGKONG, Ocr. 30. After a rapid and most comfortable passage of four days I am back "home" in Hongkong, just in tine to keep you informed of the only matters having the least importance which have occurred since my departure for the North. You will have heard last mail by the news from Singapore that the Audacieuse and the French Plenipo had at last arrived. The day after the departi9 9f t&g MBAr9 r ossteamed intoharbour, anl with polite or kindly haste immediately proceeded unaccompanied to the Ava, without even sending notice of his coming. The meeting of the two Plenipos had the cordiality of the non-official andi unceremonious meeting of two private gentlemen, one of whom had been accidentally kept waiting and the other anxious to express by his manner and empressement that he regretted the ' delay. Next day the harbour resounded with salutes, and the two Ministers met at dinner at Government Elouse. The Audacieuse returned to her anchorage off Lintin, and diplomatic communications have since then been frequent and, as it is said, most amicable. The gunboats are arriving daily, but Captain Sherard Osborne, who has to keep his chicken together, is not yet come in. It is necessary to tow thes craftupagainstthe north-east monsoon, but it iS scarcely worth while enumerating the actual arrivals for they will -probably he all reported a ashort distance off by the steamer which takes this letter. It is a nleasure to be able to congratulate our Adnuralty. 'They may be honestly proud of the achievement of the Imperador. On the morning of the 28th that fine ship steamed into harbour in admirable time after a passage almost unrivalled of 631 days (at sea) from England to Singapore. She bringa 500 marines, and she brings them out in the first-rate condition. Only Th men in all were on the sick list. Yeaterday she proceeded up the Canton river to the Wantung, where barracks have been provided, and where, it is to be hoped, the men will retain their present health and effciency. We are now in eager expectation of the arrival of the sister ship the Imperatrix, supposed to be about three days behind her. This mail will probably bring you more certain tidings of her. It is no secret that something is now about to be undertaken. We shall probably wait the arrival of the whole of the slender force allotted to us. 3,000 redcoats are not a too numerous army to bring to reason an empire of 300,000,000 of people; but sO soon as we have all we are to expect we hope to be able to tell you that Canton is in our hands. All our superfluous doctors and Comnmissariat officers are off for India. It is understood that GenLeral Ashburnbam and staff, and Colonels Wetherall and Pakenham go by the next maiL. General Straubenzee remain wFithus, and I hear but one sentiment with respect to this officer. He has impressed all here with full confidence in him as a leader of energy and conduct.
LORUD DERBY AND MB. VYRROf SAXTH. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Having been alludad to as the author of the information upon which Lord Derby founded one of his charges against Mr. Vernon Smith-namely, that he had sent a communication to the Peninsular and Oriental Company to inquire whether an arrngement for the transmission of troops to India could be made, after it had actually been ooncluded under the sanction of the Governmentwill you kindly permit me, through your columns, to set myself right with the publio as to the patt which I havo had in that matter 2 The facts arn simply these :-For some time previous to the month of September last some personal and verbal coinmunicationsJhad,taken place between some of the directors and officers of the East India, Company and the managing directors of the Peninsular and Oriental Company relative to the transmission of troops to India, both by the fortnightly mail steamers and extra steamers, Lad on the 7th of September an official letter from the Court of Directors of the East India Companywas reoeived, requiring the Peninsular and Oriental Company to submit proposals for an arrangement to that ef'ect. After further personal communications the arrangement was concluded, and the necessary instructions settled and forwarded both to the agents of our company and the proper authorities in India of the East India Company. I happened to be absent from the office on the day when the defini ivo settlement of the details were concluded. This was done on the part of our company by my coleague, Mr. Allan, assisted by the secretary, Mr. Howell. On my return to the office I roceived from them a verbal reporS of what had been done in this affiar. They stated that it had roquired much active exertion on their part to get the details finally settled as between the Board of Control and the India-house in time for tho instructions being forwarded by the outward mall of that day, and, as a curious incident, mentioned that after all had boen finished and the instructions despatched a raessenger came down from the President of the Board of Control to inquire whether such an arrangement could be made ! This incident struck us with some surprise, and, if we drew the inforence from it that the President seemed not to be aware of what was passing in his own office in an affair of certainly no minor importance, it will perhaps be allowed not to have been an unnatural one. We, however, set It down as a mistake, and thought little more about it. Some few week afterwards I happened, in an after-dinner chat with a friend, to mention this incident in the same terms in which I now relate it. He, it appears, in relating it to some one else, had misunderstood me as to the inquiry being made by message, and not by letter. Bat for this and the other additions which it seems to have received beforo It reached Lord Derby, I beg to disclaim any responsibility. I have stated the whole trath as far as I am concerned in the matter, and I trust the manner in which I have been identified with it will plead my excuse for this trespass on yoar valuable space. I am your obedient serrant. ARTHUR ANERSON. raws, 1H, Rue des Champs Elys6ees, Dec. 12. P.S.-Recollectlng that there is no delivery of letters in London to-day I deferred posting the foregoing yesterday, I have now just read in Thc Tine8 of yesterday tho report of what passed between Lord Derby and Lord Granvill on Fdday, and it is with great annoyance that I find that a letter which I addressed under cover to a friend, explaining the matter in similar terms to the foregoing, and which ought to have been in Lord Derby's hands on Thursday last, as I forwarded it hence on Wednesday, has been withheld. The consequence is that his Lordship has been deprivod of tho means of giving the true grounds of his statement, and I have been placed in the very dishonourable light of having originated a misstatement and then sBhrunk from au explana. tion. Why my letter was withheld I am at present unable to say; but I feel anxious to relieve myself as early as possible from my present very unpleasant position, and therefore trust to your kdndness to give this an immediate insertion.

t:ioUs ACCIDENT AT CARDIFF.-For several weeks past tho trade of this port has been almoest at a standstiU. First of all, there was the dispute between the Taf Vale Company and the coal-freighters, the lAtter refusing to pay the extra tolls demanded, and the company conse. quently keeping all the coal locked up on their line, &ne! pertinaciously objecting to allow any to be tippedunless their demands were complied with. This was quickly followed by the strike of the corners at Merthyr, Aberdare, Pontypridd, the Rhondda VaUey, and, in fact, throngbout the whole of the hiUs in this neighbourhood; and, as it thIs were not sufficient at one time, we must bear witness (as we usually do) to tho trath of the proverb that " misfortnnes never come alone." About three weeks since notice was given that on and after a certain date no more vessels would balowed to enter the East Bute Dock, as the contractors intended clearing avway the embankment between that portion already in use and the extension just completed. For this purpose the water was turned out of the dock, and the inner gates of the lock were taken up, not being considered sufficiently strong to bear the pressure of water upon them, and another pair was ready to be laid down. The contractors, Messor Hemingways andl Pearson, put on a large number of hands in removing the bank, and it was thought that the work would have ben completed in abont a month to the satisfaction of all parties. We regret however, to state that about 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon (the water being out) a large portion of the eastern wall gave way, carrying with it the foundation, the tramway, and a quantity of Iron ore which was alongside. The wall for at least 60 or 70 yards is completely gone, the angle where the salp occurred projecting some 10 or 15 feet be. yond the level, the stones being separated from each other, and some of the large blocks of forest stone, about three feet thick, being completely smashed-some of them into a thousand pieces. iNone of the wall has fallen Intco the dock, but it Is feared that another slip may take place at any moment. The tramway, which was close to the stone work, has sunk about 10 feet, and se simultaneous was the fall that for a distance oE about 30 or 40 feet the rails are las level as they were before; some of the irons, however, were doubled up as short as one's finger. The cause of all this can now be seen, although it was not before ant,cipated, A great quantity of Iron ore is brought to Cardiff from. Whitehaven and other places, and some ,G000 tons have been standing on the bank. A portion of this has been remos ed opposite the basin during the past fortnight, but, judging from appearances, some 4,000 tons are now remaining onx the bank. Added to this a railway has been constructsd, warahouses have been buUt, and excavations for hydraulic pumps made, before the ground had become sufficiently hardened to bear such a continuation of disturbings. The ground on which the docks were constructed-the Old, as weU as the East Bute Dock, was comparatively, only a few- ears since, nothing but marshes, being completely covered the water from the Bristol Channel at high spring. tides. In the year 183S the Bute Dock was opened, having been constructed by the late Marquis of Bute, and the trade of the port so Increased in consequence that It was found neessay to constraeb another dock of still larger dimensions; and, a contra_t. having been taken by messrs. Hemingways and Pearson, the portion of the East Dock which has now given way was opened in July, 1855, in the presence of the outhful Marquis of Bute, tho Marchioness of Bute, and thousands of spectators, the day beiug kept as a general holyday. The cost of this portion, we bei eve, was 250,000L, and at the time It was stted by competent authorities that there was no better masonry In the united kingdom. We believe, however, that no fault can be laid to the oontractors, but that the heavy weight on the banks, and the support sud. denly withdrawn by letting out tho water, have been the sole cause. The damage is estimated at between ll.OOOL and 15,0001., but it is feared th&t if another slip alonui occur the whole of one side will have to be rebuilt. humbers ofmen are already employed in removingtherubblsh o the quay.

FOBBIGN INTBLLIGEBOB. - PRANOE AND SPATN. (1TJOM OUR Ov'N CORRMSPON2DE T) EA port!on of tho following appeazed in our second edition PARIS, SuNDAy, Dza. 13, 6 r.Mr. For some weeks before the birth of the Prince of the Asturias a sharp discussion was carried on among the Madrid people ac to the name which the dEpected Royal Highness should bear. They were t0ot so far wrong in this respect. It's all very fine to say " What's in a name ?" There is a great deal in -a name, and when such an authority is quoted it must be remembered that Shakspeare puts the exclamation in the mouth of a young girl over Lead and ears in love, and therefore of doubtful sanity. Tlhe anxiety of the public about the name, or rather names, to be given to the heir of the Spa. nishThrone shows a more than ordinary appreciation of human nature. People have ever given, and very probably ever wlll give, importance I o a name. Even the success of the productions of genius may be affected by it, and fame or obscurity has not rarely depended on the name of the claimants. We have lost a glorious epic poem from the pen of an American poet simply because the Transatlantic Virgil was called Timothy Dwight, and, in. spite of our better judgment, we have doubts as to what sort of epic any Timothy;could write. Sterne, who treats with much humour the elder Mr. Shandy's system of baptismal names, strongly advises godfathers not " to Nicodemus a man into nothing." The name of a French writer of the 17th century, remarkable for his pomp of style, was Gueux (a beggar); to assimilate his name to his gorgeous diction he assumed that of his estate, and he is now known to the world as Balza¢. The name of one of the purest Latinists of the 16th century, the most elegant and the most witty, was originally Garaerd; is it certaiun that he would hold the place he does among men of letters had he not refined his rough Dutch appellative intothe smoother Greek, Erasmus; and the miild Melanothon of the Reformation would probably come down to us with a far different reputation had he retained hiz original inauspicious patronymic of Herz Schwartz, or Black Heart. To his despair of managing the old rugged Roman nomenclature we owe it that 'lrgil gave up his design of a national epic; and, In modern times, the idea of immortalizing in heroic verse the discoveries of Drake was abandoned from one of the chief companions of the Admiral's exploits being called Tom Doughty. Long names appear to have been, from remote times, generally popular. E3very schoolboy is familiar with the unreasonable ridicule heaped by Demosthene3 on his great rival for having added two syllables to his father's name, calling him Atroelos instead of Tromes. Diocles might be a suitable name for a private individual, but it swelled into Dioclesian when the Lame man assumed the Romax purple, and the Simon of Lucian, on inheriting a large fortune, grew into Simonides. Of all people Spaniards have ever shown the greatest partiality for voluminous and sonorous names, and the utmost horror and contempt for ahort ones. A Spanish Ambassador in the time of Queen 33izabeth very nearly made it a casus belti because an Alderman named John Cut was the person ordered to receive him. He was only appeased on learning that the worthy citizen maintained a style of living which was anything but monosyllabic; and he passed over the shortness of h1is name for the sake of his ample hospitality. It is clear, then, that the Spanish courtiers showed praisewortby foresight in deliberating long and carefully on the name of the future Sovereign. A private letter from Madrid, of the Sth Inst., gives some particulars about this important subject:- The ceremony of baptizing the Prince took place last blght. The GaeLvle of to-day will, of course, give a full account of It. You are aware that the personage who represented the Pope as godfather was the Nuncio, Monsignor Barelli, who has just arrived. He presented with great pomp last Sundxy his credentials to the Queen, ag well as an autograph letter of his Holiness to the King. Some incidents not unworthy of notice occurrod during the , oremony. The officiating ecolesiastic was Father Cyril de la Alameda, formerly a Carlist. The godmother was the Marchioness Mslpica. You may remember that Qaeen Christlna had done the same duty for her who but yesterday was Princess of the A.starias, but who now is simply the' Infanta. The Duke and Duchess do Montpensior were present, and the latter might very well have acted as god. mother Instead of Madame Malpica. The passive rGle given;to this amiablo couple, and the modest and unassuming manner it which they presented themselves, attracted general atten. lion. It vasremarked that Gencral Narvaez remained, during the whole time the ceremony lasted, and that was nearly two hours, among the scraidumrbre, the members of the household, in the centre of the chapel, one of a countless multitude of gentlemen of the chamber, &a., and apparently -with no inclination to occupy the place set apart for FieldMIarshals Concha, O'Donnell, Serrano, and the ex-Ambassadors Olozaga and Pacheco. Narvaez preferred to this company those who may be termed the public spectators of the ceremony-who occupied the aisle of the chapel-to those who had the honour of a distinct gallery. Finally, when tho moment for baptizing the infant came It was remarked that some Important accessory had been forgotten. What it was I am unable to say. The Prinoe received the names of Alfonso, Francisco de Assis, Juan, Mariano de la Concepoion, Fernando, Plio, Jaime, Pelayo. For some woeks previous a serious difference of opinion existed as to the first name to be given to the Prince, and it extended to the courtiers and the Royal Family. 'Divididos escaban Cabateros y Esctderos,' as our (1ervantes says in one of the chapters of Dor. Quixote. Her 3faiesty was said to prefer the name of her august Consort, 3'ranclsco, whioh is also honoured by being borne by her more august unole and father-in-law, for all counted on a Prince of the Asturias. In this, you perceive, all were right, and so mnuch satisfaction is felt, that the chief physician 18, they say, to have the title of Marquis. It vas thought then that wev lo should have a Francis I. as the sovereign of Spain, in the full conviction that ours would throw into the shade the King of -whioh France is so proud. From the moment of the arrival qof Monsignor Barellt, who was to represent his Holiness as sponsor, a slight opposition appeared in the Palace against the name of Francisco. The whole of the Moderado journals s6t-to to discuss the names of all our dynasties, vho, of course, belonged to the same party, with a view to select one of the best, alleging (which was not complimen. tary to the King) that Francisco wvas originally but a sort of Frech sobriquet given to St. Francis of Assisium from hIs superior acquaintanco with the French language, which he studied in order to follov the professlon of hls father, who was a merchant of Ombria, in Italy. They proposed Alfonsos, Philips, Charleses, and Fernandos-some of the latter not bleing, however, of very happy memory. The battle of names lasted some time; at last Alfonso gained the day. Alfonso is indeed a glorious name in the early history of our country, from the first period of our wars of indepondence with the Arabs and the Moors to the last of the name lnthe 14th century, Alfonso XEL, who was happy in war and great in peace. Who, do you suppose, was at the head of 'the Alfonsistas 9 Why, every one says It was the King, Don Francisco himself. He yielded, however, to the vdshes of {he Queen. The partisans of the old regime wished their ruture Ring to be oalled Fernando VII., or Charles V., or John, by way of a-delicate compliment to John Mastai, now? Pope Pius IX- In this they contemplated an bistorlcal assimilation which, generally speaking, is mot unfounded. They preferred a name with an odd number, as these were borne by the most suetcssful sovereigns of Spain. Isabella I. (the Catholic), 4Charles L (the fifth of Germany), Philip V., and Charles mi. are pitted against Philip If., Charles II. (the last of the Austrian dynasty), and Charles IV. (the kidnapped of Napoleon L), not to speak of St. Ferdinand (III.) among the former. But in tho exceptions we have a Ferdinand VL, who was one of our best Kings, and, on the other -hand, Ferdinand VII., one of the worst. Finally, if the Prince of the Asturis lives to reign over Spain, he will be Alfonso XII.-an even number-so that the partisans of the -odd number are beaten out of the field. Had he been svalled Toha he would be the third of the name, aud as Charles he would be the fifth. Frolh the warmn h with -which the discussion was carried on one would suppuose that -the name was everything. Qui viera vsr-a-the Prince has 17 long years to pen through before he attains his ma. lority. "In the meantime iho Gazetle is full of the favours acoorded on this auspicious oocasion. It is superfluous to obeve that the most faivoured of all are our men of war. A dozen or so of LloatenanutColonels (rather modest) are =xdo full ColsIels, and 22 Colonels have blossomedinto -Generals of Brigade. I take It for granted that this is only an earnest of what ix to eome, for there will probably be a -1 crop of preo# Wong among the higher classes of the army, without eounVing the titles of every sort, length, and -deaomiuatIon, and, a asl, the rarest if not the rihest. In this respect we n*ed not oext our imagination much; we may take as a model for tho style and titles of the new noblesse the official Gaette of Hayti The most popular part of the buiness is the amnesty-and for this, so far as it goes, the Government deserve poaise. Ia a few days we shall be occupied with maore serious matters." Some of the Madrid journals express gratitude to the Queen for the amnesty to political offenders on the occasion of the birth of the Prince. They state that- " In addition to that amnesty, and to numerous military promotions, an order had been glven that all persons arrested by the preceding Cabinet on what is called aduninistrative measures should be set at liberty, and that redactions of the periods of punishment, varying from one-fifth to one-half, of condemned criminals should also be made. At the baptism of the Prinoe, the King, the Infante Doa Francisco de Paula, the DaLe and Dnchess de Montpensier and their children, and the Infanta Donna Christina, were present." The Bspanc says "During the ceremony his Royal Highnesg cried frequently; and his cries, which were loud, sounded most agreeably in the ears of all present, for they proved that he is a robust infant After the baptism, the Royal child was conveyed by the King, accompanied by the Dalke and Duchess de Montpensier, to the Qaeen,who bad remained in her chamber. A little later, the Prince was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, with all the ceremonies usualonsuchoccaslons. The Kinghimself decoratedhimwlth the collar and other insignia; among the latter was a orucifix of oak, ornamented with brilllants, called the ' Cross of Victory,' famous for having figured in battles against the Moorm, -which -was presented to the King by M. Mon and some other gentlemen as a deputation from Ovledo, In the Asturias, to which town it belonged. The Prince was also made a KBnight Grand Cross of the Military Order of San Juan de Jerusalem, and of the Orders of Charles IML and Is5bella the Catholic. The Duke de la Victoria (Espartero) bad sent his congratulations to the Queen on the birth of a Prince of the Asturias." Besides the Gironde,whichI have already mentioned as being fitted out at Toulon for China, the corvette Laplace and the gunboat Alarrne are likewise ordered for the same service. The Gironde Is a screw transport of 1,200 tons, built of timber at Rochefort, and carries four guns. Her machinery is of 150horse power. The Laplace is a screw corvette likewise built of timber, and is of great speed. Her machinery, which is of 400-horse power, was manufactured atthe Government works of Creusot. The Laplace carries 10 guns. The Alarme is a screw gunboat of the first class, and carries four guns of the largest calibre, Twenty-seven nuns of the order of St. Vinoent de Paul are about to leave for China. The French Goverrnent has, in pursuance of an arrangement with the Porte, appointed a French Consul at lbraila, in Wallachia, on the Danube. Hitherto there has been only a Frenoh consular agent at that port. An attempt was made at Anoona on the 2d inst. to launch the ship Adria Dorica, of 1,600 tons, the largest vessel ever built in that port. The entire I population of the town anxiously awaited the result; but when the attempt was made, either from the dock being too small or from some other cause, she stopped in her course, and is now lying broadside on the shore. AUl the assistance afforded by a steamer of the Lloyd's Company was unavailingto get her off. It appears that at a general meeting of the Council of State it has been decided that the rate of legal interest should be maintained in civil and commercial matters, and that in the latter it should follow the rate charged by the Bank. * AUSTRIA, (BOM OUB OWN COBB!SPOXDM.) * ~~VIENNA, Dxc. IL. The Vienna public is delighted that the Austrian Bank has been authorized by the Finance Department to lend a helping hand to the distressed citizens of flambtzrg, 'md the holders of bank shares are well pleased to get 6 per cent. on a capital which, under common circumstances, would have remained totally inactive until the resumption of cash pay. ments In January, 1859. The sum lent by the Austrian Bank to the free city of Hamburg is 10,000,000 of marksbanco (about 600,0001.) Silver, in bars, of the above-mentioned value will immediately be forwarded to Hamburg, and the loan is to be repaid in the same metal "within a year." It ia, however, said In the contract that the Republic on the Elbe can, if it pleases, discharge its debt at the expiration of six months. The Vienna finance world is vainglorious because Austria has done what Prussia either could not or would not do, but the foreign world is not likely to loze sight of the fact that the position of the banks of the two countries is very different. The Berlin establishment is obliged, on demand, to give hard cash for its notes, but the paper of the Vienna Bank is at a forced course, and c9nsequently it makes no difference -whether its metallic reserve is a little larger or alittle smaUer. It is runoured in Vienna and Trieste that the Austrian Lloyd's establishment will soon become State property. Should the steamers running between Alexandria and Trieate and Constantinople and Trieste cease to belong to a private company, would It not be necessary to have British agents on board the vessels to take care of the mail-bags ? The subjoined telegraphic news of the 5th inst. has been received from Constantinople:- "Lord Stratford is going to England. Mr. Allison has taken charge of the business of the Embassy. The Tuxrkish member of the Riverain Commission has returned to Constantinople. The line of railroad between the Danube and the Black Sea is traced, and the plans -will be laid before the Sultan for his sanction. Great preparations are being made for the reception of M. de Lesseps, who is expected to-day. The Smyrna firm of Loobner and Salzani has resumed payment." PRUSSIA. (FBOM OUR OWfN COntRESPOIDENT.) BERLIN, DEc. 12. In former letters I have kept you duly informed of the satisfactory progress of the King's convalescence; they showed that, as far as the improvement in his bodily health is concerned, there is very little left to be desired. The fact, however, of this Improvement of his bodily health not being accompanied by an equal or proportionate re-acquisition of his formner great mental powers has dashed the satis,faction it has caused to his admirers and well-wishers with a strange admixture of disappointment; it is now become evident beyond the power of doubt that, great and rapid as his recovery of bodily health has been, a total and lengthy seclusion from all affairs of magnitude is indispensably essential, if his life and the enjoyment of his mental faculties are to be preserved to him. This conviction, which forces itself upon all disinterested persons cognizant of what is going on, leaves that smali clique of which I have spoken on former occasions undisturbed and undamped in their ardour and activity in representing the King as perfectly recovered, "quite himself again," "as well as you or I ;" and to them it is imputed that, for the purpose of backing up the statements they are continually spreading abroad among the people, viz., that the Ring will certainly resume the reins of government at the end of three months' delegation, if he does not even on the 1st of January, they have contrived that the King should of late drive frequently into town, and show himself to his subjects in the apparent enjoyment of full health both of mind and body. as thls somewhat superfluous exhibition of royalty at the seat of power after the King has delegated his sovereign functions to his brother savours a little of want of delicacy towards the Prince of Prussia, people are unvwilling to attribute it to the King himself, whose consideration and thoughtful kindness are well known, but impute it rather to the influence of that bateful clique near the Tbrone, which, as recognized with tolerable justice by the country at large, is the real " evil genius" of Prussia. The tools and toadies of this clique, both in the press and in private, profess of late to have found the strongest confirmation of the King'n intended resumption of his sovereign powers at the end of the three months (January 23) in the fact that the marriage of Prince Frederick Wiliam has been postponed from the 18th to the 25th of January. They argue thus: the Prince of Prussia Is naturally very desirous of being present at his son's nuptials, the functions delegated to him do not admit of his leaving Prussia tiUl they expire, viz., 23d January, and, in deference to the feelings of the bridal couple, whose wedding-day has already been twice postponed, the very earliest day has been fixed at which he could possibly arrive in England after the termination of the powers delegated to him. The more correct view of the matter is, however, this :-To have left the wedding-day fixed for the 18th January now, while there is still time to alter and postpone it, would have Implied oa the part of aU concerned a wilful renunciation of the additional lustre to be derived from the Prince of Prussia's presence at it, and therefQre the earliest day has been fixed at which he can possibly be present con3istently with his engagements as they aci present stand; if; at the eleventh hour, the Prince finds himself prevented by State reasons from coming over, the two Royal families will yield to the inevitable neceisity of the case, and the marriage will be celebrated without his participation in the cererony. The component mermbers of the clique themselves are, however, far from any longer entertaining the above-mentioned sanguineexpectations thattheKing will be enabled to resume his sovereign functi6os on January 23, or even at the end of another period of delegation, or, infact, at all; for, supposing the physicians' dictum to be acted upon, that a lengthy period of abstinence from State affairs is essential to the King's entire recovery, is It likely that, at his age and with his constitution, a long period of compulsory abeyance from business coming close on the heels of such a ruinous ilness as his has been should not totally incapacitate him, even though restored to healtb, for resuming the reins of government, that have so long dropped out of his hands ? With a distinct perception that this is the real tate of the case as regards the King, and with a view to averting that abrupt termination to the state of things as they are which would ensue on the Prince of Prussia's assuming the Regency, which sooner or later he must do, in conformity with the professional and official depositions of the physicians when taken, this clique is already manceuvring underground to bring about a hybrid abnormal form of government, which will, at least in their eyes, have the merits of perpetuating the present lamentable r4gimne for the whole further term of the present King's life, and of thoroughly ruining thePrince of Prussia's prestige anud popularity, and his consequent capacity for effecting beneficial changes when once he comes to the throne. This notable scheme, as I gather from various hints that have come to my ears, consists in a co-regnancy of the King and Prince, not a coregency, say of the Queen, or anybody else, and Prince, but a sharing of the sovereign power between the King and his brother. This idea of a co-regnancy, however baroqite, has not even the merit of originality; there are precedents to be found for it at any rate in the history of the petty States of Germany. In Saxony, where the monarchical functions extend little furtber than to the internal administration of the civil affairs of a very confined territory, the late King was for a long time the associate of his father in the government, and became, as the Saxons called him, the Bei-Kl5nig (King-Assistant, or accessory King). In Hessen, subsequently, this precedent was followed, and for a similar reason as in the forner, viz.,-for the purpose of leaving the actual possessor of the sovereign power in undisturbed possession also of certain revenues attached to the retention of the sovereign dignity. For Prussia, however, where it has no precedent, such an arrangement is totally unfitted; not only is it perfectly repulsive to the genius of the Prussian monarchy, which is one and indivisible, perfectly autoethonic, and derived neither from Imperial investiture nor Papal grant nor Episcopal consecration, but it would also be found perfectly impracticable to work it, either in the home or the foreign relations of the kingdom. It would be destructive to Prussia's position in the comity of the five great Powers of Europe, from the Impossibility of foreign Governments knowing with whom they have to deal, while in internal affairs such a duplex arrangement would cause a constant appeal from Herod to Pilate, and back from Pilate to flerod, inasmuch as, however deep and warm the fraternal love may be that reigns between the King and the Prince themselves, it is well known that the influences which stand beside, behind, and around them both are as totally opposed to each other as night to day, reaction to progress, or narrowmindedness to enlightenment. Unfortunately (paradoxically as it may sound, I must, in his own and the State's interest, say 'ufortunately) the Prince of Prussia is posseased of so much delicate, respectful feeling to his brother and King, and so susceptible of the slightest possible imputation of-being actuated by a des3re to " usurp" or to take an undue and too prominent part in the government of the country during his brother's lifetime, that it is far from certain that he would not suicidally fall in with such an arrangement, abnormal, unfeaBible, un-Prussian as it is, if it came recommended to him by a desire expressed by his brother that he should do so. I say suicidaUy in the sense of the destruction such a step would entail on his prestige, his popularity, and his power of future usefulness; he would identify himself with the existing r6gime, and he would bind himself to perpetuate it for the entire remaining term of the lKing's life, for with an "undivided moiety" of sovereign power he would be helpless to do anything of consequence without the consent of his partner, who might be absent from the country, or incapacitated by illness, or with increasing old age and infirmity be more and more under the influence of injudicious advisers. The "powers that be," or rather the existing influences, flatter themselves that by having got thePrince to consentto administer the affairs of the kingdom according to the wishes and in the name of the King for a period of longer or shorter duration, they will so accustom him to their own sweet persons, their measures, and their views, that he will at length identify and conform himself to them ; in this, if it last no longer than three or six months, I think they are mistaken; but who could prognosticate the result if this state of things were to be perpetuated for years? The instinct of the people would certainly see in such an arrangement the destruction of all their long cherished hopes that centre on his head, and, failing him, on his son's. The qualities that are requisite in the present crisis of Prussian history are firmness rather than fine feeling, and, above all, it is necessary that before the next general elections como on the whole subject of proxy, co-regnancy, or regency should be made clear to the country, otherwise Prussia will be condemned to a further period of standstill for three years as certainly as she is condemned to it for the next ensuing year. TIE MONETARY CRISIS IN THE NORTH OF EUROPE. Advices from E[amburg, of the 12th inst. announce that the Assembly of Citizens had adopted theproposalof theSenatenot to placethe10,000,000 received as a loan from Austria in the Discount Bank, but to employ them in giving pecuniary aid to some great houses on the point of stopping payment, which stoppage would be a heavy blow to commerce in general. A " Commission of Confidence " has been formed to distribute the money. On the other hand, the Treasury is authorized to lend to the Discount Bank the surplus over what it requires, not exceeding 5,000,000. A proposition has been made to the Swedish Chambers to contract a loan of $10,000,000 to sup port commerce. I Norway has contracted a loan of $2,000,000 for the same purpose. A private letter from Hamburg, of the 10th inst., says:- " The financial condition of our town, far from having Improved since tho 4th, has, on the contrary, grown worse-so much so that this day six or eight firms of high standing have been compelled to stop payment. Other failures are expected, and the reaction will be felt in all the commeroial Cities of Europe. The consternation is so great that the savings-banks are orowded with persons, anxious to draw out even the smaUest deposits. The authorities have found it neoessary to have recourse to the military to keep order.' A telegram from Stockholm, dated the 10th inst., says: " With a view to meet the crisis, the following meoasures have been proposed to the Diet:- "A State loan of 10 millIons. "Employment of the disposable portion of the loan for railways to the amoUnt of 10 millions. "Permission for the banks to isue notes bearing intere3t. "A delay of three months to be granted to the debtors of the National Bark "M Modification of the bankruptcy law." Five additional houses have suspended payment at Stockholm. A great number of workmen have been discharged in the woodyards and sawmills. TURKEY AND THE CAUCASUS. (IxOM O1U oWMN CORvosMPQTr) CONSTANTINOPLE, Dzc. 2. In spite of the neutralization of the Black Sea, and in spite of the steamers of four regular steam companies to Trebizonde, the Caucasue is still the old land of fable and romance, wrapped up in mys. Itery almost as dark as when Json and Co. made their exploring trip, and brought back their tales of wonder from the shores of Coichis. Every now and then an antique-looking, weather-beaten craft, with. high rounded prow and higher poop, reminding one forcibly of Greek galleys, comnes down the Bo3phorus with swelaig sails and a strange-looking. crew, concealing its mysterious cargo as the Argonauts of old did their golden fleece. It drops its anchors at Topkhan6, and discharges a number of closely wrapped-up beings, accompanied by tall bandsome rnen, in tight-fitting dress coats and enormous fur caps, armed with sword and dagger. They come from the Caucasus, and bring black-eyed jewels for the harems of Stamboul. There is, indeed, an Imperial order forbidding their importation, but it is like the treaty of Paris ordering the neutraliza. tion of the Euxlne and Ignoring the blockade of the coast of Circassia. The jewels are for true believers, but the tales these strangers bring, wild as they are, are almost the only sources of information which reach us from the Caucasus. They tell us of wars and feuds, nc' so gigantic as those of Titans, but scarcely less bitter and more lasting. Everything is the same as of old, only the form has a little changed. The sea which wasnes the mountains of the Caucasus still breeds monBters as watchful as ever, and as pitiless -the Russian cruisers. The land monsters have changed into Cossacks, and the heroes into Circassian warriors. It is all as of old, half myth and half reality, and it is probably to keep up the charm of this that the Congress of Paris has avoided so anxiously to touch this land of romance in its discussions, and has left its position in greater uncertainty than ever. Avoiding myth as much as possible, I will try to pick out what I can find of reality, in order to give you some information on the Ruasian policy in the Caucasus. When the coast of Circassia was evacuatd by the Turks it was naturally expected that the Russians would immediately begin to reoccupy the lost ground, to restore the destroyed and neglected works, and to re-establish the Interrupted communications en the sea shore. To every one's astonishment this was much longer delayed, and when at last it took place it was done only partially, and it soon became apparent that the Russian policy in the Caucasus was going to be changed. Before the war the Russians had worked for years to establish a line of communication along the eastern shores of the Black Sea by erecting a string of forts from Anapa down to Chefkatil or fort St. Nicholas, and to keep it up by a succession of military posts, nothing daunted by the fearful loss of life from fever among the garrisons. It seems the Russian Government bad understood that the object for vwhich these sacrifices were made could never be thoroughly obtained aS long as close behind the forts there was an independent population whom neither fear nor kindness could reconcile to the presence of the stranger, and who never lost an opportunity to do all kinds of mischief to the convoys and smaller detachments. Instead of making, therefore, this useless military oordon, only three of the most importantpoints were militarily occupied,-namely, Anapa, SuchurmKaleh, and Redout-Kaleli. By degrees even this original plan seemis to have been altered, and in the first two places only a force was left sufficient to guard against a coup de main, and to keep up the Ciustom-house and police establishments, while only at Redout-Kaleh, which commands the Rion and the military road to Eutais,a considerable body of men was concentrated. According to the latest accounts this consists of between 3,000 and 4,000 men. But you must not imagine from these new arrangements that the Russians have given up their claims on the Circasslan coast. On the contrary, reassured by the silence of the Treaty of Par7s, they mhintaln their pretensions more energetically than ever, and they do this by a sirlte blockade, which sounds rather curiously in the neutralized Black Sea. The coasters from Trebizonde learnt this very soon to their owrn cost. For ages there has been a brisk trade carried on between the eastern and southern shores of the Black Sea, long before a Russian set his foot on the soil of the Caucasus. Salt is the chief article of this trade. Russia, which wants to make the Cireassiang dependent upon her for their provision of salt, considers the trade as contraband. The Circassians and Turks, who do not recognize the right of Russia to the coast, naturally look at it in a different light, and, haviDg heard of a Treaty of Paris and a neutralization of the Black Sea, and the consequent absence of cruisers, continued their trade after the Turks had retired, and numerous have been the fights between these coasters and the Russin cruisers, and not less numerous are the claims of Trebizonde merchants for vessels sunk. The fact is, there is only a vague distinction between regular trade and contraband, and both sides make, according to circumstances, the most of it; but there is likewise another cause for complications. The Russians insist that vessels should only land on the three points occupied by them, and never touch on any other place along the coast; they have issued a notification to that effect, against which, however, France, England, and Turkey have protested as an infraction of the treaty, which establishes the free navigation of the Black Sea. The matter is still pending. Besides this blockade, the Russians have succeeded in obtaining another method for asserting their sovereignty over the Circassian coast. They have announced that they would grant passports at one of the three points occupied by them on the coast to all Circassians weho wish to leave the country, but that they would not let any one pass without it. There was a custom to give Turkish passports to the Circassians, with which they used to go to and from Trebizonde. The Turkish Government promised not to grant any more such passports, thus recogniziDg indirectly the supremacy of the Russians over the Circassians. While such measures were adopted to exclude the Circassians from the sea, active military measures were taken to assert Russian supremacy in the interior. Four columns were directed last spring from the Kuban and Terek into the mountains, but according to all account without much result, for these expeditions have done only what others did before them,-burning down a kral here and there, and skirmishing everywhere. So little came, indeed, of these razzias that one would be rather inclined to believe that these demonstrations were made only to overawe and occupy the mountain tribes, in order to have free hands for a more urgent and easier object. This is the complete subjugation of the semi-independent chiefs in the South. ist is but justice to say that the lessons of the war have not been lost on the Russians. Among the rest, they have seen that the attachment of these semi-independent Princes to Russia is not very great, and that itwas, at any rate, not the fault of these latter if they had no opportunity to fight against the Czar. Their object is, therefore, now to take away from them this possibility, and to bring their territories under more Immediate controL The means for effecting this were found in the continuous disputes which are going on among the members of these princely families. Younger brothers and second sons have always been Russian Government pets-the Emperor educates them, gives them rank, and pensions, and has thus always anl opportunity to take up the cause of injured family members. The first to feel the effects of this policy was the widowed Princess Dadian, of Mingrelia, who figured with her young son at the coronation at Moscow. She was invited to spend an agreeable winter season at St. Petersburg, and her son will be cared for by his loving uncle, who figured as a Russian general against Omar Pasha's army during the late war in Mingrelia. Alas ! for the decay of chivalry, there was no one to defend the beautiful lady from exposing herself to the injuries of the cold northern climate, and she has gone. But there are not princesses always to remove, but sometimes men, more stubborn and fierce, and one of these attempts has lately ended in a tragedy. The semi-independent Prince of the Suanetes, to the north-east of Mingrelia, was likewise invited, but onlytoKutais, where he had an interview withPrince Bagration, the military comrmander of that place,who, after having invited him to dinner, informed him that after dinner he was to go to Tiflis. The Prince of the Suanetes, on his side, informed his Excellency the military commander that he had not the least desire to do so, at which he was politely told that he would be sent there. At this the Prince drew his sharp Circasslan sword and cut down the military commander, as well as the two guards who rushed in at his cries, and made his way to his house. A detachment of soldiers was sent to secure him, but this was only done after the Prince had cut down four of the aoldiers and had himself been mortally wounded by several bayonet thrusts. Prince Bagration Is dead, and the Prince of the Suanetes is not expected to live. Iord Stratford is making preparations to avail himself of the leave of absence which he has had for the last year and a half. He is expected to leave on Saturday next by the Austrian steamer. Lieutenant Hawes, of the Bengal army, who has beern ouit here in the interest of the Euiphrates Valley Telegraph line, is leaving to-day, which seerns to indicate that the projectors of this line have given up this scheme for the moment. TURKISH FINYANCE. (MOM OUR OWiN CORnRSPONDENT.) CONSTA.NTINOPLE, DEC. 5. Whoever doubts that " a change has come over the dream" of the Turkish people ought to come here now, and his doubts would soon vanish if he saw the interest with which the descendants of the fierce warriors of Bajazet and of Solyman the Magnificent follow the monetary crisis in Europe, trying to fathom the intricacies of the exchange, and sighing over the formidable rise in the discount of paper. Yes, they do see, indeed, that things have changed since the time when they could lose 224 galleys in the single battle of Lepanto, and replace them the next year by 240, and when the Grand Vizier Sokolli could give the proud answer to the doubting Capudan Pasha, that such were the power and wealth of the Ottoman Porte that it could, if it was ordered, get for this fleet anchors of silver, silk cordage, and sails of satin. Then finance was easy enough; a new province and a new tribute soon squared accounts with a large balance in hand; now they feel they are dependent on Europe in moneymnatters, and that, whatever thestress be, they must wait with their financial measuresuntil matters are better there. However difficult it may be for them to postpone such an urgent afiir, the delay has likewise its advantages. Every day throws a new light on the subject, which is very much required, for even in the beBt minds in Turkey there is only a small stock of financial knowledge, and that mostly of a desultory kind. The difficulties which the Government has encounteredhithertoin- all its schemes have undoubtedly contributed to sift the matter, and to make them adopt more and more reasonable views. Now and then, as is natural, there is a relapse, but after every such crisis there is always something gained in the art of distinguishing difficult from impracticable plans. Thus, for Instance, you know that lately the Turkish Government thought it had formed a panacea for its chronic financial indisposition by the consolidation of the floating debt; and there is no doubt that it would be a great advantage and saving to the Exchequer to have a certain regularity introduced in its parva, to know exactly their amount, to fix the sources of revenue from which the interest should be paid, and thus to start as it were afresh; but the question is, will they be able to inspire people with the necessary confidence in their promises-for who guaranteed that they would pay the interest regularly in gold, and that they would not come forward in a few years with a new consolidation? The better terms which they offered to the holders of the new coupons were just the very thing to frighten them. The Government debts are now the chief sources of revenue for the speculators of Galata and Stamboul, who make large profits on the continual fluctuation of thispaper. What elnO but illwill wasto be expected from these persons towards any measure calculated to curtat their profits? They would have had, indeed, no oDtion but to take the new coupons in exchange for the old ones, and, as the Government Intended to pay the full amount for paper now at a discount of 25 to 30 per cent., they would not have refused to profit by the transactionri but the cbange would rcarcelyhave taken place'when theywouldhave-and no doubt succesifully-endeavoured to reduce the new paper to the lamentable position of the old. The Government Leema to have understood this at last, and the project has assumed a new shape. They want to connect the consolidation with the establishment of the long talked of Bank, which is expected to interest itself in this consolidation. The project thus put forth sounds already more practicable, for without the help of a powerful commercial body, working with European capital and after European system, the Trkish Government will never be capable of doing battle againist the not less poverful clique of local bankers. All that is required for this is that the Government should not stretch its demands too far and not expect to get out of the difficulty without sacrfices. Up to this momentnothing is decided, nor wiU anything be attempted before a change takes place in the moneymarket in Europe. Some days ago two Croats, convicted of having murdered a Turkish woman, were executed. One of them was hung up near the lower bridge, the great artery of communication between Stamboul and Galata, and the other near the Adrianople gate, close to the place were the murder had been committed. As in many other things, the Turks have likewise, from extreme severity to criminals fallen into a blameable leniency towards them. There are numbers of men in the Arsenal who have committed several murders, which would have been punished with death anywhere else. Indeed, the curious thing is that regular highway robbers were until lately almost sure to go to the Arsenal. They were sent there from all parts of the empire. Now the Arsenal, or the Kassim Pasha's Prison, is certainly no very enviable place, but, as criminals have repeatedly escaped thence, it has not the deterring effect of capital punishment, and iutil lately the profession of brigand was a very flourishing one. It had assumed such proportions in the provinces that the mistaken notions of humanity had to be given up and executions resumed, in spite of the aversion of the Sultan to sign death warrants, In some of the provinces it was even found necessary to introduce a kind of martial law, and to confer on the Governor-General the power of life and death. Such was the case in Thessaly, and Lower Albania, Smyrna, and other places. In the capital, however, the system of over leniency is almost invariably the rule, which it would not be amiss to alter a little. There is now, however, some chance of this being done-at any rate as far as the Turks are concerned; for the place of Minister of Police, which has fallen vacant by the sudden death of Izzet Pasha, has been given to the Governor-General of Janina, Mehmed Pasha, to whose energy the suppression of brigandcage in Epirus and Thessaly is mainly due. Ie vill find his task rather more difficult; not that the population of Stamboul is very unruly,-on the contrary, there is perhaps no capital in which less crime is committed; but the so-caUed foreignersthat is, those under;foreign protection-are sure, as they are, of impunity. Mehmned has had several difficulties in this respect with divers consuls, but, in spite of the danger of recall to which he exposed himself, he did not give in; it may be therefore hoped that the climate of the Bosphorus will not be prejudicial to his energy, and that he will dare to oppose unreasonable pretensions, which is the only way of putting the European and Christian part of the Turkish capital into something like order. The month of November has been particularly boisterous in the Black Sea and the Bosphorus; it reminded one quite of ihe famous Crimean winter with its squalls, rains, and sleet. This has impeded the navigation in the mouth of the Danube considerably, for even the steamers had sometimes to wait for several days at Sulina before they could go out. ITALY. (FROM OUR. OW.N CORBESPONDENT.) TURIN, DEC. 1L There was a slight attempt at disturbance yesterday at Genoa, which, however, scarcely amounted to iuore than a demonstration, promptly checked without the employment of force. The 10th December is the anniversary of the expulsion of the Au'trians from Genoa in 1746, and since 1848 it has been thecustom to observe the day. Mlass is performed at the Church of the Origena, a short distance from the town, and is attended by a deputation from the municipality, and generally by a great crowcd of persons. Yesterday, on the return from this ceremony, a mob, estimated at 1,000 strong, took the direction of the street in which stands the house of the Austrian Consul-General, and it became known that the intention was to break his windows. The mob, however, seems not to have been of the most valiant and enterprising, for on reaching the street, although cries of "Avanti ! avanrti " were uttered, nobodydid gzo forward,norwerestones thrown, and on the appearance of the authorities, sUpported by a few companies of infantry, the timid rioters tranquilly dispersed. As this Insignificant affairmay possibly be magnified by the Austrian papers into an alarming attempt of the democrats, and cited as a proof of the disturbed state of Piedmont, itisas well thatyou should be madecqnuainted with the prevailing conviction here, that had this handful of rabble gone the length proposed, and demolished the window-glass of the Austrian, no one woould have been better pleased than that functionary himself. It is even thought that if they bad gone a little further, knocked in a door or two. andpilaged the winecellar, before the errival of the military put a stop to their violence, he wduld not have felt very seriously annoyed. It wouldh'ave given a fine opportunity for a flaming report' to Vienna, showing that anarchy reigned at Genoa, that there was no security for person or property, and that the nauch-vaunted liberties of l?iednont had degenerated into-intolerable license. To prove this Austria would doubtless gladly make many aoarifices, aud willingly witness the demolition of half-adozen consuls' houses; perhaps even behold without extreme regret the extermination of the consuls themselves. Piedmont, orderly sand prosperous, is an eyesore and a heartburning to the Austrian, who feels that such an example of the good results of free institutions will do more than swords and rifles to bring about the emancipation of Italy. I believe it a most mistaken idea, entertained by not a few persons, that Piedmont is one day to form the headquarters and gathering-point of an armed crusade for Italian independence. Her mission is a different one. By moderation and order, and by the increawe of her material prosperity, she should seek to prove to the Princes of other States that Italians are not unworthy of self-government, and that they will lose nothing of their Royal dignity and prestige, but gain immensely in the goodwill of their subjectsa,by following in the footsteps of the House of Savoy. I need not say that the mere idea of such reulnts ensuing from the spectacleof a well-governed and flourishing constitutional kingdom mutst be gall and bitterness to Austria. She would fain be able to hold up Piedmont as a frightful example of the horrors of democracy; and there are strong reasons for believing that she does not spare pains to provoke such appearances of disorder as might seem to justify her in ao doing. She has active agents at work, and it is well known that considerable sums of money have lately been sent from Lombardy into the Sardinian States. And, although it might be impossible to prove it, circumstances have been brought to my knowledgo counected with yesterday's disturbance at Genoa which leave room for scarcely a doubt that Austrian gold was employed to get it up. The fiasco was lamentable, the money literally throwvn away; the only persons benefited being the recipients of the Imprial bounty and the keepers of the wine-shops, in wrhich these worthies doubtless telted their ill-earned ducats. Unless cash be more abundant in the Austrian Treasury thani is generally supposed, it will be wel next time to choose more efficient agents, and to get up the democratic burlesque in a more earnest style. Perhaps yesterday's performance is to be considered as only a rehearsaL The arrest of the Marquis Campana, Director of the Mont de Plet6 at Rome, on a charge of making away with the funds intrasted to his care, s the subject of much conversation here. The Marquis, who is married to an English lady, is well known for his profuse expenditure, also as an archEeologist,and for his scientific and artistic tastes. A letter from Rome estimates the deficit at nearly. 4,000,000f. The general opinion is not favourable to the Marquis, who does not seem to have enjoyed a high reputation previously to his imprisonment on the prwent charge. Ile finds, however, some defenders. A long letter from Rome, in the mdipendcnte of last evening, endeavours to cast doubts on the justice of his imprisonment, and even to give a sort of political colouring to the affair, saying that the Pope and Cardinal Antonelli. have never pardoned hima for having continued to serve under the provisional Government andthe Republic. The letter gives some details of the princely ityle in which the Marquis lived. I extract a paiigraph or two, as curious, but without in any degroe guaranteeing the correctness of the statements they contain H He posseses, In the street of the Corso, an elegant palse, where he has got togetber a gallery of the most magnificent pictures, and in his villa near the Latoran he established a museum, inferior perhaps only to that of the Vatican, so rich is it in statues, bas-reliefs, inecriptions, Etruscan vases, and other most preoious things. He has, moreover, a rare collection of stones, minerals, coins, &a. He owns ladS, palaes, and country houses in great number, both in Bome and abroad. He has established, at immense expense, a manufactory of marbles, or rather of a substance similar to marble, wilth which are made statues, columrns, cups, and pavement of all kinds. In this manufactoxy nearly 300 workmen -were employed. Finally, he maintained at his expense a, house of educatiorn for poor children. His fortune was increased by his marriage with an extremely rich English lady, Miss Rowoles (a3c), daughter of the luay who received in her carrlage the fugitive from the fortress of Ham, and conveyed him into Belgium. Napoleon did not forget the service; he did not lose sight of the family, but protected it greatly, and the Marchioncss Camnpana bec am Lady of Honour to the Empress of the French. It is ssid that she is preparing to set out for France to state her griefs to the Em. peror and ask his protection for her hnsband. TheoMarquis is Chevalier of numerous orders, and Chamberlain of many Courts." The same letter, which has all the appearance of being written by a person partial to the Marquis, says, that when the news of his arrest spread through Rome there was great popular agitation, and it was feared that some disturbance would be made by the many hundred workmen who earned their bread in his manufactories, and that it was thought necessary to keep both the French and the Pontifical troops in their barracks on that and the following day. These statements may possibly be true, but they have an air of exaggeration, and they are unconfirmed by private letters received here from Rome, which indeed put the whole affair in a light less favourable to the Marquis than does the correspondence above quoted. We learn nothing else of Interest from Rome, except that crime is there very rife, robberies being of daily occurrence both in town and country. The results of the Piedmontese elections continued to occupy the public mind; and much vexation was felt at the number of the clerical party who had obtained seats.
INDIA74 COLONIZATION ANfD THE BOMAN EMPIrR. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As my book on the colonization of India has been brought forward in the oontroversy in your columns between Professor Newman and Mr. Merivale, I beg your permission to state that I have made no proposition for assimUating the Government of India to that of the Roman empire, nor made any reference to it. I do not take part in the discus. sion between the learned gentlemen further than to say that I fully understand Professor Newman's reference to the Roman system, and do not see that the exoeptional administration of Egypt in any way impairs his argument. I have entered into no political views at all, nor expressed ny opinion on questions of citizenship or Government. T have contented myself with offering the first sytematic account of the infant growth of English colonization In the hil regions of India under the auspices of the Company's Government. I have shown that iu the last 30 years numerous settlements have been made successfully in the hbiW country, and I ask only that the course pursued by the Government may be persevered in, and followed out to its legitimate results. I believe that I have vindicated in this respect the conduct of the Government of India and the policy they are pursung, and that I am correct in stating, to the best of my intormation, that the European hlll garrions, not only in the Punjab, bat likewise in the eastern provinces, will be largely in creased, and that every encou:agement will continue to be afforded by liberal grauts and leases of land for tea plantations, for agriculture, for mJining, for town sites, and for habltations. By recent ad. vices I learn that cantonments are being prepared at Dar. jEeeng, in the Bengal governmnent, for further European forces, and that various measures conneoted with colonization in that region and in Assan are being refived.

LONDON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1857. It wil gratify all but a very small section of the community to know that the exaction of proper amends for the Canton outrage is likely to be no longer delayed. The course of aetion which was recommended by our correspondent some months since, no donbt in accordance with the prevailing opinion of the English on the spot, is about to be adopted. At the depa ture of the last mail it had been fully determined to seize and hold Canton until reparation had been made for the excesses of Yzn and his satellites. It certainly shows the spirit and resources of this country that in such an hour of national trial, with a vast army in revolt, and our Generals surrounded by tens of thousands of enemies in one region of Asia, we are yet coolly preparing to attack the moct populous seaport of the Chinese Empire, and, if necessary, to carry the warfare up to the capital of its secluded and mysterious Sovereign. Though it is wonderful that the country should at such a time be able to spare troops at all, yet, as might be expected, the force which is to avenge our insults is far from large. Even the full complement of sailors is not to be had. The Shannon, which, with two or three other vessels, has furnished forth Captain PzEis Naval Brigade, was despatched from home for China service, and diverted under the pressure of the sternest necessity. Several steamers have also been sent to Calcutta, thus still further dirinishing the force available for any warlike achievement. But, on the other hand, some reinforcements had arrived, and our countrymen, who do not seem to count odds, are disposed to make the best of what they have, and to commence operations at once. As a contrast to the doings of the sailing transports, we may call attention to the passage made by the Imperador, an auxiliary screw steamer, which arrived in 70 days from England, bringing 500 Marines. The Imperador's passage to Singapore was only 61 days. The Imperadriz, a sister ahip, was expected a few days later. This timely succour seems to have encouraged the authorities to decide on immediate action. Within a short time it was hoped that the General in command wonld have from 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers and marines, and these, with the bluejackets, might be trusted to attack even Canton with its million of mob. General Asl]BUMMAUq had left for India, and was succeeded by General SRuA:zNzzE, who had become highly popular, and was looked upon as a commander of skill, activity, and daring. The gunboats were arriving daily, and, when united, were likely to play an important part in the series of operations. The hope that something would at last be done had cheered men of every rank; all were anxious for the signal to ascend the Canton River. The authorities had come to the same conclusion as the whoIe body of military and civilians-namely, that it was better to treat the dispute as a local affair, and to deal with Canton as if its ruler had acted independently of the Imperial power. So the expedition of Lord Er.GIN to the Peiho, which had been delayed by his journey to Calcutta, was definitively abandoned, and diplomacy had determined to wait until the sword had done its work. This decision certainly seems most wise. We have before dwelt upon the singular relations in which we find ourselves with respect to the Chinese people. The Celestials as a nation will not quarrel with us. Canton is blockaded, but at all the other ports business goes on as briskly as ever. Shanghai and Ningpo are, in fact, thriving on the perversity of the southeri2 rabble. Englishmen are admitted freely into the country, penetrate into districts never before visited, ascend the Imperial Canal, gaze on the quays and boats, the temples and villas, and ali the other wonders of this isolated civilization. They are received everywhere with a kind of merry curiosity, and even allowed by Mandarins and Custom-house officers to pas without payment of the usual dues. It would certainly be as foolish as cruel to use any harsh measures against this population merely on the theoretical grounds that the central Government is responsible for the acts of its officials, and that the people must expiate the misdeeds of its Government. As it is, then, out of the question to do more than occupy as harmlessly as possible one or two points towards the North, and as it is moreover certain that such an occupation would be of no effect in bringing the Court to reason, it follows that we must strike the blow where it has been deserved, and where it is likely to produce the results we desire. It is the opinion of those on the spot that the seizure and occupation of Canton wil obtain the reparation which the dignity of the country requires, and also lead to a more permanent intercourse between China and the civilized world. We must, therefore, wish every success to the bold measure on which the English commanders have decided. Indeed, the failure of a diplomatic mission to the North might be predicted without much presumption. The very fact that we, who had alone been insulted and injured, had called upon other nations to join us in our remonstrances would be likely to encourage the Court of Pekin to obstinacy. N'ot only do we seem to show our weakness, but we who have a cause of war associate with ourselves other nations who have not a cause of war, and who therefore cannot legitimately carry matters to extremity. The natural conclusion that Chinese cunning must draw is, that we sha1l be hindered from any active proceedings by these entangling alliances. It is as well to show that this is not the case, and that England, by invit. ing other nations to share in the advantages which will follow tho opening of China, does not in any way cede her liberty of independent action. The plan of operations seems to be well considered. It embraces first the capture and occupation of Canton. We need not form any conjecures regarding the capacity of the English force for such an enterprise; our numbers are small, but a smaller force has within the last few weeks achieved still greater exploits. The demands of the British Government ought certainly not to be merely nugatory. To take lasting possesion of some advantageous spot near the great ports of the empire, and commanding its main arteries, the Yangtoe-Kiang, the Hoang-ho, and the Imperial Canal, ought to be the first thought of the authorities. It is pretty wel known that Chusan was abandoned at the close of the last war chiefly through the influence of the Canton merchants, who wished to place the seat of British power in their own neighbourhood. But Shanghai and Ningpo have taken the lead in spite of the disfavour of our Government, and it is now time to recognize that their neighbourhood is the real field for commercial activity and political influence. A free communication with the Court of Pekin might also be insisted upon, for it is impossible that the country which governs India, and into whose Malay and Australian possessions the Chinese flock by thousands, can consent to ba unrepresented in the councils of the EMPEROR. It is probable that the tale of the Indian victories, which has, ere this, penetrated into the depths of Asia, will, if followed by vigorous proceedings at Canton, induce the Chinese Court to accede to Lord ELG&S demands. But if it should still be obstinate there seems reason to believe that the seizure of the rice junks which supply Pekin will prove to the central authoritv the necessity of yielding. The description in the letter we print to-day shows with what facility our gunboats can cut off the supplies of the capitaL Owing to the southern portion of the Imperial Canal being in the power of the rebels, the grain is sent from the mouth of the Yang-tse by sea to the gulf of Pecheli. This voyage can, of course, be hindered by the British fleet, and probably such an opportunity of bringing the Court to reason will not be neglected. Such is the latest phase of the Chinese question. Those who know the character of the people and its Government have been long convinced that only energy and judgment on our part are necessary to bring the empire into close relations with our own and with other civilized nations. China is in a state of transition. Change has come after longo enduring imamobility i a revolu. tionary spirit after ages of obedience; a strange enterprLe and activity after a whole national history of stagnation. England can better than any other country direct these new energies in the right patb. We have armies and fleets at hand, an immense trade, the most enterprising travellers and missionarlea, and a national character which obtains for our people great ascendancy over halfcivilized races. Large numbers of Chinese also speak the English language, rudely, it is true, but still well enough to make largely extended relations possible. It is to be trusted, therefore, both for our own sakes and for the sake of a people who must be so largely dependent upon us, thaS Lord ELGN and the commanders with whom he is awsociated will act with courage, decision, and independence. This country is not inclined to forego the position in Asia which has been won by the heroism of a hundred years.
On some subjects everybody has had his experience. One has bad more, another less, but everybody has had some. At the mention of the word chance, for instauce, what a quantity of experience could almost everybody recall-what good chances, what ill chances! What a malignity there is in chance ! Hlow it can bring about just the most awkward rencontre possible, just at the very worst time ! How it cau just forestall a piece of success, and just knock up a capital plan, just take your friend or coadjutor off when you wanted him, just sprain your ancle, or give you a bad cold when you wanted to run off on your holyday, just give the only bad day in the middle of an uninterrupted three montha' sunshind for the Cheddar Cliffs or Dovedale-the only bad week in a whole summer for Loch Liomond, and Loch Katrine, and Loch Awe, and Loch Fyne-in short, do what of all things in the world is most amnoying to you! You may talk of maUce prepense, but what is there in design that can equal the malignity of chance People's tempers give way under its persecution, and excellent Christians become pro tempore Mnuichleans, and bitterly resent the wrongs which they suffer from this evil deity. On the other hand, how fair is chance when it smiles upon you ! There is a pleasure in a real piece of good luck which no successful forethought, no deep-laid i scheme's fulfilment, can give. You feel yourself a favourite of Heaven, and that you have the higher powers of the universe with you. The ancients talked of " Divine chance;" SYLLA would not be called wise, but fortunate, and even the great Duke has let out a secret modified worahip, which, in the recesses of his own mind, he paid to this divinity, in hi motto. We believe that nine people out of ten ha-ve more real pleasure in simple good luck than in any successful planning; it touches a chord in their breasts; it comes home to them; it is a pura unsullied source of exhilaration, which sparkle3 like spring water from the crystal fount. Gambling is, indeed, only an absurd, stupid aim at these clear, transparent honours of chance-an attempt to get possession of them by main force, as if the genuine article, good luck, even on the turf or at Baden-Baden, could be won by design, though something which calls itself by that name sometimes may be. Every gambler would be Air. Soand-So, " the fortunate." He does not desire so much the thousandsl themselves as the privilege of winning them; he pursues Good Fortune, and tries to catch her; he makes a deliberate purpose and trade of the pursuit, and aims syste- matically at the blimsful sensations of good luck-. I a monstrous perversity, indeed, in morals, and a simple blunder in logic,-for what can be a greater incongruity than designed luck ?-but showing at the same time what charms this privilege and gift has for human nature. We need not say that war is a remarkable and pre-eminent field of chance, and that it exhibits the operation of chance with regard to what is much more important than property and professional distinction,-viz., life. Indeed, we should not be far wrong in saying that a great deal of the attraction and insatiable excitement of war is intimately connected with the simple pleasure of chance. That which with men in general goes for nothing, and is taken for granted as the necessary fulerum for success and advantage of all kindslife and safety-these become to the soldier, who may lose them, a ground of positive pleasure and self-congratulation. It may be quite true what is said about an army after a battle, even a victorious one-that its depression and low spirits commence just when danger is at last over, and that just when you would expect to find soldiers exulting in the sensations of victory you would see them almost slinking off to their tents, and beginning to droop, and talk low with each other, as if they had suffered a defeat rather than gained a triumph. This may be the case, but the reaction of nature after excitement, and the feeling of sympathy and regret for those who have been taken away, are still compatible with self-gratulation for danger escaped, for safety and preservation. This consciousness must, according to the very constitution of our nature, be a source of pleasure; a man may be ever so brave a soldier, but he would not be a man if he had not such feelings. War, then, brings with it to the survivors a constant sense of good luck, and this is doubtless a captivating element in it. We may congratulate our Indian Commanderin-Chief upon his first taste of this agreeable sensation in the present campaign. The escape is, indeed, picturesque from the very commonness of its features; it gives a vivid insight into the whole field of Indian war, and brings home to us the realities of the scene. Sir COLIN CAMIPsELT, who, it appears, has persisted, in spite of all the remonstrances of his friends, in travelling like a courier, without an escort, and vwith only the attendance of his Staff, comes suddenly, on the road between Cawnpore and Lucknow, across some companies of mutineers-infantry and cavalry-probably belonging to the 32d Native Infantry and 12th Light Cavalry. These companies are leisurely crossing the road, the infantry sitting on elephants, and thehorsemen protecting each fank. There does not appear, from the description of this sudden rencontre, the slightest doubt that if the mutineer cavalry had at once attacked Sir COLIN CAMIBEJL's carriage he and all his Staff must have fallen victims to so overpowering a force. The two parties are so near each other that some of Sir COLIN'S Staff urge the desperate expedient of immediate attack, as the only apparent way of getting out of the difficulty, and on the principle that English swords may be able to cut their way through any numbers. But, notwithstanding the closeness of the approach, some " Divime " chance" seems to have averted the eyes of the foe, and Sir COLIN simply turns his horses' heads and retreats ten miles, till he meets a European bullock train. "This daring push," says our correspondent, " excites some admiration, but "there was more than one life hanging on the "Commander-in-Chiefs safety. Had the cavalry "charged on the carriages and sabred the inmates "Lucknow might have faUen, for we should not " have heard of the fate of the party for week7" HIere is an insight into the chances of war. At the very outset of a campaign here is almost a miraculous eecape of our Commander-in-Chief, not on a field of battle, where danger, even to a General, is in a certain degree expected, but simply on a journey to the main seat of war. Sir CoLiN, it in true, does not diminish the hazard by any great caution; he is not a General of the Spanish Field-Marshal type, marching at convenient intervals, and arriving at the field of battle in a coach and aix. Yet, how few of those who read the account of this hairbreadth escape in our correspondent's letter will really anticipate ominously for Sir COLU CAsuPs,z in consequence, or indulge in gloomy prospects ! The effect will be the very contrary, and one good chance will appear a pledge for another. People are never so much surprised as when they hear of misfortune in war to one who has had a long career of escape, and, whether this feeling is founded on logic or imagination, it is so agreeable an one that we shall on the present occasion indulge it, and trust, till we hear to the contrary, that our Commander-in-Chief bears a charmed life.
Among the scraps of intelligence in which the movements of distinguished persons are recorded we find the following announcement :-" Edin"burgh, Monday. Court of Bankruptcy, this "day. JorN EDwARD STEPHENS was not forth"coming this morning. The Sheriff has granted "a warrant for his apprehension. It is rumoured "that he left for London on Sunday night." At the moment we write this ilustrious citizen may be among us again in this southern division of tbe empire; but again Mr. JonuN EDwARD STEPHENS may, as is implied by the terms of his letter "P. P. C.," change his mind and resolve to bear the brunt of the examination. We will not, therefore, as yet treat him as a runaway witness, or remark upon the disclosures which he has made before the ScotchCourt as to the transactions of the Eastern Bank. It will be time enough to do this when the presumption of his disappearance amounts to certainty; but we may at least be permitted to call attention to the somewhat remarkable facts of his autobiography, as they have been enunciated by himself at Edinburgh within the last few days. Mr. JoEN EDWARD STEPRENs, then, began life as an assistantsurgeon in a cavalry regiment, a most respectable and honourable pursuit, to which it is a pity for the sake of others that he did not adhere. In this capacity he served in India and elsewhere, until, finding that he could not In all probability arrive at wealth and distinction very speedily in the career which he had chosen, -e resolved to abandon so barren a profession and play the game of life in a grand way. He returned to England, and in conjunction with Colonel WAuGH, of Branksea Island,^managed that remarkable institution which has been somewhat unfavourably known to the public as the Eastern Corporation, or the Eastern Bank. The ostensible object of this noble foundation was to provide, as it were, a harbour of refuge for Nabobs who were suffering from a plethora of rupees. So great was the benevolence of these strong but tender men that they resolved not to exclude the poor wornout Indian officer with his little pension, nor the Indian widow with her stiU smaller mite from the comprehensive action of the Eastern Bank. The concern appears to have been carried on upon the simplest plan. Prospectuses were published in India and in England, announcing, in that flowing phraseology which seems to characterize operations of this nature, that if Anglo-Indian capitalists, high and low, and more especiaUy those of the military profession, would intrust their savings to the careful guardianship of the Directors of the Eastern Bank, they would receive iaterest at a rate which would have even made S=or; forget for a while the elopement of his daughter JESsIcA. There was really nothing in particular to attract confidence in this institution or in the character and position of those who had set it on foot. What could a half-pay Dragoon and a retired assistant-surgeon be supposed to know about the principles of banking ? So strange, however, is the credulity of human nature in such matters that not only women, who may, perhaps, be acquitted on the ground of their inexperience, and of their want of familiarity with blusiness transactions, but men who had spent their lives in gathering together a little competence, hastened to throw it into this burning, fiery furnace, as though they derived some incomprehensible kind of pleasure from risking in a quarter of an hour the fruits of a life's toil under the hot Indian sun. The concern thrived, the till was gorged, and for a while the shareholders and creditors were fed out of their own contributions and their own deposits. The system is sinple as simplicity itself, and needs no further explanation. Meanwhile the contributions and deposits were drawn out mainly by Colonel WAUGII, who is now recruiting his shattered health in the kingdom of Spain. Mr. JonN EDWAD STrxrENs, however, did not disdain to follow in the steps of his principal. In conjunction with him he carried on the trade of "clay and brick sellers," the ostensible material for their trade being excavated from the soil of the Island of Branksea, but the actual material being drawn from the coffers of the Eastern Bank. Not satisfied with this venture YMr. JOH1N EDWARD STEPHEnxS turned his attention to watchmaking, and the funds for carrying on this trade were again advanced from the Eastern Bank. As banker, as brickmaker, as watchmaker one would have supposed that Mr. STFPHE-NS would have had enough on his hands, even giving him every credit for being a person of active mind and energetic habits. Mr. STrPHFZNS was of a very different opinion. He had become fired with the noble ambition of meeting the ERARDS and BRoADwoons and great pianoforte-makers upon their own ground, and accordingly the assistant-surgeon superadded to his other pursuits that of a pianoforte-maker. Another slight squeeze atjthe generous udder of that great milch-cow, the Eastern BauL-, and the thing was done. The story sounds like a bad joke, but we find that Mr. STEPHENS, even so, found time hanging heavily upon his hands, and sighed for other avocations aud other trades. He next turned wharfinger; but it must not be supposed that the commencement of a new pursuit implied any dereliction of his old duties with this Encyclopa dic man; to £scouLArius only was he unfaithful. Again the Bank came to his aid. Thus Mr. STBPHENs, the ci-devant assistant-surgeon, was now bauker, watchmaker, pianoforte-maker, clay and brick seller, and wharfinger; but even this was not enough. There were some little spare moments of time yet which could be usefully applied, and accordingly Mr. STEPHENS would become an upholsterer. Advances were again obtained from the same Chancellor of the Exchequer, and an upholsterer Mr. STEPHnENs became. In none of these multifarious pursuits, however, strange to say, did he succeed, although he might almost consider that he had British India at his back. The watches would not go, the pianos were out of tune, the wharves were empty, the upholstery was not in request, the clay stuck on hand, and, last and most terrible blow of all, the Bank tiU began to present the appearance of a vacuum. At last it became necessary to have a slight interview with the creJitors of the BanL-, but upon that interview and its results we will not expatiate as yet, as the affair may be considered as before the Court until Mr. STEPHENs has finally declined any further conversation with the Scotch tribunals. From the terms of his letter to the trustee, an abstract of which reached ua by telegraph from Edinburgh last night, it does not appear that he has actuaUy made up his mind not to appear again before the Court. We should, however, as at pre- Bent disposed, be inclined to augur unfavourably of the Scotch Sheriff's chances of further intercourse with Mr. SrarrHzNs, save, indeed, upon the contingency of a gentle but earnest compulion. It is not a little remarkable that a man who has so recently been found competent to carry on so many trades should so soon break down at the trade of a witness. Mr. STEPHENS complains that he has been so harassed with questions that his health is giving way. Colonel WkuGH's health, too, has given way, and the public will surely sympathize with tl:s interesting pair of invalids. Mr. STEPmENS adds, with great regret, that on reconsidering his answers he has been led to make unfounded statements to his own prejudlce,Po eager has he been to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; so chary of everybody's reputation save his own. He has not had time to reflect uporn the circumstances of the Bank with such attention as will enable him to give proper answers to all the teazing, vexatious questions, which ingenious Scotchmen can put to him. Colonel WAuGH aud Mr. STEPUMNS, Mr. STEPiENS doubts not, will come out of the trial a little whiter than lambs when they have time and opportunity to place their conduct in a proper light before the public; or, at least, they will be able, as the alternative, to show that all their proceedings were sanctioned by the other Directors -a conclusion which will no doubt prove highly satisfactory to the shareholders and depositors.

The steamship Fulton landed advices at Cape Race on the afternoon of the 27th, which were pab. lished in New York on the 30th of November. The Kangaroo arrived at New York on the 1st inst. The weather having become milder navigation ws being resumed on the canals. Mr. Tie-nan had been elected Mayor of New York by a majority over Mr. Wood. Captain Davis, of the United States' Navy, who was despatched to report uponCommodoreMervines report as to the guano said to exist on New Nantucket Island, Pacific, had confirmed that officeres statement of its worthlesnes. The steamship Northern Light had arrived at New York with the Californian mails anid $2,118,652 78c. on frelht, of which $1,744,672 78c. was for NewY ork, andthe rest for New Orleans and Elavannah. The receipt at San Franclsco of the account of the financial distress at New york aud elsewhere caused considerable excitement, which was augmented by the information that draughtx forwarded to New York on the -th of September by Sather and Church had been protested. Next day quite a rush Was made by depositors, the princlpal run being upon Sather and Church. Attachment. were issued against this house, and the doors were closed by the sheriff at about half-past 9 o'clock. Early in the day a run was made upon the banks of Wells, Fargo, and Co., Tallant and Wllde, Fretz and Ralston, B. Davidson, and Parrott and Co., but, as all demands were promptly paid, the excitement soon ceased, and by 12 o'clock the panic was at an end. During the day attachments were sued out against the well-known shipping and commision house of Moore and Folger, hide-dealers, to the amount of $35,000. Mr. W. S. Tuckerman, formerly treasurer of the Eastern Railroad at Boston, had been arrested on a charge of stealing mailbags. The New York' Courier and Bquirer estimates the total vaiue of shipping lost in November at $820,000. The United States' steamship Fulton was in the Boca del Torres, which flows in the Caribbean Sea, watching for General Walker and the Filibusters. It was reported at the Sandwich Islands that the Russian Government had issued orders to prevent American whalers from fishing in Russian waters.

From Havannah we have advices to the 25th nit The stock of sugars on hand is reported at 142,000 boxes. Prices had declined, but without any regularity in figures. Exchange on London, 101 to 11 per cent. premium. In freights there was no demand on large vessels. Those carrying from 600 to 2,000 boxes for Europe had been taken up at from 21. 5s. to 21. 15s. The New York Courier and Enquirer of the 1st says- " The large shipment of specie anticipated for the current week and the unsettled condition of banking affairs on both sides of the Atlantic serve to keep our market unsteady. The rates for foreign excha3ge, in view of the obvious demand in England and France for rpecie in liquidation of balanoes, are becoming more firm. The banks show a slight curtailment of loans compared with the previous week's report; and the current rates for business paper are yet exorbitant. Capital is for the moment abundant, where the basis for loans is ample ; but money lenders are more inclined to loan upon stocks with a Miberal margin than upon business paper. The ordinary margin for bankers' bils on England rarely varies A per cent. between the extremes, but of late there is a difference of fully 2 per cent. ; while some parties are inclined to draw at -i, others decline at anything under 9l, which is the specie par. We annex the current rates on London-viz., 60 days' sight, I06A to 19i.; short sight, III to 1114. "While the Bank statement shovss an increase in gold for the week, there is a prospect that the foreign demand will absorb the receipts of the ooming month from Californa.

Although Mr. Higgins has abandoned the field, the Roman Catholic party are not, it seems, inclined to permit Lord John Browne to have a quiet walk over the course. 3Ir. Valentine O'Connor Blake, of Tower-hill-an especial favourite of the extreme Liberals,-is the gentleman who, it is mentioned, is to stand in the gap created by the untoward, but ,perhaps judicious, retirement of Colonel Eiggins. Nevertheless, parties conversant with Mayo politics express strong doubts as to the probability of Mr. 1Blake fulfilling his promise, and the belief still is that Lord John Browne will meet with no real Rppoaitlon from any quarter. THE THOMOND ESrATEs. An idea of the competition that still rules in the land market may be learnt from the plain fact that the highest priced lot of the Thomond estates realized 40 years' purchase, and that the entire estates averaged 25 years' purchase, on the Ordnance valuxation. It is stated that the tenants in most instances bought their own interests, and thus became owners in fee. THE IRLSZH BA?S. The Dublin trade reports speak in highly laudatory terms of the conduct of the Bank .,of Ireland during the continuance of the commercial crisis. A spirit of judicious liberality on the part of the B3ank and its branches helped to avert many of the difficulties that beset the mercantile community here. The dividend declared by the Ribernian Bank is at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, free of income-tax, after the payment of 'which, and setting aside 6,0001. for bad and doubtful debts, there remains a sum of 5,7901. to be added to the " rest," or undivided profits. The net profits of the year 1850 were 23,9331., out of which the bank declared the annual dividend of 6 per cent., together with a bonus of 3 per cent. The net profits this year are put down at 26,7901., or nearly 3,0001. in excess of last year, but no bonus is declared.

BELANCHOLY DE/TH.-CARILISLE, Saturday, 11 -a.m.-Pablic feeling was much excited in thiq city this morning by the circumstances attending the death of a man nanied John Pattinwon. A short time ago the affairs of the unfortunate man, who was in business here as a brazier and Mtinsruith, becamne much embarruased. Se was sued In the County Court for a debt, and process was issued against him. He found himself unable to comply with the order. A warrant was issued for his apprehension, and on Satur-day ho was taken by Alexander Bremner, County Court officer, while attending to his business at a stall in the market-place. The poor feloow appeared much affected at his position, and requested that he might be taken to the high Bailiff's office for the purpose of having an interview with his (deceased's) father in order to come to some arral,gement with bis creditors. The father was sent for, and a%tended, no arrangement was come to, and the deceased said that there wee nothing for him but to go to gaol, requesting Mr. Browne (high bailiff) to convey him there as privately as possible. Mr. Browne, in compliance with the request, and accompanied by Bremner, proceeded towards the gaol by way of Paternoster-row and on to the Westwalls (a very secluded part of the oity). Just as thoy entered the West-walls the deceaed made a rush, and, escaping from Mr. Browne and Bremner, ran down the street followed by the officers. He passed down Devonshire-walk, elosely foLlowed by Bramner, who was fast gaining upon him, as he approached a gate at the bottom of the street lead. ing on to the Castle Sauceries, vrhich is a large field extending down to the sbore of the river Eden. Deceased laid his .hands on the gate and cleared it at a bound, by which he gained upon his purnuer. He afterwards took off his clogs, :and ran apparently with greater freedom towards the river -Caldewv,whtch he crossed, Bremner a little bebind. He held on tUIl he came to the Eden, at a point below EUerly Scaurs.

A man on the opposite bank shouted to the deceased, and gave him some direc. tions how to proceed; but he appeared to pay no attention -to them.

THE UNITED STATE. (FBROM OU OWN CORRSPONDrT.) -NEW YORK, DEC. L The busineus of the put week, commercial and financial, has been les than usual; two holydays, Thanksgiving-day, and the celebration of the anniversary of the surrender of New York, having interrupted or totaliy suspended it. The chronicle of the four days during which the laut news from England has exhausted its effect shows that in the business done there is little or no change. The state of the money-markets of Europe has repressed the idea of a speedy resumption of cash payments, which was beginning to be entertained. The prospect of that resumption is now very indefinite; and, practically, the neceesity of it is very little felt,-the banks pay out specie very freely as a matter of private and personal accommodation, though it cannot be demanded as a legal right. The accumulation of specie in their coffers continues; the amount in the banks of the city yesterday was $24,303,145, which does not include the quantity received by the Californian steamer on the 28th. The movements of the week show a decrease in loans, a decrease in discounts, a large increase in the stock of specie, and a slight increase also in the circulation, indicating that the demand for money is not active, that the banks are stiU cautious, and scrutinize all paper carefully, and that trade, enterprise, and what is called speculation generally, have not yet revived. Here money is abundant, but the time is so thoroughly out of joint that there is little employment for it; and though doubtless many are quite prepared to borrow, credit Is so sunk that their applications are not anuswered by those who have the power to lend. Men are not yet sufficiently assured of the state of Europe to move freely, and wait the course of time and events with some anxiety, but no action. Many think this inactivity neceisary to our recovery; our business was too rapid, with too much of it, to be healthy; sleep and a little gentle perspiration show the turn. ing point of a fever. The bank statement of the past week, compared I with that of the week previous, gives the following results:- Decrease in los and discounts . $412,302 Increase in specie ... ... . ... 1,135,365 Increase In circulatio . ... ... 237,366 Increase in deposits actuAl ... ... 1,923,057 The amount of specie in the banks is exactly | double tho sum they exhibited in the same week oft last year, when it was a little above $12,000,000. The only effect of the large amount now deposited is to stimulate the stock-market slightly. It is not improbable the Federal GCovernment will shortly require a loan, the reduction of imports beginning to tell unfavourably on the Treasury; and there is a prospect of increased expenditure for the Mormon var, every movemnent of which is attended with enormous expense. The steamer Northern Light, with the Californian mail to the 5th of November, arrived here on the 29tb. She shipped specie at San Francieco to the amount of $2,118,652, of which $1,744,672 are consigned to New York houses, the remainder for Havannah and New Orleans. This amount will in a few days considerably increase the specie of the city banks, and probably add to the shipment for England by the Niagara, which leaves Boston tomorrow. At San Francisco the effects of the crisis in the Atlantic States had begun to be felt. The bauking firm of Sather and Church had suspended, and there had been a run on the banks of Wells, Fargo, and Co., TallantandWilde, FretzandRalston, 13. Davidson, and Parottand Co.; all the demands on these houses were promptly met, and the excitement ceasedin a few hours. Messrs. Sather and Co. stood the run for about an hour, and must have supposed themselves able to weather the storm entirely, as one of the partners addressed the besieging crowd, inviting all who had notes or checks to present them and they would be paid, but urging those who had no demands on them to quit the premises. Unfortunately, among those who accepted the invitation were the sheriff and his officers, with attachments to the amount of $40,000, for which they made an immediate levy; other attachments aftervards put into their hands swelled the amount to $100,000, for which coiu, bars, and bullion were seized as security. The firm suspended in the course of the evening. Their statement shows a geod list of assets over their liabilities. This failure appears to have been the principal damage caused by the crisis, up to the departure of the steamer; the disastrous commercial intelligence from the East, however, had only been known two days. The St. Francisco journals state that the city having passed through its period of speculation and inflation some time ago could not be much affected, everything being at the lowest point already. The liabilities of Messrs Sather and Co. amount to $464,000. The mining intelligence, and the general Californian news by this mail are not important. The rumour of last month that a train of emigrants proceeding from the State of Arkansas to California had been met and massacred by the Mormons, or the Indians in league with and instigated by them, is confirmed. The train had reached the Salt Lake city on its way in safety; had remained there some days, during which disputes and quarrels I arose between the Saints and the Arkansas emigrants; the latter applied abusive epithets both to the men and women of the community, and otherwise insulted them. The train set out from the city amid threats of vengeance, which were ruthlessly carried into effect. it had proceeded for 15 days across the country unmolesisd, but at that distance from the city was attacked by an overwhelming force of Indians, and the whole party, 118 in number, murdered. The scene of the rnassacre is about 200 miles from the Salt Lake. The train consisting entirely of settlers going to California it was supposed there was much valuable property going with it; the waggons were of course plundered. The attack is believed to have been made on the 14th of September. It may be difficult to prove the complicity of the Mormon leaders in the affair, but from the influence they have over the Indian tribes the general conviction in California is that the massacre was instigated by then. There is evidence that the deed has been applauded in the Mormon pulpits. It is described as a just retribution for the violence of the Gentiles in Missouri, and a "fulfilment of the prophecies." The session of Congress opens at Washinton on the 7th. As soon as the Speaker of the Souse of Representatives has been elected, and both House and Senate organized, the President will present his message. Considerable interest is already expressed as to Mr. Buchanan's views on the financial state of the country and the general question of the currencyas affected bythe recent convulsion. Though the matter, during the past years of prosperity, has dropped out of the list of party issues, and It is not easy to calculate how the predominant democracy may pronounce or divide upon the opposing principles of free banking and paper currency against a specie circulation and denunciation of small notes, yet the traditions of the party are rather in favour of the solid system against the "rags." It was the great hero of the party, President Jackson, who destroyed the old United States' Bank, though after doing so he permitted mnany smaller institutions to rise on its ruins, and flourish for a time by means of the deposits of the United States' Treasury ; and it was the Democratic party that deprived those banks of the custody of the Federal revenue to place it umder the lock and key of the present very safe system, which permits no one to touch Government coin but the Government officers. There are speeches of Mr. Buchanan on record in which he denounced inconvertible paper very strongly, and pointed out all its consequences in "s omething like prophetic strain ;" but whether his old experience has been modified by more modern events will not be known till he addresses Congress on the subject. He has not had to deal with this class of questions within these eight or ten years past, and in America such a period is equivalent to a quarter of a century in rendering opinions an-tiquated. The seniors of the Democratic party, however, are generally supposed to be " hrd money" men at heart, who consider the almost uiacheeked, or very imperfectly regulated issues of paper by State and private bai.iks an infringement of the Federal Con Atitution. For instance, Colonel Dfenton, w&nose popular cognomen of " Old P-aUlion" very clearly definea the position he tae6s on f.he subject, has just published a letter on i% qul,te equal in vigour to any of his past Spesahea. ane writings, when parties were doing battle. ontais oround. It is almost sufficieat to say th&4he.is," O'ld Bion" stll, only richer, perhaps,. iu.ilubtr atto,3 oi the evils of the " incoavertib! ''IMatiQx, of former period, by an abnndance of modern instances. But the source of doubt as to the side the man of the Democratic party Will take in the agitation of theories of currency lies in the younger generation; also in the degree to which the question may be made to produce political capital, and the more or less of popularity and influence 'o be gained by taking a side upon it. If the storm blows over without chiUing the milion too severely, the banking interest will probably make head against any scattered opposition, extend again, and flood the community with small paper, on. which it will go on merrily till the next crash lays everything prostrate. Seriously, there are but few signs of any deep movement of the public mind on the question. It feels for the present it has suffered damage, but is half conscious that mtich of it has been caused by careleasness-a destructive competition that enters into a reckless race of credit-giving, those who give it for the longest terms selling, or rather getting rid of, moist goods-and a habit of counting the assets shown by the ledger as money in hand. The repentant public cannot clearly apportion the degree of blame due to the bankrs and that it ought to ascribe to itself ; if disposed to treat the banking power as an enemy, it cannot trace distinetlyhowitoperates, or see what shouldbe attacked, or in what manner; and, lastly, that power has beeome so strong it has nearly outgrown regulation. Any discussion of the right of the Federal Government to interfere at all would also reawaken an old contest on the limits of its jurisdiction over the several States in such a matter, a contest that goes deep into the constitution itself, and would probably end in a formal denial of the federal authority alto-ether, as far as the finaucial legislation of the "§overelgn" States is concerned. Whether the central Government ever had such an authority is questioned; that it has let it pass to the several States is certain; and how difficult it is for any Government to recover a right, power, or privilege it has suffered to lapse by disuse or has abandoned by actual cession history abundantly proyes. It is in the Legislatures of the different States the war of the banks will really be fought. Any "comprehensive measure" coming from Washingron would probably be met, and neutralized, by the cry of " Federalism." Next to the monetary questions in point of interest, and before them in point of time, will come the Kansas perplexities ; they will come up first in Congress, because the parties opposed on them are already organized, and have accepted battle in advance. The complications of that troublesome territory are a greater puzzle than ever. A Convention, denounced by the Free State or Anti-Slaverymen as spurious and illegal in Itself, has met against many protests, and drawn up a constitution by which the territory is advanced to the dignity of a State; that constitution the eye of man has not yet seen; it remaiuns a manuscript in the hands of a select, or secret committee. But it contains-so much having been made known-a section permitting, or sanctioning, or establishing slavery. According to constitutional law, if not to invariable usage, the whole constitution ought to be submitted for confirmation or rejection to a popular vote. But the Achitophels of the Convention assert that it will be enough to submit the davery section alone to the public voice, the rest being of no consequence. As the Anti-Slavery settlers are the great majority-at least two to one over the Pro-Slavery party, this naturally causes much indignation. Governor Walker (to call him General Walker confounds him with the invader of Nicaragua) is now at Washington, denouncing, though a Southern State and ProSlavery man, the course of the Convention as unfair and iUegal; as Governor he has done all he can to prevent It, and has otherwise shown a disposition to insure fair play between the parties on the inflammable soil of Kansas He has been closeted with the President, and the Cabinet has more than once met on the difficulty presented, which is this:If the Convention is not supported in Congress by the Ministerial party, the ultra-Southern members, in House and Senate, will probably revolt, oppose the Goverrament ueasures, and make themselves as great an annoyance to the Cabinet as posdble. Taking the measure of this peril, Mr. Buchanan has, it is believed, resolved to back up the Convention, and if it present its constitution on the fragmentary vote the Government will t-ry to pass it, that final sanction being required. Governor Walker is thus thrown overboard for leaning too much to the dde of the majority with Free Soil convictions. It is remarkable that all the successive Governors of Kansas have succumbed to this influence; though chosen for their Southern opinions and tendencies, and even recommended and approved by the South, they have gone to the territory only to find dlavery impossible there, and to fall either by excess of zeal in forcing it on, provoking violence, or, by refusing their ap. proval of extreme measures, too likely to provoke it. At every failure the South has declared itself betrayed, when in truth the unhappy governors could do nothing, but had to yield to the force of circumstances. They had everygoodwill for the tak set them, but the task was impossible. They came, saw, struggled, and were dismissed for favouring the enemy. More especially has this been the case with the present governor, who, being called, like the prophet of old, to curse the foe, was constrained to pronounce a blesing. Ihis reward is the name of " Traitor to the Soutb," condemnation by the Cabinet, and, it is said, impending dismissaL It is all useless; Kansas bas been settled by a Freesoil majority; no planters with their slaves have left the regions of sugar and cotton for the less profitable fields of corn and potatoes; and if by the present juggle slavery is left part of the constitution, the next step will be to wipe it out by legislation. If Pro-lavery governors find themselves compelled to expose election frauds, and denounce illegal conventions, with a majority of Anti-slavery votes ready on the first occasion to neutralize both, the contest is virtually settled. It is incomprehensible how the South can waste its strength and crease so much iU-wil by prolonging the fruitless struggle, and by claiming politically an additional State which it has not settled, could not cultivate if it did, and which is actually possessed by the men who are opposed to its theory. Bat the controversy has been so long continued) and so overworked as a mine of political capital, that Kanas has become a public bore, and men " sicken at its very name." The mail leaves in the heat of the contested city election, which began at sunrise this morning. It will be a sharp contest; unusual preparations have been made to prevent or repress violence; but a little fig,hting is expected A committee of inquiry into the cause of the loss of the Central America steamer reports it to have been general carelessness and a want of discipline on board. The engineer, it seems, was quite independent of the captain, and his department let the fires go out. The passengers saved reported at the tinie that the stokers and firemen were drunk, but the committee does not confirm it.

A(ONEY-MABKEOTanId CITYINTBTALIGBNOB. Mfonday ]5vedng, The English funds opened thin morning at an Improvement of an eighth upon the prices of Saturday, but the market ww without animation, and a decline took place of about three-eighths per cent., from which there was only a partial recovery. Consols were first quoted 911 to J ex dividond, and; they gradually went to 91k to i, which was the lmt official quotation. After regular hous some bargains were effected at 91k to J. The stagnation of irade in the provinces is necessitating withdrawals from the savings-banks, and some of the sales which depressed the market to-day were on that account. At the same time, purchases on the part of the public have been checked by the recent advance, which has also tempted the speulators to realize. Under the circumstances, therefore, a Blight reaction is easly explained. On the other hand, no permanent fall can be looked for in the face of the gold arrivals now taking place, and which are likely to continue. In the Stock-Exchange today short loans on stock were obtainable at 5 per cent., and in the discount-market the tendency is still towards relaxation. Bank Stock left off at 217 to 219; Reduced, 91k to I; New Three per Cents., 91k to i; India Bonds, 35s. to 25s. dis. count; and Exchequer-bins, 4s. discount to par. The transactions in foreign stocks have been unusually numerous, and the market showed considerable firmnes. Russian, however, was premed for sale and receded. Buenos Ayres left off at 88 to 92. Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 94; Mexican, 18k and 19; for the account, 19k - Peruvian Three per Cents., 50 ; for the account,. 51k; Portuguese, 44 and 431; for the account, 43i; Russian Five per Cents., 103, 103i, and 104 ; ditto Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96; the Sardinian, 85k; Spanish, for the account, 41; ditto, New Deferred, 25k for money and the accoint; Turkish Six per Cent., 93, 92k, 93i, 92k, and 93k; for the account, 931 and i; ditto, Pour per Cents. Guaranteed, 99i and I; French Three per Cents., 66k; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 62k. In the corn-market this morning there was a decline of between Is. and 2s. from the rates of Monday last. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. SOc. for money and 66f. 70c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration. About 380,0001. of gold, principally Australian, has been sold to the Bank to-day. The Niagara, from Boston, has brought 160,0001., and the Tagus, from the Peninsula, 10,8701. The suspension has been announced of Messrs. Row, Prescott, and Co., the chief and most respectable house in London connected with the Swedish trade. Tlheir liabilities, which have recently been much reduced, are estimated at about 150,OOO., of which 80,0001. are on acceptances. A large number of the bills remitted to them by their correspondents have been on firms here which have lately faUed, and during the last week or two there has even been a total cessation of remittances in any shape. The prospects of liquidation are believed to be satisfactory, but they will, of course, greatly depend on the sums to be collected from suspended paper. Mr. Prescott was no longer in the firm, although his name was continued in it. He died about two years back, after having some time previously been Governor of the Bank of England. The acceptances have been returned of Messr. Richard Wiley and Co., extensive silk mercers. The bills have also been returned of Messrs S. C. Lister and Co., large woollen merchants, at Halifax. The amount of their liabilities is believed to be very heavy, but some expectations seem to be entertained that an arrangement of their difficulties may be found practicable. The firm are said to possess valuable property in royalties from patents, &c. There is a similar house at Bradford, but this does not appear to be compromised. It is said hopes are entertained that Messrs. Heine, Semon, and Co., who stopped on Friday for 700,0001., may find It practicable to resume. A meeting of creditors of Messrs Hoare, Buxton, and Co., whose suspension was announced on the 17th ult., was held this afternoon, when the following statement was submitted by MIr.

Upon these two sums may re, 't,4'vk%E lus o. a defici§ncy of 20,0001. from thlW estimated value. It is believed that in any case the total assebt will reach 119,0001., which will give a dividend of about 9N. in the pound. r. Coleman stted that on the day of surpension the accounts showed a surplus of 64,0001.; that in his opinion then the stoppage should not have taken place; and that he had ondeavoured to carry out an arrangement for the assistance of the firm. Large remittances were promised from Sweden, but in the interim Carr, Joiling, aud Co. failed, and It was the Impression of four eminent mercantile men who were consulted that it was necessary the latter house should also be reinstated. This recommendation proved impracticable. The failuro has arisen wholly from the commercial misfortunes of the last month in Sweden; there have been no Irregular transactions, nor any excess in the partners' drawings. If the whole or greater part of the debts due to the firm were paid, the creditors would get 20s. in the pound. The business connexionr of the firm were considered to be of the highest respectability. It was further stated that by the end of February sufficient will be realized to pay 3s. 4d. in the pound, provided the liabilities do not exceed the present estimate, and that if the whole of the assets can be defined at that period Mersrs. Hoare, Buxton, and Co. will be prepared to give their notes of hand at fixed dates. In the meantime the firm are not in a position to make any proposal It was finally resolved to wind up the estate under inspection, and a committee of creditors was appointed. A mweting was held to-day of the creditors of MIr. G. H. T. Hicks, a merchant of Lombardstreet-chambers, who supended on the 19th alt. A balance-sheet was submitted by Messrs. Turquand and Co., showing debts 151,9001., and assets 23,7471. It was agreed to wind up under inspection. The annexed letter on overtrading banlks contains a remarkable anecdote. The subsequent suggestions for certain oompulsory returns from such institutions would involve the objectionable principle of Government interference, which, if carried out in one branch of trade, should be applied to every other. The returns themselves may be desirable as far as any returns with regard to banks can be of value, but that is a matter between the bank and the public. If a bank finds that it can get more custom and be regarded with more confidence by making such returns, it will adopt them in its own interest, or if it forbears to do so the public can draw their own Inferences. The enforcement of their publication could guarantee nothing, and would simply dism private vigilance. The doetrine cannot be too widely inoulcated that there is no compulsion for any individual to trust either another individual or any body of individuals in the form of a bank; and that if he does so voluntarily it must be for his own convenience and advantage, and consequently at his own risk. Those who enter into transactions with persons of whose honesty or prudence they have no satisfactory knowledge deserve aU that happens, and this view would generally be acted upon were it not for the pernicious anomaly upheld by the Legislature, that the creditors of banks instead of being left to take care of themselves must be apecially protected by exclusive enactments. For the past year or two no one of any commercial experience was ignorant of the unsound natura of the management of the Liverpool Borough Bank and the Western of Scotland, and, if they had had to stand upon their character, instead of being trusted wlthl 8 or 10 millions sterling, they would have found themselves in a very humble poition. But the law of unlimited liability operated as an announcement to depositors and bill discounters that they need take no notice of auch matters, Government having provided for their safety, whatever else might happen:- " Slr,-Your observations regarding the failure of certain banking establishments in Glasgow meet the general approbation of the mercantile community. Not many years since a certain gentleman became indebted to one of these banks to the extent of several.hnndred thousand pounds; when he was hauled up it was found that he h_d I no assets, and the bank, therefore, 'insured his life' to the extent of their debt, upon which they, of coarse, pay a very heavy annual tax. This gentleman called on the bank some time after and told one of the managers, ' I am offered a luorative situation in Sierra Leone, but yoa knew if I go out there the policy wi be vitiated; however, I must go, as I can. not starve.' What, then, was to be done? The same man Is now comfortably living on the continent on an annuity granted him by this bank, which annuity, added to the premium of insurance, forms a nice little item In the expenses of the estblishment. "The amount involved in the above transaction was,'I have good grounds for believing, no less than 350,000Z., and I am also further led to believe that this amount forms part of the ' assets' of the bank. 1 so, you will admnit that a strict investlgation into the nature of these assets is most desirable. In fact, such disclosures serve to show the necessity for the appointment of a special committee by every banking establishment, selected from among the shareholders and sworn to secrecy, whose special duty it should be to examine into and report upon the validity of the asset account at every general meeting of pro prietors. " I quite agree with you that there is already perhaps too much Government interference with the free course of trade, but as banking establishments are ' trustes of pubbUc property' the laws bearinguponthem should beso stringent as to close the door as much as possible aga:nst fraud. "The formation of such a committee as I have indicated should be made compulsory by law, and I would also recommend, in addition to the banking returns already required, that every bank should be obliged to furnish weekly or monthly a return of the amount of deposits, discounts, and their customers' over-checks, with the value of the immediately convertible securities received against them. " Of course I do not mean that the over-checks of inaiL vidual accounts should be published. I refer merely to the amount in gross, which, whlle its publication could not injure individual credit, would serve as an effectual check upon the actions of the bank iteelf. " These requirements may be considered too inquisitorial but recent events have too painfuly evidenced their necessity, as there cannot be a question that if the suspended banks had been prudent in their advanoes they would hare been able to overcome the recent crisis. For the faUire of mercantile firms there are many palliations and excuses, but for the failure of a bank, prudently managed, I can scarcely admit any reasonable cause. " The recent, indeed I may still say the existing panic has been fearfully augmented by the recklessness of certain banks, which in their failure have spread misery and sufferlug throughout whole districts of country, sweeping away with them the last mite of the widow and the orphan. "I am, &c., "THlE EDITOR OF THE BELFAST MER- CANTILE JOUBNAL." At a meeting of the Bank of Australasia this afternoon, Mr. 0. Farrer in the chair, the report was unanimously adopted. In the course of the discussion, which was principally of a congratulatory nature, it was stated that the amount of reserve fund is 200,0001. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- " The directors express their satisfaction with the con. tinned prosperity of the bank. A careful review of the advances enables them to state that they are of a safe character and represent sound commercia transactions; an opimion which is confirmed by the reports of their officers. The bils under discount were met with great regularity, Lffording evidence of the stability of credit, and no bad debts of any importanc had occnrred during the half year. At the same time the directors must remind the proprietors, thatthe fluctuations in trade towhich the Australian markets are peculiarly liable, and the high price of bullion, rendering ixchange operattons of little profit, considerably augment the difficulties of banking. Tbh general progress ana increasing prosperity of the Australian colonies are subjets for sincere congratulation. The production of gold hd increased. Fresh discoveries had been made, and t,Ie newrlyfOund goldfifld at Mount Ararat, in the colony ci Victoria, hids fair to rival, in the permanency and licbmess of its yield, the old digginigs at BWllarat.

A telegram from Edinburgh to-day rtates that Mr. John Edward Stephens,.of the late London crd Eastern Bank, failed to appear before the court today for his further examination, and that a warrant for his apprehension has accordingly beell issued. He is believed to have started for London. The case of a member of the Stock-Exchange, who is alleged to have been in the habit of obtaining by improper means the contents of telegraphic messages transmitted to London from the Coatinent, is to be heard and decided upon to-morrow by the coramittee of that establishment. In the recent instanee of murder and suicide at Croydon by a clerk in the service of the Bank of England, it appears that the young man had previously sustained losses from speculations, whicb had been carried on for him by a broker in the StockExchange. A few years back a very atringent notice was issued by the committee to prevent any member of that house from undertaking such transactions for persons holding situations of trust, and it is to be hoped they will institute an inquiry into the present case. The following relates to the facilities presented to insolvents for passing examinations without any danger of their being pursued by opposing creditors. It is believed to be a common thing for attorneys employed in these cass to recommend a resort to certain provincial County Courts, where the judges have a reputation of being mild:- " Sir.-Your notice of the cae of Mr. John Edwmrd Stephens, showing the facilities with whlch baukrupts and insolveAts get -way from their creditors, Induces me to cal your attention and that of your readers to the notice of the bearing.of an Insolvent in the Canterbury County Court who describes himsel as follows- " 'TheophilusHarris, formerly of Iandowne-house, No. 3, Iansdowne-place, Upper Holloway, iddlesex, aistant at a boarding and day school; afterwards of same place, boarding and day schoolmaster; afterwards of East Moulsey, Sutrey, out of business, and following no ocupation; after. wards of No. 5, Hilldrop-road, Taffnell-park, Holloway, Middlesex, schoolmaster ; afterwards of tbe Saracen's He.& Inn, Burgate-street, and next and late of 24, St. Peter'sstreet, both in Canterbury, Kent, out of employment, & prisoner in tho gaol of Canterbury, in the county of Kent, whose petition and schedule filed, &a.'

" Sir,-Referring to the letter in the City Article of Th, Times of this day of Mr. Daneri, as attorney of the Trans. atlatio Company of Genoa, and boing unwiing to occupy your columns with a controversy, I beg to state, on behalf of Mesrs. Draper, Pietronl, and Co., that the statement of their affairs which will be submittedi to a meeting of their creditors, called for the 22 inst., will sufficiently establish whether the remarks in their circular of the 14th of November, referred to in Mr. Daneri's letter, were unfounded or not.

The number of ships reported inward was 250. Those cleared outward amounted to 102, including 22 in ballast. The number on the berth loading for the Ausralian colonies is 57. Some doubt having been expressed as to the sailing of the European on the 11th of November, the day fixed for her departure, with the homevard mail from Sydney, it has been amcertained from the officers of the Simla that the European would be ready for aea a week earlier.
THE E4ASTERy BA42?. (By ELECT1RIC A-ND ITERNATIO3AL TELEGRA.) EDINBURGH, MONDAY. At the Bankruptcy Court this day Stephens did not appear. Application was made in his behalf for an adjourn.nent on the ground of ill health, and to give him time to look over books and docoments on which he had been unex. pectediy examinei. Application, on the other hand, was rnade by the trastee for a warrant for his apprehension. Mr. Sheriff Hallard overruled the first application, thcre being no rmedical certificate produced, and granted a warrant to apprehend him. MONDAY EvENING. In a letter to the tra*ee hIr. Stephens states that his health has suffered greatly frorm his long-continued and baraming examination. It was, he adds, unreasonable to expect he should on the instant account for the contents of the many letters, books, and documents of the bank kept by suboriinate offloers, and that he should have the responsibility of all their entries fixed on him. On subsequent inquiry he finds that he has made statements to his prejudice, which are acknowledged to be erroneous, and he therefore wishes ample time to look over the bhnk books that he may rectify and prevent erroneous statements in future, and that he may show that all the advances to Waugh were sanctioned by the directors, and that so late as Februamy lat he wus sred by Colonel Yates that Waugh's security only wanted time to be worth a million. His agent has appealed to the Court of Session. against Sheriff Hallard's decision, bnt this does not stay execution of the warrant to apprehend.

The victory of Mehidpore in 1817, which broke the power of Holkar and virtually put an end to the Mahratta war, was won under the personal command of the late Sir Thomas Hidlop. For this great service, and for the successful conduct of the campaign, he, In common with the general and otber officers under his orders, received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament; and abo assumed by Royal command the word "Deccan" on a conspicuous pattofhisarms. Sir.Tohu3ialcoIm, to the end of his life a friend of Sir Thomas Hislop, was present at the actio. in command of a division, and distinguished himself by the gallantry and zeal which belonged to his character, but he was not in command of the forces.

BAILWAY AND MINING SHAEAS. Monday Evening. The railway-market has shown greater firmness, and in some cases an advance has taken place. .Midland and Great Western inproved, the former mearly 1 per cent., but the highest prices were not fully maintained to the close. Eastern Counties -were in active demand, and left off about 1 per cent. above the last quotation on Saturday. Caledonian and Great Northern receded. The arrangements for the settlement of the account show that North-Eastern stocks have been rather extensively sold for transfer in connexion with the late banlding difficulties in the north. Colonial shares were fairly supported. French descriptions advanced on receipt of higher prices from Paris; Parls and Lyons formed the exception, and declined, from the serious diminution of the traffic on this line. American securities were flatter. Canada Government Bonds continue in request. Tn mines Alfred Consols and Wheal Edwards receded, and an improvement oceurred in Brazilian Imperial and Cobre Copper.

This ex. hlbitlon has done a great deal of good. The specimes of white and geencrops shown bythe Royal Dublin Soety havretnded greatlr to direct the attention of agtodouturallets and capitalists to the capabiliweus of Ireland as a producer of farm prodnoe under good manement.

JUDICIAL COMMITTBE of the PBrVY COUNCIL, Dec. 14. LA PLATA.-COLLIJION. (Before Mr. PEMBERTON LEIGH, Sir W. MAumt, and Sir J. DoDso0.) This was an action brought by the owners of the Hanoverian brig Helene, 190 tons, ainst the South American and General Steam Navigation Company, the owners of the steamship La Plata, to recover damages for injuries which the Helene had sustained by a collision. It appeared that a between 10 and 11 on the morning of the 10th of October, 1856, the Helene, then on her way from Newcastle-on-Tyne to London with coals, was prooeeding up the Thames in charge of a licensed pilot, and towed by the steamtug Rent, when, upon rounding Blackwall-polnt, she perceived LA Plata coming in an opposite direction, towed by the steamtug William Gunston. The case of the Helene was, that sbe ported her helm and immediately afterwards put It hard to port, and that La Flats, instead of porting her helm, came stem on and struck her just before the min rigging on the port side. She was so much injured that she had to be run on shore on the south side of the river and temporarilry repaired beforo she could proceed to her destination. On the part of La Plata It was alleged that her helm was put hard to port, and that of the steamtug was put to port off Blackwall. as the Rose and other vessels, among which uwa the Helene, were seen roundingthepoint thattheBosepassedher,butthatthe midships of the Helene shortly afterwards came Into contact with her stem in consequence of the Haelene and the Kent not porting their helm until too late. La Plata also contiended that the Helena was keeping more on the south side of the river than ahe ought to have done when the accident occurred. The caue was tried in the Admiralty Court in May last, and the Trinity Brethren came to the conclusion that La Plata was not to blame for the collision. The owners of the Helena now appealed apinst that decision. Mr. J. Wilde, Q.C., and Dr. Robinson were counsel for the appellants; Dr. Addamn and Dr. Twiss for the respon. dents. Sir W. K&ULE sidd their Lordships wore of opWion, that La Plta was not shown to have been guilty of negligence, and that the collision was an accident for which no one was to blame. The decision of the Court below must therefore be reversed.

(BefOrt th6 LORD CHACRLLOB and thc LoBDs Jus=Sop oF A PzAPU) 9 pea ir uypL K aan oraer o0 sts Matr of the Rolls The facts of the case were that Walter Hall, pre- vious to the year 1847 (the time of his death), was engaged in the working of certain mines in the county of Northumberland, in partuershi with his brother, Alhred Hall. The testator, Walter Hall, by his vwill charged his pro rty with the payment of an annuity of 1001. to his son Henry Foley Hail, and then left his estate in moieties between his said brother Alfred and his sister Matilda NalL Alfred Hall carried on the mining operations for some time after the death of his brother without making any profits, and eventually, after receiving notice to qult, retained possesdon of the mines under a fresh arrangement down to the time of his death. Alfred Hall died intestate, and Matilda Hall was his personal representative, as well as being the executrix of her brother Walter HlL The plalutff, who was the purchaser of theinterert of Henry Fole Hall under the wll of Walter HalL instituted the present suit for an account, and a decree was made, inter alia, directing an Inquiry to ascertain what interest Walter Hall was pos. sessed of in the mines in question at the time of his death. The chief clerk certified that all Walter Hal's interest ceased on his death, and that the mines became the sole property of Alfred Hail, subject to his accounting for Walter Hall's capital therein and the profits thereon. The Master of the Rols, on appeal, affirmed the certificate in substance, and from that decison the plaintiff brought the present appeal. The case was first brought before the Lords Justices, upon whose suggestion It was referred to this Court. Mr. R.

VICE-CEANCELLOR'S COURTS, MoNlNDAY, DEC. 14. COIBY V. WATTS. mX_ _ _ _ _ (BCfore Vicc. Chancelor Sir J. STUAI.T.) -- wa rssuiueu. X6 ou WAs Siaed bY William Cory, as the registered public officer of the London and County Joint-stook Banking Company, for the purpose of establishing the priority of the bank in respect of a mortgage for 7001. over a mortgae subsequently granted by the mortgagor, Mr. Green, to the Rev. Mr. Formby, and afterwards transferred by the latter to the defendant, James Watts. The eiroumstances of the case, as aleged by the bill, were as follows :-On the 31st of March, 1853, the London and County Bank by their manager at the Ashford branch, advanced 4001. to the defendant Green on the security of a bill of exchange for that amount, dated March 3, 1853, and payable three months after date, and drawn by E¢dward Wattb, of Hthe, solicitor, upon and accepted by Green, and also on the security of a deposit on the same day by Green with the bank of a lease of a messuage at Foikestone. to which Green was entitlect for the residue of a term of 9 years, commencing in June, 1852; suoh deposit /as accompanied with a memorandum signed by Green, in which he stated that It was mado as a farther security for the before-mentioned advance, and he thereby undertook, whenever called upon, to execate a mortgage of the before-mentioned messuage, or iany other document at my own cost which the bank may deem requisite for the better seourlng the said smount, or any sum or sums of money which may at any time be owing by me to you for principal, interest, and costs." On the 3d of December, 1853, the bank advanced to Green a further sum of 3001. on the security of a bill drawn by Green on one Walsh, and endorsed by Edward Watts to the bank. In November, 1854, Green bein desirous of paying off both the above sums of 4001. and 0.,which were then still drce by him to the bank, employed Edward Watts as his solicitor to negotiate a loan for him on the security of the above leasehold property, and the Rev.I Mr. Formby being also desirous of lending 1,0w1. on good freehold security, he employed Edward Watts to obtain such a mortgage for him. On the 2d of Deoember, 1854, Mr. Formby, having confidence in Edward Watts, paid the 1,0001. to him (Ed^ward Watts), In order that it might be invested as proposed, and Edward Watts gave Mr. Formby a receipt for the amount. Green hkewise having confidence in Edward Watts signed a deed, which purported to be a mortgage of the before-mentioned leasehold messuage from Green to Mr. Formby, but he did not receive any part of the sum of 1.0001. which had been handed for investment to Edward Watts by ir. Formby, nor did he sign any receipt for it on the mortgage deed. The mortgage deed was sub. sequently sent by E. Watts to Mr. Formby, who then discovered that it was a mortgage of leasehold and not of freehold property as desire~d by him. On the 12th of March, 1855, Green executed a mortgage to the bank of his leasehold messuage at Folkestone for securing the befoea. tioned sumns of 4001. and 3001. MIr. Formby, having iscersamned that no part of the sum of 1,0001. handed by him to ESdward Wattb had reached the hands of Green, made a application in the matter to the Court of Queen's Bench the result of which was that in June, 1855, Edward Watts was ordered to pay to 3Mr. Formby the sum of 5501X, part of the sum of 1,0001., within one month, and that thereupon all securities were to be given up, released, and transferred by Mr. Formby at the expense of Edward Watts, and that Formby should execute a deed of arrangement between Edward Watts and his creditors for the sum of 4401, being the residue of the 1,0001. In April, 1855, notice was given to the London and County Bank of the mortgage from Green to Formby. Shortly after the order of the Court of Queen's Bench, the defendant James Watts, on the application of Edward Watts, paid the sum of 5501. to Mr. Formby, and thereupon Formby assigned to James Watts the before-mentioned mortgage and mortgage debt secured by the mortgage to Formby. Edward Watts did not act as solicitor for James Watts, his brother, on the occasion of the assignment of the mortgage for 1,000Z. to the former. James Watts claimed to be a mortgagee for 1,0001. of the leasehold messuage mortgaged by Green to Formby, subject only to a prior mortgage to the bank for the sum of 4001.; while the bank contended that the memorandum signed by Green, and dated the 31st of March, 1853, showed that the deposit of the title deeds then made was intended not only to secare the sum of 4001. then advanced by them to Green, but also all future advances, and thereforo that they were entitled to priority in respect of their mortgage of March, 1855, for 700G. over the assignment to the defendant James Watts. The mortgagor Green admitted that the memorandum of the 31st of March. 1S53, was intended to secure not only the sum of C01., but all future advances made to him by tho bank. It appeared that shortly after Mr. Formby had paid the sum of 1,0001. to Edward Watts the latter had stopped payment and made an arrangement with his creditors, and thls was alleged as an excuse on his behalf for not having psid the above sum to Green. The case has occupied the Court during the greater part of the last three or four days. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Henry Stevens were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr.Malinsand Mr.W.D.Levwis for James Watts; and Mr. Clement Swanston for Green, the mortgagor. The VICE-CHANCyLLOR said there would be no qeston of the plaintift's right to enforce his security, but tXhst the defendant James Watts asserted a right as against the plaintiff underthe deed of transfer of the mortgae of 1, 000b from Green to Formby, The case of James Watts was hat he was entitled to stand before the plaintiff in respect of 3001., part of the sum of 7001., inasmuch as he was a purchaser for valuable consideration, and had the legal estate vested in him. The defendant's case must depend on his proving that the deed of transfer to him could be set up as against the plaintiff. There was another question as to whether the memorandum extended to cover not only the sum of 4001., but the further sum of 300. Bat unless James Watts could make out his case under the transfer no question could arise as to the right of the bank to enforco the whole of their security. The first step which the defendant had to establish was, that the mortgago from Green to Forinby constituted a valid mortgge as aganst Green's estate, for unless Formby held by a vald title the case of James Watts, his assignee, mustentirely faiL On the result of the evidence it was extremely difficult to soe that the relation of debtor and creditor ever subsisted between Green and Formby, and it must be shown that there was a valid debt before the charge could be held to be valid. The foundation of title of James Watts seemed then essentially to faIL It was moreover difficult to see how a title acquired ns was that of James Watts could confer a right to sue In this court. He had full notice of the circumstances under which the tra-Aefer was made to him, and he had no such title as would entitle him to rank as a mortgee against Green's estate for the sum of 1,0001 The ViweChanoeIor after expressing an opinion to the effect that the memo. randam extended to cover future advances, and after sayig that in no view could he satisfy himself that James Watts had a title whioh he could set up against the plaintiff in this snit, said that such had been the conduct of Edward Watts, who was an officer of this court, in aelation to the transactions which were the subject of this sukt that he should eonsider it his duty to transmit tD the Lord Chancellor the pa rs diselosing the conduct of Edward Watts, in order that hi Lordship might determine ma to the manner in which he should be dealt with. There would be a decree declaring the plaintiff entltled' to pnonty In respect of tho two uMns of 4001. and 300!. oier the deendant James Watts; the plaintii'x costs would be added to his security, and the uestion of costs as between Green and James Watts would%"., reserved. (Before Vice-Chancdlor Sir W. P. WOOD.) The Court was occupied for a considerable portion of the day with the arguments arising upon the construction of an obscuLre will, which involved various technical questions as to "lapse," " gifts by way of substitution"tp e of no public interests.

UOURT OP, QUEEN'S BENCHr. OaTTT.TU, . T-n- BRASS AN-D A?ROTEIER V. MAIITLAnM A X . (Sitings at Ni8i POWu before L CA2 TP, LL anc mr M. rnemiger, Mr. Wilde, and Mr. Blackbur were counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. Bovill and Mr. Coleridge appeared for the defendants. The declaration alleged that the defendants had shipped a quantity of chloride of Hme insufidciently packed, and with. out giving notice of its dangerousqualities, onbo6rdtho hip Regina, tne property of the pIlintif4 and that a large portion of the rest of the cargo was injured by the gases which escaped from the chloride of lime. It appeared that the vessel in question was placed on the berth in 1854 as a general ship for Calcutta; the defendants, Messrs. Maitland, Ewing, and Co., engaged freight for 60 casks of bleaching powder, or chlorld of lime; the casks werestowedbetweendecksalongthesides, next them were crates of glas, and in the centro a large quantity of hale goods ; dnring the voyage the greatest annoyance was experienced fromn the ewscp of gam, and when the hatcheg were opened on the arriva of the vessel at Calcutta it was found that by the action of the chlorine pas evolved from the bleaching powder the casks in which it was were com. pletely eaten away, and all the plecegoods totlly deprived of their colour. The plaintiff had to py 9331 17s. 2d. to the owners of these goods, and now sought to recover that amount from the defendants, founding their claim on the obligation in law which attaches on all shippers of dangerous or destructive goods to give notice of ther quaity and nature, unless they are of such a description as that it may reasonably be supposed that the shipowners and their agents are cognizant of their nature and character. The case for the plaintiffs was that neither they nor the captain were at all aware of the dangerous quality of the artlele, which was merely sbipped as blewhing powder, and a number of witneses were called to prove that the casks were not of the peculiar character in which such an artole ought to be packed for so long a voyage. The defence was that the bleaching powder was a wellknown article of commerce, and well known to be composed of chloride of lime, so that the plaintiffs and the captain of the ship must have been aware of its character; that the casks in question were of a particularly good deo scriptioP, prepared especlally for the purpose; that the dry goods ought not to have been stowed so near them; and, further, that the casks should have been placed In the bottom of the hold instead of in the wings, and that the injury wasto be attributed to the fact of the casks being placed vwhere they were wetted by the dropping from the seams of the deck which were strained from the heavy weather and the effecs of a collision with another vessel, which took place at an early period of the voyage. The jury found that the casks were of the proper kind, but had not been properly stowed in the vessel, and that the injury to the bale goods arose from the improper stowage, and that the plaitiffi' broker and captain might and reasonably ought to have known the nature of the bleaching powder. Verdict for the defendants, with leave to move. THE ROYAL BRIISH BANK CASE. Iora CA1PBnxi,L, addressing Sir F. Thesiger, sad that, with regard to the prosecution inst the directors of the Royal British Bank, he would take the opportunity of stating that he wishea to have a conference with the lead. ing counsel on both sides to consider what would be the best day to fix for the commencement of the trial. Sir F. ThxssoG. would communicate his lordship's wiSh to his learned friends; he supposed his lordehip would not want to meet more than two or three of the leaders. Lord CAMIPBELL feared he would hkve to adjourn to the Guildhall if they were all to be hoard, but he should wish that all had an opportunity of giving their opinion. SECOND COURT. (Befor hlr.

COURT OF COMMON PTF.Aq nThn IA GODDEN V. 3AISMA,. (Sittings at Ni*i Prius, at Gui2dhall, before Chicf Jrustia ICOCKBui and a SPecia Jurn-) The trial of this cause, part heard on Saturday, was re. sumed this morning. Mir. Ltush, Q.C., and Mr. Turner appeared for the plain. tiff; and Mr. Serjeant Byles and M1r. Preaitice for the defendant. This was an action for a libel, the most Important plea on the record being a justification of the libeL It appeared from the statement of the plaintiff's counse! that the defendant came on board the steamer Harlequin, of which the plaintiff was captain, and which ran between London and Yarmouth, at Gravesend upon the evening of September 10, 1856. There were at that time several persons drinking champagne below ; and Mr. Haisman having observed the captain drinking what he supposed to be brandy and water, but which was in fact merely water coloured with bitters, and seeing him about to drink a glams of champagne, asked wbose watch it was; upon which some altercation arose, end. ing in the defendant saying, "I don't think chanpagne after brandy is a gcod preparation for a watch." A man named Cooper had been abusing the defendant for interfering, but that appeared to have blown over at this time. The steamer proceeded to Yarmouth, and arrived there in the usual time. On arriving the defendant stated to one of the witnesses that the captain would have got drunk if he had not interfered, Subsequently he wrote two letters, one to the registrar of seamen, in which heaccusedthe plaintiff of getting drunk on the voyage to Yarmouth, and the ether to the Shipping Gazette, detalline the circumstances. The contents of the letters will bo read ly colected from the defendant's evidence and that of the other witnesses called. *Upon these letters and a conversation which he was rsaid to have had after the voyage was over, and which wll also appear below, this action was founded. The Board of Trade directed proceedings to be taken on this statement of the defendant, and no action was brought until this hsd taken place, The investi,tion was held, and the captain *Tas found to be innocent, and the report concluded by saying that " Captain Godden's sobriety is unimpeached." The defendant, however, still continued to assert and to disseminate the contrary; and on a day subsequent to the termination of the inquiry he reiterated the charges upon another steamer belonging to the same Company, and said, further, that he was so drunk that he could not keep his own watch. Under these circumstances the plaintiff had, it was said, no option but to try this action. The defendant now pleaded a justification, and reasserted the cha of drunkenness. Captain Godden was called, and stated that he had been 10 years a master, and four years in the service of the General Steam Navigation Company, commanding the Harlequin. She carried sometimes 200 passengers. It was a frequent practice in these vessels for the passengers to ask the captain to drink, and in order to avoid intoxication, it was arranged between captains and stewards that if gin and water were the liquor selected, water alone should be brought; and if brmndy and vater, that the pure element should be coloured with bitters or porter. When the defendant interfered, he said he was 9peang for the public safety, and that J had no business ow. I did not join in Cooper's conversation with defendant. I was not more than 15 minutes in the supper-room. He asked me if I knew I was responsible to any one besides mny employer. I said, "Yes- the Board of Trade I suppose you mean." I went on dec; on the bridge, and never came below again. It was a fine night. I collected the passage money at half-past 5 in the morning. We reached Yarmouth at S.

TrIE SOUTH-EASTERN RAILWVAY COTPA.y This was another of the series of actions brought against the defendants by the passengers who were injured by the collision which took place on the company's line, near Lewisham, on the 28th of June last. Mr. Hawkdns and Mr. Joyce appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Phinn and Mr. Huddleston represented the defendants. It appeared that the plaintiff was a linendraper's assistant, and that on the occasion of the accident he was thrown against the opposite passenger, whose hat cut his nose. He was then forced back by the recoil, and he re. celved a severe blow on the back of his head from the framework of the carriage. He, however, managed to walk home, a distance of a mile and a-half. On his arrival he sent for a medical gentleman, who attended him from that time down to the present, and whose bill amounted to 29. He was ordered to go to the Isle of Wight, where he re. mnained a fortnight, and'he stil suffered from the effeets of the accldent. The expense of the trip to the Isle of Wight amounted to 14Z. The jury ultimately returned a verdiot for the plaintif, with 1001. damages.

This was a sitting for the choice of assignees, and the two bankrupts, C. F. and E. Schlesinger, applied to be discharged from custody. They were opposed by the detaSning creditors, and also by the asslgnees. hfr.LINKLATER, for the aesignees, stated that the bank rnpts and Mr. Parftt, sen-, had been folly examined, and that, according, to the bankrpts' own 5tatement, they had been guiity of fraud in obtaining from Mr. Farmer, one of the assignees, hops of the value of about 1,2007. The two bankrapts in custody had sworn that on the 18th ef No. vember last an accountant had been employed by Mr. Parfitt, gen. to Investigate their books, and that on the 20th of November the three bankrupts had communicated to him that they were unable to meet their engagements for that month, and requested further asaistance, informing Mr. Parfitt, sen., at the same time that they had not means of meeting their engagements for November, which amounted to about 8004, except what could be obtained from the then contemplated transaction with Mr. Farmer. The bankrupts stated that they informed Mr. Parfitt, sen., that theywere underterms to purchase the hops from MIr. Farmer, which they intended to consign to Australia for eale on their own account, and that if they could obtain the delivery order they coold draw upon houses in London, through whom they could be shipped to the amount of about 8001. ; whereupon Mr. Parfitt, sen., reoommended them to close the transaction for the purpose of enabling them with the proceeds to arise from the disount of xhese biUs to meet their liabilities for November. hIr.

Farmer that the goods ha4 been purcbased by them for a customer to whom they had been sold, and that upon that representation of the bankrupts the delivery order bad been given to them on the25thof November, upon which they had obtained from two respectable houses acceptances to the amount of 8001., and that those accepta-ces had been handed by the bankrupts to Mr. Parfitt, sen., vwho had tetained them for his own use. That on the 28th of November, in consequence of communications from Mr. Parfitt, sen.'s, accountant, he had declined to assist the bankrupts; and thaton tho following Monday-namely, 30th of November, the two bankrupts now in custody were arrested, Mr. Parfitt, jun., having escaped the officers. htr. Par6tt, sen., thereupon obtained an adjudication of bankruptcy against all the members of the firm for the purpose of obtaining proteotion for his son, and with a view to the administration of the estate. The two bills in ques. tion had been handed to the oficial assignee to abide the order of the Court, and Mr. Ilnklater intinated that it was the intention of his client to aslc for an order to prosecute the bankrupts for obtaining goods on credit within three months of their bankruptcy, under the false colour and pretence of carrying on business In the ordinary course of trade. 'Under these circumstances he asked that the bank. zupts should not be released from custody unless bail was given for their appearance at the sittings of the Court from time to time. Mr. HorcOOD, for Mr. Parfitt, sen., denied the statement of the bankrupts. that he had promised to get the bills discounted for them, and intimated hls readiness to abide by the order of the Court. Mr. Moss, for the bankrupts, urged that they should be discharged. The CosirmissioNnE intimated his opinion that ball should be given, and the names of two gentlemen were pro. posed. They were examined by Mr. LINKLATXR, who expressed himself satisfied with one, but the other not being satisfac. tory the bankrupts remained in custody. lt was stated that in March last the twvo bankrupts in custody showed a surplus of 3,6001., upon the faith of which Mlr. Parfitt, jun., then a minor, went into partner. ship with them, and that their present liabilities are up. wards of 13,0001., the assets being under 2,0001. (Before Afr. Commissioner GOULBURN.) IN RE DANIDSON AND GORDON. The bankrupts were colonial merchants, of Mincing-lane. Mr. ELm ISLIE, for the bankrupta, said they would to-morrow have their discharge from the criminal sentence (two years' hard labour), but they would still b e in contempt with the Court of Bankruptcy for not answering questions. He applied that they might be allowed to surrender and purge themselves of their contempt. Bis HONOUR said the application must be made in proper form. Mr. LBiN.rLATrn, for the assignees consented to the appllcation being heard on WedneEday. Order accordingly.
INSOLVRAT DEBTO.Sl COURT, Dec. 14. _ 11- TN RE GEORGE DELIANSON CLARK. (Before Mr. Commi3ionr PaImurs.1 .Lwa insoLven; appUeg tor hlS discharge. MIr. Sargood opposed on behalf of Mr. P. W. Kennard, The case occupied the Court intil seven o 'olock, but the facts which are likely to interest the public may be stated In a comparatively few words. The debts in the schedule were stated at 6,7661., while the debts due to tle insolvent were put down at the sum of 9,3001., arising from a claim upon Mr. Kennard for services rendered, and for money exgended on account of transctions in which that gentleman and Baron Hecquerin were jointly interest-ed. It nppeared that about the beginning of 1853 SMr. Kennard became associated with Baron Hecquerin, as holder of a cancessiou granted by the French Government for the erectior of model lodginghouses in the Rue de Montreuil, Paris, upon account of which a subv6ation was to be paid by the French Govern. ment. The insolvent, who bad been the orlginator of the plan, received a power of attorney from Mr. Kennard, be. sides 2,0001. in cash, and the only matter in dispute was in reference to certain statements in the schedule referring to that transaction, in conjunction with others of a simUar chs.racter for the erection of lodginghouses at the Batig. nolles, resulting in a claim made by the insolvent for 9,3001. against Mr. Kennard. That gentleman, on the other hand, not only denied his liability to the insolvent, but claimed a debt of 55OZ. for money lent, which he had substantiated by recovering a judgment, upon which the insolvent had been in custody since October, 1856. The case was opened by the opposing counsel as one in which the schedule was wilfully false, and Mr. Kennard was called to prove that he had advanced 2,0001. on account of the build. ings in the Rue de Montreuil, aned had never participated in any other affair, although he had consented to allow the 2,0001., when repaid by the subvention from the French Giovernment, to b set off in shares of the Soci6M des Ha. bitations Gu?snres, which association, however, he believed had never been formed. After the insolveut had assured him that all the accounts In oonnexion with the buildings inthe Rue de Montrenil had been settled, Mr. Kennard stated that he had been called upon to pay 6,0001. or 7,000b, a large proportion of which was for matters that the insolvent had declared to be finally disposed of. The insolvent swore that he belfeved that his claim against Mr. Kennard was weU founded, and upon his attention being called to admissions contained in several of his letters that he had no claim for remuneration for personal services, which nevertheless formed a considerable item of his demand, he explained the variance by saying that Mr. Kennard had undertaken to perform certain engagements which would have been advantageous to him (insolvent), but which, not being performed, released him from the understanding that he was not to be remune. rated for his personal services The learned counsel ex. pressed the anxiety of his client, Mr. Kennard, to have the matter properly adjusted. He was willing to consent to any arrangement by which the insolvent or his representatives could try the "ation which the latter had commenced. After avery long and desultory discussion an adjourmment for three months was agreed to, the insolvent to be released upon sureties of the reduced amount of 2501. oach by consent of the opposing creditor, and in the meantimg to endeavour to induce the creditors or his friends to indemnify the provisional assignee in prosecuting the action agait Mr Kennard.
WIKNER ASBSIZES. NORTHERN CIRCUIT. LIVERPOOL, DEC. 1L (Before Mr. JuStics WIG1UTMAN.) John Doherty surrendered to take his trial on a charge of baving at Liverpool, on the 13th of May last, by certain false pretences,obtained from the Borough Bank of Liver- pool, through their publio officer, certain bills of lading, with intent to cheat and defraud the said Borough Bank; also with having, by false pretences, obtained from John Bingham and another, their acceptanecs to two bills of exchange, drawn by himself, of the value of 2,950.1, with intent to cheat and defraud the said John Bingham and another. The indictment contained 10 counts, varying the charges, but the above may be taken as the substance of the misde. meanour charged against the defendant. The case created considerable interest, especially among the mercantile community, illustrating, as it did, an instance of the mode in which the defendant carried on his transactions with the Borough Bank, the recent disastrous failure of whioh is fresh in the memory of our readers, and the high credit which he maintained, embarking on enormous transactlons which terminated rather suddenly in his bankruptcy a few months since with liabilities amountirg to upwards of 100,0001., for a large portion of which the bank in question are said to be creditors. Mr. Aspinall and Mr. Temple conducted the prosecution, Mr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Brett appeared for the defendant. Mr. ASPINALL, in addressing the jury, said the charge 'was one unquestionably of great importance to the prisoner at the bar, and one of the gieatest possible commercial ira. portance, both on aceount of the question -which it raised and also on account of the very nature of the charge itself. The prisoner, Mr. John Doherty, until recently, when he was reduced to bankruptcy, was one of the largest provision merchants in this port. He carried on business to a considerable extent with the Borough Bank in this town. It appeared that a course of business had arisen between Mr. Doherty and the Porough Bank which he (Mr. Aspinall) thought the jury woruld be of opinion was rather a loose one, and which probably held out some temptations, but which would be best explained by stating exactly what took place upon the particular occasions whEen it was charged the prisoner made false pretences to the Borough Bank. On the 22d of April, 1857, Mr. Smith, the manager of the Borough Ban, received from the prisoner a letter to the following effect:- AprI 1857. "Dsear Elr,un sreipJt of a bin of lading fror ke.54 beebe? !, ofre. diancor, pr Wbstr, fom vernd,Gurey, and Co., please give them a guarantee that any acceptanceto br.

" I au; desr Sir. soure truly. * J. P. G. Emith, ]thq." *-JOHN DOffERTY1 On the same day he received from the prisoner another letter, which ran as foUows s- Lverpl, Aprl 22,1857. 1h1Sir,-1 have recelved bil of lading from Von for 10,584 bhBhels ctladnacorn. tie Webster, sold to Messrs John Bingham and Co., wbose acceptance for the amount will be paid to the bank opptost, by acceptance tor £1,S60, which you bave guaranteed. *I am, dear Sir, yours trnly. J. P. O. Smith, Eeq., Borough Bank."D On the 28th of April Mr. Smith received two other letters of precisely the same character, but relating to another parcel of goods. The following were the other two letters :- 157. "Dear Sr,--On recelpt of a bill of lading for 7,007 busbelndaun corn per Southampton from Messr&. Stern, Brothes, pleme give them a guarantee that my acceptance to Mr. James Doherty's draught for ;I.100, due as per enclosed advice, wi le uald at maturity. "T The corn Is sold to Mears.

PG. smith, Baq., Borough Bank.' With reference to the mode of proceeding it seemed, as they would have observed in the fint letter, that the bills of lading were sent down from the different parties who held them to the Borough Bank, and upon the receipt cf them the Borough Bank wero in the habit of guaranteeing Mr. Doherty's acceptance of somebody else's draught; and almost immediately after that Mr. Doherty, who had frequently sold the goods before they arrived, was in the habit of going to the Borough Bank with such a letter as that which came second in each of the cases, and upon the representations which he had made, both in the first letter and the second, that the goods had been sold to a rticular party, the Messrs. Binghar, he would obtain a of lading, to take away and deliver; and the Bor0u h Bank had suSficient confidence that he would brngrak k the price of those goosl bThey allowed him to tke waythe illof adin beorehe deposited the accetanc 'wth tem, he harg mae against D)oberty was that he had not in either case sold the goods to Messrs. Bingham, that by means of a false pretence he had .old the goods to Messrs. Bingham-and that he obtained the bill of lading from the bank. That transDation bore also upon the next one; for it appeared that, having made that false pretence to the bank, the bills had gone down to Messrs. Bingham to be accepted; and no goods having been Bold to them-not having received any bills of lading, because Mr. Doherty had not taken them, and, therefore, having no transaction of the sort with him-they naturally did not accept. The bills sent to them by the bank remained with them; and, after a while, the bauk not getting them again, sent for Mr. Doherty. Mr. Doherty went to the bank; a conversation ensued; and the necessity existed for Mr. Doherty to get the acceptance of Messrs. Bingham. Mr. Doherty went down to the Mlessrs. Bingham, and had an interview with them, and he told them that he wanted their acceptance to two biUls for 1,2501. and 1,7001. respectively, these being the amounts for which he bad authorized the Borough Bank to send down his bUls to them. Messrs. Bingham, baving had no transactions with him of the sort he had stated, wanted some security. He offered several securities; there was a bill, not worth much, an acceptance of somebody else's; and also a small bil of lading which was totaly inadequate to the amount for which he wanted to give them security. There was also a I small balance in their hands due to him, all of which went partially to make up the security. But the anbstantial sort of security which he offered them was a bill of lading of 1,500 barrels of flour, per the Centurion. He produced it n the ordinary way, and offered it with the other securitise Tbeytookit, relying upon Mr. Doherty's honour, never doubting for a moment it was a good security to the extent of the value of the flour. Now, the jury would be aware with regard to biUs of lading that when the goods were put on board a shi abroad the captainput his hand to several bils of lading; *ut after one was used the others became void and useless. Naturally, therefore, when one commercial man offered to another a bil of lading for security the understanding was that such bill of lading was the first of the set-that no other bllU of lading of that lot had been made use of, at all events with the knowledge of the party who offered it. Therefore, the mnere fact .of offerIng a bill of lading as security was a pretence that it was a good security, and that no other bill of lading of that set had been used. Mr. Doherty in that way pretended to Messrs. Bingham that his biU of lading was a good security. This transaction took place on the 13th of May. True, the Cventurion was expected to come in, and it did comae in, in about a fortnight; and therefore something might be said about the improbability of Mr. Doherty making this false pretence when he expected the ship so soon. .iSow, some time after that Mr. Doherty had occasion for a quarautee of the sameo nature. He had occasion to deposit with a respectable gentleman In this town something as security,with Mr. Hubback, extensively engaged in the corn trade. On the 6th of May, a week before the transaction with Messrs. Bingham, Mr. Doherty wrote to Mr. Hubback as foUows:- "MaYf S.867. ' Dear 81r,-Encdesd yen have he bills ot ladincg as arranged. You will much obWiga me by puttng yOnr nlame en the enclowsa draught, as I reoniso it this evening to send to London. I hope you wil not dIwpreins mne. I ascerafined a: your offios wvhere you blad gone, and I take the hbertyot sendlnegthis to you. Aopyof othe biU has been taken at the office,.ro that ali that i, reqolsed is your name. "Vr gthol ours. " JOIS DOUERTY." He enosed one of the bhis of lading for the Centurion; acd the nature of that tran~sction was the deposit of that bill of lading as security for a large sum of money-so large a sutr. as to make the second bill of lading practically, as well as legally, of no value whitever. Something might be said about some possible mistake on tha part of Mr, Doherty. In the first place, he (Mr. Aspinall) should ask them to look at the extreme improbability of'such a state of things. Did they think: it possible Ma'. Doherty, under such circumstances could be unaware 'he had received from Mr. Rubback.aready large-advances on one bil of lading, and have so large a sum as to cover the second bll?1 It might be said there was some mistake as to the bill of lading to which, that did relate. Be thotjld be able to rove conversations with Mr. Bubbacka,AdI&r. Biugham,'ohowing, beyond all doubt, that the niotetioi; in both cases was to offer the same goods as.- ,security. Upon this bill of lading being offered to Messts. Bibgham, they consented to accept the two draughts dxawn by Mr. Doherty 'upon them, which vere tendered 4o'them by 'in He had obtained them from the Borough Bank, and- the result was, not that the bills were given rback to Mr. Doherty, bgte sent by Messrs. Bingham's clerk to the Borough Bank. These were the facts. With zeferenrce to the second transaction, he charged Mr. Doherty, by meanEs of falsely pretending to Messrs. Bingham that this till Of lading was aiailable security, and that no bill of lading of the same sot had been used so as to make it uEeless-that by means of that false pretence, which was made in fact (it -was not necessary it should be made in words), he indutced Messrs. Bingham to accept those bills of exchange he then presented to them. The learned counsel stated that, with regard to the transactions with the Borough Bank, he could not say that the prosecution had received any hearty co-operation from the Borough Bank. He shoud, however, be able to prove the letters, and Messrs. Bingham would prove that the representations made to them-were false, butthe prosecution were unable to produce Mr. Smith; therefore he could only rest upon the pretence and Its falsehood, and that the biUs of lading were after that received by Mr. Doherty from the Borongh Bank. It wrae only by his, Smith's, authority that tho bills of lading could be delivered up, but the prosecution could not prove the cause wrhich operated on the mind o.f that gentleman. The JUDGE.-Surely there is no dlfflculty in getting at Mr. ASPINALL-My lord, we have tried in vain. We have left the subpcona in every direction. The learned oounsel then clled bls lordship's attention to a late case of the "Queen v. Danger," 7th Cox, C.C., ,page 303. In that case the Court, of Criminal Appeal had declred that, although it was an offence beyond al doubt under the statute to obtain by means of false pretences any money, goods, or valuable securities from another person, yet that it was not an offence within the statute by means of false pretedces to obtain a person to accept a bill of exchange presented to him. The statute, no doubt, meant that to constitute an offence a man must obtain from another a security which was in his hands beforehand, and which was his property. Now, that was the state of the law, to which they must all bow, however mnuch it might be to be regretted that such a state of things should exist. Hle confessed he had considered the matter a great deal, and had bad the greatest possible difiiculty in secing a distnction between the present case and that, It was, supposing that the bills had been handed baick to Doherty, and that they bad previously been endorsed by him to the Borough Bank, and were the property of the bank at that time, he might therefore be said to have obtained a valuable security which was the property of the Borough Bank. The bills, however, were nover delivered to him after acceptance; al done b him was that by means of false pretences he in. duced Hfesrs. Bingham and Co. to accept the bills, and they were then sent by Messrs BinghamandCo.backto the Borough Bank. His LoRDsrP.-Then they nover were in his hands at all ? Mr. AsPnTArsT-No, my lord, not after their acceptance. His LORDsnrp.-Well, beforo they were acceptd they were of no use. Mr. AsnuI.tn-Ee brings them down to Messrs. Bing. ham and Co., and there offes them, of course having a very great interest in getting an acceptance, and induces Messrs. Bigjham and Co. to accept the bills, and they were then sent back to the bank, I confess myself, however deplorable such an anomaly may be, that there is no distinction between this case and that of "The Queen v. Danger." The JUDGE;.-This case seems rather afortioi, because in that case the bill of exchange after the acceptance was delivered back to the person who brought it. It was held in that case, although the biUl was in his hands, and obtained by a false pretence, that the statute did not apply, because the instrument when handed to the prisoner, was of no value to any one but to himself, In your case the bill never goes into the prisoner's hands at alL If that is so I don't see how you can maintain your ground. Unless you have Mr. Smith you cannot prove the false pretence. That is your first diffilculty. Mr. ASPBLNAI..-We can prove the false pretence, but we cannot prove that it was that which induced him to part with the bil of lading, so that it is the same thing. His LORDsrIp.-That is the essence of it; that any false pretence was made to him which induced Mr. Smith to part with the bills of lading. Then if you caunot preduce Mr. Smith you have no evidence of that. With respect to the rest, that is an a fortiori case. That being so, it is clearly occupying the time of the jury to no purpose. The defendant was then acquitted.
CENTRAL CAIZIINAL COURT, Dec. 14. The December session of the Central Criminal Court was opened this morning before the Right Hon. Sir R. W. Carden, Lord Mayor; hr. Russell Gurney, Q.C., Recorder; Aldermen Slr C. Marshall, Farncomb, Sir F. G. Moon, and Hale; Mr. Alderman and Sheriff Lawrence, Mr. Sheriff Allen Mr Under-Sheriff Millard, and Mr. Under-Sheriff Parier, &c. It appears from the first edition of the calendar that there are only 56 prisoners for trial at the present session. This is owing to the short period that has elapsed since the ad'ournment of the court. The RECORtDER in his charge to the grand jury eaid, that he was very glad to Inform them that there were fewer prisoners for trial at this session than he ever remembered, andthe cases also were, generally, of the ordinary description. There were two cases involving the destruction of human lSte, one of which was a charge of murder, and the other one of manslaughter. The first was the case of a foreigner who was charged with the murder of a police. officer named Thain, who had taken him into custody for felony. It appeared from the depositions that Thain was the oDly person present when the act was committed, and his deposition would be laid before them, that course being permitted by a recent Act of Parliament. The charge would not, however, rest upon this alone, but there would also be the testimony of other witnesses as to statements made by the prisoner himself, that would leave no doubt that the prisoner's was the hand that infiicted the injury which was the cause of death, and It would be their duty, if these facts wero made out, to put the case into a train to undergo further inquiry. The charge of manslaughter was against a woman who was accused of causing the death of her child by neglect. It appeared by the evidence that was taken before the coroner that the child had died of a disease that was brought on by starvation, and the questions the grand jury would have to consider were-first, whether the prisoner was proved to have had the means to provide for her child; secondly, whether she neglected to do so ; and thirdly, whether this neglect was satisfactorily made out to be the cause of death; and it all theie wero estblished by the evidence it would then be their duty to find a true bilL The learned Recorder concluded by stating that he did not think there were any other cases that were likely to present any difficulties to gentlemen of their experience, and he should at once, therefore, remit them to the performance of their duties. John Grace Leveridge, who was convicted of forgery at the November session, and upon whom judgment was respited, was brought up o receive sentence. The prisoner, it wil be nemembered, was employed In a confidential capacity by a wine merchant named Oldham. abd he was tried upon two indictments for forgery, and acquitted upoR one of tbem. The offence of which he was convicted was that of filling up a check for a very much larger sum than he was authorized to do by his master, and he afterwards appropriated the proceeds to his own purposes. The RECOIDtn gald, that the prisoner had been convicted of a very serious ofifence, and he had respited the sentence in order that he might have an opportunity of ascertaining from thelearnedjudge who hadtriedhim uponthe other charge whether there were any mitigating circumstances in con. nexion with that charge, and he was sorry to say that he had discovered that none auch existed. He had been recommended to mercy by the jury, and also by his master, and that waould be taken into consideration ; but this offence was of too serious a character to be passed over by any sentence of mere imprisonment, and he was compelled to order him to be kept in penal servitude for four years. Rtobert Buckland, a respectable-looking young man, surrendered to take is trial upen a charge of malicionsly and feloniously setting fire to a riok of hay, the property of F'rancis Gurney. Mr. Cooper conducted the prosecution; the prisoner sas de fended bly Mz Ribton. The proseoutor in this case is a farmer living at Northold, In the neighbourhood of Uxbrldge, and it appeared that the prisoner hadbeen in his service as horsekeeper, but was discharged a twelveuionth ago. The fre that was the subject of fiquiry took place on the 7th of November last, and the principal evidence against the prisoner were the facts, that he was the first person who gave the alarm of fnre, and that footsteps wvhich corresponded with his shoes were traced from the cottage where he lived to the stack that was set on fire, in addition to which, it appeared that when the prisoner was discharged he had made use of some threat that he would be revenged on his master. It appeared, however, that the prisoner did not deny that, he had gone from his cottage to the prosecutor's preises on the night of the fire, and that he had from the first declared that he was inocent of cuigt,andhd voluntarily offered his The jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty, Thomas Bateman, 16, a well-dressed, innocent-looking lad, pleaded " Guilty" to a charge of robbing a lady of a purse containing 7s. The RECORIiD put some questions to the police-constable engaged in the case, and ascertained that the prisoner was a well-known member of the juvenile swell mob, and that it was his practice to frequent the public thorough. Wee of the nietropolis ia company with another lad about his own age for the purpose of picldng pockets, and a well dressed old woman generally followled them to assist, If necessary, in those operations. The prisoner had it appeared once before been ia custody, but had never been convicted. He was sentenced to 12 months' hard labour. Henry Watts, 24, and Alfred Lee, 20, pleaded " Guilty" to the charges of burglary and stealing a coat and other articles, the property of John Cheppell. The prisoner Lee was then charged upon three other indictments, jointly with a woman named Emily Cox, with an offence of the same character Lee at first pleaded "Guilty" to the whole of these charges, but he subsequently retracte& those pleas upon the ground, as he said, that Watts, the man who had before pleaded gaulty, had been concerned in the whole of the robberies as well as himself. and he thought it very hard that he shbuld suffer for " the whole lot." Two of the cases were then taken, and it was provfd that almost immediately after the robberies had beeca committed the prisoners -were found in possession of considerable portions of the stolen property, and that the woman had pledged some of the articles in an assumed wame. The jury in both cases convicted the prisoners, Lee of stealing, and Cox of receiving the property knowing It to have been stolen, The whole of the prfioners were then called up for judgment, and an officer informed the Court that Watts ohad been twice before summarily convicted, and that Leo was a well-knowna bad eh,aracter. He had been hlrought uinthe union woerkhouse, and had passed the greater part of his life either in the nion or a prison, an.d had been no less than 10 times, convicted of dfferent offences. The RECORaDEB sentenced Lee to be kept in penal servitude for six years, Watts to be kept to hard labour for two years, and Cox to the same punishucent for one year. NTEW COURT. (Before aehe commsot5RixAmr.) Moses Solomons and John Myers, two respectably dressed Jews, surrendered to take their trial for havmngstolen2,000 labels, valued at 41,, the property of Philip Summers. Mr.Caarten prosecuted; and Mr. libton and Mr.I411ey defended. The prosecutor is a manufacturer of labels, living in Tabernacle-walk, and upon the 26th of November the paroel which contained the labels was stolen from a track upon its way to the carriers. Upon the 30th of the same month the prisoner Solomaons called upon a Mr. Solly, and offered some of the stolen labels as a sample of the lot at a low price, Mr. Solly having had some previous communication from the prosecutor told Solomons to call again and bring the goods, which he did, and a constable being present questioned him as to his possession of them, and he said he had bought them of Myers, to whom he at once took the officer. Myers admitted having sold them to Solomons for 1, he having bought them for 5s. upon the same night as the robbery of some one in Petticoat-lane. Subsequent iniry proved that the story was true, pnd that there had not been any attempt at concealment upon the part of the prisoners, both of whom bore good characters. The jury Acquied them.
POLICE. MANSIOnN-IOUSE.-John Palnteston, who has been several times remanded uapon the chargo of firing off a pistol on Fish-streetm-hill about a fortnight since, and of having inhbis possession, when seakched at the station-house, a sis-bar. relled revolver, five of the chAmbers of which were loaded with bullets and capped, And several skeleton-keys of first. rate manufacture, was again brought before tho LORD AfAyoR for further examination. Mr. Wontuer agaln attended for the prisoner. The chief constable of the Shrewsbury police produced a warrant for the apprehension of the prisoner, signed by Mx. Thomas Woodwara, a magistrate of that borough. Matha Meredith said,-I live at Claremont-hill, Shrews. bury. Some time ago a robbery was committed at Mr. Evans's, at Shrewsbury. I then lived at Mr Barrett's, and the prisoner and another man named Craddock lodged there. I know the prisoner to be the man mentioned in the warrant as John Palmerston. The LORD MAYOR upon this evidence endorsed the warrant, In ozder that the offioer might convey the prisoner to Shrewsbury to answer the charge of burglary at the house of Mr. Evans. Prisoner.-Why should I be kept in custody? Neither the constable nor the other witness knows anything about me. The LORD MAYOR.-They say they do. That will bo a mnatter for the justices to determine at Shrewsbury. Prlsoner.-Ask them how they got to know me. The LORD MAYOB.-That is not the question here. It Is sufficie-Dt for me to be convinced that they do know you. The constable willtake to Shrewsbury tho revolver, skeleton keys, and other articles found onyour person. Mr. Wontner.-The police have taken away his spectacles; may he have them restored to him ? The LORD MAYO0.-He may perhaps be as well without them as with them. He may, in all probability, be reoognized by people in Shrewsbury when the speotacles are put on him Perhaps he wore them when he committed the burglary. The spectacles must be taken with the other articles to Shrewsbury. The prisoner was then formally given into the custody of 'she Chief Constable of Shrewsbury, the Lord Mayor advising the latter to bave plenty of assistance, with a view to pre. vent either escape or personal violence on the journey. Frank Valentine Saunders, a tide-waiter, was charged with having assaulted Mr. D. S. Harding, inspector-general of the watergnard of the Custom-house. The complainant said,-I was alone in my office at the Custom-house on Saturday aftornoon, when the defendant entered ib and gave me two or three blows with his fist on the left side of the head. He then seized me by the back of my coat, and struck me several other blows. I called for help, and several persons came in and secured him. I have been compelled to have medical advioe on account of the blows I received. Iam exoeedingly deaf on account of the swollen state of my left ear, and have been obliged to put a poultice on my head. The defendant had previously been requested by me to attend at the office and explain the circumstances of a complaint which had been made against him. I had inquired into that complaint, and found that the charge against him had not been proved, and I told him that I should therefore not let the matter go any further. He had been accused of not keeping his watch, and he insisted that he had not beea caught. He went away, but. returned in a noisy manner. I again sent him away, but he subsequently returned and asked me if I would grant hirn another investigation. I told him I would on Ionday. EHe left me apparently satisfied, and I saw no more of him tlll be assaulted me. J. G. Dale, a Custom-house waterman, said,-About a quarter past 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon the complainant requested me to turn the defendant out of his office. The latter sWid he would not go out. He left but returned in about 10 minutes and entered the complainant's office. I heard the complainant calling out " Murder !" and ran inside, when I found the defendant striking him about the head with one fist, and holding him by the collar with the other. The defendant, in answer to the charge, said he went into the office for the purpose of speaking to the complainafit, when that gentleman raot only refused to listen to him, but ordered him to leave. As he would not go out at once the complainant tried to turn him out, when a scuffle took place, and " Murder 1" was called. The complainant contradicted this statement. The LORD MAYoR.-This is a very serious charge, although you appear to treat It very lightly. (To the complainant)-I suppose you have a great many men under you ? Uomplainant'-I have between 800 and 900 men under me. The LORD MAYOR.-If I dealt with this case summarily the greatest punishment I could inflict would be a penalty of 5, which I consider quite inadequate to meet the justice of the case. This isa very serious offence committed against a public officer, and It is my duty to send the case to the sessons for trial. The prisoner was then fully committed for trial, but was told he miht be liberatd on procuring two s=reties in 10. each for his attendanceat the Central Criminal Court. A diminutive Lasc named Osgar was charged with being concerned with another man not in custody in stealing 18 silk handkerchiefs, of the value of 5&, belonging to MJr. J. Bowden, a haberdasher In Gracechurch-street. The prisoner was remanded, it being stated that a great many other charges of a similar nature would be brought against him.

LMmEmnnx.An inquiry has boeen going on respeting a savag(e assult committed on the person of a most respectable gentleman in the district of this court at a quarter to 1 o'clock on Saturday morning last. It appears that up to 12 o'clock on 'FridaLy night the gentleman' was engaged in his duties, andl at that hour, as 'had been his custom, started from Up~ neigbouhoodof lackrlas toproeedto his residenc inCheser-tree Keningen.In walking along the Vauxalkrad, nd boe o th turingthat leads into Wabot-suar, h paseda plic-costale,272A, to whom h badea "God nigt," ad proeededat his an when about 400 yards from his residence, ho was fotud lyiug on the pavement bleeding profusely from the forehead, nd a quantity of blood was on the Rlags where he lay. Some person calUed the attention of Police-constablo 46 L, who was on the opposite side of the road, to him, and that officer, with the assltan of a bystander, raised him from the gronnd, and by this time Constable 272 came up. Both officers assisted him to his residence, when he was enabled to lot himself in and go to bed; but the following morniug he was found to be in so frightful a state that two medical gentlemen were sent for and were promptly in attendance Un examining the sufferer both gentlemen were decidedly of opinion that he must have received a desae. rate blow on the right temple with some wvoodn ingtrument, so construoted as to lap over, and not ouly to3 infit a wound on the temple, but a serious injury to the bridge of the nose, so that his life is placed in immlinent danger. It was also their belief that had the instrument been metallic instantaneous death must have been the consequenoe. When sufficiently restored to oonsciousness the sufferer stated that the last thing he recollected was two men following him from near the entrance to Walcot-square, the one a rather short and tho other a taller man, their coming up to hira, and the former laying hold of his cloak and left arm, while the latter struck him a desperato blow on the right side of his head. He had not the slightest recollection how be got home or got to bed, hut supposed he must have done so mechanically.

MILITARY AND NAVAL XETELLIGBNOB. The European and American Steam'Navigation Compan-y'E splendid ship Argo, Captain Benson, will receive her troops this day alongside Portsmouth Dockyard jetty. Captain Boeson had barely oight clear working days to metamorphose the Argo from a first-olass Transatlantic passenger-packet into a Goverament troop-transport, rendering necessary an entire revolation in the whole interior of the ship except the state saloon. This has been done in an able and masterly manner. The Argo Is an iron ship, of 2,249 tons borden, 300-horse (screw) power, and the height betweea decks is 7 feet 2 inches. She prepared for berthing 850 troops and about 50 officers, but now her orders are those which we published yesterday, making her numbers 100 short of the above. Eer ventilation is unequalled. She has 68 port holes or scuttles on the troop deck, which is a clean sweep of space fore and aft, uninterruptedly presenting a line of benches and hammocks like a vista of stalls, She has also l1 ventilating shafts and a number of rotary ventilators in various parts of her, rendering the below berths as cool as the saloon deck. She is a good sailer, having Cunningham's patent self-reefing topsalls and every other modern improvement; she steams on an average nine knots, and only consumes about 35 tons of coal per diem. It Is estimated with such advantages, and most experienced officers, she must make at least as good a passage out to India as the Company's other steamer, the Golden Fleece. She will sail to-morrow. A general court-martial, composed of officers of the Grenadier Guards, the Royal Artillery, and Royal Marines, held their sittings during the greater part of last week at Woolwich for the trial of an unusual number of prisoners, principally recruits, recently enlistedin the Royal Artillery, Three of the prisoners, convicted of crimes in breach of the articles of war-namely, insubordinate conduct to the noncommissioned officers-having been condemned to the punishment of the lash, underwent their sentence yesterday xmorning in the presence of the entire regiment, each recelving 50 lashes. One of the men, a Scotch. mnan, gunner of the Horse Artillery, having undergone his sentence, exclaimed in an agitated and incensed tone, 11" l never die happy till I seek revenge on the man who brought me to this." The second rwas a gunner belong. lng to the field batteries, and the Ihird a private of the 10th Battalion, each of whom was sentenced on leaving the Infirmary to undergo a term of imprisonment in Fort Clarence. On leaving the place of panishment the troops were marched to the west square, where they were ad. dressed by the General commanding the garrison, who re. marked on the spectacle to which they had all been wit. nesses, "that, however painful to his feelings, -he -was resolved to visit with the utmost severity acts of insubordination, without which the discipline of the service could not be maintained. "The authority of the non-commissioned officer," added the General, "must ba upheld, and I am happy to find that, in reference to the part they have acted towards the priseners under punishmeat, they have strictly performed a severe portioa of their duty. In all such cases the law must be carried out." The General then aluded to some cases of desertion. In one ease, after accepting the Queen's bounty, the man had de. serted with his kit, 'which having disposed of, he had enlisted in a regiment of the [Line, and had subsequently been detected. Now, to prevent the double crime of per. jury and robbery, he was determined that every man found guilty as a deserter should be branded with the letter D, which would be a check to such practices, although, as an existing regulation, It had not been carried out of late. A detachment of 60 gunners of the Royal Axtillery, volunteers from the 14th battalion, were yesterday morning Felected on parade, and ordered to hold themselves in readiness for service In Indla. The 2d battalion of the 6th Foot, raised at the expense of Major Macleod Frazer, who has obtained a lieutenant. coloneley and the command of the battalion for his exertions, nambers at present 1,230 strong, and in addition has given a large nunmber of volunteers to the 7th Fusileers and other regiments. The coloneloy of the 3d Regiment of Foot (the Buffs) has become vacant by the demise of Lieutenant-General Nathaniel Wodehouse, who died on Friday last at his residence at Sonning, Berks. The gallant officer entered the army in June, 1807, embarked with his regi. ment for Portugal in May the following year, and remained in the Peninsula until December, 1811, durlng which time he was present at the battle of Vimniera, the cam. paign from Lisbon to Oporto, and the battles of Bueaco and Fuentes d'Onor. The deceased General also served in the campaign of 1814 in the south of France, including the affalr at Tarbes and the battle of Toulouse. He had received the slver war-medal and four clasps for his services in the Peninsula. At the close of last January the gallant General sacceeded to the colonelcy of the 3d Regiment, in the room of General N. Thorn. His commissions were dated as follows:-Ensign, 3d June, 1807; Lieutenant, 31st August 1807; Captain, 20th September, 1811; Major, 18th October, 1821; Lieutenant-Colonel,2d September, 1824; Colonel,28th June, 1838; Major-General, 11th November, 1851; and .leutenan t General, 5th September, 1857. By the maU from India the death of Colonel Thomas Sid. ney Powell, O.B., who recently succeeded Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, K.C.B., in the command of the 53d Regiment, is confirmed as having taken place in an action with a body of the Dinapore mutineers near Futtehpore. Tho lamented officer had had a long and distinguished career In India, and during the late war wa rocalled from India to act in the Crimea, where he rendered himself highly ueeful, and for his meritorious exertions in the field was early in last year nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Colonel Powell entered the army as :Ensign by purchase in May, 1826, and, as may be imagined, when cut off was in the fuU vigour of life. He served as Aide-de-Camp and Persian Interpreter to General Lord Reane throughout the campaign of 1838 and 1839 in Affghanistan, and had re. ceived a medal for Ghuznee. He accompanied the 6th Regiment to the Cape of Good Hope, and served during the Caffre war in 1846 and 1847, for which he received a medal. Dturing the late war in the Crimea he commanded the 57th Regiment until after the battle of Inkermann, and sub. sequently served as second in command of theregiment until promoted to an unattached lieutenant- colonelcy. He had recelved the Crimean medal and lasps for Balaklava and Inkermann. Soon after the war with Russia was con. eluded Colonel Powell returned to India to share the honours of the military operations against Persia. Since the outbreak In the Bengal presidency the gallant officer had displayed -the greatest activity and zeal in his duties, and his death will be deeply regretted, not only by his relatives, but by a 1ar]e circle of military friends. Colonel Powell was an excellent Persian and Oriental scholar. The following are the dates of his commission :-Bnsign, May 13, 1826 ; IAeutenant, May 31, 1831 ; Captain, November 13, 1835; Brevet i!ajor, July 23, 1839; Major, July 21, 1848; Brevet-LIeu-enanttColonel, Novemberli, 1851; and Lieatenant-Colonel, YFebruary 2, 1855. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- Lieutenant J. W. Webb, to the Cambrian; Lieutenant H:. l. Miller, to the Lapwing; George W, J. Aldham, Acting Mate, to the Renown, TEIE MILITIA. The Royal flbhorne Light Infantry, under the command -of Lieutenant. Colonel Murray Prior, was inspected at Cork on Friday by Major-General Eden, on which occasion the General expresed4ilmEelf in high terms as to the appear. ance of the men, thelr discipline, &c. The Royal Aberdeenshire Militia marched into Island. bridge Barracks, lsublin, on Saturday morning, having crossed from Liverpcol the previous night. The route reached Aberdeen by telegraph at 8 p.m. on Thursday, December 10, and, altIough wcattered in billets, the regiment was paraded at 2 a.m., nd ieft at 3 nu,n. for Carlisle.

THE CAMPAIGN IN INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Here we are at the orthodox date for the "commemcement of active operations," and we stand not so badly. At last we have effected a passage through the enemy's country; troops from above and troops from below have formed a junction, but under what most strange circumstances ! In all these rmonths our troops have bravely battled in expectation of English aid, and constant have been the assurancers that forces were marching up to assist in the capture of Delhi; but what is now the fact? Simply this, that a Punjab force has crossed the Ganges to relieve Her Majesty's China expedition besieged in Lucknow, and reduced to nearly the last extremity. Yer, so it is. Every man of the moveable column which has pased Cawnpore comes from the Punjab terrltory-somewbat less than half are Europeans from the Punjab stations, from Sealcote to umballa; and somewhat more than half native Punjabees; and as to Havelock, the truth is this, that having got into Lucknow and relieved the aching hearts there, he can't get out again; but, on the contrary, is eating up, in company with them, their store of provisions, insomuch that he and they together are living on the gun-bullocks, as is officially admitted -on horses, as private stories go- and it is announced that the latest day to which they can hold out on these provisions and the little flour they have is the 10th inst. Havelock is very much in the position of a rat in a trap. As soon as he got in the canal bridge was blown up behind him, and he was surrounded and cut off from all communication. There he has been ever since, quite safe so long as provisions last, but otherwise apparently helpless. The position taken up within the city, where it is impossible to get out or in without a mile and a half of street fighting, appears a bad one. Strange to say, the depOt left outside at Alumbagh with all the baggage and camp followers has never been seriously attacked; and, though the want of provisions there was at one time frightful, no difficulty has been found in sending so far convoys of provisions with comparatively small parties, and Alumbagh is now well provisioned and strongly garrisoned. It is thence to the Baillee Guard that the communication has been altogether Interrupted since the 26th of September. Of the China regiments, the 5th and 90th are with Havelock, and the others are being rapidly pushed up country. A magnificent regiment, the 93d, has in fact nearly all reached Cawnpore, and will, Ihope, join ina body the relieving column; add detachments of various regiments at Cawnpore and the force at Alumbagb, now about 1,000 strong, and altogether the force now going to relieve Lucknow for about the fifth time wil be very strong. Captain Peel and his naval brigade have gone up towards Cawnpore. Before the lOtb, then, there may probably be before or in Lucknow-say, moveable column nearly 3,000 strong; fresh Europeans from Cawnpore and below, not less than 500; force already at Alumbagh, 1,000 ; total, 5,500; including about 3,000 European infantry and a very large artillery. H[avelook has about 1,000 serviceable men of those whom he brought with him, and 400 and odd whom he found there-say total, 1,500. Thus, then, about 7,000 men are available for the conquest of Lucknow. I was going to complain that, while from the Punjab we relieve the China expedition, nearly six months after the outbreak not one man from England has yet come to our aid; but I am mistaken, this moruing one man has arrived, and the guns announce that man to be Sir Colin Campbell. He pushes on, and there 'will be some reciprocity. If the Punjab columnm is, in difficulties Sir Colin, himself an army, will relieve it. In fact, I fancy there can be no doubt that it will be by the Commanderln-Chief in person that Lucknow will be at last really relieved. Sir Colin is a brusque and lively old gentleman-athorough soldier, I have no doubt; and I confess that, for military comumand In these times, I believe that he is far preferable to any Sepoy officer. But his old antagonism to "the Lawrences"' and the civilians peeps out, and I fear that, acting in our own territories, and in a kind of civil war, his determination not to be guided by civilians may, If pushed to an extreme, be very inconvenient and deleterious. A regular war is one thing; the settlement of a country swept by a hurricane another. The state of things in Oude requires some explanation. There we encounter not only a military, but, perhaps stil worse, a native opposition-quite a different state of things from anything we have had at Delhi or elsewhere, and it has come about in this wise. The old zemindaree question, so hotly contested ever since Lord Cornwallis's time, is, in fact, revived. Throughout a great portion of the cotuntry we found superior holders-some say proprietors, some say merely hereditary farmers, but at any rate, hereditary middlemen-holding large tracts between Government and the cultivating communities, and responsible for the revenue in 33engal., as we know, they were generally recogni;ed as proprietors, and the rights of the subholders were reduced to nil. In the Niorth-West Provinces they were generaUy set aside, but even to the present day there has been no more fertile source of argument and litigation than the rights of some of the most prominent of these "talookdars," as we call them. Some have obtained decrees against Government in the civil courts, and many receive a percentage in compromise of their rights, or alleged rights. Now, in Oude this "talookdaree" system was particularly strong. Almost the whole country was parcelled out among great talookdars or zemindars, and, though under a Mahomedan Government, these men werealmost universallyHlindoos-in fact, native chiefs; certainly more than mere farmers-and they had obtained great prescription, exercised great power and authority, and were, in fact, the feudatories (and very often the rebelious feudatories) of the Govermment. They had their own forts, aud troops, and guns. Under this system the viUage proprietory rights no doubt became much more undefined, weak, and uncertain than where the villagers hold direct of Government, and, disused and precarious, those rights were sometimes little remembered or valued. Here, then, when we took possession, was a very puzzling question. With whom was the settlement to be made? The talookdars were strong and in possession, the communities dormant, broken, ill-defined. It muat take some time to suppress the one and resuscitate the other. But revenue opinion in the North-West Provinces has long run very strongly in favour of viUage proprietors ; still stronger must it be, in the Punjab, where there is no doubt about the matter, and Ouide was principally managed by officers from those provinces. I know no particulars myself, but I understand that the general result of the settlement has been to oust the talookdars and make direct village settlements. Then immediately followed the rebellion. At first the talookdars behaved well to us personally. They are men of honour in their way; with the butchery of a rabble they have no sympathy; to protect all who seek their protection is with them a point of honour. By none have so ,many European lives been saved as by these men. But our government was altogether upset; no time had yet elapsed sufficient to destroy the strength of the talookdars or to enable the village proprietors to acquire strength in, or probably even any sufficient appreciation of, their rights; the talookdars almost universally resumed what they considered to be their own again, and seem to have met with popular support. Thus they became committed against Government, and, being committed, our severities at Allahabad and, Cawnpore led them to fear the worst. Till Havelock's final retreat from his last unsuccesaful attempt to relieve Lucknow they seem to have tried to temporize, but when Havelock recrossed the Ganges to Cawnpore, Awl it appeared that we had decidedly failed, the talookdars declared against us without reserve. Chief among them is Rajah Man Singh, and it is, in reality, a iSindoo confederacy. It is said that these meu and their followers are now the most numerous and promiuent of our opponents at Lucknow; that Man Singh Lloes not like the Sepoys, who won'tobey orders and are exceedinglyexpensive; and that he is for the most par.' besieging Havelock on his own account with 20,000' fo7lowers ; in fact, with all the warlike clans of O,tide at his back. Rumour has it that negotiations have been going on between him and Sir James Outram,. but 1 do not know if there is any truth in the report. At present we have certainly no friends in Oude. About Lucknow there must, however, be / very large aggregation of Sepoys. It has been the pt int to which have tended all the regiments which* d d not reach Delhi. Of the Delhi regimepts I do nob think that many will again show nmueh fight. Three brigades marched in a confused way down country, of which one stopped at Futtehghur atd two approached Cawnpore. Thenee they were driven bgfiby the Europeans in all unsatisfactbry, incom- plete kind of way; but the result, so far as could be learnt from native reports and opinions in their rear was their dispersion; and I believe that they wiiU go to their homes with their plunder. Most of them crossed over into Oude. The regiments which latterly mutinied in Bengal have been finding their way up to Banda, where tbey met the 50th and 52d, the latest mutineers of these parts; and they are now trying to find their way across into Oude-an object in which they will probably succeed; and, if they do, it will probably be the best result for all parties next to their destruction. In that case the country south of the Jumna wil become, in fact, pretty clear of mutineers of the Line; and the rebellion may gradually be reduced to defined limits. The Gwalior Contingent are still following a line of their own. They and the Banda aggregation of mutineers at one time threatened Cawnpore, but since the arrival of so many troops they have given that up. The Contingent has, howrever, moved from Gwalior, and left in possession there the Maharajah, who has at once Sent his Vakeel to Agra. The Contingent, with 41) guns and 800 carts of ammunition, are somewhera about Jaloun and Jhansi, and may try to set up an independent dynasty there. A Madras columnone regiment and a-half-with six guns, which have lately held Mirzapore, have now been ordered up to Cawapore, and it is hoped that Saugor will be occupied by a Bombay column. In Rajpootana things seem rather unquiet, and the political agent at Eotah has been murdered. Our hope, however, is that, if Sir C. Campbell is now strong enough to occupy Lucknow, the troops which daily arrive wil shortly form a force aufficient to march through Bundelcunld and defeat the Gwa- ior Contingent; and that, if nothing goes wrong in the meantime, we may then quiet Central India, throw the rebellion beyond the Ganges, and work it off at our leisure. The moveable column in its march from Agra to Cawnpore met with no serious opposition, and passed through, to all appearance, a very friendly and well cultivated country. Nothing is more surprising than the way in which, amid tne crash of empire, the people have this year not only cultivated, but, in many districts, cultivated almost as well and as extensively as ever. Once out of the Googar country, the rebels do not seem to have resumed to the ful the desolating habits of their ancestors, and perhaps plunder the people less than our troops now do; in fact, beyond supplying their necessities, the Sepoys have not generally ventured to assume the character of masters and tyrants of the country. The Mahomedan Nawab of Furruck. abad has established his rule in the Futtehghur district. We cut up his posts as we passed, and at one of them took three English guns left by the Delhi mutineers when they fled from Oawnpore. But the cry for aid to Lucknow was so great that it was determined not to attempt to occupy the country throughwhich we passed, and passing we have again abandoned it; so that, though a junction has been formed by the troops, the communications between the upper and lower country are not at aU re-established. From Agra to Cawnpore the road in quite closed. From Agra upwards and Cawnpore downwards it is open; but that there should still be a break is a very great subject of regret and of political weakness. And now all the China regiments having been despatched up the country, and the English ones arrived and arriving in Calcutta, the stream of fresh troops upwards is and, we hope, will be continuous. Almost every second day parties of Europeans of 200 or 300 arrive at and are pushed up from Allahabad. There is a railway for 40 miles, and the benefit of the Grand Trunk Road (by far the best road in the world), with its establishment of waggons and carrages, Is now enormous. Of all things connected with the rebellion the most wonderful, I may say incredible, is the very astonishing want of enterprise on the part of the mutineers. For long we used to fear aU kinds of surprises and attacks on outposts; now we rest in the most unprecedented confidence that it is not in them to do such things. If the mutineers, and especially the Irregular C-avalry, had shown the least activity and had harassed us by any kind of guerilla warfare, very different would have been our position. As it is, with aU Oude in a flame, parties of 250 men have been taking large convoys from Cawnpore to Alumbagh, and, though the Gzand Trunk Road from Calcutta to Benares has been long in the immediate neighbourhood of mutineers, and from Benares to Cawnpore runs, in fact, through an enemy's country, our communications have not once been even harassed, and the road is travelled as in days of yore. It would hardly be believed that in the whole lne from Delhi to Benares the enemy have not broken a single bridge, or in one place obstructed the road. I saw one bridge off which they had begun to shovel the metal, but the trouble had been too much, and they had given it up. I believo that the possession of so many guns has been a great misfortune to the rebels. As long as a native has a gun to stick to he is never to be seen in advance of it. If they so fight to the end they wiU now be contemptible enemies. We must only hope that they will not learn from defeat and change their tactics." As yet wo are by no means in possession of the districts from Benares to Cawnpore; in fact, we only hold the line of the Grand Trunk Road and its immediate neighbourhood, and for that we are entirely indebted to the supineness of the enemy. Whether in addition to the hostility of the Oude Talookdars we shall yet meet with anything like popular village opposition from the friends and relations of the Sepoys remaiusto be seen; but, certainly, when the cohmnm came into the Sepoy country of Cawnpore there were no signs of more hostility than elsewhere. Whatever popular opposition there is in our own older districts, besides the mere freebooting of the plundering tribes, may be traced almost exclusively to one great source of hostility, which has raised many people against us,-I mean the very general transfer of landed rights which has taken place under our system, especially by the action of the civll courts, and the unlimited and summary sale of landed rights in satisfaction of decrees. These transfers are for the most part mere paper transfers. The old proprietors still reside on the spot; most frequently in the character of tenants they retain the land; but by paper transfer in the collector's office their rights, dues, privileges, and emoluments are given to another, and there they are, discontented, angry men, still looking on themselves, and looked to by others, as the real proprietors, oppressed and in abeyance. We suddenly imposed without check a system to which the people were altogether strangers, and the consequence has been so general a transfer of landed rights as has, perhaps, never been known in any age or country. Well, our Government being to all intents and purposes overthrown and swept awayfromtheseprovinces, these old proprietors have, as a matter of course, resumed their own again. The auction purchaser disappears with our system just as much as our collectors of revenue and police officers do. No native would dream of supposing that this admitted of argument; but the result is that the old proprietors, the popular men, are committed to hostility to us. I hope that, under the circumstances, the past wiUl be treated indulgently. Of course, right or wrong, what has been doneby us must be reasserted; but Bsrely we must take warning-surely, we shall not thus rudely destroy the remaining tenures, and render hostile the remaining provinces. If the land of the Punjab had been transferred as that of the North-West Provinces, it is quite certain that we should not now be here; that we should hold nothing of India beyond the guns of our ships; we should neither have taken Delhi nor saved Allahabad. The Sikhs would have been against us to a man, and General Hlavelock would probably have been now defending Calcutta. I am too recent an arrival to know much of the politics of these parts, but one thing strikes me strongly, and that is the change in the state of things in regard to Sepoys as we get down country. Down to Cawnpore it was enough to ascertain that a man was a Sepoy; we should as soon have thought of sparing a mad dog, to inquire whether it could be proved that he had bit any one, as of sparing a Sepoy. The only question wai, Sepoy or no Sepoy-and many ingenious devices were resorted to, such as drawing the prisoners up in a line and suddenly shouting ". Attentiotn," when all who showed any signs of attention were carried off to the rear. But down here, to our horror and surprise, we see Sepoys of the old stamp coolly walking along the public roads in broad daylight, and I * If the surprise at Agra be considered an exception to te rebel want of enterprise, it must be understood that t. hey long tnnounced their intention to attack Aera, and at las t came iu regular course. The snmprise was due to our hav,.ng no one posted to look out for theirooming ; and, a3 to enter, ris&%it was one of the ponderous attuck4 wisb big guns WiLisgh tlhey 4o mometimea rake find that the Government seem to have taken them under their especial protection. I do not know the exact facts, but, so far as I can learn, every Sepoy about whom there can be any doubt whatever is not only to be spared, but to be recognized as a servant and child of Government, and all his vested rights, his pay, and his pension, and everything else, are to be guarded as scrapulously as if he were a church of England beneficed clergyman. All the men of the worst regiments who were on leave at the time of the outbreak, and have spent the last si months in the hostile districts, probably fighting against us, are now received back with open arms; and a special order of Government for the protection of Sepoy mutineers has been published. There is no protection for civil rebels, or alleged rebels, whose case in the de facto extinction of government Is very peculiar, and who in the excited state of the European mind are, I think, often judged by an unfairly harsh standard. No, all the- paternal care is for the Sepoys, and mutineers are not to be tried where arrested, but are all to be sent to Allahabad, and at Allahabad, unless proof of specific crime accompanies them, they are to be acquitted. Why this most injurious lenity? The whole Sepoy race has turned on us in the most diabolical way, and the only distinction is between those in open rebellion and those who have been disarmed and guarded by European bayonets. A middle course might have had advocates as long as any portion of the army stood. But how is the fact ? Why, that it has gone bodily and entirely. Then why hesitate to strike it off our rolls, and why spare Sepoys ? They are the only people for whom I would have no mercy, and it will be miserable indeed if Government even now yield to the influence of Sepoy officers and the principles of the old school. The work of retribution on the Sepoys has yet to come. Dispersed they to a great extent are, but their losses have been absurdly exaggerated. They have as yet suffered little more than fair enemies would in fair and not very conclusive fight. Retribution has yet to come; and England must not permit an Indian Government to interfere with the extermination of the Sepoy army, which, after all our care, has turned and rent us.

MUURDBR AND SUICIrD IN DRUMMOND- STRBE1r, XU.3TONSQUAP. It was yesterday discovered that a Frenchman had, at a late hour on the previous night, murdered his wire, and had afterwards committed xuicide, at a coffeehouee in which they had been lodging for upwards of a week, kept by a Mr. Harper, No. 38, Drummond.street, within a few doors of the railway station. The deceased man and his wife, apparently having just come off a r-ilwa&' journey, on the n4ht of the L&inst. inquired in a foregn accent if they could be accommodated with lodging;, and, being answered in the affirmative, they were shown into a room on the nrst floor, and supplied witti refreshments. They continued there afterwards, goiog out every day, returning at meal times, until Sunday last, having paid no money for anything with w=ch they had been supplied during their stay. About a quarter past 1 o'clock on Sunday afternoon, as the man and his wife -ere going out together, the waiter spoke to the man and asked him to disharge his bill, as it waa then up. -wards of 51. The man gave the waiter an evasive answer, upon which he called lr. Hrper, his master, who also made a request for his money. IUpon this the man said, X Oh, very well," and, together with his wife, returned to thelr room as if for the purpose of fetching the money. As they did not come down stair again Mr. Harper, soon after 10 o'clock at night, went up to the room and knocked at the door, but after repeatedly knocking and receiving no answer he spoke to the police upon the subject. Sergeant Bendall, 338, soon after arrived,and having obtained a strong iron bar broke open the door, when a most horrifying spectacle met his view. On the floor lay the rean and the woman with their throats cut, and weltering in a pool of blood. The woman was lying with her bead towards the bed, andtheman was lying across her. They had not been to bed, and both were dressed much as they were when seen by the landlord, and their clothes were not at all disturbed. The man's hand still clasped a razor, with which the fatal work had been committed. The woman must have been murdered some time before, as it appeared that after her husband had cut ber throat he had deliberately wiped the razor on a towel in the room. Some articles of clothing were also stained with blood as if a razor had been wiped upon them. Mr. Myern, a surgeon, of No. 30, Melton-street, Eustonsquare, attended almost immedtately but he declared both to be dead, and that life had been extinct for some time. The act on the part of the man must have been a] most deliberate one, as he had taken off his collar and stock and placed them upon the dressing-table. The most remarkable fact in the case is that all the persona in the house srero at home all the afternoon, and any noise overhead would readlly have been heard by them, yet during the whole period not the slightest unusal noise was heard to excite their suspicions. The property left In the room, among which are several articles of jewelry, has been examined, but nothing whatever was found to give any clte as to the Identity of the parties beyond the fact that they were natives of France. The man was about 5 feet 9 inches in height, had black hair, smaU black whiskers, and was dressed In a black frock coat with a velvet collar, black trousera, black velvet vest, and short Wellington boots. The woman was about 25 years of age. I feet 4 inches in height, brown hair, fair complexion, hazel eyes, black silk dress, open vrork white colLar, black sde lace cloth boots, white stockings, muslin sleevea, and black glass bracelets Information bas been forwarded to Mr. Wakley, the coroner, who will hold an inquest on the bodies.
THE LOSSES IN OUDE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Being painfnUy aware how dreadful suspense is, I now take utl my pen to convey as much news as I can, through your columns, of officers (friends of mine) vrho were with me either during the mutinies in Onde or with me previously. I was commanding a wing of Captain G. Boileau's regiment, the 2d Oude Irregular Infantry, in May last, at Baraitch, in Oude. I met there Charles Cnn=i- , of the civil service Lucas, a brother of an officer In our 47th; F. W. Jorjen, Acsistant Commissioner; Lieutenant and Mrs. 0. Greene, and Lieutenant LoDgueville Clarke, of the 3d Oude Regimaent. Cunliffe, Clarke, and Jorden were making their escape to Lucknow. In the night their horses were stolen, and they started on foot and were murdered by vilagers; Lucas was in Lucknow during the mutiny of the line regiments, but since then I have heard nothing of him. A report came in that he had been bitten in the arm by a horse during the night of the mutiny. After my return to my own station at Secrora a Sepoy came in and, with apparent glee, told us he bad heard that our friend Greene had been kiUed; - that he kied a number of rebels with his own hand, defending his wife and child, but what coulda Sahib do against numbers?' Of Mrs. Greene's fate no one knows; it Is to be hoped she mnay be among a number who possibly are concealed in Oude. No authentic account has yet arrived of the Seetapore massacre; from all accounts it Vas as foul as the others, my only Informant being this Sepoy, who said he heard many ladies had taken their children in their arm6, and had drowned thomselves in the river. Of the officers of the Onde force, those whom I know to be alive from the last acoounts, and those with whom I have been servIsg, I will mention. First, those who were my companious In ffight along the Nepaulese frontier-Captain C-eorge Boileau is with the Ghoorka force; Mfrs. George Boileau and three children were aliveon the 7th of October in Lucknow garrison; Captain Miles is also with the above force; Mr. Wingfield, C.S., the commissioner, is in Calcutta; Mr. Owen is at Benares; Dr. Kendall is at Cawnpore; Mrs. lKendall is alive in the Lucknow garrison; Dallas, Campbel, and I are Row on oar way home sick. Of my young wife and chUd suffice It to say that, thanks to God, they escaped the Sepoys' bayonets, leaving this world for a better in the Lucknow garrison. In like manner has been visited my friend Edgar Clarke, who likewise now is wifeless and childless. Poor Dr. Bartrumn was shot with the relieving force at Lucknow. He was at the Residencylgate, within300 yards of his wife, when he was shot dead. Warren of the 8th Native Infantry, Adjutant of the 12th Irregular Cavalry, was with us at the Ghoorka camp. He left us for Lucknow, and was kIlled in taking batteries on the second day. A finer fellow, and more beloved by his brother officers In and out of camp, never breathed. Captain Wemyss Smith Is alive and well with the Ghoorka force. Poor E. D. Lewis was shot in the knee when we were engaged at Azimghur, and died at Ghazepore. Quartermaster-Sergeant Gallagher, of the 2d, was marrled to a native woman. He refused to accompany us, being ill, and also saying he would sooner die than be ruined. The Sepoys of the 2d and 3d did not touch him when they marohed to besiege Lucknow, but two Sepoys of the 37th Native Infantry killed him afterwards. Sergeant-Major Court was not at Secrora when I left. I know nothing of him-whether he went with the Artillery sergeants or not. Lieutenant Bonham, of the Artillery, was turned out of his lines, and is alive in Lucknow. Of the force in vwhich I have of late been serving, Lieutenant-Colonel Wroughton is alive; also Captain Steele, Lieutenant Hay, 17th Native Infantry; Drs. C. Paske and T. P. Wright. I am, Sir, your obedient servant- (ZORGE HALE, we UAW lu oummina, zcL uacUe Irregalar infailtry. Clutta, Nov. 2.
THE LATE CAPTAIN MoNCl MASON OF JODHOR-E. -The untimelv death of Captain George Monck Mason, the late able and energetic British Resident at Jodhpore, inRajpootana, adds another to the many severe losses sustained by the Indian Governmuent in its staff of political servants. Captain Monck Mason, although Stin a young man, had already displayed so rare a combination of qualities, and in very dHificult and responsiblb situatUons performed services of so much importance as to give promise of a briliant future career. Wfhen a subordinate in the political department under the British Resident in Raipooran he distinguished himself by the daring bravery and indomitable energy which he displayed in the pursuit and capture of several dangerous and desperate robber-chlefs on the borders of Scinde. In these expeditions he was often accompanied by only a few sowars, and had to traverse vast tracts of barren and inhospitable country on camel-back, riding as much as 70 or SO miles within the 24 hours, and subsisting for days upon chupatties and coaree native arrack. Captain Monek Mason's services were rewarded by the appointment of political agent at Kerowlee, one of the Rajpoot States, which was bestowed upon him by Lord Dalhousie. At Kerowlee he remained about six years, and his performance of the difficult duties devolving upon him, at a time when that State was much disturbed in consequence of the death of the Raljah and subsequent disputed suc8ession, elidted the strongly expressed approval of Lord Dalhousie, and on more than one occasion procured for hir the vell merited honour of recOiving the thanks of " the Govemor-Generai in Council." Captain Monck Mason was the intimate and honoured friend of Sir Henry LAwrence, Whose affection and comusel he obtained early in his political career. Notwithstanding the disparity of years, in their characters there were many points of resemblance, and in both the mainspring of action vas unyielding devotion to duty. In March last Captain Mason was sent to succeed Sir Richmond Shakespear as Resident at Jodhpore. In the appointment of so young an officer to a post of great importance (Captain Mson was only 32) Lord Canning emphatically marked his high sense of the value and extent of Captain Mason's services to tho State. In consequence of the mautiny of the Jodhpore Legion in August last Captain Monck Mason was placed in a situation of fearful responsib}lity and danger. Many ladies and children had escAped to Jodhpore, and found a refuge within the hospitable walls of the lResidency. Captain Mason was able, by rapid and energetio measures, not only to provide for the sarety of the litte band of Europeans at Jodhpore, bat to despatch a body of men for the protection of the Sanitarium on Mount Aboo, to which place many fugitives had escaped. After having accomplished this, intelligence was received at .Todhoore of the approach of the small force under General George Lawrence, which was detained before the strong fort of Ahwa. Captain Masou persuaded the Rajah of Jodh. pore, whose attachment to himself, as well as fidelity to our Govermment had been established beyond a doubt, to despatch a small body of men to the assistance of General Lawrence. Captain Mason deemed it to be his duty to accompany this detachment. Persuasions and entreaties were powerless to withhold him from folowing the path of duty. On approaching the fort of Ahwa the party entered a thick and tangled jungle, impassable to cavary. The men accordingly halted, and their leader dismounting from his camel proceeded on foot, accompanied only by two servants, with the intention of mam g his way to the General's camp. It appears from the account given by the servants, that they had aot proceeded many hundred yards when they came upon a group of sowars whom they sup. posed to belong to General Lawrence's force. These mnpn offered to guide Captain Mason to the General's tent. He accepted the offer, but had proceeded onwards only a few yards, when two of the treacherous villains came up from behind and shot him dead. The sowars were muteneors, and were probably on their wAy to join the rebel force within the fort. Thus closed the earthly course of one who had already done good service to his oountry, and whose future career seemed so full of promise. The clesr testimony borne to his consistent and unassuming Chris. tian chbracter sheds a bright gleam over thisotherwi'e melmcholy gyent,
