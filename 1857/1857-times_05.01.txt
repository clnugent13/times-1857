VfO1Y.MABKkT and OITYXTZLLIGENO1P% Thursday Evening. The gloomy accounts from the Paris Bourso, toupled with the continuance of severe weather aid the uncertainty as to the movements that might be found necessary at the Bank of England, caused the iunds to open this morning with a languid appearance at a decline of an eighth. After the breakingnp of the Bank Court, however, without any fresh zrestrictions having been resolved upon, there was a dlight tendency to recovery, and, as. the supply of zoney in the Stock-Exchange was found sufficient for all the requirements connected with the settlemient of the foreign account, the market then remaained comparatively steady to the close. Consols for money were first quoted 924 to J. From this they went to 92k, and the last transactions were at 412 to Â§ for money, and 92j to i for the 7th of Pday. For the new account in June the final price 'was OSj to i. The announcement of the failure of a dealer in the share-market was made during the day. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 91i to i; New Three per Cents., 91i to f ; India Etock, 220 to 222; India Bonds, 10s. to 9s. disDount; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to i; and ExchequerbAlls (June), 6s. to 2s. discount; March, 2s. discount to 2e. premium. There was again considerable pressure in the discount-market and at the Bank of England, and there seems little prospect of any abatement of it until after the 4th of the month. As the Bank, however, during the last three weeks have limited their discounts for the bill brokers to paper having mot more than one month to run, and their advances on bills to 14 days, they have their resources in a ,great degree within command. Of the 2,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds to be paid o)ff to-morrow week 1,800,0001. are in the hands -of the Savings-banks Commissioners, and 200,0001. are aeld by public bodies. The mode of reinvestment of the amount to be paid off to the savings-banks wfil depend upon the Government arra3gements, ;nd nothing has transpired respecting them. The transfer books at the Bank will be closed tosnorrorw, the 1st of May, for the half-yearly balance, and it will be a holyday at the Stock-Exchange. In foreign securities there has been little activity, and prices were rather heavy at the close. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were purchased at 92i, i, @, and J, and for the account at 92t, f, and 4; the four per Cents. Guaranteed, 100; Brazilian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 98; Buenos Ayres, for account, 85; Mexican, for account, 23g ; Russian Small, 97; Spanish Three per Cents., 41i, 41, and 41i; the New Deferred, 25; Dutch Two-aild-a-Half per Cents., 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificnate, 97k. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Boursethisevening were 68f. 70c. fformoney and 6Sf. 86c. for the present account, showring a recovery of about a quarter per cent. It is stated that up to the present time there have Dbeen scarcely any English applications made to 3fessrs. Baring for the shares of the Russian railWay. The quotation nominaly remains at i to i premium. At Amsterdam, the market where Russian securities are most popular, they are extremely heavy at J premium. There is still an absence of gold withdrawals from the Bank. The 2U0,0001. brought by the Anglesey from Australia has not yet been delivered, but is expected to-morrow, when a portion, if not the 'whole, will be taken for exportation. A large sum may now be considered due from Australia, and if it shonld soon arrive much of it would probably be taken to the Bank. It is said that about 55,0001., sovereigns, are exSpected from the East during the next fortnight through the Ottoman Bank and the Bank of Egypt. Subjoined is a table of the fluctuations in the stock and share markets during the past month. The range of Consols has been rather greater thtan in the preceding month, but it has not exceeded 1Â§ per cent. The tendency of prices throughout has been almost entirely towards depression and a decine has been established of one per cent. In the share-market proportionate heaviness has prevalled, although the Brighton, Eastern Counties, and York and North Midland havd escaped its influence. During the month the bullion in the 13ank has stood at a point lower than at any time since 1847, and the rate of discount has been raised one-half per cent, while other restrictions have also Pbeen adopted:- On tite continental bourses during the month the mnovements, with the exception of those at Paris, Lave not been important. Although there has been flatness at Amsterdam and Vienna, the fall in each case has scarcely been equal to a half per cent. At Paris the range of fluctuation has been 2 per cent., and a decline has been established of 12 per cent. The following are the railway calls for the month of May, so far as they have yet been advertised. They include the 600,000l. to be aremitted to St. Petersburg, or held by Messrs. Baring at the disposal of the Russian Government, as the first instlment on the Russian railway scheme:- It appears that the dividend of the French Credit tobilier this year is to be at the rate of 23 per cent. Last year it wax 40 per cent. The assets of the company are stated to consist of 9,00,OOOf. in rentes, 3000,000f. in shares, and 75,000,000f. in advances on securities, &c. After payment of the present dividend there will be 2,000,000f. to be carried to the reserve fund. The colonial wool sales commenced this evening, with a numerous attendance of buyers both home and foreign, but the prices realized showed an average reduction of about lid. per lb. from those at the close of the preceding eales. The total quantity to be disposed of Is about 60,000 bales. The Vimiera has arrived from Sydney, but is not ibelieved to have brought any gold. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day Mr. Gllott, :rIr. Hurst, and Mr. Butt, directors of the Royal British Bank, were examined in relation to their connexion with that establishment.

THE HOSPITALL1BS IN ELAND.* A tory is told ofa3late eminenb filiancial reformer t,hat, on a visit to one of the UJniverses,'he evincad an indiffereunce most'distressing' to his' host to the ordiiary<' 'objects of 'in-teres there; iiAt lastl the lucky:thoug .ht'ocou~to the junior Jello w ts- ehow. him .the butt,eryaccounts for the last year. .In an nstaiut he. plunged, like a be illtQ, a, b utte,rcn., into the congeoil .eleienbl, and was hoanb9aeabm the operation of' analyzing, clasifying, striin averages of extma:sizIngs, ;nd building up sumptuaytheorDes. upon the mean expenditure of a'fellow-eomoner in French'rolle and chapel fines. It is to ba lamentedi that this veteran statist did not -live to- see thepublication of a volume issued by the Camden iSociety b'elonging to his.favourite departnment of study,~ for it would have gone far to reconlcile him,' throughthe interest excited byit s contents, 4ithsomne of those mediseval institution;s-'which throughout his life failed to excite his sympathy. -The book mn question is neither more nor less than the balaneesheet of the foundations belonging to theEnight3 of St. John in England for the year 13SS. hIt wa, discovered by an English clergyman while passing, the winter in Malta for the sake of his health, among. the MSS. in. the *Public Library of Valetta, and 1s printed in eenso by the Society, together- it4 an .admirable analysis by that eminent Anglo-Saxon scholar, the late Mr.. John Mitchell Kemble. This. latter will, it may he hoped, securethe attention of many besidesi professed antiquaries to one ot the' most important documents forthe history of iculture that-has 'for many years pat been brought to light. We are ena'oled to see the Hospitallers in an entirely. new relation, not as in their half-barrack, half-camn, in Syria, or escortinlg traina of pilgris to the banks of .the" Jordan, nior as in Rhodes waging war against piratical Saraeens; but as landlords and' men -of business, managing their estates with a shrewd eye tc -- their own interests as well as those of Ohristendom. Ihe year 1338 exhibits them in a fairly prosperous condition. But they .had recently emerged frbm an almost desperate state. Thomas L'Archer, Prior of the Order in Englanid, was either a most unskilful or a most utikchy fnancier; isnd 'in his transactions with the moneyed interest of the day, the Lombard and Perugian merchants, had brought matters to such a pass that it seemed likely that the whole Order would be broken up in Englan'd. 'Allthe moveables in their possession had already been sold anddisposed under the 'wits (breia que "-ieri ,facis" 'eulgariter appeinti~r) obtained by these carmorants. when happil for the os pitallers there .arrived in Englanad Leonard di Tibertis, as dom-' missioner from Elian de 'Villeneuve, the Grand Master of the Order. Leonad, who, asPrior of Venice, had probably had some experience in money matters . with: the Italians, seems to have -been a man of -great tact and energy. Thomas the Archer, feeble with agp and unwieldy with fat, was compelled to resign his office,; 'the treasurer of the Order died, and Leonard took their whole affairs.into his own hands. He had brought from Italy with hima a quantity of elegant jewels for presents to individuials of importance, and by-these as well as other reeommendations was fortunate enough to ".find favour in the eyes of our Lord the Eing and our Lady the Queen, and other great men about the Court." He recovered a considerable amount of arrears of which' the indolent Thomas had been unable to obtain the payment; he cut down wood and realized 'above 1,0001. by it ; and collected the'rents so closelj up as to bring in nearly 5,0001. more. Bytheseandothermeans-oneof which was the borrowIng moremnoney, perhaps on the security of his jewels-he succeeded in satisfy- ing the most urgent of the 'creditors -of the Order. and gaining, time for the- working of a better system. The Lombards were altogether paid off, the Perugians partly so; but there remained still due to them a considerable sumt at 25 per cent.,-the best term's the order 'could obtain !. However, better prospects appeared in the horizon. There was good hope that the lands of the Templars, of which the Hospital already-held what produced a rent of 4581. ls. 10d., would be generally made over to the order; andtherecan belitte doubt that the influence of Leonard de Tibertis over the Sovereign and the magnates of the Court (who we shall see in' the 'sequel include the judges T of "the -courts of' law) - was' specially directed to the achieving this result. How great that influence 'was believed to be appears from the fact that, upon the resignation of the iunfortunat4 Thomas, Leonard was'unaauimously elected Prior of the Order in England, and the next year confirmed by the Pope (John XXI.) at the pressina inBtanice of the English King.' The publication, of Mr. Larking, therefore, gives . the condition of the Hospital's finances after nine years of his adminltration, and it must be confessed that the brethren had little cause to regret their choice. There appear to have 'been at this date 'three. classes of professed brethren, the knights (milites), ' chaplains (capellani), and esquires (servientes 'ad a1'rnct)5 in literal pccricmce, sergeants-at-arms. Of these three classes there were inEngland inthoyear 1338 an aggregate of 119 brethren, scattered over the country in certain bailiwicks, or _recptories, as they were called, i under the general control of the Prior of the English tongue. This high functionary resided at Clerkenwell, but once iu. every year visited with few exceptions, all the country preceptories. The office was an extremely dign"ified one, and the holder took precedence of all the lay barons of the realm.' 'Eis allowance was n'o less than 20s. a-day for maintenance, chargeable upon the preceptory of Clerkenwell while he resided; but when engaged in a vsitation he was paid it out of the funds of the preceptories which received him. 3esides this, he was allowed the further sum of 140 marks for robes for his household and other persons' connectedwithhim,-anenormousappoint-mentwhen it is rememberedthat about 2s. representstheaverage price of a quarter of wheat at tho date in question. Perhaps the nature of the Hospital preceptories will best appear from an actual example. We vill take that of Maltby, in Lincolnshire. This establishment consisted of a preceptor and two associates (confsatres) and it is a curious proof of the way in which the ordinary principles of the Order were made to bend to the exigencies of the case, that while of the two associates one was a knight, Sir Robert Luttrell, the Preceptor, Williame de Hambelton, was only an esquire (ser,s armor'um.) No doubt the talents' of 'the latter as aman of business were the cause of this inversion of -the usual order of precedency. These three constituted the whole of what we may call, in university parlance, the members of the foundation. But there were their servants to be maintained, of whom the schedule names the following,-a bailiff,- a steward, a chamberlain, a cook, a brewer, a baker, two serving men,-the one for the preceptor, the other for brother Luttrell,-two pages for the kitchen and the stable,, a cowkeeper, a swineherd, and a laundress. For the maintenance of these, the following sources of income are enumerated The profits of the garden, the tithes of the parish church, 350 acres of land let at 6d. the acre, 50 acres of pasture let at 18d. the acre, a wood and meadow adjoining it, two water-mills and one windmill, 52 marks' fixed rent (redditus cssisus) on lands held bv customary tenants, a similar charge of sIx marks on a carucate of land and an adjacen' meadow (held' by 'one Roger Martel, to whom the Chapter had granted a lease for life), the fees of the manorial court and heriots when a life fell in, the profits on the live stock of the Chapter, and-most Important of all.the produce of the voluntary contributions of the neighbourhood. - This' item amounted to no less than 80 marks-avery large proportion of the whole money-income of the bailiwick, which was 174i marks. It is, however, to be remarked that the'stanrum, or live stock, supplied the kitchen of the brotherhood, and the garden their vegetables, over and above the small pecuniary. profit (40s. in the one case and a mark in the other), for which credit is taken in the schedule of income.- The account of the expenses of the establishment will furnish some clue to the extent of the hospitalitypractised by the three bretbren, although the fact of the kitchen being mainly supplied from the staururn precludes an exact estimate. But, over and above this, 81. were spent in flesh, fish, and other culinary necessities in the year 1338; 7O quarters of wheat, at the coqt of 2s. 8d. a-qvarber, had been converted into bread; fourscore 'quarters of barley malt, at 2s. the quarter, had been brewed into beer to wash it down; 40 quarters of oats, at a'cost of 4 marks, had been consumed by the horsei of the preceptor and the guests. This quantity of malt wondrepresont a consumption of about 30-gallonsi of ale per diem'; and as the whole numbers of the. establishmenty including brethren and' servants, KniU K7*W Hospitalkrs in XngZdtanc1'beng, tie Rqpor Of Tri*r J'hilip de Thawe to tAe Grandi -Naaer ,4iyan'do 1_1noiafo.

Maltbyiwas burdenedwith three of these individuaLs-Gilberb deSprotlebii aa esquire, Simon de Megh, 3 forester, and Alek!asnderIe Harpour, the porter of thepreceptr,y; an.id besides their commons, the- ohapter was bounid by -a-formal document to pay.1isa. a-year to each of the two former, and. a mark to the last. "There' were usually in thele preceptorieM threetables,-the high table at which the brethren. and their. gentle andd noble 'guests would sit; the table of the liberi servites, which would be the place of the salariedl chaplains, the chamberlain; aud some other of the domestics, and the third for the horseboys, scullions, and larm servants, and it is probable that of the.c6rro aii(of -whioh the schedule: states there' were aeighty in' Ehgland) some mb6onged& to each.of these classes. The moAt splendid of aU: * the -individuali mentioned in the Volumieas enjoying the right d corrodiua -was -W41liam de Iaangeford,. who had purchased,This- 'privileges by a seasonable advance. of ready. inoney. toQ tIe chapter both in -the -priorate of the 'i cirudent Thomas the - Ar-cher, - and. that of 'the. judicious Taeonard de Tibertis. :Ee Iiimnelf,- his private chaplain, iichamberlain; . twQ servingmen, and a page-had covers at the preceptory at- Olerikenirell the knight': and' h 'spiritual adviser,- f .course, at the-high table, thQchanuberlaixa at' th:etable for- the Zibei- seroentes; aud the three serving lmen at that for tiegrooms.

As- a contrast to this 31agiifieo '*e havo- Walter le Cn, and his wife-Scastica. Of course the lady could not dine in hila. Thenir-modest corrodium 'consits of one white and one second-lbaf, a -gallon of ale, and half as' much small'beer. Temperance mi'kes the Oair content with- only lf 'a mes from each service, but-they -are doubtless 'genteel'people'-it comes -from -the hIgh table. Wiliam of -Whitby, the general proctoe of the p,rWileges of the Order, is another "corrodary" at Cl-rkenwell. Be is rather a great man, though not sogreat as William of Langford.- They sit-together at the hgh table-when 'they dine in tho hall, and the proct&sa cleEk probably talks down ' ths knight's chamberlain among the- W.if serie-tes; -but while the. man of war is trussing his points by the light of his four waxlights- the - man-66f--iw is fain to draw up -bis- pleas. by.that iof a single one; neithercan he dine in his room ad voluntatem, but only when bonl fidg sick. With Thomas Isw -we are not s'o strict. He is a. highly respectable man, and Prior ThornisL'Archer was no doubt qtuite justified in putting him 'on the list at the high table, ana settling upon him a mark a-year-the price of a squire's robe. . He fully deserved the compliment of. having the entrte among us; but, .somehow or other; there was always sure to be a boar's head or black puddings on the.board whenever he came; and therefore it is just as well that, si delAlif4t- de-. tenius sit ita," &c., he should have his flagon of ale, and his white loaf, and his mess direct from the butteries. In a year or two he will probably do what his 'cousin, Simon Symeon, has done-compound for 40s. a-year in lieu of his " corrodium '" especially if, by the favour of St. John- and good Prior Leonard, we sucoceed :in getting clear of those accursed Perugian usurers with their 2a per cent. Some of the entries in the list of "corrodairie3" suggest a difficulty, which -was no doubt often felt in the days of the Plantagenets, although it scarcely occurs to us at the prasent time. - How could any person of moderate fortunoethen make provisi6n for his wife or daughter, or even1his son, if of infirm -health and unable to-bear arms, and -yet from any cause indisposed to enter a monastery? - TheThree per Cents. now offer a readl resource, to say nothing of mortgages, sharea . in joint-stock . companies, and the thousand and one other openngs for the employment of capital which; moderm civilization has discovered. Bnt in the time of which we are now speaking land was almost the only investment, and it is difficult to imagine a more unIfortunate being thans a single wFoman in tohe possession'of'laud when the feudal system was in full operation. UJnder such circuim;tauties the purchase of a "'corrodiunn'= offered many advantages. It was, in fact, an annuity, secured not only by the law of the land, but.bythe religious character of the society which contracted to- pay it, The -violation of the compact on which it rested would be at the same time a renunciation of the primary duty of the Order-hospitality; for, although the "corrodavy" might have paid, and handsomely-too, foi his right yet he still remained in theory the guest of of.the. preceptory on which he was quartered. Such considerations as these seem to explain many of the entries. John of Oxford and Alice, his wife, are to -have every day three white loaves and two flagons of the 'best aleo, besides 30 marks a-year for the joint lives of Jbbn and his daughter Joanna, and the same for those of Alice anrd her daughter Rosa. Agnes, who- was the wife of John Piwner, is to have two white loaves and two flagons of ale. So is Agnes Tycys, who. seems not to be a married w.oman. Geoffrey, the mower, is to have the commons of tie liberi servientes, and the same stipend he had been accustomed to. Probably here, as in the case of Alexander le HEarpour, 'the porter at Maltby, we have an instance of a caful old servant who had made a purse for himself. In the 19th century GeoQffcey would have had a good. account at the savings'-bank; in the 14th he bought himself a " corrodium." There is yet another class of persons called' "' Donati," wauo re.ceive subsistence or payments from the Order. They are only.set down as three in number, and it is not easy to decide exactly upon their position. Mr. Kemble,afterremarking,thatinecelesiasticallanguage a " donates" is one who, though not belonging -to an order, is- aggregated to it and its religious services, adds, I suppose that many a wicked man, believing in the efficacy of prayer, though he himself would not, or dared not, pray, gave himself to an order in the hope of getting some profit in the next world from their merits." But the only "donatus," John Brex (Bray '), who. is named in the volume under r6veew seems not to have joined the hospital under such circumstances He and his brother William, who is an incorporated Knight of the Order, and apparently of much influence (for he holds a lease for lIfe of - Harefield, in Middlesex, a valuable demesne of the hospital, without paying any rent); receive an annual payment from tbe. gen'eral treasiury of 26 mark;s during their joint lives, of which sumn 10 only aze to continue to be paid to John in the event of his brothers death. This looks more like a liberal prov.isionfor a youngerbrother-it may be one not very well able to take care of his own money-than anythingelse. There are other peculiar circumstances about John Brex which te'd to con-firnmis hI view. - He appears as a "9 donatus" in the preceptory. of Y-evtley, in Derbyshire, with a pension of 22s. 4d. for clothes anLd necessaries. But in that ofOhippenham,inCambridgeshire, he enjoys, in the saine capacity, commons at the high table, has a horse and a servant kept for him, and reoeives an arinusalmoneypaymentof4Os. Thisgrat,aswellasthe 'one of Harefilld to brotherWilliam, appears to have been made by that sad old jobber, Prior Thomes the Archer.. I it possible thatthe "wickedness" vhich -3r. lKemble's hypothesis attributes to John Brex consists mainly in his being a pluralist, owing to the inituence possessed by hir elder brother at "t he Horse Guards"* -of the 14th century? Sometimes Royalty itself appears to have served a faithul sL?ijcct at the expense of the fraternity in the same m tuner. The house at Hampton rejoices in a " corrodary," one Robert Coltman,who was iinposed on it by " our Lord the King," and is likewie put to unusual charges for hospitality "becaise' the Duke of- Cbrnwall is staying in the neighbourhood" --- an allusion, apparently, to the residence of the Black Piince at Sheen.- But all the demands upon the Hospitaller8 for pe&manent and occasional guests, "corrddaries&' 'and " travellers" (supermeiientes), 'were siht' in -compara n T26iw.axpenies._ va teem isisf: the men -ofth6iord-audtheaneno the- robe mut zalways'regard.a other aaSieb, natuWal prey.

The very fact tiat each ?nechaor, as the representative of a powerful body, vied in influenoe ihthe territorial aristoacy which surrotunded hm, while at the same time in all knightly accomplishents he-was probably theirsuperior, and so esteemed to- be, wvas a continua provncative of ill-will, only slightly pa3liaved by The frequent -adoption of the scion of -a-noble houlse, a Basset or a ?Thville, as one of the 'poor brtehren -of TheF HEospitaL.' The estrnement; of the Sovereign wras mnore reasonable. HEere was a powerful body enlisting thie affections of. the common people, and gradually accumulating to ;tel the landed property of the county, of -which the distlinguishbing characteristic was that it was a corporation belongin to 'no nation, sand having a life of its own to -which the national life was not neessary. Satisfying the conscience by its religious chliater and at the same time g,iving free scope to-almosallsecular motives, it was not wonderful thatinan age of deep feeling, but imperiectly developed moral culture, it Ehould grow iutomostformidabledimensions,andlbecome an irnperilum in ineieo-, menacing destruction to everyinstitution with which^it came hino contact. Even the Popes, the onlfiuthority which the Grand Masters of the Order acknowledged, b5ecame jealous of it. Tn 1343, only 15 yewrs after the narrow escapa of the English branch from absolute ruin, Clement VI. administers a very severe rebuke to -.Elyan de MWlleneuve, the restorer of itsi prosperity, -complaining of t he wealth and luxury of the knights in every country, and holding out a threatthat Tie creation of a new militay order, to be endowed with a portion. of the property of the-Xospltal, 'was loudly called for. He states the assertion of many that the resoucres of' the Order -exceeded those of the rest of the Chuia put together, andlainents theinction of the TemIplars, whose zeal would (he tbinks) have encouraged, and been encouragedby, that- of the Hospitallers to the general benefit of thristendom.

IOA50DOAV FIDA Y. MAY ! IT. The House of Commons, having returned from the House of lIords, proceeded, in oonformity with the message from the Cnows signified by the Royal Commissioners, to the election of a Speaker. Lord H. VzAi, after a graceful tribute to the late Speaker, and an enumeration of the moral and inte31ectual qualities, the accomplished mind, the dignified and commanding exterior, and the courteous demeanour required in so exalted a poodl tion, believing, he said, that the member for North Nottinghamshnie united these eminent qua1ifications, moved that Mr. JomH Evnr.YN DxsLxsoN be chosen to fill the chair. The motion was seconded by Mr. noaxuy. Mr. DFsxsow, after expressing bis respectful acknowledgments to the House, submitted hiimself with all duty and respect toitapleasure, and, nemie contradicente, was led to t'he chair by the mover and seconder. Upon taldng the chair he repeated his acknowledgments, and, after receivingthe congratulations of Lord PAmzsroN and MW. WAoz, upon motion made by the forner he adjourneA lhe House.
Pew Londoners, even those in the official quarter, had anything to remind them yesterday aftemoon that a new Parliament had just met and that a new SrRim had been elected. An event which maybe an epoch in history passed as noiselesely and showlesaly as the death of the laet of GEORGE the THnrns many children the same morning. But even in doors, -where the great political ceremony was transacted, a stranger might have been at a loss to know that anything of importance was being done. In one very gorgeous apartment a dozen ladies and several gentlemen met, Bhook hands, and exchanged greetings. A table with some books upon it, and two or three clerks about it, showed that business of some sort was in hand. By and bye several gentlemen entered rather ill at ease in gaudy robes; on a summons a company of strangers flocked in; after a few words fiom one of the gentlemen in black silk and gold lace a clerk read a paper declaring the Assembly constituted for business; the strangers withdrew.; the robes were laid aside; some prayers were read; several Peers came to a table and took oaths, and when no more presented themselves the company dispersed; and so ended the first day's sitting of the House of Lords in the first Session of the fifth Parliament of Queen VIcronrA. In the other apartment there were not even ladies, or gentlemen in robes, except a few clerks,-no swearing in, or any ceremony whatever. A number of strangers met, many of them very strange and very now to the place. As they were sitting or standing in knots, talking and laughing together, at the summons of a messenger they rose, left the room, and shortly returned. The Assemblage being evidently -without a leader, or even any symbol of order, except a chair of state, it finrst hailed rather noisily the appearance of one member for whom it seemed to be waiting, and then proceeded to an act which most Englishmen have to witness a good many times in their lives,-the choice of a Chairman. This was dQne in the way familiar to every town, every parish, every meeting of Englishmen for a set purpose. One gentleman proposed another in a civil speech, and he was seconded by another gentleman in a speech still kinder and even less formal. There being no other candidate, the gentlemnn thus favourably spoken of thanked the company for their good opinion with that tone of manly humility and easy embarrassment familiar to all English gentlemen suddenly thrust into positions of honour. Being taken to the vacant. ciair, he was addressed by the real chief of tibe AmemblaWo in terms of measured compliment and delicateadvica; and so ended tlhe first sitting of the Lower H3ouxe on the first day of Queen VICToiUzgs fifth Par. liament. But, simple and apparently informal as these proceedings were, in their most substantial points, they fulfilled a sti* constitutional programme, and went upon antiquarian models. The substance of this ceremony has been repeated with no actual change, and, wghat is more even than the substance, the very tone and manner have been retained for a longer period than the ceremonies of most European Coronations. The SPEAxEn of the British House of Commons is an older potentate than the Emperor of RuSsiA or oi AustrrA, the SurTAN, or some half-dozen Kings. His Mover and Seconder, his Chair, his Mace, his Robe of Office, and the few simple formalities which - hedge round his Chair, are upon as old and invariable a model as the pageant which Europe and Asia met to witnems last year in the capital of old Museory. But in the simplicity of the proceedDig coist its invariableness. The more naturaUy xid 1imply a company of Eglish gentIl9mu iinst their business,' the closer do lthey keep to the .oldest examples of English life aaId manners.- What there was of a House of 0ammons, even in this primordial state, suggesteae some odd reflections oJI the wisdom of those who precipitated the Dissolution. of the old House,. in the hope of one that would suit their purpose better.' So far as regArds these gentlemen, the, scene was rather that which presents itself -on the nearest shore the morning after a shipwreck. Sir J. GiuHAar sat alone iunis glory, the greater parb of those who had shared his opinions, or invited his approaches, having disappeared from the scene and left their places vacant. A happy msbtake as to the hour saved another sectional chief from the mortification of a muster-roll in which so may a name was wanting. All about, sitting down wherever a place wva to be found, and utterly regardless of the long associations connected with each particular spot, young fellows from the country, plain men of business, and people whom nobody knew anything about,were takdng their seats, much as they would st a public entertaiment.- Yet these were the persons to whom the appeal was made; and justly, for in a matter of national honour and national feeling who so fit to decide between contending parties in the House as they who came foremost from the heirt of the country ? Other ideas naturallyoccurred to those who had witnessed many a similarmuster. It was observed that, for the first time since the great division on the Corn Laws, the Ministerial majority was so decided as to put it cmpletely out of the power or expectation of an Irish majority to hold the balance of parties. We should be the last to refuse the Irish their proper share of weight in the House, but we have ever opposed the parties that use their inifluence simply for their own objects, and vote first with one side, then with the other, as it answers their purpose. The more important questions that come before Parliament concernL the whole empire; and on these the distinctions of Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen ought to disappear. The new House promisea a step in that direction. At present it is little more than a miacellaneouz crowd assembled round a living Parliamentary type, a chosen emblem of constitutional order and deliberative propriety, in the shape of their new SPrAxEE ; a man, as his Mover describes him, "of high character, of accomplishea mind, of "dignifed and commanding exterior, courteous in "demeanour, and removed from - all party bias." With such a model to work to, and with so recent an example of t3he consequences of factiousness, the new House will probably start with honesterintentions of peace and usefulness than its misgided and Al-fated predecessor.
One of the idess attributed as a kin of nstional delusion to the Anglo-Saxon race is that of introducing their own political institutions into all countries indiscriminately, as if they contained a notorious and infaDible specific for all public evis under the sun; and, since experiments of this description appear oft-n unsuccessful, it is argued that the advantages of Constitutional Government can possem only a local or an accidental existence. Now, on this matter we might fairly observe that our propagandism, such as it has been, must certainly be well intended, for that what we thus recommend to others is nothing less thanthe treasure which we most value ourselves. We entertain, however, a decided opinion that the question can be debated uipon very different merits,-that Con-. stitutional Government never without its benefits even under its most imperfect forms, and that the effectual operation of free institutions is so necessarily a work of time that- no,dsparagment is to be inferred from a period of inactivity or failure. Certainly there are States both in the New World and the Old where the forms and provisions of a Constitution appear to be attended with very little of that effect which Englishmen ate accustomed to expect from them; but, on the other hand, it would be palpably unjust to assume that ours is the only country in which such institiitions are really bearing their natural fruit. Belgium is well governed and prosperous, and the Piedniontese i Senate has given ample evidence of the advantages arinsng from free discusion. We do not shrink even from the example of Spain, though it might be quoted, perhaps, as one of the strongest instances of apparent misconception. But, if the Spainish Chambers bear little analogy to our Houses of Parliament, they at least evoke expreesions of opinion which, but for such forms of governraent, would, perhaps, never be forthcoming. Only yesterday our columns contained the outlines of two docuaents connected with the Spanish Cortes, both well calculated in their respective ways to suggest those trains of popular thought from which sound policy takes its rise. One of these was the Speech to be read by Queen IsABEnrA to the Cortes this morning, and the other an address -of EsPmmO to the Ilberal electors of Barcelona. As far as forms go, it could hardly be inferred from the first of these documents that Constitutional Government was not flourishing in the Peninsula; and, if the contents of the latter open a disagreeable retrospect, there is at least the proof that the questions at issue are openly discussed. We do not believe, indeed, that Spain has in any manner suffered by the substitution of constitutional forms for an absolute monarchy. It is true that the country did at one time, under its absolute Sovereigns, maintain a far higher rank among the States of the world; but its decline was established long before the promulgation of the Constitution, and the Spain of the present day contains more elements of promise than the Spain of a century ago. We go even a step further in advance, and assert, without hesitation, that the forms of Constitutional- Government, even when most hollogw and 'unsubstantial, cari'y with therm advantages -of no slight value. They keep not only the image, but also the machinery, of political freedom before the eyes of the people. So long as the people's representatives meet together to despatch, even nominally, the business of the State; so long as they debate, even with ever so much subservience, questions of real public policy, there exists always an opportunity for the revival of public spirit and the conversion of those forms into actual realities. - To obtain a Charter may be the work of a revolu- tion, but to make a Charter a verity may be the work only of accident or circumstance, adroitly but peaceably improved. A little more embarrassment than usual on the part of a Government, a little more boldness than usual on the part of a Deputy, a little more activity than usual on the part of the people, and the show may be turned into substance without any derangement of tho political macline. And, after all, it is not necessarily to bo assumed that an Assembly of Deputies, although given neither to oratory nor remonstrance, does otherwise than represent the constituencies of tiC State. it is not impossible that the State i-iay bo uinmoved as well as tne Chamber. What we should term "stagnation" other nations nmght term " order," juBt as what we should call " ordeP' Americans might oall "stagnation;" and if the Chambers only :re. fleet the actual opiinion of the country their proper functions awo disharged. . The vitality of both may-burst forth together ont the appearance of any question of real interest. During the late war thq apathy of tho Prussian Housei of PaPrliamb.a furnished 'I striking eontrtst to thle vigour a aimaton orf ur owis; but this W"-thu r;ekiu rather. of the sate of fieling in Prumia than of any peculiar operation of the Prussian. Constitution. The ;traditional -jealousies of the people pointed rather to the Weost f Europe than the East ; as regarded the Ottoman Empire they were passive, and indifferent, while the national frugalityinstinc. tively shrank from the ruinous costs of European war. ThMe4hambers therefore complaisantly echoed the sentiments of the Court on the question of neutrality; but what has occurred within the lasf few days? These very Houses, recently so coiaE3liant and unanimous on pDints of European policy, have set- themselves resolutely against the Government on a question of taxation. A proposal to increase the duty on salt, in the highest. degree unpopular in the country, proved equally so in the Chambers, in one of which it was only cax- ied, by atriffing?najority, after the greatest efforts, and in the other was most decisively rejected. One other exampleof.a somewhat different class may be added in illustration of our argument. Of all the hopeless specimens of political creation the South AmericanuRepublics have been considered the worst. It has been very reasonably asked what their inhabitants have gained by pawsing even from the domiinion of a Captain-General to such " self-govern- rment" as -they have exhibited; and yet it now appears -that one of them, at any rate, is emerging into the vigour and usefulness of political manhood. The accounts from the Republic of Chili represent it as steadily advancing in raaterial prosperity, as rapidly developing its own resources of opulence, and as even contemplating a loan to one of ifs less thriving neighbours. There is, however, a second point to which, in the consideration of this subject, attention is partioularly due. Good Constitutional Government is the work not only of Charters, but-of time; nor is it in the least surprsing that Parliaments instituted in the present century do not exactly resemble in their oporation- a Parliament insti7tuted 600 years ago. Our own Australian Colonies, thoughpeopled by Englishmen like ourselves, show that constitutional inachinery, even when constructed on the best models and worked by apt hands, requires tiime and use. to bnng it well into operation. For this matter, indeed, we have no neecd to go beyond our own shores for an example. It was long before the Parliament of England became what it is, and those who look at its position and its functions under the TunDOn and the &uAnTs will be very little disposed to scrutinize the imperfections of others. But, without these nustituti6ns, however inoperative, and without these forns, however empty, no progress could have been made at all. The first thing necesry is a Constitution, whether it be a reality or a aham. If it be a sham it may become a reality; but if it does not exist it can never grow. Such institutions are to the political life of a nation what rivers and other natural advantages are to the material resoures of a country; they may remain unemployed or dis. used for a time, but they are indispensble to progress when its appointed period arrives. We may reasonably rejoice in our own position, as furnishing the oldest and the noblest example of Constitutional Government, but there is certainly nothing in the early struggles of such institutions which should lead to their disparagement elsewhere.
It may have happened to some among our readers to travel along the weary high roads of France in the old days of diligences. On such a road there was no rest for the eya-no loophole for the imagination. A ioinstrAightlinewasproduced for all practicl purposes, to infinity, and this line was of rough pavement-with, on each side of it, a ditch, and- between- the ditchew anc the pavemerits two long rows of poplars. The poplars near Chalons were like the poplars near Lyons. You would have sworn, again, that the poplars near Lyons had passed the diligence in the night, and had popped themselves down nearer Geneva, as you gazed with lack-lustre eye, upon the tall vegetable ,productions which fantked yo6inir path on: y<ur approach to the sub-Alpine regions. Poplar-poplar-poplarone knows- what it is to be sick of perpetual arguers-of perpetual punster-of the ticking of - Dutch. clocks-of feminine exhortations-of the monotony of a sea voyage; but there is no perpetuity worse than a perpetuity of poplars, as any lady or gentleman who has ever been whirled over 500 miles of French chmmesse muBt be wedl aware. It was Cowrns who wrote,- "The poplus re felled, farewel to the shade " And the musical sound of t'he cool colonnade r And he actually got sentimental upon the subject. Haad he ever' travelled in the diligence from Marseilles to Paris he would have found other employment for his melancholy muse. Now, just as in travelling through France you meet with nothing but poplar-poplar-poplar, so in the investigation of the affairs of the Royal British Bank 'tis nothing but rogue-roguerogue. According to the time-honoured Irish phrase, "One is. so like both you cannot tell the "Other from which." Each steps forward in turn and blandly offers his neck to Mr. IirimT1u's not very gentle grasp. Each gives his evidence with a degree of complacency which would be the most amazing thing in the world were it not that the acts of rascality which are narrated in the evidence awe more amazing still. Is not that yonder smiling gentleman, who is giving his answers with a kind of benevolent reluctance, acknowledging unwillingly the struggles and triumphs of a well-spent life ? Not a bit of it; he is testifying to his own sham in a sries of rascalities almost unequalled in the chronicles of commercial rascaldom. He is telling the Court how he helped to rig the market, to steal the money of the shareholders, or to connive at the theft. He is explaining the mysteries of paying dividends, not out of the q4itlar of the sharehoiLders, but out of the deposits of the depositors. He and his accomplices were aware all the while that the till had been robbed to the last farthing available for purposes of theft-and still they went on. Every additional day the bank was kept open a fresh crime was perpetrated-still they went on. And in such a case can any substantial distinction be made between the persons who actualy committed this series of atrocious robberies and the man who stood by-who saw it all-who knew it all-who, as far as in him lay, helped to impose upon the public-and who held his peace? If a man strike another with a deadly weapon the law will imply malice ;-what is the fair inference of intention from the conduct of the man who acts as the accomplice of thieves and makes no sign? Before, then, touching at all upon the examination of Mr. Hu-r,Ry Brow.N, whose statements were received by the Batnkruptoy Court on Wednesday last, we would call attention to a dlocument quoted in the examination of CRAuFurRD last Monday. We beg exact attention to the date of the subjoined circular. AUl was ruin around them-hopeless, irremediable ruin-when the Chairmaan, the Deputy-Chairman, and the Directors did not shrink from making this further application to their shareholders:- "lRoyal British Bank, Threadneedle-street, London, August 11, 1856.

"I amj Sir, your obedient servant "THOS. CURUFUHD, -General 3Kxmaer.' We should liLe to know who among the members of the Board wat a stranger to this most atrocious proceeding 9 It was, we presume, inconsequence of this appeal that a poor woman, as was stated yesterday, deposited 3001.-her all -and within a day or two of the final closing -of the Bank. A protrated enjoyment of all the benefits arisincg from sea air at Portland would be the appropriate recompense for all persons engaged in so deliberate a swindle. With regard to Mr.- Humrn. BnowN, the history of his connexion with the Bank is -briefly told. He became a Director on the 4th of February, 1853. In order to entitle himselfto this honourable distinction it was necessary that the then. MP. for- Tewkesbury ahould be a holder of ten shares of fifty pounds each. This little difficulty, however, which might have thrown a tmporary obstacle in the way of any man of lea soariug genius, was nothing to Mr. XE BRowxr. He gave hisnote forthe amouat, and at-notemaz not yet been paid. He conimenced ihis dealings with the Baok by paying in to his credit the sum of 18L 14s. This account, which began with 181. 14s. to his credit, ended in. a debt of 7t,0001. The very same. day that Mr. Baow2f paid in the large deposit abovenamed with one hand, with the other he contrived to borrow from the concern 2,0001. upon hi noteof-hand. On the 12th of March he obtained an advance of 3,0001., on the 2d of May of 4,0001. more, on the 16th of June of ',0007. By the 4th of September he had become liable to the Bank for bills discounted to the amountof 22,0001. It is obvious that even Mr. Lmmma n, with all his ingenuity and al1 his perinacity, has not succeeded in plumbing the dejpths of this black pooL- Why, for exampl7e, were all these advances made to Bnowx ? Who benefited by the transacion besides hiniseif? It is merey childish to suppose that BtowN, a perfect stranger, knocked bt the door of the British Ban, gave his note-of-hand for 5001., became Director, and then obtained what advances he chose simply aa a question of general philanthropy and good feeling. There is far more behind of which we have not yet any idea, and which never will be got at, we fear, by any proces now known to the law. There has, we cannot help believing, been a division of the spol of wlich we have heard nothing.
The last of the children of OZOnGE M. as departed this life. Her Royal Highlness M&y, Duchess of Gi4r.osr, expired yesterday mornmg at the age of 81. She was bom on the 25th of April, 1776, and consequently had long passed the ordinary limit of human life. It is impossible- not to fedl that the extinction by the death of this Royal lady of a family placed in so eminent a station is a noteworthy event. There were thirten children born from . the mariage of. GoonG: III. with Queen CRAztoyri-GEo.Gy, Prince of. WA5T, after- wards G6Gz x IV. ; F=EDmacx; Duke of Yonx; W Lfm, Duke of CaCE, afterwards Wiram IV.; EDwARD, Duke-of KusT; ENMST, Duke of CuZBDa, afwardz King of HAnovxx; ArGusius, Duke of Sussxx; and Anoxrnu, Duke of Ca3=mGm Of the ix daughters three died unmarried, and three were :arried. The names in the order of birth stand thus :-The Princess Royal, COAMLor AuGusnA, who -was married to the Ming of Wun ExBfCG; the Pxiness AuGvsrA, who died unmarried; the Princss EumA Err, who was married to the Prince of ErssE HomsunG; the Princess MMAY the lady just dead, who was married to her couin the Duke of TaocrTmn ; and, finally, the Prinoesses So-PHU and AmxuA, both of whom died unmarried. With so copious a race there was little danger of a disputed sucession or of a vacant throne. It is singular, however, how few in number ate the representatives of this numerous family in the present generation. Queen Vicroma, the King of H.aNovin, and the three children of the late Duke of Casmur.G are, wo believe, now the only survivors, and the Prnces CHA:LTonI, daughter Of GEORGE IV., is the only one who has passed away. There is, however, happily but little chance that the Royal Family of England will be speedily exhausted. But a few days before the venerable Duchess of Gxoc zma was summoned from this world a ninth child was born to the Queenuof Eno nazf), so that an orderly succession to the British throne would appeartobe amongthe eventsonwhich one may calculate Tvith reasonable certaity. It is but just that we should add a few words asa tribute of respect to the memory of the late Dachess of GLoCoSTa. IHer RoyalHighness was never called upon to play any prominent part on the public scene, but her private life was marked by every womanly virtue, and by the profuse exercise of unostentatious charity. She was a distinguished ornament of the high society in which she had so long moved, and hter loss will be most deeply regretted by those vho knew her best.

Sir,-Your Paris conrespondent, in hiis letter of the 16th of Febrarwy, briefly notioed and commentedaon an 'tcla just printed in the Joural des Dd6ats, and cotaning some forcible remarks on the order in Council by -wbiddevey forein deorationr, unless it be the reward of ih e( military services performed vnder the f iag, is for. bidden at the Court of Her Majesty. The artce justly pointed out the eccentric chaater of the xegulation, and excied a good deal of attention both in lrance na else; where. But I wish to beaflowedtoshowinafewwordg that teib case is really mauch stronger than that stated in iTh Dgbats, and that the prohibition referred to, in itslf most st-ange and discourteous-and rery generally felt to be so- is rendered-still more offensive by the capricious miode ofitg_ tt a icatded dificult to suppose that the reasons on whikt the prohibitory egultions are based can be substanta, when we find 'that many persons are permitted to dis=ad them who can scarely be sapposed to come nnder the7o& dally exempted head. -I it be ono coeded that other than mil4tayiaervo may conatitute * elaixuof eXemption, t1he aplicatilo of the rule in question becomes a grave disourtes lnot only to those who are compelled to sbomit to The indigsity of its enforcement, but likewise to the Sovereigns who corifer -hea de tions theeby aighted.

THE NEW PARLIAM ENT. BOJUSE OF LORDS, THuRSDAY, APRIrL 30. 'Tho first session of the fifth Parliament summoned ,durlng the reign of Her present Majesty f,irmally comanenced this day. The opening of a new Parliament, at all -iMeo a great Gonstitutional ceremony, is at the present juncturo peculiarlymomentous. The Governu:ent which so ecently brought the country through an arduous war, and, In concert with its allies, restored poace to Europe, having ien defcated in the House of Commons on a seconday question of foreign polioy, deemed it expedi.at to counsel the Sovereign to dissolve Parliament, that the opinion of Ahe constituencies might be elicited on the decision pro. snouneed by their representatives. To the appeal thus =-do to them the constituencies have given an em3patic and nmistakeable response, at once completely endoring the acts of the censured AMinistry, and .argely recruiting tho strength and spirit of their boliowers. Meanwhilo the China question, which had 1mrecipitated the diBsolution, has assumed a graver and anore menacing aspect, demanding on the part of the 2xecutive and the Legislature tho exercise of increased -energy and firmness. Bat not only is the new Parliament 'Mshered into existenco appazrently on the eve of a war with J?he Celestial Empire, but most important measures of 3ntcrnal improvement are generally believed to be impend. 'fg Besides the many schemea of administrative, legal, nd soial reform to which our renovated Legislature wil fiave to address itself, the task of revising its own constita'Mon, in connexion withthe amendment of the national repre. Sentation also lies before it; and should the expeo',stions <of the country in this respect be fulfilled the present ParlUMMent is destined to receive the historical appellation 'of the "last Parliament convoked unlder the first Reform But little pomp and circumstance, however, marked the dmugural sitting of the reconstituted Legislature; and by .ny but a sober-minded and eminently practical people -so remarkable an absencoof glittring pageantryaud splendid Igrms would be regarded as singularly oat of t,eping with Me strong and anxious national interest which such an xcassioa could not fail to awaken. Irrespective of thu zeceutness of the late happy event in the Royal household, it Is iaot in accordance with general usage for the Sovereign 4o attend in person at the first dtting of a new Parliament. t3he election of a Speaker for the House of Commons, the ,.wearing in of members in both chambers, and a few other -reiminaries lincidental to the reconstitution of the two nnemblieta process which usually occupies about a week,have it^ precede the deliveryof the Queen's Speech; previous -So which, of course, no busiaess of any importance is trans. 'oted. Before 2 o'clock a considerable concourse had collected Zoun0 'Fhe entranco to Westminster-hall, to witness the rrival of tho leading personages about to officiate in the -oreamony. The interior of the House of Lords at firt pro-aented an array of all but empty benches, the dreary vacancy <Df the gorgeous but somewhat gloomy chamber being alono Tolieved by the presenee of some 10 or a dozen distinguished aes seated in a single group on the Opposition side, the 4hree clerks at the table being the solitary occupants of 3he floor. At 2 o'clock the Lords CommIssioners, wsho were the lord Chancellor, the Duke of Argyll, the Earl of Barrowby, Lord Stanley of Alderley, and Earl Spencer, <entered the House in their offidal costumes, and took their -places on the woolack. Not more than half-a-dozen other Peers were then present, among whom were Lord Panmure, .3arl Beauchdamp, and Lord Belper; and throughout tho entire sitting the wFhola number In attendance at one time -did not exceed 12 or 15, The Usher of the Black Rod having been direotcd to -summon the Commons to their Lordships' House, in tho lase of a few moments Sir Denie Le Marchant (chief clerk), necompanied by Sir George Grey, Sir Charles Wood, and a 'large muster of members of the Lower Chamber, was in attendance at the bar. The LORD CHANCELLOR announced that the Royal smomnlssion, graciously authorLzing him and his co-com-3issioners to oPen Parliament in Her Majesty' name, %vould then be read; which was done by the clerk at the Itable accordingly. The LORD CHANCELLOR then said,-My lords and -atntlemOR, I have it in command from Her Majesty to let -yoU know that as soon as the members of both Houees shall 'leavo been sworn the cause of the calling of this Parliament Zogether will be deolared; and, it being necemsary that a 9peaker of the House of Commons should be first chosen, it -is Her Majesty's pleasure that you, gentlemen of the House of Commons, should repair to tho place where you are to sit, -and there proceed to the appointment of some proper person -ffo he your Speaker, and that you should appear here to.norrow at 2 o'clock, and then present the person whom you .shall so choose for Her Majesty Royal approbation. The Commons then withdrew to their own chamber in -sbeadlenco to this mnandate. The Royal Commissioners also *temporarily retired to disrobe, and on their reappoerance -010 Lord Chancellor alone occupied the woolsack. Prayers supplioating the Divine blessing on the counsels -01 the Parliament wero then read by the Bishop of Gloce3ter, thoir Lordships kneeling during the pious exercise. This religious service concluded, the administtion of -the oaths to peers by the clerk at the table, followed by -.he inscription of their several signaturs on the roll of the House, next commenced, the Lord Chancellor leading the vay in the observance of these formalities. The other peers already mentioned as taking pait in the *erlier proceedings next presented themselves to be sworn and at intorvals, during the remainder of the sitting, small &uots of members ocoasionaUy dropped in to the aggregato '-umber of between 40 and 50, and underwent the same -ordeal. The oaths were thus administered to the Duke of NOwcastle, the Earl of Albemarle, the Earl of EIUenboroagh, -the Earl of Cardigan, the Earl of Roden, the Earl of Stan-hope, Lord Overstone, the Earl of St. Germans, Lord IJonteagle, the Earl of Hbrdwicke, &c. The return was likewiso made to the writ for tho electIon -of 16 representatives for ScotLand. After spending upwards of an hour and a-half in the fitful 'snd somewhat dreary process of ' swearing in," The LORD CANCEMLO}R a0journed the House at Q'quarter past 4 oclock.
"HOUSE OF COX1XIONS, THtmIJDAY, A?iu 30. The members of the Houso of Commons were summoned 4o meet at 2 o'clock for the election of a Speaker. They began to assemble shortly after 1, and at the half-hour npwards of 40 hon. gentlemen wvere present. From that -time till the commencement of the proceediDgs the arrivals -ollowed each other in quick saccession, and when the Deputy Usbor of the Black Rod advanced to bhe table the foose was orowded in every part. Amiong the first who entered were Lord Hotham, Sir James Duke, Mr. Waiter, and Colonel French. They were speedily joined 9oy Mlr. Hayter, who, radiant and alert, darted hither and thither in his own peculiar manner, bestowing a pleasant -amile alike upon friend and foe. Lord Eloho, who has just -zeovered from a somewhat protracted illness, was cordially received by his friends, and Sir Benjamin Hal looked as -gay and unconcerned Esw if he hd never felt the cues of -oificeor the burden of representing a large and exoting uonstitrueney. The Attorney-General was another early fl.nisterial arrival, and the hon. and learned gentleman, withdrawing from the thzong on tho floor, calmly seated 1imself on the Treasury Bench, and was soon absorbed in -the perusal of a legal document of formidable dimensions. f;ir James Graham entered alone, and, after shaking hands with several hon. members, took possession of his old seat il)ow the gangway on the Ministerial side. He was Joined thero by Mr. Gladsbone, who arrived late, but Mr. Sidney 1erbert, although preoent was unable to oomplete the trio, 3iss moat being occupied by Mr. Gilpin, the new member 2or Northampton. The Cabinet Ministers were trdy in Inaling their appearance. For some time t'e Colonial Xecretary wvaw the only one present; but at length Sir Cqrnewall Lewis came in, and the right hon. centlemen ws followed at intervals by Sir George 'Grey, Sir Charles Wood, Mr. Vernon Smith, and Mr. aines. The last to arrive was the First Minister himself, ;'nd it was not until Sir Denis La Marchant and the House ,had returned from the Lords that Lord Palnierston entered vand took his seat On the Treasury bench. The noble lord -cas received with general cheers. Mr. G. A. Hamilton -was for several minutes the sole occupant of the front Opposition bench. Lord Stanley arrived early, but he took a seat on ono of the benches usually occupied by the " in. \dependent" Irish members below the gangway, and, owing some misunderstanding as to the time of meeting, neither Disraeli nor Sir Johu Paklngton was present. Shortly before the proceedings began, however, Mr. Walpole, Sir F. -hesiger, Sir W. Jolliffe, Sir Fitzroy Kelly, and other influential members of "IHer Majesty-s Opposition" appeared in their places, and the back benches were well filled. The absence of Lord John Russell was remarked. There was, however, a large attendance of the mew membem rUnknown facee bet the eye in every direc tion, but the greatest change was observable below the gangway on the Ministerial side. The seats lately fi'ed bz ziIr. Cobden, Mr. Bright, mr. Gioson, Mr. Layard, Mr. ounadeU Palmer, Mr. P. Phillimore, and others, were ocCutpled by hon. gent2namen wrhose nemes are not to be foutn; in Dod, Prossainiit arnong the new members was General P~~iPoio t Thompson, who appeared in excollent health slid 5arI~ and wlweg hand wagrasd by alm%A evpy, ore present. Sir John Potter, one of the members for IManchester, occupiel a seat on the muiisterial 'bnheswNearly all the metropolitan members were in their places, but they. did not avail themselves of the privilege accorded ;tio them upon the assembling of anew Parliamen-viz., that of sitting upon the Treasury bench. .While wait;. ing for the arrival of Black Rod hon. gentlemen: mOved about the H:onse, shaking hasnds and exohanging congratulations. The floor was crowded with membbrs engaged in conversation, and not unfrequently the hmn of their voices swelled into shouts of laughter. But the members took their seats and all noise ceased when the Deputy-Usher of the Black Rod was announced with a enesage from the Lords. Precisely at 5 minutes past: 2 o'lock Mr. Palman, dressed in his officialoostume, advanced to the table and said,-" Gentlemen, the Lords, authorized by virtue of a Royal Commissio n, deiroe the immediate attendance of this hon. House in the 33ouse of Peeers to her the Commission read." Mr. PFhlan havng retireds Sir Denis Le Merchant, the clerk at the table, proceeded to obey the summons, and was followed to the, Lords by several of the Cabinet Ministers and a large number of members. In a few minutes the Commnons returned to the Houses and, alter a short pause, which was terminated on the entrance of Lord Palmerston, who was loudly cheered as he assumed his seat on the Treasury Bench, L-ord H. VANE rose, and addressing the Clerk (Sir Denis Le Marchant), who occupied his accustomed chair at the table of the House, said, -Sir Denis Le Marchant, in conformity with the Message which the House has heard thb day delivered through the Royal Commission, calling on the House to proceed forthwith to the election of a; Speaker, I now venture to prese nt myself to the attention of the House with the view of inviting it to give effect to that gracious command. (Hear, hear.) We, who have served in former Parlia ments, have been long accustomed to assoclate the name of Mr. Charles Shaw Lefevre with all our proaeedings (cheers), and it became a mratter of routine, as it were, to -propose his name for the Speakership at the opening of every ueW Parliament; sad now that he has retired at the close of the last Parliament from the chair, a very heavy and grave repousibility rests on any member who under takes tho task of proposing his successor. Mr. Lefevre was a man who united in himself the most eminent qualities, and It Will be difficult to find any member of the House who combines in an equal degree all the remarkable qualifications which, in his position of Speaker, distinguished that gentleman. (Ronewed cheers.) His lofty and dignified bearing, his equability of temper, his unquestioned impartiality, his perfect knowledge of all the forms and uages of Parliament, his intimate acquaintance with private Parliamentary business, his readiness to afford information to every member who sought his advice upon any point (cheers), constituted a unioa of qualifications diffiult to equal and impossible to excel. (Cheors.) The character of the Speaker of this House must at all times exercise an important influence over its deliberations. (Hear, hear.) Ia former times that independence of character and that firmness of purpose vwhioh cod alikeresWst the blandishments and frowns of the Crown-seemed to be one of the primary re commendations for the offiEce of Speaker. Now, though, no doubt, it is essential that we should choose a man who will steadfastly uphold the privileges of the House, yet in fact and reality we entetain but slender apprehensions of failure in that respect, and it seems that there are qualifications for the office of Speaker which in modern times standforward with greater promlnence. Weought to choose for that post a man of higa character, of accomplished mind, of dignified and commanding exterior, courteous in demeanour, and removed from all party biss and one who will on all occasions on which reference is made to him decide with equal justice and according to Parlia mentay sage. (Hear, hear.) But this is not alL The magnitude of the private business and the importanco of the rules of the Rouse, render it necessary to choose some member of long Parliamentary experience intimately cognizaut with the working of thoso rules, who Would gud them from being unduly relaxed, and yetatthe same timeofamind not given to au unreasonable adherence to antiquated1 prac tices, but disposed to suggest alterations whenever tho growing business of the country and experience prove that such alterations may be beneficially adopted. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me that we have a member in this House who unites in himself those qualifications, and many who hear me and who have observed the Parliamentary career of my hon. frlend Mr. John Evelyn Denison, the member for North Nottinghamshire, will recognize in his character a union of those different qualifications. (Cheers.4 Without disparagoment to the conflicting claims of other hon. geutle. men-for I am ready to admit that many members might be found on both sides of the House vwith qualifications of a high order,-I may be pernitted to say that when amepiber during along Parliamentary career has combined those high moral and intellectual advantages, has, at the same time, been unconnocted with official life, and has devoted his mind to the private business of the House, it does appear to me a fitting testimony to render .to suh a man to elect him Speaker. (Cheers.) Do we want a precedent for such a course? We find that the brightest example of a Speaker in our time stood in precisely similar circumstancese Mr. Charles ShawLefevne waschosenfrom among the county members of 8ngland. He was out of the sphere of the legal profession or official career, and a more sacOessful example of a Speaker could not be found in modern times, or perhaps at any former period. (Cheers.) I have, therefore, the greatest pleasure in proposing that Mr. Evelyn Denison, the member for North Nottinghamshire, do take the chair. (Cheers.) I may in some degree be iniluenced by private feelings; but, at the same time, Ishoild not venture to propose my hon. friend to fill the chair if I did not feel convinced that he unites in him self, in a superior degree, the external, moral, and intellectuAl qualities which are necemsary for the office of Speaker. Having served in former Parliaments with him, I feel convinced that he pos. sess0s all the requisites for this important position. He has sat in Parliament for a long series of years as the representative of large constituencies. He was at one time elected a member for the very important consituency of Liver. pool, the second commercial town in the kingdom ; he afterwards represented a county constituenoy, and subsequently a smaller constituency, wlich enabled him to devote much Of his time to tho private busines of this House ; and he now represents a large commercial and agricultural district, which places him in a peculiarlyfavourable position for understaiding the wants both of town and country constituencies. He hae also acquired a very inti.. mate knowledge of the mode of conducting the private busi. ness of this HIouse, and I entertain, therefore, a certain conviction that if the Hous e ratifies the proposition which I am about to make, the experience of the future will prove the wisdom of their choice. I have the greatest pleasure in proposing that Mr. Evelyn Denison, the member for North Nottingharnshire, be the Speaker of this House. Mr. THORNELEY.-I rise for the purpose of seconding the mation that Mr. Evelyn Denison do take the chair as Speaker. No doubt the position of Speaker does requira a genOtleman of much experience. The Speaker of this House ought to be intimately acquainted with the mode of conducting business; he ought to be a man of great patienace and sagacitv, and especially of strict impar. tialitly. Mr. Evelyn Denison has occupied a scat in this House for nearly 30 years. and having vwatched his conduct since I came into Parliament, I knowv that he has given g,reat attention to the forms of procedure of this House; that he has bean a member of :more soIect committees than almost any other member of the House, and that he h%s very frequently indeed presided as chairman. I have the utmost reliance that, with his long experience in the House -with the attention which he has given to the business of the House-he has all the qualifications to make an excellent Speaker. The private business of the House has most enormously increased of late years. The wealth of the comn. ery has increased, and its distribution in railroads and other public works has been very great indeed. WhenI firs came into this House, some 20 years ago, private Bills were discussed in committees of some 40 or 50 members) many of whom voted without having heard a word of the evidence. We owe it to Mr. Abercrombie and to Mr.Shaw LIfevre that these private Bills have been put In a very different couTse. We have now a committee of selection, wvhich is understood to have a good knowledge of the quali.. fications of most of the members. They select a committee of five members) who sign a deoclaration that they will not pass any privatel Bi unles3 they have given attention to the evidence. In this way there has been the greatest possL blo improvement in the mode of getting through the private business of the House, and I am convinoed that if Mr. Evelyn Denison be elected ho wil go on suggesting improvem ents in our procedure. M uch may be done by the Speaker, but there is mnuch vwhich must be done by members, and though I may be travelling a little out of the ordinary course, I vill take the liberty of suggesting, on this very imp ortant ocession, whether we might not carry into effect a plan which was discussed some bime ago for shortening the sp eches of our members? (Laughter, and cheers.) I would appel with great respect to the leading members on both aides to om. mence important speeches at 6 or 6 o'clock, after the private business is over, rather than wit till 10 or 11 o'clock, keeping us here out of our beds. (Her, hea.) I beg pardonl of the House for having usntlonned this sub!cc% but i l is so important that I w ead appea to thowe me m heraw ho have it intheir powr to do al thy 4 u to shorten the length of spaeeh es. I do notfeel ioemy to edd huything to what bas been said by th noble lord a to tho qualificaimas of Mr. Evelys Ielnuo for the effloe, 4OX hSPOer, excepL to. ay tha if he be eleeted I have ''the' utaosÂ£ caz3fdence -th<'rwhen he vact'. that hair, he w.ill leavg beWnd; bnm. ns high. g; .reputs'don as his predecessor in it, 1r. Shaw: Lefevre. I * beg to second iii notiou that Mr.'Evelyn Denuisu-do take *the chili-D'e - - - . Afttera ehort pause, there being o other candidate pro. posed; , Mr. EVBLYN DENISO, vwho spoke from hig usualplace oathe Milseria4 benehes, said,-.~Sir, er turn prY {ratefri thanks to ihe noble lord and my hon. friend who have introdueed my name to the Hous%, in terms, lid'd, far too fa1tteing,-in terms suggested by the partiality of private friendship rather thau by any qualities to which I cau pre. tend to ly claim. I offer mny respectful acknowledg. meats to- the House for the manner in which) they have been pleased to 'reoeive the mention of mny name. It is calculated to afford me nuch encouragement and support; but when I think of the business of this' ouse, increasing year by year-when I coisider not only the importanceofmaintainngthergghtsandprvilegesof thisHous3 but thatthetposition of the House itself In-the-framework of the constitution should be carefuy and accnratelv pre. served, I might well ghbmk from the responsibility which must atach to. any one who has a considerable share'in its management and guidance. (Hear, hear.) I shall be at a disadvantage in being placed in immediate contrast to a right hon. gentleman who filled that chair for many yeas in a manner 'which gave universl satisfaction. (Cheers.) I shall have the assistance of that distinguished gentlemani as I have had the benefit of' his example; and, under his immediate supervision, the rules and proceedings of Parliament have been digested aid ar. ranged by a gentleman who now sits at that -table (Mr. Erskine May) in a manner which eannot fail to give great assistance to all- who shall succeed to that chair. (Ee3z, hear.) if I zightly interpret the wishes of the Houso it would not become me to intrude myself longer upon then with my doubts and hesitations. I shall content myself, therefore, with expressing my high sense of the distinguhed honour which it is proposed to confer upon me, and falling in with the suggestion of ray hon. seconder, and curtailing my address within 'he narrowest limits, I submait myself, with all duty and respect, to the will of this House. The hon. gentleman was thea conducted to the chair by his mover and seconder in the usual manner, amid general cheers. Standing on the steps of the chair, The SPEARER elect said,-I beg to be permitted once more, from this chair, to offer my respectful acknowledgments to the Eouse. In carrying on the business of the House I shal not so muchl rely upon any powers of control wvhich may be vesteA in myself, I shall rely' rather upon the good feeling and right-mindedness of everygentleman. composing this assembly (cheers), upor their spirit of forbearance, and upon their determination to carry. the deliberations of the House' to a suceensful and profitable issue. I freely dedioato to the service of the House all the strength that shall be granted me and al the qualities of my mind, and I' confidently rely on the cordial co-operx. Uon of the House and on its generous support in giving effeet to its rules and orders, and in performing the various important daties which it has this day imposed upon me. (Cheers.) The Sergeanrt-at-Arms having laid the mace upon the table, Lord PALMERSTON, who was ,recelved with much cheering, said,-MIr. Speaker, I cannot forbear sying a few words to congratulato youmost sincerly upon fnding yourself in the high and exaltedpositioninwhilch thedecision of this Huonu has placed you. It must be a matter of wellfounlded pride and gratification to any man in tho land to be made president or director of that which I am not saying too much in affirming it to be the greatest and noblest repre. sentative assembly in the world. (5hOers.) The position which you now, occupy is one of the highest to which a commoner of this country can aspir, and from respect for your character and a knowledge of your eminent qualities I.am glad to find that the House ha made so ,wise and proper'a choioe. But, Sir, in oon. gratulating you upon the dignity to which you have been raised, I cannot shut my eyes to, and I am sure that you have not disguised from yourself, the difficulties of the arduous podtion which you have now asumed. You will, however, in the performance of those duties have the istance of those whom I now see at the table, who will afford you advice and counsel in the cae of any difficulties which 'may arwith respect tothe proceedingsof thisHouse. You hive duties to perform, unconnected with the deliberations of this House, of no less importanco to the public servios, and the proper discharge of which will no less entitleyou to 'the approbation and gratitude, of this Housa and of the country; and 'wbregnrd to the aicharge of these dutie 'you hvie for your guiidanc th6 lights of those iveU have gone before you. Your two iimediate pediecessors haveboth ably fulfilled the duties to which I am now reerring.. Mr. Abercromby, now Lord Dunfermline, who filled that chair too short a time for the public geod, having um. fortunately been early compelled by r1-health to retireMr. Abercromby devoted his ableandcomprehenslvemindto the improvement of our proceedings, which in his time so' much required amnendment. Tlhe memory of his good services exists inl the minds of al those who are at all acquainted with our Parliamentary arrangements, and his narae will long occupy a place in the list of those who have filled that chair as one of the most eminent and the mosg. entitled to the gratitude of the country. (Cheers.) The Speaker who succeeded Mr. Abereromby, more fortunate'in the duration of his tenure of office, as able to accomplish greater things, and I trust, 3Mr. Speaker, that you, in the performance of your duties, may equal the merits of Mr. . Lefevre; it would be flattery to tell any man living that it was possible for him to surpass them. (Cheers.) I think I am not unduly assuming to be the organ of this Houso when I assuro you, Sir, that Iu the performance of your duties, whether in the course of our debates, or beyond the deliberations of this House, you will be supported by the full confidence and co-operation of al ts members (cheers), and that it wil be remembered that your position is one of peculiar difficulty, on account of -the circumstances of the momentatwhichyoubavermounted that chair. While you are yourself a new Speaker, there are a great number of the members of this Parliament who are new to these walls, and, consequently, the task which you have to fulfil may be more difficult than was that of some of those who have preceded you. At tha same time I am confident that, while on the one hand you will show yourself to be pos. sessed of all the high qualities 'which are essential to the performance of your duties, on tie other the members of this House will give you that full confidence and support without which no Speaker would be able to discharge the duties of his office. (Cheers.) Mr. WALPOLE.-Mr. Speaker,-Sir, I cannot but regret the unintentional absence of. my right hon.' friend the member for Buckinghamshire (Mr. Disraeli), Who, owing to a mistake as to the hour of mneeting (hear, hear), happens not to be in his place at this moment. Had he been here, I am sure that he wouldhave joined with the noble lord in congratulating you upon being placed in that chair. In his absence I will venture to say, referring to those observations, 'marked equally by good taste and good feeling (hear, hear), which have fallen from you, that there is not a member on this side of the Hlouse-for those on the other side the noble lord has already spoken-who wil not heartily join with you in maintaining the dignity and authority of the Chair, and who will not, in the public proceedings of this House, or in the transaction of private business, render you every possible assistance. (Cheers.) We shal be happy to find that you equal, althougb, as the noble lord has said, you cannot surpass, the admirable conduct wlhich marked the career of your predecessor. (Cheers.) L ord.PALMERSTON then moved' tho adjournment of the House, and, The quesion having been put by the SPx&AEE, the Houze aijourned about five minutes before 3 o'clock.

I . 4 thOM OUR O CORRSPODE [A portion of the following appeaod in out sooonxd edi tion of v'sterda!- I 1 'PARIS, WEDNEsuY, APRm 29 A private letter, dated the 18th, from liuchareatg givessome particulars of the staWte of things,in the Principalities. 'All the Comnmisioners were ex-* pected to-leave inl a few days for Jassy (Modzvia), where they were to remain a month or six eeks. *It was.thoughtthat tihe Divans could not meet so soon as was expected, as the appliation of the fiman. of convocation.met with numerous difficulties, the. solution of: which was impatiently. waited for from Constantinople.. The questions of age, domicile, and unmortgaged property are points difficult to be settled in a country where 30 years ago there was no civil standing, where the la-' owners never reside on their property (I allude to. WVallachia.only,for in Moldavia the case is diffleWnt),'a where the whole of the property is greatly encunberedi, and. where the land survey andm censrus are still so imperfect, being based only on the evidenes of third parties, and where intrigue is the absorbing passion of all the upper classs. As you' have already learned from your dirdet Madrid correspondence, political people in that city were occupied by a mauifesto- of Marshal spartero, addressed to the electors of Barcelona. Against its publication in Spain every precaution X was taken, to avoid exposiDg the nominal- suthor to he. fate of General Prim. I say the non ina author, for the real one is generally believed to be M. Escosra. Whatever m3y be thought out of Spain of the Marshal's address, in Madlid, at least, people stitl think the case a bad one, and they repeat the old accusation, that if' he thought (as he says) the Throne in danger, he ought to have taken his stand beside it; and if, on.the other hand, he th9ught s he also says) the Cpnstitution menacd, heought to hLe put himself at the head of the peopl.e.: But anything would have been better than sitbinig quietly in a friend's house, and leaving Queen, liberty, and Cones t their fate, as the chances of the day decided.

The hopes that have been entertained of a speedy publication of a new Russian tariff seem destined' not to be fulfilled so early as was expected. Everything connected with it is kept extremely secret, and the only point that seems to be known or assumed with any degree of certainty is, that it will not be published before the lat of Mlay, the opening of the navigation, as was confidently reckoned on, and very possibly not until the close of the shipping season. The present tariff will, in this case, remain In force as during the two year of the war, thoughi only provisionally. - Those who profess to be acquainted with the progress. already made-in the new tariff arrangements state that the. ls.dzing principle actuating.the forthcoming changes is the propriety of reducingl-all" dutiestosuchi&spoint as 'will spoil the smugiler's trde. The next'priniple is'oreducethe duty as much as possible on all raw materials' and h f- manufactured goods required by Russian manufacturers; thus; fer instance, raw cotton is in future to pay only a quarter of the former duty. With a view alo to the moral improvement of the people, it was even contemplated for Some time 'to admit tea dutv-free, on the aumption that with greater facilities for tea-drin.ing he vice of drunkenness and the indulgence in spirituous liquors would diminish; but the intention has eventually been laid aside, from the apprehension that the trade with China would be injured by such a measure. In St. Petersburg there are numerous shops called chartschmowo , where ready-made tsa can be drunk by the lower classes: their number has increased very much of late, and the style of their fitting-up has been a good deal improved. I hear that the Russian Government has very recently deereed that the shares of the great Pereire Railway scheme shall, like all Government paper, be received at par when deposited as securty by persons having contracts. with ths Government. his advantage, to us apparently so small, is represented to me as one that is very highly 'valued in Russia, and th,t contractors, and others in a siilar position writh them are generally willing to pay a onsilderably better price for paper to wthich this privilege is attached. SARDINIA. (snOs OVa oWN OOaHRsroND1sr.) TURN, Apar 25. A conflict of rather a serious nature between the Executive and the Municipality of Genoa, which has for some time past been .gathering in rancour, has at langth arrived atsuch a crisis that the arbitration of Parliament will be necessary to settle the: dispute. The question is one of taxation. The city of Genoa, which has about the same population as Turin, had' been rated at a contribution of 800,000 francs a-year to the gabeUa (taxes levied on the consumption of wines and fermented liquors in public-houses, and distinct from the odroi or entraince dues), while Turin was rated at 1,000,000, but itwould appear that even this difference was not sufficient for the sake of justice, as the habits and customs of the Genoese:are much less caf6-frequenting than those of the Piedmontese, and their climate probably less inducing to strong drinkl. At all events, for the last two years the Muiieipality of Genoa has continually protested' against this rating as preposterous, and last year the Syndic, M. Elewa, having been unable to obtan redress from the Government, gave in his resignation, and successive Intendenti have been forced to allow the tax to run into arrear, which it has lately been sought to recover on the part of Government. For some time after the resignation of MI. Elena it was imposible to find any one to fill the post of Syndic, but at last. the Advocate Morro was chosen, and his nomination seemed agreeable to the oese. At the first meeting of the Council after his appointment it decided that the city could not pay the sum of 800,000f., and that it should be reduced to 80,000f. t'e is evident, if 800,000Â£. 'were'toomiuch,80,000f. wouldbe te little, beiidea that thii was a decidedly illegal proceeding on the part of the munidipal body. The Intendente therefore traxniittea the report to the Minister of the Interior, rho laid it before the Council of State, which confirmed the original rating of' 800,000f. In consequence, both Syndics and Vice-Syndics have given in their resignations, and their eonduct has been approved by a unanimoua vote of the Municia Council; and thus stands the dispnte at present. The Government has named, or will name, a Royal Commission to discharge the duties of Syndic ad inierim, and, as a bill will shortly be broug'ht before Parliament for the readjustment of the gakla, it Triay be expected that some middle term 'will-then b'4.found to reconcile these conflicting claims. In the meantime, of course the extreme partie4 are greatly rejoiced at this embarrassment for +i% Ministry, and no opportunity is lost by eith'tb,rhe clerical or republican journals Of o Vf +m* Tiitation: as much 53 possible.

When-the concession f$r dfheSavoy Raila-sy was granted it' was unidertood .that it was to be eitended to Lyons in one direction and tci Geneva in another, but after this came the War and the monetary crisis. The Company Laffitte had deposited 500,000f., but probably theAarieholders :were .prepared. to sacrifice -this caution-money, ar ,they refused to pay further necessary instamentS, aad so the Sardinian Goveininent con- sented to modfy the convention, and fmerely i. lafted on the completion of tne trunk line from St. Jean de Mauirienne to Air-les-Bains, through Chambery (which -is - now.workling), and stipulated for the extension to Culozi to 3oin the Lyona and Geneva lin}wrav, to be completed within twf years, and-tiat within five years a branch should be made . from Ayton, by Albertvill1 to Annecy. The projected railways., ended t here in the concessions fi the Company-Lafitte, and to go -to Genevalt-would . hatve ben necessr to pass by Culoz-that is-to spy, . -by a part 'of the LjyoS and- Geneva -RailwG a .

A decree in to-day's Gaze& appoints the Marquis dle iluma President of the Senate, the Dukes de Veraguan andAhumads, the Marquis de Santa Cruz, andDon Jo4uin Casaus, Vice-Presidents. Viluma is of avowed7Absolutist tendencies, but he is consi- dered- prudent and tolerably honest, and has more. than once refused to form a Government, becausehe considered the moment was not come, nor the countryripe,for-a reform inan Absutist sense. The Duke de Veragua will be extremely useful:should tauromachianl questions be brought -before -the - Senate. He is anl enthulsinstic frequsaeter ofÂ£$he bullring, and quite an authority npon thatsubect, but not upon any other. The Duke de Ahumada is arn old soldier who has seen no service. He was chief of the staff of Narvaez when the latter commanded the army of reserve in (I think) the year 1837. Heis known for having very ably organizei the Civil Guard, perhaps the most efficient armed force in Spain, but is no politician. Of the qualii cations of the Marquis de Santa Cruz for any post requiring ability and intelligence the less said-the better. Don Joaquin Casaus is Fisca'of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.

" G. GREY. QUESTION OF PRIVIIEG&-SIR W. MAGNAY. Mr. BE .-MY Lord Mayor,-Ib will be in the recolleotion of this Court that at our last meeting a resolution was carried that a certain report then read, and emanating Irom the law officers, should be printed and circulated among the members, and the consideration of the same postponed till the next Court. Some gentlemen have intimated an expectation that that discusdon would take place to-day, but this not being a regular Court day, but one for the discussion of motions on the paper of business, it will not come on. I now take the opportunity of asking the permission of this Courb for myself and any other member to have access to the correspondence that has taken place between the City Solicitorajnd the officials or authorities In Belgium respecting this matter, and I beg leave at the same time to remind the Court of their order to the following effect:- *- That mr. solicitor be instruct-id to furnish the Privilegse Committee of Aldermen vwith copies of ouch offical documents as he may obtasn from the Belgian Court relative to the statement contained in the I Morning Chronicle' of the 9th inst., respecting a member of this corporation, and any other documents that may be considered ne. cessary for the purpose of assisting the eaid committee in prosecuting the Inquiry." These documents to which I ask to have access, which I have seen confidentially, but of which I am not allowed to make use, because they have not been fairly accessible to me, although they are accessible to the Privileges Committee of the Court of Aldermen, I wish placed at the disposal of the members of this Court. Itherefore move- "That the members of this Court be permitted to inspect all tho officisldocuments ia the prsemsionof the City Solidtor aifeatlng a member of this corporatien." Mr. BESLEY seconded the motion. Mlr. ANDERTON.-My friend asks that he may be aOlowecd to take copies of these papers, which I contend ought to be Eacred for the present, and if the motion be carried they may be printed. I am a large shareholder in the Luxembourg Railway Company, and haverbeen so for a great number of years, and I have been and am still one ofthe auditors of the company. I should like to know what business this Coutnasvith anytbingdone with regard to theshareholders or any of the directers. If these be any complaint let it be made at the general meeting of the shareholders. Mr. BLAKE.-This matter has nothing to do with the shareholdersa Mr. AaDLBTON.-I contend that tbis Court has nothing whatever to do with it. It is quite true that procC3dings have been taken against certain persons. but with that we have nothing to do here. A report has been made by the law officers, who say they are perfectly satisfied, and that no further proceedings should be taken. The matter, therefore, ought to drop. I move as an amendment, " that the report already presented be approved." Mr. Br4jCx.-You cannot do that; you must resoind the previous order of the Court before you can do that. Mlr. A?rnuxrONY.-Thera I wFill move the previous question. Mr. Deputy BowXR.-I feel convinced that the Court will not be satisfied with any such result as that alluded to by Mr. Anderton. That which was necessary to enable the Court of Aldermen to inquire into the conduct of one of their body is eoually necessary for the rest of the members of this Court. When the conduat of one of our body is called in question we necessarily require to be pat in possession of every particular connected with it, in order that we may be able at once to contradict the charge that has been made; and it would be a strange decision indeed if information that was given to one part of the Court was withheld from another. I should presume tbat the party concerned ought to have been the first to have risen and seconded Mir. Blake's motion. I am sure that neither the Court nor the public will ever be satisfied with. out knowing the whole of this matter; and the publio will be satisfied if we are able to say that we are acquamited with the whole of the proceedings from beginning to end, and that we have formed our judgment from a correct knowledge of them. Mr. DE JEISEY.-I hope the Court will not be led to adopt Mr. Anderton's view of the case. The proper time for the discussion of this matter will be at the next sitting of this Court, when the whole case will be gone into in a proper manner. The simple question now is whether the Court of Aldermen, having had the privilege and advantage of access to documents brought from abroad, this Court ought to have a similar privilege and advantage accorded to them. The application is of so reasonable a nature that it cannot for a moment be objected to. Mr. Alderman Cuir'r.-I think the Court should be informed that one of those documents is altogether of an ex partc nature. It is a speech made by a functionary holding an office corresponding with that of Attorney-General in this country against Sir W. Magnay. There was no defence, and it was just such a speech as an advocate might be expected to make who was engaged for the proseicution where a great nuuber of matters are brought forwtard and and no proof given. Whether, under those circumstances, it would he fair that such a document should be published under the sanction of this Court is the point to consider. My own view of tbe case is that it ought not to be done. Mrr. BLAKE.-The hon. alderman has fallen snto an error in supposing that it is the speech of the advocate or the ofwcer who stands in the position of Attorney-General in the Belgian oourts that I desire to see. There are certain letters in a correspondence between that officer and the City Solicitor whioh it is important we should see, in order that we may be enabled to arrive at a correct conclusion. MIr. Alderman CuIBITT.-I have never either seen or Leard of any such letters. Mr. BLxKE. -I have. I think that all the papers ought to be in our hands, and I pledge my reputation, as a man of honour, that I wlU make no use whatever of them,except in this court. The CITY SOLICITOR.-I gathered from MTr. Blake that be did not wish to see the document to which Mr. Alderman Cubit' has referred. If it is the pleasure of the Court to pass a resolution as large as the resolution which related to the Court of Aldermen, then that will, of course, include every document in my possession; but if it comes with any restriction my discretion would induce me to withhold one of those documents, because it is,as deoscribed by Mr. Alderm an Cubitt, an ex parte document. Mr. ATDrsEtvoN's amendment, for want of a seconder, fell to the ground, and the original motion was put and carried unanimously. THE JEWISHf Dl-BILITrS. Mr. A NDERTON moved,- That this Court do again petition beth Houses of Parliament that tHe Jews and oil Her thaiety's British-born subiects may have extended to themthe rights of civi and religious liberty, anu d be qualified to hold aL civi offices in any of her dominions without any test r1 their religtoi U opinions., He said he was quite sure he should have the unaninoucs vote of the Cout in support of his motion, which souht to obtain for the Jews that right to which, in commonwith au Her Majesty's subjects, they were entitled-namely, the right of civil and religiouns liberty. Four or five times the citirens of London had returned Baron Rothsercl to repro. sent them in Parliament, and his right to sit had been oh. jected to, not by the House of Commons, but by the House of Lords. Be trusted hhat the tine had now arrived when the Heuse of Lords would not redfse to allow Baron Rothscuhld to take his seat in the Housg of Commons. While almost every other sect has been admitted into the HOUSe Of Commons, and with the sanction of the House of Lords, he thought the time had arrived when the rights which were claimed for their fellowsubjects the Jews should be granted. (Hear, hear.) It was a-o urious circumstance that in 1721, when a Bill was passing the House of Lords for the purpse of enabling the Qaakers to affirm instead of taking oatr~ the same objection was mhade against that cIds, and almost in the same terms, that was now made with regard to the Jews. In a petition presented in that year ;bhy the clergy of London to the House of Lords, as an ohjection to the passing of the Bill allowing Qukrs to affirml, it was sate d __ "That whiich chielly movel your petitioners to apply to Your Lordships is thteir serious concern lest the miinds of good men should be grieved and wounded, and the enemies of Chrtisai rup ift they shall see such condescena'ons made by aChitaLgsatr'o a set of meni who renounce the divine inetiniin fCrs,prin nominated Christians, and who rannot, on ti con,acrigt the uniform Judgiment Ead practice ot the CatocChr,bedm6 worthy of that eacred name; and your etitiaeshl nl ev to your Lordshipe' wise deUberation whotYer sc netariayi mIno contribute to multiply their sect and ep themselves nQualkere in order to be exempe rm i biaino oaths." O It was moat extraordina~ry that the Lords of that day, after that Act had passed protested against it in these terms:- 'Becaume we look upon the Quakems who reject the two gacraments of Christ, and aso, as far they do so, unworthy of the name of Ohrlstisna to be on, that account unworthy also of receiving such distinguiehing marks of favour." Notwithstanding the charges made against the Quakers at the time of the passing of that Act, relief was given to the Quakers in 1833. The same law that applied to the Mora. vians andthe Quakers ought to be extended to the Jews, who, in seeking to get rid of an obnoxious law, asked no favour of the Legislature. it was a right to which they were entitled as British sabjects, and when elected to Parliament the people had a right to insist upon their sitting there. (Hear, hear.) A better Christian, or a better man, at any rate, than the late Loed Mayor (Mr. Alderman Salo. mona) had never occupied the civic chair and It was monstrous to exclude such a man from the ilouse of Commons because he refused, from consdentious convictions, to sub. scribe to a certain portion of the terms of an oath. (EHear, hear.) Mr. Deputy Lorr, in seconding the motion, said it was a most unchristian and uncharitable act to exclude the Jews from the Legislature of the kingdom, and it was high time that this want of charity ceased. The late Lord Mayor held the office of Deputy-Lieutenant of Rent- he was a magistrate of the same county, and had formerly eld the office of Sheriff of London. and Middlesex. While Lord Mayor he was visited in his official capacity by all the nobles of the land, and the time had arrived when the Legislature ought to absolve those belonging to the creed which he professed from all unneceasary and unjust pains and penalties. (Hear, hear,} Mi. P}[PS.--My Lord Mayor, as a Jew, perhaps a sense of delicacy woald dotab lece on my part, but I cannot help saying a few words, The Jows ask only that to which they believe themselvesfrlyaud religiOusly entitled.

TO THE BDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your comments on the management of the Royal British Bank, in your artiele of yesterday, I fnd stringent remarks are made on my conduct rs auditor, some of which, Itbink, are not borne out by the aviden,oaa n impression of the previous day. I the. appear to your. sense of justice for an opportunity of stating tSe truth Far from commencing by borro5ng money of the bank during the frst three years of my connexiowith i, I 1,2001. for 24 shas. After tha tima, reqrgn d vance, I obtained a loan of 8'WjI., for which Ideposited ample security, not coii'.ting of share3, Subsequently having occasion for a further advance forthe purpe of discharling liabilities in some of the companies with which I vras connected, I applied to Mr. Cameron, stain that I must either raise money upon my shares or absolutely dispose of them. He informed me that the bauk couldnot lend money on its own shares, but that he would advance me the sum required. His own check was given for the amount, and I considered myself his debtor. Ead he sub. sequentJy realized my shares, in purance of my request to himn I should not have been a debtor to, or shareholder in, the jBank. I am termed a tool of the directors-to none of whom, nor even to the general manager, was I. at the time of my appointment personally known, and I think-the evidenoe elicited will ablve me from any connivance at fraud.

Gilott.-Yeso and did not exist, Mr. ITNKLATR.-YoI were rather a troublesoma e cstomer; I suppose? 9 Mr. Gillott.-I was thought to be 0o. Examnination continued.-After the general meeting the old systemnwent on, and he directors did as they liked. That rather nettled me, and I wrote a letter on the 7th of February, 1853, in reply to which the secrettoy of the bank briefly Â¢ncowledged its receipt, stated that "its contents were unjust, and that such measures tended to the injury of the rising establishment." The directors came to a, resolatio fat the general wheeing that they each shonld take lO shares moro. At that time I was noe aware how Mih elM. phrey Bra.wn and Mar. Esdatle had not paid for their shares. Itbe]ieved they had all duly paid for them at the general meeting it was proposed that I should become a director, and having a large stake in the concern I was desiroas of so being. My nomination w ias opposed and an amendment was moved by the deputy governor, yut subsequently my motion was withdrawn and my seat was 16be. Mr. I tnlAinM.-A ndyon did notrepresent the borough of the Royal British Bank-! -ts Mr. Gillott.-I did not particularly desire to do so, I was put forward byth . Salisbary, if I recollect right, in opposition to my 'wishes. Examination continued.-I don't think that in February, 1856, I became mote alarmed than I was in 1853. We had reason. to believe that things were going on safely, if not very satisfactorily. We were told at the general meeting that everything was going on satisfactorily, and that they were about to fissue new shares at a premium of Si. In the month of May or the beginning~ of June l detrmined to make some strenuous effort to got information, and accordingly f sought an interviewo 'with the directors, which was acceded to, and it was held at the head office.

Kcilham, and another gentleman. We went for the purpose of getting information 'with regard to the bank, as I haed a copy of the JointEeock .Tous'ncc put into my hand. We felt some uneasinesse from the circulation of a work of that ksind. We asked whether it was intended to prosceate the editor-; -and, after some desultory conversation, tbe concluson was come ts that it would be unwise to do so, however clearly we might refute a statement of that kind; and I think MYr. Cameron made the remnark as to the case of a lady being accused of incontinency, that, thoulgh she migh convince -a jury that she waS not guilty, yet the public mnight not be perfectly satisfied. Mr. ILrrexnrEn.-That there WaS no smnoke wiithout Mr. Gillobt.-We were led to understand that it would be unwFise, and that this was an attempt to extorb money from them, and they denied the truth of the statements.; Examination continued.-We asked with reference to the coal or iron works, and it was adlmitted that they' had been in the possession of the bank for some time, and tht they could not be got rid of in conseguence of the difficulty of dealing with them, and of the very delicatema.nnerin'whichit ws ne aessaly to Jwhith hua fse bWank, but that there wala hoPe of theirbeingkot rid of very. s'hortly, and that they were worth atll htwas expended upon them.

Mr. kiunPlap Brawn's debt-was alluded to, an.d we were led to undestanid that the bank-was secured. We asked whether it was true that advaces had been made to the general manager, Mr. Cameron; and we were told that there had been; andinquiries were.made as to what seciuities there were, and we wereled to unaerstand thae there was security, and allusion' 'was ade to some sbeepwalkcs in 'which thousands of sheep were running.

Mr. Paddiso-.-Allow me to correct one tartl of Mr. Gillotts satement with regard to what Passed at the meeting of the Court with the deputation In the month of June, 1856. Mr. Gillott has stated, correctly enough, that the repreen,tation made with rgrd to Mr. Cameron's securities was, that at that time ithey were not quite comn plete. That is perfe.fly corotnt, but I think he mulst be istaken in saying that there was any reference then made to' extensive sheepwallt At al events, ifMr. Cameron 'did, make any reference to his extensive sheepwalksInu Scotland, they could not have been referred to by him as constittuting any part of the security which 'was then in lrand-iosttassredly I had not then received, and I did not-state that I had received, any instructions "Yto prepoar security upon those sheepwalks. It hasalready ben givexn in evidence-upon the examination of Mr. Stapleton, if I do not forget-that it was not until the 23rd of July, as proved byamemorandum inMr. Stapleton'sownhadwriting wvhich was taken down here, I believe verbatim, that instructions were given for adding to the security which Mr. Cameron had previously submitted to the Court, and which .undoubtedly--was in hd at the time of the deputation in J,une; those sheepwalks wbich have baeen referred to ; and there wa one other most materilt-hing omitted althoetsher by arr. Gillott, if he reclleets it-ifhe does not, I am sur that other members of the delpatation will-which wastbic, that I myself stated at the timeowhat w the fact-that I did not know at that timae the amount of Me.

The debt that I had beenMinstruted to prepar a security for up to that point of timemws simply to the extent of 15,000e; not that the amount -was statedaas being 150004L, but I was to prepare a security whioh would extenr to that anmount, and the sonbjec lof that security was the Dinrwand property, which was referred to o in the examination of Mr. sttpleton, and beyond that Dingwallw property I had no instructions at that time to deal with anYthing else as con-u Mr. Gillott.-Yo s d id not me at repesntation, Rihr.

I became alarmed 'as to the position of affairs by the shares going down in the market. My motive for taking my seat at the board waLs to satisfy my own mind as to the position of the bank. Mr. LunXLaIur.-Yon didi notoconsider yoursef qualified to be adirector ? Mr. Hurst. -I did not. Mr. aIuaTx&n.-It was mnentioned at the half-Yearly meetiang that you were to have thathonour? Mr. Hu,,t-yes. Before this time I had neither heard of the Welsh works, ier of Cameron's debt, nor of Humphry Brown's debts. Exe;a upon hearing this I did not look to Cameron's account. I' attendedl at the bank two or three days a-week.1' The principal business Of the bank- was the discount of bills. Mr. NLA!vmi._When didl you first become alarmed, and had reason -to,suspet the. bak msusound ? - r. Hurst.-Onl7y a'few days before the doors closed. I only heard of Hummphry Brown's debt a fortnight after I joined the board. I heard of the Welsh works also at that ime. I never-heard that a sum of 100,000l. had bean invested in those works.- Ido not recollect anything being said at the half-yearly meetin of August, 1856, that provision had been made for bad debts. I purchased my last shares on the 26th of June, 1856. - wa asked -to purchase them, as the shares were going down in the market. Mr. IaN .B .-By whom? Mr. Hurst.-By Mr. Esdaile and Mr. Stapleton. lMr. LnxsAT.sa.-Was it not said by Mr. Esdaile and Mr. Stapleton that it would not do to have those shares continue in the market, as it would do the bank harm? Mr. Htrst.-Something of the kind, and I went and boughtthem, but not out of the banles money. I never had a penny from the bank; I always had a good account there. I had not a drawing account with the bank after I became a director. Mfr. Lrx=Aimn- When did you first have any suspicion of the bank-b-ing insolvent? Mr. Hurst.-A few days before it closed. Mr. Craufurd then said if ever it failed thenr was lOs. in the pound to pay everybody; as the baDk was making 30,0004 a-year, we might turn ourselves round. .IriER.Thn Then all the paid up capital -had vanished ? tr.

Addison is theowner of a house, No. 6, Delahay.street, Westminster, which he has -lately -pulled down, and is now proceeding to rebuild under a contract to be completed vitbhi a limited time. In the course of thes works, but -whether in consequence of them there was some question, an adcolning.house, belonging to a Mr. Eichardson, became in an unsafe condition; and the ple5ntiff, w ho had shored up such house, gave notice to the Commissioners of Police, who ia their turn, on the 28th of -this 3month, gave notice that they would enter upon the -plaintifl's premises for the nurpose of securing the house in question, ss,viug him friox aul -damage, and in pursuance of such notice they, by'their agents, entered onthe plaintiff's premises at 9 o'clock on the morning of the 29th, purporting to proceed unEder the Metr6politan Building Act of 185 (18th and 19th Vctia cap 122, sec- 69'and 73), which in such a case authorized tihem to pull doan, repair, or otfherwise secure by shores, boards, &-&c.

ME BA= and Mr. WricxNs now appeared for the 4jommissloners of Police, and aruned that mnder the Act in queston they were justified in doing what they bad done. Affidavits were read on both sides. Ile 7:rcs-CsA.cunnom thought ftere was nothing in the Act which authos7zed the Commissioners of Police in going upon another person's ground for the purpose of puling down, repahsng, or aecuring a housenot- belonging to such petson. Such a case mighi, perhaps, exist as to render it absolutely necessary totresp, but no such case was ma .e out here; there was no symptom of danger to the public; the plaintiff had shored up Eichardson's house, 2ud was liable to him for any damage. There was no real contraeiction in the afidavits. The injunction must therefore be granted, costs to be costs in the cause.

Q<OVCH In this case, which came before tlhe Court rby aourmment from chambers, a question arose as to the-costs incured by a mortgagee in an action of ejectmEmt to recover possession of the mortgaged property under she following circrmstances.-The property, which consisted of two houses in High-street, Lambeth, was mortgaged in 1851 by John Drewett to George Wheelhouse, to secure S30., sub ject to a proviso for redemption and reconveyanuce on p 3ment of principal and interest by the 31st of May, 1S53. In Kay, 1854, the money still remaining unpaid, one of these houses became&ieant, and iwas in very bad repair. On the 16th of August, 1I54, Drewett, the mortgagor, died, n on the 16th of MTovember, in t+he same year, one Collins, who was always considered to be heir-at-law to Drewett, also died, having in his possession the key of the premises, which had been for some time shut up. 'Upon obotaining the key Yr. Wheelhouse discovered that a hfr. .Tillikn -ao lived in the adjoining house, had oltained possession by making an entry through the party wall, and that he had established t+wo Irish families inu two of the rooms On the 7th of Februsry, 1855, Wheel house applied to 3fr. Norton, the magistrate at the lambeth Police Courk for rssistance to get posemssion of t;he ho-ss Mr. bortonthereupon sent twopalicemen to-ecompany Wheelhouse to the house to prevent a breach of the pace. Possession was obtained on behalof beelhosve on the Sth of lelhrary, but late in thle evenpn of tlhat day, flllikin, acoompaniedby 20-rlishmen, forcibly turned out ofthe house the two men put in by Wheehuse, an asault be.ing-ommitted upon one of them inthe cobrse of the fay, and recovered osession, Millin ha-ving been summnoned before Mr. JNOlton set-up an alleged title to the hous, under en agreement to grant a lease fro- Diewett, the deceased mortgagor. The case havingeem adjourned by the magistrate for the purpose of havini the titl iuvestigated, a cas was laid beWore counselon behalf of Wheelhouse as to whether he should proceed by ejectmest or make a forcibe entry for the purpose of recoversmg poseR6sion, ounsel advisd naction of ejectmen,whi saccordi broughat, and upon thne trnala verdict wPssobt ained by-Whe hXouse.

COURT OF O.UIEE:N'SR RNOR WVTqrv.> A A- DV TaB QUEfN V. COCKIBURN. (Sittings in Banco, beforC Lord CAIATPBELL and JusticeG WIGw;TMAN, ERLE, and CROMPTON.) Sir F. TosEssoEN (with whom was Mr. Turner) moved for a rule calling upon William Coskburn, the printer and proprietor of the Joint-Stock Companies Joucrnal, to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed againast him for a libel published in that journal on the 18th of April last, reflecting on the character of John Griffith Frith, the vice-chairman of the Bank of London, and calculated to affect the credit of the bank. The Bank of London ras established in the year 1855, with Sir John Shelley as chairman and the applicant, Mr. Frith, as vice-chairman. Its bluiness was prosperous, and its shares were in a satisfae. tory condition. On the 11th of April last an article appeared ia the Atlas newspaper on joint-stock companies In general, in which it was stated that the directors of the Bank of London were indebted to the bank, and the name of Sir John Shelley was connected with the statement. At that time Sir John Shelley was absent from London, but Mr. Frith wrote a letter to Tihe Times, in which he stated that Sir John Shelley was not iadebted one shilling to the bank, but, on the contrary, the bank had a considerable balance standing to the credit of his account. The letter also said that,- With respect to the nnworthy motive attributed to the other dlrectors in joining the board the beat reply wiul be that no director in this bank has, or can have, au advance upon anything but fiust-clasi bills of exchange, or upon such couvertible security as would readily be taken by the Bank of England or by any London banker." In its subsequent number, on the 18th of April, the Atlas, which was a respectable journal, after referring to Mr. Faith's letter in Tre Times, said:- "- In so far as he imagines that it was an implication of Sir John Shelley as having received advances he is In error, and, if open to tbah censtuction, It was not intended, and we ehould much reet it. Sir John at a recent meeting stated that directors had received advances. We objeot to any director receiving advances, and therefore our observatiens on that head were general," ac. After this this publication of the Joint-Stock Companies' Journal of the 18th of Apsil was circulated in an unusual manner, a person being employed with a placard to go about the city, and to sell it in banking-houses and in the streets. It was on the 23d and 24th of April that Mr. Cockburn caused the publication of the 18th of April to be so circilated. (The learned counsel then read the article of which he complained. It was headed, "Bank of London and Atls Newspaper," and stated that those who were familiar with the antecedents of the Bank of London could now "form an opinion whether the parties whose moral conduot has been denounced in our columns are or are not capable of helping themselves to the funds of the bank in the manner announced by the Atlas ;" and it concluded with these words):- " The worthy vice chainuan of the Bank of London repudiates and utterly deuies the above assertion respecting his colleagues ; bat we belong to that unsophisticated class of inllviluals who cliug to the oldfrahioned axlom that 'where there s smnoke there mut be fire.' Does any oneIn his senass suppoh that the re pectable parties conrected wvith the 'Atlas nowspaper would gratuitosluy have inserted so damaging an accusation without having goad and solid grounds to justif them in erawitg public attsntion to the circumstances aluded to, The public will do well to plac in juxtapositiorl the twvo assertionsthe one emanating from a public journal the dir'ctors of which have a duty to Perform anil an interest to nialutail, id on that accotunt no doubt fel themselves justiled in holding up to acorn and contempt the conduct ot suchas would endeavour t ti npose on publl credaUity. On she other hand we have the denial of an interested pErby,-oni whose public conduot and moral charaoter Is on trial. aud whode interest it lato prevent by every means in its power the traeasetionsof the board of directora becoming known to the public. Iiad thia geutleman durisg the time he was vice-chairman in anotlher bluk, taken as much anato enlighten the public on the vices of his then ehief, John Sadleur,as he is now endeavouring to do With tbe virtues of his prgient colleagues, ' he would have done the Etate somee savice."' - The learned counsel stated that he had the affidavit of Mr. Frith, of Sir John Shelley, of all the directors, and of the manager of the bank, stating that they had not been parties to any transaction in connexion with the bank which was irregular, or contrary to the deed, or injurious to the nterests of the general body of sharoholddts, and that they had no interest in concealing any of their proceedings from the shareholders or the public. Mr. Frith also stated that, since he had been vice-chairman he had attended to the affairs of the hank, and that no director had done anything irregular, or had any interest in keeping the shareholders or the public in ignoranee of their proceediogs. The Court could easily beiieve how very injurious the imputations contained in the libel must be to the characters of the parties, as well as to the interests of the shareholders of the bank, pind therefore he trusted the Court would grant the application whioh he now made. Lord COaPBELL said the proceedings of joint-stock banks were matters of great publih importance, and the Court vould by no means interfere wfith any fair comments on their proceedings; bultin thus case his Lordship thought the UplctO was entitled tothe interference of the Court for iInnetaied,it wfas difficult to say that the publica- Rule nisi granted, THE QUEEN V. SIR ZDnVARD CO.NIOYI BART. Sir F. TIXESiGER (with whom was Mr. Serjeant Pigott) said he was instructed, on the part of Mr. George Barker, magistrate for the county of Berks, to apply to the Court for a rule caling upon Sir Edward Conroy, Bart., who was also a magistrate of the same couaty, to show cause why a criminal information should not be fdied against him, under these eircumstanes :-The applicant, Mr. Barker, lived in the parish of Hurst, of which the Rev. A Cameron was perpetual curate. It appeared that in the year 1855 Mr. Cameron obtained a faculty, and at his own expense made certain alterations in the chancel, and also in the mode of conducting Divine service, which gave dissatisfaction to some of his parlshioners, which resulted in several members of the congregation ceasing to attend the church. Aboub the beginning of 1856 Sir Edward Conroy, who lived in the neighbouring parish of Arborfield, but who was not in the h1abit of attending the parish church of Hurst, united with four other gqntlemen, who formed themselves into a com. mittee for thse professed object of setting aside the said 'changes. In tho month of January, in the present year, Mr. John Walter, of Bearwood, MLP, for Nottingham, Mr. R. Palmer, the lay rector, and the applicant, Mr. Barker, with the sanction of the Bishop of Oxford, united in endeavouring to restore an amicable feeling in the parish. Mhosegenltlemen ultimately agreed to sign a letter to Mr. Cameron, in which they said their "attention had been particularly drawn to the too showy appearaneo of the new $overing of the communion tabie, to the-ubstitutionof a -bag forthe Plate-formerly used for, the eolectionrof alms, to. the curtain which is suspended on the east wall behind tbe Comulaion table, and to the arranging of tie'choir in san. plices after the manner of cathedral and collegiate establish. bezts e," and with the view of restoring peace and harmony betwyeenMr. Cameron and his parishioners they concluded by suggesting for his consideration whether he should' nob ~diseontinue the above practices. The letter was &lated on: the 27th of January, 1857, but it wals not senp till the 2d of February. Mz. Barker, on Sunday, the lst of Febpuaiy,. calledon hlr. Walter, at Bearweqd, to obtami his srinature to the letter; and while he was there Sir EdEard :Conroy called, and a conversation having taken place with respect to the expected concessions Sir Edward Conroy-said that if his friends were willing to accept what was proposed io be conceded he should not raise any further objections, though he could not tell that they would be aO. cepted, and he should stand by his friends to the last. Some inquiry then took place as to the mode in whioh the result of the cominunioation Would be made known. Sir Edward Conroy wished it to be aiade to the committee of which he was a member, but this waa objected to, and it was agreed that it should be made tn tbe senior churchwarden. Mr. Barker stated that " from whabt was said by Sir Edward Conroy at the above meeting, and from his tone and manner on that occasion, though not from any express words to that effect, he entertained a strong impression that the concessions proposed wouldl, if yielded by MIr. Cameron, be accepted by Sir Edward Conroy and his friends, though they might not be so satisfactory to them as they might have wished." The letter, when signed by Mr. Walter, Mr. Palmer, and Mr. Barker, vras sent to the Rev. A. Cameron on the 2d of February, and on the receipt thereof the Rev. A. Cameron wrote a letter to the senior churchwarden, in which he stated he was ready, for the sake of peace, to make the concessions suggested, which he accordingly did on Sunday, the Sth of February. On Easter Monday, the 13th of April, a vestrv meeting was held, at which, after tho election of churchwkrdens and other business, the meeting was converted into a special meeting on the affairs of the church. Sir Edward Conroy made a long speech, in the course of which he complained of the manner in which the concessions had been made known to the parish, and said it was hoped that the Rev. Mr. Cameron would have given up the whole of his innovatiorns Mr. Barker. in reply, reminded him that he had agreed to the mode in which the communication should be made, and slated that the impression left upon his mind by what took place at Mr. Walter's was, that if the Rev. Mr. Camerou made the four concessions proposed they would be con. sidered satisfactory by Sir Edward Conroy and his friends. Sir Edward Conroy interrupted him, and said it was impossible he could have understood anything of the kind, as he (Sir Edward Conroy) had never stated that the conces. s{ons would be satisfactory. Mr. Barker replied that it was not from the words used by Sir Edward Conroy that his impressions" had been derived, but from the strong opinion expressed by Sir Edward Conroy that Mr. Cameron would not make the concessions proposed, coupled with the other expressions, and the tone and' manner of Sir Edward Conroy. The learned counsel, after these preliminary statements, which were set forth in Mr. Barker's affidavit at great lentbh pro ceeded to state the circumstances which led to the present application. Mr. Barker and Sir E. Conroy were both in the habit of attending as magistrates atthe petty sessions at Wokingham, and they both did so on Tuesday, the 14th of Aprl. The next day Mr. Barker received a letter from Sir E. Conroy, in which he stated that in auswer to a letter from himself Mr. Walter had written him as follows:- " I have the most distinct recollection that you stated. not that you were yourself satisfied with the four Poists which we bave oalled upoa arrOcaeerontococede, buttbat.if yonrfrsendaweresathfiedwitbthemn you should not raise any further objection: ehat.onwever, you did no, think they would he sattesfed, and thatin that sse you were prepared tevtandby them tiltthe laEt. ragain repeat, there can te no mis. take as to the view,s w/hich you expressed on the occasion referred to. which were certailyb anything buttavourable to the Ideaw that the. conceeniona obtained by 31r. Palmser, Mr. Barter, and myEelf from Mr. Cameron would satiSfy those with whom vonl are sMire.i " aniL xsr Aiaward Uonroy concluded his letter thus:- "I trust that in future, should you ever have occasion to mention rne, thatyon wl adhere to fact, and not deal in impreslons. Yon sat as cineetomre as Mr. Wallerdids and you heard equailywithbhscif anohe gentW8-IldeanI lermtted wyou to 6tremain. I can onlyattribute your imoroessona to your manifest desire, at all eveats, to cerve Mr Caeron's unjusatifiable course of cenducS to hiB parish by stating your Improecaonsc, inateadof the truth." Mr. Barker replied on the 15th in a letter to Sir Edward Conroy, stating that he stM retained the impression made on his mind, "yom the fat of thuoe concessions beine more extended than were detuandtd by Mr. Gower and the Easter moeting on 18a5, fonm Sir kdvard Conroy'to redinhe ssm,b to spndeclne proeeditgerI consrequenco those proposed contesaonste fro'mhis apparedisbiefcthat they would. in fact, be ielded by Mr. Cameron, and from hil (Mr Barker's) feeling that the four points were al that could be reasonabl pressedfor bypterve former attenoans t at theo church who bad with. cisawn from its aean somepersosama Anad conclufing thus:-Mr. Barker lies " N disposition or lintienin to have any altercation upon the rubjest, but, reta,inig his own lmpreshs na and oPinions, and leaving sir fd<wDdared nruo Xyn to odnobthepsame begs to decline any fsrther corr e- spondense upon theouthatgematterneve On the 17th of April Sir Edward Conroy replied in a letter in YYhiGh ho used thsese wYords.- AYour private *impressIons are matter of msoonshine to me, as I deal mn fasts: but, as you publicy Etated them, and sOme persons may 3nowgknorwhoes.

I esteem mseolf fortunate tio have Nir. ,Walter as a witness to my words, cisrepretented The applicant, hMr. Barker, then took the advice of his friends, and, on their advice, he determined to take no notice of Sir Edward Conroy's last letter. On the 21st of April ir. Barker attended tho petty sessions at Wokin han, and there met Sir Edward Conroy and several other may,gistrates. In the course of the business both ewhri Barker and Sir Edwyard Coaroy signed an order of bastardy after which Sir Edward Conroy left the court in company with two of the magistrates. In about half an hour he reurned, and while Mr. Barker with three other maeistratnd ~was sitting on the bench, hoiding the potty sessions there, and in the acotual exercise of tbeir office, Sir Edward Conroy, interrupting the business, asked to see the order whlich he had that day signed. On its being handed to him he said, " f see the signature of Mr. Barker to this order and my own " and then, addressing himself to the other magistrates, he added, " Now, gentmesen, as I do not consider Mr. Barker a gentleman, I will not have my name attached to any order or paper with his name, or act with him in any way or matter whatever," or words to that effect. The clerk, seeing the violence of Sir Edward Conroy's conduct, then desired the strangers to leave the justice-room, upon which Sir Edward Conroy said, "Mr. Barker is not a safe person to act with in anything," and then took a pen and erased his signature from the order. The learned counsel said the chairman of the sessions had made an affidavil in which he confrmed Mr. Barker's statement, and he trusted the Court would interpose and give him that protection for which he now appealed to the Court. TLord CasrPBELL. said that if a stranger made use of such words to amagerate while in the discharge of his duty he would be gut of a misdmeanour, and his Lordship thought it was not less so because they were used by a magistrate. The learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. Rule nisi granted. CHOLLET V. HO 0rAr. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover damages for the infringement of a patent granted to a Frenchman, named Masson, for improvements in the preservation of vegetables. The plaintiff was the assignee of the patent, and at the trial, which took place before Lord Campboll at GuUldhall at the sittings after last term, it was objected by the defendaut that the plaintiff was bound to prove that the assignment had been registered in the office of the Registrar of lnventions, as required by the 35th section of the 15th and 16th of Victoria, chap. 83. Lord Campbell was of the same opinion, and, as the plaintiff declined to be nonsuited, his Lordship directed a verdict to be entexed for the defendant. Subsequently a rule was granted for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection, on the ground that the plea only put in issue the fact of the olssignment, and that if the defendawnt intended to rely on the objection he ought to have given notice thereof to the Mir. HsnmWar,aCn and Mr. 2T.&,\ISTY now showed cause against the rule, which was supported by Sir F. THEsiGqy, Mr. BOVILL, Q.C., and Mr. WiESTER. Lord CngTPB said the Court would take timo to consider. RsRICcl V. OIORDER. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to zecover damages for criminal conversation with his wife, The declaration simply charged that " the defendant debauched and carnally knew the plaintiff's wife." The defendant pleaded only the general issue. At the trial which took place before Lord Campbell, at Guildhall, at the sittings ater last term it was objected on the Part of the defendant that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove his marriage, and, Lord Campbell being of that opinion, the defendant obtained a verdict, leave being at the same time given to the lantiff to move to enter the verdict in his avour if the Court should be of a contrary opinion. The Jury accordiugy were directed to assess the damages contingently, wnec they did, at 201., a rule being subsequently granted to enter the verdict for the plaintiff for that amount. Mr. PFXSDORFF now showed cause against the rule, and contended that, according to the true construction of the pleading rule, the marriage was put in issue by the plea of "Not guilty," for ife the woman debauched was not the plantff' wfethee asno wrongful act done by the defendantbtothe plaintiff. in yt0d Mfr. HNCE, who appeared iu support of the rule, was rcsntca3eeplea owho said that in this form of action, which hi Lordshipfihoped would not continue much longer, the rlquestion was theas to the adultery, not whether a maro rdagen hady taken place. It was better that the evidence sldmtiff's bfe nsed to sthereal questiona tobe tried than that should be necessary in a cases that strict evidence of marriage shoula be given. It so happened that in this case there was a second count which charged the defendant with converting to his own use the Plaintiff's goods. It was allowed that in that case the plea of "Ne,Tt guilty", did not put in issue the plitiff's Propertv in or possessionL of ten goods, but only thle conxversion by the defendant. So in thle present case the plea of "Not guilty" denied the debauching, but alowed the woman to be the plaintifr'a wife. There would be no difficnlty in framing a plea vhicih should j&Wa the question of the marriage, if the defndant int4en dedt deny it, by saying that the womani eto a n~et th paintiff's wiife and, upon such a pla teplitiff would be ound to lve strict evidence of the arig Ih~thuh he ought to have diece a verdictfo e The other judges being. of the same opinion, the rule to enter.the verdict the plaintif for 201. ws iafe ah T, lute.

Mr. Seijeant Shee and Mr. Couch appeared for the plain. tiffs, andl Mx. Bovil and Mr. iUnthank were counsel for the defendant.. The action in this ease was brought by the plaintiffs shipowners at Sligo, in Ireland, against the defendant, a shipbuilder at Harwich for unreasonable detention of the sahntiffl vessel, the Plas. There was also a claim for C501. for money alleged to have been paid by the plaintiffs under protest overand above theprice atwhichthe defendant contracted to do the repairs of the ship. Tho defendant plead'ed that there was no contract as to the amount of the repairs, and that there had been no unreasonable detention of the ship. It appeared that thePallas, aship of 520 tons, got aground near Harwich in October last, and was sent to the defendant's ship-yard to be repaired. According to the plaintiffa' case the defendant contated to do the repairs within three weelks for 8001. On the completion of the repairs the de. fendant sent in a bill amounting to 1,201, which he re- uired to be paid before he would launch the vessel. The aefendant detained the vessel for 30 days, at the end of which time the plaintiff caid the demand under protest. The demurrage was valuea at 9l. per diem. Witnesses were called in support of the plaintiff's case. The defence was-th&t after the ship had7 been placed upon theodefendaut's slip the contract between the partiaeshadUbeen rescinded, in consequence of the laintiff's determination to have the vessel re-classed at IZoyd's. The laIntiff had her surveyed by Lloyd's surveyor, and had irected the defendant to fit her up, to enable her to be re-classed. The defendant accordingly thoroughly repaired her, and ha onli made a fair and reasonable charge for doing so. Eividence having been adduced in supportof this state maent, The learned counsel addressed the jury on behalf of their respective clients. His LORDSHIP having smnmed up 'he jury retired for two hours, and on returninu found a verd tor the plaintiff, for 2401., as a general verdict, but said that they could not agree upon any of the issues.

SZDGWICE V. DANIL. This was an action brought t-o recover a sun of 2071. 16s. for money alleged to have been paid by the plaintiff to the defendant's use. The defendant pleaded never indebted. Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Creasy appeared for the plaintiff,,and Mr. Edward James and Mr. Stammiers for the defendant. It appeared from the plaintiff's case that he had formeriy been a partner In the firm of Howell and James, carying on business in llegent-street, but owing to his speculations in mines he had got into diffculties, and his estate had been placed in tao hands of trustees. The plaintiff, the defendant, and a Maor Tindal were shareholders in the Cambourne Consols iine and being desirous of havingitcarriedon the borroved 5001. from the Royal Briti'n Bank upon their joint promissory note. The note was renewed several timres, and eventually the plaintift paid the whole amount, with the exception of a sum of 501. paid by Major TindaL F1rom that period up to the present the plaintiff had not asked the defendant for his share, but, bdng in want of it, he had directed his solicitor to wrte to the defendant for payment. The defendant answered by a letter, in which he said the plaintiff must be mad to make such aclaimagainst him,s andh that if he took any proceedingshe houd fie abil in hanery andwhe hecame up Criminal Court. Thisactionwasthenbought. Centr The pLaintiff was called in support of he case as stated by The defence, as appeeardfrom the evidence, was that in 1850 Major Tindal and the plaintiff, being desirous of advancing a sum of 5001. to the maine, applied to the Royal British Bank, who agreed to advance the required um pro. vided they had a Pnromissory note signed by three persons. The plaintiff and ^fisjor Tin0dal thtenrequested the defendant to put his name to the note,asuighmtbhehol incur soliabili ssuringhim that he shoulcl in o ty by so doing. He had accordingly signed his name upon these conditions, and he had heard nothing from that time until now - of the plaintiff's claim against His LoRDsnar', in summimg up, told the jury that generally when three persons signed a joint promissory note they would each be iiable for their share, yet that would not be so if one of them was induced to sign on condition that he was not to be called upon to pay it.

SOBERTS V. }ArdES. Sir F. ;ELLY fsaid, this was an appeal against the judg. ment of the Court of Queen's Bench upon a spedal ase. The declaration stated that the plaintiffs were possessed of a mnessuage and premises, and that there were certain founda. tions belonging to and supporting the mnessuages which the plaintiffs of right had enjoyed withouti hindrance or disturbance from may purpoe ; but that the defendants negli. gently, and without leaving sufficient support, worked certain mines under ground and near the premises, so that the messuames had sunk and given way, and were greatly injured, To this declaration there was a plea of "Not guilty," and that the plaintiffs had no right to enjoy the foundations. It had been agreed that the action should be argued upon a special"uase, which stated that the property in respect of injury to which the action was brought consted of some land, which until the paesing of an Inclosure Act, was waste land n ths nmanor of WeAtbromwch, and had been used as ordinary grzing tand, ad four houses stnding on part thereof. The Enclosure Act contained a proViSOa resesying certain rights and prisi~leae ef the 1rd of the manor, After thepwg of the As Xh ercIosure took place, and the land in question was allotted t, certain commoners, and th&elihuses werb erected on some, parts of that allotment. . hoeak thb'l ouses there vwasa seam of corl which belonged to certain-persons named ii the Act of Parliauent, and the defendants-worked the coal -pur. suance off the authority of lthosepersons.

The defendants' counsel haW submitted that the plaintiffs had maade-out no case, on the ground that thelord of the manorlada right to work the-mines without being rWeponsible for any injury. he -learned judge- had refused to, rloissuit, but gave ler,ve to mnove, and the learned judge -directed the jury that theI plaintiffis were entitled to. a verdict if they wvrersatisfied-the ijlury arose from theworldng of the coaL -The julyfound a verdict for the plaintiff, with 2,5001. damages.

' - The learned counsel now ce'ntendedhat this wras subtantially an action between the lord of the manor and the owner of an allotment under an Enclosure Act. The owner of the allotment under the Enclosur'Act halderected housea. upon thelanid, and the houses had: been erected 20 years before .the actihowas'oxiuenced. On the other.hand, the. io;1 of the manor claimed the rl,ht'to work' the mines. Themines and minerals were reserved to the lord of the manor, who had a ri8ht to work the mines. The whole question was this, whether, lookingat the terms of the Act'-of Parllament; and the' facts of the case, and the fanding of the Juxy, that the mines'were worked'in the ordinary way, without negligencei-the question was . whether; the mines being. reserved to the lord, he h4d'aa right to worl the mines after the Enclosure- Acts. a%nd in tbe same way as he was entitled to work the mines before the 3ncelosure Act, except where limited by the terars of the Act of Parliament.. He should contend that where under anEnclosure Act the soil was allottedto-commoners-in liete of .their rightsof commou, but the mines and minerals were reserved to the lord, that the lord retained the right to work .t.hose mines and to take those minerals, as he possessed tl%eright ab the tame andbefore the Enclosure Act, excepbt'o tEie' extent to which the EnClosure act deprived him of the right,'or qualified or restricted himni the enjoyment. The lord of the manor might dig and work his mines as reserved to him, and might go upon the land allotted to others, but upon which before the Act he might have entered, he makdng compenEation and satisfiction for any damage or injury which might arise, he usng every sldll and cautios and not being guilty of negligence. The effect of the Act of Parliament, starting vith the assumption that the soil passed to the allottees, was that the lord might work his mines subject, only 'to the intentions of the Act, one of which was that he should not open, dig, or sink, or carry on any work within a distance of 40 'azrds from any houses. The CEr JUSTiCE.-Then, -f working 45 yards from the house he brought down one house, inight he go on and bring down another ? Sir F. XELLYapprehended that he might, fsr the Act was only an agreement between the parties, They could not derogate from the rights of the lord. The Act assnmed the lord to work the mines in the ordinary manner. The mine in question was 300 yards beneath the surface. The lord might sell the surface, reserving to himself the mines and minerals, and that was the reasonable consthuction of the Act. The CHF JUST=o said he wished the Act had been more .explicit ; it left them very much in the dark. Sir F. ixr.y said a remedy' was given for damage by giving compensation. The CHis .JUSTIcE.-It did not give the compensation for working the mines, but for going upon the land cutting and digging, and erecting buildings. Sir F. Xry admitted that the lanouage of this par. ticular clause had reference to what was done by entering upon +,he land, but still the object was to give compensation for any daWmage that might arise by the working the mine. The CHIEF JUSs?raE.-That a man might follow a seam of coal although there was a house upon it you would Bay he was justified in bringing down that house I Sir P. K=y said he could not have done that before the Act; but the question was whether, after the Act, the lord was to be bound by the common law right or b7 the Act of Parliament. All that was not absoluteiy forbidden still remained. Baron asT -Under the surface there was animmense quantÂ£ty of something which was not either coal or mineraL *To whom would that something belong?9 sir F. Knasiy said he must read through the whole of the Act before he couldansawer. The C BARON.-Supposing after the coal was exhausted and some very valuable slate should be found, to whom' would that belong? Sir F. K ry said, 'as the reservation was only of coal and minerals, he supposed the slatewould belongto theallottees Power was given to the lordto work the mines, subject only to the restrictions in the Act mentiened, one of which was giving a right of action to the party injured if the mine was not properly worked, or was worked within 40 yards of the suirface, and power was given to the parties to go down and inspect the mines and workings. Where the rights of parties were defined and settled by an Act of Parliament a Cout of law would look only to that Act of Parliament and acb upon it. Mr. Alexander appeared on the other side, but was not called upon. The COuRT confirmed the decision of the Court below for the plaintiff, Judgment affirmed.

.-POLIcz. MANSIO0N-HIUSE.-Robert Maloney, aged 14 years, was charged with having stolen a pockethandkerchief from a gentieman named Callow. Mr. Callow, while walking along Leadenhall-street yesterday morning, felt a slight pull at his pocket, and immediat-ely afterwards saw the prisoner running na. y from hi among the horses and waggons to the other aide of the street. The prisoner then, finding that he was pursued, went up to a little boy, who was displaying the placards of a shopkeeper between two boards, aad tried to prevail upon him to take a handkerchief, which Mr. Callow at once identified; but, not being able to succeed in the attempt, he ran off 'with his prey and never stopped till he was caught by his pursuer. P;epry M'Cree, the boy who was between the boards, said,-iwvz standing with Mr. Hall's showboards opposite to the East India House, and I saw the prisoner Tun uD to the gentleman, raise up the skirt of his coat, and whi - the handkerchief out of the pocket. The prisoner then slipped the handkerchief into his own pocket, and ran across the road, dodging the gentleman right and left, and he then ehpped the handkerchief under my board, and I dropped it to thte Oezound, and he took it up and started off again as fastashe could, followed by the gentleman, who at last collared him. The Prisoner.-I didn't commit the robbery. It was done by another boy, who threw it off his own shoulders upon mine. The Holloway officer said that the prisoner, who had been long known to the police as a thief, was, notwithstanding his youth and size, a most dreadful character when in the gaol; and the wretched boy's mother appeared in the wit. ness-box in great afflction, and declared tha' it was quite absurd in her to attempt to make him better, and that he had only just left his comfortable home when she received information that he was taken up for robbery. Alderman RoSE said the only way of dealing with such a delinquent was to send hin for trial to the Old Bailey, where, no doubt, he would be sentenced by the Judge to undergo a wholesone discipline for three or four years. The prisoner was then committed for triaL Charles Murray, IS years of age, was charged with having stolen a pooket-book from Mr. Poore in Aldgate. The prisoner contrived to steal the pocket book while the prosecutor was calling for a cab, and ran down the Minories, where,he was stopped bya policeman, wbom he immediately knocked down, and with whom he struggled for a lorg time with doubtful success uantil another officer arrived. The pocket-beok was found at the prisoner's feet. Alderman RosE.-Well, prisoner, what have you to say? The Prisoner.-I am a sailor, not a regular thief. Alderman Ross.-I think you are a re ular thief The Prisoner.-No; but I certainly did this. I don't deny it. Alderman RoSn.-Youhave violently assaulted the policeman. The Prisoner.-I merely stumbled over him; we rolled over each other several times. I believe that's all; but I stole the pocket-book. They're rightthere. Alderman Rosz.-I believe you to be a very bad fellow, andI commit youto prison to hard labour for three calendar months. M&xoRY ouoH.-sTmwr.-Uizabeth Wilson and Flora Bsnting were brought up for further examination charged with fraudulently obtaining goods in the name of the Mr chionese of Salisbury. Mr. Lewis, of Great Marlborough-street, was for the prisoners, Mr. Adams, house steward to Lord Salisbury, proved that neither of the prisoners had been in the service of Lady Salisbury. He was acquainted with both Lord and Iady Salisbury's handwriting, and could say that the notes purporting to be written by Iady Salisbury, ordering goods from various tradesmen, were forgeries. Mr. James Shoolbred, of the firm of Shoolbred and Cook, anendrapers and mercers,Tottenham-court-road, received on the 15th inst.a note purporting to come from the Marchioness of Salisbury, and requesting some goods, whiclx were specified, to be sent to the waiting-room of the Great Northern station, where the parcel would be caled for by one of thL servants, Mr. Knight, one of the firm, said he packed up a parcel, but having his suspicions that the note was nor a genuine one, he put only one pair of gloves and a quantity of hay in the parcel, and then sent it to the Great Northern Railwray by a porter. Police-constable Lees, C 199, saw the parcel taken away by alad and delivered to the prisoner Baniting. William Munday, a lad, proved that the prisoner Banting stoPed hhin inthe street and asked him to go to the Grea iorthernl Eailwarq station and get a parcel irected to I.y Salisbuy. He did as desired, and, having got the parcel, lhe delivered it to Banthig who gave him 2d. for his trouble.

This girl, perhaps, may be a thief, and I will even go sofar asto basume that o be a fact yet, even the shee so, such treatment as this is monstros, and, instead of nnroving children, tends to brutalize them.

SOLJTRWARr.-Mr. Thomas Genge, the landlord of the Great Britain beershop, in the Waterloo-road, was charged with being concerned, with others, in stealing 40 sovereigns from Simon Nelson, an aged Prussian, with great violence, in the parlour of his beershop. MUr. Solomon defended the prisoner. The prosecutor, 'who spoke very good English, said, that he 'was a draper, and carried on business in St. Nicholas. square, Southampton. A few days ago he came up to LIondon to purchase goods, and, about 5 o'clock on the previous afteroon he was crossing London-bridge to return to his lodgings in Darham-streetr Keningtoa.lane, 'when a ScOtchman stopped him and asked him the way to some place.

I ? AMM-OL S ummry of the fdlloowing received by diceltio tolr. traph, appeared in ouT zecondedition of yesterday :-1 SOUTHAMPTOIg, AP=T 30. The steamship Ariel, Captain Ludlow, the flirf 'of the Vauderbilt new line of steamers, arrived this morning frora New York, which she left on the 16th, at 12.30 p.m. Her news is one day later than that received per Asia. The Ariel brings 24 pamsengers for Southampton, 68 for Havre, and 51 for Bremen, whither she sailed this evening. She has no specie or cargo. On her voyage the Ariel passed an Euglish steamship, No. 4,386, Marxyatt's signals, under second distinguishing pendant; and the American ships Gleaner, Brutus, Texas, and Alert. On the 29th, offthe 7 crd Point, she exchanged signals -with the Aimerican ship Zurich, from New York for Havre. The Arabia, mail steamer, from Liverpool, was Bignalled at New York on the 16th, ancd would be up at 2 p.m. A despatch from Washington of the 15th says:"The Administratimn have been officially advised by Messrs. Morse and Bowling of their usuccessfcl efforts to tret with the Government of leew Granada. The affairs of the isthmus were to-day a matter of Cabinet consultation, aund excluded all other subjects. Oar Governtment is resolved that American rights in that quarter shall be respected. It will shortly send thither four or five vessels, with such instructions to the commanders as will, it is believed, consummate the object and lead to the Eettlement of the existino difficulties. The Administration are determined to take a decided stand." The Secretary of the Navy had sent an order to Captain Hudson, of the United States? frigate Niagara, to receive on board Captain Swartz and Lieutenant Koblitz, of the Russian Imperial Navy, who, by the request of the RCussian linister, are permitted to go out in that vessel to witness the laying of the telegraph cable. In overhauling the ruins of one of the buildings burnt at the recent fire in Baltimore the bodies of seven persons, principally apprentice boys, were found, and it was thought that still others would be discovered. One of the injured had also died, making eight lives already known to be lost. The value of the property destroyed was estimated at $402,000. The proposals for building the steam revenue cutter ordered by the last Congress were opened at the Treasury Department, Washington, on the 15th. The bids ranged from $84,940 up to $150,000-the sum appropriated by Congress for the construction of the vessel. All the prominent New York builders were in for the contract, and it was believed it would be awarded to one of them. Stephen P. Hardenbrook, a policeman of the Ninth Ward, was assassinated on the morning of the 15th by one of two burglars whom he had arrested, they having just robbed a clothing store at No. 395, West-street. The assassins succeeded in effecting their escape. The Board of Councilmen adopted resolutions requesting the mayor to offer a reward of $1,000 for the apprehension of the murderer, and directing inquiry as to what relief from the treasury should be extended to the widowv and orphan of the deceased. The correspondent of the New York Herdall at NWassau, New Providence, writing on the 28th of March, reports the arrival of the French war steamer Newton at that port. As she is the first vessel of the Imperial navy which ever anchored at that portion of the Bahamas, her officers were received with much cordiality. It was thought that the report on the wrecking system which was lately forwarded to the Emperor was the cause of her sudden appearance. A storm of thunder and lightning had thrown down a church spire and caused other damage. The Legislature were still in session. The Militia would be disbanded. The steamer Tennesseearrived at New York onthe 16th, bringing details of Lockridge's defeat. She touched at San Juan on her return from Aspinwall. ]Lockridge, with the steamers Rescue and Scott, and 300 men, reached Castillo on the 28th of March, but finding the enemy strongly posted there with 500 men, and several large guns, he retreated without striking a blow. On his retreat Colonel Lockridge destroyed all the fortifications below Castillo, having abandoned all hope of opening the river; and also disbanded his two battalions. He subsequently formted a new one, and would endeavour to reach Walker vid Panama. The boiler of the steamer Scott exploded near Serapigui during the retreat, killing and wounding S0 officers and men. These were sent to Punta Arenas in the steamer Rescue. Lockridge still remained up the river with his remaining force. He was well supplied with provisions. The sales of cotton on the 15th, at New Ycrk, embraced about 2,000 bales. No less than three private telegraphic despatches were received from New Orleans, dated April I5, which gave the receipts of cotton in four days at 8,000 bales, and stated that the total deficiency of receipts at all the ports amounted to 381,000 bales; they quoted middlng at 13*c. to 14c. Freight at 3s. 8d. to ls. 4d. sterling. Exchange at 8i to 9; sight bills on New York at 11 discount, and 60 days' ditto at 1 ditto. Owing to favourable accounts from Europe, together with light stocks of flour, and a good local and eastern demand, the, market improved Sc. per barrel; and for Ohio and Southern, wanted for export, 6c. to 10c. per barrel, with more doing. Southern white wheat sold at $1 G0c., and red ditto at $1 44c.; corn, under the influence of thenews and reduced stocks, improved from 2e. to 3e. per bushel, with a fair amotunt of sales. Pork was irregular and sales light at $22 60c. to $22 75c. for new mess, closing at about $22 62c. offered, and $22 75c. asked. Sugars advanced in price, with sales of about 1,000 hhds., 2,000 boxes, and 4,000 bags; the latter for export. Coffee was firm; sales of about 3,500 bags Rio. Rice was excited and, with an increased export demand and reduced views regarding the yield of the late crop, prices advanced from jo. to gc. per lb. The sales embraced about 3,000 casks, including about 1,800 for export. Freights were inactive, being checked by the light stock of breadstuffs and advance In prices, while rates were unchanged. The tea sales embraced chiefly greens, and though some less spit was manifested, and a good many lots withdrawn, all sold brought full prices. The tendency of prices in thas Stock-market was upward at the first beard, with a more limited novement; at the Board of Brokers a slight advance was realized.

The General Commanding-in-Chief. in Scotland considering it incompatible, in the present state of the regiients of Artillery, that colonels should hold what may be considered the command of a lieutenant-colonel, has decided to relieve Colonel Warde of the command of the Royal Artillery there. It is stated that a couple of regiments will be stationed at Pembroke Dockyard in lieu of the present four-company battalion now doing duty there, and that this measure is contemplated in consequence of the duties of the establishment falling with severity on the depots, which are inadequate to guard the extended ground over which the pbsts lie. The staff and the first depob battalion are to be removed to Newport, Monmouthshire. Two more first-class frigates will be launched in the course of theseasonfromPembrokeDockyard. The Melpomeneand ImmortalitK have been lengthened to the extent of 50 feet, by cutting them in two and lengthening them amidships to the extent of 32 feet, and by the stern and bows 13 feet and 5 feet respectively. They now rank as 51-gan frigates in lieu of 60's, for whioh they were originally intended, as sailing frigates. Their engines are to be of 600-horse Dower, and their length will be 240 feet. An Admiralty order has arrived at Sheerness to diseontinue the fitment of the paddlewheel steamship Terrible for assisting the Agamemnon in laying down the transatlantio telegraph cable. This order has been received in consequence of the extensive nature of her defects, all of which are now ordered to be made good previous to her being put oat of dry dock. The Cyclops, 6 guns, paddlewheel steam frigate, commisdoned for particular service connected with the transatlantie telegraph cable, has been fitted and rigged. An Admiralty order has arrived at Sheerness to pay off the Cressy on her arrival there.

THE PAY OF THE ARMY. TO TE13 EDITOR OF THE TMES. Sir,-The second article in your impression of the 28th of April, like several of the same nature which have recently preceded it, must convey to the patriotio mind feelings of no common gratulation on the wise and liberal measures which have produced such results and prosperity to the nation at large. But while the large members are thus amply accommodated, allow me to state that the shoe pinches very sorely some of tho little toes. Those who have small and fixed incomes feel the effect of the rise of prices and the general affluence which lowers their own position; but still worse is it for those who have not liberty, but conventional rules, for the expenditare of their limited allowance; and such are military officers. I am not going to demonstrate the absurdity of the attempt of an unmarried subaltern to live upon his pay of 951. 16s. 3d., or 1181. 12s. 6d. per annum, as the recent spread of information on military subjects must have fixed this as an axiom in the minds even of respectable mechanics; and an able letter has recently appeared in your columns which sets forth with extreme truth and accuracy the expenses of an officer living as a gentleman. But are there not strong reasons why this should be altered? For the maintenance of the respectability of a regiment a subaltern must expend half his pay on his dinner alone. Hlow this supports the standing of the individual officer, who has in consequence to leavo unpaid bills for many other items, I need not answer. The living of subalterns who vainly. try to keep out of debt and rnn is miserably bad-a scanty breakfast, and, nine hours afterwards (drllls and exercise included), the mess dinner, at which I have often seen some fearful of indulging in the expense of a glass of beor ! This will support a great deal of mental and physical capability, Su'rely. The ensign, while sticking at his 951. per annum, finds young men everywhere around him better off than himself and those in the civil service of the Crown receiving annual additions to their pay, which they can spend as they please. If in their desire ?or military improvement the publfi- wish theirofficersto posses the ability, knowledge, and activeand energeticqualitieswhichhaverecentlybeenloudly paraded as the necessaries of ovr military system, they must not crush their spirits against the hard rocks of gecuniary impossibilities at the beginning of their career, but be prepared to pay for those requites according to the position in the social scale which their possessors occupy. It has never been mooted by seiisible persops that this should be lowered, and it cannot be maintained for less than 1501. per annum for a subaltern to live upon, which will still require pru dence in its expenditure and allov for no extravagance. The wealthy, who have no interest in obtaining an increase in the officers' pay, need not fear that the above trifling minimum will wrest from their grasp the best positions or the service those are theirs as long as England is aristocratic and wealtby and commercial, and while the purchase system exists; but it is indecorous that the allowance to a British officer should only enable him to starve on a miserable " subsistence," when " the labourer is worthy of his hire," and " where there's a will there's a way" to remunerate him. I am. Sir. wan-.I1- - A ~SUBAITERX OR 11 VP.ATPQ' wrnr April 29.

FASHIONABLE SINS. TO THIE EDIT0R OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-It is a mockery that while our lords and ladies, and their brothers and cousins, the bishops, are preaching charity in Exeter-hall and forming societies for the protection of workwomen and the conversion of Hottentots, they should not form one for the " Suppression of Extravagant Wicked. ness in ligh Places." Too true are the observations of your celebrated correspondent, "S. G. 0.," in your to-day's paper. May I add a practical commentary to it,-a true story? There was six months ago a celebrated shop, called " Harding's." Everyone about town knew that fashionable resort in Pall-mall. From the Queen downwards, It was the high place for high-dress. True, the prices were high likewise; but, then, as the fair 7umbitu6es werewont to say "' You know the workwomen are well paid, well fed, and well treated; there is no slavery there." Yet one day last November the house was dosed. How was this? An excellent connexio,3 great reputation, an old-establshed house, -with great capital originally to back it, it had been losing money for years, How coiud this be? It was for this reason,-because these ladies-the highest and fairest of our land-whose names figure in endless charitable societies, who pay homage to 3xs. Beecher Stowe as the thorn in the side of slavery, and fall down aind wor ship Bishop Lawnsleeves as the regenerator of evangelical religion-because these ladies would not pay their milliners' bils. The Queen could set a good and noble example, and I think it right to mention it. She could pay regularly every quarter for what she required; but three years at oonest was soon enough for the duchess and maost of the rest of thetrain of silk-and-satin-loving beauties. How wa3 it possible for any business to answer where the capital oould omly be turned over once in three years, unless the staff were underpaid for overwork, and the poor girls scrowed down to a neede-and-thread slavery that flesh and blood revolt at? The house stops. The good debts, long, long incurred, amount to many thousands, the doubtful debts are greater, the bad debts more extensive still. But such noble namees If this be the case with large house;, what must be the cse with the smaller establishnsents? - Unluckily for me, an unwilling creditor, the assets, the books, and the facts have been put into ray. bands. Bat the books and the facts have swept away, with their hash and cruel reality, that fair dream Ihad from my boyhood of English true nobility. And were the bodbk, or rather the black list, published, as it deeerves t. be, as much as Wd balance-sheel of the Royal British Bank, it would be seen that our English Mlcsare as extravagant as some baxoneta nnd honotirtles are nnprncipled, and, that, though t16h cau'abuy, they ,iu noh pay-thotgh tliey cn3 preacb, -they willl tot pravtise. -- ''-.: - ' -- I iD Sir: tour ohadifn tea,,sat. - ~X A- EiQlIxH OLF4JMYKAN A~M 4.
OR AND. I ,TIPPERAY BANK LaTIGaATTO DUBLIN. TsnXk M X (nmol oUR OwN 0OR-PIWRAI'm7mmA J3e rZdowing. is an abetrset of the juOgmjn4Y given by the LIord Chancee1e yesterday, by wvhich. Mr. Vincent Seully is released (for the present at leist) from his liability to be placed on the list of coittiitories to the Tiperary BEDk. It is said that two eminent nenbets of the English Chane bar, have given a stong opinion i vour of th judgmeMntspreviou ly pronounced by the Chancellor in' the cases of dIess Hone and Sterling, both of whom ihared the good fortune of i Scilly bt he erasure of theinamesfromthedisil list of contributors. When the case w calld '~TeChancellor aidic, that it 6auxe* before him as -an appeal frmthe deedson of his Honour, 'whq hAd- affirmed therrhlip of Master Marphy, so,far as it -WeAt, to hbld'tbe appellant; Mr. Vincnt Scully, a contributbry to the Tip. perr Bank.' It wascoontended, on'the part of Mr. Soully, thkt = a w snot able,.inpintoflav,tobtGlaoed unonthe list of contributors= inasmucl as.he had legilly transferred Wii shares' an hbig name was retnoved from theo list as the ow:er ofZte shares hehadpreviously'-held, andthe name of Mi. Kettinge gubatituted; and if that were the, entire of the casp he (the Chancellor) could not for ai moment hesitate to exonerate W. Scery from liability; but tLbre was more in, thb case 'which it would bo necessiry for him shortly to referto, Upon rthe partof the offiial manager it was contended thAt there never was, in fact,b a bond fdet andvlid transfer of the shAre in question to Mtr. Keatinge'; and tbat, supposing there had been a transfer, it was a transaction. of-such a natureas still left Mr. Bodiy in the positioa of She legal owner, and therefore liable as a contributory. In the first place, as regarded the transfer of the shares if Mji. Scully was an ordinary shareholder, who had no other connLexion with the bank but that of shareholder, and that he had transferred his shares, as stated, and got his name removed, and that of the trausferree inserted in its place, ho (the Chancellor) thought that it would be clear that his lega lhiaility had ceased; bat it was said that he stood in a different position from an ordinaryshareholder, having been a director of the hank for several years, and never having dive=ed himself of the ichaacter of director, so as to free him from - the pition of a trustee. Now, there was no doubt hut that MnScully was a director, hut it was equally' clear that he was not one of the original directors. - Hi was elected about the year 18I8 at the annual meeting of the banlr, which took place shortly after the death of another gentleman named Scully, and he remained a director for some yeam and onie of the questions was when, if ever, did he ewseto be a director? The 80th sectiosiof the dee'dof the company provided that no director, exepting the mainagmng or honorary directors, should hold his appoint3ment,b ond the next annual neeting unless re-elected; so that Mr. Scully was only director for a year after his first appointment ; and to makie him a director aftrwards he should have boen re-elected at each annual meeting, but that was not done, for it appears that he was never reelected at any meeting subsuent to his original election, although it wvas also equally clear that, 'without going through the form of re-election, he alloweed his name to be put forward as a director on sabsequent occasions, and down to the period when he became alarmed as to the safety of the ban. He was first appointed a director in February, 1848, and in the year 1854 he wr-ote to Mr. James Sadlelr, dechning to be a director thereafter; and even if elected after that it would not, in his (the C6hancellor's) opinion, be a vaRd election. Upon this eidence the Master of the Rolls overruled the Master, and held that Mr. Scully was nht to ho considored a director afcer the meeting held sub, sequent to the date of this letter, and he (the Chancellor) agreed with his Honour upon that part of the case. The question then came round to the transfer to Mr. Keatinge, and whether there was anything in that transaction from which Mr. clly u shlould be still considered as liable; and that depe nd on the construction of theinstiru ment executed on tha occasion of th a transfer. The instru ment in question was anagreement to sell the shares to Mr. Sadleir for 11,000;.,. to be paid in the year 1857.

The questo a was, whether upon the terms of the deed it was competent to place on the lst of contributories 50 persons who transferred oertain shares, and pass by the party holding the shares? That was a proposition which he (the Chancellor) did not find affirmed by any case; on the contrary, the authorities were all the other way. The contract between Messrs. Scully and Sadleir was not made with the company, and there was no privity between Mr. Scully anLd the company to the effect that he was to receive the dividend th and therefore he (the Chancellor) did not see his way o hld he ppelasi hale s acontributory, solely because he might thae a lienon tahem .

CHUJRiH-2 ATES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I haveread with great sarprise theletter of "W- A." inZour Tuesday's number. Though "W. A." professes to be a isssenter, he is evidently but very imperfectly acquainted with the grounds upon which Dissenters object to the payment of church-rates; nor does it requiro very much of that "keen perception," for the possession of which he gives Dissenters credit, to show how utterly impossible is the adoption by them of the plan he proposes. Dissenters object to pay church-rates on two grounds,first, because the proceeds of them are devoted to the sappert of a religious system which, in their opinion, is not in harmony with the word of God; and secondly, because the method of collecting them is compulsory, and not voluntary. The plan of your HRomerton correspondent meets the former of. these obj%ction% bat leaves entirely untouched the latter, which is by far the most serious objection of the two. HIs plan is still more objectionable from the fact that, so far as the rates collected in accordance with it should ba Applied to the support of Dissenting places of worship, it would be ado.pting on the part of Dissenters of the very Vrinciple agamst which they are so earnestly contending,r dourse which, I am sure, the Nonconformists of England would indignantly refuse to take. I quite agree with"W.A.'"that none of theplansproposed lately will meet the views of Dissenters, and also that it is the height of injustice that, as Nonconformnists, we should rot only be excluded from all use of these national stractures, hut should he made to assist in keeping them in repair for the sole benefit of the "most numerous and wealthy religious body existing." Your known impartiality makes me hope that you will allow of the insertion of the above. I aÂ«m vrn,va kt-e A. T. Ardiff, April 29. TO THE EDITOP OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I venture to call your attention to the circumsuace that the scheme of repayment to Dissenters of such portion of the church-rates as they had contributed, mentioned by y'our correspondent " W. A" in his letter on chmrch-rates in your paper of the 23d was also suggested by me in my harge to the clergy of this archdeacoury on the 21st arLd 22d, of which I beg to enclose you a copy, referring you to - }ave the honour to be, Sir, your obedient. servant.

T- n KI )DE INSTEX RIoTS.-It will be remen1bered that after the riot at the last election at Ridderminster, and the bratal attack upon Uir. Lowe and his friends as they were returning from the polling booth at the close of the election, auracdress to Mr. Inwe was subscribed by a largonumberof the raspeotable inhabitants of Kidderminster, expressing their indignation at the condact of the mob, aid their sympathy with Mr. Lowe in his sufferings. to that address Mr. Lovve has just made the following ;eply:-" To Mr. J. Kiteley, Mayor of Kidderminster, and 314 other gentlemen signing an address to me. Gentlemen,-I thaink you cordially for the genuine expression of your sentiments and sympathy which you lave placed in my hands, the more valuable because based on your conviction that nothing has emanated from me calculated to provoke the slightest ill-will, or to irritate or excite the humblest individual. I should indeed have been inexcusable had it been otherwise, for, with a certainty- of success, it vas my interest, as well as my duty, to avoid ail occasion of offenoe to opponents whom I might one day not unreasonably hope to number among my supporterg. In looklng over this address I am pained to recognize the names of many persons who have received severe -injuries in the attempt to protect me, and of some others whose property has suffered considerable damage. I am happy to take this occasion of returning my since thanks for services so invaluable rendered at so beavy a sacTifice, and to express a hope that those who rendered them may never again be called upon to suffer any. thing on my-account. I know not the motive of the attack upon me, bixt- one effect I beg to assure you it wvill aot have o long ag I retain the confidence hitherto extended to me liy my constituents, nomnenaces of physical violeeo wMill deter mefrom egam slciting their surages, or induce me to change my resolution to stand by them so long as they are willing to support me.
