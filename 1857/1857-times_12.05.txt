THE LAxCASHiiE DAxp YORKSHIERLE RAILWAY LNSURANCE COMnPANY.-At a recent meeting of the Lan. cashire and Yorkshire Railway Board the directors, finding that leas than a thousand out of upwards of 5,000 of their servants had omitted to become members of rn insurance society established in connexion with the company, making a pro. vision for the payment of a sum of money in cases of death to the surviving family, and of a weekly allowance in cases of disablement through accident, passed au o-der to compel the whole of their employ6s to join the institution or to leave the service. it appears the directors pay 4001. a-year to the fends of the institation, and the subscription of workmen Is so small as to be scarcely felt by them. The adoption of such a resolutioLn was singularly vindicated a few days after it was passed. A man employed in one of their workshops was injured by an accident on the very day his name was inscribed on the books, and died the following day. His widow and children became entitled, under the rules, to the Sum of 371. lOs. The amount of his, snbaorip. thon ' Aecnzo thli benefit would be only 3d. per week,
TEE LBVIATfRlAZN. Soon after daylight yesterday morning Mr. Brunel, with Captain Jarrison, and his indefatigable chief assistant, Mr. Prowse, were again busy at MiUwall superintending the efforts by which the Leviathan is worked down slowly to the water, inch bv inch and foot by foot. The ship has now completely quitted every part of the old foundations on which the waa built, and the entire of her vast bulk and stupendous weight rest on the new launching ways alone. The most sinister rumours have Eat times been in circulation as to the disastrous result which might be anticipated when this event should happen, but as far as can be judged from the effect upon the ways at present the firmness with which they bear the vessel up exceeds the most sanguine expectations, and quite justifies the remarks which have been made by engineers that, next to the ship itself, the launching ways are the best piece of work in the yard. Their construxetion was contracted for by the Messrs. Treadwell, and, considering the nature of the ground they had to work upon, and the severty of the test which they have since withstood, their strength and rigidity may be considered as realy astonishing. The Leviathan was first pushed utpon them on Thursday afternoon, and so remained throughout the night, yet so little had the timber yielded under the tremendous pressure, that in the very first attempt to move the ship yesterday she instantly slipped seven feet. She made this great step with the same easy gliding motion as heretofore, with an almost total absence of friction on the metals, and with only the usual hollow, solemn, reverberating noise like very distant thunder. These slips, however, are scarcely productive of any great gain in- the day's work, for, the stern being much heavier than the bows, the cradle under that portion descends much maore rapidly, and so turns both cradles on the ways that an immense pressure is required again to start her. Thus, yesterday. morning, after one of these slips, she displayed the most unyielding obstinacy. Tl'he taco from the river, the screw jacks and hydraulic machines, were taxed to their utmost, the latter especially;, to such an extent that first a 1-inch cylinder, and next a 7-inch one, gave way, and ripped, the solid iron from top to bottom under the intense pressure which was exerted in them. These mishaps, however, only occasioned a temporary delay, and a renewal of the efforts, after a time, at last got another start out of the nhip, and so she continued throughout the day, dropping from six to ten inches each time, till diuk, when the men left off, and the signal boards showed a progress of nearly 31 feet for the day's work. The afternoon's tide yesterday placed about four feet of water under her keel, and so lightened the ways of about 1,500 tons of her dead weight; but apparently this made not the least difference in her rate of progress. There seems now not the least reason to doubt but that by Tuesday or Wednesday next the lautch wiU be entirely completed. It is reported that the fall of the scaffolding outside the yard on Thursday injured very many more people than were then conveyed to the hospital, and that the number of persons in the neighbourhood who are suffering from contusions, internal injuries, and slight conessious of the brain, received on that occaion, is considerable. It seems surprising that the police should not have interfered to prevent a scaffolding not fit to bear 20 with safety from being crowded with at least a hnndred people.
BRIGADIRB JOHNSTONIE. TO THB EDITOE OF TE[E TIMES. Sir,-The caution with which you accept and publish information, and the consequent correctness of the information published by you, justify the public in the strong faith they accord to the statements that find place in your well-filled columns, and that faith is increased and strength. ened by the readineqs withwhich you grant opportunity for explanation or correction where a emisstaenent of fact bas found eirca.ation through your universally read journal. An appreciation of these circumstances emboldens me to crave from X on the insertion in The imes of the following explanations:- Your numbers of the 24th and 26th of October contained an admirable summay of the early events in the mutiny in Ind remarkable for its comprehensiveness, Its distnctnes, and, Ibelieve, Its general correctness. There are, however,in itm5sstiatemenbaAs to matters of fact relative to the occarrences at the station of Jullundur of a nature much to prejudice the professional character of my brother, Brigadier Montague Johnstone, who commanded at that stautua, and I crave from aou the opportunity of correcting those misstatements; in doing so Ishall confine myself tQ the statament of facts, leavlig the Inferences to be drawn by such of your readers as may take interest in the matter. Your correspondent dates his letter from Umballah; I am justified thereby in supposing that he was not an e3e-wttness of the scenes at Jullundur, but received his information thence at second hand. He commences his statement of the occurrences at that station with the assertion that ' At J"llundur and the neighbouring station of Phillour were a strong native brigade and Her Majesty's 8th Regiment, with some Artillery." It is true that there was at Jullundur a strong native brigade comr sed of the Clst and 36th Bengal Infantry, a regiment of ;ative Cavalry, and some Native Artillery. It is not true, however, trat Her Majesty's 8th Foot was there, the body of the regiment having been sent to Delhi to join the force beleapring that city, leaving only a wing, about 200 men, for the proection of Jullundur. Of the Artillery, about onehalf v'as native, and so much distrusted that in the crisis of the mutiny they were ordered to the rear and to withdraw the chaw ges from their guns by the officer commanding the Your correspuondent next pays a tribute to my brother's "amli bility, zeal, and courage." The two latter qualities he indeed eminently displayed in the Caffre war in South Africa; the former has won for him the affection and esteem of all who have served, with or under him, or had the oppcrtUnity of familiar acqupintancuo with him; but he chargee him 'with "over-indulgence to natives to an infatuated degree." On what foundation this charge is made I krnow not; as his, infatuation has never betrayed him into any exuressions of favour affection, or sympathy in his cosrespondence with me, I beleve it to be a gratuitous assumption made for the occasion. He then proceeds to state that "He hedtated, took the treasure from the native guard, restored it again, declined to comply with instructions to place it under the Europeans." My brother was free from ouch vacilations; during bis absence the guard of the treasure had been tPken from the natives by the officer second in command, my brother disapproved this, restored it to the natives, and consistently continued it under their guard; they were faithful to their trust to the last-not one farthing of the treasure 'was olundered. The next charge is that he " settled to disarm the Sepoys, then putit offand gavethem one daymore." The "oneday mre 'was given to the European officers-not to the Sepoys, The commanding offcers of the 30th and 61st Native infentry having entreated my brother not to parade the regiments on the Sabbath for the purpose of disarming them; both being confdent in the loyalty of their men, and the latter pledging his life for the fidelity of his regiment, sayingthey only required the order, and they would instantly lay down their arms Then follow the heaviest charges against my brother, first that he delayed several hours to pursue at all ;" s. condly, that "he halted after marching 10 or 12 mil's." There was no delay the mutineers, having beenidriven back and discomfited Dy a discharge of grape, stole away in the obscurity of a dust wind; three hours were busily occupied in the necessary preparations for following them, during which time the tbominissarlat obtained carriages for tbe men's ammunition and rations, and the artillerywas harnessed and got under way. Within three hours after the direction taken by the mutineers was discovered the European force was in full pursuit. After a 10 miles' march, under an Indian sky (the troops having been under arms the whole of the previous night), the wearied troops were halted, but halted solely for nece-eary rest and refreshment; the march was again resumed and 16 miles further accomplished to Phillour, the whole march of 26 miles being accomplished by Europeans in the hot month of June witbhn 15 hours. It is true, as afterwards stated, that at the passage of the Sutlej there was a delay in the adavnce, partly in consequence of the bridge having been broken down, bnt party in disrespeot of my brother's instructions to the officer commanding the advance, and who alone can give the explana tion for his delay. Nevertheless the conduct pursued and steps taken were effective in saving the stations of Jul. londur, PhiUlour, and Loodianab from pillage and dest-ruc- Ihave the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient JAMES JOHNSTOI-M Alva Hose, Stirling, Dec. 3.
POST-OFFICE LoNnox DUIEcToRy Fop. 1858.- The present edition of the Post.-offia London Directory is the 59th annual publication of the work. It is so well hkiown that it is almost superfluous to say a word in commendation of it, but with all the care displayed in its former production opportunities have been taken this year tomnake urther corrections and improvements. This Directory forms a most accuiste and trustworthy guide to the trade, commerce, and public and private buildings of the great metropolis. The Court, the aristccracy, the gentry, and the learned professions all find due classification. In short, whatever be the profession, the trade, or the street respecting which information may be desired, this work forms a comprehensive, immediate, and accurate clue to it. Increased attention seems to have been bestowed upon every department. The typographical arrangements have been improved, and the volume is altogether so got up that it is handsome in appearance as ,well as usef l. Oce advantage is that the size of the volume is somewhat reduced, althongh there is no diminution in the extent of the varied details whioh it supplies. The corrections have been made to the latest period. er instance, although the nea Conservancy Board was only formed tow ards the end of November, a complete list of itS oflicers is given in the ofliCial Directory. Sunch is also the case in regard to various other changes effected by time and circumstances. Last, not least, the work contains an elaborate and accurate map of L9rdon and its suburbs.

Tim U tEAMCT ING Dixsryi.-nThe acounts from the mnanufacturing districts this week do not exhibit much improvement on the whole. At somne placss the mills are running longer hours than t3fore, but in the great ma30nty of cases the number of operatives out of, work is quite as great as last week, and there is a decided increase in the aggregate amount of pauperism. At Ashton only three mills are raDning full time, the number of appiscants for parish relief largely exceeds the num. ber of the previous week, and the small shop. keepers are suffering severely. At Blackburn a per. ceptible improvement in the state of trade is reported, the wills are running longer hours, and there is an increase of only seven in the inmates of the union. The trade of Birmingham is represented to be rather more depressed than at the close of last week. At many of the establishments the hauds have not been maldng more than three or four days a-week, while the number of persons out of work is inereasing. At Bolton trade continues depressed, and there is an addition of 164 outdoor poor on the number of the previous week, and an excessof 681 as compared with the correspondingweek of last year. At Barndey basiness continues in much the same state as last week, and there is not much additlonaldistresstoreport. AtBelfrt the Ilaxepinners have struck on account of a proposed reduction of wages, and b-etween 2,000 and3,000 persons are out of work. At Carlislo the pressure is baginning to be severely felt. In one district of the town there are 693 persona, including women and children, who are entirey without the means of subisitence. The total number of persons out of work is 1,200. Active measures are being taken for the relief of the most destitute. The mWs in the district of Dukinfield are working longer tlme, and it is confidently stated that several will soon commence running full time. At Chor. ley the cotton mills and power looms are all workingshorttime, except one, which is closed. AtDundee there have been two small failures, and trade contianes to wear a dull aspect. At Liverpool there is a considerable number of the worldng clamses out of employment. At Manchester about 10,000 persons are in the receipt of parish relief, showing an increase of nearly 600 on the number of the preceding week, but there is nevertheless a decrease of 881 persons entirely out of work. At Moseley there are 15 mills working short time, and one stopped, the number of hands in pattial employmrent being 4,390. At Middleton and its neighbourhood distress iY on the increase, and the trade shows no signs of improvement. A reli6f committee, under the presidency of the Rev. Canon Durford, is actively engaged in disunsing relief. At Oldham the condition of the working cdlsses is Dot at all im proved; there is an increase of 184 persons in the receipt of parish relief as compared with the preceding week. At Preston some of the miUs have extended their hours ef work, and ono firm-Messra Lancaster rnd Shawe-have ditributed a liberal supply of loaves of bread among their workpeople, who are sufthring for lack of employment. In the distric of Rosendale short time and much privation continue. Trade in the Potteries of Staffordshire ls rather improved, but the coal trnde of North Staffordshire is n-z ch depressel. Noticehas been given by the coal proprietors of their intention to reduce the wages of the miners 6d. per day. At Sheffield most of the manufacturing establishments are on short time, but the pressure is not so great here as at other places. At Saddleworth there iY severe distress, many of the woollen mills and cotton factories running three days a-week, and a great number of the working classes are deprived of the necessaries of life. AtfStaleybridge things wear an improved aspect. At Wolverhampton the depresson is not so great as basbeen represented. In thelock trade good work is in funl demand, and the trade generally is well off for orders. The naand tube trades are co-uparatively brisk. There is no increase of the demand for relief at the workhouse. The iron trade throughout the west district of Wales is very dul ; several of the works are on short time, aud wages are about to be reduced. There are numerous orders on hand, but the manufacturers are afraid to execute them until confidence is restored.

The Bisho of Oi:FO3kD, ereeivlng that a noble lord -h ad rnv ddLha b ill on the previous evenig, and tbt stodtor a moond readig on MIiiulay evening, wished to ask whetker, notwithstanding the understanding that the present brief preliminarr session should be devetcd to the consideration oftheones ubject which had been the cause of it, the noble earl intended to' prooeed so suhmmarily with a measure of such great importance to the church. The EArl of SHAEESBUY had been no party to any such understanding as was alluded to by the rightrev. bisho. TheBill wassa very short one, comprising only two clauses, and was a very small remedy for a very great eviL It was his intentfou to ask their lordahips to read the Bill a second time on Monday next. The Bishop of ST. DAVID'S thought that in a matter affecUng the interests and organization of the church time should have been ven to his ight rev, brethren to examme the propostons contined En the Bill, and he could othut conider that an attempt to precipitateany such common decency. reason or The EArl of ELLENBOROUGH said it reaJty did appear to him that to read such a Bill on Thursday, and to ask for the second reading on Monday,was rather sharp practice. The Bishop of OXFORD strongly protested against the preclpitatlon with which the noble earl (Lord Shaftesbur) seemed disposed to urge on the discossion of the BilL Its had not as yet been printed, and their lordships were totlly unacquainted with its provisions The noble earl had, it was true, communicated in private to his Grace the Archbishop of Ctnterbury the heads of the measure, but the expediency of postponing its discuEsion had been most srongly pressed upon him by that most rev, prelate, who had, moreover, been instructed by the bishops of England to give expression to the strong feeling with respeot o the PrOpriety of time being a&orded for the due consideration of so important a measure which theyentertained. (AlanghonthepartofLordShaftesbury.) The laughter of the noble earl was not quite so potent as he ight thiuik, and would not certainly produce the effect of .uing him (the Bishop of Oxford) to withdraw a sinRle syable of the statement which he had just made. The question of proceeding with the Bill had been disecssed the y before at a meeting of the bishops of England, and he should repeat that his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury had been instracted by the right rev, prelates assembled at that meeting to represent to the noble lord the indecency of endeavourlng to steal a march upon them by the course which he haad aopted in reading the Bill M first time on the pening night of the session, when very few members of their ordslp't fHouse were in attendance. That was the rsode in which the noble lord hadthought proper to act, seeking to settLe the questionwith which theu prov)poedto deal solely by means of his own autocratic wisdom, without giving the blshops of the Church of England the slightest cance of becoming acquainted with the nature of that new r6vimc to which he seemed to wish the parochial distrioto of England to be subjected. The whole qustion involved in the mensre was one of principle, not of detail, and he (the Bishop of Oxford), for one, ws not prepared to say whether or not he should give his aent to the noble earl's principle. He could only say that it was one which demarded the utmost consideration at their lordships' hands, inasmuch us it sought to effect an altention in the existing syrtem by means of which the bishop of a dioceas would be empowered to send a strange clergyman of the Church of England into the parish or another clergyman to preach in that pariah without the leave of the incumbent. It might be expedient to introduce such a system, but into that ques. tion he would not then enter, but should content himsellf with renewing his protest against the indecent haste with which the noble earl proposed to hurry on the Bill through their lordampe' House at a period when msny right rev, prelates were compelled to be absent from their seatsian oonsequecew of engagements which they could not abandon. (Hear, hear.) Earl GRANVILLE said it appeared to him that the noble earl had been most unjustly attacked upon the present ocoesion, and had been addr-ea by the right rev. prelate who had just sat down in a tone which was not, to say the least of it, that which was beet calculated to induce his noble friend to refrai; from presdng the BiU to a second reading on Monday next. (Eear, hear.) He (Earl Gran?ille) did not quite like the strong epithets which had been applied to the eonduct of his noble ftriendEby the right rev, prelate, but he would at' the same timie beg the noble eal to consider whether it was expedient that he should fix so early a day as Monday next for the discussion of an important measure of the provisions of which their lordships knew absolu ely nothing. (Hear, hear.) He should only say that, in his opinion, his noble friend was perfectly ustified by the forms of that House in moving the first reading of the measure as he had done on the prvious evening. The Bishop of OXFORD.-When the noble earl states that he does not like the strong epithets which he says I used he will I trust do me the justice to bear in mind that when I first rose to address the noble lord opposite the question which I put to him I did so in the most courteous terms. It was not until after the refusal of the noble lord to abstain-notwitbstandng the representations which have been omade to him-from presng on the second reading of his BiU on Monday next that I used those expressions of which the noble earl near ebut which I do not consider to be over strong ueraltecircumstances of the case. The Earl of DUZIGANNON urged upon the noble lord the propriety of postponing the second reading of the measure unti their lorashipe generally were more fully acquainted with the nature of its provisions. After a simlar appeal from Lord C,ti.PBELL, The EArl of SHAFTESBURY, in reply to the observations of the Bishop of Oxford, said that it was true that his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury had communicated with him the day before on the subject of his Bill; bat he must add that he had done so in terms of coartesv and kindness, and had not suffered the word "indecency " even once to fall from his lips. ("Hear, hear," from theo Bishop of Oxford.) He was glad to find that the word was acknowledged to be the property, not of his Grace, but of the right rev, prelate opposite (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) But, passing from the observations of the right rev, prelate, he wished simply to state that, acting upon the suggestion which had been made to him by the noble lords who had ut spoken he should not press the second reading of the Br1 on Monday, but that for his own justification and the information of the country at large he should upon that occasion enter into an explanation of its objects, deferring the second reading to a future day. (Hear, hear.) The lIouse then, at half-past 5 o'clock, adjourned until Monday.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, FRIDAY, Dzc. i The SPE&xxR took the chair at4 o'clock. PATRIOTIC FUND (COLONIES). Lord A. CHURCHILL moved for returns of the amount oontributed by each of the colonies respectively toward the Patriotic Fund, distinguishing the sums voted by their different Legislatures from the amounts frmished by voluntary subscriptions; and of the number of Russian guns taken during the late war vhich have been distributed as trophies among the different eolonies, specifying the number sent to each colony. Agreed to. BISHOPS AND CATHEDRAL ESTABLISHMENTS IN INDIA. Colonel SYKES moved for a return of the annual oxpenditure for ecclesiastical objects in India at the different presidencies from 1836-7 to the latest period, under the several heads of bishops and cathedral establishments, number of regular chaplains, number of unoovenantcd auxiliary chaplains, cost of building churtches, oost of grants in aid of church building, allowances to Roman Catholic chaplains, and miscellaneous expenditure. ~ Agreed to.

TROOPS AND STORES FOR INDIA. Sir DE L. EVANTS gave notice that on Thursday,the 17th of December, he would move for a committee to inquire Into the meares recently adopted by Her Majesty's Governument for thie transmssion of troops and stores to lias, and to report thereon to the House with a view to ascertaining the arrangements and precautions that onght to be taken the bettr to provide for any future important emergauche requlringrapldtranmheon of reinforcements for our armies in the East. On the motion of Mr. GLADSTONE. leave of absence was given to Sir J. Grahm for one month, on aocount of domestic affliction. ECOL1SISTICAL COM!IISSION.-HIGHWAYS. Mr. KNATCHBULL.HUGESSEN wished to kn;ww whether it was the intention of the Government to reintroduos the Edelesiatical Commilsion Bill of last eesion. AlsO, whether the Government intended to introduce a BiD for the amendment of the law relating to the management of highways. IMr. MASSEY said that a Bill would be introduced into the other House relative to the Ecclesiastical Commion, but he could r ot nndert*ke to sy that it would be precisely similar to the Bill of last session. It was his intention after the Chriatas reoers to fntroduoo a Bill relative to the mnangment of highways. ENDOWED SCHOOLS (IRELAXD). Mr. H. HERBERT (in answer to Mr. GBm) stated that therport of the CommrIsoners of Inqui in r to endoved schools in Irerand had not yet boen presentei, in consequenoe of theihlnees of one of tho eommiaionea He , I1t woul&bs readhs Parliament rease led aftr TELEGRAPiHIC COMMUNICATION VITH INDI& Mr. CRAWFORD wished to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether any arrangements had been made, oF convenhlons entered into, by or on behalf of Her Majsts Government, with any compenies, individtual, or foreignl *Governments, for establishiing telegraphic commusiications with Egyp,t and India; and whether any negotiations were nowr peaaing, and with wvhom, in referenoe thereto. Lord PALMERSTON..-SiEHer Majesty's Government have been in communication with the Government of Austria upon the subject of a telegraphic line to be esta.blished from Ragusa to Alexandria, but the conditions which the Austrian Government wished to attach to the treaty were such that Her Majesty's Government could not with propriety agree to, and therefore that negotiation has been dropped. (Cheers.) One of these conditions was that the BritJsh Government should engage to use no other line but that for irs communications with India; and another was tbat we should undertake to continue the line from Suez to India. Of course, the first was sufficient, thbat being a oonditon which we did rot think it advisable to accept, and the seoond was a cond ition which we did not see our way easily to fulfiL That negotiation is therefore for the prosent at an end; but the same time I am not without hopes that the Austrian Government will establish such X line of communication, becwause it is obvious that it would be advantageous for them to do so, and it would be very desirable to us to bave it. In that case we should be perfectly ready to pay for our use of that line in such manner as might be fair. I may as well state that theTurkinh Government purpose to establish a line of electric telegraph commu nication from Constantinople, or the opposite shore, to the head of the Persia Gulf, with the hope that if that Bue were established the British Government or the East India Company might cary It on from Buasora to Kurraches. INDIAN HONOURS. Mr. WILSON (in answer to Colonel NORTH) said that a short time ago a rnle had been laid down by the Treasury that whenever honours were conferred by Her Majesty upon officers actively servirg in the army or navy the fees upon those distinctions should bo repaid by the public. That rule had been followed in the Crimean war, and it would no doubt be also pursued in the case of distinctions conferred for services in India. eARMY WARRANT OF 1854. On the metion that tho House -t its rising adjourn to Monday, - General PEL said that the Under Secretary for War had on the 11th of August stated that the warrant of 1854 was receiving the attention of the military authorities. The hon, gesAtleman then said, be was aware that the warrant had not realized the expctations that bad been formed of It, but that the attention of the military authorities had been directed to the subject. Since that time nothing had boenhsrdDfthis inquiry, while the grievance was daily incresing The grievance was not confined to LieutenantColonels, and the warrant was further oomplained of becatse It placed officers of the Quen's servioe in a worse position than officers of the East India CompXny. He should probably be told that the military authonties had been too much engaged of late to oonsider the subject, but if the warrant were the result of a commission of inquiry another commission ought to be appointed to remedy the evil that had arisen. He depreacted the interference of that House in military administration, and he had no personal motives to serve by taking up the subject, but he felt bound to bring the injurious operation of this warrant under the notice of the House and the Government. Perhaps the Under-Secretary for War would have no objection to the appointment of a oommission to consider the matter. Sir J. RAMSDEN aid that the hon. and gallant officer had anticipated the aswer he had to give, for the great amount of labour thrown upon the Horse Guards and the War Department in sending troops to India had rendered it quite impossble for those who were competent to deal with this subject to direct their attention to it as it deserved. Hehoped to be enabled, when the Housemetafterthe Christmas recess, to state the result of the inquiry that was now taking place into the operation of the warrant. Colonel NORTH had brought the operation of this warant under the notice of Parliament for the last three years. and the late events in India were thereforo not a sufficient excuse for the delay. THE ARMY IN INDIA. Sir DE L. EVANS wished to know on what daythe noble lord at the head of the Government intended to move a vote of thanks to the army of India. He understood last night that the noble lord was about to bring a message from Her Majesty, and to move a resolution pledging the Hous to vote a pension to Gene ral Havelock That was a resolution which every member of that ounee would most cordially support (cheers); but he was certain that this most distinguished man would rather not be isolated in the dis. tilbution of honours to the army of India, but would prefer that his name should be brought in with General Wilson and the other Indian heroes. He trusted that the noble lord would give the House an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon the services of all the Indian army. Lord PALMERSTON.-My hon. and gallant friend and the House will not suppose that the matter to which he alludes has escaped the attention of the Government, or that they have any hesitation or doubt that this House will be anxious to testify by a vote its high admiration of the services of the Indian army. I wil give notice of the day when I will bring the subject before the House. BRITISH ENGINEERS AT NAPLES. Mr. MILNES said that he need not preface the question of which he had given notice by a long state. ment. Last summer some persons took forcibla poseession of the Sardinian vessel the Cagliari for the purpose of landing upon the Neapolitan territory, where they intended to make a descent for political purposes. Those endeavours were not uoocessful, and on the seizure of the vessel two English engineers were found on board. Under what circumstances they were found remained in the dark. It was stated by some that they were found in irons Incapable o{action, and by others that they were employed In dirocting the vessel At any rate, all who were or board were arrsted and conveyed to the prison of the kingdom of Naples. Tho House was aware that diplomatic relations between this country and the Government of Naples were at present suspended, and, although that circumstance might Increase the difficulties of dealiug with the case, it oughtnot to prevent the lives and property of Englishmen being equally secured. (Hear.) It was therefore natural that the British Consul at Naples should see these persons, and that, if incontestably innocent, they should be instantly liberated, or, if there were any doubt, that they should have a fair trial, with legitimate means of defence. (Hear, hear.) He was Informed that these persons had been detained in prison now for five months, and that during that tine they had not been allowed to communicate with their friends at home, with the consul or with the any legal advocate who could be charged with their defence. In his view it was no excuse that such were the Neapolitan forms of procedture, because it was on account of slnnilar forms of procedure that the Government of Naples found itself in its present exceptional position. (Hear.) He wished to ask the Government what mea. sure they had taken, and what measures they intended to take to assert the rights of humanity and the honour of this country, either for the liberation of their fellow-subjects now Imprisoned in a foreign territory, or by securing them what would be generally considered in England and Earope a fair trial, wiith legitimate means of defence. (Cheers.l Lord PALRERSTON.-By the strict rudes of the HouseI am precluded from saying a word. The practice which prevails of multiplying questions to Her Majesty's Government on motions for adjournment is one of great inc)n- and said, "We have no regard for anythlag of the sort. AlR we look to is-"'m, Quocunu ' modo rt e. (Laughtei.) Their answer to the question Ie had quoted Was, " Those are"-not the primary but-"the only consideratlona which ffrect our action." Now, Gurney' hous did not seem quite Fo loosewaisted(a laugh), but the old lady in Tbredseedlestreet appeared to have go into ratherqueer habits if the representationof whatshedid wasoorrectone. (Laughter.) Mr. Chapman, the managing partner of Gurney's house, was aeked the same question, and replied, " The is a eertain description of paper which we won't touch - if we know it we won't touch any rediscounted paper.'1 [Several hon members here held up their hands in apparent aMareMent.1 Tbis B w in Mr. Chapman's evidence. Whether it was trme or not he (Mr. Henley) could not telL (Elear.) But he cared not whether it was true or false. It was perfectly clear from the upheld hands which he had just seen that there wasi a certain description of paper in the iuarket, no snatter who dealtin it. (Rear.) This consideration, then, arose,-had the existence of this Bank restriction lad anything to do with the creation of such a kind of banking "facilities," if they liked to call them so? Every one must see that sines the passing of the present Act there bad been a wonderful development of all this sort of queer paper. The veil which generally hid these transaccions was now and then awcidentally litted Up in otr courts of justioe, and that was all he klnew on the subjeot; but he saw enough in this way to warrant him in asking whether the restriction which existed on the one hand, and the iuflation prevailing on the other when the bullion flowed into the coffers of tho Bsnk, had had anything to do with the practices which had lately grown up. When the directors of the Bank of Englazd were obliged to exercise their own discretion such transactions s those to which he had been referring erere unknown. He did not think that If, 20 years ago, a governor and deputy governor of the Bank had been subjected to examinaton, they would havo shtted that they paid no regard to the charcter ot the paper with which ithey dealt. e beliered that at that time the Bank frequently exercised a vey salutary check upon speculative transactions, and he had always felt that thmt portion of the existing law to which he had particularly alluded had been productive of eonsequences most prejudicial to the interests of the cotntry. They bad now what were called "slaughterhouses " (a laugh); they bad unlioensed pawnbrokers; they hid dealers in warrants; they had aIeers and buyers of cargoes for arrival; none of whom were herud of some yearm ago. By such means as these the quieter traders of the country were ctuly "chawed up" (laughter); the died away, and people shrugged their shoulders an said, Oh, they can't keep pace with the times." The new mode of rediscounting had, however, been establbhed, and they now saw men beginning upon a couple of thoand pounds and presently failmg for 300,ODDI. Their affairs went Into the hands of Mr. Coleman or somebody else. A long array of figures which scarcely anybody could understand appeared in the newspapers, and yet it was said that by means of the wonderful Act of 1844 any undue extension of credit and of specuation upon paper had been prevented. le questioned the acuracy of that assetion. he effectof the lawhad heen to prevent theifame of a partieular kind of paper called bank-notes, but he believed it had caused the use of many other kinds of paper which were ten thound times more mlschievous. He had gathered from the statement of the Chanosllor of the Exchequer that he thought it might be desirable that the Scotoh circulation should be payable in Bank of England notes. He did not know whetherh had correctly undrstood the right hon. gentleman. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said he had geted that, instead of a reserve of gold, Bank of Engla notes should be held. Mr. HENLEY continued.-If the Scoch hank-notes were to be replced by Bank of England notes, the difficulty nOw experienoed with regard to English oountry bank-notes would simply be aggravted. So eager had Parlameat been to have notes which should be always convertible, and so anxious to put a limit upon isue, that they had given to a favoured number of individuals, who happened at the time to hase banks of is3ue, a monopoly of 8,000,001. of notes without their poessing one athing of security in eoin or anything else in their tills. It was at the same time provided that these country issues should be paid by Bank of England notes, an)d the consequence was that the amount of 8,000,0001. formed a portionof the aggregate circlation of the country. The addition of 8000,0001. to 20,000,0D014 sbowed an aggregate circulation of 28,000,000L But, under this wonderful machinery, the instant there was any pressure upon gold they found, on the one hand, that the reserve of the Bank of England lesened exactly In proportion to the diminution of bullion ; and, on the other hand, the reserve of the Bank of England was drawn upon by the oountry bhnkers, who if there was any alam, must necessarily obtain some a6,0001. at least in bank-notes to enable them to meet the demands of their customers Therefore, in a kInd of inverse proportion, the whole insu ws reduced; and that, he thought, was one of the great faults of the present law. He considered that with regard to circulation England, Scotlnd, and Ireland should be placed upon the same footing. Lord J. RUSSEIL.-Whatever may be the opinions which re entertained in the committee upon this much. debated subject, I think all hon. members will agree that the committee aze very much Indebted to my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the clear and able manner in which he hu laid before usthe present position of the quesdon. I am in the singular-I will not call it the unfortunate-position of being very well satisfied with -rhat has been done, being very tolerably satisfied with the Act of 1844, and being entirely satisfied with the proposal for the appointment of a committee which is to follow the proposition now under our consideration. I will say only one word with regard to the immediate question before the oommittee, because I think both sides ore agreed that the measure taken by Her Uajesty's Waiaters was a right use of their dScretion, that they have contributed to save the commercial credit of this country from very severe disasters, and that indemnity ought to be given by Parliament for any violation of the law which may hava taken pla. But, that question disposed of, the further questions naturaUy arise-whether the Act of 1844 was rightly suspended in 1847; whether it has been rightly suspended in 1857; whether it is the only law wthich ought to be maintained; whether, supposing It to beoralntained, some very extendve alteration in its provisions maay not be requisite; and, lsstly, whetherit is notnecesary togivesome dispensing power either to the Crown or to the Bank of England in order from time to time tosaspend its operation These questions are naturally raised by the state in which this subject comes before us. Bat I think that in dcussing this question in this House, and still more in discnssing it out of doors, gentlemen fall into tho error against which they were warned both by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and by my hon. friend the member for K:endal (lr. Glyn)viz., that of confounding the two very distinct matters of national currency and commercial credit. (Hear, hear.) I believe the Act of 1844 was intended to secure our national currency from depreciation, and that it has accomplished that end. (Hear, hear.) But as to commercial credit, which some extravagant supporters of the Act of 1844 seemed to think was to be saved from aU danger and all panic by that statute, It runs Its own courso, and aU that any Act of Parliament can do is to endeavour, as far as possible, that the national ourrency may not be imperilled. or run the risk of being swept away by the torrents which occasionally desolate the field of commerco. With regard to national currenoy, I think every one must on a moment's reflection be satisfied with the Act of 1844 as a supplement to the Act of 1819. I remember perfectdy wel returning from the Low Countries in 1815 with a number of 20-franc pieces, for every one of which I got a II. Bank of England note. The Bank of England 1l.-note was then worth 16s. Any one who goes now with a 1L b'nk-note wiU find that he can get 25 francs or more for itin Paris or in London. Wel, then, there is sn end of that depreciation. That has boen curod by the Acts of 1819 and 1814; and I don't think that at either of the periods of commercial panic, in 1847 or 1857, thera has been the smallest doubt or question as to the convertibility of the bank-note. Every merchant and every individual In the country felt satisfied that his 51.-note would obtain for him its equivalent In gold; and therefore there has been no depreciation of the carrency. (Hear, hear.) The exel ange, as my right hon. friend says, has been corrected. But when we come to the other question of commercial credit, I think everybody who looks at the history of ths country, even from a date no further back than the commencoment of the present century, will see that there have always been these changes, first of the springing up and growth of trade, next of gr.'at prosperity, then of inflation, then of distress and distrust, and finally the bubble has burst and we have had to begin the cycle again. That was the cae before the p n-Act of 1844. (Rear, hear.) I lament, I confess, to have beard so much blame cast upon that Act by so high an authority as the hon, member for Kendal. Does he recollect what occurred in 1825, long before the adoption of the Act of 1844? Seven hundred privato cotntry banks broke. faint expression of surprise.) There was the greatesti as throughout the kingdom, and the greatest distrust of country bank paper prevailed. In 1847, again, the particular cause to which my hon. friend alluded were in operation. There was a great demand for corn-a very natural and necessary demand, indeed; but it occasioned a great oxportation of specie. Other speculations contributed to produco distress, and another period of depression then ersued. We have had a reemcrence of these events in 1857; and when the right hon. gentleman opposite reads a number of pases from merchants and bank directors to show that trade Is in a wholesome condition, he forgets that these only apply to the answers given at the time; because overybody, whether engaged in trade or otherwise, must know that revulsions, and very often suddon revulsions, talke place in commerce, and that owing to some unlooked-for cAuse-perhaps, the intflation of particular speculations-the country finds itself all at once involved in a state of ancortainty aud distress, extending even to the most healthy part of its trade. What has been done with regard to the currency at these different times? Beeause, while I would support the Act of 1844, and wbile I think that that Act has been very much overblamed, on the other hand it has also been greatly overpraised. I believe it is an additionalsecurity-aunim provement upon our former laws; but in the action of trade upon currncy, and of currency upon trade, I don't think the course of things has very much vaied since the passng of that law. In 1825 weo had the testimony of Lord Ashburton, who sUtated that the Governor and Deputty-Governor of the B ank. Mr. HIuskisson, and himscelf met ho consider whait

LONDON, SATURDAY, D.BCRMBER 5, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, after some preliminary business had been despatched, The Bishop of OxFoRD asked whether Lord SaArmsBuny intended to proceed so soon as Monday evening with the Religious Worship Act Amendnent Bill After considerable discussion, Lord SHAFrEsBuY consented to defer the second readiDg, intilDating his intention of explaining the objects of the measula on Monday next. Their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of Commons, in reply to Mr. CnAN- FORD, Lord PATERBsToN stated that the negotiations with the Austrian Government respecting a telegraphiceline had been broken off, owing to the eonditions required by that Government; but he was nou without hopes that the Government of Austria vould establish that line, and the Turkish Government proposedtoestablisha telegraphic line from Constantinople to the head of the Persian Gulf. On the motion that the House at its rising do adjourn until Monday, in reply to an inquiry by Mr. M. MiLNr.s, Lord PTErB sroN detailed the measures adopted at the instance of Hn M.rsry's Government for communicating w;ith the two English engineers taken in the Cagliari steamer, observing that under the circumisturces there were no just grounds of complaint against the Neapolitan Government with reference to their treatment. The motion was agreed to. The report upon the Address was likewise agreed to, after a few words from Mr. PACES, who complained that the Government were not sufficiently explicit as to their intentions rcgarding the reform in the representation of the people. The House having resolved itself into a Committee to consider the Bank Act of 1844, The CIIAZ:CELLOR of the EXCEEQTER, in moving for leave to brincg in a Bill to indemnify the Bank of England in respect to certain issues of their notes, began by calling attention to the existing statr of the law under the Act of 1844. He then proceeded to explsin the objects of Sir R. PEEL in introducing this Act, premising that the note circulation of the United Kingdom amounted, in ro.und numbers, to about S0,000,1OO.,-namely, 20,01)0001i L. of the Bank of Englaud, and lS,000,0001. of the Scoteh, Irish, and provincial bauks,-of which amount of 38,00,00. only a portion was covered by bullion. One of the main objects contemplated by S&r P. PEEL, be ohserved, was to provide a security against the excessive issue of paper, and to guard against the recurrence of commercial panics; at the same time, Sir ROBERT expressly stated that he did not propose the measuire as an infallible panacea, or a complete guiarantee against commercial crises, and when, in 1847, a crisis occurred, he declared that the Government of that day were justified it unctioning a departars from the limitAtiorn prescribed by his Act. Sir a. Lcwis then adverted to the eircuruxtnoesatteading the latecrisis, the imnmediatecauseof which was, he said, wholly unconnected 'with the onmwgement of tho Bank; it aroe almost excluxively out of the derangement of the American trade. He referred to the succssive failureg of the Borough Bank of Liverpool (which was not a bank of isue), of the Western Bank of Scotland, and of the City of Glagow Bank. The circulation of the two lIAt-named banks was 800,0001., their deposits being 9,000,0001.; so that it was not their note circulation, but the magnitude of their other liabilities, which led to their stoppage These and other failures, aompanied by the dimid nution of bullion in the Bank of England frora 10,000,0001. to 6,000,0001., andofthereserve ofnotes from 4,500,0001. to 1,500,000.Z, created great alarm. He compared the alOUnt of bullion, the reserve of notes, private deposits, and securities in the B3ank, in 1^847 and 1857, oserving that the turning point had been painedin the former-year before the isue of the Government letter, whereas in the present case the worst had not been reached. The courae taken by the Government in 1847 had been maturely considered and deliberately approved by Parliament, including the promoters of the Act of 1844; it therefore constituted a Parliamentary precedent. Adverting to a question put by Mr. DLsuAma on the preceding night, he stated that the issue of the late letter was the spontanleous act of HZn MAJESTY$ Government upon a deliberate and conscientious viewr of the circumstances of the case, without any urgencr by mercantile bodies or the Bk of England. TJnder that letter the Bank had transferred 2,000,000. from one department of the establishment to another, but the issue to the public had not reached that amount. He fully admitted the gravity of the step, although it only enlarged the ise of paper uponsecuritiesbeyondthe14,OO,Oy allowed bythe Act to meet a momentary exigency; but he denied that it depreciated the currency, as had been alleged, inasmuch as the notes issued under the authority of the letter were still payable on demand in gold. After stating the grounds upon which he proposed to move for the re-appointment of the select commnittee of lat session, he entered into details to show that the policy of the Acta of 1844 and 1845 had been perfectly successful, and that our paper currency was in a sound condition. Panics, be remarked, might happen, as at Hamburg, if our circulation were purely metallic; and in such crisis, any limit to the paper circula. tion must ereate alarm. At such a moment there must be a power of relaxation, and it would be a question for the select committee, among others whether it was preferable to leave that power in case of emergency, in the Executive Government, to be exercised on their responsibility to Parliament., or to adopt the conclusion of the Lords' Committee, that such power should be engrafted upon the Act. Mr. GLADSTOSz did not oppose the Bill of Indemnity, and thought that the C.HAcELLoH of the EXCHEQuER was entitled to argue from the transactions of 1847 in justification of the course pursued by the Government. But he was not convinced by his arguments in favour of the reappointment of the Bank Committee in preference to legi4ation upon the subject, believing that it would be an overburdened committee, the House being called upon meanwffhile by its vote practically to suspend the Bank Act. He predicted that the inquiry, exhausted in 3857, would be left unfinished in 1858. The Cas?ocsu~on of the ExCHEQuER, he observed, had not distinguished between the questions of banking and issue, and the HLouse ought to recognize that distinction. The Act of 1844 touched the question of issue only, leaving that of banking untouched, and he thought the present was a fit time for ascertaining the view of Parliament upon this subject. instead of directing the Committee to go round again the circle of inquiry into the currency and the law of isue, it would be better employed in investigating the commercid causes of the late p_nic, and hnir far they were connected with the state of banking. The effect of referring a heap of subjects to an overburdened committee would be to postpone legislation and obstruct inquiry into the causes of the recent panic and the present embarrassment. Mr. Sroo2sms attributed all our present monetary derangements and commercial embarrasaments to the Act of 3844, which he declared to be a delusion. It had answered, he sad, none of the expectations held out by it promoters; it could not be amended, ana must be abelished. Mr. GIN differed from Mr. SpooNxR as to the effect of the Act of 18"4 upon the present commercial criBis the causes of which were identically the same as those which produced the crisis of 1847. He had mixed up the questions of capital and currency. But, although, he observed, the pressure was not caused by the Act, the limitation of issues by the Bauk became in the time of pressure the primary cause of the crisis. At every time of violent pressure a letter must be issued, for he hoped no individual would have the hardihood to carry out what was termed the first principle of the AcL But he thought the power of relaxation should remain, not with the Government, but with the Bank of England. Mr. HxE.Lry argued that the Act of 1844 had failed in its main objects. Sir R. PEEL had admitted, he observed, that it did not prevent panics. He (Mr. HrNLFn) maintained that it did not secure convertibility; the limit in times of pressure destroyed confidence, and the authority given to the Bank to issue 14,000,0001. of notes beyond its bullion unwarrantably inflated credit. None recommended that the Act should be maintained in its integrity, andthe question was whether it was safe or desirable to leave the relaxation of the law to the discretion of the Government, or whether there should be some other mode of effecting the object. Be believed that there ought to be no limit; that carrying the limit up to 16,000,0001. or 17,000,0001. would do no good whatever. Since the Act passed there had been a wonderful development of a queer sort of securities, and of a system of trade founded upon re-diccounta and inflated credit. Lord J. RussELL said he was in the singular position of being satisfied with wbat had been done by the Government, with the Act of 1844, and with the propowal to re-appoint the committee of last session. But the manner in which the motion for a Bill of Indemnity came before the House raised the questions-whether, the Act of 1844 having been twice suspended, could be, or ought to be, maintained; if so, -would it not require extensive alterations, and ought the suspending power to be vested in the Caowi' or the Bank of England 1 In the discussion the national currency had been erroneously confounded with commercial credit. He believed that the former had been preserved by the Act of 1844; but conmercial credit would raun its course., and all that Parliament could do was to prevent its damaging the national currency, which he believed, had suffered no depreciation. In his opinion, the act of the Government had saved the general interests of the countiy from great disasters, and with Mr. GL'YN he hoped never to see a Minister of this country so infatuated with a prnciple, sound in itself, as to refuse to relax the Act of 1844. That Act he did not tbink required extensive alteration, and he thought that thfe re-appointment of the committee of last session was exactly the manner in which the Government ought to deal with this question. The great object of the Act of 1844 was to preserve the convertibility of the national currency, at the same time to give help in time of disasters; and the Act having fulfilled those objects since 1847, it ought to be maintained. Although the Act was more restrictive than it appeared, he douibted the necessity of a change in thu limit. If, however, it was made clear to the select committee tha- there ought to be a change, it should be effected by Act of Pa-lianment. *Mr. DrsnAnLi complained of the vague declmai. tion in which speakers had indulged while discussing this question. The immense disasters of the present time originated, he observed, not from the nismanag,ement of the currency, but of the capital of the country. The Act of 1844 was passed to regulate the currency and establish the convertibility of the Bank's notes; yet it had been so framed that it forced those who regulated the cutrrency to aggra - vate distress and distrust by applying to the do. mestic trade the sams treatment applied to the foreign trade, althouigh it ahould have been exactly opposite. He admired the object of the Ac0, the securing the con-vertibility of the Back paper, and he would pis over one crisis, when the provisions of the law were a%Ixpended by a wise indulgence; but it became the House to consider whether it would waan.j<,n
Parliament has been assembled in strict conformity with constitutional principles, but the inconvenience of the short preliminary Session scarcely finds its compensation in any important practical result. The QUEEN'S Speech has been delivered; but the key to its meaning will not be -forthcoming till the ordinary time of meeting in February. The Government has done, at its owna discretion, an act which gives rise to abundant difference of opinion, but the Legislature has only to pass the Bill of Indemnity, which all sections ore equally willing to support. Both parties may found a plausible argument on the extensive operation which, as Lord OvERsToNE pointed out, has followed on the Treasury letter. It is true that only two millions of addirional notes have been issued, while of that amount more than ihalf has been transferred from one department of the Bank to another. But, at the same time, the reserve of the banking department -was almost entirely paid away. As long as the power of issue is limited by law, notes form as legitimate a reserve for the Bank of England as for any private ,establishment. On the removal of the restriction the unlimited permission to create paper money was itself equivalent to a reserve. The notes in -circulation outside the walls of the Bank exceeded the average amount by six or seven millions. At the worst, the Bank of Enigland was itself in no danger, and the Directors accordingly remained passive, notwithstanding the approaching probability that it would be necemsary to withhoid all further accommodation to commerce. It was on behalf of the mercantile interests, and not of the Bank, that the Government eventually determined to interfere. The immediate difficulty was owing to the failure of -the Joint-stock Banks which stopped payment, in Scotland and in the North of Eugland. As the pressure of high rates of discount became lighter -the drain of gold from the country was less aad -leswrapid, and some days before the publication of the Treasury letter the exchanges were beginning to turn in our favour. The demaud for gold in Scotland and Ireland intercepted the relief which would otherwise have been felt by London traders, and it seews that they could not afford to wait during a week or a fortnight for the return of the tide which had flowed to the provinces. Under these circumstances the Bank, or rather the Government, made an advance of money in the form of an additional issue of notes. It is highly probable that under any system a similar interference would from time to time be not less urgently demanded. If, however, the crisis occurred under the operation of an unlimited paper -currency, it would not be so easy to dis-cover a fund applicable to the assistance of commerce. The American banks have been forced to suspend cash payments, and their customers are scarcely anxious that they should provide an additional issue of notes. The debate of last night naturaUy caUled forth a repetition of the opinions which have been so fully discussed since the commencemeiit of the panic. The CET 1NCELLOR of the ExCEEQutEI's speech was valuable chiefly as conveying an assurance that the Government is not disposed to tamper with the principles of the Bank Charter Act. The history of the late .ransactions, as well as the exposition of the theory of the law, was already familiar to all who take an interest in the question. It was, perhaps, unnecessary to prove ,by arguments of detail that the paper currency is in a sound conlition. The practical convertibility of bank-notes is not only acknowledged by the Birmingham sect, but dwelt upon as one of their principal grievances. The proposed alterations in the law are, as far as they extend, both safe and reasonable. There can be no objection to make the Bank of England note a legal tender in Scotland and Ireland, though in the recent panic a drain of notes would have produced -the same effect as the actual demand for gold. A similar remark wiU apply to the suggestion that Scotch issues may, in certain cases, be guaranteed by a deposit of Bank of England notes. As long as the circulation is limited by law it matters little which portion of the whole is impounded as a security for issues. The withdrawal of any part of the total amount from immediate use will make every other description of money scarcer and dearer. The CHAÂ£&?wEaLoR of the EXCHEQL-ER is justified in his criticism on the proposal to make an addition te the issue based on ,securities. The only effect of such a measure -would be to diminish in tiues of difficulty the resErve of bullion in the issue department. As it was necessary for Sir CORNEWALL LEwIS -to conelude with a motion, the proposal that the Committee should be reappointed was at the same time natural and harmles; but Mr. GLADST(NE points out a newer and more fertile field of inquiry when he recommiends the -investigation of the commercial causes of the panic in connexion with the system of banking. It is difficult to say anything new on the theory of issues. The United Kingdom possesses a sound paper circulation of about forty milUions in conjunction -vith a metallic currency of a larger amount. The proof that the existing amount is sufficient consists In the fact that it is niot larger. If gold is required, it -will be imported like any yther commodity as soon as a rise in price indicates the wants of the community. The law follows the impereeptible operations of commerce by providing that the issue of paper may at any time expand in proportion to the reserve of gold. The recent difliculty of procuring discounts was in no degree attributable to a deficiency of the circulating medium. The Manchester Chamber of Commerce, in a petition eminently creditable to the mercantile sagacity of the members, points out the species of currency which has reaDy been placed on an unsound basis. In Lancashire provincial notes are unknown, while Banklof England notes are seldom used except in retail transactions. The vast commerce of the district is carricd on by eredits, by clearances of accounts, and by bills of exchange. An inflation of private secuities does more injury than any mode of issuing bank-notes; and the petitioners complain that bills of exchange have beem created to an enormous extent without the stcurity of any corresponding funds, and "beyQmi the "meaus of the capital and currency of the country "to withdraw or absorb at their maturity." The papermongers would reply that the currency ought to be enlarged in proportion to the demands for assistance; but the capital of speculative traders is not increased with equal readiness. The Man. chester Chamber demands that there sbhould be an inquiry whether the course pursued by some of the Joint-stock Banks has not been opposed to the intentions of the Legislature and prejudicial to the interests of the country. It is not unlikely that an ultimate remedy for the evils which have been caused will be found in conferring on bank 3bareholders the questionable boon of limited liability. When it becomes impossible to proceed against individual members of a banking company customers and creditors will take care that some better security is provided for the liquidation of their demands. l:anks which failed to satafy this requirement might not improbably be forced to close thieir doors in default of deposits. The CnAwcinaTon of the En nCuERz dwelt on the warnings given by Sir IROBERr PEEL and his suipporters, that no Bank legislation could absolutely preclude the occurrence of panics. 'Until the Bank or the money-dealers find a FOEIATUS'S purse, no such panacea is likely to be discovered. The available resources of the Bank of Eng'and are large, but they are not inexhaustible, even although the relaxation of the currency laws gives themn an exceptional elasticity.. Any state of things in which so great a catastrophe as the American auspension should exercise no influence on English trade is altogethler inconceivable. Mr. DISRAELIfS proposal to legislate on the subject of the Bank without further delay can lead to no practical result. The leader of the Opposition differs from the majority of his followers, and the distinction between home and foreign demands for gold is a speculative nicety which cannot possibly form the basis of an enactment. Lord JoH.- RLssxaL clearly points out the utility of the existing law, as well as the necessary limits to the effects of any provision for the management of the currency. The debate of next Friday will only be a repetition of that which took place last night; but it is perhaps desirable that the subject should be exhaustively discussed.
The concurrence of statesmen of all parties in according the due meed of praise to our countrymen in India is but a natural expression of the universal admiration which those unexampled services have excited. WLsox and HAvxLocx, OurAs and GREATHBn, HomE and SALKELD, CHAZIBERLAYNE and EYRE are names in everybody's mouth, and it is gratifying in the extreme to observe that the merits of the dead are not forgotten in the honours of the living, and that every panegyric contains its fitting tribute to the memories of NIcHosoLSO and NE\I,LL. It is, indeed, as Lord DERBY observed, hard to single out examples from " that bright band to whom England owes " so much ;" and yet there is another band, another class of officers, whose names do not figure in the catalogue of conquerors, but whose services, nevertheless, have been such as to place the country uneer immeasurable obligations to their abilities and their daring. If the reader will but remember for a moment that all India wa& held by a tenure of un.iform character, whereas it is only over a limited portion of the country that Sepoy revolts have bcen permitted to explode, he will at once discern the merits of some exploits which have hitherto been omitted from public eulogies. It is not merely in siege or battle that the spirit and endurance of our Indian countrymen have been tried. The whole numbers of the British race in India might have been reckoned by thousands, while those of the Sepoys alone were counted by hundreds of thousands. To this mass ot' explosive material must be added that aliment of rebellion -which every Eastern town supplied in its savage rabble, its gaol-fill of convicts, and the marauding population -.round it. Europeans were dotted over the country in groups, which, when the tempest of insurrection arose, were almost lost in a sea of mutiny, and yet in very many instances the ascendancy of race and courage was so vigorously maintained that the catastrophe, though ever impending, was incessantly averted. It is natural enough that our admiration should be attracted to scenes of victory and triumph, to the successes of hundreds over thousands, and to the renown thus imperishably stamped upon our dominion and our name; but there are other examples wvhere, though the lustre may be less, the deserts are not inferior, and where the strain upon the fortitude and resources of our offleers has been equal to that exerted in the trenches or in the camp. Look, for instance, at what was endured and accomplished by the representatives of British authority at HIyderabad. In the whole territory of India there is not a community more dangerously constituted than in this capital of the NIZAes' dominions. It comprises all the elements of insecurity together. The Government and a considerable portion of the population are Mahomedan; the town rabble is numerous, fierce, and lawless; the Sepoy force is represented in great strength at the cantonments; the WizA2s's own army was formed on the same model as the Contingents who mutinied so promptly in Hindostan; and, to crown all, bands of Rohillas, Affghans, Arabs, and other mercenaries of all descriptions swarm throughout the capital and the province. In this critical situation, -without any European force to reckon upon, were the Resident and hiq colleagues placed at the outbreak of the revolt. Their duty was to preserve order at Hyderabad-a mission equivalent to maintaining the authority of the British Governuaent in the Madras Presidency, and, indeed, over all Southern India. In the discharge rof this onerous and most arduous obligation they had been left without even that slight support of British troops which ordinary routine provided. It is seldom that the Madras Presidency receives above three or foar oat of the five-and-twenty battalions despatched from this country for the protection of India, but on the present occasion it had been denuded of this scanty garrison to satisfy the more pressing exigencies of Bengal. The British authorities were entirely isolated in these enormous territories of the Deccan, nor could they calculate, even in their extremest need, upon any support beyond that perhaps of a troop or two of Lancers or one wing of an infantry battalion. So placed, they were left to hear of the mutinies and massacres of Hindostan, of the seizure and occupation of Delhi, of the prolonged resistance offered to the Government of India, and of the actual enthronement of a rebel Prince in the old Palace of the MOGULS. Such intelligence, of course, set in tumultuous motion the mass around them, and the ferment grew and quickened with every report arriving from the head-quarters of rebellion. A single moment of indecision, a single act of impolicy, a single false step, or a single admission of weakness, might have turned Byderabad into a Lucknow and made a second Orde of the Deccan; but no such failure was seen. Availing themselves of the predilections of the NizsuA, the loyalty of his chief Ministers, the sagacity of the Arab mercenaries, the good disposition of the Mladras Sepoys, and, above all, their own unflinching-determination, the Resident and his colleakq%y have succeeded in maintaining through fburlbiag months the authority committed. to thei!:ci!prgo. Revolt at one minute actually bra}-dpit ,buii it was promptly suppremsed, and th'* tranquility of the Presidency has never been seriously disturbed. Those who remarked, however, in the narrative which we published on Thursday the exertions which were called for, and the strain and suspense which the work involved, mnay possibly agree with us in thinkling that it would have been a relief to command a battery before Delhi after a month spent in keeping down rebellion at Hyderabad. Take, again, the position and the liabilities of the Punjab. This province contained 12,000,000 of the most martial race in India, who, within the last ten years, had stood in doubtful battle against us. Its frontier was so exposed to the systematic hostility of treacherous neighbours and the attacks of predatory tribes that strong brigades of troops were maintained along the border against these. emergeacies alone. So entirely, in fact, was the. Punjab regarded as the vulnerable point of our dominions that- the chief force of Government, European as well as native, was rmassed together in the garrisons of Peshawur and the neighbouring stations-some 3,000 British troops, and nearly thrice as many Sepoys. Now, with these Sepoys ripe for mutiny, and the frontier tribes ready for plunder, what was to be done? And what head could be made against such enormous- odds with the mere handful of British soldiers at command? The event shows what can be accomplished by audacity, vigour, and devotion. The-extraordinary abilities of Sir JorN LAWnvRNCE at Lahore secured not only the obedience but the good affection of the entire provnce, while the energy and adroitness of Corros and EDWAnDES at Peshawur converted danger into triumph, aud actually discovered the elements of security where. nothing but peril had at first appeared. Here, as well as elsewhere, commanding officers of Sepoys were deluded by the conviction that their troops were faithful; but here, foltunately, these delusions were overruled. The S&poys were promptly disarmed, and our old enemies, the tribes across the border, were received into our service. In the end, not only was the autho. rity of the British Government preserved throughout the province, but such reinforcements were despatched to Delhi as alone enabled our Generals to besiege and capture the city. As things stood at first, it was perfectly possiblethat30,000mutineers might have marched from the Punjab to join their accomplices in treason within the walls of Delhi. As events actualy turned out, it was the Britieh and .not the mutineers who received the succour, and no one doubts that the success of the siege and the salvation of the outnumbered British force were due to the admniatrators of the Punjab. On a smaller scale these remarks would be applicable to hundreds of stations and hundreds of officers throughout British India, and it would be hard indeed if success of this description did not find its due reward. The men of whom we speak may not, it is true, have been engaged in actual battle, but they have gained victories of their own, and have rendered polsible the victories of others. Every Indian servant who by his energy or his address preserved the tranquillity of his station, or kept a band of natives in even doubtful allegiance, deserves the praise and gratitude of his countrymen; and, indeed, in some instances the trial of endurance was even greater than that produced by active campaigning. In some parts revolters have been put down; in others they have been prevented from rising. We will not attempt a comparison, which would be both invidious and unnecessary, between the serviees thus performed. The country can find honours enough for both, but the less obstrusive class of acl;evements should not be overlooked in the admiration so naturally extorted by the others.
An opinion, having all the weight of a judgment, has just been pronounced by Mr. Justice CRESSWELL, as assessor to Vice-Chancellor STUART, on the important question of marriage with a deceased wife's sister. The result of this opinion, if accepted by the Vice-Chancelor, will be to declare invalid all marriages of the kind contracted by British subjects in foreign States. It is well known that in the year 1835 the attention of the Legislature was called to the state of the law on this subject, and to the suffering and demoralization which it caused. A marriage with a deceased wife's sister was at that time not void, but it was voidable; that is, a widower could contract such a second marriage,-the woman would be his wife and the children legitimate. After the death of either of the parties the marriage could not be questioned, but during the lifetime of both it could be dissolved by a suit in the Ecclesiastical Court. It is easy to perceive what a power was thus given to a man over his wife and children, and how necessary it was that the law should be at once amended. Lord Lvi_-DnnusT's Act settled the matter in a somewhat trenchant style. It declared that all such marriages as were already contracted should be valid, but that any that might take place for the future should be void. But the habit which had grown up during so many years of laxity was not to be so suppressed. In aU classes, from the very highest to the lowest, such marriages had been common. Among the poor especially it bad become almost a practice in some districts to instal the former wife's sister in the place of the departed. So these marriages, although known to be void, were continually taking place, the parties being content with the opinion of their neighbours that they were mor-lly man and wife. However, those in a somewhat bigher station could not be content without some legal security, and naturally lighted on the expedient of a marriage in a foreign country where such an union as they contemplated was legal. Here no difficulty presented itself. Marriage with two sisters succes*ively is valid by the law of Protestant continental countries, and in most of the States of America. The existing law of England, founded on the ecclesiastical jurisprudence, which in turn derives its origin from Rome, thus differs from the principle which these various countries have established for themselves. The consequence h_s been that every year a number of couples have been united abroad, leaving their own country with the exp-ess purpose of contracting the marriage and returning when it had taken place. The Association for the abolition of the restriction in England has by its advertisements continually pointed out this method of evading the law. The decision wbich we record to-day will, if supported, invalidate all these marriages, and mark aU the children born of them during 22 years with the brand of illegitimacy. The case on which the question arose was as follows:-IIr. WILLIAM LIG1: DrooxL married, some years since, the sister of his deceased wife at Altona, in the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein. A son was the issue of this second marriage. MIr. BRoox, died, leaving his property amon)g the children of both marriages. Since that date the son by the second narriage died aRso. The question to be decided was whethet the half-brothers and sisters inherited the share of the dead child as their legitimate brother, or whether such property eseheated to, the CROwN in consequence of his illegitimecy. Ilr. Justice CrESSWELL has pronounced his OFinion that the marriage wpas invalid and the cb'lld illegitimate. The supporters of. the legitimacy of course relied on the doctrine that a.marmiagc, is legal if it be in accordance with the l1w of tib'a plaso. where it is celebrated. The OUI P t0 1iEld tt. int asch a case as the present there is a personal disability which follows every British subject wherever he or she may go. The judgment pronounces for the latter opinion, and we cannot but concur with it. The law of England forbids the marriage within its jurisdiction on the ground that, if not incestuous, it is of a quasi-inceatuous nature. Now, no jurist has ever ventured to assert that a nation is bound to sanction what it considers a breach of the moral law in compliance with the lax discipline of other communities. It is well known that in one or two States of Europe permission can be obtained for marriages between an uncle aud niece; and that such marria"eeshavebeen actually contracted betweeu Roman Catholics, and are still more common.among Jews. But it cannot be held for a moment that an English uncle should be ,allowed-to take.his English niece -tol Lisbon, there!1 -by meanis-of,some dispensation. orprivilege toi make i her his Wfei and then return to Eagland and force English Courts to. recognize the validity of the b-nd. - Indeed1 there is no saying to what such a principle might lead. There are semi-barbarous communities which do not consider the union of a brother eid sister. to be illegal,-are we to be bound by their- morpf code? Take, then, the practice of polygamy. Utah is a territory of the United States, and within it the Governor and Legislature have given men a right to a plurality of wives. - If, theni, an Englshman and his wife were to emigrate to the Salt Lake, and while there the man were to. take a second wife and have issue by both, and then return to England with the whole family, would our Courts be bound to consider both the women hiq wives and all the children legitimate because such was the law of the place where the second marriage was solemnized? Indeed, the doctrine held by the, supporters of the marriage cannot be admitted for a moment. If it were aUowed there could be no security agaiust immoral marriages at all, and the table of prohibited degrees might as well be expunged from the Prayer-Book and the Statute Book. Reuss-Schleitz or San larino would have the power to nullify the whole marriage law :of England by simply relaxing their own code. This would be indeed carrying the comitas gesntium too far. The conclusion to which common sense leads us. is obvious. One nation is bound to recognize marriages contracted according to the forms used by another, but not when the marriage itself is essentially illegal according to its own law. An English couple who may legaUy contract marriage at home may be married abroad either by a Catholic priest, or a Jewish rabbi, or a Russian pope; they may be united by civil contract before a French notary, by half a dozen words before a registrar in Melbourne, by signing their nnmes in the presence of a back-woods' magistrate in Minnesota. In all these cases the English Courts will recognize the marriage, because it might be legally contracted, and the form in which it was solemnized is held to be immaterial. But they wl not allow the principle of our own mor-1 law to be ignored through the action of any foreign State whatever. We cannot but rejoice that this question is likely to be at length settled. The only reason for regret is that the decision should have been so long delayed. The hildren born of these marriages must now number many hundreds, and they will all be held illegitimate. Whether any special legislation should take place in their favour is a question on which Parliament may perhaps be called to decide. But, at any rate, the practice of evading the law by marriages in Germany should be brought to an end. Either the prohibition is founded in justice, or it should be repealed. * If it be just, it ought to be enforced; if it be a relic of prejudice, let its opponents bring the Legislature to concur in their opinion.

The UJnited State5 frigate Niagara had arrived at New York from Plymouth after a passage of 14 days some hours. Destructive fires had occurred at Baltimore, Mobile, and Orleans.

The good time is coming again. Satan, the great gamabler from the 'lower deep I never forsakes his own." The death of Major-General Worth is reported. The weather was becoming cold, and heavy falls of snow had occurred in some districts. Advices from Ravanniah to the 15th ult. report that trade waa dulL Sugars had declined; stocks on hand at Matanras and Havannah, 170,000 boxes.

'The Government had proclaimed the binding force of the treaty between the United i'tates and Peru, concluded on the basi3that " free ships make free goods, and the property of neutrals on board enemies' vessels is not subject to detention or confiscation unless the same be contraband of war." The contracting parties engage to apply these principles to the commerce and navigation of all sucn Powers and States as shall consent to adopt them as permanent and immutable. The New York Shipping and Commercial List of the 21st, in its renort for the three previous days, says:- ' Wall-street and dependencies are financially quiet. Money is plenty enough when first-class collaterals are offered at bank and notebrokers ofiÂ¢es. The quotation'for best notes, which continue scarce, are 12 to 18 per cent., and second class ditto 24 to 36 per cent. On call, 7 and 8 peroent,. are the current figures. Exchanges remain in about the same position as at the date of our last. The transactions in stocks during tho last few days have been large, and prices generally are higher. We notice that the board Is again running into time sales ruther largely, notwithstanding the vigorous attempt a few months ago to abolish that species of operations. Ashes are steady at the decline noticed in our last. Cotton continues inactive, for wiant of stock wherewith to operate. We notice by our Southern operators a disposition on the part of planters to withhold their crops from the seaboard markets for the avowed roa30n that prices had fallen, in consequence of the monetary revulsion, below vhat tbey considered a remune-ative rate. Home spinners are in the market to some extent, and a resumption of active business Is generally regarded as a crtaintywithin the next60 or 90 days. The stock continues light; indeed, of the low grades the market is bare. Small sales are making at 12Ac. to 13c. for middling uplands and Mobile and Orleans. The demand for flour contiuues moderately active, and selers have the advantage, an advance of 5c. to 100. having been eshblished since our last. The receiptc are to a moderate extent, and the stock accumulates v"eryslowly. There are but few foreign orders in market, and these are generally limited a' figuras which do not admit of their execution at present. Exports from the lAtto the 17th of November :-Wheatflour,1857,101,954brlI.; 1856,98,900. The wheat-market has been quite irregular rince our last, though at the close a firm tone was apparent, and the common qualities are 2c. to 3c. dearer than on Tuesday last. The receipts are to a moderate extent, and the offerings are not in excess of the demand, which is ?bout equally divded between tho local miUers and exporters. Export from the 1st to the 17th of November, 1856, 935,922 bushels of wheat, ditto 1857, 473,543; 1856, 212,616 bashels of corn, ditto 1857, 54,748. " Crude turpentine is going forward to London, an engagement) haiiug been made of 5,000 barrels; 1,500 barrels spirits turpentine have also been engaged by the same ship. The stock of crudeis reduced to about 1,000 barels, and held at $M., with sales. Snirits have been bought largely on speculation and for consumptiou, and prices have advanced three cent. per gallon, with large sales yesterday at 44 cents cash; at evening, the stock in elrst hands being sbuch reduced, one or two lots found buyers at 45 centa. cash, and this pricewas generally asked, while some withheld their stocks from the market-stock about 1,000 barrels. Crude whle and sperm are again quiet. The pork-market continuesirregular, though with a downward tendency of priees, and the demand partakes wholly of a locel trade demand. "The continued discouraging accounts for raw from London (the Niagara brings advices of a further decline of 3s. per cwvt.) the considerable stock of old crop yet remaining on hand, the near approach of the psriod when new may be expected, and the prospect of a speedy close of inland navngation, with a rather incres'ed desire on the part of holders to realize, have had amost depressng inluence on the market, and prices are sgain4 of a cent low er. "The freight-market remains dnUl, and rates for grain to Great Esitain are a shade !ower;- otherwise there ia no importanlt char,ge." The 2Vecv York Courier andEnquis-er of the 23d says: The money-market at the close of the week shows a decided improvement. The only drawback during the week bas been the unfavourable advices from Europe, and these advices are only unfavourable compared with those received previously. They are no worse than we anticipated after the suspension of our bank, and are exactly what experience foretold. The favourablo changes during the wveek are the steady return of confidence and activity to busi-mess. rand tho large shipments that are being made to the seaboard of produce and cotton. The first is too evident to nerd oroof; the second is shown by! the rapid decline of New York exchange taroughout the cou ntry. In Cincinnati, exchanse on N' ew York is quoted at 2 per cent. premium, and fallng. Private advices state that the bankers are unable to sell freely, on account of the large amount held in private hands, at a less rate, the proceeds of shipments of produce. This is the casa very generally over the West, and mnay ba regarded as a sure mdex of returning activity to trade, and also of the payments of debts to New York, Private hankers from the West have been in this market during the week buying all the Wr'tern currency to be obtained with gold. Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana currency have declined - from 5 to 2 per cent. discount. Tha bank statement will undoubtedly show a large increase of specie, and in excess of the receipts from Europe and California, in COUsiaquenCo of large receipts froml the interior. It would not be an extravagant esimate to plae the present amount of 3pecie in b.-nk at S24,000,000, althoug the average will probably showv lees. The liabilities of Bacon. Cook, and Co., at Lawrence, Kansas, are estimated at $50,000, with ample assets. "There vras an active stock-market to-day, and quottions generally are higher.

" The folloing paragraph was pubUshed this mornIng it cneeof the Boston papers: ' There wrore painutruLmonys on StateStreet to-day,that the principal zmember of .one of the Largest connmission honses. an the city, 'who are the agents fo: several manufacturing corporations, nat 'who are aulthorized to use the names of three corporations on promisory notes, has used the paper of one of thote corporations, with the eudorsemer.t of the firm, for his own private speculetions. The *amount of the breach of trust thus committed, according to currcnt rumeur, is from 30O,000 to $600,000. We give the rumour as widely circulated in the street, but trust that it w-il appear that the gentleman implieated, and who is widely respected by the community, has not acted without authority from the partie interested. The effect of the rumour on State-street has been to make it almost impoBsible to negotiate any paper to-day.' " Such an anonymous reference is evidently unfairtoward others in the same trade, and is no kindness to the person alluded to, as it only serves to wheS the public curiosity. The house in question is Lawrence, Stone, and Co., whose principal house 'was iu Boston, with brancheg in New York and Philadelphia. The Bofton house has been m anaged exclusively by Messrs. Samuel rAwrence and Jorvs Slade, so that, whatever irregularities may have occurred there, they can in no wise implicate Meesr. W. W. Stone and Henry T. Jenkins, who managed the business here and in Philadelphia, and had nothing wbatever to do with the fLnanucerig in Boston. We make this declaration at the outset and after full inquiry, in order to relieve the minds of the friends of the house here, hLr. Stone being held in high esteem as one of our most honourable citizens. In regard to the Bostoin management we have no doubt that the first reports rep.esent the matter in too strong a light. It is probable that, as the office of treasurer of several of the large inills (the Bay, State, Middlesex, &c.), 'was vested in one of the Boston gartners, he may have used his office to make accommodation ranghts for the acceptance of his own firm (who were agents for the.e mills), as aids to negotiate loans or raise money for business purposes; and, owing to the failure ofi the firm, these draughts are thrown bhck on the companfes, andthus far involve them in an obligation which was undoubtedly irregular. 'But neither of the Boston partners bas been engaged in any private speculation, or has intentionally misappropriated any trust funds; while the partners here had no opportunity of connexion with either of the trausactions, although their firm will, of course, b3 held responsible. "Theforeign trade atthisportforthepstwsoek, including the dry goods table in our last paper, amounted in the import entries to $2,933,655 against $2 644,640 the week endjng Nov. 22, last year. The exort clearances of domestic produce and miscellaneous articles, including foreign re-exported, amounted to $2,121,551 against $1,974,595 the corresponding week last year. The export of specie, including $381,000 by the Adriatic on Saturday, ambounted to $45033 against $950,750 the same 'eek last year.

The domestic exchanges nearly all improved tbrough the week, and the turn is bringing forward a considerable aumount ofgold from Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cincinncti, ac. The discount-market outside of bank is poorly supplfed with strictly first-class paper, most of the short bills of undoubted credit being taken from regular dealers at the baul;-. Money at call is lent at 6 to 7 per cent., and the demand only partial from some few of the leading stockjobbers. The practice of lending on demand on the pledge of bills receivable is scarcely known sinoe the recent troubles. The market is generally easy to parties in no way compromised by the failures and extensions among the merchants in September and October. The balance in the Sub-Treasury on Saturday afternoon stood $4,877,660 against $5,164,883 at the close of the previous week.

The head office of the Michigan Central Company Is in Boston. That portion of the new mortgage offered for sale to the bes' bidders was distributed there a 'week or two since. The sum offered was at first understood to ba $2,000,000. It Is now stated that $2,650,000 was awarded at various rates under 80 per cent., producing $2,000,000 in caah, which would give an average of only 75 per cent. for an 8per cent. first mortgage bond. Xo Dublkihy has been given to the list or plan of awards. The bonds have siece been largely sold irom second hands at 80> to 82k, and on Saturday at 84 per cent. They are last quoted in London, after the moneq troubles of the company were fully Inown, and an English conditional bid for the new loan had been sent out, at 78 to 80 per oent. sterlingequal, with the currency of sight exchange, to 85A to 8$ per cent. The negotiation, therefore, would seemn to be wanting in candour, if not fairness, toward tho interest of the shareholders as well as toward parties whobid aunder the impression that only $2,000,000 would bo awarded."

FOREIGN INTELLIGEBKE. FRAENCE (FROM O1R OWN CORB1SPONDEI.) (Tho foUoowng appeared in oar ucond Mdton of 7Wterday !-1 PAKLS, THUasDAY, ]Dxc. 3, 6 Pj. It is certain that the birth of an heir to the Spanisih Crown has not been followed by any extraordinary display of feeling in bIadrid, and that an event which excited enthusmm In times not long gone by, while affection for the person of the Sovereign stll warmed many a Spanish bosom, was coldly received by an e6tranged people. One can hardly praiwe or blame this indifference. The loyalty and enduranoe of the nation have wantonly been put to severe and humiliating tests, and Spaniards are, after all, the best judges of what is due from them to a Queen who has done much to alienate their love, and who has only herself to thankc for the lom of her popularity. The people were in the theatres when the news of the Queen's delivery was brought by a Palae Equerry, and in the Circo a few vivas were heard from the places which are always occupied by the lowrer clases. In others the actors who proclaimed the tidings were received with a partial clapping of hands, which was but faintly sustained. In the Teato Real the new3 spread rapidly from man to man, but It was followedby no demonatration. On that night (the 28th) no one illuminated his windows, and on the following day, and in spite of the exertions of the municipal body, it was not anticipated that joy would turn that night into day, escept Ei those streets here the public offices are situated. Some there are, however, who rejoice tha the expectations aud wishes of the Queen are realized; they are those who hope that the aiety to gain some popularity for her son, in the absence of all other motives, will force her to follow an equitable and liberal policy. Others, again, see in the birth of aPrince an obtacle in the way of thow who labour for the fusion of the two branches and the reconciliation of the Royal Family. The partians of that project affect to hail the event with joy, and I can perceive that their organ in the press, the Regeneracion, does its best to conceal its disappointment; it even tortures itself Into a wild enthusiam which it would fain pass off for reaL The nervous people who tremble at the thought of political oDomplicationa in Europe will feel greatly relieved when they learn the important fact that the " Ministerial crisis " has ceased at Athens, and that the new Cabinet has no politieal "i gnification." The peace of the world is secured, and King Otho is entitled to gratitude. A letter from Brest, of the 1st inst., anounces that the British Iron screw steamer Durham. of London, was wrecked on the Wolf-rock, in the bay of Audierne. The Durham was returning from the west coast of Africa, laden with palm oil, elephants' teeth, and golddust. She struck about 100 yard from the cost, and her hul is a comrplete wreck. It is pou,ible to rave the machinery. The palm oil is al lorst, as the caskls opened when the abip struck. It is expected that several tons of elephanta' teeth and some gold dust may be saved. The crew, 21 In number, are at Audierne. A private telegram announces the uspension of payment by the house of Cellano at Genoa, Milan, and Turin.

The advantage recently gained by the clerical party in Sardinia greatly please the Austrian Ultra. montanists, who Batter themselves that the present Cabinet will not be long able to withatand the combined attacks of the Ultra-Radicals and the Retrograde party under Count Solaro. Count Cavour, as you well know is heartily detested in the Austrian official world; but he has many partisans among the people, who are well aware that it has always been his aim to keep the mid-channel betwreen the Scyila aud Charybdia formed by the Republican and Retrograde parties. The Vienna politicians are inclined to attach extreme importance to the result of the recent elections in Sardinia, and to fancy that the Ultramontane pa will at no distant period have regained the Influence which it lost a few years ago. In general but little is known here of what is doing in Lombardy, but recently we have learnt that even greater discontent than usual prevails in the larger cities. The Lombards complain bitterly of the heavy taxes which are levied on them, and of the bigotry of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which would fain introduce observances most repugnant to the feelings of intelligent and enlightened men. The Archduke Governor-General has just given permission to eleven political fugitives to return to their homes in Lombardy and Venice. Travellers and the public press have made such freauent and loud complaints of the way in which matters are managed on the Lombardo-Venetian railroads that the Board of the company has at last thought proper to notice them. It is also probable that the Archduke Ferdinand Maximila has complained to the Central Government of the negligence of the railroad authorities, for a commision, consisting of four members of the Board, has been ordered to inquire into the conduct of the employjS, and to make such changes in the administration as may appear necessary. Some alterations, wvhich experience has showrn to be conducive to the benefit of all parties, are also to be made in the Custom-house regulations. On Thursday, the 26th of November, the Bund held its usual weekly sitting, and empowered the Military Commision to make the nec rep- in the military edifices at Mayence. It aso ordered that a fund should be established for arming the federal fortress of Rastadt. According to reliable advices from Mayence, the damage done to the city is considerably less than was at first stated. It is estimated that the repair of the military buildings will cost about 183,000fl.; and that the expense of putting the damaged churches into order will be somewhat less than 100,000. LAs the official estimate of the value of the 40 houses deetroyed in the old Kastrich is but 32,000L (about 3,0001.), they must have been mere wooden huts or barracks. On the 26th inst. the liberal donation of their Austrian Majesties was already in the hands of the Impeetal agent at the Court of eese-Dartad and the whole sum (2,2001.) was immediately for- warded to the authorites at Mayence. The report that the body of Wiemer, the Austrian artilleryman, had been found in the Rhine is now eontradieted. The man is missng, but nothing whatever is kmown of his fate. About 18,0007i. have been subscribed in this city by private individuals for the relief of the sufferors at Maynee. The exEmperor Ferdinand and the Empre Maria Ann, have contributed 5,000fl. The Council of the Empire is atill opposed to the repeal of the usury laws, but it iz positively ridiculous that the legal rate of interet should be but 5 per cent. A landed proprietor of high rank and standing yesterday wanted to mortgage one of his estates to a mercantile man of my acquaintance, but he was unable to obtain the desired accommoda. tion, although he offered " to make any sacrifice that might be required." The reply given to him was *-" If I were to lend you money at 6 per cent. on security I should be guilty of usury, and punishable; but for many a long day some of the most respectable houses in VTieDn have been paying 8 and 9 per cent. discount." As a consequence of the absurd usury laws, those mem who are rich in land but poor In puree find it almost impossible to Carry on the necessagriculturl ope. rations.* The completion of the railroads from SzolnoktoDebreczin and from Szeedin to Tomesvar is of the highest importaice to e Hungarians, who can now easily send their corn to the foreign and home market.. A person who has just returned from the Banat stateEthat there are prodigious quantities of corn nrow lying in Temesvar and in the places in the environ. Acording to the calculation of the Austrian corn merchant., prime Banat wheat may be had at Trieste for .3. (6s.) the A-aatrian metzen. Dysentery ,.d oholerine are now endemio in Vienna, and forew m'nr edical men are inclined to attribute the prevalee * e such complaints to the " abuse" of water. Their meaning probably in, that the Austrians would do well to use more water externally and lees intenally. It is whispered in mitary cices that Fleld Marhal Count Jellachich ha been placed on the unattached list. The reason given for the measure Is, that the gallant Ban of Croatia was not always inclined to obey the orders which he received from V ienna. HAMBURG. A telegram from Hamburg, dated the 3d instnt, says ;- " A general meeting of Hamburg merchants has been held at the Exchange. A proposal of the Senate hm been accepted, that in the case of a house stopping payment, the majority of the creditors shall decide whether such house is to be managed by a committee or declared bankrupt. "The Danish Government h advanced five millions of francs as a loan. " Two Directors of the Copenhagen Bank are to proceed to Hamburg to redeem some of the protested bills.

BTATR OF TRADE. MA&NCHESTER Dlzc 4. The market has relapsed into the same qiet Juiness that prevailed last week. The Improvement on Tuesda as we then stated, solely due to lhe letters to hand from India and China, and the orders brought by them having been placed, the temporary impetus Impare to business for a day or two has been wholly lost. Spinners and manufac. turers, who in the early part of the week were holding for a sight advane, are now anxious sellers again at the lowest previous terms. Meanwhile the large home trade and foreign mercantile houses are buying with extreme caution, and in m ases are doing next to nothing. There is extreme uwingness to increase their engagements until the money-market is in an easier state, and they have seen how the present commer. cial crUis will end. A curious feature of lt month' ports is that 68 per cent. of all the coth shipped was to India, China, and Central and South America, while 78 per cent. of all the yarn shipped was Buropean Sprtes.
RErzsENATrION op' AsuTON....A~t a mieeting of leading Liberals in Aehton.under-Lyne on Wednesday the names of Mr. Milner Gibson, Mr. Booth Mlason of Lea. mington, Mr.F. D. T Astley, of Duklafeld, andMr. Edward Watlcin were mentioned, but alArg maority were In favour of zoliciting Mr. Gibson to offer =h2.elf. The Mranc4iew AMaminer of yesterday says :-.The lamented death of Mr. Charles Hindley, late MP. for Ashtonunuder-Lyne, having created a vacancy for that borough in Parliament, active steps are being taken with a view to the selection of a candidate. We understand that of the gentlemen whose names have been mnentioned the Right Ron. Mimner Gibson has been received with the highest amount of favour, and 'that a reauWstlon to that gentleman is new in cours of signte.Teelectors of Ashton know their duty too well to delegate to others the .r"~nsibility of choosing a fit and proper person to represent their convictions mad interests in the House of Coinmous. We have confidence that their selection will be a wise one. Should their ohoice fall on Mr. Gibson, we can state confidently that he is ready to place himself at their disposal. It would be absurd for us to at. tempt, even at this stage of the proceedings, to hide our senUents regar(ling Air. Gibson bechind a veil of studied indifference ; his political connexidon with this city is too recent, and our high admiration of his, in many respects, unmatched ParliAmentary abilties too well knw.Sould the electror of Ashton agree to send Mr. Gibson to Parlix. menti, they wil probably do more than any one borough In England to increase the business efficiency of the Houtse of Commons, while they will restore to his right place a nma whose attachment to Liberal principles has been demonstrated by unusual sacrifices, and who has ever proved himself the uncompromising advocate of the rights and interests of th&eoule.TIT AT MANCRESTER.-At a meeting of the Manchester Board of Guardians held yestezday, Mr. Ilye Macklde the mayor of the city, attended by the town clerk, was present to ma'ke an application on behalf of the handlooma.weavers. The mayor said that a deputation of handloom-weaver had waited upon him on Tuesday at the request of a public me-ling of this class of operatives, and he attended at their request to state that in the labour test applied to -applicants for relief from that body, now out of workr, they were offere a description of 'wozrk quite unsuited to the habits and constitution of men accustomedl to indoor emiployment, and to ask if some relaxation of the present rules on this subject could not be entertained. A conversation ensued at the board, in the course of which the chairman (Mr. Ricalrds) said, that the Iguardians had three maodes of dealing with such applicants. la man was not in good health h a aenit h houe, rhee b ha th avantage Of good food and maedical advioe; if he was in health and had bean subjected to indoor employmnent, with a constitution unfiLted for outdoor emPloYment, he was sent to work inn buIlding fitted for the labour as such, while in the case of strong bardy.looking men only was; the outdoor test on the farm at Crumpsalla&P led.The guardians thought thero was nogoz o . eaair of the rules, said they were prepared to act liberally towards the po,cnitnl wit their rules, and should be able ro deal with the predent destitution among the working classes, great as it. was. in answer to some questions put to them the hoard deprecated anyotherateps bingtaken to meetth difficulties in which the working-classes ha been placed than that provided by the law.
I MONY-MAZTataI.TY.LZ=yZI.Ny. I ---- 49b The funds opened steadily- radoayE,ngt I2a&i vance of an eighth, and, although *bere was Suel-6.| quently some heavines, a decided recmcvey toolr placebeforethe terminatiou of buudnireL CuW' for money were first quoted 91.j tXo g; nb tey soon went to 91 to J. They thon remained for some tiuse with an unseted appearane, and at the officil close the quotation was 91t to i. After regular hours there was a, renewal of firmnnn, and 'everal operations wero oeected at 91j to J for monoy and 92t to i or 904 to I ex. dividend for the 7th of Januar. Among the causs of the ultimate buoyancy were the arrivat of the Adrlatic with 80,0001. in apecie, and satisfaotory commercial intelligence from Now York, the fact of the heavy payments due tofday (the 4th of the nonth) having ow. the whole-been extremely well met, and the forced closing of some speculative operations for a baL Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 90o to i; New Three per Oents, 904 to J; India Stck, 217 to 220; India Bonds, 33S. to 25S. dicount; and Exchequer-bills, 4. discount to par. The demand at the Bank and in the dicountmarket continues active, but-the payments maturing to-dsy have been provided for In a much more stisfactory manner than had been anticipated. Throughout the afternoon the names of many of the best houses in London were recklessy, and without a shadow of foundation, coupled with rumours of embarrassment. In the foreign stock-market the chief feature is the continued demand for Mexican, although the highest price m wre not fully maintained. Dutch Was flatter from sale, on foreign account. Other descrptions were steady. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 97j and 98*; Mexican, for the account, 19* and 19; Portuguese, for the account, 43; RiBIan Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96 and 95*; ditto, Small, 97; Sardlnlan, 85*; forthe account, 86; TurkIsh Six per Cents., 91f; for the account, 91*, 92, and 91*; ditto Fonr per COent. Guanteed, 99k; Dutch Two-and-as-Half per Cents, 62i; and the Four per Cent. Certificate., 96. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates wereabout the same ulat post, but in many instances they were almoot nominal, from the absnce of busineas. The final quotations of the French Thre per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 46c. for money, and 67f. 60c. for the end of the month, showing a reaton of an eighth. The corn-maket was dull this morning, at the rates of Monday. In the iUverpool cotton-market this -week an advance has occurred of Jd per lb., but towards the close there has been much heavines. The amount of gold taken to the Bank to-day was about 20,0001. The private advice. from Paris describe a calm and satifactory state of the money-market, and mention that there is even an expectation of a further reduction In the rate of discount. The acounts from Hamburg this evening are again unfavourable. It Is reported that the proposed law granting 30 days extension on all bills due has been adopted. The supenson has been announced of Mes. F. and A. Bovet, an old established firm in the trade with China, with moderate lisabilities Their difficulties are understood to have been principaly caused by the late heavy fall in the silk-market. The stoppage has also taken place of Mesr. C. A. Jonas and Co., general merchants, who have been brought down by the recent failures in the North of lurope. Their liabilities are xupposed to amount to about 100,000. Annexed is the circular issued 52, Graeechurch-treh*e Dec. 4. "In oonsequence of the disasters which have befallen the tride between this country and the Baltic, espespaily Sweden, we are under the pdanful necesidty of suspending our payments; the position of our affairs will be reported to you Aa soon as practicble by Mesrs Quilter, BalI, and Co., to who-. inveptigaton we have submitted our books. " In the meantime we have to beg the kind forbeance of our ceditors. "We reman, &c., . O., 2 JONAS AND CO." It is presumed the Government in determining not to repeal the Bank Charter Act have also resolved to intimate before the termination of the presnt seion that it is intended that the law should henceforth be respected, that all persons must therefore take warning that any commercial engagements they may-voluntarily enter Into will be subject to its operation, and that, after this fair notice, whatever may be the position in which they may choose to place themselves, there must be no idea of appealing to Government to throw the con. sequences on other shoulders. It is obvious that if the possibility of a new infringement of the existin, system is again contemplated, either for 1867 or any other period, due provision should at once be made for such a contingency, in order that the interference should come in a legal manner, instead of In the demoralizing shape of the suspension of a solemn enactment, under which the financial responsibilities of every individual in the kingdom are supposed to be regulated, at the pleasure of the Ministers of the Crown. In insisting upon a well-ordered course for the future there is no necessity to condemn the step recently adopted. The justification, or at all events the apology for the Government, is perfectly plain, although perhaps they will themselves adopt some other method of defence, founded on the routine platitudes about the serious consequences that would have fallen on the commercial community. It is that, owing to the Betting aside of the Act in 1847, a precedent had been established which entitled the speculators and the indebted classes generally to go to the Government and say, " We hase a right to expect that what was done then will be done now. Subsequently to that occasdon there was no announcement that the lawwould henceforth be inflexibly upheld in its integrity, and that we must consequently be prepared for all that might happen under it; weshave relied upon rellec whenever we might be in a position to declare its pressure unbemable. We have therefore made no preparation for any other result, and we now, at the twelfth hour, throw upon you the responsibility of refusal" Moreover, if the Miniser had dis- mimed the appeal on the ground that the petitioners bad made their bargains with their eyes open, and that, if they had been improvident, it would be oetter that the natural leson should be borne at any Cost than that the State should begin a system of meddling with private contracts, which, once commenced, must be extended to all the vicissitudes of trading indiscretion, the argument would not have been valid. The rejoinder could have been made, " But you do meddle, and all that we now ask is that you should meddle again, in order to repair the consequences of your previous meddling. You have meddled to prevent joint-stock banks from being formed upon such principles as the people, in the exercise of their own sagacity, might deem best; and it is to the viclous and extraordinary power wielded by these joint-stock banks that the present convulsion is to be traced. You have meddled by establishing cur- 4 rency laws for Scotland different from those of I England, and, lastly, you have meddled by compel. ling the Banl; of England to publish a weekly account of its banking reserve, calculated at all times of emergency to cause panic; while you proclaim that its constitntion is precisely the same as that of every other bank in the kingdom from which no such return is required. You have alao contrived xo to miL np this *vhn with that of the issue department, ",,hich eSlougs solely to the uation, as to c- 'perwtual confusion in the public mind. -i .ve them inconsistencies, and then you may I t P1 talk of consistency on any other point." it 'c _ . thatthedeparturefromnprinciple inone m,p- precludes the posibility of its rigid enforcementin another. Governmenthave hitherto asumed functions 'with which they have no proper concern, and the available plea is that previous empirical steps were to be met only by a remedy of an analogous dencriptlon. Hence there is reaUy no charge against them for their late pliability. The reproach wil be if they neglect to eetablish a clear understanding for the future, and to proclaim a -logical oourse, to condsit in the avowed and entire recognition either of the French plan of surveillance 'or of the more congenial doctrine of the fredora of trade from all artificil trammels There may perhaps be differenoes of opinion as to which la the 'best, but no one will dispute-that amixture of the two can never answer. A report was generally.circulated this afternoon that the Cr&dit Mobi@lor will find it necessary to pau the next dividend period without making any distribution, but it was not traced to any authority. lt is believed that the first fortnight inDocember is the time for their annual vluation of asset., and the statement may have arisen from unfavourable anticipations as to the resmlts that will be exhibited on the present occaion. A meeting of creditors of Messr. J. Foot and Sons, xilk manufacturers, whose suspension was announced on the 10th ult., was held to-day, when by a statement of affairs submitted by Mr. Jay, tbe aoountant, the liabilitles were stated to be 27,640., while tho assets were etimated at 24,4721. after deducting for certain claims to be paid in fulL ,On the 30th of June last the firm had a capital or 12,7001., and the failure baa arisen from extensive lose on depreciation of silk, bad debts, &c. Its immediate cause was the suspenson of Meso Bennoch, Twentymnan and Co. The house has been established about 90 years, and the creditors prent expresed their sympathy with the partners, and their confidence that their whole conduct has been perfectly straightforward. A proposition that a composition be accepted of 15s. In the pound, payable in instalments extending over 18 months from the ldt inst, the last instalment to be secured, waa agreed to, and two creditors were appointed to act as inspector In the produoe market this week an improved tone wa apparent at the commencement, which ha not been maintained. There seems, however, to be lem anxiety on the part of holders to realize at the present low quotations. Good to fine grocery sugar haa met with a steady sale at Is. to is. 6d. above the rates of lst week, but to-day the market was less animated, the advance being hardly supported, while low to middling descriptions went off heavily at about 6d. reduction, a large proportion being taken In. Business in coffee has been chiefly confined to the moderate supplies of plantation Ceylon brought forward, which at one time went at a slight improvement, that has sines been lost. Some transactions in Bengal rice haveoc curred at [Is. above the lowest rates current last week. There is now a limited inquiry for common kdnds in the face of the excessive stock on hand. The spice-market has been dull, the few sales effected being at a conslderable reduction, owing to the numerous arrivals. A more awtive demand for saltpetre has arisen, at an advance of fully 2L. Advices from Calcutta represent the supply as having further accumulated, and the stock here continues large. The tea-market has been depressed, and at present it is almost imposible to effect sales. The colonial wool sales, which commenced on the 12th of November, closed this evening. According to a circular of Messrs. Southey and Son, the total comprised was 44,853 bales. First-cs Sydnev wool showed very little decline, but Australian wool generally suffered a reduction of 2d., and in some cases 4d. per lb. Cape descriptions, owing to the absence of foreign competition, were almost unsaleable, and only a portion of the quantity offered was disposed of at a decline of between 3d. and 4d. It is estimated that about 15 per cent. of. the whole of the wool brought forward was withdrawn or bought in. The return from the ]Bank of England for the week ending the 2d of December gives the following results when compared with the previous week - Pubio Depodts Â£... 6,072,267 ...

JUDICIAL COMMITTRE OF PRIVY CoUNCIL, Dec 4. THE CASE OF ARCHDDEACON DENISON-. DITCCIER V. DENISON. (BefOre Lord ofSticc zXG BRUCE, Lord Justiee TuR R NBi,hop of LoSixr , AJr. ?P M RRTOx LEIGH, Sir E. RYAN, and Sir- J. P.&TIp-sozo Isau appeua trom the Court of Arohes. In order to render intelligible the point upon which their Lordships' decision is sought, it is nessary to give a sumimary of tho various prooiedings whioh have been taken in the case up to the present time. The Venerable George Anthony Deni. son, Archdeacon of Taunton and Vicar of Bast Brent, iD the diocess of Bath and Wells, preached two sermons in the cathedral church of the diocess on the 7th of August and on - the 6th of November, 1853, which, in the opinion of the Rev. Joseph Ditcher, Vicar of South Brent in the same diocess, maintained doctrine contrary to the Articles of the Church of England. On the 4th of February, 1854, Mr. ])teher laid a complaint beforo the bishop, who, however, declined to take Pnyproceedings In respect of it. In MAy, 1854, the bishop di, and Mr. Ditcher laid a similar complaint before his successor, the present bishop, who also dedined to interfere. Mr. Ditcher next applted, in Octo. ber, 1854, to the Archbishop of Canterbury to issve a com. mission under the Church Discipline Act (3d and 4th of Victoria, cap. $6), to try the question of the soundness of the doctrine maintained by the arhodeacon. In the meantime the two sermons were published by the archdeacon, together with a third, which he had preashed on the 14th of May, 1864, A. commission was issued by tho archbishop, and on the 10th of January, 1855, the conmissioners reported that there was prtimi facieevidence for insttuting further proceedings against the archdeacon. Mr. Ditcher thereupon drew up articles of acusation, a copy of which was served u ponk the archdeacon, on the 4th of August, 1855. The archbishop, however, declined to procee further in the matter, and Mr. Ditcher then apphed to the Court of Queen's Bench, which grted a mandamus compelling him to prooeed. Articles of accusation were accordingly exhibitedagainst the archdeacon in the Diocesan Court of Bath and Wells, and on the 5th of June, 1856, the archbishop issued a notice or requisition to the archdeacon, which was served upon him on the 10th of June, to appear there and answer those articles. The Bishopof Bath and Wells being the patron of the living of East Brent tho archbishop presided at the trial in his stead, in prsUaDnC of the 24th section of the Church Discipline Act. The Diocan Court pronounoed the archdeacon's doctrine to be unsound, and upon his refusal to recant sentence of deprivation was pronounced aainst him on the 23d of October, 1856, under the 2 section of the 13th of Elizabeth, cap. 12. Against that sentence the a-chdeacon appealed to the Court of Appeal of the provinoe, but the learned judge of that court, Sir J. Dodson, refused to entertain the appeal, on the ground that the sentence having been pronounced by the archbishop it could not be reviewed by the Archbishop's Court. The Court of Queen's Bench, however, overruled the learned judge's decision, and held that the archbishop was present in the diocesan court merely as the locun tenen3 of the bishop, and the case was therefore sent back to the Court of Arches. Sir John Dodson then reversed the sentenoe of deprivation pronounced by the Diocesan Court, on the ground thit the offence of which the archdeacon was accused had not been committed within two years of the commencement or institution of the suit. This was the dedsion against which Mr. Ditcber now appealed The 20th section of the Church Discipline Act, upon the construction of which the only question before their Lcrdships depends, enacts " that every suit or proceeding against any such clerk in holy orders for any offence against the laws ecclesiastical shall be commenced within two years after the commission of the offence in respect of which the suit or prooeeding shall be instituted, and not afterwards." Sir Fitzroy Kelly and Dr. Bayford were oounsel for the a?pellnt; the Admiralty Advocate and Mr. Coleridge for t ezespondeut. Sir F. KErLY opened the ease on behalf of the appellant, and said, the simple question for their Lordshipn' decision was whether, under the Church Discipline Act, the perlod of Iwo years, within which proceedings were to be taken under that Act against a clergymans charged with an offence against the ecclesiastical law, was to be reckoned from the issuing of the commission by the bishop or the archbishop, or from the fillng of articles of acousation by the complain. ant, subsequent to the report of the commission; or whether, as the respondents contended, it was to be reckoned from the date of the requirement or notice of the archbishop to the person accused to appear before him and make answer to the arlicles of accusation. He should contend that, where the terms of an Act were ambiguous, that construction should be put upon it which would carry into eflect its manifest object in preference to a construction by which its object would be altogether defeated. The first step pointed out by the Act in a proceeding of this kind*which was a proceeding sui gene7ris, the creature of the Act, was the issuing of a commission by the bishop, either of his own mere motion or upon the complaint of a competent per. son. If after inquiry thecommission reported that there wasa 2)rim4 facie case for further proceedings, then the complain. ant might take such " further proceedings," and if he omitted to do so the blshop had power to interfere, in order that they might not beheld in te-sorem over the head of the person acoused for an indefinite period. The preliminary proceedings consequent upon the issuing of the commission generally took place in public, and, if the construction contended for on the other side were correct, there was actually no limit to the time subsequent to the offence charged in which a commission might be issued. A clergyman might be charged with adultery or any other atrocious crime 20 years after the period at which it was alleged to have been committed. This point pressed upon the mind of Dr. Lushington, the Judge of the Diocesan Court, who accordingly held that the original proceeding before the commission was the " commencement of the proceedings." It was doubtful whether the bishop had power to refuse to issue a commission when a complaint was laid against a clergyman, but if he had not, could the Legislature have intended to enable any person to institute criminal proceedings against a clergyman without any limit as to the period, subsequent to the alleged commission ot the offence, at which they were to be instituted? If the commission reported that there was a primdfafe case for further proceeding, the next stepe wvere the filing of articles of accusation in the court of thediocess, the service ofacopy of these articles upon the person accused, and at the expiration of 14 days after such service notice to the person a cused to appear and answer before the bishop in respect of those articles. Surely, this notice was not a commencement of proceedings, but a continuation of the proceedings already commenced by the commission, consequent upon the report of the commission. It was an act done, not by the complainant or plaintiff, as he might be called, but by the bishop or archbishop. If the respondent's construction were to preval it would, in a msjority of cases, be in the power of any person agaInst whom proceedings were taken under this Act, unless the complainant proceeded with unbecoming precipitation, so to protract those proceedings as e. tirely to defeatthe object for whichtheAct was passed. StilisteOnger was the argument that, even if the commencement of the proceedings were not taken to be the issuing of the commission, it must be taken to be the service of the copy of articles of accusation upon the person acoused, The requisition of the bishop, issued in consequence of the lling of articles by the complainant, and of the zeport of the commissioners, could not be deemed an original proceeding. The learned gentleman concluded by referring to the two cases of "- The Bishop of Lincoln v. Day" (4 Notes of Cases, p. 299), and " Brooks v. Cres. well" (4 Notes of Cases, p. 479), in which SirEH. Jenner Fust held that the two years must be computed from the date of the alleged offence to that of the citation to appear before the bishop or archbishop. In these cases, he said, letters of request were issued and a regular suit promoted; besides the principles there laid down had never been questioned inthe Court of AppeaL Dr. BAYFORD followed on the same side. The ADNap.ALTVY ADVOCATE, on behalf of the respondent, observed in the first place that this being a proceeding of a criminal nature the statute under which it was instituted must, according to every recognized rule of construction, be construed in favour of the nerson accused. The Church Discipline Act was, he iubmitted, passed with three objects-the first being the provision of a method of inquiry into charges of all kinds, even those founded upon the vaguest rumours against clergymen, which it effected by means of a commission ; the next being the improvement of the mode of procedure in the Diocesan Court; and the third and most important 'oeing the limitation of time) within which proceedings of this kind might be commenced. The statute was one of a highly criminal nature, and there vas abundant autbority that the rneral words of such a statute ought to be restrained in avour of the person coused. That rule was particularly applcable to a case like the present, in which their Lord. ships were asked to reverse the decision of a competent tribunal in. favour of a defendant, a decision in perfect accordance with fornmer decisions of ecclesisstical tribunals upon the same point. But he submitted that there could be no doubt that the proceeding before the commission was a mere preliminary inquiry whether a suit should be instituted, no one being obliged to attend before the commissioners, and no one being bound by their report. There was nothing in the nature of a suit or judicial proceeding commenced until the Diocesan Court interfered. The proceeding before commissioners was described as " preliminary." To what could it be preliminary but to the institution of a suit? The suit did not commence until the bishop, under his hand, required the party to appear at a certain place and make answer to the charge, usnder penalty, in case of his refusal to appear, of being proceeded against in his absence. It had been contended that the euit commenced when the articles were filed by the complainant and served upon the clergymamn acuzed; but their Lordships must remember first, that all these proceedings were taken, not in the name of the complainant but in the name of the bisnop; ana, secondiy, that the artiles so served upon the clergyman speciied neither timue nor place at which he was to answer them, and that he might take not the slightest notice of them without incurring any penalty. In this case eight months elapeed between the service of the articles and the service of the archbishop's citation, and there was no reason why eight years might not have elapsed. If their Lordships held the service of the articles to be the commencement of the suit they would extend indefinitely the time during which proeedings under this statute might be kept hanging over a clergyman's head. The learned gentleman, in conclusion, read the judgment of Dr. Lushington, who acted as one of the archbishop's assessors in the Diooesan Court, and contended that it was founded on the erroneous assumption that the court was not a dicesan court, but a tribunal of co-ordinate if not of superior jurisdiction to the Arches, and therefore not bound by the precedents of the Arches. Under all the cirecm. stances of the case, as neither the interests of any person nor those of the church would be prejudiced by the cco. firmation of the decision of the Court below the bi'hops aud the archbishop before whom the case had been brought having all expressed their unwillingness that it should be prcseuted, he honed their Lordships would put an end to the protacted Ld harassing litigation In which the re. spondent had been engaged by dismissing the appeal. At the concusion of the learned counsel's argument their Lordship. adjouned. No day was fixed for hewring the remainder of the arguments. ;
VIaF-CEE.WCBLLOM8 COUTSR n)l,- S BROOK V. BROOL-NRIAGE AT ALTONA OF A BRITISH SUBJECT DOMICILED In HGLA2,D WITH THE SISTBR OP HIS DECEASED WIFE. (JJcore Vi 0hancUor Sir JOHN STUA'T and Mr. JUgiCe CRESSWELL.) Mr. Justice CR3L$SWZLL this morning delivered his judgment in this case, which involves the question of the validity in this country of the marriage At Altona, in the duchy of Soleswig-Holatein, where, by the lex loci, such marriages are sid to be legal, of a British subject domieiled in England with the sister of his deceased wife. The followlng are the facts of the case :-In 1847 Charlotte, the firs wife of the late William Lefgh Brook, of Meltham-hball, near Huddersfield, died. By her he had one son An,! one daughter. In 1850 Wiliam Leigh Brook intermarried at Altonainthe duchy of Schleswlg-Holstein, with Emily, thesister of his deceLsed wlie, On the 17th of August, 1855, Mrs. Brook died at Frankfort of cholera, and two days afterwards Mr. Brook died of the same disease at Cologne, By bis aecond wife Mr. Brook had one xon and two daughters. By his will, which was dated on the day of his death, Mfr. Brook gave his real and personal etate, which was of considerable value, to the children of his two marriages in Certain proportions. In 1856 Charles Armitage Brook, the son by the second marriage, died. It the second marrge was valid, and the children thereof, therefore legitimate, the son of Mr. Brook by his first mirage succeeded by inheritanoe to Charles Armitage Brook'e share of Mr. Brook's real estate, and the four surviving children of the two marriages succeeded as next of kin to Charles Arnitage Brook's share of Mr. Brook's personal estate. But if the second marrlage was invalid, and the children thereof therefore illegitimate, the Crown was entitled to Charles Armitage Broek'a share of Mr. Brook's real and personsl estate. Further, if the marriage of Mr. Brook with the sister of his deceased wife was valid, the duty payable by the srviving children of the second marriage on their succeeding to their fathers property would be only U. per cent., whereas if such marriage were invalid, and they should be illegitimate, they would pay the duty of 101. per cent., which is the duty payable by strangers who suooeed to the property of a deceased person. The contest in the present case, which was a suit for obtaining a declaration by the Court of the rights And in. terestU of all parties in and to Mr. Brook's real and personal estate, was between the eldest son by the first marriage, who cimed to be heir-at-law of Charles Armitage Brook, and al the surviving children of the two marriages, who claimed to be the next of kin of Charles Armitage Brook on the one hand, and the Crown on the other hand. YAtters of administratlon had not yet been taken out to Charles Anmitage Brook. Prior to the 5th nd 6th of William IV, cap. b4, the marriage of a widower with the sister of his decuAed wife was voidable in the Ecclesiastiocl Court, as being a marriage within the prohibited degrees of affinity, but such marriage was voidable only dozing the life of both parties, and, if not avoided during the life of the parties, it could not after the death of either be questioned. In 185, however, that Act, which is entitled "An Act to render certain Marriages valid and to alter the Law with respect to certain voidable Marriges, " was passed, and by the first section, it was enated that all marriages celebrated before the passing of the Act between persons within the prohibited degrees of affinity should not thereafter be annulled for that cause by any sentence of the Ecclesiastical Court, unless pronounced in a suit then pending; and by the second section it was enacted that all marriages celebrated between persons vithin the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity should be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposes vhatsoever. The case was argued before the Vioe-Chancellor and Mr. Justice Cresswell on the 20th, 21st, 24th, and 25th ult., and each day's arguments were fully reported in The Time. Sir Fitzroy Kelly, Mr. Malins, and Mr. George Lake Russell were counsel for the plaintisi; Mr. Elmsley,Mr.Cleasby (ofthe common law bar), and Mr.Pemberton for the defendants in the same interest with the plaintiffs; and the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, and Mh-. Wickena for the Crown. Mr. Justice CnxESwxvL.-In this case I have been called upon by Vice-Chancellor Stuart to assist him by giving my opinion as to the validity or invalidity of a mnarriage solemnized at Altona, in the kingdom of Denmark, between William Leigh Brook and Emily Armitage, the sister of W. L. Brook's former wife, then deceswd. In answer to certain inquiries, the chief clerk of the Vioe-ChanceUor certified as follows:-" That W. L. Brook and Emily Armitage were respectively, up to and at the time of such marriage, and at the time of their respctive deaths, domiciled in England, and that they had not any permanent residence in the eountry where they married; that the marriage between W. L. Brook and the said Emily Armitage was a lawful marriage acoording to the law of the duchy of Holstein; and that, acoording to the same law, the children of such marriage are legitimate children." Upon the latter part of the oertificate It was obeerved in argument that it must be taken as a certificate that such marriages between Danish subjects are good, and not that the Danish courts would hold them good when solemnized between the subjects of Another country domicUed in that country where such mArriages are prohibited by law. The opinion which I have formed in this case renders it unnecessary to inquire into that matter. For, even assuming that in Denmark the marriage now in question would be held good, I think that by the law of England it was invalid, and the children of the parties to it iUegitimate. The question depends upon the effect to be given to the statute, oth and 6th of William IV., cap. 54. By the first section it is enacted " that all marriageswhich shall have been celebrated before the am;ing of this Act between persons being within the prohibited degrees of affinity shallUnot hereafter be nnulled for that cause by any sentence of the Eccledastical Court unless pronounced in a suit which shall be deDend. ing at the time of thepassing of this Act," &c. The second section enacted, "That all marriages which shall hereafter be celebrated between persons within the prohi. bited degrees of consanguinity or affinity shall be absolutely null and void to aU intents andfpurposes whatsoever." Now, putting tho narrowest construction on the words of this statute, it oertainly had the effect of rendering absolutely void all such marriages between parties within the prohibited degrees as would, without the aid of the statute, have been voidable by the Ecclesiastical Court. The question to be considered, then, is whether the marriage under consideration would have been so voidable. Had it been celebrated in England there could be no doubt that it would have beea voidable. In "Sherwood v. Ray" (1, Moore, P. C. C., 395), Baron Parke, in pronouncing the opinion of the Judicial Committee, usedjthis language:- "That maniage-viz.. etweenta widower andUO himderaoseiwife'. s5er-having been celebrate4 ibetween persons within the Levitlcil degree,, sad prohibited frosnluarrylng by Rler scriptures as inters'reted by the eanon law adeby the statute 25th of Henry VII., was unquestlouabi voldable during the lifetime of both, and might have been annulled by criminal proceedins or civil uit." And this sttement ofhthe law was fully adopted by the Court of Queen's Bench in "Regina v. Chadwick" (11 Q. B. lIep., 205). Indeed, this point was hardly disputed by the learned counsel who contended for the validity of this marriage. But they relied on the fact of the marriage having been celebrated in Denmark, where such marriages are held valid, and contended that by the law of nations questions of this sort aro to be decided according to the law of the country where the marriage takes place; and many cases decided by most eminent persons were cited in which that principle was said to have been recognized and to have received full effbctb.Z-forbear to enter into an examination of them at present, iforlin none of them was a marriagein question which was contrary to the law of God and Holy Scripture. In order to [make 'the cases relied upon applicable to the present, it was necessary to show that the same respect would be paid to the law of a foreign country recognizing a marriage contrary] to what we deem to be God's law. No such decision can be found In the absence of any direct authority writers on international law were resorted to, and many passages were read to the Court from Story's CommentarieY one the Cocict of Lalcs. In section 113 he says:- e The general principle certainly Is (as we havo alreadyseen) that betweenpersons ' nasl nmarriago ito be decided bytbelawof the place where It is celebrated 0 It alf d there, It Is valid everywhere It has a legal ubiquity of obligation. If invalid there, It s equally Invalid everywhere.1 In section 113 (a), he says- "The moet Drominent, if not the only known exception. to the Iule are those musagee involving polypmy and inoest; those peitlively prohibited by the eubUio hew of a country fom motle<ot poUcy; and theoe celebrated in foreign countrie by subject entitling themselves under speciallWrcumatanceseto the benefit of the laws of their own country." Again, in section 114 he prooeeds- " In resped ct the Efit exceptlon, that of marriages in volving polygamy and Inces, Chrbltiamtty Is underztood to probibit pelpgamY and Incest; and, therefore, no Obritian oountr wouldre_ cogoize polygamy or incestuous marriages, bue when we sek of Inoestuous n-zlaiges Ore must be taken to conafe the doctrine to e,ch cew as by tho genera consnt of all Chritendom ae deemed Incestuoxus" To this latser pasge I cannot give my assent. How is a judge sitting in an English court of justice called upon to decide whether a marriage be incestuous or not to be guided in bis decision ? Surely, if the law of his own country has already settled what is incestuous or the contrary, by that be must be governed. Is he to inquire into the opinions of all other nations in which Christianity exists, and to adopt that rule which is aoertained to prevail among the greater number, and to say that it shall be acted upon in defianoe of the law of his own country ? This would, indeed, be enlarging the comitus gentium to an extent hitherto unheard of. For the purpose of deciding whether a manrag be incestuous er not I feel bound to ascertain what Is the law of Englaud, and to give effect to it. Examining that law I fnd that, according to many decisons, such marriages are held to be prohibited by Holy Scripture, that they are within the degrees of affinity prohibited by God's law and punishablo as incestnous, and must therefore here be deemed to fall within the exceptions stated in Story, section 113 (a), and not to be recognized In this Chrbs tian country. If that were otherwise, ana we were bound by the comoius gentium to hold this a good marriage, this consequence would follow. An Englshman domiciled in this country cohabiting with the sister of his deceaed wife, whether he has celebrated a marriage with her or note Is deemed to be guilty of inoest and punishable by our eolesiasoal law; but by taking a short voyage to Denmark, and celebrating a marriage there, he would aequire the privilege of returning to this country and maintaining an intercoure by our law deemed incestuous with perfect impunity. These con siderations satidy me thot the marriage would have been voidable before the statue 5th and 6th of William IV., c. 54, wa pase6d, and that by foroe of that Act it was absolutely void to all intents and purposes. This opinion as to the voidable character of the marriage in question, although celebrated in Altona, makes it not absolutely neoemay that I should express any opinion upon another question which wua discased with much learning and abilty-wir, whe. ther the general expresions tat have on various oecwsions Mallen from the most eminent judges in this country as to the validity of marria here, if valid in the country where celebrated, are to be construed in the widest senso which can be asribed to them according to the ordinary meaning of the English language, or whether they re to be limted and restrained by an implied proviso that such marriages are not contrary to the laws of this country. leverthel.e@, as it is a pit which, if settled one way, would disoose of the mal though my opinion, already expressed, ehould he held to be erroneous, I think I ought not to avoid entering into the question; and I do so 'rith the less hesitation, as my opinion on this very import at smbject wil be open to review, and no doubt will be reviewed in thisver Sir George Hay, in pronounclng judgment in." aford v. Morris" (2 Hagg, cnsit. Reports, 423), expreased an opinion tnat marriages of English subjects havingan English domicile, celebrated In other countries, have been held vaiid, not merely because they would be valid according to the laws of those countries, but because they were not con. trary to the law of England.

True, but had the consatitudon of a marriage been in question and not the dissolution, the result must have been the same By the 9th of George IV., c, 31, a 22, it was enacted,1- '1 That if any peron, being married, shall marr any other pemsn dringtbe siottheiLoat husbandor wife, whetherthesecondg ma ae shall have taken plaoe in England or eiewhess evety soh ..feder shall be gnuity of felony." q sppose after the Sootch divorce the main hAd nia otied in Scotland, that marriage would have been good tohrs; would It therefore hove been good here? If It would, thenL the man might have returned to England with his second wife, and had two lawful wives living at the same tine by marriages held to be valid by our own law. Some rather embarrassing quesIons would have arisen out of sich a state of things. Would both wives have been dowable? If the second had had a son born, and the first had had a son bor n b afteards, which would have been heir to the father ?

There is nothing in that czse to show that if the parties had been British subjects domiciled in England, and it had been cont.anr to our law, and the courts of this country hod been called upon to adjudicate with regard to it, they would have held it valid. The next case in order of time was "'Scrimahire v. Scrislshire"l (2Hagg,Cons Rep., 39). Thesetwo British sbjectshad been married in France. A suit was instituted here for the restitution of conjugal rights, The validity of the marriage was denied, as being a foreign marriage not celebrated so. cording to the laws of the country in which it was contracted ; and a sentence of the Parliament of Parls declaring the marriage null was also pleaded. Dealing with that question, Sir EdwArd Simpson, In giving his judgmentt, said,- "The Court was of opion then (aluding to scoe earlier prooeed. toga In the oae), and still i t foreign senten alone oDuld not ot Itelf be a bar to enieong into a consderamon of the question whether this maol.ge between Eish su wa good or nut by the law of Xigland," And in pages 403 and 411, where other expresons of similar import are to bx found; butx the question before the Court was whether fhe contract had been made In a form binding by the law of F'rance, and whether the marriage rites had been duly celebrated according to that law-no question as to any violation of English law being involved In the discussion. The case of "Rndingv. Smith" (2 Hagg. Cons,flep.), was also cited oni account of one or two passages in the judgment of Lord St-owelL, One of them runs ithus- I "It is trueindeed that Englis decisions have ewtabliohed tbls rule, that a foireign marriage valid Aecording~ tthe law of the place where icelebrated In good everywhere wel. t is therefore certainly to be ,advised that the safest course is alwa9 to be married aeoroding to the ilaw of the country, for thtm no question can be xtbned," But here again Lord Stowell was deaing with the marriage ceremnonils, and not with any inquiryr wbether such a masrriage was or was not a violation of thbe law of this country. Buit the celebratod cas of " Dalrymple v. DairyinpleP was mainly pressed upon our consideration on sacont of the passage In which Lord Stowell enunciated the principle on which that and scitr es should be decided. It is in 2Ragg. Cons.

I have therefore come to the conclusion that a marige contracted by the subjects of a. country in which they are domiciled in another ountary ih not to be hldd valid if byv contracigit tho lawsof theirown country ae violated. Another qesion remais to be considered- inr, whether the 2d section of the statute 5th and 6th William 1W cap. 54, taken by itbelf is so framed as to be bidig on nlEngls subjects wherever they may be; or, in other words, whether it Is personal and accompanies the perslon of an Englis subject into foreign lands. It is in ,these words:- "1Be it further siacte that all marriages wbiati shall hereafter he celebrate between pesons witiln. tbe prohibited degres of con=nnty or affintitshall he alnolutely null and vodido all intents PVurpo5i'Whtsoevrsrr The words in their common and ordinary sense would extend to marrisage wherever eleobrated, otherwise some only, and not all, would be rendcreed void. It is a statute affecting persons, and may be readas if had been:- "Ithereaftee any thaIs Bdti subjecs) within"te pM bibtte de exsea~tstm ars ll such mariaes sball be void." A law framed in such terms would attach upon the persons of British sabjects, and acompany them to all pats of the world. Upon this point the decision of the House of Lords in the Suex Poerage case appears to be conclusive. By the 12th George ImL, c.

Of 8t}khtlL "THox rs HA Chatrman of the BLria' BoLrd" The infringement complained of by the plaintiff was the proposed construction by the Burial Board of an entranoe to the cemetery exactly oppodte to a new entranoe which the plaintiff himsolf intended to make to his own park and frounds which abut on the opposite side of the turnpike-road leading from Warwick to Birmingham, and which the plaintif stated would be a material interference with the enjoyment of his property, the result being that persons coming out of his park rwould, in all probability. not unfrequently come into collision or association with a funeral procession. A great mass of evidence was read for the plaintiff and defendants, and numerous plans were produced, with thevie w of showing on the one side that0 although not so expressed in the agreement itself the defendants entered into it on the faith of their being able to construct an en-trance fromn the road in question into the cemeteryat or, at illevents, nearto the spot now proposed, and of showing on the side of the plaintiff that, although he did not object to their entering at another spot higher up, where a gate into the field had existed before the agreement, he had all along objectedSto the position of the entrance now propoeiL The decree asked was for an inijnction to restrain the defendants from mnaldng any entrance to the field or cemetery or erecting any building on any part of the said field which by the memorandum of agreement was to be planted by the deftndants with a belt of tress and shrubs. Mr. Willoock and Mr. Schomberg for the plaintiff; r. Rolt and Mfr. Eddis for the defendants. The VICHCOaLLoR said that, although the bill only sought to restrain an infringement of a negative term of the agreement, the case must, nevertheless, be governed by the principles appicable to cases of specific performance. t was clear on the face of the agreemnent itself and the bill that the onl.y construction it was capable of was that there was to be a belt of trees planted throughout the whole length of tthe tuvrnpike road, and -there wvas no mention ofan woacace s cc arieanywhre. ut eiden enhadhei entranc to be made,anywhere. Rat evidence h dbeea produced of some counter-understanding between the parties, though they differed as to their respective impressions of such understanding. But the fact of such a counterunderstanding existing created an insuperable difficulty in enforcing this agreement against the board. It wauted extraneous circumstances to explain it. Looking to the evidence which had been given of such extraneous circumstances, it was clear that the parties were not ad idem, the defendants having offered at the bar to put the plaintiff into the same position ashe was in before the agreement, the decree of the Court would be as follows :-" The defendants offering to cancel the agreement and to abandon the user of the field in %uestion without the consent of the plaintiff, and the plamitiff submitting to such terms, let the plaintiff and defendants respectivly concur in cancelling such sgreemnent and let an injunction issue restraining defendants from using the field without such consent," No further order would be made, the result being that each side would pay their own costs SPIrRS V.

The machine was found capable of ereciting the finest work, and so far from having diminihbed the demnand for mua labour it had rather increaed It, and a woma attentd in the machine could erlm much lrer wages with considerably les labour. The principal pas of the machine oostited ot agroed needle, having an eye at the point, attached either immediately or through the intervention of a slide to a lever, worked by a cam and rotary crio,which was the govrnnadg motion of the whole machine. Thefabric to be teitched was placed between two plates, in each of which was a small hole to aleow the needle to paes. The needle was suppled with thread frot a bobbin moving on ba he iaWhene the machine was set In motion the needle paÂ¢sed partly through the fabric, buthby the actiont of the came it wasdrawn back, and by this means a loop was formed in the thread, a shuttle then paed another rad through this loop, and when the needle tbretd was drawn tight a stitch was forried.

The mahne was a specmen of the ingenuity now so often r em ployed to produe. the cAme resuts by substantially the same process, although the machine would present a very different appearance to theeye. The defendlant did not use a shuttle to ps a thread through the loop formed by the needle thea, but employed another needle which formed a second loop aLnd when th first threAd was drawn tight a chain stitc was formed. Several witnesses wero then called and examined andl cross-examined at great length as to the action of the different part. of the plaintiff's machine, how it differed from former machines and in what respects it had been imitated by the defendant.

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, Wzsnn&sT, Dzo. X HALL V. TANQUERAY. (Sitings at Ni, Priu* eford l;ord Chief Jtice COCEBm iu:A SDe. JUYWL1 Mr. Serjeant Byles, Mr. ML Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. White were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James, QO., and Mr. Hawkins for the defendant. This was an action for negligence en the part of the defendant's servants, and was in part heard yesterday. It brought by the plantiff, an ingenuous and intelligent looking boy of 14, SUing by his next friend, to recover comr pcaton orthe loesof his left arm, which wasE crushed by a heavly laden wvaggon in charge of the defendant's servants, and completely severed from his body at the time of the accldent. The plaintiff's father is a respectable dairyman, residing at 10, Southampton-street, Fitzroy-square. he defendant is a dlstiller, trding under the name of Tanqueray and Co. On the 7th of August last the father of the plaintiff was driving his son in a chalse cart along Fleet-street eastward. When they had passed Chanoery-lane the defendant's waggon was in front of them, going in the same direction, and bothvehicles were on their proper side. Uon approaching Anderton's Hotel a cab was at the door of the hotel and on theopposite side of theroad, coming westwArd, was a'Putney omnibus. Underthese ircumstances, the description given by the plaintiff's witnesses of the manner In which tho ackden occurred was, that the road being clear at the time, the plaintiffs father, wlo was driving at a moderate pace, Was paing the Wggon, and in doing so had cleared the waggon, when the fore horse of the waggon suddenly turned right across the road in front of the horse in the chaise cart; and tlat, although the plaintiff's father pulled up short and cried out, the wavgon continued to go on in the position descrlbed, caught thenear wheel of thechaisecart, and forced the shafts against the hind part of the omnibus; that both shafts were oroken, and, the plaintiff and his father being thrown into the road on the near side, the poor boy's arm unhappiy fell under the wheel of the waggon, and when he was lifted up the arm was literally hanging by the threads of his jacket. He ws subsequently taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and underwent an operation. Several witnesses, including the father, the driver and conductor of the omnibus, and Mr. Harvey, the fish. monger opposlte Andereon's, and the plaintiff (who was much affected in giving his evidence), stated the facts to be as above, and unanimously stAted that Ro driver appeared to be lookLng after the waggon at the time, and that they could not see any servant of the defendant near it. The defenoe set up to daywasthattheaccident haa resulted from the careleesnes of the plaintiff's father in driving, although it appeared that the persons acting for the defendant before the trial had refused to rocognize his liability, uapon the ground that the collision had occurred through the inslftL driving of Master Robert Hall" (the plaintiff). A porter at the Bolt-in-Tan, a vintner's porter named Hockley, and several other witnesses, supported the theory of the defendant's case, which was utterly irreconcilable with that of the plaintiff. Hookley stated that after the accident he heard the plaintiff's father say, ' Oh, mypoor boy, my poor boy I I have no one to blame The plaintiffls father wffAs recalled, and positively contradicted him, as to the wvaggon being unattended, upon the evidence, one of the defendant's drivers had his hand on the check rein at the time, and another wfas at the tail of the waggon. The LoRD CHrxs JUSTICE, in summing up, most carefuUll cautioned the jury upon every point by which they might be prejudiced one way or the other; bat told them that, if satisfied the accident was the resalt ef negligence, it was a case for a ful measure of damages, as by it the plaintiff had been deprived of a large share of the blessings of life. The jury retired for 20 minutes, and found their verdict for the plaintiff-Damages 600& JON-ES V. ROSS. Mr. Seriesant Byles and Mr. Keane were oonnsel for the plaintiff; Mr. M. Chambers, QC., and Mr. Lush, Q C., for the defendant. This was an action against the proprietors of the M.mtrated Timm.j for a libel, which, having already appeared in the Daily Ncuu, was subsequently copied into the paper of the defendants. The defendants had in the first instance pleaded a justification, bat the pleas had been withdrawn under a judge's order; and the proceedings of to-day were confined to the assesment of damages under a writ of inquiry. It as dmitted by thoplaintU's counselthat an action had already been brought in this court (on the 24th or 25th of June lat)againat the Daffy New, when the-plaintiff recovered hOI. damages; and, as the facts of the case and the nature of the libel then appeared before the public, it is unnecessary for ls Donw to set out the libeL It is sufiacient to state that the plaintiff Is a physician and consulting surgeon, practising in London- that thq libel was headed ":Suspicious Death of an Englishruan in Paris -" and after statinh that the plaintiff had been telegraphed Fr to attend a gentleman of lag fortune in Paris, A M[r. Brettel, who haid met with an accident and was of intemperate habits, went on to state that the Plaintiff proceeded to treat him withouLt communication with a Dr. M'Carthy, who was attending him at the timne, who did not consider him in white powfder, whtich hle tnotokfrom iswaistcoatpocket, and twohours after taking this powder Mr. Brettel died.' The libcel then went on to 5tatethat Mr Brettal had left his property to an Enghish lady then in Paris1 n,o relation of the de- ceased, And that the pLdWtiff was under the strict srvel. lne of the polioe. Mr. Serjeant BYLrs, In opening the paintiff ogse, stated thatthe libel amounted to a written #harge of down- rmbt marder. Ie libel was read to the lury, and the judges order for the ithdrawal of the pless put ial; but no other evidene WAS Offered on either ade. Mr. IL COxgrs addresed the jury at considerable length for the defendants, oontending that, as the 'aintiff bad already recovered agwent the DaiZy Neitu his object in the present action could not be to vindicate him chracter, but to trade upon it and put money In his pocket. Te Inuendo in the declaration, "The murder most foul, as at the bst it is, and as mo foul, crel, and unnatural," ought to have no weight with the jur. It was a groes inuendo.

This was an action of defamation, the plaintiff complain. igthat the female defendant had accused her of being ' ohn Everett's strumpet"wlhereby the said John Everett, though he had revdo.sly been engaged to marry the plantiff, had =eBaso to do. It agreared that the son of the defendants had been In the h t of viiting Mir Fletcher, the sister of the plaintlff, at the house of Mr. Lo gmie. where both the sisters lived. On one occasion, when lr. Everett was present, paying ris addrese as a ffuitor to the plaintiff, Mrsm Hi came to the window, and made an Inquiry after her son's pony. Mr. Longmire gave an answer, to which Mrsil 3replied, "That's a lie." Upon this Mr. Longmire sad," Irh told you the tratb, and that's all I know about the pony ," whereupon 1M Hill replied, " If you don't know anything more, those two strunmpets who live in yoxrhouse do." These words were overheard by Mr. Everett and the sisters, and a regnlar row enaned between firs. Fletcher aud M HilL Ona subsequent oocasion m HUill told Mrs Brown to her face that she was " John Everett's w- I," and after thbs, though the wedding-day had been spoken of by John Everett, that gentleman declined to marry the plaintiff util her character was clsared up. On the croeseaminatlon of the plaintiff Mr. and MIrs. Longmire, and Mr. Everett, it appeared tiiat the " suitors" had been very exceUent friends m spite of the imputation on Mrs. Brown's chacter, and that the whole party, who were straners to London, had come up on Saturday to attend the trial, and had pt up at an hotel in Basinghall-street, and hsA all together visited the "lions" of tondon, in. cluding Astley's and another theatre, name nmknowni, a church, name unknown, andthe "great ship," name also unknown, under the chaperonage of the plaintiff's attorney. Mr. JE5s before addressing the jury objected that there was no evidence of special damae, without which the action could novt be sustained. The COn7a BARON was of a different opinion. There s a general imputation that the plainitiff was a strumpet, as well as the special one thatahe was John Everett's strumpet, and it might well be that Mr. Everett, though he knew 1mrs Brown was an honest woman as far as he was concerned, might feel thst even the specdal imputation would not have been made -without aome general suspicion of immorality. He might then well say, "I must decline to ma3rryyou until your charAeter has been vindicated." Mr. JASz then addressed the jury, contending that the contemplated mariaWe had never been really broken off by Mr. Everett, but only deferred in order to get up this action in the hope of making poor Mr. Hill pay damages and CoEts for his wife's abusive anguage. The words spoken by that lady were not actionable without special damage, and well it was that such was the law, for if actions could be brouht for all the idle abuse showered by one woman on anoter the courts would be taken up for the entire year in such trials. He put It to the jury in oonclusion that the proof of the alleged special damage had entirely failed, and that the defendants were consequently entitled to a verdict The CmFx B,itox left it to the jury to say whether they thought that the action had been ooncocted as had been suggestd, or whether the -arriage had been bon4 .fde interrupted in consequence ot langge of the female defentdant. elnug ftefml e The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 50L dalmages The whole entry having been disposed of today the jury were dismissed from further a endance.
OOURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Ba-singhaUwtrd Dec. 4. _ RE LlEOPOLD I'flPAI'1 (Bcform mr. commisioner GouLEBulL.) AMs fiONOUn gave iudgment at great length on the question of a rightof proof by the GreatNorthern Railway against the bankrupt's estate for 221,0751. It having, however, been stated at the outset that the right ws entirely dependent upon the construction of the pecific Act of Parliament obtaned by the coapany during the last session of Parila ment, and intimation having been further given that there would be an appeal from the decision of this Court, it is sufficient to give the judgment in a very concise form. is Honour held that there we clearly no rlght of proof if not given b the specfic Act referred to. It was stated that the who e of the bankrupt's other debts had been satisied by the company. He could not take judicial noticoe of that statement. Proofs had been allowed to the extent of 6,000M, and which were alleged to have been atisfied by the company; other proofs, however, might be tendered. The bankrupt had been convicted of forgeries and frauds against the comnvy, upon two indicments, to the amount of 1,0004 only, but the proof was tendered for frauds to the amount of 221,000r. Mr. Mowatt the company's eecretary, made affidavit of his behef that the whole of the money had been received by the bankrupt for his use, but that belief vwas not sufficient. The Act of Parliament on which the right of proof mainly relied set forth that the particalar stock and shares alleRed to be forged were so blended that they could not be identified. It alsD contained these vague words-" so far as the said frauds have been ascertained." The clause referred to as giving the company a right to be reimbursed the losses occasioned by the frauds was not, he considered, sufficient to maintan this Xight of proof. The apphication must therefore be dismised. Mr. LAWRN GCE said that If his Honour's law should be upheld the effect would be that the 2,0001. received under thieestatewnould pass to the bankrupt. He vas strongly of His HONOtjo thought it would pass to the Crown. Be hat, however, as it might, the proof could not be ad- LN BE OCrAVE FOA. The bankrupt was a merchant of Broad-street. His HONOUR gave judgmeat on the question of certificate. Having referred in detail to the circumstanoes of the case (already glven in M Tima), he said the debts were 22,5441., and the ssets 1,50,-a sum barely sufficient to pay Is 6d. in the pound It was favourable to the bankrupt that his accountscommenced with a capital of 11,0004, and that he had given his evidence with candour and propriety. The bankrupt bad, hoever, rushed into an act of which he mnnst e ashamed It was nothing less than an act of the greatest fraud. He raieed money from Messrs. Bwechoffhelm and Co. upon a bill of lading. Having ob. taied the money, the cargo afterwards arrived. The bankrupt then went to the wharf a d obtained the goods. This could rot have been effected without false pretences. A bil of lading was so common a docutment that It was almont currency. He couldonly expresshis wonder and surprie, and deep and heartfelt regret, that a man who Up to that time had the confidence of every one who trasted him could have thus acted. It was said on his behalf that he had made the best amends in hi power by repaing Messrs. Bischo1r. helm their money a feaw days before his stoppage, To do this the bankrupt had, however, instead of purging the original offenoe, been guilty of two otherm He gotaquantity of tin on credit; he almo got 1,5004 worthof linseed on credit by paying thereupon a depit.

POLIQL. MA1MNSTIoNoUsP-Mr. Thomas Piper, Jun., and Mrt. John Young, jun., the former a builder an d the latter a surveyor, who had beei summoned for disinterring deal boaies in the Moorfields Catholic barislground, again attended before the LoRD MaYOR, Whenx the lengthy depositions were read by Mr. Oke, the sistant clerk, and signed by the witnesses The case was sent to the essionp. John Palmerston, a repectably dred, but determinecd looking man, was chiarge6d withx being drunk and firing off a pistol on Fish.street.hill. J. Coates, Police-constable No. 548, said,-About a quarter bef ore 2 o'clock this morninlg I was on duty in Eastcheap. I heard the report of fire-arms and immediatelY rim down Fish-street-hill, where I saw the prisoner standing with three or four other persons. I asked him if either he or any of his compaulons had firedl a pistol, arnd he repliedl that a man down a gateway close by had done so. He then began to walk away very quickly, but, suspecting he was the man who had fired, I ran ifter him and asked him if he had a pistol about him. He said he bad not, but that he had everything about him that was necessary. He was the worse for liquor. I took him to the station-house, where he was searched, and a pistol-pouch, five keys, a small box of wax, and two sandbals were found on his person. Chbales Oliver, police-constable 524, said,-I heard the report of fire-arms at a little before 2 o'clock, and ran to Fish-street Hill. I asked the prisoner if he had a pistol abcouthim, and he declared he had not. As my brother officer was taking him to the station he tried to pass the pistol to one of his companions, who walked close behind him. I immeditely seized the pistol, and I now produce it. The LosD MAYoz.-Is the pistol loaded? Witness.-Yes, my lord. It is a revolver with six chambers, five of which are now loaded with powder and bullets. The other chamber presented the appearance when examined at the station-house of having been very recently fired. J. Foulger, assistant Inspector the city police, sald,-I have exaumined the keys found on the prisoner, which have evidently been in the hands of a well practised burglar. They have all been blackened by smoke. When that is dons and they are fitted into locks, the wards which they will not enter wipe the smoke off, and they are then filed down to fit. For years past I have seen the prisoner in the City, the Borough, and the Strand, in the company of the most experienced burglars and daring thieves of the day. I have no doubt Ishall be able to prove hereafter, that he has been convicted at Lambeth Polioe Court. Ie is a man whom every policeman ought to know. !am sure he wl.1 gve your lordship no satisfaction as to how he gets his living. I have no doubt he was out last night for the purpose of committing some burglary. Prisoner.-I was incapable of knowing whatlwas doing, I was so drunk. Was there not another person brought into the station-horse ? Why did you not keep him? The LoRD MAToB.-We are quite satisfied with hasing you for the present. Mr. Foulger.-The small box of. wax produced by the officer Coates is used for taking impressions of keys. Palmerston.-Impressions of keys, eh ? Why it's ip. salve. Any chymist wiU tell you that. The LonD MAYOR.-Are vou troubled with sore lips ? I don't think you are, from their appearance. Palmerston.-Occasionally I am, espeoially during sharp winds. (Laughter.) The LosD MAYOr.-The weather has been remarkably mcild lately for this time of year. Palmerston.-Did I shoot anybody? The LORD MAYOR.-No, but you had the weapon upon you which would have enabled you to do it. I shall remand you. Mr. Hodgson, the superintendent of police, informed the LoRD IMAYoR that Charles Thain, the detective officer, who was shot in the breast by a Bavarian, named Christian Slattler, off Lowestoft, on Last Sunday week, had expired at half.past 1 in the morning at Guy's Hospital. The LORD MA~YOr-I am very sorry that so respectable and active an officer, and a man in the prime of life, should have met with his death at the hands of an assasSin. His lordship requested that the press would acknowledge the receipt of 20s. from " J. M." for MIrs. Brodie. GUmrD]tLu.-Moses Solomons and John MyerS, twO respectable-looking young men, were charged with being found in possession of 2 000 embossed labels, alleged to have been stolen from a trucl belonging to the prosecutor. The prisoners were remanded, bail being accepted for Solomons. Thomes Willams, a wretched-looking youth, about 18 years of age, was brought up by Captain Wright, the Governor of the Holloway iouse of Correction, charged with conspiring, with a prisoner named Green, to procure the liberation of the latter before the expiration of his term of imprisonmentk Captain Wright stated that the prisoner Green had been committed to prison for three months for felony, and that Williams had been sent for 21 days for disorderly conduct in the union. The latter term expired yesterday morning, and upon Williams being called up to be di3harged the prisoner Green, with the connivance of Wiliams, answered the name, and presented himself before the Governor for liberation, when the cheat was detected. Sir P. L&utnu said it appeared meat extraordinary to him that any one should voluntarily remaiu a pri3oner. However, it was clear the prisoner had connived at the atrempted escape of anolher prlsoner, and he therefore remanded him till Monday for further inquiry into the matter. SOUTrrrvARI.-Christian Sattley, a native of Bavaria, who was last week examined before the Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house, was brought before Mr. Combe at the ISouthwark Police-court for further examination, charged with wiifu11y murdering Charles Thain, a citydetective officer, on board tho Caledonia steamvessel, during the voyae from Hamburg to London, while the deccased officer b hm in custody for stealing a bag containing money and shares, the property of ML-. Arthur Ballantine, stockbroker, at St. Ive's, Huntingdonshire. The facts of the case have already appeared. As soon as the prisoner was placed in the dock yester. day Mr. CoSBE informed him of the death of his victim. B!e received the information quite unconcerned, saying, he could not help It. Mr. Ballantine was examined and proved the loss of his carpetbag and contents, he also identified a 51.-note, a breast-pin, and canvass-bag, containing two razors and a case, which he had left safe in the carpetbag. He had no recoUection whatever of the prisoner. Mr. Stephen Prost, the captain of the Caledonia, stated that Charles Thain, the deceased, and the prisoner came on board at Hamburg, on Saturday, the 21st of November. The latter was handcuffed, rud witness allotted them a separate cabin, which could be locked. On Sunday afternoon, shortly after 4 o'clock, Thain came to him in the gabin and told him he had been shot. He was partially undressed, and he saw a hole under the right breast near the nipple. At that time the vessel was 50 miles off Lowestoft. Witness immediately applied the best remedies at hand, and afterwards asked the prisoner how he came to do such a thing, and he replied, " It was not intended for Thain, but for myself." He also said that Thain had come on him unexpectedly, and that he had not sufficient time to oonceal the pistoL Witness ascertained that the prisoner had broken off a lamp bracket, which he used to force open the box whence he took the pistol, ball, and powder. Witness asked him how he could have loaded it with the handouffs on, whenL he replied that he put the pistol in a corner of his berth and poured the powder in. He could not ram it. Witness had him secured, and when the vessel arrived at Sheerness he called a navalsurgeon on board, who exaiined the wounds and directed that Thain should be taken to a hospital as aoon as they arrived in port. Mr. CosnBE asked the prisoner whether he wished to ask the witness any questions. He rep!led, quite unconcerned, " Oh! no; I ask no questions. isuppose it is allright." Mr. COMB11 here inquired whether the prisoner was per. fectly acquainted with the English language. Mr. Goodman said that he was. He was an interpreter of languages The prisoner also said he understood all that was passng, and if the man was dead he could not help it. Se had shot him, and he must suffer for it. Mr. Stutchbury was about to examine the witnesses further relative to the stolen property, when Mr. COMBX said he thought that was unnecessary, as they did not require to investigate more respecting the felony. A question might arise as to whether the prisoner was in lawful custody, and on that failng the felony would drop to the ground; but here he was charged with a more serious offence. It did not matter whether he was legally arrested or not; he had undoubtedly committed wilful murder, and that was now the chief charge against him. Mr. OMBEaske wheher he husesurgeoon of the hospital was in atbtendWahnte,ashisevidence would be reqjuired to prove the cause of death. Mer. Â¢Sttuchbury replied that he was not, but he had his Mr.CoaIBE told him that gentleman must be present, and, tolv the authonritiesl abne opprtPÂ°turnity odf dcompleting the case,the pisosir wold befurthr remnded The prisoner, vho seemed to treat the whole of the procoedings with .the UtmOSt unconcern, was immediately conveyed in ascab to Horsemonger.lane gsoL.

MILITARY AND NAVAL INTILLIaRNOR TheDuke of CAmbridge, attended by Sir eio'hard Airey, XLC.B., and Colonel Chfon, visited S&ndhurst Collega leaterday to attend the examination of the cadets. Lieutenant.GeneralSir Chrles W. Pasley, X.C.B, RE., arrived yesterday at the headquaters of the Royal gugl. neere' etablishment, Chatlham garrison, for the purpose of witnessing ome experiments carried on at the field works of the Royal Sappers and Miners, with the view of testing the relative merits of two new descriptions of gablons, one tke invention of Captain 11. W. Tyler, R.E., and the other that of Sergeant-Major J. Jones, R.E. The experiments were carried oat under the immediate superinten. dence of Colonel R. Sandham, director of the Royal Engineers' establishment; Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. G. Ro5s Major F. C. Hassard, And a large number of officers of th., Royal Engineers, were present. The construction of Captain Tyler's gabion is exceedingly simple, it being composed of only one sheet of galvanized iron, about d5x feet in length and foar in width; the edges of the sheet are wrapped together and fastened with wire, and the gabion is thus completed. Sergeant-Major -Jones'. gabion Is composed of bands of sheet iron about four inches in depth, on woodien pickets, the bands being. fastened with two buttons fitting into ecrresponding-holes. Twenty of each of the new gabions were used in the experiments yes. terday, the whole being put to tho severest tsts. A report of the experiments carried out yesterday at Chatham is to be sent to Generalj Sir John F. Burgoyne, G.C.B., the Inspector-General of Fortifications. A report of the proceedings of the general court-martial which assembled at Chatham garrison, under the presidency of Colonel C. Elmhirst, commanding the 3d battalion, on the 20th of October last and following days, for the trial of Lieutenant George Willitm Vansittart Ynle, of the Royal Engineers, on several charges of negligence of duty, absence from the hails of study, and scandalous conduct unbecoming the charaoter of an officer and a gentleman, vas received at Brompton-barracks yesterday, the finding of the Court havingbeen submitted forthe approval of the Duke of Cam. bridge, and laid before Her Majesty. The officers of the Royal Engineers having been assembled the sentence of the Court was read. The Court found the prisoner 'Guilty.:'bat recommended bim to mercy on the ground of his youth and inexperience. The recommendation of the Court, however; was not acted upon, as it was considered that Lieutenant Yule's offenoe vas of too serious a character, and he is accordiDgly ordered to be dismissed from the servioe. Dns;ug Thursday night and the whole of yesterday un. tiring efforts were nade to raise Her Majesty's steamer Cuckoo, and remove her from the position in which she sunk, near Chatham dockyard, on Tuesday afternoon, but she EiZU remains in nexrly the same position. A large portion of her heavy stores, shot, shell, &c., haa been removed, and yesterday evening the crew were busily engaged in pumping her, in order to enable her to float at the rising of last night's tide, but it is doubtful whether she vill do so. The sentence of a general court martial, held last week at Woolvich, for the trial of Levy Bullock, sergeant of the 28th company of the Royal Marine Light Infantry, on three chazges of fraud and embezzlement, was promulgated on Thursday. The charges were as follows :-L For having fraudulently aisapplied, or caused or suffered to be embezzied, certain sams of money stated in the indictment, vhich were intrasted to his care, agreeably to the practice of the service, for distribution or payment, or to be other. wise accomunted for by him in his capacity of pay-sergeant, and for which duty he was In receipt of a pecuniary allowance from Government In addition to his military pay. 2. For false and fraudulent statements, in order to obtain the signature of Captain Harris, the officer in charge of his company, with a view of entering upon the abstract a sum beyond what vas required for the disbursementslof the company; and thirdly, for having fraudulently made certain irregular stoppages in the men's pay for ledger debts, the effect of which was to leave an umdue surplus of money in his hands. The Court having pronounced the prisoner Guily on the whole of the charges, which being in breach of the articles of war, and taking into considerat1on the absence of former conviction and his general good conduct, sentenced him to be reduced to the rank of private sentinel, and, further, to be kept In penal servitude for four years. The said sentence having bcen approved, Her Majesty, iu consideration of the general good character borne by the prisoner, has been graciously pleased to direct that the termof penal servitude, to which he hs been sentenced, be commutsd to 12 months' imprisonment in one of Her Majesty's gaolsor prisons. Accordingly the pil.boner was on Thursday stripped of his strlpes by the Drummajor, on pubUc parade, In prseence of the entire battalion to which he belongs, and was forthwith conveyed to Fort Clarenoe to undergo his term of imprisonment.

OBBBBERY of the COUNTESS of XLLBSEBRFS JEBWRLS. Edward Jackson, an oil and colourman in Leonard.stree', Shoredithb, and Anne Jackson, his wife, were placed at the bar for final examination, before Mr. D`EyNcouRT, at Wor_ ship-street, onThuraday, charged withbelng in felonious po3sessionof numerous exp3nsive articlesof wearing apparel, the property of the Countes of Ellesmere, and forming part of other property, conesftng of jewelry, &c., to the aggregate TvIUe of 15,001., of Which her Ladyship had been robbed while prooeeding on a visit to Her Majesty at Windsor. A third prisoner, named William Attwell, a man of 26, but of very youthful appearance, was now also charged, upon his own confession, with being one of the actual perpetrators of the robbery, and was brought up in the custody of the Deputy-Governor of Springfield Gaol, Chelmsford, in which he is a prisoner under sentence of a year aud a- half's imprisonment for felony. The facts of this extensive and mysterlous robbery were now clearly developed, and presented, if the men's statements be true, of which there is no reason to doubt, an instance of the most wanton and wholesae destzu. t,onS of valuable property. Saortly after the robbery a reward of 5001. was offered by the Countesrs solicitors, Messrs. Wing and Ducane, of Gray s-inn-square, for :nformation which would lead to the reeovery of tho Etolen property and the conviction of the thief or thieves; and as the contents of her Ladyship's travelHng cae are and have been frequently referred to inthe evidenoe, which is not intelligible without a description of them, it is neoessary to state that, in addition to numerous other articles of orna. mental jewelry, it contained a pearl necklace, a diamond necklace, an emerald and diamond. necklace, a diamond brooch with emerald drop, a diamond bow with emerald drop, a pair of diamond earring, a pair of emerald and diamond earrings, a large pair of diamond branches, a small pair of diamond branches, three diamond buttons, an emerald and diamond order, an emerald and diamond bracelet, a gold bracelet with Pericleaux clasp, a cat'seye bracelet, a gold bracelet with garnet and diamond clasp, besides other bracelets, and that the wearing ap. parel stolen with the jewelry consisted of white and blackBrussels lace, China crape, and other shawls, lace dresses, blond scarfs, velvet cloks, Indian scarfs, moziring and evening sUik dresses of white and various other colours, together with other expensive artidcles of ladiee' attire too numerous to specify. Mr. Humphreys, of the firm of Humphreys, Son, and Mforgan, attended for the prosecution, and Mr. Lewis, jun., for Jaokson and his wife, the latter of whom, as before, surrendered to her bail, and appeared so depressed and debilitated that she was allowed to be seated during the examination. Mfr. Humphreys then stated-It may ba inyour worship's recoUection that at the last examination I mentioned that I should be able to produce before you a person actually concerned in the perpetration of this extensive robbery, and I have now that person here. His name is Attwel, other. wise Welsh, and it was in consequence of a request to that effect made by Attwell, that a detective officer, subsequent to the last hearing, went to Springfield Gaol, and, on there seeing Attwell, he voluntarily made and signed a confession of the whole transaction, which I think you will agree with me is quite sufficient to implicate both himself and the other prisoners, entirely independent of any other evidence whatever. The female prisoner, Mrs. Jackson, too, I think you wil also now believe to have been so intimately coanected with this transaction as to leave you no option but to send her for tril before a jury. The learned gentleman then called Sergeant Williamson, who said,-I am attached to the detective force of the metropolitan police, and from information I received I on Wednesday last went to Springfield Gaol, Essex. Sergeant Evans accompanied me, and we found the prisoner Attwell, otherwise Welsh, in. prison there I told him we were officers, and that having heard through a letter from the governor of the p risen that he wished to see me relative to the loss of Lady Ellesmere's jewels, I had called to see him. He replied that he did wish to see me, and then said, " You had better get some paper, as I have a rather long statement to make." I made no promise or inducement whatever to him to make any statement, but I got paper and ink and wrote down at his dictation. That statement, to which he appended his ignature after I had completed and read it over to him, I now produce, Cross-examined.-I did put some questions to him while he made this statement, but not many. I was aware Jackson and his wife were in custody on this charge, but did not tell AttweUl so till after he had signed his statement, when I did tell him, and he said he knew that already. This was the first time I ever saw Attwell, and I know nothing of his character. The officer then banded in the following extraordinary statement, whichwaa readout Ju court, the prisoner Attwell pasyng particular attention to its cont2nts and acitly affmrmmg their correctness:-" On the 22d of January, 186, I and two men named Whitty and Saint all went from London-bldge to Hungerford-pier with the intention of going to the West-end to commit felony. I an not well-acquainted with the West-end of London, but I think it was near Grosvenor-square that we saw two cabs loaded with luggage and a carriage with two horses behind them. Whitty said 'There go Port St. Peters,' which means trunks. We all commenced running after the cabs, and kept at a distance of 20 yards from each other til the carriages turned up a street with a dead wall on one side. The second cab, which we intended to rob, passed the fist, and by this time they had arrived at a square; the carriage then turned off to the right, and the cabs to the left. On the second cab was a large black portmanteau and a small one by the side of it. I asked Vhitty which one he was 'going on to?' he said the big one. I replied, ' Yon can't et it,' and he replied, 'May I be lagged [transported, but 1 bhave it.' I replied, ' If you do you will 'tumbleI the coachman.' By this time the cabs were in the centre of the square, and then I saw Whitty jump up on the back of the cab, Isy hold of the rail with his left hand, and with his right hand puU the large portmanteau off ; It feU in the road, and was so weighty that it pullecd him off into the road also. The horse in the cab reared up, and I said,' You h-ave tumbled theman.' We lookedup, but all was right, and the cab went on. Whitty said to me, 'Lift it on your shoulder,' but I said I was so exhausted I could not carry it; and by this time Saint came up. Whitty lifted it on to Saint's shoulder, and said to me, 'Go and see, Bill, that eU's right while I see the cheers away,' meaning the cabs. I cut off a ticket or piece of paper attached to the pcrtn. inteau. Whitty had now come back, and said that the cheers were all right, that they were gone. Saint said, 'Lifthold *f it, Joe, it is so-heavy.' Whitty replied, 'It's a fine thing, after I've got It, that Im to swag it,' meaning carry it. lobserved thatl wasso weak in condition that Icouldnot stand under it, to whichWhitty replied, ' Go ahead, then, and see all right.' We then went right aeroesthe square into nn open street, and at the corner I saw a cabrank. Whitty then bad the box, and I said ' Give it to Saint, and Ill go and ' square' the cabman.' I did so, and Saint had the box on the pavement. I asked the cabman what he would take me and my box to Tabernade-square, the other side of FiRsburr-square, for, and he said 'Well, whereois your bo x sad, I My porter is on the other side of the road with it.' He said 3s 6d., drew the cab to where Saint was, and wanted to put the portmanteau outside the cab; I said I wonld have it inside, and it was put there, and I got in. Saint said 'Good night, William,' end I said You wvi be sure to come down on Sunday? and he said Yes, I wilL' The cab then started with me, and Whitty followed behind, running. The cab then passed down Holborn, Old Bailey, Smithfield, Barbican, Finsbury, and into Tabernacle-walk, where I pointed out the street I wanted, gave the cabman some ale at a beershop, and he got the box out of the cab and gave me a lift with it on to my back. Whitty was on the other side of the road, and when I got half-way down the street he overtook me, aftcrz seeing the cab away, and said, 'I thought you were going to drive right bang up to the door.' I replied, ' No, I am not such a chump as thatV' Whitty then went on ahesd, to see al right and no police about, and I walked to Jackon's sbop in Leonard street, and took the portmanteau with me. Jackson's is an oilshop, and when I went in there was a customer there, and Jackson also. I said, 'IMr. Jackson, here is your luggage,' and he came and took it off myn back, and put it under the counter opposite the door. He said, 'Is it post paid ? and I said,' Yes, Sir,' and left the shop. Whitty was at the opposite corner, and I said, ' Don't go In yet, George; there's a customer there.' When the cuseomer came out Whitty and I walked in. Jac'kson bad then the portmanteau in his parloui, under the table. Mrs. Jackson was there also at the time. Jackson pulled the bag out, and said, ' Open it, BIll;' but I said, 'Stop a minute;* no unmanliness, you know; Saint is not here wet.' While I ws saying this I saw the name of the Countess of Ellesmere painted in white letters on the topodyh portmantsau. I said to Jackson, 'Why, .hsld salmost next to the Queen,' and he ase, I By that I nope you've got something good.' We sat down and waited about half an hour til Saint came and said he had taken the buss from Oxfordstreet. Jackson then said to me ' Open it BilL' I bean undoing tho straps, but found it was loc!ked. I said, 'I 've never had such a thing as this before, and don't under. stand it.' I took the poker and tried to force the lock, but Whitty sdd ' You'll not open it like that ; her, stand out of the way, and rll soon open it.' He then pulled out a pocket-knife, and began cutting at the right-hand side of the lock. Jaekon said, ' Don't cut it like that, Joe, you'll cut the things.' Jackson then got a hammer, struck the hasp off the look itflewat once, and theboxopened. Whitty began takingthetntgso o r&,Tdckson Oatd'Theyare verynice things;' these oonsisted of a lady's dresses Whitty next discovered a small box containing a bracelet, and he gave it ' o me. I said ' Joe, this Is gold.' Then he took another one out of the box, and went on further and brought out a box shaped lL-e a half-moon. That contained a coronet for a lady's head. There was a thing in the shape of a butterfly, and I said to Jackson 'Why, these things are sparks,' meaning diamonds. He said they werenot, but I said, 'm sure they are,' and Jackson said ' They get things up so welinow i hat one can hardly tell the difference.' Whitty and Jackson began to laugh at me, andI said 'WelL I'll have no more to do with the-things.' SaInt said 'Irmofthesameopinion as Bill, that they are sparks. Whitty then took out three things like studs (the diamond buttons); they were a kind of stone, but I can't tell whether blue or green, but they weresetin gold. Haalsotookont aboxcontainingaletter, with four sovereigns and 3s. 4d. in it. There were other artices in that box, a Bible, Prayerbook, boots, and lots of petticoats and linen, and gloves marked 'C. E.;' I think aLso somo stockings, slit-wls, and a kind of lace and crape. Mirs. Jackson said she thought the lady must be a kind of fashionable woman. There ware also some loose diamonds wrapped up in a piece of pap-e, aird There waa also a kind of darkc blue or green dress; Vhitty ltold a dark kind of lace shawl to Mrs. Jackson for 2s, ;nd also the butterfly for 2s, [This shawl was spoks ke bdDzrA by one of t0e wit- nesse as Bhaing been worth originally about 501.] I said to Whitty, 'Joe, why what ar you doing? He said, 'The are notwhat you think they are, let the woman have them,. I replied, ' Wel, rll not let ny more go it that prico,' and on that Itfed all the jewelry up in a handker. chief. We told about 5Os. worth of dreses and shawls to J iksoan, and the gloves to Jackson for 3g. He id, 'I don't want any 3nore of those things,' Meaning tho dreses, I don't know what to do with them.' Whitty on that pulled off a large white apron he wore round him, and we tied up as many dresses in it as It would hold, and Whittyr a&ked Mrs Jackson to take care of the rest for him, including a pair of stays, as they would do for bis old woman. I put the jewelry into my ocket, and Jc}kson said, 'What is the gtana o them things? r meaning the jeawelry Whitty sd, '40. Jachson said, 'Come in the moring, and l'lI end for a man and see what they are.' It wasthen about 7 at night While in the parlour I said, 'H ere's a name on the box; what's to be done with that r and Jackson said, 'Oh, I'll soon put the monicker [name] out of that,' and he took a knife and began scraping the name off. Saint then put it on his shoulder, and we all went towards Worship-street, and the box was taken down a kind of narrow pasge, where there are houses and gardens in front, and we left ttle mpty box in a garden. Saint said, ' Lt's go and find Saan Britton,' and a man named California took us to a publibouse in Old-street, but he was not there. We then went to another house ai Xingaland, whereBritton came In about 8 o'clock, and we told hin we had dresses we thought would suit him. We then all went to Jackeon's, where Whitty brought out the apronftl of dresses, and we then went on to a houws in Thoms-street, before go in to which Whitty asked what he was to take for these thing and I sid not less than 161. Whitty came out and said, ' He offers 3. for them.' Saint and I sid we could not take It, and Whitty said he would see if he could get another quid' pound] in addition, but he came oat again and said he would not give any more, and we went in and took it, and Whitty gave me and Sdat a pound each. We then divided the money, parted, and agreed to meet at the house of a man In a oourt at'Spitflelds the next morning. We went there and showed this man the diamonds and the blue drop, and we sold them to hitn for 6s. Saint, Whitty, andI then went to Jackson's, ;and Whitty told me to go in, but not take less than 40. for the jewelry. Jackson said tha man had not come to look at them, but we oould hale 10. off them then, and he gave me 10 sovereign. We went again toJackson' at 2 o'clock andsaw an oldman going In. Jackson said, ' Come in about an hour ; he has Just come in.' We therefore went to a skittle-ground, flayed for an hour, had peppermint and port wine, and then returned to Jackson' leaving the others onutide. Jackson sid, ' I want those loose thinga, they won't be complete without them.' I told him they had been just sold fora dollar, and Jackson gave the 56 togetthem backr I rertrnedtothe man I had aoldthem to,gavehim 6s. forthe things we hadsoldhim,-namely, the loose diimonds and blue drop,-and we took them to Jackson and gave them to him. He then told me to oome gin in an hour, and I did so, and he then gave me 30 sovereigns more, which I went and divided with Saint and Whitty, and we al&went to Petticoat-lane and bought ouraelves csme new clothes for all three. On the 30th of Janu , In consequence of hearing of the large reward, 5001., being offere, I wentwithSalntto Jackson's, and said to him What doyou intend to do? Yoa know what those things arenow?' Jack:onsaud'IhAve been as ignorant as vou.' Isaid ' I'll have some more money, or else rul 'round' on you.' lesadImightdoso, smylifewasinhish nds I then said to Saint ' Come on, Bill,' but Mr Jackson said 'Don't go away like that; would yon be such a vaabond astogoand roandupon us? Isaid 'Well, what wi1l this not make a man do ? Are we to chance oar liberty to get things, and you to reap all the advantage of them ?I 1acsoa said I Well, thien, come into the parlour, and when we got Into the parlour he said 'Now, yot see who had the things, meaning the old man; 'I sold then for 6dl.' Alter a deal of conversation he said, ' Well, what will satisfy you? and we said ' Well give us a 101-note each, and we wil say no more.' He refused to do that, but at last pve us 21. each. Whitty had the stays and a portion of the linen, and they were all given by him to his woman, called Poily Gentleman.-WmLrus ATzwxzi. Nov. 25, 185." Sergeant Evanx who has very cleverly managed the case throughout, was tben called and stated.-Before I saw the prisoner Jackon, at his request, at the House of Detention, I saw him at this court in the waiting-room. He was waiting to go away in the van, and called to me and said, "E vans, can I speak to you t' I told him he migbt if he liked, and be then said, "You are prosecuting an innocent mnan" I rep1ed, "Well, we don't want to do that; all we want are the guilty." He Aid, "WeLL I don't deny that the box was brought to my place, but I could not help their doing that. If yot will go to Crownstreet and San-street, and get me a list of the names of all the shoemakers who lhve shops there, I will point out the one where the wearing apparel was taken to." I replied, " If it h your wisht I do so, but how shall I let you nave it ? and he told me to bring it to him at the House of Detention the next morning. I did get a list of the names, andthe next morning weent to him, and showed hiEithe lis He looked over it, but said " I cau't see the name there. I thought it began with an S." He then said, " I shall make no further statement unless you promise me that no prooeedings shalU be taken against me." I told him I had seen the solicitor, and was not anthorized to promise anything of the kind. He on that said " I know who stole them, and where they now are. I saLw the gold being meltld and the diamonds being sorted out into different caets." I asked what he meant by carats, and he replied, " The different sizes put together." I showed himn the posting bil offering the reward, and he pointed out the emerald drop and diamond bow mentioned in it, and sid I Those were thrown down a watercloset in Spitalfields." I asked him if he could tell me what wateroloset, and he said "No, Ican't, but if youlet me out of here Iill try nd find out." He alo said that "1 the emerald and diamond necklace mentionedc the bill had been sold whole as it was for 3001. to a Jew who lived in a first floor in Blshopgate-street, and that a pair of diamond earrings, likewise named in the bill, were tarown away in a field near WhitechapeL"' He added, " If I am convicted I intend to tell all about it, and I should have done so before if T had been convicted last time." He then aid, " When the box waa brought in on that night I told the men to take it away, for that I would have nothing to do with it, but they said they had carried it far enough, and did not intend te carry it any further. They then took it Into the hack parlour and began to break it open. When it was opened we saw what it contained, and thought theywter theatrical dresses." "The wearing apparel," he said, "was taken away in a blAck bag, and the jewelry was wrapped up in a red handker- Cross-examined.-I know Attwell from having seen his face somewhere, but know nothing more of him. I have known Jackson for five or six years, and that the female Drisoner isliving there an his wife. Charles Froud, the cabman, formerly examined, was then recalled, and said,-The prisoner Attwell is the man I referred to as having been taken in my cab, together with a box, on the day in question. I pointed him out to Inspector Thornton to-day, when brought to this oourt. Cross-examined by AttwelL-I know yon by your general appearanoc. I don't recognize any alteration in you. You had on then a black frock cost, I think. I never b3fore that time saw yon, to my knowledge. AttwelL-I confess to the robbery, Sir, but I had on a brown suit, and wore a cap. William Elllott.-I waa in the servlce of the late Lord Ellesmere on the day of this robbary. I recollect Lady Ellesmere and servants leaving town that day for Windsor. Cabs were brought to the door for the luggage, and the trunk prodnued was placed on one of them by myself asd anotherservant, and a small portmanteau was placed on the same cab. Mary Edlin, another of her Ladyshlp's domestics.-I packed the trunk referred to, and the bill produced, offering the reward, Is in the main correct, as to the number and description of the articles it contained. The depositions in this case were then completed and reald over by MIr. Hurlstone, the chief clerk, and the pri. soners having been called upon for their defenoe, with the usual caution against self-crimination, Atwell sald,-I confess to the facts from the beginning to the ending of them, and as to who were the purchasers. Mr. Lawis.-The other prisoners will reserve their de. fence. The witnesses were then bound over to give evidence against all the prisoners on this charge at the next sessions o the Central Criminal Court, when Sergeant Evans said,-I have another charge now, Sir, to prefer against the prisoner Jackson, which is one of receiving the produce of a burglary oommitted some time ago at Iford, when property to the amount of 501. was stolen, and a quantity of that property, consisting of watches, rings, &c., has been slnce found m Jackson's house.
