The memorial set forth five distinct matters of grievance -first, that the amount of stipend payable to male pupil teachers was insufficient, and the mode of payment inoon. venient, in consequenco of which the supply of suitable candidates as pupil teachers in the metropolis and large towns was rendered inadequate to the demaud. Mr. Smr.soN, in calling attention to this point, said, that 4s. a-week was the present allowance to a boy between 13 and 14 years of age-a snum by no means sufficient to supply him with food. ThR amount paid to lads of that age in other branches of labour was 5., 6s., and in some imtniices Ss.-a-week. What the memorialists therefore proposed was that the stipend to the male pupil teacbers should be in. creased at least 50 per cent., which would add 70,=OOI. to the amount of the grant now made, thereby raising it to 200,0004 -year. It was also suggested that the Ianagers of the schools should be empowered to make advances ohl account of these stipends, the long period which thb pupil teachers had now to wait for their money, sometimies exceeding 15 nnonths being very injurious to them. *The second point urged upon the attention of the right hon. gentleman wa3 that the sums paid to schoolmasters and sehoolmistresses for the special instruction of pupil teachers were not proportionate to the time and labour devoted thereto, The payment was at the Tate of is. a lesson, wheresf a private pupil would pay from 2s. 6d. tol 5sa lesson; the memorialjsts therefore prayed that the amount be increased 50 per cent. The tfiird grievanco stated by the memorialists was that a reglationi had been laid down by the Committoe of Council, which preCluded the payment of all sums dne to the school. masters on leaving their schools, by way of augmentations and gratuities, for a less term than one year. This they eonsidered to be oppressive anud unjust, and they asked that henceforth they should he paid for fractional portions of a year. The fourth grdund of complaint was that the schoolmas. ters were not allowed to employ remuneratively their time out of school hours This they regrded as an undue in. fringement of a right conceded to all other classes of Her MaJesty's subjects, and they prayed that the regulation so interfering vwth that right e reacided. The last point referred to by the rcemoriallsts was as to the distribution of the capitation grant since its extension to all the national schools throughout England and WaleF. At present the managers of the schools were undecided as to the mode in wlich the distribution should be made. The memorialists proposed that the schoolmaster should have half the grant, and that the other half should go towards augmenting the school fund. 3Mr. COW-PER replied to these several points setmti; first observing that it was a great satisfaction to him to meet gentlemenwho were able to stAte Whatwere theopinionsasd feelings entertained on these matters by a certain clas of schoolmasters who had derived their knowledge from experience of the practical working of their own schools. EHe should at all times be very much obliged to any entle. men who would tell him what their views were ant what suggestions they had to make in reference to this important subject. With regard to tEhe pupils sEtipend, that was, no doubt, a very senons matter. If the stipend were raised at all, ho apprehended it must be raised throughout the whole country, though he assumed that the present complaint was one of an exceptional chacter, having reference to the metropolis and other large towns only. NTow, considering that a great proportion of those who were trained as pupil teachers did not afterwards become schoolmasters, if the stipend were to be incressed it might hold out such attractions to young persons to become pupil teachers that the country would be found to be educating young men as schoolmasters who had no serious intention of ever pursuing that profession. The question, therefore, was one which required very serious consideration. With regard to making advances to the pupil teachers, no doubt it appeared hard that the young men should be so long kept out of their money; still, on the other hand, there was the risk that they might not be entitled to the money thus advanced to them when the time of payment arrived. He would consider the point, but he was not prepared to express an opinion upon it at present. As to in. crsng the payment of the schoolmasters, he always understood that when the amOunt was fixed it was at the same time considered that the schoolmasters would gain an important advantage from the assistance rendered to them by the pupil teachers. Theremuneration, therefore, which the schoolmasters received did not consist entirely of the g-tuity, but, in part, of the important aid which was afforded to them by the pupil teachers. This made it dtfiicult toestimiateat what amount the gratuit ought to be fixed. With reference to the other portions of the memorial, the right hon. gentleman observed that no doubt there must be many cases in which the rules laid down by the committee operatedas a hardship upon the schoolmasters andhewouldtake intoconsiderationhowfarit waspossibleto modify those rules, so as to guard against that result. He however, candidly told the deputation that he could not at all acquiesce in their statement, that it was unjust to require the schoolmasters to deioteaU theirzremunerative time to the duties of their schools. On the contrary, when the State gave money to the schoolmasters, through the various channels in which It was given, it had a right to require that in return the whole remunerative time of the masters should be devoted to the schools, That was a rule which did not apply to schoolmasters onily, but to aU persons employed in the public service. If schoolmasters were allowedto enter into other employments, it miht open the door to teriptation and might lead to great abuses. The attentien of the mind might be pre-occupied, and the school not have the whole energLes of the master, and yet it might be difficult for an inspector of schools to detect the defi- ienlcy. Se did not therefore think it would be right for the 3tate to eract les than the whole of their remunerative time; nor did he think that theschoolmasters should be allowed to engage in any other occupation or employment. Mr. SmrSONN begged to observe that if the State would recogn.zo the schoolmasters as servants of the State, and would pay them in proportion to the other servants of the State, they would be perfectl satisfied; but their Lordships of the Committee on Elucation refused to [recoznize the schoolmnasters as servants of the State.° Mr. COWrxn again assured the deputation that all the matters theyhad brought before him should receivo the most attentive and deli be rate consideration, The deputation then writhdrewr.
G.ENBAZ ASHBUBNHA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-My attention has beea directed to two lettors in The Times of the 24th of April respecting General Ashburnham, and, having served under him, I am constrained to appeal to yoursee of justice to allow me to say a few words in defence of an absenrt mau. They both undoubtedly convey an insInuation that General Ashburnham is deficient in courage. One more false and foul than this was never penned. " Phocion's,' assertion that " General A4hburnham is innoeent of any military experience" beyond his services at Sobraon is not correct. He was at Ferozeshuhur. Possibly "Phocion" may know the true reason why tho troops under his command (which were native infantry) did not distingaish themselves on that bloody day; if so, let him come for. ward and declare it, for it will be no shame to General Ashburnham. Neither did he "come home afterthe battleof Sobraon."I mean immediately-as he accompanied the army to Iahore, and, after its breaking up, remained at Ferozepore in command of the 62d Regiment till it was ordered home, about a year afterwards. With reference to the " jotted notes" of "K. L., I submit that the publie cannot judge fairly thereon till General Ashburnham's answer can be heard. I, on my part, venture to conclude that General Ash. bmrnham had received positivo orders, and that he did not choose to adopt the suggestions of an inferior officer, nor -een those of " the Brigadier-General or his second in oommand," in direct opposition to those orders. "Z. L's" information that Sir Hugh Gough was " frantie," and that General Ashburnham's interview with him was an unenviable one, may or may not be eorrect. But it must be observed that Lord Gough himself has never come forward to speak in disparagement of his old Brigadier, nor do I believe him to be the man to blacken the reputation of an absent offieer. I will not take upon myself to assert that General Ashburnham is or is not a consummate General, but I will aert that he is a man who willendeavour faithfullyand bravely to do his duty, and (if it can be done in our servioe) make those under him do theirs also. I know that he was not universally popular in India; he was much too honest and straightforward for that. But while I was under his command I always observed that his greatest enemies were those who skulked their duty. It was wel known that when in command of a division in India, subsequent to the second Punjab campign, General Ashburnham showed xeal, talent, and energy in the performuance of his duty. He raised the stAndard of honourable feeling among the officers under his command so much tbat when he left the discreditable spectacle of officers constantly brought before the petty debts court, once too frequent, had almost cead to exist, and he ever had the welfare of his men at heart. He also evinced a capacity beyond mere military routine, by improving (though constantlybhampered with opposition) that once miserable and filthy station, Ferozepore, and toally changed its aspect, making good roads, planting trees, digging well &aC. Let any officer or good soldier of the 62d Regiment be asked if he was deficlent in courage or ability; they served under him and will know. Some who had the honour to be with him on the morning of the 10th of February, 1846, will, I trst, more fully answer and repel these statements. Meanwhile, enclosing my card for your private information, I beg to subscribe myself, Your most AhA ;-. _- AN OFFICER. Apri WU.

THE CHiNESE DEATES A READ ZX CHINA; TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-All who have any intereat in seing the relatious. between the empire of China and the nations of the We4 placed on a permanently uatisfactory basis have gptreason to thank you for the able support afforded in your eolumzW. to the procoeedings of the British authorities in their preseut; dispute with the provincial Government of Caiton. Some of your contemporaries, representing a small7 Inino. rity of the English press, and, it is to be hoped, of thbs nation also, have employed againsI Admiral Seymour the, high'iown invective and stereotyped phrseology which are invariably forthcoming from a certain clas of politicians. whenever Great Britain has the mrisfortune to be involvedc in contention with a weaker Power, mngled with sbhm,& panegyrio on the polity of the Chinese, and ridiculous cow parisons between their state ofcivilizAtion and our ownv To euterinto an elaborate refutation of theerrorsinto: which the writers referred to have fallen on the subject of the manners and customs of the Middle Kingdom-to showthat " high refinement and ancient civilization" are inoomn patible with barbarous cruelty and depraved sensuality, that the oppressions exercised by the bureaucracy in Chin. exceed in intensity thoso of the worst governed Stae in Europe, that their publio competitive examinaug sre o sham, and that venality ana corruption ride rampant. through the land-would occupy too much4of your vIuab, pace and be irrelovant to the question at issue, which, while involving the abstract right of any one nation toassume a superiority over all others in its relations witiL them, may be narowed in this instance within the limits of: treatyobligations, and tho amount of forbeance for repeateI breaches of them to which the suggestioss of expediency or the dictates of moderation may lay claim. In circumstances like the present, when a state of war ha suddenly suspended a large and valuable trade, the opinions of the mercantile body connected with it are entitled toconsiderable deference, especially when its public symupathies are foundto be at variance with its immediate and individual interests. Regret may be openly expressed at the trivial camsewicwsa stimulated this quarrel, aud opinions may differ as to the details of the measures subsequently adopted, bat the merchants of Canton, as well foreign as British, are almost~ unanimous in their approval of the demands made b2 Admiral Seymour on the Canton Government. Nor is this unanimity remarkable. Since the day whenm the port of Canton was first visited by the foreign traderthe quatter allotted for his residence has been fixed in a. portion of the suburb surrounded by the filth and wretchedness of an easten city, and that one of the most populous, in the world. Within a circumscribed area of 300 or 403yards, resembling nought so much as the grounds of Bethlehem hospital, with the hovels of squalid poverty in his rear, anda foul river, in comparison with which the water of the, Thames at London-bridge is purity iteelf, inL his front, the: unhappy Englishman whose lot has been cast in the soathern capital of the CelestialEmpire has for a series of yers continued to chafe and faume at the indigaities heaped upon the" foreign devil"-an amiable epithet bestowed upon him bythe native, who is reaping with him the reciprocal beneat. of a prosperous trade. Denied acoess to the city, as a being unworthy of trast, the foreigner, if he enter the streets of the suburb, is alwaysassailed with abuse, and not unfrequently pelted with stones; if he venture on a walk into the country he does soat the risk of life and limb, as many sad examples only toofaithfully testify. Yet by treaty it is stipulated that the city gates shall beopen to us, and that a distanc to be traversed withia a 24 hours' journey into the interior is to be allowed for the purpomes of healthful exerciso and rereation. Englishmen need not to be reminded that the regular exerciecof their bodily power is alike called for and requir d- by their vigorous forms and substantial diet. The American, after the businees of the day has been concluded, will solae himself with a fagrant cheroot and a quiet saunter ; the German with his meerschaum and dreams of his fatherland; while tke Southerner will betake himself to the ease of his luxurious siesta; bat your true Briton, in whatever extreme of heat or cold he maybo found, wil seek for hisrecreation in muscular action, in equestrian or manlyI sports. To our countrymen therefore the confinement of a- Canton life is particularly odious, as our friends in Englaud would speedily discover were they compelled to spend five: or slx years of their lives within the precincts of a squar situated among the purliens of ilatoliffe-highway. The systematic evasion of treaty provisions by the Canton authorities is the true head and front of their offending-their insolent bearing towards our own officials theimmedi&to cause of the rapture The merits of the case of' the lorcha Arrow msy afford topics for the ingenious exercise of diplomatic ability, but bear no more relation to the: real quostion at Issue than the fulcrum of a lever t3 it& motive power, or the proverbial last feather to the breaking: of the well-known horse's back. The opening of the Canton gates implies access to the, authorities and the faithful observanco of recognized treaties. Exclusion from the city involves a tacit admissiom of our inferiority, and proves the occasion of periodical disputes, which not only imperil the security of a commner:e rapidly developing itself, ana already one of the mos' importat in the world, but endanger the prosperity of EuglisfL financo and the stability of our Indian revenue. The Imperial High Commiesioner, hitherto sheltering hlmself in his inaooessible Yamfln, treats the "statements" of Her Majesty's Consul and the "communica. tions" of Her Majesty's Plenipotentiary sometimes with insulting silence, at others with evasive diplomacy. Jt1 matters not whether the subject of complaint be a breach of the commercial regulations or personal violenoe indicte& upon a foreigner who may have ventured beyond the linsits, of the factories, the representation will be equally disregardedor evaded, according to the humour of the stubborn Viceroy. How far, Sir, will pretended sympathy for the Chinesecaum "bunkum" orators upon English hustings to insistupon the limits of forbearance being extended? How long: will consideration for Chinese weakness be permitted tointerfere with the asertion of our just rights I Tho blood of our murdered countrymen callsaloud forvengeance from the ground of Hwang-chu-Kee, where tbeatrocious barbarians have erected a triumphal arch in commemoration of their horrid slaughter. The writer of these lines has been hunted for his life like. a mad dog, and on another oocasion 1hua been stripped or his clothes and his companions have been severely woundt& by the entire popUtion of well-known Millage, while endeavouring to find relief from the monotony of Cantn in. the quiet of a country walk. If denials of redress in such cases on the part of tho3mandarins aro not considered sufricient justification for an appeal to arms, the very insignificance of the immediate, subject of dispute-the lorcha Arrow-is in itself anevidenco of the necessity of personal access to the authorities when such trifling matters could be easily arranwed. The atrocious character of the ho6tilities which are being: waged not only against Her Majestys subjects, but agaiatm foreigners in general, the offers of head-money and thbe, system of wholesle poisoning and indiscriminate massacre of private persons, have borne their hideous results in J. long tle of nnhappy victims, and should further evidence be required of the "civilized refinemeut!' of our present foes it can be supplied by authentic witne of the eannibal propensities of the Chinese "braves, "who sm knovn to regale on the herts of their enemies 'Whom tbeyhave dain in battle.

The rate of interest at which speculative transactions have been carried over during the liqui-dation just completed appears to have been between 7 and 8 per cent., a fact which will tend to explain -one of the indirect sources of pressure on the London anoney-market. In the discount-market to-day the demand was 'rather less urgent, notwithstanding the preparations -of the public to meet the heavy liabilities falling due on the 4th. The arrival of the Magdalena, with the expected iotal of 460,0001. in silver and 60,0001. in gold, will *csflectually allay anxiety as to the provision for the remittance to India and China by the next fort.mightly mail. The satisfactory intelligence has like-wise been received that the Parana, which may be looked for about the 1st of June, will probably bring from e Mexico a larger amount than that upon the present occasion. Tlhe fresh amounts of gold reported by the -Australian mail steamer to be on their way to this -country make a total of 512,0001., in addition to the -355,0001. previously known to have been shipped. Tne aggregate is, thereforo, 867,0001. Of this the proportion due or overdue is 427,0001., and the *remainder may be expected at intervals during the next three or four weeks. Neither the 200,0001. ,brought by the Anglesey, but not yet delivered in London, nor the 50,0001. brought by the present nnail which wil arrive in two or three days by the Cambria from Marseilles, are included in these (Sigures. The precise amount of the shipments of specie by -the Peninsular and Oriental steamer on the 4th is -Z51,1511., of which 337,2711. is silver for Bombay, iIadras, Calcutta, Penang, aud Singapore, and 211,4201. for Hongkong and Shanghai. The only -parcel of gold is 2,4601. for Ceylon. The inteligence from the city of Mexico by the :Magdalena is to the 2d of April, being about a fortnight later than that last received vida the United States. Until just before the closing of the mail no advices had arrived of the rejection by the American Cabinet of the treaty negotiated by their Minister, ar. Forsyth, granting a loan of 3,000,0001. in return for exclusive commercial privileges. The xeceipt of the amount appears still to have been fully anticipated by the Mexican Government, and it is evident that intense disappointment and confusion would ensue from the -tidings that Mr. Forsyth has been recalled and the treaty disavowed. Under the circumstances, some Further measures with regard to the church property would probably be adopted as the only resource, the -Government trusting to the interposition of the United States in case they should thus provoke a new revolution, to which Spain, acting under imPulses from Rome, and ready with an armament at lOuba, might be disposed to give encouragement. Annexed are extracts of a mercantile letter written before the announcement of the decision at Washington had become known. The fact that a belief could be entertained of any responsible Governanent ratifying in the present state of the commerce -of the world a treaty like that concocted by Mr. Forayth seems extraordinary:- to If I am not mistaken, the course ef events in this -country is likely to assume a very serious aspect, and to in-volve questions of great magnitude with regard both to the destinies ;f Mexico and to its mercantile relations with Europe. Indeed, I cannot refrain from urging upon gyour most seilous consideration once more the importance of attending to the prospects of British interest in this part of the world. The treaty lately signed by the American Minister, Nis. Forsyth, is generaUy considered as a masterpiece of s lfish diplomacy, and calculated to throw aU European in.fuence here into the background for ever, at the same time that it places the import trade upon a footing of such supe. riority towards the United States that aU competition wiU in future be out of the question if the treaty is ratified, vhich, indeed, is said to have already taken place with some slight modifications, the nature of which is not yet known as the bearer of the despatches will only arrive here to-morrow night. By stipulating that 20 per cent. of the import duties shall be deducted on all cargoes brought upon American bottoms, in order to pay up a certain loan which is considered as an anticipation of that portion of duties, the Americans will naturally enjoy a real monopoly of the catryin- trade ; and their manufactures may be brought for sale to tnis market for 20 per cent. less than those of other countries. Such provisions of the Forsyth Treaty show at once a very keen sense of their national interest on the part of the Americans, and have naturally produced great discontent among aU other foreign merchants. "For the present the country is very quiet; but vague rumours are abroad of some fresh pronunciamento on the 3iorthern frontier, headed by Vidaurri. At all events, the Government has plenty of difficulties to cope with. The new constitution framed by the late Congress was at last published on the 11th of March, and, as some of its articles are in direct opposition to the tenets established by the -Council of Trent, the archbishop preached a sermon, in which he explained to the faithful that it was not lawfal to takethe oath on this oceasion,at the same time thathetook proper measures to induce the olergy throughout the Re. public to set in a similar manner. The consequence was that a multitude of civil officers have given up their places rather than have to swear, &c., and the result of aU this is an open rupture between Churih and State. " As usual, all manner of payments are suspended, and the Government is now suffenng for its past extravagance. It is whispered that some new plan io in contemplation ifor the final seizure of the church property, and the chances are that if the Government does not receive prompt assistance from the United States it will fall back upon that last resource. All the wealth accumulated by the church wiU then disappear, And the Government itself will probably derive but little benefit from that quarter. " However threatening the warlike preparations made in Spain may appear, the Mexican Government seems to feel very easy on that score, for it labours under the conviction 1hat the new Minister sent to Madrid (Mr. Lafragua) is sure -teo sig about a peaceful arrangement of aU the difficulties between the two Governments. But the prevailina cpinion with regard to the Barron affair is that it may lead to some serious difference with Great Britain, because the :Mexican Government is determined to make no further 'concessions, having given way already as far as they considered consistent vith their diginity. The arbitrators appointed to decide on the amount of indemnity to be given to llr. Barren have awarded hin $150,000. There is no great variation in the price of quicksilver, 'which ranges from $64 to $65 per quintaL Exchange on London, 46.id. per dollar." The following is from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders "The committee have advices from Mr. Whitehead, -dated Mexico, the 2d ult. The notification of the decree of tho 23d of January had not reached all the Custom-houses yet, having been transmitted through the Board of Public 'Credit, which had caused delay - but in Mazatlan the agents of the bondholders had received in p auruance o a itts ro i seons $7,098 in cash, and $926.77 in bills. The amount -of encumbrances created by the Government on the in¢oming duties had not yet been asecertained. The new con-stitution had been publisbed. Omitting to enact the supre-onacy of the Catholio religion,-incapacitatiug corporate ,bedies, consequently the clergy, from holding real property, -and subjecting the clergy to the ordinary tribanals, while -dieclining to makse these latter instrumental in enforcing the o>bservance of monastic vovs,-the archbishop set the axample of denouncing it from the pulpit, which has been generally followed, and has induced many of the civil servents to refuse to take the oath to it. These have been promptly dismissed, which seems to have created a certain degree of dissatisfaction and uneasiness in the public mind. MPhe news of the rejection of the treaty with the United :States had caused great and general consternation, as the late civil broils had co completely exhausted the pecuniary sneans of the Government. The only remittance by this packet for the dividend fund is $4,598.18 from Mr. Whitehead." The subjoined is from Colonel Facio, the Mexicman financial agent - "Mexican Debt.-By the steamer Magdalena, jut arrived, $4,598.18 have been received from Vera Cruz, and "Q10,542 have arived at the same time at Liverpcoo from 31azatlsn by the merchant ship Androklos. Besides the cabovementioned small remittances, 61,791l.12s. lOd. are iready deposited in the Bank of Engvland." The railway meetings of the week have not been iumerous. The shareholders of the Peebles Company have conllirmed the dividend at the rate of 3 3per Cent, per annuzn ancd the report b4 b t adopted. The u 3Y adoped.Thetraffc continues to shor a steady increase, but the expenditure has not been diminiehed. At the meeting of the Great Indian Peninaula Railway it was stated that the progress of the works has been satisfactory, and that the care taken with the 8urveys will insure the sclection of the best route. According to the report of the Inverness and Nairn Railwray the balance of revenue will allow of a dividend at the rate of 1 per cent., but the directors have considered it prudent to carry the amoumt forward. A portion of the Inverness and Aberdeen Junetion line beyond Nairn will be opened for traffic in the course of the autumn. The report of the East Indian lailway Company has been agreed to. The revenue from traffic and the position of the works in the Upper Provinces show encouraging progress, but some delay has occurred in constructing the Southern division. The existing rate of traffic will, if supported, produce considerablymore than the amount of guaranteed interest. The directors of the Demerara Railway state that they are endeavouring to maintain the present revenue, but that the resignation of the manager has again pro. duced disorganization. The only recourse is believed to be either to lease the line or to appoint 5 successor ho will energetically attend to the iinterests of the undertaking. A committee has been nominated to investigate the affairs of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway, ineluding the award of Sir William Cubitt on the contract. The annexed information relative to the progreas of English mining adventure is condensed from the Mining Jowtrnal " In consequence of a few discoveries made during the latter part of last week the market opened briskly on Mon. day, with a good demand for shares, and prices were well supported; but later in the -week, owing to various causes, some of the heavier descriptions bave again become flat.

The following is from the United Mexican Assoeiation, " Extracts of Despatches from thb Commissioners, dated Guanaxuato, the 14th and 28th of March, 1857.-March 14, Major Farrell writes :-' Jesus Maria y Jose. -The produce of this mine from the 27th of February, the date of my last communication, to the present has been 1,800 carga of picked ore, varying in ley from 6 mes. to 12 mos. per mouton, and averaging about 8 mes. The workings have renumed their favourable apDearances, as I mentioned in my letter of the 27th ult., aid have continued with every indication of the best results. The pozo of Dolores making to the south is yielding abundantly; tho ley of the ore improving; last1 assays, 11 mcs. 50 cts., 13 mcs. 10 cts., 16 mcs. 80 ets. per monton. Thepeozo and frente of San Maximo are also yielding very well ;assays of the ore last extracted show leys as follows, viz.:-9 mos. 20 cts., 9 mes. 38 ots., and 11. mes. per monton. It is not easy to give the precise value of the ore before it is ground und has gone through the process of beneficio; but to meet the wishes of the Board I will give the approxiniate value to the best of my judgment and belief; and, although the 1,800 cargas herein referred to as the produce of the last three weeks have not reached the leys above-mentioned, which are the most recent, still I do not value the ore (1,800 cargas) at less than $6,300. The memorias (expenses) of the mine have unavoidably reached $2,000 per week, the purehase of powder and other materials having contributed; so that it would follow from these premises that the profit of the mine has been $3,000 for the three weeks. Theprofit upon the beneficio at the hacienda for three weeks, being on 1,080 cargas, may be taken at $1,000; therefore, if the whole had been beneficiated by us a further profit would have accrued to the amoumt of about $800, and by the same calculation it is evident that upon the 132 cargas beneficiated weekly at the hacienda of M. Furber we lose $130 (by sale at the mine upon this ore of infernor ley we should lose more) per week, Since my last report there has not been a sobrantes (superfluity) of ,ore (it is ighly desirable to have a stock in hand) to selo, but on Wednesday next we shall have a sale at the mine, the result of which I will advise you of in my next. With the loss accruing from our want of hacienda power staring me in the face, I am (under all circumstances) sorely puzzled as to the expediency of resuming possession of Doran. "'March 28-The only freshwork isa cross-cut from the level of Dolores, 15 varas above the pozo of that name, and midway between that and the pozo of San Rilario- 'it is called the crucero (cross-cut) of San Hilario; its object is not only to test the vein in that point, but at its termination of about 20 varas thence to descend in a pozo to the south, in order to intercept the works of Villarino, now approaching our territory. The names of the works now yielding ore are asfollows-viz., to the north:-San Maximo, 2 frentes and pozo of Purisima; San Pantaleon, 2 frentes, north and south; 1 pozo of San Pantaleon; to the south, Dolores, 2 frentes, north and south; 2 pozos; in all nine labores (workings); from them the extraction during the last 14 days (of which two were holydays) has been 1,300 cargas, that may be valued at $6,500; the memorias for that period amount to $4,561; the profit will be evident, and for the amount of memorias I see no preserf. possibility of reducing them consistent with the proper exploration of the mine and the numbers of works carried on. The sale of ore on the 17th consisted of 670 cargas-a week's extraction-and realized $3,210. We shall sell again on Wednesday next, and the amount will probably be greater - in the meantime our hacienda of Dolores Is fully supplied and in constant work. " ' Racienda of Dolores-Is in full operation, grinding 360 cargas a-week, to achieve which the mill is at work three nights in the week as well as every day (with the exception of Sunday), from 4 a.m. until 8 p.m. The usual grinding, when extra work is not resorted to, is 310 cargas weekly, Quicksilver.-The price is $56, casb, and $58 per quintal for credit.

THE CROPs ix THE NORTH Op ScoTAD.-Some anxiety having been felt regarding the cold and wet weather which has prevailed of late in the north of Scotland, as being Likely to damage the seed sown and keep back the young wheat) we have bad a careful inquiry instituted, and the folowing facts are the result of personal examination. In the Lothians the autumn-sown wheat is very late, but the colour is good, and the plant everywbere is in a healthy state. Much lesa wheat has been sown this season than was sown in l855 and 1856, not only in the Lothians, but more particularly in the northern districts, where the very hirh prces of late years only made the crop remunerative. In Fifeshire the seed is all in the ground in good condition, and the young braird is looling up welL In the central districts the land is in a much better condition than could well have been expected; but drainage being now everywhere common, the soil does not suffer from wet, as it used to do. Potato planting is nearly over, and a large breadth of land is under this crop. Oats are largely sown; but barley shows the greatest increase in breadth of crop this year. From Stirling to Aberdeen this is the general chacter of the farmin and the crops. In Aberdeenahire an increased breadth of oats has beez sown; but the acreage of green crops for the feeding of cattle is much larger than that of any other crop; the cold and wet weather here has kept back farming operations; but though late. the young plants are all lookin well. In the higher districts of Bauffshire the land is stiicold and bleak, and in the higher ranges of Aberdeenshire the mountains are yet covered with snowv. In Morayshire, where the climate is mild and the soil very open, the wheat crop is in a forward state and everywhere looking well. In the districts to the north of this the sring operations are in advance of the central districts, and a great quantity of new land this year comes under the plough. In the north of Scotland generally it may be said that th, productive acreage will be increased this year about 25 per cent., while rents continue to rise. FATAL Bomir ExLoSIoN.-A-terr;fcuboiler explosion, which was attended by the loss of three lives and Eevere injuries to others, besides damage to property, amounting to nearly 4001., took plce on Friday at North Wheal Vor Mline, in the pansh of Breage, Cornwall. It appears that five men, named William GrenfeU (engine man), William Henry Williams, Samuel Reynolds, Johna Pope, and William Yates (miners), were in the enginehouse between four and five o'clock in the morning, when, it is feared through the carelessness of the engine-man in not attending to the feeding of the boiler, a terrific exploSIon took place. Jobn Pope was killed on the spot, having beenx blown from the boiler-house to a distance of 76 yards. Yates and Grenfell were so severely scalded that they soon afterwards died, and the other men sustained serious injmn ries by having been more or less scalded. The end of the boiler in which the tubes were was blown ouat and, the boiler-house thrown down. CRYsT PAMACE.-HALF-CltOWw DAY, Saturday, May missions on payment 85, ditto by seasoa

BIRMINGHAM, MAY 2. The iron trade continues steady, and, according to the representations of the prinoipal ironmaters, promies Im. provement. The stringency of the money-market operates Injuriously among the needy makers, but the prncipal houses of the district are ful of orders at last quarter:day quotations. The fall in the price of copper, which was announoed on Tuesday, does not much affect the leading brasafounders. Uany of them made no alteration when it idvanced ld. per lb. in November lasI~ and only reduced their discounts 2A Per cent, upon the nse of 1d. in January. With few exceptions, therefore, the founders do not contemplate an ncrease of discount at present, the general impression bemg that a further decline will shortly take plae. The faotors who are hat uain with the country demand for Birmingham manufactures, ahile they speaic encoursgmngy of the future, represent trade as somewhat inactivo. This is attrbtdm ra eret h instability of the price of mets and theeluctance toper. ch ase, in the expeotation of further reductions. The orders ent home by commercal men are generaly limited to article Of immediate ncsiy n hc uta l seasons be kept in stock bcountry sand iron. mongeBr m are biilyemiployedln the execution of foreign orders. For edged tools and implements reqaired by the South American and West India planters there is a considerable call, althoughthe season at which this trade is usually the most active has yet scoarcely set in. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ asye ca l In t'he trae of the manufacturing distric there has been litte alteraton. The foundries, generally, are moderately well employed, but no peculiar activity is observable. Theo caIe of the London Works at Smethlwick, whichl, it is stated, wl shortly ta-ke place, is looked forward to with -some In terest. The present state of monetary affairs renders Perelmptory sale by competition extremely undesirable to the great body of creditors, and it is hoped that the holdera Of securities wlll not be compelled to adopt a course which could not do otherwise than considerably Jteprecist the property. The contracts on hand are well nigh completed, and the immense establishment must of necessity, unless se fortunate argements are made, be very shortly closed. NORWICH, MAY 2. The manufacturers are about commencing the execution of orders for the autuum. The statements made respecting the state of trade are on the whole favourable, although busine9s is not so active as it wAS fewr weeks since. The tightuss of the money-markcet has of course a tendency,to contractvoperaetions.Thecrondition of the shoo trade is still LEEDS, MAy 2. The woollen cloth trade of this district shows little alterationi either in its condition or prset.Drigtewe fhebus.nessin=brandcheshas beenpxt quiet5 and the reddction in the price of the raw material at the opening of the London wool sales has not had the effect of creating any briskness. At the cloth-halls this morning there was a good attendance, and some moderate purchases were made in double-milled cloths, suitble for the autumn trade, and in cloakings, twreeds, and other spring goods. There was more anmation than for twro or three market-days pAst, but tansacions were, nevertheles notona largescale I w;ool, both E:ngls and foreign, little has been ddons, mann- itng to see the anal result of the London sales. Trade here has continued flat. The transactons both in yarns and piece goocds hve been limited; and in wool extremely little has been done.I B.A.DFORD, MA-r 2.' A dall state of trade is app ,rent in the worsted district. Business in combing descrptions of wool is inanimate, spinners act with great caution, and transactions are on a limited scale; prices awe reported as nominally the same as those current last week, but in some instances, where sales Stoecks nthehansdsof staZpleErlsgare lihit. The operations in foreign wools are not extensive. NWoils and brokes are without alteration; a quiet demand, with limited suiplies. Yarns experience a dull inquiry, and neither for home use nor shipping purposes are many or extensive contracts entered into. The spinners, howvever, stop a considerable Mroportion of their frames until prices can be better regulated with certainty, and thus prevent the accumulation of their t ocks, vhich are inconsiderable, at the present cost 9f production. In cotton yars business is also flat, with, In some cases, an easier tendency in quotations, The piece trade does not manifest much improvement. Mos decriptions of goods experience an exceedingly quiet demand, and prices are not more satisfactory to manufacturers. In low goods fair transactions are reported. The spring trade, however, will be much belowr the average.

THB NA?IJR& TO TE EDITOR Op THE TInES. Sir,-I observe that Lieutent General Sir Wiiam 1Xapier has pablished in yoar papet of yesterday his reply to mny cornunication to him oi the 28ut nIt. Its purport is that in consequence of my "sonnexion with the Bom. bay 3,inute of Council, concocted about the transit duties in Scinde, and my own special minute as to the alleged delinquency of Meer Ali Morad" he trets my denials of his unfounded aspersions "ast aidlawind," With a person who this ignores the ruler of civilized societY I can, of course, hold no further communication. A cott of lawr is the only arena in which I can, if so disposed and advised, contend with one.ho is thus regardless of what is due from one gentleman to another. But it may not be known to thegenerality of your readers that the minuto referred to- wil bd foand, a pe 353 df the, papers relating to the ce of Meor Ali Morad, printed by orderofParliament asfar backas18V It isdatedthe, 14th of December, 1850, and wasnevernotioedtomykrowledge by Sir Charles apier, ee by the anther of his-Life, except at page 347,voL 4d whers, in chsrate3+`o language, it is desoibed 1' frew the beginning to *ad 0oe'long. laboured, and flagitious lie againstsir.C Nxaxier." Under these cizcumstanee thfe!or% I hope I ]may b permitted to cite the opini Pzornoedpt time -n thi& document by one of the mst eminent and distinguished statesmen of thepresentaep. In a minute, dated thu 27th of February, 1852 (PJzliasnUna pspers, pge 341), the lXarqiuis of Dalbousie, the late Governor.Ceneral of India, thus expressed himself - Par. 5. " The evidence hasbeen so cerly and accurately summed up in the report of the comnsson, and the ;whole subject in l its bearings and in every branch of it has been so minutely and elaborately discussed by the Hon. -Ar. Wrouglby, that I should only waste the time of others if I were again to review it in detaiL. " It is enough that I expres my fU assent to the view which as been taken of the evidence both by the conumisnion and by the hon. getitleman. Par. "iE In urging th claimn of the. Ameers Mr. Willoughby enters at great length into the circumstanoes connected with the eommencement of the war in Soinde im 3842, witlx tke cession of the Turban by Meer Roostum to )eer Al Morad, and with the subsequent annxtion oE Scinde to the British empire in India. " his discussion of this subject is marked byaUi iat receareli, extensive knowledge of pnb!ic afihirs, and dis. tinguisbed abDiit which are the characterisics of every ini. tortan,t document that issnes from Mr. Willoughbys I wfill only add my thanks for the opportinity you hAve& afforded me of vindicating myelf in your oolumns, *ad an, Sir, Your obedient huunble swrmVnt J3. .

LONDON, MONDAY, MAY 4, 1857. When the season is over your true earnest sportsman has little else to do but to fight his battles over again. Squire meets squire-squire agricultural, squire commercial, squire official, squire legal, squire clerical, for there are squires of all sorts,-and, when the ladies have left theroom, by the warmth of an April fire they talk over their covers, their preserves, their stables, their kennels, their armouries, and all the sweet auxiliaries and furniture of sport. On these occasons bosoms are unlocked, and the observations and meditations of half a year reveal themselves. The favourite hunter's forelegs and his rider's weight are candidly considered; " You won't ride " that brown mare another season ;" such a pointer is getting idle, and such a greyhound cunning; such a gun kicks, or hangs fire, or is too heavy, or won't carry far enough for this country, where the birds are very wild. "w What shot do you use " for grouse I" What do you find the best "wadding ?" "What do you give your "keepers V" " Do you ever give your hunters "carrots "' Then come in shooting jackets, and boots, and pouches of all sorts for all purposes. Then the best breakfast to hunt upon or to walk 20 miles upon, or to set one's self up with wben rather "done up." The subject has endless ramifications, and in an age of improvement, with such a succession of new minds brought to bear upon it, is on every point inexhaustible. The curate Bits by,. munching the brandy cherries, or yielding his inner soul to the contemplation of a gay new alfralotb, a rare encaustic tile, or a quaint "poppy head." For hours and hours, evening after evening, this is country life in England ; and for this the merchaut pines to leave his counting-house, the lawyer his desk, the official his post, and every man his work, whatever it may be. There is a good deal to be said for it, and not much against it. At all events, it is a common object, a pursuit, a war, against a common foe, not one of ourselves. It is not everybody who cares for the subject; but the question concerns those who do care for it, not those who do not. Perhaps they prefer human game; the pursuit is more interesting perhaps, but not so harmless or sociable. It certainly is a matter for congratulation that when the brother NriRoDs are discussing these grave affairs the intended prey are silly brutes or worthless vermin. The guns are not to be pointed at our neighbours' windows; the sbot is not for their boaies. The rival sportsmen are fellows-portsmen also, and the competition is not suicidal. The great sportsmren of Europe have had a glorious season, a regular battue in the Crimea, capital duck-shooting in the Black Sea, and some rather mild sport in the Baltic. The return of gamne is considerable, and the improvements in guns, shot, and all the personal as well as the material accessories of the amusement immense. We have finished for the present; indeed, the preserves are almost bare, and horses, dogs, and all, fairly done up. So now is the time for that aftersport we have attempted to describe. The Grand Duke CoEaTKsNTiNE is come to visit his sporting neighbours, NAPoLEoiN and VICTomA. He seens to be making rather a long stay with the former, the latter not being quite ready for him just now. They are doing their very best to amuse him across the Channel, and have carefuUy hunted up the precedents of PETER THE GBEAT'S visit to Paris immediately after the accession of the House of HAixovnEt to this throne, and of PAuL'S a few years before the French Revolution. The Grand Chamberlain, the 31asters of the Ceremonies, Admirals, Field-)Mrarshals, Prefects, authorities, and constituted bodies of all kinds, are doing their best to show off France-her splendour, her power, her gaiety, and her politeness. Public entries, receptions, balls, operas, reviews, hunts, and everything that Princes are supposed to delight in, are prepared with a zeal that to France is so usual and characteristic as to require no explanation and admit of no comment. But the GRxsND DuxE is a man of business-" a keen sportsman," and " busi"ness before pleasure ifyouplease." His soul is in the Arsenals and the Dockyards. Your real sporting neighbour has never done with your horses, your dogs, and your guns, and the GuAi,D DuxE returned again and againto the-foundries aiid workshops. On a second visit to the Dockyard of Toulon, after examining the new gunboats and a model frigate, he broke out, " I am impa"tient to- have done with these official receptions, "in order that we may more carefully examine "together your ships and your Dockyards." The floating batteries he examined with intense curiosity. To the conductors he imparted his confidential opinion that they would be a failure against any heavier ordnanee or a closer fire than that at Kinburn; and, hearing that some under equipment were intUnded for China, he pleasantly observed, " So you are going to take the "chestnluts out of the fire there too." But nothing came amiss to his useful and vigilant curiosity. \Vater-tauks, sail-stores, oil-stores, small armouries, ironl aud copper works,-everything that contributes to perfection in the sport,he wvent through and inspected, with a yard measure in hand. As he always reduced-the French measures to oturs, it is evident that the British Navy has been the earliest and the mest favoureW object of bis offizial studies. The Gitwn Duxz is quite a model for touristg. -<spj is' tuiring travel to account. Ws1 JU g*d. father, his father, and his uncles ca&ne-to tis country they also brought with them euginee and aavaus, andatook home all sort of peaoed Jinventions. But the GRAD- Dflux as we have jsaii s a man of butines, and he retr to the exaple of the founder of his empire, who -wiel4ed not only a yard measure, but an adze, in our do¢kyards. As a nation of keen sportsmen,-of people who must have an object, and who adapt the'maeas to the end, we cannot but respect the GxaxD Dux2s vay of seeing ".foreign parts." We cannot help sypathizing with him in his pursuits; nor, it appears, can the French. He hbs wou bis way to their hearts. Indeed, it is quite delightful to see the flags of all nation* blnded, national airs alternated, captured cannon,- balls, and other trophies magnaninously hidden, to be uncovered, and all sorts of recollections of pertain recent occurrenoes fondly brought up; while Russia, France, and England, oon to be added to the group, sne eamnining one another's weapons with scientific and affectionate interest, and interchanging hints,-or "wrinkles," as sportsmen now call them, for future use. Is not this the lion and the ox, the wolf and the lamb, lying down together? But an oddc thought strikes one. Where is the game for this sport ? What's the " countny," brother sportsmen, that you seem so busily and amicably polishing your weapons and taldng sweet counsel for'? For 'the noblest- possible prey-for one of, themselves. Two are to chase, hunt down, shoot, snare, or destroy the third; and'which the sportsmen, which the game, time alQne can show. This con3ideration imparts a particular inrast to the GainD Duim's approaching vit to this country. When & brother sportsman- examines your fowlingpieces, your dogs, or your fishing tackle, you may or may not feel anxious to hear that he has bagged more birds or landed mote fish than you have. In this case the object is to bag you, and, of course, you are interested. You are the vermin, and your guest has a fancy for your meat, your fur, or merely your brush to present to his lady, or sweep the dust from his ancestral hall. So he wishes to study your ways, your haunts, your track, where you burrow, - when you corue out to feed, how you run, how you double, how you defend yourself if you can, the thickness of your fur or your feathers, and 'what shot will do for you. Small shot, 18pounders, for example, will glance ofi your feathers, and the GAsD Dun fuinds he must have heavier metal to do the work. But, like all sportsmen, he is quite fair, and teaches while he learns. He lets us know the thickness of his own fur, and the weight of metal he can stand with impunity.. Nevertheless, this is no visit of ceremony or pleasure, aud the High Admiral of the Russian Fleet, the sternest of the Russian Princes, is no mere " fine, frank-hearted sailor," but a man who goes about with a yard ,wand, and makes three vits to a gunboat or dockyard. " A chiel's amang you takin' notes," and if he does not publish them, which will not answer his purpose, he will put them to a better use. However, as far as we are concemed, the Grand Duke CovsTANSTrs is most heartily welcome to see everything that is to be seen in this country. He will not see so splendid a capital as our neighbours have to show; he will not have such faes in his honour, and possibly not be assisted with quite so much alacrity in his naval measurements; but there is not an invention of peace that England will not be proud to show him. That, in fact, is our great art of war. If the GRAND DuIJ wants to know how it is that we carried on the war with so much vigour and success, leaving off stronger than we began, he wilI see that our- military and naval resources'lie rather in the prosperity of thd people -in their perfect freedom, and their umfettered enterprise-than in any aggressive or defensive organization. He will see that we are reallv a military Power because we seek peace rather than war, while the weakness of his countryhas lain in its aggressive spirit and expressly military organization. We are amused with the GnAND DuKes visit to the Doekyards and the Court of France. Of course, we are aware that Russia would rather have France for an ally than a toe, and that on the most common grounds of policy France will do her best " to " be civil" to her Imperial visitor. Indeed, we take it all as a matter of course. We feel, how-ever, that what we have to show Russia is neither naval estabIishments nor Royal magnificence. We neither dread Russia as a foe, nor particularly desire her as an ally; but we do most earnestly desire to see her entering more cordially and unreservedly into the race of civilization. We wish to interchange -with her not the ideas and the materials of onlY military success, but of peaceful progress. In this sense Russia will find England much more of a sister and an ally than even France, which is still swathed and cradled by a jealous and prohibitory system. We want in Russia neither a foe nor an aUy, buLt simply a neighbour; and if Russia desires to be worth more fifty years hence, as either foe or ally, she will do well to accept this advice.
It is a striking exemplification of the tardiness of communications in the East that we are even now expecting the news of a conflict between the British army and the Persians. The Treaty of Peace was signed at Paris on the 4th of Irch, jrst two months since, and yet any day may bring the intelligence that MIohammerah, at the mouth of the Karoon river, has been occupied by Sir JAIEs OuTRAr as a base of operations in the country. It is strange indeed that some information on the subject has not yet reached us. The British General had been preparing for the expedition even before the battle of Kooshab. Reinforcements, particularly of light horse, were brought from India, camels a? mules were collected, and the expedition was expected to reach Mohammerah somewhere about March 20. For the last fortnight we have been waiting for tidings of the attack. A despatch will reach Constantinople by way of Bagdad in from 16 to 20 days; and, therefore, if the attack had beern made at the time purposed the news muit have arrived long ago. There still remains a chance of our hearing of a collision, but there i, happily, reason to believe that the news of a treaty having been signed wiU have reached the Persian Gulf in time to avert the furtherabhedimg of blood. It Eeems, however, likely that the delay which has evidelltly taken place was owing less to anticipations of peace than to proper caution on the-part of the commanader. Quite possibly, Sir JA&iN5s OvrnTRr, judging his force insufficient for an attack on a place which the enemy had time to defend, was waiting the arrival of fresh troops, and thus may have learnt the signature of the treaty in tine to desist from the enterprise. The news, we lean, was in fact sent on from Bpgdad on the 27th of March, and might be expected to reach Mjoham. merah some five or six days later. We may there. fore hope to hear that the force retured peaceably to Bushire. This expedition remains, however, not the less an important event. It was the first step ini the serious and regular invasion of the Persian Empire. Our Indian officers have long given their attention to the subject of a war in Persia, and. the testimony of every one acquainted with the localities is, that an advance from Bushire acros8 the mounitains tow,lrds Shiraz on the East3 Qr Ispahan on the
In a romark which we made this day last week we have been- strangely misunderstood, and the ,ubject is quite important enough to invite a correction of the error. Speaking of the extension of the suffrage to be provided in any new Reform iBill, we argued th-t the qualifications of an elector :might be looked for in the information as well as the property which he possessed, and, as an expression of the idea, we suggested that a voter, on presenting himself at the polling booths, might be asked to testify to his own education by writing his name. This suggestion was described by Mr. WATKErN, in his speech at Yarmou%h the other day, as a proposition for giving a vote to every man who could write-something very diffexent indeed from our true meaning. Our proposal 'would simply have excluded from the exercise of the electoral franchise persons whofly uneducated, 'Whatever might be their other qualifications. The idea, in fact, was very analogous to that of the provision which requires that a voter, Whatever may be his possessions, shall be of full age before voting. Certain property conveys a recognized qualification, but to this qualification lutst be added presumptive evidence of the dis- cretion or inteRligence of the individual. Although, however, our suggestion, as we observed at the time, was offered upon its own merits, and tended, indeed, to the encouragement of edacation as well as the elevation of the suffrage, we are confident in our opinion that for the principle of our argument-that is to say, for the assignment of the franchise to intellectual as well as pecuniary qualifications, there is good warrant to be found both in precedent and reason. We think, indeed, we may advance a step higher, and ask what is the particular nature of the qualification which lies at the bottom of all instinctive assumptions in any controversy about the distribution of political power ? What do we say when we argue that certain persons or dlasses are not to be trusted with the suffrage? MW;at do we recommend as the necessary preparati. n for the extension of political rights to greater numbers of the community ? Does any man, Whig or Tory, Conservative or Radical, say that such and such classes have not got money enough to be made electors, or that men must somehow or other be rendered more generally opulent before they can be admitted to the polling booths ? Nothing of the kind. When we talk about raising the great body of the nation to a certain standard of politi 9ility, we never imply that people are all merely to have their pockets filled; -wYe mean, that they should be so educated as to comprehend the obligations of citizenship, whetber they be rich or poor, and one of the chief arguments for national education in some quarters has been the necessity of thus paving the way for a greater community of electoral rights. As far, therefore, as the principle goes, we are entitled to regard it as commending itself to us almost involuntarily by its intrinsic and self-evidtnt propriety. As to precedent, we can produce also that peculiar requisite in most impressive and unexceptionable shape. Two of our most eminent constituencies are founded upon intellectual qualifications only. In the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge no property qualification whatever is required, the right of voting being conferred purely andsimply by that evidence of education which is conveyed by the possession of a certain degree. We shall be told, of course, that the operation of the principle in this case affords very little guidance, inasmuch as the intellectual element of qualification is overpowered in practice by the. property qualifications which a large majority of University graduates possess at the same time. But this was not the case when the franchise was first conferred; it is an accident resulting from social changes, and, moreover, something of a similar resultmight not improbablyattend the principle in its further extension. Why should it be presumed that an educated man must be a needy man, even though his education may not have been certified by the academical stamp ? it is at this point, perhaps, that some persons may take up their ground of opposition, and argue that if qualifications derived from education would be accompanied, as would doubtless happen in many cases, by qualifications derived from property, it must plainly be superfluous to provide for the recognition of the former apart from the latter. Why should we make a specific assignment of the franchise to captains, bamristers, physicians, or schoolmasters, when nine-tenths of Euch persons are sure to possess the right of voting already on some other grounds? Admit that a man entrusted with the education of some 50 or 100 embryo voters ought to be a voter himself, is it no' certain that he would be so in virtue of his house if not of his land-of his taxes if not of his rent-roll ? We reply that such electors are valaable enough to calL for the- admission of even the small proportionwho maybe excluded; and further,that this proportion may not be quite se small as- is imagined. No doubt, the residence of many . of them would be such as to carry a qualification with it, but the town or village in which they reside may not return members to Parliament, or they may live in lodgings or chambers. They may be contributing a full share to the revenue of the country, but only indirectly, instead of directly. They may enable half-a-dozen householders to pay their rates, and yet not be ratepayers themselves. A very good test at this point would be the assessnment to the Income Tax, and we remember the criterion was suggested in past discussions. Beyond all qaestion, the contribution of 101. to the service of the State in this form ought to convey as strong a presumption of electoral competeuce as the payment of any other imposts; but we decline very decidedly to take up this particulaposition. We earnestly hope to see the Income Tax and all its machinery abolished by the time a new Reform Bill comes well into operation; nor are we at all inclined to purchase the convenience of the test at the cost of the duty. Returning, however, to the principle under consideration, we must express our belief that it would operate to the public advantage in a variety of ways. It would remove the dissatisfaction natural to men with such qualifications if unenfranchised, and it would bring a new and very serviceable element into representavion. Persons in the position we have been describing-that is to say, men with considerably more than average education, with incomes in many cases of respectable amount, and yet without the privilege of giving a vote, must not only possess, by the very nature of the case, many of the qualifications desirable in an elector, but must also be exempt from some of the undesirable liabilities to which some electors are exposed. It would be hard to reach them as a body by any other means than those of argument, and in all likelihood they would vote upon their separate convictions, *vithout even the influence of political contagion. These we think would be strong recommendat;ons; and, if such a recognition of purely personal qualifacations should communicate a stimulas to the grea work of national education, few, we presume, would consider the result as otherwise than beneficial. There is no fear, unfortunately, that tle applicants for the franchise on the score of superior education will present themselves in any overwhelming numbers; and, as the extensioin of the suffrage implies in its very terms a large augmentation of the electoral body, we should rejoice at the admission of an element which certainly cannot preponderate, but which can hardly operate otherwise than for:good.. -.

A TITLE TO ORDERS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TT[ES. Sir,-A correspondent has lately informed the world through your columns of some of the methods in which a title to orders maybe obtained by needy candidates for the ministry. I can a tale unfold of other means of opening the side doors by a golden key; and, though I feel a little compunction at " telling tales out of school," and am in some dread of being thought " an iM bird," &c., I shall make a clean breast of it, trusting that there may bo yet balm in Gilead for this particular canker which infects our Church. Some years bave elapsed since I was a candidate for holy orders; but I woll remember the strait I was in when, having sent in my name and the required papers to the Bishop of -'a secretary, I found myself, in the month of October, still ithout a title for the ordination, which was fixed for the ensuing Christmas. Perhaps I was a little particular, aud perhaps I had a right to be. I was not aware of any impediment, moral or physical, to inoapacitate me from exercising my adopted profession, and I had passed through Oxbrldge with credit, and obtained the regular three yeas testimonisl from the Read of of my CoUege. StiUl I could not get a title to suit me. In my dilemma I adopted the usual course; I adver. tised in the Rcaesistica Gazete, and paid my guinea o several institutions which professed to supply the most eligible titles to candidates for orcers. I had plenty of answers to my advertisement. Some appealed to my "zeal and devotion," others to my "private means," but aU were unanimously silent about remuneration for my sarvices. One "hoped that a sphere of labour in the Lord's vineyard would be a sufficient rewar another added " an unfur. nished house," a third hinted at "an opening for pupils, a fourth went so far as to offer "the use of a cow and a kitchen garden " in fact, I had my choice of all those compromises between the pocket and the conscience which are familiar to every needy rector and easy-going curate. I think the offer which staggered me most was one from an evangelical inaumbent, who offered no salary, it is true, but undertookto board and lodge myself andwife in -the parsonage-houso for the sum of 150 per annum, paid quar- terlyin advance I Aterthisliberal offer I began-tothink 1- had made a mistake in supposing that the labourer (at any rate, the curate) was "w worthy of his hire," and that I must be content to serve my apprenticeship without wages; but when I applied to the clerical agents I found that I was even expected topay a premiam to enter the Church. "You must not look to having a stipend the first year," said one ; " indeed, it was only last week as a gent. mado me a present of 1D pound for getting of him a title." I did not take the hint and do likewise, but a few days after I heard of a title which, as a last resomrce% I was only t4o glad to accept, for It was now near the end of October, and all this anxiety and running about had sady interfered with the studies nocessary for the examination, and were not calculated to foster that calm and devotional feeling which is not lems an essential part of the preparatlon for the ministry. The rev. Close Shearer, Bachelor of Divinity, and lately Fellow of St. Gohard's, Oxbridge, was a pluralist, and being incapacitated by a late Act of Parliament from doing the duties of two churches at the same time at the distance of mnore than five statute miles apart, was forced to keep a curate, and to the said curate he was compelled by law " to pay the yearly stipend of 1001., to be paid by equal quarterly payments, together with the surplice fees, amounting on the average to 21. 10s. per annum, and to give to the said curate the use of the glebe-house, garden, and offices, which he, the said curate, was required to occupy." Moreover, it is written in a foot-note in the bishop's license that " the bishop will revoke the license, and will not countersign the testimonial of any curate who accepts a smaUer sum than the stipend assigned in the license." And to fortify the agreement and avoid subterfuge the following clause is inserted in the nomination of the said curate *We, the before-named Close Shearer, B., amnd Cloruent G,een,B.A.do declare to thesaid L,ord dbidop ofz-zas reolervs namey , ithe mayd a. sherer, B D, do decarse that I - b Dde intend to pay, and I, the said . Green, BeA, do denbe that I C hea ade' intend to receiven the whol actual stipen mentioned iu the soregoing nomanation snd statement, rithout dan dduction or reverva abon whatsoever. " mWitns oger hands thisa-pdar of- Nowr, it may surprise some of your readers to learn that all this awas wtaste paper. The beforenamed Close Shearer bad a ver strong objection to pay the above "whole actual stipend," and not the slightest intention of doing so;and the said Clement h nten n end to reive the Abwove-named sum, however much ho mnght have wished be might get it; and the said lord Bishop ofr - was per fectly awIare tent the pecuniary part of the license and the eomination was a slemn farce, to which he was not ashamed to lend his counten nee. And how did the above-n med paries manage to drive a ceach and sm through this caefully worded and signed by agreement ? Much as I regret my share of the transaction, I think the other parties had les rason to be proud of theirs. The worth rector had lately purocased for the sum oft 601. the furniture of the outgoing curate, and this he propIedtolet tohme, and I agreed to hire for "the above named sum of lO00'. per annum, payable quarterly." A memorandum to this effect was drawn up and signed by both of us, and the affair was compiete. The rector got a curate for the annual interesi of 601., and I got a tit'e to ordersand ahalf furnished house, and considered myself w lucky man, I don't think, however, that my future rector behaved. welilto me in driving over in big aije to my furnished houae durnug the interval between any signinig theagemnt. and coming into residenace; and earryig off thie best efS thie portable articles of furniture and replacing -therm writh worn out battered rubbish froa bis own house. 2ibor did the parishioners think it added te his dignity.to-be aee driving off wt hi "plunder," with a barometer sticldig bit of one windowv and a lot of garden tools out of *6 other, while be sat wedged'in with wedgwood anzlhardware, more ridicuou than the swoedbearer in the 3ord'Mayoe's carriage oa the 9th of November.

Sir, I wr,e this in sorrow, baut not as without hope.

RST,SIINSTBR BALL. The designs for the new Government offices will be exhibited to-day (Monday), and on alternate days for some weeks, at Westminster-hall, which has been completel converted into an art-gallery for the purpose, and will remind some spectators of the days when it was appropriated to the exhibition of the Parliament cartoons.E However, as the plans now sent in are far more numferous than those works of pictorial art, a more careful arrangement has been necessary. The hall has been divided lengthways, as far as the dais, into four lanes, which by cross partitions are cut up, as it were, into separate rooms. Thus an immense surface is gained for the disposition of the drawings in addition to the dais itself, which forms one largo room in which are exhibited (besides drawings) the few models that have been submitted to the Government. The quantity of works exhibited shows that this vast superficies was absolutely required. No blank space that might have been advantageously occupied is left vacant, and not a single design is badly placed. Whatever is the size of the drawing, and in whatever style it is executed, everybody can inspect its merits, so that none of those complaints respecting the " iight line" and the distance therefrom that sofrequently disturb the tranquillity of pictorial galleries will be heard in reference to Westminster-hall. To the Chief Com- missioner of Public Works,under whose superin-1I tendeince the exhibition has been conducted, the I highest credit is due for this exceIlent arrange. ment. Above 200 competitors contend for the Government prize, and, some of these having contributed largely, the designs exhibited are upwards of 600. With admirable skill have the works of each separate artist been kept distinct from the rest, one common number being extended to all the Droductionis of one hand. Mere juxtaposition would have required wide spaces of demarcation; and there would have been so much room lost; but this method of numnbering, in addition to juxtanosition, I at once affords the public as much knowledge as the Government itself possesses. The names of the artists are of course unknown, and will remain so until the important question of merits is decided. A motto is attached to each set of designs, I and this, with the accompanying number, is the limit of the individuality at present revealed. The subject on which the artists have bestowed their energies is of a twofold kind, and therefore the works themselves may be divided into two classes. In the first place, designs were to be made for the new public offices assigned to the War and Foreign Departments; in the second place, the space bounded by Downing-street, Westminster Abbey, St. James's Park, and the river offers a field for improvements which the Government is desirous! of effecting. Thus, on the one hand, we have a collection of architectural drawings, properly so called, and, on the other, a series of charts referring to the area just specified, and in some cases extending all over London. A remarkable instance of the enlarged view of the matter is to be found in the | huge model exhibited on the dais. Raising the I buildings on the site more particularly under consideration, the artist has carried his solid map as far as Bermondsey, and has even thrown in a model of St. Paul's as an extra ornament. This is only one specimen among verymany of thevast amount of industry and talent that has been brought into activity by the Government offer. With respect to the charts generaly, it may be observed that they nearly all presuppose a new site for Westminster-bridge. To the ordinary public those charts will, of course, be the least attractive portion of the exhibition, though doubtless there are connoisseurs in metropolitan geography to whom they will afford an epicurean feast. One project is worth mentioning for it3 extreme oddity-namely, a scheme for carrying a park or flower-garden through the Thames lengthwise so as to leave a navigable canal on each side. Surely the gentleman who would convert thoThames into a source of fragrance is fairly entitled to banish from the mind that imaginary incendiary who would have setit on fire, and whosemischievous proficiency has so long been regarded as a sign of unattainable wisdom I Even of the more popular section of the exhibition, that which con&ists, of the de3igns for the two public offices, we shall not attempt a detailed description. If the leap from an architectural drawing to an actual work in brick and mortar or masonry sorely tries the gymuasic power of the imagination, still more formidable is that which it must take if it would spring from a verbal description to an architectural drawing. The circumstance that the names of the artists are not revealed furnishes an additional motive for remaining within the bounds of mere generalities. There is a sort of humanity attached to a surname that will induce a multitude to sympathize with Smith and Brown, though it may have no knowledge of the precise individuals to whom those family designations by right appertain. But the record of a combat between "152" and "112" will find butachily body of readers, and even the mention of the side on which victory falls will awaken little emotion beyond that circle of confidential friends to whom the Arabic numerals are symbols for fair European names. Avoiding, tben, the delicate task of comparison, by which we might possibly offend many, and by which we should assuredly gratify none except the smaUest cliques, we would remark that aU sorts of styles compete with each other in their claims to be adopted for the two offices devoted to War and to Foreign Affairs. One artist would make them look like cathedrals; another would give them the appearance of pleasant vilas; a third thinks they ought to resemble the Tuileries as closely as possible: a fourth hope to find them a repetition of some Flemish town-halU; a fifth sighs for the re-edification of Greek temples; a sixth would plunge into the depths of the dark ages, and thence pluck the extinguisher-towers of the Norman castles * a seventh would have a fantasic, fillagree, allegorical affair, reminding one of those temporary edifices by which the municipal happiness of Belgian towns is so often testified. But, above all the rest, that style which goes by the name of the " Anglo-Italian" predominates. The tendency to go back to pointed arches and florid embeUishments is still exceptional, and if this exhibition is to be taken as an index of the general sentiment, we are even now more " classical" than medireval. Although few, probably, but professed architects will regard the rival designs in a spirit of comparative criticism, there is one virtue which seems to pervade the whole exhibition, andwhich all spectators can appreciate alike. We alude to the marvellous industry displayed by nearly the whole of the competitos. 'Whatever has been the theory of the artist, he bas carried it out manfully and conscientiously, and, even if no such things as Foreign-offices and War-offices were required, there are many designs that would claim admiration as works of pictorial art, in which noble edifices are represente6 with all the broad effect proper to a painting on a, huge sale, and withall the minute accuracy that might be employed in the imitation of a fril os a ruffle. There is no such thing as shirking in an architectural design. Every ornament, every detail mnst be fuly indicated; and marvel indeed is the manner in which the necessarvndications have been made compatible with pictorial beauty. United by juxta-position and Ly identity of number, the ground plan, the eleve.tion in out- nue, anas the picturesque view appear in this exhibition as the prose and the poetry of architectural it When the competition is decidc,a and- aR the dasigna save one are returned to tbh,ir creators, we might fancy some eccentric collectr ,r buying them, and preserving them in one hugepo, .tfolio, asthe views of some imaginary city, aboundi, ig in edifices of the most varied- kind, and peopled -,ith inhabitants of the most lively fancy and un' earied perseverance. It was not till the close of last session that Sir Benjamin Hall was empower ed to offer the premium to which the exhibition ow' as its origin, and now, at the beginning of May, we may literally wander through streets of archit ectural plans and drawings, nearly every one of -which required the greatest labour, in the shape of execution, after the imagination had finished Its work. The exhibition 'Uill be open to the public on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays from 10 till 6, and oa Satur days from 12 till 6, until further notice.

I-EXHIBITION OF THE ROYAL ACADEMy.- Pursuing our criticism of the works of Acade-i micians and Associates, and deferring for the pre- sent our remarks on ortmaiture and landscape pain t' ing, we find MIr. Thth very much below his usual level in the two small works which are all he contribates this year. Even such trivial subjects as " Kate Nickleby atlMadame Mantalini's" (125) and "A London Flower Girl" (152) might have been I made interesting, either by perfection of painting or charm of expression. Mr. Frith's strength, of late years, at least, has not lain in expression; his characteristic merit has always been dexterous an* workmanlike use of his materials, due, apparently, to an intelligent study of the method of the young Teniers and his school, and pushed sometimes to the verge of vicious sparlde and over display of skdlL. But his cunning seems somehow to have failed him this year. Both his pictures are ivid and heavy in colour, as well as commonplace in expression. We are told that Mr. Frit has a large work in hand. This may be an excellent reason for exhibiting small, or few, or no pictures; but it isno excuse for exhibiting bad ones. As one of our pleasanteat painters of what our grandfathers used to call conversation pieces," Mr. Frith ought to shrink from giving his name to absolute trivialities. There is better stuff in him, both as painter and as intelligent beipig, than,can possibly fnd employment on the " Sherry, Sir"s and " Commg, Sir"3s, and other works of t;he bagman or " commercial gent." school? which he seemrs of late to have falletLinto. These thmgs sel well, and they make good marketable coloured prints, but better things will do as much. When we remember this painter's "Iargate Sands," the humour, observation, and facility ib showred, the capacity for painting the contemporary British physiognomy in all itS range, from infancy to senility, fom donkeydnverdomn to amuggest citizenship, from absolute ugliness to very satsingbeauty, of the daily bread order, we cannot feel satisfied that Mr. Frisk is not nearer being the Hogarth of his time. Mr. Abraham Cooper and Ur. Uwins arelong past criticism,- " 'on ragionamn di lor: 7on gmarda e pans." We feel almost inclined to say the same of Mr. Frost. There should be at length an end of halfdraped nymphs by ones, or by twos, or by threesof nymphs of the wood and nymphs of tho sea cave, of nymphs sporting with conchs on the strand and nymphs wringing out their moist tresses mid-thigh deep in green se. Is Mr. Frost altogether nympholeptic ? The ancients considered their ladies sources offrenzy; nowadays there is more danger of their engendernng imbecility. What a godsead it would be to Mr. brost could his better genius guide him to some such change of subject and, style as a few years ago translated JIr. Hook out of the unreaities of medimval msquerade into the realities of contemporary reality-from an imaginary Venice of the 14th century to this living England of the 19th -from-Falirros and Bianca Capellos to seafaring Beers of Clovelly, and clod-compelling Toms, Dicks, and Earries of Surrey, with their fitting helpmates. Mr. Hook has risenfrom the touch of true earth like Antzeus, with new -rigour. Iet Mr. Frost take a hearty, healthy inpiration of salt sea air from over Clovelly se-wal, whither Mr. Hook carries us again this year (16IO). There is one of the North Devon boatmen on the look-out, vwith his family about him-making out the sail in the horizon through the well-worn old- glass. Perhaps there may be kith or kin of his aboard her -perhaps he is in hope of a piloting job; at aU events, you may see that John Beer andhisboy, the stripling who stands there with the tarpaulin coat over his arm, will soon be tumbling down by rough stone, orseaworn pile, or loose bight of mooringrope, from Clovelly sea-wall, into their boet, and off with a Iong piU and a strong puU to board the stranger. EIr. IRook's picture is a genuine"bif' out of CloveDy nature, true down to the patch on John Beer's head, where the sou'wester has worn off the hair, for the man is stiU hale and hearty, and, roughened as he is by sea and wind, counts nearer 40 than 50, for al his hard-a-weather face. There is. another and a touching little story, from the same place, and among the same class, in his " Widow's Son going to Sea," where the poor mother is letting her eldest born go down to tie cruel sea under which his father's bones are bleaching, and where the son's may perhaps one day lie beside the father's.. The boy is ashamed to cry before the men who am Banding his chest down overthe sea-wall into the boat; butyou can sea the, te3rs are not far off, snd you feel that so son as they have lovered themselves out of sight the boy will be in his mother's arms for one brief pasionate' strain, and then, before her tears and his own are dry upon his cheek, the oars will be springing, and the boat making good way to the ship in the offing, and then themotherwill feel a loneliness such as she had not felt since her husband sailed on that voyage from which he never came home again. In his " Shipboy's Letter" Mr. Hook has sed from the North Devon coast to an inland Surrey farm, with its rad marl banks, and gorse, and firs, and wealth of green feied and woodland. The potatohoer iS resting from his work to. hear his wvife read the letter from the boy who has perversely and unaccountably gone to sea from that inland farm- ead. There is not much in the incident, but the sweet country air that breathes about the picture makes it pleasant and profitabl, in the choky exhibition-room. Mr. F. Stone has rissn as much above his mark this year as Mr. Frith has fallen below his. Poor " Margaret at the Spinning-wheel" has been bopainted to a frightful amount. t 'Mein rub isthinb IMain hertri*schwerv.'> has been set to al manner of pictorial accompaniments at home, and still rore in Germany, but the subject is one of such genuine pathos that it is difficult to exhaust it; while- it can stil stir the painter it will never fail to touch' the spechtor. And Mr. Stone, to judge by this sweet- pax,& Eace and tremulous lip, has been really moved by the idea of poor heart-stricken Ga-Stchen. It is a most tender and pathetic. picture, eaefully drawn and painted; and, after giving a sigh to Margaret, we are glad, still' under Mr. Stone's eccvYo to exchange a merry "Sbon jotlr" with tbit cartload of roguish matelotowho-have got a lift in an empty hayeart (35v; and; seem to have altoge'her overpowered the poor driver-with their bright eyes and ringing tongues- and chimes of laughter.- If Mir.

FOREIGN INTBELLTGPAC. RANCa (PRau oDB OWN COREoNDnIT.) (A porton of tho foUow2ng appe3rod gm oW nzcod rltlon of Satuday: -1 FARIS, FRIDAY, MAY 1, 6 P.M. Dr. Kern (if ono may be allowed to speak again of the Neuch§tel question) has returned to Paris with authority to accept, and no doubt sign, the arrangement agreed to by the representatives of the four Powers. Dr. Kern had at fiat some misgivings as to the superexcellent quality of the terms agreed on. He saw the Emperor, however, before setting out, and His Majesty, anxious to have the business off hiz hands, after having contributed to make it more difficult, and in order tokeephis maind serene for theGrandDuke's vsit, told him it was a capital thing, and even congratulated him Dr. Kern, though a Republican, thought Derhaps that what an Emperor said must be right, and arrivedinBerne somewhat,but not entirely, relieved. I am informed, howvever, that he found much dissatisfaction in Switzerland about the decision of the Conference. The Swiss cannot be pasaded that, in consequence of the guarantee to Pmia for the administration of charitable ilnattutions, that Power will not take every opportunity of interfering, and that therefore the complete independence of Neuchatel is far from being secured. I suppose the Swiss are right, and that Neuchl&tel will be the cause of trouble at some future period. No day is, I believe, yet fixed for the aigning, but it cannot be very distant. The Grand Duke Constantine and the officers of his suite dined ye3terday with the Emperor; the Russian Amabassador and the secretaries of the Embassywere of the party. The Grand Duke paid a visit thismorningtoPinceJerome at the PalaisRoyal, to Prince Napoleon, and to Madame Demidoff (the Princess Mathilde). Prince Jerome returned the visit in the course of the day at the Tuilerie3. He goes to-night to the French Opera, where great prepara tions have been made, A considerable number of people besieged the doors of the theatre the whole of the morning in the hope of obtaining tickets. The theatres, the hotels, and some other public buildings, together with some shops, still keep up the flags with which they were decked yesterday. The Grand Duke also visited the hotel of the Russian Embassy, In the Faubourg St. Honore. Accompanied by the Ambassador and the members of the Embassy, he proceeded to the Russian chapel, in the Rue Neuve de Berr, where a Te Deum was chanted. The chapel was crowded. He then went to see the Sainte Chapelle, the Palais,de Justice, and Notre Dame, all which he examined with much attention. Among the Russians who have come to Paris on the occasion of the Grand Duke's visit are the editors of the principal new-spapers at St. Petersburg ; two, of the Moscow journals; ancd the editor of the principal paper published at Odessa. The Empress Dowager of Rusia paid a visit on the 25th of April to the Pope, at the Vatican. Her Majesty was attended by a numerous suite. She was received at the foot of the grand staircase by MIonignor Borromeo, Majordomo of Eis Holiness, and by other officers of the Papal household. She v/as introduced by Cardinal acca to the Pope, who camne no the door of his saloon to meet her, and expressd ids great joy at seeing Her Majesty. After a long conversation with the Holy Father, the Empress introduced the ladies and gentlemen of her suite, to whom the Pope spoke in the most courteous terms. General de Rochefort, Governor of the Cavalry School at Saumur, has left for London, charged with a mission which relates, I am informed, to the purchase of fresh horses for the cavalry. It is said that. in consequence of the increased naval force about to be sent to the China Seas, the command of the entire French force in those waters will be given to a Vice-Admiral, who will have the two Rear-Admirals under his orders. An accident, attended with serious consequences, has occurred on the railway in the vicinity of Villeneuve, between Agde and Beziers, two traiuns coming into collision, and 30 persons being wounded. As one train on reahing Agde was rather behind time, a telegraphic message was sent on to ask whether the line was clear; the answer given was that the train might come on, and that the one from Narbonne should be stopped at ViUleneuve. It left, but, unfortunately, the driver of the Narbenne train refused to atop at Villeneuve, and the collision was the result.

The curiosity of the public to see the Grand Duke Constantine last night at the French Opera was dis- appointed. Every preparation had been made to I receive him; the Court tradesmen in the Rue Lepelletier, leading to the theatre, had their houses decked out with flags and gay streamers, with the Russian eagle on a yellow ground, floating in all directions. Crowds of curious people remained in the Boulevard and the Rue Lepelletier till near 10 o'clock, but no Grand Duke came. The cause assgned is the mourning of the Imperial Court of France for the death of the Duchess of Glocester, and, if there is no very warm feeling between the Courts of St. Petersburg and St. James, there was at least a certain courtesy due to the Court of which the Grand Duke is now the guest. The Grand Duke Constantine yesterday afternoon visited the Mus6e de Cluny, where the Prince was received by M. de Sommerard, the director. His Imperial Highness went through all the different collections of the middle ages, and particularly inquired of the director what parts of the building had been enlarged and improved through the initiative of the Emperor. In a very sbort time after his return to the Tuileries the Prince again went out alone on foot, to take a walk through Paris. "1 General Todtleben," says the Cournier de MAarsei:o, "has not accompanied Prlnce Constantine, as many persons have spposed. The illustrious engineer is to remain some days in this city, and immediately after the Grand Dake,s departure he accompanied Colonel de Blois, of the Artillery, to examine the effects produced by the explosion of the mine at Ia Frioul." A letter from Toulon of the 1st inat. informs us that the Grand Duke Constantine prenous to quitting that town, had left the folonng wgms a gifta :-2,000f. for the Charitable Committee; 200f. to the porter of the establishment charged vrith t care otf herrince's portrait, which is piaced among those of the benefactors of that institution. 5oof to the Sisters of Charity, and 500f. to the director of the theatre; to the crew of the Maritime Prefect's barge, 600f.; and to the servants at the Prefecture, 2,800f.

(FROM ov OUBw OWNOREPONDENT.) VfIENA, Ainm 29. The oldest fianciers in Vienna state that they never recollect to have seen the Bourse in such a state of feverish agitation as it was yesterday. The panic was so great that several kinds of industrial stock varied 3 or 4 per cent. within as many minutes, and the Credit Bak had an Opportunity of observing that the attempt to bolster up the new railroad siares was useless. For a time the shares of one or two of those railroads on which the frst instalment of 30 per cent, had been paid werae conlsiderably below par, and, although they sulbsequently recovered, the Finance Department lost no time in publishin the followving article: " When the concession for the elnbmuok.SinekIokExiwd was signed by the Emperor a few days sinoe HIis Maesty vas pleaed to givo orders that it should be taken into con. sideration whether, in the present state of the moneymarkot, it would not be advisable to discontinue the con, cessions for joint-stock enterprises (um!ernamungen r W akticn emission). "We learn that the discussions on the question are nearly at an end, and that theo reult Wi te such as is required by the neoessties of the times." The appearance of the foregoing in the Oeserreichische Corvespondenz of last night produced a tranquilzig effect, but the money-maket is so terribly out of order that there is little chance ofI its recoverlng itself, unless it is officially declared that no call will be made on the public for the nex", 12 or 15 months on account of the newly conceded railroads. The last instalment of 20 per cent. on the 300,000 Credit Bank shares of 200 fl. must be paid in June, and it is morally certain that towards the end of that month there will be another and even more severe monetary crisis than there has been now. When, eight or ten months ago, it was said in my correspondence that Baron Bruck was endeavourmg to accomplish in three or four years what Austria might possibly be able to do in 10 or 20, the remark gave grat offence, but it is now generally acknowledged that His Majesty's Ministers have greatly overrated the strength of the Austrian money-market and the resources of the country. Very great complainta are made of the way in which the employs make the preparations for the -eception of their Maiesties mn Hungary. The different communities are ordered to provide this, that, and the other, and in general they are afraid to remonstrate against such arbitrary proceedigs lest they should be considered lukewarm or disloyal. M. von Conrad, an employg, who is again at Pesth as burgomaster, disposes of the funds of the Muni- I cipality without troubling himself to ask its consent to bis measures, and information has reached this city that he has already expended a sum which Is not far short of 200,oOOfl. (20,0001.). The bebaviour of the employ6s in Hungary, and the total want of economy of the Austrian Government, give the greatest possible satisfaction to the Russians, who openly declare that Austria is Dlaying their game. The whole of the Arci&re Guard leaves for Pesth to-morrow, and it is probable that two or three of the Ministers will go there on Sunday next. The following passage in the address of the Hungarian Protestants is said to have given great offence:- "It cannot have escaped your Majests attention that the most salutary laws, if based on resolutions taken by Government, instead of being the emanations of the religious convictions of the Protestant Confesslons, are far from piuducing a tanquillzing effect: on the contrary, they create alarm, inasnuch as they shake principles which are based on the independence that is secured (gesichlrt) by the Protestant canons. The feeling of our independencewhich independence is secured by law and by treaties of peace guaranteed by foreign States,*-induoes us to hope that the settlement of our (spiritual) affhirs will be left to ourselves." As a German transltion of the Hungarian address was sent to the Emperor before it was read to him, His Majesty had tune to prepare the short reply wrhich he read to the deputation. Count Alexander Menradorif-Poumly waasyesterday maried to the Princess Alexsadrine Dietriobstein. Almost all the maembers of the Diplomatic Corps were present at the ceremony, which was performed in the chapel of the Papal Nuncio, who addressed a speech to the happy pair in a language which was supposed to be German. The fluctuations on 'Change were not so great as they were yesterday, but the tendency is evidently towards a further decline. RUSSIA. A telegraphic despatch from St. Petersburg, dated 29th April, says: " The prohibition of the exportation of gold has been rescinded. "The Government has just published the treaty of commerce and navigation with Japan. The treaty consists of nine articles. The ports of Simodr, Hakodada, and Wangasaki are thrown open to commerce." ITALY. The debate on the Bill for transferring the marine establishment of the kingdom of Sardinia to Spezzia commenced in the Chamber of Deputies at Turin on the 28th ult., and was continued in the following sitting. MM. Pareto, Pallavicini, and Solaro della Margherits were among the chief speakers against the Bill ; MX Mamiani spoke in its favour. Count de Cavour, in reply to the various arguments of the Opposition, denied his having awakened hopes of liberty among the Italians on his return from Paris, and declared that the policy of Piedmont was liberal, and not revolutionary. He showed that the fears entertained by some members thatthe projeetwas secretlyrecommended byaforeign Power (meaning England), with a view to seizing the place afterwards and converting it into a second Gibraltar, were utterly devoid of foundation, and that England, although she did not oppose the project, was far from being partial to it. How could she expect to take possession of Spezzia withoat a sanguinary war with all the European Powers, among whom France would stand foremost, since she would consider Toulon menaced ? Ai to France, he could not tell whether she an proved the project; but, considering the atfiance existing between that country and Piedmont, and the interests of France, he could not but think that she must see the improvement in the Piedmontese navy with pleasure, as caloulatedto render Piedmont strong in Italy. As to the Cabinet of Vienna, he declared he was perfectly ignorant of its opinion on the subject. Count deCavour conduded hisspeeeh with declarina thatPiedmontwould faithfullyrespect existing treathes, and use every effort to promote the prosperity and prog,ress of Italy generally. This declaration was received with great applause. SPAIN. (Fno] OUR ONi OVJN O1NDZT.) MADRID, AP'nM 28. Improbable though it may appear, I believe there can be no doubt of the truth of the report, of which you have already been informed, that xarvaez has for some time past been endeavouring to obtain the support and co-operation of O`Donneli, and that several persons have been charged to sound the latter General and even to make guarded overtures to him. It is difficult to conjectureon whatrounda the Duke of Valencia based his hopes of brnging about such a coalition, and What temptation he could offer to a man who, it is pretty certain, would accept under no circumstances a post lower than the highest. Whatever were the propositions made or intimated, they were not suchas O'Donneltdi. posed for a moment to entertain. The G7azette contains a deree summoning to the colours 50,000 men of the conscription of 1857. The reasons asigned for this large levy ar the natural casualties that have occurre in the army; the circumstance of only 16,000 men having bee levied in 1856, instead of the usual number of 25,000, and that of 32,000 men having been prema. turely relieved from service in consequence of the reduction of two years in the term of that service granted as a boon and reompense to the troops on the 11th of August, 1854; 50,000 men become therefore indispensable in order to maintain the army at It strength of 100,000, which the Government * This is probably an aAlldon to it (171), in which1 as is said, ngland sud HolIand g ntec the ghts of the Hungadia PrFoatata, judges indisPensable for "the support of the Throne, the preservation of public order, and the integrity of the Ionarchy." Another decree opens to the Mi. nister of War a credit of 6,476,660 reals for the first exense of clothing for the recruits. General Urbistondo, chief of the Kin's maiEtary household, and lately Minister of War in the Narvaez Cabinet, who has been for some time ill, was buried this morning with much pomp, the ang's carriage and aides-de-camp following in the procession. The Espana newspaper gives a sketch of Trbistondo'a life, interestingon account of the many adventures and vicissitudes it exhibits. Don Antonio de Urbistondo y Eguia, Marquis de La Solana, was about 54 years old when he died. In his youth he was page to Ferdinanad VI. In 1820, the corps of pages having been broken up in consequence of the revolution, he was sent to Onate to study Latinity. In 1821, a PRoyalist insurrection having broken out at Salvatierra, in the province of Alava, he joined it, and beeme one of its chiefs, but wau nade prisoner a few days later. A court-martial acquitted him on account of his youth ; he went to France and became aide-de-camp to his grandfather, General Egnia, a leading man in the Rogyalist conspiracies then going on. gUponthe Restoration, in 1823, he was Lieutenant-Colonel In 1833, a few days after Ferdinand's death, he joined Don Carlos in Portugal, and afterwards accompanied hia to England, whence he in a short time sailed for the north coast of Spain with 26 other officers chiefly of the Royal Guard. They intended joining Zumalacarregul, then in arms in the Basque provinces for Charles V., but were captured by an English cruiser and conveyed to Coruina. General Morillo, who commanded there, felt pity for this band of adventurous young men, saved them from death, to which they were condemned, and they were transported to Porto Rico. Thence they escaped on board a foreign ship, which conveyed them to England, whence, one after the other, they found their way to Navarre. Promoted to the rank of Brigadier, IJrbistondo was for some time chief of the Staff of Don Carlos's army; subsequently, as Major-General, he commanded a division in the celebrated expedition which the Pretender himself accompanied. He remained in Catalonia to organize the Carliat patas in that province, but their insubordination baffled his endeavours, and in a few months he returned to the Basque provinces. After the shooting of the generals at Estlla, early In 1839, he commanded the Castilian Diion, with which he tooka prominentpartintheterm tionoE | the civil war by the Convention of Bergara. After 1839 IJrbistondo was Captain-General of the Basque provinces, and of Navarre, wherehe suppreuedwith skIil and vigour the Carlist movement of 1848. In 1849 he was named Captait-General of the Philippines, and soon after his arrival at Manilla he planned and successfully carried out an expedition against the pirates of Sooloo, in reward for whichhe received his title of Marquis de la Sod n lIe returned to Enrope in 1854, was for three months Minister of War under Narvaez and afterwards first aide-de-camp to the King, which post he filled up to the day of hia death. Eelis the th Lieutenant-General who has died this year, the other five being Ordoner, lNogueras, Mazaredo, Iriarti, and Roncahl.I We have been vislted during the last three days by a gale from the west of a violence remarkable even in this gusty capitaL About two months ago the thermometer rose to 700 in the shad-; within the last three weeks the house-roofs early in the morning were seen white with frost, and the quicksilver within the last 24 hours stands but at a very few degrees above freezing point. The sun has great power, and in it one is scorched, but everywhere else frozen. These violent changes, not uncommon in Madrid, have had their natural e0ect in producing some severe illnesses, especially pulmonia or inflammation of the lungs. Madrid being just now a chaos of buildings thrown down, or being thrown down, or half built up, and thickly sprinlded with heaps of the rubbish from old tenements or of the materials for new ones, the atmosphere during, the present stiff breezes is literally loaded with a firm white ophthalmic dust, whicr rises to a considerable height above the town, and penetrates through closed windows into the topmost stories of houses. Viewedfromadistaut eminence, Madrid, in weather like this, must appear surmounted by a misty canopy of air-borne sand. Mr. Webster arrived here on Saturday evening, after a very rapid ourney, with despathies fromthe Foreign-office for Lord Howden. In the sketch of the Queen's Speech to be read at the opening of the Cortes which I transrmitted to you on Saturday it was mentioned that the Government contemplates improvements in the interior of the Chambers. The principal of these ia understood to be to grant the President the power of stopping anyorator who gives an irritating turn to a diseussion and of compelling him to be silent. The latitude this will give to the Pesident, and, through him, to the Govermnent, to check the attacks of the Opposition is evident. It is said to-day that this project of interior reform will be brought forward by the Government immediately the Chambers are opened, and that O'Donnell will be prevented thereby from fulminating the attack upon Mnisters he has been maturing, with the aid of his friends, in the retirement of his country villa. Letters from Seville state that the Duke and Duchess de Montpensier will leave that city on the 7th of May, and arrive in Madrid on the 10th. The Duke of Hamilton, who has been passing some time at Pau, is expected here this week. The Dachess, declining to encounter the horrors of Spanish roads for the sake of a bull-fight and a picture-gallery (the only two things worth seeing at Madrid), remains, I nderstand, at St. Sebastian. The Duke of Hamilton and the Duke of Berwick and Alba, being both connected by marriage with the Emperor of the French, are consequently connexions, although very distant, of each other, and the chieftain who holds his State in Madrid is to show Scottish hospitality to the chief of the Hamiltons. The Duke of Berwick and Alba, among whose names are those of " James Stuart," is said to be not a little proud of his Scotch blood,-Royal, with the bar sinister. Senor Gonzales Bravo has arrived in Madrid. General Serrano is hourly expected. It is said to bo uncertain whether Senores Mon and Alejandro de Castro will come to Madrid fromRome and Tarin. The Duke of Valencia has been il these last few days, but not seriously. Hfis health, however, is said to bo far from good. The trying weather we have had, and >-fhich still continues, causes much serious illness. The Queen is said to be in the fourth month of her pregnancy, and, as that is the period at which she has had more than one miscarriage, her physicians have ordered her to observe the strictest rules, not allowing her to leave the Palace. This regimen will terminate, it is believed, at the end of Mav, but It is doubtful whether Her Majesty will pay her usual summer visita to Aranjuez and La Granja.

HOMES FOB THE HOMBLESS. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TThEES. Sir,-Last autmnn yoa obliged me by inserting a letter upon the condition of the dwellings of the working classes of the metropolis, which succeeded in attrating a greater share of public attention than I had any reason to antic!. pate. May I now request you to favour ma with a limited space In your columns, that I may state a few facts relating to the subject which have been obtained by a committeo of gentlemen warmly interested in the improvement of the domestic accommodation of the humbler clasm of workmen in London ? The first object of the committee was to ascertain with comparative certainty the practicability of providing suitable dwellings for the worklng man in the neighbourhood of his occupation, at a cost so limited that a weekly rentil of 3s. for two rooms and all the requisites for cleanli. ness and decency should yield a return of 5 per cent. to the landlord, sfter the payment of aU expenses. An approved plan for a building, to contain 44 separate tenements, a club-room, and a small wabhbouse, was prepared, with reference to a certain site in a populous locality in Westminstes, where land was supposed to be obtainable upon moderate terms. An estimate was receivedfrom a responsiblo contractor in the neighbourhood, and the ap proximate annual expenditure which Would be inourred after its completion was ascertained by a careful comparison Of data supplied by a building of similar character already established in the same parish. After these preparatory steps had been taken and the result proved to be satisactory direct negotiations were entered into for the proposed site. These occasioned considerable delay; and ultimately the terms which were submitted by the proprietor were of such a nature as to prove the impossibility of obtaining the percentage considered bythe committee as essential to the snccess of their undertaking; they were therefore declined, and the plans, specifications, and estimates have been for the present laid aside. Though the committee feel some disappointment at this result, their experience has enabled them to arrive at the following conclusions, viz.:- 1. That it is practicable to erect a large and substantial lodging-house, containing from 40 to 50 convenient, well. ventilated, separate tenements, in London at the rate of 691. per tenement. 2. Tbatj though the price of land in the heart of London and Westminster raises the original cosb of each tenement at least 161., thereby rendering it equal to 85. per tenement, a return of nearly 4} per cent. will be yielded pon the total cost of the building, after the payment of rates, taxes, insurance, superintendence, repairs, loss on empty tenements, &o., supposing each tenement to be let at a weekly rental of only 3s. 3. That if the wealthy owners of land in the metropolis would come forward and aid the committee in their exertions byenabling themto purohase their land atsucha rate s should guarantee the required 6 per cent. to the public, they would adopt the surest and best means of remedying those evils which exist to a great extent among the lower classes of society-those fearful evils to which Dr. Letheby has so recently recalled public attention, and which cannot be removed until the very root from which they all sprlng shall have been eradicated and destroyed. Are the committee wrong in arriving at their 4th and last conclusion, that this derives Its nurture from the foul hotbeds which the poorly psid workman cals his home ? They believe that something must be done-effec. tivelyandcspeedily done; and they believe, too, that by thus pointing out the way something will be done. But public support and 00-operation are neceay for success, otherwise only partial good can be effectd. Private bejevolence may cause one or two piles of dwellings to be erected without regard to their being a remunerative investment of capital. They will therefore posse an eleemosynary h,. racter, and repel rather than invite public sympathy and support. It Is to guad againat this that I have troubled you with so long a letter. Should any of your readers wish to inquire more eloeely into this subject,Imay add that any letters addressed to the car of Mr. Bebbington, 426, Strand, will be forwarded to, Sir, Your most obedient aervn+L CYM4
Tnn LATE EXPLOSION AT LvN.DE-Satnraay Evening-The operations continue to progress in the most satisfactory manner, though less rapidly than could be desired, from tbe want of men. Large numbers have voinu. teered their asistance, but the viewexs felt that in so dan. gerons a work it would be exceedingly imprndent to employ any but the most experienced and careful miners, and they have only as yet been able to obtain the serices of about 80 miners of tbis character. At noon to-d&y another body was recovered, making the toa number exhumed 22. It wras found in the dip level, a little to the north of the shaft. It was in an exceedingly decomposed stte, but was very satla. facorily Identified, by a number of peculiarities in the dres, as that of a young man named George Towrusend, wtho lived at West Mfilton. The miners are engaRe in clearinz away the large falls on the north aide, and it is not expected that any large number of bodies wril be recovered for several days. The bodies recovered yesterday were this afternoon interred; those of Benjamin and Eliijah Beevors at GawbEer, near Barusley; and those ot Barnett Bailey and George, his son, at 1)arfleld. ThoW *i he whole area over rhich the fire raged has not yet been explored, from tho extended exainations made during the last fewv days, not the slightest doubt is entertained that tho whole of the fire is extinguished. All anxiety on that most imporwant point xa now happil at an end,
£AA7 E*POAr. COURT OF OHAXCERY, Si2UID-.' v. e ALLDAY V. SLZTC]MR. (Befor f Ul D IJOBD CragLOR 'Xhis part-heard appeal from a decree of VicejChsneUor Stuart was this morning reumedS. Thebin wasfil d by, ks.Allday, claiming an equtyto a Settlement of a leacy of 200. It appeared that rs .Alday was enititled wnder a will to two legacies of 1OOl. and 2001. respectively, the firt payable to her on her attaining the age of 2.L years, and the other on the death of the tenant for life of an esate upon whioh the legacy was charged. On her marriag Mm AU. day and her husband assigned the legacies to her father in consideration or a sum of 3004. then paid by him to them. Mr Ailday was not at that time 21 years of age, but orn her attaini that age the legacy of 1001. was paid. The father eventualy became entitled to the estate, and died, devising it to the defendant. The question was whetber the aseignment on the marriage of Mrs. Allday was a reduction into possession by the husband of the wife's legacy of 200X., as nothing further was done. The ViceChancelor thought it was not, and decreed in favour of the plaintiff. Mr. Bacon and Mr. C. Barber were counsel for the plain. tiff); Mr. Malins and Mr. Osler for thefiefendant (appeal. ingi Mr. Greene, for the husband, supported the decree. 'he LOBDj CHANELLOR held that the father of Mr sAliday, by becoming possessed of the estate upon wthich the legacy was charged, was in the same position as if the legacy had been actually paid to him, and therefore reversed the deciion of the Court below and dsmissed the bill with WAX.MLEY Vm. VAUGHAN. This was an appeal from an order of Vioe-Chmoollor Stuart, and relatea tothe construotion of a settlementmade on the marnage of ThorauDsickin, theyounr, in the year 1827. Thomas Dicldk, tho eIdera by his will, dated the 11th of January, 1805, devised certain real estates to trastee for a term of OO years in trust to enable them, in case his son Thomas Dicldn should have two or more children beddes an eldest son, to ralee such sums not exceeding 8.000L. for the portions of all such children as Thomas Dickin should appoint, and in default of appointment, then to and among all such children in equal shareg. In the year 1827, by a settlement on his marriage Thomas Dickin, the younger, in execution of the power, appointed that the trustees should immediately after his decease raise for the portions of his younger children (in cae there should be two or more) the sum of 6,0002 ; and in case he should survive his wife, and should afterwards die without having been married again, or if so maried he ahoulA not have any issue of the secnd marriage, then that the trustees should raise, in case there should be two or more chlldren of the then intended marriae,such further sum of 2,0001. for their portions Thomas Dickin, the settlor, reserved to himself the power of directing in what shares aind proportons the sums to be raised should be dinid among the younger children, and also Twerved io himself the powers and authorities by the will given tohim. By an indenture of settlement made on the marriage of ono of his daughters in August 185, Thomas Dicidn appointed the sumo 2,000., part o the kum of 8,000 by thea w made raiseable for the portions of youner children, upon trust for the benefit of such dalghter, her husband, and children. Thomas Dickin, the younger, died in October 1855, intestate, leaving his wife and seven cbildren him survivng. Under these circumstances the Vice.Chancellor held that the whole sum of 8,0002 was raiseable, 2,0002. of which was to be invested in trust for the benefit of the married daughter, her husband, and family, and the remaining 6,000b. to be applied equally for the benefit of the younger children of Thomas Dickin, except the married daughter. The case was not concluded at the rising of the Court Mr. Bacon, Mr. Malins, llr. Cairns, Mr. ToDler, Mr. Humphreys, Mr. Eddis, andMr. Sargent were the oounsel in the case. (BAefmo the LOBD JLo rcxs of APn.AL.) LORD CREWE V. RDLESTON. This appeal from a decision of Vice-Chancellor Stnart was heard at very great len h on the 13th, 14th, 16th, and 17th of March, when their lrdships reserved judgnent fr. Craig and Mr. Lambert, on behalf of Lord Crewe, supported the order for the injunction, and also (by an arrangement) supportedthe motionfor a decree; 3r. Wigram andr. Amphlett appeared for the defendant, Edleston, the clerk to the trustees; and Mr. Waler, Ur. Wiggles. worth, Mr. Pearson, and Mr. Roweliffe for the mortgagees of the toUls, other than Lord Crewe. The Vice-ChanceUor's order restrained the trustees from reducing the tolls on the old and new rosdsupon whichlord Crewe held a mortgage, as he al1egedaana the defendants denied, and from removing some of the toll-houses. The question in dispute depended upon the construction of twoprivate Acts of Parliament, worded with more than ordinary obscurity, having regard to the General Turnpike Act, .3dof George IV., cap. 12. Lord Justice TuRNE in an elaborate judgment, in which he referred at very great length to the several clauses of the statutes in uestion, and which occupied nearly an hour in delivery, herd that the order of the Court below must be modified as to dissolve the injunction, so far as it related to the toll-houses, without prejudice to any question, and the remainder of the order to remain. Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUCE added,-I agree I have nothing to add, except, if it be an exception, that the trustees have so acted as justly to expose themselves to the strongest ooservation, and that, this more than litigious attempt to deprive Lord Crews of his property having for the present been defeated, if the trustees should be so iU advised sasto renev any similar attempt, I hope and believe that it wi be in the power of this Court to restain and defeat that also. CLARKE V. TME ROYAL PANOPTICON OP SCIECE AND ART. The agpeal motion in this case was from an order of ViceChance orl ndersley, dissolving an injunction which he had granted to restrain a sle of the Panopticon. Mr. BAiLy raised a preliminary objection respecting the effect of the appeal upon another suit wbieh had been instituted relating to the same nperty. Mr TER. LL insisted that he was entitled to proceed withoise motoon, notwithstanding the objection, and pro- -L@ordJustice KNior BRuCE.-Yon may, if you think fit,go onwith your motion, but you know rwhat will come Mr. TERRELL said he felt It to be his duty to proceed. He then stated in etnso the provisions of the charter and contended that the powers conferred upon the corpor;tion did not justify them in inserting a power of sale in a mortgage they had executed. Mr. Stiffe was on the same side. Mr. Baily and Mr. C. Hall appeared for some of the defendants, and Mr. RlawlBnson for others; Mr. Glasse and Mr. Beales for the corporation, Their LTonnsn'S gave leave to amend the bill, and directed the motion to stand over until Thusday next. STRONGE V VE ¢ce o ci-rum Crfipinus.-This case after tho Lord Justices had taken the trouble, or rather uiaergone the puratorial labour, of drawing the minutes with which all parties at the time expressed their satisfaction, again broke out on a notice of motion to vary those minutes. Mr. Malins and Mr. xL Archer Shee were counsel in sup. rt of the motion; and a full attendance of the Chancery C, among whom we noticed Mr. Swanston, Mr. WigrAn, Mr. WiUlcock, Mr. Elmsley, Mr. W. AL James, Mr. Lewin, Mr. Freeling, Mr. E. Smith, Mr. W. H. Harrison, and Mr. Toulmin, appeared for divers parties in the suit.

ZOQURT OFQIJER7S BFNCH, Wzs nUsRnL MtAy9 MANSELL V. THE QUHIN (IN ERp6vl- (Sitingstzn Banco, before Lord CiMPBXLL, and Justices WIGHMA., 1RLB, and CpOON.pTOx 'lhO plaintiff in error in this case had been tried before Mr. Baron Bramwell at the last winter assizes, held at Maidstone, for the wilful murder of Alexander MlBurney, and, on conviction, judgment of death as pronounced upon him. In the early part of the present term he was brought into this court on a writ of hasw, corpu to asg,n error on the record, and, this being done, it was ordered by thg Court that he should be brought up this day, in order that the errors might be argued, and in the meantime that ho should be confined in the gaol of Newgate, At the sitting of the Court this morning the prisoner was accordingly brought up in custodY, and, as on the previous occasion, he was allowed to sit by his counsel during the rgment. The proceedings being of an unusual character the court was densely crowded, not only by the general public, but also by an unusual number of members of the junior bar. Mr. Welsby and Mr. Ribton appeared for the Crownn, and Mr. F. Russell and the Hon. Mr. George Denman for the prisoner. As soon ha the case w called on, Mr. RUSSZL roS and said, this was a prooeeding by writ of error to revorse a judgment of death which had been passed upon Thomas MaSel, the plaintiffin error, for the wilful murder of Alexander M'Burney. The prisoner had beern t-ied both upon the indictment and the ooroner's in. qulsition, so that it would be oeey to roaa +hm both. The learned counsel then proceeded to read the record of the conviction and the indictment. It set out the commission of the judges, the fnding of a trae bill for murder, the prisoner's ploo of "Not guilty," the award of a jury of " good and lawfdul men of the country" to try the prisoner, and the panel of jurymen returned by thesheriff forteb purpose aforesaid, whose names were set out. It then stated that cerain names were called in the order in which they appeared in the panel, and when they came were perempto. rily challenged by tho prisoner; and that three others were called in their order, andwere "elected to be swvon." The next who was called did not answer, and the next ws chatL lenged by the prisoner. The next called was William Iron. monger, and when he came Mr. Ribton, the cennrae for the prosecution, prayed that he (Ironmonger) might be ordered to "s tand by.' Mr. Rusell, the counsel for the prisoner, prayed that if the counsl for the prosecution oallenged the juryman he should challenge him forthwith, and show, the cause of chbllenge forthwith, and that by the lao-f thoe relm he (Ironmonger) ought not to be ordered tostand by. The Coiut, however, ordered and adjudged that Iron. monger should stand by. The next who wa called came and was elected to be sworn, Several other jirymen were in like manner ordered to stand by, and other were elected, maing the number of the jurymen thus elected to be sworn amount to nine.

Because it Sp-Re ed that the said Jurymen were ordered to " stand by," whereas the Court had no power to make such an order, which i,s unknown to the law, vague, and uncertain, and at any )ate ought not to have been made till they had been challenged, though the Crown might not be bound to showr the cause of challenge fortwith. 3. Because, after all 'the names of the jurymen in the panel had been called, omitting the 12 who were locked up, and only nine were elected, and the l w begun again by telling the name of Wiia monger seond time, he was agan ordered to stand by, though he ought to have been sworn4 4.

Ir therefore prayed that the judgmuent might be reversed Upon this thiere wasa&joinder in error by lilt.i Robinson, the coroner and attorney for the Queen in this court. The learned counsel then read the assignment of error upon the coroner's inqustion. -Mr. Welsby said that if he failed upon the indictment, he should not reply upon the inquisition. Mr. RUSsEL said, the principaIgzievanoe of the prisoner was that several of the jurymen who were called had been improperly set aside, and prevented from being sworn. If so, there was error in the record ("1 R. v. Edinonds." 4 B. AId. 471); so also, if a challenge wa v mproperly refused. Lord CAMPBELL.-You don't say that there was anyI irregularity tia William Ironmonger was called the second tilme? Alr. RUSSELL said he Qid. Lord CABrEnx said that in al the beoks of authority it appeared the Crown had power to challenge without cause, or to order the juryman to stand aside till the panel had been gone through. Mrb RUSSELL said that if the power existed it had not been properly exercised iu this case. When the prisoner had pleaded the whole panel was gone through, omitting the names of the 12 jurymen who were locked up. Some of the jurymen called were absent, others were challenged by the prisoner, nine were elected to be sworn, and others were ordered to stand by. They then began the panel again, and called WilLam Ironmonger, and when he appeared he was told to stnd by. Hle contended he ought have been sworn, unless the Crown showed good cause of challenge. The learned counsel then cited the 6th of George IV., chap. 50, which adopted the words of the 31st of Edward i, stat. 4 which enacted that, "notwithstanding it be alleged by them that sue for the Ring that the jurors of those in. quests, or some of them, be not indifferent for the King, yet such inquests shall not remain untaken for that cause; but if they that sue for the King will challenge any of thAee jurors, they shall assign of their challenge a cause certain, and the truth of the same challenge shall be inquired of according to the custom of the Court." The learned counsel cited several authorities, including Hale's History of tae Co monLawo, toshowthatthisstatute waspaesedto corrwtabuse. He contended the Kinghad no right of peremptory challenge* but, according to the numerous authorities which he cited, when once the panel had been gone through the Crown was bound to show cause of challenge. Iu the case of " The Queen v. Geach" (9 . and P., 499) Mr. Baron Parke held that the Crown might challenge, without showing causa of challenge, till the panel had been gone through ' When could the panel be said to be gone through, or perused? According to the authorities, it was when the panel had been gone through the first time, when all the available jurors were dispo'ed of From that time the Crywn must show cause of challenge. Lord CAmPirxLL said, he did not suppose it would be dis. puted that cause must be shown when the panel was gone through. Mr. WEUSY said he should contend that in this case the panel had not been gone through. Lord CAMrPBELL said it would be very proper to show what going through the panel was. Mr. RUSSELL cited several authorities, including "Reg. v. Geach," to show that the panel was gone through or perused when aU the names were called over. The learned counsel then contended that when William Ironmonger was called the second time the panel had been perused. There was then no full jury. There were 12 out of court, but they were excused by the Court, and given into the custody of the sheriff till they had agreed on their verdict, and could not lawfully separate. Therefore, as soon as the panel was begun again the Crown was bound to show cause of chal. lenge. The case was the same as if, at that moment, the prisoner had demurred. Lord CArnnPB.LL said, there was no peremptory rule of law that jurors should be called in the order in which they were in the paneL In Frosfts case his counselobjected t their being so called. Mr.RUSSELL, said that in this case they did not wait for the absent jr, but they treated the panel as gone through, and began it again. He contended that if the Crown could adopt the course followed in this case it would have the power of selecting what jury it pleased, and in times of political excitement such a power would be most dangerous. It appeared that by the common lawr a prisoner could peremptorily chalenge 35 jurymen henthejurypanelusuallyonly contained 4.& (B Ar., tit. "Jury,' 2,9.) Norr, his challengeswere reduced to 20, whle the number on the jury panel was increased some. times to 200 and SO0, and tbe Crown could set aside all Lord CAIUPnEiL.-That cannot alter the law. Mr. RUSSELL said he thought it was a reson why the Court should not put a liberal construction upon it. According to the Norman law there was no challenge except for cause; and by the Roman law each side had the same power. Lord CEAMPBELL said that could have nothing to do with the question. By the law of Scotland the judge could, at one time, select any one from the panel and put him on the Mr. Ru SSLL said it was a hippy thing that such alaw did not prevail in England. Lord A=BELL.-And I rejoice that that law has ben altered. Mr. R7SSELL trusted that the Court would bear in mind that the power contended for would be exercised not only before the judges, but in all the courtb of quarter sessions, and before all the recorders of boroughs. Suppose the c of an indictment for libel in a town where party spirit Tan high. The attorney for the prosecution would be as eager to get a conviction as he would be to get a verdict for his client. The learned counsel then contended that the words " ordered to stand by" in the record had no definite legal meaning, and that it ought to have been staeed that the juryman was challenged. Mr. Jus6tice CnOaMPTO.-I * mere irregulaZity a ground oemrro? --r. RUSSELL cited a case where it was said to be eror to excuse an old man of 80 who appeared. Lord CAmPBELL said if that cas wer law it would alter the whole criminai law of the country. suppos ar juryman stne blind, or deaf ; was he not to be excused?

His Lordship added that to take the names in order was a convenient ourse,b a d . viation from it was no ground of error Mr. RUSSELL, with respect to Jabez Plapott, contended that when he had been elected to be sworn hie ought not to bave been told to withdraw. The counsel for the crown prayed that he might " stand by " but if that we taken to be a challenge it came too late, after he h been elected to be sworn.

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WESInUNMSIR, MAY 2. mne uourt ttus morning only sat a few minutes for motions, the learned judges havng to sit in the Court of Criminal Appeal. (&Uings at AYisi Priss, at Waesmin8ter, before Ar. Juetiec WILLIAMS and a Common Ju7ry.) As it was found impossible to dispose of all the cases entered for trial at the second sittings this term, Mr. Justice Wiliams consented to hold a third, or rather an adjourned sitting, for Middlesex; and, in accordance with such arrangement, the Court sat at 10 o'clock this morning., HOLLOWAY V. KELLY. Mr. BoviU, Q.C. and Mr. Petersdorff appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Laxton were counsel for the defendant. The plaintiff is a musicseUer and publisher in Hanway. street, Oxford-street, and the defendant keeps a small shop for the sale of cheap literature at 120, Gray's-inn-lane; and this action was brought to recover damages for the alleged piracy of a certain melody contained in a song called " Shells of Ocean; or, I Wandered on the Sea-beat Shore." The plaintiff in his declaration charged the defendant with having infringed his copyright in the aforesaid melody by printing, publishing, and having in his possession certain versions of that song set for the concertina. It apeared from the evidence of Mr Holoway, hr. Cherry, the composer of "Shells of the Ocean," and other witnesses caUed both for the plaintiff and for the defendant, that the copy. right in " Shells of the Ocean" had been originaly dissed of to Mr. HoUoway for a gninea and a ha1l; that he had sold about 3,000 copies of it arranged for the voice at 2s. 6d. and for the concertina at Is. Gd. each, and that the value of such copyright was now at least 1,OI. ; that Mr. Kelly, the defendant, had sold his arrangement of the melody, printed on slips of paper about three inches square, at a penny a copy, and had realized in two years by the sale somewhere about ninepence; that when he found that the plaintiff objected to his selling his penny versions of "Shes of theOcean" he sent him all the copies which he had left, and that a man named Fortune, from whom the defendant had bought them at his door, caUed upon the plaintiff and deliv d t at from which these impressions had bee d up ah number of such impressions. The evidence adduced to show the damage sustained by -the plantiff was somewhat contradictory. Mr. HoUoway -aid that the plate looked as if 3,000 copies had been struck off; but a music printer who was called catiniated the nuimber at about 1,500 or 2,000. Mr. Holloway was of opinion that it a good song were performed in the streets -such performance damaged the sale of the expensive and accuarate editions, Mr. Purday, however, the music-pub. lsher, said that inquiries were often made after a song by persons who had heard it in the street, and that if an air was weU performed in the street it was an advantage to its *sale, The defence was that Mr. Kelly had bought the copies of the melody of " Shells of the Ocean" from Fortune, and that he knew nothing about the air being copyright; that he had sent Fortune, who was really the publisher to Mr. Holloway, had given up al the copies which he had to do so was disputed. his right The trial of this cause lasted during the whole of the day, and the jury found a verdict for the defendant.
COURT OF EXCHEOUER.-RA,MTJAV 7r.- o LAURIR V. WB3STF.R. (S&tini in B -Ir ni - lmr. LUsH moved that the trial of this cause should take place in Middlesex instead of Surrey, under the 182d section of the Common Law Procedure Act, 1852, which provides that the trial of a cause may bo ordered to take place in any county other than that in which the venue is laid. The affidavits on which the application was made showed that the plaintiff, having bought and paid for a farm of ,000 acres in Surrey, entered into a verbal arrangement with the defendant that they should work the farm together, under which the defendant was admitted into possession. This preliminary agreement was never carried anfy futher, and the parties having fallen out the defendant renuse to quigt, te farm, whereupon this action of eject. nent was brought,and the venaue necessarily laid in surry. s, oweer,the defendant was pursuing a course of ealng iththefarm which was likely to lead t-O its utter rui, ad terewasnot a pretence for a defence to the EVANS V.

Rule nits accordingly. NIW TRIAL PAPER.-VnSON V. MCoS. This was an action by a shipowner to recover damages from the charterer for not loading a cargo at Rangoon or Bassein pursnt to the terms of the charterparty. At tho trial m London before the Chief Baron, it appeared that en the arrival of the ship at the port of loading notice wvas given by the defendant's agent to fhe oaptain that there was DO0 possibility of as cargo being procured, coupled withs a .equea that he wzould at once proceed to one of three other ports, where a full cargo of gome sort wvould be guaranteec So hfim Tlaq capain, hQoFver, didw no5 adoj4 tsi sag- gestion, but adhered to his chiarter and lay at Bassein to the end of the lay.days, wben be took his departure. Under these oircumstances the Chief Baron told thejury that the question was the amount of damages, and left it to them to say whether the captain had pursued a reasonable course. The captain was justified in adhering to his charterparty but it was his duty to do the best he could and eara es much freight as he could for the benefit of all partiea. If be was satisfied that there was no cargo to be had at Bassein the question of damages would turn on the propriety of his conduct. The jury found for 500., which was about one-fifth of the claim of the plaintiff Afterwards a rule for a new trial was obtained by the plaintiff on the ground thatf the darnages vere too low. Mr. Hill appeared to show cause; Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Asplana were counsel for the plaintiff. The COURT, before the case nad proceeded very far, threw out a suggestion for a compromise. The damaRea awarded by thejury were too low, though it was clear that the plaintiff could not claim, as he did, a verdicb to the fuI anmount of the freight stipulated for. The parties had better agree to a verdict for 1,0001. rather than go down to a second trial. Subject to this suggestion the rule was ordered to stand over.
COURT FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF CROWN CASES RESERVED.-SAmRDAY. AjAy 2. T.i- QU EEN V. LEWIS. rresent,-XAC Lort VAstef Justice UOCxBURIN, Jutices COLERIDGE, CROWDER, antd WILLES, and Barons BRRAMIVIFT.T. In this case, whion was argued this day, where the prisoner was indicted for manslaughter, all the parties being foreigners and the vessel being foreign, and the cruelty having been exercised on board that vessel, the Court had taken time for considering whether this was an offence for which the prisoner could be tried at Liverpool, in which town the deceased had actually died. Mr. Justice WILLES to-day delivered judgment. The Court felt that had the death occurred at sea the case would not have been cegnizable in this country, and that the mere fact of the party not having died until he arrived at Liverpool did not alter the law, and therefore the conviction must be quashed. Conviction quashed. THE QUEFN V. GRAY. The prigoner was indicted for causing bodily injury dangerous to life with intent to murder. The facts were that the prisoner had left her infant child in a wet and cold field, intending it should die. When found, some hours afterwards, there was congestion of the lungs caused by the exposure in the field, and it would soon have died had it not been found. At the time the prisoner left the child she had not caused any bodily injury to it. The prisoner was found guilty of causing bodily injury dangerous to life ,with intent to murder it, but a question was reserved by Mr. Justice Erle whether the conviction could be supported. Mr. Couch appeared for the prosecution. The prisoner was indicted under the 7th of Williaaa IV and the 1st of Victoria, chap. 85, sec. 2, which enacted that, where any person should administer poison, or should stab or wound, or should by any means cause bodily injury dangerous to life with intent to commit murder, such person should be guilty of felony. He submitted that, where a party did an act with intent to kill, and bodily injury arose from that act, that brought the csse within the statute. The CouRT seemed inclined to think that there maust be an intention to cause an immediate bodily injury-was not this more an intention to commit murder ? Mr. CoucH submitted that tbe p atting the child in the field was the same as inflicting a bodily injury, because the lugs became congested in consequence of that act. 'Te COURT said the case was so important that they should take time to consider. THE QUEBN V. FITCH. The prisoner was indicted for stealing a bonnet and a pair of goloshes. It appeared that the prisoner lodged with one Reeves andhi4swite, and it was arranged between the prisoner and Mrs. Reeves that they should leave the house and live together in adultery. The prisoner left the house, and afterwards went to his work; the wife then took a bandbo: containing her bonnet and goloshes, and went from the house and joined the prisoner. They were followed, and the prisoner was found carrying the bandbox, and he was apprehended for stealing the contents. He was tried before Mr. Justice Erle and convicted, but a point was saved as to whether this was a larceny. Mr. To=r appeared for the prisoner, and submitted that this was not such a taking as to constitute a larceny, and that the goods being the clothes of the wife, which she was taking for the purpose of wearing, were not the subject of larceny. The COUBT considered it was not a larceny. Conviction quashed. THE QUEEN V. SHEWOOD. This was a case tried before Mr. Justice Willes, The prisoner was chargedwithobtaining moneyb false pretences, the false pretence being as to the quaatity of coals delivered bg him to one Phcbe Smith. The facts were these, that on the 24th of December Smith asked the prisoner to sell her a load of coals which he then bad. He refused, but said he would fetch her a load and deliver itat 7d. per cwt. andhe fetched and delivered to her aload which tohis knowledge weighedl4 cwt., but he represented it to her to weigh 18 owt., and he produced the ticket from the wharf stating such to be the weight. Smith paid him for the 18 cwt. The question was reserved whether this case was a false pretence. Mr. K1LZE appeared for the prisoner, and urged that this was only a misrepresentation as to quantity, which was not punishable; if it were, any misrepresentation would be a false pretence. The CHIEF JusTiCc.-Wlhy should It not be; it would be a very salutary application of the law,-it would be a most fortunate thing. There is, however, a case in point; but I doubt very much whether at that time the subjoct had received so much consideration as it since has, or the judges would not so have decided. We are here, however, only five, and therefore it will be better that the case should be argued before the 15 judges. THE QUEEN V. "Y. This case was tried before Baron Bramwell. The prisoner was tried for stealing a Post-office letter and a watch it contained. It appeared that one Thomas Jones had bought a watch; as he had some fault to find with it he sent it back again, and then the prisoner, representing himself to be Thomas Jones, wrote to the watchmaker directing him to send the watch, addressed to Thomas Jones, at a certain post-office in the country. The prisoner went to that postoffice, and stating that the person who was with him was Thomas Jones, requested the postmaster to deliver such a letter to that person when it arrived. The letter and watch were in consequence given to that person. It was objected on the trial that this was not a stealing but a false pretence, and that point was reserved. Mr. M'Entyre now appeared for the prisoner. The CHIEF JuSTICE asked if any one appe;red for the Post-office, whioh had prosecuted at the trial It was stated that no one appeared. The CurEr JUSTICE said this wasa Post-office prosecu. tion, and considering that this was an important question, and that a great wrong had been done to the public, he must ssy that the Post-office had been guilty of a great derelection of duty in not appearing here to-day; but the Court would take time to consder its decision. THE QUEEN V. TOOLE AND OTHERI. Mr. BuSHBY said the question raised here was, whether the Christian name of the prosecutor had been properly proved. The only evidence was the production of the deposition, which a policeman said the prosecutor, Lieutenant Bent, had signed " Thos. Bent" in his presence. r. Bushby contended that the depoition was not ad. nmssble, and, if it had been, the evidence of the policeman was parol evidence of the contents of a written instrnmnt and therefore ought not to have been admitted. uev The urE JUTIC sad thre as o dubtthe evidence was properly admitteEd.,-Cotnvrctirovnasffiormed.otteeiec THE QUEN V.

He wvas opposed by Mr. Sturgeon on behalf of a creditor named Priest, who hadc brought an actiol against hin for false impisonment and recovAra4- !! damages. Mr. Sargood supported. The chief point of inquiry was the disposition of property. The insolvenT swore that in February last, being indebted to persons named M'Adam and Collinburn, they pressed him for payment, and the former having paid Collinburn's demand ne (the insolvent) sold him all his cows and utensils for 861. MrAdam's original debt was 401., for money lent on various occasions. Mr. M'Adawn (who had been out of court during insolvent's examination) was then called.

Mr. Commissioner PuLLirs said, after those DaErant contradictions, it wag useless to continue the case. 'ihere was most abominable perjury resting between the insolvent and M'Adam, and he (the learned Commissioner) doubted whether he ought not to order them to be indicted.

POLICE. MAwsioN-EouS.-William Cockburn w charged, con. jointy with Mr. John Lawson, with having wilftlly conspired and combined to injure the BRak of London in their reputation and character of bankers. The flrstnamed defendant was charget- inthe early part of the week with the same offence, and the case was adjourned to secure the attendance of the other defendant, Lawson. Mr. Bodkin prosecuted - Mr. Wontner appeared for Mr. Cockburn, and Mr. Metcaife for Mr. Lawson .Mr. Bodkin reiterated the circumstances of the case, which were, that certain lbellous articles had appeared in a paper caled the Joint-Stock Companie' Tournal, and said he should be able to show that the defendant Cockburn was the proprietor, and empoyed persons to distribute the Jour-a containing the libels, and it would be proved that proofs of the artioles had been corrected by Mr. Lawson and afterwards returned to the printer for the purpose of being struck off, and his handwnrting upon some portions of the proofs would be spoken to by the witnesses. Mr. Bodkin contended that the conductors of the Journal had not been aotuated by boicdflde intentions, and that their object, after having tailed in establishing an illegal claim against the bank, was to extort money from them. He should prove that the defendants had acted constantly together, and give such evidence as would justify the Lord Mayor in sending the case before a superior tribunaL Mr. Paul Graham, of the firm of Graham and Co., printers, New-street-square, was then sworn, and said,-From De. cember, 1855, to about May, 1856, we printed the rointStock Companie' Journal forthe parties who started it, and from that date for others up to April last. Mr. Ransom first started the Journal, with ahMr. Campbell, whom I afterwards knew as Mr. Meazies. I printed the paper for them 9 or 10 months. During that time Mxr.

He said he was not the proprietor, but that he was eugaged as mnanager. I was to gpaid by him. He paid me for print. mig the paper. Mr. Lawson has been at my offlice. The leading artcles were generally brought by 2r. Cockburn. I have seen Mr. Lawson correct his proofs in writmn Th were printed slips of articles that were afterwardssertb The manuscripts were always sent away with the proofs, unless Mr. Cockburn took them away when Mr. Lawson did not come. Mr. Cockburn and Mr. Lawson sometimes came together. The proofs were afterwards burnt. Mr. Cockburn came two or three times a-week, Mr. Lawson on; about once a-week, and sometimes he would slip a week. I merly set up the type; the paper was printed elsewhere. I knew Mr, Lawson as Mr. Lawson. r heard the name of Williams upon one occasion, but I do not think Mr. Lawson knew of it. I called him by his proper name one dav in the office, upon wbich MIr. Cockburm checked me, and said, "I don't want the men and boys to knowhim by that name; call him some other name-call him Mr. Williams." After that I called him Mr. Williams, when I had occasion to mention the name to Mr. Cockburn. Mr. Lawson was not' aware of this. Mr. Cockburn gave me advertisements to insert in manuscript and in print. Mr. Cockbura called upon me on Thursday last ; he saw some copy on the stone, and said, "1 I hope you have not got any of my copy here; I don't want it to go into other hands." I told him I did not think I hbad any. I told him that Spittle, the officer, had previously caled, and that I had given him some envelopes Cross-examined by Mr. Wontner.-.Mr. Lawson made no concealment about his name. I always addressed him as Mr. Lawson, and he always answered to that name. It was about Christmas when I alt saw him. I do not think it is so long as ix months ago. I should not like to swear that he ever took any copy away fromtho office himself. I never received any money Irom him. Mr. Cockburn was my em. ployer. All that Mr. Lawson did was to correct the slip4 and he has not been since Christm t Re-examined by Mr. Bodkmn.-Since last Christmas Mr. Cockburn has taken the sllps away. I do not know who wrote the articles. Sometimes Mr. Cockburnhas brought tha slips back corrected, and sometimes unaltered. I do not know whose writing the alterations in the proofs were. I have seen bIr. Lawson correct slips at our office. His corrections have been very diffierent from his copy-different from his writing in general, as sometimes we had bad pens at the office. Mr. Isaac Argent.-I am a printer at No. 3, Falcon. court, Fleet-street. I printed the last number of the Mnt-oc) Companies' Jourral. Mr. Cockburn, who employed me, furnished me with the manuscript for the publication of the 18th of April. I have had the type set up for another number, which has not been published. hMr. Cock. burn furnished me with the matter for that. Since the last bearing a Mr. Henderson called and took away all the copy. Spittle, the officer, afterwards called, and I searched and found a slp of a corrected proof. I do not know when the alterations in it was made, but it were taken away by Mr. Cockburn, and was afterwards brought back by him and pri-nted. Frederick Simms.-I was in the employment of rr. Cockburn for about nine months. I used t goto the banks and insurange-offices in the city and at the West-end to deliver copies of the JointStock Companic& Journal. Mr. Cockburn sometimes gave them to me, and sometimes I got them from the machine-room in Cursitor-street. I delivered 97, 84, and 104 copies in a day. I know 'Mr. Lawson by sight. Mr. Cockburn used to send me to Mr. Graham's to see if the proofs were ready, and when I got them I delivered them to Mr. Lawson. I told him I was to wait for an answer. Mr. Lawson used to take the proofs out of the letters and return them to me. I then returned them to the printer. I went Tvith proofs to Mr. Lawson four or five times, the las time being tour or five weeks ago. I have seen the defendants together on severnl occasions. Sometimes I used to carry Mr. Cockburn's pocketbook. (Laughter.) Mr. Cockburm sometimes called upon lMr. Lawson for the proofh and he brought them out and gave them to me, and I returned them t the printer. I have left a great number of the JTurnal of the 18th of April at different places. I told Mr. Cockbumn that the people at the London Joint-Stock Bank had desired me not to bring any more, upon wbich he said I was to tell them that I was to leave them without being paid for them. Mr. Cockburn told me upon the day on which I was taken into custody to carry 100 papers. He swung a placard round my neck at the Royal Exchange, and told me to walk up and down Threadneedle-street, and to go into the banks and try to sell the papers. He told me if any policeman came up to me and ordered me to move on I was to go on a little way and to return again. He said if a policeman came and threatened to take me into custody I was to tell him I didn't care, for he would soon come and fetch me out of prison. I had sold a good many coples of the paper before I was taken into custody. I gave 56. lOd. that I received for papers to Mr. Cockburn. I re. member a gentleman asking Jar. Cockburn, when he was puttig the board round my neck, if what was printed on the Brit.s an. he sa it was quite as trae as that about Mr. Francis Palmer.-I am clerk in the secretary s oflice of the Bank of London. Mr. Cockburn has frequently been to our office and applied for advertisements for Ihis Journn, but they were never given to him. I told him that we never gave them out, and that all our advertisements were sent to our advertinug agents. He has frequently called on the same errand, and has asked me to let him see Mr. Scot the manaer of the bank, as the advertising agent would not give him advertisements without our authority. He saW Mr. Scott upon only one occasion. I afterwatds refused to let him see him. I told him there were positive orders that he should not have our advertisements. He then offered me tickets for the theatre if I would get his name put on the list for advertisements. I refused to do anythin of the kind. Sometimes he asked for a prospectus, aLd sometimes for a report. Cross-examined by Mr. Metcalfe.-The placard refers to the retirement of 140 shareholders. That statement is un. true. They did not all retire. Some of them have died, and their shares are in the names of their executors ; others have sold their shares. A hundred and thirty shares have been bought by 90 others. Re-examined by Mr. Bodkin.-The persons who have retired have sold their shares to other persons who have bought them. Every share is represen by a proprietor. The LoRD MAYOL-Every share has an owner? Witness.-Every share has an owner. Mr. Henry Colyer, bookseller of 39, Cornhill, said, -I did not give any authority to Mr. Cockburn to insert my name as publisher of the Joint-Stock Oomrannies' Joutna, nor for letters or communications to be left at my office. John Muir.-I live at 274, Strand, and am an engineer a labourer. I am not the publisher of the Tointfot Covnpanies' Journal. The statement therein contained that itis printed and published by me is untrue, Mr. Alexander Colvin.-I am seoretar to the British Exchequer Life-office. I have seen Mr. Cockburn once or twice. Upon one occasion I hada conversation with hit t-er-e ; tL.Br J?va-owck Vonmpanies' Journal. I met him at the Merchants' and Tradesmen's Life-offlce, and in the course of conversation with Mr. Thompson and myself he stated that they were supplied with funds for the gratuitous distribution of copies of the Journal among the directors and officers of the Bank of London, the National and Provincial Assurance-office, the Falcon Life-offlce, and generally, as J understood bin,, in any quarters in which it might be thought destrable to circulate it. He did not mention the quarter from wrhich the funds were supplied. Some general conversation occurred respecting the paper, and Mr. Thompeon and I both said we thought the articles unfair I have received copies of the Jvroi-na for months past with. out any charge being made for them. I never ordertd themv. MIr. Bodkin here asked for a remand. Mr.Wontner.-On the part of Mr. Lawson, I make no ob- jection to his re-appearing here. He appears on a summons to-day, and he is anxious that the case should be fully investigated. He denies his connexion with the article com- pilned of, and I thin]k I shall be able to convince your Lord. ship on a subsequent oocasion that really there is no ground whatever for asserting that he has been a party to any con. spiraoy to defraud the bank. Mr. Bodkin.-We don't charge him with any conspiracy to defraud the bank; we charge him with conspiring to try and damage its reputation. The further hearing of the charge was then postponed, and the defendanSs entered into their recognizances in 100. each to attend on a subsequent occasion. GPDnA..-John EHind MAy, a man about 30 years of age, described as a commission agent, residing at 126, Stanley.street, Pimlico, was charged with obtaining a quantity of cambric handkerchiefs, value 5001., the property of Mr. Alexander Lawson, a manufacturer of Lurgan, in the county of Armagh, Ireland, under false and fraudulentpr tences. He wad also charged with obtaining by siml means a large quantity of cambric handkerchiefs, to the value of 6001., with intent to defraud Mr. Thomas Gor. man, also a manufacturer of Lurgan. William Taylor, who called himself an agent, carrying on business at 1, Church. pah Gresham-street, was also charged with conspuiing with May and others to defraud Mr. Gorman of the goods in question. ie f omas Gorman said that he was a cambric handkerekief maker and had given instructions to Taylor to sell a large paree of handkerchiefs, allowing him 23 per cent. commission. When he returned to Ireland he recei-ved a letter from Tailor, saying that he had found & purchaser for the handkerchiefs in the person of May. From inquiries Made by thq witnvess lib was indued to devlln may as a purchaer. Taylor afterwards wrote and said that Messrs. Myer and Co. would purchaee the articles, and the were good for 10,0001. This offer was accepted, and th hdkerchief were ent off, in pursuance of instructions. The invoice, amounting to 893i &a 6d., less 27 peA et disoun, aoune4,to 245g. 1Sg. 10d., leaving a balance of 647Z. 14.Sd. tA. check for lU0a. from Messrs. Myers and Co. was then forwarded to witnew, by Taylor, which was cashed by an acquaintanca of Taylor in Ireland. Witness then came to London, and discovered that the goods had been sold to Mr. Meekinz, the draper of Holborn-hilLhat a pnce much below what they were worth, and Taylor alleged that Mlay ha come while7he was out, and had takenL tho goods away and sold themto Meeking. Alderman HuPi yERY.-The case is simply this Taylor gets you to sell these goods to Myers and Co. because you would not let MAy haTe them, and Taylor afterwards writes to acknowledge the arrival of the goods, and sttes that the were delivered to Myers nd Co., when, in fact, they had been previously sold to 3eeking for about onethird their value, and to whom they were delivered. It was sated for the defeno that an explanation of the transaction would bo given, and it would be proved that the foods were properly sold to Myers and Co., and that the 00. was rlceived from Myers, who was a man of great erTman Humpmy.-It must be shown that Myers really did buy these goods and the invoices mnst bep ro. duced, to satisfy me that Taylor Was acting as the agent of Mtcr in the purchase of the goods frorn Mfr. Gorman. John Woodward, a buyer in the employ of MIessrs. Meekcing, proved that he had purchased these handkerchiefs from MIay and his traveller, Jirry. The goods were paid for by two checksonJoneeLoyd and Co., cro6s2d to the Union From the evidence of Jrry it appeared that the two checks were paid in to the Union Bank to May's account, and Jarry received a commn2ison amounting to LU. out of the transaton. Witnes had seen aninvoice to Myers and Co. lyigon the desk in MAy's office; he had also paid a check to Myers forMay amounting to 501. May carried on business as May and Co., but he did not know who the company was. He had often seen Myers at May's office, but he was not assistig In the business, though he sometimes looked over the books. Mr. Morgan, on behalf of the prosctor, here uaked for a remand. Alderman HimirPay said he should require two hal in 2SLeachforTaylor,andhisown recogizanco in 500, to appear again on riday next. He should also require the sam e b'a for May. Bail was then offered nd accepted for Taylor, but the ball offered for MfIay not being satisactory, he was conveyed to Newgate in the rison van. Mr. Morgan en asked for a snmmons against Myers, and stated that he had some direct evidence against him. Alderman HusPzmy sadd he would not at present grnt the summons, but Mlers might be requested tolattend at the nexthearing andif£e refrsed then asummonswould be granted. ThEDLsONE.-William Cooke was cbarged with having urgiariouly entered the house of Mr. Herriott, 28, Crw. of ladies' boots, value 404 ndstolentherein 88 pairs ,ho had no defence tomake, was committed o atteCentral Criminal Court Three men named William Chamberlain, John Huff, and Willam Huff, were brought up on remand, charged with having indecently assulted two young girls, and also with assaults on officers of ne D division ot polEce. Mr. Herring attended for the prisonera. The particulars of what previoualytranspired have already appeared. There was no additional evidence of any impor- t . Allen, pro.ecuting officer of the A ssociate Institution for Improving and Enforcing the Laws for the Protection of Women, was present to watch the case. The Magirirate sent the prisoners for trial; but consented, npon the application of Mr. Herring, to take bail for their being forthcoming at the sessions. WonsSr-Svxmlr-John Townshend, an umbrella. maker in Sing Edward-street, Mile-end, was charged with the foUowing brutal assaults upon his wife. The wife's story was a very melancholy one. She hid been married U years to the prisoner, and during nearly the whole time he had iUtreated her, both day and night, so that she was scarcely ever without marks and bruises upon her. He had severa times sworn he would take her life, and pulled out a knhfe from his pocket to her in the street, she escaping by running away. She was in such constant dread or hun that she was obliged to hide herself, for fear he should find and kill her, which she knew that ho would do at some time or other. Numerous assaults were now detalled against him in sucoeson,he upon one occasion, without provocation, striking her three times in the face, and injuring her badly; a day or two after this he beat her so shamefully that she mustered up courage to apply next day for a summons against him; on being served with this he determined to prevent her appearing, if he could, threatened to be hung for her, and to '3settle" her, if she did appear, and surlily told her to get his tea ready. She had no tea, as he had given her no money, and, seeing him about to iMuse her again, she ran into the cellar, to escape from him. He pursued her with the leg of a wooden stool in his hand, although she had her infant in her arms, and struck her several heavy blows upon the head and face with the stool-leg, till the blood poured down her and her head, as she said, was covered with lumps; and struck at her with such heedless vindictiveness that one of his blows fell on the infant, and made its nose bleed. Storer, a constable of the H division, deposed to hearing the woman's screams on this occasion, and on getting into the house saw the prisoner rush downstaira after his wife with the leg of the stool in his hand; but, though he followed him mmdiatel;3, he was too late to prevent him attascdng her and strikug the infant, both of whom were bleeding, and he only succeeded in saving her from further immsage. Rosetta Owen, the wife's sister, stated that she was fetched by a boy to the house, and on reaching it saw the prisoner strike his wife across the mouth with a stick, and' oUlow this up -with other blows. She got between them, to save her sister, and waa herself in consequencm struck by him on the head, as she was also beaten and kicked by him upon another occasion on interposing ins similar manner "He is a dreadful man," said the witness; "heisofaver; bad temper; illuses his chlldren and iUses his wife, whom he has often threatened to murder, and uses her so shame. fully that I am afraid to leave her alone with him more than I can help." Another constable, and Gee, the warrant-officer, also deposed in a similar strain, both of them knowing that the prisoner had brutally used his wife and family for a long time past. Mfr. HAmnL hardly knew which to select as the worst case out of the number of this kind that had been brought beforehim, but this was cerainy as bad as any, if not the worst, for a greater monster than the prisoner he had not seen. He could only repeat his determination to use his eat efforts to stop such rutslity as far as the law enabled him to doseo, and he should therefore inflict on the prisoner the full amount of punishment he could, which was, six montha' hard labour in the HIouse of Correction, and on the expiration of that he must find good and approved bail for a further term of the same duration. TEAmFA-Henry Hills, aged 50, was brought before Mr. YARDLL?y charged with criminally assaulting Anna Stamp, aged 10 years, and also with indecently assaulting Louisa 'idman, aged 13 years, and several other girls. Mr. Joseph Smith, solicitor, defended the prisoner. The investgation was one of a most painful description. The prisoner has for some time filed the office of assistant clerk of the Poplar Union, and for a considerable period has performed all the duties of chief clerk, in cossequenoe of the illness of Mr. Symons, who holds that offlce. The prisoner was considered by the guardians of the union, his neighbours, and the parishioners generally of All Saints, Poplar, as a respecle, well-conducted, and moral man. The prisoner's wife and two daughters have for many year kept a day-school for girls, and the daughters of the most respectable tradesmeu and mechanics in the parish were among the pupils. The prisoner, who has made a full confession of his guilt, has contaminated in a greater or less degree nearly all his wife's scholars, and it was painful to see gO many intelligent, well-behaved girls, between the ages of 9 and 13, waiting to give evidence against the prisoner for grossly immoral conduct towards them. The depositions were formally taken by Mr. Bowdler, the second clerk, and the witnesses bound over to prosecute and give evidence against him. man; I deserve to be banged for what I have done." The prisoner had made preparations for a dight to America, and would have been away on Saturday afternoon if he bad not been arrested. SOrnTwARna-On Monday, the 13th ult., John Syer, a man employed by Sir Charles Napier's committee on the day of election to look after the cabs used to convey the electors to the polling-plaoes- was summoned by a cabman named Wise for refusing and neglecting to pay him 16s. for his day's work, he being hired by the defendant at the Three Tuna, near the Town-hall. hfr. Coara, after hearing the evidence at some length, ordered the defendant to py ythe 16s, and costs, but ayve hi aWek topay it in, at' the -sametime recommQendn Syer to apply to Sir Charles Napier's committee for the amount, and if that was not complied with to summon the parties to the County Court. There were also several Other cabmen similarly situated, and they were recmmended to do the same. On Saturday Wise, the cabmans attended before Mr. COIMnx for the amount of the fare and costs ordered to be paid by Syer, when he was informed that neither had been paid, and that Syer had been unable to get any satisfaction from Sir Charles Napier's election committee. Wise said it ws very hard upon him, ashe as a poor hardworking cabman, and wanted the money to support his family. He was employed constntly from 8 o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock in the afternoon conveying voters to the poll, besides rusbing about with some of the committee, and he had actually paid the tols out of his pocket, and now he could not get the money for his day's work. He s positive that if Sir Charles Nater were acqusinted with his case he would see him Mr. Congg told him he was satisfied thatSirCharles Napier's wish was that every one employed at his election sbould be justly deat with, but he did not think the settlement of such claims lay with him. The election agent was the party, and he laid his accounts before the auditor tobe psed, and as soon as that was done all parties justly entitled to anything would be paid. The cabman said he wanted the money, and he asked his worship what he had better- do under the circumstances. Byer was the man who engagel him, and he wna poor rm The committee, he thought, hwd acted disgraceiully towards him. Mr. COMiBE recommended him to communicate ith Syert and summoni the parties to the County Court. No doutbt he would be paid eventually.

THE BANK OF F4NCE ANflD THE NEW FRENO} LOAN. frm-- I ole Bank of France is one of the greatest commercial Institutions on record. It was established ia 1800 by the first Napoleon, aiid has therefore existed now upwards of half a century. It has had to contend against all the political changes and revolutions which have happened within that eventful period, and, being the bank of the State, and almost under the direct control of the State, it may naturally be supposed that it has been exposed to extraordinary coercions and temptations dangerous to its solvency and -credit. Dnuring the first 15 years of its existence the resources of France were drained to the dregs to sustain the great European conf'icts in which Napoleon was engaged, and during that period the Government was often pressed for aupplies for the military chests. On more than one -occasion the Bank of France had to witness all the French securities it held redeced to less than one-half of their original value. After a long interval it had to meet the -eiflculties of the Revolution of 18.30, sacceeded by more -than one period of severe commercial and monetary crisis, .similar to those which tho Bank of England encountered in 1837 and 1847. Next, it had to cope with the reckless and ttnscrupulous Provisional Government which ruled France in 1848, and to meet the serious difficulties of that and the following years. During the whole of that time, and throughout the whole of those political dangers, we are not aware that at any one moment the credit of the Bank of France was ever doubted, or that its solvency was ever in danger. It is true that in 1848 the Provisional Government authorized the Bank to saspend cash payments, and made its notes a legal tender throughout France; but, nevertheless, the Bank did not upon any one occasion avail itself of that authority. In every case in which its notes were presented for payment they were duly redeemed in cash, and at no one moment therefore did they stLffer the slightes' depreciation. These facts are conclusive as to the advan-tageons character of the constitution of the Bank, and -equally, or even more so, as to the prudence and ability of -its mnanagewent. Of later years the deepest depression in the affairs of the Bank of France was in 1849. In that year the total business of the Bank, in the shape of advances of every description, was reduced to 48,659,0001. In 1847, the year preceding the Revolution, it amounted to 74,15;5,0001. From that time tho increase of the transa -tions of the Bank has been -steady and rapid, and remarkable in amourt. In 1852 the amount of tho business was repre6ented by advances to the -extent of 95,800,001. In 1853 they rose to 155,500,0001. ; in 185O to 188,120,0001.; and in the last year to the enormous sum of 223,105,5761. In the latter year the amount -of bills discounted in Paris was 60,48:3,0001., and in the branch banks 116,302,6721., making together 176,'786,3921. Not only, howvever, have the transactions of the Bank of France risen to this unparalleled amount, but the gains have inereased in even agreater proportion, caused, no doubt, b the -high rates of interest which have been curTent t e last two years. In 1854 the gross profits amounted to 746,528I1.; in 1855 they reached 906,9641. ; and last year they rose to the extraordinary sun; of 1,350,5121. Of course these sums are subject to a certain deduction for the expense of management. The entire capital represented by the shares of the Bank of France is 3,600,0001., so that a dividend of between 20 and 25 per cent. has been paid with little difficulty upon the original value of the shares. It is under these circamstances that it is now proposed to double the amount of the existing capita, a course suggested by the obvious desirableness of having a broader basis of security for transactions of such magni"dude. That the operations of the Bank will continue to aincrease there can be little doubt; not, however, as a consequence of the increase of the capital, but as a -consequence of the further developnsent of the trade of the country. Taking, however, the condition of the B3ank as it now stands, what will be the immediate effect of this inorease of capital ? It is proposed that 3,600,0001. shall be subscribed and invested in French Rentes, which may -be done at a rate which will give about 4 per cent. interest. The only increase of profit which will be derived, therefore, from doubling tho capital will be a sum of 144,0001., to be added to the gross profits made in -the last year of 1,350,5721., while the number of shares and the amount over whiei the net profits will be divisible will be doubled-that is, it will be raised from a sum of -3,600,0001. to one of 7,200,0001. The effect will therefore be to reduce -the dividend upon the shares of the Bank of Yrance to little more than a half of the present rate; 'which reduced rate macy stiU, however, be computed at -about 12 penceut. Theeriginal amoun' of the shares of -the Bank of France was 1,000f.. or 401. ; the new shares -are to be -issued at 1,1061., or 441., which will stUl give nearly 11 per -cent, dividend. Inasmuch, however, as the -new shares -are to be issued to tbe existing shareholders in proportion to the number of old shares vihich thssy usold, no inustice will be done by the low rate, at which they ThIe operation-on the part oof the G:overameat assumes * heformof aloan. The neweapital is tobe invested in -Three per Cent. Rentes at 4the price of the time, to be created and added to the present amount of the naational debt of -France. The direct effect will there.. fore be to takre out of the rmoney-mnarket 3,600.0001. -of foating capital towards the ordinary expenditure .of the -country -in -addition to Uh3 taxation of the year. A1t-is, in-fact, raisig a toan in thetkn.e of peace in order to pay the curent -expenditure of the year. The investmentt herefore, of this sum in Rlentes wi'l not, as has been sup. posed, be to imuprove th^e value of pmublic securities, hut to Whsn3inSh tem by the creation of so much more stock, and -to inrae the-severity of the pressura-for mnoney by with. Xdrawing that macaont *ro the capi6ei now applicable to business. It .appears, :therefore, that inasmuch as the sbarter of the present Bank of F?rance does not expire before -the 31st of Decemnber, 1867, full 10 years hseuce, the chief reason which has induced the Governmenttosoticipate that event and Sive a reneval now is in orderSio make it the *neans of raisn a loan of money, which would be regarded as more objectionable in the ordinary form, -but which in point of fact is the same thing. las the nrrue nent, how. ever, which is now made, the Government stipulates for a condition, the effect of which wilil 'ce that tlhe Bank of Frsnce will allowv. interest upou the Government deposits up to a certin amounut. This i8ito be effected in thle followring manner :-The bank is to make an advance to the Government upon Treasury Bonds to the amount of 3.30Q,0001., wvithout any charge for interest, exceputing for such portion vof the amount as shall be in exceas of the public balances from time to time; so far the Governmuent has made a good bargain for the public, 'lo the Ba3k of France, however, the arrangement is moat favoulrable. - his charter is to be extended by 30 yearsthat is, until the end of 1897. It is quite obvious from this proceeding that the Government has decided to follow out the policy which.hes been acted upon so much during the last seven years, and to extend the branches of the Bank of France so rito embrace the banking of tbe whole of Frat6ce, In that caethere can he no question that its operations .sut go on er;tending, so as in ai fewv years to give as larga a dividend upon the new amount of capital as it has re zent y dg o epresent amount. e
AMEICA. SOUTHAMPTON, MAY & ahe viYi'ea States! mail steamer Waishinglton, '0 ltatn jtAvendy, arrived off Oowes this afternoon with advices from New York to the 18th ult., being two 'days later than those received per Ariel. After disemnbarking her mails and passengers for South- it5pton, the Washington proceeded on to Bremen. Te Washington has had a veryboisterous passagehead winds nearly the whole distance. She brings 112 passengers, of wvhom 20 are for England, and about siloo,ooo for Eugrland, HEavre, and Bremen. The most important item of news by this atrival is the impending difficulty between the United States and the States of Central America. Late intelligence from New Granada informsus thatthe Commissioner sent to Bogota by the United States to negotiate a settlement of the difficulties springing out of tho Panama massacre of the 15th of April, 1856, and out of certain recent tonnage and postage laws of New Granada, had been unable to effect any result. Re submitted his v2timatl6m, which was rejected. Therefore he broke off the negotiations, and was on his retumn to the United States, to be followed immediately by the resident MIinister there, Mr. Bowlin. The Granadian journals seem to expect hostilities betwveen the two countries. A despatch from Washington, of the 16th, published in the New York Monwing gol,ress, says,- "The Granada diffliculties makethe leadingtopichere. The decision of our Government i such as had been anticipated, and its execution wll be as prompt as need be. There will be no tampering or temporizing, no petty intrigues or huckstering, but, vwith the immediate amval of our ships on the coasts of Now Granada, direct and peremptory steps wiUl be taken to vindicate the rights of our citizens, without regard to anything besides the duty of the Government in the protection of their individual safety. Our fleet upon both coasts will be concentrated off the Isthmus, and if the temper of the Granadians shall be persisted in we may realize a repetition of the formula with Mexico inthe last war. In the same maner in which we first conquered that country and then purchased as much of it as we desired,so the present movement may endin the seizure of the Isthmus of Panama by our fleet, and then its formal purchase for our use. The only detail of the plans determined on in this connexion that have transpired is as to the orders for concentratingthe fleet. On the Pacific the squadron comprises the Independence, the John Adams, the Decatur, and the steamer Massachusetts. The home squadron, which will he ordered to Aspinwall comprises the Saratoga (and Potomac, I believe), thme Siam, F?ulton, and Wabasa; Commodore Paulding havlng his fla on hoard the latter, nowv at New York unlder orders to saiL ' The New York Herald, in a very warlike article on the subject, observes:- "We begin to think that about enough has been done in the way of conciliation and compromise in the negotiations between our Government and the States of Central America. The attitude occupied by the Government of New Granada at last advices, and the conduct and langusee of the Costa Ricans, who have laid fordble hands on the main highway between the oceans in Nicaragua, appear pretty nearly to fillthe cup of our aggravation. Citizens of the one State massacre our people, refuse atonement, impend future enormities of the like Idnd; citizens of the other, for the sake of carrying on a war against neighbours with whom they have neverbeen able to agree, shut up one, and perhaps the most convenient, of our roads to omr PaCific possessions. We submit that this is earrying matters with a tolerably high haud. We have a treat,y with England and Nicaragua in reference to a free trannt route across that State. American ctizens, under the authority of their Government, have made a bargain with the Government of New Granada, which bargain that Government now tacitly refuses to keep. In both instances the Administration have ample grounds for active interference, should it be deemed advisable. We think the time has come for a little dealing in acts, not words. When we sent an expedition to Jepan, at the cost of no one knows how many hundreds of thousands to the country, Commodore Perry made a treaty which is very pleasant reading, being nicely worded, butwhich, in trubh, did rot secure for us the first shadow of a substantial concession. The English made a treaty too, but when trouble arose about its interpretation they simply sent a squadron into the principal seaport and cleared the decks. What was t;e coasequence? The Japanese came to their senses directly, and opened their ports to the English. In the abstract this style of acting seemsharsh and unjust; in practice it is humane and sensible. It is the policy we ought to practise towards the Spanish nations of Central and South America. All these petty nations have presumed upon their feableness to commit acts acd assert pretersions which we shoa'd hong ago have gone to war about had they been attempted by a Power like E1ngland. It is time that they should be taught that weakness can be no cloak for wrong." Thie Daily Times, on the contrary, counsels peacefull measures, believing itto be always safe, encircunistances like the pr esent, to predict othler than violent results: "The uZAZMWUM of Mr. Morse has been rejected. It has even been met with a counter claim Zor indemnity. The special envoy has sought his home in disgust; the envoy extraordinary is understood to follow hard behind. We have thus the elenrents of a very pretty quarrel, an orthodox casus te as clear as the worst of those di.putes in regard to which tne greatEuropeant Powers are apt to faU together by the ears. And yet there are Eo many dissuasives from a conafict upon any quarrel less than one involving natVonsl existence or independence that we shall be excused from believing in the war until we hear the first caunonade." The New York Legislature had not adjourned up to the latest dates. The Assembly had passed the Bill declaring in effecv that no slaves shall be bought within the boundaries of the State, thus nullifying as far as possible the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case. The Liquor License Bill received the signature of Governor King on the afternoon of the 17th ult., and is now a law. A despatch from Washington o f the 17th says,"Mr. Sayer this morning made a violent ptreet assault on Mr. George P. Herrick, in consequence of the latter's communication in the yew yo,,k Herald, commenting severely on Assistant-Secretary Clayton in connexion with the payment of Mr. Thompson's Indian claim. Mr. Sayer is a relative of Mr. Clayton. Mr. Denver this morning entered on his duties as Commissioner of Indian Affairs." By way of Mobile we have news from Havannah to the 13th ult. An attempt had been made to assassinate William Sydney Smith, the British Consul, on account, it is supposed, of his exposures of slave transactons. The general impression was that there would be no war between Spain and Mexico. A letter from Havannah of the 10th says,- "The trade iu slaves, both from China and Africa, was never more active, nor the circumstances attending it more melancholy. 1,822 coolies were landed from the 30th of March to the 8th of April, and 352 others perished on the voyage. Since April, 1855, 10,534 Asiatics arrived at the island, and the masters of the vessels acknowledge to a mortality at sea of 1,789." We learn from Chicago that, after the destruction of the settlement at Spirit Lake, the Sioux. Indians made an attack on Springfield, in the southern part of Minnesota, but were repulsed with a loss of about a dozen men. A detachment of 100 good troops pursued the Indians, but being without provisioA^s were compelled to return. " The announcement of the arrival of the steamer Arabia checked transactions in cotton, and sales were confined to a few hundred bales at unchanged prices, taken chiefly in store by Eastern spinners. The ne ws was not expected to produce any material effect, in the face of the intelligence coming to hand from the South regarding the decline in receipts.and the unfavourable weather, with reported injury from frost, &c.

NEWFOUNDLAND. --W (By ELno A IND f AarXFOzAL TrsaGRApj) LIVERPOOL, SUNDAY NIGoT. The screw steamship Cireassian has arrived, with advices from St. John's, Newfoundland, to the 24th nlt. She made the run from St. John's to Holyhead in 7 days 21 hours. The screw steamship Khersonese, hence, had arrived at St. John's. Unfortunately, the submarine telegraph was still out of order, or eight days' later advices would have been received by the Circassianfrom New York. Navigation in Canada may be said to have set in. The coast of NTewfioundland wras free from ice. The seal fisheries at Newfoundland had been very prosperous, vessels returning filled. The St. John's papers contaia despatches from 3Ir. Labouchere, under date Macrh 28, stating that the convention -with France respecting Newfoundland fisheries had fallen to the ground in consequence of its having been unequivocally refused by the colony. The expectea delegates to the Home Government have -therefore-abandoned the intention of coming to England. Governor Darling has, however, arrived with his friends in the Circassian.
THE DBSIBUCTION OF YOUNG SALMON. TO THEI EDrIOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-The publi have of late heard a great deal about the "artificW propagation of the salmon," as a means of checkug the greatly-to-be-lamented decrease of this favourite oj the epicure and the sportsman, and I have personally done something towards the promotion of this object, as it was at my instigation that the proprietors of salmon-fishings on the Tay constracted the artificial breeding-beds at Stor. mnontfield; but,whatever benefit has been or may be derived from the interference of art, this can only be supplementary to the processes of nature, carried on in the open streams, and the products of art must perish, in company with the children of nature, if the young fish, in whatever way generated, are stapidly and wantonmy slaughtered by millions in their infancy. I have been induced to address you this letter in consequenee of seeing heaps of young salmon exposed for sale in the fishmongers' shops of Cheltenham. They receive them from Wales, and sell them under the name of " peuks," at Is. 6d. per lb. The destruction of young salmon wholesale by nets for the fishmonger, and retaU throughout the year by anglers, is so prodigious that the wonder is not that salmon are scarce, but that they exist at all. I ascertained that the fishmongers of Cheltenham are liberally supplied with peuks aU the season, and anglers kill without wcruple as many of these little fish as they can in every salmon river in the kingdom. When a schoolboy I used to kill from three to six dozen of peuks every holyday during the fishing season, and if my successors are now less successful, it is only because there are fewer adult salmon, and consequently fewer young ones. Tnis was excusable in my school days, for our fathers held that peuks were a distinct species of fish, and that the true and only young of the salmon was the silvery smowt (Ang3ice smelt), which was only seen for six weeks in spring when on its way to the sea. Mais nous avons changd tou cela, and it is not more certain that boys and girls are the young of the human species than that peaks, parrs, and samlets (as they are indifferently called) are the younm fry of the salmon, which pass the first year of their life at least in their native streams. I will quote a few short notes made at Stormontfield in proof of this. On the 2d of l:ay, 1855, a committee of gentlemen visited the rearing-pond to report upon the state of the young fry, which were then fifteen months old, and, after a careful search, not a single smeolt could be found; the inhabitants of the pond were all clearly p. Yrs. The pond was revisited on the 21st of M-y, and number, of genuine smolts were then taken. On the 29th of May the sluice was opened, and about one half of the fish immediately departed, in the shape o. smolts, on their way to the sea; the other half remained a4 parrs for another year, and then took their departure in like manner. We took the precaution to mark many hundreds of the little fsh before letting them go, and the following is the size of one of them .-Length, 5 inches; circumference over dorsal fin, 2 inches; weight, half an ounce. On the 19th of July following the first marked fish was taken below Perth, having been absent 51 days; length, 24 inches - circamference over dorsal fin, 12', inches; weight, 5.Pib. So we see that if the 32 peuks, sold for is. 6a., had lived for six weeks longer they would have become salmon worth 51. in the market, supposing grilseto soll for Sd. per lb. ; and it is at this rate that the proprietors of salmon fishinas allow their property to be destroyed all over the kingdom, and throughout the year, without an effort to protect it. Routine is as fatal to fish as to men, and so torpifies the understanding that self-interest even is insafficient to stimulate people to take a single step in advance in a new direction, although by doing so "they may pull a b;t of silver out of the water," for such every salmon saved is to them. The conduct of salmon proprietors is as ratio zal as high farming, with the help of tile-drains, liquid manure, and steam-power, would be for the purpose of eating corn in the blade. It is useless to hope for reform in any direction till the peop ae eweUl informed on the subject in question; and f the other pap ers would be good enough to make the facts now mentionedt generally known they would probably be instrumental in stopping the certain decay of an important branch of national industry, which is fast hastening to esxtinction through mismanagement and ignorance.

THE MAnS. -SOUTHAMPTON, Saturday. -The Royal MadCompany's steamship La Plata, Captain Weler, sailed to-day with the West India, Alexican, and Pacific mails, specie value 36,1381., jewelry vo'lue 9,2001., and a full general cargo. She takes out 77 passengers, among whom are Dr. Hernandez, for St. Thomas; Major Bovill, Lieutenant Furlong, Lieutenant Macaulay, lieutenaat Blanchard, for Jamaica; Captain Simpson, for Trinidad &c. Inteligence of the safety of the Australian Mail stea-ner Oneida was received here by telegraph from London this morning, and was immediately posted at the Company's offices, the Electric Telegraph office, and the newspaper establishments. Thegratifying news spread like wildfire through the town, and soon dispelled the gloomy forebodings as to the fate of the vesseL 'which had been daily gaining strength, most of the officers and crew having families, relatives, or friends resident in Southampton. The screwv steamship Peninsula, Captain Watson, arrived here on Friday evenin to he docked for the purpose of repairing damages sustained in the colision wit a schooner off the Owers, on her passage from London to Cadiz. The Peniular and Oriental Company's steamship Pera, Captain Soy, leaves this port on Monday with the India and China mails, and she will also take out upwards of half a million of specie. The Alhambra, Captain Woodgates, leaves on the 7th withl the mails for the Peninsular ports; and the homeward mails from that quarter are due on Monday by the Sultan, Captain Cook. The Royal Mail Company's steamship Medway, Captain Parker, is preparing to take out the Lisbon and Brazil mails of the 9th; and the Avon, Captain Revett, with the next homeward mails, is due on the 16th. The European and Australian Company's steamship Etna, Captain Mllar, is expected about Wednesday or Thursday from Alexandria and Malta with the heavy portion of the Australian mails and the Oneida's and European's passengers. The Jsra, Captain Moodie, conveys out the mail of the 12th inst. The UJnited States' mail steamship Arago, Captain Lines, leaves on the 6th with the fortnightly American mails. GAL,mBY or ILLuSTRATTON.-No longer satisfled with partial modifications of her old entertainment, Mrs. T. G. Reed (late Miss P. Horton) has provided herself with one that is altoether new and allows her to display her talents in a fresh series of characters. The first part, wbich is entitled A ifonth from Home, is of a miscellneons kind, Mrs. Reed representing a number of personages whom Mr. Reed is supposed to meet in the courme of a rural trip. First, there is a Mrs. Horeydew, -ldndhearted schoolmistress, who tries to look severe, but finds an insuperable obstacle in the goodness of her heart. Then comes one of Mrs. lHoneydew's pupils, a gawkev girl, who neither will nor can geton with her musiclesn, butamses herself with fxing a paper pigtail in the preceptor's collar. An old country dame, who has never seen London, and a half -idiotic flower-boy vary the mirth with something like a touch of rustic sentiment, and a little scrape in which Mr. Reed is supposed to be involved -when he attempts to take a lodging constitutes a dramatic scene, in which a Byronic lover and a lodginghouse-keeper, terribly afraid of burglars, create much diverion. With the visit of a Scotch lady, who ingeniously transforms herself into the semblance of an Edinburgh fishwife, and then sings an excellent song, with dancing additions, the first part terntinates. In an earlier entertainment Mr. and Mrs. Reed depicted the woes of a composer tortured after the fashion of Hogarth's "Enraged Musician." The theme is sow pursued further. Mr. Reed is still at work on his opera, aud the new tormentors, represented by Mrs. Reed, make up the business of the second part of the new entertainment. These are a poetical lady, wUo, fn^ding Mr. Reed's piano uncongenial to her muse, would stop it altogether-an Irish servant, neither quick in apprehension uor courteous in manner-a gaunt. looking woman, who has been cheated out of a - little bit of property," and, from a mistake of names, insists that Mr. Reed is the despoiler; ead a pert doctor's boy, who ings his jokes into the open window. Yet is not Mr. Reed merely tormented; ultimately he is delighted. At the conclusion of the entertainment an old ldy appears, and sings a song exceeding her anile powers, but washaliu musician-like style. Dropping the vestments of age, and ilngiD8ga.scarf ais0u her ehoulders, she then executesl the "Bidiun from Lucs.cin Bonym. A German popular song and a scne from L Sommdla, both in costume, complete the achievements of the mys teions visitor, who is, of course, Mrs. Read herself. Up to this point the lady has exhibited a wonderful talent for the perception and reproduction of the nicest shades of charater; sho now appears as-ttie accomplished vocahist. Mr. RDeed als deserves great praise for the infinite good-humour with whfch during the who!e entertainment he stands as the target agBjnst which the jokes are directed. Moreover, ,ee has cospesgd the music of the four new songs, which ntD extrcL y pretty and exactly sueited to thefrpsrrPese,
I 7LLITABY AND NA fVL-TINTELLIGENCZ. The Raleigh, 50, sailing frigate, Commodore the Hon. Henry Keppel, 0.B., on her way from England to the East India station, was all waeU on the 7th of March, a letter from her of which date says, ' We have not get reached a port in India, bat hope to do so to-morrow." Her Majesty's new steam troop ship Urgent, Comnatuder Phillips, arrived at Barbadoes, 27th of March, after a good passage from Spithead. The officers speak higbly in their letters of the accommodation and attention they received. The heat at the date of our advices was very great during the day (thermometer 83). After landing the 49th regiment at Barbadoes the Urgent left that island for England (bound for Spithead) ont the Sth of April; she may therefore be hourly expected. The Sphynx, 6, paddlewheel sloop, Captain A. P. E. Wilmot, was paid off at Portsmouth on Saturday. She landed the gun, the Sultan's present to Queen Victoria, before rnentioned, at the Gnuwharf, P ortsmouth, on Friday, Fhere we believe it wiU remain for Her Majesty's inspection in pas3ing from Gosport to 0 sborno on the 7th inst. The gun is of cast brass, and reported to be about 200 years old; it is 13 feet5 inches in length, and. fires a shot of between 18 and 24 pounds. It bears the following inscription in Tarkish :"A A present from His Imperial Majesty Snltan Abdul Al edjid to Her Britannic Majesty Queen Victoria, 1857." The gan is of beautiful mould, and is covered with designs and emblems of great artistic execution, and with ornamental embossings, cbiefly of Oriental flowers. There are other inscriptions upon the piece in the Arabic language. The carriage is of walnut, wi th wheels of oalk all elaborately carved. An Admiral ty order was sent dovwn to Portsmoath on Thunday for the gun to be landed at the Royal Clarence-yard, and there mounted, to remain for the Inspection of Her Majesty on the Royal visit to Osborne on the 7th; but it was found difficu It to land the gun as ordered, owing to the want of the necessary appliances, and it wa% therefore landed at the gmu-wharf. Her Majesty's screw two-dec's:er Majestic, S1, Captain James Hope, which arrived at Spithead on Friday from the Mediterranean station, with about 50 military invalids, left for Sheerness (where she was commissioned on the 10th of February, 1854) to he paid off. The sailing corvette Amphitrite, 25, Captain Tatham, has bent sails in Portsmouth }Iarbour, and had her compasses adjusted. She goesto Spithead this day, and thence to her cruising station as a C-oast-guard ship on the Sussex coast. The Melville, 72, hospital-ship, fitting for the China station, is blocked down at Portsmouth, in readiness for painting, and wiU be out of hands in aboat another week. The screw steam storeship Industry, 2, Commander George J. Hodges, with stores from Chatham, arrived at Plymouth on Friday. The Boscawen, 70, Captain Powell, was warped to the jetty and docked at Devonport on Saturday. In pursuance of tho recent regulations issued at Woolwich commanding all officers of the Royal Artilery garrison to make application for barrack quarters, it has been found necessary to add considerably to the accommodations hitherto allotted for that parpose. The line of buildings known as Mill-lane, fronting the Artilery Barracks, pertaining to the Engineer Department, is now being demolished, and a spacious barraok residence is to be erected on the site. The inconvenience suffered by the want of accommodation for Divine service within the garrison is likewise about to be remedied, as the ground will also afford an eligible spot on which it is intended to raise an appropriate church for the use of the troops. The committee, headed by Major-Ge neral Sir W. F. Wil. liams, Commandant of Woolwich Garrison, constituted to receivecontribations in behalf of the distressed labourers discharged from the Royal Arsenal and Dockyard, have commenced fitting up the Royal Artillery riding-house for the purpose of giving a vocal and in strumental concert in furtherance of their desire to coUect a fund to assist the unemployed who are desirous of emigrating to Canada The services of Madame Ann a Thillon, Miss Birch, Mis, Poole, Mr. Wyllie Cooper, Mr. Frank Bodda, and other ars-ses have been engaged for the occasion, which is fixed for Wednesday rext. The Admiralty yacht Banshee, lyin.- at her moorings off Woolwich dockyard, was on Saturday ran foul of by a brig sa4ling down the river. The brig suffered considerable damage, and the Banshee had her jibboom carried away, and underwent various inj aries of minor importance. The Winchester, 50 gUns, sailing frigate, Captain Thomas Wilson, was insuected at the Little '.\ore on Saturday, by Chaptain Charles Wise, of the Vesuvius. The crew were put through various evolutions, after which she was towed to Chatham to be paid off. The Winchester sailed from Hongkong on the 13th of December last, arrived at Singapore on the 23d, sailed from Singapore the 27th, arrived at Angier Point, Java, on the 31st; sailed from Angier Point January the 1st, and arrived at Simon's Bay February the 11th. She remained at anchor until the 26th of February, when she sailed for St. Helena, left the Penelope, 16 guns, paddlewheel steai-frigate, there. The Penelope had lost two officers-viz., Mr. lianning, master's assistant, and Mr. C. F. Hockings, clerk-and 2G of her crew, most of whom died from dysentery and debility. The Winchester arrived at St. Helena on March the 8th, sailed from St. Helena on the 10th, arrived at Spitbead on the 27th of April, sailed from Spithead on the 29th, and arrived at Sheerness on May the 1st. The Russian frigate Aurora sailed from Hongkouig three days before the Winchester, met her again at Singapore, and also at St. Helena. She left aU her guns, sbot, ammunition, &c., at the Amour River settlement. The Rtussians are fortifying Imperial Harbour witb the view of establishing a grand naval arsenal there, with marine factories, &c. Imperial Harbour is about 130 miles souLth of Castries Bay. The harbour is commonly called Pallas Harloar; it is situated in lat. 48.58 N., long. 140.17 B. The remains of the Pallas, which the Russians destroyed and sunk to prevent her being captured by the English squadron on their cruising off that ctation, are still in the nocxh-west bight of the harbour, near which are two heavy batteries which were erected by the Russians during the late war. The Winchester has b!ought home the crew of the Bittern, 12-gun sloop, and the following officers, late of that vessel :-Mr. Charles G. Johnson, inaster; Lieutenant F. Eobiqson. I;eutenant W. Walsh; IMr. Charles G. Burney, p~aymaster * and Mr. George B. Newton, assistant surgeon-en all 59 ofthe old hands who lefI England inher. The Bittern is left as a tender to the Calcutta, ilag-hip, and Is officered and manned from that ship 'with a crew of 58 offiicers and men. The Hesper, scresw steam-storeship of 120 horse-power, Master-Commander James S. lI, laden with stores, puns, shot, shell, ammunition, &c., arrived at Sbeerness from Woolwvch on Saturday. She proceeds to Hongkong, and carries a number of supernurnaries out fur the aquadron of gunboats destined for the China Eeas. The Ciessy, 80 guns, screw steamship, of 400 horsepower, arrived at the Great Noreon Saturday, and anchored about two miles below the Nore Light-vessel. She will ho inspected at the Nore this day by Captain Charles Wise, of the Vestvius ; immediately after which she wvill go into harbour to be dismantled, paid off, and placed in the 2d division of the steam squadron of reserve at this port. The commander of the Coast-guard cutter Scout and her crew, by part of whom the mariner Hockings was saved from the Curlew when she was run down by the steamvessel Baron Osy, are ordered to appear before the Privy Council on the 8th inst., to give their evidence at an inquiry then to be instituted as to the sinking of the Curlewv by ranning her down and drowning seven persons, the Curlow being at the time riding in on the Mouse Sand, out of the fairway and roadstead of the ertrances to the Medway and Thames. MIr. Jackson succeeded 3esterday's highwater in getting the lighter by which the Curlew was weighed in upon the beach, at Cockleshell-hard, on the Isle of Grain side of the river Medway. The Dee, 4-gU paddlewbeel steani troopship, MasterCommander Thomas C.

1RAILWAY EINT-OLLM.NE NR0 n Au' u n The general meeting of this company-wa-sheld on Thurs day, at Paris, Baron James de Rothischild in the chair. The meeting being declared duly constituted, | . DEBEuQE, one of the directors, read the report, which explained the circumancesconnected withthe louof the secuzities in shares and bonds that had been stolen in Soptember last. The offending puaties had taken refuge Ix America, whence, withoutt any doubt, they would before 'long be conveyed to France on an application of extradition from the Emperor. The office for the deposit of shares had |been established in 1849 with every possiible precaution, not less than three keys being affixed to the room, oue being held by the person intrusted with the care of the securities, and two others by two of the directors. The precaution9 hkef thedeOkeePingofthedepositbaWneverboendepm-t edfrom. ("Oh, oh !" and lord mnurmurs.) Suchwas certainly thecae, as would appar hereafter, when aljthecircurstanoee of the case were made known, but in order not to interfere 'with the course of justice it was thought advisable not ts say more at present. (Renewed murmurs.) Thetwo principal delinquents had been for many years in the service o0 the company, and had always been remarkIble for their assiduity and intelihgence. (Iaughter.)- When the head cashier died in 1846 these two young Inen were promoted 'without any solicitation, simply on account of their good conduct-one on MIay 28, 1846, and the other on MAy 23. But on the 1st of September following it -was ascertained that both had disappeared. An immediate examinationwas instituted, and it was found that aJl their accounts and money were in perfect order. A few days after, how. ever, a certain number of shares were missed, and after a minute investigation a loS was discovered of not less than 5,752 shares and 1,000 bonds. It so happened, however, that the greatest portion of the loss fell on securities belonging to the house of MM, de Rothschild. That firm haddetermined to support the loss of these securities itself. (Loud cheers.) The meeting would, 'without doubt, appreciate fully, as the Board of Directors did,the high sentiment of dignity and equity which had actuated MMu de Rothschild in so Acting. (Cheers.) The loss which that firm would have to support was not less than 5,071 shares and 270 bonds, or five-sixths of the whole securities missing. (Renewed cheering.) As to the smal portion of the loss falling on the shareholders, the Board recommended them to distribute the loss over a certain number of years, so as to render it less onerous; to that end the Board would propose to set aside 100,000f. for the nexi year as a special reserve to meet the case. (Hear, hear.) With respect to continuing the deposit of shares at theoffices of the company the shareholders must decide for themselves. The works which were in course of execution were being urged on with activity. As to the new linea, from Paris to Soissons, Boulogne to Calais, Rouen to St. Qaentin, a line to the collieries of the Pas de Cali4 and Chantilly to Senlis-they were 432 ldlometres (270 miles) in length, and would involve an expense of U1O,000,00f. (4,400,0001), for which new shares, say 125,000 in number, would be issued, the present shareholders having the preference. As to the traffic, the receipts could not be expected to equal in 1856 those of 1855, which was an exceptional year on account of the Universal Exhibition. The receipts for 1856 were 47,337,970f. (1893,519.), and the expenses 18,965,402f. (758,6161.), leaving a profit of 28,S72,567f. (1,134,9031.), which sum, after providing for the sinking fund, the interest on loans, reserve fund, old and new, &c., would leave a total dividend on the year of 56f., of which sum 16f. bad been already distributed, the 40f. remainIng one would be paid at the office of the company on and after the 1st of July next. The accounts were then approved, and the dividend fixed as proposea. On the question being put from the chair for setting asido a special sum of 100,QOOf. for a special reserve to meet a certai portion of the loss falling on the shareholders from the robbery, A SH}isowLDx said that he had no doubt that every person present would second his proposition for a vote of thanks to AL de Rothschild for his most liberalconduotin taking on himself so exceedingly heavy a loss as that caused by the dishonesty of two officials. He begged leave to piopose such a voe, leaving it to the whole meeting to second it. (Cries of " All, all I" and loud cheers.) The vote was then put by the shareholders themselves dna carriad by acclamation. Baron J. DE RoTnscnm, in returning thanks, said that he had been greatly affected by the loss alluded to, not on his own account, but on that of the shareholders; and rather than permit any one interested to suffer inacnvenience and feel uneasiness he had preferred taking the loss on himself. (Lound cheers.) At the same time, he must remind the meeting that if the shareholders decided on leaving their shares in deposit they would do so at their own risk. The board of directors would be delighted to be releved of the responsibility of guarding them. (H'ear, hear.) The meeting then voted the 100,000f., and decided almost unanimously on stiUl leaving their shares in the care of the company as before. Full powers were then voted to the board to conclude arrangements for new concessions, and to adopt such financial measures as might he deemed necessary. xd Delbecque, the Dnke de GalEers, ML Adam, and Baron Alphonse de Rothschild were re-elected directors; and Id vernes was appointed In the placeof Mr. Moss, of The proceedings then terminated. SOUTH WALES. A huge pontoon, to be employed as a floating pier at the erminus of the line at Neyland, Milford Haven, was launched on Friday and floated to its position. It was commenced in the month of September, and consamed in building upwards of 300 tons of iron, 600 tons of timber, 5 tons of rivets, and 51 tons of bolts, so that the materials wei-ht upwards of 900 tons. The floating pier is 154 feet in length, 44. feet in width, and 16^ teat in depth. fMr. Brunel attenided the launch, assisted by several engineers. It is exgected that the present arrangements will afford sufficient accommodation to all the steamers which now come to the harboutr, including the Pacific. BRISTOL AND EXETER. Mr. J. B. Badham has resigned the office of secretary to this lIne, which he has filled vith much ability since the formation of the company. IllUhealth is thereason ofE r. Badhama's retirement. Mr. W. Harwood, accountant of the company, will, it is understood, be appointed secretary in te room of Mr. Badham. IN-VERNESS AMND ABERDEEN JUNCTION. The half-yearly meeting was held at Inverness on Wednesday. The directors reported that all their works from Keith to Naimrwere in progresg. The land arrangements had -II been completed, and, although calls had been more rapidly made thanhad been at one time anticipated, the worlks would be tho sooner finished and earlier returns be obtained in consequence. From the present state of the works it vas quite expected that the line from Keith to Malban on the south end, and from Dalvey to Nairn on the north end, would be opened in the autumn. Mr. GxNTr, of Dell. suggested that an amalgamation of interests should take place among the northern companies, and it was answerea that, as respects the Invern^-ss and Nain, and the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction, arrangements were in progress sith a view to their being united, bat at present no further union w as contemplated. Tke report was adopted, and the Maquis of Stafford, 3Ir. W. J. Taylor, Mr. L. Mtheson, 3LP?., and the Hon. . Bruce were relected directors. It ws stated that about 800 men are at work on the line. INVERNESS AND NAMIN. The half-yearly meeting washeldat Inverness on Tuesday, MIr. M?Intosh in the chair. The Secretary read the report, an abstract of which has appeared in Se umcsa. Mr. MATUESOI, M.P., approved the course the directors bad pursued. They had plainly stated the real facts of the case, and had not attempted to " cook the accounts," as had been hut too often done in the vain hope that things would come riht in the end. Such conduct ought tomoras the confidence of the shareholders in the The C}R Ax R3 sid it waspeculiarly ratifying to the shareholders to hear the largest shareholder in the company thus expressing hin self: and he felt :hat the directors could'not but be encouraed to put forth every effort in their power to improve the position of the com- any. Heo had no fearwhatevera to the future of the line. It would speedily improve, and as they would in a short time have one unbro -en line fronm Inverness to London their traic would so increase as that the line must Ebe a paying one. P o report was then adopted, and tho mneeting was made specdal to authorize te directors to geta Bill through Parhaent to crate a preferene stock and otherwiserise funds to complete the works and extension of the line, Althe resolutions were passed uanoimously.
