Consols for money opened-&at te clong quotation of last even. ing, 93k to J, ahld stewdily improved to 93i to i for moneyand94 to iforh4hoJ 3June. 30,0001. was invested in Exchequevbll at p4r out of the money received by the savings-binks for the, Exchequerbonds due to-day, and an impreion is entertained that further purchases will bemade. ' The market was likewise strengthened by the operations of the public and by the dy appeardsice of the foreign exchauges. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 213 - Reduced, 92i to i; New Three per Cents,, 924 to i ; India Stock, 220 to 222; India-bonds, lOs. to Os. discount; and Eichequer-bills (June), 3% discount to par; OMardh), par to 3L prenium. In the discount-market and at the Bank the demand for money was very active. Foreign securities opened with firmnes, but there wa less activity towards the close. Ii Turkish Six per Cent& the transactions for the account were at 9S3 and 94. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 100- and i for money, aid lCoo for the account. Chilian Sir per Cents. were dealt in at 102; New Granada Active, 23 aid 221; Mlexican Three per Cents., 231; Sardinian Eve per Cents., 91 and 91i; Spanmh Three per Cents., Newr Deferred, 25i; Venezuela, 36k; Dutch Two-and-a. Half per Cents, 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificatesl, 97t and f. In the foreign excanges this afternoon the rates of last post were fully maintained. The corn-market was quiet this morning at former retes. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the 'week shows an active busnes, with a tendency to higher price6. he f;ual quotations of tho French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69M. 20c. for money and 69f. 30c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration. A further sum of about 8,0001. Austalian gold was taken to the Bank to-day. The total retained out of the 200,0001. brought by the Anglesey has therefore been nearly 170,0001. Only a very limited amount of specie is engaged to be despatched by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Colombo on tho 20th. The total, it is thought, will not exceed 300,0001. The Royal mail steamer Medway, which sails for Brazil to-morrow, will take out 35,7001., of which 35,3001. is gold. The produce-markets during the week have presented a more animated appearanoe, and, owing to some revival of speculative feeling, higher rates have occasionally been paid. To-day, however, there was a partial falling off in the general demand. The tsactions m sugar have beenactive, and a further advance was realized at the public sales held on Tuesday, while subsequently there have been extensive transactions by private contract. This morning less firmness was manifested, although the quantity offered was very moderate. With continued l ar ge clearan ces fo r consumlption the stock Bbowfs another important diminution, and is now much below that of last season. The prevalence of easterly winds has kept out supplies. Coffee rema ins steady. Coooa is again higher, the extreme price of 90s. being paid for Guayaquil. The market for rum has shown increased firmness. In rice extensive transactions have taken place at 3d. to 6d. advance, both for parcels on the spot and afloat, but the speculative inquiry has rather subsided towards the close. No alteration has occurred ,in spice. Saltpetre has been steady, but to-day previous rates were not in all instances offered for some parcels of indirect import brought forward by auction. In the tea-market there has been a tendency to revival, and a large business has been transacted in congou. Kaisows of fine and medium grades are much inquired for, and considerable transactions have been reported in black leaf kinds. Common closes at 3s. id. per pound, at which there are buyers A definitive prospectus has at length been isued of the Riga Railway Company. The concesion is for 75 years, and th capitalis to be reduced to 1,636,2501., with a guarantee of 4* per cent. for interest and sinking fund. The tofil cost of the line is estimated not to exceed 1,343,0001., and a contract has been entered into with an English contractor upon those terms, with ample security. A sum of 293,250. will thus be saved, and the guarantee wiU therefore be equal to 5S per cent. upon the total expended. The shares are to be reduced from their orginal amount of 1001. to 20l., and in consequence of the reduction of the guaranteed capital only four shar of 201. will be issued in place of each 1001. On these 201. shares only 161. 10s. wll ultimately be required, although they wUll bo redeemable at par out of the sinking fund by periodical drawings. All Crown lands are given fee of expense, and since the estimates were formed the municipality of Riga has placed at the disposal of the company gratuitously whatever land may be required belonging to the city. The value of these terms depends, of course, entirely upon the correctness of the estimates with regard to the construction of the railway; but, as it passesthrough a commercial district, and is not on a preposterous scale intended simply for military and aggressive puirposes, the calculations regarding it are perhaps better entitled to consideration than those which have proceeded from other quarters. At an adjourned meeting of the Australian Agricultural Company to-day the result of the ballot for the election of deputy-governor was a large majority in favour of Mr. G. F. Leslie. Only 11 votes were recorded in favour of Mr. Fane De Salis, but it was explained that no contest was anticipated, the latter having intimated that he should decline to serve unless unanimously elected. In relation to this subject the following communication has been received .- "Sir,-As a few votes were accidentally recorded for me to-day at the ballot of the Australian Agricultural Company-viz, 11 in nunber, I am anxious it should not go forth to the public that any real contest took plae " Acting on the determination expressed by me to the proprietors when tbey elected me almost unanimously by show of hands (six shareholders, exclusive of directors, only hang voted against me) not to join a divided board, I requeed my supporters not only to withdraw me, but to sollt a1 my friends on no account to record a single vote for me; nor was any one of the numerous proxes sent nnaiked from the country permitted to be uased, or the issue would have been very different. "The result, therefore, of the present oontest proves nothing beyond this-that after an active canvass the late directors and their friends sucoeeded in inducing some 70 shareholderstorecord 159 votes in favourof theircandidate; but it leaves the question virtually at isue between tbo parties-vin, the approral by the proprietors of the pat policy and manaementof theDcompanV, wholly untouched- int which may be more satisfactorily tested, if necesary, whenthe Act now before Parliament is passed and etablishes a more equitable franchise than the present, which out of 903 proprietors excludes nearly 600 from all right of voting at a baot. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "W. FANE DE SAIS." The prospectus has been isued of the West of Ireland Mining Company, with a capital of 50,0001. in 11. shares, for developing a mineral district m the county Maya. LJead, marble, and slate are the products principally relied upon. The terms of the lease are not statd At a meeting of the Australian Mining Company yesterday a special report on the propriety of expending farther capital in developing the Charlton Mine was taken into consideration. Alter a length- ened discussion, the prospects being regarded as rather encouraging, aresolution was passed empowering the directors to make call of is. per share in two equal payments of 2s. 6d. whenever required. It is understood that arrangements are about to be made by the Eastern Counties Company to work the traffic of the East Suffolk Railvay; and that, in consequence, the Colchester, Pitsea, aud Maldon line will be rendered unnecessary. It is expected, therefore, that neither that line nor the Shenfield and Piteea, promoted by the Eastern Counties Company, will be proceeded wwith. Special settling-days have been appointed by the Committee of the Stock-E:xchange as follows. Buffalo and Leake Huron New Shaes and London and Blackwall New Shares on the 13th inst., and the North of India Tramnrod (Limited) Scrip au& Trinidad (Limited) Scrip on the 14th inst., the whole to be marked in the official list.

'PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, FRIDAY, MA&y 8. The LoRD C9AxcERxoR took his ent on the woolsuck at 5 o'clock. SMALL ANNUIES. The Earl of ALBEMARLE, iii presenting a petition suggesting that the electoral franchise should be conferred on urchasers of annuities of 01. and upwards, said he vwieed the advantages of the 14th and 15th of Victor' cap. 45, were more generally known. By that Act ann. ties of as small an amount as 11. and the multiple of it, rnot exceeding 301., could be purchased upon Government security. The evidence of Mr. Neison and other eminent actuaries proved that ordinary benefit societies seldom remnained in existence more than 20 year It was therefore a perfect absurdity for them to enter into engagements with young subscribers to commnence to pay annuities st the end of 50 years, and Mr. Tidd Pratt, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, had recommended them to abstain fromentering into such engagements and to confine their scheme of benefits to relief in sickness up to a specified age. It would be very hard to debar the labouring poor from making provision for old age, but that was entirely obvated by the Act to which he had referred. He begged to direct the attention of their lordships to its provisions, and to request their assistance in making them known more extensively in the counties in which they possessed inflauence. The petition was ordered to lie on the table. THE CASE OF GENERAL ASHBURNHAM. The Earl of CARDIGAN said he was anxious to pUt a question to the noble lord the Secretary of State for War. nfortunately, he was not present last evening, when the manuer in which the general officer appointed to command the expedition to China had been calumniated was brought before the attention of their lordships. The noble earl (Grey) had made a speech which he considered a very excellent speech, as in the course of it the noble earl expressed an opinion that officers who made such uncalled-for attacks ehould not be employed by Her Majesty's Government. He also saw that the noble lord (Panmure) had stated that there were great difficulties in ascertaining who the calumniators 'were. ile did not think himself that there was much difficulty in obtaining that knowledge. The question he wished to put was whether the noble lord the Secretary of State for War did not think it would be reasonable and desirable, wrhen an officer openly avowed that he 'was the author of the grossest calumnies, that some system should be adopted by him, as Secretary of State for War. in conjunction with the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, to bring that officer to trial, with the view to test the truth of the accusations he had made, and, in the event of those accusations being proved to be calumnious to order that the officer so offending should be dismissed the service. He was induced to put that question at the present moment with especia reference to the expedition now going otut to China. Itwas in the last degree desirable that all the subordinate officers and men forming part of that expedition should have the utmost confidence in the general officertowhom the command of it had been intrusted. The interests of the public service, indeed, demanded that such a feeling should prevail among the subordinate officers aud the men composing the expedition. But at the same time he (the Earl of Cardigan) did not deny that his statement was somewhat connected with his own position, because he soine time since appealed to their lordships in reference to his own case, and be was then given to understand that it was not expedient to bring any officer who calumniated his superior officer to account, more particularly when the calumny was put forth anonymously. Their lordships, however, knew that he (the Earl of Cardigan) had suffered deeply under the grossest calumnies, which had been disseminated by a subordinate officer who had published his name to the whole world; and he submitted that unless some check were speedily put to such calumniations of superior officers by their subordinates as were now made with impunity the discipline of the army would be sapped to its very foundation, if not entirely destroyed. (Hear, hear.) He therefore entreated the noble lord the Secretary of State for War to consider whether, when an officer publicly avowed himself the author of statements which were calumnious, some serious measures ought not to be taken to bring that officer to justice. Having been grossly calumniated himself, and having, since he (the EarlolCardiau) last had the honour of addressing their lordships, seen those calumniations publicly repeated, he had beeninduced to bring this subject under the consideration of the noble lord. He would again say that during his services in the Crimea he had met with the support and approbation of all his superior officers. Those who were friendly to him and those who were possibly not friendly to him were nal equaUy satisfied -with his conduct there; and he would only say that his consmience was perfectly clear that on every one of the occasions on which his conduct had been impugned he did nothing else than he ought to have done under the circumstances in which he was placed. Lord PANMIURE.-My lords, as the noble earl has called my attention to this subject I have no hesitation in saying that in cases where junior officers, either anonymously or otherwise, make attacks on the conduct of their superior officers, I should be most happy to give to the Commanderin Chief all the assistance m my power in maintaining the discipline of the army by bringing those junior officers to account. (Hear, hear.) But there is some little difference between the case of the noble earl and that which was the subject of conversation in your lordships' House yesterday. The officer who attacked the noble earl had avowved his name as the author of a book which he had published in the first instance auon, mously. When the noble earl brought his case before your lordships I advised him, as his reputation and his position were uninjured, to treat with the contempt they deserved the insinuations made agaisthis miiitarycharacter in that book, and I toid him at the same time that if he wished a remedy in respect to the charges which had been brought against him the law of the land was open to him as a means of setting his character right with the pablic. I do not, however, wish now to renew the discussion on the case of the noble earl; but in reference to the debate which took place last night I am desirous of setting myself right with your lordships with regard to a part ot the observations I made on that occasion, in which, think, I have been misrepresented. I am charged with densing the right of the public press generally to criticize appointments made by the Executive Government-made, that is to say, not by the present Executive Government only, but by any Executive Government. Now, I never hRd the folly to make any such assertion; on the contrary, I hold it to be the vocation of the public press to criticiza all appointments, made either by this or any other Government, because it is their duty so to do for the guidance of public opinion. But what I did caU in auestion was the manner in which the criticisms against General Ashburnham, reflecting as they did on his professional character, had been made, and the time at which they had been made. (flear, hear.) Your lordhips will recollect that those criticisms were made, not during the time when Parliament was sitting, and when an answer could have been given to them in your lordships' House or in the other House of Parliament, and not during the three weeks which afterwards elap-ed when General Ashhurnham was in this country and might have defended himself, but after he had left the countr as the commander of the expedition intrusted to himby the Government. I think, my lords, I did right in makig the observations which I addressed to your lordships yesterday on this subject, hut I repeat that I by no mueans denied, or intended to deny, the right of the public press at large to review any appointment that might bemade by the Executive Government. (Cheers.) The Earl of CARDIGAN said he had made no reference whatever to the opnions of the press in the observations he had addressed to the House. What he said had respect to the conduct of junior officers calumniating their superiors, and he contended that unless officers so conducting themselves were brought to account there would be no way of teRtiDg the truth of the accusations they made against others. or of maintaining intact the discipline of the army. The Earl of HARDWICKE said he thought the noble earl opposite (Lord Paninure) had done nothing more than he was bound to do in vindicating the appointment of General Ashburnham from the attacks made against hinm behind its back in anonymous letters in the public press. Be (the Earl of Hardwicke) would say this in referenco to the attacks made on General Ashburnham, that whenever a gentleman wished to attack the character of another in the public prints it was only manly and honourable to sign his namo (hear, hea.-), and if he made a public attack up 'a a man anonymously he disgraced himself. (Cheers.) He (the Earl of Hardwicke) was not astonished that his noble friend <'the Earl of Cardigan) should have taken that opportunity of saying what he had said in reference to tbis saubject, seeing how he had been aspersed himself - and with respect-to the rtatemeat of the noble lord (Lord animure), -that he would assist the Commander-in-Chief in taking steps to bring junior officers to account who might 'calumniate their superiors, that was a course already recognized in the public service, and to act on aay other prnciple cn the War Department would have -tbe inevixtable tendency of jeopardizing the whole vilitary 4etablishments of the country. But, as regarded an officer-on half-pay or in retirement, the question was materially cltered. The GGvernment of the country in the oldhtimes used to-be averse to officers who were fond of writing; and he thought if now the Government showed a disinclination to have anything to do with -officers who were gien 'to writing they acted wisely, for it was not nscesary that men of eminent military capacity should silso be eminent as writers. -Thevinnacation ofcharwcter mret the-re-fo-r-e -be left ~to t'h'e civil tribinals of'the conntry,. and the case became involved in considezable difficulty. He thorqht that, unless both the offiecrs inolved in uoh a transaCtGon as he had referred to wereon fuU pay, the Crown would notbeempoweredto punish an officer who had libelled his superior. The Earl of CARDIGAN wras tuderstood to say that officerm upon half pay were lis4le to bio recalled to active service, and he thought therefore that the military law affectin g these cases ought to apply 'to hera as well as to officers upon fail pay. The larqs of CLANRICARDE observe'd that he hai been somer hat misunderstood in hiving beon sposed to blame the conduct of the press with referennoe to this sub Hect. He had not intended to impute any sucm'i blame, nor hd be any objection to the discussion raised ).'y the press other than that which arose from the particul,r time at which sach diecussion had taken place. What he objected to was the conduct of officers who used the newsn.apers as vehicles for attacking their superior officers behiui their backs. He thought there oulght to be some powrer ~on the part of the military authorities to punish such conmiuct, He mutst say that, while military offlers were generally the very first to complain of the comments of the press wlNich censured or criticised military appointments and actioct. wvhether such comments w ere fair or whether they excceeded -vwat might be considered the limits of fairness, thoke oDicers appeared in every instance when they thought they bad a grievance to be the first to avail themselves of the press for the dissemination of their own views, Now, 4e did not think they were entitled to take both these courses though they might adopt either. They oughttoobiectto the interference of the press and avoid it, or they ought to appeal to the press and submit to 'ts criticisa. He thought, however, thiat when At officer whose i aty might easily lio aetWed oame forward, as " L t. L ha{ done tomak chagesaffctin th crdit of another officer Tesubject then dropped. REPoRTs OF PARLIA3IENTARY ANI PUJBLIC PROCEEDINGS. Lord CAMPBELL rose and said,-My lords, I sbaUl detmin you for a very few miautes in moving for the reappoitment of the selecb committee which was appointe i during thelast session to inquire into avery important and difficult subject-namely, whether the privilege now enjoyed by reports of the proceedings of courts of justice may be safely extended to the reports of the proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament and of other public assemblies. At present, according to the established law, the proceedings of coarts of justice may be published with impunity if they are fair and bond fide. The greatest benefit has arisen to the public from that privilege, but it extends no further-not even to the proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament. It has lately been decided-and I believe the decision is allowed to be a sound one-in the case of " Davison v. Duncan," that if, except ia the case of proceedings of courts of justice, the editor of a journal publishes accounts of any other proceedings at aU criminatory of any individuals the proprietors of the journal in which the report is given are liable to an action. It was stated by my distingaihed predecessor, Lord Denman, that there was no immunity for a fair and faithfal and accurate account of the proceedings of this or of the other House of Parliament. Now, there does seom to be a grievance here, because although actions are not frequently brought in consequence of the reports of proceedings of either House of Parliament, there is no doubt they may be brought. Considerable anxiety prevails lest actions should bo brought under such circumstances, and if actions are br ought there can be no defence on the part of the most distingaished and trustworthy journals of this country. It seems to me, my lords, that this is a state of things which oaght not to con. I tinue if it can be prevented. A remedy has been proposed to which I certainly can by no means accede-namely, that all distinctions between verbal and written slander shall be abolished, and that it shall be a complete defence of a writtea libel if the defendant can show that the same statement has been made by any individuaL This proposition is supposed to rest upon what is caUed " Lord Northampton's case;" but, as my noble and learned friend on the cross benches wel knows, it is founded upon an utter misconception and misrepresentation of that case The dictum of the judges who sat in the Star Chamber went, if properly understood, no further than this-that when what was said by another was repeated upon a proper occasion it might be defended; but te allow that what has been whispered in a corner may be published in everyjounal in the empire with impunity would be wholy inconsistent with the protection due to the characters of individuals. If al that is said at a public meeting, or in any assembly that may be called a public meeting, is to be published without any remedy being provided for those whose characters may be attacked, the most mischievous consequences wiU ensue. Public meetings maybe got up for purposes of calumny, and the person who uttersthe calumuY may be a man of straw, who will fly the country as soon a" he has uttered his slanderous statement. I think, however' that a remedy may be devised which will, at all events' mitigate the evil that exists at present. Some years ago I myself proposed that complete immunity should be given to fair reports of what took place in either House of Parliament. my proposition was supported by the late Lord Denman, but, unfortunately, it was not successful. I certainly cannot conceive any well-grounded objections to that proposal. All the arguments by which you support the privilege of reports of law proceedings wl equally apply to the proceedings of the two Houses of Prliament. What is the foundation of that immunity of lavr reports ? The public good. Well, I suppose your lordships and all the members of the other House are of opimon it is for the public good that the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament should be made known to the country ? (Hear, hear.) There are, however, other assemblages with whose proceedingsit is desirable that the publio should be acquainted. This day, I beheve, Convocation assemble, and I suppose that to-morrow we shal have an account of the speeches of our most reverend and right reverend friends. Notwithstanding the grave character of that assembly, statements are sometimes made there which might form the grotunds of action; and it would be extremely hard if proceedings were taken against The Times or any other journal for accounts of what had been said by the Archbishop of Canterbury or by the Bishop of St. David's. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh) It may be urged-but I only throw out the suggestion, and give no opinion on the matter-that the immunity should be extended to aU meetings held under the authority of an Act of Parliament, and to which the public may rightfuly claim admission. Some line rmust be drawn, for it would be monstrous to contend that anything that can be caled a public assemblage should be privileed. If that were the case, no doubt hir. Ernest Jones's meetings and the Sunday assomblages in Hyde Park would be mach frequented by those who wished to calamniate their neighbours. Somelinemustbedrawn withregardtothepublimeetings to which the privilege isextended; but, if this cannot be done, it is matter for consideration whether it might not be enacted that if a fair account of what has taken place at a public meeting is given, and no real damage is inflicted upon the character of any one by such publication, the jury might be entitled, in case of an aotion being brought, to find a verdict for the defendant. Until very lately if a jury found a verdict for a farthing damages fuU costs folowed, but the law in that respect is altered. I ask your lordships, however, to consider the case of an action for libel where the plaintiff has suffered no damage, but whe there proprietors of the journal against which proceedings are taken are obliged to pay a very heavy sum as costs, independently af the anxiety and disagreeable consequences which the mere fact of hanngan action broughtagainstthemmustoccasioa. I merely offer these saugestionsinorder to induceyour lordship3 to institute an inquiry on the subject, and I trust yoa will consent to the renewal of the committee which was appointed during the last session. Lord CampbeU then proceeded to say that he also wished to take the opportunity of caling their lordships' attention to the manner in which oaths were administered to vitnesses who were examined before committees of that House. When the House was not sitting witnesses could not be sworn, and persons were frequently brought up from the country who were kept in town for some days, or were sent back to their homes and again brought to London to be sworn, either proceeding entailing very considerable expense. The shif t was sometimes resorted to of allowing witnesses to give evidence without being sworn, and of afterwards swearing them at the bar of the House to the truth of all they had stated. The most serious inconvenience arose from the present practice, for at timaes so great were the crowd and confusion at the bar that people were inclined to suppose that a mob had rushed in, and as much alarm was occasioned as if Lord George Gordon's mob had broken into the House. (A laugh.) The only question was how a change was to be brought about-whether by a standing order or by legislation. e had been of opinionthat legislation was not necessary, and that their lordships proprio vigore had power to authorize witnesses to be sworn before select committees. Since he last called their lordaships' attention to the subject it had been further inpuired into by his learned friend Mr. Macqueen, and the opinion he had entertained had been fortified by the result. The uoble and learned lord then referredto the precedentof thetryers of petitions, whoexamined witnesses no doubt on oath. If such power as that existed, might not the House order itsown committees to administer an oath? At the same time he gave no decided opinion on the point, and did not ventare to propose a standing order in reference to the matter. He believed that the noble and learned lord on the woolsack and the noble and learned lord on the cross-benches (Lord Wensleydale) felt doubts as to the power of their lordships to allow witnesses to be sworn before select committees, and until those doubts were resolved he should by no means propose to move a standin order on the subject. It might be said that the House of Commons would object to pass a Bil empowering their lord. 1hips to swear witnessss before a select committee, as that House had no such power itself h but that was an anomaly which ought to be removed, and such authority ought to be given to the House of Commons. The noble and learned lord concluded by moving for a select committee to consider whether the privilege now enjoyed by reports of the proceedings of courts of justice might be safely andj,roperly extended to reports of the proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament, and of any and what other assemblies or public meetings, under any and what conditions or restrictions ; and also for a select committee to consider and report on the expediency of altering the present mode of administering oaths to witnesses to be examined by committees of the House. He proposed to add to the committee Viscount Everaley, whose great Parliamentary experience and constitutional learning would, no doubt, be found of great The LORD CHANCELLOR thought that all their lordships would concur in the propriety of the course proposed to be pursued by the noble and learned lord. Both the subjects to which attention had been called were of the greatest importance. With respeot to the last alluded o be confessed, looking at the matter with the eye merely of a lawyrer, he doubted whether it would be safe to attempt to effect the important change suggested simply by a standing order. It might be possible, investigating the subjeot with the eye of an antiquarian, to discover precedents, leading to a conclusion that the right of delegating to committees of the House to swear witnesses did exist; but it must be felt, if sAch & course were taken and a witness were afterwards eharged with perjury for evidence given before a committee, that it would be to the last degree doubtful what might be the deoision of the judges on the validity of the oath so administered; and therefore, in matters which might involve criminal consequences of great importance, he was satisfied that legislation was the wisest course to pursue, The object of administering oaths was to give the highest sanction to truth, and it was always said that an oath should be administered with the greatest solemnity and by the highest functionaries; but any of their lordships who bad witnessed the administration of oaths in that House must be aware thM-tthat obieCt was en.rdrely defeated. His noble and learned.jrieud had certainly not exaggerated the indecorum attendant on the gwear.Ing of witnesses at the bar of the House SomOtimes, fin sionsc'qence of the rushing in of witne6ses to be sworn t bbe bar, ihere was such a disturbance that thei proceedings of a judici,l nature which were going on haddo be supended, oree they wrere continued in the midst of nois made by a rord a ; the bar taking oaths. There wa% the leas n it1 in the mode of aninisrig. oaths, "ndj that the evil ought to be remedied he had no doubt. He vas sure that a power given to select committees of their lordships? House to swear witnesss would work wll and the oaths would then be administered with greater solemnity. Ho saw no difficulty in the suggestion that the Comnons would not pass a Bill to enable witnesses to be sworn before their lordships' committees without claiming r. si1ailar privilege for themselves, for he saw no reason why they should not enjoy such a pivile, e if it established an additional Â£ecrit in. favour of the trutb. In that motion of his noble and learned friend's, therefore, he entirely concurred, although he would caution him and the rest of their lordships nut to be led away by old antiquarian precedents of what bed been done by the tryers of petitions in former days, which might afford very scanty sepuity rbinst what might be the decisions of Westminstar-h in modem times. With regard to the other nnotion he antrl areed in the expediency of removing what he admittedtoe an acknowledged and crying evil. He thought that would be very difficult to arrive at a definition of what should be regarded as a public meeting; but he believed that the snggestion of his noble friend that juries should have the power, in cases where they thought tbat no damages had been inflicted, of finding a verdict for the defendant vhich would give the defendant his costs would afford a simple and practical remedy for the existing eviL He reserved to himself, however, the right to examine the subject more in detail before committing him. self to the approval of any particular measue The motion was then agreed to. TICKBTS OF LEAVE. The Earl of CARNARVON, who had given notice of his intention to inquire whether the Government proposed to make any alteration in the ticket-of-leave system, stated that when he intimated his intention of putting that question to the Government he was not aware that the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment had determined upon reviving the Bill of last. session for maksng certain changes respecting the law of transportation and penal servituade. No alusion had been made to the subject in the Speech from the Throne, and he was anxious to inquire, therefore, what were the intentionsof theGovernment with respect to it. He understood, however, that at that moment a Bill was being brought forward for first reading in the other House by the Secretary of State, and under these Circumstances he thought it desirable that ho should refrain from making any remarks at present. Their lordships adjourued shortly alter 6 o'clock.
HO'USE OF COMMONS, F=AY, MAY 8. The SPE 'RmB took the chair at a-quarter to 4 oclock. The oaths were administered to nine members. A large number of private Bils, the progress of which was arrested by the aissolution of the last Parliament, were read, some the first and some the second time. STANDING ORDERS. Colonel WIISON PATTEN nominated the Select Committee on Standing Orders as follows.-Colonel Wilson Patten, Mr. Henley, Mr. Sotheron Estcourt, Sir Robert Ferguson, Sir John Yarde BuUer, M"r. Palmer, Mr. Wrightson, Mr. Brrmston, Mr. Thornely, Mr. Eliott Lockhart, apd Mr. Bonham-Carter. Colonel FRENCH remarked that for the last 25 years it had always bean the practice to put two Irish members upon this committee. The list now proposed contained the name of only one representative from Ireland. It-was not his intenton to oppose the appointment of the commitcee as nominated, but he trusted that means would be found to introduce a second Irish member. Colonel WILSON PATTEN observed that his object in naming the committee had been to get as many of the old members as possible. If he had been aware that there were not two Irnah members in the list he would have been glad to select one in addition to Sir Robert Ferguson. Hie would not make any alteration now, but would endeavour to rectify the mistake during the course of the session. The committee was then agreed to. COMMITTEE OF SELECTION. On the motion of Colonel WISON &ATTEN, the Committee of Selection was constituted as fellows :-Ar. Sotheron Estcourt, Sir Robert Ferguson, Mr. BonhamCarter, Mr. Palmer, Lord Harry Vane, and tho Chairmpn of the Seleot Committee on Standing Orders. PRIVATE BILLS. Colonel WILSON PATTEN, with the view of facilitating the progress of private Bilis, moved the folowing resolution:-"'That theCommitteeof Selection have powertoform and appoint the meeting of all committees on the private Bill referred to them or to the General Committee on Rail. way and Canal Bills, provided seven clear days elapse between the second reading of such BiUls and the sittings of the committee thereon; and that three clear days' notice only be given by the clerk of the Committee of Selectioa to the clerks in the Private BiUl-office of the day and hour fixed for the first meeting of such committee." The motion was agreed to. PETITIONS. Petitions in favour of an alteration and amendment of the Superamuation Act were presented by Sir G. PECHRELL, from the civil servants of the Crown attached to the port of Shoreham; by Mir. P. W. MA1tTIN, from civil servants employed in the Custom-house, Rochester; by Sir E. PERRY, from the mechanical officers of Devonport Dockyard; by Mr. C. PAGLr, from the civil servants in the Nottingham collection; by Mr. KiNNAXRD, from the Lord-Provost and magistrates of Perth - also from officers of Her Majesty's Customs in Perth; by lfr. BAXTER, from the Custom-house officers at Arbroath; by Mr. COLLIER, from officers in the Customs at Plymouth; and by Mr. WmLcox, from the officers of Customs, Southampton. Petitions were also presented by Mr. Knm..D against the opium trade, from the mayor and inhabitants of Leicester; by Mr. HADFIELD, from working men and house. holders of Sheffield, praying for extension of the suffrage, ballot, economy, and direct taxation - by Lord GODERICII, from Mr. Cadogan Williams, of Bridgend, Glamorganshire, upon the subject of deferred annuities; by Mr. T. DuNrcomiB, from Islington, in favonr of a more frequent registration of the elective franchise ; and another praying the House not to waste so much public money in printing useless Parliamentary papers; by Sir J. PAXTONi, from the proprietors of the Galway Mercury, the proprietors of the Graresend .eporter, the printers engaged in the Momning Chronicle office, the printers at Mr. Taylor's offlce, Faringdou-street; the Printers at Mr. Lawrence's ofice, Bear-alley; and the inhabitants of Cheserfield, for the repeal of the paper duty; by Mr. WrLuCOX, from the shipowners and others of Southampton, in favour of amendments in the Merchant Shipping Act; and by Mr. WEGUELti, from the members of the synagogue at Southampton, for the removal of Jewish disabilities7 MAYNOOTH. Mr. SPOONER gave notice that on Thursday, the 21st inst, he should move that the House do resolve itself into a commi ttee to consider the Act relating to the endowment of aynooth College (great laughter), with a view to the withdrawal of the grant from the consolidated fund, having due regard to vested rights. (" Hear," and laughter.) TBE LICENSING SYSTEM Mr. KER SEY MER inquired of the Seretary of State for the Home Department whether tho Government intended to propose any alteration in the present mode of licensing pualichouses and beershops. Sir G. GREY replied that it vas not the intention of the Government during the present session to propose any Bill upon the subject, but he thought it right to say that the law relating to the licensing of publichouses and beershops was in a very unsatisfactory state. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member who had asked the question, and who had paid great attention to the evidence given before a committee which sat two sessions ago, would confirm the statement that very great complaints were made of the present system of licensing. Some of the evils complained of no doubt arose from the defeotive administration of the law (hear); but still the law itself required reconsideration. In consequence of the great amnount of capital invested in those trades and the great interests involved, very great caution was required in dealing with the sabject. THE SUPERANNUATION ACT. Sir M S. STEWART asked whether the commissioners appointed to inquire into the Superannuation Act had sent in their report; and, if not, he wished to know when that report might be expected? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, the commissioners had not yet sent in their report, but he had reason to beiieve that such report was in a forward state, and would before long be laid before the Government. As soon as that was done it should be placed upon table of the House. SAVINGS-BANKS BILL. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY asked whether the ri hon gentleman tho Chanoellor of the Exchequer woud place upon the table the resolutions which he proposed to move upon the subject of savings-banks. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQIUER said the resolutions which he should propose would be precisely the same as those which he moved in the Ilst session, and it was necessary to adopt that course before bringing in a Bill which involved some contingent charge upon the cossolidated fund. THE NEWFOUNDLAND FISHERY CONVENTION. Sir J. PAINGTON gave notice that on Monday next he should present a petition from the colony of Newfoundland upon the subject of the proposed convention with the Freneh Government respecting thae fsheries off the coasts of that colony, and he should also ask the Secretary of State what were the intentions of the Government upon THE ADDRESS IN REPLY TO THE QUEEN'S MESS&GE. Mr. DODSON brought up the report of the Address, which was read. Mr. HADFIELD wished to call the attention of the aouse to that paragraph of the Address which referred to the great development of the wealth and industry of the people throughout Her Majesty's dominions. There was one most important part of Her Majesty's dominions which formed an exception to this rule, and that was India. There was not a.more ill-governed aL more oppressed, a more de. graded people in the: world than those of India. . ( oh, O " o had done nothing a we ought to have done to developt-the resources of that country,-resourm which were so Wdmirably calculated to promote the happiness of the people there, and to advance the commerce of this couetry. He would not enter upon thissubject now, as is was *#e that required separate and distinct discuseion; bnt be cout not let the present opportunity pass3without record. ing hia opinion regarding it. It was not his wish to disturb the unanimity of the House upon the AddreEs, andtherefor6 lh vwould not move the amendment which he had at one time contemplated; but he trusted the e.ttention of the friends of India would speedily be directed to this subject, and that the opiniox t f the House would be taken on the question xwhether a wore efficient mode of developing the resources of India co4 not fag evised, and whether the obetcloe which now impe*g ) aPvlcation of sklll and capital in Her Majests fEoreign and neol m poscsions gnely couldnot be removed. (Hea4, hear.) Mr. BOWYE1. asked when tho Committee on PLblic Moneys would be ro-appointed? Mr. WIISON said the Committoe on Pablic Moneys had been moved for by the right hon. gentleman the member for Portsmouth. The Government had no objection to the reappointment of the committee, and he would consult wvitk his right hon. friend on the subjact. Mr. BRISCOE could not refrain from expressing his satis. faction at the declaration made by the noble ord at the head of the Government laet night, that it was his intention at the opening of the next session of Parliament to submit to the House a measure of Parliamentary reform. IH could corroborate what had fallen from the noble lord the member for Middlesex as to the state of nLblic feeling on this qaes. tion. He had recently attendea several large meetings in that division of the county which he represented, and there was an unanimous feeling expressed at every one of them in favour of a county franchise of the value of 1OL He hoped that such a measure would next session be proposed on the subject of church-rates as would be readily conceded by the members of the established church, and wonld give satisfaction to the Nonconformist part of the community. (Hear, hear.) The report was then received, and it wvas ordered that the Address be presented to Eer Majesty by such members of the House as are of Her Majesty's Pzivy Council. LGr. WILSON moved that the House at its risingadjourn till 3Ionday. THE TRANSIT. Mr. W. S. LINDSAlY rose to ask for some explanation regarding the Government transport, the Transit. On the 7th of April this vessel sailed from Spithead, having on board 30 of the Royal Engineers, 286 of the 90th Foot, and 119 of the 59th, besides officers. On the 8th she put hack on account of an accident; having "brought up" near the Needles and anchored for the night, she swung on her anchor, and knocked a hole in her bottom. She was, as he bad been informed, efficiently repaired, and again sailed, and the next account received of her was from Corznna,: of dato the l9th of April. He wished it to be understood th t hetookthese particulars from the public journals, and desired to have an explanation regarding them, maklng ,no charge of his own. (Hear, hear.) They were told that the Tranit put into Coranna in deep distress; and a gentleman on board, who was descerbed by the correspondent of e7w Times at Portsmouth as a person of intelligence, )w spectability, and rank, gave the following description i of what had occurred on the voyage:- " Here we are, done up ! two days' ' Bay' weather sent us in here to be fresh rigged ! You never saw a worse bea boat in your life-crank, top-heavy, and everything tha.'s bad I . . . Such an old tub vou never saw ' the rigging never set up, or anything secured; we had aard work- to keep the masts from going over the side; if she had pitched instead of rolling, I am sure tha foremast must have gone over the bows . . . In fact, a greater tab to roll I never saw. She is top-heavy. I am certain she will never weather the Cap e . . . She is a disgrac to the British Government, and more so to the dockyard authorities . i . There are not one dozen hen (troops) on board with dry hammocks, every seam in her deck etting in water," The Transit was one of three vessels-viz., the Perseverance, the Urgent, and the Transport-which werebought by the Government from the Messrs. Mare at a time wh,en transports were in great demand. Many gentlemen of that House must remember the Perseverance, which was allotted to them on the day of the great naval review at Spithead, when he believed many members were not privileged to see the review at alL (Hear.) This ship on entering the dockyard at Deptfordcapsized, and dida great amount of damage, not merely to herself, but to the storehouses in the yard. Noble lords in another place would remember the Transit, for it was the vessel which had been appointed to carry them to the naval review, and it served them even a worse torn than the Perseverance had served the Commons. The third vessel was the Urgent, but, as he had not given any notice to the right hon. gentleman tho First Lord of the Admiralty of his intention to question him asto this vessel, he shoula not expect him to enter into any explanation in reference to the various reports which had been published about her. The Urgent left Spithead on the 28th of February last with the 49th Regiment on board for Batbadoes, and it was stated that, having sprung a dangerous leak in the Bay of Biscay, she had put into Corunna on the 3d of March in a sinking state, and would certainly have foundered but for the calm weather and the daring act of the second engineerwho set free the valves of the engine pamps. On the 9th of March ghe put into Madeira, and after sailing thence she broke her engine gear, which was however repaired in 24 hours. Her engines were again set to work, bat again broke, and she was obliged to proceedto Barbadoes under sail. where she arrived on the 27th of Mlarch. Another latter from Barbadoes, dated April 6, entirely confimed this statement. The writer said that for the first two days of tho voyage everything went on right, but that on the third day it wias discovered thas a leak had been sprung and that there was eight feet of water in the hold. An attempt was made to set the pumps to work, but it was found that they would not work. There were 800 men on board, and the boats would only hold 300, so that they were obliged to set about making rafts. Luckily they got into Coronna just before the iurnaces went out. After leaving Madeira the engines broke down twice, and it was found on arriving at Barbadoes-this was so extraordinary a statement that he could scarcely onderstand it-that the screw had worked out a large piece of iron from one of the plates in the ship's stern, and she took in so much water that 30 men were kept at work at the pumps during the whole time. These three ships were built by Messrs. Mare, bauilders of great eminence, who had turned out some very fine ships - hut it was Asated that after they left Messrs. Mare and came into the hands of the Admiralty alterations were made in them which entirely spoiled them. It was reported and very generally believed that the Admiralty built large poops and raised forecastles on them, and put masts into them far too heavy for theirtonmage. These ships were built on very fine lines, long and narrow, and the effect of such alterations as these would be to destroy their stability in the wind. Masts which would k-eep a ship of 56 feet beam stiff in the wind would be too long and heavy for a ship of 35 feet beam, and would make her anything but stift With the top weight above and the fine lines below every seam of her would open in a heavy roiling sea, and this would account for all the men's hammocls being perpetally wet, and for all the other accidents spoken of. It was very extraordinary that accidents should have happe ned to all these three ships, an,d he hoped, for the sake of the agonized feelings of those who had relatives on board the Transit, now on her way to China, that the right hon. gentleman would be able to give some satisfactory explanation of these various statements. The hon. gentleman concluded by asking whether these tbree vessels were bought from the Memssrs Mare, what price had been paid for them, and whether, after they had come into the hands of the Admiralty, the alterations which he had described had been made in them? Mr. BENTINCK thanked the hon. gentleman for having brought this subject under the notice of the House, and, before the right hon. gentleman the First Lord of the Admiralty answered the questions of his hon. friend, he vihed to ask whether another circumstance respecting the accident to the Transit, which had been stated in the newspapers, but which had not been adverted to by his hon. triend, was correct? The circumstance of the Transit being allowed to ground on her own anchor showed great neglect and carelessness, but it was stated that the existence of the leak was not discovered until 5 o'clock next morning, when tbe engineer went into the engine-room. It was almost impossible to suppose that in a vesel of that class there would be no proper night watch kept, or that there would be no officer whose duty it would be to ascertain the state of the ship during the night, but he should be glad to hear from the right hon. gentleman whether anything had come out before the court of inquiry which had been held on this accident to give foundation for such a statement. Sir C. WOOD said, he was very glad to have the opportnnity of maldng a statement on this subject, because it was impossible to deny that a very strong feeling had been created in the country by the various reports and the various letters which had appeared in the public papers in reforences to these vessels. He hoped the House would excuse him if he went at some length into this matter, for he hoped to be able to remove from the public mind the unnecessary degree of alarm which had been excited by the statement to which tho hon. gentleman the member for Tynemotlth had referred. These three vessels were built by Messrs. Mare, who were builders in the river of the highest possible character. They were not built with reference to the anticipated demand in consequence of the war, but, when the war broke out and there was a great demand for troop ships, the Admiralty hearing that these vessels were likely to suit them caused them to be surveyed by the master shipwrights of Woolwich and Deptford, and, upon their report that they were well calculated to carzy troops and stores, purchased them. The only alteration they suggested was that they should be so fitted that their screws could be raised. Tho hon. gentleman (Mr. Lindsay) hed asked whether it was true that these ships were fitted with the masts of two-deekers, and that such ballast had been put into them as entirely to alter their trim aud cbhnge them from very safe to exceedingly crank and dangerous vessels. The fact was that the size of their psops had been increased and the fore part of the vessels had been covered over so as to afford greater accommodation for the ship's company, and thus to leave the whole decks clear for the ccommodation of the troops. This was done with the lightest possible materials, and did not seriously add to the weight of the upper paxt of these ships. Allthese ships had been fitted with lighter masts and yards and with a smller quantity of sail than was intended to be given to them by their builders. He had not the par. ticulasx of the equipment of all the three ships, but he could state to the Houee the factg as to the Transit. The Transit, instead of having the masts of a two-decker, or of a vessel of that tonnage, according to the Admiralty scale, had the same masts as were put into some 20-gan corvettes which had recently been built and sent to sea, and which were reported to boso stiff that the Admiralty were about to build another vessel of tho same siZe and to give her an upper deck. The Satellite was one of these corvettes, and the mastg of the Tranvit were similar to those of the Satellite. The burden of the Satellite was 1,460 tons, thatc of the Transit 2,580 tens; the It ugth of the Satellite.wss 200 feet., that of the Tzaz:sit 300 feet, thebea of the SateoUlte 40 feet 4 inches, that of tlhe Transit 41 feet 6 inches. Therefore, so far om having the insem and yards ofa vessel larer than berelf,tbe T ir 4 a - ing to thO scrle of a vessel 100 feet shorer and 1,120 tons les than heslf. Tho whole weight of the upper worhs of the Tnzsit was 62 tons; that of the guns and sbot carried on the upper deck of the Satellite, 81 tons. Tho ar of the sailitended to be giver to the Transit by her builderx was I SW0 square feet ; the area, of those which she actuaUy carriedwrs onlyl406,00. The result of al these calclations was that the stability of the Transit as oompared vrith that of the SateUite and her siter corvettes was a3 3 to 2. The. vesels were not built for troopships, bat, so far from having spoiled them by the alterations which they had made in them, the Admiralty had very considerably undermasted them. They were built for caring cargoes, vhich would be put low into the ships, and would be carried during the whole of tho voyage; therefore, when tbey came to be used as troopships, it wss necesary to put ballast into them to counteract the lightness of troops as compared with dea. I weight cargo, and to provide against the results of the con. sumption of water and provisions on the voyage. Into none of them, however, wss there put so much ballast as to sink them below the point intended by the builders to be their water-line. In the case of the Tratsit the Admiralty were not satisfied with the calculations alone, but made experiments upon her at Sheerness both with troops and with deadweight, the effect of which was entirely to confirm their reslt. A few hours before he came down to the House ho badhadpntinto his hands a publication called theAfedzgnic 6afczine4 containing an articla upon the Transit, written, he believed, bya person of groat reputation rwho Was a witness of these experiments, and in thit article there was the following passagewa- "If we express in numbers the ratios of the moment of stabUility to the moment of the sails-which is the measure of the stiffness of the ship under canvas, then while the Pearl and the SateUite are each represented by the number 54, the Transit will be represented by the number 69. This is when the vessels are light. When they are deep the numbers aro,-Pearl and Satellite each 84, and Transit 119. The relative stiffuesses under steam alone are, when light, Pearl and Satellite each 53, Transit 67; when heavy, Pearl and Satellite each 82, Transit 116. As a further evidence of the stiffness of the Transit, we may compare her stability with that of the Adventure (formerl the Resolute), which . justlg raised in The Times of Taesday, May 6, by tLaid, of Birkenhead, who built her. These ships aeof about the same size, the displacement or weights differing only by three tons-that of the Transit being 2,751 tons and that of the Adventure 2.748 tons. The sbility of each of these ships wa estimated approximately; the decks, engines, mnasting gear, equal weights of ballast, &o., belng taen into account; and while the stability of the Adventure was found to be 5,130 tons, that of the Transit wag no less than 8,484 tons." He hoped, therefore, that the House would be satisfied that both by calculation and by experiment the Transit bad been proved to be as steady a vesel as oouldbe aent to se. The experiments of which he had sEpoken swere tried after the poop and forecastle were put on, and therefore shoted the quality of the vessel, not as she wasz when she was pur. chased, but as she waus at the present time. The hion a Lndsay) had referred to the case of the It was true that an accident occurred to that ship when in dock at Woolwich which occastoned some alarm but since she had been at sea she had done her duty remarsbly welL On the day of the naval review complaints were made by hon. members of a delay on the railway, but he was not aware that any one had made any complaint of the accommodation on board the Perseverance, or of the manner in which that vessel had performed the service fo: which she was appointeL About r. week ago he had received a letter from Captain Macdonald, one of the officers present on board the Perseverance at the time of the accident to which the hon, gen: tleman had referred. That letter stated,- "You need not be in the leastanxiousastothisship's being top-heavy; for on our arrival at Barbadoes we had only four tons of coal dust and a very few days' bread and provisions left." The Perseverance, therefore, had performed its duties without the slightest complaint of any sort or kind. With regard to the next vessel to which reference had been made, the Urgent, he could only st4te that he was not aware that any well-founded complaint had been made against that vessel as distinguished from her engines. It was true that, as regarded her engines, a comnplainthad been made about an occurrence which took plaice when first she went to sea, but the House mnst remember that the engines of these vessels and the machinery cnneoted with those engines were not manufactured in Government dockyards, hut by enginemakers in different pats of the country. The engines of the Transit ad Urgent were built by theMessrs. Napier of Glasgow, builders of great celebrity, for the Russian Government, and they had been seizedl a the commencement of the war and placed in those vessels Now, what had happened in reality to the Urrgent? It was perfectly true that an accident happened to the UJrgent in the Bay of Ebony, but the accounts which had appeared in the newspapers were founded rather upon the imagination of the writers of them than from the realfacts of the ca6se In order to show to the House what actually did occur he wrould read the letter which hadbeen received fromthe commanding officer, and which ran as follows "Her Majest's ship Urgent' Cormnna, March ,1857. "Sir,-Exaggerated accounts will find their vray -to England about the Urgent and the 49tk Regiment having toput into Corunna. I shall take the liberty of layin befre you the facts :-The leaden joints orwashers inerte between the blow-off pipe and the Kngston valves proved rather too sUght for their work, and were blown oat, taus dividing the pipe by which the water from the boilers! is driven into the sea. It is my belef, also, though I have no proof to offer, that some small subshnce, such as a bit of wood or coal, was driven through the Kistons. and temporarily prevented their closing after blowing off. MyletWer to the Board states the time and circumstances of the water coming into the ship, and which at one time rose nearly tip to the fires. Under the clrcumstanoes-made zo much more grave fromour not knowing how to accountforthe leak-we manned all the pumps, made use of the fire-engine, and of all the buckets to hale. The compartments forward and aft were tight, and conffned all the wrater to the stoke-hole, and in a short time we hadimastered the water. By 1 pm, the sbip was dry, and the cause of the leak dscovered. The chief engineer stated that the defect could be made good at sea, but as Corunna was not much out of the way I determinod to put in there and coal, instead of stopping at Madeira for that purpose, by which means the defects would be maie good with more certainty and with more satisfaction to those persons embarked in the ship; but I have no hesitation in saying that the ship might have gone anywhere without anchoring to repair the defective jointsalthough we should have found ourselves obliged to blow off much of the water in the boilers into the bilges-a very objectionable proceeding, and, of course, involving the necessity of pumping it out agan Sint e arriving here we have made iron joints insead of those broken, and having nearly filled up with coal, I hope to proceed to Barbadoes at 2p.m. "Captain Milae, U N. "C. G. PH[PS,i" (HIear, hear.) Attacks of this sort were very amusing, because they seemed to imply that it was only Government vessels that suffered from bad weather, huts circumstance had come to his knowrledge which showved that other vessels saffered also. At the very time the Urgent went to sea a fine merchant ship did so likewise, and, encountering the same gale, was not injured sllghtly like the Urgent, but was driven back dismantled. As regarded the Transit, her engines had, as he had already stated, been originally built for the Russian Government, *ad he would frankly adnait that they had turned oat il, and had broken down; but all the accidents wihich had occurred were to be attributed to the ngines, and not to the ship itself. During the war the necessity for the services of the vessel was so great that it was found impossible tolay herby and put in new engines, andall that could be done was torepair the existing engines as well as possible, but at the close of the war they had been takoa out and new ones substituted for them, and the ship at the present moment was perfectly ready to go to sea With regard to the particular accident to which reference had been made, he would inform the House how it occurred. The ship left Portsmouth and proceeding to the Needles encountered a thick fog, and the commander knowing that there was a Irge number of merchant vessels about deter. minedtoanchor. Hedidso, andinthecourseof the night, the tide having changed, the ship drifted over the anchor, which upon being raised was foand to have had its stock broken, and no doubt the hole in the bottom of the ship had been caused by the vessel striking the anchor-stock. The conduct of the captain was, no doubt, exceedingly negligent (hear, hear), and the court of inquity ha nok as had been stted in the newspapers, acquitted himof all blame, but, on the contrary, had ordered him to be reprimanded, and he had been reprimanded most severely. He was an officer of high character, and had served with great credit to himself, and it was not thought that a single instance of carelessness should in his case be visited by his being superseded, Now, although it had been stated that he (Sir Charles Wood) onght to be sent to sea in tho Transit, and that the Board of Admiralty had been guilty of more than Crimean mismanagement, how, he would ask the House, could any precaution on the part of the dockyard authorities or the Board of Admiralty have prevented such an accident 9 Now, with regard to the Transit having patinto Corunna, the hon gentleman had referred to a letter deseibilng the dangers which tho ship incurred in the Bay of Biscay. He did not know whether the gentleman who wrote that letter was suffering from that depression of spirits which sometimes displayeo itself on board ship in those not accustomed to the sea, and therefore took a gloomy view of matters; but he could only say be had received a very different account. He would read to the House a letter which he had received from a friend of his, whose brother was in command of the troops on board the Transit:- " Dear Sir Charles,-I received last night a letter from mybrother,writtenonboardtheTransit, atCornna, the tone of which is so different from thaSt of one which I have just read in The 1Times that I think it right tolet you know what hessys. ly brother is in commandof tbe troops or board, and tongh by no means given to grumbling, would not be likely to conceal from mse any serious complaint in such a matter. He says that the Transit had to encounter a four days' gale in the Bay of Biscay, tho wind blowing right in their teeth; that they shipped a good deal of water (no mention of any leak), and that their foremast rigging having got loosened, they have put into Corunna in order to get it put to 'ights, and expect to be off again the following morning. He speaks in high terms of the general arrange. ments for the comfort of the troops, who he saTs are in perfect bealth, and is warm in his praises of Captain Chambers. His whole letter is written in the best spirits, and certainly conveys no idea of any misgivings as to the safe arrival of the Transit." It was by no means an unusual thing for the rigging of a newly-rigged ship to stretel, and the rigging of the Transit I bad no doubt stretched and required to be set up. He had been told by a naval officer an instance of a ship which, after having been at Portsmouth 10 month', went across tho Bay of Biscay, and in that case the rigging was so stretched that it was neeay to set it up. The operation of setting up the ligging of a ship might he understood be performed at sec, but in the present instance it had been thought more oonvenient to do it at Corunna. He would read an extract from the report of tbe *iisg qualities of tho ship Transit, dated the 22dof Augut 185, agia by t# commander, master, &ad the capenter:-_ "Does she ride eay at anchor ?-Yesi, so far r "Does she roll eay or uneayin tho troh ef tbo0 t r -Deep, but easy. " Does she pitch easy 9-Yes. "Is.sho,generallyspealking,anessyorunbqahpt-f. ,- That statement would, he thought, serve to show. thHouse that the Trasit had been tned in evry pomible. way. He might add that there was now no complaint made, with respect to her engines, nd he wae sue the Hous would not fail to see that the first accident which had be_ fallen her was not to be attributed to any omiston upon the, part either of the Admirlty or of the authorities at thedockyard, bat rather to negligence upon the part of hercommander, while the accident which had happend to herin the Bay of Biscay was one towhich anyshi nghtindersimilar circumstaces be liable, He true he had nowsatified the House upon the subject, and would venture to. express a hope that wbat h fallen from the hon. geutlemanI the member for Tynemouth would induce the oh-. servance of more caution and more forbearance in. laying such letters as they have heard read before the public.

The subjoet hAd now, however, betn very fully entered into, and he shotuld mmak only a few observations with respect to it In reference to the circumstance of the Trausit pavcge grounded her anchor at the peedien he mut say thche very much doubted whethter sthe ought toh have anchored in such very shoal water, while he'admitted the force of the statement which had been madei by tho right hon. baronet, to the effect that a gmat fog ha& prevailed&t the time. It had been stated in theewapaper. that the commander of the rvesse had been fully acquitsedbut it a speared that the Board of Admiraltyhd found ui gatyo greatneglect, t ad he(Admiral Wc lcott),h c andvaI officer, must confess that he had, in his opinion, been deservedly reprimanded, inasmuch as he had vot taken those Precautions in the position of the ship whu.h the circumn stances of the case demanded. The on. gentlem h member for Norfolk had alluded to the fact sa somewhat sinigular that the water 'had risen to such a s_ight in the' ship without being observed, and with reesWt to that. point, so, he (Adi Walcott) could not help thikuag that some aegree of neglect had taken place. It was not without considerable pain that he felt it to be, his duty to utter a word against the cnduct of a brother, officer, but he thought the conduct of the coamander inthea pnreset instance was such as to call for censu. TheTJ.ranstit however, subsequently jot into heavy water in th& Ba%y of Biscay, and, as every naval officer must know'wass the case when a ship with new rgging encountered a feveret gale in that sea, hier rigging had stretched.

The technical 'node of proceed. iorg in such a sota of thin the g t ad. miral poinRted out by bolding outhis hat before him and manoeuvring it in excl tion of his viewr.

Mr. LABOUCHERE moved for a select committee to consider the state of those British possessions in Nort'i America which are under the administration of the Hudson's Bay Company, or over which they possess a license to trade. The right hon. gentlemen observed that he had iu the last session of Parliament stated at some length-the reasons which had induced Her Majesty's Government tos come to the conclusion that it was their duty to call the attention of the House of Commons to the podsition of that vast region comprised within the terms of his motion. The House had u; on that occasion deemed the statements which he had made sufficient to warrant the appointment of a committee to inve.tigate that very important subject. That committee had sat for same time, had examined several witnesses, and had succeeded in obtaining information of great importance when the dissolution took place. He now proposed to the House to renew the inquiry thus abruptly closed, and in doing so, he was happy to be able to state that out of the 19 memrber who had served on the original committee 17 had been returned to the new Parliament, so that he trusted the Housa would again have the advantage of the experience which those gentlemen had already acquired. He should also bakethat opportunity to inform the House that the colony of Canada had sent over to this country the Chief Justice of Upper Canada-a gentleman of the highest characterwhio would be ready to give the committee that assistance which the testiniony of such a man could not fail to afford. From the progress which had been already made in the inquiry he ventured to hopethatthe committewould be enabled to bring their labours to aeoncludsion before the end of the session, and that the Government would be in a position to deal very shortly with the important aud complicated subject of their deliberations. After a few words from Mr. ADDERLry and Mr. WyLi> the motion was agreed to PRINTING COMMTEE. On the motion of Mr. WLsoN a select committee was ordered to be appointed to assist Mr. Speakerinall matters which relate to the printing executed by order of this House, and for the purpose of selecting and arranging forp.nting returns and papers presented in pursuance of inc-- tlons made by members of this House, REGISTRATION OF LEASES, &c.

JUDGMENTS EXECUTION BILL. Mr. CRtArslRD moved for leave to bring in a Bill to render judgments or decreets obtained in certain courts in England, Scotland, and Ireland, respectively, effectual in any other part of the united kingdom. Mr. WHITESIDE congratulated the hon. and learned minem er on his perseverance. Defeat made no impression. upon him. Four times the same Bill had been discussed and debated, and ho was rather suirprised, considering thefato of this Bill in tho early part of last session, that tho hon. and learned member should have brought it in again. Would it not be botter to refer this Eill to the department which was about to consider the law Bills, for which department he also had a budget? He essured the hon. and learned member that his Bill w worth nothing; that it would enounter the same opposition as on former occasions; and that it would meet the' same fate. Tbe Bi ws not quite worthy of a plaoe in theprogramme which was rather sarcasticall caled laW reforea in the Queen's Speech. Colonel FItENCH said that the lon. andlearned member's Bil bad been not four times, but five timnes brought before the House, and it had been opposed by every Irish member, except the late member for Clare, who had losthis seat. The Government onht not to support the intio- duction of idle measures of this kind, when the time availablo for the businmess of the session was so short Mr. BLAND could a*nre the hon. and learned member that every kind of opposition should be given to his Bill. Leave was given to bring in the Bil, which WAs red a. first time. On the motion of Mr. GpOGA? certain returns reltive to. the Mercantile Marine Fund were ordered. MALT, &c.

IkErORTS ON THE INLAND REVENUE.-A very interesting volume, yesterday published, and invested with the mual blue vcaper cover, purports to contain the first zeport of the Cornintsasoners of Inland Revenue on the Inland Revenue. The commissioners do not on this occasion give a complete history of the various duties composing the Inland Revenue, for this would be to wite a history of taxation for the last 200 years, but they review the changes which have occurred in the Excise, Stamps, and Taxes since the year 1848, when those three branches ol revenue were placed under the supermtendence of one board of commissioners, and included. in the general description of Inland IRevenue. In so dokng a vast amount of interesting infor- ;mation is supplied, to the public. The combined receipts from the three great systems of taxation abovementioned amounted in t}.e year ending the 31st of March, 1857, to the sum of 9'.,195,58li. The magnitude and difficulty of the task of colecting themK apper to be considerable. t Thero "are V,pioua appendices to the report,

RAILWFAY IZNTELLIENCE. RAILWAY REEC1PTS. The traffic returns of railways in. the united kingdom published for the week ending May 2 amounted to 447,2071., and for the corresponding week of 1856 to 416,9211., shoving an Increase of 30,286L The gross receipts of the eight railways having their termini In the metropolis amounted for the week ending as above to 184,5711., and for the corresponding week of last year to 176,6681., showing an increase of 7,9031. The increase on the Eastern Counties Railway ainounted to 2,7871.; on the Great Northern to 1,0441,; on the Great Western to2,4951.; on the London and North.Western to 2,0311.; on the London, Brighton, and South Coast to 2561.; and on the South-Eastern to 3521.; total, 8,9451. Bat from this must be deducted 421., the decrease on the London and Blackwall, and 1,0001. on the London and South-Western, leaving the increase as above 7,9031. The receipts on the other lines in the united king. dom amounted to 262,636/., and for the corresponding period of 1856 to 240,2531., showing an increase of 22,3831. in the receipts of those lines, which, added to the increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the total increase 30,2861. as compared with the corresponding week of 1856. The following are the receipts of railways for the past week:- LFH1CESTER AND HITCHOIN. This line was opened throughout for passenger traffic on Thursday. It passes through Market Harborough, Kettering, Wellingcorough, and Bedford to the Great Northern Railway at Hitchin. The length of the line is 65 miles. The fares were fixed at a low rate to accommodate the district, and large numbers of passengers were safely conveyed over the line from Hitchio, Bedford, Kettering, and Market Harborougb to Leicester and back during tho day. The event was celebrated by rpublic rejoicings at various places along the line, and at Bedford a dinner was given in honour of the occasion. CORK AND BANDON EXTENSION. It appears that arrangements have been made with the landowners and ratepayers for increasing the guarantee of certain baronies in the county of Cork from 3 per cent., as authorized by Parliament, to 5 per cent. on the cost of constructing the extension line of railway from Bandon to Bantry. The guarantee is to come into operation on the opening for traffic of the sections to Dunmanway, Clonahlty, and Skibbereen; but, unless the line be opened for traffic throughout to Bantry within tbree years from the passirg of the Amendment Act, the guarantee is to cease. The four districts giving the guarantee will be liable to a cbarge of 5d., 4d., 3d., and ld. in the pound respectively in case the traffic on the line should only pay the working expenses; but if it should yield 2; per cent, on the specified cest of the railway, the linbility wil only extend to half the above charges, and should it yield 5 per cent., the districts will have nothing to pay, and enjoy the advantages of railway commlunication.

Messrsm Tite, ALP., Hardwick, Bellamy, Donaldson, Angell,. Gilbert, Inman,j Smirke, Wyatt, Ferzey, Mylne, Mocatta, Penrose, and Nelson, a deputation from the loyal Institute of British Architects, presented a memorial respecting the preservation for the public use and enjoyment of the area recently cleared at the south-eastern an,le of St. Paul's-churchyard. The following is the memorial presented:- ,o TIIE CHAN Am) McaD 35EoR OF THE METitOPOLITAY BOARD OF WOscxs "Sboweth-that this Institute are, by their charter, called upon to promote both the 'domestlocouniecnlce ot the citizens and the public improvement and embellishment of towns and cities,' and being deeply impr d with theconvicluoof the mporane of preserving for tte publuicse and enjiombut the whole of the area recently cleared at the soutb-eastern angle of St. Paul's churchyard, at Its Junctlon I with New C.nnon-street, take leave respectfaUlly to submit the foilovwing obeervations to the attention of your Hon. Board.' "That the space in question, i left open, would afford the finest pfointof ght for viewing the Cathe ofalit.

" That in an artistic point of view the Improvement urged by sour memorlaU2b may be conaidered of a nation t character, and as regards convenieoce the metropolis at large as well as the dty wil derive tite benefit of keeping the site free for ever for the pabc use, and that with reference to eanitary considerations itwould be manifestly highly advantageoasaa improvingthe free circuation of air in a confined part of the city.

The memorial was received and adopted. M1r. Deputy HARRISON introduced a deputation from the Improvement Committee of the corporation of London on the subject of the vacant ground in St. Pauls Churchyard referred to in the report from the Improvement Committeeof the corporation, transmitted with Mlr. Serjeant hIerewether s letter presented to the Board on the let inst. From remarks made by the members of the deputation It appeared that it had been in contemplation by the corporati..n to build on one-fifth of the ground, and to leave the remainder unoccupied. There was a willingness to give up the whole plot if the Board would aid in the contribution. The value of the whole of the area would b3 75,0001. The ground had been purchased by the corporation for the improvements in Cannon-street, and would involve a serious less on the city if the coaltn x ceased in 1862. Ir. Deputy HARBISON mnoved that the subject mentioned in the report of the Improvement Committee be referred to the Committee of Works and Improvements of this Board for consideration and report. The application of the corporation of London was of a distinct character, as the owners of a triangular space of land which hadbeen admitted to belong to them by Parliament, by the Commis. slonera of Woods and Forests, and he did not think the ownership would be disputed by anybody whatever. When the corporation undertook to make a street leading to Cannon-street they had to purchase a large quantity of land, but at the time they did so they expected to recoup some portion of that outlay by selling the groundrents, or else their funds would ' be utterly inadequate for the purposes to which they were required to be applied. Time went on and suggestions were made to the corporation that this piece of land should not be covered, and on an interview of tho members of the corporation with Sir William Molesworth he recommended that the Improvement Committee should for a time suspend the erection of buildings on this land, as Sir B. Hall was about bringing a Bill into Parliament for effecting certain metropolitan improvements. From that time up to the present, however, nothing had been done in respect to it. A suggestion had been made to them as to covering a portion of the ground. and,as the making of this street had been very expensive, they felt they would not be justified in sacrificing the whole of the ground unless they were caUed upon by this Board to do so. The corporation had been in negotiation with the Skinners' Company, but their demands had been so very extraordinary that those negotiations had failed altogether. Therefore the only thing that was left them to do was to let the ground, but before doing so they had thought it wise to confer with this Board asto its opinion whether the ground should beleftuncovered or a portionof it. If thequestionwasreferredtotheCommitte of Works and Improvements they could then ascertain how much of the ground was necessary for the public conve. nience, or whether the whole of it should be left uncovered, and whether, if the whole should be required, the corporation should bear the whole of the charge, or a portion of the expense should be borne by the metropols at large. He did not look upon this as merely a city, but as a metropolitan improvement, for it would open the street to the numerous visitors from aU parts, who always proceeded to see St. Paul's CathedraL Supposing a p' rtion of the land beyond the model erected there was left vacant, it would ca-se a loss to the corporation of no less a sam than 50 0001. Mr. CRAPPItAEL seconded the motion, andthoughtthat the corporation of London were justified in expecting to be remunerated if they gave up for the benefit of the public property that had been purchased by them. Mr. LESLIE was in favour of the improvenent, but considered that the corporation of London ought to pay for it out of the revenue they derived from the coal-tax, Major LYON did not consider that this was an improve. mont that would facilitate the traffic through the city, or that they should get on faster whether the land was built upon or not. Neither could it be urged that it wouild be beneficial in a sanitary point of viow. Therefore it was not a metropolitan, but a city improvement, and he thoughtthat no prindfacie case had been made out why this mat-ershould be referred to a committee of that Board. He should move as an amendment, "That the Metropoltan Board of Works ought not to be called upon to contribute any portion of the expense of the improvement in question." Mr. BURSLE5 seconded the amendment. Mr. WRIGHT said he should vote for the motion, bat in doing so he considered the Board would not be pledged to any course whatever. Mfr. DOULTON could not support the amendment, as that certainly pledged them to something; but he was astonished that the corporation of London, with all their boasted love of art, should come to this Board and ask them to pay for a piece of land which was to be applied to a stricty city improvement. He would advise the Board to pay the money, as it would show that the corporation of London were utterly unworthy, and incapable of fulfilling their duties to the public. Ir. t. L. TAYLOR supported the motion, and said that the coal-tax was as much the property of the corporation of L'ndon as the property of an individuaL, Mr. TuRN'ER was opposed to the amendment and hoped it would be withdrawn, MEr. OFFOBt was surprisedat the lengtthto which the debate had extended, as he thought that they would hbve at once ae(eded to the motion for referring the subject to a cnumittee and gain all the information they could obtain. He hoped that after being referred to the comnmni tee they should have a report reoomu,ending the proposition for devoting this space to the public to be carried into effect. Mr. Deputy HARRISON replied. The CHAIRuAN then put the question, when there appeared for the amendment, 4; against it, 29. The original motion was thea put, aud caried by a larga majority. STREETr NOMNCLATURyE ANn IIBEO OF HOU5V. Mr. D'IFFANGEP brought up the report from the com.

The Board adjourned at a late hour.
THE LATE EXPLOSION AT LUND ZLL. FRIDAY AFITn-OON. Since 12 o'clock yesterday no less than2tbodies have been recovered. Four of them were brought out during Mr. Webster's shift, from 4 to 8 o'clock yesterday evening; eight more were sent to bank during the shift of Mr. W. P. hiaddison, from 8 to 12 p.m. yesterday * six at the concln. son of Mr. Potter's shift, at 8 o'cloci this morning; and six more during Mr. Brown's shift, which terminated at 12 o'clock. The total number now recovered is 73, and it is expected that many more will bo recovered during the next few da-ys. Of the 24 bodies recovered since 12 o'clock yesterday 16 have been identitied by peculiarities of dress. Their names are:-E(dmund Knowles, of Hemingcield, aged 30 years; Edward Trainer, of the same place, aged 23 years ; Jame3 Pollard, of Wombwell, aged 19 years; William Ilings. worth, of Lnndhill, aged 32 ears (a deputyn or 1re-tnri . Edward Sinimonds, atis hman, o Lndhill, aged i years- Joseph Grimshaw, of Wombwell- John Hobson of Lund U11; Edward Pollard, of Wombweil; James Walker, Richard Wilkinson, John Harper, and Thomas Wilkinson of Lundhill; Charles Walker, of Wombwell- John Phillips George Woofinden, and Amos James, of West Melton. The remaining eight are in a very decomposed and mutilated state, and had no articles of dress upon them by which they could be identified. Near the body of Hobson, and in part of the trousers which had been torn from his body by the violence of the explosion, was found his watch. It is a silver ono, and the exterior was cempletely blackened by lying in the water and filth, but it was otherwise in a perfect state. The hands pointed to 12.17, from which it is sup posed to have stepped at the moment of the explosion. The inner cae of a sllver watch which had belonged to Joseph Grimshaw was found near his body. It was identified by the initials. A search was madefor the remainder of the watch, but it could not bo found. The watch had no doubt been broken by the explosion. Nearly the whole of the bodies mentioned above have been recovered from different parts of the boardgates, the fals preventing the banks or workplaces from being penetrated as yet. Those brought out lst were taken up on the ends of the boardgates adjacent to the levels on the north side. There are at this time no les3 than 30 bodies lying in the reception shed, but arrangements have been made for interring a number of them this afternoon andthe remainder will be buried to-morrow. The large fals around the shafts have now been so far removed as to restore the currents to a great extent and render the roads and boardgates quite passable.

The cotton-market has been steadier this week, but trade has been exceedingly dull in cloth, and sellers have found it difficult to maintain the pnrices of last week. In somo instances further concessions have had to be made, and, con. sidering that the rates demanded were unremunerative, this is reasonably enough a matter for great dissatisfaction among manufacturers. For T-cloths, longelotha, and heavy domestics thereowas little inquiry, and the sales effected have been mostly of very limited extent. In printing cloth and shirtings there has also been a limited busmecs, and the tendency of prices is in favour of buyers. In yarns the urchases have mostly been for immediate requirements, but there has been rather more inquiry yesterday and this morning, with a firmer feeling in prices, though hitherto this has not led to much actual business t Of the linen trade Messrs. Richardson, Lee, and Co. ay in their monthly report that " the demand has been smaUer than in the earlier montbs of the year; but, considering interferences with regular trade caused by the unsettled state of monetary aftairs and by the election, the amount transacted has been considerable. As respects prices, the tendency is in favour of the buyer of coarser kinds, while the finer sorts are held for full quotations, as stocks are smalL The advanced prices for Leeds yarns established during M.arch are maintained, but a further expected one cannot at present be realized, although the quantity of yarns being sent to the continent is very large. Future prices will depend much on the operations of buyers for the United States' fall trade, which are likely to be considerable."

A surveyor bas been engaged in inspectinzaportio of ground adjaeent to the tidal harbour for e purpose abovenamed. It is said that The vast requirements of the steam navy and the remarkable faclities possessed by Cardiff for tbe shipment of coal have inducr, the authori. ties to seure a dock there fortheshippitg of their own stores rather than incur the extra epense of transit either by sea or land, Cardiff is easy of acc',5s and men-of-war can coal tber, and prooeqd dirt to 2oreign ports Without )PS3 oCtiue.

LONDOA, SATUDAY, MAY 9, X57. In the House of Lords last night The Earl of OARDiGJ asked Lord PBBRvn whethor he did not think that oome system should be adopted to check the calumnious attacks of subordinate officers on their superiors. He had been grossly calumniated himelf by a subordinate officer, and therefore felt anxious to check a pracice which was calculated to sap the service to its foundation. Lord PANuuit replied, that in cases where inferior officers, either anonymously or otherwise, made attacks on the conduct of their superiors he sihould be happy to afford all the assistance in his power to bring the offenders to account. The cswe of Lord CARDIGAN waus somewhat different, and, considering all the ircumstances, he (Lord PANi-uR) had ad-vised him to treat the accuastions brought against him with contempt. With regard to General AenBURNnAM, he thought that the manner in, and the time at, which the attacks complained of were made justified the observations which he had felt it his duty to make on Thursday night. At the same time, he did not at all deny the right of the press to review and criticize Government appointments. After some further discussion, in which Lords CARDIGAN, HARDwl0x, and CL&wRicAzDE took part, the matter dropped. Lord CA sm.L moved for the reappointment of the committee to inquire into the expediency of extending the privilege now conceded with regard to report of proceedings in courts of justice to the reports of debates in the Eouses of Parliament and other public assemblies. The LoaD Cu-as?aoo quite agreed with the propriety of the remarks which had fallen from mord CnBzLL. The motion was then agreed to. Some other business was then despatched, and their LordlhiDs adjourned. In the House of Cornmons the report upon the Address was brought up and agreed to, after some observations by Mx. HDFmITD and Mr. RaIsoor. On the motion that the House at its risng do adjourn until Monday, Mr. LiNDsAx made certain inquiries of the Firer Lo"n of the AMiRALTTrY with reference to the steam. ships Transit, Perseverance, aud Urgent, which, it had been alleged, were bailt by Memrs. MAI and Co., and had been spoilt in the hands of the Ad miralty. He asked whether the aegatios respec- ing these vesels which had appeared in the newspapers were wholly or in part true ? Mr. BENTioK drew attention to reports having reference specificaUy to the Transit. Sir C. WooD gave long aud detailed explanations with regard to the three vessels, vindicating the Admiralty and the public departments from any blame on account of the accidents which had befallen the Transit. He hoped, he said, that what he had stated would induce caution and forbearance in the publication of such statements as those referred to by Mr. LmDs.&Y. After a few remarks by Admiral WALoo, the motion for adjournment was agreed to. Sir G. GRey moved for and obtained leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Acts of the 16th and 17th years of Hzg MAJESTY, to substitute in certain cases other punishment in lieu of tranSportation. Mr. LABounmmp moved for the reappointment of the select committee to consider the state of those British possessions in North America which are under the administration of the Hudson's Bay Company, or over which they posses3 a license to trade. The motion was agreed to, after some remarks by Mr. ADDERLzy and Mr. WYLD. On the motion of Mr. WTsow, a select commIttee was appointed to asist the SP3AXZ in all matterx which related.to the printing eXecuted by order of that House, and for the purpose of selecting and armging for.printing. returns and papers presented in pursuance of motions made by members. MIr. DuNior obtained leave to bring in a Bill to provide for the regiitration of long leae in Sot. land and assignations thereof; -r. ADDUay, a Bill for establishing industrial schools in England and Wale; and M. CaAmRD, a Bill to render .judgment3 or decreets obtained in certain courts in England, Scotland, and Ireland respectively effectual in any other part of the United Kingdom. The House adjourned at a-quarter paxt 6 ocelock, until Monday.
According to the fable, Chanticleer led the maids such a life of it by calling them out of bed before dawn that they put their heads together and silenced him for good. The next morning they slept long enough, but their mistress, rising late and finding them all abed, gave them nearly as much as they had given poor Chanticleer. We have only to suppose Hm MAJESTY's domestics reducing the Press to silence, and we may foresee the inevitable result. Instead of being kept to their duty they begin to enjoy repose. A sweet lethargy creeps on their senses, and their eyelids yield to forgetfulness. A Military appointment has to be made. A friendly tongue, in persuasive accents, recommends a mau who 'will give no trouble. The Minister, under a soft illusion that one soldier is as good as another, so as he be a gentleman, yields to - his charmer, and sends a respectable regimental officer on the errand of a CLnr: or a NArxn. A war, fertile in disastrons experiences, is just over, and complacency reigns in our arsenals and dockyards. On a new emergency ships are wanted; routine resumes its easy sway, and as fast as ship after ship leaves our ports, freighted with whole regiments, the old story of " accidents" is renewed. Scarce a day passes which does not bring tidings of ships leaking, putting back, or putting in, with many feet of water, requiring repairs to hull, or machinery, or rigging, and losing days of precious time. They have not started in a hurry; for, after all our supposed experience, and improvement, and preparation, we buckle on our armour for this new enterprise quite as slowly as if we had never proved it before. Well, suppose the conspiraey successful, and our tongues tied. Suppose no journal courageous enough to insert even letters, taking the Ministerial view that they are the complaints of poor whining, ignorant creatures, what would be the infallible result ? The fable warns us. Failures of aU sorts would be slurred over. Should truth ever reach the War Department or the Admiralty, a friendly pen would never be wanting to anticipate " exaggeration," and blunt the edge of ill news. Disaster after disaster, neglect after neglect, would occur and be forgotten, till the nation, opening its eyes some day to the general bankruptcy of achievement, would reason roughly, but truly enough, that something must be wrong, and that the only way was to get rid of the present men and try new ones ;-new Generals and Admirals, new Ministers, a new system, a new Parliament, a new constitution-any novelty in preference to a tenour of ill success. We are supposed to be a sort of wreckers, reaping our harvest from dister ancd waiting upon in-fortune. We are charged even with setting down to the credit of departments that average of casualty certain to all people and a condition of human life. But is it so? Do Cu-NARDs steamers regularly return to port half waterlogged, or alternately run for protection or refit into some friendly port after a few days' sailing ? Is the Bay of Biscay so much worse than the rest of the Atlantic, and how do packet-ships and merchautmen meet what we are told is the usual result of a week's rough weather on new rigging? Thousands of ships cross the Atlantic every year, often in the very roughest weather, yet nature has provided no Corunna or Vigo between Cape Clear and Boston. The piston of the huge engine of a CuxAnD or a CoL. I.Ns steamer never ceases its motion from the moment it rises at the moorings in the Mersey to the moment when the steam is blown off at New York. Yet it is a venial affair that the Transit, with 600 or 700 men on board, should drift upon her own anchor and put back to Portsmouth in a sinking state. Then, she does not roll, and the people who write letters to say that she does are land lubbers, suffering] the usual depression of spirits after a short sea voyage. It appears, indeed, on Sir CBI.ES WOOD'S own figures, that the Transit, while 100 feet longer than the Satellite, with which it is compared, is only 14 inches broader in the beam. She is, then, at least likely to roll; and, though the commander, master, and carpenter, in the report, declared that she rolls " easy," we are not surprised at the qualification that, though easy, she rolls " deep ;" deep enough, no doubt, for the soldiers on board. But every one knows that the effect of deep rolling on a ship originally constructed for lightness would be to open the seams and disclose any weaknees of timbers. Sir C. WooD states what we are ready to believe,-that the masts and sails of this vessel are lighter than those intended by its builders. But, as the poop has been increased, and the fore part of the vessel covered over, to afford greater accommodation to the ship's company, the result must be a balance of conflicting alterations; and, if we have no formula for ascertaining which way the difference lies, we are not so very unreasonable in taking the evidence of the sick soldiers that in bad weather the ship rolls like a tub, lets in water at every seam, and does not leave a hammock dry. Sir CiARIE3 WOOD only offers conflicting considerations, whereas their testimony is decided and clear, and even military officers know whether a hammock is wet or dry as well as Sir CHAIR.zS WOOD. The case of the sster ship, the Urgent, which so sadly belies its name, we are content to leave to the letter of the gentleman quoted by Sir CHLuEs, who anticipates " exaggerated " accounts." It is beyond our depth to dive into the mystery of " leaden joints" and "washers," " blowing-off pipes" and "Kingston "valves ;" nor can we see why these or anything else need be "blown out" or "blown off" by any slight cause, or why the pipe should have been divided by which the water from the boilers was driven into the sea. A pipe with this imuportant office ought not to be at the mercy of accident; nor ought a large ship with 800 men on board, and only boats for S00, to be at the mercy of any small substance, such as a bit of wood or of coal, that might choose to insinuate itself " through the " ingstons," and temporarily prevent their closing after blowing off. We don't hear of these things on board the Transatlantic packet steamers, for the simple reason that if one of them were found wsith the water nearly up to the engine fires, and no account to be given but a speculation on the possibility of a bit of wood or coal having pased, as they say, the wrong way down the throat, the suspicious and selfish public would immediately make a note of the ship liable to these mysterious casualties, and quietly abstain from taking their passage by it. The sequel shows, too, that the public would have been perfectly right.. The- commanding officer of the Urgent sends these ingenious speculations from Corunna, and wishes his chiefs to infer that the trivial nature of the accident suggested no fear as to the future., The ship was, however, obliged in a few da&y to put into Madeira, on leaving which she again broke her engine gear. After - one more attempt at ateaming she broke it a third time, and finally had to finish her voyage to Barbadoes under gail, and with a leak at her stern which it required the continual work of 30 men to keep down. Which, then, was justified by the result-tho Captain's ingenious explanations, or the "exaggerated accounts" they were intended to anticipate ? Sir CHARLES WOOD very civily repeats one of his usual expressions about "the imagination of " the writers in the newspapers," which he appears to think tho inexhaustible source out of which all the casualties of his department arise. Yet when we have ventured to disregard the gay, airy tone, in which Sir Cn.sAxES discusses these matters, and the "amusement" which he professes to derive from " these attacws," we cannot help asking, what does he really deny? What does he refer to imagination? Does he call it an illusion of the fancy that the 'Urgent, for example, went on steaming, breaking down, leaking frightfully, putting in, brealing down, putting in, breaking down, stopping to mend, breaking down, stopping again finally, sailing, leaking, pumping, and so at last arriving at Barbadoes? On the other hand, was not the commanding officer7s story of the little bit of wood or coal pure imagination ? Was it a baseless fabric of fancy in the soldiers on board the rlansit that they were all wet to the skin, and that not a hammock was dry ? Sir CHAnLEs, with great pomp, announces a contradiction, and then tells a story which is no contradiction at all, or at the most some ingenious theory of a nature to elude every possible test. We beg to say, once for all, that we are prepared for accidents; we are ready to excuse them; and we expect an average quantity,-sometimes an excess. But we do not call it an " accident" that when peace was only proclaimed a year ago, and all our ships from that date have been coming into harbour with all their defects fully known, after the lapse of eight or nine months, any explanation, any excuse, any apology should be found necessary for the ships Employed in conveying HEm kaEs7xs troops to a new scene of war.
Lord CAPtB2L' has promptly fulfilled his promise of bringing the Law of Libel again before the attention of Parliament. As we are entirelyconvinced of his Lordship's impartiality, and as we are ourselves conscious of our own desire to see this subject considered, not in the assumed interests of journalism alone, but on behalf of the publc at large, we should rejoice at nothing more sincerely than to find ourselves coinciding with Lord CA3PBr in his estimate of the question. We hope, indeed, and believe that this may ultimately prove to be the case, for the opinions which his Lordship has expressed admit of a very near approximation to the immunities with which journalism could afford to be content. Our argument is, that the practice of reporting the speeches and proceedings of public meetings, being notoriously recognized in fact, and confessedly beneficial in operation, should not carry with it, when faithfully, duly, and properly exercised, any liability arising from the matter reported. We are content that the character of the meeting and the general colour of the report should be open to strict scrutiny. If the meeting could be pronounced not really a public one; if the proceedings were not intended to be reported; if the report was affected in any manner by private instead of public interests; or if, in short, any motive whatever, apart from the performance of professional duty, could be shown to have operated in producing or qualifying the publication, we are content that profesaional privilege should no longer be pleadable, and that the consequences should faU on the head of the offender. We take our Btand upon the publicity of the meeting, and the bond fide character of the report, fairly appreciated. If these points cannot be substantiated let the responsibility rest with the newspaper; but if they can let the speaker, and not the newspaper, be accountable for what is said. A man who speaks in public now-a-days dictates to a reporter. The publication of the speech is as much his own act as its delivery. He addresses himself to the whole country as completely and as deliberately as if he took his speech to a printer and sent it out as a pamphlet, with his name on the titlepage. He knows that reporters are present for the express purpose of committing his speech to paper, and sending it to press for circulation. He sees them at their work, and not only does he accept the condition with all its consequences, but in many instances his speech is addressed more to these very functionaries than to any other part of his audience. We admit all the difference between spealdng slander and printing it; between the possible smallness of the injury in the former case and its possible magnitude in the latter; between the freedom which may be claimed for private conversation and the restrictions which ought to attend a public harangue. What we say is, that the whole of this difference, be it what it may, is chargeable to the speaker himself, and to no others. He, and he alone, in every sense of the word, is the utterer. The reporter represents nothing but a speaking-trumpet, through which, by the aids of science, a single voice can be made to echo over the entire kingdom. And now what harm, we ask, would be likely to accrue to society or to any class or institution of society if these principles were recognized ? We have already said that we are willing to have the subject considered independently of any interests which might be supposed peculiar to the press itself. We are ready to appeal to the common advantage-to the public good, and from this point of view we ask to be shown any mischief that can arise from the protection of reporters honestly engaged. Would speakers bo more careful in speaking? That, certainly, could be no disadvantage. Tho question concerns offence given by words injurious to public ordor or private reputation, and tho argument is, that this offence becomes greater when tho words are printed. But an offenee it is in either case, and if, therefore, the chance of committing tho greater offence should induce the speaker to avoid even the less, it would clearly be so much the better for all. But Lord CAIPBHLL appears to thinkl that these privileges of reporting might lead to rongs witbout remedies. If the publication of seditiolis or libellous matter is visitable on a journal, the cffending parties are always to be reached by prosecution, whereas the original utterer of the matter might take himself out of the way while his words were circulated, and the evil wrought, with entire impunity. His Lordship has even suggested that a public meeting might be got up for an occasion, that a man might utter his sedition or his slander, put it in course of publication, and then fly the country, while the law was left at fault and powerless. But now, to take this extreme case of a joint offence by some desperate revolutionist and some equally desperate print, what would be the probable results of such an operation? Why, by Lord CAsrPBE'S own assumption, the country would be rid of a miscXiiefmaker on remarkably easy terms. Observe, that as even the print supposed to be at his WMc aI obliged to publish his name and fx him with the responsibility of the speech, he ix at once identified as the offender. His words are brought home to him without the troublesome instrumentality of a Government shorthand writer, such a uaed to be employed, and he must either remain to abide the consequences, or rid society of his presenco and agitation once and for all. What more coull be done if he had been caught and convicted ? Lot us be permitted, however, to add one word from our ow, point of view. Asuming still this extreme case supposed by Lord CLWaBn;, what would be the probable character of a journal which should lend itself to this style of reporting, -for, of course, if a meeting is to be "got ups in the manner imagined, the conductors of a journal could hardly be in ignorance of the ciromnstance ? And, if the character of a journal is not worth much, what is its influence -worth? In other words, what would be its powers of mischief, or the real harm of the publication at all ? It cannot be too constntly recollected in these discussions that when a journal offends against the good sense and good feeling of the country it exposes itself to punishment far more condign and more summary than could be administered by any court of law. Its very existence is at stake, for a journal is the mere creature of circulation, and circulation is the expression of public approval. There is no obligation upon a newspaper to consider every meeting a public meeting which so entitles itself, or to reporb every speech which a speaker wishes to be reported. If the speaker, the subject, and the occasion do indeed possess public importance, then of course the proceedings deserre publicity, and under such conditions publicity would probably do far less harm than suppression; but in ordinary cases the conductors of a journal can exercise their own discretion, and it is by such discretion, among other qualities, that a journal is judged. We venture to say that the end of any such proceedings as Lord CAMPBxL has imagined would be the speedy nullification of the speaker and newspaper together. To what conclusion, then, must we come ? At present reports are protected in the cases of courts of Law, and Lord CAMrBErLr avows his very honourable desire to extend the privilege to Parliamentary reports also. He has further suggested that the protection might reach, perhaps, to the reports of Convocation, to those of county meetings, and of town-council meetings in boroughs; so that the ground for drawing the line would constantly recede -a difficulty which we imagine his Lordship must have felt as he proceeded; for, at last, though he observed that " it would be unsafe to extend the " privilege without some limitation," he said that it " might be given to reports w2hich were for thc "public good, leaving that point for a jury to "decide." Now, with this last condition, construed, as we have no doubt it is meant to be, in a liberal sense, we are disposed to close. It is putting a good deal in a jury's hands, but by the honest opinion of our countryren we should be prepared to abide. We are willing that a journal should be put upon its defence for any charge of malice or imputation of any motive not included in fair professional obligation; but when it can be shown that this duty has not been exceeded, we ask to be relieved at once and altogether from liabilities which in justice can only attach to others.
A correspondent, who signed himself "T Tu"c PRASTUS," called attention very properly a day or two ago to another side of that unfortunate subject which we have lately discussed. We pointed out a mistake in our system with respect to young womeu-an important defect in their training. But there are men as well as women in the world. Is everything right in our system as regards its effect upon mem? We say in our system. We know, of course, that natural passion is strong, and that it never will completely obey reason and conscience on this subject as long as the world la~tz. But, over and above natare, is there not something in our system, in our conventional standard of what is necessary to -support married life, which throws enormous and gratuitous hindrances in the way of marriage, and so gives a great gratuitous stimulus to vice? Do we not make difficulties for ourselves here, even where nature makes none, and create by our system a huge mass of artificial temptation which need never have existed ? It is thought impossible in a large class of society now to marry unless you have 1,0001. or 1,5001. a-yewr. This is considered the rule. A person who dares to contemplate this step upon a more scanty basis is told that he does so on his own responsibility. The collective wisdom of society is against him. The horrors of poverty are before him, famine stares him in the face, and, what is still worse, he, his wife, and family will all be a burden upon their friends. In fact, it is wrong, plainly wr6ng, a positive sin, to marry upon less; you are seeking your own selfish happiness at the expense of the comfort, and probably the purse, of your relations, on whom you will very likely have to fall back soon, and to whom, at any rate, it will be a positive pain to see you struggling on in a wretched way, hardly keeping your head above water, and, in fact, having only-dreadful to think of !-enough to eat, and drink, and be merry with. In studied language you are told that you must consult your position in society in taking this step, that you are accustomed to a certain style of living, and that you must not think of being happy without it. Now, we are not going to cry up " love in a "cottage;" we know that a certain income is necessary for comfort and happiness. But, when a whole class is completely scared from marriage by maxims of this kind, we must draw the distinction betvreen a natural and a conventional standard of what a marred man requires. It is not necessay for happiness that a man shlould livo in a houso near the Parla, or that ho should even k-cop a ltua torvwut or a broughani, or that ho should ride in flcttet. row, or mtat he should rush down with hig fogy every three nontlhs by railway to ll tonx 'or Hastings, or Dover, for the benefit of his heglth. Vo assert this wit eonflideceo. Ou ropnet have a vAst array of seial auth6lities vo their SiM6 of tho question. They eu brinig an itpositg [muster of club age; they ean quote oonenstio6Al rules aud dado from the oreCles of Picadilty, Pall-mall, and SK JaM4se-st.reet. W,e, teoo mrv not wvholly witlhout maximn anid wa" on ouir ha.d of the question with espe, ,to wvhat constitute human happitess, fot we hav& at onr commatnd tho colleotive experience which has spaoi-n from tho days of the Seven Wrise Jen to )r. Jour;so;'s, and front the Pr1overbs of S4toxow to tho Proverbs of lAwrxTI '1\prPtt. But convenitionul nraxInst had authoritiea would not have so 8mtchll influeneX As they have upon our young men on this subject were thero not tomething to aid tholm in the attractions of the bachelor lifo itself. A man is uked out ten times as much before he is married as ho is after- rards. That is a great difference, and the man of 30, 'who has enjoyed threo or four years of exuberant hospitality, has felt his value as a eomweenntc member of the social system, and that, as an unencunbered man, he is in great request, is rather loth to exchange the importance and rank of the young bachelor for the homely position of the married man. How pleasant it is to receive several n U-Q9 invitation every post, to bo a4ked to a great many more placesthiutyou can-go toI WhAt a sns of sociil dignity rises at the thought! All thbe woridagoing after you anad humbly soctiog yowr countenance, while you have only to pick teoo out of the number for your patronA,9% an)d to endure the bore of accepting their attentis U- -All thi is versy pleasant. - It is true that , q allhiu. glory and gaiety of the bachelor life thel6 rt iwil occional1y betray a gentle sad:ue% gh' will ape as a vision of a home 'and t tt which, it implies crosses the mind of our mu&-ioliWite young bachelor. But he:' isake4 it' off;' an4 ruhes into the blaze of society again. If he is not really married he can at any rate oonsole him' self with being married in imagination, or, -as the scholastic ,phrase was, in potentid, to tventy young ladies, anra twenty fresh ones every day. - Wat is marriage to such a persou asthis but monaticimi It is retirement to a cloister, to a hermitage in thei desert, and a cell in the rock. But, whichever of these causes has most shire in the undue postponement of marriage by a large olass among ua)-whether it is that young men are -fightened by the imposing show of convenitional authorities and the prophecies of poverty that they hear on all sides, or whether it is that they want to enjoy longer the freedom and popularity of the bachelor estate,. the result is the same in either case.: A great law of PIOVIDEXNO cannot be neglected with impunity, and this undue, artificial, aud unnatural postponement of m ag. ends in 'a great blot -upon our social system. Vice is the result, and vice creates a clas of victims to indulge it. If PuovIDZXCa has ordained that man should not live alone, and if conventional maxims or mere empty fashion and. the atificial attractions of society lead to overlooking, or superseding, or tampering with this law, the neglect of a ProVidential law aill surely avenxge itself in social disease and corrup. tion in one or other part of the system. It is not, then, because we wish for a moment to encourage improvident marriages, but because we feel convinced that our modern caution here has outstepped all reasonable limits,- has become extravagant has from being a dictate of natural common sense become a mere conventional and artificial rule, the voice of empty fashion, and a gratuitous hindrance to social happiness and the designs of PtOVmDENcx, that we call serious attention to this subject. The fear of'poverty has become morbid, and men cry out not only before they are hurt, but before there is any reasonable proqpect of it. They must see in married life a perfectly guaranteed and undisturbed vista of the amplest pecunisry resources before they will enter upon it. They forget that married men can work, and that marriage is a stimulus to worl, and again and again elicits those latent activities of mindwhich produce not only competency, but affluence. Let us take the case of two great lawyers. Lord CoTTynas formed early in life the resolution not to marry till his practice was 4,0001. a-year, and he married at forty. Lord ELDON married upon nothing at twenty-one. We do not recommend the Iatter case for general adoption, but the two examples taken together show how absurd it is to lay down such stringent rules as are now fashionable on the subject of marriage. The issue is the same, under the most opposite eircumstanees, because both men were workers, and Lord ConTra'NM was not aided by his late marriage, and Lord ELDON was eer tainly not impeded by his early one.
Mr. STAP=Eow; has addressed a letter to the electors of Berwick in defence of his conduct as a Director of the Royal British Bank. Had it not been for this public challenge we certainly should. not have bestowed any more especial notice upon Mfr. STAPLETON'S case than upon that of any other of his fellow Directors; but it is his own choice to invite discussion. What, then, does his defenee amount to? Simply to this-" that "he never borrowed one shilling of the "money of the Bank, or disposed of a single "share." At the same time, he informs the electors of Berwick that he had become a Director of the concern, and therefore, as Director and Shareholder, was liable for its defalcations. This might have been an accident-a misfortune-what you will ; but what was Alr. STAPLETON's conduct, upon his own showing, when he found himself in this disagreeable predicament? He acted to the best of his ability in the interest of the shareholders, and therefore in his own. He writes:- " My belief was that only a portion of the capital sabacribed by the shareholders had been lost, that it was a question of the shareholders' interest only, and that depositors were perfectly safe. Acting on this belief, no unpre. judiced person will doubt that, had .I uceded in effecting an arrangemn waih anwther bank (such as has been lately made in the cae of the Eastern Bank), tae interests of depo. iors and shardwders would hare been promoted in the most effectual manner, instead of being aggravated by loses con. sequent on a realization in bankraptcy and a wasteful erpenditure in law proceedings." We cannot, however, forget that less than a month before the British Bank broke, that famous, or rather infamous, circular was issued, under the auspices of the Board, of which Mr. STA oxroX was a prominent member, inviting such of the shareholders as had accounts with the Bank to increase their accounts, and such shareholders as had not accounts to open accounts, and entreating either class to use their best exertions to procure fresh accounts from the general public. Call Mir. STAPLrroN deny this letter? If not, with what face can a man who, upon his own admission, was one of a body which attempted to practise this gross frud upon the public come before his constituents and askl for absolution? It is idle for Mr. STAPLETON to asert that he made certain weak remonstrances in opposition to the measures proposed and adopted by the fraudulent majority. When those weak remonstramces were overruled he quietly acquiescea, and thus bectmeparticeps criminis. If two mien comnit a crimo conjointly, who is to know that FA,,x- bad previously remonstrated with tmtm ,Sxs t ihe crime in the ams of the British Na was etvi*lly comnmitted, and although MIr. Sk?riEow did not, like somo of the others, steal money from tho till, he did his beat to entice otfiers into a osition which. would have eaed his olm Uabilitim. Morally speaking, is this not dbu,in& t As far as the legal effect of his acts is oaernaed we are glad to henr that it is noir under tho consideration of the Law Officers of the CRowNNN.

IBLA ND. - NATIONAl EDCATION STATf-rTiq (1Rom ou1 ow COrnrESPONÂ£NDT.) DUBT.IN 1;'.- l At the usual monthly meetin, of the Belfast Presbytery this week the Rev. 'William Johnstone zsubmitted a reportj which had been prepared by a -committee, in accordance with the directions of the General Assembly, in regard to education. The *coimittee were directed to report on five heads, and among other information obtained it appeared that with reference to national schools under Presbyterian patronage, there were within the Belfast Presbytery district 66, attended by 1,221 children of the Fstablished Cburch, 611 Romana Catholics, 4,181 Presbyterians, and 216 of otber denominations, giving a total of 6,229 children. There -was also one school under joint Presbyterian patronage, containing 166 Episcopalians, 234 Roman aCatholics, and 125 Presbyterians, making in all 525; ,then there were 49 national schools inder other maagement, containing 859 Episcopalians, 3,441 2Roman Catholics, 1,573 Presbyterians, and 110 other -denoirnn,-tions, making in all 5,983. The general -total showed 116 national schools, attended by 2,246 Episcopalians, 4,286 Roman Catholics, 5,879 Presbyterians, and 326 of other denominations, making the entire number of children at the schools 12,737. The report embodied a number of suggestions or 'recommendations, one of which was to this effect:- "'That, as the admirable system of English education provided by the National Board has almost superseded all other schools throughout the rural districts, and a very 'Urgent neceswsty exists for the cultivation of classics throughont the country, this Presbytery is of opinion that very important and effeotive aid can be, and should be, rendered in this matter by the Commissioners of National Educationi and, that a commlittee shall be appointed to take ach steps mn this matter as they may see necessary, and to .press tins subject upou the inmnediate attention of the COinonissioners aud the Government." AGQItIULmLTRL FROGRRSS. Notwithstanding the continutance of a cald sasterly wind the accounts from the provinces are htopeful, and the cessation of the rain, aided by a aot sun, has effected quite a magical change on the face of the country generally. The Banner of 7Tter thus reports:- " The very favourable vweather of the last few days has e'ffected quite a magical change on the face of the country. We have not yet zot the length of having steam ploughs in the north of Ireland, but the progress of out-door labour runs an else to the rapid movement of steam as horsepower aud human ene could pos.ibly accomplish. Men are at work in the fielda from daylight till sunset, and in some parts of the country the relay system is practised with great sucss. Oat sowing is fast being finished in thehighlying and drained lands. A good breadth of barley has also been got into the ground in excellent order, and potato planting is pushed on with the same remnarkable energy. We have been told by an old farmer that the quantity of labour done within the last four days exceeds anything ever before nown, and, as vegetation is at present exceedingly active, we trust tbat in a few weeks the season will be well forward, Early-sown oats look well, except in places where the land lay low, and where the rains affected the young plants. Those farmers who were so fortunate as to get their oats finished drig the fine weather in February have now excellent brairds, well up. and strong in the blade. The early-planted potatos look very favourably, and on some lands the plants are ready for moulding. These caes, however, are rare. In general, the extent of early finish in potato cultivation is much under the average, but the total breadth of land under the national esoulent will probably be much above that of last year. Wheats, spring as well as autumn sown, look healthy and well-coloured. Artificial grasses are much more forward than they were ia the first week of May last year. Clover lands appear to get on rapidly. Flax sowing is still far behind. A good deal .has been got in and finished in the neighbourhood of Arnagh, Banbridge, and Warinratown, but as a whole the labour of flax lands is much behind tiat of recent seasons." RSVESE OF FORTUNE, One of the country papers states that among the competitors for tho clerkship of the Abbeyleix Poorlaw Union was a gentleman who had spent 5,0001. in contesting the representation of the Queen's County with Sir Charles Coote, one of the present ,menbers, and was only defeated by a majority of 11 votes; he was, moreover, a magistrate of the county -and a Master of Arts in Trinity College, Dublin. None of those circumstances, however, were of any avail, and the appointment thus coveted was won by a person in comparatively humble life. ISXPORTArION OF PoTrATO.S. It appears from the Mayo papers that the demand for potatoes for exportation to England is so great that the supplies at markets are quite unequal to the wants of the purchasers. The BaUlincz Herald says :- "Alreadv several small cargoes of potatoes have been shipped to England from the Eillala bay, all purchased in 3alna, and some vessels are now waiting to be loaded. :Prices have, in consequence of this demand for potatoes for exportation, been greatlyadvanced, and the poorolasseslnthe town, whose ownv supply is run out, and who depend largely for their subsistence on the weekly market of potatoes, find it difficult to compete with the agents for the export trade. This, of course, has caused considerable dissatisfaction. In any case the mere idea of removing otut of the country its staple food would be sufficient to ereate a popular storm; but when the potato is taken when the pnces of other provislows are high, and when even all that remains in the count2y of them is scarcely equal to our own requirements, the indignation of the people may be well conceived. It has not, however, found a greater vent than in complaints, which are pretty numerous and loud. Nor do we apprehend any of those demonstrations of popular displeasure which have attended the purchases in -other quarters of quantities of the potato for exportation. We had fortunately a large sowing last year and a plentiful return, and as yet no actual inconvenience has been felt, except that arising from the advance in price." THE FUNDS. Three per Cent.

MIs. SPXA.XII IN JEOPARDY.-Among the nuanerous incidents that have occurred during the few days the House of Commons has beon swearing in the members, one happened yesterday that was very near resulting in an dnpleasant detention of the Speaker in his chair for mn Indeinite period. The swearg8 in of the members was pretty brisk in the early part of the day, but as it drevw near 4 o'clock the groupasthat came up to take the oaths and ' subscribe the Parliamentary roll became " small by degrees mud beautifuly lese," untilthe last one only numbered three. As they were ntroduced to Mr. Speaker they passed round y the back< his chair and left the House. The last one tnat was pAtatd was Mr. W. W. F. Hume, the member for Wicklow, and after the formal introduction was over he stayed chatting with the Spealcer for about three minutes, xind vas about leaving the House, when Sir Denis Le WMarchant called the Speaker's attention to the fact that there was not another member present to move the adjournzaent of the House. Mr. Hlume was accordingly requested -to return and do tbat kind offce for the Speaker, or he would have been unable to leave the chair unt ome hbon. meit-ercouldbooepro Ator4eal im. Mr. jjms at once returned, and taking hi stand at theTreasury b3nches, said, " Mr. Speaker, I move that this House do now adjourn." There being no member present to move an nmenduje,,t on this motion, it wan carried by the mover,and the Speaker retired.-Globe- T-o MILwONS oP TosS OF SXvLB.-The ooean holds dissolved two milions of tons of silver. To three 'French chymists the dscovery is due. They took gallons of -water from the coast of St. halo, a few leagues from laud, and analyzed it in two trays. A portion of the water they .acted upon by the usual tests for silver; and the presence of the precious metal was clearly ascertained. The remainder of the water they evaporated, and the salt they obtained they boiled with lead. This gave theuv a button of irpure lead. which they subjected to what is termed cupella Uion.

AMERICA. L4 summary of tho following, received by oleddu toLG GraPh, appeared in our second edition of yesterday :-J LIVERPOOL, FRIDAY, MxAy 8. The Canadian Royal Mail Steam Navigation Conpangys steamer Canadian, Captain Ballantyne, arrived to-day with advices from Portland to the 25th, and from New York (by telegraph) to the evening of the 24th ult. The Royal mail steamship America and the screw steamsbip City of Glasgow had arrived at Halifax, and the screw steamship Chersonese at Portland. The steam-frigate Niagara had not left the offing of New York up to the 24th. Before sailing for England sbe would, it was understood, make atrial trip to Norfolk. A despatch from Halifax announces the passing by the House of Assembly of a Bill giving to the Atlantic Submarine Telegraph Company the exclusive privilege for 25 years of landing a submarine telegraph cable from any part of Europe on any part of the shores of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. At the annual dinner of the St. George's Society of New York, Lord Napier, who was present as a guest, responded as foUows to the toast of " Her Majesty's Ministers and representatives on this continent" - " Gentlemen,-I beg to offer you my very sincere and cordial tbanks for the honour which you have done me in associating my name with the toast and with the health of ' Her 3Majesty's Ministers.' Her Mtajesty's Ministers wil be highly gratified when theylearn that their names and their officers are held in such esteem, regard, and memory by their fellow-coutrymen residing in the United States. I, myself, gentlemen, in my own personal capacity, am serniblo that I am undeserving of the accdamations which you have deigned to bestow upon my name; but I see in the manner in which you have received it a warm revulsion of those feelings of sympathy and regard which may be suspended or obscured for a time, and by accident, between America and England, but which are ever deeply founded on the affections andathe interests of the two countries. (Loud cheers.) The office which I have the happiness to fill, and in which you have done me the honour to wish me well, is one which has been familiar to my hopes and wishes from a very early period of my life and services. I may still maintain that there is not a more grateful, a more glorious, or a more useful employment than this employment, which I share with my venerable friend, the United States' Minister in London-the employment of holding aloft the ensigns of peace and frie ndehip between the two great branches of the English race. (Loud cheers.) I feel that I entered uponthatemploymenthere at a most auspicious period. I can assure you that I have met, upon the par of the President of the United States, upon the part of General Cass, upon the part of all the Ministers and funotionaries of the United States with whom I have been brought into contact, every manifestation of that cordial and friendly disposition which animates the Government and the community of Great Britain. (Cheers.) There are no questions involving any degree of anxiety or apprehension pending between the two coantries (cheers); and I am sometimes disposed to hope that tho time may soon come when there will scarcely be any subjeots of official correspondence atalL (Cheers.) If I may not flatter myself withthisagreeable prospect of official vacuity (laughter), if I must look forvward to my fair and natural share of discussions and debates, srely, gentlemen, we have in the experience of the past the best grounds for believing that there can never be a question so difficult or so complicated that it may not meet with a prompt, with a peaceful, and with an honourable solution. (Loud cheers.) There are many quesUons at once envenomed and alarming which have been settled in a pacific manner in our recent negotiations. Our eastern boundaries have been defined by one treaty. Our western boundaries have been settled by another. The disputed fisheries, which at one time threatened to embroil us, have been converted, by the salutary engagements of reciprocity, into a source of mutual wealth. Finally, gentlemen, the question of the privilegesof neutral trade in time of war- that question which for so long was the constant cause of complaint and recriminations, has now obtained, by the spontaneous declarations of Her Majesty's Ministers during the late hostilities, that liberal interpretS. tion so often desired by the United States, and which no Government of England hereafter will ever be inclined to evoke or to repeal. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I am justified, then, in saying that by an easy exercise of frankness, of mutual forbearance and indulgence, no question can arlse between our countries which will not admit of an easy and an amicable settlement. But, gentlemen, I desire more than cordiality-I desire co-operation. (Cheers.) Now, gentlemen, I do not wish to alarm the citizens of the 'United States who are here present by raising before their averted eyes the phantom of " entangling alliances." (Laughter and cheers.) Entangling alliances, gentlemen, are a kind of political spectre which seems to have descended with undiminished terrors from the period of the Revolution to the present day. (Cheers and laughter.) There may be mutual co-operation where there are no written engagements; and gentlemen, where the hearb is wanting, there may be written engagements without mutual co-operation. (Cheers.) A1l, then, that I wish to say is, that our respective Governments should perpetnally make an early and sincere declaraton and avowal to each other of their views and intentions with respect to all subjects which involve the common interests of the two countries (cheers), whereby they Wll have the benefit of mutual good ofices and mutual counsel, and whereby they will be able to avoid these onesided resolutions and those startling announeoments which are apt to disturb the confidence of commeroe and calon. hated to excite the sensibilities and jealousies of two high. spirlted nations. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, the only entangling alliance which I shall venture to recommend to your adoption is the submarine cable between this country and Eng. land. (Great laughter and cheering.) My friend, the hon. chairman, has been so kind as to allude in terms of glowing eulogy and encomium to the services which members of my family have been enabled, in former times and generations, to offer to their Sovereign and country either in the departments of science or in those of war. The sincerity with which that encomium was pronounced, and tho manner in which those observations were received, are cer. tainly exceedingly gratifying to my own pride; and all this is an additional incentive to me to endeavour to render myself not unworthy of those services which were performed by members of my family upon previous occasions. (Cheers.) I cannot flatter myself that I possess any peculiar fitness or any local experience which could enable me to perform the duties of Her Majesty's Minister in a distinguished manner. Bat this I can asare you, that I undertake those duties with the highest satisfaction and with the happiest anticipations, (Cheers.) Gentlemen, it was some time ago observed in England, and it was repeated in some quarters in America, that the members of the regular diplomatic profession of Great Britain were not qualified by their previous education and experience to contend with the stubborn and masculine elements of Amenl. can politics. (Cheers.) It was supposed, gentlemen, that we were so enured in the petty acts and in the dark practices of " Cabinet intrigue," that we were so accustomed to humble ourselves in the twilight of military courts, that we wore not qualified nor disposed to meet a free people in the light of day. (Loud cheer) Gentlemen, did you observe any symptoms of this intellectual deerepitude In SirRichard Pakenham or in Sir Henry Bulwer2 I have not the honour of having ever served with those distinguished personages, but, in.honour to the profession to which I belong, I sn justified in alleging that in my friend and my former chief, Sir H. Seymour, I never observed any want of vigour or capacity. And, gentlemen, I never observed any wnt of vigour and independence in my later master, Vlscount Strat. ford de Bedeliffe, who ha3 passed 30 year of his indefatigable life in contending against the ambition of arbitrary power In one country and in mitigating its abuses in ano. ther. Gentlemen, I do not wish to say anything unduly end ungratefully depreciatory of any country or of any Government. I have had some experieno of despotic Governmenta. I have lived in Naples, in Turkey, and in Russia. There are elemenbt of happiness in them alL Fortunately, I say, there are elements of kindness, of culture, and of happiness whioh no political sys. tOm whatever can exclude from the face of nature and from the hearts of men. (Loud cheers.) But nelther the retrospective glories of the Italian scene, nor the ancient repose and the picturesque aasociMtions Of Oriental life, nor the splendid enchantments of social life which have arisen in their most agreeable form upon the borders of the Neva, can ever make an Englishman undervalue or forget those principles of freedom which have been cherished by-our common fathers at home, and which by them were sown broxadcast upon the soil of the great American continc:t. iCheers.) Gentlemen, I have, since my arrival, sometimes obseved an impression in the 'United States that the development of this country is regarded with jealousy by England. That is an erroneous opinion. (Cheers.) You will bear me out in the assertion that the last vestigo of former prejudice founded on the animosities of two unhappy wan is being very rapidly extinguished. The peaceful and legitimate expansion of the United Sttes forms a matter of satisfaction aud pride for evory reasonable Englishman. That expasioa forms the bea;.t rAest and relief for our supm?abwhat population, ; iti forms the best market for our inezoasing iadustry X itis the triumph of cur labour and our rnts, of our lst,e o.ua aeligion, sad, gwu blood, I(Loud cheering.) No thoughtul Englishman can contemplate this unparalleled spectacle of future predominance ithout emotions of thankfuless and praise. No 0oughtf`L1 foreigner can regard it without a ggh, :eo,use Providence haa not reservod the future empire cf thtv world for his own tongue and his own race. (Ch().) These sentiments of sympathy and goodwill, to which I give, a feeble utterance, are, believe me, not rare or partial in our Xountry, nor do I derive them from obscure authority. (Efar~, hear.) I have gathered these asntiments in the besevolent at of a Carlisle, inthe wise conclusions f an Abedeen, and i' the eloquent declarations of an Elgin. I have heard the e sentinents declared and enforced from the bench of tke Government, and I have heard them choed back from tbe benches of the Opposition. These sentiments have been incrlcated upon me with sincere and careful emphasia by the PJmrl of Clarendon, and by that noble Viscount who is first in tie councils and in the bearts of the British people. (Immense applause.) Finally, Gentlemen, I have received these sentiments as a Jruitful trust from the hands of my Sovereign, and I will not lay up this profitable talent in a diplomatic napkin." At the close of this speech his Lordship was loudly cheered. The schooner Margaret, a supposed laver, had been seized at New York. A telegraphic despatch from Washington to the Portland papers, under date of April 23, says - " It is understood, on reliable authority, that the action of our Government in increasing our naval force in the watersof theIsthmus meetsthe approvalof Lord Napier, tho British Minister, who was officialy informed of the fact by a note from the State Department, as wcs also Count de Sartiges, Minister from France. The latter, however, as far as can be ascertained, has not signified his assent or dissent to the movement. " The total number of 7essels ordered to tho Isthrus is ten, seven of which will be stationed at Aspinwall, and three at Panama. With so imposing a force our Government Is confident of effecting an early arrangement of the dispute." The Hon. John G. MIontgomery, senator for Danville, Pennsylvania, had died of disease contracted at the NationaL Hotel during the inauguration of President Buchanan. It is stated that the Governorship of Utah had been offered to Major MACulloch. A despatch from Chicago confirms the rumoured massacres in Bliue Earth County. Porty settlers were murdered at Big Bend and several women taken prisoners. The excitement was increasing, as all the Indians beyond the Minnesota had assumed a hostile attitude. Rumours were also rife of an alihance between the Sioux and Chippewa tribes. A workshop in the Maryland Penitentiary had been set on fire by some of the prisoners, whovainly hoped to escape during the confusion consequent upon the alarm. Advices from the city of Mexico to the 4th nlt. report that an intended revolution, instigated by the clergy and,their partisans, badclbeen discovered and suppressed.

| IATE DIJHES O THE ILATE DUICHESS OF GLdrESTER.' On the morning of yesterday the remains 5f. her late Royal Highness the Duchess of Glocesa.r, fourth daughter of His Majesty King George lIL,^ widow of William Frederick Duke of Glocester, and aunt to Her present Majesty, were removed from Glocester.house, Piccadilly, for interment in the family vault, in St, George's Chapel, Windsor. It was the desire of her late IRoyal Highness that her interment shoul3d be conducted in the most private manner posnible, and Her Majesty accordingly sanctioned a ceremonial of as limited a character as was consistent with the observance of that respect which was due toa deceased member of the Royal family. At 9 o'clock a Guard of Howur of the Coldstream Guards was mounted in fron of Glocester-house, whence the body was conveyed to the terminus.at Paddington, followed by the Pages of her late Pcoyal Highness in a mourning coach drawn by four horses; the House Steward and two dre#era of her late Royal Highness also in a mourning coach drawn byfourhorse3; the Chaplainandme attendantsof her late Royal E3ighnesr in amourningcoachdrawnby four horses; the executors of her lateRoyal Highness in a mourning coach drawn by four homs ; the four ladIes Who would support the pall ina mourning coachdrawnbyfourhorses;andthe Vice-Cwhamberlaii of Her Majesty's Household and the Cbmptroller in the Lord Chamberlain's Department. Her late Royal Highness's state carriage followed, n wrhich was the coronet of her late Royal Highness, borne upon a velvet cushion by Colonel the Hon. Agustus Liddell, Comptroller and. Equerry to her late Royal Highness. Afterwards came the hearse, drawn by eight horses.. An escort of the lst Life Gaards accompanied the procession to the Paddington terminus. At the Paddington-station a Guard of :onuar' the Scotch Fusileer Guards was mounted.' The station was crowded by persons who had come together to witness the last passage of one who, in her life, was not more distinguished by rink than by her unostentatious virtues. Upon the arrival of the body at Slough the procession was joined by- The Lord Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household, The Lord in Waiting to Her Majesty, The Groom in Waiting to Her majesty, The Equerry in Waiting to Her Majesty, The Equerry to Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Rent, The Equerry to Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cam- bridge, The Lady in Waiting to Her Majesty, The Bedchamber Woman to Her Majesty, Two Maids of Honour to Her Majesty, The Lady in Waidng upon her Royal Highnew the Duchess of Kent, The Lady in Waiting upon her Royal lHghnens the Duchess of Cambridge, The Lady in Waiting upon her Royal Highness the Here. ditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg Strelitz. A Guard of Honour was mounted at the station, and the procession advanced slowly onward from the station at Slough for a distance of three miles to St. George's Chapel, Windsor, followed by three State carriages conveying the members of Her Majesty's Hlousehold, and also by the State carriages of her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent, her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge, and of his Royal Highness the D)oke of Cambridge. On the procession arriving at the entrance of St. George's Chapel the escort of the Blues, which had joined it at Slough, filed off, a Guard of Honour of the Grenadier Guards being there in attendance. Exactly at 12 o'clock the bell of the Chapel tolled out its solemn note, and the body of her late Royal Highness was borne within the walls of that sacred edifice which for a long series of years has been the consecrated depository of her Royal race. The coffin, which was of mahogany and covered with rich crimson velvet, was placed on tressels, having a black velvet pall, bearing eight heraldic escocheons, over it. At the head of the lid there was a coronet and at the foot the torch of hfe reversed; with massive handles and plates; the whole being intended to represent a splendid casket. It bore the following inscription - " Depositum fllustrissimne Principie Illustrhssimi Principis Gulielmi Proderici, Dncis Glocestia et Edinburgi, Vidue, Et Film eatu Quarte, Augustiimi et Potestissimi Georgil Tertii Dei Gratit Britanniaram Regis, Obiit Tricesimo Del Aprilis, snDCcCLVII Annoque Atatis X The nave through which the funeral procession passed was covered with black cloth, and the floor and also the seats in the choir were covered with the same material, and in front of the readingdesk was an escocheon of the arms of the late Duchess. On the procession moving from the entrance the gentlemen and boys composing the choir of St. George's Chapel comramenced singing the 25th md 26th verses of the 11th Chapter of St. John (" I ana the resurrection"), and when the body reached the choir the 90th Psalm ("Lord, thou hast been our refuge")waschanted. Thecoffln asplaced upon trestes with the feet towards the altar, aud the coronet and cushion were laid upon the coffin. The chief mourner, the Duchess of Atholl sat at the head of the corpse, attended by Lady Nouper. The supporters of the pall-the Hon. Mrs Liddell and Lady Georgiana Bathurst, and Lady Caroline Murray and Lady Charles Somerset sat on either side. The Lord Chamberlain, the Marquis of Breadalbane, stood at the feet, having on his right the Vice-Cham. berlain Lord Ernest Bruce, and on his left the Controiler and Chief Equerry of the late Duchess, Colonel the Hon. Augustus Liddell, and the Controller in the Lord Chamberlain's Department, Mr. Norman Macdonald. Shortly before the arrival of the procession his Royal Highness Prince Albert, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge entered the Chapel, and were conducted to stalls immediately adjoining that of the Sovereign. Prince Albert and the Duke wore the riband and star of the Garter. His Serene Highness Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar was also conducted to a seat. Their Royal Highnesses the Duchess of Cambridge, the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the Princess Mary of Cambridge were in the Royal Closet of the Chapel. Earl Spencer, Lord Steward of the Queen's Rousehold, and the Marquis of Abercorn, Groom of the Stole to the Prince, occupied their respective stalls as Knights of the Garter on opposite sides of the Chapel, and each wore the riband and star of the order. Beneath Lord Abercorn's stall were seated the visitors, friends of the late Duchess-viz., Earl Howe, Viscount Falkland, Lord Redesdale, the Hon. Mr. Waldegrave, Sir William Gomm, Colonel F. H. Seymour (son of Sir George Seymour), Colonel Forster, and Colonel Stephens. On the entrande of the procession in the choir the executors of her Ro*yal Highness the late Duches, the Earl of Verulam, Mr. H. W.

The Lord Chamberlain and the gentlemen of his department remained in the Chapel after the departure of the Royal family, to superintend the closing of the vault.
THE POPULATION OF FRANCB. TO THEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Prowipted' by the iateresting articles which appeared in Te Times some time ago on the present state an prospects of the population of France, I had intended, withyour permisdon, to offer some observations on the subject, but I am afraid that I have allowed the time to go by. Perhaps, however, a few remarks may be considered even yet not out of place. The importance of the subject may be my excuse. The -very small present increase in the population of France is a fact not to be questfoned, whatever fair doubts may be thrown on the accuracy of the tables which showed an apparently more rapid increase in former days, and the only point is what is the cause, and does it afford ground for uneasiness? Under circumstance3 where there is every natul encouragement for a rapid inerease in the numbers of a peoplesuch, for instance, as is the case in the United States of America-an almost stationary condition of the population would no doubt argue something unsound in-their political or social condition, and the truth of such an inference may at once be tested by the present state of many of the other communities of America which possss the same natural advantagesasthe United States, butwhoseprogressislangoid and in some instances not perceptible. In such cases we instinctvely and truly infer the operatlon of a bad Governmnent and defective aocialorganjzation. On the other hand, it is quite poesible to sappose that in an old and til.kl'-peopled4 themoderate increaeof b OUS t w i, t h n o vibeu it o national deter!ort161;`,- ues efthycenit of the wider diffusion of thoseepr'nIntla1priirplea which ought to mark the advance of civilization, and are, as a rWle, the best guarantee for the pecpstsent impepvement of mankind. If such a country has bu few outlets forits opulation, I cannot, in the abstract, coniceive a^more heatby sign than a determanation on the''iArztof the SulL-'of the population so to regulate their numbets asnot-to lo'wer their condition, or to exceedthelegitimate&desnAindforlabour bytoo npid an increase.yoorpda -IsFranceintheposd.itoof uchacount2y? Ithinkthat vith certrn limitations it mnay fairly be saidto beso. There are no great outlets for superfluous numbers, such as exist m the United States, and,even in this country. Twothirds, or rather, perhaps; three-fourths of -the population are purely agricultural; the manufacturing population-as distsnushed from the mere town ?opulahon-is not in itself rge, and has no scopo for rapid increase; the emi. gration is smaL The linhts,thirefore, which surround the great body of the French people ae vell defined and not remote. I - The division of land which took plamc in France at tho firstRevolution tended-and,it was ahappy circumstance, in my opinion-rather to inaprove\ the condition of the pesntry, which it did in aimarkeinanier, than to produxoa verM rapid axgmentAtion or-'numbers. This improved conuition, being both considerableand very general, the French peasantry have,, on.the whote, been able to maintain. To this fact eyi-wi#nekses who have given their attention to the subject gezierailytestify. Can there be a doubt but that this iniproved co^ndition ia mainly attri butablo to the prudential habits of, the people theseolves ? All political economists of eminence, with the exception of 3aithus, have ever said that the reWult of a peasant pro- 'etary in France would h a moderate increase of numr, and the fact is so. Indeed, the condition of Belium, -inhabited by a people simila mn circumstances and in disposition-would have justified the prophecy:- "Eren thie slow increme is w4clnthe e rbect of mardimnto ou deaths; the number of bicth, oitdr Ineadng at all while the eulpoTtlu oP blrLta to the population Is ozitautly dIminIshtng. h silew growth of the numbers of the sop,e, vwhIle capital Increases much iore rapidly,h hs cau.eds aconaoiEjaluemt4provement in Thecenditiouof thelebouicins cL%lsm.MlL . It is unquestionably true that itJie peasant proprietors of France are very circumspect on the pubject of marriage, and also as to the number of children tbech they think should be the result of that state. And Dey are perfectly right. It is the natur result of their pofti ean. "Everypesanat can Satisfy himself, fui6 evidtir- which be can fual recstc, wbether hi, piece of land sanae hacd toenprort saywimile In tho same comef ar In whisb It iptswcw one.

People in this sountry ae too generally inclined to look on athis ontrolling power either with ridicule or as Immorl.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENGB. FrANCE. (7aOX oUR oWN OORBPOITDD1=r.) IA po2tion of the foUodnzg sppe=ed in ou second edi. I>.on ds sztWrdAV:-- Â±L ' A. 'THIRSDAY, MAY 7, 6 P.o. M. Lafragua, the MexiÂ¢an Envoy to Spain, has not yet left Pars; he expects, however, soon to do so, prhaps on Saturday. There is now maore than a probability of a pacific settlement of the question hetween the twvo Goverunments. M. Lafragu. 's latest despatches from his Goverment are described as very satisfactory. Several of the criminals who had at first escaped from justice have been captured, and will no doubt be punished Under these cirÂ¢uxmstances General Narvaez' Administration has a danger the less to provide against. Prince Napoleon left Paris this morning for Berlin. The statement of the Prine's intendedjourney, previouly mentioned, was denied by the Patrie quite as reckessly as, ou the authority of X. MIocquard, thle Emperor's private Secretary, the assertion was that the Prince would not go to meet the Grand Duke Constantine at Toulon. Whether the contradiction of the Patrie in the present instance proceeds from the Emperor's Cabinet or not does not appear, but it does not say much in favour of the source at which the Ministerial paper gets its information. The Prince leaves Paris, no doubt, with the sanction of the Emperor, as the Aides-de-Camp of his father, Prince Jerome, accompany him. There is some rumour about a private mission, but of the truth or natUre of it little is known. It is, at all events, curious that such a moment as this, with the Grand Duke still at the Tuileries, sbould be chosen for the journey. There is a revival of the old story of a matrimonial alliance with some of the German families, but which, perhaps, is entitled to no more credit than the previous ones. The Prince was inclose conference for two hours last night with the Emperor while the Grand Duke "le Petit Nassau" and la 6rande Duchesse dce Bade were listening to the artistes at the Eotel de Ville; and it was immediately after that conference, and probably in consequence of it, that his Highness set out this morning. He will be received, no doubt, with much pomp. He is accompanied by General de Salles, LieutenantColonel Bertrand, and Captain Valdener de Fraudenstein. Two reviews will hb given by the warlike Frederick Willian in honour of his guest-one at Potsdam, and the other at Berlin. The Grand Duke Constantine leaves on the 14th or 15th. The moment his back is turned another Royal person will make his bow to the public, namely, the King of Bavaria, who is expected at Marseilles on the 14th, and at Fontainebleau on the 16th. It will go hard with the Emperor Napoleon if he doss not coax the King of Prussia himself, not to speak of the countless Princes of Germany, to come and (as one of his Ministers said the other day) "incline themselves" before him. The Grand Duke Constantine, in conversation with his friends, expresses himself as pleased with his reception by the Emperor, and as struck with the large views taken by him of the political state of Europe. 8e seems, however, anxious to let it appear that, if he has visited Paris, it was in consequence of the pressing invitation of the Emperor. This he does not say in as many wvords, but there is no doubt of his meaning. He affects to avoid speaking much of the Empress or of the infant Prince, and it is not said that he has manifested much enthusiasm about Prince Napoleon, of whose dislike to Russian alliances and intimacies he is not ignorant. The King of Bavaria would have responded to the Emperor's invitation before this but for some difficulty about etiquette. The Emperor could do no otherwise than receive the Bavarian King as a Sovereign, while he only received the Grand Duke as a Prince; and the Grand Duke probably thinks that the brother and the son of a Czar is worth the whole Germanic Confederation put together. It is therefore arranged that Bavaria shall come after Russia. The Grand Duke was present last night at the fete given by the Municipality of Paris. It consisted of an operatic entertainment, in which some of the principal artistes took part. It was almost in every respect similar to the one offered to the l'lenipotentiaries of the Congress of Paris last year. The grande saUe des fites, where the performance was given, was beautifully lightedup. The (irand Duke remained till 1 o'clock. The Emperor was not present. There were about 1,200 or 1,500 persons invited. The Grand Duke Constantine breakfasted this morning with the Emperor at his private chateau, Villeneuve l'Etang, near St. Cloud. His Imperial Highness afterwards visited the Imperial manufactory at Sevres, and thence proceeded to the Bois de Boulogne, where he witnessed the races got up by the Society for Encouraging the Breed of Horses. Yesterday morning the steam frigate Reine Hortense sailed from the port of Cherbourg for Rochetort, and thence to Bordeaux, to remain at the orders of the Grand Duke Constantine. It is said that the cause of complaint of the French Government against that of China is not only the execution of a French missionary, named Chapdeline, but that the Mandarin who committed that act of barbarity caused the treaty signed between France and the Celestial Empire to be solemnly burnt on a pile of wood. It is now known that the telegraphic despatch announcing that the Court of Teheran had refused to ratify the treaty of peace signed in Paris came from St. Petersburg. It is said in that capital that the Russian Government had sent orders to their Minister at Teheran to insist on certain modifications af the treaty. Private letters from the Roman States of the 29th corroborate the news contained in my letter of Tuesday respecting the intended visit of the Pope to the principal towns of his States. The first visit will, my informant says, be to the celebrated sanctuary of Loretto. His Holiness will then proceed to Ancona, Sinigaglia, and Savillaliatale. He will then traverse the Romagna, and visit Bologna. The telegraphic despatch from Rome which announced officially the visit of the Pope to the Legations has, as I have already informed you, produced a certain sensation in those provinces, and has given rise to various rumours. "It is generally believed," says one letter, "1 that the P'ope really intends to commence a system of improvement, and thinks he can best do so by quitting Rome, where, whenever a question of adopting reforms arises, Cardinal Antonelli, Secretary of State, and the majority of the Sacred College, are sure to set themselves in opposition to his wishes. At Bologna Pius IX., free from that baleful influence, may, it is thought, grant a political amnesty, and commence putting into execution the changes which the people bave so long and so often vainly demanded, and which the Powers have so often counselled." There are some who think that the object of the Pope's journey is to attach as much as possible to the capital the Legations, whose tendency to a total separation from Rme is every day becoming stronger. It is not forgotten that the Congress of Paris directed its attention to the situation of those provinces, so long occupied by Austrian troops, and so long subjected to the rigour of martial law, and to the dangers produced by the vicious administration which prevails in them, and which perpetuates a focus of agitation aud disorder in the very centre of Italy. Among the plans suggested as a remedy there was one proposed by M. Cavour, which consisted in giving to the Legations an indeplendent administration, even while renaining under the sovereignty of the Pope. This idea of separation has acquired new force since the publication of the memoirs of Count Aldini, who was Minister Secretary of State for the kingdom of Italy under Napoleon I. It would appear from this work that Count Aldini, when at ienna during the famous Congress, was invited by Prince Metternich to draw up a paper on the form of government most suited to the Lega. tions., The first thought of the Congress was to form the Legations into an independent State; but Count- Aldini foreseeing a complete Pontifical restoration, propozed to Prince Metternich and Prince TaDleyrand a plan which, admitting the sovereignty of the Pope, would include a government completely distinct from that of the other States of the Pop. That plan coincides rith the note presnted b Cavour to M. Walewki and Lord Clarendon on the 27th March, 1856, though it is pretty certain that 4. Cavour had no knowledge of the project of M. Aldini, which I believe is only now for the first time givan to the world. This coincidence betvveen two eminently practical men has produced a certain effect in the Legations. The Pope feels, therefore, the necessity of attaching these provinces to the Central Government by the concesion of railroads, perhaps by. political coneuions also, and by the in fluence which both would give to the Pope himself. I muat not omit mentionmg that there are a few who give quite a different interpretation to the journey of the Pope. They connect it with the fermentation of the public mind,and which ;ireplete with danger to the Government of the Peninsula. Tbis interpretation, if correct, rlates to, ulterior projects which are quit,' o ppoposite of reforms. It is, however, merely conjei, ,l. The following, from the Moniteur, corroborates what I mentioned some days since:- " Baron Gros has been nominated by the Emperor to pro. ceedto China in the capacity of ExtraordinaryCommissioner Lord Elgin has received from the Government of Her Bdtaunic Majesty a similar mission, with the same title, and the two Plenipotentiaries wiU lead each other mutLal assistance in the negotiations which have been cwfided to themn, and the success of which wVil doubtless open a new field to Christian civilization and to the commerce of all nations." The Cwistitutiomnel gives some details as to the precise object of Baron Gros' mission. It says,- " This diplomatist 'will have to demnand from the Chinese Government reparation for wrongs peculiar to France alone. Among others is the marder of XL Chapdeline, the missionary, who was last year put to death under the most atrooious circumstances. He is also to demand a fresh treaty of commerce. The French squadron is so composed as to be able to ascend the rivers, and thus act so strongly on the Chinese Government as to compel it tv satisfy the demands made." I cannot omit noticing a very absurd blunder of the Siele, which surpasses the geographical mistakes of the Cornstitutionnel when it spoke of the West Riding being the "partie Orientale de Londres." The Madrid papers mentioned the other day that a religious service was celebrated on occasion of the exhumation of the remains of Cardinal Ximenes de Cirneros at Alcala de Henares, near Madrid. The Siece, like Moliere, "prend son bien oi' il le trouve;" it, of course, at once appropriated the intelligence, and gravely announced yesterday the astounding fact that " Cardinal Ximenes de Cistron had just died at Alcala de Henares." The world hitherto believed that the great Cardinal Ximenes de Cisneros, the celebrated Administrator of Castile under the incomparable Isabella and her husband Ferdinand, and to whom Charles V. himself oved the consolidation of his power in Spain, died in 1517-that is, 34(0 years ago, and in the 81st year of his age. The Univers leaps with delight at having caught the Si.lde tripping. It is certainly a cut above the bon.stitutionnel in absurdity. The mistake of the Spanish writer, who recommended to such of his readers as had a taste for the study of " animated nature" to read Miss Edgeworth's Bssa-y on Irish B.lls, actually believing it a work on natural history, or the error of the lady who recommended " the Pastor Fido, by one Guarini," as one of the best manuals for the instruction of young clergymen in the duties they were to perform towards their flocks, are trivial in comparison. The readers of the SiAce are anxiously waiting for an explanation, in which none are more interested than the good people of Alcala de Henares itself.

During the last few days the inhabitants of Btuds and Pesth have been in an unusual state of excitement, the Austrian emnqoy6s having been occupied in preparing for the reception of their Majesties, and the Hungarians in lamenting over the past and speculating on the future. The HIungarian capital is composed of two towns:the one, which is called Buds (Ofen), lies on the right bank of the Danube; and the other, which is directly opposite, is the new and well-built city of Pesth. Buda and Pesth-the " Geschwester-Suidte" (sister-cities) as they are called-are connected by means of one of the finest suspension bridges in Europe, which was constructed between the yeare 1840 and 1849 by Mr. Adam Clarke, after designs by Mr. Tierney Clarke. The breadth of the Danube between Buda and Peath is 400 yards, and the distance, in a straight line, between the right bank of the river and the fortress of Buda may be about 250. The country on the left bank is perfectly flat, and completely commanded by the two high hills which are on the opposite slde of the river. On one of them is the fortress of Buda, and on the other (the Blocksberg) there are extensive fortified works, which were commenced very soon after the revolution was put down. Although the fortress of Buda is at such an inconsiderable distance from the river, the rock on which it stands is so steep that it takes a quarter of an hour to drive up the winding road leading to the Palace, in which their Majesties are now residing. At an early hour this morning the streets of Pesth were crowded by persons who had come from all parts of the country to witness the solemn entry of the Emperor and Empress of Austria into the capital of their kingdom of Hungary. The noise and bustle were great, and the dust intolerable, as the paviors were endeavouring to deprive the pavement of the streets through which their Majesties were to drive of some of its inequalities. There was a plentiful show of flags in the streets, and many gigantic wrreaths ornamented the fronts of the nrincipal buildings, but there was a want of animation in the people, which was the more striking, as thelIungarians are naturally extremely vivacious and demonstrative. On crossing the river my attention was attracted by a fine bold tunnel cut through the rock on which the fortress stands. It connects Buda with the suburb " Christinen-Stadt," and saves the inhabitants of Buda a roundabou:t walk of nearly two English miles. The architect, the above-mentioned Mr. Adam Clarke, has made a bold, and, as it appears to me, eminently successful experiment. On each side of the lofty and pointed arch are placed two Ionic fluted columns, and the pediment of the structure is to be in keeping. The tunnel forms asingularly appropriate continuation to the bridge. On the road leading up to the fortress the Jewish communities of Ofen and Alt-Ofen had constructed tents of velvet and silk. Higher up was an edifice open at the sides, and under its lofty roof was a monument composed of instruments used by the Danubian Steam Navigation Company, such as the compass, an anchor, wheel, rudder, pulley, halyards, oars, &c. At the top of the hill a temporary gate had been erected, and at a short diatance beyond it is the monument erected a few years ago to the memory of General Henzi, who with Major Allnock and 418 privates, was killed while gallantly defending the fortress against the Hungarians under Gorgey in 1849. A few steps further, and we are in the garden of the Palace, I from which we are about to witness the arrival of their Majesties. The view from the terrace of the gardens is maonificent, and the smoke of the steamers was visible at least an hour and a half before the gun which announced the arrival of their Majesties Was fired. As the clock struck 4 the war-steamer Croatia, which acted as pilot-boat to the Imperial steam yacht, passed underneath the bridge, and five minutes later the guns from two signal-steamers, which were posted higher up the river, announed to the vast crowds in the streets of Pesth that the Adler (Eagle) was about to appear. As soon am that ill-built, tub-like veswel, had passed Buda and turned her head up stream towards the landing-plAce, the guns of the Blocksberg fortress began to fire salutes alternately with the above-mentioned signalsteamers. Shortly after the Imperial yacht ap peared the Francis Joseph and Elizabeth steamers, with deputations which had gono up to Gran to present their respects to their Mjajeses. After the Emperor had listened to the speech addressed to him, he replied that he had now kept a promise formerly made to his Hungarian subjects, whichl WAs that he would bring the Ei^,--ess to see them. EIis Majesty zdded; that he had come in person to leara the wishes and ne asities of the Hungarian nation. cOn this," said my Magyar informant, "there was a loud cry of ' Elien !' which would have had no endU if the Monarch had only added, " and t, grant s reaonable demands." The Imperial cortig entered the city by the triumphal arch, and, after having passed through some of the prncipal streets, crossed the bridge in the following order:-Aband of Lancers,adetaclrment of Lancers, a detachment of Rifles, a " Banderiunm" of CQmanier, the Court Trumpeters, Court Gendarmerie carriages of nobles, Prince Esterhazy in his state ea - riage-and-sx, with 25 running footmen, and Prine s Nicholas Esterhazy in a carriage-and-six, with 22 running footmen. T he Primate of Hungary was also drawn by six horses, as wa some other prelate. A small" iBanderium" o- Jazygier was followed bya bishop on horseback,who carried before him a silver cross, which seemed t) be as massive as an ancient mace. Behind the prelate rode the Emperor, in the uniform of an Austrian General, and after hima came a brilliant suite. The next in the procession was the Empress, in the state glass-coach, drawn by eight magnificent grays. Her Majesty, who looked remarkably well, wore an Hungarian head-dress. The rear was brought up by the Court equipages, in which sat the ladies attached to the Court. That their Majesties were received with loud cheers and flourishes of trumpets need hardly be said. After having received the compliments of the authoritiec and no'oilitv in their apartments, the Emperor and Empress, with their suite, went to the chapel of the castle, where Te DeumS was sung. PRUSSIA. (FROM OVR OWN COMSMONDsNT.) BERLIN, E&Y 6. Even the very wisest of our politicians, who know everything before it happens, and always see something in everything that nobody else sees, are at a loss to account for the unexpected visit that Prince Napoleon proposes to make to this Court just now, in return for the visit paid to the French Court last autumn by Prince Frederick WiUiam. That the return visit would be paid some time or other, at a fitting opportunity, was of course calculated on, bat not that the Prince would make that opportunity just when the Grand Duke Constantine was on a visit to the Prince's own cousin in Paris. So little expected was this visit at this particular moment, that the Queen had arranged to go to Dresden yesterday, to spend a few days with her, sister, the Queen of Saxony, and when the intimation was made the day before yesterday of the approaching vist it was found necessary to put the telegraph between here and Paris severely into requisition to get at the bottom of the affair. The intention of the Prince is, however, no novelty. Some three weeks back it was announced at this Court, but it did not take place then on account of the trip to Italy that the King was then meditating. 'lhe Prince will leave Paris on Thursday, to sleep at Cologne that night, and come on hither the next day. The Dowager-Empress of Russia is expected to arrive at Pot-dam at the commencement of next month, to stay there until the middle of June. The trip which I mentioned to you some time back as intended by the King for the purpose of visiting :Rome, while his sister was staying there, but of which I added it was improbable that it would be put into execution, did not only really embrace the Holy City as one of its destinations,-the route being by way of Trieste,-but also from Rome it was His Majesty's intention to proceed to pay a visit to the King of Greece at Athens, and then go on thence to Jerusaler. The destinies of that duodecimo kingdom of Greece, and still more the classical associations which that land inspires, have for many years past been a subject of great interest to the King, and up till very lately a plan has been entertained every winter of sending a vessel up the Mediterranean in the spring on a voyage of scientific discovery; but every spring hitherto has seen the winter's plan succumb to some very inpoetical hindrance or other; so also this year. How dear a subject Jerusalem is to the Royal heart is best Bhown by that most practical of all tests-it is he who furnishes the funds for the maintenance of the Protestant Bishop there, who is presented to that see alternately by himself and our Queen. The Committee of the House of Notables to which the Government measure for adjusting the taxation of persons carrying on trade was submitted for preliminary discussion has decided, by a majority oi 13 to 6, to recommend the House to reject it; several important claues of it had already been disapproved, others amended, and subsequently a new clause was introduced confining the operation of the law to a term of five years so that there seems small chance of the House itself reversing the judgment passed on the measure by itscommittee. If this turnout as expected, theMinisters will have had every financial measure but one thrown out which they have proposed to the two Houses of the Diet this session, and, as money is the one great necessary of this Government (in a still higher degree than in other countries, for here everything is starved by the universal parsimony), it may be readily believed that it is not a little disturbed in its proceedings. The total failure of all' the measures of finance would, in a purely Parliamentary government, have led to the retirement, if not of the whole Ministy, at any rate of the Minister of Finance; but neither the one nor the other will take place here as an admitted consequence of the rejection of those measures; every care will be taken to avoid this, in order not to furnish a precedent for the Parliamentary usage that obtains elsewhere-viz., that the unsuccessful Minister must resign, and for the most part be replaced by the candidate for that office out of the ranks of the Opposition. The admission of this principle is felt here to be trenching on the Royal prerogative in the appointment or dismissal of the servants of the Grown, and the Ministers naturally favour this view in their own as well as their Royal master's interest. Nevertheless, Herr von Bode!schwingh, the present Minister of Finance, will find it expedient to retire from office between the close of the present session and the commencement of the next, inasmuch as, whether from an antipathy against himself personaUy, as the- author of various unpopular measures, or from want of skil in his projects, or from a determination on the part of the Opposition to bring about sundry changes in the present system of finance, it seems at least clear that the management of Prussian finance does not prosper in his hands.

i MILTTABY AND NAVAL INTBLLIGIEO2.S The 7th Royal Fusileers, third battalion of the 60th Royal Rifte Corps, 88th Connaught Rangers, and third battalion of the R'le Brigade, mentioned in 2e Times of yesterday, are for India, not China, There is no doubt about the 82d being ordered to China, and the head-quarters and 650 men wil shortly embark at Portsmouth in the Adventure iron steam troopship, and the remainder in tho Assistance sister vesseL with three companies of the 23daRoyal Welsh Pusileers; the head-quarters of the 23d and four companies will'embark in the two-decler hospital ship Melville; the remainder in some other vessel not yet notified. This Melville, after a month's labonrinfitting out atPortsmonth, is now discovered to be very leaky in divers places; she Las consequently been re-docked to have some of her copper stripped off, with the object of discovering the inlets and stopping them. The depots of the following Indian regiments at Chatham -viz, the 27th Enniskillen, 35th Royal Sussex, 53a and 60th Rifles, and the St. Helena Regiment, having been provided with new clothing and necessaries previously to joiing the service companies of their respective corps, were inspected yesterday by Colonel I. Jervis, Commandant of the Provisional Battalion. The above corps wil furnish about 600 men of all ranks for embarcation. The Hastings, 60, screw block ship, Captain Mends, C.B., fitting out for Coastguard service at Portsmouth, was taken out of dock yesterday to be masted. Yesterday Lieutenant-General Sir Charles William Pas ley, K.O.B., R.E., arrived at the Royal Engineer' establishment, Chatham, for the purpose of superintending some experiments with a new description of pontoon, invented by himself, which it is proposed to introduce into the service for the use of the Royal Engineers. The pontoon invented by GenerAl Pmaley differs in several important features from those now in use by the Royal Engineers, whicb were invented many years ago by General Blanshard, the latter being made of tin, and of a cylindrical form. The pontoon tested yesterday at Chatham is composed of sheets of copper firmly riveted together, the shape being that of a demi-canoe, by which name it is called. This form has been adopted by Sir Charles Pasley, as itwas considered that it would give increased buoyancy under the pressure of a much heavier weight, and at the sAme time the pontoon could be moved about with greater facility than is now the case. Each of the demi-canoe pon. toons weighs about 4001b, and when joined together the weight of the whole is about Sowt., which is somewhat less than those invented byGeneralBlaushard. The experiments yesterday took place in the Medway, near the Gun-wharf, where two of Sir Charles Pasley's pontoonswere floated under his directions, and afterwards formed into the ustal rat. This operation lasted nearly an hour, after which the raft, already heavily laden with troops and pontoon chesscs, was rowed under ono of the cranes, when a 32-pounder iron gun and carriae, weighing upwards of four tons,Swere lowered on to it, the pontoons being stillseveral inches above water. Notwithstanding this great weight the raft was easily rowed some distnce down the river toIUpnor Castle, where the gan was run ashore, the pontoons retain. ing their steadiness under that operation. The gnm and caniage were afterwards wheeled on to the raft, which was once more floated to the gun-wharf and unshipped. The results of the experiments, which were witnessed by Major F. C. Hassard and other offioers of the Royal Engineers, proved that General Pasley's invention promises severai improvements over the other pontoons now in use, in being more buoyant, and consequently capable of sustaining heavier weights without sinking, more easily managed in the water, and, each demi-canoe being one-half the size of the present pontoons, being more portable. Daring the experiments yesterday it was, however, noticed that the newly-invented pontoons were not so steady in the water as those in present use. A report of the invention will be forwarded to the Board of Ordnance. The A, B, and C troops of the Royal Military Train, at Woolwich, by order of Lord Panmure, have been furnished with complete sets of new harness, from the military store department of the Arsenal, and are to supersede the Artillery detachments in the fatigue duties both at the barracks and tbe Arsenal A general order has been issued in Woolwich Garrison directing an immediate reduction of the whole of the Artillery companies, excluding only the few remaining battery comapanies, which are to be retained in their former strength; the battalion and brigade companies and troops on service, both at head-quarters and on home stations, to be reduced to the number of 80 men of all ranks; the surplus to be formed into detachments of reserve, to be stationed al Woolwich. Her Majasty's steam shoreship Buffalo, Master-Commnander J. E. Petloy (in temporary command), left Woolwich yesterday, laden with steam machinery, for the Royal Sovereign, Melpomene, and Doris, under construction at Port3mouth and Pembroke. The screw shafting of the Doris, shipped in the Buffalo, weighs 18 tons, and required 16 horses for its conveyance from the manufactory to Woolwich dockyard. Her Majesty's steamer Princess Alice has replaced the Spitfire In King William Dock, Woolwich, and is ordered to be got ready for service. The 9-gun screw steam-sloop Lyra, built at Deptford, and fitting with engines of 60-horse power, is ordered to be forwarded to Woolwich to be fitted out and despatched to Sheerness, to be laid up in the second-class steam reserve. The freightship Agamemnon Is embarking a heavy cargo of reserve stores from Woolwich Arsenal, consisting of shot, shell of different dimensions, 24-pounder rockets and tubes, canteens, bales of blankets and rugs, cooking utensils, tents, &c., for Hongkong. The Ann arrived at Woolwich yesterday to ship ammunition for Sydney. The whole of the Royal Marine force at head-quarters, Woolwich, were yesterday morning formed into battalions i E the barrack-square, and, headed by the Commandant Colonel Brown, they were marched to Woolwich-common, under the command of Colonel Stransham, Second Com-andant, Lieutenant-Colonel Fleming, Lieutenant-Colonel Congdon, and Major Marsh, where they went through a field day movements. The band afterwards performed throughout the evening at a concert given in aid of the fund to assist the distressed operatives desirous of emigrating. Her Majesty's screw gunboat Beagle,4,LieutenantHewett commander, put intoFalmouth on Thursday, on her passage from the Mediterranean, with strong easterly winds, in want of fuel, bound to the eastward. The Right Hon. Sir Charles Wood, as First Lord of the Admiralty, has issued a notification that he will receive officers on Thursday, the 11th of the ensuing month, and on every subsequent Thursday during June and the succeeding month. Those officers wishing to see the First Lord are requested to enter their names in a book kept for that purpose in the hall, stating their Christian names in full and their rank in the service. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty - Archibald Elliott, surgeon, to the Victory; Alfred Wheffin, assistant-paymaster, to the Centurion; George B. Westcott, assistant-clerk, to the Calcutta.
-KELIGIOTTS TRACT SOcry.-The 58th annual meeting of the supporters of this society took place at Ese. ter-hall yesterday evening, the Right Hon. J. Napier, M.P., in the chair. According to the report, which contained a variety of interesting particulars connected with the Christian press in all parts of the world, it appeared that 37 tracts have been printed during the year, besides numerouR volumes and other publications of a useful character, adapted for readers of all ages and ranks of life. The total number of new publications amount to 290. The issues from the depository bave been 33,988,316,-an increase upon the previous issue of nearly two millions and a-half. The report directed attention to the progress of tract distribution in France, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Danmark, Russi, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Turkey, Palestine, the East Indies, Burmah, China, and otber countries. The benevolent income amounted to 7,5071., while the grants were 9,6841.-an excess of 2,1771. The sales of the year presented an increase of 3,2841. The total receipts were 91,4661. The report concluded with an appeal for increased support, on the grounds of the Lreat work in which the society is engaged, and the openingspreented for the diffusion of Chrisan truth. Among the speakers were the Dean of Carlisle, the Rev. Canon Champneys, and the Rev. W. LlandeTlls. BURGLARy AT IvER.-A daring burglary was committed very early on Wednesday morning last at Iverlodge. Iver, the residence of Mr. Mitchell, of Bond-street. The thieves obtaine4 entrance to the ground floor premises by forcing a window frame communicating with the garden and cutting away the inner shutters from their hiuges, the shutters being lined with sheet iron and strongly barred. They then ransacked al1 the drawers, chiffoniers, worktables, and writing-desks in the diningroom and library, collecting together a quantity of silver articles, spoons, a valuable silver sugar-basket, some shawls, and two handsome sideboard docks. The thieves then cut through a strong door opening to the entrance hall, and were heard by a manservant, who courageously prepared to attack the scoundrels, notwithstanding their threats to blow out his - brains if he did not keep quiet, They contrived, however, to get away, after blowing out their lights, and took with them all the property which bad been got together. An alarm was instantly given and messengers despatched to Slough, Uxbridge, and West Dray ton . Fortun ately twO of the men vwere captured between Bayes and Ealiag, and numerous articles found upon their persons, One of the men turned out to be a discharged soldier from the Coldsheam Guards named DgaraU, and the other named Birch, formerly a resident of Iver. Both of them are well known to the police as desperate thieves, and suspected of being implicated in numerou robberies which have recently taken place in the neighbour. hood. The fdelowfs uwre asfely lodged in Slough lockuphouse before 12 o'clockthe same mornng, and were brought up yesterday before the itting magistrates at Eton.

It appeared that the plaintifrs were timber mercbants at Manchester, and previous to the year 1854 they had large dealings and traussotions with the defendants, Messrs. Farrell and Griffiths, in the course of which the last mentioned firm became indebted to the plaintiffs in a sum considerably exceeding 4,0001. At the same timo the defendant John Fisher Moore was indebted to Messrs. Farrell and Griffiths, and by way of security for the debt due to the plaintiffs, and for any further advatce to be mnade by them, the defendants, Farrell and Griffiths, inter Ulia, delivered to the plaintiffs an order, signed on behalf of the fim, in the words and figures following:- ?S Mancbester.

I promite to pay to Mears. Jones and Co whateverbalan msay be due from meteo Mess, Farrll and Grfffith,. "JOHN FISHER MOORBK" Subsequently * deed of composition was entered into by all the creditors of Farrell and Griffiths, including theplaintiffs, by which they agresd to accept *.composition of 6a. Sd, in the pound, but it wa sexpresslyr stipulated by the deed that such composition was tu be "without prejudice tX the securities which the plaintiffs *nd such other creditors might hold for their respective debts." It appeared that the mOTLUt due from John Fisher Moore to messrs. Farrell and Griffiths was 4721., and in the month of March, 1856, an action was brought on their behalf against Moore for that sunm, who, being advised he had no legal defenceoto the action, paid the whole amount to Farrell and Gviffiths. The lesintiffs then filed the present bill to make John Fisher Licore ad Mtesrs Farrell and Griffiths or one of them, pay the said sum of 4721. The Master of the Rolls made adecree against Farrell and Griffiths, but dismissed the bil a again3t Moore. From this decision the plaintiffs appealed to mie Moore jointly responsible,as Farrelland Griffltha were in in solvent circumstances. Mr. R. Palmer and Mr. Freeing appeared for the appellants. Mr. SELwyx and Mr. Bossos snpported the decree for ioore on the ground that the composition deed annulled the equitable assignment of his debt. At any rate, he had oflered to pay the money to the plaintiff4, provided they wouxldgive him in indemnity, hut the offer bad been refused. The LOBD CHA1-cumLoR delivered the judgment of the Court, and said, they were all of opinion, with the Master of the Rolls, that the effect of the composition deed was not to destroy the securities held by the creditors With respect to the refusal by the plaintiffs to give an indemnity, they were perfectly right In so refusing, as they themuselves ought to have had an indemniy from the assignors. Now, under the circumstances of the case, what ought Mr. Moore to have done when he was threatened with an action at law ? Why, not only having had notice of the assignment of his debt to the plaintiffs, but having bound bimself to pay them, it was his plain duty to have filed an interpleidor bill, and then the Court would have taken care to indemnify him against all costs. InstesdZ however, of doing this, he bad set up a defence to the claim of the plaintiffs, that the equitable assignment was at an end by the execution of the composition deed. This defence, in the opinion of the Court, was frutitless, and Mloore was still liable to the plain. tiffs for the full amnount of his debt to Farrell and Griffiths. The decree of the Master of the Rolls was, therefore, wrong in absolving Moore from payment of the 472C., and must be altered to include his name with Farrell and Grifiths as liable to pay the plaintiffi that sum. No costs on either side. The Lords Justices concurred. Appea allowed. (Before ahe LoRD CHA.acxELGR .) NU'a; V. EDGE.

VICE-CHACELUOS' COIIBTS, M&Y 8. INNES V. 311CHELL. kJyvrc V e #lr A. JL. h.IKDERSLEM.) Tnss was a most singularcase, and came on upon a domTrrer to the amended bill. The suit was instituted to recover possession of certin real or heritable esttes situate at Rora, Darrahill, Todhole-hiUs, and Belhelvie, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland ;and also of personal property-being funded and otherwise in EGngland, amounting in value to 700,0001. The bill stated that Jane Innes, late of Edinburgh, at the time of her death was domaiciled in Sootland, and possessed of heritable estates in that contry, and also of personal property of the above amount, and by her will dated the 7th of March, 1832 (which wsas set out at great length), ultinately gave such property to "her nearest heirs and executors whomsoever ;" that the testatrix kept a book called a jotting.book, containing memoranda of various kinds, directions to her executors and trustees, and much valuable information with regard to her pedigree, such book being kept in the drawer of a table in her house, and which was found there after her death by one of her trustees; and that the defendants were aware of such book and its contents, and ought to have made use of it; that the trust disponees of this property were George Scott, John Thompson, and ugh Watson, whodied in th testatis ifetime, George Scott being since dead, and now represented by the defendant Jane ofunningham that the will was duly recorded in Scotland and proved in Canterbury. Then followed an enumeration ofthe different sums of stock belongmig to the testatrix, and a statement that the effect of the trust diso sition, except so far as it was modified by the jotting-book, was to vest the real and personal estate in the heir and next of kin of the testatrix according to the lawv of Scotland. There was then a statement of a complicated pedigree, the result being that the plaintiff, John Innes, as greatgrandson and heir at law of William Ines, was now heir at law of the testatrix, both special and general, according to thelaw of Scotland, and that the other plaintiff, Richard Innes, was nearest of kin; that the defendant, Alexander Mitchell, otherwise Innes, claimed to be sueb heir-at-law, and the defendant William Mitchell, otherwise Innes, claimed to be such next kin, and the whole personal estate was paid over by the executors to William Mitchell, who refased to account for the same. The bill then stated that in January, 1840, the Sherifts Court of Edinburgh served Alexander Mitchell as nearest heir, and he was pat into possession of the heritable estates, and had received various sums the proceeds of such property, and invested them in England; and that WiUiam 'itchell had paid to George Scott, one of the trust diswnees and mermbers of his family, two sums of 5,0001. and 5,0001., and 10,0001. to John Thompson; and immediately after the death of the testatrix, without regard to the jotting-book, the defendants were put into possession of the property, no notice of the death of the testatrix bein' given to the plaintiffi, neither was any advertisement issued or other precaution taken to secure the due administration of the estate; that the transfer was made by colusion, with the knowledge that the defendants were not heirs-at-law or next of kin. The plaintiff then alleged that the defendant3 pretended that such sums of 10,0001., 5,0001. and 5,0001., were given as a compensation for trouble, hereas the plaintiffs charged that they were the consideration for the transfer of the property to the defendants. and to prevent notice being given to the plaintiffs. The bill then stated that the defendants had produced documents, being books, papers, letters, &c., to prove their title, and particularly a letter dated the 25th ofmarch, 1722, purporting to be a letter written by George Innes to Gilbert Innes, his father, stating the death of one William Innes, which were alleged by the defendants to have been found by James Robert Gardener, their unole. inthetestatrix's possession; whereas the plaintiffs charged that such documents were fraudulently prepared to establish the defendants' title, were really wrttten long after the aleged dates, snd were altered to suit such purpose e that certain papers were removed from Sootland by ~ameg Robert Gardener to London, and when brought back by orderof the Court of Session several were found to have been intentionally lost; that registry books had been destroled and the language altered to make them refer tothe family of the testhtrix ; that in 1840 the plaintiffB deposited with the late Sir James Gibson Caig documents to establish their claim, and they were refused to be returned, and in 1S33, in consequence of the continued importunity of the plaintiffs, such books, &c., were returned to them by Gibson Craig, and Co. but numbers of them were not returned, and nothing could be discovered respecting them, whether they hadbeen destroyed or not, and iw7s- riala letter dated in 1801. The biUl contained these allegations, and prayed an account of the rents and profits of the Pro perty and the proceeds; a declaration that the defendnt Alexander Mitchell might be declared a trustee thereof for the plaintiffs and charged with n occupation rent; that the clear residue of the personalty and rents of the realty and the rights and interests of dl parties maight be ascertained, and for a receiver and injunction. The ATTORNxY-GENGEIAL, Mr. BAmY, and Mr. Hon. sousx appeared in support of the demurrer, and argued that the defendants having been declared by a Court of competent jurisdiction in Scotland entitled to the property now claimed, now 17 years since, this Court had no jurisdiction to interfere "w withsuch right," more especiallywhen it vas considered that a trust vas so differently regarded in different and foreign countries, Scotland, for the preent purpose, coming within that description, andbeiug a matter of personal confidence one country could not interfere in such a matter with the jurisdiction of the othoer; nothing| was charged against Thompson. MIr. A?'DXRSON and Mr. MrsxLLI appeared in snpport of the bill, and contended that it being dmitted for the pnr. poses of the demurrer that the decree in Scotand, by which ihe defendant was served here, was obtained by ftrud, it a as ipo facto void, botx according to the Scoteh and : .gUih law. haeq Qgur ht4 jvxisdictiou to dogl.A[liJ4 question of an estae in Scotland, if tht resident here, which was the present ease. The ATroPnZY-GENZRAL wa heard in reply. The V1CK CiiANcZDLLoB reserrod his judgment, *erd,g that, as there were many very important questionsinafolve in this case, it would be necewry for bim to v. Ssider the wholo case before he delivered his judgment If he should be of opinion that the demurrer ought to be overued up >a the question of parties, it would, of oourse, beunnecessa7 for him to consider the question of jurisdiction. CANNhOCM T. JAMiC1Y. This bill was filed by Ann Cannock, wife of Samuel Cannock, the younger, of Westbury-upon.Severn, in Glooes. tershiro, to establish the priority of a mortgage under theae circumstances :-The bill stted thst Messrs. Hieig-s aud Chamberlain in 1846 acted as solictors for Samuel Cannock, the elder, and Samuel Cannock, the younger. In July, 1844 Samuel Cannock, the elder, mortgaged certain freeholds and copyholds to which he was entitled called "! Wincolls" and " kaylors," subject to encumbranoes arnounting to 4,8051., and on the 11th of that month he agreed to sell to Fis ax.n such premises, with two cottages at Weetbury, for 1,20). The mortgages were-first, a mortgage in fee of "Taylors" for 1,600! to G. C. Hopkinon and R. A. Longworthy, further secured by a term of 1,000 3ears. and assigned in M1ay, I186, to Chamberlain, and the 1,000 yea term.3 to Higgins as a trustee for him. The second was a mortgage in fee of " Wincolls" for 2,2001., with a term of 500 years, to Thomnas Higgins, the term being vested in Joseph Allen Higgins as a trustee for him ; and, thirdly, a mortgage of both farms, subject tothe prior mortgages, andof other property, for 1,0051. to Jamee Boulter, After the agreement for sale Samuel Cannock, tbe elder, as was alleged, without the knowledge or oonsent of his son, executed two other mortgages of the same premises, one in November, 1844, in fee, for 1,500O. to J. A. Higgins and Gay Eill, subject to all the prior mortgages, and ti was assigned in December, 1844, to William Chichester. and the other in January, 1815, to Boulter for 195!. as a furtLer charge. The amount of the encumbrances was thus augmented to 6,5001. Cannock, the elder, ws also entitled tb the Lamb and Flag publichouse at Newnham, and in May, 1845, being in dimiculties, in conjunction with his Son y a memorandun in writing to Messrs. Higgins and Chamr. lain, requesting them topay certain debtg, and to retain the title deedsrelating to the premise, and undertaking to execute a mortgage; an action haviug been brought on apro. minsory-note, in which Caunock, the elder, was principal, and Cannoce, the younger, wassurety. HRiggis and Cham. berlain then borrowed 880!. of Elizabeth Higgins, and a mostgage in fee of the lamb and Flg publichouse was executedto her. A warrant of attorney was then obtained under the hands of both the Caunocks to enter up judg. ment, and it was entered up acoordingly and regstered. The bill then alleged that the legal effect of such warrnt of attorney was not explained, and Cannock, the younger, vwas ignorant that any property he might thereafter acquire would be affected tnereby. The 8801. waspartlyapplieo according to the memorandum and partly in discharging a debt to Thomas Higgins, and the costs of Higgins and Chamberlain, nothing beiDng received by Cannock, tae younger. The agreement for sale of the property was then modifed, and was to be for 6,0001., free from encumbraneeg. In April, 1846, Cannock, the younger, gave a ritten authority to Higgins and ehamberltin to act for him in the pur. chase, and to investigate the title, &c., but he had not the means of making such purchase, and was wishing to pay off the encumbrances to the amount of 2,0001., leaving the rest on mortgage, but he was informed that he could.only purchase by paying off Al, and notiEe was accordinglyjgiven to the mortgagees. 2251. was then added to the'.puichsae money at the instance of Cannock, the elder, and' Higgins and Chamberlain procured 4,700!., in two sums of 4 000!. rnd 700!. The plaintiff Ann Canuock, wife of Samuel Cannock, the younger, eventually authorized her trustees to advance the 2,0001. requisite to make the wh6oe purcha3s money, under a power vested in her by a deed:dated il 184, such 2,0001. to be secured on the property purchased, and the conveyance was executed. Simultaneously wlth this transaction all the mortgages were paid off and iaew securitiestaken, and a mortga executedin respect of the plain. tiff's loan of 2,000h, and Elizabeth Higgins asgned her mortgage to Willism Chichester (who was ahready assignee of the 1,500! aortgage), with the benefit of the warrant of attorney,andtherewas arecitalintheconveyanceto Cannock, the younger, that the mortgag of 880!. had been paid of, as she did declare. Aneegit was isued underthajudgmentnow vested in Chicbesterandpaymentoffef tbemortgageof 4,003D having been tendered and refused, those claiming under snch e!et and the prior mortgages brought an action of ejectment to recover possession of the property comprised in the plaintiffs mortgage, and advertised a sale under a power in the first mortgage deed. This bill was then filed in Sep. tember, 1852, to restrain the sale, and an injunction asked for, but refused, and eventually in April, 1853, an order was mnade restraining the sale, on the terms of the 4,000!. being paid to 'Vhichester without p,rejudice. In May following Chichester died, and the suit, having been revived, now came on upon motion for deoree, the bill praying that an account might be taken of what was due for prin cipal, interest, and oosts on the mortgages for 4,000! and 700!., for a declaration that the parties interested in this first-mentioned mortgage should not be entitled to any costs, either of the action of ejectment or the intended sale, or any costs incurred subsequently to the lirst offer to pay the 4,0001. and interest, and that the plaintiff was entitled to be indemnified by the defendants, and particularly Higgins and Chamberlain, against the costs of this suit That she was entitled to redeem the first and second mortgages upon payment of what was justly due to them, and on their own mortgage, and in default for a foreclosure. That Cannock, the elder, might be bound by the proceedings, and the other defendants restrained from proceeding with the action or sale. Under these circumstances Cannock, the elder, having been served with the proceedings, and the other parties having put in their answers, the question was whether the persons claiming under Chichester could have the benefit of the judg. ment, the existence of which, it was alleged, was not known to the plaintiffs, and was not referred to in this sale to Cannock, the younger, and which was a fraud, therefore, upon them. To this it was answered, that Eiggins and Chamberlain only actea for some of the parties, and it was open to them, as in the ordinary case, to search for judgments, which would have led to the fact of the judgment to Elizabeth Higgins being in existence, and which the parties acting for the vendors were not bound tocommunicate if the question was not asked. There was no ma fides whatever in the transaction, and no improper conduct proved. Mr. Rolt and Mr. G. H. Giffard appeared for the plaintiff, Mr. Bevir for the second mortgagees, Mr. Glasse and Mr. C. Barber for the defendants. hSr. RoLT was heard in reply. The VICE-CHACxELLOR said that he must oonsider this case before delivering his judgment. During the latter portion of this case the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone was accommodated with a seat on the bench, awaiting, as we understood, the ooming on of a petition of " Wilcox v. Smith," involving an important question upon the oonstruction of the Succession Duty Act, 16th and 17th Victoria, cap. 51,which, however, eventually stood over until Trinity Term. (Before Vice-Czancellor Sir J. STUAjT.) TUE ORIENTAL BANK CORPORATION V. CALROW. This case came before the Court on a demurer to the bill and on a motion for an injunction. The bill contained allegations to the following effect :-In the gear 1855 Messr Stewart and Calrow, who then carried on business as merchants at Calcutta, shipped certain goods to the consignment of their London correspondents, Messrs. Syers, Walker, and Co., and drew bills of exchange on Messrs. Syers and Co. on account of the goods, which bills were negotiated by the plaintiffs at Calcutta on their being endorsed on them, and on Messrs. Stewart and Calrow also endorsing to the plaintiffs the bills of lading of the goods, and executing a letter of hypothecation, which, after makingcertain provisions witb respect to the goods hypothecated, authorized the plaintiffs, on default being made in acceptance or ayment of the bills, to sell the goods and to hold the balance (if any) "at their (Messrs. Stewart and Calrow's) disposaL" In the early part of 1856 the partnership between Messrs. Stewart and Calrow was dissolved. In July, 1856, Messrs. Syers, Walker, and Co. being unable to meet their engagements, Calrow, on behalf of bimself and his late partner, gave the plaintiffs notice not to deliver the goods to Messrs. Syers, Walker, and Co. When the biUs of exchan2e arrived at maturity they were not paid by Messrs. Syers WFalker, and Co., who in December last were declaredbankrupt ;'and the plaintiffsthen, in pursuance of the power for that purpose, sold the goods. After they had repaid themselves the amounut advanced on the bills of exchange a balance of 1,5S6!. 8s. 6d. remained in the hands of the plaintiffs. Au action at law for the amount of that balance had been commenced by Messrs. Stewart and Calrow, and another action for the same amount had been threatened by the a&signees in bankruptcy of Messrs Syers, Walker. and Co. The hill prayed that the defendants, Messrs. Stewart and Calrow, and the assignees of Messrs. yers and Co. might bo decreed to interplead together, that the pldaitiflhmightboatlibertyto pay the sum of 1,586!. 18s. 6d. into court, and for an injunction restraining the defendants from proceeding at law. The demurrer and the motion for an miunction came on together. Mr. iBAcON and Mr. H. F. nRtsTowv were heard for the demuarring defendants, M3ess Stewart and Calrow. Mr. Mlins Mr. Erskine, and Mr. C.a H Tyndall, for the laintifs, wern ot called upon; MIr. Wigram and Mr. iffifrdaperred for the asignees in bankruptcy of Messrs. Syers, Walker, and Co. The VIrCECInAaCxLLoR said that the plaintiffs were holders of property which was claimed by Messrs. Stewart and Calrow, and also by the assignees- n bankruptcy of Messrs. Sycrs. Walker, and Co. The first important consideration was what Vras the relation between the two sets of clainants and the plaintiffs? The demurring defendants, Messrs. Stewart and Calrow, were drawers of bills on tho bankrupts, Messrs Syers, Walker, and Co., and these bills weMe dravn against the proceeds of cargoes consigued by Messrs. StewartandCalrowto the bankrupts. The plaintiff; advanced money on the secmurity of the bills thus drawn of the bilis of lading of thegoods, andofletters of hypotheootion ef the goods. Whatever question arose betweenthe co-defendants as to the right to the property now held by theplaintiff, it aose on no independent coutract, but there* was aprivityof contrast between the plaintiffs atd both defendants with reference to this property. It had been said, however, that the language of the letters of hypo. tbeegtion was such as to create that sort of independent contract between the demurzing defendants andthe plaintiMi which, on the pinciple expressed by Lord Cottenhibm ia "Crawhay 2morncn" 2 Myl. ana Cr., p.1i9), made it impossible for the plaintiffs to maintain a billof iner. pleader. If the demurring defendants were right the assignees of the bankrupts h nothing to do withthe property in the hauds of the plaintiffs, or with the trans. action on the letters of hypothecation. The facts alleged nmade it impossible to support that view, for it ite bills of exchange had been paid the property, as a matter of course, would have been the bankrupts. Here was a oase therefore, in 'whichb ther was a complete privity of contract betwem all the defendants, and in which it was impossible to sy hat the asagrees of the bankrupts wereo traugers to the rght 1, ieh thepopertX was bald by ,the present pain. w very ac of tbe demurrin det daa aa A thneir isansctiona vith Messrs.

COURT OF Q.=8 B13NCR WESTMINSTER MAV R SHLB QUEEX V. THE JUDGE OF THM COUNTY COURT OF NORFOL. : (SiUings tr Banco, beore Lord CAMPBELL and .Tusices WIGaTMAN1, ERLE, and CRomPToN.) At the sitting of the Court this morning, Lord CAMPBELL delivered the judgment of the Court in this case. The question raised was as to the power of the judge of a county court to commit a defendant on ajndg. B5ent summons under the 98th section of the 9th and 10th Victori;, cap. 95, after. the defendant had obtained a valid order of discharge, under the Insolvent Debtors Act, of the debt in respect of which the judgment summons was issued. The uestion had already been discussed in the case of Abo they Dale " (11 C. B.); but that case, as appeared e ort, was decided on the express words of tho proviso to the 102d section, which said that no protection, o-er, or certificate ranted by any Court of Bankruptcr, or for the Relief oF 1asolvent Debtors, shall be availablg o dischage any defendant from any commitment under Dueh kct.meUt20aed order, BT a subseqtsnt gtatte (tbe 19th and 20th Victoria, cap. 108), the above Prviso was repealed. In order to give effect to the nte-v tion Of the Legislature the Court was of opinion that the order of disocarge, comurising the judgment debt in the Coanty Court, took aWay from the Court the power of imprisonment on a judgment summons for the nonpayment of th%t debt. The Court did not assuime to overrule the decision in "1Abley v. Dale," but, consistently with that and other decisions, had come to the conclusion that as by he 19th and 20th Victoria the proviso to the 102d section of the 9th and 10th Victoria had been repealed, the jurisdiction of the Judge of the County Court to commit in such a case was at an end. A prohibition, therefore, ought to issue, and th erulel for that purpose must be made absolute. Rule absolute. ~ ~ ~ asolte MB. PHINN. Lord CAMflBELL, seeing Mr. Phinn in his place in the front row, said he was very glad to see him back again; but he could not ask him to move, as it was the last day of term. His Lordship, according to ancient custom, then called upon the juniors in the back row to move. IN RE JOHN WILLIAMS KNIPE, AN ATTORNEy. Mr. GARTH moved to make a rule absolute to strike an rttorney of Worcester, named John Williams Knipe, off the roll for misconduct. Master TuRNER, to whom the matters had been referred, then read his report to the Court. Mr. GARTH Baid notice had been given to the gentleman who had appeared for Mr. Knipe before the Master that his report would be read this day, but he believed the attorney did not appear either by counsel or in person. Lord CAMPBELL said that after the able and clear state. ment contained in the Master's report ib appeared to tbe Court that Mr. Knipe was not a fit person to remain on the roll of the court. The rule must therefore be made absolute to strike him off. Rule absolute. THIE QUEEN V. COCRBTURN. In this case the Court had granted a rule to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against the pnnter and publisher of the Joint-Stock- Companie' Journa fora lbe pulisedin that jounral on the 18th of Anril last reflecting on MIr. Frith, the vice-chairman, and other directors of the Bank of London. Mr. BODHIN (with whom was Mr. Turner) now moved to make the rule absolute. Mr. Cockburn, the defendant, then appeared in person, and was about to argue in a rather irregular manner, when Lord CAMNPBELL said, the Court would be ready to hear him show grounds why the rule should not be made absolute o and inquired whether he had read the affidavits on whicei the rule was granted. Mr. Cockburn said, he was quite ignorant of legal proceedings and that he had not seen any affidavits. Lord CAMPBELL asked the defendant whetber he would like to have the case postponed, in order that he might see the affidavits. Mr. Cockburn, after a little rambling, said he should. Lord CAMPBELL then said the rule would be enlarged till next term; but any affidavits in answer which the defendant wished to make use of must be filed four days before the next term. Rule enlarged. DEAN V. LEMPRIERE. This was a rule calling upon the Bishop of Exeter to show cause why he should not render to the plaintiff an account of what was done under a writ of sequestration, and why he should not pay over the money. Mr. AL SMITH and Mr. KARSLABE now showed cause against the rule, and stated that the reason why the money was not paid was because the applicant had failed to satisfy the bishop's officers that he had authority. Mr. ASPLAND said there was no doubt that the party had authority from the person to whom, as we understood, the debt had been assigned. Lord CAmPBErL said it was quite right that the bishop should be satisfied on this point It was then agreed ha on roduction of the neceary proof the money should bepaiu. LISTER V. LEATIER. This was an action for the infringement of the plaintiff's patent for improvements in woolcombing machinery, in which the Court recently gavejudgment for the plaintiff on all the points. An application was subsequently made for leave to appeal. Lord CAMPBELL now said that the Court would most readily give leave to appeal on one of the points, which was a point of law, and very proper to be taken to a Court of Error. But, as to the other points, the Court thought that after the verdict of the jury it would be inconsistent with their duty to grant leave to appeal on this. At a subsequent period of the day a further application was made by sr. I I. CHAMBERS, and the leave given was somewhat extended. ANONYMOUS. A man dressed in a very dirty smock frock here appeared on the floor of the court, and, having caught the eye of the Lord Chief Justice, was asked what application he had t. make. The applicant said be wanted to move for a new trial. Lord CAAMPBELL.-Whsn was the cause tried? The Applicant.-It was tried in 1841. Lord CAMPBELL said that as that was the case the Court could not hear the application. The applicant then withdrew. At the close of the business, as the judges were leavin the court,the same man rose in oneof the back benchces and began to renew his motion. Seeing the judges leave the court he entered into a conversation with those about him, and informed them that he had been 14 years in prison since the trial, and that, as he could not get justice in this court, he should apply " in other quarters."' THE QUEEN V. THE JUSTICES OF BRECON. In this case a rule had been granted caUing upon certain justices of Brecon and the overseers of St. David's to show cause why the justices should not issue their warrant to levy upon the goods of the overseers the sum of 101., which had been disaUowed by the auditor in their accounts. Mr. LUSH now appeared to show cause against the rule, and said the sum of 101., paid for au old debt of the workhouse by order of the Poor Law Board, was disaUowed by the auditor, because no such order under seal had been produced to him. Bat when the overseers appeared before the magistrates they produced the order of the Poor Law Board, and the magistrates refused to issue this warrant. I The learned counsel said it would be most unjust if this rule were to be made absolute. Besides, the auditor bad not produced before the magistrates, as required by the eighth section of the 11th sad 12th of Victoria, cap. 91 a certificate of his own appointment, nor a certificate tiat the amount was due. Mr. MILWARD said that from the course the case had taken before the magistrates, the objections taken by the other side must be considered as waived. The Poor Law Board wanted to have the opinion of the Court on the construction of the Act, as to whether it was competent for the magistrates to review the decision of the auditor. Lord CAMPBELL said he wished the board had embraced a more favourable opportunity of raising the question. The overseers were entitled in this case to take advantage of the circumstance that the conditions required by the act had not been complied with. Rule discharged, with costs. THE QUEEN V. DAIMAN. This was a rule to show cause why Mr. Dayman, one of the police magistrates of the metropolis, should not hear and adj3dicate on a complaint made on the 14th of November last against a Mr. Carpmael for the non-payment of a suma assessed upon him towards the pavement of a "new street." The proceedings had been instituted under the aOtb section of the Metropolis Local Management Act (18th and 19th of Victoria, cap. 120). By the 250th section the word "street" included "highway." and the magistrate was of opinion that the street in question was not a " new street" within the meaning of the Act, it having been a highway since 1851. He accordingly decided in favour of the party summoned. The present rule was then granted under the 11th and 12th of Victoria, cap. 44. Mr. Lu,u, in showing cause against the rule, contended that the decision was right ; and, at aU events, this Court would not review the magistrate's decision. The rule called upon the magistrate to hoar anddetermine, whereas he had, in fact, determined the question. Mr. H. HILL, Q.C., and Mr. PRENTICE supported the rule, and contended that the facts of the case showed, not that the magistrate had decided on the complaint, but that he had declined jurisdiction, on the ground that the street n question was not a "nuew street." In so doing he had mistaken the law, and this Court would set him right, making this rule absolute. Lord CAM%PBELL said this was a rule, under the l1th and 12th of Victoria, cap. 44. to order the magistrate to hear and adjndicate upon a certain complaint. The answer was that he had already adjudicated, and that answer was c6mpletely established. By different sections of the Act the magistrate had jurisdiction to hear and determine. By the 105th section the liabilitv arose where there was a new pavement; and hv the 226th section power was given to the magistrate to hear and determine a complaint for non-payment. The matter before the magistrate was w.ether this was a " new street ;" one side said it was, and the other that it was not: ann issue Wa joined upon that. That was the ret judican7da, and it became a res judicata when the magistrate gave his solemn opinion on that subject. Was the Court now to caU upon the magistrate to bear and adjudicate, and to tell him that his opinion was wrong and that he must pronounce a different Judgment ? The object of the statute the 11th and 12th of Victoria was to give a more sreedy remedy in cases where the writ of mandamus would lie ; but the Court could not grant a mandamus to hear and determine wbere tho magistrate, on issue joined, had heard and determined. The Court of Queen's Bench was not a court of advice, and the judges did not sit here, like the Roman patricians, to give opinions to their chents, but to decide. The Court would not give an opinion which, from respect to their station, one might adopt, and another might overrule ; and if tho Court would not do that before judgment, much ess would it do so after judgment had been given. Mr. Justice WIGHTMMr expressed himself to the same effect. Mr. Justice BRLE saidl it seemed to him that this case camne precisely within the 11th and l2thLof Victoria, cap. 44, and that the judgment of the magistrate was given on the cardinal point on which his jualsdistion depended. The magimate said he baa not jurisdiction, and it w; s enacw that where a magistrate had a doubt whetoer he could exercise jurisdiction tbis Court might be appliel to ath might give its judgment, in which the magistrate inigbt be ruled to obey the samne, and to do the act required. No doubt, the judgment of the Court would only bind the parties concerned, but it would sway in after timne. Mr. Carpmael said the magistrate had no jurisdiction, because the only case in which the provisions of the act applied wAs where it was a "1new street"' where the house stood, and he contended it was not a "new street," because it was a "highway" when the Act passed. That was an issue on the cardinal fact on which the jurisdiction of the ma gistrate point that no street could be a " new street." wi thin the Act if it was a "hihway" when the Act passed. Hlis Lordship Couart might be apRied for f;and, though it would not force other magis-trates, it wouild stand for their guidance. Mr. Justice CBROrPTON agreed with the majority of the Rule dischrged. WHEELTON V. HA}DISTY. Thhiswas an action brought by the Norwich Reversionary Society against the Westminster Insurance Company, upon a policy of inurance for 1,6001., which had been effected on the life of the late R. I?. H. Jodrell. The several points of law involved in the case were argued on a previous ,ay by Sir F. Thesiger, Sir F. Kelly, and Mr. Mac. namara, on the part of the plaintiff; and by Mr. Serieant Byles, MIr. Bovill, Q.C., and MIr. Cairns, Q.C., of the Chan. cery bar, on the part of the defendant. Lord CAPBELL expressed the pleasure which the Court had had in listening to Mr. Cairns's argument, and hoped they would again have the pleasura of hearing him in this Court. Mr. MAIsTy and hir. TimuPP this day were heard in support of the defendant's case. L-ord CAMPBELL said the Court would take time to consider, and give judgment next term, unless they should be obliged to take the long vacation for its consideration. CHOLLTrr V. HEOFFMANc. Mr. BOvILI, Q.(., applied for leave to appeal against the decision of the Court in this case. The Court had decided that the plaintiff was bound to prove that he was registered as the assignee of the patent, and that in default of that proof he could not recover for an infringement. Lord OAi,u'ana, said it wvas a very proper case for a Court of Error, and the Court would grant leave as prayed. KEWr V. WILLATTS AID OTHERS. This was an action by a printer against the trastees of a friendly society established under the 13th and 14th Vic. toria, cap. 115, and called the A' United Patriot Life and Fire Insurance Company," to recover the amount of his charges for printing, &o. At the trial the jury had found a verdict for the plaintiff; hut a rule bad been since grated to set aside the verdct Aad enter a nonsuit, or to reduce the damages. It appeared that the defendants had been appointed trustees in March, 1856 after the passing of the 18th and 19th Victoria, cap. 63, tat the resolution on this Appointment bad not been returned to the Registrar of Friendly Societiems Upon this ground, and also upon the ground that the claim did not concern the property of the society, the defendants contended that the plaintiff ought to be nonsuited. It was also contended, es to part of the plain. tif's claim, that it was incurred before'the defendants were appoited. i. Atherton, Q.C., on a previous day showed cause agnt the rule, and was now followed by Mr. DAY on the saine side. Mr. HAwKUNs (with whom was Mr. P. H. Lewis) was heard in support of the rale. Lord CAmPBELL said that at the trial he thought the objection that the names of the trustees had not been returned was amost formidable one; bat, after hearing the able . gument of Mr. Day on the new statute, he was satisfied that the verdict was right, and that the rule ought to be discharged. The other JUDGES concurred. Rule discharr,ed. RSi T DAY OF EASTER TsmM. This being the Iast day of Easter Term the musua proolamation was made to the suitors to " depart hence and take their ease," but they were duly admomahed to " keep their day" on the 22d inst., the first day of Trnity Term.

(S&tings in Banco, 6cfore iUr. Justice CoLxroGox) SIMMONDS V. MOSS. In this case, which waz argued yesterday upon a rule for settg aside an award, the lesrnod Judge took time for oern a testion. Mr. Justice CoL,ERnGo this morning delivered judgment. The rule had been granted on two grounds-first, that the witnesses were not sworn, and that the arbitrator had refused to swear them. This was answered by the afiidavits, which stated that the arbitrator had expressed great doubt whether he had the power to swear the witnesses, and that an offer had been madeto take the witnesses before the Judge and have them sworn, but that the parties had waived the objection. He (the learned Judge) was of opinion that the arbitrator had not the power to swear the witnesses, except the power was given in the order of reference, and here no such power was given. The other objection was that there had been great misconduct in the arbitrator,-that there had been great noise, tumult, partiality and interruption, If there had been no denial and it had been clearly proved, he should have had no doubt the rule ought to have been made absolute; but these allegations had been met in the most clear and specific manner, and he must say the charges had been most completely answered. The rule mnust therefore be discharged; and, considering the gross imputation thrown on the arbitrator, he should not do justice unless he disebarged tho rule with costs. Rule discharged with costs
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WEST3MMM, MAY 8. SThMND V. RRA nnTn IStffina in R-w 1F-,. Tr,-r % In this case Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mfr. Unthanke showed cause against a rule why judgment should not be entered for the aefendant non ob8tante weredicto, and Mr. M. Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Tomlinson appeared in its support. The action was brought on a contract to deliver a cargo of fair average Nicranzie rice at lls. 6d. per cwt. The jury negatived that tho rice delivered was of fair average quality, and the defendants now contended that the contract coutained no warranty to deliver a cargo of rice of that qualitr. The COURT were of opinion that the rule mnst be discharged. It appeared to the Court that the contract amounted to a warranty that the cargo should consist of fair average Nicmranzie rice, and, the rice not having been of that quality which the seller warranted that it should be, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the difference in value. Rule discharged. FRENCH V. STYRnZG. In this case Mr. Hawkins showed cause against a rule to reduco the verdict to 1001., on the ground that the remainder of the amount of the verdict arose out of partner. ship matters betweer the blaintiff and the defendant, and Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and 'Mr. Manisty appeared in sup. port of the rule. It appeared that a part of the damages recovered consisted of the cost of keeping and training a racehorse, called Census, which was sold by auction at Northampton, and bought by a Mr. Cohen, acting as agent for the plaintiff, for 2501. One half share in this horse a Mr. Malinson became ovwner of, and from him the defendant became entitled to that half share. The plaintiff and defendant agreed to run the horse, paying the exunses of his keep and training equally. These expenses the plaintiff had paid, and sought to recover his share of the expenses from the defendant. On the part of the plaintiff it was contended that they were joint owners ofthe horse, that each could sell his share, and that they were not partners. On the part of the defendant it was contended that the plaintiff and defendant as to the hore and the expenses of his keep were partner, and that the plaintiff's remedy lay in a court of equity, and not of law. The LonD CiEF JusTIcE, in delivering judgment, said he was of opinion that this rule must be discharged. He thought it clear that there was no partnership between the plaintiffand the defendant in the horse, but each had an undivided moiety as tenants in common. They were part owners, but not partners, He concurred in the observations of the learued counsel that, though not partners in the horse they might be partners in working it for their common 6enefit. Here they agreed that the horse should be kept trained and run for their common benefit, and he thought that would constitute a partnership in respect of the training and managing of this horse. Then came the question whether, notwithstanding the partnership. the plaintiff xnight not recover the sums he had advanced in respect of this partnership. It was incidental to every part. nership that there should be some capital to carry out i's objects. The capital in this case was having sums of money for training and keepingthe horse. If the plaintiff and the defendant had agreed that a certain sum should be contributed by each of them in advance as money capital for the iartnershiD obpects, and that that capital should be advanced in equal nroiettlo,and theplaintiffhadadvanedhisownsb re and also the share of the defendant for the defendant, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover it. It being part of this agreement that each party should contribute his share of the capital necessary for the working of the horse, it seemed to him to make no difference whether the capital was advanced at the outset or from time to time, In this case the plaintiff, instead of receiving his share of the capital from the defendant, paid it for him in advance. There could be no doubt when monsy was paid into a partnership concern, then the distribution of the money became matter of account. It appeared to him that this case was clearly distinguisbable, and that this was an advance made not as part of the partnership account, but an advance made from one partner to the other, It seemed to him, therefore, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the advance made, and the rule must be discharged. The other learned Judges were of the same opinion. Rule discharged. The IoBD CniEF JusTIcE announced that two Court will sit at Nisi Prius to-morrow-one for Specid Juries.
COURT OF EXCHEQUERP FRIDAY. MAY 8. RlTrA'RIT.VF V- RPTO-^AW (dting in Banco.) This was an action by the plaintiffs as endorsees of a foreign biU of exchange, the defendant being sued as the drawer, and pleading that the bil had not been duly presented for acceptance and dishonoured as alleged in the declaration, and also that he had not had due notice of such dishonour. At the trial before Mr. Justice Crowder, at Glocester, the plaintiffs prodaced the bill of exchange in question, and it appearing to be unstamped, the learned counsel for the defendant objected to its reception, and th;s objection having been submitted to by the counsel for the plaintiffffwhen called uponfor an ansvwer by the learned Judge, anonsnit wzas entered. Subsequently this rule for a new trial was granted, on the grounds that the bill, being a foreign one, did not require any stamp under the circumstances of the case, and that if it did its production was unnecessary in support of either of the issues. Jr. PowXrLL now showed cause. Tbe question arises on t,he language of tbe new Stamp A ct, 17th and 18th Victoria, cap. 83, which for the first time subjected foreign bills of exchange to the stamp dutiee, and encsta deiesap shall ae act ced to all such bills, and cancelled before the hills are nresented for payment, or endorsed, transferred, or negotiated in any manner. It appears that the de- fendant, being the captain of a. vessel, drew this bill for. repairs at Quebec on his principal, in favour of a correspondent of the plaintiff payable in London. The de. fendant then endorsed the bill in Quebec to such cnrrespondent, who forwarded it to the plaintiffs. When the bill ws presented for .ceeptance it was dishonourel, the principal haiing failed, and on the arrival of the defendant at Glocester he wras sued. Under these circumtnoesh it wa contended that the pla.intiffg were bound to produce the bill $th tla dw the pleeadenyig ,hsfaet #thatitir duly presented for acceptance, and that it as a foreign bill, which must be tken to a been dorsed or negotiated in England. Bnt e fe endenment should be held to have taken plc abon dtwa snls. mitted that in that case a stamlp oght to h been tached on its arrval and before it e en at ance as it was endorsed to a party in England. In addltFog tothewe points it was aisoarguehatte iinfthe judge was final; that the nonsuit being von ofbmitted to by the plaintifik they wer notnoatlezyt reverse it; and, Ey, that i su acld only be made absolute for a new trial on payent of costs. The COURT, however, unanimously decided against all the objections raised by the leaed coune, without calling on his opponents, except that which wenLt to raise the thuestion whether under the plean it wa obligatory on te plaintiffs;to produce the bill. Bt, assumin ucha obligation, it was clear that the bill di n reur an Stamp, AS it was neither endorsed, transferred, negotiated or p ented for nyment in England. It might well be that the Chancellor of the Ex cheq er, when fixing the stamp duty on foreiga bills for the fist time, expresldy consinea that liablty to that period in their existence when on being acep td they acguired thoe charcer of perfect instruments. ntil a foreign bi was aocepted in Englad It was but an inchoate instrumenr and unti some act was done in Englad with reference to It which cotntituted an English contractit would appea that it did not require any stamp. No such act w donehereawas contempat bythe statute, and the nonsuit was wrong. Bat it was further contended that the role ought to be discharged because the decision of the judge on a question of stamp was final under the Commons Law Protedure Act Th t r vision, bowever, only related to cases in which the judge'ruled that the instrument was insufficiently stamped, or did not require any atall. In those caseswhere he decided, ashere, that the instrment required a tdamp, his ruaing may be questioned. Then, again, it wha urged thao it was not opentothe plaintiffs to set aside this nousuit because they d d o optpose it at the trial. For this objection there was no foundain at all. The judge, taking an erroneous view of an ingenious stamp objection, gave effect to it by virtually rulingthhat a verdct must pass for the defendant unless the plaintiffs were nousuited, and in submittng to that rulng, and electing the alternative of a nonsit, the Ilaintiffs, cusel did not deprive his chents of the right to dite tant rmuling. Astothe questionof csts, itwas no hardship on the defendant that ther; should be a new trnle but rather one of which the plaintiffs might complain, fojr the necessity for a new trial arose from the ingenious, though untenable obecxio of the learned counsel for the defendant himself. 4f any party ought to pay the costs the defendant would bethatgparty; but the general rule must prev il there, as in all other cases-that where the error is that of the judge no costs are given to either side. Rule absolnte accordingly. Mr. Eeating and Mr. Gray appeared for the plaintiffs in support of the rule.
POLICz. ssIoN-HousE.-Mr. William Cockburn and Mr. William John Lawson appeared before Mr.AldernanH E: in discharge of their recognizances for having combined and consired together to injure the reputation and charsater of the Bank of London. Alderman HAEL-I think that sgulfcient hae been stated tojustify me in committing the defendants for trial, and it 22 be for a jury to say whether theyaregailtyof the offence with which they are charged. The defendants were fulUy committed upon this charge. The depositions of the witnesses in the separate chargo against Mr. Cockburn, of having wlfauly and maliciously =b1ished P. defamatory libel coneeming the directors of the of London, were next read over and signed, and the defendant was committed upon this charge also. The magistrate caUed up?o each of the defendants to enter into his own recognizance in 2001. to appear at the Central Criminal Court; and this having been done they left the court. M_nLBonouGH.r-sTRrE.r.-?lary Price, a well-known thief, was brought before 3ir. BINGHAU, charged with stealing a cashbox and its contents from the George and Dragon publichonse, Greek-stet, Soho. Mr. Lew/is, of Great Marlborough-street, attended for the prisoner, who reserved her defence. The prisoner was committed for trial and was allowed to have her clothes which were at the railway, she having taken her place to Southampton. Wossi s_ra.STE. -Mr. H.AaML acknowledged his receipt of 31. from "X.

Thomas Burns, of 29, 62, Ossmlston-street, Somers-town, descibing himself as a servant, was placed at the bar before Mr. Tyrwhitt, charged with being concerred, with twro others, in fraudulently obtaining the sum of Sf from James Edm5bonds, a rent collector, residing at 9, Milton-street, The prisoner was remanded. THAxEs.-Daniel Kesler, a sturdy, rough-looldng feUow was brought up on remand, charged with stealing a goid watch value 20u., from Christopher Stiegel, a Norwegian, and carpenter of the ship Aloes, lying in the East India Dock. M3r. YARDLEY sentenced him to be imprisoned and kept to hard labour in the House of Correction for six calendar months. SouT}wAst.-John Lanuley, steward of the John Bull steamer, trading between London and Antwerp, was charged before Mr. CoaiBn, upon information from the Customs' authorities, with having in his possession on board that vessel a superb gold fancy watch valued at 101., and 72 articles of manufactured silver plate, consisting of an ornamental stand, spoons, forks, &c., valued at 851, for all of which the duty had not been paid. Mr. Beverley attended for the Customs' authorities, and Mr. Lewis, jun., for the defendant. Mr. Claridge, the Queen's appraiser, was also present. Mr. COMIBE said, he was satisfied with the evidence, and he should fine the defendant in the mitigated penalty of 251., which was instantly paid, and handed over to M1r. Beverley by Mr. Edison, the chief clerk. Ellen Phillips, 33, an wnfortunate creature, who appeared to be in a very sickly state, being eaten Up with disease,was charged with attempting to commit suicideby taking poison in the public street. The MAGISTRATr asked why she meditated suicide? She replied that she was in such a dreadful state of I11ness that she was tired of her existence. She had applied a, the Lock Hospital and other hospitals, but they allrefu8ed to admit her. Inspector Mackenzie here informed his worship that he had no doubt she would be admitted into St. Thomaes Hospital at once, as a letter was found on her, which, if presented there, would prove successful. The MAGISTRATE directed the constable to convey her thither directly in a cab, ho ping the hospital authorities would admit her ; and about half an hour afterwards Boorman returned to the court and informed his worship that she was received. LAMBETH.-It wil be recollected that on Tuesday last Augustus Srederick Cordner, a fashionably dressed young man, was charged at this court with being concerned, with others not im custodv, in burglarionsly breaking into the dwellinghouse of Mr. Mathew Moran, a hosier, carrying on business at 28, High-street, Newington, and carrying away property to a considerable amount, and the evidence tjhen addaced appeared perfectly conclusive of his guilt. One disinterested and respectable witness swore positively to having seen him drive up to the house of the prosecutor at about 5 o'clock on the morning of the robbery, get out of a cab, and enter tho house, while a second witness not only corroborated this testimony, but swore positively to having seen the prisoner carry two large packages out of the prosecutor's shop, put them into the cab, and drive off with them. In addition to this was the fact that the accused had called at the prosecutor's shop between 9 and 10 on the night of the robbery to invite him to a bali at Willis Rooms, and bronghtwith him a person of suspicions appear. ance, whom he left outside, and who had been observed by Mr. Moran to be looking into and taking particular notice of the shop. The case appea,ed so perfectly conclusive, as before stated, of the guilt of the accused that the Magistrate remanded the prisoner for further examination to Monday next. Yesterday Mr. Solomon attended before the Hon. G. C. NORTOIT, and, placing before him the printed report of the examination of the accused, said he had an application to make to his worship to liberate the young man on bail, and he felt quite satisfied that his worshio, after heaing his statement and the testimony of the witnesses he had in his attendance in proof of a clear alih, would grant his request. In the first place, he wished to say thatthe young man was the son of a most respectable wiaow lady, whose husband had been an offlcer in the artny, and, though apprenticed to the prosecutor some six or seven years ago, did not follow the business, but lived with his mother, and had devoted latterly a great portionof his timi to the manufacture of a table cover of a peculiar and beaut1ful descrption; and, in fact, was a personthe most unlikely to be gnuty of theoffence imputed to him. His mother, having proofs in her possession that her son had slept at Dsrtford on thernightof therobberv, proceeded thither on the day before, and on presenting a bill, in her possesaion, to Mr. Bray, of the Bull Inn, that gentleman at once recognized it as one given to two young men who had arrived by the 11 o'clock train at Dartford, and slept at his house on that night. He was then informed of the fact that one of the yo' men had been taken up and was then under remand, an he at once volunteered to come to town and do what he could in the matter. On reaching town he at onco proceeded to Horsemonger-lane Gaol, and then at once reoo. nised Mr. Cordner, as one of the young men who had slpt in her house on the night of the 22d. He was however present, and would tell his own story. Mr. Bray said, that on the night of the 22d of last month, while his servants were engaged in closing, the young nian he had seen at the prison, with another, came to his hoise and engaged a bed for the night. They had some supper, and caUled for their bill, and that before his worship was the bill supplied. They subsequentlyw ent to bed and did not leave the house until half-pest 10 on the following day, when (Mr. Bray) understoodMr.Cordnerwasgoing tospend the day with a friend at Wilmington. He saw him agin about half-past 10 on the same night, when he said lhe thought he should want a bed, but it appeared he started by train for tow. In reply to a question from the niagistrato, Mr. Bray said, that therewas no train paused from 11 O'clock at night till 8 in the morning, so that it was quite impossi ble the young man could cometo town and get backagainto Milahome. Mr. NonToxi observed that the case certainly looked like one of mistaken identity, Mr. Neale, who was employed for theprosecution, aid, it was not his rvis.to keep a person unjy in prison, but ht understood from the officer that there was a strong cae against the prisoner. It was ultimately arranged, as Mr. Elliott was the oommitting m te, that the case should stand over to the following (this dy).

rR.ESPONSIBLE PLATRONAGE. TO THE EDITOR OF TEt TIMES. Sir,-The position of Lords Clanricarde, Panmure, and Grey, that it is unbecoming and ungenerous in officers of the army to disparage tho professional claims and character of any ono who may have been selected for a superior command, is in itself a sound and just one. But, then, it implies that the appointment in question has been made on the ground of merit only, and with a single eye to the public service. I am not about to express any opinion whether such was or was not the case in respect to the selection of General Ashbumnham for the commandof the Chinese oxpodition, but it is unhappily too notorious that official patronoge is far from being uniformly determined by this principle. What, then, remans for the great body who are wronged when an incompotent person is appointed to any office, but to protest against tho sacrifice of pablic and pnvate interests, and to hold the offendingminister responsible for the wrong which he has done. It is on general principles as improper for a clergyma to remark upon the unfitness of bishops selected by the Prima finister as it is for military men to take exception to generals nominated for high command. But what other resource have they? Neitherthe clergy nor the laity of the church have any voice in the appointment of their bishops. Nothing is left to them but an appeal to public opinion, and public opinion, I rejoice to believe, is at last beginning to bear upon the distributors of ecclesiastical patronage. Save for the fear of that, the Premier for the time beig is at perfect liberty to oblige his political supporters or his private friends at the expenso of the church. The parties chiefly conceraed are never consulted. A diocess may be handed over to a subservient politician or a religious partisan without hesitation and withont remonstrance. So it has been; and unless we can contrive to make the Minister feel the inconvenience of injustico and corruption, so it will continue to be. Until, therefore, the members of oar church have succeeded in obtaining some constitutional control on the appointment of bishops, they should welcome the check which is afforded by public opinion; and I have fuU confidence that the press, which demands the ablest generals to command our armies and the most learned judges to preside in our courts of justice, will require also that our episcopal sees should be occupied by none but men of soand learning, fervent charity, and laborious, self-denvine lives. ANTI-JOB.
TEE BUsLoP OF EXETE&.-At the recent trienisal visitation of the Bishop of Exeter, the churchwarders of the parish of St. Olave, Exeter (Messrs. Escott and Husband) made a presentment to the rev. Chancellor Martin (who acted for the right rev. prelate in his absence, which was caused by indisposition) in reference to several innovatiBns introduced by the rector, the Rev. R. Roper, of which the parishioners generally complained. Thepresentmentoontained the following passages:-"The rector has introduced a novelty which, at the call of one of the oldest, most constant attendaats at public worship, and one of the most respectable and wealthy of the parishioners, we are bound to present to your Lordship. That novelty is the substitution of the vrords of theHum,se Noted for the accnstomed psalmody. The parishioner referred to states that he vwill not attend the church while the 'vmwnaZ Notcd is sang there. We present this book to your Lordship. We complain of it as inculcating Romish doctrine, such as VWirin Mar worship-the holy womb of the Virgin, Mary bemg Iglorfed in such a manaer as to lead to tho idea of the imS maculate conception, which dogma, your Lordship is aware, has recently been promulgated by the Pope, and, as it seems to us, is greatly insinuated, if not absolutely taught in this bymnal. Our duty is, however, to present the book to tho attention of your Lordship; because it supersedes the ancient Psalmody, because it has been presented to us as an object of offence, and because, as it seems to us, it teaches Romish doctrines. For instance your Lordship will find the celebration of the 'Holy Wom' followed by the glorification of the Cross. The Cros is spoken of as if it were a being of a superior nature. 'The Cross shines forth in mystic glow' (page 47 It is apostrophized, '0 tres of beauty, tree of light 1' Lthful Cross! above all other, one andonlynoble tree;' 'Sweetest wood, and sweetest iron.' These, my Lord, are expressions which we find in the hymns which this divine of the Protestant Church has introduced in the place of the ancient Protestant Psalmody; and we, as faithful churchwardens, present the book as a cause of offence to the laity in the parish, and we pray your Lordship to deal with it as in your wisdom may seem meet. We find the weekly use of the offertory also a cause of offence- but we have nothing to present on this subject; we mereiy instance it as one of the causes why some of the parishioners cease to attend the church. Some who do niot object to this form of collection find that they cannot afford to give weekly, and refraia from coming to church ratherthan refue to give. It is our opinion that weekly collections are not wise or judicious for the end in view. The rector has introduced a novelty in the collection, using bags for the alms instead of the decent basn' prescribed in the Rubric." The Bishop ha sent the following reply to the churchwardens"On the first matter presented, the HymnaZ iNoted, I remark that there being no order of the church for the use of any speial pealmody, and the use of palmody at all resting upon usage, except so far as anthems are by implication clearly admitted, it is difficult to pronounce judicially; but, as a matter of expediency and in the way of counsel, I should think that it would be better that this book having been objected to should be not oontinued, had I not been informed by Mr. Roper that it has been used without objection during more than a year, and that it is a tranls. lation of ancient hymns of the church which ArebbishoD Cranmer was anxious to have had translated when the BooN of Common Prayer was drawn up. I thinlk, indeed, th%t there are phras in it likely to excite scandal. At the same time, I must add that, on looling into the hook, I fiud many pamages soored which are free from allreonable objection, aud in which I am surprised that any Chridtian should we anything worthy of blame or doubt, Upon the whole, I. leave this ratter,'vithoat special recommendation, to the discretion of the minister, as I have not airi ht to ord* Any other hymnal. 2.

- MEETING OF CONVrjCATIO_. Yesterday morning the archbisF .op, the bishops, the dean,| txehdeacons, the proctors elec. ,ed by the various chapters, {:nd tho proctors througho at the province of Cantetbury assembled, in accord.ance with the Rloyal writ, at Wotwinser, This beint, a new convocation, and as meay fresh mecbers have ]-ecn elected, more than ordirary interest wns excited,. and an uausually large number of members was preser s. Prior to the co'4m encomenb of the genemui ba?lness for which convoCalon was specially convened haÂ§.h houses met in the Jerusalem Chamber, vrhere prayer were read bearo the n.aited bodies by the Rev. John Thornas, B.C.L., oe4r of Allhallows, Barking, the arckbishopz chaplain. The Dean of St. Paul's and the Dean of liorwich then 'presented to his Gerace the Archbishop the Very Rev. fjilbert EUiott, D.D. Dean of Brisbal, who had been unani- mously elected Prolocutor by the unariiwous vote of the clergy. The ArchWhop of Canterbury exprssed his hwarty approval of the choice which hrad been enade by tLe clergy, and his Grace and the bishops then rfrEred. THE UPPER HO1USE. Their L3ordaships assembled in Quee Anne's Bouviy-office. His Grwce tho Archbishop of Cantarbary presided. Thero were also present the Bishops of 'Winchester, St. Asaps, vand Chichbstor. The Bishop of % ondon, having been de. tained elsawhere in the discharge di his episcopal duties, did uaot attend until a later pereiod oite day. His Graee the AnCHd IEsopsaidl that, in aoordance with 'astom, he had drawn up sn ad&-ess to the -Orown on the opening of convocation, and he now submiittedit,for the -puroval of his right rev. bretbon. Dr. TB&VsRS TWIss, the vicar-general, road the iddress _which his-Grace had prepared. After it thad undergone sOM3 discussion,'directions were given that the Lower House should be summoned into the resence di their Lo8iships. The 1rolocutor attended, Iing accompanied by-the Very Rev. Dr. .G. Peacook, Dean'ejf Ely; the Very Rev. Dr. . -H. MUE man, Dean of b p.:lrs the Hon. and Very Rev. :Dr. G. Pellew, Dean of ;iorwich; the Von. Benjamin -Barrisor, Archdeacon of.-1uaidstone; the Rev. ,lr. Wordsworth,ACanon of 'Westminiter; the Veon R. Freer, Arch*deacon of Hereford; and the Rev. Dr. M'Caul, Rector of 'Bt. Yagnus the Martye, and Prootor 'for (the Clergy of -Londen. The ArcBMISrOP, addessing the Prolocutor, -said their Lordships had been engoged in considering an address to the Queen, but had not yet;decided upon its.precise form. He hoped, however, to-be able very shortly to send it down for the consideration -of 4he Lower House. Ho wished to direct 'the attention of the Lower House, at this -stage of the proceedings, tothe propriety of organizing a committee, -such as that which wes formed during the last oonvoca'tion, for considering the best means of - etending the mis- sionary work of the chturch at home and abroad. The PRoLoCeUrou said the members af thedLower House vould give the subject their best consideration. Their Lordships, ron the retirement of the representatives of the Lower House, again proceeded to considerthe various paragraphe of the -proposed address. On arriving at one parograph, which referred to the sittings of the Convocation and the education ef children in the principles of the Church of England, The Bishop of O}xrORD said there hed-been many publi. ations which discussed the proceedings of convocation, statements to the effect that the prelatee who assembled in -the Upper House were adopting surreptitious means -for the purpose of consulting upon subjects upon which they were not duly called together by the Crown. He was unwlling that theor should be anything in the address which they were about to transmit to the Grown which might appear to favour that great mistake, for -it was an entire mistake in reference to the position of.convocation at the .present moment. (Hear, hear.) The legal constitution of convocation was this:-lt was called together and opened under the Queen's summons, to consider weighty mattes 'for the security of the church. It was called together just as the Imperial Parliament was-called together, 'to consider weighty and urgent business, ard when-it was so called together it had every legal qualification it could ever possess for oonsideration, discussion, and deliberation upon every- subject upon which its membersgmight deem it fit to -enter in connexion with the advancement of the -interests of the church. (Hear, hear.) There wesnolegal document of any kind'wihich could be sent down by the-Crown which *could inCrease those powers of convocation. The only document which could, under any circumstances, be -snt down from the Crown was a license to make canons, which license had. nothing whatever to do with a consultation upon other matters connected with the Church. When convocation was in its most active session in-f ormer reigns there was no license from the Crown asked for or received, and at those times some of its greatest -works were donedone in precisely such sessions as they were holding now. Evenif tne-convocation thought it needful to make canons, the -course that must be adopted was& this :-The canon must be prepared and deliberated upon by convocation before any communication could be made -to the Crown 'upon- the- subjoct, so that the Crown might have ample means of knowing what it was about 'being asked to do. After these steps had been taken it would be the- duty oi the convocation fairly to draw up the canon, and-then tc pray the Royal license that it might pass This was an important principle, which he was very anxious should be generally understood, more especially because a notion pre. vailed that there was something quan 'illegal and surreptitious in the proceedings of convocation as at present carried on, .whereas its members were only doing-that which they were entitled and, indeed, required to do -by the supreme authority of the land. The Crown, 'he 'repeated, could give convocation nothing more than it at prrecent possessed, and nothing could interfere wlth its doliberations except an abrupt termination of the discussions, analogous in every aspect to a dissolution of the Imperial Parliament. Under these circumstances, he should be very-sorry if in their address to the Crown they should seem-to ask for a power which the Crown could not grant-namely, power to deliberate upon such matters as the- education of * children on the principles of the church, or any others, because the Crown had no means of granting those-powers. Such a request would also seem to imply that they met to discuss nothiog except under the direct authority of the Crown, or that they were doing something which was inconsistent with their duty as loyal subjeets . of the Queen. He thought convocation as at present constituted might be very useful to tho people in giving an opportunity to the clergy, and especially to the clergy of the Lsower -House of * convocation, an opportunity of deliberating upon any alterations in the law or in the church which -might be rendered needful by the changing state of society-not by attempting direct. legislation, but by giving them-an opporttunity of exchauging publicly their diferent opinions, discussing all pinciples in the face of the nation, so that when Parliament came, as the supreme Igslature, to deal with those subjects they might do it with thegreat advantage of knowing what were the views of the apirituality -not from one-sided statements made in .an unlawful assembly, but in -the face of opposition -and in the presence of men holding different views on church dis*-cipline. Parliament - in such circumstances might pro. ed to the consideration of thosesaored subjects with a far larger andI more--experimental knowledge of what the 'real bearing of their.ats would be than they could 'by any possibility have by any other mode of proceeding. He (the right rev. prelate) -should therefore earnestly wish that their humble address. to Her Majesty should express that .tho iealousY which still existed in reference to tho .meeting of convocation had Led inevitably, but most unfortunately, to this result, that tkeir meetings had been so hurried espe. cially in the Lower li!ouse, where there were a great many members anxious to ompress their opinions, that -they had been obliged to cometo.a conolusion upon grave matters before they had had timo duly to weigh them, and that all they needed to render'thir present usefulness much,greater vas, that the Lower Hoar shlould have opportunitiesof frec discuission, and that tbey should have longer time to conSider those measures which would in due course come-under . legislative consideratiGe. (Hear, hear.) Tho Bishop of ST. DA,.s's expressed his entire conc;urrence with the view takon by - the Bishop of Orelerd, and .hoped they would be -fully reported, in order -that it might go forth to the conntry that the jealousy which existed in reference to the proceedings of convocation migbt be-dispelled. HIe wished more particularly to ob. serve that the Bishop of (-)xford&s remarks contained a die. * tinet answer,.(o two diffetent and exactly opposite classes .of objections x7hich were -raised pgainst the present meat. .ngs of coavocation rne objection which proceeded from those..porsons who 4-s.ght to make the mneetings objects. of islousy and, of suspicion, and who represented that th3 members were . ondeavouring to obtain a surreptitious adantage, to steal a march .nd to obtain powers for *hich they had no authority in law; and, on the other hid, an objection from otherparties, whence it.wee represented that their proceedings were a mnockery and. a -force. The iBihgp of Oxford had shown --that tho proceediuns of convsor,o, eon the one hand, were perfectly legal,within usage dlaev, .and, on the other hand, -that, so for from being a fasrce cad .a .ackery, they were a Je'itimate proeeding, and, al b, -'they night never re.ceive the -annetion fof the Cror-to enacthvauious canon, -there was.Do need of any such sgotion,in order that their proceediags nightbhelattended wvit .very rnepostant conse.quen&es and bear very valuable freit. f Hear,- ear.) These, -he thought, were sufficient answee,t o those zvhonraid these ,proceedingswerecondweted in an illegal or.3nnsptitious maanner. The Bishop.of ST. AsLPH said he kadlong beliered that -onvocation eeialt be.readered benefial, and-cfgreat value 4o the charc,i, ,ot cs a legislative, but as a consulting Ihody. He thouht i ;orever, that the ,ninds of those who at present objected '; the convocation mig,ht be spedi disabused if the remarks of ths Bishop of Oxford were fully znd fairly considered. Hes, hear.) Herihouldv very-much ;regret the circunestmce if tke Crown gave convocation tie power of making -canons, 'because he did not think that canons made exclusisivty by0Chlrchmen would ever zeet the -views of the peopAe of Engknd. At the name time, he ,thought that the friendly feeling of the laity would induce 4hem to receive any suggesrioza that were made byconvocation with great favoee. { sear, hear.) He was glad that 4heEentiaents which had been*ezxressed that dry had beea publicly made, and that they vould go foith to the eountry, for he believed that the resul would b- that consoecatioa would b3 mead most useful aq a body-a body which Parlis, ment and the Crown might consult,'wienever there were any circumstances of difficalty. The Arohbishop of CAcren BuRY said it had been properly remarked by one of his right rev. brethren that the convocation was summoned by Royal authority to consider of divers weighty and urgent matters affecting the interest and security of the church. The convocation was called together in a mo,;t solemn manner, and the members were put upon their loyalty and allegiance to the Tbrone to conduc$ their proceedings for the benefit of the church and ntion. C'onsequently, he, beling considered as having the prerogativo oF either allowing the deliberations of convocaian to tal:e place, or to prorogne the sittings, had soumeti,es been called npan to meet the clergty of his province ..li9B ghaPsejd, an4l tXo discharge thn. witla the 'emasu tht there was no business upon whic;h they -were called Ul1on. to enter. He wished now to sp.y that as lon as the m> i ber, of convocation continued to be summonea mn the solemn manner which was now the cu,soui he should 'not consider it within his province to disebarge so ungracious a duty as to proroge their sittings without giving full op. Portunity for the discussion of euch matters as the members I ight consider needful for the interests of the church. (Hear, hear.) That was the reason why he had not listened to the many remonstranceswhich had been made to him both publicly and in private, calling upon him to pt a sumnary ead to the deliberations of convocation. Such course he believed would 'be opposed to the duty he owed to his Sovereign, who had'commande him to call convoca. tion togcethr. (Htear, hor.) The address, after wndergoing various alterations, was then read la lts amendedl form as dllows: *"We. your maesty's lat.u subjects, he archbishop, bishops and cerwof Othe proaince do Cantsrbury, eni convocation asembled, a>preach poor Macesty with the assura,ne of ourloyaland affectIonate attachment to yur Mstyp6 threuouc.d person.

"' Inthe promotion of public education, a question which Intimately 0oncerns us as ministd of religion, we thaukfully acknowledge the liberal aid affordel us by pbUle grants. The attention directed towards the instruction of the sousa is a mnarbed feature of the present age; but there is constant reason to meoret that the early removal of children from schools tco often engages tbemn pre*maturely in the active business of life before they bave receiveA the full advantages or a Eound education, and before they have been properly instructed in their duty towards God and mn-. *Xt Is difficult to suggest the remedy, but if it should Plnes your Maesty, In addition to that generalsummons In your MaiJeetWawit to trat of oertain difficult ana urgent affn oonoerning Your Majesty, the security an d defence of the church of Engiand, and the Deace aud^-ranquillty and public good of your kingdom and your subJects of the same, to oommit to our speCal deliberation thi or any other question affecting the intereets of our holy religon, or the usefulnes of the church, we trust that we shell not be found unmindful of the solemn character of the fanctions we are caled to discharge and shall.conduct our proseedings under the Divine blessng, and with the dilgenoe which would become us in obeying your Majesty's commands. " Hitheto the shortness of time given to our oonsultatiou has In a great measure frustrated the advantages whicb we humbly trust-would resmlt if frther opportunity were afforded for aseertaining the opinions of the clergy by diussion in convocation. -Ieanwhilse we assure your Majesty that any diffoulties which mag impede our endeavours to convey the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Chrit, as the ruling principle of life, to every pariah and to every Individual in the land wil rather serve to stimulate than to restrain our exertions. We bave the encouragement of knowing that While"we attempt to carry into effecw this Important parposs we are ;romoting the earnest wih and prayer of your Majesty, whom God has appointed to be our supreme Goversor oa earth, and whom we trust He may long preserve o see the increase oS temporal propAity and the growth of true religion throughout your Majesty's dominions." The Bishop of Lomrlox (who had entered the room only a few minutes previously) said he objected to that portion of the adldress which implied that the sittings of convocation should be prolonged. He had very grave doubts as to the propriety of that particular clause. The Archbishop of CANTERBuy sgaid that the consideras tion of the address having occupied the serious attention of their Lordships during the whole of the morning, it was rather late to offer objections. ,His Grace then put the question to their Lordships, who affirmed the address and the Prolocutor of the Lower House was summoned in order that he might take it down for approvaL The Bishop of CncsrC M presented a Xetition from 156 beneficed clergymen of his diocess in opposition to the com- the burlal service in the case of persons who hadnotoriousiy ledev .He quite agreed with the petitioners in thinking that for a remedy of the grievance they were not to look to an alteration of the service A lengthened discussion ensued, and the petition was ordered to lie on the table. The Bishop of LIcnFiELD presented a petition, signed by a large number of the clergy of his diocess, complaining that the fees exacted on account of the consecration of churches and churchyards very materially interfered with the prin. ciple of church extension. The petitioners prayed that petitions in such cases ht be presented by the rural dean or the archdeacon, so that al offlcial and legal charges might be avoided. The opinion of the petitioners was that the fees of the registrars interfered with church extension, and therefore the matter was one of great importance. He might mention that in his own diocese a gentleman who was well known both for his liberality and his zeal in church matters bad refused to convey a site simply on account of the fees. (Hear.) The Bishopa of OXFORD and SAISnuaspokeinhih terms of the legal officials of their dioceses; and eventually l the matter was referred to Dr. Travers Twiss, the vicar- general, in order that he might report upon it so soon as he had- consulted the necessary authorities, and had made up his mind on the sabject. Their Lordahips then adjonrned their meeting. LOWER HOUSE. The Lower House assembled in the Jerusalem Chamber -at,li'oclock. The Very Rev. Dr. Elilott, Dean of Bristol, officiated as prolocustor. There was a very large attendance of members, among whom we noticed the Hon. and Rev. Lord Saye and Sele, Canon of Hereford; the Hon. and Rev. Lord Compton, rector of Castle Ashley, Northamptonshire; the Very Rev. Dr.!Peel, Dean of Worcester; the alon. and Very Rev. Dr. ellew, Dean of Norwich; the Very Rev. the Dean of Canterbury. the Very Rev. Dr. MiUman, the Very Rev. Dr. 'Peacock, Dean of Ely; the Very Rev. the Dean of Lincoln; the Venerable the Archdeacons of London (Hale), Middlesex (Sinclair), Maidstone (Harrison), Westminster (Bentinck Taunton (Denison), Bath (Gunning), Lewes (Otter), 6ord (Tatam), Totness (Froude), Bristol (Thorpe), Hereford (Freer), Nottingham (Wilkns), Berks (Ranall),Backs (Biokersteff), Rochester (in), St. Alban's (Grant), Wilts (Macdonald), Montgomery (Clive), Wor. cester (Hone). Coventry (Sandford); the Rev. Dr. M'CauL the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Best, the Rev. Sir Henry Thompson, the Rev. Dr. Coleridge; and the Rev. Messrs. Chesshyre, Baker, Randolph,Vincent,WDliams, Hippealey,Omms1nney, F. Vincent, Cmlughton, Fendall, Browne, Davis, Copleston, Murray, dassingberd, BuTton, M'Kenzie, Price, Harding, Hopper, Mills, Layton, Lloyd, Gifett, Bloomfield, Canon, Caswell, Eyton, Briacoe, Hedwas, Hughes, Seymour, and Woodgate; there were also proctors present from the Chapters of Westminster, Chichester, Hereford, Lichfield, LIncoln, and Rochester. The -PROLOCUTOR having briefly opened the proceedings, by announcing that his Grace the President had granted letters-patent appointing Mr. George Burchett, of Doctors'commons, the actuary, Mr. Buocssrv then proceeded to call over the rolls con. taming the names of the members. This prooeeding occapied a considerable timie, at the conclusion of which The 'Vicar, Archdeacon HARRIsoN, suggested that it would save much time if the prolocutor were for the future to declase that all members who were present should take part in the proceedings; but those who were absent were contumacious. The Rev. Canon WORDSWORTH then presented a petition from the clergy of the archdeaconry of Colchaster, complaining that the clergy of that archdeconry were not represented in the synod, and further stating that the two proctors who had been elected had not been allowed to sit in the Lower House. He (the rev. canon) should there. fore move that the petition be referred to the Committee of Privileges. The PReLOCUEOR said that was the only ocurse which could be adqpted. Several petitions on various subjects were then presented, and -referred to the Committee of Gravamisa ci Beforsmcnda. The PROLGOUIron then appointed the following gentlemen as a Committee of Gravamina:-The Deans of Worcester, Canteebury, and Westminster; Archdeacons Grant and EIarrison; the Rev. Canon Wordsworth, Rev. J. Randolph, Rev. - Freer, Archdeacon Sinclair, Archdeacon *Sandford, HIon. and BRev. S. Best, Rev. F. Maskingherd, Rev.eMtr. Wiliss -ev. A. Oxenden, and the Rlev. F. MOM BURIAL SERIVICE. -ahe Rev. F. V 3eaNr presented a petition from the clegy of the dioowes of Chichester, complaining of being compelled to read the Burial Service over persons who laid violent hands on themselves, or died in a state of sin. Miae petition was ordered to be referred to the commnittee. The Ven. the Archdeacon of TAUNTOX said it would be as.scell that the Reuse shonld not be pledged to the petition,,for this reaeon-it imputed to the civil power the evils wibEch they all oomplained of. Now, he denied this. The-evil arose from the meglect by the ordinaries of the Churob, 'whose duty it was (but who refused to do it) to pre. sent the,persons complained of ; and even when they were presented dbe ordinares refused to carry out the powers vested in itheir hands-namely, that of excommunication. It was -not, therefore, te -fault of the civil power. The Rev. eCanon Wo Rnzworn them gave notice of the followZng instion:- * ThattbejUwer Roam of Convoection of ttie province of Canterbury entswtUiAs a erateful ti eute of the Publio Eericoe rendered by the Very 3er. the Dieanof Ely while presidizz as prelmotor atita sesdons. and also in *ranetlng the busnea ofdkeommitteee and desires to 'ecord itsorfinondhat the sucoczi wbich hm reently attended the mrival of symodleSactlon in thks ountry in attritiutable, under tha Xiviueble sg, iu a ooasiderable degmre,t the .aility. judgment, dienee, and moderation which ealacterdad iori owhsrge of 'he Imptnt dutles4f psrLocutor duri,gs Iis tuu of theoe.' - The Ven. the Airdadeacon of XoT sramkof s onded the MotiGo.

The Very inevr the Dean of Sr. PAUL'S then rose and said he begged to submit a motion of which he had cgven noticerabout 2monthsago. t was asifollows :- - "1To propose a petition to the Upper House. praying their Lordihipi to consider the propriety of presenting an address to Her Majesty for the dIscontInuance of the order x ring the use of the, oasiounl services for tled th of N toember,tre ath of January, end the 29th of may." The question was one in -which every member of the Church wa interested. (Hear, hear.) The House was aware thsa there was considerable difficulty as to the authority on which thes services were established; and he therefore held that any services which did not carry with them the religious mind of the people were useless. At present these services were systematically neglected by the clergy. He would not e-nter into the services themselves, further than to say that they were composed at a time of great zeligious excitement, when great disturbances were taking place, aend he did not therefore think it necessary thar thev should be continued any longer, Even if they were stripped of their objectionable parts, it was a questiot whotnor there was any use in retaining them. He did not think that in any congregation inthe United Kingdom there was any reverence for them, and he therefore thought that the time had aririved when they should be abolished, 'which he considered would be a great boon to the country at large. There were four occasional services, but he had only dealt with three, and his reason for that was that the fourth had reference to the accession of the Crown. (hear.) he then moved his resolution. The Ven, the Archdeacon of CovE aTRY seconded the motion. He had consulted the feelings of the clergy in his arhldearonry, and he found that they were all in favour of the abolition of the services. The Rev. Dr. MCAuL objected to the mnotion, The servicer we established by Act of Parliament, and therefore the Queen had no powers or authority to alter them. The calendar recognizd the services, and the calenr d was sanc tioned by Act of Parliament. These were not the times to aTempt tointerFer VInT the matter;6so mhan attempts bedlrecently besuentde, tod reve Popeasn In this country, andyvvere s o tmany dstin hed members of the Church hadIleftItand geone, overp tce theChuc qof Rome, thathe coertainly thoughthatitdelas. impoithic. The rev,pgentleman then gaveanotice of an, Paul'send pembodeing his The Yen. Archdeacon HAoE said, he was taken by surprise in being called upon to expres an opinion on one of the most important questikos which could be submitted to the Church. He, for one, was not then prepared to expres anf opnono the subject. Archdeacon GRLAIR objected to the question being gone into then, and moved the folowing amendment:- The aRcoemmte of thISTO H se ,hoited touexamineyhae Tauhi the sdepaatoe sev esdfor N ombje, Janua wan itay werdaw to a nd ariecappin ted be ried, n s nd the lglorues ihth saeveall posihonl to resor Heron tfe e thi Thoesed serics owhad beenl sthroug ather qugretdibrtionesaw on theriu Convoafos band,e imortathe wrcpe aNrlled ipn, wtheoutbany tomaeatisuch remmndtion eatind th tme seservnicesasntheyt therab advlentages thes rme morato n in A showin men t ho whbthehee erncisleconded, the ctrry theq irev H at WexessGAHe said, oh thenougihvnt A hdeao sota ave athomen ent woud met his tobect, swhich as wprinciallytx toe avoidh asfiringastilye onesonilporandthat qne. tbion,faor enwihteenrraslygionuastepsrroundiedI aparntyo ithe mn leg ireaskec u et. he confes the didhotshee ahiony wae eay throughthe r qeTionHe sawe, fon the auends ntoalrconiion oaeda God' mrcies auend chzastiemets,I thise advanm ervies of ethese mpmt morati n t en showsin en o t heir at ec, yese prtinies now atn wfo ind bcaryr invensby llona. rclmhn Them Ifared. to exNcessTH sawd,o the oter,ie that o they also havetheeffect ofpromotg then pan artsrpit nwa pevaleThin the Church, ras manyhue onfe l oniy oad thae one which fallse ino withther religiousapredices. be oapend o the cleragyp were taked whether theywouldvwish their ahetion hea rdt tthae the prould wish to etaion witha ones wich Hesronled withat the eel iEnsegs, hut notuteo it.~~~~~~~~ Theus r. hded thouh oarh df ec Gral ntes anment Dche Arc o hdematter yet put t sendea tramoion;frfl and thoirh Thes' diirev.

The Bev. H. A. WooDwArg seconded the motion, and after sorae discussion it was agreed to, and ordered to form a rtioa of the Address. We VYe. Archdeacon DF.xsox met various objections to the proceedings of Convocation, which were also urged in the Upper House by the Bishop of Oxford, and which -were adnitted by the Archbihop of Canterbury (as will. -be seen by his grace's speech) to have no weight, as proved by the writ of summons under which convocation meets fo: deliber-tion. The arguments were precisely the eame as those advanced during their lordships' discussions, and. the short speech of bis graoe the archbishop, reported in the discussions of the Upper House, may be taken as a general anawer to all objections on this point. The Rev. Mr. Mackenzie's addition, which was agreed to, was as followi;:- "At the same time we would desire to ofrer our regpectful condoltnee upon the grief which b ectl allen upon you Majesty aud she Jloyal f,,nrjly in the I of th at aulable Pr Wces whose death mrJk lbthe remoralof a generation of yper jsty' Illu- tslousHn,'e" This was o'rdered to be added to paragraph 2.

CHAMB O 'CONSPIACY. John IHir.d May, of Heggin.lane, city, and Sthnleystree' Bimlico. and Wila;m Taylor, of No. 1, Church-pase, Grnsha. n street, were again brought up at Guildhall (the latter on bail) before Alderman H Of3spHuy to answer tho cbage of conspiring to defraud lÂ£r. Gorman, of Lurgun, of a qn-ntity of cambric handkerchiefs valued at 5001. und Mr. Lawson, a manufacturer of the same place, of similar goods to the amount of 6001. Mr. Morgan, of the firm of Humphreys, Son, and Morgan, appeared as before for the prosecution. Mr. Huddleston, instructed by Messr Sole, Tarner, and Co., attended for Taylor; and Mr. Wontner defended May. MTr. Bodkin, instructed by Mr. Pontifex, attended to watch the case for Mr. Meeldng, of Holborn.hill. The court was crowded to excess throughout the exami. nation by persons interested in commercial matters, and hundreds returned disappointed in obtaining admission. The evidence taken at the opening of this case on Saturday last was first read over by Mr. Martin, the chief clerk, the facts of which, to render the proceedings less complicated,it may be as well to Etate briefly as follows: -It appeared that Mfr. Gorman, a cambric handkerchief manufacturer of Lurgan, county of Armagh, Ireland, having a quantity of goods on hand, applied to Taylor to dispo- of them for him, and he agreed to do so at a commission of 2i per cent. Mr. Gorman, returned to Ireland, leaving the savaples with Taylor, who on the 5th of March last wrote, asking him if he could make up a parcel of handkerchiefs of a different quality, to Eell with the lot of which he had a sample, as the market had been glutted by other mauOacturers from Lurgan. On the 12th of March Taylor Wrote again, stating that May had offered to purchase the good a a discount of 22A off part, and 27. off the rest, the terms half cash in one month, and the other half by a 60 days' bill at bankers, and that the Lurgan bankes knew May's bills. Mr. Gorman made inquiries which induced him to declinc May's offer, and on the 19th of March Taylor wroto again, saying that Myers and Co., late of 45, Ludgate-hill, would bay the goods at 27i off net, and give cash check for 100L on delivery, and the rest in three or four bills, having from 30 to 60 days to run, and endorsed by Myers and Co. He also stated that Myers would purchase the articles, and they were good for 10,0OUO., and referred Mr. Gorman to several persons in Belfast, to satsfy himself with regard to Myera's responsibility. Upon these representations Mr. Gorman accepted the offer, and forwarded the goods on receiving Taylor's instructions, under date the 22d of March. The invoice amounted to 893. 83. 6d., less 274 per cent. discount, amounting to 245!. 13s. lOd., leaving tie balance 6471. 14s.8d. On the 4th of April Taylor wrote to acknow. ledge the delvery of the goods, and said he had agreed to let Myers have some of them at 12s. 9d. and 13s 9d. per dozen, which althongh A very low price, he assured Mr Gorman was not so low as other goods he was sellin. On the 7th of April Mr. Gorman received a letter from Taylor to the following effect:- "8ar,-Ihad sent oser to meon5aturday aftenoon a checkfrom 1.ye, and Co. for Â£81l 10 and gold Â£15 81O by Way, the party who told the handkecchlefa for Myen cad Co.. and thinkiDg itetisage that Mlr.

He sass he h1s neverseen them, anl did not know theybadbeendeiered . . . I bave ever found May honourable," . On the 8th of April Mr. Gorman received another letter from Taylor, enclosing a check from Myers for 1001. and stating that May was very ill in bed and unable to ieave London, and expressing his own conviction that Myers was responsible for the goods, as the instructions given by Myers for their delvery had been carried out to the letter. On the 10th of April Mr. Gorman came to London and asked Taylor why he let May have his goods, and he replied that 31ay obtained them when he was out. Several other interviews took place between Mr. Gorman,Taylor, and Mr. Turner, the solicitor, to consider what means there were cf obtainiug redress, and the result was that May and Taylor were given into custody. Woodward, one of Mr. Charles Meeking's buyers, deposed that he purchased these gloods of May on two different days, amounting to 64&. 14s. 6d. and 591 3s. 6d., and that ho paid forthemin two checks, one for2501. andanotherforthebalancepayableto M ay. gMr. Gorman was then recalled, and said,-I packed the goods in four boxes, and directed them with the invoices to William Taylor, No. 1, Church-passage, Greyham-street. The invoioes were made out to Myers and Co. GeorgeJary, recalled, said.-Thoflrstinvoicerepresents the goods for which I received the two checks. The third cheek was given me upon the second invoice. Alderman HjPsernxBy.-Have you seen Myers since you v ere here last? Jary.-No, Sir. Myers here answered for himself, to say that he had attended in consequenLce of the alderman's suggestion on the last hearing. Alderman HumrHEny.-Have you ever bought or sold goods for Myers? Jary.-I have sold goods for him, but never bought any. They were some fringes from a house in Spitalfields, in which Myers was interested. John Woodward, recalled, said,-I produce the three checks I paid for the goods I bought of May for Mr. Charles Meeling. I gave a check for 2501., and another for the balance on the farst invoice of goods, and the third check I gave upon the other invoice. Alderman HUMPEHnzY.-What you said before was that you gave a check for 2501. and another for the balance. Nothing wr said about a third check. Br. Bodkin.-I think it only right, on behalf of Mr. I0eekig, to state that he proposed to Mr. Morgan to produce his books to show the transaction, and we will send for them now if required. There is always a discount for prompt payment. Mr. Morgan.-I am bound to say that 3fr. Meeking has given me every assistance. Woodward.-The discount on these goods was 2. per cent. for ready money. (laughter.) Mr. Martin.-You mean to say that a deduction of 21 per cent. was made for cash? Woodward.-Yes, Sir. Alderman EHuspnxny.-I thought you said it was a oash bargain in the firSt instance. oodward.-When I bought the goods of May it WaS agreed ths3t 21 per cent. shouild be allowed for cash. Alderman liuirrmY.-Whcee signature is on the check s? Woodward.-Mr. Meaking's, Sir. I do not know if Mr. SMeeking saw the invoices; but Mr. Evans, our cashier, is here, and he will be able to explain everything. Alderman HlssyxEtY.-Then we will have MIr. Evans examined. (To Jary) How long have Tou known Myers? Jary.-About four months. I knew him from his comingto May's warehouse. I have seen him there frequently, but I do not know what for. I cannot say I considered it as his place of business, but he was generally there, and I have seen him looking at the books. I do not recollect addresing him as if the business washis. Alderman HUMPErMY.-You havo known him for four months, and have seen him repeatedly there. You saw the invoice made out to him, and you must therefore know if the business is his, Jary.-I cannot sweaetlaat Myers was there when the invOice was lying on the desk, but I think he was. He never gave me any directions respecting the business. He spoke to me several times about some fringes which I sold for him, and I have gone to the Bank for him, but never to pay in money for him. I have paid in money to his account which I have received from May. I have seen Myers looking through May's banker's book. Alderman 1PUXrHEY.-Lok over May's banker's book, andsay if it containsentries of any checks paid in byyou. JarY.-There are several. On the 1st of April I paid in one for 506. Alderman , Hu.ernx.-Do you know what that check was for t Jary.-I supposed it was on account of the handkerchief, knowing they were bought for Myers and Co. The memorandum produced is in Myers' handwriting, dedring May to let him know what cash he had paid in to -Myers' account, and to address to him at Messrs. Bhop's, 4, Russell-place. I remember Myers being at Ralngate, for I wrote to him there on the 28th of MIarch, and he came to the warehouse on the Tuesday fol. lowing. Myers hba reoeived very large sums of money during the time I have known him out of this business according to the bankers book produced, I heard that Myers gave the order for these goods. I think I heard Mlay sy SO afterwards I last saw Myers at the warehouse on the Tuesday, about a week after these goods were sold. When he left he locked My's desk, and took the key away with him. May left the key with me to give to 5yers. I had no conversation with 31yers about these cede. I did not tell him I had sold them to Mr. Cknleug. Mr. Wontner.-Try and refresh your memory Did you not say to him that you thought you should have go; a better price from MIeeking for these goods s Jary.-I did not, nor anything of the sort. Aldarinan Hlmu'ssxltv.-Did Myers see the goods unpacked, or the samples?9 Jarg.-I do not know. Myers was present at Ma's warehouse on the Saturday when the goods arrived, ThMy had beenunpackedin Church-passge, and Talor sent them loose to ay's warehouse. I never saw the cases in which they caLne from Ireland. Johnson's cart brought them, and I helped to take them in. I wrote to Myers that night, bat did not tell him anything about these goods. I never mentioned to him that the goods had arved in H lane. Mr. Wontner.-When Myers went away did he not say he had taken a paper that would relieve him froux all respondbility ? Jai7.-le did not. The samples were lying on the counter for several days, but I did not see Myers at the offioe IwhiIe they were there. I should not like to swear that I Myers was not there, or that I did not see him looking at the samples. The delivery note produced is a memorandum of Ahereceipt of the goods from May. It isinthe handwriting of Hairby, Taylor's clerk, and it is signed by May. It is dated March Alderman HumERry.-Then, this is Taylor's delivery. book, and the receipt forthe 217 boxes of handkerch ef Is signed "J. H May, for Myers and Co. "but Taylor, in his lettor to Mfr. C'orman, says that May interoepted the goods beore they were delivered to Taylor. Xr. Woutuer.--That is simply a mistake, which can be explained. Alderman HuymPreERY.-But that leter is in Taylor's own writing, and he ,Aels May an out eA out villain for intercepting these goods. Jary.-l always undt rstood Mlyers was . man of sub. stanoe. MIr.

Mr. Bodkin here rose and said,-I appear, Sir, here to. day on behalf of Mr. Meeking. AldermanHumpIEBr (interrupting Mr. Bodldn).-There is no ch&rg against Mr. Heeking. Ir. Bodkin.-ButIappearhere, Sir, for the prpose_ Aldermau Humpn=EY.-Stop, stop, Hzr. Bodkin i X knowr what you are here for; but there is no charg agaist Mr. Meeking, and why therefore should you appear for him ? Mr. Bodkin.-Becawae a report has gone forth of what occurred here on Saturdday last, refleting upon Mr. Meeking, against whom for 35 years that he has beon in businew not the scimtia of a charge of this nature had erer been breathed. Yon may remember a case in which Mr. Edwin James appeared for parties placed in a similar position. Alderman HumpnERY.-I that cae it wa different. The parties Mr. Edwin James appeared for had been defrauded, although they were not the prosecators. MAr. Bodlin.-1 am quite ready to admit it isa quesion of discretion with the magistrate, bat when anything escapes calculted to prejud'ce the char,acter of a party not charged with any offence such a courtesy is never refused by a m agipstrat e. Realdierman Husrsn.-What does the report say?

(This announcemneat met with mach disapprobAtion from a crowded court.) Alderman HuECnxY.-Stop, Mr. Bodkin; yon have no right to charge other houses with offering their goods at 50 per cent. below their value. Mr. Bodki.-I have not, Sir; but I say that any man having dealings with respectable persons has a right to buy his goods as cheap as he can. Alderman HUxR]my.-Well, the only charge, aint Mr. Meeleg is that he bought these goods very cheaps Mr. Bo-"-All I can Say on behaf of Mr. Meshing is that he has carried on business for the last 35 years without the slghtest guestion of his integity. Alderman lUss1nxy -All can say is that 3M. Meek. ing bought these goods without a question. for. R-dklnL-aBt this report makes it appear that you said Mr. Meeking buys of any stranger. Alderman HUO3IPnRY.-Xo, it does not. MIr. Bodki-Mr. Meeking has a right to aU the advan. tages of fair competition, and to buy in the cheapest market. This is the account between Mr. Meehing and May, and I defy any one to find a seintilla of evidence againt Mr. Meeding. Aldermau HuPIXmY.-Thero is no charge againEt Mr. Meekin. All I mid was that he bought these goods oO per ent, below the cost price, after the 271 percent. allowed by Mr. Gorman had been deducted. Mr. Bodak--Mr. Meeking does not buy these goods him. self. He has a dozen buyers at least in his establishment. Alderman HUin'nxY.-Bat we all understand that. Mr. Mfeesing paid the check for these goods, and he would not have done so if the buyer had takenthem at 50 per cent. above the price, instead of below. (Great applause, which the officers found some difficulty in suppressmg.) Mr. Pontifex-But Mr. Meshing sold these very goods a9ainat a profit of only 71 per cent. Mr. Bodkin.-Well, if you say there is nothing against Mr. Meeling I am satisfied. Alderman HlmesPznY.-There is no charge againt him Mr. Bodldn (surprised).-At present (Laughter.) Alderman Hussrpnxs.-Of course. MAr. Bodkin.-M3r. Mcesing has given every information in this matter, and I am sure Mr. Morgan will say the same. usath Mr. Morgan.-That is perfectly trme, Sir. A Voice.-But not before 3r. Morgan went to him. I went to him, and showed him the written contract with May, but he would give me no assistance. Mr. Bodkin.-Let that person step forward. (Here several voices repeated the same complaint, and much hissing and confusion ensued.) Mr. Bodlkin.-This only shows the danger of ex parke statements being made in a person's absence. Great uproar here ensued, and the general disapprobation of every one in court was expressed by prolonged hissing, which the officers endeavoured, but in vain, to suppress. After the lapse of some muinutes, order having been restored, Mr. Mrtin said,-What toolk place on Saturday was not an ez parte statement ; it was a matter of evidence. Alderman HumrPmy.-I cannot hear any of thoso parties complaining, unless their statements are given on oath as evidence. A lad whose name our reporter was unable to cateh in the confuson that prevailed was then called, and aid.-I have been two months in Taylor's employ. On Saturday, the 25th of Mrch leas, about half past 1 o'cloek in the day, four cses of goods came from Mr. Gorman They were delivered by the railway carriers Taylor came in just as we got the last ce in. Hairby and Dolphin, a young man in May's employ, assisted me, and about 10 minutes after the goods came they wero unpacked. May came in, and afterwards sent Dolphin to help to unpack the good . May said he would also send a cort. May came almost every day to inquire if there were any letters from Mr. Gorman. The goods were removed from Taylor's about a quarter of an hour after they were unpacked, and we were about half an hour unpacking them. Taylor assisted. Taylor gave the goods to us off the counter to be put intoJohnson's cart, to take them to May's warehouse. Cross-examined by Mr. Wontner.-Taylor sent me to May to say that the goods had come, and to ask him if he wonld have them on that afternoon. May said he was to wait and receive them, and he called in Taylor while the goods were unpacking. Alderman HWLPHERY.-Do you know Myers? *Witne6s.-I have seen him at Taylor's, but not at May's. I have only seen him there twice; the first time Taylor was out, and the other time was on the Saturdy after that on which the goods arriyert. The evidence of the carmen, which was merely of a formal charcter, was taken, and James Dolphin ws then called, and raid,-I was traveller to MAY for about 10 months up to about the end of April last. For the first sx months he had his office at 1, Churchpamsage, on the second floor, and his private residence was at the same house with Taylor. On Saturda, the 28th of Marchlast, May sent me to Taylor's to help unpack the goods in question. May ordered a cart to remove thOe an- I helped to get them into May's warehouse in Huggin-lane. On the following7'Taesday (the 31st), or Wednesday, I helped to put them into the cart again to go to Mr. Meesing's; and May and Jary were present at the time. I know Myers, and saw him there frequently, but not while the goods were there. Myers came in onthe Wednes. day after the goods arrived; and I heard Xay tell him he was going to eend the handkerchiefs to Brighton and May informed me afterwards that he had told Myera so. Sume of the goods which had been left behind were at that time lYing on the counter. I never had the least idea that yers and May were partners. They used to do businesg, and were often at the desk together; but when they have oome in they always requested me to withdraw while they conversed together. Croe-examined by Mr. Huddleston.-May was agent for Turner and Co., of Redditch, needle manufacturers, for I used to travel for him as their agent. I sold only needles. Alderman Hu3RHERYs.-What houses did you sell at ? Mr. Huddleston.-The worthy alderman wishes to knopr if they were bondfide business slea you effected, or only a mere sham. (Laughter.) itneas.-They were genucine sales, and I was paid a salary of 1. Is. per weck,and acommision of 2^ per cent. Itnied somnernes,but ooald not sellthem;theprie was Mfr. Morga-I now propose to ealla gentleman from Mr. Mfeshn's establishment. Alde-rman HumPiRY.-I think yoU had better not, as Mr. Bodkin is not here now. MIr. Meeking has employed Mr. Bodkin to watch his interests here, and, as any one being called from his establishment will open a lArge question, sa I shall probably ask some quedions relating to other transactions wvhich it would be as welU 3r. Bodkin *hould hear, I think if you could call any other witness it would be more convenient to all prties. Mr. Morgan.-Very well, Sir. ButIshalleventuallyhave to call several persons from his establishment in another oswe againast Taylor and May. in which 4,000 dozen handklerchiefs havebeen obtained. (Sensation.) Alexander Timmins Hairby, at Mr. Huddleston's s gstion, was then calledand said,-I am asistant to Mx. Tayilor; I am not a clerk. Alderman Hua Erny.-Answer the question, Sir. Do not fenoe it in that way. Witnes -I am not a clerk. My position is that of as. sistant to Mr. Tsylor, and I am paid by a commission upon the returns of the business. I know both M aers and w I have see Myers nearly every day at May's Warehouse u to the 1st of January last, and I always believed Myers ang Mywrpartners, and MAY hasg told ins as much himself, butDnot ei yers's presence. May told me that in every iystanc in o which he could buy goods Myers found the monu and they divided the profits between them. With ~regard to this transaction, Mr. German received a letter of introduetion from Mr. Robertse a magistrate of Armagh, to Taylor, who was hbi agent; hut, instead of pretnmting it at first5 he went to A Mr. Faithful of Irvoymoinger.lane, who offered the goods at ayl the wholesle houses in the tmrde and then Mer.

T1HE IZNDIAN mAIIS TO THE EDITOR OF THE; TIME. Sir,,-The present being the second oocasion on which themails from India have arrived in succession within two,hours of those despatched for it, I onoe more beg to dral attention to a change I sggested through your colunmns. nearly two years ago, and by which a fortight will be saved on return of post by the community at each end orthe line. The arrangement, perfeetly possible in 1854, has now become imperativo; and existing arrangements, if not altered, will become absolutely absurd sx months henoe, when the' Egyptian Railway is opened all the way through from Alexandria to Suer, the 36 hours thus saved must be thrown away again in Egypt awaiting a seamer to carry the. mails on. At present the mails leave Bombay on the 3d and 17th of' each month, and quit London on the 10th and 26th, arriving. at the former place, on an average of 26 days, an the 4tUh and 20th, and at the latter on the 27th and 11th. When mail days occur on Sundays, as they have on the two past occasions done, letters from India are in England beforethose for the East have left. Even when this is not thecase, from 10 to 12 days are allowed at both ends for reply, when half the time wonld equally suffioe. Were letters to be despatched from both ends on the 1st and 12th they would reach on the 26th and 7th or 8th, leaving at each end three or four days for reply-quite as, much as is wantod. The railways both to Marseilles andi Trieste have been for two years in operation, so that we can look for little more than we at presont enjoy in the way of speed to Alexandria. The railway from this port to Caio has for a twelvemonth been in full operation, and theline, already halfway across the Desert, will be open to Suez ln. January, 1858. The reduction of the time of paenger transit from 16hours to 4 for the 86 mrUes will form but a small put of the saving. Though passengers travel eight nles an hour by van, the mal.soccupy 40 by cameL With the. railway they will all be conveyed together, and the 240 miles from Suez to Alexandria be traversed in 10 hours in place of 50, as now. But even as matters at present stand the transmission. from India is too swift for the aooommodation on the Mediterramean side. In the end of February the mails were detained three days in Egypt; they reached Suez at noon on the 16th; the Valetta, with the Marseilles portion of theoutgoing mail, did not reach Alexandria till noon on the- 19th; the Rlipon, with that by Southompton, not till thefollowing day. Aocidents of this sort are of constant occurrenoe. The Trieste steamer leaves Alexandria the moment the overland passengers arrive from Cairo; the Editor of l&c nimes and other active perons who reoeive letters by this route gain, when an accident arises or delay occurs, a couple of days even now on the public at large. Six months henco they wi gain two more, when all thetime saved in the transit from Suez mast be thrown away at Alexandria, awaiting the Mkse}lles steamer. The natural croesg plasce of the homeward and outwiardbound mails will then be advanocd from Egypt to alta, and wae ought to make our arrangements aocordingly. We mustk under the new order of things, in this case, either adopt the Trieete route at onoe, where the sea voyage is a half shorter than that by Marseils, or have a double line. of steamers from the last port eastward. These things ought to be meen to at one. At the ordinary rate of offlicial correspondenoe it is not at all too much toallow six months for negotiaftng a contract vith the Austrian Lloyds Steam Navigation Company, the various lines of railway between Calais and Trieste, or making an amendedutof arrangements iththePeningularandOrit Steam Navigation Company for a double Mfarseilles anc. Alexandria line of packets. Are there no means of getting rid of the absurdity introdnoed two yoers ago by my Lords of the Admiraltydetaining the mails for ten hours in Bombry harbour at starting? The Post-offoe close oand the packets re sent onboard at saunet; but the steamer is not allowed to start till next morning, for what reason no human being can divine. or 18 years the India navy packets always left after dk. and not a single accident ever befel them from 1839, whem they commenced, till 185, wohen they seased to cOrrY the. mails. As matters now and the packet captain, who might just as well have left after sunset, star betore dawn, and are in the open se before the faintest streak of day shbws the peaks of Mahableahwur, but even. ihen 10 hours haie been tkrown away. Were this addedi to the 40 hours that may be aved in Egypt, we may have. our mails both ways in 23 days without any extra steamr- eda were steam made to do its uttermost we might bavea =emn three weeks. - As I have spoken of things Ihavejua witnaied,.and ma witnewspin oa my return to Bombay two monthz henoe,, I givemy n me.
