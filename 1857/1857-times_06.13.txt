Several other roads have been sold at an equal rate of depreciation, showing very clearly what those are worth that are not actually up for sale.

STATE OF TRADE. MAINCHESTER, JuiNm 12. The advance in the price of cotton at Liverpool this week, which s reported at id. per lb. on Upland and half that anmount on Mobile, continues to b1T a lite more business into the cloth-market, as it did on Tusd ~, and contracts have been obtained at a small advance, ut the advanoc does noit in any case cover the increased cost of the raw material. For 40-inch shirtings for India the advance is 3 id. per piece, and Madapollams are selling at ld. per piece and 3aconets at Ad. to Id. the piece of 20 yards higher. In some descripions of these goods a Iarge business has been effected during the week for India and China, In printing cloths and 36-inch shirtiogs there has been no in. pveent. T-cloths and some weights of longcloths, brthv36-inch and 40-inch, have been more inquired for, and to some extent stocks have been reduced, but the advance in price is smaU and the trade in an unsatisfactory positton. The improved demand for yarn neticed on Tuesday continues, but it is mostly confined to numbers and qualities suited to the India, China, and German markets, atId and in some cases a rather greater, advance per lb. £he commoner qualities of 30's and 40's mule for India are fully id. per lb. dearer. The increased business has given a firmer feeling to the market generally, but home trade yarns are comparatively the most diffi. cult to selL This is mostly owing to the reduced consumption of nanufacturers, 'who have reduced their hours of working to 40 per week, and through the total stoppage of machinery in other cases. The short time committee continue their exertions to bring about a general resort to 40 hours per week, and the manufacturers of Raw. tenstall have been added to the number who have resolved to join the movement. It is generally felt that this course in the present unsatisfactory state of prices, and with the suflicient supply of cotton, is producing most salutary eslts, and the progress made so far has been very satisfac*ory to those who have engaged in it. A small failure was nnounced on Tuesday, and another is mentioned thismorn. ing. Both concerns are engaged in calico printing, and the liabilities of the two will probably be under 20,000. A larger failure in the cotton trade, reported to have taken place at Blackburn, was contradicted to-day.

THE LATE LAGISLATUBW OF FRANCE. - ----- The Monilur of yesterday pxblishee tho following article:- "At the opening of last see8ion the Legislative Body which has just terminated it labours received the thanks of the Emperor; it also deserves those of Franoe. That body, in fact, responded in every rospect to all that Frnce and the Emperor expeced from its enlightened views and from Its patriotism. leoted at the close of a period when the sbuse of speech and the omnipotema% of aemblies had led societ to the brink of a precipioe, the Iegislative Body perfectly understood the conditions of its new tsk, and I wisely kept withim it; the faithful representative of the people which had. appointed it, not to obstruct, but to hdlp the saviour of France in the accomplishment of his providential task, it resolutely asociate itself to all measues of a nature to conaolidate order, to re-establish the prosperity and the glory of the country. Thanks to its excellent spirit, as also to that of the two other bodies of the State, the experiment of the new oonstitution was decisive, and the results obtained no longer admit of any doubt that it is the trae national coastitution for France. "NO Legislature ever had a hand in realizing such great things or in performing such uetful services. The reurection of the Empire, the war in the East, the restoration of general peace, and of the prestige of the French name, all those memorable facts in which the Legislative Body participated, and of which one alone would suffice to aSsign it a bright page in hitory, mut not cast into shade the many important enactments which re the result of its deliberations. Within a period of five years, and with sessions of three or four months' duration, the late Legislature has done more than our former Ammblies Would have done in 10 years of endless sessiona. The number of Bills which it has ex amined, discused, and voted amounts to no lees than 979, of which number 240 are of general interest, and 739 belong to the local or deparimental interest. "The object of many of the latter was to effect loans for great works in the towns or in the provinces. Paris is not alone in constracting new streets and new baildings; the provinces follow her example and many of our ancient cities are undergoing improvemenk but prudence bids the Legislative Body and the Government pause upon an outlay not without its daners. While givingitsconsent to asefcl expenses the LegisltiveBody knew howto restrain needless, outlys, and was not spareing of warnings for the future. " In the Bills of general intereat every branch of the Government has taken part. " The Department of Justice has undergone essential reforms. " As regards the Home-offioe, the Legislative Body has warmly supported the generous measurs taken by the Government of the Emperor in the years of famine, epidemic, and inundations to help the unfortunate, to give work to the poor, to increase the funds of the hospitals and charitable institutions. " But the most importnt Bill passed in the internal administrtion is that for the regulation of the municiphlity,which,while it leaves to theinhabitantsof the district the right of electing their councillors, allows the Government to select for Mayor the man most capable of rising above local passions and of watching over tho interests of all. "Gret public works have hada large share in the Bills voted by this Legisature. If the execution of our first lines of railway is due to the head of the State and to preceding Governments, the chief ramifications of our great national network were only rendered possible by subventions granted bY the I slative Body. The list is a long one; itcom. prizes the lines from Paris to Cherbourg, from Bordeaux to Cette, the junction under one company of the line from Lyons to Avignon and from Avignon to Marseilles, the line from Bordexaux to Bayonne, from Narbonne to Perpignan, from Lyons to Geneva, with a branch on Bourg and [Macon, from St. Plmbert to Grenoble, from Grenoble to Valence, from the Rhone to the Lcire-in fact, all the lines which form the Grand CentrsL the Pyrennean railways, and the junction of the Western Railway." The M.anitcur then praies the Corps I4gisatif for the improvement of the canals, for the drainage and fertilizing of waste lands in Gascony, and for the purchase of the Palace of Industry, finally the Drainage Bill, which places 100,000,OOuf. at the disposal of agriculture. The Mlonieur then praises the Legialative Body for what it has done for the fine arts by granting money for the Rue de Rivoli and the Boulevard de Sebastopol, by exempting from taxes for 30 years the houses around the Louvre, by voting money " for that incomparable structure," and for the improvement;s in the Bois de Boulogne. "The Leisdativo Body (itsays) has powerfully contributed to these wonders, which arethe glory of tho presenr reign, the admiration and the envy of strangers." Tfhe Moniteur then enters into a description of the improvements at Lyons, Marseilles, Havre, Rouen,Mifontpellier, and other cities, and of the reforms introduced into public instruction throughoutFrance. Touching upon the Financial Department, it says,- "The laws of finance have played a great part in the legisative period which has just terminated. " Despite the expenses of one of the greatest and most glorious wars ever known, despite the scourges which have desolated France, the Government of the Emperor has re. solutely followe d, supported by the legislative Body, the task which he from the very first imposed upon himself of making the balance of the budget a real one, without imposing additionaltaxes; andon the very morrowafte the war he presented a budget for the consideration of the great bodies of the State in which the anticipated receipts balance tho expenses." After enumerating various measures of local interest, such as a reform of the internal postage system, &c., the Mnifteur says:- "But the most important financial measure in which the Legislative body took part is incontestably that of the national loans. By giving them for the first time a de mocratic character, by caling upon the whole nation to subscribe to them, theEmperor has done for the 'RenWte what '89 did for the earth; henceforth the cultivator of the soil and the workman are no less interested than the capitalist in the stability of credit; henceforth all classes participate in all advantages as in all charges upon the country. The Legislative body understood the bearing of that great measure and heartily joined in it. The result is known in the management of the war and in the prestige of France abroad. The eagerness with which the loans were subscribed to even in the remotest hamlets produced no lesser effect than did the heroism of our soldiers under the walls of Sebastopol, and Europe beheld with equal astonish. ment the extent of our financial resources and thepower of our arms. " The army, which has done so much for the glory of France and for the peace of the world, could not fail to be the object of the special interest of the Emperor and of the Deputies of the country. "Without speaking of the considerable sums devoted each year in the Budget to keep up and increase our land and sea forces, the Legislative body had to vote a series of measures for improving the condition of our sailors and toldiers." The Monitefur here enumerates the various local measures adopted for the above purpose. It ,concludes as follows "This rapid glance on the labours of the late Legislature will suffice to Ehow its claim to the gratitude of the country. While making less noise than so many other deliberative assemblies, it has all the better answered its calling, and taken a greater share in all the good that has been done during that memorable period. Deprived of the dangerous privilege of making andl unmaklg Ministries, of obstructing the march of Government, of transforming the Tribune into a pedestal for ambition or vanity, tho Legislative body was enabled to deliberate on the Bills before it without the stir of political passions, in the most perfect independenoe of the Government as of faction. " While losing the right of proposing, in the midst of debates, amendments which often spoil the whole tenour of a Bill the Legislative body has not the less that of rejecting or modifying such measures as it does not aDprove. Never was the right of amendment exercised in a more ample or efficacious manner-never were Bills more carefully examined-never were contradictory opinions maintained with greater freedom or talent. " If the Council of State did not admit all the modifications proposed by the Iegislative body, if most of the dis. cusslons between those two bodies terminated in a mutual undersanding, the cause must bo sought for in, the wisdom with which the Bills were prepared before being submitted to the Iegislative body, and in that spirit of conciliation, that love for the publio welfare, with which all the great bodies of the State are wimated. " Each of those bodies may claim a share in the good whichhas been done. All of them have understood and ably fulfilled the high mission which they hold from the constitution and from the confidence placed in them by the Emapezor. " During six years of incessant labour the Couneil of State has had not only to prepare all the Bill, all the Budgets, and to support them before the LegIative body and the Senate, but lso to deliberate upon all meaures of publie utility, to decide all appeals all oontests respecting the different branches of theAdministration. To fulfil this xumense task it was necessary, with the superior inteligenee, the talent of speech,- the indefatigable activity and tat which distinguih the President of the Council of 34t%, Io hare the o-operation that a _emb of ite ;aent and dovotior, which mke that body 44e WcAy on. tinuaOon of the traditou of the Councl of BMateoOf the ThatEmpfre.

THBE HANDBL FESTIVAJL It night the entire choral force, metropolitan jad pio. vincial, assembled in Exeter-hall to reheamse the prinipal choruses from the three oratoriog (T2k Mesfsa, Jv&s -Macab=4 asnd a in Eyp9t) rected for performanoe at the great Handel oommemoration which begins oZL Monday morning at the Crstal Pale, Sydenham The choral deputatioms from the country wrived in london in the coors of the afternoon. The Yorkshire ditrict-under the superintendence of Mr. Samuel Smith, the active and zealous meanar of the Bradford Festivalssent 200 picked voice.; Birmingham and its vicinity furnshed no legs thn 250, which ad beeZL selected by Mr. Oliver Mason, eqully known as one of the principal officers and patrons of the grand triennia meeting which has rendered Birmingham famous among the musical towns of England; 50 came from Liverpool, mrshalled. by Mr. Henry Sudlow, sreta of theo Liverpool Philharmonic Society; 50from Dublin and other parts of Ireland, selected by Mr. George G(ray; wbile Norwich, Woroester, Iereford, and Gloceeterechhprovided a oompetent band of sing for whose efficiency the regpec. tive musical authorities at the festivals which take pAce every three years In those cities (M r M III chorus. maser, Dove, Townsand Smith, and Amott, organis), were answerable. Canterbury, Ely, Exeter, Wells, Bristol, Lincoln, DurhAm, Winchester, and other cathedral towns together with Oxford and Cambridge, each furnisied its contingent; and to these must be added the gentlmen and boys from St. Georgges Chapel, Windsor, together With some Of the most practised members of the Chapel Boyal and the metropolita choirs. Of the 1,100 London choristezr we have already spoken; and the effect produoed lIt night, with such numerous and powerful reinforcement, may be readily imagined. In all about 2,000 ehoral singers, men and women, wrer Oongregated last night in Exeter-hall, for the purpose, of rehearsing under the direction of Mr. Cot. Such a chorl force ws never before assmbled in England; and the result of their united efforts ws unprecedented. We may confidently assert that nothing on the oontinent (with all its affectedanperiority) everapproachedit. The flatiloorof the hall presented difficulties fortheaccommodtion of soTat a body of singers not easy to surmount. They were nevertheless surmounted by the indefLtigaole Mr. Bowley anh bis istant, who have laboured night and day for the lst twa months or more to cary out triumphantly the idea of the Handel commemoration. The bes practicable plan was adopted. The singers were arranged in double choir, as they will be on the Israci in Egypt day at the Crystal Palace, when the most astounding effect is anticipated from the splendid double choruses in which that masterpioco abounds. The trebles were stationed in the ordinary orchestra; the altos occupied the level space on the floor between the north and south galleries; the tenors commenced at the raised seats; and the basses were situated in the west gallery and the space uerneath it. Mr. Cost, the conductor, stood on a raisedplatform, about the centre of the hil, where he could be visible, in a greater or less degree, to al the singers. The only instrunents employed to sustain the chorus were the organ (Mr. Brown. smith, organist), the gigantic bass-drum, manufactured by Mr. Distin for the Sacred Harmonic Society (which was in front of the orchestra), a pair of kettle-drams, anld four serpents, in the middle of the hall. We shall not anticipate the description it wl be onr task to attempt of the performances at the Crystal Palace by entering into any detailed account of this extraordinary pre. hminay. Suffice it that the effect produced was unexampled, and that Mr. Costa, who exerted bimself with a zeal and ability worthy of all praise, had very little difficulty in making the 2,000 accomplished choral singers, who fol. !Owed the indications of his conductor's stick, understnd his Intentions and carry them out. It was not a master drilling pupils, bnt a chief appointed by a multitude of other chiefs to lead them on to conquest. Not to enter Into particulus, we may mention the " Hallelujah " (UeujaW) and "Fallen is the foe" (Jruda Maccabcus) as specimens of choral execution we have never heard equalled. The wbole experiment was most gratifying, and if nothing more is accomplished at the Crystal Palace the vast audience will derive ample satisfaction and delight, while the genins of Handel will be worthily apostrophized. A small space in the west gallery, situated between the departments allotted to the first and scond basses, was occun pied by a number of distinguished persons who had been invied to attend the rehearsal by the committee of the Sacred Harmonic Society. Thenorth gallery ws io filld, by vWisitors of note.
BOYAL SURREY GAtRDENS. The first concert of the ten days'festval announced by M. Jullien, under the title of " Grand Musical Congress," took plae last night in the Music-hall of the Surrey Gardens, where thousands of persons assembled to listen to the oratorio of The Creation. Such a sight could not be other. wise than gratifying to all who hold music in esteem as a. means of civiliration and refinemrnt. The strict attention paid to the performance-the applause, bestoowed enthuaiastically, and yet with discriition-thestearyadherenoe of nearly the whole of the audience to their seats until the last note of Haydn's great sacred composition had been beard-these and other incidents of tho evening tended to show how rapidly the love of music, and of healthy music, is growing among us, with all classes, from the highest to the lowest. The execution was immensely creditable to M. Jullien and the vast company of vocal and instrumental artists underhis controL The choruseawere admirably given; and rarely have thoseclear, simple, andat thesame time majestic inspirations-" The Heavens are telling," " Achieved is the glorious work," and " Sing the Lord I ye voices all"-been rendered with greater precision, spirit, and accuracy, or more thoroughly appreciated. The principal singers were Madame Rudersdorff and Mrs. Neiss (soranos), the former of whom sang "With verdureclad," the latter "On mighty pens," with equal success; Mr.Weis& who gavethe whole of the bass music with his aocustomed talent; and tr. Sims Reeves, whose masterly and highly expressive singing in the famous air, "In native worth," brought down such peals of applause as made the walls of the building almost tremble with reverberation. Mr. Sims Reeves isone of the few artists who lose no opportunity of manifesting their disinclination to accept "encores;" but to resist such an uproarious and unanimous comumand as this would have boen both indiscreet and uncourteous; and so the air was repeated to the increased delight of the maultitude. The second tenor part was well and carefully sustained by Mr. G. Perren. Theband was admirable. h. Jullien was honoured at the termination of the performance by a flattering testimon of a oval, and never Xt.ter deserved the om,Dliment. It is both singular and gratifying to find one n his position so indefatigable a labourer in the good cause. The second night of the festival (to.night) will comprise a grand selection from the works of Beethoven. The weather is happily favourable to th' tundertaking, and everything augurs a prosperous result.
TE LATnE M1, DouGLAs JxnoLD.-The funeral of the late Douglas Jerrold will take pLice on Monday nex;, the 15&h inst., at Norwood Cemetery. It will, we under. stand, be strictlyprivate. The friends will meet at the cemetery at half-past 1. TEIE SPARKEIc's WFuT nx 1 WPsr.-A e earing on the pending Mayo election came this week before the Ballinrobe petty sessions. The facts are these:Pat Ward was charged with wilfully assaulting James Moran on Monday, the 1st inst., and takin froni his pocket the writ of the Speaer of the House of Commons, summoning him to give testimony in the case of the Mayo petition. Mr. John Grifl;n appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Blake for the defenoe. The indictment set forth that complant was proceeding to his home from the town of Ballinrobe on Monday, the 1st inst., and was stopped at the bridge leading out of the town by defendant and tome other person unknown; defendantasked him if he -asa the man who was going to swear against Father Convay. Complainant answered, No. Defeadant again asked him if he had the summons in his pocket, and on his replying mn tbe negative he was knoocrd down, and from his ;ocket was forcibly abstracted the writ of the Speaker of the House of Commons, which be saw in the defendant's hand for the last time, and which he has not reoovered since the occasion. The bench unanimously decided that, as the case was one of the greatest importance, no means should be spared to have it properly investigated and the guiltyparties severely punishbe. It has been clearly proved that Ward was present and had poassion of the paper or which the plaintiffdeclared he was deprived. On the whole, they consideredit a cae demanding the attention of the law offoers of the Ciown, and they would send it to the aies. DefendanVs attorney applied to have it snt to the Quarter Sessions, which would take place before the sizes, but the bench unanimously refused to eomply. The defendant wAa then required to procure bail tothe amount of 1001., himse in 0L and two sureties of 2. each. Mr. Blake complained of the excesive amount of bail required, but the magistrites refued toleaen the amount, and intimated that they woul commit the defendant in default thereof. Great interest was taken in the cme, in consequence of its bearing on the Mayo petition.
PARLIXENTARY NTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDSo FnDAY, JTvn 12. The LorD CHAOEMLTOI took his Feat on the woolsack-at -dclock. Lord BROUGHAM prGrnntod a petition in favour of an improved system for the convoyance of real property. The Duke of NEWCASTLE preented a petition from i chymists and druggists against the S-le of Poisons BilL . Lord REDESDALE presented a petition for the better regulation of beerhouses. HER MAJESTY'S DRAWINGROOMS. In reply to a questlon from Lord RAVa?NSwORTH, Earl GRANVILLE said, that the hon. baronet the President of the Board of Works had given directions for the preparation of a plan for inoreasing the accommodation at St. James's Palace on the occasion of Her Majesty's Draw. ingroam&, TaE PRINCESS ROYAL'S ANINUITY BILL. This Bil passed through committee. THE IRISH GOVERNMENT. The Earl of LEITRIM asked the Government why the protection of the Dolice was to be removed from David Stuart in the county of Leitrim, and why the Government should require him to emigrate or otherwise provide for his personal safety, and to what extent the persecution of Protestants was to be permitted ? The noble earl suggested that the police had been withdrhwn from watching this gentleman's house because he had given a vote adverse to the candidate of the Irish Government in the late election; and expressed his opinion that no Lord-Lieutenant had ever taken so strong a part in politics as the Earl of Carlisle. Earl GRANVILLE said, the best answer to the oharge of partisanship against the Lord-Lieutenant was the universal respect in which thc noble earl was held by all political parties in Ireland. (Hear, hear.) As to the particular case in question, he was not sware that any protection had been vithdrawvn:from Mr. Stuart's house. It appeared that that gentleman had made himself obnoxious to his neighbours in some way or other, and at his own request two police-constables were appointed to watch his house. Subsequently he gave notice of his intention to enigrate, andrequested that the policemen mig.ht be withdrawn. He changed his mind however, and did not emigrate, and the police-constables were kept on duty there at a considerable expense to the country. Lord DUNGANNON believed, that had an attack been made on any body of Roman Catholics in Ireland the country would have been roused from one end to the other, and no effort would have been spared by the Government to bring the guilty parties to punishment. Bat such was not the case when Protestants were attacked, though it was notorious that such attacks took place daily. He could oint to cases where Protestant ladies in Dublin were ooted and pelted on their way to visit schools, and where the Poman Catholic police not only gave them no assitane but cheered on the assailants. The Roman Catholics of Ireland seemed alone to be regarded as valuable subjects, while everything like honesty of purpose, ability, and talent was denied to the Protestant population. (Hear, hear.) His noble friend had asked how long this state of things was to go on, and he thouht he was entitled to a fair and satisfactory answer. He felt assured that, sooner or later, the indignation of the Protestants of Ireland would compel the Government to give due attention to the grievances under which they laboured. (Hear, hear.) Same of the scenes that had taken place of late were absolutely disgracefuL. (Hear, hear,)HBe contended that Roman CSatholics and Protestants ought to share alike the favours of the Government. The Protestants were not the most numerous body in Ireland, but they comprised to a great extent the intellect and usefulness of the country, and they had a right to claim protection. Their lordships might depend upon it that the case referred to by his noble friend (the Earl of Leitrim) was but one of many which indicated a state of circumstances calling loudly for the interference of Parliament. Earl GRANVILLE said, the noble earl at the head of the Government in Ireland conducted his administration on the princlple of perfect fairness and equality towards aL classes of Her Majesty's subjects in that country. (Hear.) If the noble lord opposite could bring against the Government a particular charge of partiality either one way or other, he would have no objection to such case or cases being submitted to a committee in order to their being considered on their merits. Charges had been made against the Lord-Lieutenant of having acted unfairly towards Roman Catholics; charges had also been made against him of having acted unfairly to Protestants, and such recrimination would always take place when beUigerent denominations were pitted against each other. (Hear.) He entirely denied that the Government had pressed the man to whom the noble earl had referred to emigrate. Indeed, nobody could believe that the Government had had recourse to any such policy. Two policemen were at this moment in his house at considerable expense to the public, and in such circumstances it was idle to say that the Government was not giving protection to Protestants. (Hear,) The Earl of LEITRIM said, if the noble'earl would give him a committee, he would show the House and the country how sixpenny penalties were imposed by the magistrates. (Hear, hear.) In Kilkenny- Earl GRANVILLE rose to order.-It would be very inconvenient to go on with this discussion in the way the noble earl was now doing. If the noble earl chose to give notice of a motion for referring to a select committee any particular cases, the House, when that motion came befome them, would be able to judge whether sufficient grounds were made out for such a committee (hear, hear), but he thought it was trifling with the time of their lordships to discuss such potty charges as had been made in a way so irregular. (Hlear, hear.) The Earl of LEITRIM (amid cries of " Order !") said, al he wished to say was that the answer given by the noble earl to his question vas most unsatisfactory and most incorrect. (Hear.) TRANSPORTATION BILL. The Earl of HARROWYBY roseto move that the House go into committee on the Transportation and Penal Servitude BilL Their lordships would recollect that considerable Interest had been felt throughout the country on the subjeom of transportation and what was called the ticket-of-leave system, and that no small excitement and perhaps prejudicexisted in the community with regard to the number of persons convicted of offences who were supposed to be at large in possession of those tickets-of-leave. The real ground of apprehension was not theexistence of the ticket-of-leove system as such, but the cessation of the system of trans. portation, by which, instead of sending annually great numbers of the worst criminals to different portions of our colonial empire, we were obliged to retain them at home No doubt it was a very simple process to shuffle off our crlminal population to the colonies, and for a while it seemed to work well; hut in course of time it became an evil which the colonists were unable to bear, and they became so excited on the subject as to render transportation in a great measure impossible. (Hear, hear.) The committee which sat last year expressed its approbation of transportation if it could be carried out with the consent of the colonies, but they also laid down as principles to guide the selection of colonies whither convicts should be sent. that there should be a demand for their labour, and a sufficient amount of free [population to prevent inequality of the sexes, and too great a proportion of criminal inhabitants. Those principles excluded nearly every colony in Australia, and convicts could not be transported to the Cape of Good Hope, to Moreton Bay, to the Red River settlement, nor to the Falkland Islands. With respect to Vancouver's Island the committee had not sufficient information to enable theni to pronounce a definite opinion, and further inquiry had not convinced the Government that convicts could be sent there. The obstacles were-first, ths reat distance; and next, the contiguity of the American territories. Under these circumstances the only place which the committee could point out as fitted at present for the reception of convicts was Western Australia; but, even in regard to that colony, he (theEarl ofHarrowby)could nothold out the hopethat that resouree would beavailable for anyvery extended period. The free population was only about 7,000, and there were few very strong inducements for any rapid increase in that population. However, that colony was desirous of having convicts sent to them, and the Government would endeavour by al means in its power to comply with that wish in the manner most advantageous to this country and to the colonists. During the inquiries of the committee one obstacle to carrying out any system o; transportation even to colonies desirous of receiving convicts vas ascertained which it was in the power of the Legislature to remove. It would be remembered that when in 1853 it became obvious that a limit must be placed upon the number of convicts to be transported, the principle was laid down that only persons sentenced for periods of 14 years and upwards sbould be transported. By that measure it was intended that transportation should be carried out only in the cases of the worst kind of offenders; but it was not quite clear that criminals regarded transportation to a foreign country as a more severe punianment than confinement at honme. -The number of convicts annually sentenced to those longer periods of l unishmentaveraged400, fromwhichwomenandpersonsphysically or otherwise unfit for transportation being deducted, tberewere left only about 250 convictsvhocould besentaway every year to Western Australia. In order to enable the Government to meet the wishes of the colonists, and to remove from this country a number of persons whose reformation was more probable in a distant island than at homne the Bill which he now proposed had been prepared. Its object was, whenever a sentence of penal servitude was pronounced, it should be in the discretion of the Secretary of State to decide, according to the demands of the colonies and the fitness of the convicts for transportation, whether the sentenes should be carried out at home or abroad. An objection had been raised against that proposition, upon the ground of the uncertainty it would create as to the effeot of the sentence, bat t'ie same objection would apply to the present system. No judge could say when he was passing sentence of transportation whether it would be carried into effect or not. Of 12,621 persons sentenced to transportation in the years immediately preceding the introduction of the new system only 4,710 were actually sent out of the country. In the 10 years from 1842 to 1852, taking England, Wales, and Scotland together, 36 per cent. of al the persons sentenced to transportation were kept at home. Under these eircumnstances a discretion must be left somewhere, and he did not know to whom it could be given if not to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who was responsible to Parliament and the public for all his acts. The Bill, besides giving that discretion to the Home Secretary, nominally abolished the sentence of transportation, which had become a perfect mockery, but under the sentence of penal servitude power was taken to send out of the country a lxuga mmber of convicts than it Jiad recently been pos- eible to dispose of in our colonies. He would not trouble the House with many observations upon the ticket-of-leave system. The apprehensions upon thatscore had very muah subsided; and when their lordships bore in mind that up to the present moment onily about 15 per cent, of the ticketof-leave men had been recommitted' they would see that the system hsd incurred a good deal of ndeserved odinm and that the Qovernment would not have been justified in propos,ngto abolish it. The noble earl concluded by asking their lordship8 to go into committee on the Bill. L,ord CAMPBE1LL did not rise to oppose the motion for going into committee, bat to express has deep disappoint. ment at the provisions of the Bill. Both Parliament and the country had expressed a deCided opinion in favoar oC transportation, and he certainly did expect that the Government would make some attempt to comply with the wishes of those who had studied the subject and were competen: to give advice upon it. He now saw, however, thas transportation was to be permanently abandoned, or rather instead of being a punishment for the worst oftenders, it was to be a reward for the most meritorious. (Hear, hear.) A new order of merit was to be established, and the tokea was to be a ticket of transportation. (Hear, hear.) Ha viewed with alarm the situation in which the Country had now the prospeot of being placed. It was a new situation. Before the time of Henry VIII offenders were dealt with in an extremely summary manner, and there were no accumulations of convicts. Ths system of transportation was coeval with the settlement of America Our convicts were sent thither until the declaration of independence. After that came the Australian colonies, and they until very receatly received aniually a considerable portion of our worst criminals. Now, however, our convicts were to ba accumulated at home from year to year, and there was no prospect of their being placed in a situation where they would be prevented from recurring to their criminal praotices, or where the publio would be saved from their depredations and acts of violence. Such a result might be necessary, but it was most deplorable. (Hear, hear.) Our penal colonies had been the envy of all those foreigners who had considered the subject of secondary punishments, and he deeply regretted that, like France and other con. tirental States, we were no longer to have the means of giving our convicts a chance of reformation or of relieving the public from a repetition of their crimes. There were no doubt some difficulties to be encountered; bat an attempt ought to have been made to overcome them, and it was wrong at once to abandon transportation. (Hear, hear.) That whichl was formerly a punishment was now to be a reward for good conduct. There was to be a selection of those who were most inno. cent and tolwhom4the least objection would be made in the colonies, and they were to be rewarded by being sentenced to transportation, carrying their wives and families with them. They were to be favoured emigrants, and sent -abroad at the public expense. (Hear, hear.) Formerly, when he passed a sentence of transportation for 15 years or for life, he thought it nould be carried into effect. The convict, the convicts family, the bystanders, and the judge believed it. But now all that they knew was that it would not be carried into effect unless the convict earned the reward of transportation by extraordinary good conduct. It w7as contrary to the first principles of crinmina.ljurispru. deuce to substitute the discretion of the Secretary of State, wiho knew nothing of the circumstances attendant upon the commission of the crime, for that of the judge by whom the prisoner was tried. (Hear, hear.) In future, if he were to tell the truth, he would have to sentence the convict for 15 years to the disoretion of the Secretary of State. (A laugh.) Hewould have to say, "During that term the Secretary of State for the time being may allow you to remain in prison, or you may be sent to the public works at Bermuda; or, if you show repentance, you may have the good fortune to be transported to Western Australia." Su-h a syrstem aggra. vated all the evils which had been deplored, and held out no prospect of any equivalent *dvantage. (Hear.) EBarl GREY had heard with the greatest sorrow the speech of his noble and learned friend, because it showed that his noble and learned friend had entirely forgotten the arrangements of 1847 and 1848, and now condemned a system to which he waa not only an assenting party bat the chief adviser upon whose authority it was established. The obiect of this Bill was to enable the Government to revert to that system. (Hear, hear.) Previous to the establishment of that system it had been found from experienoe that tha striotly penal part of the sentence of transportation could be much better carried into effect at home than abroad. The sentenoe of transportation implied two things-removal from the country and forced labour inthe custody of Government officers. Long experience had showu that the effective part of the punishment, foroed labour, oould only be safely and properly applied at home. When it was attempted to apply It at a distance abuses had invariably been developed. In Norfolk Island, in Van Diemen's Land, in New South Wales,-in every instance where convicts had been subjected to severe penal labour out of sight of the home Government, and removed from the influence which secured trust. worty officers, the system had failed. But although the colonies had not answered for carrying into effect the strictly penal part of the sentence they had answered the purpose of disposing of convicts when they could longer be kept under severe punishment. Common humanity rendered it impossible that even the worst of. fenders could be kept under punishment for life. Every attempt of that kind practically failed. Sooner or later they must be relieved from punishment. But when that was done in this country, in spite of the utmost care it was almost impossible to prevent convicts from returning to a course of crime. In this country they had the disadvantage of meeting their own associates, added to the difficulty of obtaining profitable employment. But in tho colonies it was not so, and the consequence was that when they passed out of the hands of the Government a large majority became useful members of society. The system, therefore, which was established in 1847 and 1848 was this :-that every convict Upon whom sentence of transportation was passed went, in the first instance, to solitary or separate imprison. ment at Pontonville, or an establishment of that kind; thence, after a longer or shorter term, according to his conduct and original sentence, he went to a penal establishment like that at Portland, and thence, according as his conduct was better or worse, he was sent at an earlier or later period t one of the colonies. By that system they obtained two advantages. The strictly penal part of the sentence was inflicted in this country, where, if abuse sprung up, they were at once checked and a discipline was applied which fitted the man to be useful in the colony to which he was ultimately sent. But the greatest advantage of all was, that the system gave a motive to the convict to conduct himself welL (Hear, hear.) Captain Maconochie, a gentleman of Freat benevolence an ability, projected the plan of makmng punishment to cease when the convict by industry and good conduct had earned a certain number of marks. He thought Captain Maconochie had attempted to carry the principle too far, although undoubtedly it was a sound principle, becAuse prior to that the only mode of compelling convictsto behave well was to punish them. It was mere coercion. The lash was the only thing upon which they depended for enforcing industry and preventing misconduct. The lash was an instrument of which the power was speedily lost. The men became hardened, and it was impossible to preveat the most horrible state of things provailing in convict establishments. But the moment they changed the pnla and, retaining severity and strict punishment for thoso who deserved them held out the prospect of earlier relief, they brought into play the strongest motive which could act upon the human mind. The system had been successful, and at Dartmoor and Portland the work per. formed under such a stimulus by convict labour, even compared with free labour, had been in the highest degree satisfactory. Records showed that the convicts were industrious, and he was persuaded where there was real industry there could be no great misconduct. Wheo men had been made really industrious and maintained the outward decencies of good oonduct, if nothing more, he was persuaded a great deal had been done towards romoting their real improvement. He knew that the plan of giving rewards to convicts for good conduct had been held up as highly objectionable. It was said that it encouraged hypocrisy, and that the worst men very often behaved best in a penal establishment. He was well aware of that, and he was afraid that, do what they would, where the heart was corrupted it was only in a few instances, and that under the Divine influence rather than by any other means. that it was thoroughly reclaimed. (Hear, hear.l) But he said, where they could not change the heart they did a great deal if they could teach habits of industry, and prevent those outrageous breaches of all decorum which used to prevail under former systems of punishment. At length a strong feeling sprang up in Van Diemen!s Land against transportation to that colony. In 1852 it was believed to be impossible to continue to apply that system, and the eiovernaent of the day came to the conclusion that it was necessary to close the colony of Van Diemen's Land against the reception of convicts sentenced to transportation. When that was the case it wac obvious that some change of the systems must be adopted, and in 1853 a Bill was brought in for substituting penal servitude for transportation. He thought at the time that that was a very ill-advised measure, and he then objected to it. What did the Legislature then do ? They made three or four years of penal servitude equivalent to seven years' transportation (hear, hear); and what was the consequence? Why, that they were compelled to discontinue the practice of making the good conduct of a man under confinement contribute to the abridgment of his sentence. That pro vision entirely crippled the whole system of penal discipline which the Legislature had, after great care and labour, brought to a considerable state of Perfection. But, more than that, they said no convict should be sent abroad unless sentenced to transportation for 14 years, and that had the effect of limitingthe number that could be sent abroad. It should be borne in mind that the colonies were not the proper places to which the incorrigible class of convicts should be sent. If they aoted on any other rule than that they would not be able to continue the system of transporta. tion at alL For the incorrigible there onght to be places properly selected within the British islands, and there Ithey ougbt to be retained permanently under the Govern- jment surveillance. Those should be places where persons utterly incorrigible should be separated from society and prevented doing the mischief which they would otherwise occasion. The persons that oughtto be sent to the colonies, and whom the colonies would be ready to receive for the sake of their labour, were those who lbad been betraved into crime, who were not thoroughly hardened, who had gone through a course of discipline such as he had described, and who on being placed in circumstances favourable to their moral improvement would he in a position to retrieve a lost character. (Hear, hear.) Of those persons a very large proportiona used to be sentenced to seven years' transporta- tion, but that class of men were entirely excluded from tbe advantages of being sent to a colony by the measure of 1853. And now, what was the measure before the House ? It simply enabled the Legislature to retrace its steps, and it gave back to the Government that discretionary power over conviets whih troix the time that transportation ws ii- troduced they bad always possessed, and which they ought by right to exercise. If their lodp would look backo the o d acts of George TILL nd Georgo IV,twudb foun that, theycl earronprovided that persos sentenced to trans' Portation miight bePuniso either in a colony abrod or inx the hulka at horae. He supported the BiM on the simple ground that it %as a retracing, as far as their lordahip could, the erroneous step which they took in 1852 and 185i!,a and enabled the Government inL future to mnake use of transporttlon to as great an extent as was practicable to relieve this country from the presence of a class of persons who had become dangerous to the peable and well-disposed part of the community. The Earl of CARNARVON wished to trouble their lordships with a few remarks, because his noble friend who had introduced this BIll seemed to assume that the revival of transportation upon a large scale was altogether impracticoble. He agreed with the noble earl that the real difficulty was not in finding a place where convicts might be weourely confined, but a country possessing a fertile soil and natural resources, which would afford an almostinoehauAtible demand for labour. He (the Earl of Carnarvon) thought, however, that they jumped at a too hasty conclusion if they assumed that no place could be found within the limits of the English emprire for the reception of our convicts. Undoubtedly weighty objections eiated to the selection of the Hudson's Bay district as apenal colony, for duing several months of the year that Bettlement was entirely inaccessible. Vancouver's lalnd had been suggested as adapted for the purpose, but its vicinity to the United States and the facilties afforded by the chain of islands which aonnected it with the mainland for the escape of convicts rendered it unsuited for the reception of a large criminl population The soil of the Falldand Islands was not adapted to agricultural operations, and the limited extent of these islands, as well as the scanty employment which could be afforded upon ublic works, unfitted them for a large convict settlement. tappeared, however, from the evidence before the committee that Western Australia was a country rich in vegetable and mineral productions, where the great necessity was the creation of harbours and roads, which would afford ample employment for convict labour. But investigatons had been made in Northern Australia whilch showed that it was admirably apted for the 'sta blishmnent of a penal settlement. They had there the wide range of countrywhich was called Carpentaria, which had been surveyed by a most efficient officer, whose report showed that it was rich in productions, and that it comprised extensive tracts of well-timbered and open country. There was, however, another district-the valley of the Victoria-which hbd recently been explored by Mr. Gregory, a very able surveyor and traveller, and which seemed to present great advantages as a penal settlement. This district was generally bare of timber, but the pastures were described as of extraordinary richness. He (the Earl of Camnarvon) would not venture to put his opinion in opposition to that of his noblefriend (theEarl of Harrowby), wvno had access to official documents; bat he might quote the testimony of Sir Roderick Murchison, who was a high authority on the subject, and who, in his address to the Geographical Society the other night, said,- " The real opinion of such an experienced colonist and geographer, whose merits have been already dwelt upon in conferring uponxhim our foundef?s gold medal, is of infinitely greater value than those speculations which would describe the whole of that region, on account of its latitude, as unfit for the settlement of the Anglo-Saxon race I The plain answer to this view is, that on the banks of its navigable river, Victoria, the partyof Wickbam and Stokeewere perfectly healthy in 1839, and that recently our countrymen were stationed there for nine months without the loss of a man. . . . - A region which so many experienced naval officers and other authorities have eulogized as offer. ing capacious harbours and a climate not unsuited to Earopeans-lands in which the pastures are magnificent, while the sea swarms with the finest fishes." Mr. Gregory said,- "This portion of Australia far surpasses the western coast both in its fertility and extent, and its capabilities for settlement. Good harbours are numerous along the coast, and there is abundance of fine country for stock and cultivation." Agaid he said,- "' The valley of the Victorla far exceeds the best parts of Western Australia." Dr. Ferdinand Miuller said,- "N North Australia, with the exception of the east coast, possesses essentially a dry Australian and not a most Indian climate. Fevers do not therefore exist, and we escaped such jungles and swamps as those in which Kennedy's party exhausted their strength. There is abundance of good country in North Australia, and, with access for vessels to lower part of the Victoria, full scope for the formation of a new colony." A despatch of the Colonial Secretary (lIr. Labouchere) contained this passage:-.- "You have called attention to the description which hlr. Gregory gives of the soil and climate on the banks of the Victoria river, and indeed it is of such a nature that it is no extravagant supposition that some of us may live to hear of that hitherto unknown region becoming the home of a prosperous English settlement." With this mass of evidence before them he (the Earl of Carnarvon) thought it was not unreasonable to assert that there was an opening for a penal settlement inthe northern districtof Australia. (Hear.) Heknewthatone objection tothe formation of new convict settlements was that, however well situated those settlements might be, it would be impossible to prevent the escape of convicts. He believed, however, that there would be no possibility of escape from a convict establishment in North Australia, either on its northern, v estern, or southern sides, which were bounded by the mea andby an impenetrable desert. He admitted thatthere was a possibility of escape on the eastern side, but it could not be effected without horses or mules, and then vast sandy deserts and tracts of barren country must be traversed. He thought, therefore, that the colonists in the southern districts could not with any reason orjustice complain of the establishment of a penal settlement in the nortb. Some changes, both of detail and of principle, were necessary to the well-working of the system of transportation. It was desirable to send out convicts Who had a considerable portion of their penal servitude to discharge; and it was absolutely necessary that the number of the free and the convict population should be equalized, and tha' there should be a fair proportion between the sexes. The noble earl concluded by saying that he would gladly have made some observations upon the working of the ticket-of-leave system, but that to do so he must trespass unduly upon their lordships' attention. Viscount DUNGANTNON expressed the disappointment with which he regarded this measure-a disappointment which was, he believed, shared by Lage numbers of the people of England-because it preserved the dangerous and mischievous tickit-of-leave system, and would, as had been said by the noble and learned lord (Lord Campbell), practically leave the convicted person at the discretion of the Home Secretary during the period for which he was sentenced to penal servitude. Tickets-of-leave were no boon to those who held them. They gave the holder no chance of reformation, and the result or the system bad been that in the cases of aU the great crimes committed of late years ticket-of-leave men had bren either the perpetrators of or participators in them. The Earl of DERBY did not propose to offer any object tion to going into committee on this Bill, or, when in committee, to move or suggest any amend. ments, because he thought that the measure was no: capable of being amended at that stage, and that a subject of this kind must be left mainly in the hands of the Government. He must, however, say that, in his judg ment, the BiU was at the best a very imperfect and very unsatisfactory measure. What he mainly complained of was that it did not proceed on any definite principle. The principal alteration which appeared to be made by it was that.,whileformerlytransportationwasasentmcenwhichmight be commuted to punishment at home, now penal servitude at home was to be a sentence which might, at the discretioa of the Home Secretary, be commuted into transportation. Upon what principle was it that the Secretary of State was tobe gaided in substituting the punishment of transportation for penal servitude? Was transportation to be regarded as a mitigation or an aggravation of punishment? The noble earl opposite did not seem to approve the inference drawn by t:he Lord Chief Justice, that it was to be a reward of good conduct to be sent out to the colonies; but what then wai the meaning of the noble earl's language that it was only propoused to send out the best conducted men, whose physical capacities best fitted them for colonists, and that they were to have the additional boon of having theirwives and families send out with them? It did not appear to be stated in the Bil what portion of the sentence was to be carried out at home and what in the colonies. That was left entirely to the discretion of the Secretary of State. He could understand the principle laid down by the noble earl below (Earl Grey), that thestrictlypenal part of the sen tence should be carnied out in this country, and that tha convict, after a certain time, according to his merits, should be sent out to the colony ;but there was a minimum of severe punishment to be undergone in this country, before the expiration of which the Secretary had no power to remove the convict, while under this Bill, on the contrary, there was nothing to prevent the Secretary of State sending a man abroad from the very first hour of his sentence, Is was placed entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State at what period the different stages of the punishment should begin. This Bill did nothing to remedy the present state of things with regard to the disposal of the well-disposed or of the incorrigible convicts. The noble earl below (Earl Grey) had adverted to aproposition entertained by the Government in 1852 for finding out some place to which incorrigible offlnders might be removed and kept under strict surveillance, even during the whole period of their lives. That proposition formed a very important part of the scheme which the Government ha in contemplation at that time and steps were actually taken for securing such a place. On leaving office he had mentioned this plan privately to the noble duke who succeeded to the Colonial Department, but he had not mentioned it publicly for fear of increasiDng the difficulties in the way of the acquisition of that place. Witx regard to incomrrigible offenders, he was strongly of opinion that great evil bad resulted from the principle of granting tickets-of-leave to the extent to which it had been carried out. Great advantage might be derived from the possession of some place within the limits of the British empire, not far removed from the surveiUance of the Govermnent, for the reception of these men. He agreed that it was not advisable to send out to the colonies all the most incorrigible offenders, for then the colonists would have great cause to complain, but much more might have been done for those who were n t incorrigible. The Government had been much too hasty in abandoning the idea cf new penal settlements. Ie did not think that all parts of the world were cloFed to us. Besides West Australia, the north coast of Australia was peculiarly eligible, not in the first instance for the reception of convicts properly so called, but for the establishment of colonies in which persons who hid gone throlgh a portion of their sentences in this country might be sent out as free men to act as pioneers of civiliz . tion. In this manner, by sending out persons who coald not be regarded as incorrigible, but whom it would not ba safe to thrpw out on society ligre, the foundations mi4ht be laid of useful and valuable colonies, which for a long time, if properly managed, might be the means of absorbing oertadn portion of our convict population. This Bil hovever, proceeded on no principle whatever, but left evers. thna greater st te of. unertinty than evern He nto lot mean to g ay thao the discretion of the Secretary of State would be abused, but neither juges nor jury, nor any Tersons concerned in the administration of the criminal ehv,ri would for the future know what it was that they were doing In dealing with prnsoners. The Earl of SALRROWBY sid, it as impossible not to leavo a great deal to the discretion of the Secretarn of State in the initration of the law. a to tickets-of-leave, it was not intended to reta;in themal s a system, butthey would be used only in exceptional cases. The Martasis of SALISBURY regretted that the object for which t a Bill had been so loudly demanded by the country-namely, the abolithon of the ticket-of.leave system -had been entirely lost sight of. Hitherto tho certainty of the punishment bilicted on a criminal had been the great merit of the aw, but that certainiv was destroyed by the system nowr introduced. He hoped that, a far as practicable, the punishment of transportation would be restored. Lord DENMAN believed that the opinion of the country was in favoar of the power of transportation being restored to the judges and against the use of ticketsof. leave. Lord WENSLEYDALE was understood to say that he had strong objections to the practice of discharging crimins fromr pison be'ore the period of their sentences had termninateu. The House then went Into committee on the BilL Chues I to 4 were agreed to. The arquis of SALISBURY proposed a clause givfng power to the Secretary of State to employ criminals sen. tenoedto hard laboar upon public works and hrbours; Bat after a few words from the Earl of HARROWBY the clause was withdrawn for the present. The other clAuses were then agreed to. DIVORCE AND HTRIIMONuAL CAUSES BILLT The report of amendments upon this Bill was brought UP- The LORD CEIANCELLOR said, the discussion which had ti-en place had suggested various, amendments which he now asked the House to agree to. The first was that the temn "judicial Separation" should be substituted for a divorce a mead et tho-, and that the same power be given to a sentence of judicil separation as now belonged to a divorce & m7en et thoro. In reference to the 17th clause, he proposed to give, to a husband or wife against whom a decree of judicial separation had been pronounced on the ground of desertion, the power of applying to the Court for a reversl of the sentence if it could be proved that the absence has been involuntary or unavoidable. Another amendment which he proposed was that in cases which might happen where persons wvho had been judicially separated chose to come together agin, in order that it might be known that the woman had ceased to be afemmezc sote, the parties should enter a notice to that effect in some book to be kept by the Court. Ho also proposed to add a clause exempting Jewish marriges from the operation of the Aict. Theverbal emendments in the clauses up to clause 46 having been agreed to, Earl NELSON moved an amendment in clause 47, the effect of which, he said, would be to confine the remarriage of divorced persons to a civil contract. As the defenders of the Bill had ut aside the scriptural argument, they had no right to avail themselves of ecclesiastical means in carrying their Act into operation. Nothing could be more unjust than to oompel a clergyman who believed that divorce a vinculo was contrary to the law of God to perform the mar. riage service between persons who had been divorced. The result would be to oblige the clergy to violate their consciences or resign their livings. The LORD CHANCELLOR trusted their lordships would not accede to this amendment In order to get rid of a su pposed difficulty on the part of the clergy they were asked to deprive persons of a religious ceremony which, in their eyes, might render their marriage more sacred. T'he law having said that certain parties vwere no longer married, and that it was lawful for them to marry, he could not see why any clergyman should refuse to give cradit to the law and be justified in deolining to perform the marrage service. The Bishop of ST. DAVID'S said, the amendment rested upon two distinct grounds, upon one of which he should be ready to assent to ie, and upon the other to reject it. The scruples of the clergy were repre. sented as resting partly on the law of the church and artly on the law of God. It it were simply a question of Ohe law of the church, he should feelgreat difficulty in saying that there ought or couild be any law repugnant to the law of the land, or that any law of the church could be pleaded for refusing obedience to the law of the State. But, with regard to the law of God, it was impossible for any Act of Parliament to overrule, or change, or effect in the slightest degree any conscientious scruples on that ground. (Hlear, hear.) *Wthout feeling those scruples, he sympathized with those who did, and as the measure would prolably multiply cases in which divorce would be pronounced he would assent to the amendment. The Duke of ARGYLL trusted their lordships would remember that they were discussing in a very thin and empty House a question which, in a very full House, had been decided by a large majority. This was the amendment of the right rev, prelate the Bishop of Oxford in an aggravated form, because, whereas the right rev, prelate proposed only to give individual clergymen room to exercise their own scrtples, this amendment absolutely prohibited any clergyman of the church of England, whether he had scruples or not, from celebrating marriages between persons one of whom had been divorced. In another point of view he thought the right rev. prelates should oppose it. What a step it would be towards the separation of Church aud State if, hy an Act of Parliament providing that parties under certain conditions might marry again, they enacted that they might be married by registrars or ministers of dissenting congregations but not by clergymen of the church of England? He contended that the legal effect of this amendment would be that the marriage could not be celebrated in any church of the church of England or by any clergyman of the church of England. The Bishop of OXFORD pointed the attention of tne House to a clause inserted at his own instance into an Act of last session, by which clergymen were empowered to superadd the religious ceremony to any marriage which had been previously solemnized at the registrar's office in cases where the parties wished to avail themselves of the religious rite. He contended that the arguaent of the noble duke fell to the ground, because the amendment, together with the provision in the Act of last session, would enable persons who wished to be married before the registrar, and yet to superadd the religious oeremony, to apply to a clergyman for that purpose, only taking care to obtain the services -of one whose conscience would not be violated by the performanoe of the ceremony. The amendment would therefore relieve clergymen who had a scruple in reference to such marriages, and at the same time enable parties to add the religious ceremony to a marriage solemnized before the registrar if they wished to do so. He trusted, therefore, the House would grant this redress, for it was precisely in the track of the law that was passed last year, and so prevent the great evil of a collision between Church and State, Lord REDESDALE supported the amendment, oontending that what was asked by it was strictly in accordance with the course of legislation in existing Acts of Parliamient, and citing the case of the Quakers, whose conscientioas scraples had been respected by the legislative permwsion accorded to them to substitute an affirmation for an oath. He added, that if he himself were a clergyman he should refuse to marry persons wrho had been divorced, believing as he did in the mndissolubility of the marriae tie. Earl GRiNVILLE said, it had been admitted with perfect fairness that the effect of the amendment would be to reverse a decision which had been arrived at in a very full House (hear, hear), and he did not believe that if the House were now equally fall there would be any disposition to adopt such a course. He could hold out no expectation on the part of the Government that, as at present advised, they would be inclined to acquiesoe in the amendment Ele did not think the reference of the noble lord to the case of Quakers was at all in point, for Quakers were persons who were not in a position which required them to discharge publio duties. If, as a right rev, prelate ,had said, these marrages were forbidden by the law of God, why should a registrar be compelled to solemnize a marriage which he might consider contrary to the divine law, while a clergyman was reheved from such an obligation. After a few words in explanation from the Bishop of ST. DAvVsh', The Bishop of LLANDAFF said, although he did not think that i;he dissolution of marriage was ia every case forbidden by the law of God, he believed that remarriage was contrary to that law, He would therefore support the amendment. The Bishop of SALISBURY was convinced in his own mind that tha manigee against which the amendEnent was directed were contrary to the divine law, and if he were called upon to solemnize such a marriage he could not hesitate as to which law he should follow-the law of his God or the law of the State. He therefore besought their lordships, by adopting the amendment of the noble earl, to give clergymen a means of escape from the difficulty in w-ich they might otherwise be placed. Earl GREY said that when this question was previously before the House he had not supported the amendment of the right rev. prelate, who wished, as it appeared to him, to claim for individual clergymen the right to refuse to perform certain marriages which they thought contrary to the law of God. In his opinion it would be most objec- tionable thus to lay down the principle that the cclesiastical law was to supersede the law of the land, and that individual clergymen might determine which law they would obey. As he understood, a practical and legal marriage could be contracted before a registrar, and therefore the inconvenience which might have arisen under the right rev. prelaWs amendment would be in a tgeat measure obviated. The statements made to-night as to the existence of scruples of conscience on the part of clergymen were much stronger than those maade on the previous occasion, and he thought that, even as a matter of policy, such scruples oughtIto be treated with every possible indulgence. (Hear, hear.) He trusted that Her Majesty's Government would adopt this amendment ; but, feeling the inexpediency of reversing in a comparatively small House, and when the question was not expected to be raised, a decision previously come to, he should recommend the noble earl who had moved theamendment not to press it to a division at present, but to bring it forward again on the third reading of the Bill. The Bishop of GLOCESTER said that in his own diocess there was a considerable number of clergymen who regarded this as a scriptural question. If the Bil passed without the insertion of some protection for the consciences of sach clergymen, what the noble duke (Argyll) had said would be true in a different sense from that in which he meant it, and this would be a most important step towards the separation of Church and State. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY said that if their lordsbips considered only the scruples of clergymen they might place in avery difficult position many members of the church of England who objected to be married before a regtrar, The effet of the ptinciple involved in this amendment would be to relieve the clergyman from the performance of any dutis ihmpoe4 upon himn by law which he chose to say violated his cosndietious scruples. He, for one, should moot xtroney obie¢t to the introduction of suchaprinciple. OnD thatgtoun , tberefors and because it was most unusual in aP comparatively *mall jouse, eontistinSchi.efiy! friends of the motion,toatte, t tto reverse a previously arrived at decision, he hoped their I lordships would not agree to this amsndmeht. If they did the questiou would oe again brought forward, and there would be a third discussnn. Viscount DUNGANNON denied that his noble friend (EArl Nelson) Lad at all taken the House by surprise. Earl NELSON keid that he had not even -written to his nearest friends on this subject. All he had done was to place his notioe on the paper on Wednesday. The LORD CHANCELLOR said, that without pledging himself positively to the mneaning of the clause, his i- pression was that, as the remarriage of the divorced persons would be governed entirely by this Act, the effeot of the amendment would be to prevent them from being married anywhere but at the regiserais. Their Lordshi then divided on the armendment, The numbers svere- Content... .. ..*. . 17 Zion-content... .. .. .. ..21 Majority . ... The am*endment was consequently lost. The Bishop of OXFORD moved the insertion of an amendment after the 27th clause, giving the new court the power which was now occasionally exercised by their Lord. ships' House, of settling the property of the parties in cas of divorce for adultery. Lord REDESDALE: gave notice that on the thirdreadin of the Bill he should move the omisulon from the th-I- clause of the words "and of divorce," with a view of excepting the divorce a vinculo altogether from the opera. tion of the BilL The Bishop of OXFORD gave notioe that, in the event of this amendment not being carried, he should move that the Bill be read a third time that day six months The Bill contained several amendments of the law which he should be glad to see carried into effect, but he could not consent to purchase them at the cost of the very serious injury to the morals of the people which the introduction of this law of divorce would bring about. Earl NELSON also gave notice that he should again move the amendment which had just been negatived, or one to a similar effect. The House adjourned at half-padt 9 o'clock

Mr. GRIFFITI zave notice that it was his intention to move for leave to introduco a Bill to alter and amend this Act. TROOPS IN TEE MAURITIUS. Mr. LAURIE asked the Under-Secretary for War whet*er the regiments at and upon their passage to tho Mauribitis had orders to proceed to China; whether their pay would be at the same rate as the regiments nowv quartered in Indis and, if not, what was the reason why such was not the case? He also begged leave to repeat the question as to when the Orders of the Miedjidie would be repealed? Sir J. RAMSDEN said, that some of our troops vwere now upon their way from the Mauritius to China, but they were so simply in the ordinary routine course of proceeding, and it was not the intention of the Government to draw upon the force usually stationed at the MIauritius in order to reinforce the expedition to China. The troops in China woald not receive the same rate of pay as those which were quartered in India. They would, however, be paid the ordinary colonialallowance as now issued in the case of the troops stationed at Hongkong. In reply to the last question, he had to stathat the official list of those upon whom the Order of the Medjidie was to be conferred would soon be published, and be might add that it wouald have been pub- ished bef ore, were it not that it had been found necessary to make certain alterations in the mode in which the list had been drawn up. REFORHATORY SCHOOLS BILL. Sir E. RERRISON asked the Secretary of State for the iHome Department whether it was his intention to introdace Into the Reformatory Schools Bill amendments to render more effectual the process of obtaining money from parents for the maintenance of their children in reformatory schools ? Sir G. GREY said, he hoped when the Bill went into committee to be able to introduce into it certain amendments to effect that object. THE DRAWINGROOMS AT ST. JAMES'S PALACE. The question that the House at its rising should adjourn to Monday next having been put, Mr. G. DUNDAS rose, pursuant to notice, to cal the attention of the Govornnemit to the great inconvenience which was experienced by ladles attendingHe t Drawingrooms at St. Same6's Paa, Hwing to Iaie Of. properarrangementsto facilitate their r"e4pim d.- patre. The hon. gentlemAwn aid that the ODC of coniderable domestic interest, inaA i it cerned the comfort and the health of a laigeportio of Her Ma je'ta mot loyal subject. That wasb'y no nsnesa h> might add, the firt occaion upon whch the ;nattsU*. been brought under *he notioe of ibe public. On the esontr*1y, the compainta which weremade of the faulty arruga. nents at St. J&amess Palce, when Her Majesty- held lieCourt there, were of annual occurrence. IdlgnatlAnt earatteryear been expreseed at the ordeal whie those who attended upon such occasions had to go through, owing 't,' which ordeal that which ought to ben agreeable duty "a. turned into a painful and distressing task. Those com. plaints and that indignation, however, paased away asbd were almost forgotten, bewause those who wreo the xufferer, were of the gentler sex, whose voioe could not be heard (a laugh) within the walrl of that Houe, and rwho were therefore constrained to endure their fate in. silence, or to call attentiort to it by mean of thlie friends or through the columns of a newspaper. The, grievnco had at last beoome intolerable, and the experience of last Saturday and the senes which he was compelled tiotness were so painful and distressing that he oped they werethen sen for the last time. (Hear hear.) i was confident that if the noble lord at the hos£ of th Govemment had been there his weU.lknown gpeoity an& sympathy forthose whose hardshipe he was represwnti would have induced him to give an order that differenl arrangements should be rude to prevent the recurrencu of, such scenes. He need hardly remind Her Majes's FirsHt Commissioner of Works that the times were greatly changa since thatpe obdings afforded ample acmoa.g0 fohe Stars What in those days was conaidered Mig.- nificent would now be considered insignificant, and apnrments which had been constructed as lofty and xpaios seemed to us small and mean. How much the evil was now' exaggerated would be seenvwhenthey rememberedthevastly inereaing number of those who now thronged to pLy theLr respects and duty to their gr*cious Queen. The fiower of' the British people were there asembled, forming the. most brilli-nt tourt and amemblage of beatu of' which any nation in Europe could boast. (Cheersand laughter.) But, if we might cherish a feein.. of pride that these were our faircountrywomen, it was dif'cuitt to repreas a feeling of shame last Sturday that these our countrywomen should have to undergo the pain, misery, and hardship to which they Were there exposeod (Hear, hear.) He found that no less than 981 ladies Attended thbe drawmng-room, out of whom 264 were preeented There. was also a very large proportion of gentlemen, but areturn of their number he had been unable to obtain. (A_ laugh.) Keeping these numbers in view, it required no' grt stretch of the imagination to realize the state of thatlong narrow corridor whichafforded the only mean, of es,r and accesstothe Palace with the exc,eption ofthe "-ilih admitted a liaited number of persong. It was difficut to. imagine any Arrangements more unsuited to facilitto thedeparture of a large number of persons from a building than, this eorridor. It terminated abruptly at the front door of the Palaoe, up to which carmlges drove in rotati6n, whesi the names of those to whom they belonged were called out; but the paage became choked up from end to end. and the pressure at the door became excessive. Throughi this. c!owd it was a matter of difficulty and delicacy for a lady to force her way, and when she arrived atthe doorafter a violent struggle, panting and exhausted, with her' clGthes crushed and perhaps torn, she not unfrequently. found that her carriage hadbeen compeUed to drive on, ani her only alternative was to remain in the open shed out of doors with a large number of ladies who were in a simijar situation. (Hear, hear.) In this plight, exposed to the in. clemency of the weather, in the midst of the rain ai. damp, they were exposed to contact with attendants whose clothee were saturated with moisture (a laugh, and " Hear, hear"), and this many a fair dame endured for hours lab Saturday. (Hear, hear.) Prostrated with fatigue, faintng: with exhaustion and heat from the pressure of this middlEpassage, perhaps with a costly and splendid dress crushed and entirely ruined (a laugh), many of thee laie staL* down and sought repose, not on benches provided against, such an emergency, bat upon the soiled and coase matting that covered the flagstone, awaiting in patience tho moment; thabt brought their carriages to their reief. Nor wasthere a want lelsewhere of benches which might have alleviated a corsiderable amount of suffering; btut where were' thej? 'Withaningenuitythat reflectedereditonthejadgmeer and sll of somebody, these benches were placed not only where they were entirely useless, but where they became a, positivesttmbling.blockandnuisance. They were placedimn the large room in which was that memorable structure knowa as " the Pen" (a laugh), and there they did the duty of trapsg and pitfalls, and caused many an illfated lady to be thrown violently to the ground. But why should he mention any particular arrangements when al were so bad? What could: be worse than that miserable " Pen" at the fatal entry towhich many a fair girl's anticip%tions of a drawing.vrlo reoeived their first shock and disappointment (laughte-, cries of " Ob, oh !" and "Question P"), and where with X mutilated costume she became no longer in a condition toc. be introduced to her Sovereign? (" Question P") He had not. exaggerated these scenes. He had had the pain of witnessing them, and not a fer ladies had assured him of their reality. (Laughter.) He trusted he had said enoughe to justify the notice he had put on the paper. He felt that the appeal he now made to the Government' would not be disregarded, and tbat, now that the fGates had been brought before the noble lord at the head of the Government, a remedy would be found. He was confident, also, that if their Royal Mistress could be aware howinch was endured by those who gathered together to bow beforer her and do honour to her she would manifest that warm, sympathy which she possessed in so preeminent a degree, and which she never failed to extend to the noblest and bighest as well as the lowest of her sabjects, and that her generous impulses would prompt her to take steps to prevent the recurrence of scenes so painful and unbecoming. (Cheers.) A loud and general cry was raised for Lord Ernest Bruce, the Vice-Chamberlain, who sat upon the Treasury bench, to address the House, but the noble lord contented himself with raising his hat in acknowledgment of the call. Sir B. HALL rose, but was for some moments unable toobtain a hearing from the continued cries for "Bruce." The' right hon. baronet said, -I have much pleasure in answering. the appeal of my hon. friend. I believe that it is imposbiel to exaggerate the great inconvenience experienooed by ladies who attended the drawing-room on Saturday. (Cheers.> It must be recollected that the drawing-rooms arenow held in the same apartments in which they were heii many years ago, when there were only 100 or 200 assemble1 to pay their respects to the Queen; and it is perhaps kno;,. also, that when thosedrawing-rooms wereheldthe Queen wasin the habit of going round the apartment, for which there was plenty of space, and noticing those whom she desired t I honour. But, instead of 100 or 200 persons, there are nowupwards of 1,000 and sometimes 1,400 persons at: many of the drawing-rooms, and although the dress of the ladies in former days was large, yet I believe that at thepresent moment they occupy very nearly the same space. (A laugh.) It is therefore utterly impossible that auy comfort should be experienced by those who attend H r Majesty's drawing-rooms, and I am happy to inform the hon. gentleman and the Honse that I have received instructions from the Government to prepare plans for theenlargement of the accommodation of St. James's Palace. (loud cries of "*o so no PI " Oh ! oh !"), and I hope I sbalt he able to lay such plans upon the table at an early period. (murmurs.) Lord J. MANNERS (who rose amid renewed cries oF' "Bruce !") wished to know whether the plans would be carried out without reference to Parliament. Sir B. A.LL.-They are not drawn yet, but no step,. are to be taken without the consent of Parliament. GENERAL BOARD OF HEALTH BILL. Mr. KNIGHT wished to know when this Bill would beproceeded with? Sir G. GREY would place it as the second order for Monday next. Mr. FALK hoped that the House would have an opportunityof discussing this question, which not only affected: the interests of a great number of persons, but the character of the Government was to some extent involved in it. Mr.HENLEY pointed out the inconvemence arising from. tho Government suddenly withdrawing orders of the day o.' which they had given notice-a practice which caused important business to be brought on in the absence of hor. members st an earlier hourthan could reasonably be expected. The motion for adjourning the House at its rising till Monday next was then agreed to. PRESTON UNION. On the motion for going into Committeo of Supply, Mr. COBBETT rose to call the attention of the Hounse to the circamstances under which an order to build a work- house had been addressed by the Poor Law Board to tie. guardians of the Preston Union (Lancashire). The hon. gentlemansaid that by the PoorLaw Amendment Act the PoorLaw Board had the power, when they had obtained the assent of the majority of the board of guardians of a union, to order the local authorities to purchase land for the purpose of building a workhouse. The 3Sth section of the, statute declased that there should be at least one eletive' guardian for every parish, and thst the county justies of the peace should be zofficiDo guardians. It was also enacted that nothing should be done by any guardian as a member of the board excepb at a meeting; bat this rule was subje; to one very remarkable exception-viz., that the Poor Law' Board should have power to dispense with this last- provision. It appeared that the Poor Law Board put themselves in communication about the latter part of 1855. with the chairman of tho Pzeston Union, who was al cx officio gnardian, and obtained, principally throughb bis instrumeDtality, the signatures of 22 out of 21 .C the other ec officio guardians, and also of 11 of the electiveguardians, to a requisition to the Poor Law Board, l rying that board to issue an order Calling on them to hn Id . union workhouse. The order* was applied for in March, 1856, and it wsS made by the Poor Law Board accordingly. He was anxious to elicit an explanation as to the resons forthis proceeding from the right hon. gentleman '(Mr- Bouverie); also, whether it was the practioe of the PoorLaw BoArd to obtain the sanction of Poor Law guardians im. ths manner, and whether it was their intention to enforce, theorder they had issued resecting the Preston Union. This was a question of considerable importane, bezause many cther unions were similarly situated to that at Pres- ton, and it was felt that the rights of the ratepayers were. involved in this matter. Mr. BOUVERIE said, the usual praotice had been fl. lowed in the case alluded to. The Poor IAw Board was enabled by statute to authorize the elected and ex officio guardians of any union to give their consent individuay, and not as a board, to the eretion of a workhoue In w h
THE WEST INDIA SrEAMEp& TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The directors of this compay have with much re. gret notioed in your paper of yesterday a letter of complaint signed by many of the pasengers recently arrived from the Weet Indies by the steamship Paraa. The directors cannot but think that the sttements have been mae under some excitement, and that an oxaggerat coount has been given of the inconveniences of the pag. saee, as may be seen from the following explanations, The first subject of complaint is " the assemblagp at St. Thomass, in certain months of tbe 7ear, of more pasengers than can be comfortablyaoommuodated on board the home. wr ship" It is quite trme that it happens so occasionally, butAot always, and, therefore, no person desirinz aae by an interoolonial vese to meet the homerd , be content with a refusal, while there is a ibility of his finding room in the steamer for England. If the number of passengers arriving at St. Thomas's be greater than can be aocommodated in the way desired every effort is at onoe made to provide extra berths, so as to carry all forw.rd as comforably as circumstanos will permit, for the exclusiozt of any portion would unquestionably afford more serious gound ior remonstrance3 than the inconvenienoe resulting from crowrded ships; passengera, howvever, are offered tho option, under such circumstances, of witing a fortnight for the following steamer, or of having their pasae money returned in London for the uncompleted portion of their voyage, should t'hey prefer proceeding to ngland by any. other route. lall caws when passengers on arrival at St Thou mass fail to secure the description of accommodation origi. nally paid for, a return is made to an extent which places them on the same footing as if they bad occupied inferior accommodation throughout. The next is a statement "that, although the Parana offered accommodation for only 180, or at most 200 passengers, she received 302 and that her passenger crowded together, sleeping, washing, and dressing wfherever they could, irrespective of sex, age, and condition." An un- intentional, though not unimportant mistake, is here made as regards nambers. There were only 297 passengers, and of these 56 were children under 12 years of age, and mn-Y of them in arms, 20 servants, and 12 not entitled to cabin berths; so that, after all, the adult saloon passengers wore comparatively ,w in excess of the nunmber for whicht it is admitted the ship possessed accommodation. In fact, by constructin2 20 extra berths, for which the great capacity of the ship afforded ample space, all were pro. vided with sleeping place As to the other portion of the statement, the captain reports that all the ladies and female servants were provided with cabins or bed places in the ladies' saloon, and that dreasing and washing rooms for the gentlemen were provided entirel apart from the plaoea used for a similar purpose by the a l passengers The third allegation i "that at the time of sailing several of the crew were showing symptows of the yeUow fever, but were taken on notwithstanding and allowed to remain on the main deck crowded together with crew and rssengers, Uc.; besides which there was the oertain know. edgethat if any accident occurred the boats of the ship un er the bes' regulations could not accommodate more tha 200 persons, therefore about the same number would be doomeo to certain death." In reply to this the captain reports that, although on leaving St. Thomas's two or three of the men were ailing, there was no case on board that had been pronounoed as fever, and that immediately it broke out afterleaving that place a hospital was erectedon the spardeck to which all the men who had fever were removed, the only exception being that the doctor wasallowed to remain in his cabin, and the fourth officer had a cot on. the malndeclc forward, next the forecastle, but screened from observation with canvas all round. As regards the boats, the complaining passengers were evidently labouring under an erroneous impression, thefour ifeboats alone have easily carried 200 soldiers, with all their acoutrements, besides the crewss; and these, with four other boats belonging to the Parana, the directors believe, would have been quite equal to c3rry all the persons who were on boDad that vessel had any emergency unfortunately occurred to make recourse to the boats necessary. The letter then sets forth tbe comartive careity of provisions ehiefly in request, &c. To this the directors beg to reply that an inquiry having been directed by them to be made through Captain Vmncent, their superintendent at Southampton, he has reportedthat he has carefully examined the list of stores pat on board the Parana at St. Thoma's, and that the supply was ample for 18 or 20 days for the number of psssngers brought home. The commander of the Parana also sttes that the quantities were examined at St. Thomas's by his steward, purser, and himself in the presence of Mr. Cameron, the company's superintendent, all of whom felt confident that there was saple for 20 dava ; but that, s the weather continued fine, and there was no doubt of making a quick pasage, he (the oommander) allowed more stock than usual to be hilled aud used in lieu of other provisions, and that there was ix oonsequence a proportionately small surplus of fresh meat at the end of the voyage. The fifth point is an allegation that great partiality was shown in the distribution of the cabins en board the Parana at St. Thomas's, &c. Itlis clear also that in this matter the oomplainants have been mistaken. The captain reports that the cabins were illotted strictly in acoordance with the company's printed regulations, and under the inspection of the company's superintendent (the only deviation being that some of the gentlemen were required to gbie up their berths for the accommodation of ladies), so that no more than the proportion to which they were entitled were alotted to the St. Thomaa's passengers. In oonclusion, I am to remark that regard tothe interests of the company imposes on the directors the necessity of studying the convenience and coomfort of the publio and promoting the snme by all practicable mens, and they t elive that their arrangements would have led to no ex. pression of compldint on the present occasion if the inconvenience of a crowvded ship had not been much agrvated by the deatb of tbe chief steward and twro or three more of the most valuable of the saloon attendants, Requesting the favour of your giving publiidty to this explanation, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. - - _ x.

LONDOA4, SATUBDAY, JUNE 13, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, Lord GRA.Yviu., in reply to Lord RAvRwswo RTI, 'atated that increased accommodation was to Fe afforded to ladies attending HnR MAJESTY'S Drawing rooms. Lord HlAnnoWBY then moved that the :Hous3 ahould go into committee on the Transportatioa Bill, the object of which was to enable Government to comply with the wishes of the colony of Western Australia, and at the same time to obviate some of the evils at home to which the ticket-of-leave system had given rise. Lord CAMIPBELL objected to the Bill as being virtually a Echeme to make transportatior rather a. reward for meritorious criminals than a punishment for the worst offenders. Lord GREY could not agree with Lord CAMeBnr in this opinion. He should support tho Bill on the 8imple ground that it retraced as far as possible the erroneous step which the House took in 1852 and 1853, and enabled the Government in future to make use of transportation to as great an extent as was practicable to relieve the country from the presence of a class of persons who had become dange.ous to the peaceable and well-disposed part of the community. Lord CARNARVON thought that the Government took too naurow a view of the question, and was convinced that many other portions of the British empire might be found as weU suited for purposes of transportation as Western Australia. Lord DERBY thought the BiU a very imperfect and unsatisfactorv measure. It proceeded on no principle whatever, and left everything in a state of uncertamty. The House then went into committee, and the several clauses were agreed to. The report of amendments on the Divorce Bill was then brought up, when Lord NEwSON moved an amendment on clause 47, intended to contine the remarriage of divorced persons to a civil contract. After considerable discussion the amendment was rejected on a division, the numbers being Content ... ... ... 17 Not content ... ... ... 21 Majority... -4 Their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of Commons, on the motion that the House at its rising do adjourn until Monday, Mr. G. DUNDAS called the attention of the Government to the oreat inconvenience experienced by ladies attending IKn MATEsTr's drawing-rooms at St. James's Palace, owing to the want of proper arrangements for their reception and departure, entering into minute details which appeared to be rather amusing than instructive to the House. Sir B. HALL admitted the inconvenience, and stated that he had received instructions to prepare plans for the enlargement of the accommodations in St. James's Palace. The motion for adjournment was agreed to. On the order for going into Committee of Supply, Mr. CosBBrx called attention to the circumstances under which an order to build a workhouse was addressed by the Poor Law Board to the guardians of the Preston Union, Lancashire. Mr. BOUVERI;E gave the explanations sought by Mr. COB1asTT. Sir G. PECHELL and Mr. DEusm-oND spoke upon the subject. Sir F. BARING called attention to the expenditure in St. James's Park, amounting to 11,0001., there having been no money voted by Parliament for that object. It was not the question, he observed, whether the expenditure was proper or not, but how it was that public money had been expended without the proper sanction of Parliament. Whether the explanation should be satisfactory or not, the House, he thought, ought not to pass the estimate until the full papers were before them. Sir B. HALL stated the course he had taken with relation to the works in St. James's Park, and although he admitted that, as a general rule, money should not be expended without the previous sanction of Parliament, yet circumstances might arise, he observed, as in the present case, that would justify such expenditure. Mr. BENTINCK noticed what he considered to be the inconsistency of refusing expenditure for necessary or useful objects and wasting thousands upon a fish-pond, which showed, in his opinion, the want of a due supervision of the expenditure of the country. After some remarks by Sir D. NonnEys and Mr. HoPE, Iord J. MANi-xBs considered that Sir B. HAr.r?s explanation was not satisfactory as to the past, and afforded no security in respect to this exceptional course of proceeding for the future. Sir H. WILLouGoun thought the expenditure was a violation of the privileges of the House. Mr. MOWRBAY remarked that this was not the only instance of a large expenditure without the previous sanction of the HEouse; thousands had been so spent last year upon fireworks. The CHANcE:Lono of the EXCHEQUER reminded the House that the expense of the fireworks was defrayed out of the Civil Contingencies,-a gross amount placed at the disposal of the Government. MIr. HENLEY remarked that it did not much matter out of what fund the money was paid. The subject then dropped, and the House went into a Committee of Supply on the Civil Service and Revenue Estimates, when Mr. WILSON made his promised general statement in regard to the reasons of the great increase in these estimates, the gross amount of which, he stated, had swelled from 2,393,0001., in 1838, to 6,724,0001. in the last year; and even from 1852 the increase had been no less than 2,316,0001. This augmentation, he observed, was not to be charged against the Government, every shilling having been voted by the House and being under its control. A large portion of it resulted from the mere transfer of charges from the Consolidated Fund and other heads of expenditure, the amount of which transfers in the year 1854 was no less than 1,436,0001. He then stated the accretions to these estimates from votes for education, art and science; for Holyhead harbour and harbours of refuge; for printing and stationery, which had largely increased from various causes; for prisons and convict services; and for puolic buildings, chiefly those under the Board of Works and Government offices. The increase upon these votes exceeded the amount of difference between the estimates of 1852 and 1866. Mr. WmSOX next explained the manner in which the increaee in the Civil Service Estimates for the present year had arisen, observing that the causes of the increase in these estimates lay in a very small compass; they all involved questions of high policy, being mixed up with the interests, social and commercial, of the country, and wore peculiarly in the bands of the House, which would have an opportunity of considering and deciding whether this increased expenditure should be maintained, and whether it should not be even carried further. The items of expenditure which were peculiarly in the hands of the Government-namely, the salaries of public officers, notwithstanding the increase of business, had actually diminished in amount. Iu conclusion, he cautioned the House against throwina local burdens upon the Consolidated Fund, where6y the benefit of local check was lost, mentioning, by way of example, that since 1846, when the House relieved the coumty rates of the cost of prosecutions, and the localities had consequently no motive for vigilance, those costs had risen up to a quarter of a million a-year. He then moved the first vote of 136,14G1., in addition to 60,0001. already voted on account, for the Royal Palaces and public buildings. Sir J. PAKINGTON complained of the inconvenient course taken by Mr. WiLsoN of making his general statement after the SPEAK=r had left the chair. A discussion of great length ensued, in which the general statement of Mr. WasoN was blended, in spite of the Chairman's interference, with the first vote and with other extraneous maatters, until the confusion of topics became so great that it was proposed, with the view of extricating the debate from embarramsment, that the Chairman should report progress. At length the general subject was by consent laid aside, and the discussiou was confined to the vote for the Palaces and buildings; but here a new difficulty presented itself in the form of the vote, or rather in the forms of the HIouse applicable to the vote, which appeared insuperable, and after about two hours' discussion, the matter becoming more and more perplexed, the vote was withdrawn for the present, Sir B. HAi. undertaking, in order to obviate the difficulty, to divide the vote into three distinct votes, The next vote of 75,7811. for Parks, pleasuregrounds, &c., encountered a similar obstacle, and, after another discussion, the Government, apparently in despair, at length consentedthat the haixC au should "report progress." The Joint-Stock Companies Act Amendment Bill was read a thirdl time and passed. On the order for going into committee upon the Souind Dues Bill, Mir. W. WaitMs moved to defer the committee for six months, and this amendment was seconded by Colonel WHITE. The CHANCELLOi\ ofthe EXCHEQuER defended the Bi-l, and after somo,lemarks by Mr. W'VLD and Mr. Ayumo(~s t-he iupwUtent was negatived, and that House went into committee upon the Bill, the single clause of which was agreed to. The Court of Exchequer (Ireland) Bill was read a third timne and passed. Other Bills were advanced a stage. The House adjourled at 25 minutes to 1 o'clock until MIonday.
The House of Commons began last night with considering, under several aspects, the relations between the State on the one hand and the locality -that is, the country, the town, or the parish -on the other. It is a question on which everybody has something to say, and everybody supposes that he has an opinion. Probably there is no question more certain to start an animated conversation at an English dinner-table, or wherever half-a-dozen Englishmen are gathered together. The House of Commons had a great deal to say about it, and we should think nothing but want of time or courage prevented the whole 656 members from contributing to the conversation. There is the national and there is the local authority, the national and the local object, the national and the local taxation. To name these things is to provoke the strongest expression of feeling in some quarters; indeed, in most quarters. It is not surprising, then, that, after a preliminary burst of indignation at the cleansing of the lake in St. James's Park at the national expense, and an indignant remonstrance at the cost incurred by the nation on the fireworks last year, Mr. JA=ss Wisox found it necessary to adopt a very apologetic tone on the immense increase of the Civil Service Estimates, and to offer some cautions against undertaking more of the local expenditure. The comparison of the national and the local ran through his speech. There, however, as in the previous conversation, and as in the other discussions upon this subject that are sure to meet one's eyes in any paper one takes up, there is always one thing that one wants and has a right to requiire. We ask for a comprehensive doctrine on the subject of national and local government and taxation that shall satisfy all the requirements of the case. We meet with abundant and most energetic expostulations against this or that grievance, this or that burden, this or that assumption. Sometimes it is a payment which is objected to; sometimes a dictation which is protested against; sometimes an object which is vilified, according as one side or the other is taken on the question. That there is much honest independence and much public spirit in theseremonstranceswewill not doubt. These mutual antagonisms doubtless contribute much to the formation of the national character and polity. But we return to our original observation, that nobody seems to hold himself responsible for such a view on the relations of the State and the locality as shall even pretend to consider everything that must be taken into account. Indeed, the general tone is rather a saucy disclaimer of any such responsibility. It is thought rather a fine thing to protest against an object, an interference, an obligation, or a burden, and to throw upon others the duty of considering what is to be done, who is to do it, and by what means. What Air. WiLsoN chiefly proposed to himself last night was to explain the immense increase in the Estimates for the Civil Service since the year 1852. It is a fact which has been made very prominent lately, and has been adduced as a proof of the little claim Liberal Governments really have to the palm of economical virtue. If, however, Ireland, if England and Scotland, followingthe example, if every class and every interest, and every school of philanthropy, of science, and of progress, will continue to throw fresh burdens upon Parliament, and if Parliament, frightened at the amount, and suspicious of dishonesty, will insist, very fairly, in taking every vote separately, demanding an estimate, and scrutinizing the object, then by a double process of expenditure and superintendence the Estimates must increase without limit, and all the power of the older and wiser legislators must be taxed to keep things as well as they are. For a time the Consolidated Fund was an easy and commodious receptacle for burdens which had become disagreeable to one clams or another. To most people it was as much a mere name as the National Debt. But even the surface of the earth, even granite quays, and the natural seashore, may be subjected to too great a pressure. The shoulders of ATLAs himself tired at last with the weight of the heavens, and the Consolidated Fund began to ache and groan with its accumulated burdens. So, of late years, not only have some considerable items been taken bodily out of it, and transferred to the votes, but charges generally that either had or would pass in some silent, unobserved, invariable form, were put on the votes, and made the subject of annual discussion. Hence both the generosity and the jealousy of the House of Commons have conspired to raise these Estimates to their present very formidable height, the actual increase of the national expenditure for civil purposes since 1852 being happily much more apparent than real. The turn of the Debate last night shows, if nothing else showed it, how much confusion prevails on those subjects, and how few people give themselves the trouble to ascertain the principles on which to contemplate the national expenditure. When the Secretary of the Treasury had done his best to explain the increase which has caused soimuch financial alarm, and had set before the House all the new or enlarged items of civil expenditure, showing who was answerable for each item and what was to be said for it, as a matter of form he concluded with proposing a vote for the completion of the sum required for the Royal Palaces and public buildings. This was in itself a very simple affair; but, as the Secretary of the '3rcasury had, when in committee, and in moving this vote, gone into the whole question of our civil expenditure and the checks lately introduced, he was followed into that wide field by Sir JOHN PAKITGTON and others, anxious to explain their views on the subject. The result was a reign of confusion which lasted several hours, and which defied all attempts to simplify or formalize the question before the House. The turn thus taken by the Debate and the spirit in which it was carried on supply a singular comment on the particular remonstrance which led to this rather angry discussion. Sir Jon PAXINGTON had indignantly claimed for Mr. DISRAEL the credit that had been given to Mr. GLA.DSTONE for bringing on the votes the charges for the collection of the re- venue. The constitutional propriety and the financial convenience of this alteration we are ready to maintain; but it is not recommended by an angry altercation on a merely formal vote and a confusion so utter as to require a night's rest and a day's thought to deliver the Heuse from it. That, it appears, is the present condition of the Civil Estimates ; and if it is so desirabhl that every item of expenditure should annually form the subject of a separate discussion we trust there will be some better agreement as to the mode and temper in which it. shall be done.
No thinking man wishes to p-obibit Missionary enterprise in ladia any more than elsewhere. We can all full$ 3hait the sincerity, the energy, and the occasioa ability of the men who devote their lives 'to 3ealai'aning these distant miliona from idolatr: and barbarinm. Nor are tho results vaIRas. If the Missionaries do not efect what t)aes dWre they yet produce good which they [1n.;011 meditated. Eamitnes, qdf'denial, and x strong philanthropical impulse cannot fail of acting in some way on mankind. go much energy and confidence could hardly be lost. If the Missionaries make few converts, they yet act on the great mass of the natives by mixing 'with them, educat-. ing them, and instilling into their minds the frst rudiments of Eturopean knowledge. So far, then, the Government of India may well give to Missionary exertions all the encouragement which is involved in a free permission to preach and teach. Analogous is the ease of our philanthropists at home. Since the days when orators became famous by their invectives on WAnitE HAsuTGs we have never wanted men to take under their protection every kind of native sufferer. Whether it be the family of a dethroned Prince, or the Prince himself, or a people which has fallen under our dominion, or a people which has revolted, or a race of savages at war with us, there is sure to be a motion in Parliament or an agitation out of doors to redress their wrongs and denounce British aggression. We have no wish that it should be otherwise. The strength and solidity of British ru;le awe founded on the general justice with which dependent races have been treated, and it is by no means a disadvantage that a band of over-scrupulous critics should exist ready to question any act of our Generals or Governors which might in the least savour of tyranmy. But, while granting to Missionaries and to their allies at home full liberty of action and comnient, we must protest against making their iunluence part of the machine of government. The Ministry had, we think, no choice on Thursday evening but to oppose the resolutions by which Mr. KW.NiAID proposed to censure the whole Administration of Bengal on the authority of certain zealous and well-meaning, but evidently imprudent, petitioners. The state of the Bengal peasantry is, no doubt, most unhappy. For a hundred years they have been under the authority of the East India Company, and it cannot be said that they have advanced in enterprise or independence during that time. It may well be believed that what they were in the days of CLIVE they are nownay, that in the present age they are even more helpless than of yore. The solid fabric of British power weighs on them, but does not shelter them. Towards the close of the last century the Government of Lord CopNwkA,s, unable to understand any relation in the occupation of land except that of landlord and tenant, established the present Zemindaree system, which givea to the Zemindar a power over the cultivators of the soil which has been too often used for the purposes of tyranny and extortion. The Bengalee himself is made by nature for submission, and, whether it be to a Mussulman, a Christian, or a native master, he yields in helpless servitude. As is also generally the case, the worst oppressors are to be found among his own people, and these are everywhere, while the presence of Europeans is confined to a few localities almost beyond the reach of his complaints. A small band of English hold this great country of 40,000,000 or 50,000,000 of people, and a few rmagistrates a&ninister justice to its dense population. How much ignorance, imexperience, and natural incapacity may add to the evils caused by the smallne6s of their numbers may be easily conceived. The police are inefficient and corrupt, bribery and false evidence abound in the courts, oppression and extortion are continually practised with impunity. The testimony to these things is too constant to admit of a doubt that it is founded on truth. Why, then, should the Missionaries not proclaim these evils and demand an inquiry? Simply, we would say, because the evils are known and require no inquiry, and that the remedies indicated by the Missionaries are by no means as effective as those which the Government is at last engaged in applying. The defects in the administration of justice and the system of police evidently arise from the government of a vast country being thrown into the hands of a few thousand Europeans. Every year the empire has been extended, while the number of Englishmen available for civil appointments has not correspondingly increased. So far from European tyranny being the bane of India it is proved that the presence of Europeans in sufficient numbers gives the only guarantee for common right and justice. All these mattera have been and are under the consideration of the Indian and Home Governments. Bills are before the Legislative Council of India for the improvement of the judicial administration, and we may expect that a stricter supervision of the proceedings of the Zemindars and an organized system of protecion for the Ryots wil not be long in following. However, we are not among those who believe that rules and regulations can of themselves cure inveterate evils. The life of a people will be generally but the reflection of its material and scmial condition, and, as long as the country is poor and its inhabitants as helplmes as the Bengalees, there will be petty tyranny on the one hand and bitter discontent concealed by a mask of servility on the other. To material improvements we look for the elevation of the Bengalee's condition; and, to do the Government justice, there has been no lack of encouragement to enterprise. When roads and railways and works of irrigation increase in number, when the produce of those rich plains can be brought to the beat market within 1,000 miles, when, consequently, land becomes valuable, and European enterprise, by that time, we trust, freed from all legal obstacles, shall have found in India a new and unworked field, then the world may hope for the contentment and prosperity of the Bengalee. Till then we fear no decisions of Parliament or Leadenhall-street, no devotion of philanthropists, no mutterings of the sufferers, will work a cure. We have all through gone on the supposition that the Missionaries and their spokesman represent the feelings of the Hindoos, and are trusted by the race whose cause they are pleading. But the fact is, that no set of men are viewed with deeper distrust by the native population than the indefatigable preachers who are now demandiBg justice for the Bengalee. More than one novelist has caricatured the humanitarian who endeavours to benefit the object of his sympathy by persuading him that he is the vilest and most abandoned of mankind. This iB the tone of the Bengal Missionaries . " Your petitioners," they say, " have reason to believe that there is a " vast amount of social disorganization and of conI'sequent sisfering in the whole country. Much "of this your petitioners can trace to the fearful "supersniiions of the people, to their ignorance, ana "to the. debasiug effects of a popular mythology " which presents examples of every vice, and w1hah " ascrSbes sanctity and Divine honour to a piest" hoed which is the 1rincipal curse of Ieia." Hindoo nature must be widely different from any oi6er it such language as this be not sufficient ba counterbalance all assurances of sym-pathy and friendship. We may trace in these ftw lines the spirit in which Missionary approacbes have been made to the native mind, and can hAardly wonder that after years of exertion P.nd an expense almost incredible so few convOrsions have been effected.
In answer to a question from MIr. G. Du,D.As last night, Sir TBEznTAmj HAU explained to the House, tQ+t hf. had mjynd instnictions from the Government to prepare plan for the enlarment of the accommodation at St. James's Palacew; r. DuIDAS had described the painful scenr of confusion which occurred on this day week at the Drawing-room, when the QUBEN received at St. James's Palace the 'wives, and sisters, and daughters of the noblest and principal persons in the land. These ladies had aasembled there for the purpose of showing respect to their SOVER=GN, and it is but simple justice to the QurEE to say that never was there a Sovereign more ready at all times to acknowledge the loyalty and devotion of her sabjects. The honour of appearing in the presence of Royalty has ever been esteemed a privilege in these k3ingdoms, and it will be a great misfortune for the country if this opinion should ever be modified ia any considerable degree. This honour, however, under existing arrangements is attended with considerable drawbacks. On Saturday last, for instance, the humblest person in the land need not have envied the condition of any of those ladies who might have been seen in their brilliant apparel passing along the streets on their way to the Court of the Queen of E-GLAND. The day was intensely hot. It was weather suggestive of rustic idleness and cool shades. The hour, however, arrived when the carriages were to "set down" their fair occapants at the door of St. James's Palace, and the ceremony began. As the crowd thickened confusion arose. The apartments are so ill arranged that only a very few persons at a time should be permitted to pass along, but the stream of courtiers flowed on without intermission. Whenthis had continuedcfor a certain period embarrassment, which by degrees became pressure, commenced in the rear, and gradually extended along the whole column. We are told that many ladies only contrived at length to reach the chamber in which their SOVEREIGN was waiting to receive them in a halffainting condition, and with the dresses which had been for weeks their anious thought in woful disarray. After the few seconds had elapsed during which the usual ceremonies were performed, they had to recommence the struggle. As they had fought their way in, so they were compelled to fght their way out. The necessary effort would at such a season have been a sharp tax upon the strength of strong men ;-what must it have been to ladies who were probably for the ftst time in their lives exposed to such an ordeal T Now, why should all this be? If it be said that the difficulty is one of locality, we say that in that case some other building ought to be selected for the purpose of holding these Royal receptions. There is no peculiar superstition which exclusively consecrates that mean old brick barrack which is called St. James's Palace to purposes such as these. We gather, however, from the expressions used by Sir BBNJxANx HAL last night in his answer to Mr. DuNDAs, that the intention is to re-arrange the apartments at St. James's, and not to shift the locality of the " Drawing-rooms." He tells us that the State apartments were sufficiently ample many years ago, when probably but 200 or 300 persons assembled to pay their respects to the Sovereign, but now more than 1,000 ladies habitually attend the Drawing-rooms. What is the obvious inference? It may well be-for we do not presume to dictate upon such a pointthat, as matters stand at present, it might be an inconvenience to the QUEEN to hold her Drawingrooms at the place of her own immediate residence. If this be so, at least let the apartments at St. Jamee's Palace be so arranged that ladies who desire to offer their homage to their SOVERuIGN may do so without incurring the certainty of grievous discomfort, and the risk of serious injury. We do not pretend to do more than offer random suggestions when we say that if the ladies attending the QUENs Coturt were received by proper officials in a large and convenient reception-room on their arrival-if but few at a time, according to the order of their arrival, were allowed to pass on-and if a totally distinct exit were provided, so that there should be no conflict of meeting streams, there would be but little danger of a renewal of the disgraceful scenes of last Saturday. Surely, if 8,000 persons -men and women mixed-can be gathered together in the Concert-room at the Surrey Gardens without accidents or the fear of them, and if these 8,000 persons can in ten minutes be discharged from the building with the most perfect comfort to theinselves, the CH BERLAIN and his asistants might in a well-arranged building manage the admisssion of a few hundred ladies to the presence of their SovBERxGx without expposing them to such unbounded uneasiness. This evil is so manifestly within control that it should not be permitted to continue for an hour after its existence has been established. We are very confident there Will be no disinclination on the part of the House of Commons-and certainly none on the part of the public-to allot any sum which in reason may be required for the purpose of rendering access to the presence of the SovRBnmo2N more agreeable to the ladies who desire to be presented at her Court. These public receptions are part of the public arrangements of the country. Englishmen have never shown any undue parsimony whenever any question has been raised of such changes as might add dignity to the CRowN or lustre to the Court. It is a miserable result of all our expenditure when we hear of such a reception as that of Saturday last. Yonder wretched brick buildingthat crowd of struggling, tattered ladies-that discomfort and crash, must either be very materially improved, or Him MAJxSrv must be humbly requested to hold her next Drawing-room in Buckingham Palace.

THz.1 HA&u is m FR1 cE.-Thi crops everywhere present themselves under exceptional conditions, and cause universal satisfaction. In Flanders, Picardy, the Beauce, the Btie, Bbgundy, and the Orleanais, wheat, rye,. and barley promise a considerable produce. In the south, where-the crops-wereso.very indifferent last year, an abundant harveaqis- epeoted From Lyons, as far as Termeon, and from Nistnes to Bayonne, the wheat-fieldslook universaUy fine, and already begin to show a. yellow tinge; Bhrley haw been already cut near Ag non, and in the neighbourbood of Montpeliier preparations. are being made for cutting the rye. The corn cropg in the-centraljdlitricte, of France have also a magnificent ppearance. In moot of the localities of Auvergne and the - veiay tho wheat, although not yet in ear, is very fine. The ryeis every-where well dtvloped. The crops which growon the- mountais of the- lozro and the Aveyronar.- almost as- high as- thse on the volcanio soils of Auvergne or of-the Vivarais. las the western region it is expected. that the-barvest wil. be more abundant than that of last year. In La. Vend&e. Brittany, Anjou, Poitou, ansd. the linonsin the wheat and rye have an unusually rich appeaDnoe. tD the prewenttime none is to be seen beaten down. The-other crops in, that vicinity also hold out themost favourable prospect. In the valleys of the Rhione,. the :ltre,.the Loire, and the Garonne, the potatoes, beans, and peas are admirable, and the same may said of the crops of maizein Rtovenee, Languedoc, the Beam, and Gasony. The -vinee, it Is now- certain, have snffered but little fronm the cold which prevailed in May. In the aconnais, LInguedoc, Bordelais, Saintonge, and the Orleanais, every one agrees-in saying that the vintage will be good. It is true that the.oidininihas-again showsn itself in some vineyards in. the soutlrg but'its-progress.is checked by the ute of sulphur, the application ofwbichhis-noiw very eas in oonsequence oE the invention of a, new apparatus for the purpose.

Thanks to- the-raiL which has fallen during the last fortnight~ in Berry,. the Nivernoi* &c., the puture - grounds are moot-verdant, and afford abundant nouriBhment - to the cattle, In-a word, the ceorn crops, from their gre#a . extent and their prosperous-appearance, promise this year. to France almost a sufficient sup ly for her consumption.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (yl O-UR OWN VCOBESPONIENrT.) Th following appo=ed in our seownd cditlou of yea- -. -1 rA.UW, THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 6 p.m. I alluded yesterday to the statement put forth about a coalition, for the purposes of the preeent election, between certain members of the Orleanist party and the Republicans. It is right to qualify or explain that statement. Betwreen the recognized leaders of the Orleanists and the Republicans there has been no alliance, and, whatever be the understanding that exists, it does not go beyond their two respective organs, the Si&ck and the Dgbats. The Duchess of Orleans not only has given no sanction to a " coalition," but she is completely ignorant of it; and the Princes of the family are precisely in the same situation. TheDuchess,vwhol believe isnow in Germany, is on the point of proceeding to England to visit her brothers-in-law, and very probably to express her satisfaction at the manner mn which they have extinguished the "$fusion." A coalition -with any section of the Republican party is disclaimed by those who have a title to speak in the name of the Orleanist party. The understanding with the D.'bats came about somewhat in this manner :-It appears that the list of Opposition candidates which, after some exertion and difficulty, was adopted, contained a few names which it was suggested would rather startle the worthy eitizens of Paris. These names were, I suppose, a sop thrown out to the Faubourgs, whose favourites are Barbes, Pyat, Hugo, and the like. For instance, M. Darimon is or was a Socialist of the Prudhon school, and was the friend, dieciple, and coadjutor of that clever but most dangerous sophist. Then again M. Emile Ollivier was of a sbade in politics nearly as dark. M. Carnot's name is associsted with the famous circulars to the Republican Commissaries; and the honesty of General Cavaignae is not sufficient to counterbalance the hatred felt against him by numbers of the working classes since the sweeping-down with grape in the June insurrection, and the arrest and transportation of thousands on the same occasion without form of trial or legal judgment. In a word, the extremities to which the General was reduced for the safety of Paris and of France, and which won for him the favour and gratitude of men of order of every party, are the same which make his name still execrated among the incurable Revolutionists. The two or three Red or Socialist names wbich adorned, or disfigured, the list were felt to be inconvenient, and likely to damage the cause. The list was, I am told, communicated to the D6bats, which was asked for its support. The Orleanist organ rather winced; and, in order to secure its co-operation, it was offered to insert in it names of its own party. Its assistance was probably asked in case the Republican list was inperilled; in fact, as an en cas. The D6bats appears to have accepted the offer, and it is said suggested the names of MM. de Remusat, Villemain, and Vavin. M. de Remusat not being in Paris, his sons were applied to; and they, before giving any answer, thought proper to consult one whose years, long experience, and admitted talents justly give him great influence. The advice was, that the offer should be at once declined, from the utter impossibility of a community of sentiment or action between the friends of constitutional monarchy and those who overthrew it. The advice was followed, and the MM. de Remusat refused to help the Republican candidates. M. Villemain, who likes well enough the quiet opposition of the Academy to arbitrary power, but whose temper, tastes, and years unfit him for a more tumultuous theatre, also declined the tempting proposal. M. Vavin, a retired notary, who served in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Legislative Assembly, by whom he was appointed liquidator of the Civil List of Louis Philippe, accepted the offer. Some of his old political friends appear dissatisfied, though, perhaps, unreasonably, with his doing so, and they attribute it to his characteristic indecision. As to his probity, private and political, all are unanimous. It may be some excuse for M. Vavin that it is difficult to resist the temptation of opposing the celebrated Dr. Veron in the eighth arrondissement. Dr.Veron is a man of selfimportance, so large and swollenin his opinion of himself,so ready to encumber with officious patronage all who do not want it, and so vulnerable from his very ponderosity, that people, out of the mere love of sport, are incited to oppose him. I cannot say that NL. Vavin is influenced by any such motives, but I believe that, though Dr. Veron is byno means an unkind or ungenerous man, there is something so amusing in a controversy with him, that most people are pleased he should encounter an opponent. Of the Debats' direct contribution to the Republican list M. de Laboulaye? one of its editors, is the only one who stands forth m the columns of the Side as associated with M. Darimon, M. Emnile Ollivier and M. Carnot. I have heard doubts expresaed as to whether A. de Laboulaye will remain, and whether he will not be withdrawn to maake room for M. Havin, the principal editor of the Siec7e, and a member of various Legislative Chambers of 25 years' standing. There is, then, no alliance between the chiefs of the Orleanist party, properly so called, and the Republicans; the alliance, if such it can be called, is between the Sidel and the Dgbats. Btit there is no reason why this should not be so. There are times when parties must waive their perhaps mistaken notions of dignity or consistency, and, when the question is not one of a choice of government, it would be carrying the point of honour too "ar torefuse its co-operation to its old enemies, t.ien at the risk of being thought to play a subordinate part. But the succes of the list put forth by the SidZe is exposed, I fear, to considerable peril on the part of the Republicans themselves, an influential, and justly influential, section of whom object to tbe names comprised in it. I am told that a protest has been made against it on the part of certain leaders, who consider that they have quite as valid a claim on the electors of Paris as several of those who are adopted by the Si&ie. In a word, the question is not settled, and the Government is likely to be assisted not more by the exertions of its own friends than by the want of unanimity in its adversaries. The Presse announces that M. Havin, of the Siecle, is not a candidate for either the second or third electoral divisions of Paris, General Cavaignac having consented to stand for the third division, where he was formerly elected. M. Havin refused the second division. The Presse adds that M. Emile Ollivier applied to-day at the office of the Imperial Attorney to deposit his bulletin as a candidate for the fourth division, and not for the seventh, as erroneously stated. M. Darimon presented himself to-day to deposit his bulletin for the seventh division. M. Haussman, Prefect of the Seine, and M. Pietri, Prefect of Police, are both raised to the dignity of Senators} with all the honours, emolumnents, and embroideries thereunto appertaining. The measure is principally adopted, it is said, with a view to put an end in some measure to the squabbles eternally breaking out between the Senators and the public functionaries, and rules of precedence are quite as closely regarded in this soi-diant democratic country as in tlhe aristocratic empire of His Majesty Faustin I. The pair of Prefects being thus " pitchforked" by the Emperor into the upper salle of the Luxembourg, he hopes to have peace for some time. The following private telegraphic despatch has been received " BOLOGNA, Juxu 10. "The Sovereign Pontiff arrived yesterday.

The subjoined autograph letter of the Emperor to the Governor-General of Hmgar7y announcing the postponement of his tour inHEungary appeared in the official Buda-PestA aette of yesterday : "To m LmABrrAxT s oF THZ Krnoomi oF HuNGAnY. H EIis Imperial Royal Apostolio Majesty has been pleased to address the following autograph letter to me:- " ' Dear Cousin Archduke Aebrerch,-It haspleased the Almighty to put a sudden and painful end to my journoy. Although greatly cast down by such a severe 1r, I subrait with Christian resignation to the dispensation of Divine Providence. The grief occasioned by mn great lo interrupted a tour which was commenced unler the most agreeable impressions, and during which the inhabitants of the principal towns and of the country places gave us so many striking proofs of affection and attachment. They were the witnesses of our afdiction, and we shall never forget the sympathy which they displayed. Give to them most hew' t in my name and in that of the Empress, and tell them that, fuathful to my purpose, I will as soon aspossible (&ildmoglic1W) return to visit those districts which I am unable to go to now. "' To you, my well-beloved, I can only express my acknowledgment of the eircumspection and activity with whioh you unite the command of my faithful third army with the ceaseless endeavour3to provide according to my wishes for the future well-being of the country intrusted to your care. "' RANCIS JOSEPH. " Laxenburg, June 3, 1857. ' "The kind language of our most gracious Monarch is, doubtless, the beet possible reward for all those who exerted themselves to givo a festive and joyful reception to their beloved Majesties. The grief of the Imperial parents for the loss of their dear child is shared by each separate individual-is shared by the whole land. With the most heartfelt gratitude, therefore, every loyal inhabitant of this country will hail the well-founded hope of seeing at no distant period his Lord and Emperor recommenoe a journey so benefioial for Hungary. May we always sucoeed in deserving the content and favour of our beloved Monarch ! " Archduke ALBRECHT. " Buda, June 6, 1857." For the moment I cannot give you any positive information as to what is meant by the phrases " as soon as possible," and " at no distaut period," there being a great diversity of opinion on the subject in the best-informed circles. More than one official personage has assured me that the journey of "the Emperor" is not likely to be resumed until the fall of the year, but a person who from his position is likely to be well acquainted with the intended movements of the Court this morning stated in my presence that 4"their Majesties intended to return to Hungary on or about the 24th inst." It attracts general observation that His Majesty has made mention of his third army in his letter to the Archduke Albrecht. Such a singular mixing up of family and military matters has led to remarks so uncharitable that they cannot be repeated. On the 6th the Agricultural Exhibition at Peath was opened by the Archduke Governor-Gene. ral, who was attended by a brilliant military suite. According to the Hungarian papers, the Exhibition is not very much inferior to that which we had here a month since; but non-Hungarians who have seen it are of opinion that the negative particle ought to be omitted. Schools in which young agriculturiets will be taught how to plant, cultivate, and improve woods and forests, are about to be established in Hungary, where they are greatly needed. Hungary contains 7,700,700 joch (acres) of forest land, but the landed proprietore have always terribly "r i-treated" their woods. Whenever money has been scarce timber has been cut at random, and the natural consequence of such a sad want of system is, that some of the forests are I too thickly and others too thinly planted. As the Hungarians have never troubled themselves to plant saplings after having felled their magnificent trees, a great part of the Carpathians is already without forests. A correspondent of the Pesth Lloyd writes that on heights which within the memory of man were thickly covered with the oak, beech, and pine, nothing is now to be seen but stunted shrubs, blackberry bushes, and heath, The private accounts from Verona relative to the state of Marshal Radetzly's health are by no means favourable. The wounds which have been produced by his continually resting on the same parts of his body are very painful, and deprive him of sleep. During the last day or two the heat hau been very great here, and the thermometer now shows 83.75 in the shade. Yesterday was St. Medard, and as no rain fell the weatherwise people in this city affirm that the summer wil be very hot and dry SARDINA. (PoRM ous oWN coR sRPoWDNTr.) TURIN, JUNx 8. A telegraphic despatch received here this morning announces that the Macon and Geneva Railway was opened yesterday as far as Culoz from the former town. This at length completes the railway communication from Paris to the Sardinian frontier, and reduces the time necessary for a journey from the capital of France to that of Sardinia to about 30hours under favourable circumstances. FromCuloz to Aix-les-Bains the service for the present must be performed by steamboats, as the bridge over the Rhone and other heavy works on that line cannot be finished for some time to come, but this transit down the Lao de Bouget wil be made in a couple of hours, and it has been arranged that, in order to save time, the visit of the Sardinian Custom-house officers shal, as far as possible, take place during the voyage. From Aix to St. Jeau de Maurienne the trains will run in correspondence with those of the French railways, so that 16 hours will suffice from Paris to the foot of the Alps * but from St. Jean to Susa is a journey of 12 Aours over Mont Cenis, and this great obstacle to more rapidcommunication between the north and the south of Europe seems likely to remain for many years still. The Sardinian Goverlmment hasdetermined on attacking boldly the gigantic barrier; and, as people born surrounded with peculiar difficulties are generally gifted with attributes the best adapted for obviating them, it may be expected the Piedmontese will display more than ordinary aptitude in boring through the massive bulwarks that hedge in their country on three sides. They have already been successful in cutting through the Appennines, under the direction of a Belgian engineer-the Chevalier Mans; and it now remains for them to overcome the greater opponent of the Cottian Alps. On the 14th of last month Count Cavour presented to the Chamber of Deputies a bill, which he aescribed as the most imteresting for the country that he had ever brought before the House. That the Chamber entertain the same idea of its importance may be deduced from the fact that the ommision appointed to examine it has not yet made its report, nor is it likely to do no for the next few days The bill was a project for sanctioning a new convention between the Govermnent and the Victor Emmanuel (Savoy) Railway Company, or Company Laffitte, by which the latter should be enabled to hold a great line of railway from Culoz to the Lombard frontier at Buffalora, near Novara. For that purpose a fusion of the Victor Emmanuel, Turin and Suaa, and Turin amd Novara Railway Companies was neces- sary, as well as a solution of the Mont Cenis difficulty. By virtue of a law of 1856, the Company Laffitte was already possessed of half the shares of the Turin and Susa Railway, and might undertake the working of the line whenever it might be agreed upon, and the same law sanctioned the fusion of the Turin and Novara Railway. The Novara Railway already yielded an Interest of 8 per cent., and the shares of 500f. were quoted at 700f. to 720f. The Savoy Rallway has only as yet returned about 3 per cent. The Laffitte Company therefore offered the shareholders of the Novara line 760!. per shae, or two shares of 250f. each in the Savoy Railway and 120f. in cash, for every share in the.Novara line; and of 32,000 shares it is said the holders of 24,000 have elected to sell at 760f. The Government had guaranteed in its first con- vention with the Laffitte Corapany an interest of 4* per cent. on the Savoy Railway, and by the new convention it is proposed to extend this guarntee to the whole line, and even to guaratee the interest on the Novara Railway shares, calculating them at 760f. each, which will be equal to 6i per cenLt. on the original value. The Government argues that this guarantee will never be called for, as the Novara Railway already gives 8 per cent., and will certainly aive 10 or 12 when the junction with the Lombard defilway is effected, which wiUl more than cover the defciency of the Savoy Railway. There remains, then, the great question of boring Mont Cenis. A tunnel of 12,400 metres, without a single shaft, is the magnificent project broug,ht forward. The estimated expenditure for this tremendous undertaking in 41,000,000 francs, and the time required for its completion seven years. The Laffitte Company agrees to contribute 21,000,000f. towardn the work; its payments to commence after 2 kilometres have been excavated at each end, so that, accordingtothese caloulations, the demand on the country will only amount to about 3,000,000f. a-year for seven years. The means proposed to be employed beyond those already in use for such works are a boring machine worked by compreased air, the history of which I believe to be as follows :- In searching for some more economical way than by locomotives of working the Giove incline through the Appennines on the Turin and GenoaRailway, three Piedmontese engineers, Messrs. Lomellier, Grattoni, and Grandis, suggested the application of an atmospheric power obtained by air compresed by water, of which there was great abundance in the neighbourhood, and obtained a grant of 90,000f. from Government to make experiments, on condition of repayment if they should not ba succenful. Nothing has bean done as yet, however, towarda giving this idea a practical form.
A USTRALI.A. (]MOM 0tJ oWN CORRrPIDElT.) NXTE OURNE, AIrm 14. Before you can receive this letter you will have learnt the disaster which the Oneida suffered in Febraary lat* soon after she left King George's Sound. From what I learnt of the derangement of her machinery in her paag out I had some miSgivings as to her voyage home, and in consequence I sent an account of her outward voyage in duplicate. Unfortunately, after her accident she ws two days too bte to meet the Sima at King Georgeas Sound, so that her mail will not reach England until May. It Is not necessary that I should give an account of the Oneida's mis bap, as the whole particulas will reach you by the European. Itwill deprive us of the February mail until next month, and will also delay the arrival of the March naii; but I believe steps wM be taken to supply another vessel to sail from Melbourne with our May mail, so that the great inconvenience to our merchants will be obviated as speedily as possible. Of the seven responsible officers who form the Ministry four only have as yet obtained seats in the Assembly The members returned are O'Shanays (Kilmore), Foster (Williamstown), Horne (Warnamboul), Duff. (Villiers). Wood, the Solicitor-General, is now courting tna' surages of the people of the Ovens (Bcechworth), with every prospect of success. The elecion is to-day. If h - be returned, O'Shnnassy will meet Parliament with five of his Cabinet in the House. The constitution is satisfied if four at least out of the seven designated responsible officers have seats in either House. Some people ara beginning to cast doubts on the applicability of re ,ponsible government to small political communities 3ike these. They say it may be well -for Canada, with its 2,000,000 of people, where the population is bound to the soil, and its institutions formed, but it is not fit for a community of some 400,000 people, half of whom only consider themselve3 encamped rather than settled, and they refer to the early throes of responsible Minis. tries in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. But there is nothing in the nature of our recent Ministeria change which has not often happened in England, and certainly nothing to show that whether O'Shanassy or Haines be at the head, the Government (aided by popular opinion) will not be efficiently carried on. I think, moreover, we have a very good constitutional Governor in Barkly. I am very sure he thoroughly understands the system of whioa he is a constituent element. He is vigilant in the extreme. He exercises a very wholesome iniluence by never interfering with the determinations of his constitutiona advisers, and yet by the intelligence of his suggestions he i, said to have great influence and weight. His manners arin gentle, and there Is almost a sleepiness in his demeanour 'when action is not called for; but he is remarkably clear. headed, of sound memory, and I am much mistaken if his firmness when constitutionally called into action will not b far superior than those who set up for firmness. HJ did not come in as a popular Governor as poo Hotham did, but his popularity is steadily growing, and I think he will keep it. If any constitutional conflict or difliculty should arise, I know of no Governor in all these colonies so likely to steer successfully through it as Sir H Barkly. Next to him I venture to rank Governor Denison who has certainly worked the new principle well, in splte of the apparent violence it did to his former habits under the old system. In spite of the difficulties which changes of Government necessarily introduce where several of the re. sponsible officers are necessarily without much, and som, without any experience, I continue to have implicit faith in the new system. I am sorry to say there is a good deal of depression in commercial affairs. Many descriptions of goods have been importd in excess of the immediate demand, and there is a general indisposition among the dealers to increase their stocks. This, of course, embarrsses the importers. The Customs' dutles show a considerable increase for the year ending March 31, 1857, as compared with the year ending March 31, 1856, the former amounts being 1,629,0851. the latter 1,419,5721. This is satisfactory, so far as revenue is concerned, but I fear it discloses an element of com. mercial depression of which we have yet to see the full result. I hope my timely hints will have checked the dis position to consign 'which has proved so injurious to the regular importer. The production nnd export of gold, however, which s generally accepted here as a thermometer of our prosperity, stil keep fully up to the average. The quantity by escor; for the first three months of the year was 577,338 ounces, and the quantity exported 719,631 ounces, vain 2,878,5241. This is the Argus' account. Kuhll's statement of the export exceeds 3,000 0001. In spite of mRercantile depression there is a good deal of unemployed money capital seeking investment in other than mercantile hands. The consequence is that securitieI are advancing and interest declining. Colonial Bank o- Australasia shares, which a fewv months sinoe were at a dis count, are at 13 to 10 premium. Gas shares are at 2 premium. Government securities scarcely yied 5 per cent. interest.
THE INDIAN DISAPFPCTIoy. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You have just "hit the right nail on the head" in your admirable leader of yesterday the 10th), on the disaffection in the native Indian army. With all du resrect to my Lord Ellenborough's talents, every old India X wil tell you he is very little authority on the state o Hindoo society and their feelings towards us, more espe cially in a case where the blame so evidently lies with hi, own pet military service. Several years' experience gathered in India in the chief stronghold of old Hindoo society -Benares, the Oxford of India-during which I was in constant intercourse with all classes of the natives has convinced me that, far from their having any feelings of bitternees towards the Company's Government on account of their supposed interference with their religious opinions and customs, their chief source of wonder is that so just and enlightened a body cau be so indifferent, not to Bay opposed, to the spread of their own religion as not, by the r own confession, to allow Christianity even fair play. For. independently of the connexion of the Indian Government with many of the Ilindoo and Mahommedan temples aui religious institutions-which the natives accept as so mu&A homage to their own deities-I can assure you that the only hook of authority on any religion which is systematically excluded (even in the form of extracts) from the Goverament colleges and chools is the Holy Bible; in fact, I have frequently been applied to by intelligent native yoatha respecting the meanng of pasesages in the Holy Scriptures which the nmsters in their own institutions had refased he explain to them. Away, then, with the false shame and squeamishness about " offending the religions prejudices'' of the HIindoos-a charge which is, and must be, constantly applicable to us as long as wve choose to retain the reins or government in ourown hands. hylgfrmbhelief is that the pre-. sentdisaffection in our native Indianarmyarlses mainlyfrom the two causes to which you have referred-viz, first, the collision which was inevitable between the old effete system of priestcraft, bigotry, and ignorance represented by Brahniism-in fact, the ultra-Toryism of the old lindo zealot ; and,'secondly, from the low tone, not only of morals and education, but of sympathy and of a sense of duty to. vards the non-commissioned ofcers and sepoys which prevails among the majority of the offlicers, especially the regimental officers, of our native Indian force. This, I have no doubt, wll be scouted as a base calumny on an honourable profession. It may be, butforall that it is the simple truth that, with many noblo exceptions, the great mass of our native Indian regiments abound with an idle, dissolute, extravagant, gambling, brandy-ptni-drinking set of young, aye I and old men, too, whose sole object in ife seems to be the indulgence of the lowest and most selfish dispositions and habita. What may be the style of education which prevails at Addiscombe and Sandhurat I know not, but I fear the discipline is exceedingly lax, from the apecimiensI have seen turned out from both thoso instltutions. It was principally to this that the late Sir Charts Nlapier owed a*great portion of his unpopulanit ,-vin, hl effort to cleanse the ugean, stables of 6he Indian mesh room of its vile accesuosnoss.

MONABY-lARKTarndWrTYINT?BLU&BzN(JEB Friday Evening. The funds have been firm to-day at the improvement which occurred last evening after regular hours. Consols for the 9th of July have stood at 931 to i, ex. dividend. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214, Reduced, 92a to -l; New Three per Cents., 921 to * and India Bonds, 8s. to 3s. discount. Exchequer-tills wvera heavy in consequence of an increase in the dem=Ld for money, and the knowleage that only a small amount of the June bills has been sent in to be paid off and withdrawn from the market. In the Stock-Exchange, as well as in the discountmarket and at the Bank of England, there was a considerable pressure for money throughout the day, 6; per cent. being the lowest rate. Foreign securities are well supported, and in some cases there has been a further slight improve. ment. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were negotiated at 96, 951, and 96 - and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 101 and i; Brazilian Five per Cents., 1O2; the Five per Cents., 1829 and 1839, 100I; 1843, 1O0i; Danish Three per Cents., 1825, 85 and 85g.; Peruvian Four-and-a-.Half per Cents., for account, 76; Portuguese Three per Cents., 46k; Russian Five per Cents., 109k and - Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 42j and the New Deferred, for account, 25i, i, aud Apanih Certificates of Coupon not funded, 6; ;Belgian Four-and-a.Half per Cents., 9&i; Dutch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 65i; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 97i. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates for Hamburg and Paris were a shade higher, but Amsterdam remained the same as last post. The corn-market was firm this morning at the rates of Monday. The report of the liverpool cotton-market for the week shows an active demand, and a tendency to higher prices. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 40c. for money and 68f.-65c. for the end of the month, showing an improvement of a half per cent. A further sum of about 32,0001. in Australian gold was sold to the Bank to-day, raising the total of AustraLian gold taken there during the week to 355,0001. The monthly return of the Bank of France, published this morning, produced a very favourable effect. The advices received a few days back as to the extent of the increase in the stock of bullion are fully confirmed, and the total now held is 131,400,0001., showing an augmentation during the month of 2,056,0001. At the same time the position of the establishment has been improved by a contraction of 554,0001. in the note circulation. The Government balance has increased 1,280,0001.,while in the deposits of the public there is a diminution of 160,000!. The discounts show a decrease of 1,338,0001.,aud the prospect of alowering of the rate is proportionately strengthened. The advances on Rentes and shares have experienced a further reduction of 210,0001., and the whole of the latter do not exceed 700,0001. The amount of premiums paid for the purchase of gold has been large. Last month it was only 10,0001., and on the present occasion it is 17,0001. About a miUion and a half of the increase in the stock held may therefore be attributed to artificial operations. These, however, are of no real importance, since they merely anticipate by two or three weeks the influx that would otherwise take place from natural causes. The Bank pay a heavy price for the temporary advantage, but, having once entered upon the syatem, they cannot discontinue it while the exchanges are in their present state, without the risk of their returns presenting suddenly an unfavourable appearance, aad thus causing discouragement to the speculators. The new law for the constitution of the Bank of France has been officiaUy published, and agrees in a0l material respects with the accounts already given of it. The period at which the additional 4,000,0001. of capital is to be paid up remains to be fixed by the Bank, but it must take place before the end of 1859, as during that year the whole amount is to be advanced to Government on an issue of Rentes. The prohibition against an increase of the rate of discount beyond 6 per cent., which has hampered the Bank in every period of trial, and forced it to resort to objectionable expedients, is removed, and any profits which may arise from the charge being raised beyond that rate are to be applied to the reserve fund. Finally, an issue is authorized of notes of 50f. (21. each). Hlitherto the lowest denomination has been 100f. Whether this authority will be acted on at once is not known, but it seems to be expected that such wil be the case. The result would be the liberation of a large amount of gold, which would produce a strong effect upon prices. No extra danger, however, would necessarily arise to the stability of the Bank, provided its general management were sound, except at periods of political panic, when the possibility would have to be apprehended of a general rush. At such periods however, a resort to temporary suspension is regarded as a legitimate remedy. It is stated that the liabilities of Messrs. Gotch and Sons, the Kettering bankers, whose failure was announced on Wednesday, are estimated at about 140,0001.; and that it is expected the estate wiU show sufficient to pay 13S or 14s. in the pound. A committee of creditors has been appointed, and Messrs. Harding and Pullein are preparing a statement and investigating the causes of the suspension prior to a general meetincg of depositors and customers. In the colonial produce-markets during the week there has been considerable activity, particularly as regards sugar, in which extensive operations have taken place at a rise of fully Is. per cwt. The transactions have comprised large quantities on the spot, as well as several floating cargoes For coffee also there continues a good demand; the Ceylon kinds on the spot have been taken at high quotations, as well as six floating cargoes of Rio for near ports. In rice there is little auimation, and some sales have been made on rather lower terms. Cocoa ma;ntains the late advanced rates. Saltpetre is saleable only at a reduction. The next quarterly sales of indigo are declared for the 14th of July, and at present 8,600 chests are advertisedi. In thle tea-market much excitement has prevailed. A deeided advance in prices has been demanded for most descriptions, and in some instances has been obtained. Public sales of about 40,000 packages have commenced to-dlay, and will be resumed on Monday. At the half-yearly meeting of the Commercial Dock Company, held to-day, Mr. Nathaniel Gould in the chair, the accounts were submitted for the six months ending December last, and a dividend was declared at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum free of income-tax. The report stated that the sale of Barnard's-yard to the Govermuent for 20,0001. has been completed, that the business of the docks continues to be well maintained, and that aU the premises are in efficient working order. The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 6th of June gives the following results when compared with the previous week - Pubic depodits ... ... .. 7,036,869 ... Incrae 2772,450 OtMer depoint ... ... 9,796,386 ...

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I hope that you will, as an act of jutstice, aDow me space to notice what I believe to be an error in the report of Oxford inteligence in your impression of this day. In statirg the rejectmn of the Craven Statute you say, "The maitn objection (as we gathered) being to the ssignment of three scholarships tso physical science." of this was gathered I cannot, of coutrse, say, the only objection ever publicly stated being that mentioned in your paper of Friday, Mlay 29: "Atter the flrst Statute of the geries which concerned the Craven Scholarshiss. hAd boon read. the Vice-Principal of S5. Mary HaU (Mr ,hasee) rose ard read from a wrirtten document his objection- to the 1s&eme, wi}ch, es ho complaIned, entirely put aside the qualfication of poverty. " The Provost of Ortel (Dr. Hawkitze concurred generally with the view of Mr. Chae, and thought ttat If the conmsmisonors refused to allow the claims ot poverty the Unlver,lty shouid leave the Craven rsatutee unaltered." The " written docunent" referred to was immediately printed, and very widely circulated in Oxford. How an objection entirely different, and never publicly stated, could be " gathered" is to me a mlystery.

COUBr OF BANRRUPTCY, Friday, Junc 12. IN RE HlINRY BUINY. (Before Mr. Commmioner FL)AN InG bankrupt was a solicitor and builder of Newbury. He left this country in November, 1853, taking with him a lnrge amount of property, and leaving behind him debts of large mount. he was afterwards adjudicated bankrupt, prlolaimed an outlaw, and a warrant was sent after him to New Zealand. Mr. Hart, to whom the warrant was intrusted, would appear to have seized all the property. The bank. zupt unsuccessfally resisted Mr. Hart's right in one of the law courts-the Supremo Court of New Zealand; but is now prosecuting an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and he now applied to inspect the pro. ceedings under his bankruptcy. Mr. LAAWANCE, for the absignees, characterized the aprlaliction as most impudent. The bankrnpt on departing, besides taking with him property, had left with certain rumours of misconduct attaching to his name. He had not made restitution to the extent of a shilling. His debts were of large amount, and he was liable at any moraent to be indicted for not surrendering to his bankruptcy. His credi. tors had been merciful in allowing him to prosecute his |pReal, huS there must be a limit to their liberality. I eb rpt lurged that the proceedings in bankruptcy had not been talen until 16 months after his departure for NewZealand. Shouldhesucceedinhis appeal it was his intention to pay all his creditors. The CoasssoNER said he was disinclined to assist the bankrupt, but if the superior court should ask for the proceedings they would be furnished. Application refused accordingly. (Before Mr. Commi.ssioer HIOLROYD.) IN RE EDWARD DUKE MOORE. The bankrupt carried on partnership with Messrs. Evans, Honre, nud Co., under the firm of D. Moore and Co., as concentrated milk cocoa and chocolate manufacturers. Differeaces arose between the partners, and an award was made of 6,000!. against the bankrupt. HIefailingtopay the amount, sand owing considerable sumnsto private creditors, hence the bankruptcy. The unsecured debbs are now 9,4001,, the assets inconsiderable. No objection being raised by Mr. Lawrance for the assignIes, Hi HONOUR granted a llrt-c oasscrtificate.
IMSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, Jun7 12I TV °v lUAQC - - A (Before Ar,. Commiseier Muitrun.) This insolvent, a theatrical costumier, applied for afinal order of protection. Mr. Giffard opposed for the London and North-Westerm Railway Company. Mr. Reid supported. It appeared that in December last the insolvent sent a parcel containing iheatrical dresses to the railway station to be forwarded to Mr. B. Galer, the vocalist, who was then performing at Birmingham. The parcel was not delivered, and the insolvent brought an action, before the trial of which the missing package was discovered in the "left luggage" departmeut. At the trial a witness named Newton, who accompanied the insolvent?s wife to the boolking-offlce, swore that the parcel was ordered to be sent to Birmingham, while a railway porter stated that Mrs. Cantor gave him the parcel, and announcoed her intention of taking it with her to Birmingham on the folowing day. The verdict of the jury was in favour of the Railway Company, who now opposed, upon the ground that their claim of 50. for law costs had been improperly incurred. Mrs. Cantor, who was prevented by illness from attending at the trial, was examined to-day, in addition to the former witnesses, and she sworo distinctly that upon inquiring when the parcel would reach Birmingham she was told "long before Monday." The learned Commissrow2 R was of opinlon that the insolvent had brought the action in good faith, -nd could not he punished for doing so. The reasonable explanation of the contradictory evidence was that there had been a mistake. The final order was granted. IN RE H. R. JIUPP. This insolvent, a compositor, applied to be discharged. He was opposed by Mr. Hawes, an undertaker. M&r. sar. good supported. The insolvent's wife some time since attended the funeral of a relative, and on returning from the cemetery an accident occurred to the mourning coach in which she was seated by which she sastained some injury. The insolvent brought an action against Mr. Hawes, tho undertaker, for damages, on account of the injury sustained by Mr. Jupp, through the alleged negligence of his servant. At the trial the allegation of the driver being Mr. lawes's servant as well as that of negligence were traversed, and the jury ultimately gave a verdict for the defendant, and the insolvent was now in oustody at Mr. Hawes's suit for 341., the amount of his lavr costs. During the examination it was proved that prior to the trial a friend of Mr. Hawes had offered 10 as compensation, but 301. was demanded. The insolvent's wife was confined to her bed for some time in consequence of the accident, and the surgeon's bill was 81. lOs. Mr. Commissioner MLnRpiy said it was a very unfortunate case, but he could not say the insolvent was not justified in bringtng the action. It was to be regretted that Mr. Hawes had had to pay 341. for costs, but the insolvent had also suffered, both through his wife and in his own person. The insolvent was ordered to be diseharged.

APPEALS. IOUSE OF LORDS. JI7NE 12. SMITH V. OSBORNE AND OTHER& This was an appeal from a decision of the Court of CancerY in Ireland, pronounced in a suit whereiu the present respondents were pkintiffs and the appellants and others were defendants. The Attorney-General and Mr. Cairns were counsel for the a lts,a and Mr. G. M. Giffard reprosento the respondents. It appeared that in 1813 a Mr. Richard Boyse Osborne executed a settlement upon the occasion of his mariage. That settlement recited that by the will of his grandfather he was entited to a contingent romainder In the lands of Stonehouse in Waterford, in Ireland. He then went on to bind himself, in the event of his becoming possessed of the estate, to settle it upon certain trusts. Ia 1840 Mr. R. Osborne did become posseased of the lands in question, but through a different chaunel from that recited in the marriage settlemen', and he therefore not considering himslf bound by the settlemnent, had sold the estate for value to the appellant, who had purchased it with notice of the clause inthe marriage settle; ment, Under these circumstances the respondents, the mtiles c aning under the settlement, had instituted a suit the CDourt of Chancery in Ireland praying that the covenant in the settlement should be specifically performed. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland had decreed in favour of the respondents, and the present appeal was brought against that decision. The contention on behalf of the appellants was that ihe interest to which Mr. R-L Osborne was entitled at the time of the settlement, and which he recited in that deed, never accrued, and that his covenant could not be extended to any other interest he might have in the estate. The respondents, on the contrary, submitted that Mr. R. Osborne having represented himself to be eztitled to a contingent remainder in the estate was bound in equity by that representation to apply the estate to the trusts he named, by whatever channel hle became possessed of it. At the conclusion of the argument, The Lonn CHACELOR advised their Lordship. to take time to consider their judgment. Judgment deferred sine die accoardingly.

ROLLS' COIURT, C CERY-LANB J3m 12 AfANDlESON V. ANDERSON.-JTUDGMZNT. (Before the MAST of the ROLLs.) cJu,IlUB D sscae, o W chthe facts were as follows :-The plaintif aud defendant, ahther and son, had carried on a partnership at York, as attorneys, from the year 1848 until the beginning of last year, when, from Bome misunderstanding between them, they ceased to work together. The father then filed a bill in this court for an account of the transaction between his son and himself, and an injunction to restrain the son from practising in the city of York or its immediate neighbourhood. The son thereupon filed a oross bill against his father, praying for a dissolution of the partnership, and objecting to any order being made as to his practising as an attorney where he pleased. The Judgment was given to-day on both bills, the allegations in the cross bill being the chief subjects of consideration. These allegations amounted in substance to the Pon's accusing his father of not giving hira afair rropor tion of the profits, of mixing himself too much up in local newspapers, of attending to his duties as an alderman to the prejudice of his business as an attorney, and generally of treatinghim(theson) norelikeaclerk thanapartner. All of these allegations, except the last, the Court disposed of by holding them immaterial as far as a dissolution of partnership was concerned. With respect to the last of them, however, the Court considered there was so far weight in it that it was quite evident the son was not regarded by the father with the deference and respect due to a partner, but rather was treated by him as a youth whom he mi$ht ord r about as he pleased, and subject to such control as his notions of parental authority might periodically suggest. The differences between father and son were sucx as it was quite impossible ajudicious system of partnership could be carried out under; and there would, therefore, be a general order for a dissolution from the present time, but no order as to the son's practising in York, or any other place he might deem advisable. Cross bill dismissed without costs, and no costs to be given on either side. Mr. It. Palmer, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. Hetherington, and Mrx Stiffe appeared in the case.
VICE-C}A CELLORS' COURTS, JTu 12. IN RfE REEDLEY'S SETTLED ESTATES, 1Before Yice-Ohanacaor Sir P. T. Xnmxslwm l _. .Y -o nix. naugnes appeare(i upon a petition in this matter under the Leases and Settled Estates Act, 19;h and 20th of Victoria, chap. 120. The Petition prayed thatk under the 10th section of the Act, the Court would grant to the trustees of tho Will of a testator who died before the passing of the Act power to grant building leases. The petitioners were successive tenants for life, and their infant children were tenants in tail iu remainder, and a question arose who should be the gurdian to the infant tenants in tail under the act. Mr. Kay appeared for the respondents, a married woman and her husband, entitled in remainder in fee. The VICE-CHANCELLOIS, after considerable discussion, ordered that the respective fathers of the infants should be appointed their guardians to consent on their behalf, and authorizing such consent, and made a distinct order, subsequent in date to the order made upon the petition, authorizing the trustees to lay out certain parts of the lands in question for roads, and giving them the general leasing power prayed by the petition. But this order should not be made until the land which it was proposed to let under the power had been carefully distinguished on a verified Plan, which would be preserved as an exibit in the affidavit office. As to the part of the land which it was proposed to sell, his Honour thought it would be better to make no order on this portion until an offer for purchase of this land had been obtained. (Before Vie- Chancellor Sir J. STUAnT.) soBsoN V. TII; ZARL1 OF DEVOIr. After the motions were disposed of this case was resumed. It is not yet concluded. (Before Vie-ChanaUor Sir W. P. WOOD.) DELARUJE V. DICrINSON. Mr. ROLT, Mr. GROVE, Q.C., Mr. HiNDmABsH, and Mr. FOOICS moved for an attachment against the defendants for breach of the injunction awarded on the 1st of June, restraining them during the eontinuance of the plaintiffs letters patent from using without the leave or lieense of the plaintffs, for the purpose of folding the flaps of envelopes m succession, one after the other, or for the gumming or cementing together the edges of such flaps and causing them to adhere together while being folded, any machines similar to the m^chine produced for inspection at the defendant's manufactory on the 27th of May, 1856, or any machinery, &ac., made or arranged according to the plaustiffts patent in. vention or only colourably differing therefrom or by the substitation of mere mechanical equivalentsfor the same, and from folding the flaps of envelopes in succession, one after the other, and gumming or cementing the edges of such flaps and causing them to adhere together whilo in course of folding, by means of such machine, &c., ana from selling any envelopes heretofore manufactured by the defendants, and in the manufacture whereof any such machine, &c., and has been used for the purpose of folding, &e. (in the terms already specified), and if necessary generally from making, using, or vending plaintifts' patent inventions, or in any way imitating the same. The plaintiffs, who were partners in the firm of Thomas Thomas Delarue and Co., envelope makets and wholesale stationers, and were patentees of certain inventions for improvements in the maanufacture of envelopes, had on the 2d of December, 1856, moved for an injunction to restrain the defendants from continuing to use the envelope machines employed in their business, and known as " Remond's machines," on the ground of infringement of the patents enjoyed by the plaintiffs. Upon the motion for an injunction, the motion was ordered to stand over, with liberty for the plaintiffs to establish their right by action at law, the defendants making certain admissions as to the use of the machines. The action was tried before Lord Campbell in February last, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs in the following terms:-"It is the opinion of the jurythat the fundamental parts of the defendants' machines are imitations of those shown in the machine of Mr. Delarue and that the application of gum as used in the machine of the defendants is a colourable imitation of Mr. Delarue's patent. As such we find our verdict for the plaintiff." Two points of law were reserved to the defendants as to the specifications of the plaintifis. The defen dants moved for a rule for a new trial, and on the 28th of May the Court of Queen's Bench gave judgment, refusing a new trial and deciding that the verdict ought not to be disturbed. Upon the Isr of June the plaintiffs obtained an inlunction against the defendants in the terms already stated. The defendants upon the same day wrote to the plaintiffs stating that since tbe verdict they had completely re-modelled their machinery, so as to obviate any cause of complaint, and offering an inspection. An inspection took place on the 8th of June, andthe patent agents sent down tothemanufactory on behalf of the plaintiffs made their report, in which they stated that the defendants had removed the gumming apparatus formeryused, and alsothe inclined projections (formerly applied to the inside of the plunger), which assisted to arrange and fold the several flaps one on the other, and introduced a short projeotinj air pipe within the plunger to incline tbe pocket flap, but that, In their opinion, the defendants were still us8ig parts of the machinery described in the plaintiffs' specification, and that such parts were new at the date of the patent, and materil to the success of the plaintiffs' invention. This affidavit, whichwas thesubject of much comment by the defendants' counsel, proceeded to specify the technical detail of the action employed by the defendants in the machinery inspectod. The plaiatiffr, uppon receiving this repozt, had served the defendants with notice of motion to commit them for breach of the go'=sere produced in court for the purpose of illut. ltrang the various complicAted proc6BXs of enveloD making, and several envelpea were "turned out" to 4 great admiration of a very crowded court In sanpport of the motion it was contended that the defendants' machinery was substantially the same as that of the plaintiffs, and involvoa the essential part of the patented invention thoug varied in form, andt that the plaintil&s right, which hadbeeni established by verdict and confirmed by the judgment of the Court of Queen's B6nch, which was unappealed from, ought to he effectually secured to them even defendants were not actually committed, -a proceeding for which the pleintiffs did not pe. Mi. CAXRNs, Mr. WnnsrnaE (of theD commona lawb), and MXr. HAwKIs, for the defendants, contended that there had been no violation of the plaintiffis patent since the verdict, still less of the order mae upon the injunction, which wag in strietness confined to the " folding in succession." IMr. Gaovz replied. The V1C-CHAsNCnLP said that, although the motion ws in form to commit the defendants for breach of the inpunction, the real object was to try the substntial merits ox the case. The form of the injunction oocasloned condderable difliculty, being naowly expressed and framed in a very limited manner, considering the disusdon which had taken place upon the action, anL so as not to give the de. fendants fair notice of the particular matter of detail in respect of which the infringement had been makde. He could only postpone the question of costs until the hearing, a-d thus relieve the plaintiffs from the necessity of bearing them in the present instance, by entering somewhit fully into the question of these tents. It was plain upon the specificationa that "fo.ld. ing evef"-viz, a turning over the ends so that the envelope was in a condition of advancing to a condition to be gummed and made complete, was a main point claimed by the plintiff. He should have been very glad if the jury, following Lord Campbell's recommendation, had found the special particulars m which the infringement had been made. (Ehs Honour, after entering into a long and minute investiption of the various arrangements for envelope fold. ing, whiich he charcterized as most ingenious and beautiful, said that there wAs a considerable Pi-im4 fadc case of invaEionl of the tent, though not that which amounted to a brewch of the injunction, and he oould not make the plaintiffs pay the costs of this motion.) The suit had been properly framed for the purpose of asslerting the rights of the phlantifs, nor had either party probably thought that the order would have operatedin this manner. The right course now to take would be to make no order uopon this motion, except to adjourn the question of costs until the hearing of
COURT OF ODBENE EENRsBFNwtjwrwr= -T, io Wings rn Bawo, beforc Lord CA3wBEpxu and Jmid . OLRRpDG, EBRLZ, and CRompToN.) .a rae sitting or tSe Uourt this day, Lord CAsPBXLL delivered the ju. ent of the Court in several cases which had beenspeviot y argued. THE MEROPOLITAN BOARD 'OF WORKS V. THE VAUXIALL BRIDO COMPANY. This was a special case for the opinion of the Court, and which raised two questions for deciion. The first was, whether, by the 95th and 90th section of the Metropolitan Sewers Act, the decisions of the commissioners, if unappealed against within a month, were finol and conclusive ; and, secondly, whether there was any jurisdiction in the commissioners to rate the company in respect of the bridge and other property of the company, as deriving special benefit from the sewers. Lord CAmPBLL now said the Court were of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. The defendants bad not appealed against the rate, nor made may objection agaiu tthe rate within a month from the making thereoS The Court had no power to decide the other questionbat at the request of the parties, who had already inc;&rre great expense, the Court were willing to intimate their opinion, though they knew it would not be binding. His Lordship then reviewed the several sections of the Act, which showed that the principle, whether or not the property derived benefit from the sewers, ought still to be regarded. The oommissioners, in considering whether the defendants were liable, ought not to consider the value of the property, but the benefit which they considered the property derived from the sewvers, The Court, howrever, would refrain from giving a opinion asto whether any benefit was derived from the sewers, fpr that was a matter for the discretion of t,he commissioners. Judgmnent accordinglr. THE QUEN V. THE MAYO. AND ASSESSORS OF ROCHESTE In this case the Court had granted a mcandamu.s to the mayor and assessors of Rochester to hold a court and to revise the burgews list foi the parish of Strood, in Roches. ter. The defendants made a return, which was demurred to, and this raised the question whether the words of the 18th section of the Municipal CorporationsAct, the 5th and 6th William V., cap. 76, which required the mayor and assessors to hold a court for the purpose of revising the burgess lists at some time between the 1st of October inclusive and the 15th of October inclusive, were imperative, so that they could not lawfully hold such court at any other time, or whether they were directory only, and this Coart could dire¢t a mandamus to issue commanding them to revise the lists. Lord CAMPBELL now delivered the judgment of the Court. The question raised on the demurrer was whether the mandamus was good in point of law. The mayor and assessers had traversed none of the allegations in the writ, and they had averred nothing but what the Court would take judicial notioe of, that the mayor and assessors of 1856 were in default. They contended that the writ was bad, because it was tested on the 27th of January, 1857, instead of before the 15th of October, 1856. The question, then, was whether the 18th section of the 5th and 6th Wiliam IV., cap. 76, was directory only when it enacted that the mayor and asse6sors should revise the burgess list on some day between the 1st and 15th of October inclasive. His Lordship said that where an act was to be done for the public good, and inconvenience would arise from its not being dono, this Court had the power to order it to bo done under the prerogative writ of mandamus; and it might then be done. A well known instance of this was that when overseers of the jpoor had not been appointed in the proper time this Court nad granted a mandamus to magistrates to appoint them. That decision had beena frequently recognized and acted upon The revision of the list of burgesses ought to take plce, or burgesses would be disfranchised for a whole year, the electon of common councilmen would be inter. wredFith, and the affairs of the borough thrown into confusion There wasno othermode by which thenames of the burgesses on the list handed by the overseers to the town-clerk could be put on the burgess roll; for the statute 7th William IV. and 1st Victoria, cap. 78, gave no power, except in the case where the name of the burgess had been rejected and expunged, at the revision, from the burgess rolL That was where the claim had been adjudicated upon. But at the court held in Rochester on the 13th of October last the mayor and assessors refused to adjudicate on any; they said they had no jurisdiction, because the list ha not been fixed up every day in somepublic place in the city of Rochester. The second objection was that the mandamus coald not be obeyed because the same mayor was not now in office. But there were now a mayor and assessors in office, and they were competent to do what ought to have been done by the mayor and assessors on the 13th of October last. A third system was that this was only one of a series of proceedings for which a time was appointed by Act of Parlioment. Itmight'*be inconvenient, but it was not impossible to obey the writ, and the Court had exercised a Similar power in the case of " R. v. the Mayor of Norwich" (1 B. and Ad., 310), and "Reg. v. the MIayor of Harwich" (1 Z. and B.). The application was made to this CDourt as soon as it could well be maade after the default;* and the Court were of opinion that the mandamus might be, and foughth toc be, oDeyed; and accordingly they gave judgment Judgment for the Crown. THE QUEEN V. THE MAYOR AND ASSESSORS OP ROCHESTER. In this case, also, which related to the parish of St. Nicholas, in Rochester, Lord CAMPBBEL delivered the judgment of the Court in favour of the Crown. Judgment for the Crown. EX PARTE COBBETT. Mr. STURGEON (with whom was Mr. Gibbons) moved for a rule for a writ of habeas corpus to be directed to the keeper of the Qaeen's Prison, to bring up the body of a prisoner, Willam Cobbett, with a view to his discharge froa custody, upon the ground that he was arrested at a time when he was privile-ed from arrest. Mr. Cobbett was a creditor of the turnpite trust at Winchester, and had discovered that the clerk of the trustees had not filed cbrtainaccounts as required by the Act of Parliament, 1the 12th and 13th Victoria, cap. 87, sec. 5. Mr. Cobbett was residing at Battersea, and went down to Winchester to attend the petty sessions, and sue out a summons and infict a penalty. Having obtained a summons, he returned to London by the South-Western Railway, and, in order to go home, he got out of the train at Vauxhall, which was the nearest station to his house at which the train stopped. At the station he was arrested by two sheriff's offlicers and taken to Horsemonger-lane Gaol. It appeared that the electric telegraph had been made use of, and that the defendant had had a hand in his imprisonment. He was afterwards removed to the Queen's Prison, but the judge at chambers refused to set him at liberty, because the affidavit did not state that he went to Winchester for the purpose of suing out a summons. That defect was now supplied. It would be said that the Court ought not to extend, but rather to restrict the privilege, and that it did not extend to the petty sessions, bat he should contend that all courts represented Her Majesty. Lord CAIPBELL.-The majesty of the law. Mr. STURGEON said in order to get a summons it was necessary for Mr. Cobbett to attend personally, and to give evsdence, and in that respect it differed from a writ, which could be obtained at any time. Then, it would be said that he was a mere volunteer, and a distinetion would be drawn between a volunteer and a person who attended compulsorily before a court. But the privilege had been held by Lord Mansfield to extead to a person who attended as a witness without a sabpcena, even when he came from abroad (3 Lord og rPBL4-If the witness attends bond jlde to discharge a duty to another person he is privileged. Mr. STURGEON.-Still more would he be privileged if he attended to discharge a duty to all, to the public. The application forthe summons was made under the 5th section of the 12th and 13th Victoria, cap. 87, which enacted that where, in any year, the trustees of any turnpike-road should not hold their anual meeting on or before the 25th of March, as directed by the 3d and 4th William IV., cap. 80, the clerk should make out such statement of the debts, revenuees, and expenditure of the trust as should have been submitted to the trustees, and transmit the same to one of the Secretaries of State, on or before the 24th of April in each year, and, in case of neglect so to do, that he should forfeit a sum not exceeding 10. and not less than 51., at the discretion of any justice before whom complaint should be made. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE said Mr. Cobbett was going to Winchester, for his own purposes, to get costs, Lord CAsipELLsaid that if the privilege extended to this c smean might st the aw at defiace by beconwi-g acommoninformer. Inateadof1o(ng into Parliament to avoid arrest for debt, as a former times, he would now be. come a common informer. Mr. STURGEON admitted that the pFty wax n ot r vileed in oingtoWinchester; but as aoon X he Cd esablied go «uIt, by obtanng thie sumnons he ws prn. vleged. HeBwas arrested while on hitt direct roxd home, *fter having established the sdL Mr. Thring, who :peared to show cause in case the Court abould grant re, was not called upon. Lord CAm3PBELL sid this Court hsd always been tender of the libety o£ the subject; and whenever any peraon was shown to be illegally imprisoned the Court woul tako care to have him immediately restored to liberty. But at the same time the Court wrould ta}e care that the prvi. lege of protection from arres was not abused and carred to a length never before contended for, so as to enable a party to defy justioe. 31r. Sturgeon regted lEi claim on the proposition that a common informer going to obtain a summons was not privileged, but that he was privileged when bo bad obtained the summons and ws retarning home. For such a distinction he had cited no authority; nor had he laid dowrixany prin. ciple upon which it could ba %ported. Whenever the privilege could be claimed in " s4ng and returniDg," it also exised in "o going.' In the case referred to, where a person came from abroad to attend the trial of a cause, the moment he set his foot on English ground he LWas privileged; and he continued privleged wrhile staying and returmng, It Ws admitted that in going from his home to Winchester 3r. Cobbett had no pnvilege; and it would be monstrous to Say he had the same pivilege as those who were necessarily attending the Court in the administration of justice. Ts was the cae of a oommon informer. It was suggested that the clerk to the truDstees hd incurred a lenalty of from 5& to 104 under the 5th section of the thand 1th Victor*a cap, 87, by not mAking out and transmitting the stement required by that statute; and Mr. Cobbett sad e gad a rgt to agl o un mons to enforce that penalty. He dd not go to Westminster a3 a witness, but as a proeecutor, and when he returned it was not as a witness, but as a prosecutor. To say that any pe n mightacquirea privilegeagainstarrit on mneene or nal prooess, by suing out a summons for an information before a magistrate, was not only a novelty, but it would lead to the most inconvenient coneqtuence. It would enable a person to set hia creditors at defianc, by becoming a common informer. For such a roceeding noauthority had been cited, and no princle abeen laid downon which it could be established. Applications under similar circumstances had been made spin and again to judges sitting at chambers, who had decided that no such pnvilege existed He (Lord Campbell) thought they had rgh,tly decided. and that this application ough to faiL. T he other juRdges were of the same opinion. Mr. Justice EsRLc observed that it was the duty of the Court to enforce the law and to make judgments effectual An exception had been made na to certain arrests wlhere there was a greater demand ofjustice on another side, for the maintenanoe of a just canse. Anybody ese had as much right as 3rr. Cobbett to lay this information; and it was almiost ludicrous to suppose that any person travelling from one county to another county in tEngland for such a purpse had such a priv}lege in going, stayingP, and returning. The judgment creditor had a right to keep the prisoner in custody till the judgment w^as satisfied. Eule refused. WALEE V. iteDowALL. In this case the plaintiff, Mr. Walker, who was the public officer of the Newc-ste Ban]; ha obtained judgment in Ireland for 25,6271 9&s ld, against the defendamGnt, rge U'Dowall, who was the offical manager in Ireland of the Tipperary Bank. The plaintiff had since proceeded, under the 6th George IV., cap. 42, sec. 12, to execute a warrant of attorney for the defendant to mffer judgment in-this countr; and uPon that warrant judgment had been signed in England against the official manager, in the firstinstance, for 23,0001, giin crdit fo cert pyments; and enb§e- orc lid., thhU amount of the judgmentobtainedmIreland, OnapreviousdaytheCourthad Prnted a rule to set Iside the warrant of attorney and the last judgment, and also the scie facias brought to enfore it, upon the ground that the 12th soction of the 6th Gewrg 1V., cap. 42, did not authorize the proceedint against the "official manager," but only against the "p ublic offioer" of the bnking company, andthat a, seond judgment could not be signed. lr. BOVILL, Q.C. (with Whom Wa Mr. Kempla), now showed cause against the rule, and contended that the Winding-up Act (11th and 12th Victoria, cap. 45) applied to England and Ireland, and referred to the Both, 57th, and 58th sections. iThe 57th section enacted that " all iudgments which shall be entered PAp in any action at law against the official manager of any such company shall have the like effect and operation upon and against the property of such compny, and upon and against the persons and proery of the contributories thereof, and shall be enforced in like manner as if such judgments had been entered up agaist such comny, or against any person duly autho. ied to sue on behal of the same." The second judgment w entered to make it correspond with the judgment obtained in Ireland. Lord CA2sPBELL.-Judgment was to be entered up in England for a sum equal to the sumforwhich judgment had been obtained in Ireland. Mr. MLWvAED.-The words "equal to" meant "not exceeding," and the first judgment was entered up for the right amount, giving credit for what had been paid. Lord CAsUPngu,-The object of the Act was to make the judgment in England what it was in Ireland. Your argumentx satisfied me that the first judgment was a nullity, and I am still of the same opinion. Mr. MILWARD said this cso did not come within the 12th section of the 6th GeorgelV., chap. 42. Lord CAPBELIr said he was glad that he had directed that this case should come on peremptorily on the last day of term. It seemed to be an expedient to get over the long vacation. The rule mustbe discharged. Rule discharged. UT rXE VIOLET, AN ATTORENY. Sir F. TnESxoxG moved on the part of an attorney, named Emanuel William Violet, for leave to renew his certificate to practise as an attorney. It appeared that the arty had been struck off the roll by Mr. Commissioner J.aw for fraud and breaches of trast. Tho learned oounsel now submitted that, considering the previous character of the attorney, and the length of time he had been suspended from practice, the Court would now permit him to renew his certificate to practise. Mr. Garth, on the part of the Incorporated Law Society, opposed the applcation. Lord CAuPBELL said that, out of consideration for the honourable body of attorneys, the application must be refused. If any gentleman of the bar were to be guilty of such misconduct he would be dishonoured; andj after having been gailty of such frauds and breaches of trust, the applicant could not be allowed again to be mixed up with the honourable members of the profession. The other judges concurred. Application refused. THE QUESN V. THE VESTRY OF ST. GEORGE'S-W?TH1E-XAST. Sir F. KELLY moved for a rule to show cause why a mandamus should not issue to the Vestry of St. George's in-the-Bast, commanding them to exempt certain portions of the London Dock premises from liability to a local rate. The question was the same as was discussed in this court a few days since in a special case; but, another order for a new rate having been made, this application was made with a view to ha ing the facts stated in a special case in such a manner as to raise the question for final decision. The learned counsel said he had affidavits showing that the facts had been laid before the vestry, and that it was made to appear to them that the Dock Company derived no benefit, or an unequal benefit, from the expenses for which the rate was made, so as to entitle the company to exemption under the 159h sectionof the Metropolis Local Management Act. Lord CAMPBELL.-On that affidavit you may have a role to show cause. Sir F. KELLY said it was made to appear to the vestry. Lord CAsIPBLSLn.-That that was their opinion; that they came to that conclusion? Sir F. KELLY said the vestry did not express their opinion. Rule nisi granted. THE QUEEN V. DARE. In this case the Court had granted a rule, calling upon James Dare, the publisher of the Weston-supcr-Ma,rc fercury to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed gainst him ior a libel published in that jomnmal on the 19th of Ma'y last. The application was made on the part of a MEr. Stringfield, a gentleman who had taken some interest in the introduction of a German band into Westonsuper-Mare. The defendant, on the other hand, was interested in what was termed the " town band ;" and Mr. Stringfield said he (Dare) had conceived a strong malevolent feeling against him, arising from his having been sued by him. The libel complained of was in the form of an allegory, and imputed to Mr. Stringfield great cruelty towards his own father, and accused him of being an unnatural son. Mr. Stringfield, in the mcst distinct manner, denied all the facts stated in the libel, and deposed that he was so far from being guilty oc any of the acts of cruelty charged. against him that he bore a large share of the support of his father at a pubho ilstitution. The father also made an affidavit to the same effect. Mr. Serjeant KWGaL&KZ and Mr. K&BsrtuE now showed cause against the rule, and referred the Court to the article complained of, which contained a long history of all the previous proceedings. It would appear that the article had been occasioned by the prosecutor's own conduct and the personal attacks which he had made on the character and conduct of the editor. He had issued a printed circular in the town, in which he had alluded to the defendant and his paper as " scurrilous," and had nsed other language of a vulgar and abusive character. It also appeared that long before the action to which the prosecun tor referred the parties had been on very bad terms. There were also several affidavits dfied to show that the prosecutor had, in fact, been guilty of the acts of cruelty and inhumanity attributed to him. Mr. EDwIN J^rs, Q.C., and Mr. XEEDiHAm, in support of the rule, said that the charges made against the prosecutor were all distinctly denied both by him and by his father, and they contended that there was no ground stated why the rule should not be made absolute. Lord CAMPBELL said he was of opinion that the rule ought to be discharged. He could by no means justify the conduct of Dare, who was to be greatly censured; for, gvlin full credit to the affidavits, it was cle*r that he (Dare h worked up the materials into an affecting narrative, and had added circumstances for which there was no foundathin. If, therefore, the conduct of Stringfield had been irreproachable, there would have been no difficulty in making the rule absolute; but his (Stringfield'e) conduct waasmuch to be censured. He had attemupted to deceive the Court in saying that there was no ground for offence except the action which he had brought, when it appeared that there had been great enmity between them befere. that, and he had given Dare very serious provocation. That provoction wars not such as would justify, bat it initi. gated the conduct of Dare in jiublishing the article. The scene of the artile had been laid in 1854; but it was imposcsible to deny that in 1&)O accordingP to the &ffidavits, the material parts of the charge wrere true. Under all the circumstances he (Lord Campbell) wag of opniono tht the rule ostht to be disharged but wftout Mb. JUNsee ERL:wASO f the sMMe OpiiOn. Hz. Justie CnoXMON concurred, but oid the cre.

ATKThS V PA-RCE. In this ase Mr.iioiD showed cause against a rle to enter the 'verdict for the defendant, and Mr. ?X.ARCI ap eared. in support of it. e action was brought before the Secondary by the p iiff a ecry, for attending to three of the deehile suffering under the scarlet fever. The defendant left this country for Australia in 1852, leaving his wife ln ch-rge of his three ch;!dren, and with a sufficient allowance to maintainthem. On his return in 1856 he found his wife living with anotherr, named French, and, instead of three children, he then found her having five. On maing thidiscovery he sent for his three ceildren from ife's care, having left the house where she was living. he defendant was then sued by the plaintiff for his attendance on his wife and children during his absence ; and a part of his ball was for attending his wife in her accouchemen of the two children she had by French. This rge was, however, given up, and the pVintiff sought to recover for his attendance on tho defendant's three children during their illnes. Le jury found that the allowance of the defendant to his wife for her support and that of his children was sufficient, and also found a verdict for the plaintiff for 714 IOs. The defendant noved to set aside this verdict. It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that during cohabitation the presumption of agency in the wife waa irrebuttable, anda that if the husband held out his wile as his agent to take care of and provide for his children he was liable for her acts as his agent for that purpose. The CP Jusnez.-Can you contend that a wife living in adultery with another man is still clothed with the authority she derived from her husband ? Mr. RA.YmxoD.-If a man left his hounsekeeper to take care of his children he made her his agent to supply his children with all necessaries. The fact of her being his wife 3nado no difrerence. The CisEE JusvcX-But if he gave his servant money suf cient to precure his children necessaries the general authority ziven to her was limited to that amount. Mr. ImoND contended that this might operate as a great hardship, as the children might starve in the father's absence, if the amount were not sufricient. The Lord CEmx JusTicx (without calling on the other side to su,port the rule) said he was of opinion that the rule must he made absolute to enter the verdict for the defendant. It appeared that the wife, who was left in this country by the defendant, entered into an adulterous connexion with another person, who assumed her husband's name, and the plaintiff, a medical practitioner, supplied attendance and medicines to her. He was of opinion that there was no authority on the part of the wife to bind the husband in this case. It was clear she could not bind him for attendance upon herself, because she was living in adultery with another man. It had been ingeniously put on the part of the plaintiffthatin this casethe wife was invested with a special authority as the agent of the husband for the supprot of the children; but if it was assumed that she was his agent not gud wife, but as a person who had committed to her the care of his children, then in this particular case there arose this answer, that this was not an authority to provide necessaries for his children on his credit, for the agency was coupled with an allowance of a sufficient smfor their support, which the jury had found was fully adequate for the occasion. The authority, therefore, was simply an authority to support his children out of the funds provided for them. The Court were therefore of opinon that the wife had no authority to pledge her husband's credit,4and the rule toenuter the verdict for the defendant must be made absolute. Rule absolute. This case concluded the Term.
COURT OF EXCHEORIF P1rb A vX- 'I ' MOSSOP V. WAL};Pk (SittinUas in 2an -I tur. UflAY and Mr. DOYLE showed cause against a rule to set aside two orders of Barons Martin and BramwelL It appeared that Mr. Mossop had sued and recovered judgment for 10L from Mr. Walker, who alEo sued and re. covered a large sum of money from one Bartlett. By a provision in the Common LawvProcedure Act, 1854, an order was mado to attach so much of the sUm recovered by Walker as should be required to satisfy the judgment obtained by Mossop against Walker, and by a subsequent order that sum was durected to be paid over to one Darrant, who had purchased the judgment of Mossop. The object of the present rule was to set aside those two orders, on the ground that the attorneys of Walker in the action against Bartlett, had a hen for the costs of that suit, which ought to be satisfied in the first instance before the debt recovered by their client could be attached by the operation of the Common Law Procedure Act. Mr. MACNAM appeared to support the rule, but had not proceeded far in his argument when the Court suggested that both orders might be referred to Mr. Justice Wiles, to which the counsel on both sides acceded. RFILT V. nAiLS The COURT delivered judgment in the above, which was a demurrer to a declaration alleging that the defendant was possessed of a mare which was afficted with the glanders, and knowing she was afflicted with such disease he caused her to be sold by auction at a horse repository, and the plsintiff, believing the mare to be in a healthy state, became the purchaser of her at the sale, and paid therefor 61. I0N., and y reason of the diseased state of themare the same was utterly worthless to the plaintiff) and the plaintiff necessarily paid the sum of 21. 2s. to a veterinary surgeon for examnining the mare and reporting on her condition, and in consequence of the mare being put into a stable wherein anotherhorseoftheplaintiff's was the said horsebecLme infected with the saiddisease and died thereof, and the laintiffwas obliged topay 1 in endeavouing to cure the lastmentioned horse of the disease The COURT were unanimously of opinion that the declaration did not disclose a cause of action. Even although the sellng of a glandered horse in a public market or at a fir might be indictable and might give a cause of action wshere special damage was astained, it was not stated in the declaration that it was a public market; on the contrary, it appeared to be a private repository from which the owner might exclude any persons he chose. It was consistent with the declaration that the seller had informed the auctioneer that the horse had the glander6, and that it was sold as a glandered horse. The CoURT, therefore, gavejudgmnent for the defendasBt. LU'DUS V. IdRLOSB AND OTHBRF. 3fr. M.

POLICE. Bow-sTnErr.-John Stevens, a young man who described himselfas a painter, and said he lived in John. street, Paddington, was charged with having feloniously entered two houes in Endsleigh-street, Euston-square. Inspetor Checkley, of the E division, informed Mr. JAR-DLZ-E that there was another msau in custor-y who was taken at the same time with the prisoner, but who in the attempt to escape had reoeived ibjuries Bo severe that it was found necessary to take him to the University College Hospit31, where he still In ia very precarious state. This man, who gave the name Willam Hend k, had stated to him (Mr. Cheokley) that he was injured by a falL As the evidence against both prisoners was tho same, he should oytpre tender sufficient evidence for a remand, to await the recovery of Hendrick. It appeared thatthe house, No. 6, Endsleigh-street, is at present unoccUpied except by a woman who takes care of the premises. On Thursday night she went out for a short time, leaving the area door open, and it is supposed that the prisoner and his companion entered by that door, closed and bolted it behind them, and proceeded to the top of the house. They must have got out by the attic window, and, after attempting to enter several other houses, ultimately got into the house No. iun the same street. On the return of the woman at No. 6 she found the door bolted from the inside, and at once raised an alarm of " Thieves I " which aroused Mr. Stewart, a gentleman residing at No. 1, who, hearing some persons in the house, attempted to cap. ture the intruders. They got out, however, by the back door, aud attempted to escape by the neighbouring gardens. Several constablas and others pursued, and after a sharp chase captured them. When alarmed in No. 1, they left behind them their implements of trade, consisting of a rope ladder, a number of jemmies, skeleton keys, and other tools. A ceartificate was produced from Mr. Jackson, house sur. geon at the hospital, to the effect that Hendrickwas suffering from ooncussion of the spine. Mr. JARDiNE remanded the prisoner. MARYLEBOw -A woman, about 50, named Elizabeth White, was charged with having stolen a quantity of plate aud other property. Cookman, 155 D, said that yesterday morning, at 2 o'clock, while on duty in Conduit-street, Paddington, he met the prisoner, who was carrying a bundle. He asked her what was in it. She said. " Some dirty linen, which I am taking to get washed." He (witness) told her that he could not allow her to go withoat looking at the contents of the bundle, when she said, drawing a bottle from under her arm, " This is nice whisky; take some of it, my dear man, and let me go." The prisoner had also under her arm another package, which contained a number of silver spoons, knives, and other pro- rty. She was taken into custody, and after she was locked up lie (the constable) went to the house of Mrs. Falcon widow of Admiral Falcon, where he found the butler iying in the pantry asleep and much Ithe worse for drink. Be entered the house in consequence of having found the door of it ajar, and he obtained sufficient information to induce him to believe the prisoner had taken the articles he found upon her from that house. On his return to the station-house the prisoner asserted that she had slept repeatedly with the butler, and did not deny that she had taken the things alleged to have been stolen by her. The property found by the constable was produced by him, and, after some further proceedings, the prisoner was remanded till Thursday week. Henry Adams, a hairdresser living in Boston-place, Dorset-sauare, was charged with having attempted to termninate his own existence by swallowing a quantity of essential oil of almonds. The evidenco of Cattermole, 38 D, and that of another witness, was gone into, when the prisoner, who was said to be jealous of his wife, was sent to the House of Detention for a week, the magistrate remarking that he would, there eceive the spiritual advice of the chaplain. WfnsmpIsmJTRET.-The magistrates have received a 51.- note from "X. Y.," 10s. from "Lash, R.N.," 1. from " L C.," 5s. from " C. R.," and Us. from "HL W ." all 'which will benappled as the donors intend they should, and 32)s. from " X. Y." for a poor woman named Townahend. 'whase husband is now in the House of Correction for a brntal assault upon her. THIMES.-ElizA Aspen and Ellen Summers, two welldressed women, each aged 19 yeas, were brought up on remaand before Mr. SELFE, charged with stealing two mantles, value 21., from the shop of 3Ir. James Thomas, linendraper, Arbour-terrace, Commercial-road east. Mr. SELFE said, he believed that both prisoners were iccomplished shoplifters, and had been going about on Fri. day and Saturday last committing felonies. He sentenced them to three months' imprisonment and hard labour. SOUTHWAR.a-George Betts, a respectable-looking man, irepresenting himself as a porter at Stevens's Hotel, Bondstreet, was brought before Mr. COMBE charged with falsely stating himself to be a constable of the S division of the M-eropolitan Police, and assaulting 275 M in the execution ,of his duty. The officer stated that shortly after 12 o'clock on Thursday night hewason duty near Blackfriars-bridge, when the prsoner, who was a little intoxicated, came U to him and said he wanted a ride to King's-cross. He told him he could soon ride there, as there were plenty of cabs about the street, when he replied that he did not want a cab, but a King'scross omnibus. Witness informed him that it was very late, and they had done running, and he thought it would be the best thing for him to get home as aoon as he could. The prisoner then made use of an oath, saying that he was a policeman of the 8 Division, and he should go when he liked. Peiceiving that he was under the influence of drink he told him that if he was a policeman he had better show his warrant card. The prisoner then struck him, and said, 'There's my warrant card." Witness then with the assistance of the fire-escape conductor, took him into ceustodly. Mr. COMBE (to the prisoner).-Well, what have you to say? Are you a polioeman ? Prisoner.-I am very sorry, Sir, for gaying so. I am not a constalble. Mr. CoMBE.-What are you, then? Prisoner.-I have beean a porter four years at Stevens's Eotel, Bond-street, and I am about to emigrate with my wife to Melbourne. Mr. Comas.L-Have you left Stevens's Hotel ? Prisoner.-I have just left, and am now living at Camberwell until the ship sails on the 20th inst. I met some friends esterday afternoon, and was proceeding to the Euston 'Iotel with a letter to a friend, who is a waiter there, when I unfortunately spoke to the constable. Here is the letter, ;Sr. Mr. CoaciB.-This is very strange. Theletter is directed to the person who wrote it. How is that? The prisoner said,-I wrote it for one brother to another, 1cecause be could not write. Mr. CosBE.-I reaUy cannot talke your word for that. You have asserted yourself to be a policeman, and your statemnent to me mnay be equally false. Prisoner.-I can assure you, Sir, it is true. Mr. Charles Ferry, of D)ulwich, is the present proprietor of Stevens's Hotel, and 1Mr. Thomas is his manager, and he can give me a odcharacter. Mr. CoNisE.-Your statement is so contradictory that I can hardly believe you; therefore I shall not alow you to go at large without knowing more :bout you. You have not only been guilty of a serious offence in falsely personating a constable, but you assaulted the officer without the least provocation, which leads me -tn suspect that if you have been in service at Stevens's Hotel you may have been discharged for misconduct. You are ther fore remanded until Monday. and if then your statement is not corroborated, I doa't think you will go to Mfelbourne on the 20th inst. In the latter part of the day two respectable persons attended before his worship, and stated that they had ]nown the prisoner as having lived as porter at Stevens's Hotel upwards of five years, and that he left a few weeks ago, and got married with the intention of proceeding to nAstralia with what little money he had saved. They had known the prisoner as an industrious and sober man, and ,generally well conducted. Mr. OemiEB here ordered the prisoner to be bronght from dhe cells, when he told him he had caused all the igcon vemonce on himself by telling a falsehood, and represeating himself to be a constable. Re now understood that he was a decent sort of a man, therefore he shonld order him to be berated on paying a fine of 5s. He hoped 'his being locked rap would act as a caution to him for the future. The prisoner paid the fine. and, having th&nked his wornhip, left the conrt with his friends.

The first was for embezzling 25 pints of rum in July, 1855. The second charge was, that the prisoner when in actual service and on fullpay of tbe fleet, and Paymastsr of and in Her Majesty's ship Childers, was, on or about the 29th day of July, 1855, guilty of fraudulent conduct, unbecoming the character of an offlicer, in telling a wilful and deliberate falsehood to Commander Victor Grant Hickley, his commanding officer. The third charge was that of drankenness, and the fourth imputed neglect of duty in not sending in the victualling accounts of the sloop Childers from April, 1855, to April, 1856, and from the 1st day of Oct, ber, 1856, to the date of his being superseded, and the clothing accounts of the said sloop for the whole period during which they were in his charge. Evidence having been heard in support of the charges, Mr. Hoskins addressed the Court in defence of the prisoner. The Court, after some deliberation, gave the following decision:" That the first and second charges had not been proved, that the third charge had been proved, and the fourth charge partly proved; but, in consideration of the high character which the prisoner had previously borne in Her Majesty's service, the Court only adjudged him to be placed at the bottom of the list of paymasters in the navy, and there to remain." The Mauritius, No. 5 steam transport, 2,300 tons, 300 horse power, Captain Cruiokshanl;, arrived at Spithead at 8 o'clock, yesterday morning from Gravesend, having made tbe run in 18 hou.

She left Grave send at half-past 1 o'clock, and when past the Gull Light her engines were stopped and some sail set, when it was found that at a speed of from three to four knots per hour she steered as well as if her screw had been lifted. The average speed of her engines was 38 revolutions with lOlb. pressure of steam. The former speed of the Mauritius was 8& knots with 55 revolutions, and her speed on Thursday night averaged 10 knots with 38 revolutions. Shc has gone into Portsmouth harbour to embark the 93d Highlanders for China.

The Eurydice, 26, Captain 3. W. Tarleton, C.B. (1855), which was paid off at Chatham yesterday, has been in ema-| minison upwards of three years, having sailed from Portsmnouth in April, 1854. This vessel formed one of the squadron directed to proceed to the White Ses, and during the summer of 1854 was employed In the blockade of Archangel. On returning to Spithead in November of that year the Eurydice was ordered to join the squadron of Rear. Admiral A. Fanshawe, .1.B., Commander-in-Chief on the West India station. While at Bermuda Captain J. W. Tarleton, who had formerly commanded the Fox, 42, was appointed to the commnand of the Eurydice, vice Captain Ommanney. During 1855 and 1856 this vessel was employed in cruising between Hlalifax, Caba, Jamaica, and the other West India islands. She was stationed about 13 months at Greytown, and was afterwards engaged in taking the Bishop of Barbadoes and the Governor of Trlnidad on a cruise among the West India islands. The Eurydioe sailed from Barbadoes for England on the 6th of April, the following vessels being then*at that station:Brilliant, 20; Atalanta, 16; and Perseverance, 2, steam screwtroopship;:theUreent screw steanmr SaIIAA f.,rn1,on., a few days before the Eurydice. The crew have been extremely healthy, only one death having occurred. On the vessel being tpaid off yesterday Captain Tarleton addressed the petty officers and crew, expressing his approbation of their uniformly good conduct since he had been in command.

The Mariner, 12, sloop, Commander W. R. G. Palliser (1856), was paid off at Chatham yesterday. She was com. missioned at Plymouth in 1854, since which period she has been employed in the West Indies for the purpose of aristing in the suppression of the slave trade off Cuba and the other Spanish islands.

THE GREA2' FIRE AT CAMDEN-TOWN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As an eye-witness of the direful calamity which terrified the inhabitants of this neighbourhood, perhaps yon could spare a small 8pace in your valuable journal to call the attention of the fire authorities to the present state in which the outskirts of this vawt metropolis are with regard to assistance in case of fire. As you are perfectly aware the London Fire Brigade is entirely in the hands of the insurance companies, who, with a shortsightedness difficult to understand when their interests are considered, make no sort of alteration in the stations of their engines to meet the requirements of the rapid and vast extension of this .netropolis. According to the report in your journal of the above fire, the Brigade engines began to arrive about 10 minutes to 11 oeclock, the fire having broken out about 20 minutes after 10. So far, therefore, as the Brigade is concerned, they arrived at the scene when, at the lowest compatation, 100,0001. worth of property was in flames, and were enabled to do little more than look on while 150,0001. worth more Surely MOis is a state of things not becoming the high efficiency of the Brigade, which undoubtedly exists so far as the men and machines are concerned; but, at the same time, how insignificant do we become at our large fires for want of being properly handled ! Camnden-town is not singularly situated. The Great Northern Railway Terminus in Maiden-lane, on the edge of that canal which skirted Pickford's rast warehouses, has no Brigade station nearer than Helborn. Its fate is easy to imagine should it chance to take fire, to say nothing of the great railway terminus at Paddington, equally distant from any Brigade station, and other "laces of large magnitude in the outskirts. The public i jrest, as well co that of the companies, wonld seem to require an increase and revision of the stations of the " London Pire Brigade." According to Mr. Braidwood's report, eight engines only were present,-I think one A, four B, and three C. If this is eorrect, where were all the others? The force musters something like 20. I am, Sir, &c., ONE OF THE BRIGADE.

On presenting the sword, the first good-conduct prize, to Mr. Jopp The C crmAN said,-This sword is awarded by the Court of Directors to the senior cadet whose conduct has been irreproachable during the whole period of his studieg. To this prize you are entitled. I trust that the same pure and honourable conduct which has distinguished you hitherto will mark the whole of your future career. Immediately afterwards the CH:nssX?B awarded the Pollock gold medal to the same cadet, saying,-This medal, awarded to the cadet of the highest general merit of the fourth term going out, and who by his conduct and character reflects most credit on the college, was instituted by the inhabitants of Calcutta in honour of the high services of Sir George Pollock, with whose presence they were that day honoured, in order to stimulate young soldiers to follow his bright example. You, Mr. Jopp, have been declared worthy of it, and I heartlly congratulate you on obtaining so high an honour. (Much applause.) At the termination of the distribution, The CHAiRmAN, who was received with continued cheers, addressed the cadets. He said he had the honour to hold a high position in the East India Company, many of whose members were most distinguished officers both in the Company's and in Her Majesty's service. A number of those gentlemen had done them the honour to be present on that occaion, and he had great pleasure in reading in their pre. sence an extract from the report of the LieutenantGovernor of the college respecting the conduct of the young gentlemen under his care. It said-"It is diffi. cult to imagine so large a body of young men to be better conducted. In this happy state of affairs I am much indebted to the seniors, who have also exhibited great diligence, combined with great propriety of conduct, in the haDs of study. I have much pleasure likevwise in noticing that a larger number than usual have passed their strict ordeal of two years without incurnog any censure." (Hear hear.) Thechairman continued, he was most happy to add his congratulations to thereportof the Lieutenant-Governor. In all that had taken place he had only discovered one cause for regret, which was that the Public Examiner had not found more than six gentlemen duly qualified for the service of the Engineers. There was a very great demand in India at this moment for well qualiled officers of Engineers, and it would have afforded him very great pleasure had the Public Examiner felt himself justified m nominating a larger number of cadets. He observed that Mr. Lewis C. Gordon and Mr. J. Brandreth had each severally obtained more marks than any gentlemen of the fourth rank. He was not disposed in any way to disparage the efforts of the other gentlemen, because he thought their merits lent an additional distinction to the energy displayed by those two yourg men in acquiring so many marks within three terms. SIe hoped at the next examination to see them in a still higher position. On behalf of the Court of Directors, he desired to return their best tbanks to the LieutenantGovernor, the Public Exami oer, and the professors, for their excellent and zealous services. To those gentlemen who were about to proceed to Chatham he might say that they owed their best thanks to Colonel Sandham for the attention he had _paid to the cadets placed under his charge, and no doubt the same attention would be shown to those others still present. As he before remarked, engineer officers of all descriptions for the higher order of works were in great demand in India, and for many years that demand would doubtless increase rather than diminish. For all those who were qualified for promotion their progress would be abun. dantly rapid, whether in the artillery or in the infantry. With regard to the artillery, he need hardly repeat what had been said on former occasions as to the high merit and distinction of that service. He had freqnextly heard officers in Her Majesty's service speak of the artillery of India as second to none in the world. (Hear.) He remembered hearing the late Sir Charles Napier say that it was the best artillery he had ever seen, and he (the chairman) trusted with oonfidence that it would not deteriorate in the hands of those then before him. He could assure those gentlemen going to India that they would never find reason to regret tbe time and labour spent in attaininf a high degree of education in this country. uany gentlemen who had gone out without obtaining prizes had reached positions of great eminence, owing to the education which they had commenced at Addiscombe and duly followed up in nfter life. He earnestly impressed upon the cadets the necessity of losing no time when they arrived in India in acquiring a colloquialfamiliarity with the language and also the importance of preserving the best relationship with the various members of their families at home. Above an noe egged them never to forget that they were the children of Christian parents, and that they had to serve a Master above who was higher than any authority, though, as far as possible, His commandments were identical with those of their temporal superors. He trusted that the blessed hope that was held out as the future reward for good conduct in this life would be their constant guide upon aU occasions. There was one subject of paramuount importanca which he hoped through the instrumentality of the press would attract public attention; be aluded to the great alteration in the deportment of European officers towards the native officers and men of India. In expressng that opinion he was supported by a highly distinguisbh officer, and be regretted much to find that there did not exist that cordiality between the Europeans and natives that ought to be maintained. He besought the cadets to cultivate more friendly relations with the officers and men, to join them in their sports, and advise them in their troubles. That they would appreciate kind treatment was evident from many well-known incidents, espcially that related by Macaulay as having occurred at the siege of Arcot, when " the Sepoys came to Clive. not to complain of their scanty fare, but to propose that all the grain should be given to the Earopeans, who required more nourishment than the natives of Asia The thin gruel, they said, which was strained awav from the rice would suffice for themselves. History contains no mnore touching instance of- military fidelity, or of the influ- ence of a commanding mind." He hoped they would remember that bright incident, and also that a few hundred men could only rule hundreds of thousands of their fellow. creatures by tho force of affection-no other mode could ever succeed. If they could not be held by love they could not be held at all, and he therefore entreated them by every means in their power to keep on good terms with he people among whom they were going to dwelL (Loud cheers.) The visitors then adjourned to the buUding in which the MpOSimsJW of th Mades toxoeiltnce in military aud eivil drawing were arrangel for inspeation. Both clases of works were remarkably good; tho ltter, especially, forming quite a little art exhbiotion (and a by no means indifferent one) in itself. Bat the rule observed in this department in tke distribation show-ed itself on a glance at the walls to be 'ssjust. Only pupils of the fourth term are allowed to compete for the first-class prize, undof the third term for the second, and Boon. Yesterday, therefore, there were works in the fourth and second clas;e which both in artistic skill and general treatment were infinitely better drawings than some w4lchgainedhigherprizes. Itcertainlyappears snore creditable to a upil to do the best drawing after two terms than the best after four. At all events, in an award of prizes the standard should be merit rather than seniority. The modelroom, containing some most beantifully execated models of the fortifications of Coblentz and Ehrenbreitstein,with their outworks, and a series of small forts illustrating the Prussian, Dufour, and Chasseloup systems, was next visited. Twhe models imost deservodly elicitea marked expressioins of approbationfromthe professional visitors. Theywereexecuted with perfect care and neatness, even to the most minute points, and it was difficult to conceive how the counterguards ravelins, glacis, and casemates could have been =nshed with almost mathematical acaracy in so loose and leeble a material as wet sand. The scale was 1-8th and 1.16th of an inch to the foot. When the models had been sxplained the cadets asembled on the parade-ground and went through the manual and platoon exercise with an easy sapidity which spoke well for their training. Their marchIng, for steadines and aolidity, could not be surpassod bY any regiment in the service. A salute of 15 rounds from the small fieldpieoes in honour of the chairman concluded the prooeedings of the day. An excellent luncheon was sered in the college for the visitors before returning to town.

I CONVICTS IN WZST AUSTRALIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-My attention has been drawn to the war waged by the English press against the continuance of the ticket-ofleave system, and the oft-reiterated question " What aro we to do with our convicts ?' has induced me to request you will insert a few words in your powerful journal in reply to this vexed question, with a view to call attention to the means at present exsting in this province to absorb a large number of convicts both from England and her colonies. The inhabitants of Western Australia agreed to receive male convicts in 1851, sinoe which time a limited number have annually made their appearance. An enormous outlay has been entered into by the Imperial Government in the erection of prison buildings in various parts of this scattered colony, and, in addition, a heavy expense has up to this period been incurred in importing the necessaries of life for themaintenance of these convicts. Now that all this expense has been incurred, when no more buildings are required, when the colony is in a position to grow fo od for any number of convicts that may be sent, and when the inhabitants have fair grounds to hops that the prisoners, having housed themselves, would be emi ployed on public works for the benefit of the community at large, an outcry is raised about the enormous expense in, curred, and a doubt has arisen whether transportation is to continue to our shores. Surely, this is bad policy I With proper management and superintendence and a fair supply of free immigration to counteract the bond Western iAustralia is capable of absorbing as many convicts (male and female) as England cares to get rid of. I de not intend to imply that if any large number of oonvicts were sent into the colony without previous notice that they would be immediately absorbei intoprivate employ; but what I do unhesitatingly affirm is that a steady annual supply of from 1,000 to 1,500 convicts would in the course of a very short period find a market for their labour. Let a certain number of convicts be annually sent; let tenders for all supplies required for them be invited in the colony, aud a market is at once created, a door is opened for merchants and agriclturists to employ their capital in the colony, and food, clothing, and stores will in the oourse of two or three years be obtained here cheaper than they are now imported from the mother country and other colonies; and last, not least, employment is offered for all prisoners from time to time as they are released. There is no part of the British possessions so woll suited * ? , --. , >@All_ * ~~~~~~ne COLony is a Perfect Prison, from which there are no means of absconding. As a proof of this only one prisoner has escaped since 1851. The superior attractions of the gold. fields in the Eastern colonies would have allured many had they been able to find means of exit. The colony abounds in land suited for agricultural purposes, possesses as fine timber for naval services as is to be procured in any part of the world, and there are copper and lead mines that merely require labour and capital to afford a ready and a profitable yield. So far as the convict system has been tried in the colony it has succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectations of those interested in its well doing, and I need adduce in proof of this no further arguments than that the statistics of crime since the introduction of convicts (and in a country where one.third of the inhabitants are convicts) will oom. pete with those of any part of Her Majesty's dominions. I have, Sir, to apologize for taking up so much space in your valuable journal. and will only add that the above opinions are those of a large and influential body of the colonists, all of whom are anxious for the continuanoe of transportation, and that I am, Sir, your obedient servant. A COLONIST OF WESTERN AUSTRALTA. 1'erth, Westemn AuRtrd* April 13.

SPORTING INTBLLIGRNC.k? ASCOT RACES. FRRTmAv- The meeting was brought to a most sucocssfl close, na the interest which the racing excitedat thecommenoeemet was fullr sustined to the end. The sport was wound up with a deid heat, which, however, was not run off, and the weary bookmakers and tired race officials quitted the He,th with their faith in the old axiom respecting the impossi. bility of having too much of a good thing materiauy ehaken. The weather was glorioudy iine, and the attendance of general oompany was, for a last day, unusually arge. The numerically strong muster of spectators, however, m,y be explained by the fact of the course being now brought within little more than an hour's ride from London, and by the important addition to the programme in the Handicap Sweepstakes, to which the South-Western And Snes and Woldngham Railway Companies liberally contribute 3001. The mention of this stake gives us an opportunity of bearIng tet.imony to the exoellent arngements which were made throughout by the railway authorities for the conveyanoe of visitors to and from Ascot, Every person connected with the meeting, from the stewards down to the gatekeepers, have caue for gratulation at the regularity with which the procedinn war - uuoseu. .nven mue most Inveterate gramblers could arce}ly find an opportunity to indulge their whims. That most onerous and disagreeable duty-handicapping. wa, strage to say, performed to the satisfaction of owners of horses, and the many close races during t,ho four days showed with what judgment and impWrtiaty the weights had been distributed. It would be uncourteous not to acknowledge the zeal and interest which the teowards-tho Earl of Beaborough, the Marquis of Anglesey, and Lord W. Powlett-displayed for the proper management of the business proceedings. Their slightest wish, hovever, wan mat with promptitude by Mr. Edward ibburd, who, vvith the Nermarket staff of officials, Messrs. Clark and Manninz, put every arrAngement into effect with an enorgy and determination which could only be acquiredbylong experience. Mr. Edwrd bburdso acted as starter, and his qudifications for that important office were attested bY the admirable manner in which the horses Were in every instance got off, and by the rare circumstance of the jockeys throughout the four days not incurig either a reprimand or a fine. The Grand Stand receipts were abovethe average, and the ease and comfort with which all persons found accommodation showed how excellent wero the arrangements made by Mr. Skinner, to whom was intrusted the sole management of the Grand Stuad. While performing our verypleasnt task of commending the officials, it would be uniust to omit mention of the liberal manner in which Mr. Careless conducted the refreshment departmena and that his efforts were appreciated was attested by his being "eaten out" on the Cnp-day. The efficiency of the polioe regulations was universally acknowledged. The style in which the course was cleared on the Derbgyday by the A division was a theme of general commendation, and Superintendents Walker and iHughes andlnspeotors Grant, Badstock, and Butt, who h the command o£ the men, added to the golden opinions which thes won at Epeom by the promptitude and Tigonr with which they carried out their plans during the past meeting.

ENaLTji OF MR. BB1OBT.--=Ou readers will doubtless be gratified to Ilear that diuing his oontinental sojourn MKr. Bright's health has undergone a. gradual but gteady improvement. His las letter, date& from Brussels, taken with its more immediate pre decessors induce his Boabdale relatives to indulge hedsngneo expectation that on his return to this country Mr. Brigha wil be found to possess in their fuU vigour those meatal and physical powers by which he was previously so greatly distinguished. The date of Mr. Brighs return is fxed for about the middle of next month. TRZAirUENT OF SnA3MEN ON BOARD AXERICAiq SEEips.-The Shipping and lMercantile GazeUe has beeni f- voured with the following copy of a note addresed by General Cass to Lord Napier, Her Majeetys Minister aV Washington, in reply to a representation which LordNaplerwas instructed by the Earl of Clarendon to address to the United Statese Government relative to the oppressive treatment to which seamen are subjected on board Americm venels:-"Department of State, Washington, April 28, 1S57. My Lord,-I have the honour to acmknowledge the~ receipt of your lordship's note of the 10th inst., stating that the attention of Her Majesty's Government and of the, British public has of late been awakened to the irregulaties attending the enlistment of seamen on board the mercantile vessels of the United States, and the nature of their treatment when so employed. Your lordship expreffee a hopo that some remedial measure may be suggested for these abuses. In reply I have the honour to state that it is believed the laws now in force upon the sabject of seamein employed on board the merehant vessels of the United States are quite sufficient for their protection. The execution of these laws in foreign countries' for the most part devolves upon consuls. It is possible, that these officers may, in some instances, have been delin uent in the discbarge of their duty in Her Majestys Arts. his department, however, is not aware of any such dn quencies; but, upon being satisfied of their existenoe wilU not hesitate to apply the proper remedy. A copy of theW United States' consular regulations is herewith transmitted and your lordship is particularly referred to the 19th chapter, entitled, 'Duties of Consular Officers in relationt to Seamen of the United States' From the great detQand for sailors in our ports in proportion to their supply, and the improvidence and credulity which usually characterize them, they are necessarily exposed to imposition toa degree which, probably, no laws could prevent. It is presumed that seamen required forthe British mercantile, marine in Her Majesty's own rts are more or less subject to the same grievance. I should be glad to concur in anY measures for the relief of this useful class of persons, bur, the laws of this coantry intended to prevent their maltreatment are as effective, it is believed, as those of any other. Instanoes may have occurred where offenders have' escaped punishment, but this, I am persuaded, should be, imputed to defective proofor other accident, and not either to any inadequacy in the law itself or to want of ixapartialty In its admxnistration.-I avail myself, &C., Lwrs. EQUALSTION OF POOR-RATyz, - Yesterday a, deputation of gentlemen belonging to the metropolitsn vestries and bsards of guardians s received by Mr. Bouverie, at Whitehall, for the purpose of presenting a, memorial praying for the asistanoe of the Poor Law BoLrd in procuring an equalization of poorrates tbroughout the metropolis. The deputation, having been introduoed by Mr. derman Sidney, Mr. Gilbert (chairman of the Association for the Equalztion of Poor-rates) entered into some statistics with the object of proving that the immense overcrowding of the poor population in certain districts ws mainly owing to the present stem of unequal assessment. Other gentlemen having beenheard who took asimilar vier of the subject, and pointed out the anomalies of the present system, Mr. Bouverie said the subject would come before ths iouse of Commons on Tuesday next, on a motion for a seleet committee, and he must reserve his opinions and the advice which he intended to give the GoverDment on the subject till then. At the same time he reminded the deputation that they only represented the 20 assessed parishes, and that the more favoured districts of themetropolis would be most strenuous in their oppositioa to such a proposaL He also pointed out to them that a Bill to establish a union rate, had met with the most decided opposition, so as to compel Its abandonment;_ and he assured the deputation that if they succeeded they must expect an agitation from the rural parishes, much nore heavily rated than themselves, for a national rating. As to} overcrowding, he believed it had nothing to do with the question of rating; and, in concluison, he said the questiont was one to bh settled, not by the board, but by Parliament, SHOOTnG ON BOARD AN, RrA N SsttP,_Atthe police-court, Liverpool, on Thursday, before Mr-% S.
