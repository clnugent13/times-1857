FUND FOR THE BREZIRF OF TER SUF- FERERS BY TER MUTINY IN INDIA, Yetterday the committee appointed at the sneetinglheld at the Mansion-house on the 25th ult. for the purposo of colecting funds for the relief of the sufferers by the rebel lion In India again assembled in the Egyptain-hall, under the presidency of the Lord Mayor. There were presentMr. Gregaon, M.P., Admirl Sir Stephen Lushington, C.B., Colonel Iredell, Colonel Goodwyn, Lieutenant-Colonel Hendelson, Sir Moses Montefiore, Mr. Alderman Salomonas, Mr. Alderman Wire, Mr. Alderman Rose, Mr. Dent, Mfr. J. Cundy, Mir. Gordon, Mr. Skipper, Mr. Hadow, Mz. Anderson, Mr. Casenove. Mr. FORPMT, the acting seCretar, rd a great number of letters from magistates and gentlemne of 1nflaence in various parts of the kin oi, the writers of which slpres8ed ther hearty approal or the procesdings of the committee, and enclosed ubscriptions. The followeag letter, addresd by the Secretary of the East India Company to Colonel aenderson, was also read: IndIa-1hoese, Het, 2X 85. My dear Sir,-The E;t India ompany hays given lnasrueilons to the Gorerumbut of lndis to adopt meaes tor the lmmedate retliet or suffe55. whetber connected with the eble serice or noet.

"Vmyflthfnt1lyyo, *Colon Hendrson JAMES 0. MLVILMT. The seeretary next read the COpJ of a letter, dated the 8th int., from the Lord Mayor, as president of the cominittae, to the GovernorGenerl of India, enclosing afuther order for 80,000 rupees, wzhicha has been placed at hl Biqel. lenfy'a disposal in the Bank of Agr, for the relief of the Sir S. LTsBumTox said he had received a co:eaunica, tion to the effect that a number of persons from the scene of the mutiny, principally widows and children, had just arived at Southampton in a perfectly destitute condition. Ere therefore proposed that an agent should be appointed at Southampton with full powers to relieve the8s persons, aMid suggested that Captain W. Ramsay, R.W. should be reqTuested to undertake the office. sfter a short discussion, in the coure of which it ' e urged that, as the %eoondoriginal reenlution atood, and until It had been amended at a public meeting, the committee were not justified in ayppropriating any portion of the fusids collected to cases of distress in this country (the resolution decreeing that the amounts as collectedwereto be forwarded to the Governor-General), the pioposition ef Sir S.lushing. ton was referred to the sub-committee. Alderman SALOMONS snid that something ought to be done with a view to modifying the termns of the second reso. lution, as it was perfectly clear that a portion of the funds collected must be appropriated to any cases of distres arising from the mutiny which might be brought under the notice of the comrxittee. It wfs then aRreed that a publio reaeting should be caled without delay lor the purpose of amending the resolution in question. The LoRD MAYOR announced that the subecrptiocis in hand amounted 16,7161. A vote of tbanks to the Lord Mayor brought the proceed. ingt to a close.
THB MILITIA. TO TE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-,ow that the Mltia Is to be embodied, may I beg of you to give circulation to the following facts?- On ihe 5th day of June, 1855, I obtained m eansign's commission, and during the late wrservedwithmyregirnent in the Mediterrmneau (where we were highly praisd by the Governor), doing garison duty and being on the sme footing with the Line. The war ceased, we returned to England, and were disembodied; since which I have obtained my lieutenancy. M2y sole object in entering the Militia (I being then In mny 22d year) was to enter the Line, which 'I failed to do on account of our regiment not being allowed to volunteer. and now, although I have made repeated applications for a commission, I am told that I ams "too old," and that my service in the Militia counts for nothing I Really this appears a very hard case. I gave up the pro fession of the law, to which I Aiad been articled, and served four years in the hopes of getting into the Line. I can produce firs-rate testimonials from my commanding offlcer and adjutant as to my efficiency as an offiber, and also as to my general good conduct (which I enclosed upon making application for a oommission), but all to no effect. Now, I im at a loss to see in what manner the ervice could suffer in admitting me-not quite 24. Surely, Ishould be of more servic-having passed m y drill-than one who would have It to Iean If youx wiU kindly use your powerful Inuence in seeing the subalterns of Mhitia righted you will confer a lasting obligation on Your obedient servant. B. B. TO THE EDITOR OF THE.TIMES. Sir,-At a time when our nifitary itrength is subjeted to a strain, it behoves us to lookwell to the mngement of the nursy or feeder of the actlv6 army-I mean the 3Militia. s It is clear that, generally spesking, the Militia must depend on retired officers of the Line for its regimenta organization and its field training, It is notorious, indeed, that in nearly every instance In which a " county" regi rnent, from some cause or other, has not been fortunate tnough to secure one or more Linesmen for field offioers that reglment is below its luokier fellows in point of drill, eoldierlike bearing, and conduot in quarters. To illustrate this assertion I might mention a Scotch Militia corps, commanded by a popular and energetic nobleman, who spared neither time nor money to render his " Light hfantry" perfe4tion; but all the mounted officers and cap. tains being, like their Colonel, without previous professional instruction, It followed that in 1855-6 the- waa hardly to bo commended for smartne6s on parade or predsion of movement, The advantage3 derived by new levies from the practical knowledge of soldiers who have served long and well being ebvious, it might be expected that everything would bo done to induce suoh skilled workmen to devote their energies to the manufacture of food for powder; but, strange to say, this self-evident truth has often been, and unless the press stir in the matter often will be, disregarded; many flagrant instances of injustioe towards old officers, who, in the hour of need, gave up ease and domestic sweets for the purpose of constructing a regiment out of a crnde mass of unplastle rstics, might be cited. I will, however, content mynyalf with one-ex uno disce omna. A lieutenant-colonel, 'Who a few years ago was in command of a very distinguished Line corps, joined the - Miitia as major; by elaborating the work so ably begun by a noble viscount, whose early decease every militaman deplores, he was largely instrumental in making the battalion one of the moat efficient embodied. In consequence, it might be supposed he wouldi oecasion offering, be certin of his " step ;" not at alL The untimely death referred to above caused the lieutenant. colonelcy to become vacant, and this practised offiecer, with all his qualifications for higher place, was passed over in favour of an en-leutenant of horse of very limited military experience. Again, In the same regiment a major resigns, and two captains, one of whom had served 13 years in the Line, the other nine years, re "topped' by the junlorregimeutal captain I Nor are these isolated examples of impolitlc unfairness. In thq Middlesex, the Inverness, and several other corps, the zealous exertions of ready-made soldiers ha-e bsen repaid in similar base coin. In the Line no junior can be lifted over! the head of a senior, unless that senior be,notorlously and grossly incompetent. Why should so common-sensre * regulation not apply to Militia promotions 7 There is one way, and only one way, of putting a stopper on provincial favouritirm andjobbety. Let the ieldofficers of Militia be appointed directly by the Minister of War, who is responsible to Parliament for the righteousnees of his deeds. Lords-Lieutenant of counties may, perhaps, without harm retain the privilege of rominating captains and "subs," but the " mounted ranks" ought to be above aristocraticmpathieg or influenoe. Until some sch reform becomes law the English Militia will, as a body, fail to attain the effidency of vwhich raw material so excellent is susceptible. I ant, Sir, your obedient wrnvant+ rep. Z.

6LAsuHu4 lV- T aG.-The planter told me something about " negro dogs:" they didn't use foxhounds, but bloodhounds-not pure, he thought, but a cross of the Spanish bloodhound with the common hounds or curs. There were many men he said, in the cotnty below here who make a business of negro hunt. l3g, and they had their horses trained, as well as the dogs, to go over any fence, or if they couldn't leap it to break it down. When hard pushed a negro alvwys took to a tree; sometimes, however, they would catch him in an open field. When this was the case the hnter called off the dogs as soon as ho could, unlees tho negro fought-" that generally makes 'em mad (the hunters), aud they'll let 'em tear him a spelL The owners don't mind having them Idnd o' niggers tore a good deal; runaways ain't much account no how, and it makes the rest more afraid to run away, when they see how they are served." If they caught the runaway within two or three days they got $10 to $20; if it took a longer time, they were paid more than that; sometimes $200. They asked their own price- if an owner should think it exorbitant he supposed they'd turn the niggar loose, order him to nwake off, and teU his master to cate his own niggers. He told of a gentleman of his aciquaintance who had chased a negro' dmest without stopping or eating, for 2! hours. The dogs treed him about 8unrise, and as we gaUoped up to a tree in full speed he was 'not a little exasperated to hear the fellow call ont, with a laugh, " Well. I gin you a right mart run this morning, didn't I ?" This negro was a minister-" these nigger ministers is generally the sauciest niggers."-Correspondence of the Rvew York TrZitnes
THE LATE S&1 GARLES MANSFIBLD OLARKE, BABT. Death has recently carried off one of the most distinguisbed ornaments of the medical profession in the person of Sir CharleB Clarke, who died on Monday, the 7th inst., at hix residence on the Marine Pde, Brighton, in hig 76th year, after a lingering ilnens of uearly two years' duration. Charles Mansfield Clarke, the younger son of the late Mr John Clrke, surgeon, of Ch4ncry-lane, by a daughter of Mr. William Mansfteld, of' Thrapstone, Northamptonshire, was born in London, May 28, 1782, and received the rudiments of his classical education at St Paul's School, where he ws the schoolfellowand, we believe, the playmtte and form-felow of the late Lord Ohanoellor Tiruro and the pre, eot Chief Baron PoTlock, [is father's example led him, at an early age, to turn his attention to medical studeos. and accordligly, instead oi pAxsing to one of the Unierd1 Iis, he attended St. Georges' Hospital, and the lectus on anstomy delivered at the Hunterian School by Mr. 1laon and Mr. Thomna, and those on midwifery by his elder brother, the Iato Dr. John Clarke, who for many yeas enjoyed a most extensive practice in that partioular branch of ,he profession in whioh his younger brother was destined to becoome so distinguished. Having finished his preriminAry studies Charles Clarke was idmitted a*member of the Royal CoDege of Surgeonsi and spent the first two yea of his professional life as ass stant-surgeon in the Hertfordshire Mlitih, which he ubsequently exchanged for the post of surgeon in the 3d Regiment of Foot (nards Of this part of his. early career he always felt proud, and frequently in his later yeas it was his lot to return thanks on public occasion at once for the military and the medical profesion. Subsequently, however, he was Induced by his elder brother to give up the army, and to devote his whole attenilon to the diseaws of women and children, and more particularly o thte practlc4 of midwifery. Hc aWociated with his brother as a lecturer on these sabjects as early as 1804 and eontinued to deliver his regular courses of lectures down to tho year 1821, during which time he could reckon almost all the eminent accoucheurs among his hearers and p:upili Tor many years he held -the *ppointment of surgeon to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, whicb he resigned about the same timen that he ceaed to lecture, though the interests and welfare of that Institution oontinued to the last to be objecti of hIs attention and regardr In 1825 he was chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society. . Hitherto Mr. Clarke had practised bnly as an acoonuieer, in whbch capacity his rise to fame and celebrity had ,bee speedy, if not sudden, though not more so than he well deserved; for no man ever trew himef more zealously Into his professional duties, or showed more tenderness and sympathy in all his dealings with his patients, or more kind- ees sand courtesyto his professtoral rivals. e always had a kind word for every one around him, and even when in the height of his London practice, and when carriages thronged his doors In Saville-row, ho would go on any, dis tant visit to the wife or daughter of a medical gentleman, regardless of the consequences to himself. By these means, aided by his great sagacity and knowledge of the wloridand mankind, he attInud so soid and substantial a position that he was able to retire from the constant cae of his London practice at an p when most men are still climbing up tho hill, and to purchase the estate of Dunham Ledge in Norfolk when he had scarcely passed hIg 40th yr. Having obtained the degree of MlD. from Lambeth, in 1827 Dr. Clarke became a Licentlate of the Royal College of Physicians, and on the accesion of King Wilia IV. to the throne he was honoured by the appointment of physictin to Queen Adelaide. On September 30, 1831, he was created a Baronet, and in the year 1836 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physician. In 1842 he had conferred upon him the honorary degree of MLA. by the University of Cambridge, and wu created a D.C.L. of Oxford in 1845. Inoessantly engaged In the performance of the active duties of a most-laborious department of his profession, Sir Charlea Clarke had not the leisure for many literary pro. ductions, but It is observ9d by no les an authority than .Dr. Pettigrew tn,t the excelleno, of that wrhich he published serves o-ly to awa6ken regret that he should not have written more. His chief work, and that by which his name wil be longesBt remembered among 'medical circles, ig his O s6- iano on tha Disaes oJ Woete,n and Cildren, which he publised in two parts, Inl814asnd.1821resptely and forms an essential part of everymedi library He was President of the Society for the Relief of the Wido s 4dd Orphans of Medical Men, in which he took the deepest lnterest to the last. He was the personal friend of nearly ail the medicl celebrities of the present century, and was be loved by all who knew him, whether In or out of Es profession. Of. late years he had reidded almost entirely at Brighton.

TO THE EDITOR OF TEO TIMES. Sir,-Permit me to make afew remarkx on the letr of a "Fellow of a CoUege" in your impreion of Saturday. It 1J no doubt perfectly true that a sum;lenUy rapid suoceedon might be seured by setting a limito the tenure of a Fellowship, supposing the oondAio of selibacy abolished, But it may fairly be questioaed whether, under the p opoeed system, the suooesslon would be much more rapid than it is at present I beheve tbht at this time the average tenure of FeHowshiDa throughout the University of CAmbridge is not much, if atAll, louger tha ten yeas. if this were tobe fixed sa an invariable limit, thero can be no doubtthat neArlyeveryFeUowshipworad bebld forthe whole permitted period, and so the number of Y*cancies would be but little inreased, and the great bulk oi the studsnts but little benefitted, while to obtain this slight pomible benefit a considerable nunber of deeervTig men would be injured. The present system has the advantage of a oertain degree of flexibility. The strong and vigorous among the Fellows go out into tbe world, and. are able, after a few years, to sapport themselves without the asstance of a Fellowship, But there are quiet, studious men whose habits of mind or physical strength do not fit them to encounter the anxietiws of a perish, the toils of the bar, or the turmol of a school; these, too, would be remorseldly cut offby the Procrusten rule; the very m en who are moct likely to lead happy and useful lives as FeUowg would be lost by being thrown into uncongenial situations; and compelled to engage in astrngl to which they are unequaL They might, perhaps, become CoDege Tutors; but, in the first place, it would be an evil that there should be so strong an inducement for them to accept the office of tutor, whe. ther qualified or not; and, in the seond, accordikg to the sysem which the " FeUow" appears to advocate, the tutor hlmself is not to hold a permanent offlee; he Is to be satis. fied with the chsnce of re-election, which Iaam ahaid would be a very sorry dependence indeed. If there is a diEnculty in obtaining fit men to devoto tbemsreles to the duties of tuition when the College Tator is at least secure of mainte. nance so long as he continues unm%rried, how would this difficulty be increased when the tutor might very possibly bo turned adrift at the expiration of his ten years' Fellow. ship ! For who could be certain of re-election ! I am fully conscious of the disadvantages of the sytm of celibate FeUows; but, after the best consideration I have been able to give to the subject, I am oonvineod that the evils of the present aTe less than those of the proposed systemn. The number of vacancies is at present sufficient to furnish rewards for all the men who ean fairly be condidered deserving; the system adapts Itself readily to the require ments of individusll cases, and it retains i considerablo number of men in the position of Colego Tutors, who, if the rmanency of their office depended on tho votos of the tellows of their College, would most certainly take fiight, I am, Sir.

Sir,-May I ssk a little gpawe for a fevr words with two of your correspondents to-day in the matter of mriied Felows-with " The Resident" and " The Rhpeotant Felow r' The " particular interest" of tbe latter in the eabjot is Ia delicate dinolosure, wbich mat account for bis Lki itous mLthod of mVtung objections with an "of cone or "I flbtly deny it;' but it is ls with the argum6ens thn wilth the statement, of fac and pictres of College life preeeMte in the ktters that I Wish to deal. The grierous Sd Unhappystate of the residents is, a eording to them, matter of great compassion. A few years ago the cry was " that College life was far too comfortable," with an accompaniment of "they ought to be more primitive in discipline, more asoetic," or " they ought to be more truly evangelicaV or " they ought to read and write more, to edit and compile more," according to the vein of the critic. But things are quite changed now-it i all, I Poor fellows, how lonely they must be ! They ought to hsve wives." The "e sident" gravely says. " Marrige is the one topis of conversation among the Fellow, and the one o'ojeot which engages their thonghts." Now, really, if this resident In a resident Fellow, it must be at a very curiou College, and totally unlike any that I have ever entered. I should have said that, while the variety of character, pursuits, and tase which is gthered there bringr up around Colge boards and in Collge wlksl more subjects tha ii any other place beneath the sun, matrimony is at least as raasubjectasanyV Iknow notifIeverheard0ofilthere except under some sch guise as, "Poor A.'s bridecake Well,there'stheendof himJ" or, "Poor B gone, tool Goodbye then to his Vidory of Phttosophy." It may be that of late the general pressing them to get married has made them ask each other if it ig really necessry, but at Jest the sighing brotherhoods of " The Resident" form n.o pert of my College experieones Bnt there is a more erious point os whicb both these gentlmen rely with the utmos'. confidenoe, and one which Is asumed far too readily in most discussions on this nub. jed ; sad that is the supposed incapacity of resident; Fellowm " things now are. It is taken for granted, " that the Fellows who devote themselves to tuition ae seldom the first in ability " and it is supposed that, were they aloowed to marry, the first in ability would devote themselves to tuition. The supposition is inconequential enough, but the assertion on which it rest I believe to be moat untrue. It has gone unchallenged (because thosewhowrertouchod were of conrse slenced at the same time, and beause other people found it no business of theirs) so long that many take it to be a notorious fact. But some one ought to speak at leat, and I csn do so without reserve, because I never took part in College tuition; and I an only say that no Trinity man at Cambridge (for there is nothing like an instanoe) can point to any more distinguished names upon the boards than many of the names of those who in the lst 40 yeanr have been tutors of the College, and that, If any one will tke a oalendar and mark the residents in the lists of Fellows, he will find that, for University distinctions, reputa. fAon for abiity among their contemporaries, and for good aTice niow being done or expocted irom them in the world of letters and zdcene, they need fear no oemparlsor with the non-reddents. And now there ix one more fallcy taken for grunted In these twoletterm, and that is. that FeUows who do mary as a rle marry later in life than other people. It would be vtrange, it true, that men who find themselves started in their profesions at g of from 22 to 25, with 200L a year over and above what other profemional men canu ake should put off marrying longer than their neighbors. But my own observation, and that of others whom I have eon. suted, i that non-resddent Fellows commonly marry rather earlier than other profesdonal men, a might be expected; and I oould show " Bxpectant" by Colloge books that the proportion of those who actually marry, as he desres they should do, at or about 30 is rather larger tha xe magines. One word more s to " vegetating" Fellow, hicel means, I suppose, elderly ones, or those who have pad the tuition. It seems to be forgotten that College esates must be administered; the demands of CoUege vicars, tenants lessees, disoussed and settled; College lawsuits sometimes carried from court to court. Is all this vast (for vast It is) and diffioult business to be intrusted to young and inexperienced men ? If it were, our Colleges would soon be past legislating. Can " Tho E}pectant" point me out better men of business, more able, more energetic, and at the as-e time more liberal administrators of great properties than the bursr, of the Colleges ? The images of sevenl such, and of their busy, ueful lives, will recur to aU men familiar with the Uxniversitis The gratitude not of great Colleges only, but of large districts in England, is due to them. And they a t speciuens of their " classC- "the vegetating cla'-wrhicb Is " to ceaso to exist," and ought to have ceaed to exist for the Univerty, according to thee views, ten yea ater they became Fellows Thank God it has been otherwise.

THx RAILWAY ACODKa AT MgAIT .-On Tueeday an investigation took place into the circumstanoes at. tending the aocident which ooenned to the London excurzion train on ite arrival st the Margte staton of the South. Eastern Railway on Monday afternoon. Notwithtnding the lmpression whioh first prevailed that the injuries to the passengers were of a trivial character, it now turns ott that, in addition to those who had their cuts and wounds dreoed, and were enabled to return to town by the up excursion train, there are 10 or 12 persons Ot re maining in Margast under the care of surgons. It appears that when the excursion train arrived at Ramsgate that portion of the train destined for Margate, oon. adsting of four oone carriages and the break van, was detached, and to t?6rn the ordinary Margate tran consisting of four other carriages, was attachod, making tihe tran thus consist of eight pasenger cAniages, the break van, and the engine. At the argate sttion there is an incline in the direction of the station of 1 in S0, to the extent of 3,114 yards. At the top of this incline are the switches, and it is the duty cf the engine-driver, prior to reaching It, to leave the train and go behind, and then push tho train over the bank on to the mdline, when it reaches the station by its owrn ipetus, regulated in its speed by the breaks. The engine having left the train, it is the duty of the pointsman to uncouple the ordina Margate train from the excursiontrain, sending theonedow-uthe inolineone road, and the other on to the line leading to the opposite side of the station, On the arival of this train on Monday the switch. man, with his assistant, having place,d the pointa in the rikht direction uncouplod the London from the Ramsnate train, and the former was pushed by the engine over tKe inoline. The break being in front the switchman had no knowledge that the guard was not in It, and he therefore, as usual, jumped on to the step of the last carriage, so as to be in readiness to open the doors and assist the passengers out on the train drawing up at the platform. The moment the train reached the ktation itsvelocity left no doubt that a oollision with the end of the station would be inevitable, and he jumped off. In an instant afterwards the crash occarred. Among the s5fferers whose nnes and injuries have been ascertained aro the following :-Mr. Kidd, surgoon, of London, concussion of the brain-going on favourablyMrs. Lovesay, of 65, Bereaford-streot, Walworth, oontu nose, forehead, and aoerated lip-doing well; Mmrs Drew and famil7, consisting of two boys-cuts and bruises about the head and fwea; elder boy contused eye and face cut; younger boy, injury to the hip and other bruises; Xr. 3mith, of Camberwrell, various injuries about the head and body; dr. W. Early and Mr. J. L laing, cuts and contusions; and a ehild with its tongue ct. The whole ol the patients are reported to be progressing favourably. smRxrr-Last n ht, at a meeting of the board of governora and directors of the united prishes of St Andrew Holborn, and St. Geor the-Martyr, held at the board room, Gray's-inn laie, Jk. Bagger in the chair, Xr. Watson movrd a reolution-" That a Oommitteo be ap. pointed to wait upon the Board of Works for this district and for the district of Clerkenwell, to urge upon them the. necesity of their pressing th eorporation of the City of London to take active measures to encourag the covering of the wast groun in Saffron-biIl. St. Sepulchre, and vicinity, as spedily as poasible." EiL reason for bringing forward the resolution was the great ianury the neighbourhood sustained from so many uonuse being pulled down, snd the ground allowed to lie waste for such a log period, of whieh his neighbours deeply complained. The probability of the Metropolitan Railway Com- n y requirinDg the ground was now at an end, as the Great Northern Raimy Company, on aooount of the Redatlx swindle, and the Great restern on account of the dliI.nu. tion of their diridend, were unable to assist the 3Metropoli. tan Railway Company in carrying out their scheme. Erroi his experience of the corporation of London thoy were very slow coaches unless pushed on, The Act for making the new street was passed 20 years ago, and when the Clerkenvell commissioners could not carry it out it was transferred to the city, and an additional tax hlid u ctt coals to defray the cost, Po that the corporation were acting as trustees for the benefit of the public. It had been com- pted that 1,C00 houses had been pulled down for maling he now street, which, at an average of 10 persons to a house, made a population of 16,000 persons displaced to seek a home elsowhere, but some had estimated the numbor of persons living in these at four times that amount, and the money they expended v-s very Important to the neighbourhood. This depopuation, had cauned a great increase in tho local taxation upon the remaining inhabitants. There was the strongest necessity for pressing the corporation t+ sel the land for building, to completo the improvements for the beuefit of the publio and put an end to the injury snatained by Its non-completion.

LJONDON, 'HURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1857. We have several times expressed our belief that England possessed an army of reserve in the military spirit and the various social infLuences that might at any time be appealed to for the purpose. What is most coveted in this country, more than wealth, more than talent, more than fame, more even than power, is aristocratic position, to obtain or improve which other things are only sought as the means. So strong in the aristocratic influence that it is recognized as a necessity in our Army, and the most practical men assume that the officers to lead Englishmen must be gentlemen. The necessity is no; without its cost, for no doubt the Army could be made a more popular institution by promotion from the ranks and other approaches to the continental system. But if our Army must be aristocratic,-if our nobility and gentry muit have a turn in their favour, then let Us have the full ibenefit of a principle not altogether without its disadvantages. Let us draw upon it, as one of our national resources, and let the young lord or gentleman give us something in return for his rapid promotion. Such we conceive to be the estimate of aristocratic influence among us, on which the Horse Guards now offers commissions to those otherwise qualified young gentlemen who can raise a hundred recruits for Han MArasTya service. The offer appears to us as fair as it is seasonable, for if anybody conceives that he has a right by virtue of his social position to rise to rank or command more quickly than others of equal age, education, and personal merit, he cer'tainly ought to be able to prove that pretension. For our part, we entirely subscribe to the opinion that the cadet of a noble house, a mau of historic name, accustomed to the homage of tenantry, and born in habits of command, is far more likely to be respected and followed by the common soldier than the young gentleman who merely buys a commission to escape the dulness of the parsonage, the surgery, or the countinghouse. But we believe this, because we believe in social influence, in position, in local and traditional feelings. We also believe, then, that it is possible to draw on those feelings for the more speedy filling of the immense gap just made in our Army at home by our Indian reinforcements, It is only an appUcation of the principle that "property has its duties as well as its rights." There was a time when the Army was entirely a territorial affair, and there is hardly a regiment of the Line which was not raised originally by a landowner or a neighbourhood. It must be at least as possible now, when estates are as large, as wealthy, and ought to be as populous, as they were a century or two ago. This sort of influence goes a great way in our Parliamentary representation, and in the distribution of the small patronage at the disposal of Government. It goes a great way in general estimation. We hear of such a one's "c ountry," or such a one's " people," as much as in the days when a name, a token, a cry, a beacon light, would summon hundreds or even thousands to the war. It takes a long time to eradicate these feelings, and but a short time has elapsed since they were all-powerful. The story of Chevr Chase., when PEncY went a-hunting with 1,500 archers, and was met by DOUGLAS with 2,000 spearmen, is only four times further back than the life of a gentleman who died the other day in Oxford; and, indeed, we need go back little more than a century for very similar scenes. But clanship is now all the talk of the day. Nobody cares for the 100,0001. a-year which may be derived from collieries, ironworks, houses, or a canal. The ideal of a great man is now the owner of a county, a considerable island, or any district in which you can ride a hundred miles ahead over your own land. All this we conclude to be real. We suppose the Braemar gatherings, and such assemblies, to be solid and manly realities,-something more, at least, than the showy spectacles we may see any day on the metropolitan stage. The tartan must mean something. Manly games should make men. Nor should Ireland be wanting. Where are the stout Protestant tenantry, of whom we have heard so much; and the Protestant nobility, whom it was thought worth so much to preserve in territorial influence, and who certainly are not the worse for the treatment their country has received at the hands of the Legislature? Something ought to come of all this. A territorial House of Parliament, a territorial magistracy, ought now to be good for something. The public, too, which barely acquiesces in the existing system of military promotion, and is occasionally staggered by a chance disclosure, will take it much more kindly when it finds there is good reason. It does not quite like to hear of Lord This or the Hon. Mr. ThaA jumping at a very early age, and after very scant serviee, over the heads of men who might belong to a proscribed Rcaste, for any chance of promotion they seem to be allowed. It strikes people sometimes as rather hard that because a man is the son of a lord or a great gentleman, therefore he should expect to have something else added to it, such as the rank due to a meritorious soldier. The hardship, however, will disappear, or be much mitigated, if the fortunate youth brings not only his own noble presence, but also a hundred stont men at his heels. TALSOT may be a very small man, and a very insignificant one, but when his virtual bulk extends to a company, making up for his own want of sinew, his own short inches, and more slender frame, all will hail him in his collective capacity as the captain of his own gallant company, a true British Centurion, contributing to make the Army as well as command it. We want men with this sort of influence. We want chiefs who witl be followed tlthough fire and water. Doubtless we have such ale .dy; but the disproportionate lons of officers in mist of our buttles certainly suggests a misgiving that they are not always followed quite as promptly as they might be. How would a hundred of my Lord's retainers, bred and born within sight of his castle, like to return, most of them safe and sound, but with a lame story of the young Lord being rather too venturesome, having pushed on rather too far, and having esuffered the penalty of his rashness ? We feel confident that the appeal will not be made in vain. The Duke of CAx,%mRwo and Lord PAwMUXE have not over-estimated the territorial influence of our gentry, or the strength of the relations between them and their tenantry, and over all within their influence. The proposition will have a double effect. It will lead some of our grandees to go to their estates, and to court even the good opinion of the neighbouring towns, instead of confining their solicitations to military circles. They must make their own promotion. " You " want the command of a company, Sir ? Where "is it?" Thiswill simplify mattersimmensely atthe Horse Guards, where a good reply is sometimes in request. Then what a start for a man to have! What a claim to future consideration I What an event in the annals of the family! How it wMll read on the memorial tablet, not to speak of the Peerage I Satirists and cynics sometimes smile at this sort of thing, for, in fact, it is often rather hollow ; but nobody will dare smile at the captain of a hundred men 'of his own raising,-at all events, if they should ever have the opportunity of showing what he and they are made of.

The country will doubtless appreciate this act, and feel it as more than a complimentas an expression of sincere sympathy with us in a very trying and painful crisis. It is the more important and the more significant as coming from a neighbour, and from a neighbourwhose national and whose family traditions are all antagonistic to England. Border lands, as France and England may be caDcd-for the narrow sea between us hardly makes that an inappropriate term-have never been celebrated for getting on very well together, and we and our neighbours across the Channel have exhibited, perhaps, as strong a specimen of these border relationships as any two countries in the world have. For about a thousand years we have taken advantage of each other's difficulties, and been jealous of each other's prosperity. All the traditions of the two countries regarding each other are belligerent, and warlike relations have all the prestige of antiquity on their side. Oldfashioned folks among us even now can hardly realize that there is a change, and half suspect the new relationship of the two countries as an innovation upon established principles, as a lawyer dreads reform in Chancery, and Deans and Chapters dread Church reform. When things have gone in a certain way for a certain time there are always plenty of people to say that it is a law of nature, an ordinance of PRovmETcu, and that it is impiety and blasphemy to attempt alteration. This is the kind of mischief that good sort of people do in the world,-worthy, exoellent people, who are always for things being as they have been. They do more harm, perhaps, than twice the number of scoundrels and profligates. There are plenty of this old stock now, we doubt not, in this country, who think friendship with France is all nonsense and moonshine, and who go back with fond sentiment to the days when we cut each other's throats, and when a Frenchman and Englishman were natural enemies, as exhibiting the true normal and providential attitude of the two nations to each other. This was the state of things then between France and England. It required a strong, original, and independent mind to break through such a prejudice and set up a new type of relationship. A French and English alliance was a new idea, which it required boldness to embrace. A new international idea, like a new financial idea, a new principle of currency, or a repeal of the Corn Laws, requires a statesman's thorough and determnined confidence in his own judgment. This has been the EMPERoR's discovery. Louis PnrrrruIrs policy was, indeed, a precedent which assisted him in arriving at it, but he has given a force, a development, and a solidity to the idea which has made it substantially his own. France and England, then, we say, have been neighbours for a thousand years and more, and perhaps this is the first time in history when England was in a difficulty and our neighbour did not think it her bounden duty to take advantage of it. We will not ascend to the days of the PLANTAuENETS or TUDORs, but a later parallel, or rather contrast, will perhaps occur to many of us. We do not for a moment mean to compare the revolt of our NorthAmerican colonies to this Indian Mutiny; the two movements wholly differ in their general character, grounds, and the parties conducting them ; but the two events are so far alike that both were revolts, and that in each case there are the endeavour to recover the lost allegiance and great efforts on the part of the nation. But what was our neighbour's conduct at the former event ? LAFAYETTE was sent to assist the American revolters. This was in accordance with the maxims of the day. One nation, as a matter of course, took advantage of the other's difficulties; there was no other idea but that of mutual injury. In curious contrast withthis act of France at the American revolt we have now at this Indian revolt a strong expression of the sympathy of France with us. We have the name of the EMPEROR at the head of our Subscription Fund for the relief of the sufferers from this Mutiny. This is France and England in the middle of the 19th century. By the force of circumstances a despotic Sovereign, the Emperor Lours NAroLxof is still a man of the age. He is not a man to bow to old ideas-not even to NAPoLEoNIc ideas; he thinks for himself. He has been an observer and a watcher of the signs of the times, and his powers of observation have been, perhaps, not a little aided by the fact that he is not a talker, and does not waste his energy in expression. In spite of all his reverence for his uncle, the peaceful policy of Louis PHILIPPE has obviously made an impression upon him, and he has in fact adopted it with a sincerity which with LoUIs PILPPB was impossible. He sees that, however great a man in his own day, the first NAPOLEON was not the man for this day; that military aggrandizement and glory are not now the ideas of educated France, which wants peace, prosperity, and order more than empty splendour, accompanied by conscriptive decimation. Louis NAPoLEox has succeeded a man who was ostentatiously a man of the age, and he takes the place in the train of events as it moves on to which Louis PHIPnP aspired, and carries out the existing policy and satisfies the existing needs and objects of France. The age has changed. The old NAPOLEON would be simply " a bore" to the French now; they do not want his grandeur and omnipotence; they want rest, comfort, and stability, and they are quite in the right. The world has had enough of conquerors. We admire them exceedingly; they make splendid heroes of historical romance; we like reading about them ; but we had rather for the future do without them. This compliment and expression of sympathy comes with the more grace from the Emperor IouIs NAPoLEoN from the fact of his own former residence among us, and is the more gratifying to us on that account. It is something if a very sagacious and observant man does not like us the less from having lived among us. We may fairlye hope that some of the goodwill he has shown was earned by us during his residence among us, and that his public acts of sympathy do not express a policy only, but also a feeling. A man whose personal life has been, in fact, such a romance can hardly fail to have peculiar feelings towards those who saw and knew him in his preliminary stage, before he had risen to greatness; and, if those feelings are not hostile and bitter, they are sure to be mixed with a pleasing sentiment. If a Bishop goes back in memory to his first curacy, a millionaire to his first clerlmship, and a lawyer to his first brief, with something of sentimental pleasure, an Emperor will not unnaturally have the same kind of feeling for the sCenes which witnesaed his early struggles and efforts, when the scheme of future empire was only an embryo conception in his mind, a dream which fed the imagination, rather than a practical and- solid expectation. MIany a misty outline of a project, and many a dim and cloudy shape in the political horizon,the offspring of calculating and scheming thought, -many an absorbing speculation, and many a dawning hope, must be associated in the EMPERones mind with Piccadily and Sheen-park. These scenes will recall to him that stage of life which is so dear to the memory of great men-the early and comparatively obscure stage which prepared them for their subsequent success. These feelings may or may not enter into the tERzoR's present expression of sympathy with the English nation, but, at any rate, such an act shows that we do not stand at any disadvantage from his close acquaintance with us.
In the midst of the exciting topics which war and mutiny have created, a question has arisen which, within a limited circle, is regarded with great interest, and which is by no means without its importance to the public at large. In its immediate relations it concerns simply the tenure on which Fellowships should hereafter be held in the University of Cambridge, but the decision of the controversy will involve consequences more rerious and extensive than the general reader might at first sight be ready to suppose. Under the system hitherto pursued Fellowships, at the option of the possessors, are tenable for life, but are vacated by marriage, by the acceptance of church preferment, or by accession to property of a certain amount. In value these emoluments range usually from 1501. to 2001. a-year, in addition to which income, advantages amounting almost to free quarters attend actual residence in College. It is by the operation of these primes upon the ambition and energies of the student that the whole standard of academical learning is determined. Fellowships are given to those men who take the best degrees, or, in other words, who obtain the highest places in the periodical examinations; the competition for such endowments produces an extraordinary development of intellectual power, and the result is that the general scale of attainments is kept at a most remarkable height. It is obvious that these good effects could only have been secured by a perfect integrity of dealing, and, as a matter of fact, the distribution of these numerous and valuable appointments has been conducted with a purity almost unexampled. If patronage could be administered in all cases with equal success, one of the most difficult problems of the age would have received its solution. It has been now proposed by certain members of the University, largely represented in our columns, that the condition of celibacy should be abrogated, and a mnemorial has been addressed to the University Commissioners bespealdng their attention to the point. To appreciate the bearing of the question, the reader must understand that the practical operation of the condition referred to has not been to keep this number of successful scholars uinmarried for life, but to make them vacate their Fellowships in rapid succemsion for the benefit of others. Of Fellows of Colleges, as a body, probably not a much greater proportion remains single than would be found in any other corresponding class of society. There are always old bachelors everywhere, and there are, of course, sorle at the Universities; but such is the effect of intellectual training, and such perhaps the operation of the restraint itself upon human nature, that College Fellows have been actually represented as marrying, upon an average, at an earlier period of life than any other men in the same rank of society, not being possessed of independent means. So clearly, indeed, is the value of these results discerned, that the advocates of the projected chango propose to meet the disadvantages which it would otherwise produce by making Fellowships absolutely terminable at the end of a certain period. If they could be held for life and yet admit of nmarriage, they would only be vacated by death, and consequently the benefits above described as arising from these endowments would be in a great measure lost. As there would but rarely be a Fellowship to compete for, the stimulus to exertion would be diminished accordingly, and the great motive power of the University would be seriously impaired. If Fellows are to marry, Fellowships must be terminable. That is a conclusion which it is impossible to avoid; and the question is whether the probable results of these two changes, when weighed one against another, will yield such a balance of general advantage as to warrant the alteration. After a careful consideration of the subject, we must repeat our opinion that the disadvantages of the scheme would preponderate; that Fellowships would suffer in estimation; that the privilege of contracting matrimony without immediate loss of preferment would be of little real value; and that the system of the University in one of its very best features would be uselessly disturbed. We observed the other day that the condition of celibacy imposed upon a Fellow involved in reality no compulsion whatever. No man, or at least not one in a thousand, regards a Fellowship as a settlement for life. On the contrary, it has been remarked that the first impulse of a Fellow, after obtaining his preferment, is to consider how he can get rid of it. It is not an end, it is only the means to an end; and, even if we assume that the end in question neeesarily involves marriage, a Fellow of a College does certainly not appear in any unfavourable position. He gets his Fellowship in most cases about the age of 23 or 24; as a matter of course, he is a man of more than average ability; he is trained to exertion, invigorated by success, and fortified by the possession of a small independent income to aid him in the continuance of his efforts. Now if, with all these advantages, he cannot outstrip the common crowd of competitors in acquiring-what for the argumenfs sake we assume to be the common object-an establishment and a wife, the result must surely be surprising. lWhatever may be theoretically desirable on such a subject, it is perfectly certain that among educated classes the age of 30 is considered quite early enough for a prudent marriage, and it is seldom indeed that it can be judiciously anticipated by any man who has had to get his living by his own brains. In these respects, therefore, a Fellow of a College labours under no disability at all. His preferment, even if there were no bar to his marriage, would not enable him to *upport a wife and family of his own rank; but it will and does give him an advantage over others in competing for better provision. There is nothing in the state of modem society to prevent any man with a determined will and reasonable desires from marrying after six or seven years' exertion, and the Fellow of a College not only shares the common opportunities in this respect, but enjoys also a special assistance from the income which he has acquired. On the other hand, if, in order to invest Fellows with the very shadowy privilege of marrying upon an annuity of 150, terminable after the tenth year of payment, the life tenure of a Fellowship is in every case to be demolished, we cannot but think that these prizes-hitherto so powerfully effective-will lose much of their value and consequence at the very time when, owing to the opening of otheravenuestodistinction,itisespeciallydesirable that the Universities should preserve their attractions unimpaired. The very essence of a Fellowship consists in the seourity and permanence of the provision. It is perfectly true -that men do not design to keep it, or actuaUy keep it, in the great proportion of cases, for even such a length of time as would be allowed under a system of terminability; but what is most precious about a Fellowship is the thought that a subsistence has been gained which can be terminated only when the possessor himself, of his ovn free will, thinks fit to dispense with it. This is the reflection which gives the preferment its value, and this the prospect which gives learning its stimulus. In practice the tenure is very limited indeed. A correspondent the other day mentioned 13 years as about the average; we have seen a much shorter period fixed, and the term we believe has been for some time on the decline. Finaly, the proposed change could only be effected at the cost of very extensive disturbance in nany parts of the academical system. We cannot at present enter into the details which have been laid before us, nor would they, indeed, possess much interest for the public; but obstacles-not, perhaps, absolutely insurmountable, yet exceedingly serious-would present themselves at every step. Under such circumstances we are not surprised that the scheme, regarded as a whole, should have failed to find general favour even with that very class whose disabilities are alleged to be concerned. From the statistics which we have received we do not infer that a majority of the Fellows of Colleges are disposed to support the memorial presented to the Commissioners, and, for ourselves, we confess to a concurrence with the dissentients. The system of Fellowships has worked so well, upon the whole, both within the University and without; it has stimulated study to such good purpose, and turns out yearly into the world a body of clever men under circumstances so well calculated to make them labour for the only privilege denied them, that we should sincerely regret to ee it disturbed for the sake of what we cannot but regard as a most equivocal advantage.

HARIvzsT Ho,m.-On Thursclay, the 3d of September, the second aunnual celebration of the Harvest Home, on that better principle which we hope in time to see generally adopted by all parishes, took place in the village of Buxton, near Norwich, underanices far more favourable than the heavy rains of the preceding day bad led us to expect, and with asucceSS equato that which attended the festivities of last year on a similar occaeion, having been honoured with the presence of the Lord Bishop of the diocess, who had accepted the invntation of the Rev. W 3. Stracey, vicar of the parish. The sun gave its warmth and cheerfulness to the scene, wbich was one of animation, epe Cisly in the grounds of the vicarage, where a capacious tent had been gaily prepared for the entertnment of nearly 500 guests, and where a pretty triumphal arch was erected over the entrance to the law At 10 a.m. the larg aembly of labourers, with their wives and children, met together at the Lodge Farm, where a prooession was formed, headed by a capital bras band provided by Messrs Colins, of Lamas Which was followed by a car, bearing an ornamented wheat sheaf, then came some of the children belonging to the national school, and after them the different companies attached to the farms in the parishes of Buxton and Oxnead, each one preceded by their chief, carrying a banner, on which was painted a suitable motto. On entering the village church the large concourse of people were conducted to their seats by the churchwardens, and we could not bal admire the simple, but tasteful decorations which had been made-the screen entwined with corn, the piUars wreathed with oak leaves and acorns, and tho white banners, on which, in red letters, were inscribed appro priate texts from Scripture, and were crowned ith chaplets of wheatears, arranged on either side of the vwhole length of the church. as soon as the bells had ceased the national anthem was weU performed as the opening Voluntary, while the officiating clergy, followed by the Lord Bishop of the diocess, walked to their respectivo seats The daily morning prayer was read by the vicar, the musical portions of the service being sustained by the parish choir, who in singing the chorus "Tho Heavens are teUing," talken from Haydn's Crcation, exhibitod such a precision and skill as must rank them far superior to the standard ordinarily attained by our country choim While the 100th Psalm was being sung the Bishop ascended the pulpit, and at its conclusion 1 ,roceeded to delIvor, from the text, Isaiah, 9th chapter, 3d verse, ' They joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest," a most eloquaent and impressive sermon, which was listened to throughout with the deopest attention. Bis Lordship, in addition to treating tho subject with special reference to the happy occasion, and setting before hiS hearers the nature and cause of true Christian thankfulness, concluded his most exceUent discourse with a persuasive appeal in behalf of the two great Church Missionary Societies, representing it to the congregation as a most fitting opportunity for rendering a thankoffering to the gracious Giver of all our spiritual and temporal blessings. The appeal was liberally responded to by a collection of upwardsof 8L, which was equally divided bet een the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the ChuK Missionary Society. At the concludon of the service the young organist performed the Hallelujah Chorus, and the merry peal again rang forth from the old church tower, while the procession was reformed as before, and proceededthrou h the -Allage to the vicarago lawn, where soon the ample supply of roast beef, plum pudding, and ale vanished at the attacl of nearly 500 guests. When grace had been said by the vicar at the end of the repast "The Herlth of the Queen" was given with three times three, and the choir singing the national anthem. TheRev. Willia Strace, then rose and proposed "The Health of the Bishop," to which his Lordship immediately replied in terms which won the attention, as wllU as the hearts, of all, assuring his hearers of the pleasures he was experiencing on this the first occasion of his presence at a harvest home of the kind, concluding his remarks with the presentation of the first two prizes on the list, a Bible and a Prayer-book, addressing the aged recipients in most kind and impressive language. The next tost, given by Mr. John Wright, who headed the table on the right of the vicar, was " The Health of the Committee," to whose praiseworthy efforts were' mainly attributable the arrangements and success of the day, and here, too, the party constantly evidenoed thelr pleaure by repeatedly cheering the warm and hearty expressions ooming from so old and rerted a parishioner. A harvest song was then sung by the choir, and thanlm were briefly returned by members of the committee. Too last toast of the day, which was admirably given by lr. T. R. Allen, was "The Health of the Labourers and their Wives and Families," to which a venerable parlshioner of their own class responded. The band, with its enlivening strains, now attracted the people outside tho tent, and *fter due time bad been allowed for the indulgence of the smokers the sports began, consisting of foot-racing, wheeling barrows blindfolded, jingling matches, throwirng weights, &c. to the winners in which prizes of some value were distributed, such as agricultural implements, gowns for their wives, waistcoats, &c. After tea and buns had been partnken of a very superior display of fireworks was exhibited by Mr. Baxter, of Norwich, and this concluded the fesivltiesofthe day, inwhich both highaudlowwould aeemto bave shared. The numerous party quietly isparated to their respectivehomes, aftor having given three hearty cheer for their vicar; and thus ended a very happy day, blessed, we trust, by God, sanctioned by the cordil support of the bishop of the diocess, and profitable in many ways to the labounng poor,

The conduct of the Presbyterian clergyman wlho undertook the duty of preaching in the open airwn Sunday last is thus commented upon by the BeZf st Mercury : " This Mr. Hnnas is young Paqyrk Wmi*, r_o is a light unto tho Berry-street congreption-a pert of the town in which light is much wanted in more snss tha one. At the meeting of the Belfast Prebytery, the other day, the question of street-preaching was moote, and ihe unmietakeable feeling of the body was that without Compromising any rights whatever it woua be more adiar. able to refrain from their exercise Under present cruastances But Xr. Eanna 'had a call-he Ifelt It binudig on his conscience to ssert his constitational zihtVProtestant liberty was in danger, and he for one wo d inot prore an unfaith fal watch dog. He is one of those getleme n who are obviously infinitely above reoeiving a;r adnoo. ean on Sunday, when about to commence Its 8Sf vice, Mr. J. Clarke, one of the most respectable and most respected magistrates in the town, suggested to him that it would be better not to persist in preaching; but the friendly suggestion was repudiated, and we fancy becatst it s seen that a large number of Protestnts had a . aembled to protect him. The ship carpenters, wll armed, mustered In force, and when the rioting commenced, they drove the Romanist mob before them. Mr. Hanp ininitely to his own stWEaction, was thus enabled to close his discourse, which must have had an edifyiig effect, consideriug the Christian frame of mind that prevailed around Mm. When Mr. Clarke suggesed thit Mr. Hanna should not persist in preaching, the reply was, that bhe came there to assert his rights,' and that 'S e considered it the duty of the magistrates to protect him in the exercie of those rights' Now, wa say it is nio part of magisterial duty to do any soch thing; aud tEa sooner Mr. Hanna and those who are prepared to act with as little discretion as he has displayed disbase their minds of such a fallacy the better it will be, perhaps, for themseles There is no law that imn pmes such a duty on a magistrate-that makes any eiffrence between the protection to be afforded to a street-preacher and to a street walker. We are all entitled to magisterial protection-that is, to theyrotection of the law when about our lawful buines; and just o much tection, and not an iota more, is Mr. Hanna entitled If he imagines that the magistrates ar bound to order out the police, the constabulary, and the military, horse and foot, to protect him he iS very sdly mistaken They have no right wrhatever to do so-it would be an excion of duty on their part to act in such a manner. When a riot occeis they have a right to quell it-that their daty imposes on them; but antil a riot does take place they have no busintess wrhatever to interfere," Meanuwhe, it would appear that matters are not likely to settle down in Belfist for some time to come. A correspondent of a Roman Catholic journal supplies the following particulars with respect to the gun club movement in the "Irish Mancheste":- "t The Gun Club met on Thursday evening. It has been stated that some perty who got a knowledge of tHe club, without intending to serve it, pve Information to the police respecting the names of certain parties who had joined it, quite forgettin& as he must have done, that, as Belfast is not a proclaimed district, it is perfectly legal for every man to have a gun or guns for the defence of his life and the protection of his property, and that the mere taking down of names of gun club members bytho polioe either on information obtained by themselves or through the ageucy of a spy is a work of supererogation as the law stands at present, A quick-witted member of the gun dub resolved upon 'doing' the spy, put down, it appeas, in a book a number of the most extraordinary names, not one of which any member of the club konoi and the spy made the laughable mistsako of copying out a51 these names ndhanding them over to the police, who no doubt w11 hare great trouble in finding out men who do not exist Tho club have adopted an excellent plan of balloting for guns, specimens of which, and of the very beet description, waere exhibited.

However, till thedanger is past the Catholics are resolved uron being united.

SECOND EDITIONL. THE TIMES-OFFICE, Thursdazy Morning. EXPRESS FROMI PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris corre$pondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), G p.m.:- The Cowstitutionnel of to-day gives a long and interesting account of the Camp at Chalons, swhere -the grand manceuvres, prevented on Sunday by bad vweather, commenced on Monday. The lrench 4soldier, as is well known to all who have had opportunities of observing him, is an ingenious, handy. .ud restless individual, with a great notion of the -ornamental, and something of the child in his compositlon. Encamp him where you please, in an Algerine desert or a Crimean waste, and as soon as Lis tent is pitched and his pot boiling he applies him 43elf to the decorative arts. The nearest copses are Iald under contribution, grasslands and valleys are -stripped of turf and flowers; nilniature gardens are laid out, summer-houses are built of branches, pebbles are arranged in mosaic work of fanciful -emblems and military devices, partition walls of sods or loose stones are crowned with Lilliputian turrets end minarets. The soldierhas abundant leisure, and -te employs it much as a schoolboy would occupy his liolydays were his materials of amusement equaUy restricted. The Camp of Chalons wears an austere aspect; such puerile pastimes would be incon.sistent with its object, and perhaps beneath the dig. nity of the glite of the French army, the Imperial Guard of Napoleon III. " This camp," said the Emperor in his order of the day of August 30, " is not a vain spectacle offered to public curiosity, but a serious school, which we shall know how to render profitable iby sustained work, and whose results would be evident if ever your country should have need of you." It has been questioned whether, immediately after -the termination of a war, than which a severer practical school could hardly have been afforded to the soldier, this camp of manceuvres was necessary. The -Constitutionnel recalls the fact that the siege of Sebastopol, an operation unparalleled in military bistory, and the like of which may never be seen again, admitted of the employment of troops only under particular, and, for the most part, very unusual circumstances, and was far from including all the combinations of ordinary wars. The experienco of the Crimea may have displayed the excellence of the French army, and shown it equal to the rudest trials, but this is not to be acoepted as a reason for allowing repose to weaken its military spirit. The example of .Prussia, Austria, and Russia is cited in support of the utility of great military evolutions in time of peace; evolutions which are even more useful to genzerals and officers commanding regiments than to the soldiers themselves, whose instruction might be per. fected by exercises in smaller bodies. Algeria can no longer be considered a sufficient school for the French army. Henceforward there is little probaisility of its affording other practice than that cf skirmishes and coups de main, useful for young subalterns and soldiers, but of little profit for officers of the higher grades. Under the peaceable Government of Louis Philippe, and as far back as 1842, a camp at (Chalons was projected. 37 battalions, 64 squadrons, ,4 batteries, and a pontoon train were to assemble In the same plains now occupied by Napoleon's guard, and to rehearse some of the operations of the campaign of 1814. A melancholy event, the death of the Duke of Orleans, caused the design to be postponed, and it is only now revived and executed. No ground could be better adapted to the purpose to which it is applied. It is a vast tract of barren land, thinly sprinkled with stunted pines, 5nd sufficiently elevated to ens3ure a pure atmo. sphere. The tract appropriated to the manoeuvre3 is 14,000 hectares in extent. Everything aboat the camp is of the plainest description and aspect-it looks like work, not play. There is no luxury or display about the Emperor's quarters, which are painted of the colour of the tents. Beside them is a quadrangular pavilion, open on all four sides, and under which mass is celebrated every Sunday. The want of foliage gives rather a dreary appearance to the whole scene, and is relieved only by an undtlatinig line of fine trees that marks the course of the little river Cheneu, which winds through the camp. To avoid anything like confusion, the strictest regulations were enforced on the establishment of the camp. Every tent had its place marked, and had to be pitched there, in defiance of local drawbacks. Tt was the business of its occupants to level uneven ground, to turn aside an inconvenient rivulet, to make the best of the spot allotted to them. WeUs, supplied with pumps, and yielding excellent water, have been dug all along the rear of the camp. Those soldiers .Who are taken seriously ill are sent to Chalons, 'Where an hospital of 650 beds has been prepared to receive them; slighter maladies are treated in the camp hospitals. Every detail is investigated by the Emperor, who, even when the weather is too oad for the troops to go out, is seen riding and driving about, visiting stores and hospitals, and 'witnessing the distribution of rations. One of the advantages of the situation of the Chalons camp is its distance from towns and large villages. The soldier is not intruded upon and his attention distracted from his duties by crowds of visitors. Permissions to visit the encampments are very sparingly given, but any civilian 'who is accompanied by an officer may circulate without impediment. The men are so fully employed that -they have not a great deal of time to spend at the canteen, or at the numerous cafes, wine houses, and restaurants that have sprung up at the neighbouring village of Grand Mourmelon. A speculative individual supplies officers with 'what little fturiture they require for their tents at a charge of 25f. or 30f., for the time they are to pass there. The railway, which was to have been opened on the 5th inst., is not yet ainished, and it is not very easy to get to the camp, but nevertheless there was a tolerable assemblage of spectator, at the manceuvres on Monday, which were commanded by the Emperor. The health of the troops is good, and is likely to continue so, thanks to the sanitary precautions taken. The men are well lodged and fed, the straw they sleep on is frequently changed, and vegetable markets have been estaiblished at the nearest villages. The number of men assembled, including gendarmes, persons belonging to the administration of the army, &c., is close upon 23,000, and of horses, 6,000. This is more 1fan double the number of men at Satory in 185>4 and 1855, and more than three times as many as those who were brought together at St. Omer at the same periods. The manceuvres on Monday lasted four hours; they are stated to have been very well executed, the weather was beautiful, and the only drawback -was an accident to two artillerymen, who were 'wounded by a rammer, driven out by the premnature discharge of a cannon. The Emperor's health is reported excellent, and he seems to be enjoying bhimself at the head of his Guards, who, on their part, appear highly gratified by his constant presence among them, and by his solicitude for their comfort and wellbeing. The firing practice with the howitzer invented by His Majesty is to commence to-day. The piece, which is a 12-pounder, was lately cast at Toulouse. Its great merit, if it proves ouccessful, is that from it can be discharged all the classes of projectiles commonly used in the field. The Minister of Marine, Admiral Hamelin, is exVected in Pari on Sunday, He will rewain but one Iday, aiiQ wil pass the remainder of the vacation in I Normandy. It is said that Admiral flergeret,lately deceased, will be succeeded, as senator, b7 RearAdmiral Bouvet, born in 1775, and who acTaired great popularty in the navy by his many engagements in the Indian Seas. The papers state that more than 4,000 old soldiers have applied for the medal of St. Helena, in the department of the Ardeche, and 3,500 in that of the Drome. If the same proportion were to be found in all the departments of France-which is not to be supposed-this would give an enormous number of survivors of the Imperial armies; to say nothing of the claimants in foreign countries-in Germany and Poland, in Italy, and even in Spain. Among the veterans who have presented themselves at the Chancellerie of the Legion of Hlonour to claim the medal, was one who inhabits the village of St. Denis. He is 107 years of a-- a A still walks firm and erect, wearing a white bter,, that descends to his waist. The accounts of the harvest, supplied by the Prefects up to the 1st September are excellent, and exceed the expectations entertained of its abundance. It appears rather strange that we should stiUl be without official confirmation of Redschid Pasha's removal from the presidency of the Tanzimat. The fact, however, is not doubted hera, but it is thought that the removal is not to be considered so much in the light of a disgrace as wan at first believed. Redschid is said to have been not dismissedbut relieved (releve) from his new office. A letter, of the 2d, from Naples, says, with reference to the affair of the Cagliari steamer, that the captain has been declared innocent of any offence, but that he is detained as a witness. The question of the vessel itself was to be decided in a few days, and it was expected that it would be restored to the owners. The effects of the passengers and foreigners, seized on board the Cagliari, had been given up to their proprietors. A bad accident happened yesterday afternoon to AL Adolphe Fould, son of the Minister. He was siezed with a giddiness while driving his tilbury in the Champs Elysees, and fell out of the vehicle. He was taken up senseless, and conveyed to the Palace of the Exposition. At 10 at night he had not yet recovered his senses, but, after that hour his state improved, and this morning it was found practicable to convey him to his father's official residence. Mde. Fould, who was at Dieppe, was telegraphed for, and reached Paris at midnight. The Minister of State was expected to arrive to-day. The Spectateur (late the Assemble Nationale) has an article on the state of the money market, in which it endeavours to explain the causes of its present depressed state. The following are the principal passages of the article 'IT wo circumstances may explain the present industrial and commercial inortness. First, it may be affirmed that the production of the country having been unusually stimulated during the last two years, aud particularly in 1855, under the influenceof the Universal Exhibition, averynatural reaction has declared itself, and that the movement is now objectionably slow, because it was too rapid previously. In the next place, it may be declared that it Is not always at the ontse, that are felt the evils which are destined in the end to pro. duce most effect. Thus, we borrowed 1,500,000,000 in 1855 and 1856 for the war, we expended during the same period nearly 1,000,000,000 in works of public utility, in addition we sent large sums to foreign countries for corn, and yet the difficulties which were to be wrestled with during that period were scarcely perceptible. It is now allowable to believe that, if the barden was so light in 1855 and 1856, the reason was that it was to be heavier during the years which were to follow. Societies, like governments, have the faculty of anticipating on the future in matters of credit. We have somewhat abused that faculty, and we now pay the penalty of our having done so. The year 1857 liquidates anterior engagements, and perhaps expiates some acts of rashness. Such we conceive to be the -ause of the present crisis in industrial and commeorcial matters. The same is not, however, the ease in what relates to the depreciation of the public funds, and particularly of industrial securities. Here new causes are added to the old ones. Without doubt, the depreciation in the funds is also the consequence of the rarity of capital, which has been absorbed as stated above. But it arises also from the notable diminution of receipts, which is connected with the slackness existing iu commercial matters. These are not, perhaps, the only causes which have exercised their influence in producing the present depreciation. We conceive the principal causes to be found in the different attitude of the Government and of public opinion with respect to industrial companies, and, above al, those of railways. The Government first remodelled the tariffs and conditions of the railway companies, then imposed on them a special tax, and lastly insisted on the execution of branch-lines more or less expensive. As these measures coincided with financial difficulties and with the shifts which the companies are forced to for the purpose of obtaining the funds uecessary for the continuation !of their works, alarm was caused, and men began to ask each other if industrial securities were not seriously menaced in their future prospects. No astonishment should be felt if, under the influence of these pre-occupations, the shares of the best lines have at present fallen so considerably. All is con. jointly responsible in public credit, and the weight with which railway shares are loaded also bears down the Rento." A telegraphic despatch from Jassy in the Nord states that the Minister of the Interior of Moldavia, M. Basile Ghika, and seven Prefects have been dismissed for having committed administrative abuses. The Independance Belge has been seized at the post-office in consequence of an article on the Bntreaux Arabes.

Deutsche Post, which frequently expresses the sentiments of the Austrian Foreign-office, contains foUowing article on the Anglo-Indian question:- " Grqat and general is the sympathy felt for the English in the East Indies. Wherever inveterate prejudice and national jealousy do not predominate, It is wished that England may speedily triumph. So great, so powerful is the force of public lopinion in this matter, that even those who at heart hate the proud British Empire, and wish to see it enervated and exhausted, dare not openly express their thoughts. They are necessitated to mask their real sentimaents under a hypocritical ' turning up of the eyes' (Augens rerdreken) and apparently sympathizing phrases. Edifying In this respect are the American and French organs of the press. Some of the Yankee papers already flatter themselves that India is lost to England forever, and foresee that Great Britain is destined to become a fourth-rate Power. A Paris paper, being moved by generous indignalion, repudiates the idea, and with great unction expresses its conviction that even if England should lose India it Wi a second or third-rate Power. We, however, hope and believe that those who speou. late on the humiliation and decline of England will find themselves egregiously deceived. England's power and geatf must be upheld for the welfare of the vor3d, for' the' x0aintenance of th integtiU and Li. dependence of the European 3tates; for if her might ane influence should dec.'ine, two Powers wotld share between them the domini . n over the world. We do not mean Russia and France, but Russia anll North America. It is necessary for Gernany, for the NeAer]ands, for th- balaznce of power in the East, that England shonld oontinne to be what sbe now is. England is also necessry to the well-being of Frnoce, inasmuch as she, by her in'duence, keepe a sangaine and over-hasty nation from making pedlous experlmentifrom paying, by the most terrible misfortaunes, for a fiw brief years of spiendour (glory). The war in India li probably last one or two years; but every politician, who not a Russian or an American, must desire that the exertio' England may be crowned with success, and that ^'e ma remain, as now, a Srst-rate Power." The Bilcancia, the organ of the Ultramontane p .rty in Lombardy, is at ,resent extremely hostile tco the English in India, but it will change its tone when it obtains such confirmation of the atrocities of the Sepoys as is containod in a letter addressed by Father Raphael, a Catholic missionary at Patna, to his friends in Bavaria. The following I extracts are from the letter of the reverend gentleman "PATNA, Jur. 13. "An attack was made on our station ou the 3d of July, at half-past 7 p.m. While the Mahometans were brealdng open the doors of the house I took refuge in the stable. I heard and understood every thing they said, and the words 'Padri saheb Bohan hai Iforega,' (Where is the priest? he must die,) still ring in my eas. Fortunately I was not discovered, but to my extreme sorrow the good Dr. Lyell, a Protestant physician, who came to my assistance, was killed. He was sbot in the abdomen, had one sabre cut in his forehead, and three others ou his mouth and chin." Several officers, who have recently quitted this service, have applied to me to know whether a German leglon is to be formed, but, unfortunately, it was not in my power to give them any information on the subject. The Vienna Ultramontanists have recently talked so much of the advantage which the State derives from " Catholic newspapers," that a talented writer for the Oesterreichische Zeitung has thought it worth while to call the attention of the State to the fact that the Ul7tra Catholic press is frequently anything but conservative. The organs of the Roman Catholic hierarchy have never given their support to any state of things which was disadvantageous to the Church; but they have never failed to write in favour of any innovations which could tend to increase its power and influence. A few years ago they defended the conduct of O'Connell and O'Brien in Ireland, and they did battle for the Liberal party In Belgium when it attempted to make the RomanCatholic the dominant Church. The Vienna Pubicist says:-' "In Austria it is just as superfluous to defend the rights of the Roman Catholic Church as to defend the monarchical principle in Russia, or the republic in the United States. The Roman Church is not only dominant in Austria, but it is more favoured than in any other country in the world. A fifth part of the population of the empire is non-Catho. lie, and its highest wish is not to be deprlved of its rights. It acts simply on the defensive, and the Catholio Church has no need to be afraid of an attack. A handful of unarmed men will never think of attacking a regiment of soldiers with bayonets levelled, and the non-Catholics wil never think of giving umbrage to the all-powerful Roman Catholic Church." " Until now the Catholic papers have only done mischief, inasmuch as they have raised doubts as to the policy and civilization of Austria, and diminished her inflsuence in that country (Germany) in which it is most necessary that it should be maintained. The opponents of Austria are at the greatest pains to prove that the results of Catholic cism in this empire are the same as in Naples. They continually cite the articles of the so-called Catholic papers, and declare them to be the expression of the opinions of the Austrian Government and of the Austrian hierarohy. They purposely interpret the Concordat in the same illiberal and intolerant way as the Catholic papers, and by so doing make it the bugbear of the Catholics in Germany. They endeavour to prove that even Catholies are better off under the sceptre of Prussiu than under the protection of Austria. In this way the ancient fend is kept alive in Germany, and papers published in this empire are made to serve as weapons of offence against Austria." At a meeting of the representatives of the Danubian district of the Protestant Church ia Hungary it was settled that the theological seminary should be removed from Keeskemet to Pesth. The assembly expressed its discontent that it was not permitted to discuss the private affairs of the Protestant Church excepting in the presence of an Imperial Commissary, and it intends to petition the Emperor to uphold Art. 26 of the law of 1791, which says, that a representative of the Sovereign is to be present only when the Synod meets. A haLf-promise was given to the Hungarians that a Protestant Synod should be convoked withoat loss of time, but nothing has yet been done in the matter. It created a great sensation when one of the leading representatives of the Protestants on the Danube rose and announced to the assembly that 1,6401. had been subscribed at Glasgow towards the establishment of a theological seminary at Pesth. In a tremendously long letter His Holiness the Pope informs " his beloved son," the Archbishop of Cologne, that he has totally prohibited the works of another beloved son, Anthony Gunther, theAustrian priest, who was weak enough to endeavour to give a philosophical basis to the Roman Catholic religion. As you were told at the beginning of this year, the majority of the Austrian priests are " Gintherians," and information has now been given me that he has many disciples among the clergy in the diocess of the Archbishop of Cologne. The Emperor, who returned from his Hungarian tour on Saturday, in the evening, was present this morning at a grand manceuvre on the Schmelz, a large common outside the suburb lMariahilf. His Majesty, who seemed to be in perfect health, came into town after the manoeuvre was over, and presided at a Cabinet Council. Credible information has reached me that the Emperor Francis Joseph will go to Berlin in the course of this month to return the visit of his Royal uncle. The Emperor3 Napoleon and Alexander will meet at Stuttgard, the capital of Wurtemberg, on the 26th or 27th inst. I The Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and the Archduchess Charlotte made their entry into Verona at 1 o'clock on the 3d. There was he usual salute from the fort of St. Peter, the stereotype parade, and the customary enthusiasm. Indeed, if the Gazeta di Verona be well informed, there was more than the customary enthusiasm. During the last day or two four young English gentlemen have created a considerable sensation here. As they wore belts and revolvers, and manifested considerable excitement when brought into contact with waiters, hackney coachmen, and such like small game, it was generaUy supposed they were bold spirits on their way to India to assist their distressed countrymen, but such is not the case. They are simply inexperienced travelers, who are out for "a lark." A few days ago the first locomotive made its appearance in Debreezin, to the great astonishment and delight of the inhabitants of that corn and cattle dealing and soap manufacturing Hungarian town. The Theiss and Western Railroada are making extremely rapid progress, and that in spite of the difficulties which have been thrown in the way of the Compazies by various parties. Many EDgliahmen, who have come out here expecting to find employment, are in such distres as to be obliged to claim the assistance of the British Government, in order to get home. It must be wel understood that English workmen have no chance of finding employment on the Austrian railroads, as the contractors prefer Italians and Bohemians, who are wiling to do the same work at much lower prices. Yesterday afternoon the Archauke Ferdinand Maximilian and his bride made their "solemn eatry" invkW Milan.

All is quiet in Gambia, and ox hides, beeswax, and ground nuts are abundant. Liberia continues in a state of peace. Lagos is healthy, but trade dull, in consequence of an exI ected attack from Cosaco, their former King. The traffic in slaves, however, continues to increase. Her Majesty's brig Teazer has captured a vesel under Spanish colours, with 230 slaves; she left before the mail packet, but had not arrived at Sierra Leone when the Gambia sailed.

We continue to pubj!sh from amoting the numeroxiS letters f'orwardel to us by tho friends and relatires of officers in Tndia such as contain any new detils or matter of pas.tico.lar interest. CAWNIPORE, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Perhaps the following extracts from the lat letters repeived from the young wife of the Magistrate and Collevtor of Cawnpore may be interesting to those who are now orrowing for the cruel fate of beloved relatives who were in that unhappy garnison, and amcag whom, alas I wa the writer of these letters, with her husband and two infant children, and likewoe two others of her nearest relatives "May l "You wi have seen from the paPAw-16ndiajut now Is in a very disturbed state; there *re nutinies brealing out everywhere among the nLtive troops. The L9th Regi. ment of Native Infantry at Barrackpore, I told you some time ego, had been disbanded, and now the 34th Native Infatry haves sAred the same fate. The:e ha. alo been a row at Lulcknow. The 7th OQde Irregula. Inftry have mutinied. They (the native) have an idea that tbe Govern mneet are trying to convert them to Christianlty, and, what with the mistake of the c rtiiges being grease with oow' fat, and this new law allowing Hindoo widows to marry, -which I think hs a great deal to do with ib-.they are frantic about it The Mofusgiitc, of to-ay bringsthe news of a fresh mutiny at Moeert in ihe 3d Cavalry. It s-eems range that at a lrge sbthn like Meerut they could have managed to do so -.mlb mi5 chief without the authorities there having an inkling a to what was going on. Their audacity has been very greet, and it onlyshows towhatapitchfutlcism willdrivetbem, when in the face of so much artillery they eould openly rebeL Their arrsngements were kept profoundly secret, and their object in destroying the bridges and stopping all communication was, of course, to prevent pursuit. Bt, notwithstanding all the precautions they took, their having mutinied ras known in Agra before they could cut the wire.1 "MaBy 15. "These mutinies are the topic of the day. The Ewarts were with us last night, and they told us that two regiments of Native Infantry at Mecrut had attacked the gaol, and released all the prisoners There Is no saying where and how all this will endL Disaffection in the army is spreading rapidly. Gret fears are entertained for Delhi, for there are no European troops there, and the native regiments are all more or less affected. That aU this should be stopped is certain, but no one knows how ; the authorities appear to be panic-strucken. Cawnpore is quiet, and the regiments here are stanch, but there is no saying that they would remain long so if they came into contaet with some of their mutinous brethren. We have only about 100 European soldiers here altogether and six guns. We am very anxious for Lulcknow, for if anything were to happen there, so that the regiments were to mutiny, we should not be long safe here Tho Gauges divides us from Lucknow, but I fancy this would not be any obstacle to their coming over here. Such is the state of things. This morning, however, our minds were a Uttle relieved as regards Lucknow; a durbar, or levee, had been held bh Sir Henry La4wrence in honour of certain native officers and men who had seized some of the mutineers, and had also brought to light seditious ppers. These men were all rewarded with handsome presents, aud Sir H. Lawrenoo made a splendid speech on the occasion, which is well calculated to re-assure their minds, and to prove to thorm that the GovErnment have nointention of converting them compulsorily to Christlanity. Down country, from Meerut to Dinapore, there is but one regiment of Europeans, of which we have 100 men, and the rest are at Lucknow. Yon see, therefore, how easy it would be for the native army to peO& seas thomselves of Oade, aud all the stations lying between Dinapore and Meerut. The Pnnjab appears, from the number of European troops there, to be safe, but it is quite certain that we must havo at least 30,000 more Euro. pean soldiers to secure our position throughout this country. I am not likely to hear from UmbaUlah until these mutinie5 are at an end, for the d3lk is stopped, and the road is in the possession of the mutineer" "- May 1. "Tne news continues stil to be very bad. In to-dcy's paper there is a fearful account of the mutiny at Meerut, where General HeWitt commands; he has shown himself thoroughly incompetent for his office. Can you imagine a man with a European force, consisting of four batteries of Artillery, a regiment of Foot, and ano'ber regiment of Dragoons not balng able to protect the station until all the mutineers had left it ? The people here at Cawrnpore cannot understand why some porton of this force was not detached and sent in pursuit of the rebels; but it appears that nothing of the kind was done, but they were allowed to pursue their course uninterrupted to Delhi, where no doubt they have done an incredible amount of mischief; and if the native regiments there have joined them it is too much to be feared that the station and the English in it are entirely at their mercy. The electrictelegraph oommunication between Meerut and Agra, which had been closed since last Sunday, the 10th, was reopened this morning. There does not soem to be any immediate danger here, but should they mutiny 'we should either go into cantonments or to a place caled Bithoor, about six miles from Cawupore, 'where the Peishwas successor resides. He is a great friend of C-', and is a man of enormous wealth Lud Influence, and he has assured C- that we should all be quite sLfethers. I, myself, would much prefer going to the chutonments, to be with the other ladies, but 0- thinks that it would be better for me and our precious children to be at Bithoor. The Ewarts have most kindly offered us their house if anything should occur to driTe us from this." "May 17. "Mr. Willoughby, who so bravely blew up the Delhi magazine, w>as here for some time with his mother; his sister married 31r. Pollock a short time ago at Cawnpore. The insurgents have talcen Delhi and have mado a stand there. This state of things, however, oannot last long, and it is expected that in about three weeks we shall have recaptured Delhi and have blown the place to pieces. An immense force is being sent there for that purpose, butJ the season is unfortuntely very much against us. We do not expect thereawillbe much fighting, for a few sheUs thrown into the fort and a volley or two will quickly disperse them, and they will probably give in at once. Delhi once retaken, and there will be a finale to all there mutinies. We will soon show them that Englishmen are not going to be tampered with, or to allow their country men and women to be murdered without revenging it immediately. It will be a lesson to Govern. ment for ever not to allow India to be left with so few European troops." In another letter, commenced on the lth of MIay, the same writer says:- "This is a most anxious time, for, thoush Cawnpore remains quiet, we cannot help thinking of the dangers which sunround us and of the sufferings of our dear friends and fellow-countrymen. We have just had a note from Sir George Parker, telling us that several of the officers at Delhi had, thank God, escaped, and had been met writh their wives and children, some in buggies and some on foot, going to Kurnaul. There are aU sorts of dreadful rumours going about; but I hope they are false. If there should be an outbreak here dearest C- has made all the necessary arrangements for me and the children to go to Bithoor, and he wiiU go there himself, aud,with the aid of the Rajah, to whose house we are going, he will coUect and head a force of 1,500 fighting men, and bring them into Cawnpore to take the insurgents by surprise. This is a plan of their own, and is auite a secret, for the object of it is to come on the mutineers unawares." "May23. "We are now at the Ewrats' house in cautonmentg, having been compeUed to leave our own rather suddenly from the alarming reports we heard. We came here the day before yesterday about 5 p.m. The night before the Gmneral had so much caue for alarm that he sent a meeao to Sir HL Lawrence at Lucknow, asking him to ardst us with 300 European soldlers but Lucknow being in a very dmilar state he could only spare us 55 men, who have arrived here. The rumours were so bad that C-, with the consent of Sir IL Wheler, wrote to tho Rajabh of Bithoor to send his force of Mabrataa down here, and all the officers here slept at their lines to show the Sepoys that they plaoed implicit confidence in them. We were all in a state of great anxiety, expecting every minute to hear firing. It had been an arranged thing for tho 2d Cavalry to mutiny that very night, but four native officers overhearing it -went to Major Vibart, who commands that regiment, and told him exactly the state of things. They then returned to the men and addressed them, which so far had a good effect that they cnsnted to relinquish their intentions at least for that night. Can you imagine such a state of things-our own troops threatening us with an outbreak, and then moodily putting it off for a few nights ? On the morning of the 21st everybody was so alarmed that the commandant, of regiments went to the General and advised him to move the guns and have them in readiness in case of an attack. He would not hear of it at first I believe, but C- went to him, and then he gave the order. This Was abouit 7 p.m,, and then it was not "nown that they intended to break out that very night. Soon after this a note camein from the General to say that an alarm had beenspread by cavalry, infantry, and guns approaching the station, and wishing to ks.ow if it was the Mahratta force from Bithoor, eeCo -- was obliged to go; but, not liking to leave,re bere, he drove us xU off at onoe to the European barrac where the guns had been ordered to be staioned, It a near 10 e'iok when we arrired there, and to our aarnghmenS vo guns had arrived C- went off to the -o0erl's, anJ told him of it, when he wrote another order about the* and they were Moved immediately and wvii in positloiA about lalf-past 1Ip.m. It might have ben o fhe most xsrt.s consequence, and iadeed it Vs a Pio4id&Soe watching over us that nothig did some of it, for had Vie natives know n it they would pehsps have triea to mak*sg AtaLck on us.

It was a very sorrowful letter and I fear it will distress you.

The General remains in tho barracks day and night, to be at hand if anything should happen. We still pasS the day at tho Ewarts' house, but at night everyone returns to the barracks, which is a wretched place. Yesterday I had the extreme pleasmre to receive your letter of Aprl 26, and which in these troublous times was, inde4df most welcome.

The following letter is from a young Englishwoman of 19 and is a wonderful example of the spirit which Ls been excited by the treacherous and basely crnol conduct of the Indian army:- " Murree, Punjab, June 27. ?, ? Tha nk God, we aroe all stillin health and safety, though we hbd a fright this morning, of which I must teD you. I was in my own room, in tho large house, about hall-past seven o'clock in the morning. I w-as saying my prayers and the ayah was getting my bath ready. when I heard her say, 'Oh, I wish you would make haste1 would you had done!' When I had finishod I got up, and askod her what sh me ant. Sho said that my aunt had sent word for me to dress as quickly as possible, and that tho Sepoys were on guard all round the compound; that our guard was under arms, and that they did not know what it vwas for. but that Juggernaut, our jomnader, ws stopped on his way down to the bazaar, and told nobody was to go outside tbOir own compound. He came back and told Aunt L- this. and declared his readiness to go anywhere, or do a-ything she told him. Sbe bado him go and try to hear what xas the matter. He found out that some of the mutineers from Peshawnr were coming across the hils to go into Cashmore, and that thero was reason to believe that they were in the bazaar here, trying to raise the people. Mr. Baltze, Mr. NacXabb, and Captain Bracken, with a guard, went to the baLzaar, but could not discover these men, but I am afraid there is no doubt they are here. We tried to stop them in Hnzara, and sent two comnanies of Sikhs against thom, but we have not heard lwhat has become of them. The mutineers' f&vourite time for attacking us is in church, and as to-morrow is Sunday it will be an anxious day. The people are grown so impudeus they go about shouting ' Sahib togue ho raj hogne'-ic., ' Tho reign of the English Is over.' We have eight men of Major Luinsden's regiment to guard us-they are such fino fellows - we feel quite proud of them. They are called ' Guides " their uniform is tho colour of the ground, so that they cannot easily be distinguishod. They are fighting splendidly beforo DelhL Whon aunt L- and I went out into tho verandah those men were loading their muskets and sharpening their bayonets, nd looking not a little pleased at the prospect of a 'row.' Aunt said to one, 'It these mutineers come up to this houso shaU you lot any of them escape?' The man smiled grimly and said, ' Not one. I did not feel at aU frightenod, I am glad to say, though it ws enough to make ono fear whon ono knows how they cut the ladles at Delhi into pTiecs before eaoh other's eyos; andt as for tho poor children, they set them in tho barning sen with nothing on their heads, and garo them no vater, till they wont mad ! It makes me wsofrocious to think of it, r loRg to go and fight the wrotches myself. They say out men fight like berokes Some English hid themselves. for some days in a moosque at DelhL At last the Sepoys told them that if they would come out thoir lives should be spared. They did; and one lady said, ' Yon may kiU me if you wUl give my child a little water.' They took beg child from her and killod it, and then took all the rest ta tho Palace, where they were murdored before the Bing. "To-day we havo heard that the whole GOvlUor contingent has mutinied; It conssts of 16,000 men and 30 guns They are on their way to Delhi. Our men are quito exhausted, and how can they fight these new men who pour into Delhi overy day ? Unless you send us help soon we are done for. There has been a frightful massacre at Shajohanpore. We bave not yot reoeived the particulars-it happenod on a, Sunday. At Bareilly the Brigadior's sentry shot him ;n his own drawing-room.

NOBLE ARSCUE o0 S LADY FBOM THE SEA. TO TMB E1DITOR OF TE TIMES. Slr,-Early last month a lady wa bathing in the mea at Bude, In Cornwall, and was carried by the retreating tide out of her depth; she did not low her presnce of mind, but, knowing how to float, she kept herlf above water and caJled for assistance. There were many persons near who heerd her calls, but none ventured into the surf toher roscue. The great Atlantic waves roll In here with all ther force, so that a summer sea at Bude often surges to the shore with a suooebion of huge breakers; and a heavy ground swel rolling with the tide renders it no ewy task for a strrmg swimmer to win his way against its power. There was such a sea that day; no wonder, then, that those who stood upon the shore durst not Tenture upon such a trial. A merciful Providence carried the lady through the surf, and every moment the tide bore her furtherfromthe strnd. Eler young children andherservantw re agonized upoa the besch, and all the bathers, visitors, and villagers rzu to the spot in great excitement. It happened that many strangers had focked into Bude to a flower show, who l hasted to the ene. A young mn, named George Bate, who was working in a ve&,el at a long distance from the shore, seeing so many persons hurrying in eno direction, set off to learn the "ase, and was soon told that a lay was being carried out to sea. Being a good swmomer, he determined at oncewrhatto do and running rapidly, taking off his lothes by the rWay, !he reaehed the crowrd on the strand, ws soon undressed, and, undaunted by the danger which ha panicstruck othe, plunged into tbe waves. The ady now was far out to sea, and Bate, unable to soe her through the waves, swam in the direction indicated by the people on the shore. Their excitement reached the highest pitch, and a great ahout arose when he rewched her. By this time the lady had given up all hope; the had shit her eyes, her knees had begun to give way, and she had humbly resigned herself to the will of Him who she knew was all-merciful and alone able to nave. The shout of the crowd nade her open her eyes, and she saw her preservcr. He said, "I cau save you." Sbe said, "Thank God, and thank you." Her presenoe of mind did not leave her, and she told George Bate that she could put her hands on hbs shoulders, if he liked so to swim with her. Bate, with oool caution, kept swimming t a proper distmnoe until he found that the lady was collected, for well he knew, when he that day left the shore, that besides the danger of the waves there was the yet greater peril of the convulsive gasp of despair, which too often paralyzes the arms which would otherwise save. Finding that there was no such peril, he agreed, aud began his ardos task of swimming to the shre against the tide, the lbdy resting her hands on his shoulders, and helping hima as much as her feeble strength w vould permit Indeed, she well knew what a task he had, I and on the ay she offered again to stop and float if he wished. "No," said the brave fellow again and again, "I can save you," and nobly did he brest the wavee with his burden aginst the tide, more than once beiny submerged by the wave behind lifting her over him Stil on they went, and soon through the heavy surf they gained the strand, amid such excitement as seldom can be witnessed.

The lady was half an hour in the water, and it is cosi.- dered that she drifted half a mile from the plaoe where Rhe was carried away; that George Bate swam haf a mile before he reached her; and from the place he reaohed her at sea to the nearest shore, where he landed her against tlde and current, wa upwards of a quarter of a wile. i I a deed which sbould be xoisod abroad, for all noble acts tend to exite their like.

George Bate is modest, as all brave men are; he is a sIllor of about 20 years of age, and lives with his mother, a re6pectable widow, to whoeo support he mainly contributes, Those who sew what he had done subscribed together, and bave presented this noble young man with a watch and chain, with a suitable inscription. An acoount of this incident appeared In some of the local papers, and the Duke of Northumberland sent Bate 24, and some other persons hbve sent him small Sums in acknowIrdgment e.f his bravery. Application has been mbdo for the medal of the excellent Humane Society, which it is believed will be granted, I have occupied, I find, a large portion of your valuable space, but I think you will agree with me that the details of such a noble deed should be published to all the world, and that object can only be accomplished through your column& I am, Sir. your obedient servant. -1 - . - ..

PROMOTION BY PURCHASE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TImES, Sir,-I beg you will allow me to my a few words m esplation of certain evidence which I had the honour of gving before the Commission on Purchase, to which the writer of vn article in your impression of the 7th of September adverted in the Some of the opponents of purchame weaken their eow by dwelling on the favounritismwhich occionally Influencs reghneantl promotion. Hr. Igis reminds the Commig. sionn how a young nobleman was thrust oevr the heAs of older and better soldiers by an ingenious prooes of excdang ending with a gratuitous company in the Guards; but it Ig evident that the same object might have been &Wated with even greater reAdin by a sstem of elsfi(Mo. A reference to my evidenc will show that I did not refer to this cas as illustrative of the evis of the purchae oytem. I referred to it to rebut the favourite argument of the upporters of that system, that purchase act as a checl to favouritism, inasmuch as an officer posmessed of the regulation prioe of his next step cannot be passed over by a junior* no matter what the wealth or the interest of the latter may be. There is ample evidence before the Commisson to prove that this argument, so often cited by the Right Ron. E. EllMce, the ablest defender of the exating state of things, is nothing worth. The laof the Yand and the lez scripta of the service is that an officer receiving or paying more than the regulation price of his commisson is guilty of a misademeanour, and on oonviction would be dnimed the service and imprisoned. But Mr. Hammerley, the army agent, has informed the Commision that this law is altogether disregarded; that commissions in peace time usually fetch from 60 to 100 per cent. above the regulation price, and sometimes much more ; and an officer insisting on his right to obtain promotion at regulation price is at once voted a shabby fellow, who stops the promotion of his regiment, and ought to be dealt with accordingly. Mloreover, staff appointments and exchanges afford wide doors for the advancement of men poussed of great wealth and great influence. A riot oocurred a year or two ago at a theatre in the south of France at which Mademoiselle Rachel was about to appear. Crowds besieged the doors early in the day, and were formed into long lines to be admitted in their fair turn; but when the doors opened the weary playgoers discovered to their disgust that the m&nager had filled all the front xeats with friends of his own, who had been privily admittediby the stage entrance. This afforda an apt illustration of the fate of regimental officers who can just contrive to pay the regulation price of their oommiissonB and no more. You say that jobs can be perpetrated even more easily under a system of selection than under a system of purchase, and you sat truly, supposing that a system of unrestricted selection were sub tituted for purchae. But I fancy nobody wishes to see that. Under a system of regulated selection it would be difficult to job at all, and it would be impossible to job to the detriment of the public service. If the Commander-in-Chief were only allowed in peace time to select for promotion among men who had taken a very high degree at a military college> he might still how favoutism in preferring a good man to another who had shown himself still better; but it would be imporsible for hiur to select the idle, the ignorant, or the dull. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. IL J. HIGGINS 71, EAton-8quare, Sept. 9.

AfONY-MARKETand CIT YIA TBLLEU tNOCB. Wedne6day Evening. This has been settling day in the English funds, but it has led to no important variat ous. The market, on the whole, however, has shown a slight tendency to increasing firmnes. Consols for money opened and closed at 90N to A. At one period they went to 90% to #. For the 14th of October the Last price was 9O§ to 91. Mloney was in demand, but all that vas required was obtained with ease at e per cent. India Ste left off at 210 to 213; India BoRds, 20s. to 16a. discount; and Exchequer1ID1, 5,. to iS. discount. The foreign stock-market has been steady, with a tendency to advance. An improvement occurred in Turkish, partly, it is believed, from purchases on the approach oI the October dividend. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 102i; ditto, 1843, 99; Danish Five per Cents., 100; Mexican, for the account, 21X; Peruvian Three per Centb., for the account, 55k; Portuguese, 450; Sardinian, for the account, 89 9. Turkish Six per Cents., 95i and i; and French Three per Cents., 66f. 75c. and 5c. The corn-market was xteady this morning at the prices of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 85c. for money, and 66f. 95c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of an eighth. The last inteUigence from New York suggests some curious considerations regarding the conditions on which English capital is invested in America. The amount of American securities held here can merely be conjectured. Five years back it was thought to be nearly sixty miUions sterling, and it may now be eighty or a hundred millions. Until the approach of the Rusdan war they almost all paid large and regular dividends, but the ability of the various railway and other companies to raise fresh money as it was wanted on second, third, and fourth mortgages in London, having then received a check, there has since been a constant downward tendency, until perhaps two-thirds of the weaker sort have gone into comparative insolvency. For a time, when distributions could no longer be made from capital, the device was hit upon of paying what are caUled scrip dividends, and as these cost nothing they were always on a lhberal scale. The accounts usuaUy showed to the shareholders that there was a profit of about 10 per cent., but, unfortunately, the cash balance had invariably been absorbed through some temporary and accidental circumstances. The gain was therefore handed over to them in paper, redeemable a year or two hence. The plan, however, although it was at first thought to be all right, failed upon repetition to satisfy the hunger of the parties interested; and probably many of our own Birmingham theorists have received, from experience in this respect, the Exrst blow to their ideas regarding the nature and functions of money. At last, in a number of instances, exposure became unavoidable, examples of deception, fraud, and repudiation abounded on all sides, and prices even of the leading undertakings went to a point which showed that in the minds of the public, years of economy and good management would be requisite to restore any of them to a solid position. Thus far the result had, perhaps, been little other than might have been expected. It was the old story of the State loans over again. Any Honourable member of Congress or Assembly coming over to England had only to make a demand large enough, and he could get all he wanted. He would go to a leading ironmaster, give a heavy order for rails, pay about 30 or 40 per cent. above their value, and trust to this gentleman for the disposal, through brokers and others tempted by a noble per. centage, of such amount of stocks and bonds as b*ight be deemed appropriate for the moment. The pelt and each succeeding year the process might, of course, be repeated, since the prosperity of the part already constructed rendered extensions of allkinds indispeniable. But it was to have been supposed that experience dearly purchased would at length have generated some prudence. Apparently, howsver, our people are incurable. The last railway =oncern that has broken down is the Michigan Southern, and it is sad that only a few monthz have elapsed sinoo the President paid a visit to the English shareholders, and induced them considerably to extend their commitments. Still, instances of this kind are as nothing compared with the wholesale apathy exhibited. Incredible as it may seem, our 80 millions or more of American securities are left to take their chance, without the holders knowing or learning anything about them except from the managing parties. The railvray companies issue reports only once a-year, usually of the most vague description, and no accounts of what passes at their meetings transpire. Everything is taken for granted, and each individual English holder assumes that some other holder, by whom, perhaps, he was first led into the investment, keeps careful watch. And while this total absence of organization prevails in England, there is actually a powerful combination on the other side for the avowed purpose of bringing all the principal undertakings to ruin. Unlike those of any other country, the majority of the leading speculators of New York are devoted to the task of depreciating the national credit. Whether this arises from the extent to which American liabilities are held by foreigners need not be dis- ussed. A large body of active persons are known L)be associated for the purpose; they influence the Less to work out their views, and are alleged, not rely to operate with a joint capital, but to hold ugular meetings, and permanently to retain legal dvisers, vwhose chief vocation it may be assumed is to discover points that may enable the validity of each kind of security to be called in question, and thus to create universal distrust. They are also said to succeed in a vast number of instances in getting their own creatures into the control of companies, ostensibly supporting or opposing them as may best suit their tactics in each particular case. Each new revelation of fraud is hailed as a triumph, and such directors and shareholders as may show a disposition to take advantage of technicalities to defeat all equitable claims, instead of being hooted from the Exchange, find .a circle of admirers. Of course this state of things would end, or be greatly mitigated, if the stock and bondholders were to exercise vigilance. In most instances the proceed- sega are so notorious and the laxity of management so cocmplete and long-continued that English investors, if they had any rational agent on the spot, could not fail to be warned. But there is no London Committee of American stockbolders, and, apparently, no possibility of forming one. Yet something should be done if possible to remedy tbe evil. Some persons will say the best remedy would be found by an avoidance of American investments altogether; but this, although it seems likely enough to be brought about unless the respectable portion of the American mercantile community can contrive to influence public opinion, is not a result that any one anxious for tha advancement of the best interests of both countries would wish to see take place. No field for the employment of capital is superior to that of the United States, and the sympathies of businees beget a universal disposition here to seek it and trust to it. Under such circumstanceg it is deplorable that owing to a want of concerted action armong the honest portions of the two communities a depraved minority should command all the channels of enterprise, and render confidence impossible. The bar silver bought by the last West India tteamer has been sold at 61Ad., showing a decline of id. per lb. from the price realized for that by the preceding packet.

The subjoined letter relates to the Atlantic telegraphic cable:- " Sir,-Having been connected with the Atlantic Telegraph Company ftrm its commencement, and being in every way deeply Interested in its success, I ak the privilege of reply to the statement in your money article of the 4th inst., wherein you state asfollows -- 'It is reported that the Atlantic cable is not likely to prove avaible for either of the projeoted Indian lines of telegraph. It appears that in its present coiled state It generates or absorbs a great amount of heat, and a fear Is entertained of its being ruined by the temperature to which it would be subjected in twice crossing the tropics. It has been found that extreme heat in the parts under pressure forces the copper wire to the sides of the gutta percha, and destroys insulation.' "1 On the evening of the day onvwhich yourarticle appeared I proceeded to Plymouth, and, having called to my aid the electrical and other officers of the company, there was made a most minute examination of the cable. l" This e raminatlur. enables me to state that the reports to which you allude respecting the generation of heat in the cable are simply amistake, and experiments instituted there and since my return to London enable me also to state that no heat exists in the hold either of the Agamemnon or Niagara beyond what is natural; and that the cable tests as pe1feotly through its wbole length as it did the day it was put on hoard ship, and there is nothing ie its own nature, or the mode in which it is coiled, that leads to the slightet apprehension for it safety, or for any injury from the preesure to which it is sabjected. The cablo is laid in regular strata, mathematiaPlly true-coI upon coil-and the maztmum pressure upon the very loweat coil or flake is less than 281bh to the square inch. " Severe experiments made and vouched for since your article was tten show that the cable remained absolutely terfect asnd uninjured at a temperature of 135 deg. Fahrenz sit, under a pressure for several hours of considerably rmore than six times that to which it is subjected in the lowest coil of the Agamemnon. $4 As regards the sale of the cable, I would inform you that the suggestioa did not come from the Atlantic Company, and when the proposition for its purchase was made them, first by the Red Sea Company and then by Sir W. O'Bbanghnessy for the Persian Gulf, they only consented to entertain it on the condition that they could contract for a similar one to be made and ready for them in time to secure its being laid at the earliest practicable moment in the spring. On these conditions, and at the price stated, they were willing their cable should be appropriated to the Indian service, which was revresented to them as most presslng. "Before I conclude I would make one remark, not In reply, but simply in reference to the mass of inaccuracres w ich your correspondent " B." circulated in your paper of the 28th of August last, The company has nothing to conceal AUl their acts are open to public scrutiny; but it is obvious that they cannot be expected to answer allcom. munications that appear in the public prints " I am, Sir, yours trly, London, Sept. 9.

DESTBUCTION OF A CARAVAN. - Private letters from Aleppo of the nth of Augmt announce the loss of Almost an entire caravan of 1,300 camels, and 500 irregular troops, traders, and conductors, which had taken its departure from Damascug on the 29th of June, for Bagdad, in- Olviovg tbo ruin of several hundred merchants at the last two-named places. It would appear that the caravan had stryed from the direct road, where, finding no water, it bad to come to a halt, and despatch some of the conductors in search of some wanderihg tribe to assist it out of its difficulty, many lives having been already lost from thirst. and unprecedented heat. At length a purcbase of the necessary element was concluded at the price of 200 plasres th ael-loa ; hut on a supply reaching the place off halt. aot more than from 15 to 20 human beings were found alive to partake of it. The Arabe had attacked those dying from thirst, and piLlged al the most valuable of the goods,
BAIL WAY AND MINING SHARBBS. Wednesday Evening. The 1taIway-market to-day has been quiet. An advance of 21. occurred in Caledonian ; Great Northern aLaneater and Carlisle, Sheffield, North British, and South-Eastern also improved, while Great Southern and Western (Ireland) receded; North-Eastern Leeds stock was rather flatter. In Great Western there was no alteration. A small reduction took place -n Great Western of Canada; Madras were slightly hicgher. In foreign shares, LombardoVenetian, Worthern of France, and Lyons advanced, and a fall of l1s. occurred in Western and North-Western of France. The principal variation in mines was a reduction of 11. in St. John del Rey. In joint-stock banks and miscellaneous securities there was no alteration-
ON THE BORDBBS O LTONDON.-The houses are built in rows; but, there being no roads, the ways re so Anformed that the parish will not take cbarge of them. We get, then, upon a narrow path of gravel raised about two feet above the grass-such paths enable men to walk not more than midleg deep about the place in rainy weather -and we come to A row of houses built with their backs to a stagnant ditch. We turn aside to see the ditch, and find that it is a cesspool, so charged with corruption that not a trace of vegetable matter groWs upon its surfacebubbling and seething with the constant riEe of the foul products of decompodstion that the pool pours up into te air. The filth of each house pmses through a short pipe straight into this ditch, and stays there. Upon Its surface, to our grstwonder,afewconsmnptive-lookini ducks are swinmming, very dirty- very much like the human dwellersin foul alleys as to tieir their depressed and haggard physiognomy and to be weighed by ounces, not by pounds. Some of them may be ducklings, but they look as ola as the most ancient raven. Perhaps this row of houses Is a poor back settlement, a slum of Halsville. We go on, and are abruptly stopped by another ditchiul of stagnating corruption, bubbling as the last bubbled; while at a little distance is another row of houzes, built so that they may pour all their solid and liquid filth into it in the most convenient way, and receive it back as air with the least pcssible dilution. Near these houaes we find a plank by which the ditch Is croased. There is a path across a patch of green, and the path is in one place made up of planks rotted with wet, now dred Into the soil on which they float in spongy weather. The planks tell a tale, so does the bloated and corrupt body of a drowned dog that lies baking in the middle of that patch of green. We smell the dog, we smell the ditches, and we smell the marsh, dry as it is. As we go on exploring we find the same s3stem of building everywhere.-DicaWs Bouseid Words.

Tim ROYAoi BRmsu BAi,-Y--It has been pretty generally runoured within the lat few days that the trial of the directors and the other persons charged with being concerned in this gigantlc gwindle would take place at the October or November sesdon of the Central Criminal Comr, and that the ordinary serion would be specially adjourned to aPrticular period for that purpose, Ls in the cae of Palmer. It appears, however, thAt the officials of that oourt have not reooived any notificAtion upon the subject, and there is very Uttle doubt that the trial will take place In the Court of Queen's Bench during tho November term. The public is aware that no indictments bave been at present greferred againstany of the defendants in the ordinary form, Mt the Attorney era in his official capacity has " informed the CouA* that oertain persons, whose names he men' tioned, he had remon to believe had been guilty of a msdemeanour in having unlawfully conspired and combined together to obtain diverslgesusas of money by means of fale and fraudulent pretenoe, lUpon this information the Cour of Queen's Bench Issued its process for the apprehension of the persons named in the information, and Mr. Humphrey Brown, Alderman Kennedy, Mr. Cameron, the manager of the bank, and several othert were arrested and held to bail to answer the charges made against them Under ordinary circumstances a charge of this character would be properly brought for investigation before the Central Crlm:ins Court, but the Court of Queen's Bench, being the highest court in the kingdom both in criminl and dvil matters having initiated the proceedings aunst the parties, wol not delegate to an inferior jurisdition the power to of eh matter, and the trial will therefore, no donbt, take place in the Court of Quees Bench, before Lord Chief Justice Campbell During the interval that has elapsed since the former inquiry Into the affairs of the Royal British Bank, it is understood that a close investigation has been instituted into all the accounts, with a view to ascertain whetber tber Is any case of securities havir ben made away with that were deposited with the b with written intructions, the disposalbeing contrary to such instructions. This is made a felony by a special Act of Parliament, and Sir John Paul and his partners were convicted under that statute, and sentenced to transportation. At present it appears that no such case has been discovered - but, In the event of there being evidence to sup- rt a charge of this description, it is probable that a ill would be preferred before the grand jury at the Central Criminal Court. It is said that,whenever the trial shall be appointed to take pilce, the defendante will snke an ams p cation to be tried separately, the object of this proceed. 9ig being to confine the eviderce to the particular person under charge, and thus exclude a good deal of evidenoe as to the fraudulent intentions of the parties and the general combination between tbem. The application will, doubtless, be strongly opDosed on behalf of the Crown, and it Is to be hoped, for the sake of public justice, that no technicality wll be allowed to interfere to prevent the whole of the facts oonnected with this disgraceful affair from being brought before the jury and the public, in order that those persons proved to have been concerned in these enormous fraudg mns recelve the punishment they so justly deserve.

CRYSTA4 PALACE RORTIOULTURAL FETE. The se'.:ond exhibition in the Crystal Palace, for the precent season, of flowers, plants, fruits, &a., commenced yesterd-y, and will be continued this day and to-morrow. UrAfortunately, the weather was not very propitious in the early patt of the day, and in coneequence the f9te lacked the Interest and sucocess whioh always wait upon numbers. The attendance at the Palace was small compared with what has been experieaoed on former occasions of a similar kind; but, nevertheless, there was a tolerable gathering of the better class of citizens, and it was observed that, in spite of the heavy showers which fell occasionally, and the oppressive damp with which the atmosphere was charged, there vas a considerable pre. dominanoc of the fairsex. The same cause which kept thousands of persons back from the exhibition prevented those who were present from enjoying the open air attraction of the place, for so saturated were the walks and lawns with moisture that to walk about the grounds was a pastime too ridioulous to be practised. AU were compelled, therefore, to pass the time within the Palace itself, and those to whom the ordinary objects there were so familiar as to have lost the charm of novelty fouud ample sources of enjoyment in the horticultural treat spread out before them. The exhibition was in many respects an exceUent one, but even if it had been otherwise the company would assaredly have enjoyed it, for to those who are doomed at this eeason of the year to endure the din and dust of the metropolis there are few things more pleasant or more thoroughly appreciated than a flower show. The show, which consisted of flowers, fruits, plants, and vegetables, was laid out in the nave of the building, so that ample space was afforded for all to witness it with comfort. On entering from the main staircase the visitor's eye is first drawn towards it by a magnificeut collection of specimens of the Ilium lancifolium, which cover that end of the tables, and which produce a very fine effect. These are followed up by a beautiful display of asters-these again by a range of magnificent hollyhocks-then dahlias of the most brillLant colours, then roses, and so on, the interest of the visitors being sustained to the last. But to be more particular we shall endeavour to specify some of the prominent points of the show. There is a tolerably good collection of stove and greenhouse plants in flower. These show an imr provement, as compared with the same class of plants exhibited last year, and prove what may be done in the way of encouragement for their cultivation. The first prize for this class was gained by Mr. B. Peed, gardener to Mr. Tred. well, of St. John's-lodge, Norwood. The show of variegated plants is very fine; indeed, considering the period of the year to which we have advanced, this may be regarded as one of the most attractive features of the exhibition, though, probably, it may not appear so to casual visitors. There is a fair supply of plants remarkable for fine foliage, and also of exotic orchids. The latter are deemed by judges to be exceedingly good for the season. The first prize for these was gained by Mr. Woolley, gardener to hr. B. Kerr, of Cheshunt. Ferns, both British and exotic, are plentiful and good, this plant becoming every year more and more a favourite with the public. Some beautiful specinens of lycopodiums are exhibited, the first prize for these having been gained by Messrs. Parkes and Williams, of HoUloway. Fuschias are very numerous. So also are the specimens of that fine flower, the achimenes, which show a decided improvement as compared with last year. The show of balsams and cockscombs is very beautiful, and we have already referred to the exceUent effect produced by the lUium lancifolimm. The first prize for the latter was awarded to Mr. James Cutbush, nurseryman, Hfghgate. Of the cut flowers those most deserving of notice are the asters (German and French) and the dahlias. Some of the former have been greatly admired, both for colour and form, though probably the dahlias, many of which are remarkable for beauty, are tbe greatest favourites with the milion. There are 10 exhibitors of 50 dahlias each of one class, and of these Mr. Charles Turner, of Slough, has carried off the first prize. For another class of 24 dahlias there are 30 exhibitors, of which Mr. George Holmes, nurseryman, Norwich, has gained the first prize. There Is a magnificent collection of fancy dahlias, for which Mr. Turner, of Slough, has also carried off the first prize. The first prize for German asters has been gained by Mr. H. Betteridge, of Abingdon; and for French asters by Messrs. A. Paul and Son, nurserymen. The show of fruit is even superior to that of the flowers, and for obvious reasons much more tempting. Grapes, pineapples, peaches, and nectarines are shown in great abundance and of exceUent quality. One pineapple weighs about 121b. The first prize for this description of fruit was awarded to Mfr. Thomas Dawson, gardener to Earl Cowper. ExceUent melons, green and scarlet fleshed, are shown in abundance. Figs, though not numerous, are of good quslity ; and there are exhibited some smaUl plants bearing fruit. Apples and pears are plentiful, and of first-rate quality ; and it is not unworthy of being noted that there appears on the fruit table one solitary dish of strawberries from Birmingham. Among the rarer kinds of firuit exhibited there is a dish of mangoes f:urn-ished by Mr. Scott, gardener to Sir G. Shaunton, of eepark, and some person unknown has added a small dish of pomegranates. As a whole the lexhibition of fruit is admirable, and throughout the whole of yesterday attracted much notice. There is a table set apart for amateurs and cottagers, and it is worthy of notice that the latter have in some instances rivalled the professional gardeners, particularly in fuchsias and the different classes of ferns. The produce of their idtchen-gardens also shows very creditably. The weather, as already stated, prevented the Company from enjo?ing themselves in the grounds, but all seemed to be haPy andjoyous within. Throughout the day the band of the sostr,.am Guards, in addition to the permanent band of the Crystal Palace Company, played favourite airs, and, towards evening especially, drew around them large and admiring audiences.
|LNA1uJ.ATioN OF RussiATN TROPHIEs.-The citizens of Batk made general holyday yesterday on the occasion of the two Russian guns presented to the city by Lord Pan. mure being deposited in the Royal Victoria Park. Besides the ceremony connected with the guns, there was a gramd flower show in the afternoon at Sydney-gardens,a ball in the evening at the Guildhall, and performances at the theatre, in addition to which the Foresters, Odd Fellows, and other bodies had I displays, and f6tes, and galas on their own account. ExcurI sion trains from all the surrounding country poured visitors Into the place, and probably Bath was never more full of company in its palmlest days. The guns, which had been gratuitously mounted on carriages madefrom Russian mnodelsby Mr. Williams, started from the Qnay at 10 o'clock in a procession which Included officers of the army and navy and Crimean invalds. The first gun was drawn by nine gray horses, the second gun by nine bay horses. The guns were on carriages covered with crimson drapery. The Royal Victoria Park is partly private, partly public pro erty. The reatinf-place of the guns has been fixed in the atter portion o the park on each side of the obelisk erected in honour of Her Majesty ; but the inauguration took place in that part of the park facing the Royal-crescent, to which the public were only admitted on payment of 6d. With this exception there was no exclusiveness in the arrangements, which were admirably made and punctually carried out. The procession passed through the principal streets to the place indicated above, where Air. W. Bush (deputy mayor) sormally handed over the guns to the Park Committee, and speeches were made by Mr. Wiliams, the donor of the Icarrages; Dr. Barrett, ohairman of the Park Committee aj lor.General Willes, and Admiul Saunmarez. The speeches I over, the procession re4formed in the original or er and I proceeded to the largo park, where the gums were placed in position. A salute of 21 rounds was then fired from the cannon, and after each seven ronnds the local company of pensioners fired a flu dej6ic. The bands then play ed the National Anthem. and nfter some cheering on the part of he arfe:nbled multitude the ceremony terminated,
DlR. LIVINGSTON ON THB COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS OF AFRICA. Yesterday morning Dr. Livigston, the African traveller, met the members of the Chamber of Commerce, Conmercial Association, and Cotton Supply Association, at the Town-hall, Manchester, and had a most warm and hearty reeoption. There were a. number of ladies present. Sir James Watts, Mayor of Manchester, presided, and on the platform were Mr. Cheetham, M.P., Mr. J. A Tarner, M.P., Hr. Hadfield, MP., MIr. Henry Ashworth, Mr. Edmund Ashworth, Mr. J. C. Harter, and Mr. ML Ross The Mayor having introdueed Dr. Livingston to the meeting,- Mr. H. AsiwostTH presented the following Address to the distinguished visitor:- Chamber of Consmerce and auufactures, " Manchester, Sept. 9. "Sir,-The directors of this chamber beg to UsuDe you of thelheartiest welcome to this city. They have contemplated with feelings of the highest saisaction the labour tn which seo have been enaged in Africa In promoting the extension of cIvilIzatIon and of Chrhsttsaity, and they sincrely conratulate you upon the beneficial reaolta of your exertion BeUeving that commeree and industry may be ldenttded witn clvization and Chrittianity, the directors of this chamber are desirous o expresdng to yon their strong c3nvietton that cotton arid other apir cultural products which are required la this oountry may, with graA; advantage to the native African, be grown by him to exchange for British manufactures, and by enoouragdng prsauits of produoctive labour they asbmit that miseionexy obects mna be supporte while the material comfort and enjoyment of the people of Africa may be rendered commensurate with those reasonable desires which ceamsed intelligence always suggests. ' On your return to the arduous labours in which you haye been engaged Yon need not be told that you are accompanied by the warmeat wiebs and sympathies of your friends, who ardently commend you to the care of a wise Providence, in the drm reliance that your renewed mission will be ittended with abundant blesdngss " I have the honour to be, on behalf of the directors of this Chasn. ber of Commerce, 8ir, your inozt obedient servant. ThOics BAZry, President. " To the Rey, Dr. iAingston, kc," Dr. LivniasToN, in reply, returned his warmest thanks for the welcome thus offered him, and said the approbation of the merchants of Manchester afforded a powerful stimulus to the further prosecution of his efforts. (Hear, hear.) He agreed with them cordially in the sentiment that the Africans ought to be encouraged to cultivate the raw materials of English manufactures; and he was so fuly convinced of the elevating tendency of lawful com. merce, together -with the probable influence which the course specified promised to have on the slave trade and slavery, that he proposed to devote the next few years of his life to special efforts in that direction. ("Hear, hear," and applause.) A peculiar and rather annoying combination of circumstances had placed the great Anglo-American raee, on which undoubtedly the hopes of the world for liberty and progress rested, in a very trying posi! tion Our demands for sugar and cotton were daily increasing, those demands were at present met in great measure by slave labour; but the great body of AngloAmericans would unquestionably prefer to have their wants supplied by free men, and, he ventured to hope that the discovery of a new region, well adapted for raising those articles, might be a providential opening for enabling us to escape from our anomalousposition. Before attemptingto give some Idea of this new field for commercial enterprise, it might be mentioned that, while he proDosed to try to maake the Zambese River a permanent path to the inland healthy region, with a view to the wide diffusion of civilization and Christianity, and endeavouring to link the interests of the African with our own, he had felt that it would not be right in him to do tbis at the expense of those who eontributed their money for purely religious purposes; but the gentlemen he now addressed, in common with others, had contributedhandsomely, in the way of testimonial fumds, to relieve his mind from care with respect to his family (eheers), and he begged to tender them his very grateful acknowledg. ments. (tllters.) Mr. J. CIEETHAM, MP., said, all he had to say was to assure the rev. Doctor that not only in this great city, but also in the county of Laneaster, so intimately associated with mercantile interests, his labours and discoveries were appreciated as they ought to be by an inteligent community. (Elear, hear.) It was true that, at the present moment, this district was particularly interested in one article of produce which the Doctor assured them might bs cultivated in the regions he had traversed, but they did not wish to confine their interest to that specific artce. AS commercial men, they were desirous to take notice of the whole cultivation of those regions, and, as Christians, they wished him God speed in the great labour which he had undertaken. (Applause.) It had been suggested that In order to eicit the information which the doetor was desirous of giving them he should propose to him a series of questions. He had iirst to ask Dr. Livingston what were the peculir productions of the districts which he had visited ? Dr. Lr-MosroTN, who referred to a map suspended on the platform, said, it would be observed that the country through which the Zanmbesi flowed was abundantly watered by the numerous rivers which joined it. South of latitude 'A0 there was a country remarkably destitute of water,where one might travel four full days without obtaining a single drop of water, there being no rivers south of that line - but the country to the north of it was totaUy different. While in the south the vegetation was altogether thorny, there being a prodigious number of different kinds of thorns, the northern and vell-watered country produced a vegetation without thorns. The majority of the trees there were evergreens; maany of them had the appearance of laurels and orange trees. In that country there were a great many different kinds of fruits, most of which he believed to be totally unknown to Europeans, He brought home about 25 or 26 different kinds of fruit, some of which vwere valu. able as yielding oil a nd, in the central part of the country, ealled Lunda, wOere the seeds were abundant, the fleshy part was eatable, and the oil vas used by the natives for anointing their bodies. Among so great a variety doubtless some mnst be good for food, though, perhaps, from having been usually pretty haungry, he could not be suppcsed to be a very good judge. (Laughter). Nearer to the coast, eastwards, the people cultivated large unatities of cucumbes, and their best salad oil was made rom the seds of cacumbers. Throughout the whole country the ground-nut was cultivated in large quantities -used as food and for oi ; and they had also castor oil throughout the country, their only use for it being to anoint their heads and bodies, though it was not a very agreeable unguent. Mr. Cn va&m then inquired as to the dyes known in the country. Dr.LnrNcs,roNsaid, in Angola the natives knew of avery great many different dyes, which they were not very willing to make known to Europeans. The Columba root was exported by the Americans in abundance as a dye stuff, and grew along the Zambesi river. Besdes this, there wai throughout the country indigo-the kind caUed the silver indigo-with which the people dyed their clothes, and which grew wild, for it was not at all cultivated. The only expor. tation of it was by the Portuguese who lived at Tete, but it might be exported abundantly. n reference to ootton Dr. LTvPsGooN added, that very large quantities of it were cultivated by the natives, and one small district, between the rivers Conza and Loanda, produced 1,300 cloths annually, of cotton grown by the natives, spun by the women, and woven by the men In the great valley to the east of Angola the grass was generally so high that, when on his ox, he was obliged to hold up his hand to keep it out of his eyes. The natives never employed any manure, and the more the gronnd wae worked the more fertile it became. The whole of Angola, if it had been in the hands of Englishmen, for its lsze, would have produoed much more cotton and sugar than any part of the Southern States of America. (Hear, hear.) Mar. CnaEETHAX-Then, with reference to hemp and flax? Dr. LMiNsrToN said, coming down the Zambesi to Tete he fonnd that somehow or other information had got out there that The `ismes newspaper had offered a reward of 1,0004 for a fibre proper for making paper. His opinion was asked as to whether the report was true. The only answer he could give vras that if 2Vie Times had said it the 1,0004. was certain if they could only get the proper fibre. (laughter.) He then advised them to get some of the fibres they had in abundance, which might be used in the manufacture of paper. They brought a kind of aloe, and another soft fibrous substance found round the roots of the wild date tree. Neither of these would be good for the purpose- but they likewise brought another termed "buaze," wfich he had known simply as used for making threads to string beads upon. In other parts the sinews of animals were used for that purpose; bht this root was quite as strong, and when one attempted to break it it felt As if it would cut the finger. He brought home some of it, and presented it to Pye Brothers, in Lombard-street, who put it through their new process for treating such fibres, and they gave it as their opinion, after consulting one of the first manufacturers in Leeds, that the fibre was finer and stronger than flax, and it was worth between M. and 601. aton. This plant was probably not known to botanists at all. It was said to grow abundantly on the north bank of the Zambesi, but was never cultivated. The north bank was much more fertile than the south bank. AIr. CEMAMr.-You have aluded to cotton on the west cOat; is any grown on tho east? Dr. LIVINGSTON said, it grew abundantly on the west, and that vas by far the best field for cotton, On the east it was cultivated a little, but it was not so good. It clung to the seed, and an iron roller had to be used to separate it. The quantity grown on the east side was very much smallo than that on the west side, but the natives had never beon induced to cultivate cotton; they had never been offered anything for it, and they only cultivated a little to make clothes or themselves. He believed if they had a market they would cultivate largely, for wherever they had the opportunity of sclling anything they immediately began to collect it. (EHear, hear.) There was a trade between Loando and Brazil in wax, which was necessary for the churches in Brazil. This trade had been developed in Angola and in the central country of Lunda, as they passed through the dense forests, he and his party observed that the natives had placed hives every few hundredysards be'ween the trees, and seemed to collect every ounce of wax. The Portuguese gave a very good price for it in Angola. The country abounded in honey, and the travellers were caUed by the honey-bird three or four times a day. It invited persons to folow it and take the honey, and his (Dr. Livingston's) men got a good deal of it. Tnis had nover been made an article of export. Some of his men endeavoured, without success, to sell their wax at Tote. If they had a market he believed the natives would cultivate articles of produce with eargerness. (Hear.) When he trvedlled into that central country, endeavouring to find a pat to the sea, he found the natives were equally anxious to get to the sea, to have traffic wvith the wbite men. It vwas a long wvay fromn Tete, and by the time he got there all his goods were expended, bat the chief fitted himi out with lo oxen and canoes, and 27 men, and sent presents of butter and fat to the chiefs in Loando. The men wvent all the way, to Loando without hope of wages, though he afterwards paid them. While there they worked and collected all they could to take back to their own country of articles from the white men's country, where everything beautiful came from; and thougb, owing to continual detentions, sometimes by his own fever and sometimes by that of his men, they returned as oor as they set out, they were received 'with the great rt kindness, because they had opened up the path. The people had no idea that sugar could be got from the sugar cane, although the sugar cane abounded in their country, and when he told them of it the chief asked him to make Eome. He (Dr. Livingston) explained that it could only be done by a machine. Then, asked the chief, would he bring him a machine from bis own country? He explained that he was a poor man, and it required something considerable to purchase one. The chief replied, "'Why the whole of the ivory of the country is yours, and if you leave any of it it is your own fault." (LAnghter.) The chief gave him a commission to the east coast, and fitted him out well a second time, all in the hope of having intercourse with the white men. (Hear, hear.) Mr. CHEE1HC -Can you give us any information as to the cereals? Dr. LnusvGSo. said wheat had never been tried in the central country. The Portuguese came to Angola to make a little money, and go back to Portugal, aud they devoted tbemselves entirely to the trade in ivory and beeswax. The country p roduoed beautiful wheat, and he saw it growring on the high lands with ears the length of his hand. The high land produced it without irrigation, and it might be grown there to almost any extent. It was quite remarkable that the Portuguese did not caltivate it. because they paid the Americans handsomely for all the flour and biscutsFthey consumed; and he found they had Irish butter Ifrom Cork. The east side of the country also produoed wheat. The Zambese overflowed large tracts of country annuaUy, like the Nile. The Portuguese had been in the habit of cultivating the wheat on that side of the country all it required was that a slave woman with a little hoe shonld imake a hole in the ground, drop a few seeds in, and push back the soil with her foot. Infour months there was a crop of beautiful wbeat. This simple operation answered all the purposes of our gubsoiling, plolaghing, draining, liming, and manuring. The higher they went up the better the wheat was. At Zumbo the grain I was twice the size it was at Tete, where it was rather smalL It had never been tried in the high lands in the interior. The country ascended eastward irom the west coast to a height of 5,000 feet above the sea; then it desoende4 into the central vaUey, where the rivers on both sides contributed to the Zambese in the middle, and this river flowed from north to south. leaving the vaDey by a fissare or creek in the ridge of 30 miles long, which formed the most beautiful sight he had seen in Africa. There were two ridges on that side of the vaUey, one of 5,000 feet. The bottom of the vaUey and the coasts were very unhealthy, but the high lands were very healthy. The central hoUow contained herbage excessively rank. The healthy ridges were remarkably well adapted for the production of grain. The natives cultivated a k-ind of miUet, often called Caflre corn; another kind of millet, somewhat larger, and likewise our own milet. Mr. CHEETHAm.-Dil you find any sheep or goats' wool? Dr. LnrUGSTON-E thought the only wool he had seen was on the heads of the people. (Laughter.) The sheep there had hair instoad of wool, and the men's heads had wool instead of hair. (Applause and laughter.) However, inland from Benguela, there was a long stretch of cold elevated country, where the sheep actually had wool, and cattle flourished remarkable welL Mr. CMETnLA3L-What did you see of metallic produoe? Dr. LVISGSroS said, throughout the country there ap. peared to be plenty of knives, axes, and hoes, and near the sea there were igneous rocks shot up, with fine iron ore. The Portuguese (}overnment employed the natives in working iron. At Kasembi a good deal of malachite was found. He had not seen copper ore in its proper place. A number of the native hoes had been made into an Enfield rifle for hbim (Dr. Livin ston) at Birmingham, the maker pronouncinig the metal very good, resembling, but not equal to, Swedish or Russian iron. It abounded along tbe Zambesi. In reply to subsequent inquiries, Dr. LIVn;GSTON said there were extensive tracts of forest land. There were nine seams of coaL He examined one near Tete, which was about GS inchesin diameter; the coal having been tilted to the surface by volcanic action. Lieutenant Hoskins, who had command of one of the gunboats now gone to China, had given his opinion that the bar at the real moath of the Zambesi was no impediment to commercial purposes, as there were 22 feet of water upon it,; and though the river was rather tortuous he would not hesitate to take up a steamer of the same capacity ashis gunboat. The river was at the flood during four or five months of the year. Mr. CHzvTHuL-What article, as a medium of commerce. couid the natives best cultivate at the present moment? Dr. LIayuusToN believed cotton would be the best for them to begin with, and that they would cultivate it if they were assured of a market. Now that they had abundance of land they did not feel the necessity of improved cultivation. He described the feeling of the natives as strongly in favour of the English, whom they contrasted favourably with the Boers and Portuguese. In the west the population was very mach milder in character than in the east; the possession of a single cannon was quite enough to overawe a whole district. As to the effect of the climate on the English constitution, the most important point he had ascertained was that there were two healthy ridges in the country. The Portuguese authorities had treated him with the greatest kindness, and appeared to regard his labours as favourable to the extension of their commeroe. In Angola skilled labour was to be had for 4d. a-day, field labour for 2d., and he believed it might be got, by paying in calico, the usual currency of the country, at about ld. a-day. He proposed, on going back, to distribute cotton seeds among all the chiefs on the banks of the river, and endeavour to give the impression that aU they produced would be purcbased. The beginning must necessarily be small and not profitable, but he thought if the natives could be engaged in lawful commerce it would put an end to the slave trade in all that central region. (Cheers.) Mr. J. A. TuRnh, M.P., expressed, on behalf of the commercial community, their thanks to Dr. Livingston for his visit, and for the interesting details into which he had entered at this meeting. Be moved:- "That this meoetndesresrto express their warmest thanks to Dr. livingston for his vsi to anchetter, to record theirapprpiation of the importance of his disooveries their high saee of his noble exertiorns for the extenaon of knowledge, as wellas bis self-devetlen In agate seeking to vist those hItherto unexplored coutries with a view to their cIvlzatIon by the aids of Christianity and commerce; that, feeling a deep interest in the self-denying laboucs of Df. dvingston. this meeting earnestly requests Her Msjert'a7 Government wi place at his dispocal a steam boat, duly appotated and capable o acendingthe navigable portion of the Zambed4 with such furtheracommodation in boats and otherwise as may he deemed sufficient for the exploratioa of Its tributaries, and for obtaiitg and retaining friendlr relatSons with the natives of that interea ng. region; and the public bodies now a-smbled pledge themselv to use their utmost exertions for the promotion of these obiecu; that this meeting desires to impress on Her Majet's Gover ment their earnefs desire thst the aid of the Portuguese Government should be sDecially requslted towarda faciitating In every possible manner the fmther researches of Dr. Lisngaton In the Interior of Africa, and more especially in the di,tscts surrounding the river Zambesi and its tributaies; tbat a sub-committee of the following gentlemen, being the chairmen of the publc bodea bere assembled. be empowered and requested to carmy out the resolution of this meeting, with power to add to their number:-Mr. John Cheesham, M.P., Mr. T.

The object was of national importance, and it was hardly reasonable that aU should be left to private exertion, or private mercantile capitaL to develope a country in which much would have to be done before commercial operations could be fairly entered upon. Mr. G. HADrIELD, M.P., in seconding the resolution, pointed to the facts detailed by Dr. Livingston, as showing howlittle this great commercial country had yet drawn upon the resources of the world. We were complaining of a want of codton and silk, and other produets, and yet what an inexhaustible world the great Giver of all seemed to have bestowed if we only mAode a right use of it. The motion was carried with applause. Dr. FLrv=ImSTOx wished briefly to express his sense of the great kindness Lord Clarendon had already shown himn and especially by the interest he took in his safety while in Africa. Mr. EDnr3UD ASlHAtORtTs moved a vote of thanks to the mayor for presiding. Mr. JOHN Cnxrrnx, MilP., in seconding the motion, contrasted the importance of the discoveries to be made in Africa to this country with what couald have resulted by the discovery of the "North-West Passage," on which such vast sums had been exuended. From a conversation he had had with a person recently connected with the exploration of the interior of Australia he gathered that the centre of that great continent could never sustain a population, bht, from what Dr. Livingston had seen, it appeared that the interior of Africa in some places WaS well watered, and was capable of supplying products of vast importance to the commerce and to the happiness of the rest of the world. (HIear, hear.) The motion Was carried, and the meeting then sepaIratd Dr. Livingston was to address A meeting in the evening on the missionary prospects in Africa. 'c" ~ ----

i ZORD BROUGHIAAIT MANCHESTZR. On Tuesday evening the RiBbt Hon Lord Brougham attended the annual meeting of the Instittional socia tion of Lancashire and Cheshire, at the Mechaic' Institution, Manchester, on the nvitation of the Committee df Management, for the purpose of presenting the pnizes awFarded to pupils at the late annual exaiaion. His Lordship ws accompanied by Sir Benj,nmin HIeywood, Bart., Ifr. Cbeetham, ML, B. Wili Brown, MY., aond cher; Crok, M.P., and was reoelved on entering with His Lordship having taken the chair, Mr DAiVM MIoRRIS read the annual report of the Insti tution, which stated that 100 literary, mechaniose and mutual improvement societies were in the association, contabning an aggregate of 19,880 male and 2,160 female members, excluive of day aholar The libraries contain 160,800 volumes, and the evening clase were attended b 8,050 males and 600 females. Answers to questions to each institute, as to what were the most attractive features, reported that In 30 it was the reading-room, in 28 the cla , IL the library. in two the lectures, in two the singing. ani in one (the P&tricroft) the coffee,-only 75 having auswered the question. There had been 60 members passed at the annual exanmination, to whom Lord Brougham now, with the asistance of Dr. Hudson, presented prizes and certificates. Among them were four young wromen, one of wshom, at Pendleton, had learnt to write in sdx months, that she might correspond with her hnsband, a soldier, then in the Crlmea lord BRouSGAm, who rose amid great cheering, then said,-I am sure that all who are here present will approve what I have just done, though the attempt has been unsuccessful-namely, to call upon the excellent member for this county, Mr. William Brown (cheers), to express himself what I know he feels, but rather delegates to me the expression of-his great satisfaction at what he has een and heard this evening. (Hear, hear.) When Iname Mr. Brown I name ono who has been a most steady and most effective, and, I will add, a most munificent patron of pnblic education (cheers), not only by the prizes which he ha given-part of those which have just besn distributed being his gift-but also by that great act of his in the-I won't call it the neighbouring, stiU less the rival, but the friendly town of Liverpool (" Hear, hear," and cheers)-a greater act of murniicence than which I never have either seen or heard of. (Cheers.) Now, when last I had the pleasure of addreosing you, not in this building, but in the former residence of the Mechanics' Institution (hear, hear), 22 years ago, I took leave to state that there were some things less palatable, but more wholesome, than mere vague commendation and congratnlation,-some things which resemble certain drugs that are bitter to the taste, but may yet-they do not alvays, Heaven knows (laughter)-prodnce a good effect; and one of those things was to find fault where fault ought to be found, at the same time that commendation was given where praiso was due. (Hlear, hear.) Upon that occasion I certainly had great reaon-I won't say to blame, but to express my regret at the very smaU progress amoug our brethren of the working classes which mechanics' institutes, apprentice libraries, and establishments of that most useful, and I wil even add most necessary description, had then made; and I said that many years before that, and it is now upwards of 35 years since, we who had the first hand in establishing mechanics' institutions in this country (hear, hear) had found very great reason to lament the indifterence with which at first the working-clUsses of our feUow-subjects received the boon that was held out to them, and the slowness wth which, even after years and years had elapsed, they profited by thee institutions. I am most happy to find that since that year 1835 there has been very great progress made in this county, as weeU as elsewhere, in extending the benefits of such institutions among those classes for whom they weremore especially intended. At the time to which I referred, in 1824 or 1825, when I took the liberty of issuing an address to the working classes and their employers,I stated that it was absolutely necessary, in order to indnee the former to take kindly to such institutions, that the managetnent of them should more or less be left in their hands (hear, hear); and it was proposed that the rule should be that something like twvo-thirds, or three-fourths, of the committee of management should consist of the working men themselves. (Hear, bear.) To a certain de this succeeded, but I afterwards found that my friend in Carhsle and in other parts of Cumberland but particularly in in Carlisle, for there it had Itg origin, had carried it further My friend, Dr. Elliott, who was, I think, afterwards mayor of the city, and was long an eminent practitioner there, and a warm friend of such institutions-he and his friends there bad established as the absolute and peremptory rnle that the whole manuging committee, without any exception whatever, unless it were sometimes a chdarman or vice-chairman, should consist of men living by weekly wages. Not that those men in their committee would anyhow di*dain the aid that might be offered them, either by dvioe or by-I won't say more substantial id, for good advice may be the most valuable of asastance, but by presents of books, or machinery, or money; on the oontrary, they would most thankfully and respectfnuy receive such presents, a3 also any hints and suggestions that might accompany them; but the rule was as I have said, and I should speak of it as the Cumberland rule, because it has been extended to other institutions than those of Carlsle, and with the most perfect success. I baro made inquires as to the present stte of that question to which I am now referring, the question of these institutions beimg found to benefit not merely the middle classes and the upper classe of society, as in too man la the *havebee found to do. Not that I complain of their giving that benefit; quite tho contrary, for the more instrUCtion and education are promoted among those classes, so much the better; but my complaint was, and our complaint at that time generaUy was, that the benefit was confined to those classes, and did not reach our humbler feUow-citizens. (Hear, hear.) I have made inquiries as to the p resent state of the case in Carlisle. I find that the mechanics' institution founded in 1837, 20 years ago, before this rule was established, has an excellent library, an excellent room, and 500 members, of whom only 25 are working men Then comes 1848, when this rnle was first introduced, and another iustitution was established, which has 250 mnembers, of whom 224 are men supporting themselves by weeklywagex, only six of the wholo numberbeing other than common workingmen. Theyhave alibraryof nolesstharl,200 volumes. In 1849 anotber institution was established, with a reading-roomand alibraryof 1,000 volumes. Here there are 150 members, every one of whom is receiving veekly wages. (Hear, hear.) And there are other institutions-one of 70 members, another of 90, another of 3C, another of 30, and anotber of 12, making altogether, with the 25 in the ori&inal mechanics' institution of 1837, about 640 working men in the city of Carisle. A similar result has taken place in my own immediate neighbourhood of Penrith, and other places in tb part of the oountry, and it has extended very much into the neighbourin counties of Northumberland and Durham. But in the instanoo of Carlisle alone 640 working men attending almost every evening in the week a readingroom, and benefiting by the exeeUent libraries-that number in population of 30, 000 gives a proportion which, if it were equalled in the town where I have now the happiness of addressing you, would be answered by 8,000 or 9,000 working.men But I am very sorry to say that is by no means the proportion in Manchester, for I believe the number is not much above 2,000 in this great town. In the other towns in your disti'ct, such as Stockport and Bolton, and others which are connected with the asociation whose prizes we have this evening presented to the pupils, thore is, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, a considerably greater number of working men than there are in Manchester itself; but that is always the case with very large towns. But that very great progress is making in all branches of education there cannot be the least doubt, and one circumstanco that I have heard of with the greatest satisfaction proves it more than any other. It is that within the last 10 or 12 years those dmirable institutions, the Sunday schools, are no longer restricted to mere instruction on the Lord's day, but instruct their pupils on the week days also, so that hundreds, and I hope very soon we shaU say thousands, and I might almost say at present, taking the whole of that circuit with which we are connected, and which numbers about 2,000,000 of inbabitants, that thousands of Sunday schools are not merely obtningthe inestimable benefits of Snndayschool tuition, hbt on the week dZys are taught resaing, writing, arithmetic, geography, and other useful and, I may almost say, necessary branches of knowledge. (Cbeerm) I sm sure nothing can be more gratifying than the sight which you have all witnessed this evening. Some of the pupils who have received the well-deserved praise of your applause, as weU As the premium and certificates, are of the most tender age. There was one of 15, another of 14, one or two at 16, and ono as young as 12; and that youngest of all, to my astonishment, receives a prize for his progress in the knowledge of social economy. (" ear," and cheers.) It is much too late now to raise any question-though I am, unfortunately, old enough to remember much question being raised upon it-or even to whisper sany doubt of the right of the bulk of our feliow-count,-rmen, of aU ranks and classes, to receive not only ord;nary instruction, but also sonnd instruction on the subject in which the working classes nave tse greatest interest of al-I mean poitica philosophy, the knowledgo of social subjects, and the improvement of our laws, in the amendment of which no class has so immodiate-I Will say immmodiAto-an interost as thesrorking classes themselves (Cheers.) Idohope and trust, though it is much too far for these good men to go themselves, thatl shalemoet,wben Igo in the capacity of president of the congress to be held at Birmingham in the middle of next month on the subject of aU the improvoments that have taken plac, and are about to take plce, and are in contemplation, in matters connected with the social interests of the community-what may bo called social economy-I hope and trust I shall have the happiness on that occasion of meeting some representatives of the cLasses of our working men in this great town of Manchester. (Rear, hear.) I have said that there are some things less patable, but more wholesomo, than mere congratntions; and therefore I am abont to addres3 a few words partly to the working men themselves-thoso classes from which come the pupils who have beenrewarded this evening, and partly to the employers of those classes and the patrons and supporters of these mstitutions. First, with respect to the institutions themselves. It is a good and safe rule that they should not attempt too much. In many places attempting lectures has been a failure. I ws not aware until I came here yesterday, and particularly till I heard the roport which Mr. Morris has read this evening to how greLt an extont lectures had in this part oi the kingdom been of late a failure. But that which is no failure, which requires very much less funds to support it, less trouble and entreaty among the working classes to get them to attend, is the furnishing of good, useful, and interesting books for them to read, The plan of the itinerating libraries has been s0 suocessfnl that in whatever town or village tha itinerant library sojourns for three or four weeks in the conrse of its progress there is no other beok in demand in tbat place, so much homage is paid to the judicious selection of the works which load those boxes of the itinerating library. (Rear, hear.) It is remotely conno;td wit that remark that I should make another observation by way of advioe to all the lOO ieZtmff connected In the counties of Leneszire and Cheshir I would strongly inculoate tho absolute necesity of the most careful attention to regular prooedinfg in point of finnce, so as never to have any oonfusion In the aopcota -never any iaocuracy, either in the keeping of them, e the applying of the funds, or in the raising of the fun&andatoioeto stop, as it is their duty, ax well &a Zi; Interest, when they find that anv fund is deficient, and not. to go on with the expense one month or one day beyond the,thinethey can afford it. (Hear, hear.) I have known, so much mischief to arise from the neglect of this. rule, which is not only the rule of policy, hout of thkat which is the best policy, the rule of honesty itselI (hear, hear)-and I am alluding to no initution whatever in LAncs hire, Cheshire, er Yorkshire, or the four northern counties, but further to the southward there, have been the gretest poblae nisohiefa arising from tho. neglect of this rule, and from not remembering, not only generally and vaguely that which all men are very apt to. admit, that "honesty is the bhet poliey," but that thorule ought to he, "Owe no man anything `" and that a soon as you find you canot go on without defrauding your Creator of uis due, for that Is the rel meaning of Is, it iS your duty to atop and -wind un, and -y, " We find we have no funds for going lurther." Through. the neglect of this plin and obvious rue institutions are about to be given up, not only to the great injury oE those who might, had they still been carried on judiciously, fairly, and regularly, have continued to profit by them, bib to tke groat disrepute of the whole s; Aem, which the, enemies, if any such still there are, of populr instruction, rnquitesure to lay hold of and turn against us. (Hear,, hear.) This last rule which I have urged is applicable tothe working classes themselves, but there re also one ortwo other remarks which I would fain address to them. There are two courSes of conduct of which I won't say tbat. I should rigorously and without anypossibllity of exoeption reqmre one to be the rule, but as to which somewhere abouta m=idle course might be taken. We havo often heard oF to asses of men-one making a pleare of business and the other, proceeding on a perfectly opposite principle, making business of pleasure. And those classes adopt twoc different forms of a very old proverb which ets forth that "home is home, be it never so homely." One class adoptu' that form, but the otber is rather disposed to say " home iJhomely, be It never so home" (laughter); and aecordinglywosee not a few instances in the upper as well as the working classes of persons anxious as often as they canto leave theirhome, either for innoceut amusements, or for the tavern, or tho alehonse, or the gaming-house. Iam veryfarfrom saying that I would rigorously interdict all moving from home, aLk going up and down upon different occasions, in moderation, innocently, prudently; or from requiring tbat men should' belong to that classwd which there ae but few members, who make apleasue of their bosineas. on the contray, I think there is an ol,l proverb which says. " AUl work and no play makes Jack a dnul boy." But our amusemen. should always be subordinate to busisess, and even instruction itself, the slaking the thirst of knowledge, should be made subordinate to the avocations of 'necessarywork. Thefirstdutyofamrnist-provldeforblsownindependence by his own work, and not either to amuse himself or indulge In any gratification-not even in that more tham innooent, most sacred gratification, of assuaging his thirstfor knowvledge, until he has done his dav's work, and done, that which it is his bounden duty as well as his highest interest to do, work with his ownn hnds for the provision of himself and his family. (Cheersr) And when I talk of working men-I *m msnyelf, and have been all my life. a working man (great cheering)-and as long as f am blessed with health enough to continue, even at, my advanoead time of life, I shall continue to labour (cheers); and I shall never henceforth, any more than I have hitherto done, partake of any relaxation, not even in gratifying my thirst for knowledge, until I have earned theright to do it by having done my day's work. (Cheers . There are other rules as to which I would allow no compromise, no middle course whatever, and they are thb maxnims which ought to preside over a man's whole employment of his time. The one is to do one thtng at a time, cnly; the next is never to put off tili to-morrow what yom, can do to-day; and the third, always to finish one thing before you begin another. A very great and most celebrated man in HoUand-De Witt-was once asked how it happened that he got through so much business and ofC such varied kind, tor he was not only a groat statesman, andc. a Minister, hut also a most eminent mathematician and a. literary man; and his answer was that it ws by two rulese which he always observed-to do one thing only at a time, and nover to put off till to-morrow what he could do today. These wore his golden rules. I knew a great states. man, now no mere, of another country, who used to say,. on the other hand, his principle wa, ' Never to do to-day what you could put off tUIl to-morrow." (rAughter.) And when I cried out against this as a most heterodox political doctrino he gave me half a dozen instances in which aguch advantage had oocurred from hisn continual procras=alon of measures that were pressed' upon him. These were certainly the exoeptions to the rule. I admit that he urged his perverse maxim rather by way of pleasantry than anything else, and I think it was no recommendation of it that he could produce so few instances in its favour. (Hear, hear.) Having detained you so long, I will not now say much on the great advantae of regularhabits and of strict attention not merely to what is commonly caUed honesty, which of course no man doubts it is his bounden duty as weU as his highest interest to adhereto, but to guardinc against those irregularities which degenerate into dishonesty, though when first admitted they seem to have no appearanos at all aniaogous to it. Let me only add one word on the absolute necersity that, as at Carlisle and in other parts of the northern counties, the. rule should be for all institutions to be seelf-spporting, an otherwise they could not beyond a very short time be continued at alL (Hear, hear.) I hope you will excuse me forhaving detained you so long, and perhaps so superfuously, on the present occsion, but I could not do otherwise, when I had the happiness of finding myself onoo more among you, than give vent t* those feelings which I have of gratification at whaLt has ocourred here this night, and the sight of these intellectual young men carrying off the prizes, and also of making a smaltr return, the only rettnn I could make, to you for your kind. attention, by giving utterance to one or two maxims which are alwa ys admitted in general terms, but wrhich in practice> are very much too often neglected. (Lond cheers. ) The proceedings concluded with a vets of thanks to the, nobleod. for preidting on this occasion, which was moveD by l. Bsow>, h., and seconded by Mr. Cusxrss,
