I THE INDILdN MUTINIES. - -- - -- w A TRIP ON THE GANGES. The following is a copy of a second letter froma an Indian officer to his father, dated July 18, containing particulars of the advance of the steamer Berhampooter up the Ganges, for the relief of Cawnpore:- "I was despatched with 100 of my men, two guns, and 12 artillerymen (the lst Fusileers)in the steamer, which waj placed at my command and under my orders, to proceed tv Cawnpore, and assist a laud column of 400 more of my regiment in relieving the garrison, which hsd been sur. rounded for many weeks by a force of 2,000 rebel Sapoys, who were well supplied with ammunition of all kinds, al they had made themselves masters of oar magazines, arsenals, &c. A steamer had not been up this way for many years, and the trial thenwasa failure; so, as the countrywas in tha rebels' hands on both banks of the river, you may imaoine I did not start with a light heart, especially as everybody said I could not do i,; however, I did not urge one objection, and I thank God Ihave arrived here in safety, without the loss of a single man or foUower, though I have many a hole in the steamer, to show what round shot wiU do to an iron steamer. We had no coals, and had to forago for fuel every day, and as we cornmenced the second day to coUect it under fire of about 500 matchlockmen in the Oude country with a big gun, my prospect of getting to Cawnpore lookel bad; however, I set the foUowers to work for the wood, took half my men with rifles to thrash the enemy, which we did in half an hour, besides charging them and taking theic gun, and in less than two hours wO wero under steam, but the Ganges is such a rapid river that we could scarcely move against the stream, never got moro than two miles an hour, and now and then had, when going round a corner, to leave some of the boats we were towing (with our provisions, wood, &ac,) and get them round one at a time. Oar second attack we escaped without hurt, only two round shot lodged in some safe part of the vemsel; besides we were at some distance from the fellow, who was pitching into us from a high bank, but with our Eufield rifles we managed to kiU one and wound fivo, so ho told us afterwards, for I had a little correspondence with him after that. About the 3d day I had information sent me that the Cawnpore garrison had faUen by treachery; the scoundrels promised them a safe passage to Allahabad by the river if they would give in, but no sooner did they get hold of the garrisonthan they massacred aU the men. Upon this news I was ordered to keep with General Havelock's column, which had been sent on to strengthen our first party, adding some 1,200 men to the force, and we went our daily distance together, they by land, I by water; but as I was waiting for General Havelock's force to reach me (we were from five to eight miles from each other every day), and as wO were taking it easy, late one afternoon whack came a round shot right across our deck, breaking the spoke of a gunwheel, and taking off a mau's pouch; then another through the vssel's iron side. We soon returned tho compliment from our guns and rifles at about 900 yards' distance, but their guns were so completely hidden by long grass that we could only fire at their smoke. It took us an hour to geo up steam and move ovor to them, but we saved several men's ivesby piling up the bedding and the valises round the deok. The shot then went into the bedding, cutting up the contents, but were effectuaUystoppedat that distance. Bythetimewe got across the river some 300 matchlock men were ready on a highbank, their gunsiz amarshinfrontof thembutnot to be seen, so, as it was getting dark, I thought discretion was the best, and moved off for the night out of raDge. The next morning the fellows were all gone. I waited here for two days, aud was told that two guns were waiting for me a little higher up. I got up stesam, and was going off, when a letter was sent me from a powerful Zemindar, an Onde man, the owner of the two guns, saying that he had heard I had a steamer full of Europeans and was about to attck him, but that he begged I would not do so, as he was a failthful servant of Government, &c. I believe It was the isme scoundrel that fired upon me, but he had heard also I that our land column had that morning had their first brush with the rebels and taken 11 guns, so ho thought it best to knock under at once. I passed his town about two hours atterwards; he had two guns in position, a lot of horsemen, and a cloud of matchlock men; but my object was to get to Cawuvpore, and cross our troops over to the Lucknow side in the steamer, so I left my friend in peace. He had a beautiful place, and a large house or castle-looking place, which from its position, height, &c., put us all in mind of Wind| ,or Castle. "At mynext difficult place to pass the owneralso sent me a letter of submission, so I completed my voyage in peace yesterday at noon. " The Oude Bank of the river is most besutiful all the way, and has a parklike appearanoe-largo trees and groen lawns covered with cattle, and ploughs going. No wonder a Governor-General coveted the country. If he had disarmed t we should have had less work to do now, but it must be done, for it is a country of robbers, who will loot anybody and anything. The land-column was met by the rebels twice before it entered Cawnpore. It took in all 26 guns, and has now driven the scoundrels some miles out of the station. It is as I am writiug stil in pursuit, but we have no cavalry, so I fear they will yet escape punishment. " Oar hands are tied till we get more troops, especally cavalry, and I fear we cannot move on to Lucknow for many days to come, for a large force must be left here, and I don't suppose our present moveable column exceeds 1,500 of all arms. More are on their way from Calcutta, and by this timae I trust a goodly force has set sall from England. We must have a force now of 20,000 sent and added to the present European Indian force, which has been reduced to such an extentthat this present outbreak has arisen. For years these Mahomedans have been biding their time and trying to get the Hindoos to help them, and they have succeeded for a time. One old subadar the other day, who was not quite so bad as his neighbours, and who had got some of his officers to escape, put a bag of money (901.) in one of their hands, and said, ' You English must now go, we have now got the Hindoos on our side, we are too strong, and our arragements are so complete nothing can resist us ; besides, you have made a great mistake, you think tho King Of Oude is at the head of this, but it is the King of DelLi who is to be King of India. As soon as you have gone I then take all the troops here to Delhi.' Th:s occurred near Benares, but ater the officers were in boats the brutes of Sepoys went after them, and shst them and took the money; but it is more than I can writa to tell you of all the frightful scenes that have occurred and are still taking place. No one would believe that menvbo have lived a idvlized life under our rulo for so many years could have committed these atrocities, and really without reason, except that they have been treated too kindly. The cause of the outbreak and of so many being among the rebels is that the heads of the mutiny have worked upon the Sepoys' minds that it was the intention of the English to make Christians of the whole of the army and people of India, and they had worked them up to such a pitch that the greased cartridges coaling just at the time, and thoss little cakes being cleverly and artfully distributed by the post-offico authorities to nearly every village in India, settled the business. "tNatives, especially thoesohigh caste north country fellows, would lose anything rather than their caste, so they have given up pay, pension, life, and everything where they thought it was in danger, and made a vow that every Christian in the country should be murdered, and, not only the white people, but all half-caste and other Christians have been destroyed wherever they could be met with. "All along this river the indigo planters and railway officials have been killed, and their houses burnt and praperty destroyed, Every cantonment looks as if some dreadful earthquake had shaken and destroyed it, for the very walls of the houses have been knocked dowrn. It was a work soon accomplished, for the Sepoys only sacked the treasury and murdered their officers and their families, and the bad characters of the city, which is always near a cantonment, soon completed the work of destruction. All civil government is for the present at an end, and the whole country a blaze of fire, for one village turns out to loot and burn its,smaller neighbour, to be itself served in the same way before the night Is out. " Next year there will be a famine, for all are now afraid to work, and this Is the seed-sowing time; so the sufferings of the population of India will be dreadfuL Every Sepoy that is caught Is immediately hinged."

1806 and 1857. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TEME. Sir,-The accompanying proclamations of the Government of MadrAs in December, 1806, and of Lord Cauing in May, 1857, will complete the parallel-indeed, identity-of the causes of the mutinies in the respective armies of Madras and Bengal, which I pointed out in my letter recently inserted in your columns. Your obedient Eervant. W. EL SYKES. epI. wo. "I PROCLMATION. "The Right Hon. the Governor in Counecil baig ob served that in some late instances an extraordinary degree of egitation has prevaUed among severAl corps of the native army of this coast, it has been his Lordship's particular eadeavour to ascertain the motives which may have led to conduct so different from that which formerly distingxished the native army. From this inquiry it has appeared thxt msny persons of evil intentions have endeavoured, fqr maiious purposes, to impress upon the native troops a belief that it is the wish of the Bntish Govermment to convert them by forcible means to Christianity, mnd his Lord. ship in Co0ucil has observed with corcern that such micioas reports have been believed by many of the native "Ihe Right Hon. the Governor in Council therefore deems it proper, in this public manner, to repeat to the nativeb troops his ssurance that the same respect which has been invariably showvn by the British Government for their religion and for their customs vill be lrways continued, and that no interruption will 4be given to any native, whether EBndoo or MIassulman, in the practice of his religions cere. "His Lordship in Council desires that the native troops wfil not give belief to the idle ramours which are circulated by enemies of their happiness, who endeavour, with tho basest designs, to weaken t4e confidence of the troops in the British Government. His Lordship in Council desires that the native troops wiiU remember the constant attention and humanity which have been shown by the British Govern. ment in providing for their comfort, by augmenting the pay of the native officers and Sepoys, byallowing liberal penmons to those who have done their duty faith£fuay, by making ample provision for the families of those who may have died in battle, and by receiving their children into the servioe of the hon. Comiany, to bJ treated with the same care and bounty as their fathers lad experienced. "hoThe naight Ron. the Governor in Council trusts that the native troops, remembering those circumstances, will be sensible of the happiness of their situation, which is greater than what the troops of any other part of the world enjoy, and that they wiUcontinue to observe the same good conduct for which they were distinguished in the days of General Lawrence, of Sir Eyre Coote, and of otherrenowned heroes. I The native troops must at the samne time be sensiblo that if they should fail in the duties of their allegiance, and should show themselves disobedient to their officers, their conduct wil not fail to receive merited punishment, as the British Government is not less prepared to punish the guilty than to protect and distinguish those who are deserving oE its favour. "It is direded that this paper be translated with care Into the Tamul, Teliga, and Hindostanee languages, andthat copies of it he circulted to each native battalion, of which the European officers are enjoined and ordered to be careful In making it known to every native officer and Sepoy under his command. "It is also directed that copies of the paper be circulated to all the magistrates and collectors under this Government, for the purpose of being fully understood in all parts of the country. "Dated in Fort St. George, December 3, 1806. "Pablished by order of the Ilight Hon. the Governor In Council (Lord W. Bentinck). "G. BUCHAN, Chief Secretary to Government;' "CAST PROCLAMATION. "Fort William, Home Department, May 16, 1857. "The Governor-General of India in Council has warned the army of Bengal that the tales by which the men of certain regiments have been led to suspect that offence to their religion or injury to their caste is meditated by the Government of India are malicious falsehoods. " The Governor-General in Councl has learnt that this suspicion continues to be propagated by designing and evil. minded men. not only in the army, but among other Clasme of the people. I He knowrs that endeavours are made to persuade Eindoos and AInssulmans, soldiers and civil subjects, that their religion is threatened, secretly as well as openly, by the acts of Government, And that the Government is seaking in varios ways to entrap them into a loss of caste for purposes of its own. j " Some have been already deceived and led astray by these tales. "Once more, then, the Governor-General [in Council warns aU classes against the deceptions that are practised on them. " The Government of India has invariably treaWed the religious feelings of sll its subjects with careful respect. The Governor-General in Council has declared that it wi never cease to do so. He now repeats that declaration, and he emphatically proclaims that the Government of India entertains no desire to interfere with their religion or caste, and that nothing has been, or will be done by the Govern. ment to affect the free exercise of the observances of religion or caste by every class of the people. " The Government of India has never deceived its subjeots, therefore the Govethor-General in Council now calls upon them to refuse their belief to seditious lies. "This notice is addressed to those who hitherto, by habitual loyalty and orderly conduct, have shown their at. tachment to the Government and a well.founded faith in its protection and justice. " The Governor.General In Council enjoins all such per. sons to pause before they listen to false guids and traitors, who would lead them into danger and disce "By order of the Governor-General of India in CounciL " CECIL BEADON.

VOLUNTEER RIFLE COBPS. TO THE EDITOR OF TES TDIMES. Sir,-Your remarks upon the formation of 'volunteer corps are most judicious and well-timed. It may ba interesting to you and your numerous correspondents to know the practical working of the system in the only instance in which it has been even partially tried. The South Devon Volunteer Rifle Corps was established in 1852 and, with the exception of the Victoria Rides under the Dake of Wellington in the metropolis, is the only corps which has been sanctioned by the Government and received commissions from the Crown. Under the command of Sir Ecmund Prideaux, a company of the regiment was to be formed in each of the towns in the southern division of this county. The complement for Torquay was promptly raised and offloered by geatlemen resident in the town, the privates and non-commissioned officers being principally young tradesmen, clerks, and some of all classes who wished to support the system, or who enjoyed the sklrmishing and target practice. In a population of about 13,000 a company of 80 most efficient men was raised within a few weeks, and if the system had become general and obtained the encouragement which we had a right 4o expect from the Governmnant a second company for this town would have been as readily formed. A similar proportion throughout the country would give, on any emergency, 200,000 trained marksmen perfect in light infantry dril, who might rally at a moment's notice at their stations, and defy any forein or domestic foe, with comparatively little cost to the country or withdrawal oE its active industry. The principal use of such a force would be as a substitute for the regular arma when required for foreign service, bat it would, equally with the militia, afford the best material for recrmits, and might tend to raise the character of the army by the introduction of a higher class, especially into our cavalry regiments. I was recently informed at the mess of a Dragoon regiment that there are about 20 sons of poor clergymen, and others of superior station, who had enlistea ae privates, and were anmong the most well-conducted, effi. cient soldiers in the oorps. There is no reason why this should not be the rule rather than the exoeptior, and it would afford ample scope for the best energies of Young England, who have so nobly offered their services through your columns. Since steam has bridged over the Channel it is imperative upon us to maintain the same military organization as exists upon the continent. Every young man caoable of bearing arms should have learnt the elements of dim, and if all these should ever be required for foreign servioe, and ad triarios ven tum cs, the trained veterans would alone be able to defend their fatherland against all comers. As au individual instance of the results of this system, my own son, wvho, before going to Oxford, was i private in our corps, subsequently obtained a cadetship at one of the open examinations at Woolwvich, and hsm nowa commission in the Artilery. How far the Torquay Ridfes served to rouse his martial tastes I cannot say, but our driU and rifle practice certinly saved him all the pro. bation of the " awkward Equad," and enabled him to gain a high distinction at the target. Our equipment and uniform cost about 121. 12s, This is borne entirely by the local force, Government give no assistance whatever. A subscription is raised in the town for the current expenses, under the management of a oommittee, amounting to ^bout b01. a-year It this aum were granted by the Government, and prizes offered for the beut target practice, I have no doubt that the system would become uniersal, and the meetings would afford as much sport as archery or any other game, with a most salutary admixture of the uti dui ci. As a county magistrate, I can also testify to the value or our corps in domestic disturbances. Before its formation, during a bread riot we ha4 to send to Exeter for military in aid of the special constables. On a similar occasion, recently, it was quite sufficient to announce that the Rifle. would asseemble at the Town-hall on the night on which disturbance was threatened to swear In some members, and all was perfeotly tranquil. On a trial of skill lst week, when fomr of our men were challenged by the Exeter company, 79 balls hit the target out of 80shots, at 200 yards, on a very unfavourable day-a soore which could nok 1beieve, be exceeded by any regiment in the service. I may add that Sir lHrry Smit, when Commandant in this district; Colonel Rogers, Commander of the Pensioners; Sir John Y. Boier, Colonel of the Sauth Devon Militia, and other officers, have expressed the highest opini n of the appearance and efficiency of oux corps. A MEBEB OF THE COMEIET.

RAILWAY MISMANRAGBE,MRT. TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I beg to corroborate in the most emphatio manner the statemient of your correspondent in your impression of to.('ay as to the disgraceful and hi-hly dangerous state of the Eastern Counties line, especiaYly between Cambridge and Ely. I travelled in that direction about a month since, and was rash enough to trust myself to a corr.er seat in a second-class carriago. On crawling out at my journey's end with bruised anr battered limbs, I felt very much as i I bad been pounded in a mortar, and came to the conclusion that ono good coUision, with claim for compensation for a broken arm, wvould be better than four houre' protracted pounding without any redress at alL While on the subject of railroads. you would entitle yourself to the gratitude of aU travellers if you would draw attention also to the pitiable state into which that greatest of all lines. the Great Western, is-rapidly lapsing. I travelled by it the other day by an express train from Glocester, and in a weak moment committed myself once more to the tender mercies of a second. class carriage. The jolting and osci3lation were almost as bad as on the Eastern Counties line, but were more to be attributed to our excessive speed (far too great for safety) than to the state of the rails. What I have chiefly to complain of is, that the same munificent directors who have lately presented their managing secretary with 5,0001. should resort to the meanest tricks to deter aU respectable persons from travelling second class. The carriage I occupied was as filthy as a dog kennel; the spaces underneath the seats were used as dog boxes. There was not room to put away an umbrella or a hat, much less a carpetbag, and, to add to the discomfort, two or three dirty and half-drunken workmen with tbird-class tickets in their bands were thrust into our over-crowvded compartment. Nor is this all; between Glocester and Swvindon there is a tunnel three miles long. Having to ascend a steep incline, we took slx or sevenr minutes to get through this tunnel, and nearly came to a dead lock in the centre. There was not a glimmer of light iR any of the second class-carriages. The darkness was so great that a little child by my side was terrified in a manner that might have affected its nerves for the remainder of its life. I was told by the guard that the authorities had only within a few days prohibited lights in all the second-class carriages in order to save expense. Surely, Sir, these gentlemen who inlict such terrors upon timid ladies and children for the sake of a few shilliDgs' saving on each iourney can hardly be aware that, as mental sufferings aie often worse than bodily, an injury might arise to the mind of a child through this sort of refined cruelty wbich might expose them to an action for heavy damages. One word more on the subjeot of second-class carriag. It is high time that the eyes of the publio should be opened to the injustice of railway managers in not providing a respectable and comfortable medium between the first and third class. On the continent a second-class carriage is fitted up with some pretension to eomfort. It has at least an apology for a cushion and a place for your hat and 'umbrella, whue the difference in prices between the several classes is equitably adjusted; but in England there is very little, if any, difference between a second and third-class cariage; or, at any rate, you have an amount of discomfort in the former which is wholly out ef proportion to the small differenoe in price between it and the first class. We all know that railway directors have a single eye to dividends; but I would humbly submit that a more just attention to the convenience of the public would be found in the end to be most conducive to the interests of shareholders. I sm, Sir, your obedient servant. ALW.
MONEBY-AfAB T andCIiYINTBLLIOBrCB. Friday Evening. The English funds continue totally stagnant. Consola were again quoted throughout the day at 90 to k for money, and 90k to i for the 14th of October. India Stock left off at 210 to 212; India Bonds, 24s. to I's. discount and Exchequer-bils, 1Os. to Bs. discount. There was a further increase in the demand for money to-day both in the Stock-Exchange and at the Bank of England, but not beyond what was to have been anticipated from the near approach of the end of the quarter and the largeness of the Government balances. A moderate amount of business has been transacted in foreign stocks, and the market shows a downward tendency. Dutch Two.and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 644 and J; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 79 and 7s8; Portuguese, 45 and 441-; Russian Five per Cents., for the account, 109l; ditto Four-and-a-_ H per Cents., 98i; Spanish, 4U0; ditto Passive, 5i ; Turkish Six per Cents., 94i, ;, and 95; ditto Four per Cents. Gnaranteed, 99j; and French Three per Cents., 637. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no alteration of importance. The corn-market this morning was heavy at the decline of Monday. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a limited business, with a tendency to lower rates. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were G(7f. 70c. for money, and 67f. 75c. for the end of the month, showing a further recovery of threeeighths per cent. The trial now taling plaee of Caprpntier, (Irellot, and the other parties implicated in the robbery of the Northern of France Railway, developes circumstanes3 which show that the same system of management has been common to aLU these concerns, whether in London, Paris, or New York. M. Carpentier, although only 26 years of age, was principal cashier of this gigantic company, representing a share capital alone of nearly 7 millions sterling, at the modest salary of 2801. a-year. Grellet, who was nis deputy, is a more mature person of 31, and his income was of course smaller. Their accomplices were Guerin, a night watchman in the offices of the company at 481. per annum, and Parrod, formerly a medlicalstudent and latterly a horsedealer. Their total robberies from the company are stated at 240,0001. The two principals, Carpentier and GreUet, had been promoted for their "attention and inteUigence"-that is to say, for the possession of those qualities of speculative and financial shrewdness, coupled with unscrupulous subserviency, which, in the eyes of directors of public companies, cause men to be regarded as perfect treasures. The idea that there are otherqualitiesnecessary to the proper performance of responsible duties never seems to have occurred to the eminent gentlemen who ruled the destinies of the Northern of France Rauilway. Carpent er and Grelet bad been speculating largely on the ]3ourse for four years, and had been notoriously intimate with Parrod, the horsedealer,whileGuerin, the watchman, had become a thriving notability as a landowner and money lender, by reason, of courae, of having "inherited a large fortune." The private life ilso of Carpentier appears to have been disreputable. But what was all this to the directors? The men were doubtless quick and dashing, overbearing to the inferior drudges of the establishment, and servile to the last degree to their superiors, ready to accept the largest amount of responsibility for the smallest amount of pay, aud .characterized by a capacity for appreciating the greatness of the glants of the Bourse, which at once carried them to favour, the self-esteem of their dupes forbidding the supposition that they might try to join in the game at which they aupeared to look only with humble admiriation. It has been just the same on this side. Robson riding on his five-hundred guinea mare to earn his salary of 1501. a-year at the Crystal Palace,-Redpath working for 3001., while he was maintaining half a dozen establishments and disbursing thousands aunually in magnificent gifts,and Carpentier, with his 2801., reveling with loose associates, and patronized by admiring employers, not one of whom had the instinct to distrust him,each present the same lfgure to the uimnd, so ridioulously transparent are all the features of the several cases in their absolute encouragement to robbery. In the eyes of the chairman and directors of our own Northern Railway what an invaluable creature Guerin, the watchman, would have seemed, with lands, houses, and funds at his command, yet devotedly willing for 481. per annum to spend wakeful nights in guarding the cash office of his employers ! The same illogical tendencles pervade all society, and at the bottom of this fact there are some sad conclusions. The directors of railways and of joint-stock undertakings, generally represent the class of persons whom the business community most prize, and Carpentier, Redpath, and their fellows represent the men who are most popular with directors. A feeble state of public morality, therefore, is at the root of the evil, and it is vain to suppose that there is an approach towards a cure simply because the lower delinquents are prosecuted and sentenced when they are found out. There has been one creditable feature, however, in the present case which has not been witnessed in any of the London ones. Baron James Rothschild seems to have been conscious that the robbery could not have been carried on If he and his brother directors had exercised common vigilance. and he has therefore taken the greater part of the loss on his own slhoulders. Looking at the extreme distaste with which the English Great Northern directors viewed the mild suggestion of Lord Redesdale for a slight contribution, as well as at the fact that the late North of Europe Board are said not even to have carried out the virtual understanding that they should return the fees they had received for ruining their co-proprietors, the example stands brighitly out and deserves to be well recorded. The Australian letters received to-day by the mail steamer Columbian give, on the whole, a satisfactory account of the markets both at Sydnoy and Melbourne. Although they presented little animation they were not encumbered with the heavy stccks hitherto complained of. The escort receipts from the Victoria goldfields for the irst half of the present year had been 4,417,8281. against 5,435,9361. in the corresponding period of 18i6, and the shipments 5,011,9201. against 6,352,2041. The resolution of the Government of Victoria to admit the Mint coinage of New South Wales as a legal tender would, it was thought, cause most of the English sovereigns in circulation to be gradually eent back to this country. On the question of the marine insurance on goods consigned to Australia the Mlelbourne Jour-nat of Commerce has the following remarks:- " The far greater portion of the cargoes of the London ships lately arrived have been extensively damaged, and no doubt the London underwriters will be very averse to vrite particular average on Melbourne insurances, except at very exorbitant rates; but the fault lies not with the merchants here, who, it need scarcely be remarked, however well in. sured, are nearly always in more respects than one losers by sea-damaged goods, and we are sare that they would but too gladly be parties to some system of supervision which would check the overloading of vessels at home, and from 'which cause chiefly the damaged state of the cargoes arises. Particularly of late, since so much railway iron and material is carried, all tho cargoes arrive more or less damaged, as the tremaendous weight put in strains the vessels, and opens - their scams, ,nd allows the water tO come through like a riddle; If the London brokers will not be more careful in filling ships up, parties here will be obliged to give instructions for- idding floe goods to come in any vessel having rail. way plant and timber on board. The latter aricle we may remark is even more objectionablo than iron, for if shipped in wet weather it always steams and damages fine goods through and tbrough, without leaving any traces of salt water on the outside package, and there is alwaya much difficulty in getting laoydds agent to certify properly, and the underwriters take hold of every poesible advanthge, if the certificate is not fully worded, to dispute payment. While on this subjeot, we have to cal the attention of our readers to the instructions sent lately by Lloyd's to their agent, which bind him not to authorize a sale on underwriters' aocount of goods which are damaged by the labels being disfigured, or washed off by salt water; and, as it seems that fresh difficulties are daily started by the London underwriters in settling claims, it would be as welU if some combined actioa ou the part of importers here were to pjni the whole matter on some settled and satisfactory basis' The colonial produce markets during the week have been without improvement, prices occasionally showing some depression where the supplies offered have been large. Since the arrival of the overland mail, however, several of the leading East India stapleshave further advanced, and have now attained a very high value without the speculative feeling being checked. Sugar has been rather active, good to fine grocery meeting a ready sale at last week's rates, while low and soft close 6d. to is. in favour e- huyera, Refinera Llawe taken consi- derable supplies, and shippers are now purchasing more freely. Recent heavy arrivals have led to a further increase in stock, which, however, is still moderate. The Dutch Trading Company's sale of Java, held yesterday, went 5 to 6 guilders under the July quotations. The large quantity of plantation Ceylon coffee submitted has met with a steady demand at a reduction of Is. to 2s., and Costa Rica went irregularly at 2s. to 4s. lower rates. Colonial c;coa, to arrive, has changed hands at several shillings' decline. The aspect of the tea-market is altered, and it has been diffieult to realize any quantities throughout the week, even at slightly lower rates. The public sales on Tuesday and Wednesday passed off heavily, and a further series is announced fcr the 29th inst. Less inquiry has prevailed for rice, either on the spot or afloat. A large quantity of spice brought forward to-day was sold without any material variation in prices. The market for saltpetre has been veryactive, the latest transactions establishing a rise of 6s. to 7s. To-day fine Bengal brought 63s. to 63s. 6d., and at the close there were buyers at those rates. Indigo has again advanced, good to fine Bengal being difficult to obtain even at ls. 6d. per lb. above the rates of the July sales. The Court of Bankruptcy was occupied to-dav in hearing a petition presented on behalf of a contributory of the hondon and West of Ireland Fishing and Fish Manure Company for a winding-up order by that Court. The company, it appeared, had passed a resolution iu favour of a voluntary winding-up, but the shareholder contended that three-fourths of the capital (40,0001.) having been lost since its formation in September last there were circumstances in the case that called for the interposition of the Court of Bankruptcy. An adjournment was ultimately ordered, that the petitioner might amend and enlarge his petition. The returnfrom the Bank of England for the week ending the 19th of 3eptt:bor givc, tho follorIng results when compared with the previous week:- Publio Deposits ... £8,045,099 ...

RAILWAY AND MIN,[fG SBARBS. .O Friday Evening. In the railway-market the chief feature is the continued demand[ for Great Northern, which has again improved, the A stock especiaUy closing about 41. higher. These purchases are made principally in anticipation of the arrears of dividends wbich will have to be paid at the close of the present litigation with the preference shareholders. The trafflic returns of this railway show an increase in the receipts for the conveyance of passengers and goods, and a falling off in the coal, North-Eastern (Barwick) and Great Southern and Western (Ireland) also advanced; London and North-Western, SouthWestern, Midland, and South-Eastern receded. There was a partial recovery in Grand Trunk of Canada bonds; Great Western of Canada were, however, rather weaker. In French shares, Eastern of France, Great Central, and Lyons and Geneva slightly improved. In mines, the transactions were chiefly confined to Alfred Consols, which closed firm at the late advance. In joint-stock banks there was no alteration. In miscellaneous securities, a fractional reduction took place in Mexican and South American Land and Peel River ; on the other hand, a small improvement occurred in National Discount. The last quotation of Electric Telegraph shows a decline of It. ORDWnARY SHARES AI) sroTnAM

LONDON, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1J7. After you have settled what to do, the next 1hing is to adapt the means to the end. This is san aflair of common sense, and is one very open to error. Your means may be deficient or excessive; you nmay kit waiting for the end without the means, or may make so much of the means as to forget the end; or, having the means, you may so use them as to miss the end. To say that these nii0takcs have prevailed more in military affairs than in any other would be an unfair depreciation of many prodigious albsurdities. Indeed, erroneous syBtcms of offence and defence entail such serious penalties, and elicit such stern conviction, that peace may justly claim the palm of extravagant an(d unconviniced folly. It is to peace that we must look for costly institutions serviceab!e cnly to their officers, to edifices seldomi entered by man, to libraries doomed to a life of dust and an end of fire, to magnificent bridges sacred from traffic, to towers never ascended, to parks and gardens the cost of which condemns their ownera to exile, to mansions exceeding the measure of your hoespitality, to equipages which cumber you, to servants who render you helpless, to wvardrobes that moulder,-to a thousand sub3titutions of the means for the end. It is not the reputed fool who is the worst instance. The old English housewife is quite as bad. NWith her parlour too smart for use, her carpets covered and her floors wet and soapy, her dresses too good to be worn, and herself too busy to smile, she loses the end of life in its miserable furniture. But, allowing the priority to peace, war, or what pretends to be war, runs it rather close. Perhaps we should not much exceed the umark if we were to say that most military arrangements, if not made absolutely on the supposition of peace, are, at all even!s, greatly modifed by theconfident expectation of it. 'We were on the point of saying that England, as a commercial and an insular nation, was especially addicted to this class of mistakes, but other nations are as bad. For example, we should doubt whether the very astute gentlemen who do these things for the Emperor of RussIA ever fairly carried out the supposition of Sebastopol being actually besieged by sea and land, and of their having consequently to sink- all their ships and march their armies 1,000 miles and more to its relief. But England is Our affair, and India is the scene on which at present she is tried and found wanting. Now, whatever the final purpose of our holding India, it is necessary thereto that we should hold it, and that is the end to be considered in our military arrangements. Of course that necesaity appears to be admitted in the fact of an army of more than 300,000natives, 40,000 Europeans, immense stations, arsenals, and fortresses of all rates and descriptions. Preparations of this sort must be for var, and not for peace; and yet it has been an almost everyday remark in the mouths of observant and sensible Englishmen for we dare not say how long, that if war should actually break out in India, we were liable to find the whole fabric of our power vanish in a day. For all this century, whether in jest or in earnest, the vision of one ship bringing home what is left of British India has been familiar to the English mind. We may say that it has been evident to the understanding of all that our plans bave not been made for the contingency of a general rising. All that transpired of public administration and private life in India showed that this was the last thing provided for. It was notorious, for example, that the best men were selected for civil employments, and the rest left withtheir regiments, till the clever man of thirty was commissioner, collector, or magistrate, or in some special service ; and important stations were left to incompetent and worn-out men of sixty or seventy. It was notorious that, in quest of health, comfort, and enjoyment, the troops, especially the European, were taken to cantonments, further and further from the chief cities and strong places. It was known, and often deplored, that Bengal was denuded of troops for the protection of our frontier provinces, not to say the prosecution of our designs in those quarters. It was l;nown that habits of luxury and indolence were cherished very incompatible with our oldfashioned notions of war. That every now and then the Indian Government took strong measures of a sort to try the temper of the natives, in annexing States, disregarding native laws, and prohibiting native usages, was known, and not disapproved ; but it was also felt that we were putting our supremacy and reputation to a very great strain. We may appeal to the general society of England whether it has not been a common remark in the mouths both of civilians and military men that we were running very great risk by our free and easy pretence of military occupation in India. Of course everywhere there were old Indians who pooh-poohed all idea of more being necessary. On the strength of having served in a campaign against HoLKA, or survived the first Burmese war, they claimed a right to know better than anybody here how two hundred millions of peoplemany of them born and bred warriors, with innumerable elements of disaffection-were to be kept in permanent subjection. Of course they knew a good deal. They knew what contributed to the health of the British troops, to the comfort of the officers, and to the convenience of British society. They were up to aU the dangers and annoyances incident to a closer contact with the native soldiery or the fanatical and ignorant population. But India was not to be judged by the example of other countries; nor was our occupation, in strict sense, military. When the news came of our expulsion from the city of Cabul, it came out that our arsenal and commissariat stores had been located simply with a view to comfort and present convenience, and so as to be utterly indefensible and useless in the event of war. This obvious and disastrous blunder was then mildly described to be treating Affghanistan as if it ware Eindostan, and it was asmu-ned that in the latter case there was no danger - 1-t in scattering our cantonments, our arsenals, and our stores-in a word, making all our arrangements so as not to onmmand th.' nitiar ci ha c-.hbmry possession of the country. It was admitted that a great error had certainly been committed in placin)g a newly acquired dependency, with so fierce a population and so far from our resoureds, in the hands of a gouty old gentleman many years out of actual service. It was implied that there was no such danger in leaving gouty old gentlemen in command of important positions throughout the old provinces and dependencies of India. In fact, our rulers were forgetting that we held the country by military occupation, that this was the end to be considered, and that the composition, the arrangements, and discipline of our army must be directed to that object. This forgetfulness has led to its natural result. The event of a general rising throughout at least the most important Presidency has come to pass, and it has been found at oncein one hour, it may be said-that the British Government of India has dlirected all those immense and costly preparations for the sake of which it stopped so many improvements to the contingency not of war, but of peace-that is, to the contiDgency in which they would not be wanted at all. The letters of " IlmoPinIus'" in our columns of yesterday and the day before will command the attention of practical men, because they are addressed to the object of makfing the Indian army, and every branch of it, answer its real purpose. Tlle writcr assumes that our Indian policy must be resolute, stringent, and in a certain sense aggressive ; that we must assert the right of government over every race, every State, every element whatever that opposes itself to government, and so bccomes a common enemy. Such a position requires the strongest military defences, and obliges us to act in many respects as if in an enemy's country. It would not be fair to the writer if we did not mention that lie evidently thinks we have in some instanices-not that of Oude-stretched a point with, the native States, and reaped the consequences. But, on th e whole, he approves our policy; only, as it is one which sets at naught many prejudices and tralitions, he says, we must be prepared for opposition. To take some of the many points touched upon in his letters, he is for the military ocoupation of Delhi, which he maintains to be generally healthy, and which, after clearing the palace of its present occupants, will no longer be musuitable for the residence of European troops. He is for contracting our cantonments within reasonable limits, providing compact and fireproof residences for our military officers, and building at every station a proper p)lace cl'a rnu, defensible by a few British soldiers. for the protection of the arms, treasure, and records, and commanding the railway stations. HIe proposes to employ the native soldiery chiefly as police, for escorts, patrols, ancd guards over gaols, with European officers, combined with a " de- " tective element," and under such a general superintendence and inspection as shall diffuse information, and make every part share the improvement of the rest. He is for such a selection of native soldiers and such terms of admission to the service as shall altogether neutralize the influence of caste, family, or place. The Europeau and other regular troops he would thus leave as an army of reserve. As for the mutineers, when the war is over and peace is restored be would send them down the Ganges in strings, the Brahmin yokefellow with the vilest sweeper, over the " black water" to our West Indian Islauds. Reward, he maintains, ought to keep pace with punishment; the faithful Rajah should be recompensed with accession of territory, and a medal of fidelity distributed to all who have stood by us. He urges the completion of our railways, if only to make a small army, as ours must always be, do the work of a large one; and he poixts out how mpch we should have gained had we been able to throw even our reduced forces upon any point we pleased at a few days' notice. His general suggestions for the improvement of the army-the selection, education, and promotion of the officers-belong rather to the controversy in progress at home, in respect not only to the Indian army, but to the whole of our service. They are, however, of a very practical character, and their value receives no small light from these lamentable events. We only do our duty in recommending them to the careful consideration of our readers.
It appears that in accordance with the regulations the recruiting sergeant is everywhere rejectiig men who do not come up to the siandard height of 5 feet 5 inches. Now, although we do not wish to fill the Army with men of smaU stature and weak frames when better material is to be had, yet the present is, we think, a time when excessive scrupulosity may be laid aside. Troops must be had at once, and in sufficient numbers. Many small but atrongly built lads are ready to join theArmy if their services can be accepted. In ordinary times it is certainly unadvisable to lower the standard. Recruiting then goes on slowly and regularly, and the fair average stature of our population, coupled with the comparative smallness of the Army, enables us to exercise a choice in the matter. But the present is an exceptional occasion. For several years there has been a great drain on the young male population. More than 2,000,000 emigrants have left the shores of thesoe islauds for orzoa and Anirli fI:ho la,o war with Russia took away a large number of the martially disposed, and has somewhat exhausted the recruit market for the present. Add to this that all branches of trade have been unprecedentedly'e'xtended of late, that the exports for 1857 will amount to over 130,000,0001., and consequently the plough, the forge, the loom, and the merchant ship have demanded far more than their former number of strong and stalwart men, and it will bo easily imagined that a sudden caU for a large addition to the regular Army cannot be met unless the ordinary standard be lowered for a time. But, happily, the warfare in which we are engaged does not require the services of large and very strong-bodied men. The Sepoys are, after all, not enemies whom any class of our population might fear to meet, and, even acknowledging the superior efficiency 'of large men in hand-to-hand combat, it may be doubted whether smaller sized soldiers are not as well suited for campaigns in such a country as India, where the moat formidable enemies are distance, heat, and disease. It has been proved by French military history that men of the sizo which is now declared insufficient by the sergeants are particularly well adapted for all the toils and privations of war. NAroLEox won battles with the legs of his soldiers, and we have seen in the present day that the French levies, thoughi composed of men much below the average stature of Englishmen, have been distinguished by extraordinary endurance. It is certainly the duty of the authorities to reject all weak and sickly men, but, as there is a class of small but well-buils and wiry Englishmen as well as a class o a more gigantic type, we cannot see w. services of the former should be absolut clined. There is no reason to believe th !I smaller men would be less ablA . *r the marcn from Calcutta to Delhi, or ; rve through tihe heats of one season or the rains of another; and iu actual conffict they could wield a rifle with as much ease, and probably as much skil, as a heavily-made man. In'the Navy men of small size have won our greatest battles, and we see no reason why recruits of a similar make should not do their duty well in the field. At least, when men of any kind run short, it certainly is bad policy to repress the enthusiasm of any village TYDETYS. We seem, indeed, to be running into the other extreme of employing men too heavy for such a service in such a field. Infantry soldiers may, indeed, be tall without ary danger but that of being too weighty for their own strength on a march but with cavalry the case is different. INow we are sending out our giants, men of 5 feet 10 and 6 feet high, who must be mounted on small native horses totally unfit to carry them and their heavy equipment. The stalwart Dragoons who are suited to meet the charge of European opponents will be sadly unsuited to follow up Mahrattas, whose war. fare consists in eluding the shock of an enemy. But as this is the only cavalry we have, it must perforce be sent, and we hope that the rebels will have the courage to meet our heavies, and so allow them a chance of exhibiting their prowess. As yet, however, we seem to have suifered severely from the want of light cavalry in the disturbed districts. Regiment after regiment kas mutinied, murdered its officers, and, after committing unheard-of atrocities, has marched away to Delhi, without its being in our power tQ foDlow them effectually. For the same reason our victories have been unimproved. The whole Indiau cavalry being lost, it has been impossible to cut up the routed rebels after they have been driveui from the field by the charge of our little band of infantry. Now, for such a service as this it is evident that small men mounted on such horses as can be obtained in the country must be particularly effective. By all means send out the regiments which actually exist, but if others are to be embodied the authorities ought, so far from rejecting light and small-made men, to give them the preference, for it is certain that in nine-tenths of the work to be performed they would be far more active and useful than troops of large-boned giantc, who would kill their horses and be reduced to inefficiency in the course of a fortnight. For reconnaissances, for foraging, for, pursuing straggling bands of the enemy, men under the present cavalry standard would bb more useful than the regiments to which we are accustomed, and, as they have to meet neither French, nor Russian, nor Austrian antagonists, their want of weight would be no disqualification. Above all it should be remembered that speedy reinforcements are absolutely necessary, and that the time spent in forming corps of picked men adds much to the chance of disaster and the difficulty of recovery. Why, then, not take any stroDg and active young man who offers himself, even though his stature may fall short of the established standard ? The present enlistment is for special service on a great emergency. The enemy is not in himself formidable, but from the distance and extent of the field of action great difficulties lie before us. It is not important that we should have perfect parade troops, but it is important that we should have good active soldiers speedily in the midst of the enemy. Any regulation which prevents the ranks from being filled must, therefore, at the present crisis be most uTnwise.
At the commencement of the present year we took occasion to express our dissent from rertain views then in circulation as to the generad debasement of public morality in these utime%. The views themselves were not altogether unnatural. The recurrence of crimes startling from their atrocity, and the discovery of faud after fraud on a scale of unparalleled magnitude, suggested apprehensions that our boasted progress was illusory, and that even the education on which we relied for popular improvement might, by increasing the capacity of crimninals} have a tenidency to expand the dimensions of crime. We pointed out, however, at the moment the fallacies of the deductions thus derived, and our estimate of the case has now received a signal confirmation in the statistics of criminal justice recently published. Certainly, we have seen of late some prodigious specimens of guilt, and it cannot be denied that Assize calendars have been heavy, heinous offences notable, and capital sentences numerous, but the tables before us are entirely conclusive as to the absence of any such moral deterioration sz was conceived to be going on. As a summary expression of the facts, we might state that the total commitments for trial in 1856 were fewer by 25 per cent. than those in 1855, notwithstanding the latter year had itself shown a decrease of 11 per cent. as compared with 1854. It requires, hovwever, to be observed, that this diminution of figures may be explained, in some degree, by the increased scope now given to summary jurisdiction, so that many an offence formerly catalogued in the regular commitments would now find no place in the list. Making all allowance, however, for this circumstance, it must be plain that crime cannot possibly have been on the increase, and the conclusion possesses a particular value, as showing how largely impressions created by any temporary panic may admit of correction from broad calculations and authentic figures. It may, for instance, surprise people who remember the frequency of garotting outrages to learn that offences against the Pon were, upon the -whole, not more numerous in 1856 tlhan in 1855, and that in tile particular' crimes of stabbing and wounding there was actually a large decrease; though we are not without an opinion that the rapid decay of the newfangled atrocity, at one minute so prevalent, was 'due in a considerable degree to the resentment of the public and the salutary rigours of the law. The analysis of these statistics fails altogether to inspire us with a belief that any species of dishonesty can be more rampant than in former times. Many flagrant cases of misdoing have doubtlesscome before the public, but the inexorable evidence of figures assures us that, so far as the yearl856is concerned, a decrease of no less than 33 per cent. occurred in " offences against property without vio" lence." That larceny and embezzlement, instead of increasing, did positively diminish, is here placed on unimpeachable record; though there was a tendency for the worse in the case of " frauds." A diminution, again, though not a marked one, is discovered in forgeries and offences against the currency, althor.gh the number of coiners convicted happens to be unusually great. The evidence applicable to the education question is equally decided. Out of 100 criminals 5 or 6 only are found who can read well; of the remainder between 50 and 60 have but an imperfect knowledge of their letters, and between 30 and 40 are destitute of any information whatever. Of the cases distinguished in police nomenclature as those c: 'superior instruction" the proportion is still so minute as to be represented in decimal notation by 0'3. We ha,-e no wish to dissemble the fact that these r3cords -ay be consistent, notwithstanding their general clharacter, with a certain aggravation of r-c:e. Although, for example, offences against rroperty may have been stationary, or even diminished in number, during any particular year, yet, if they comprised half a dozen such cases as PAuLds or REDPATn's the result might be reasonably thought more alarming than usual. Similarly, though PAX.rER might figure only as a single murderer in a statistical table, noitody would deny that the atrocities for which hoe ufforoa p-ok of i' tvrxible diitiuutivn. Altogether, in short, it may be argued that, whatever may be the result of the calculations before us, greater crimes have lately been comniitted by men of better education than in days past. W'e have Seen a series of frauds of prodigious dimensions executed by persons who, if education imparted any guarantee, ought to have been saved from such temptations. ln future times, perhaps, the historians of England may discover evidence against our own age in the very laws which have been devised for its protection, and the security sought in new statutes against fraudulent breaches of trust may be conceived to indicate the growth or culmination of the misdeeds referred to. The plausibility of the arguments here implied we fully admit, but we adhere nevertheless to our opinion that, in reality, as regards any general or essential debasement of public morals, there is no case to be established against the present age. The magnitude of crimes is but an incident of the magnitude of transactions. There were no REDPATHS in the last century, because there were no Great Northerns; just as there were no great gold robberies because there was no great amount of gold. A thief steals according to his opportunities of theft-a crownpiece in one case, a ton of bullion in another. Joint-stock companies have created new facilities for tampering with private funds, and it is against these new opportunities, and not against any new wickedness in the human breast, that security has been sought in new laws. If there were any pirates in the present day piracy would assume twenty times the dimensions of the old-fashioned crime, not because bucaniers would be more desperate, but because booty would more abound. If robbers of this species should ever reappear, a new Captain KInD might capture a Great Eastern, and carry off a prey as great as an old Persian or Assyrian conqueror. As to education,-that it can ever communicate criminality to a disposition otherwise innocent is an absurdity too great for conception. Even the notion that it may instill desires to be satisfied only by crime is without any real value. Eu;GENE ARAM, it has been said, or imagined, being a needy scholar, killed a man for the sake of knowledge; but if he had been an unlettered murderer he would probably have killed a gamekeeper for the sake of a hare. AU vicious and uncontrollable minds have propensities which lead to crime, nor does it much signify what directions such propensities take. Education may possibly elevate the ideas of an irreclaimable felon to kid gloves and a dogeart, instead of leaving them to grovel in sheepstealing and beer, but the difference does'not tell much against the schoolmaster. And there is this plain advantage on the side of teaching,-that if a boy imbibes desires above his station he acquires also, at the same moment, the means of honestly gratifying them. The old proverb gave learning its true character in saying, not that it led to robbery, but that it was better than house or land. No doubt, there have been some terrible crimes in the last two year; in fact, the report shows that capital sentences and executions have increased in number, though the former result is partly ascribable, perhaps, to the disuse of transportation. But in every age there are periods of this character, just as in every age there were great criminals. What renders the case more striking now is not the extraordinary flagrancy but the extraordinary publicity by which crimes are attended. The moral condition of the age resembles its sanitaiy condition. We rbad with horror of the celars and lodging-houses in which human creatures are cranmed, and doubt -whether Ay ago was like our own. The truth il not that such misery did 'not exist in past times but that it was unheeded. We now-a-days drag our own-failings unshrinkingly to light-crimes and filth:together, and if the conviction of error is the first step to truth our own disparagement of ourselves, although unfounded, may prove one of the surest roads to improvement.
THE IMPERIAL MEETING. (BY SUBMA AND BRTSH TELEGRAPH.) We have received the following teleg,ram from Stnttgardt "' STUrTGARDT, FRmtY EvmENNG, SEPT. 25. "The Emperor Napoleon arrived here this afternoon, at half-past 4 o'clock. " The King of Wurtemberg received him at the railway station and sonducted him to the Palace, where they were immediately joined by the Emperor of Russia. " Contrary to all expectations, the Empress of Russia will join the party to-morrow."
IRELAND. I (FROM OUR OWN CORREeoNDIOT.) DUBLIN, FRTMAY MORNI G. STATE OF flELFAST. It appears that a meeting of the magistrates of the town and neighbourhood of Belfast is to take place this day, at the instance of the Marquiis of Donegal, to consult upon the best means of preserving the peace of the town under the existing state of excitement. Referring to this step, the Banner of Ulster says,- " We have reason to believe that some resolution will be come to in reference to open-air preaching, and especially to the proceedings which took place on Inst Sabbath, in consequence of the telegraphic message sent to our worthy ayor by his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant. We believe if anotber su.h message be sent his Excelluency will find such difficulties in the way of its execution as shall make him pause before hesends another. Wecan inform his Excellency that obedience to his order on last Sabbath was notthe most agreeable duty the magistrates have perfo2med in Belfast, nor one which they would like renewed again.y Meanwhile the head and front of the excitement, the Rev. Hugh Hanna, the would-be modem John Knox, has addressed the subjoined manifesto to the Mayor and magistrates of Belfast:- " Gentlemen,-I know that by this time you are keenly aware that on the past Sabbath you exceeded your commission, and made grave infraction on the constitutional rights of a large body of the most orderly and respectable citizens of Belfast. I dispute your authority to remove any assembly of peaceablo citizens from the private unenclosed ground whereon upon the past Sabbath I first encountered you. I dispute the power of the Lord-Lieutenant to invest you with such authority. But, whatever may be the law on this point, any competent lawyer will Inform you that you had no right to enter on and expel us from the enclosed yard, the ultimabt position I occupied with my open-adr congregation. In a rude, and almost a barbarous way, you dispersed an unoffending people, dealing more rigorously with them than you everdid with any riotous mob that damaged and disgraced thetown. One of the men underyoar command cocked his carbine and levelled It at my breast, and many have to complain of the outrageous conduct of the police underyourcommand. What course the hundreds whom you dispersed-each of whom has ground of action against you-may adopt, I cannot tell; but, for my own part, I now respectfully demand from you an acLnowledgment of your error and an apology for your conduct. I am one of those who look with extreme jealousy on every stretch of executive power, and I will strenuously resist in a constitutional way its every infraction on constitutional right and privilege. Your compliance with this demand will vindicate the liberty of the subject and avoid the necessity of litigation. "Yours respectfully, "RHUGH HASNxN." Referring to the snail's-pace progress of the Government investigation the following observations of the Belfast Alerciury are but the echo of public feeling, at least as far as persons at a distance from the scene of action can be supposed competent to form an opinion " It is really full time that the commissioners should interfere to stay the interminable flow of irrelevant evidence which is fast tending to bring the whole inquiry into disrepute. What object is to be gained by heaping evidence upon the top of evidence, the whole purport of which is merely to prove that rioting took place? It is not, as we understand it, the duty of the commissioners to reoort on the point whether a greater amount of vagabondismnexists in S ody-row than in Pound-streettheir object is not to discriminate the minute shade3 of criminality that may exist between the desperate factions that are a disgrace to our town-on the contrary, the plain purpose of their inquiry, according to their commission, is to investigate into the origin of t-ho riots, and to report on the same, with such suggestions as they may consider calculated to guard against their repetition. There can be no doubt that the stato of the labolLring population in Belfast Is one favourabla to such riots; but we opine it does not form any part of the duty of the commissioners to examine into the sanitary condition, considered moraUy and religiously, of that population. We therefore discard the subject from presont consideratlon, and desire to give a practical aim to the inquiry. At present the commissioners, amid tho vast mass of wholly irrelevant evidenco, have done nothing more than ascertain the cause of the July rioting. They have not advanced much beyond this point. They have consumed nine days, for the most part in listening to very ridicalous and inconclusive evidence, and this, too, while such a protracted inquiry is calculated seriously to injure the trade and prosperity of our tovn. It appears that up to the present the inquiry has been without practlcal aim, while it has not been conducted according to any system, legal or otherwise. It -s alto,ether a 'hodge-podge' affair; and the result will be a ponderous blue-book of evidence, from which the public in general wiU turn in dis-ust-it will never be read. Our deslre is, and we are certain it is shared by the influence and intelligenco of the town, that the commissioners should ascertain as fully as possible the causes of tte rioting, and then take evidence as to the most effectual means by which a recurrence of such semi-barbarous conduct should be in fature guarded against." "'EPOY ATROCITIES. The Evening Post quotes from the CArloi. Sen i- nel the following paragraphi respecting the fate of a lady for mrny years well known to the citizens of Dublin. Indeed, it may be asked, who has visited the Irish capital at any period during the last 25 years or more that has not heard of the beautiful, but somewlhat eccentric Mrs. Farquharson, the wife of Colonel Farquharson, late of the 7th Fusileers:- " Many of our readers will recollect Mrs. Farquharson, tho wife of Colonel Farquharson, of the 7th Fusileers, during her residence in Dablin some few years since, as the spirited driver of a phaeton drawn by a pair of beauti(ul piebald ponies. HIer husband commanded another regiment on bis return from China. She joined him in India with her children, and by letters lately received in England it appears that during the late rebellion the Sepoys-the highcaste pet soldiers of the East India Company-burnt her alive, with her family, after committing the most frightful and revolting atrocities on her person." The Post adds that a private letter has been received in Dublin, giving another version of the fate of the hapless lady, which was still more horrible than that above mentioned. The statement is that after suffering a series of indescribable barbarities, she was placed alive between two boards, and cut through with a saw ! Touching the tender sympathy manifested by certain Irish journals towards the perpetrators of such atrocitiesas tbe foregoing, the Bamer of Ulster, the organ of the Presbyterian body, justly remarks "It is truly a lamentable thought that, while the blood of the Irish Romanist, of the Episcopalian and Presbyterian, mingle together in one red s ream before the walls of the besicged city in India, there should be found nt homo even a single voice to wish 'success to the Sepoys.' It requires no great stretch of valour to sit In the editorial forum and indite incentives to sympathy with the swarthy fiends who mutilated the children and dishonoured the wiives of our gallant countrymen in the East. Onehalfhour's experience, however, of the tender mercies of the mutineers at Caw,upore would teach the ' Sepoys' of the Irish press a lesson which, we feel pretty certain, those outlaws of the fourth estate wrould recollect with terror for the remainder of their existence."

SECOND EDITION* THE TIMgs.OFFIC, Satwrday Morning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Friday), 6 p.m.:- The effect of the announcement of the approaching meeting between the Emperors of Russia and Austria is to confirm the belief already entertained by those who view the matter dispassionately, that the interview at Stuttgardt is an interview of peacs -of peace, that is to say, hot only between Napoleon and Alexander, between Russia and France, but for Earope in general. This Is the evident and not unnatural impression, and it only agrees with that already taken by most sensible and unprejudiced persons before it was known that the interview at Stuttgardt was so soon to be followed up by one at Weimar. Then, however, the apparent latent hostility between Austria and France, and Austria and Russia, gave somewhat of a colourmng of probability to the suggestions of certain parties who would gladly have seen a formidable combination against the future welfare of the Empire of Francis Joseph. Of those parties the Weimar meeting disturbs the combinations and weakens the hopes. There can be no doubt that it is to be looked upon as a friendly r approchement-as a return to amicable relations, for some time past troubled and overclouded. The conciliatory overture may be considered to come from Vienna, since General de Parrot was sent to break the lcea by complimenting the Emperor of Russia on his passage through Darmstadb; but Alexander appears to have met the' proffered hand half way-to have received the General, whom he had formerly known in Russia, with particular graciousness, and, if we are rightly informed, to have been the first to express a wish for the meeting to which the Generars mission was doubtless intended to lead. It wil not be surprising if the effects of the two interviews now imminent should not be confined to the Sovereigns who actuaUy meet, but should powerfuUy teud to restore a general feeling of cordiality among all the important members of the European family. There Is no valid reason for any estrangement between England and Russia, and we know that efforts are alreadymaking to dissipate whatever ill feelingexists between Austria and France. Our friends' friends should be our friends, aud of this the three Emperors will have excellent opportunities of reminding each other at Stuttgardt and at W eimar. The Sptctateu-r has an article suggested by the latest accountsj received here from the island of Mauritius, which are up to the 20th August. The news of the Indian insurrection had caused great excitement in the island, and some of the letters express serious uneasiness as to the disposition of the large body of Hindoos employed on the sugar plantations. The 33d Regiment, which garrisoned the island when intelligence of the Bengal mutiny arrived, was embarked immediately, and its departure was followed by a certain agitation among the Coolies. According to the Specfteur, proclamations were seized, and some priests were arrested for preaching massacre and pillage. A strong feeling of alarm was growing up, when it was reheved by the arrival of the 4th Regiment from the Cape. But this corps, we are told, has just been summoned in its turn to India, and the situation of the 20,000 Europeans, chiefly French or of French extraction, who are thus left with only two companies to protect them, among 200,000 Hindoos and emancipated negroes, excites the very serious apprehensions of the kSpectateur, which considers the peril immense, and perhaps imminent, and suggests, as an effectual precaution against it, a French garrison at Port Louis as long as the war in India lasts. The pctateur foresees no objection to this plan that might not easily be refuted, but abstains from insisting on it, merely reminding England that if, from the neglect of a precaution easily taken, disasters occurred to the European population of the Mauritius similar to those lately witnessed in India, there are thousands of French families who would never forget it. It is presumaable that the British Government is not unmindful of the safe'y of the AMauritius, and that the fears of the Spertateur will prove unfounded. Whoever has been in the habit of reading the French papers since the outbreak of the Indian revolt must have been struck by the extraordinarily conflicting statements and appreciations they contain. If these amounted only to dlifferences of opinion as to the probable result of the struggle, there would be no cause for wonder, but they also display strange inattention to facts and to accuracy of detail. Thus, for instance, with respect to the number of European troops 'we shall have to oppose to the mutineers when aU the reinforcements now on their way shal have arrived, we find it variously estimated at from 30,000 to S0,000 while one paper said that the reiuforcements sent would but fill the gaps created before they reach India. Common attention to statistics easily obtained, and to the exact statements supplied by the English papers of the numberFof men embarked, -would prevent such strange discrepancies as these. 'With regard to the causes of the insusrection appreciations equally rash have been hazarded, and the small number of journais habitually hostile to England have daily shuddered over the newly-discovered misgovernment which has driven the Indians to revolt. With such unfair and unfounded attacks a, ihese latter it is agreeable to contrast tho juster estimate of British ruile in India contained in an article in to-day's SiUdc, entitled " England and the Police of the Seas":- *" One must do England the justice to say that she wA, she f=rsb to renounce conquest in Europe. She transportel her ambition elsewhere, and has hadthe inummnse glory ta give birth to one or the greatest nations in the world-to the people free par fxcriencce-to the American nation. Her conquests have al most all been conqnests of commerce and of Civilization. Russa, Austria, Prussia, have aggrandizei themselves at tho expense of free European population, whose nationaUty they have kiled, and whose development they have stopped. The English have not committed this crime. In this respect they are like France, *nd have no restitution to make. They pursued their unity, and. like us, they stopped Avhen that unity was complete. They have sought the elements of their expansion beyond the limits of their European brethren. TheT have peoplod the solitudes bf America, and c1Ued into life the new world of Oceania. If, become masters of India by the hazard of events, they have not asAijilatkd it to themselves, allovvance must be mado for the time and for the immensity of the difficulty. But what great things they have there done ! How Imany barbirous customs aboUshed I how many towns rendered healthy, roads constracted, and rivers brldgdd! Properly to appreciate English domination in India-one must know what In,dh was before -Oat domination, one must remember the unieard-of trugles of sects and religions, aed the inundations of blood ot which it was the periodical prey.

The mascres that now xevolt Europe, from whatever side they proceed, would have been mere feslivals previously to the British rule.'

T2HE KINGDOM OF THE TWO SICILIES. (FROM OUR OWN CORESSPOHDFNT.) .aAi'LQ5~, SEPT. 17. The Cagliari case is not decided. A portion of the Vienna prees declares that it is so, and Gazagnni assexts that the trial of the prisonera was to have come on on the 7th inst. NTothing of the kind-not even the day has been named, though it is imagined that it may be brought forward at the end of this month or the beginning of October, and every ineident connected with the case displays the same dogged discourtesy which has marked the conduct of this Government from the beginning. A recent letter contained a brie; history of the correspondence between the Sardinian and Neapolitan Governmants on the subject of the Cagliari, its crew, and passengers, and stated that on leaving Naples the passengers had not received their baggage. I understand, however, that a few days since, when those unfortunate persons had left Naples and had dispersed to all directions of tha compass, a note was sent by Signor Carafa, the Miniister of Foreign Affairs, to Count Gropello, announcing that the property might be had on application to Signor Pignatelli, the Procureur-General of the Grand Criminal Court of Salerno. The finale is worthy the entire treatment which these persons received in this country, and not one wiU care, I should imagine, to revisit this " bit of * Heaven fallen upon earth," as the proverb has it. EqualUy open to auiimadversQin i3 the snanner in which two British Subjects, tha engineers of the Cagliari, now in prison, have been treated. It is understood, as I have already informed you, that the British Acting Consul, Mr. Barbar, received ia- atructions from home to use all the means at his _ -4lponUr"ine the irksomeness of the position of these persons, and it is only just to lfr. Barbar to say that before the receipt of those instructions he had done all that under the circumstances it was possible to do. On their arriving in Naples he w.nt to the prison and demanded permission to see them, but was refused. ff is next step was to write to Signor Bianchini, the Director of Police, from whom he received a similar answer. A note was then written to Signor Carafa, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who replied as his colleaguehad done before him. In conformity with his instructions, which are to give the .prisoners all the assistance in his power, Mr. Barbnr wrote last week a note, and sent it by his messenger to De Spagnolis-a name too well known here,-the Commissary of the Vicaria. The note requested to know how the prisoners were, and whether they were in want of anything. At the same time the value of two napoleons in money was sent. No communication was allowed with our countrymen, nor was any written answer brought from them, but an inspector of pcl.ce came out and reported lb at one of the prisoners had been ill and had been bled, but that both were well now,-farther, that they were not in want of anything, and as a proof the two napoleons were returned. All the information therefore that we have of two British subjects confined in the prisona of Vicaria is such as is derived from a N.eapolitan police inspector. No one has seen them; one has3 been ill, but he has not had the satisfaction of seeing even his Consul; and a sum of money, which might have been useful in purchasing a few comforts, has been rejected. Such conduct may be consistent with international law and courtesy, but it does not appear to me to be so, and if it is not so it ought to caU down a decided expression of resentment on the part of the British Government. I doubt much whether American citizens would have been treated in a similar manner, but had they been so I am very sure as to what would have been the consequences. I have often alluded to the false reports which are published by this Government as to the tranquillity and prosperity of this country. I gave you an instance of its tranquillity the other day, when speaking of the capture of Signor Consiglio by banditti, neai the second city in the kingdom, and not far from a railway connecting it with the capital. It was the uncle of our Vice Consul who was seized, and the note sent by the banditti was to the British authority, who ihmmediately forwarded the 1,000 ducats to save his relative from assassination. Nfr. Barbar, our acting Consul, immediately wrote to V ietri, under the impression that the Vice-Consul had been arrested, to offer such assistance as was at his disposal. Of the confidence, too, which is reaUy felt hrr tho anfection of the ponpnlatinn T g_avA you somie instances when reporting the f6tc of Piedi Grotta. Since then I havebeeninformedthatthesewers in the line of route of the procession were explored on the vigil or the morning of the fRfe to ascertain if any combustible matter had been placed in them, and a gnard was placed at the entrance to each. Are these precautions necessary ? Then what must be the character of the Government ! A nation loves not disorder for its own sake, the Neapolitans especiallyareloversof thedolce far nieufo, yetherewehave an instance of a pcop'e, according to the showing of the authoritieswhose natural disposition is perverted, and who have become a nation of conspirators. What is the ca-e of this 9 It is a problem worthy the solution, for 7e a;sured that the peace of Europe will one day de-eid upon ib. For the present it is clear to a blind man that a Government occupied with prec.autions is incompatible with all social progress. Several of the Continental journals speak of the probability of a reconciliation between this Court and the WVestern Powers. Russia wishes it, it is said; but if such a wish is the only ground of the belief, it surely rests on aimoat insufficient basis, and I see no other grounds than this. England and France have not obtained one of the objects for which they broke off diplomatic relations with Naples. The political prisoners still pine in confinement,-nay, rolitical suspicion haa claimed and imprisoned inore victims. No great administrative changes have been made, and certainly not the slightest disposition is manifested to is:teoduce organic changes. In fact, the system of Government so long persisted In has become stereotyped, and an obstinate independence has at times assumed the appearance of discourtesy in the relations with foreigu Powcrs. How, then, can England and France resunle their former intimacy with this Government without convicting themselves of imbecility, or sonmething worse, in having broken off diplomatic relations with it on insufficient grounds. Such conduct woould remind one of the pouting of children, followed as quickly by a hiss, and it is diflicult to believe that the two great Powers will so far compromise themselves, or Eo far abandon the cause of humanity and of progress. There is an impression among many that the Five per Cents. will be reduced to Four per Cents. There is not the slightest novelty in the expectation, for it has been lob believed to be a favourite measure of the Government to make the reduction. The Five per Cents. have this week risen as high as 1131, and the ol( hab.tiits of the Stock-Exchange look forward to their rising so high as 120. In fact, artific al efforts combinse with industrial and commercial inactivity to favour this rise. There is no other opportunity for the investment of capital but in the Government Foinds.

THE FATAL ACCIDE?T ON TZLY UlEAT YORTRRRN RAILWAY. TUXFORD, FRrDAY. This norning an inquest on the bodies of the four persona killed in the accident on the main line of the Great Northern Railway, about two miles south of Taxford, a, briefly reported in a telegraphio deEpatch in ThC Times of to-day, was opened at the NeweastIe Arms, Tuaford, before Mr. W. Newton and a respectable jury. The jury, having been sworn, proceeded to view the bodies, which were laid on stretebers in the large room of the imn That of the Hon. W. W. Olive presented no marks of violence except a superficial cut on the face. The bead of MLs Letitia Paget was a shapeless mass. The head of Mis. Heaton was crusbed almost entirely flat. The body of Mrs. Pitman exhibited no outward marks of injury, and he r face wore quite a plaoid expression. The jury next proceeded to inspect the scene of the accident, hir. Leith, the superintendent of the Great Northern line, having provided a special train for the purpose. From information afforded to the jury on the spot hi appeared that the breakvan in the rear of the train and-tb carriage next to it were observed by the platelayerson the line to oscillate violently for about 100 yards, after which the third carriage from the end came into violent collision with the cap of a buttress of the viaduct over the road from Newark to Tuxford, and aU three tumbled down the embaankment. The violent shook thus given to the train broke the book of the tender to which the first carriage was coupled, snl the engine ran away for about 200 yards bo fore the driver could bring it up. In the meantime the two foremost carriages passed over tho bridge, being already off the rails, and on arriving at the south side rollod down the embankment, turning completely over. Assist. ance was rendered, and the passengers were attended to as promptly as possible, but it was found that two of the ladies in the train were quite dead, and e ihira survived only a few minutes. The other person killed, the ffon. Mr. Olive, was thrown nut of the carriage in which be was riding, and was dashed with great viot-nee against one of the piers of the viaduct. He never spoke afterwards, but lived in an unconscious state for about a quarter of an hour. The other passengers wero injured, as has already been described in The Timi:3, with the exception that Captain Marshall has not sustained such a severe injury of the eye as was at first reported. The jury returned to the inquest-room at aboutlO o'clock Mr. Leith, superintendent of the Great Northern line, wal present to watch the case for the company. Mr. Graves the resident engineer; Mr. Child, the cosnpany's. surgeon; and Mr. Williams, the superintendent of the poiice of the line, were also present. The Coroner, addressing the jury, said, as they had now viewed the bodies and inspected the place where the accident they had met to inquire into had occurred, he begged to say that he proposed to-day only to go into so much of the evidence as would put them in possession of the main facts connected m ith this unfortunate occurrence, and then to adjourn the inques; to a future day, to ascertain, if possible, the cause of the catastrophe. This would afford to the friends of the deceased and surviving sufferers by the accident an opportunity of being presest at the investigation, and of making any inquiries which they niight deema necessary for their own satisfaction. In the meantime he was requested to state that the officiale of the company were anxious to give every facility for eliciting the fullest possible information as to the cause of the accoident, and that no expense or trouble would be spared for thlt purpose. They d already had afforded to them by Mr. Leith anopportunity of making the minutest examinatiionof the scene of the accident, and any of the company's servants whoce evidence might be required by the jury would be brought before them. The officials of the line had telegraphed to the Board of Trade information of the accident, and a gentleman would ba sent down from that office, and they would haWve the benefit of his as,istance at a future inquiry. The Coroner then proceeded to examine the witnesses in attendance. Mr. John Marr, of Morecambe, near Lancaster, brother to Mrs. Mary Heaton, and cousin to Miss Letitla Paget, identified the bodies of those two ladies. He satd,-Mrs. eatoen wasa widow, 63 years of age,and resided at1S, Green-square, Lancaster. Miss Paget was 43 or 44 years .f age, and resided at Forton-lodge, near Manchester. They both left the Lancaster railway station yesterday morning. Mr. Richard Beoth, travelling auditor for the Great Nortbern Railway Company, i'entifled the body of Mrs. Pitman. She was the wife of Mr. Pitman, the receiver of the conmpany's rents. Richard Baol, groom of the chambers to the mother of the Ron. W. Windsor-Windsor Clive, at Flewell Ilall, Brc.msgrove. Worcestershire, identified the body of the ur.ortunate you-g gentlemnan. Hew as 20 years of age, and started from Manchester vesterday morning by the Great Norfhern train in perfect health. James S-nith, of Bary, Lmncashire examined.-I was travelling by the Great Northern Railway yesterday from Menrhestcr to London. I was in the end oompartmint of a first-class carriage. We eCt h5onehcr,fiOo'olevk a.m. The train i gtimed for ! 55. We were not more than five minutes late. The first stoppage we made was at Guideb?idge,whero we pulled up for two or three minutes. The next stoppage was at Sbeffeld, and I remarkied to a friend in the carriage hosr punctually we ran, haring a ri-adshaoes Gu'de in my hand. We stayed 30 minutes or a quarter of an hour a, Sheffrlhd. We went slowly round by the curve at Iletford. The next stoppage was at the place of the accident. I think we went a little faster between Sheffield and the place of the accident than between Manchester and Sheffidid. I did not consider it more tha. the usual speed for an express train. I have been accusto ned to travel in express trains. When I left Manchester I was in the seaue carriage with Ar. Pitman and his lady. At Sheflield uiy friend Mr. Raynor and myEelf left tha hind compartment of the carr.age arnd 6ge into the front compartmeent of the eama vehicle. A gentlenian was in the carriage, whom I have since awccertained was the Hon. Mr. Clive. I felt the accident all at once-as sudden as a gun.hot. As far as I can remember I did no)t feel any oscillation o. the carriage before we were doubled up as It were, and falling down the slope of the embankument. The effect was as if a person had put his foot into a bandhjx and crushed it up. The only conversation I had with Mr. Clive was whether he was a smoker. lie eaid he was, aud we changed carriages to smoke witl hin. Mr. Clive was sitting with his back to the ergine, and next to the window, which was about half open. As soon as I gathered myself up I found that I had no injury but a great pain at the bottnei of the baok. My friend and myself shortly after foraid Mr. Clive laid on an embankment below the railway. My friend gave him a little brandy and water, but ho did not revive. I did lno notice that were going at any additional speed at the ti ne the accident occnrred. I belteve we were keeping corree' time. After the acci,lent I went Io the tep of the bank an i over the bridge, but I did not observe any displacement if the metals, or a-ything to i odicate the cause of the accident, except a disturbance of the ballast whero the carriages had left the lIne. Mr. Braithwaite Raynor, of Bnry, Lancashire, corroborated the evidence of Mr. Smit', but he did not think they stopped more than 10 or 12 minutes at Sheffield. The guard told hhmn tbey should notstop more than 10 minutes. His impression was they were not going at more tban the proper speed, considering that the distance between MancheeFer and London had to be accomplished tinfve hours, Ile thought they wvent too slowly from Manchester to Shafhld, and that they went a little quicker after th,y left Retford, but not s.) iiuh so as to excite anv remark. It did not seen more than expresa speed. EIe felt a slight oscillation just before the accident, but they went over almost iustantmeously. Ile did not observe any jumnpiDg of the carriages previously, or anything to indicate an obstruction on the line. Ile wernt upon the line after the accident, b-at could discover no clue to the accident, and wa3S ouite at a loss to account for it. When the fir<t shock was over Mr. S nith and himself found themselves on their backs on the ro.f of the carriage, which was upside down. When th.-yreco,-ored fro.n theolhook they lookod about for their friend (Mr. Clive), and foaud him owl the slope of the bank quite uieonsejoois. The carriage was smassheI to pieces. Mr. and Mrs. Pitman wer 'in the first compartment of the carriage ; Some ladies were in the middle compartment; and Ur. Smith, Mr. Clive, and himself, were in the last compartment. Robert Brooks, a platelayer in the employ of the Great Northern Company, examined.-I was workiilg yesterday on the line near the Weston-bridge. I saw the Manchester express coming in sight, and asked one of the men what time it was. He looked at his watch, and said it was two minutes to 12. The train was then about tbree. quarters of a mile from where I was and appeared to be travelling quit right. I saw the three hindmost carriages strike the comer of the bridge. They wero the twol ast carriages and the break. All the carriages were off the line. The last three carriages turned over the embankment on to the ro.ui. The engine and two front carriages went over the bridge, and about 30 yards on the othor sido the couplers of the carriages broke, and the vehicles fell over the embrekmont. The engine and tender went on the line for about 400 yards, and then tbey stopped. I could not say whether the guard put on the b:e'.k or not. After tbe train went off both of the metals were thrown ont of the giuge a few yards from ths bridge. I gauged the rest of the metals and fonDd them perfect. After we got the p as- sengers out I went down the lino to where the carriages loft the rails, but found nothing to account for the accident. John Shaw, of Peterborough, engine driver, examined.-I am the driver of the No. 13 express train from Manchester. I go from Sheffield to Peterborough, and Peterborough to Sheffield. Yesterday I drove the same engine as I have had for the last three weeks for this train. I left Peterborough the night before, when the engine was aU right. I left Sheffield at 11.13. I took the time from my own watch and the clock at t.he station. I do not keep any memorandum of the time. I had an engine, four carriages, and a break. I got to Retford station at a quarter to 12 o'clock. We are not timed there. At the time the accident bappened it was two minutes to 12 o'clock. I looked at my watch. I was driving at the rate of 50 to 55 miles an hour. I judged thia from tho time we had been coming. I did not notice anything wrong till I got on the ridge, when I felt a jerk at the engine. I reversed my omaite, and on looking bhak I Paw tw;o carriages next the tender going over the bank. We bad only one break to the train. We used to have two, but now we have an empty carriage nex' to the engine instead. There was a bell on my tender, but there was no communicationbetween the guard and me. Ihave alwayshad one before. This was the only time I have been without the communication. I do not knov the reason it was omitted. It Is the duty of the porters to put on the om:munication. From RetFord to Txford w.e went at our regular speed.

I do not know why the communication was not put on the train. The guard whistles when ther is no conmunication. I have never travelled without the communication beforp vith this traini. I did not tell the porter agl'Sheffield that there was Do communication. I have not hea;d that it.is ithive ruo lation of the company that there sall be a com icatepbion between thegtender and the break. TXhe C-oroner here inquired of Mr. Leith whether it was a regulation that the communication should he used witli these trains. 4mr. Leith replied thab it was. Esamination of witness continued-It edi the dey of ther guard to see that the communication is put on. By a J pryman.-I don't know whose duty it iat see th.t tie communication between guard and driver was put on. It is not ry duty. It is a regulation of the cordpany that they shall be put en. Whien the communic-ation is on and. te be ri Wg three times we stop. If it had been on whez. tie accident occurCI it would have mado very little differ. er ce. We should not have had time to pull up. The Coroner bere read the 57th ruile of the companiy's regulations oni this subject, -which Is as folllows: 'Theaexict time for performing each journey.wil be fixer by the time-table, and the great object of the enginemah must he to keep his engine ming reghearlyatothe speed required, and from which speed he should vary 1, little as possible, never exceeding the speed actualy required for keeping tho time diuctually, and therefore never arriving at any of the stativ.S, or any part of the ne, or atthe end of temjourne before time. If employed in taking empty carriages or empty engines along the sine, he must not exced a speeis of r nc ailen per hour without special f rders to that effert." hlar. Poler Whfiftington, surgeon, of Taxford, examined.- I got to "Veston-bridge between 12 and 1 o'clolck yesterday. The firsb pcroneu I saw was Mrs. Pitman, who was lying oL i her hack, dead. There was no fracture of the skull. she appears to have died from internal concussion. I saw the other two deceased ladies. The cause of their death was auffiiently apparent from the extensive fracture of their skulls. Mr. George Borlase Cbilds, U1, Finsbury-place souts,, surgeon to the Great iNorthern Company, -I have examined the bodies of the four deceased. I have exanmined Mr. Olive. There is severe laceration of the leftthumb, aMnd aimaU wound over the sight angle of the lower jaw, I cannot discover any fracture of the skuall.The cause of death. in tuncertain, except that it arose fromn the accident. It may have-been from conussion-ofthe spine or brain. Miss Letitia Pagel had a severe fracture of the sku, and thera was au escape of nearly the whole of the brain, also a faoctue of all the bones of the fac. Mrs. Heaton has fracture of the Mkurl. The top of the skull is completely gone from the base, without any appearance of scalp wound. Mrs. Pitman, bad a simple fracture of the leif leg, and some abrasions of the faco. The immediate cause of death is uncertain; it yave been iro concussion of the brain or ncusre sion of rheaier Gray v uckby, surgeon, Sutton-on-Trent.-ws arrived at the scene of the accident at about 1 o'clock. I saw Mr. Clive almost immiediately after my arrival. He wag lying on the bank. I saw no marks of violence. I attribute his death to conuassion of the spiun. Mr. Leioth, gapErtotendent of fhe Orrat Northern line. was next examined as to the cause of the accident, but he Said he had net yet formed any opivion on that poin, baxt be thouaht he should be able to do so at the adjourned inquiry. Fe did not think a light train incurred anay morer cTanger in going down an incline than other traits.A.& hleavier train would he more difficult to pul up. It was a regulation of the company to hadve the communication be. tween the guard and driver put on all these trains. It wax the duty of the guard to see that work done. After some conversation between the juiy and Mr. Leith, The Coroner intimated that they had now gone through all the evidence that would he adduced to-day, and thet inquest would therefore staud adjiourned to a future day for It ws, lte soe dicusion setle that the inquiry should st.and adjourned to Tnesday nest. Mlr. Child, the surgeon to the company, stated that all the wfounded persons were going on very favourably, and that it was now hopoed the wehole of them would recover.

LORD JORN RUqSBELL AT SBBFFIBLD. ---------- do- Lord and Lady John Russell, with three of their chil dren, arrived in Sheffield on Thursday evening, his Lordship hAving accepted an invitation to preside at the annual meeting of the ragged sohool on the following day. The noble lord met with a very hearty reception. The Town-Counoil met yesterday at 11 to present an address, voted at a speoial meeting on Monday, to Lord John RusselL Before his Lordship?s arrival the Mayor addressed the Council, stating that he had received from Earl Granville, now in attendance on Her Majesty at Balmoral, a reply stating that Her Majesty graciously consented to receive a deputation of the Town-Council to present an address on the occasion of her visit to Earl Fitzwilliam at Wentworth-house. It was then resolved, on the motion of Alderman F. Hoole, that a loyal address be also presented on the same occasion to his Royal Highness the Prince ConSOrt. Shortly before half-past It Lord and Lady John Russell arrived at the Council-hall, and were received with much cheering. On their appearance upon the benoh of the aldermen the cheers were loudly renewed. The Town-Clerk then read an address welcoming Lord John Russell's first visit to Sheffield. Lord J. RUSSELL (loud cheers).-Mr. Mayor, I thank you and the members of the corporation for the kindness which has prompted the hearty welcome that you have given me on my visit to the borough of Sheffield. You may be confident that I shall continue to be the advocate of civil and religious freedom, of social progress, extended education, and constitutional reform. The spirit of the age, the union of statesmen favourable to progress, and the enlightened opinion of the people have enabled mne, among others, to carry to a successful issue many Important measures. Thae twenty years from 1828 to 1848, beginning vith the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts aud ending with the repeal of the Navigation Act, were remarkable for progress without revolution, while in the last of the years I have mentioned we had in many continental States revolution without progress. Lt us hope that In the fature we may witness the same spiril of i-provement aocom panied with the same reverence for institution3 under whose sae the nation has enjoyed so large an amouant of liberty and happiness. It is impossible to abstract our minds from the events which have recently afflicted our Indian empire. A revolt of the most treacherous character, accompanied by murders of the most savage atroclty, has filled us with horror and Indignation. Yet amid these terrible scenes it is permitted to us to hope that If, in restoring our dominion, energy is combined with a deliberate plan of action-if the sword of Justice is not separated from her baance-if in providing for the future government of Indla we can reconcile our duties as Christians with the most entire reli3ious liberty, and a benevolent rule with the firm assertion of power, we may preserve to Great Britain and to civilization a fairer and more secure empire than we have ever hitherto poesessed. Gentlemen, I beg to wiah you and the town you represent a continuance and increase of your present prosperity. His Lordship and Lady Russell then left to attend tho annual meeting of the ragged schools MErEING OF TiE RAGGED ScHooLs. The meeting was held in the Music-halL LordJohn Russell presided, supported by Lord Whanoliffe, the Hon. F. S.

The proceedings having opened with prayer, Mr. ELLIS. the secretary, read a report, from which it appeared that since the establishment of this institution about 1,690 destitute children had been instructed in it; that the managers possessed evidence that the schools had been a great blessing to many of those ohildren; that some had been rescued from prison, from beggary, and from wicked companions, and are now growing up as u8aftl members of society,-earnlng a honest liveihood. Lord WHARNCLIFFE moved the adoption of the report, and expressed the pleasure it afforded him to see gentlemen connected not only with his own but all other religious bodies in the town, except the Roman Catholics, assembled to join in promoting education among the poorer classes of the community, and re- ring the young of this town from lives of infamy. (Cheers.) The Rev. T. SALE, D.D., seconded the resolution, and urged the necessity of oaution in confining tho charity to the realy destitute, otherwise it might become a serious injury rather than benefit, by undermining the independenoe of those who were able to pay for the eduoation of their children. lord JoHN RUSSELL was recelved with loud cheers. He said,-Before I put this resolution to the meeting, and the collection takes place which is to fo1low thereupon, I beg leave to address a few observations to you upon this and other institutions of a similar kind. I have had great plea. sure in accepting the Invitation which was given to me by Alderman Hoole to come here to preside at this meeting. I accepted the invitation booau. I thi it in of very great importance that inour large towns means such as and sim3lar to these should be adopted for the purpose of promoting our progress in social and religious knowledge. It may be said with regrd to a country parish that there are persons who are by their fortune and property bound, whilo others are by law bound and entitled, to consider all the concerns of that parish; to take into their view those who are destitute, as well as those co npetent to maintain themselves, and thus to see that eduoation is given to all, as well as the means of sustaining life. But when we come to the large towns-and I would now more especially revert to the great metropolis of this country-we find that the employments are so diversified, and the employers frequently in such a position of isolation from the poorer classes, that there comes to be almost a community, I would call it, of young and poor persons, who run the utmost danger of becoming criminals, and thus of losing all their hopes of well doing in this world and of salvation in the next. It Is but too apparent that many of those classes alluded to in the report-persons who have lost both their parents, and whose other relations are, perhaps, living at a great distance; those whose parents have been sent to prison for criminal offences; and many of those one of whose parents has deserted them, and the other is unable to support them-there are among classes of this kind many young persons who wander about the streets exposed to every temptation, and who are thus liable to faU into vice and be the pests of the country in which they reside. I remember seeing in the gaol, at Newgate, two young boys who had been committed for some small offence of larcesy. One of them, when questioned as to how he maintained himself in food and lodging, said he went into the streets and held gentlemen's horses, or did any odd job which any one would give him, and thus procured twopcnce for his bed and the money requisite to bay food. But upon being asked how he did in the chance of not obtaining sufficient in that way, he replied, " I get it as I can." We naturally conclude that this " getting it as I can" was none other than pilfering the property of others, which he found in the streets where his wanderings took him. lt is very easy to lament this state of thiDgs; it is stiU more easy to blame the persons who commit Dhts, offences But I really do think it is the duty of society not only to lament and blame, but also to endeavour to renedy the evil. It is a reproach to a Christian nation that there should be boys and girls running about who have no means of sustenance, no one to teach them what is their duty to God and their neighbours, and without the means of any honest employment by which to earn their bread. Then there comes the question,-a vast and mighty question,upon which men of the greatest intellect in former tinses and in the present times have employtd their understandings, endeavouring to promote measures which they thought conducive to the good end-samely, the question whether by any system of poor laws or any system of liational eduoation wecould provide for these cases ? Hitherto there have been found innunierable practical objections to the adoption of any sufficient or satisfactory course. Of course I do not advert to any particular restrictionsorlimits,but allimenare agreed that there must be a limit to the assistance given by the State in that respect. If, again, we look at the question of a natio.al system of education, we find that the utmost differences prevail, and, amnong otber differences, that which is perhaps the foremost, the religious difficulty of inducing persons of various denominations of Christians to agree, in the first place, whether religious instruction should be given at all, and in the next place to what extent that instruction should be given. For my own part, I cannot say that I feel the doubts which many persons have felt upon this subject. In my own mind I certainly have come to the conclusion that the religious part of man, as I may say-that that fa- ulty wvhich induces us to seek religious consolation, and which I believe is part oi our, nature, perhaps the. vev .R part of it, Cannot be neglected in any system of eduaybtion (Cheers.) And likewise, although we have not hitherto come to any agreement upon the subijet-although our differences are stlll so wide that there are no means of adopt. ing a measure which will be generally satisfactory, my belief is that if such rev. gentlemen as the one who has just spoken, and those who have charge of the educatioa of very young children, would attend more to religion and less to theology-if they would teach that which is really the religious eentiment, and leave the differences of creeds to be afterwards explained by the ministers of the different denominations when the children are of riper age to understand those differences-I believe if the attempt was made really to found education upon the cultivation of the relgious sentiment, upon a cbelief in the Being who is the giver of all good, and iu the immensity of the great sacrifice that has been made for mankind, the great religiou didficulty vould be foaud in no very long time to disappear. (Cheers.) But we have not yet arrived at that state of opinion, or that state of education. It is therefore absolutely neces- sary as ippears to me, whether you wfill look upon it that th state of ereeis for ever to subsi"t, or whether you suppose that in time we shall get over these diffioulties, that for the presentatleast thevoluntaryeffortsof those wholove mankind and whohaveafeeliDgof regardfortheirneighboursandforthe safety of society should combine in endeavouring to provide by what are called ragged schools, and by schools of a simailar description a supply for the wants to whieh I have adverted. I believe tat if those wants are supDlied, although wa certainly can never hope in our most sanguine expectation that temptations will not divert many from an honest and relious course, yet that the number of those who a-e sent to prison, who not having originally viciou3 inclinations, are yet perverted by bad example and the eir- oumstances of their position-that the unumber of those vho are criminally punished Will very much decrease, and society be a great gainer thereby. Let u consider in every respect how muc we can do by enablinag those children to lead an honest life, and to obtain the means of knowledge. However elementary the instruction may be, a knowledge of reading and writing puts Into their hands the great instrument by which eminence of every kind is to be achieved. The young person availine himself of the talents which God has implanted in him will, finding that he has these instrumer-ts in his hands, pursue his own course; and we know that in this free country, happily from among the humblest ranks and pursuits there hAve arisen men who have benefited their country by their discoveries in science, and by their services in the State and in the field-by the abilties they have displayed in the law and in the church. Snob being the case, in this point of view you render a real service to the country. But the moral service you render is of still far higher importance; for, instead of having these poor pesons wandermg aboat the streets, and thus led into crime, if you can induce them to pursue an honest course of life-if they can be recommended by those who have seen their conduct, whether as shoeblacks or in any other occupation, as steady, honest, and faithful-if you can thus procure employment for them, you'notonly benefit the wvhole community and add to the prosperity and stability of the country, but you have the consolation of reflecting that you have not neglected the immortal part of those who are your fellow *creatures, (Cheers.) Such, as I conceive, is the foundation of the effort to establish ragged schools in our great towns. Of course, there will remain those who refuse their assistance, who are so involved in vicious inclination and in crime that it Is not possible by this means to reclaim them. But can any one say that we have hitherto done our utmostinthis respeot? Is there not stiU a great defect, a great want of effort for this purpose? Hsve those who have been blessed with affluence, as * consequence, it may be, of their own application and industry in the various trades which are pursued in this country, used those means for the improvement of their fellow-creatures as well as for the enjoyment of those luxuries and comforts which wealth has placed within their reach ? I am afraid the answer must be that hitherto in this country, however we may pride ourselves upon our knowledge, our freedom, and our power, there is still a greatdutyto dotoourfellow-meni thisrespect. I know that there does ecist in this country, and I have no doubt in this town, a wholesome spirit of independence, which induces those who wish education either for themselves or their children rather to pay for what they receive, and thus to be under no obligation to any one, than to ,eeia ,.5.o uynary gransa ror t eir edacation. (Cheers.) A gentleman who hoids a high position in the House of Commons told me that in his neighbourhood he had established an evening class for elementary instruction on matters of science. He made it, as it were, a free schooL It was very little attended, and likely to be a total failure, when he made it a condition that a certain sum should be paid by all who attended. Immediately the school began to fill, and very soon a respectable class were in attendance, because, while the people saw that it was something worth their pay. ing for, they felt they did not part with any of their independence, as they would have felt they were doing by receiving gratuitously instruction for which they were well able to pay. They did pay, and they received the instruction. I myself am connected with a school to which those who pay a certain sum, and are not able to pay more, may come and receive elementary instruction; but those whose means enable them to pay more are at liberty to do so, but receive no better instruction than those who pay the smaller sum. You might suppose that none would pay the laroer sum, but the fact is that more than one-half of those who attend pay the larger sum, in order that they may retain that which is higbly valuable-that sense of independence arising from the conscioumess that they are paying for that -which they receive, and *re not placed under any obligation to those who conduct and had established the school, but that it is a free and reciprocal bargain between man and man, and that they who receive the benefit are as fully independent as those who confer it. (Cheers.) Now, it is a most valuable thing to cultivate that feeling * I believe, as you have been told, that this Ragged Schools institution oaght not to go one inch beyond te purpose for which it was intended, and that if you were successful in giving education to the children and parents freely and without payment, who could well afford to pay for it, you would be doing injury instead of benefit, and that a certain degradation of mind would accompany the reception of it. (Cheers.) 'The MAYOR moved "that the meetingrejoicesto recognise in Lord John Russell the untiring advocate of education among all classes of the community, and that the best thanks of the meeting are due to his Lordship for his kindness in coming a great distance to preside at this meeting." (Cheers.) This resolution was cordiaUy received. Lord J. RUSSELL.- (Loud cheers.)-I have now to returu, and a very pleasant task it is, my thanks for the manner in which you have passed this resolution. Before I do so, let me say, with regard to the collection, that since 1401. has been. aised in the room mesns will be found to induce others to add their subscriptions, and so make the entire amount. There is a proverb which says the absent are alwasva in the wrong. I hope that in this case they wlli not be in the wrong by withholding their subscriptions, though they have not had the pleasure of being present. With regard to my ooming here to-day, I am sure it has been a very little inconvenience and a very great pleasure and gratification. (Cheers.) I am glad to see every effort made to p remote education, whether it be the education of the highest classese, conducted at the Uiniversities of Oxford and Cambridze, or others which have been founded for the education of the very po'orest in ragged schools. With improvement in the mind I look for improvement in manners, and the abandonment of those grosser vices which belong rather to our animal than our intellectual nature, and which degrade the name of man. Many may rememberperbaDs not a great many. hnt T f o.ro 40o 4er years ago there existed a very anxious and uneasy state of society. The Government of that dav had the greatest distrust of the people. 'They were passing laws almost every session which a member of the Government described as laws ot aevere coercion, and the bearing of the people was ful of resentment and distrust. During these 40 years there has arisen a very different state of feeling-a feeling on the part of the Government of entire trust in the people, and on the part of the people of great loyalty to the Throne and of confidence In our institutions. We do not now find men of the higher classes spending their evenings in a degraded way, and ladies of wealth do not gamble away their fortunes. May we not suppose that a Eimilar change will take nlace in those whom fortune has not so favoured? Writh education furnishing the means by which we can spend our days anu evenings in more intellectual Dursuits, whicb, according to a great orator of antiquity, are delightful in prosperity, a com. fort in adversity, which go with a man when he journeys and remain with him at home-pursuits of this kind w'll take the place of intemperate indulgence and vicious appetites. Thoug there may be some portion of the community yet indulging in such habits, we may hope they will be much diminished. I shall ever remember this day with satisfaction. I am grateful for the manner in which l have been received, and I trast to merit the good opinion you have been pleased to express. (Loud oheere.) Mr. JOnLN WilsoN, grinder, then came forward and presented Lord John Ruisell with an address, voted to his rwdship at a public meeting of the working classes held on Tuesday evening. Ur. HENRY LEVY and Mr. SAIIUEL, as a deputation fronr the Jews resident in Sheffield, also presented an address thanking Lord John Russell for his exertions in behalf of religious and civil liberty. Lord JouiN RUSSELL (cheers).-When I arrived here yes. terday I had no expectations of having any addrssses presented to me of the flattering character which I have now received. But it gives me the highest gratification that you should have thought any efforts of mine worthy of being commemorated in the terms that you have used. For my own part, I cannot but peroeive that it was my good fortune to take a part in Parliament in behalf of measures of civil and religions liberty, of reform in the representation, of the removal of restrictions upon trade and commerce, to which public opinion was inclining, and in favour of which a preponderating weight at length prevailed. Very many abler men and better men than myself had failed in those endeavours. They failed because at that time either the nation was engaged in the overwhelm. iug interests of war, or that the prejudices and falso theories of writers had so far prevailed as to prevent those men (my predecessors) being listened to. That to which I owe the success of any efforts I have made in conjunction with the House of Commons was, that pablic opinlon was ripening at that time, and finally declared in favour of those measures of which I have been the hxmble advocate. (Cheers.) we all know, and we have seen it in the present year, that upon the decision of those who possess the franchise depends ultimately the solution of the great and important questions which from time to time agi. tate the country. The House of Commons may be of one opinion, the House of Lords of another; the Crown may be disaatified with the decision of one of those bodies ; the operation of the constitution may seem to be suspended for a time; but all persons ultimately acquiesce in the decision of those who possess the franchise. Now, gentlemen, in allotting the franchise in the leform Act, we who framed that Act were solicitoi^us while we made a large extension of the franchise, while we destroyed nomination-at the same time to carry those changes into effect peaceably and quietly, becanse, whtvrohe l3e mrsfe uth course of violent changes, I am persuaded that those who belong to the working class of this country are the most likely to suffer in any change which seta at war with eaoh other the different classes of the ommunity. (Cheers.) That I am sure the working men feel, and therefore it was that in the Reform Bill, though at the time it was thought unduly bold, and though many charactorized it as rasb, Lord Grey and those whoe acted with him knew that they framed their measure in a spirit of caution, and that it was better to frame it in a spirit of caution than to run any risks to the peace of this great community. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I believe the time has como-and the Government of the day has allowed that the time has come-when the fran. chise may be further extended, and I think, nearly in the words of the Prime Minister, that large clamses who have not hitherto possessed the franchise should in fature enjoy and exercise that privilege. (Loud cheers.) You will not loubt, I hopo, that I sha be very glad to see a measure introduced by Government by which the franchise will be thus extended. And I am persuaded that the time which has elapsed sine the Reform BiU of 1&32 has enabled many classes to so improve themselves and their means of judgment as to exercise that franchise wisely for the benefit of the community. It is the difference between this country and many others that its institutions rest upon a largo basis, and that no' only for the special purposes of an election, but likewise in the constant and daily operations of our constitution. You see it in your muni- cipal franchise; you see it in the proceedings that take place in various pacts of the country, in the expressions of public meetings, in the writings of the daily press. Itis thus in fine, and together, that those changes that took place expreseed the wi of the community. Perhaps it would be difficult to name another natioa which exercises that power with equal calmness, eqisal sobriety, and equal temper and judg- ment. (Cheers.) But such I am persuaded is the character of this nation. You may differ from me, I may differ from you, on different occasions and on separate mea. sures; but I go heartily with the working men of this country to see their franchises extended (cheers), End that all odasae of the people may have Increased xstisfac. tion in the working of their institutions. I think there has been from time to time an undue jealousy between one clmss aLnd another. I have often seen with pain that at. tempt-s were mande t-o deprive those -who are in the ranks which entitle them and their doesendAnt. to seats In the House of Lords; of the good feeling and sympathy of the c-ountry. My opinion has always been with one of our poets, that- 'They who on gloriDus ancesiora enlage "Produce their debt instead of their dIscharge. (Cheers.) I am convinced that they who have ancestors to boast of are only more bound to consult the welfare of the community ; and that, knowing that this country haus never flourished except in the enjoyjment of liberty, it is their duty especially to promoto the liberties of this country. (Cheers.) I trust, therefore, that in all future changes that may take place, as well as in previous changes, while we extend the bounds of religous liberty, and I trust it will be done soon-while we extend to the Jew that liberty which has been given to the Protestant Dissenter and the Roman Catholic-while we extend and fortify our institu.- tions, that it will be done with the common consent of all classes in this country and that thus this country may continue to flourish ; that we shali not se, as some envious persons have presumed to conjecture-that we shall not see our power In any par.' of the globe diminish. (Cheer'.) I am convinced that it w'ould be a great curse and injury to mankind if the power of England were to be in any way crippled. I trust that we may continue to grow greater and greater, andl that we shall use that power for the benefit of all mankind. (Cheers.) I hope, gentlemen, that I may allude in a few, ords t a subject which has greatly occupied the public mind. I trust no one wil believe that we are about to suffer a diminutioni of our territo~ in the East. I believe, on the contrary, that if our exegon are well', directed, we shall find that that empire will be establishedl with greater solidity than it has ever been before. (Cheers.) knmow very well that acme of the Sheffield blades (laughter)-and those blades cut sharp-will be employe irn the service of their country, and, like every Yorkshirman, and like every man of this country, I have no doubt that they will do their duty. (Cheerm) We shall. know in future to whom we can. trust, and we shall know in whoso hainds we ought to place arms again. (Hear, hear.) We shall be then enlightened by experience, and I have that faith In the courage of this country, and that faith in its justic and humanity, that I feel sure that while it has strength to gain the victory it wil haveI moderation to mnake a good use of that victory. (Cheers.) Tzt-re are orner questions which will require the most careful delibration samd the application of the greatest wisdom on the part of Parliament. Upon those questions, of course, I shall niot touch at prewnt; hut we ll agre-we in this room, we in all parts of the country agr ee, that when an effort is to be made we mnust not shrink. fom it. We lmust be prepard to meet it and then this nation willcome trumphant out of the struggle. (Hlis Lordship resumed his seat amid loud applause.) A call was made for " thxec cheers for Lord John Russell." This was heartily responded to, and the meeting then broke up.
We have reason to believe that at the Privy Council held at Balmoral yesterday a Royal proclamation was issued, setting apart a day for national Humiliation and Prayer in consequence of the unfortunate events arising from the Indian mutinies. The day selected for this purpose would in all probability be Sunday, the 4th of October.-Globe. His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Cliet and the Duchess and Princess Mary of Cambridge and suite, including the Lady Geraldine Somerset, Lord Burghersh, Baron Knesebeck, Colonel Clifton, Colonel Maude, &c., arrived at the Rtoyal Ship Hotel, Dover on Thurday, from Calais and Paris, in the new mail packet Prince Frederick William, specially ordered for the service. Captain Smithett attended their Royal HighneesE across the Channel, and they were received at Dover under a salute from the heights by the Admiralty superintendent, Commander M'llwaine, and a nuard of houour furnished by the 25th Regiment, commandea by Colonel Lessons, accompanied by the excellent band of the regiment. After dinner at the Ship Hotel, to which Captain Smithett had the honour to be invited, the Royal Dnke and his military attendants proceeded to London. Their Royal Highnesse3 the Duchess of Cambridge and the Princess Mary and suits remained at Dover on Thursday night, and arrived in London yesterday afternoon. The Commander-in-Chief and his aides-de-camp have been on a visit to the Imperial camp at Chalons, and have been the guests of the Emperor in the field. THE TELEGRAPH BETWmEN LiVERPOOL AND fL0yIIEAD.-The only means at present in use at Liverpool by which intelligence can be obtained of the arrival of vessels off the port is the old semaphore signal, which is, of Course, useless in times of fog. The propriety of intro. ducing the electric telegraph has lately occupied the attention of the Dock Committee, which body are now advertising for contracts for the construction of a line of electric telegraph from Liverpool to Holyhead, including communication with the semaphore stations.) SALOONS OasiLwus CosspAwY.-The first annual report of the direotors of the Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Company (Limited) states that on the 13th of April aLx omnibuses were placed upon the roads of the metropolis-viz., one running from Holloway tothe city, two from Notting.hiU to the city, one from Stoke Newington to the city, one from Stoke Newington to the west-end, and one from Daletou to the city. Tu four weeks in August ten omnibuses then running produced the sum of 7151. On the 17th of August an eleventh omnibus was started, and on the 31st of August the twelfth, both of which mors than j ustify the expectations of the directors, The numberof shareholders is530, who hold amongthem 11,873shares. The number of omnibuses at present in possession of the company is 15, and three more are nearly completed. The number of horses is 121, and both omnibuses and hores are in lirst-rate condition. Tho new omnibus, with the necessary number of horses, has cost the Saloon Company under 450L The balance of expenditure amounts to 2,4291., which the directors recommend should be written off to preliminary expenses. The capital account shows that 12,1881. had been received, including 3,458. on loan and acceptances, and 12,1881. expended, including 3,2001. paid to the patentee, 6,2471. for stock, and 2,4291. balance of loss proposed to be carried to preliminary expenses. RELiaious FRsnoAe nx TuprKY.-A correspondent has sent u3 a satement which tonds to prove the goid faith of the Turkish Government in carrying out the religious liberty guaranteed both to Christians and Mahomedans. At Constantinople a Turk and his wife and chiid have been baptized by the American missionary, Dr. Hamelin, with the name of " Freeman." It appears that on the 3d inst. two officers of the Porte went to the office of Dr. Hamelin, after previous notice, to investigate the case of the Freeman family, converted from MIahomedanism to Christianity. Dr. Hamelin at first demurred, but a strict examination took place. The officers of the Porte examined Mr. Freeman. The object was to ascertain whether he had been driven from Islamism to Christianity by any trouble or supposed wrongs, buttheanwers weredeemed satisfactoryby the Turkish authorities. MIrs. Freeman was then subjected to the same ordeal, aftcr which it was arranged that the Turkish lady and her daughter should have an interview together. The result coninnced Dr. Hamelin that there was no compulsion in the case, and the ceremony was therefore performed. The account adds, " It is the will of his Majesty our Sovereign, and it has become the established law of the empire, that every subject without any exception shall enjoy entire religious freedom. The Mussulman Is now as free to become a Christian as the Christia4 is free to become a Mussulmanu" Two days previously Dr Hamelin married a youug Protestant Armenian to a Turkish lady who had been baptized in Malta.
MB. BERBYAL OSBORNE, M.P., ON THB INDIAN CRISIS. A grand banquet took place at Dover on Thursday evening to celebrate the return of two Liberal members for that borough in the persons of Mr. R. B. Osborne and Sir W. Russell, Bart. It will be recollected that in the last Parliament Dover was represeated by one Liberal (Mr. E. R. Rice, who lately retired from public life) and one Conservative (Lord Chelsea), with whose polit'cal fortunes, mixed up as they were with a recent contest in the metropolitan county, the public are somewhat familiar. At the last general election, however, the Ministerialists in Dover secured both seats for their own candidates, defeating their opponents, Sir George Clerk and Mr. G. W. Rope, by large majorities. So signal a triumph has not crowned the exertions of the Liberals of this borough for many years past, the representation in several previous Parliaments havnlg been divided between the Whigs and the Conserva. tives. Another source of exultation to the Liberal interest was furnished by the fact that, though the seat of one of their members had been challenged on the score of corruption, and some disposition was at first evinced to press the chare, yet the authors of the petition withdrew it at the eeventh hour, thus aparing their opponent the vexation of i strmggle in committee. Sach a victory, therefore, it was thought ought not be allowed to pas without due comrnemoration. Eence theLiberal demonstration of Thursday. The festival was held in what by a local paradox is termed the "l Noew Town Hall, the remote antiquity of the structure having given rise to the somewhat apocryphal tradition that it was the identical chamber in whioh the recreant Ring John "signed away" his kingdom to the Pope. The building was tastefully decorated for the occasion, and the proceedings went off with great spirit. The party was a very numerous one, between 400 and 500 of the electors sitting down to dinner. A gallery spially fitted up for the ladies was also fully occupied. OnTy one of the borough members, Mr. Osborne, was able to take part in the ovation, that hon. gentlenan's gallant colleague, Sir W. Russell, who rscent y sailed wnth his regiment for India, having been called upon to share in sterner engagements, and, let us hope, in more splendid trinmphs than any known to the arena of politim Among the company present were Mr. Hugessen, M.P. for Sandwich, Oolonol Th omce, O.pt.al Noble, Messrs. Stariker Finnia (who resided), T. Birch (the Mayor), S. M. Latham, T. B. Bass,yl! Churchwiwrd, and man;- other local mapates. The ual loyal and patritic toaSts having been daly honoured, The CIURM.0I, in highIy eulogistic terms, gave "The Health of the Borough Members." The toast was draunk amid vehement applause. Mr. B. B. OsBonlmz, ,P., on rising to respond, was greeted with enthusisstic cheers Having briefly acknow. ledged the warm and flattering reception which the assemblage had accorded him, the hon. gentleman proceeded to explain that he would have gladly met his supporters earlier after the late contedt to thank them for their generous exertions on his behalf, but the fact was he had at first stood in a rather peculiar position. (A laugh). Although he had been triumphantly returned by the free and unbought voices of the constituency, without even the time-honoured formality of a peraonal canvass, he was bailed, to his no small surprise, on his return to London, with the accusation that he owved his election to the combined influence of bribery and intimidation. Such -were the calumnious insinuations noised about against him in various circles, and it was in vain that he andignantly denied them. People-whether from any knowledge of the previous charcter of the borough he knew not (a laugh)-would notbelieve his disclaimers; and, sure enough, he had not been many days in the new House of Commons before a petition was presented charging him ith al the crimes of which a member of Parliament only could be guilty. (Lfaughter.) This, he owned, startled him, because his banker's book, and indeed the published account also, would have shown that his nlection was singularly free from any taint of suspicion. HIowever. he soon began to smell a rat (a laugh); for in the course of a wieek from the reasrsembling of Parliament a communication wfas made to him by Sir W. Russell, his respected colleague, to the effect that an offer had been made to him that if he wou'id consent to retire at the expiration of the last session the petition against him should be wzithdraw1n. (A laugh.) Sir Wllliam, 'with the manly frankness whilch belonged to him, at once consulted him as to his Wishest on the subject. Now, the cost of op. posing a petition was much -greater than that of galnin a seat. arliamentary lawyrers wrould not speak in one's favour for nothirg. (A laugh.) But, considering not only the hibel cast upon himself,but the insult offered to that constituency, he bad advised his gallant colleague to resist all such overtures, and treat them with the contempt they deserved. (Cheers.) Subsequently this offer was several ties repeated, and though W/ithin three weeks of the close of the sesdion the petition still .stood low on the list the committe wfas at. length nominatefd hut no sooner wras it nominated than the petition was abandoned. He had had great difficulty in tracing the real originators of the petition. He acquitted its ostenSible authors, Mlesss Hammond and Clayton, wvhose signatures ivere a mere legal fiction like the obeolete endorsement of " John Dee andt Richard Roe" on the back of an old Writ. A t last, howfever, ho found a solution of the mystery. Tbey had all heard of Mr. Disraeli's sage prognosication about " the coming man," whose advent upon the polit-cal arena wras to. snake alli things smlooth and straight.

Averting next to the labours of the past session, Mr. Oo,borne remarked that it almost required the constitution of Old Parr and the patience of Job to go through the legislation of the dog-days, and especially of such dog-days as the last. For an official supporter of the Government th r o was no rest. He lvscall-dno-' h a t ae lthourse andh the evadn apm" to keep one. What with the lat hors nd he ad dous,and those universal geniuses wh o promoted the one and prolouged the other, who spoke on alsubjects, fatigued all listeners, and impeded all busine3ss he wvas a very lucky member of Parliament wvho could stand before his constituents at the end of the session with te hiarity and the physical strength which he no;v enjoyed. The Conservative leader in the Commnons in one of those oracular sentences of hls wfhich were more remarkable for their ornginality of conception than for the accuracy of their fulfilment, told the country that the Premier's object in the late dissolution was simply to "waste a year." How wvould that prediction bear heing tested by the results? The late session, though it lasted ohnly fhor thbree months, saw the accomplishment Of more wo*- t an hdben achieved by any former Parliament that ever sat in Westminster. Among *the measures wvhich then passed into law, most of which were far more useful than showy, wvere the reform of abuses in the Ecclesiastical Courts springing from their testamentary jurisdiction: nex;t the Fraudulent Trustces Act, and the ACT for the Winding up of Insolvent Joint-Stock Companies, oth of which w ere of first-rate imuportance to the commercial community; then the abolition of Mlinisters' Money, which, though it only applied to Ireland, hadi yeS swept awvay amore obnoxious and more irritsting injustice than even church-rates; and last in his catalogue-w;hich it would weary them to lengthen further-came the celebrated Disorco and Matrimonial Causes Bill, with the wiseanud salutary provisions, and, let him add, the great social impo,tance of which they must aldl be familiar, and the obstinate and protracted host-ility to which had not been equalled since the discussions on the Corn-laws. (Rear.) The hon. g ntlenman then glanced at the private business transacted by te Legislature, singling out for especial refererce the East }Kent 1X1 lway Bill, inwhich his constituents vere particularly mnterested. Arriving at tbe all-engrossing topic of Indian affdirs he asked,-Wisat ear does not tingle, what heart does not throb at the recital of the cruel fate of men killed, not nfair fight in defence of their country, but assassinatedl In cold blood by those whom they formerly led to victory?

Li.t us on this occasion, I pray, havo no false sentimentality -no mawkish, maudlin philanthropy. Let us have no cant about mercy to the miscreants who have not only imbrued their hands in the blood of their leaders, bus ore a satire on their kind. Some welmenn men, more remarkable for their pions imbecility than their common sonse, are now advocating increased subscriptions for missionary efforts in India. I am not one of those who deride the labounrs of the missionary, but there is a time for all things, and I think this the most inopportune of all times for arging such an appeal. Soldiers are required, not preacbers; rifles, not tracts. Not only have we an empire to preserve, but fiendish outrages to avenge-outrages per- petrated upon Englishmen and Englishwomen. (Cheors.) t is a consolation amid this wilderness of crime to turn to those bright spots where the heroism of our country. men has been so nobly displayed. Who has not read with emotion of the deeds of those gallant young officers who, deserted by all, soo7ner than abandon their posts and yield up their military stores to the rebels, put a match to the train and blew up thelr own magazines at the cost of their lives9 (Hear, hear.) The poet truly says that it is not always the greatest heroism which is shown inl It Is the detail of blank Interrals. "The patient sfferance where no ction I3 Thatproyesour naure. Manyace whoact, liut, oh. how few endure." The conduct of that young Lieutenant Willoughby, of Rayner, of Forrest, and of the soldier Scully, v'ho stood by them to the last, equals anything in classic story, and makes one proud of the name of Englhman. (Lond cheers.) What sball we say of the deeds of General Nicholson, vvho routed the Sealkot-e mutineers, and, I believe, left not a mmn of them remaining ? What of that hero of tho day, whose actions give the lie to the popular notion that old men are unfit for comnmand, I mean General avelock (loud chers), 'who irelghtdays marched146 mieos, and fought four pitch battles with the most glorious suiccess?7 And, mark you, he had to march in the month of July, under s.u Indian son, the strokes of which were more to be feared than the bullets of the tnemy. (Hear, hear.) These ane indeed heroue who might well be plaoed in an English Walhalla. (Hear, bear.) What, too, shall we say of Major Eyre, who with 200 men released six Engliahmen shut up with 40 Sikbs in Arrah, and gllantly holding out against a host of rebels,-whst bat that they are worthy of their country, and that having done their duty abroad, something remains to hu done by its at home 1 1 hope there is no man here who, however he uay differ fromn us in politics, would seek at such a moment to make political capital ont i f the naticn4al nisfortuhe; yet there are certain symptoms In the county which I must say I regret to witness I hear and read great abuse of the right hon. gentleman at the head of the Doard of Control, of whom it is thought a very good joke to say that because he bears the name of Smith he cannot be fit for his position. It is new to me that among Englithmen who are crying out that the right man is not in the right place, and that men descended from the people are not allowed to participate in the direction of the people's affairs, a man's name should be any objection to him, more especially when it is the co mmon and well-honoured name borne b th right hon. gcntleman's uncle, Sydney Smitb, sO distinguished for his writings and for his love of civil and religious liberty. I know Mr. Vernon Smith to be a man of great industry and great ability, s)td I regard these attacks upon bim as most ungenerous and unfair. Moreover, if anybody bo to blame for supposed mismanagement of Indian affairs, that blamne on ht to attach not to an individual but to the united Cabinet. Knowing Lord PaimerFton to be beyond the reach of the efforts of their ill-will, these critics judiciously select a less popular Minister as the object of their animosity. have said that we have duties to perform, and if we ought to defend a gentleman at the head of a department at home, how much more incumbent upon us is it to be chary of the reputation of men who are absent. It is a sacred obligation upon us not to ran down the character of any man serving his country at a distance, while 3mper. fectly acquxinted with the circumstances under which he acted, until he is proved to have been inefficient. I do not say that there may not have been inefficient men in India. Ilieve that there have been; but they are awaiting the award of courts-martial, and until the ver. diets of those tribunals reach this country it is prema. ture to pass any judgment upon them. And when speaking of absent men, I think we ought to give our entire confidence to Lord Canning, wbo is placed in a position so diffieclt and trying, but vwhose meaures hit erto have been at once energetc and highly judicious. Immediately on the commenoement of this outbreak he sent not only to the Cape, but to Aden, the Mauritius, China, and Ceylon for troops; and there are now either In India or on their way thither, 55 battalions of infantry, 11 regiments of cavalry, 1 troop of Horse Artillery, 3 field battemies, 5 companies of Royal Artillery (a norps that never before vsited India), and four companiesof EoyalEngineers, making a total, besides marines, of 81,000 men, who before the month of November wUl be assembled on the plains of India Now,yottwilaskWhat oyour own department, theNavy Itsohappens that thatdepatmenth snothing to do with the taking up of transports for this war; that is all included and, Ia*m happ to say, paid for-a vey material consideration, as we shall eee when the bill is brought in -by another authority. There have sailed, however, or are now,underorders,notfewerthau59tranport, and tendernfor a great many more have been sent in. I hope, therefore, we shall soon hear that an end has been put to this monstrous conspiracy. I for one shall not be satisfied until I bear that Delhi, on which I look as the modern Gomorrab, bas been razed to the ground. The punishment, I think, I should be commenurate with the crime. Sure I am that as long as one stone of that city is left upon another, so long wl the Hindoo and the Mahomedan point to the spot where Miss Jennings was cut to pieces ainid the fien&h exultation of brutat and bigoted Alosati.s Being only a subordijnate memberof the Government, I speak without authority, but I shre vdly sumpeot that if you wish to preserve India you must be prepared to pay for it. I am sure you wonld no. think for a moment of weighing pounds, shillings, and pence in the scale against the prestige of the British name and the claims of outraged humanity. So much for the past. It i much more dtfflclt to spcak of the future, because with such horrors ringing in our ears it is impossible to maintain the requisite calmness and moderation.There is a large party in this country who are desirous of doing away at onco with the power of the East India Company. I have not now the evidence that would enable me to discuss that question, but I know that some of the greatest men both In civil and military life bave been produced under the auspices of that body, as witness Zlphinstone and Malcolm, Colvtn and the Lawrences, and many others. I wish, however, to say a word or two upon the Bengal army. I have long made this subject my study, and so far from feeling any surprise at what has happened, I am only surprised that this mutiny did not break out before. We have had frequent warnings as to the state of that army, but, alas ! though forewarned we bave not been forearmed. We have a population of 180,000,000 in India, from whom we raised an army of 300,000 men, made up partly of Hindoos, partly of Mahomeians, and only onesixth of Earopeans. With a force so composed it is apparent we must all along have been sitting on a barrel of gunpowder. The Bengal army was never askcdto marcah on any great expedition but It mutinied for double allowance. Ths was not the exception but the rule. The double allowance was always 'oncedod, and then, bat not till then, they marched. (A leugh.) With the origin of the word 'Sepoy" you are, we'bably, all acquainted ; but, perhaps, you are not aware that wo copied the embodiment of the Sepoy regiments from the French, who are said always to introduce a thing first, John Bul afterwards improvin! upon it. The improvement in this case, I regret to say, has not been very apparent. (A laugh.) This systsm existed under the French in 1746 at Caddalore. Clivo adopted their idea; but in his time the regimnents were officered to a considerable extent by native chiefs and gertlemen, who, in those days fought most efficiently. Great changes have since then been introduced,-changes, Quhappily, not for the better. Formerly the Etropsan officers were obliged to know the langnages of their men, and were all selected, not only for their abilty, but also for their acquaintance with Eastern character. In 1796 more Europeans were allotted to each native regiment, and the principle of selection was done away with. So many nevv officers were required that commands were given to lads fresh from school,and totaUyignorantof the nativelanguages. What was the consequenee ? That the native officer who till then had been a leading man in his regiment, and had conducted himself with propriety and honour, became disgusted. Gradually your army was altogether deserted by the native gentlemen-for you must not imagine that a gentleman is to be found in England only. (A laugh.) Geutlemen descended from the nobility that flourished under the Mahomedan regime, and who were formerly a most important element in your army, would no I longer take servico in it. And it would have bean strange if they had; because no matter how able or distinguished an old native officer might' have been, immediately a young stripling with a white face made his appearance he took charge of the battalion, and the native officer had to give place. The great mistake then was that 'while so large a number of European officers were consigned to each regiment, von still retained the native commissioned officers. The old nPlive officer was an edrcated man, who could keep the accounts of his regiment; whereas his modern representative Is perhaps one of the most ignorant men in India, being very seldon able to read, and still more seldom able to write. The result is, he has very little influence over his men i he never gives any information, and cannot repress a mutiny. Moreover, he knew that if ho reached a certain period of hfe in your service, according to the principle of seniority which obtained in the Bengal army, he would become an officer at 60. He would, therefore, remain in his corps till then, merely to obtain his pension and retire. The great error, I repeat, was that you ever kept native ofEcers at aU after the European element was so largely infused into the service. This is a ^.^int to which the Government will have to turu its attentton when it comes to deal with the reconstructioD of the native army. There is anowher matter well worthy of eonsideration in connexion with this subject. I refer to the coxAparative number of officers in English and in Sepoy regiments. Lot me take by way of ilustration the 25th Regiment, called "the Borderers." They are 1,000 strong, and their complement of offiesrs is 36, besides the staff, including the lieutenant-colonel, quartermaster, surgeon, and field-officers. This numbsr are generally present with their corps, and always on service. WVith the Sepoy regiment, howeier, the case is different. There the complemint of officers, including the staff, is 26 for 1,000 men. You may think this a very fair number, but the fact is that on an average more than 15, and those not the elitc, are never present with their reeiment, giving only one officer to 93 men. I ask, in such a state of things, how can you expect a regiment to bo kept in proper discipline, and to look up to its leaders 7 Every man who is master of the language and who wishes to distinguish himself regards regimental duty as irksome, and always looks for staff employment. Such employment he is sure to obtain, and tha regimentis. thus left in the hands of men of much lecs ability, who sometimes cannot so much as givn th- ord of command in anything but Einglish, who have no knowledge of or sympathy with the feehin's of their men, and who unhappily have the bad tste to call them niggers and indulge in those jokes at their expense t which young officers are prone. Thisthenisadefectvosysm, which ought to be reformed, Again, a vicious rule exists anro reritn _ 1teBeglary o aeaar-ht in the recrmWtig of the Bengal army: _You a-re a_waro ths~t in India there is sach a thing as caste. Indeed, we have a little of it at home, where people both In the religious and lin the political world look down upon their neighbounrs as if they were inferior beings. Snch men are the European Brahmins (a laugh), but they are not at all to be compared to the Asiatic Brabmin who belongs to the priestly order, and to whom everything and everybody is subservient, For that matter, according to the Hindoo mythology, instead of the Brahmins paying court to the Gods, the Gods are eupposed to pay court to the Brahmtns, (A laugh.) Nevertheless, our pehlic has been to enlist the Brahmins In the proportion m some cases of as many as 600 to 1,000. They are indifferent soldiers but clever intriguera; they contrive to keep the other men in subjection to them and subservient to their interests, and have in a manner established a code which treats a regimental ofienco as venial, and an offence against caste as unpardonable. They happen to be taller than the other men, and are marvellously proper in appearance; but they are not the men who fought your earlier battles in India. It was not such men who won the victories of Coote and Clive. Their armies, on the contrary, were composed of men of mixed caste, including even Pariahs; men who did good and faithful service, men who founded the reputation of bhe great Dake of Wellington, and overthrew the hosts of the fierce Tippoo Sahib. (Cheers.) You must therefore revise your recruiting system. Bat this is not all. It Is not enough to have your native troops well formed and well offioered; jou must take care that they are not commanded by effete and worn-out leaders; and to accomplish this object a compulsory system of superannuation is absolutely necessary. History showsthat almost every great action has been won by young generals. Napoleon was only 25 when he conducted his great Italiau campaigns, and the illustrions Wellington was only 40 when he conclnded his active military career, If you had had a young officer in command at Meerut I beUevo you would hav4;had this insurrection crushed in the bud, and had Colonel Gillepie, who promptly Cut down the disaffected soldiery %Vdlore gad saved an empire, been an aged decrepit offioer, I have no doubt that an exensvle Inutiny like the present would hawv broken ou at a mnuch f *rlier period (Hear, hear.) Bnt it In not in the mangeMentof tbe ntive army alone that mistakes have been made. Errors have also been committed In your mode of governing India. Like true John BolLs yoU have been guided solel by your own notions and ideas without regrd to thei adaptability to the Aiatic temperament. You forgot that those men have as conwcientious an objec. tion to using the fat of the cow as many of my friends here have to another animal (laughter); and although, no doubt, the greased cartridge affair was a mere pretext, till a large body of Sepoys really supposed that their caste was to be taken asway, and Christianity to be forced upon them at the pointof the bayonet The train was laid by Jahomodan ra and cunning, nd fired by the mingled fanaticism and ferocity of the Eindoo. Another mistAke was mado when, in 1835, a great Indian statesman gave unlimited freedom to the native press. I have always entertained a great re ?pect for the press. Its oonductors are our masters-bane. cent masters, too. If we lose a good deal on the one hand, we gain much on the other, in the shace of public liberty, by their freedom from offidial oensorship Tut to vraft upon an Asiatic constitution tlunrextricted freedom of the pres wasa certainly one of the maddest schemes that ever entered the mind of any ruler. The consequences of that measure were foreseen and foretold by a great Indian ad. ministrator-Sir Thomas Munro-who, although favourable to native participation in the government, nevertheleas put on record a minute in which he warned us that a native free press would undermine the discipline and subvert the allegiance of the Sepoy. Another matter in which we have been going too fst is our imprudent Interference with Hindoo cUtoms. It would have been a trifling matter for us to abstain from meddling with a Hindoo woman's inability to remarry. Indeed, it is not an uncommon thing for an English widow to regret her not having lived under a similar restriction (laughter; and, theref ore, there could have been no great harm in lowing the Asiatic relict to lire in sigle blessedness upon her happy recollection of her defunct Hlndoo (Loud aughter But we must needs pass ala opposed to all the cherished prejudices and prepossessions of Orientals. It was all very we to put down suttee and other inhuman riteand orgies. Akhbar himself one of the gratest of Mahomedan Sovereigns, was known to be hosti-e to the immolation of a woman on her husband's funeral pile; but in regard to compulsory celibacy the game was not worth its cost. Why persist in a course of petty Interference which can only serve to exaperate and envenom our subjects'l Another custom which the East India Company swept away was that of adoption; and it is said that the atrocities of that misreant of miscreants, Nena Sahib, were prompted by personal resentment for the loss he suffered under the operation of this change. He was left the adopted heir of the Pelshwa, but the Company stepped In and deprivod him of the pension ho claimed as inheriting from that prince. The Company left the rasc guns and an embattled fortress, and these very guns he used a aiust our:unfortunate countrymen at Cawopore. If they dlid the thing at all. they ought to have done it thoroughly. But there iS one policy which, In my opinion, was above all others most unwise, imprudent, and detrimental to the interesis of this country. I speak of the policy of annoxation. You know that when we first went to India we went as aimple traders. A hundred years ago all the trritory we had in Indla was a few factorie on tue Malabar and Coromandel coasts, and In Bengal, amountlng to not more than 5 000 square miles. The great Burke in his reflections on the French Revolution iu 1793 gave a solemn warning in his celebrated paage agaunst the ambition of Great Britain. He says, "I dr that you should be too much dreaded," and the remarkable words which be adds are, " Our empire in India is an awful thing." I have told you what that empire was in 1757; what was it in 1793 in the time of Lord Corawallis's settlement? It amounted to 200,000 square miles, with a population acknowledging British away of 40,000,000. What would Burke have said had he lived to see that empire in 1857 ? The 200,000 square miles under the policy of annexation have xlweled to 7,000,000 with a population of 180,000,000. That, indeed, is an awfud empire, and ought not to be governed on a narrow and contracted basis, still less on the principles of forcin1 European notions upon Asiatic Institutions. (Cheers.) ihave said that our countrymen have done their duty nobly abroad; it remains for us to do ours as nobly at home. (Cheers.) The sympathy and approbation of his countrymen cheer and sustain the absent soldier, who in the hour of danger encourages his comrades by telling them, " They wll talk of us in England this day." (Cheers.) We are bonnd to render them our best assLstance, and when pecuniary aid is reluired we should give it, not grudgingly, but generouLsly, and with an open hand. (Hear, hear.) Lot me now turn to one or two topics of more domestio interest. On the subject of education it has occurred to me that we are posslbly going a little too fa The competitive system with regard to entrance Into the public service ought not to be forced on too rapidly, but should be applied gradu. ally, with due discrimination, and also, give me leave to add, with good sense. People often come to me and say that they want situations as cerks, or as tide-waiters, but that they are asked to undergo an examination, through which if they could succeesfully pass they should feel themselves qualified to fill the office and entitled to the emoluments of a Prime Minister. (Laughter.) I think this complaint is to some extent justified. Iam opposed to a compulsory rate for the education of the people, which ought, in my opuinon, to be supported by voluntary efforts. At the eAme time, if my constituents should be particularly enamoured of an educational impost I don't know that I should obstinately refuse to indulge them on the point. (A laugh.) Another question. which I have no wish to blink, is that of a further reform of Parliament. I first appeared before you as the advocate of such a measure, and I am stil prepared to advosate it. But, if we are to have another Reform Bill, I do regret that there is one eminent public man who, whatever may have been his politil backslidings, is yet; fine specimen of the English gentleman and tho English Liberal, and whose name is indissolubly intertwined with the brightest triumphs of the Liberal canse-I regret tha Lord John Russell (eheers) is not a member of the present Government. He is far too useful a man to be consigned to the dreary shade of a back bench. (RXear, hear.) Lord Derby, wiith that wit and eloquence which so pre-eminently iistinguish him, once described the Go. vernment of Lord Palmerston as consisting of Lord Palmerston alone. Of course the Conservative loader did notcondescend to notice so insignificant an individual as myself. (y laugh.) I have not the honour of a seat in the Cabinet-, am ntot highly enough coulnected f or that-I am not a Brahmin. (Laughter.) But the noble earl spoke of Lord Palmerston and his appendages. There may, indeed, be some instances in v,hice appendages are not wholly worthlessm The key which winds up the watch is an ap. pendage. Bet that is neither here nor there. Lord Derby wiished to ridicule the Ministry, and therefore could not take small matters into account. I maintain, however, that a Government composed as is the present Government, with that essential element, community of sentiment and unity of action, can be much more safely depeuded upon at a crisis than a Cabinet made up of orators. You will recall the poet's words- Who rewons Vse Is not therefore vise: Hi;s pride in reazovin%, not in r Aing, lita.' (Hear, hear. ) What has been our experience of former A d- ministrations-Administrations comprising many of the greatest historic names ? There was the Cabinet of " All the talents." Tnat could hardly be called a Cabinet of appendages. Then there was the Aberdeen Cabinet, under ,hich I myself first took office. Was there ever a Cabinet stuffed so full of plums? (A laugh.) I scpeak with the highest respect for Lord Aberdeen-a truo and honest Reformer, who has I believebeen much misundel-tood-and I have an equal respect for many of his colleagues. Neverthele2s, they were weak in spite of their great oratorical strength, they were not bound together by community of sentiment. A lady of distinction once gave a handsome entertainment to a brilliant assemblage of ambassadors, historians, poets, and philosophers, and the affair having gene off very dnuly, and proved in fact an utter failure, in her natural disappointment she next day asked Tom Moore, -who had been one of her guests, why it was that her party had been so satapid. That gentleman at once replied, " Oh ! the reason is evident; you had too much quince in your apple-pie." (A laugh.) So with the previous Ministries to which I have referred-they had too much quince in their Cabinet pudding. (Laughter and cheers.) I am convinced, gentlemen, that it is much better for the interests of the empire to have a man like Lord Palmerston at the hcad of the Government, supported by a Cabinet of men remarkable at least for industry, if not so wwel known to the public as their distinguished chief, than it wrould he to havo a Cabiuet of mere rSetoricans. Rhetoricians rwill not pull you through an Indian crisis. Energy is the quality most needed to cope with so critical an emergency. (Rear, hear.) Whether it was a wise thing to move our army upon Delhi and keep it there, without Attempting to take the place by a coup dc main, I am not sufficently versed in military strategy to pronounce. That city is strongly fortified has a large garrson and a mixed population of Hindoos and Mahoinedans numbering 150,000 souls, and the succe-s of an attack by so smaU a European force as our commanders have yet been able to collect there might have been very problematicaL But even if it should be deemed expedient to withdraw our troops now before Delhi to Agrs, the nation must not be discouraged. We ought neither to be elated by partial success nor disheartened by wuat may seem to be a temporary check to our progreai Remember, if we do retreat it wll only be to get a greater spring. (Hear, hear.) That we shall finally vanquish I have no maner of doubt. (Cheer.) Tho great Burke, whom I have already quoted, says, " A man of cure speculative benevolence may wish the frame of the society in wrhich he lives to be differently constituted; but a good patriot and a good politician wil endeavour to mak-o the best of the existing materials. The disposition to preserve and tho ability to improve would be my standard of a wise and truo statesman." Lord Palmerston in my opinion, comes up to that de6nition; and I tbih; the nation feols confident that he will bhmg this miserable Indian revolt to the same happy termination as that to which it was his good fortune to bring the late war with Russia. [The hon. gentleman, after apologizing for the great length at which he had tresassed on the patience of his audience, rosumod his seat amid voclferous and prolonged applause.] The remainder of the proceedings was enlvened by a lively passage of arms between the hon. member for Sandwich and the Secretary of the Admiralty. Mr. HuoRS&Ex, in responding for the " Helth of the Liberal Members for tho County, described himself as one who had scen through the error of the Conservativo principles and traditions in which he had been reared, and who had renounced the Tory party at the risk of a rupture of family ties. Avowing himself a follower of the band of Liberal members who sit on the back Ministerial benches and acknowledge the leadership of Lord J. Russell, he said that the men with whom he acted were resolved to assume a calm, wise, but firm attitude on the question of Parliamentary reform. He then animadverted on what he regrded as tho tone of official reserve on the last-named subject, and on several other points in which the Liberal party were deeply interestedt which had characterized the able and eloquent address of has hon. friend, remarking that it bad smack-ed too much ef red.tapeism. Mr. OsBOnss rejoined with a vivacious retort upon his assailant.

JACOB'S ROBJSE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is now upwards of three years since I first attempted to impress upon the Horse Guards the necessity and economiy of adding a few regiments of really light cavalry to the British army. Every military man to whom I spoke in private agreed with me that such a species of force was much wanted; Lieutenant-General Sir John Burgoyiie stated before the Sebastopol Committee that it would have been most useful during the Russian war, and the late Sir Charles James Napier has over and over again recorded his opinion of the inutility of our present cavalry, overweighted as they are, especially for service in India. Our military anthorities would not allow themselves to be stimulated on such a point by a civilian -they contented themselves with telling the public that a board of most experienced cavalry officers was ritting in Whitehall to consider whether any and what improvements could be made in the accoutrements and armament of our cavalry; probably they are sitting in Whitehall still. But, in spite of their protracted session, the British cavalry lorse staggers in 1837 umder precisely the same weight as he staggered under in 1854-about nineteen stone; when he carries his own forage he carries about two-andtwenty stone. As soon as peace was proclaimned I ceased writing on the subject, knowing that I had no influence save that conferred by common sense and a good knowledge of the powers of the horse, and knowing also that common sense in peace time has very little to do with the administration of our army; but now that war has broken out again in its most critical and fearful phase, and that we have been deprived by mutiny of the services of both the Regular and Irregular Horse of Bengal, I cannot refragn from again trying my persuasive powers on the AIinister of War. In a leter which was published last week from an officer attached to General flavelock's force the following passage occurs: - " The activity displayed by the enemy's horsemen in thls action was very remarkable. They moved round our force, menacing us at different points with extraordinary rapidity, and, in so far as mancenvring in the field went this cavalry was perfect. Now, I wish to draw particular attention tothis fact, because these very men were our own regular troopers, mounted on our own regular cavalry horse3, but armed and equipped af ter their own, instead of after the regular cavalry, fashion. The regular Beugal cavalhy, equipped and overloaded with their accoutrements, have never been of any particular use in the army hitherto, but this shows what they might be made under a better system." Another letter, which I read a few days since, mentioned the execution done by one single shot fired by the mutineers from Delhi. It destroyed eight men, "smashing the brass htelmets of two privates of the Carabineers, corered withi thick linen casings," the thermometer being at 120 in the shade. And a third letter which I saw yesterday from an officer with the force before Delhi deplores "that the weight of the Carabineers and their accoutrements renders them almost useless as cavalry." Under these circumstances, Sir, I venture once more to lift up my voice in favour of organizing in this country some really light cavalry for service in India. We have now many first-rate officers of Indian Irregulars unemployed, the regiments having either revolted or been disarmed. They know exactly the capabilities of the Indian horses; they know the size and weight of the men who would be most effective at the present crisis ; they know the dress and arms which would suit them best. Small men, such as they would select, are not accepted by the recruiting sergeants, and they are precisely the men who in this country are moat accustomed to horses and riding-for no gentleman in his senses will allow a groom, postilion, or whip of six feet high to enter his stable. I again ask, therefore, would it not be advisable to organize half-a-dozen such regiments without further delay ? Had we done so, as I suggested, during the Russian war, instead of squandering our money on Bashi-Bazouks and such like vermin, we should have had something to show for our money now. The only argument I have ever heard against the organization of auch a force is a very bad one ; but, bad as it is when applied to war in Europe, it fails altogether when applied to war in India. The late Commander-in-Chief explained to the Sebastopol Committee that, as England rmaintained but a small cavalry force, it was necessary for our national honour that it should be of such a calibre as to be competent to meet and overthrow the heaviest cavalry of the European Powers. Such an argument, applied to the navy, would forbid us to build gunboats and frigates, because they could not cope with the three-deckers of our enemies. In India, however, there is no heavy cavalry, except our own, while there is abundance of light cavalry of first-rate quality arrayed against us. Why not order General John Jacob, if he cannot be spared from the seat of war himself, to send us over a couple of his most competent lieutenanta, and allow them to try their hands in this country in organizing forthwith a white brigade of Jacob's Horse ? The very name would carry weight with it. Your obedient servPn+ J. 0.
TO THE EDITOR OE THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit me to remark to you in reference to your observations of to-day, that we have only to revert to the I eriod when the first Napoleon threatened to invade thWs co intry for an example of the spirit with which the people of every class responded to the call for her defence; and the 10,000 London volunteers who were reviewed by the Dake of York on Blackheath in 1804 were only a sample of the armed multitudes who were organized in the three kingdoms balf a century ago to repel the invader. We have arrived at another crisis in which the greater resources at our command in men and money are likely to be as severely tasked, from the distance at which we are called on to make war for the recovery of the empire which we had acquired in the East, and to bring such a war to a prosperous issue we anst become as great a miUtary as we are a naval Power. On the subject of volunteer corps, I would suggest that it Would be a useful service if some of the enterprislng gentlemen who make yachting an amasement would imitate Sir James Brooke and arm and equip vess0ls propelled by steam and mauned by volunteers for the navigation of the great rivers of Indla,-the Ganges and Indus in particular,assisting to keep open the comzaunications, to restore order, and to rescue our helpless countrymen and coantrywomen escaping from remote and insulated stations. Let them dispel the idea that the climate at all seasons would be otherwise thau favourable to men actively employed and temperate in their habits. The arduous pUot service from Calcatta to the "Sandheada' is in the hands of hardy Englishmen, and it may be enough to say that no race of Indians are competent to engage in it, although the pilotage of the Euphrates is in the hands of the Arabs, who are equally bold and faithfuL I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

MUTINY IN IY"DIA.-TEB RELIEF FUND. NEWCASTLE-ON.TYNE. a. puoclc meeting ot the inhabitants of Newcastle-on. Tyne, convened by requisition to the Mlayor, was held in the Guldhall of that town on Thursday, for the purpose of originating a subsoription on behalf of the sufferers by the mutiny in India. The Mayor presided. ana among the company were btr. Headlam, M.P., Mr. Ridley, . P., Lse Compte de Maricourt, the French Consul, the Sneriff, Sir John Fifo, Captain Blackett, R.N., several i, embers of the Town council and gentlemen connected with the coal trade, and various of the clergy and Dissenting ministers. The MAYOR, having read several letters from gentlemen belongin:i to the neighbourhood expressive of sy uipathy with the movement, caUed upon Mr. Headlam to propo-e the first resolution. Mr. HEADLAM said,-We are met here to-day for the purpose of performing a most serious and soleiimn duty,-viz,, that of expressing on behalf of the people of this great town and the surrounding neighbdurhood their deep, their heartfelt sympathy in the unexampled suffering. with which it has p'eased Providence to afflict our fellow eountrymen and countrywomen in India. The hon. gentleman here read the first resolution, which, with the others. are sim ilar to those adopted in other large towns. He then proceeded,Gentlemen, it would not be my wish to harrow your feelings by dwvelling upon the painful details of the atrocities which have en perpetrated. You have aU read in the newspapors tales of horrors unexampled almost in the history of the world. Many ainong you probably have to regret the loss of sonme friend or acquaint. ance who has perished in these troubles, and perhaps yon are suffering still more from the anxiety and susptnse which necessarily at tend upon those who have friends still surviving in that unhappy land. Moreover, we well know that the Government in lndia must be atraitered in its powers to meet tbe public necessities, and that, however great may be their desire, they have no immediate power to relieve the necessities of private individuals. So general and universal is the calamity that those who have partially escaped in India will be but little able to assist those who are suffering around them. There is,then, if ever there was, a clearcase for assistance and active aid from this country; and I feel that I am not appealing in vain to the symnpathies of the people of Newcastle when I ask them to uni-e with the country to redress this great national calamity .(Applause.) The time must come, and that before long, when an earnest and anxious inquiry must be made by the Government of this country into the causes of this great calamity (hear, hear); and, moreover, there must he the fullest and most ample and earnest consideration as to the means by which we moust hereafter conduct the Government of .that great country committed to our charge. (Applause.) I think I Ehall not inadequately express the feelings and sentiments of the people of Newcastle when I say that, in the fist instance at any rate, this mutiny and rebellion must be stamped out and crushed from the face of the earth, and that no effort shall be wanting on the part of the Government, no assistance denied on the part of the people to strengthen their hands, for the purpose of supporting that great and gallant army which has left these shores for the purpose of vindicating the name, the honour, and the glory of this country. (Loud applause. We must recollect that we have accepted this government of India; that we have gloried in it, that we have considered it as the brightest jewel in the crown of Eler present Majesty; that we have accepted the wealth, the power, the honour, and position which the Government of ndia confers8en this8country; and it is not for us, in the time of emergency, when the crisis has arrived, to flinch from the responsibities which such greatness brings with It. When this rebellion has been crushed we must then undertake the government of that country with somewhat of a sterner spirit and a firmer hand; and we must vindicate by our example and the form of our government those great principles of Christianity ("hear, hear," and loud applause) upon which society is based. Sir J. FIFE seconded the resolution. Le Comte de ALIRICOURT (Frenoh Consul), who was received with cheers, said,-Mr. Ma3or and gentlemen, as the representative of France, sent among you by the Emperorof the French, I cannot but sympathize deeply with you on account of the atrocities which have been perpetrated recently in India, and from which many of your families are now suffering, (Applause.) I may thank your worthy Mayor for having understood this feeling, and for having favoured my wish to be as one of yourselves at this meeting. Moreover, gentlemen, last year, about the same period, in this very room, another meeting was taking place. I cannot-no, I never can forget it. It was for the relief of the disasters which it had pleased Almighty God to inflict on many of our provinces. I repeat that I never can forget your generous sympathy on that occasion for our poor sufferers, nor can I forget that in this noble to wn of Newcastle the first symptom hurst forth of that magnificent impulqe which afterwards produced millions, and so powerfully contributed to the relief of my poor countrymen. (Applause.) Permit me, then, to return, feebly perhaps, but with a heart full of sympathy for your distress, some of the kind feelings which under similar unhappy circumstances you showedtowards France. (Loud applause.) My contribution to the fund may be small, but it is the expression of the deep sympathy and goodwill of a kindred people who are always ready to rejoice with you in a common triumph (loud applause), and to mourn with you in a common sorrow. (Great applause.) The resolution was carried unanimously. Mr. RIDLEY proposed the second resolution. The hon. gentleman, having briefly alluded to the atrocities committed by the Sepoys, went on to say that the first duty of the Government-to bring again into subjection the rebellious districts-would be adequately performed. The Rev. H. W. WIIG.UT seconded the resolution, and urged that the best kind of revenge upon the mutineers would be-not by compulsion, but by the mild spirit of the Gospel-to give them Christianity, which would prevent a reetition of the calamities which they all deplored. Dr. DAVIES moved the " nomination of a committee to receive subscri tions,"' and reminded the meeting of the words of Holy rit, " Vengeance is mine; I wil repay, saith the Lord ;" and declared that though the soldier bore the sword he bore it for punishment, under the hand of Providence, and not for vengeance. Mr. R. PLuMS.MERbriefly secondedthe motion, which was carried unanimously. READING. An influentiali meeting in aid of the fund now being raised in the country for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian mutiny was held yesterday in this town. The Mayor (Mr. T. Harris) presided, and there were presentSir H. S. Keating, M.P., the Solicitor-General, Mr. F. Pigott, M.P., Rev. W. Yates, Dr. Wells, Dr. Cowan, Rev. W. Legg, Rev. W. Phelps, Colonel Bazett, some members of the town-council, repiesentatives of large firms, and respectable inhabitants. The MAYOR stated that Immediately upon receiving a letter from the Lord Mayor of London, soliciting co-operation in the movement for raising a fund to relieve tho necessities of our countrymen and countrywomen occasioned by the fearful mutinies in Jndia, he opened subscription listsat the banks in the town, and up to the present time a sum of about 220. had been subscribed. (Cheers.) Nothing thathadever before occurred in the history of this countrycalled so much for commiseration and sympathy, and it was bis earnest hope that the result of the meeting would be largely to augment the faund which had been wisely and generously set on foot by the Lord Mayor of London. The Itev. S. W. YATES said, if he rightly understood the oject for which they came together, it was not to discuss Indian affairs, not to enter into the large question whether the present or any former Government had grossly misgoverned the country; it was not for them to inquire whether the Sepoys had had too much or too little deference paid to their religion-all these were matters which must come before Parliament, and be settled in a manner satisfactory to the country. In the whole course of his life, now between 60 and 70 years, he never recollected anything equalling in cruelty and atrocity the recent events in India. They must look upon this as a visitation from Heaven. This mutiny or outbreak among the Sepoys could not have taken place without the perfect knowledge, he must say even the will, of Heaven. There was something wrong in the sight of Heaven. He would suggest to his fellow-townsmen to keep this thought in remembrance, and do what Christians should do when they thought they were viBited by God for some wrong done in the sight of Heaven. He rejoiced to think that there would be a day of humiliation, when this view of the question would be nmore strongly brought out before the public iu the several places of worship. The principal object for which the meeting had been called was to render al the assistance they could to their fellow-sufferers in India. This meeting, as ho understood it, was also to be an expression of strong feeling of disgust, abhorrence, and detestation at what bad taken place in Indi.. (Hear, hear.) The feeling which rose up in one's mind in reading from day to day in The Timea newspaper the fearful accounts of atrocities perpetrated upon our own countrymen was that which made one wish that we had here every Mahomedan,that we might wring off tbeir necks. That was the sort of feeling, he thought, most of them had. (Cheers.) And there was another feeling, that they were determined to do all they could to render assistance to the Government of the day when they were called upon to redress these wrongs and to repress this mutiny. (Cheersm) There was a feeling that a disgrace and dishonour had been done to this country, and they longed to have it wiped oat ; they longed to have these wrongs done to our countrymen and countrywomen redressed, and that those evil-minded menu-those brutes who had Bignalled their treaeheroua succes by tbe mnost frightful enormities, such unheard-cf cruelties, such inhumanities, as really to find no parallel in history, should be visited, not 'with a bitter revenge, but with a feeling of righteous judg. ment. (Cheers) Then, again, they were called upon t show their sympathy for the sufferers by these mutinies, and he waS happy to observe that a course had been taken which would sbowv to the world, to the European continent, and everywhere, that England was determnmed to strain every nerve to put things right again in India. (Cheers) This was no party question. Politics had nothing to do with it. It was a simple and single desire to see our wrongs in India righted, and when distress and privation occurred to show that there was a feeling in England of sympathy for the sufferers, and as far as money could afford consolation, that none should be wanting. (Elear, hear.) With such views and feelings he moved the resolution:- That this meeting. syumpathizing with our fellow- oouttmen in theutterdestltuton towhich many of tbem hsve been reducedby Sba late mutinies in India, feels called up'n to d recd lb pub sense of tSMscalamity and Its abhorrence of the hearties crtueltie inflcted by the mutinous army upon helpless women aLd children and our Un. armed fellow-subjects in the East, ani trusts that thectrenuous efforts now being made by the BritIh Government and tbe Fast India eompany for the suppresalon of the rebeillon and ponibhment of the gaity way, by the Dlvine blessing. be speedily crowned witb succew." The Rev. W. LEGG, a Dissenter, seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. Dr. CowAN concurred in the opinion previouslyexpressed that it was not for that meeting to discuss the cause of the rebellon, but to unite in one common utterance of deep commiseration with the sufferings of our fellowr-subjects inx India, and to express nationally their uncited determinatloit to support all measures which might be thought neceessar for the vnNdication of the rights of our common humaIty. He moved,- "That this meeting, with a view to giving practical effect Wo thig PPprOn of empath, rQeJcTs3 that a subIpte lU6t be oped iX I id of the fund promoted by the Lord Mayor of Lond,n, and that the Mayor be requese to set as treasurer." The resolution was seconded by the Rev. W. PEILPS, and carried. Air. PIaoTT, M.P., moved a vote of thanks to the Mayor for calling the meeting and taking the chair, and said, from the feeling manffested, he should, i7hen tho House of Com. mons again assembled, feel justified in saying it was the desire of the borough of R-eading that nothing should be with. held from Her Majesty's Government that was calculated to put down by the strongest arm this rebellion in India, (Loud cheers.) The SoLIcTioR-GZXRAL, In eeconding the vote of thanks to the Mayor, said be might be allowed to express the great satisfaction he felt at being permitted and enabled to be present on an occasion so gratifying, because, although it was true tho cause of their meeting was one of sorrow, of anguish, and of lamentation, yet it was not altogether without its consolations. It had avowed a principle throughout the length and breadth of this land which coincided with that character that England had always maintained,-a feeling of sympathy with those who had suffered, and of a determina. tionthatjusticeshouldbedone andright prevail. (Applause.) It was thoughtful and kind of those who had arranged the meeting so to arrange it that the moving and seconding of the resolutions should devolve upon them. seves; but it was still more useful, becanse it was a local expression of feeling that was desirable on such occasions. It was not what gentlemen who sat in St. Stephen's, and were sent toParliament for political objects-it was not what they individually thought or feltupon this great occasion, but an expression of deep loyal feeling cxsting in this town upon an occasion like the present. They could not but aid and assist in settling matters which had been made so wrong. (Applause.) To dwel upon the scenes that had taken place no man could trust himself - they were felt, they were appreciated in England, though they were not embodied in ourselves, and upon this occasion, and upon all other occasions, the public feeling of this country was one that bad done it credit in the midst of.calamity, and had tended to elevate England among the nations of the world. (Applause.) He abstained from goin in the selightest degree into the object of this meeting- he felt cur tain the object would be cordially co-operated in by the town. (Applause.) Many additional subscriptions wereoannounced, and when the meeting terminated a sum of nearly 300. had been rsed.ii the Solicito rGeneralgave a sutbscription of 51. in Colonel Bazett, 201.; Barrett and Co., 301., &c. DORCEHESTER. The first collection of notices left, in accordance 'with a resolution passed at the recent public meeting held here, at the houses of the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood was made yesterday (Friday), and the sum of 2001. was eubscribed, which will be at once forwarded to the Central Committee in London. The distribution of the amounts subscribed is as follows :-Trinity district East Fordington, 221. 7se 6d. 5W9estFodSinton t919 39- Id.- Charminster and Stratton, 191. 5g 7d. ; Bradford PeverelD, 61. 5s. 6d ; Godmanstown, 31. 6s. ; Martinstown and Win terborne Steepleton, 121. Is. Gd. BRIDGNORTE. Yesterday a highls influential meetig, convened by the Mayor (Mr. T. Nook), was held in the Guildhall, for the purpose of contributing to the funds now being raised for. the sufferers in India. Mr. Alderman Richards presided. The CHAIRMAN apologized for the absence Gf the Mayor and Archdeacon Waring, both of whom felt ihe liveliest interest in the object of the meeting, and had forwarded very handsome contributions to the subscription list. I was evident, from the meetings rccorded by the public press, that persons of all classes were anxious to devote a portion of their substance towards an object so praise. worthy. Mr. W. Wr o=x proposed- "Tsat this meeting desires to express Its deep andheardelt sympathy with the sufferings and losses whichbara befllen oar Sallow-countrymen and women In India. aid to resord its abhorrence of tbfe eSreswhimch have been committed by the treacher; and cruelty He rejoiced heartily that the present meeting had been called, and he trusted that Brldgenorth would not be backward in evincing its deep sympathy with those who had suffered by uch frghtful atroCities as had lately been committed in India. The Rev. W. I. MARSALL seconded the resolution which was carried. A subscription was entered into, and 1001. was collected at the meetin NEWPORT (ISLE OF WIGHT). A meeting to express sympathy with the sufferers by the rmuttiny in India was held at ewport on Wednesday, Mr. W. B. Heir, mayor, in the chair. It was moved by the Rev. E. M'ALL, rector of Brightstone, and rural dean, seconded by Dr. WAVELL, J.P., SUpported by Lieutenant-Colonel JXFFRtys, C.B., aud resolved- *That this meetlng,deeply sympathizing with the sufferers (many of w/hom are reduced to a Estae of sum p let destitauton) by tbe mutinies in India, eOseiroltes to recrdIspbtlioc sensie of this calamity, and lts of th;~~~~~~~~~t aboreneo tUyhe itrocitiesand crueslties cromme ith edeby terblar cmy A committee was then appointed to obtain subscriptions. RAMSGATE Yesterday, pursuant to a requisition, the Deputy of Rams' gate called a public meeting of his fellow-townsmen to devise means of relief for those who have suffered by the recent disasters in India. The Deputy was called to the chair, in which he was supported by Messr. A Crofton, J. O. Bur- eMs, Small, S. Sharwood, Rev. R. Hlarvey (vicar), Rev'. H. Davies, Rev. - Phillips (Wesleyan Minister), T. H. G. Snowden, &c. The DEPUTY detailed the wrongs and sufferings of our brave countrymen In India, and invoked the sympathy and aid of his fellow-townsmen in behalf of the wives, widows, and families of those brave defenders, and resolutions were passed unanimously in behalf of the same, and a committee formed to obtain the contributions of those willing to render them. TUNBRIDGE-WBLLS. A few days since a number of gentlemen, including several ministers of the established church and Dissenting bodies in the town, assembled at the house of the Rev. W. L. Pope, who took the chair on that occasion, to deliberate upon the measures which they should adopt for affording peunmary relef to the widows and orphans of those who had fallen in India. A committee was appointed. Since the appointment of this committee above 1801. has been reeeived by the secretary, which includes 601. collected after a sermon given by the Rev. S. Langston, MLA., at Trinity Church. T he sum collected would doubtless have been very much larger, but many gentlemen had forwarded their subscriptions direct to London before the appointment of tho committee. ABERDEEN. miidfl and county of Aberdeen have not been unmOdf.l. o toe sufferings of our countrymen in India. The Lord Provost brought the subject before the Town-council at a recent meeting, when it was warmly taken up. A subscription was at once begun which is still in progre. It promises to be most succe8sfui, the amount already sub. scribed beig 7501., and an interim remittance of 4001. has been forwarded to the Central Fund in London. Among other liberal 6nbseriptions from the city and county, the Duchess of Gordon has given 100l.; Mlr. and Mr Grant Duff, of Eden, 631.; Mr. Leslie. of Warthill, 501.; and Mr. Gordon, of Fyvie Castle, 501.
Thc SULTAN and the INDIN AMUTIVIES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The weight which still belongs in the East to the name of the Sublime Porte is deserving of remark in connexion with the Imperial subscription of 1,0001. which has just been announced to the Lord Mayor by the Turkish Ambassador. Even to the frontiers of China the Sultan-i-Room, or Sovereign of Constantine's new Rome, is the acknowledged head of the Mahomedan religion. A curious instance of this wml be found in Nena Sahib's proclamation in The Times of last Tuesday. The Sultan is there represented as interfering on behalf of the faith, and sending orders to the Pasha of Egypt to stop reinforcements which Queen Victoria was despatching to India in support of a design of forcible conversion. In this state of things we ought to feel grateful to our old ally for expressing in such a public manner his sympathy with the stffering which has been caused by the mistaken fanaticism of his co-religlonists in India.

(Before Mr Comm:wsioner Homom.l 0lu1 WAs a siVttng to adjudicate on a pelition presented on behalf of Colonel Daniel, under the provisions of the JointStock Companies Act, 1856, that an order for winding-up the company in this court may be made absolute. Mr. Lawrance appeared for the petitioner, Mr. Rox. burgh for the directors, Mr. Linklater for a number of contributories and the liquidator, and Mr. Chidley for various shareholders. On reference to the prospectus of the company it appear that It was proposed to establish it on the principle o "limited liability,' with a capitalof50 000L, in 5,000 shares of 101. each. The proTisional directors were the Hon. W.

Principal fisQhing stntion, Galway. *The first branch of operations of the company" was to be "fishing and the purchase of fish" The waters of the west coast of Ireland abound with the choicest cod, turbot, soles, lobsters, and other fish; but hitherto, owing to a variety of causes well known, these vast resources have not been turned to profitable account on a large scale. The company proposes, therefore, to carry out a sqstem of general lishing on the deep sea banks, and to purchase fish throughout the west coast of Ireland. The company propeset ff r eadvaes to a°ll- fishermen (or societs forme for neirbeneft) wh mayhcdAsosedto fisha In conjunction with the company's fleet of screw carriers. From such parties fish will be purchasee 'where caught," thus saving the fishermen 0 per cent, of time and wear and tear, and rlieving them of their greatest difficulty-viz., carrying thefish to market. The fieet of the company will in the first instance consist of two screw Eteamers of about 100 tons, six welled vessels of about 80 tons, and six ditto of about 50 tons. There wil also be store vessels for keeping fish and lobsters alive," and which will be commanded by experienced fishermen." The company " intends ultimately to extend its operations to the south and south-west coasts of Ireland, so as to avail themselves of railway accommodation from Haverfordwest to Mlford, near which port a depot for live fish, lobste and oysters will be established for the Bristol and Mlidland markets." The " quality," c, of the fish to be caught by the compazyis thus described :-" Cod taken on the west coast of Ireland is equal, if not superior, to the fish caught iu the North Seas. Ling is "remarkably fiue and very abundant." Turbot Is " more abundant and equal in quality to any caught on the Dutch coast." Lobsters are "of a size aud quality superior to any which can be produced elsewhere.D Haddock is "peculiarlylarge and abundant." The soles of "tbe Irish Eeas are superior in size and quality to those in any known fishing ground." Sun fish theoil from which realizes from 401. to 6K eacb, " are in great numbers at certain seasons" Coal fish are " very numerous, and are also very valuable for their oiL" The salmon of Ireland is "w ell known both as to its quality and abundance, as also Is its trout." Besides these, there are "in great quantity herrinAg, mackerel, dorey, halibut, eels, hake, sprats, oysters, crab:, prawns, and shrimps." A most abundant supply of marketable fish "may therefore be calculated upon," and arrngements have been made " which will insure a esale of almost any quantity." There is, indeed, "no limit to the demand - twice the quantity already sent to the metropolis will find a ready sale," and " by ireaus of steamers and ice " it will " arrive in better order and obtain a standard Price." It is also intended to "cure fish on a large scale.' It is estimated that "150,0001. at leat is paid out of Ireland for cured fish." This demand "the company intends to supply by a superior and more wholesome quality of fish caught on the Irish coast, principally by Irshumen." As to the second branch, namely, the manufacture of "f ish manure" or " fislh guano," a " very large branch of the compauy's business will be the conversion of the coarse and inedible fish into guano." It is "impossible to overrate this branch of the company's business." " Fully onehalf of the fish taken by trawl or line is inedible." " An unlimited quantity may therefore be readily procured on the western coast of Ireland." This " the directors intend converting into ' pulverized fish manure,' or ' fish guano,"' by " an approved process, at once simple, inexpensive, and effectual, with the practical operation of which they have made themselves thoroughly acquainted ;" and." they confidently anticipate a very large and remunerative return from this very important branch of the business." "A very large percentage of valuable oil is obtained by the proCess, whicb, with other elements of great commercial value, Wialone realize a very remunerative return." "Scientific men have for a long time turned their attention to this subject. and the great value of such fish manure has been demonstrated beyond all question." Tbe prspectus concludes by stating that, It i Is mpo.mibi0 wihi. .- fh 55I. o prospectus to set forth in detail the vast amount of information which the directors have obtained, the resources a' their command, or the means and appliances propoeed to be adopted." Only 40,000& of the capital will at present be called up. The shares may, however, be paid up in full at once, and in that case interest at the rate of 5 per cent. will be allowed upon all sums paid in antiaipation of calls. " In stating the amount of profit which may be realized, the directors are anxious to avoid all statements which might give rise to extravagant expectations; and, although a most careful celcaulation of the nnual expenses and a moderate estimate of returns, upon authentic data, would upon the first branch of the undertaidng give a return of 35 per cent. upon the capital, and this without calculating the profit to be obtained from the 'fish manure,' they desire this estimate of profit to be taken only as an expresslon of their conviction that there will be a very large and remunerative return for shareholders." The petition now before the Court set forth, among other things, that the company was provisionally registered about January, 1856, that on or abeut the 22d of September, 1856, the company was duly registered ; that the company commenced business with only a portion of the capital paid up; that the directors bave made calls of 81. per share - that the company has entirely failed, and that the petitioner verily believes that three-fourths or more of the paid-up capital has been lost or become unavailable, and debts and habilitlesto alarge imount have beau incurred, which the said company is unable to pay and discharge. That no general meeting of the company was held until on or about the 1st of August last (1857), and on the 14th of August last an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders was held, at which it was proposed that the said company should be wound voluntarily, and that an official liquidator with a remuneration of 5001. at the least shouldh be appointed for that purpose. The ground of such proposal was that the said company was insolvent. " That your petitioner is dissatisfied with the conduct of the directon:, and believes that It would be disadvantageous to the sbareholders and creditors that the said directors should continue to interfere with the winding up of the company, but that it would be more beneficial to the said shareholders and creditors that the same should be dissolved and wound up by this hon. court." This petition is met by one from Captain ThomasEdward Symonus, the managing director of the company; Mr. WiluAm Charles Wayghte, accounant- and Sir John Fox Burgoyne, of te War-office, l'all-mall, Inspector General of Her Majesty's Fortifications, and chairman of the Board of Directors of the abovementioned company, praying that the company may be allowed to continue to wMrd U voluntarily. Mr. ROXBIURGH raised a preliminary objection to the petition-viz., that the company, having resolved to wind up voluntarily,in pursuanceeof a power given by the Act of Parliament, it was not competent for a contributory to petition to have the company wound up by this Court. Ir. Roxburgh detaUed the circumstances of the voluntary winding up and the appointment of Mr. Wryghte as liquidAtor, and contended that, inasmuch as the liquidatorunder the voluntary winding up had precisely the same powers vested in him as an official liquidator in this court, the Court could not make the order prayed. Mr. I"xATER also objected, and referred to the 105th section of the Joint-Stock Companies Act, 1856, which enacts " that the voluntary winding up of a company shall not prejudice the rlght of any creditor of the said company to institute proceedings for the purpose of baving the same wound up by the Court." Mr. Linklater contended that it was clearly the intontion of the Legislature to give such right to a creditor only, and that contributories must be bound by the resolution to wind up voluntarily. Mr. CMDLY took the same ground. He further referred to the passing of the special resolution of the company to wind up. The 34th nd 64th sections referred to the manner in which such a resolution should be pased, and Mr. Chidley contended their provisions had been sufficlently complied with. It was true that the original resolution was not confirmed until te day after the presentation of the petton to this Court on the part of a contributory, but by the 64th section the winding up must be held to commence rrom the time of the original resolution. The oonfirmation 'Was only required to hind absent and dissentient share- holders.m The 64th section was silent as to confirmation. The CO030SORx.-By the 34th section it would not be a specal resolution unless confirmed. Mr. CHIDz urged that if all the shareholders were present atthe first meatng oonfirmation might be unne The Com O uomB overruled the objetions, and said there was sftll the question whether the Court weuld exercise its discretion. MT. LA.w BNe CE proceeded to urge that the case before the Court was one of that character. The business had been conducted by the directors in so reckles and ImTprovident a manner as to call for the interferene of this Court and due investigation. The oompany was oonstituted in October, 1856. and began operations in January, 1857. Althouh a speia resolution wau passed that an audit should take place every three months, no audit ever Itook place The first general meeting of the oompany wan hold on the 14th of August. Only 15 persons were present, mosy dirctors The resolution referred to ws passed on that occasion. The next mping w on the 18thof Se tember. Thee were then ely 17 shareholders present. The total number of shareholdeis was 13L At the secnd meet. Ing 15 onlzy of the shareholders agreed to the reeolution of the 14thO Au d not sen any a unts. The nominal capital oftls* eomprany ws 50,0001., divided Into 5,000 shares of 101, weh Only 2.941 hrs ee however, he alleged, serib for. The diecos a hecn guhtljof a gross denliction of dut in thus bgnn~ s NS$ ittU@ t0Q* tba lie tho requied cap1U From the report of Ifr. Wryghte, the liquidator it would appear that 3,532 shares were sub3crbed for, upon which a cal of 81. per shase wAs made. 1,400 shaes were thus missng. One of the earliest SDts of the company was to award 1,0001. to Mr. Henry Vallance, sohoitor of the oo mny, and one of its promoters, 4001. being applid for = upon shares; and 1,0001. was also voted to Captain 8ymons, also a promoter. That was before the oompany had earned a shilling by their operations, or a gingle step had been taken. The question arose whether this payment ought to have been mado out of the capital of the company. The first tbree sats of the comnpany, in fact, were payments of 501. to CaptainSymons, 1,0001. to Mr. Valiance, and 1,000?. to Captain Symons. Mr. ROXBURGH objectea to such statements being made. There was not a word on the subject in the petition. The COM sIIONXIR faid that all Mr. lAwrance now stated should hrme been in the petition if he intended to rely upon it. General allegations of fraud or mismanagement oould not be urged in this form. Mr. LAwnYAmcL- Fraud Is not imputed. Mr. ROXBURGIL-Mismanagement, if you like. Mr. LWMRAKCE contended that he had surely a right to refer to statements that appeared in the books of the companyt and that such statements might hereafter be imiroduced into the petition. It was not until yesterday that he had access to the oo pany's books. It had not, therefore, been possible to introduce that which they showed into the petition. Mr. LiNxLATER questioned the right of Mr. Lawranoe to make such statementa. is chent (Colonel Daniel) atten ded the meeting of the 14th of Augst. The Court of Chancery, he was sure, would not allow so inoonvenient a course as a petitioner travelling out of the course of his petition. The ComMmossER intimated An opinion that the petitioner should give reasonable information of what it was that he required to be answered. Mr. ROXBURGlI proceeded to object to speeches. They got into the newspapers before persons had any opportunity of answering them. The ComnirssIom -In this case you contend that because the compiny has taken steps for a voluntary windingup Mr. LAwrance is bound to show some special reasons to the contrary. MIr. LAwpRcE oontended that the fact of the company having lost three-fourths of its capital was sufficient for his purpose. The Iegislature said that he was entitled to his petition when three-fourths of the capital had become lost or unavailable. Mr. RoxunGlIL-That is not the case. Mr. L&.wB acz-It is palpable, and capable of proof beynad a donbt. Mr. Lawrance continued to urge that he was not *uound to allege gross misoonduct, on the part or zue lirect'ors. Suppose that three-fourths of the paid-up capital had not been lost, then he could not he heard at alL This was, in fact, all that he was required to establish. If the Court, however, desired that the petition should contain other matter, it wiould grant an djournment to allowr him to aawend. The Co0moxssoiN- thought this was the proper course. Admitting that it had been es6tablished that three-fourths of the capital had been lost, he thought after what had taken place in respect to the voluntary order for winding up that he ought not to adjudicate at present. It was the irst case of the kind that had come before the Court, and therefore some latitudo should be given to amend the petition. Mr. RIoxBuRGH. -The petitioner is the holder of only 25 shares. I represent the holders of 1,012 shares. The petitioner is the c.ly dissentient to the voluntary winding up, and the petition is unreasonfNble. The Co5Mrssmox_R.-That I cnnot say until I know the allerations, _Mr. RoxBuJRGH observed that the Court of Chancery had invariably refused a winding-up order on the ground of misconduct on the part of directors; ho referred ot course to other than crimi,nal misconduct. Whyshould the shareholders have greater benefit here? One shareholder might draw the whole company into litigation if such a course were allowed. Unless some special equitable ground could be shown he submitted that the petition musthe dismissed The proper remedy of the shareholder as to file abill in Chancery. If he then failed he would pay the penalty. tIr. LnELATE urged that it would be conceding an indulgence to Colonel Daniel to allow him to amend. He knew what would be required Sn any petition, and he ought to have been prepared. The liquidator under the voluntarv order had paid claims to the amount of 3,5001. The debts remaining unpaid were only 2,700?., and they would be discharged to-morrow if this petition were now refused. There was no reasonable ground for the interference of this Court. In any case the Court would. allow the right to amend without prejudice to the rights of the liquidator. The CaMMSSIOsER.-The 19th section provides for any dimculty of that kind. Mr. CHmLEY aleo urged the dismissal of the petition. The ComrussonxR sid, there would be an adjournment to amend. The adjournment mnst not, however, be understood as a precedent. The quegtion of costs must abide the result. There was no imputation upon the liquidator appointed under the voluntary winding up. He could continue therefore to perform a11 necessary daties. An adjournment was then ordered.
rZ?SOZjYE2JT DEBTORS' COUBT, Sept. 25. IN BE CHARLES GEARY. (Before Mr. Commisnioner Muriny.l mis Insolvent, desonbed s the Rv. U. Geary, and manager of the Indigent Seamstresses' Home, whoEe case has been notioed In The Ti7ms on two previous occasions, apperred again to-day. Mr. Sargood opposed, as before, for five creditors resident at Bath, printers and newspaper proprietors, whose united claims amounted to upwards of 601. for printing and advertising. Mr. Reed supported. The debts amounted to 7C01., and the assets nit. There had been previous insolvency, but the date was not given. zii. Ir. cii of the opposing creditors, was called, and repeated the evi ence he hoa given upon zim fist occasion, when the insolvent did not a e witness, who is a bookseller and printer at Bath, said that at the beginning of 1856 the insolvent, then a stranger, came to him, and, stating that he represented a charitable institution called the Indigent Seamstresse' Home, requested to be furnished with information as to the residents in Bath, to enable him to colleet subscriptions. Believlng the institution to be a really benovolent undertaking, witness gave the required information. Soon after the insolvent gave him an order for some cards, with the inscription "Captain Poe, late 50th Queen's Own, Secretary Indigent Seamstresses' some, 14, Fitzroy-street, Fitzroy.squ are, and subsequently another order for cards for himself, upon 'which were printed "Rev. C. Geary, Indigent Seamstresses Home, 14, Fitzzoy-street, Yitzroy-sauare, and 3, Beau-street, Bath." A further order was afteriards given for the printing of certain panil?lets, showing the daims of the institntion. The whole bill amounted to 311. 4s., and the account was sent to the institution in London under cover to the insolvent, with a request for payment, which was delayed for some tine, and ultimately wit-ness consented to receive the inrolvents acceptance for 251., which, however, on arriving at maturity, was dishonouredL The insolvent obtained 3t. lOs. upon his check, stating that he was short of cash to come up to town. The check was not paid, anid the banker stated that the insolvent scarcely ever kept a balance with them. After some time and pressure the 3Z. lOs. was repaid by the insolvent, and 51. was paid on account of the printing debt. Upon cross-examination, Mr. Clark said the insolvent bad made offers to pay the debt by instalments, but his propositionhad dnotbeen accepted. The costs of the present oppocition 'would be defrayed by a number of ladies and gentlemen at Bath, vwho, having been misled by the insolvent's m isrepresentations, had devoted the sums 'which they 'woulld otherwise have suboibed to the "Home" to mnaking known to the Court the manner of his proeedin. A cir cular had been sent round, which witness had printed, but declned to say for whom. Mr. RmXD pressed the witnes urpon this point, but Mr. Commissioner MuRPHY did not consider it at all materiaL The true defence which the insolvent had to make was to prove that there was such a society as he had represented, which authorized him to procure subsecriptions and contract debts. The inslvent was then examined by Mr. SARGOOD, in reply to whose questions he sted that he was the founder of the Indigent SeumtressesE Home, and was also the secre. tary. It was governed by a committee, but he could hardly say who 'were his psincipals who autborled him to go to Bath to collect subscriptions. He founded the institution in 1851 in conjunction iiith a committee of ladles. He had no employers, but 'was employed by himself. He had no authority from any committee to visit Bath, but it was not the first visit there. Mr. SARGooD referred to the balance-sheet of receipts and expenditure In the year 1856, 'which, he remarked, bommenced with the curious item of 1201. due from the institution to the insolvent. The insolvent said, theaccounts produoedhadbeen audited and approved by the auditors, General Pemberton and GenerafBreok. The committee and auditors had become connected with the institution upon the understanding that they -ere not to be liable for any expenseL For the first 15 months he ca%rried on the institution without receiving any remuneration, but aterwards, when it advanoed in prosperity, he was required to give his whole time to it, and he then received a slary of 1a a week. The insolvent produoed a letter from General Pemberton, dated Februay, 1857, in which that gentleman, after repudiating liability for a demand that had been made against him on behalf of the Home, added that he allowed b:s name to be publshed upon the understanding that he was to incur no responsibility, and that his duties would be confined to auditing the ccounts; that he had only attended once, in October, 1855, and upon that occasion voucbers were produced for all items except the payments made to the inmates of the Home. Mr. SARGOOD remarked that those unvouched items amounted to 4001. The learned Comssroxm sid, although vonchers had not been produoed, it appeared that the auditors had sanctioned the accounts. Upon further examination the insolvent said the statement of accounts which he had filed was correct. In Januarv, 1856, he received IX subscriptions 961., and the espenuditure was only 72L In February there was a balance of 1,in Marc-hof401., andinApril 171., maidng *total excess of 1031 reeipts above expenditure in these four months, hut ln the following months the figares Wrem reversed. Upon being examined by Mr. RigD, the insolvent said there ras a committee of ladies who met every month, and the accounts were regularly submittedto them. Mr. BARGOOD called for the minute book of the committe to ee what their resolutions were. The insolvent replied that there was no minute book kept. He submitted the ccounts of the expenditure,and the ladies sdned them. In the first year 69 persons were reHeved by the Institution, some with shelter and others with employ. ment. In the next year Ul persons were ssisted, and in the third year 117, and the number had gono on inoreas- he learned CownumoNm inquired whether any yroof could be given that the distinguished persons whose names appeared mn *he circulars relating to the institution as appnroving and supporting lt had ever onsented that they hould be so represented, ande an example took the iam of tbe Marchlonees of Hastings, one of the patronesses. X Iusol3y0nT' >14 the MglWlonoss had been asked to allow her nme to be mentioned as a patronew and had COL sented Everyonewhoen-me had been uslhad given pelasioa either verblly or in riting, but he wa unable to produo. the b.okInwhicl those written authoriztiong had been entered, In conseqoence of it hbaing byn lot In the confuson attendantupon n execution in nU houe.

Ferguson was preaen% but id not remember belDg charged with a oonneidon with a Dr. Dewlhurat, who had benoonvicted, &c, Mr. Ferguson did charge hia with having kept the price of certain dinner ticket upon the occasion of a festival to celebrae Sir D. L. Evans's sond retumnfor Westminster. He waaa "reverend," having onoe been ordained by Dr. Dillon, and dnoe been recognized as pAstor by a Baptit bodr. Mr. BszD produced the Baptist Manuat, in which the Insolvent's name was entered as minister of Prinoes-place Chape. e insolvent admitted that some 12 years ago he had been conrected with a loan society at Chels, and thAt upon his leaving that society there was a baLnee dr e from him but it had ione been settled. He had also once been empl;oyed to collect rents for a Wr. Willis, and had omitted to pay over a certain sum which he had been obliged to enter on his former schedule; but that wAs 13 or 14 yeas ago. l Mr. Commissioner MuRPHY thought it unneoessay to rip up trausactlons of such old date, unless evidenoe could be given to disprove his atement. The insolvent at present had shown by his own declsration that he was suthorzed to use the 1names set forth in the dirculars of the institution, and upon the faith of which no doubt man-y subsriptions had been paid. If that statemnent could not not be disproved the case resolved itself into a simple case of a debt of 31. for prlnting. In the reports put In by the insolvent there was a letter from Mrsm Braoebridge, on behalf of Mis Nightingsle, dated Crimea, May, 1855, acknowledging the reoeipt of seven peroels of shirts for the sick and wounded. Thai looked as if the institution reslly did exist, and unles6 parties whose names were put forth cbose to repudiate the connexion, It must be anumed that they had given their sanction to it. At present the Court d ient materials upon which it could decide, and It would be desirable to have General Pemberton, or some otber person whose name had beon used. Mr.usnm said his client had been in prison eight months, with only a fortnight's interval of liberty upon bail. MIr. SARGOOD Addrssscd the Court, oontending that the imtitution was a pure humbug and was nothing but a speculation of the insolvent. ln the first four months of 1856 the insolvent recelved 1001. more than he expended, and therefore had to explkin why he had not paid the creditors at Bath, by whose means he had been enabled to pro. cure subscriptions. In the schedule there waa debt of 401 the rent of the house in which the "Home" was est^blis6ed 94 for repairs executed there, and 161. for poorrate. He occupation of the insolvent had been to trade upon the large amount of benevolence to be found In thie country, and although, of course, he hrd to some extent afforded relief to some old women for the sake of appear. ances, yet the chief end and object of the "institution were his own advantage. Mr. Ileed was about to replL wrhen Mfr. nr sted tbat he appeared for a creditor who had been miled as to the day of hering, and was therefore not present. the case was ordered to stand over until to-morrow (this day). RB TH0OM WENHAI The insolvent was opposed for a Mrs. O'Brien. It ap. ered that the insolveat set up a claim to three oottages at orpe, in Surrey, alleging that they had passed to hin in cons eration of money advanoed to the former owner, one Wellbelo"ed, brother of Mrs. O'Brien, and that a oonvey. aceexecuted by Welbeloved to his risteres late husband Vas a oolourable transaction, intended to defeat the creditors of the former person. The insolvent had been defeatcd in an action of ejectment, and had oommenced procecding in Chancery which were still pending. He was now in custody for 70 , the costs in the action of ejectment, and it was stated that the total costs to which tho opposing credi. tor had been put was at least 3501. The learned COMamoNZ thought the insolvent had not been Juatified in the course ho had adopt bd; but, con. sidering t at he had been in prison. for two years, the re. mand would be nearly nominal-viz., for 16 calendar months from the vesting order which would expire in about a month from the present time. I R1E .L . CIARuC. In this case an application was made for the pLyment out of court of the sum of 5004, all the debts in the schedule having been fullv satisfied. Application granted. IN RE SAMUEL R}OLDS. This insolvent whose case was reported on Wednesday, ws further heard. The question in the case was whether the insolvent had committed a breach of trust as executor. There was a deficienc as to 3001. over 11 yea za nd he alle-ed that he had not approtrlated any part. It had been disallowed by the Coz fuacery mn his accounts. Mr. Commissioner MtussPny thought, under all the cir. cumetances, that it was a ase for a short judgment, and gave one of twvo months under the discretionary clause. IN RX THE10S PRIESTLEY. The insolvent was traveller to the opposing crdtors, Messrs. Serjeant, and had received 504 from a customer, which he returned at 204. MKezss Serisant sued the ecustomer, who defended and proved payment of the wvhole. The costs were 1201. to Meairs Serjesnt. MIr. Commissioner MUlRPHY considered the time the Ansolvent had been in prison, and gave a judgment of si months from the vesting order under the discretionary clause.~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~er
.AZDDLE-SEX SESSION4 FridWy, Sept 25. The sittings of the Court for the September Sevdons were resumed this morning, pursuant to adjournment from Clerkenwe3l, at the Guidhal Westminster before Mr. Bodiu (presiding for the Assistant-Judge), Mr. Creasy, and a bench of mnagistrates. There were 103 prisoners for trlai oO charged with felony and 20 with misdemeanour, besides ,all cases. Mr. BODin charged the grand jury. JohnrJeffirey, 41, a most respectable-looking man, was indicted for stealing a rdlver teapot and other articles, of the value of 801. the property of Mary Carey, his mlstrein He pleaded "Guilty.r MAr. PiYNX, for the proescwtlon, informed the Court that the prisoner was a oonfidential servant and butler in the employmentofm Carqy theidow of the late Bishop of M.ph, and fromtmeto time he had pledged forks, spoors, and other aticles of plate, the value of which in the aggregate was about W. The prisoner, by some ingenious ruethod, contrived to oblite a6te the mitre from the articles he purloined, but, on offering some forks in pledge the mitre on which was not entirelyeffaced, the pawnbroker very properly retained them, and subsoquently tbe prisoner. was apprehended. It appeared that he had robbed his mistress to provide himsef with money to lay out on horse. racing. A betting-book was found in his powsession, and the dates of the bets he had made corresponded, with the times of pledging. He made up a book for the last Derby, and s prepaing another for that of 1858. Be had been in his situation six years, and had borne a good charactr up to this transection. The dates in the book were from Sep. tember, 1S56, to August last. Mr. BoDRn1 said this was another unfortunate instanoo of a servant plunder' his employer for the purpose of gambling on horseraces, The prisoner could not have expected to go on without detection, and he must have been well aware of the consequenoes that his detection would lead to. It was a caee of a very aggravated nature, and for the sae of public justice he shouldpass a sentence of three years' penal servtude. John Smith, 26, p leaded " Guilty" to a charge of felo. niously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Henzy Henderson, and stealing therein eight gold rings, value 81, 8s., his proprty The prosecuior was a salversmith and jeweller, 37, Strand, and the prisonerbroke a square of glas in the shop window, thrust his hand through, and ran away with some rings which he had grasped. He was pursued and captured by the shopman, when he said he had done it through desd. tutioni. The CouRT sentenced him to 12 months' hard labour, Thomas Richardson, an elderly man, was tried and Conticted upon an indictment for an indecent asault upon Sarah Eborn, under 12 yeas of age, in Westend-fields, near Kilburn. He had been sentenced to 12 months for a Imlar offence, and the Court nowv pased a sentence of double that Ir. Sleigh prosecuted, instructed by the AssociAte Institute for Improving and Enforcing the Laws for the Protec. tion of Women. Henry Shearing, 32, and John Mondon, 49, journeymen slaters, were indicted for stealing 15h. of lead the prop of James Turnbull, the same being fixed to a uilding. They were sentenced each to six months' hard labour. Alfred Keneer, 21, was indicted for embezzling several small sums of money which he had received on account of Wi,illan Beard, his master, a fishmonger. He pleaded "tGuilty." The proseutor stated that he bad been robbed twice before by persons who had bad the situatiou filled by the risoner One absconded and went to the Crimea, where ne died of cholera; the other ran away to Birmingham, but he had been lucky enough to bring the third-the prisoner -to Justioe.

AN IJYDIAN BRIGADZ. TO THE EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-In a few words I would offer the following suggestion, wvhich would place a splendid brigade at the service of the Government, aud help to solve the difficult point of promotion by purchase-viz., raise an Indian brigade, for service in India for a limited peiiod, say five or ten yenrs, of 10,000 men from the class Xwho fill your coliumus as " Young English3nen." Let half the officers be appointed by the Government and the other half from among themPelves; let all further vacancies be filled up from The ranks of tho corps, for distinguished service or mierit. Thus would there be a fair opening for all. Yours obediently. - it. L. T. Isle of Wioht, Sept 24.
LOSS OF HER JEAJBSZ'YS SHIfP TRAiNSIT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME3. Sir,-Your China correspondent remarks as follows "The achievements of the coral reefs in the Straits of 13anca ought to reach you mueh earlier than throuigh me. Five vessels of war have been ashoro in those Straits within the last 12 months. The Transit alone of all the five made the most of the opportunity, and went dowm. The Himalaya bumps, sacrifices a little coal and a little water, and proceeds on her way rejoicing. The Actuon strikes, knocks away her false keel, and sails away aU the better for it. The Transit takes the matter aot s&k ax, and goes with aU alacrity to the bottom. " You will be told, of course, that at any rate this was no fault of the slhip. Do your friends at the Adm iralty believe in 'iluck,' and witchcraft, and judicial astrology, and sirit-rappinig9 If so, the sane portion of the nation oulght to be acquainted with their state of mind. Sane men Who are not in the Admiralty judge a ship bv her performunces. It may be snd oftentimes is a ship's own fault even that she runs upon a rock, and her fault that sle cannot be got off again. It must bo her fault if she constantly suecu,bs to accidents which other ships survive. An invalid dins of a blow which would not affeet a strong man, or a cripple is crusched by a descending force which an active man wvould avoid." P'ersonal observation aued kuowlsdge euablu 11u to subjoin the follow.ing facts in corroboration of the above. The Himalaya, Sobraon, and Assaye were all designed and built at Mare and Co.'s, Blackwall, about the same -period of time, as fast mail and passerger packets, for tho Peninsular and Oriental Company. The Admiralty subsequently purchased the twolatter, andnamed themresl)ectively the Perseverance and Transit. The fimalaya also became the property of th2 Government, but sho was fitted for sea by Captain Adam Kelloek, under the auspices of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and her per. formanees have always elicited the highest commendations. LNext came tho Persevcrance ; she was taken in hand by the auth)rities of lor M-ajesty's doeckyard, Woolwich, to be fitted for sea, as " per establishment; " her beautifully framed hull, designed to carry the light masts, yards, &c. of a bark, would not stand up under tho monstrous top. hamper of an ordinary 74; for no soonar were the dog chores knocked away than over she went; her towering -asts in their descent partly capsized the dockyard church, Injuring the saw-miUs, dock, and caisson, and the hull of the vessel to a very considerable extent. The Admiralty then wisely appealed to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, who appointed Captain Harris to take charge and fit her for sea. She thus escaped all further vicissitudes and notoriety. Now fur the sister ship Transit, and tho assumed in fallibility of the esta'blishinent that decrees a dray-horse 3oad for a racer to stagger under. Upon her fine lines is raisedI agiganticforecastle, and aloft the oumbrous masts, yards, caps, cress and trestle-trees, &ec. Her sharp bow is further depressed by the ponderous Admiralty anchors. All tLis siuperincumbent gear, compared with that on board the Himalaya, is double the weight it shoald be. Under this load she has lahoured and rolled, ever in imminent danger of foundering, or running to somne friendly port for shelter and rcpairs. Creat length, narrow beam, and fine bows aro the cha ra.cteristics of modern steamships, hence the necessity to kceep themn light forward. The Aimericans, for the sale of lightnless and buoy ancy, aetially repudiate the bowsprit in their occangoirg steamers, and well I remember Captain Kellock observiug to me, "At 200 feet from the centre or fulcrum evcry pound must be saved-it is like weight at tie end of a steelyard; in breasting a head sea the iship's bow should rise to it, and not blunder through." Accordingly, the Hi:nalaya was supplied with bower anchors all of Trotmnan's plan, and weighing together 7. tons, at a cost of 2 8"'. Tho Transit is a smaller ship by at least 1,000 tons, yet the aggreinate weight of her Admiralty bower anchllr exceeds 131. tons, the contract price of which is $.'01. The larger shlip going stom on, 14 knots, touches, lifts, and glides on to tho reef or bank; then, with the a-Uistance of her liglht but efficient anchorss (easily carried out astern in her own boats), she is hauled *.T again; while the overweighted Transit, stag-, Cering onwards at eight knots, touches, then rebounds, and with one fearftul orash her fate is irrevocrbly sealed, aud -the recording epitaph may be 'Sic trensil 171oria mucndli." If I mistake not, her unwieldy Admiralty anchor caused part of the delay on the occasion of tho naval review, when it was said that reverend bishops, noble lords, and grave judges all lent a hand at ihe capstan to assist in the weighing it. and the selfsarne qnchor wvas nearly the cause Qt her sinking with all hands in the dead of night at tha very outset of thi3 present fatal voyage. In ca:ncluion I will only further remark, that at the nstance of the general body of shipowners, underwriters, 2&c., of thl united kingdom, tho Admiralty instituted a eomnuttce ci naval officers and sbipowners, preidedover ,by Adaniral Sir Montague Stcpford, G.C.B., in order to -determ ine by n series of practical trials and tests, the rein)tive merits of dirTerent dese iiptions of anchors. There were ;eight competing plans submitted to proof, and with one ex ieption only the establish&d an^hor of the navy was unanimnously declared to be the least efficient, and deficient in all the vit'l pointe looked for in a good anchor. The ofiicial report, dated the 1st of February, 18S, was approved and promnlgated by the Lords Oommissionore of the Admiralty, ,snd, strange to say, since that period probably mnore than Ii").,09'7. of the public money has been sqnandered to perpeb.sate the condemned Admiralty machor &t the bows of Hr,3Majesty's ships.

TH.E REINFORCEMBLNTS FOi- TJVDIA. (From Thacker's Over lantd yCeD I ¶The following is a complete ar d corrected list of the transports which have ssqied for India with reiuforcements of troops to suppreas the Sepoy mutinies ; also the vessels engaged to take out the regiments last ordered to India, and now emibarkiing. The dates and numbers having been corrected from the official l1tt, and the detail of officers embarked added to each detachment, will account for any discrepancies from the previous statements, and makes the information in its present form complete. Tho-e vessels named as destined for Ceylvn touch at Point de txalle for final orders. The movements of those vessels of whieh we have any tidings are given in the footnotes. From the totals given by this list it will be seen that 77 vessels have already sailed for India since the news of the revolt first reached home, conveying to the assistance of our countrymen a force of 29,935 men of all ranks of Cavalry, Infantry, and Artillery; and that a further force of 5,000 men of the Cavalry, Iefantry, Artillery, Engineers, aiid Field Train will embark almost immediately for the same destination. As the vessels which first left these shores have now been out dlose upon 90 days, we may calculate with some degree of eertainty that, in addition to the 14,000 reinforcements already landed at Calcutta from China, the Cape, and Maiiritius, relief from England will now be daily arriving, and that during next month a force of over 9,000 men will be landed aud sent up the eountry, to be followed in November by nearly 18,000 men, and in the followvinig month, December, by nearly 18,000 more, including the 5,000 now embarking ; so that by the close of the year we shall have lncreased the British force in India by at least 48,000 well-seasoned and diseiplined troops of every arm in the service.

The public awaits with anxiety the arrival of a telegraphic despatoh from the East, and there are many speculations as to the character of the intelligence it 'wil convey. We hear the words " good news" and " bad news " not unfrequently used in reference to the eouected tidings; but, under the circumstances, no phrases can be more indefinite or valueless. After the first " bad news," announcing that the whole Bengal army had mutinied and entered upon a career of atrocity unexampled, we believe, in the history of tho humnan fauily, we had a right to expect a great deal of other " bad news" in the shape of horrible episodes and disastrous incidents. Our expectations have been painfully realised, and we fear that in this sense "bad news" must be expected for somo mails to come. But, while we trust to hear of no further disastrous event of magnitude, wo must at the same time warn our readers that it is scorccly reasonable to hope that we shall have decidedly good 2ucws for at least two muonths from the present time. The checkered accounts brought by the last two or three mails will, in all likellhood, be inmitated by those which are to come. Hecroic resistance, gallant victorie, instances of sublime fortitude will, we fear, be heard of only in alternation with mnany melancholy oircumstances incidental to a contest so fearful aud desperate. We are not, wo repeat, justified in anticipating that any large and decided change for the better, any strong bursting forth of the avenging weatcrs willtake place before about the third week ia October, when tho first strong body of reinforcements from Rogand may be expected to arrive at the principal scenes of the mutiny. In addition to the reinforcements already announced, the next accounts from India will probably inform us that about three sniore regiments have arrived. These reinforcements are timely and valuable beyond their mere numbers, but they can hardly be considered as important additions to the regular strength of the Queen's troops in India. At the outbreak of the mutiny, and even aftor the return of the 64th and 7&h from the Persian expedition, the Royal infantry regiments in India were two (or 2,G00 men) under their l stablished number of 24 battalions, and the 22 on the spot were awaiting the usual draughts sent out every year from the dep6ts to keep up their strengtb. These draughts amounted in the aggregate to about 3.000 men. The mutineers, lnerefore, seized a time of year for their purpose when there were nearly 5,030 fewer Europeans to be overcome than would be in India in the autumn. This deficiency has been before this made up, not by the regular draughts and regiments destined for reliefs, bht by certain regiments forwarded from the colonies or diverted from the projected China expedition. We have heard of the arrival of the 5th Fasileers (which had been ordered to China) from the Mauritius, the 90th Light Infantry, intercepted on its passage to China ; the greater petrt of the 37th Regiment, from Ceylon; tho 33d, from the Mauritius, and a detachment of between 200 and 300 of the 59 h Regiment, not from Hongkong, as is supposed, but sent out from England, in order to reinforce the regiment at that colony, and diverted like the rest from its original destination. These reinforcements, of whose actnal arrival we bave news, amount altogether to about 3,000 men. Inasmuch as Ascension was passed on July 14 by the last detachment of the troops sent out for service in China, we trust that the en. no expect-ed will Informu s that the whole of the 23d Fuslleers, 82d Regiment, and 93d Highlanders bad also been landed.' They are thrceo excellent regiments, and in round numbers wouild riuster about 2,500 man. The Queen's army would thus have been for some weeks past reinforced by about 5.500 meon; hut it will be seen froma what wehbave stated that this is VerY little more than the n umber by which the Europeana force was under its. com* pe ntfor ordinary duties, and certainly not more than moths, Provide for the casualties of the last four The new Indian army, which is to punish treacher and re-establi.sh British supremnacy commenced to leave our shoesonth 1s o Jly Wema pesmet h duigti ekcmecn oln,adtetasot itaff, and we have reason to boliecp that arrangemernts ha ben, mede as regards the riv, transport, to send nup th3 troops in a continuous strearr aS fast as they could arrite. As regards the staff of the army, we have fortunately snore data to guide. °'or selection now' than at the oomn meneement of the T-ssianw var, Indian Fervice has baob;ghb onit the good JuP'.ties of our officers brilliantly before this. I We can now look to Indian and Crimean experience. in Sir Colin hirosel, we believe, the publio unanimously and hearly cr,nfides, and the past career of his chief of the Sotaffi, (h'.neral Maes6ield, augurs abrilliant futre.' Colonel Pakenl-am, the late Adjutant-General of the Crimean army, will fill a similar position in India, and Colonel Wetherail, en officer of the highest reputation in the Russian war, will 'be Quartermaster-Gercral. Generals Windham and Rese have sailed for India, and General Ashburnh%m, tho Commnander of the China expedition, will also have a command. ColonelCotton, who hasservedformany gearsiu India, Colonel Michel, of Cape celebrity, and Colonel flavelock will have the ranks and commands of Major-Generals. This last promotion is, of course, not intended as a reward to Gcneral Havelook, who will be honoured in a manner commensurate with the brilliancy of his services. The general b)dy of the Staff is being seleoted by Sir Colin Campbell from among those officers now in India or on their way, and we may be confident that, as far as possible, the best men will be chosen. Every necessary arrangement will have been made for the movements of the army when it lands, and, when tho great blowv comes to be struck, it will be struck with vigour and effect.
MILITABY AND NA VAL INTELLICEYCE. Yesterday a detaohment of Royal Marine Light Infantry, consisting of 48 non-commissioned officers and men, nuder the command of Lieutenant H. L. Rose, left head. quairters, Chatham, and embarked on board the Wellington, 72, Captain J. Moore, having been previously inspected by Lieutenant-Colonel J. El. Gascoigne. The Wellington is intended to be employed on the Coastguard service on the coast of Scotland; her crew, including marines, wiiU consist of 350 men. The whole of the staff appointments in the three battalions whici are to be formed at Chatham garrison on the 1st of October are now filled up with the exception of the following, the officers for which have not yet been selected: -First Battalion-Adjatant, Instructor of Musketry, and Assistaut-Sargeon; Second Battalion-Instructor of Musketry, Surgeon, and Assistant-Surgeon; Third Battalion-Qaartermaster, Instructor of 'Musketry, Surgeon, and Asistant-surgeon: The depots of the whole of the regiments serving in India will be attached to the battalions at Chatham. The screw steam transport Italian, Captain Johnstone, arrived in Cork harbour from Liverpool on Tuesday to embark troops for India. She will take out 200 men and officers of the 18th Royal Irish. The screw steamship Austrla is hourly expected at Cork to embark the 94th. The depOt of the 14th Regiment, now stationed in Cork, has received orders to form a second battalion. On Thursday a special train left the Curragh with 200 of the 15th Regiment for Cork, whence they will proceed to Queenstown to embark on board the Italian for India. The 94th Regiment will leave Dablin for Cork in a few days to embark for India. Intelligence has reached Ireland announcing that second battalions are to be given to every regiment up to and ineluding the 18th Royal Irish. A great deal of activity prevails in the shipbuilding department of Chatham Dockyard, in order to complete those vessels now building which are ordered to be made ready for launching forthwith. Armong the most forward of the ships now in progress is the Hero, 91, screw steamer, of 3,127 tons burden. It is expected that she will be fit for lannching early in the ensning year. The Hood, 90, is in a very forward state, and will shortly be completed. The fine screw.steam frigate Mersey, 40, has all the available force of the dockyard now at work about her, and the utmost despatch is being shown in having her completed. Although only laid down during the present year she is expected to be completed and ready for launching early next spring. The Irresistible, 80, screw steamer, and Charybdis, 21, are both progressing; the latter is to be supplied with engines of 400 horse-power. The Goliah, 8), is undergoing several alterations in order to adapt her for a screw steamer, in addition to two large screw steamers, to be named the Atlas, 91, and the Orpheus, 22, which are to be commenced immediately at Chatham. another 91-gun screw steamer, to be named the Bulwark, will be laid down immediately a building-slip is vacant. The head-quarters of the 7th Dragoon Guards left Chatham yesterday morning for the purpose of proceeding to Canterbury, where they will be stationed until the regiment embarks for India. The machinery department of the Meeanee, 80 guns, new screw steamship, is ordered to be hastened, She is to be fitted as a second-class steamship of reserve. The Locust, 3 guns, paddlewheel steam vessel, Lientenant Commander John B. Field, left Sheerness at 5 p.m. on Thursday for Leith. Captain Henry Harvey, flag-captain, proceeded in her for the purpose of investigating some matters connected with the fishery disputes between the British r,d Pron-h fiahormon.
!Pl.B LATB1 MURDEAR BIS LEIR-OODS NEAR BRBISTOL. The news of the capture of Beale reached Bristol by telegraph on Thursday evening. It is supposed that Beale was in Bristol on the Monday previous to the murder, as ho called at the shop of a tailor named Aplin, in Wine-street early on] Tuesday morning, and saw a cousin named Wood, a workman in Mr. Aplin's employ. Beale went with his relative into the workshop and soon made himself familiar with the other men. In the course of conversation he asked his cousin to measure him for a coat, and while Wood was so engaged he discovered that Beale had a emaU pistol in his breast pocket. On asking him why he carried suoh a weapon, Beale said that he had always carried a pistol since ho was attaoked near the lodgegate of tho house at which he was living, and that he always kept it loaded and capped, One of the workmen suggested that it was rather dangerous to have a loaded pistol about ono's person, to which Beale replied, " Oh, no, a child could play with it." After staying some time Beale and his cousin, with some of the workmen, adjourned to the King's Read tavern, in Wine-street, where they had some beer together, played several games of bagatelle, and left rather late in the evening. On Wednesday morning Beale saw his cousin again at the shop, andteid him he was going to Bath. Wood saw no more of him until Friday night, and again on Saturday morning at the workshop. In the course of conversation the murder which had been discouered on the previous evening was alluded to, and the workmen now recollect tbat while talking about it Beale turned pale and trembled. No notice was taken, however, at the time, as it was thought that Beale had been drinking rather freely. Beale shortly afterwardswished his oousin and his fellow-workmen "Good-by," and stated that he was going back to Bath. It has also been ascertained that on Wednesday Beale went to the shop of ihr. ThornIey, of Clare-st4eet, Bristol, and ordered a new hat, stating that he would call for it on Friday morning. fie did not, however, call on that day, but he came on Saturday morning about 10 o'clock, paid 12s. for the hat, wl:ich he left at the shop, and called for it again about 1 o'clock, when he requested that it might be put into a hatbox, with his name written on it. This was done, and Beale left, taking his hat with him. A manservant, living at Mr. Bythesea's, at Fresliford, accompanied Bealo and the deceased to tho Limpley Stoke Station, and saw them both take the train for Bristol. By Beale's directions the girl's boxes were labelled for Bristol, and were directed, "Mr. Bealo, passenger to Bristol, to bo left till called for." On Thursday morning Beale went to the railway station for the luggago, and had an altercation with the authorities respecting an alleged overcharge for the r.moval of tho boxes from the Great Western to the Midland station. On Friday Beale was in company with a man named Hill, who was about to marry his sister, and who had arrived at Bristol from Cornwalla day or two previouslv, and it is believed that he slept with HiU at the Alma eating-house, Temple-gate, Bristcl, on Friday night. Beale was a married man, and lived with Pagsley at the Hon. Mrs. Hutchinson's, at Dorset-house, Clifton. After that lady's establishment at Clifton was broken up Pogsley went to live at Flora-cottage, Clifton, with Beale and his wife, and in consequence of some jealousy on the part of the wife Pugsley left rather suddenly. Before taking his present situation Beale lived at Park's CoUege, near Bath, and took frequent oppor. tunities of visiting Pugsley at Freshford. AIrs. Louisa Ford, housekeeper to MIr. Bythesea, states that a day or two before Pagsley left Freshford she withdrew her money from the Bath Savings-bank, and that she also received 4t. 5s. on account of her wages. It is believed the deceased had about 101. in her possession at the time she left Freshford. (BY ELECTRIC %ZN1D fLTERNATION-AL TELEGRAHrn) Beale arrived at Bristol shortly before 6 yesterday evening in custody of Norris, Inspector of Bath Police. On quitting the train the mob rushed on him, and with difflcultr the life of the prisoner was preserved. He was at once taken before the magistrates at BourtonL Union Workhouse, where, af,er the evidence of Jones, saperintendent of the A.shton police, had been taken, he was remanded till this day (Saturday). He volunteered a statement denying his gailt, admitting that he knew Charlotte Pugsley; she was a married woman though passing under her maiden name. On Thursday, the 10th, after bringing her from Fresbford on the previous day, he handed her over to her husband, 'whose Christian name was George or Thomas; he did not know the surname. They were to have seen him on the next day, but as they did not come he returned to Daventry, taking with him decoased's boxes, hoping they would be applied for. This statement varies from the one made to his fellow-servants at Daventry, whom ho told the boxes and contents belonged to a sister who was dead, and to attend whose funeral he obtained leave of absence for a week. This is known to be falte. The prisoner maintained his self-possession, and signed his statement with a firm band.

The traffic returns of railways in the united kingdom published for the week ending Scptemnber 19 amounted to 518,7981., and for the corresponding week of 1856 to 499,631., showing an increaso of 19,1151. The grows re. ceipts of the eight railways having their termini in the metropolis amounted for the week ending as abovo to 214,6951., and for the corresponding week of last year to 213,4911., showing an increase of 1, 241. The increase on the Eastern Counties Railwayamounted to 1,5571 ; on the Great Northern to 1151.; on the Great Western to 1,2871 ; and on the London and North-Western to 1,0431. ; -total, 4,0024. But from this must be deducted 861., the decrease on the London and BlackwaUl; 3431. on the London, Brighton, andSouth Coast; 1,1241. on the London and South-Western, and 1,1431. on the South-Eastern-together, 2,79I. ; leaving the increase, as above, 1,2041. The receipts on tho other lines in the united kingdom amounted to 304.1031., and for the corresponding period of 18,6 to 286,1921., showing an increaee of 17,9111. in the receipts of those lines, which, added to the increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the total increase 19,1 54 as compared with the corresponding week of 1856. The following are the reedpts of railways for the past week:- YARMOUTH AND HADDISCOE. Thehalf-yearlymeetingof this company was held yesterday at Great Yarmouth; SirE. H. K. Lacon in the chair. 'The report stated thai as more than the proceeds of the last call of 21. per share had been expended in furtberance of the railway, the directors had ordered a further call of 21. per share to enable the contractor to proceed with the in- ertaking. With regard to the progress of the works al that was possible was being done. The viaduct over the marshes near the Haddiscoe station was one of no ordinary difficulty, the average length of the piles exceeding 80 feet on about a quarter of a mile in extent. The wholeof thepiles were driven for the intended swing bridge, and the work generally was proceeding in an expeditious manner, but as a large portion of the eorthwork would have to be brought over the river Waveney iI was uselems to commence the neighbouring cuttings at present. The wbole of the permanent way materiais for a single line had been purchased and delivered. With respect to the agreement with the Eastern Counties Company for the conduct of the traffic from Yarmouth and Lowestoft, it would be under the super. intendence of a committee of four ptrsons, two to be appointed by the amalgamated East Suffolk Companies and two by the Eastern Counties, with an umpire. A memorandum of the terms of the agreement had been submitted to the directors, and a deed of contraot between the companies was being prepared by their solicitors. The arrangement was not to prejudice or in any way affect the provisional agreements entered into with Sir Morton Peta for a guarantee of 6 per cent. per annum on the capital expended. The total receipts to June 30 amounted to 9,3291., and the payments to 7,8157., leaving a balance of 3881. The COrAlRorAN, in moving the adoption of tho report~ said he had no doubt Sir Morton Peto would be happy to give any further explanations which might be required. In reply to questions, Sir M. Tro stated, with regard to the payments already made to him, that the value of the work done exceeded 243,0001. By the agreement with the Eastern Counties Com.- pany the rates in respect of traffic were to be the same by both routes, and all through traffic was, under any circumstances, to be booked and accounted for as If it were carried by the shortest route. There vrere to be three passenger trains each way daily and aU necessary goods trains, and the same speed was to be observed throughout the entire Eastern system. Thc report was adopted, and the directors were authorized to raise 25,0001. on debanltures. The retiring directors, Sir E. Lacon, Mfr. Rl. Hamnmond, and Mr. T. Brightwen, were reelected, and the proceedings elosed with votes of thanks to the chairman and directors, and also to Sir hl. Peto. WAVENEY VALLEY. The committee appointed at a public meeting beld at Bangay in January last has .just had an interview with a deputat on from the Eastern Union Company in that town. The deputation stated that the directors had made a conditional contract for completing the line to Bongay, and had arranged for the necessary amount of capital for that pur| pose-viz., 40,0171, leaving only the land to be provided for, the coat of which they estimated at 8,0001., and that if thin were suppled by the district the works would be forthwith commenced, and the line would be ready for traffic by Jly, 18, after whch immediate steps would be taken to extend it to Beccles, which town is already in railway communication with Ealesworth, Norwich, and Lowestoft by a branch. A sub-committeewasthen appointed to obtain subscriptions. Upwards of 2,0001. of the required 8,0001 is already subscribed, and it is fully expected that the remainder will ba supplied. NENAGH ANTD CASTLECONTNELL A meeting of landowners and the inhabitants of Nenagh was held there on Monday to consider the propriety of promoting the construction of a line from the town of Nenagh to the Limerick and Castlecounell Railway at the latter place. The Right Hon. Lord Danally presided. It was stated that 60,0001. of the capital required would be subscribed towards the construction of the line by established railway companies, and aU that was requirec of I the Inhabitants and others locally interested in the under- taring was that they should subscribe 20,0001. The proosed line would, by means of theLiinerick and CastleconnelU Railway, now nearly completed, form railway communica. tion between Nenagh and Limerick. A committee was appointed, consistlng of Lord Dunally, Captain Holmes, Captain Carroll, Dr. Qain, and Messrs. J. Kilkelly, A. Crawford, and Poe, with a view to soHcit the landowners and others to become shareholders in the undertaking. The meeting then separated. GEELONG AND B&LLARAT. A special general meeting of the shareholders in this comp ny was -held yesterday at the office, Bishopsgate.street; Mr. Cary in the cbair. The CATrAt having stated that the object of the meeting was to confirm a resolution passed at the lsst meeting fol ising up the affir of the companr, some disuns. sion ensned, and a resolution confirming that for Winding up the affairg of the company was passed. It was then determined to returm lld. per shbre on thoe 33,190 shares in the company. The sum of 501. was voted to the Secretary for his services, and it ws stated that ano- 1 ther meeting would be called to decido on what should bo done with the balance that might remain after the aff*irs were wound up. The meeting then Eeparated.
ZiTATE UP TBADE. 3MA&NCaESTER 8ug-r 25, TI a comparative inotivity noticed on Tuesday is quite as marked this morning, and, though prioes are nominally unchanged, sellers are not demanding the extreme prices lately asked. Still many kinds of yarn aud cloth ate so low in stock, and the makers are so well supplied with orders for them, that there is great firmness in sotne cases, and this is to be expected. China shirtings of 71b. to $jib. weight are in some demand at full rates, and printed cottons are not likely to be cheaper with tho present demand, their in. creased cost not de__ending upon dearness of cotton alone, bnt the increased cost of indigo, coechineal, and other dye. stuffs.

THE RLSTORATrON OF DROWNED PERSONS. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The oolumns of your journal not unfrequently contain the particalars of many dreadful accidents from drowning, and on repeated occasions these aecidents are attended with loss of life. The one narrated last Saturday was of this description, and unhappUy its results were disastroas in more than an ordinary degree. Your readers wil readily recall to mind the sad catastrophe which occurred at Dunbar, whereby a father and three children perished in this manner. My object In thus addressing you on this subject is to direct attention to a method of restoring life to the apparently drowned which is not so well known to the non-professlonal public as, in my judgment, it deserves to be, for it more commonly happens that those persons present, when the bodies of the drowned are first taken out of the water, are of this class, and much delay as commonly intervenes before the assistance of any profersional authority can be obtained. I allUdo to the method so strongly advocated by the late talented physician and physiologist Dr. Mar. shall Hall-a method at once simple and efflcacios. In the medical profession this is known as "tho ready method of Dr. Marshall Hall," and may not inapUy be regarded as his last legacy to the cause of suffering humanity. AU testimony hitherto is decidedly in its favour, and therefore I think that its mode of apli cation should be widely known to the publio at large. This method needs no appsratus; all that is required being that tho body of the drowned person, bo it man, woman, or child, bo placed upon Its chest and abdomen, with the arms under its forehead, and then turned from side to side, as one would roll a winecask or beereask in process of cleansing; but, of course, more slowly and gently, and continuing this rotary motion until full inflation of the langs shall bavo taken place. Your educated readers acquainted with the puinciples of natural phUosophy, and at the same time, having any knowledge of the structure of the bony and cartilaginous chest in which is contained the lungs, wil at once perceive the reasons on which is founded the advocacy of this simple methaod for the recovery of persons apparently drowned. I cannot but think as weU as hope that much human life will be saved whenever Dr. M. Halls method shall become moro extensively "own and ado ptedL I am. Sir, your obediont ea,vant Al.
