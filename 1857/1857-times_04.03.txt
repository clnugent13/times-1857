The business of these assizes was brought to a close at a late bour last night, with the exception of one cause, involving a question of pedigree. As the witnesses in this case were very numerous, and it was not likely to be concluded in less than two or three days, Mr. Justice Wiles has signified his intention of returning to this town to try it after the close of the Glocester assizes.
CHAPMAN V. TEE MIOiOJTHsHrE RAThWAY A.-ID
CANAL COMPANY.
Mr. Keating, Q.C., Mr. Phipson, and Mr. H. Matthews appeared for the plaintiff and Mx. Whateley, Q.C., Mr. Grg, and Sir Thomas Phillips for the defendantQ.
e plaintiff in this action, Richard Chapman, was the lessee of apublichouse called the Three CupS, situate in Canal-paraae, Newpor+, and he sued the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal ompanytorecover the sum ofI1Oi10s., which mad been awarded to him as comPensation by a jury under the 68th section of the Lands Clauses Act. IThe declazation alleged that the plaintiff was entitled to the house in question for the residue of a term of years; that by the executiout of the defendants' worlk and the construction oftheralwaYthepLldntFshousewasinjurioul yaffectea, and he was entitled to compensation; that he gave notice to the defendants of his house having been injuriously affected in several respects,-vz, by the obstruction of a footway necessary to the occupation of the house, by the obstruction of a cartway in like manner necessary, by the obstruction of windows in the house, and by various nuisanoes1 such as the shaking of the walls and noises, dirt, and smoke, caused by the train and engines; that the plaintiff gave notice of his desire to have the compensation for such injuries assessed by a jury- that such inquisitiox was accordlingly held, at the Acose of which the jury by their verdct awarded three several sums,-viz., 401 for the obstruction of the cartway, 201. s. for the obstruction of the footway, and 451. for the depreciation of the property by Icss of trade and obstruction of light and air, &c., since the construction of the railwav. The declaration then alleged that the verdict and inqisition had been duly recorded, but that the amounts recovered hua not been paid by the defendants. The only issue raised was by a, traverse of the house being injuriosily affected by the
exercise of the defendantsW powers within themeann of the Lands Clauses Act,
As soon as the plaintiff's case was opened,
Mr. Justice WuI.As expressed his opinion that the inquisition of the sheriff's jury was suffcient evidenoe to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict; the present ury could not try over again what had already been tried by the sheriff's jy. Vhen the nqWisition wasp ut in he (Mr. Justice willes) vwould bear wbat the defendants hrA to say.
This being accordingly done,
Mrr. W3st' lKir GrY, and Sir T. PHILLIPS took several exoeptions tohis Lordshifs ruling. The chief points were that the sheriff's jury had jurisdietcon only to inquire into the amount of dmge, and that tWeir verdict was no evidence on the subjeot of title to compenation, or title to the ways alleged; that the obstection of pnblic ways must 'peproved to be within the powers of the defendants, or else
it was a wrongful act, and therefore mawtter for an aion or indictmentt and not fior compensation, and that there could be no night to eompensation in reepect of the user of the raiway but only ill repect of the eriginal pernanent
Mr. Justice WInuws said he should direct the jury that thep!,aintiff was entitled to reoover. The intentin of the Legslaurewa tht te fndng f teaheriff' jury ahould befial.It as povied hat her shuldbe'no certios.tri
t- Thlejury then, underhisLordships diroctioi, found for arranged that the ef nanb should apply to the Court oI
ExcllesFer for a new trial, on the'sround of miadircci( in Or g the objection; and th irs the event ofaniw triabeing refeed thy should be at liberty to appeal, i if they ha tnded a bil of exceptions.

eizaLbth Oram, aged 44, wa charged 'with the whiful murder of her own son, George Williams, on the 10th of Dchember, 186, at BOdwelty.
Mr. Huddleston appueoad for the prosecution; - Mr. Baett defended the DOitoneiO.

The g enbed,p trieor o rthe bmontheo August, 185, hawd been living wit his grandmother, in Pembrokephir, bit in that month he came to live with his motheri and vtepfather at Bedwelty. A.that time the deassadsed aa healty boy, but oon ater he ame home to his m6therohe began to jet thin andlowealy, which thec witnee ai suthibu p tho insfficient s food ahhd the bnkind bettretme t threeived from thsepriscueri She trate ter legtimate children with kindness,

yevdhlsl ittle fooddit that eoft tasked food of a neighur who reteveh his iridts. E On one occasion the pritoner lef t her home with her other two children, and was absent several weeks, and during that time a neig'hbour ttended on her husbman and the child. He then weaemd to thrive and get well, but as soon sas the prisoner cameo home he relapsed and got thin again The prisoner was several times spken to on the subject, and always :flew in a 'violent passion, and said she wished' the child was dead. InL September last she sent for a doctor, and the doctor andl his assistant attended the child several times, until it died oni the 10th of December. It was suffering from relaxed bowels, irretention of urine, and fever, which at the time the doctor thought was symptomatic of gastro'enteritis, and prescribed accordingly. But it did naot appear that he suspectedl the child was being stared till after its death, He then hteld a post morem, exa-mination of the body which he said left no doubt upon. his mind that the child tad been starved. The only sign of disease he could discover were some old adhesions of t-he pleura, the result of pleurisy. Several witnesses deposed to the violent temper of the prisoner, and one of them proved that 20 mnonths before his death sheosaw the deceasied covered with bruises, which the child said was owing to his maother bea=ting him with a strap with a buckle on it. About 14 wes before his; death tlie same witness sAw the prisoner kick the child, and heard her swear that she would b~e the death of him. She also spoke to other acts of cruelty of the like kind, and said that on one occasion 'when she expostvsilted with her, and told her she would be the death of the child. the prisoner utsedl some horrid expressions, and ran after hier and kicked ker. The excuse given by the prisoner for beating the chid always was that his habits were dirty, and that he gve so much trouLble to washi his clothCes and linen,-- a fat which was not disputed.
Mr. B~ARRETT addressed the jury for the pioner, and contended it 'was mucLh more likely that the childhdie from dise-ase than from starvation.
Mr. Justice Wrwgs, in smming up the evidence, sad he should have been better satisfied if there hiad been some mnedical evidence ina addition to that of the doctor who had attended the deceased.'HMs Lordship left is to the jury to

Mr. Holland, an at-torney., uf Upton, who was acting for theplaintiff, sated that the'lder defendant had agreed to meke theendorsement for eZ., but this was positively denied by Mr. Winterbotham.

Gentlemen,
yOU yesterday elected :re your representative in
the House of Commons by unlverralaufrrags.
Acting on the advice of my most active friendsi, I resolved so far as the Dreseut election is conerned, to be content with that honour and to proceed no further in the contest.
I thank yoa sincerely for the show of hands; not maerely as an honourcoouferred upon myself, but as an important proof that the great principle of wocalrefosm, of wbteh I was there the humble exponent, though striking, at the very root of deep-seted habit, is not unacceptable to the indusistous muasses.
Fresenting myself before you withina,few days of the Election,Ifound imany of my friends already Tledged to other candidates, and the, with an honourable flzrmness should have been asbhamedto atteespt to shako, declared themselves unable to withidraw fromn the promises thyhag madpe,zn ambition to sere In this contest. I endeavured distinctly to state, that If sely other candidaLte would express sentiments simlar to my own, I would stand asde ; but that otherwise I would pursue the contest to-the Jut. When, therefore, I became aware las I did at the last moment), that Mr. Ricardo and the Hou. Mr. Cower were both fully in favour of 1 an inquiZ7 ialo Maine lAw Legilation and Its rebuts." and that they estlygly agreed withx the'desIrbUIlty ot allowing 1 the introduction into, and discusion of, a permissive bill in the House of Commona"'-tbis being the policy! mysielf advocated-I felt that honour and discretion alike dictatedi my retirement; I . therefore, declined to go to the poll.
I a-, heoever, uode. waoeh sueesseant for the fuiture , and, as the cordiality with which you have greeted me, and the reiitsl of a partial canvass, emnbolden me to believe that, had I beenx earlier In the tield, I might have entertained reasonable hopes of succesi I eball look forward with expectation to the next opportunity whent I may be able again to solicit your kindness, and to* give to my friends, free from party engagements, the opportunity of registering their votes at the poll on behalf of our mutual prinelifcs; Indifferent alike to the my of
"Liberal party' on the one, or Conservative interest" on th5 other.
Isicrl trust that the reult of this election may be the advanceme.nt of sond principles of political morel and social refrrm, and, above all, of the great question of a afaina U; for Englanud,
Irmi,Gnlmen.

Thursday Evening.
The Bank of England have raised their rate of discount to-day from 6 per cent., at which it had stood since the 18th of December, to 61 per cent.
Tho measure created general sirprise, although the gold withdrawals and the extreme pressure for discounits d(uring the past week might have suggested its probability. The next Gazette returns will, it is believed, prove that the decision is in harmony with recent precedents. Those who are dissatisfied with it urge tbat, as the payment of the dividends will shortly take place, and thero is also a prospect of good supplies of gold and silver from Australia and MIexico, and of the drain for the Bank of France and India diminishing, a delay of a week or two should have been allowed. The true policy of the Bank, however, is not to trust to contingencies in any case, and in the face of a removal of half a million of bullion in the course of a few days, not for any exceptional and temporary object, but to meet requirements from France, Brazil, India, China, the Cape of Good Hope, and the West Indies, there was certainly no reason for hesitation. It is true there are grounds for assuming that this unfavourable state of our balances with foreign countries cannot much longer continue, since, if our extraordinary trade is really sound and profitable, its profits, unless they are dispersed by an extravagant expenditure, must some day exhibit themselves; but the most experienced persons have now for several weeks looked confidently for a turn, and have found only that the pressure is increasing. Still, should the anticipation of a more easy period be suddenly realized tho Bank are not tied to their present rate even for a single week. That in adopting it they have not gone beyond the point which the natural condition of the market dictated has already been proved by the fact that the demand this afternoon at 6i per cent. has shown scarcely any falling off.
The increase announced to-day applies alike to discounts and to loans upon securities.
The discount establishments have increased their allowance for money at call from 5i to 51 per cent. The rate of the joint-stock banks for deposits will b3 65 per cent.
Consols opened heavily this morning at a decline of an eighth, in consequence of apprehensions that the Bank might decide upon some alteration in the rate for advances on stock, and when, after a long sitting of the Court, it was announced that a rise of a half per cent. had been ordered on all descriptions of isecurities a further fall took place, from which, however, there was an ultimate rally. The first transactions were at 93J to i, and, after having touched 930, the price returned to 93j to J for. money and 93i to 94 for the 7th of May. The general transactions of the day were unimportant. Bank Stock left off at 220 to 222; India Stock, 222 to 224; India Bonds, 4s. to ls. discount; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
Foreign securities opened with firmness, but sale3 having been pressed there was subsequently a decline. The market was generally weak, and prices in the later hours experienced little recovery. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 97i, for the account, 98, 97i, a, and g. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were ptirchased at I01I, i, and 1006. Mexican was heavy at 23k, k, and J for the account. The other business comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 100; Buenos Ayres, 855; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 761, 77, and 77k; the Three per Cents., for the account, 54i ex div.; Portuguese Three per Cents., for the account, 45k; Russian Five per Cents., 105; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95; Sardinian Five per Cents., for account, O0N; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 41i; the New Deferred, for account, 251 ; Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97 ex div.; and Peruviaa Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Dollar Bonds, 57.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were G9f. 95c. for money and 70f. 65c. for the new account at the end of the month, showing a further decline of an eighth. The demand for money in connexion with the liquidation just concluded has been extremely severe, and upwards of 8 per cent. has been freely paid.
The expediency of the Bank being guided in their discount arrangements by the amount of their bullion and the state of the money-market, instead of pausing to see if certain things may not happen to render a change unnecessary, has been illustrated in the results of their downward movement in December last. That step was much criticized at the time, because many persons thought it would have to be retraced in a week or two, and the public were charged with having clamoured impatiently for relief. On the opposite side it was argued that the Bank should be guided day by day solely by the facts before them at the moment, and not by any conjectures, however rational, as to the course of future events. The experience of that ease has since shown how deceptive such conjectures may prove. The reduction occurred nearly four months ago, and intil to-day no alteration has been found necessary, the interval of freedom from change having been considerably beyond the usual average.
It appears that the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Simla, under charter to the European and Australian Royal Mail Company, arrived at Melbourne on the 6th of January, after an unprecedented run of 55 days from Southampton, including a stay of five days at St. Vincent. The distance from Southampton to Melbourne being 12,700 miles, she must have averaged 254 miles per day. The Simla was due at Suez on the 24th ult. with advices from Melbou-ne to the 15th of February, and should she have kept the contract time telegraphic intelligence by her viQ Marseilles may be expected on the 6th inst.
A meeting of the Australian Agricultural Company was held to-day to consider the report of the committa of ihareholders expoaing its recent mismanagement. Mr. De Salis, on behalf of the committee, alluded to the discouraging position of the company, and suggested reformation, although not an entire change of direction, An infusion of new members would be necessary, and, as the favourable consequences of the introduction of colonial experience had already been apparent, it was in that direction he looked for a modification. The
appointment of CaDtain Brownrigg had been a grievous error. Witfh respect to the accounts, particularly those from the colonies, they presented a confused appearance; but, as it was believed that little good would result from an expensive professional examination it was proposed that Mr. Coleman's duty should be limited to arranging a clear and simple form to be adopted in future. One grave charge the committee made against the directors was that of withholding the report of Mr. White on the state of the stock, which, however unfavourable, should, it was contended, have been communicated to the shareholders. l'he disbursement on road-making had also beenimprovident, and not calculated to advance the proper developement of the company's estates. Towards retrieving the past mischief Mr. De Salis proposed the suspension of all unnecessary outlay, and the closing of the capital account, by leasing the coal mines,, which may be safely done so as to secure a fixed income unaccompanied by risk. He also contended for a reduction of the large outlay for general management, and the adoption of measures to introduce a population on the property by selling small allotments or granting leases with the option of purchase. At the same time he wished it to be understood that he did not take a despairing view of the
company, believing that its resources are still great. The Governor, in reply, complaned of the comnsiets made by the public journals in comparing this company with the Royal British Bank, the I Z0n and Eastern B3anking Company, and other
disreputable establishments, and further that the report, which was professedly from a coinmittee of consultation, had not been Bubmittted to the directors previousto publication. The recommendations of the committee had, in fact, already been antici, pated, and retrenchment was being exercised both at homeandin the colony. Ithad been stated that the capital of tae company (380,0001.) had been wasted, but the undertaking was originallystarted inl821-25, and it was for the cultivation and improvement of waste lands, an arrangement being made to employ convict labour. Part of the contract was that roads should be constructed and buildings erected. Having secured a free grant of 1,000,000 acres thbrough the outlayof a great portion of their capital, they were enabled, when the alteration was produced by the Australian gold discoveries, to sell 300,000 acres to the Peel Rtiver Company for 500,C001., by which the whole of the proprietors benefited, showing a return of 120,0001. over tbe full amount of subscribed capital. Since that period dividends had been paid which made the total nearly 150,0001. With respect to the property itself, there remained after the sale of the 300,000 acres 700,000 acres at Port Stephens and Liverpool-plains, in addition to 4,000 acres at Newcastle. Putting the value of the land at Port Stephens and Liverpoolplains at 8s. per acre, and the other at 301. per acre (the last sale having been at 3e31.), it would give 120,0001., and taking the colliery plant, buildings, &c., at moderate estimates it would still show a total of 525i,0001. In explanation of the charge of withnholding the report of Mr. White respecting the stock, it was stated that, as the directors wvere then about to add to the board Mkr. Hamilton, a person of great colonial experience, it was not considered desirable to bring it before the shareholders, since they had not obtained hisviews3onthe subject, andpublicity might have prejudiced the sales in the colony. With regard to the appointment of Captain Browrnritgg although he was a relative of the deceased Governor, the selection was made by a special committee, who gave the question serious attention. Captain Brownrigg, it wvas true, had failed, but it was iu the crisis of 1847, and hle did not take office in the company until 1852, he having meanwhile held the postion of Filag-Lieutenant under Admiral Gage, and being at the date of his nomination Colonial emigration ag,ent at Glasgow. His course had not given satisfaction, and it had been found requisite to dispense with his services, but the directors originally thought they had secured an eligible offlcer, combining mercantile acquirements with a knowledge of land and emigration arrangements. Some of his coal speculations had been unfortunate, but others had proved successful, and, although the board were not desirous of justifying his conduct, they wished to state the whole case. The London expenses hadl already been reduced, and the board of directors was about to be cut down hy Actof Parliament from 12 to 6. The boardin every way had endeavoured to discharge their duty, and, as they and their friendsheldalargeportionof theshares of the company, its want of success was a great pecuniary disappointment to them. This explanation did not seem to give much satisfaction, and 3Ir. De Salis, who in the early proceedings had moved the adoption of the report, said he should urge it strongly, unless the board were prepared to admit their error of judgment, and allow an infusion of new members. The Governor refulsed to accept such a condition, and, contending that the directors had exercised their best judgment, intimated that if the report were adopted the wvhole of the board would iinnediately resign. A long discussion then ensued, in wFhich the committee repudiated the intention of casting any imputation upon the honour or integrity of the directors; but several proprietors alleged as a singular circumstance that one of them should at the time Mr. WYhite's despatch was withheld have reduced his stake in the company by l]000 shares. It was a-lso complained that while Captain Brownrigg was applauded in the public reports the directors, according to their deapatches, were dissatisfied with his proceeding, although they had raised his salary 2501. a-year. The services of the Governor, as well as of Mr. Hamilton and Sir Minto Farqulhar, were admitted to be valuable, but it wvas said that,instead of reducing clerks and others in the employ of the company, the allowance of 2,0001. a-year to the directors ought to be diminished. After Mr. Ellis had spoken on behalf of the committee, and Mr.
Haiton had alluded to the position of the accounts,and stated ashis opinionthatthe directors had done too much, instead of too little, and consequently fettered the hands of the executive in the colony, it was proposed to move an amendment to the adoption of the report. Sir Minto Farquhar, in order to place a seat at the disposal of the proprietors, so that parties of colonial experience might be admitted, retired. Mr. Smith, M.P., Mr. Parsons, and other shareholders having spoken with the view of effecting a reconciliation between the directors and the committee, the amendment was eventually withdrawn, and it was agreed to receive the report, with special thanks to the committee for the information they had afforded, it beingunderstood that when the board of directors is reconstructed vacancies will be open for the introduction of new members. The Governor announced that he had now in his possession numerous resignations, which when the board is reduced to six will allow of the desired ehange.
The White Star from Melbourne has brought 20 000 ounces of gold, valued at 80,0001.
iPhe M.~elbourne has arrived from China with 224,7001b. of tea.
It is stated that Colonel Waugh, one of the directors of the London and Eastern Bank, who obtained advances from that concern to the extent of 237,0001., has retired with his family to the continent.
A t the Court of Banlrruptey to-day the examination of Mr. S. Adams, banker, of Ware and HIert-. ford, was again adjourned.

ne nalt-Yearly meeting of this company was held oa Ernday at Perth, Mr. Bruce in the chair.
The report, an abstract of which has appearod iu The Times, was taken as reada
The CHAIRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said it was very satisfactory that they were enabled to give the shareholders an increased dividend at the rate of 5. per cent. per annum. There was an unavoidable increase in the capital account during the half-year of 21,000!. to provide additional accommodation for the traffic, particularly at Stirling, which was now an important place and formed the tetmini of many lines. The works on the Denny branch were progressing, and would soon be completed, Matters connected with the working arrangement between them and the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Railway Company were still under negotiation, and it was not esirable to discuss the subject until the negotiations at present going on were concluded. The agreement had been hitherto beneficial to both companies. Ere stated that the Caledonian Railway Company were hostile to the Scottish Central, although the latter had endeavoured to make peace with them. They hoped, however, that some satisfactory arrangement would be concluded.
Mr. DAviDsoy, on behalf of himselE aud the Marquis of Breadalbane, handed in a formal protest against the Bill containin,' permissive powers to sanction the agreement between tie Scottish Central and the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Railway Companies, on the ground that the Bill had not been sanctioned by the shareholders, that the working agreement was inadequato and prejudicial to the interests of the company, that the division of the net earnings and working expenses between the two companies was inequitable, and that the accounts .ormed in terms of the i agreement ought not to be approved by the meeting.
A long discussion ensued as to the correctness of the accounts stated in the report, and it was eventually agreed that the directors should print and circulate among the shareholders the exact data upon which the agreement had been worked, and on which two half-years' accounts, ending July and January last, had been formed.
The report was then adopted, with the exception of that portion relating to the details of accounts betwoen the two

The report of the direotors of this comDany states that the outlay on capital account during the past half-year has been 213,4261. This forms a portion of the total sum of 444,3991. estimated to complete the main line and Provide additional rolling stock. The net revenue for the haf-year after deducting interest on loans and adding balance from laIt account, amounts to 14S,8961, which is equal to a dividend a. the rate of more than 10 per cent, per annum on the share capital; but out of this has to be paid to Government the half-yearly sum of 14,0831 as a sinkdng fund to provide for the redemption of the Government loan, lea ing 134,813!. available for dividend, out of which the dir.c
tors recommend the payment of a dividend at the rate ot 9 per cent per annum, which will absorb 130,2.8., and leave 4,575!. The gross revenue for the half-year amounted to 393S80!. showing an increase over the correeponding period of the preceding year of 62,118!. The working ixpenses amounted to 194,408!. The gross traffic for the year ending 31st of January, 1857, amounted to 749,6311., and for the preceding year to 581,4551., showing an increase of 168176 The orainary working expenses for the half-year ening 31st of January amounted to 185,616!., or47 per cent. of the receipts, being 6s. per train mile. The ordinary working expanses for the half-year ending 31st of January, 1856, amounted to 163,595!, or 493 per cent., being at the rate of 6s. 33d. per train mile. The average weekl arn

The chi.rge for renowal of rails, sleepers, &c., has arnounted to 8,7931. currenoyaa against 2,195!. currency during the pt.-- vious-half-year,whichcharge ill be somewhat increasoi for some time by the necesty of replaing a portion of the rails. The locomotive expenses are at the rate of Is. 7d, PR mile rum. The charge in this department has been ten4eredheavybythe very severe weather during December and J&;tary. The breaking of wheels, tires, axles, and 1 i4t3 jf pt tnl =hinerr, nearl' jll cafused-
by the extreme degree of cold, has been of daily occurrence, and far greater than uriing any previous winter. The extent of repair bas, iD Consequence, been unusually la2te. The directors 'ntertain hopes that when the Detroit and MIlwaukie 1ailway is opened the coalfields in the State of Michigan will supply i cheaper and more efficient fuel for locomotive parposes than the wood DOw used. TDe ex. cessive cold renders the roadway very rigid and unyieldink, and this has of necessity a,serious effect upon the machinery, which by the extremefroatis made very brittle and liable to breal. The directors have concluded arrangementsfor the sale of the steamers Canada and America. The payment for them is made in shares of the Detroit and Milvaukie Railroad Company. These shares bear interest from the 1st of January last at the rite of 7 per cent. until the openingof the entire line. The revenue account of the steamers is therefore Dow closed, aad when tho Detroit and Mfilwaukie shares are sold the proceeds will go in reduction of the ori. ginal cost of the vessels. The directors are considering t!le expediency of making arrangements for paying off the Go. vernment loan of 770,0001. sterling by tho issue of Aebea. tures bearing interest at 5 per cent. The Government ad. vanice carries interest at the rate of 6 per cent., and, besides, requires the deduction of upwards of 28,0001. correney per annum from the net revenue as a liquidation fund. The adVantage of the suggested arrangement will therefore be very great. The total expenditure on accountof the Sarniabrauch to tho 31st of January last was 272,7331. currency. The works are progressing satisfactorily. The amount expended ontbe line from Preston to Guelph-a part ofthe Galt and Guelph line-is now 70,4081. currency, and as soon as the weather will permit the rails 'Wil be laid and the line opened for traffic. The Galt and Guelph Company, for whom this coanpgny is constructing the ane, issued their farst mortge bon for the amount expended by this company. TheO
bords carry interest at 6per cent., and are redeemable in 20 years. The directors congratulate the proprietors on the Wenproved posiion 'which the company has succeeded in seu rg durnag the last si months, and upon the prospect of further improvement by the eompletion oE valion u won. werting lines nowin course oE eonstruotion o
JEDBI1XRGK.
the half-yearly meeting. of this companywas held on Wednesday at Jedbuzgh, Mr. J. Ord in the chair.
The secretary read the report, wthich htatd that the undertaling was now completea, and that the line and worki were n the possession of the directors of the North British tailway Company, in terms of -the workng agreement, and the 'hole concern 'was no under their management. the accounts and clains of the contractor had notrfet bwen given in or adtusted, ndm the compensation to onevlandownr rem ained for in al settleme ant, but thi dites. thrs bwould spare eno exertions to close the capital accountas soon as possible. The directors considered Ithe result of the traffic had fully borne out their favourable anticipations and they 'were sanguine that the trafic would increase wthen the resources of the line 'were fully' developed, and tat it would prove a safe and valuable investment. The balance on revenue account amounted to 842., which would enable the directors to propose a dividend at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, which would absorb 4511. and leave 3911. Bnt, as there were several claims falling on revenue not yet charged, and as a more complete statement would be made out after a year's experience, when the wholo expense of the railway and works would be ascertained, they advised the sbareholders to declare no dividend at present, but to carry over the whole balanoe of 8421. to the credit of next half-year. A proposal had been made to the directors to erect the telegraph between Roxburgh and Jedburgh upon very favourable terms, but until the whole expense of t he rauwayand works was scertainedtheywere ratheravqse to enter into any newengagement. The directors regret they are, not yet able to report more favourably of the liberality of the Post-office authorities in regard to the transit of themail-bags along the company's line. The capital account showed that 46,3921. had been received, and 39,387 expended, leaving a balance of 7,0041. The revenue account showed that i,831e. had been received during the half-year ending the 3ist of January, and 9S84. expended, leaving a balance of 8431;.
On the motion of the CHaIBiUI d the report was adopted, -and the retiring directors 'were re-elected.

The ernpi (except just at the beginning of the first movement) were precisely what they should be; and the entire symphoiy afforded unmitigated satisfaction. -Sm h a performance cf such a work was in itself a concert.
3iozart's serenade is one of the posthumous works in the -wv11-known catalogue of M. Andrae, from whom it was obtained by the directors of the Leipsic Gewandhaus cos.- ,certs, where it was perforrmed with emiinent success the year befofre last. It is composed for two oboes, two clarinets,
two corni bassetti, two bamsoons, one double bass, and four hlorrs. The st3le is generally light, at times bordoring almost upon triviality; but it is interesting, and must -alnays be interesting, as a relic of one of thegreatestof masters. The serenade was very finely executed by AlessFs. Barret, Crozier, Williams, Godfrey Maycock, iFgerton, liausser, Anderson, Howell, C. Harper, S;arden, Mann, and Hooper, and received with enthusiasin by the audience. We cannot but think, never-tbeess, that it would have been more consistent with the stai.ding and dignity of the New Philharmonic Society to give the newly-discovered composition of such a master as :r viart " in its integrity"-as the term goes-or not at all. TMhe omission of various movements -was injudicious for .more reasons than one, and especially since it prevented tbhie previously unacquainted with the serenade, and at the same time competent to understand its merits, from forming u.lay clear notion of it as a whole. Mozart, even in his least aubitious works, never wrote without a well-considered purpcse, and to present anything from his pen in a mutilat d form is neither more nor less than to deprive his attentive hearers of the possibility of contemplating the defi.
iCe plan w hich existed in the mind of the musician before ^cnsigning a noto of his composition to paper. The New Phulharmonic Society, with its pretensions t-o classicism, no less than to catholicism in art, should be tho last to encou:rage such derelictions fromn strict artistic principle.
The pianoforte concerto in G minor of Mendelssohn may almost be said to havo been improvised. A Mdlle. Staudach, from Vienna, bad been announced to play, but at the -eleventh hour was not forthcoming. The result was on appeal to Mr. John Barnett, the youthful mephew of the celebrated English composer of the same n3ame, who, as pnpil of Dr. Wylde, had more than o,nce distingugished hmself at the concerts of the New Phillbarmonic Society. Ir. (or "Master," as he has been hitherto called) Barnett, like a genuine musician, wvasready wit h a concerto at a moment's notice, and performed the G
nnor of Mendelssohn (vrithoat book) in so animated and rrlll:ant a manner as to win the unanimous applause of the -tudience, and a recall at the concltsion. To thus much of
ianqualified prais, however, we have, in all sincerity, to aed a brief protest. MIr. Barnett must do his best to avoid falling into a habit of expression which is neither natural ner agreeable. His caaatl.ile phrases are often disfigured Ity certain exaggerations of accent and kempo, which very *oiztn ntaterially intet-fere wvith the rhythmical flow of the music. This is a dangerous error in a young artist, ajad, Jf not summnarily checked, may become ineradicable. blUr. Barnett is so clever and so promising that :a X crd of bonest counsel wiLl be more likely to benefit h.lic than otherw,ise. he has the instinct and natural faciliiy that eventually may make of him a great performer, aid Enust be careful not to throw such gifts away by apathetically gliding into a wrong path. He is also young enongh to correct any bad habits lie may have formed, and, being eidently enthusiastic about his profession, will, we have littlc doubt, take this hint as it is meant-for his o.n good, and not with any desire to detract from those quties thlat,have already g..ined for him a certain reputationamong those vwho regard with interest every new promise of risng anri-ical talent.eg
I he singer on Wednesday night was Madame Gassier,
ue chaste and highly-finished reading of *"Batti, Batti," wl-n her the universal approbation of good judges, and tL. hearty plaudits of the audience.
Vr. Wylde has at length taken upon himself the undiided responsiblity of the conductor's postwhich he should have done long since. It is very gtgierally know that he founded and organized tho New Pbilharmonic Society, and that to his unassisted efforts its eatatence as an established and recognized institution is maiiilv due. Tho system of dividing the conductorship is radically bad-as the old Philbarmonic Society foand out afttr a long series of years, and that Dr. Wy1de is fully cal-able of the position he has now assumed was proved by the very remarkable perfonnance of Beethoven's L?Yoioa symuilhony on the present occasion.
Chinese Emigrants.
CHINEM BMIGBA1TS.
TO THlE EDITOR OF THB TIMES.
Sir,-The letter on the subject of Chinese emigration to 1tho island of Cuba whioh you kindly inserted in The Tames of the 18th ult. has brought me several private communica. tions of interest and value, besides those which you have pub]ished through tho medium of Tle Times.
A-9 far as they rolate to British Guiana and our own West Indian possessions, these letters give conourrent testimony -to the generally favourable condition of the coolies introduced from tho East Indies and China. It is satisfactory to know that both the colonial Government and the colomists themselves are studious to avoid any participation in the frightful evils which attend the employment of coolie 1abour under Spanish rule. Some are disposed to complain of Sir John Bowring as impeding emigration from China to -the British possessions by the humane restrictions ho has
.thought it necessary to impose. From various sourcos I Lave very strong evidence of the high esteem in which the <Chinese labourers are held rnd of the industry they manifest, a fact which my own observation of the race in Cuba *-on6rms; and at a special sitting of the colonial Legislature of British Guiana, held last December, a resolution was passed with a view to promote a systematic emigration from ,Cbina, under wise and humane restrictions.
With this gratifying testimony, however, in relation to our own possessions in the West Indies, I have gained ac. cumulated evidenco of a most painful kind as to the sufferings of tho Chinese emigrants in other parts. I do not dosire to add more on the subject of Cuba. Mercy to tho Chinaman can secarcely be looked for in a country which, notwithstanding the treaty with our own Government, conitinues on a very large scale to cGrry on the slave trade, and 1ihe soil of which was rocently reddened with the blood of thousands of negroes who were whipped to death by the 3gents ofthe Government, to oxtort from them confession; :s to their supposed participation in a conspiracy of the white population. Slaveowners in Matanzas have themtelves confessed to me that in 1844 their streets ran wih snegro blood--a strange, but summary method, certainly, for the Government to hold in check the master by tho wholesale slaughter ofthe slave. It is vain to speak of tho humane 3aws of Caba, in relation both to slaves and free labourers, in the face of facts which show that these laws aro never regarded. In 'spite of the treaty with the British Govern. =ent, the coloured population has increased by probably 100,000 through direct importation since that treaty was entered into. The Africans brought into Ravanna by our *cruisers, instead of entering upon a three years' apprenticeship, preparatory to freedom, aro handed over to actual 'lavery; and the Chinese, to whom the regulations gua. x:ntee a large amount of liberty and protection, under the smame of free labourers, live and die in a slavery, if possible, ;et more grievous.
The communications I have received, however, make me anxious to draw especial attention to the Chinese emigratiou to the west coast of South America. I cannot in this instance speak of that which I have personally witnessed, but the information that has reached me leads to the ineor. -ence that the Chinese labourors at the guano islands are saubjected to frightful evils. The mortality exhibited among them is perfectly appalUing, and sufficiently indicates the wretchedness of their condition. As in Cuba, suicide in every form is reported to be of daily occurrence. Of tha 3nazy thousands that have left China within the last few years it is not supposed that one-half aro now in life. Altogether, tho accountsfrom South America are sohorrible that I could not have believed their possibility had I not witnessed tho same state of things in Cuba.
I refer here especially to the condition of the coolies in Peru itself. On the subject of theirtransport thither it will he sufficient that I remind you of the recent advices from Manil!, by which It appears that on board of one vessel the Waverley, of BostDon, on her voyage from China to the Chincha Islands, upwards of 240-some reyort nearly 300-of tha coolies perisabed through suffocation. Such inhusnanitynecessarilydefeatsBteltf. Butthereoughtsurelyto -exist some better check than the pecuniary loss or the punishment that may follow so glaring an instance.
Even under British regulations, notwithstnding the Pas. zenger Act (18th and 19th of Victoria, cap. 104), it appears Ihat much needless suffering has been endured in many instancesby the Chinese emigrants to Australa, although the -voyage is one of so short duration. The instances appear to be exceptional in which the Chinese are treated n the .-me manner with other passengers.
If our Government cannot interfere to protect the coolie in a country belonging to another Power, it would surely be ;ossible to give these emigrants protection so long as they zre on ccard of BrItish ships, although on the!, way to Cuh or Peru.

BANQDITTI IN MEXICO.
TO TEB EDITOJI OF TIE TIMES.
Sir,-I enclose an extract from a letter received from Major Farrell, E.A., Chief Commissioner of the United
lexican hlining Association, de;iling an attak mada on aim aad his familv by banditti, when travelling from Mexico to Gunaaxuato, whioh you caxi insert as a paragraph if you think it worth it.
I have the honour to be, Sir, your ooedient servant.
B. BANNER.
WYoolwich, April 2.
" Gaanaxuato, Mexico.
"When on our way here last Monday, and about two leagues from Salamanca, we were attacked by banditti. Being mid-day, and nearing a town, we were lulled into security. In tho morning, before break of day, I had, for the three days Drevious, mounted the roof with my servant, both well armed. A Spanish gentleman inside had also
romised to stand by us, but we were surprised most suddeny b the well-known Spanish cry of " Alto ahi," ani cefore a minute could elapse four carbines were pointing through the window, one at my heart. I had a revolver pistol beside me, but it would have been madness under the circumstances to have made use of it, even if I could have done so. I therefore gave it up, and, watching mny opportunity, I slipped my watch and chain behind me to your mother, who did not see it, but it was promptly seized and secreted by S-. They commenced rifSing our persons, taking from me and others aU we had about us of any value that they cou]d get at, and afterwards the captain of the band ordered the luggage to be taken down, and methcdically directed some of his party to open, and the others to receive. Though they had taken my keys, our luggage happened not to be the fitst opened, and at this mnoment F-, who had had her eye- lass and chain torn from her neck, slipped round to my siddo and said, " Papa, the arms are still on the roof." I was under the impression the rascals had possessed themselves of them; however, I was not long in profiting by F-'s hint, and getting up unperceived I found my servant had hid them under cloaks, &c. He begged and entreated mo not to use them, declarinig that we should all be murdered. However, ma rifle was at my shonlder and my finger on the trioger, nd I let fly at the chief. I could have sworn I hit rim, but he did not fall, My old servant Oriope, notwithstanding his former entreaties, faithfully followed my example, Such a waking up among the gentlemen of the road was hardly ever seen. They thought we were done, and they had nothing to do but the work of spo'iation. In a moment all was terror and confusion amoDg them. The chief, however, turned round and fired his carbine at me as I ks7elt on the top of the diligence, but by the great mercy of God it missed me: then, one of their party being severely wounded, they turned aid fled, bearing him off as best they could; but before they had gone 200 yards he was seen by your mother and A- rolling in the dust and his horse loose. We had saved our baggage, and, much more, saved also our lives and poesons from further outrage, and went on our way rejoicing, and deeply grateful to Him in whose hand are the issues of life and death." Major Farrell was attacked by a large gang on the same road some three years ago, on which occasion he shot two, and but narrowly escaped with his life.
Division Of Clerical Duty.
DIVISIOi'f OF CLERICAL DUTY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Cordially coneurring with the trenchant romarks of your correspondent from the " Broad Phylactory" on the subject of clerical incapacity in the church of England, I would ask whether,with aU due respect for Mr. Spooner and Exeter-hall, we might not take a leaf out of the book of our friends and feUlow-believers of the church of Rome ?
It is well known that her system of educating and traiaing candidates for tho priesthood is as perfect as any merely human svstem can be, bat the point on which I would now principally insist is her admirable and excellentplan of division of labour. Under the Romaan system a cleric who displays a talent for pulpit eloquence is speedily promoted to a chaire, from the dignified altitude of which he may fulminate the voice of the ohurch in tones of thunder ILke our own Spurgeon. In the chsurch of England, on the contrary, the nascent MassiUon would be overwhelmed beneath a mass of what is caUed " parochial work," and his onergies as an orator would be crippled, if not destroyod.
Again, the Romish church selects hercontroversialists from the ecite of expert logicians, and never aUlows any shallowbrained, muddle-headed vicar of Fudley-cum-Pipes to endanger the doctrines of the orthodoxfaith by bis own clumsy and inartistic mothod of handling them. Once more, a priest with a turn for parish wrork would be provided by Rome with a fair field, and not be compeled to cudgelhis brains through the week in the composition of a sermon which might anticipate the efforts of Lord Shaftesbury for the restriction of the trade in opium by a'oolishing the necessity for the use of that delicious drug altogether. Now, Sir, in " enlightened England," as we are too Pharisaically apt to term it, we find ministers of the Gospel hired for some 601. or 701. a-year to set as servants of all work, engaged to do a thousand dutiss, and consequently discharging none efficiently. You remember the Yankee joke of the " busyeditor" in tho western woods, who, besides composing and editing his paper, "filled up his spare time" by rocking the baby to sleopI feeding the pigs, making tho beds, emptying the slops, and occasionaUy taking a turn at the mangle. Alas I your poor Yankee contemporary is better off than many a church of England curate. A worthy man in my own parish, engaged as curate for a stipend at which a banker's clerk would turn up hiis nose with scorn, complains to mae that, besides having a weight of purely ministerial duty which would break the back of an Atlas and dismay Hercules himself before his " labours" had oven commenced, he is expected " to make himself generaUy usoful" by acting the part of relieving-officer to all the poor, and private secretary to half the charities in the district! What with these and other "e xtras" besides, three fuU s ervices on the Sunday, several in the course of the week, the care of a few thousand siolc (who have bodies as weU as souls), and the superintendence of the National Sunday-school, I fear, Sir, that it would be a hard case to exact from this over-driven beast of burden "a register" of work and labour done. My friend complains that he hasibarely time to m*e, much loss to think out, his sermons; and yet if he be dull, prosy, or tedious (partly from fatigue, and partly from an overworked brain), he will assuredly havo him of the " Broad Phylactory" down upon him before noon on the hfonday.
Do, Sir, come over and help us; invite " Habitans in Sicco" to continue his demand for short services and unsoporific sermons; but also entreat this excellent gentleman t) contend for a division of labour among the clergy, and to demand their emancipation, moreover, from the discharge of duties which do not properly ddevolve upon them, among which I especially include the pecuniary relief of the poor, cz officio; the attendance at meetings of private charities; and, above all, the office of assistant-schoolmaster at the Sunday-schools, where, instead of studying St. Augustine or Pascal at home in his study, the composer of sermons is forced to waste hours a-week in catechizing charity children, and knocking into infant heads the elements of the Christian religion! Oh, help us! and accept the prayers of
Your very faithful brother In Criist.

Whatever might have been the faults of poor Leffler, certainly for tho last four years I never-as also the wholo of his family can vouch-saw him in any way intoxicatod, or in any way the worse for such indulgences. A more reformed man of late, both at home and abroad, can scarcely be conceived.
I trust you will allow publioity to this statement,as it is in contemplation among his old friends to get up a concert on a very large scale for the benefit of his numerous family, who are left totally unprovided for.

The Elections.
THE ELECTIONS.
wmFmx.
Yesterday the nomination ws held in the Market-placs at Brentford. The rain fell in tal7ents at the commencernent of the proceedings, but as the day wora on the weather cleared up, and the crowdincrd ed until, a' the termination of the proceedings, about 1,200 persons wera e resent. A few favours were worn by t-he friends of the respec%.-e candidates, the colours of the Liberal party being purple and orsasge, and a few of Lord Chelsea's friends wearing crimson rosettes. The proceedings were upon the whole of a very disorderly character, owing to the presence of a bodyof men withLord Chelsea'splacards round theirhats,andwearing the jackets and coats of discharged militiamen. The interruption caused by these men, who were evidently under the influence of drink, appeared to annoy Loxd Chelsea as much as his opponents, and he made one or two attempts to silence them, but without success. M. Dumas, accompanied by a party of hisfellow-countrymen, was present, and doubtless collected thematerials for another amusing sketch of our English elections. The Sheriffs of London, oirtute officii, exercise the functions, of Sheriff of Middlesex, and Sheriffs Mechi and Keats, wearing their robes and chains of office, came to the front of the hustings shortly after 10 o'clock, when the usual formalities were observed.
Mr. Sheriff MEn ihaviug entreated a fair hearing for all the candidates and their friends,
Sir WALTEI: STIRLUL G proposed Lord Robert Grosvenor, who now for the fourth time presented himself for re-election. The independence of his position and character, his long experience and activity in Parliament, his intimate knowledge and unremitting attention to their local interests, his moral worth and truth, his attachment to Liberal principles, and his practical philanthropy marked out the noble lord as pre-emninently fitted to discharge the duties of their representative, since he was one whose fidelity and hononr had stood the test of time. (Cheers and disapprobation.)
Mr. JAs. MONTGOMEY seconded the nomination, because he believed Lord Robert Grosvenor to be an honest and straightforward Liberal, who always considered the welfare of the people.
Mr. HsNRY PO%NWyALL nominated Viscount Chelsea. (Cheers and hisses). In that noble Viscounttheywould find a nobleman who was equally with Lord R. Grosvenor a friend of the labouring classes, and if they elected him he would devote the whole of his time to their service. (Hisses.) Lord Chelsea was a man equally independent in station and in judgment, and his past experience in Parliament would enable hbi to be of the utmost service to the county in its local business, which had been much neglected in former years by their representatives. (Cheers.)
Mr. R. N. POwrLmt seconded the nomiination, amid cries of " We won't have him" and uproar. He defended Lord Chelsea's vote against MIr. Locke King's motion, which would render the votes of the freeholders of the county of no consequence, and he called upon the electors to return a representative wbo would resist all the encroachments of Popery. (Cheers and disapprobation.)
Mr. J. G. EOARE nominated Mr. R. Hanbury, jn. (Cheers.) He protested, amid much uproar, against Lord Chelsea's bringing there the non-commissaioned officers of his miihtia to overawe the liberties of the people. (Cheers and confusion.) The gentleman whom he had proposed for their suffrages was a thorough-going Liberal. 31r. Hlanbury was born and bred a Liberal, and came of a Liberal stock, and he stood forward to sppport the Ifiberal principles of peace, progress, and economy. (Cheers.) If elected he vwould go to Parliament ?s the. vigorous su porter of that great man who had brought us safely through the war, and to whom Engliad owed a large debt of gratitude. (Cheers.) An exchange had been proposed between the metropolitan county and Dover, to which he could not consent, They had given Dover a good man in Mr. B. Osborne, and they would not take a bad man in exchange for him. (Cheers.) They did not want the rejected of Dover to come to Midklese,; it was not a fair exchange, and they would not have it. (Cheers.) He recommended Mr. Hanbury as a safe, steady, straight-going Englishman, who had plenty of common sense, but not such talents as would lead him into crotchets, and who would therefore work well with their other representative, Lord R. Grosvenor. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. S. MoRLEY seconded the nomination.
Lord R. GROSVENOR then presented himself, and his appearance was the signal for a storm of hisses and uproar which lasted for some time in spite of the efforts of the presiding Sheriff and of Viscount Chelsea to obtain a patient hearing for him. After various ineffectual attempts he said that he was quite overwhelmed by all these demonstrations of popular applause; but he loved-a joke-as well as they did, aud he begged to remind those practical jokers in front of him that the lst of April was passed, and that they had assembled in order to transact important business. (Uproar.) He could perfectly excuse all those noises which greeted him for seoing that in a matter which was peculiarly interestlagto the working classes ndarly the whole of the press had at one time combined to misrepresent his proposition and his motives he could not be surprised at the impatl.ace which was now exhibited; although -when on the last occasion that he addressed them from those hustings scarcely one hand had been held 'ip against him. (Cheers and uproar.) Under these altered cirCumSitimCs he was not astonished that he had incurred some unpopularity, but he trusted that he should on tlds occasion, as on all others when he had met the electors of 'Middlesex in public, be enabled to give to them so entirely. different an account of all the facts connected with the SLiiday Ti-ading Pill, which vas the subject to which he was alluding, that he should receive there as elsewherean aalmost unanimous renewal of the confidence which they bad hitherto reposed in him. (Cheers; cries of " It won't do-we won't have you-you are dead and buried," ana similar ejaculations.) If they were in favour of Lord Chelsea they could not do him a worsa service than they were doing at that moment, and he was quite certain that his noble friend would be very glad to see all those Dbis and colours removed from their hats. (This allusion to the noisy demonstrations of some discharged militiamen,whowere fantasticallyattired,and whosehatswere enveloped in Lord Chelsea' plac'ads, rather increased than diminished the hubbub. At length the noble lord continued.) In the course of his toun through the'electoral districts of Middlesex he had stated at so much length his reasons for the support or opposition which he had given to measures in Parhament since the trust of representin them had been last confided to his hands that it was not his intention to dwell upon them in any great detail at present. (Cheers.) The dust and smoke of that political conflict in the midst of which the late Parlianient had closed its eventful career had excluded from their sight and consideration almost all those social and domestic subjects which until recently had so much engrossed their attention. The last time that he remembered to have met them they were all taling about tea and'teapots - but upon the present occasion, asthough on a kindred subject, they Eeemed to have forgotten a]l about tea, and to be thinking only of the growers of it. (Cheers and confusion.) He would,;then, in the first instance, address himself tothatsubject, andthemore readily so because he believed that the vote which he had given in favour of Mr. Cobden's motion had occasionedcsome diesatisfaction to those whose good opinions he was most anxious to preserve. He was, however, perfectly willing to rest the daeence of the independent vote wbich he hadOgiven upon that subject on the speeches of those who had opposed the motion. The House of Commons had not been called upon to determine whether the Chineso Government and authorities had done everything which they ought to have done in order to carry out the treaties which they had entered into with this country; but the simple question was whether, after baving read the papers whioh were produced to show them all the circumstances surrounding the question of the war, they could come to the conclusion that the conduct of tbe Chinese Government on that occasion had been such as to necessitate the violent measures which had been bad recourse to at Canton. Now, he observed that in all the speeches which had been made by those who voted against Mr. Cobden's motion not one gentleman had ventured to assert that the affair might not have been successfully terminated without a recourse to war. (Cheers.) Moreover, he found when he read the addreessof those gentlemen, who on most other subjects were his -personal and political friends, that they admitted that the dispute might have becn settled without disturbing the peace of the country; and he observed that. not only the independent members of Parliament, but alsI some members of the Government, had actually declared t'nir opinion that sO serious a subject as a declaration of wer ought to have been referred to the Parliament and people of this country before it was resorted to. (Cheers and cnsziderable uproar and disturbance, occasioned by the introdutAion among the crowd of a small deal coffin raised upon a. long pole, and bearing the inscription "No Grosvenor." This coffiwas waved about in an insulting manner, and variuns other devices were constantly had recourso to to annoy tue eandidate and to interrupt the proceedir.gs.) Siley3co havi; - '`en partially restored the noblo lord prcceeded to sam :.- tae-e was a gentleman before him who, not sat. -it
roviding for him in life, wanted t, '- - ;. zim after he was dead. (TauSnhtr.') it wa. I ry wel that every one should have v .emento of hls nmortality, in order that he xght notic . , to what tribunal he must eventually he responsible for his actions. (Cheers.) HEe assured them, the,efere, that ho witnessed that emblem of mortalit v;ith his name on it without the smallest appre-
iension. Wben interrupted by thineipisodebhe was proded.
ing to vindicato his vote on the Chinese question, and)he would only add with regard to it that many of those who nadvoted against the motion had done so because they thought t-hat it involved the fat of Lord Palmerston's Govenmen. Nw, i hiso~,nionaudsubsequent events hadconfirmend thetruitnhof °hisview-the fate of Lord Palmerston's Govermment was not involved in that-vote on the
a uestion. In the first place, the subject had been previoulgy referred to a co-ordinate branch of the Iegislature, and that branch, though not so powerful as the other to make and iunmake Governments, nevertheless deservedly possessed great influence, and it had decided by a large
majority in favour of the Government; and, m addition to this, 30 or 40 of those members of Parliament who voted in the maijority had given their general sapport to the Governusent of Lord Palmerston before, and wone prepared, like himself, to do so again. (Cheers.} He thought, however, that the question of nvolving this countr in w and bloodshed by ou diplomatic and military agents without the most abeolute necessity -Was ex cednglyterious, and involved subjects of a socialandpolitl. calearacter so grave *b'itr3imoile foham, whatever the circumstances of .the easeha been, to have come to any other conclusion h n he did, or to have oed

ment might %e in power. He kneT very well what was the yeiialty of giving independent votes, but he had little thought that before such a constituency az that of liddle. SEx it would ever have been neceseary to vindicate inde. pendence of action and honeMy of purpose. (Cheers, and cevived interruption.) The noble lord- then went throngh s me of his political priniples, and gave a rapid sketch of bii egAtict and pUblio services, dwelUing, among other t; pies, upeti lEiS desire to extend the suffrage and to reform Parliament, upon t,he active support which he had given to Locke Kings motion, iind upon thb succesg whieh had
attended his efforts -to introduce various important clauses' lato the Ao for repressing corrupt practices at elections.
HoaLaovindicatedhimself fromthe aspersions which had been ! cast upon h-m in relation to the Sunday Trading Bill (as repcorted on a former occasion in lue Times), and having reminded the meeting of the support which he had given from the commencement to the Ten Hours Factory Acttbat great charter of the wreavers' liberty-to the BiU for abolishing the truck system, and to the Coal Wbippers AcGt, the B31st HIeavers A ct, and other popula measures, he put it to them whether heowas likely to pronossany 'measure which wrould interfere with the leisure and amuse. ments of the workng classes. He denied that he had ever done so, and declared that the Bill in question, which had been so much misrepresented, was intended and in every way calculated to promote the recreation of thepeople Having now been round to eight or ten of the poUlng dis. fricts of the county and offered explanations of the whole of his Parliamentary conduct, he was happy to state that at every meeting 'which he had attenuded, with one exception votes of confidence had been passed in him, and Sledges had been given ' to 'support him and Mr. Hanburythrcughout the contest. (Cheers, and great uproar.) Although there was a 'reat deal of clamour on that occasion, still, considering the demonstrations of popular favour with which he had bean greieted atall the meetings of electors which he had attended, he was not in the slightest degree annoyed or offended at it, because it was not the fault of those who interrupted him, but of those who had deceived them, and had wilfaully misrepresented him. He should go to the poll in the most entire confidence of retaining that proud position which he had so long occupied in the eyes of that county, and when from those hustinzs the sheriff should announce the numbers they would find that he should be their representative, aud being so, he promised them that he shoula coiitinue the same taubought, independent, reforming, prbgressive line of policy which he had pursued during the long period of 35 years in Parlia. mont. (Loud cheers, mingled with cries of " Go to Hyde Park," and other vociferous interruptions.) It was rather a remarkable thing about Middlesex that there were always three candidates in the field; but he could not help askig his noble friend 'and kinsman, Lord Chelsea, why he had allowed so long a time to elapse befora coming forward. His noble friend was a man of irreproachable character in private life, and he had always discharged tbe duties of a citizen in a most exemplary manner, but why had he delayed presenting himself until Le (Lord Grosvenor) and Mr. Hanbury-whose families had for half a century been fighting the battle of civil and religious liberty-had been round the county together, and what could they think of his noble friend and relative when they asked him what his politics were? (Cheers, and confusion.) It was a lamentable thing to see men forgetting all their antecedents and suiting their politics to the views of the constituencies which they wanted to represent. Bat such were the tactics of his noble friend and of those who actea with him Instead of bringing for. ward a good honest understandabie motion of want of confidence in the Government, they were compelled to take nD the caet off clothes of the Liberals, 6r to waitforsome wiP.1 faU in order to embarrass the Government; and to vote for a measurebrought forward by a discontented Liberal, who was a general supporter of the Administration. He did not be. lieve that the electors of Middlesex would support a man
;hose politics were of sucha chameleon hue; and, thauking the meeting for the good-temper which, in spite of a little noise, had characterized their proceedings, the aoble lord concluded by reiterating his settled conviction that lie should continue to be ene of thae represeatatives for Middlesex. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ee o Ad
Viscount CIIELSxMI was received with cheering from his friends, and groans, hisses, and cries of "Go to Dover l" from his opponents. He said he had the honour to present himself as a candidate for their suffrages, and to vindicate the right which the great Conservative body in the county bad to a share in its representation. (Cheers.) He didnot think it much concerned them to hear the reasons that had induced him to resign the representation of Dover, but as that subject had been alluded to by the proposer of Mr. Hanbury he felt bound to allude to it. He should be the last man to say anything in disparagement of the borough that for five years he had the honour of representing, bnt if he were asked for the reasoD why he had resigned that honour his presence on that hustings was, he thought, quite a sufficient answer and explanation. (" Hear, hear," and groans.) After Parliament wasdissolved he went down to Dover. (A Voice.-" They won't have you I") He called a publiec meeting of his supporters; he chaUenged them to find fault with a single vote that he had given; and he would state boldly aud without fear of contradiction that no one came forward to take up the challen- e. (Hear, hear.) He had already announced in his addrss that he stood forwvard on Conss'rvative principles, and hewas there to. day to state what those principles were. From the reception that he had met with already in different parts of the county he considered himself justiffed in saying that those priniples would meet with the approval of the electors of Middlesex. He had nothing to do with the Tories of the old schooL He did not stand there as a Tory under the reign of Queen Anne, but aS a Liberal Moderate ConDServativa under tho reign of Queen Vicoria. (Cheers.) He was a disciple of that school of politics which had been inaugurated by Sir R. Peel-one of 'the greatest statesinen that this country ever prodnced, and no one 'ff his opponents would assert that Sir I. Peel had ever made any proposal calculated to infringe upon the privileges of tho people. He had now said enough s totho past, but there was one question of recent occurrence, the China vote, which had induced the Government to dissolve Parliamerit. Lord PF Grosvenor had entered at great length into an explanation of his conduct, and he felt obliged to him, for every word his noble friend had said in his own defence equally applied to him. He did not oppose the Government from any factious
nmotive, and he believed that during the two years in which I Lord Palmerston had been in office he had given many more votes in his favour than he had recorded against him. (Cheers.) If they did him the honour to return him as their member he should conlinue to give Lord Palmerston the same disinterested support as long as he brouhbt in measures and pursued a line of policy in accordance with the Conservative principles which he (Lord Chelsea) professed. (Hear.) A great deal had been said about reform and an extension of the 'sufrage. His noble relative
ad op tnent had assumed that the party to which he belonged would bo always opposed to any attempt that might be made to extend the political liberties of the people. Nothing could be more contrary to the fact. He was not asbamed of what he had done. He had voted against M1r. Locke King's one-sided measure for the extension of the sulfiage,and he thought that of the two his noble friend was more likely to be the opponent of Lord Palmerston, and he (Lorg Chelsea) his supporter pon sdmilar questions, for his noble friend voted with Mr. Locke King, while hb'voted with the Prime Minister. Upon the subject of reform there must ari.e the question how the vAeant seats were to be fiUed up. If he had the honouYi of t seat he would do his utmost to procure one of the seats for the vast and important county of Middlesex, and in the county itself there was no district more entitled to that privilege than the district in which he resided (Chelsea). When thev recollectedcthat Middlesex ouly ieturned 17 representatives, while Lancashire, which did not exceed it in population, wealth, and intelligencee returned no lees than 37, it must be admitted that a very good case had beeh made out for the right of the metropoltan county to the vacant seats. (Hear, hear.) Whoever was at the head of the 'Governyment it would be necessary that the immediate attention of the House of Commo0s should be given to the all-important question of taxation, with a view to the adoption of every possble measure of economy and retrenchmnent. The country had got rid of the war portion of the income-tax, but there was much more to be done, and he w&s surb he should carry them with him when he proelised' them to do all he could to effect the total abohtion of that most odious and objeztionable. tax in 1860, when, aceording to the bargain mande between tho Govetnmeiit and the people, it was to ceasb' and determina altogether. (Interruption.) His noble friend had trespassed unon the time ot the menting to so great an extent (hear, hear) that he was not surprised to find their patience was exhausted. He wished, however, to advert to the state of local taxation, and tho equalization of the rates. He did nct thiafr it fair that houses and landed property should * ar thc whole weight of local taxation, and he would give l is be - consideYation to any measur'e which should have the heavily upon mnany districtsam the county, (Hear.) }He did not think the law of church-rates ought to be allowed to remain in its present state. He had voted and ould vote again against ~ny measure which totally abolished church-rates wihu mDinom provision for maintainina the edifice.
It was not entirely a question as between Churchmen and Dissenters. Many sound Churchmen were opposed to the continuance of the present systom, and wouid do almost anything to got the question fially settled. In almost all the great towns of the kin dom church-rates no longer existed i but great injury woad be done to local districts if no provision were made for maintaining the fabric of the church. He thought a fund might be provided for tho maintenanco of the fabric, leavingthoee who frequented the institutions of the church to provide for the comfort and convenience of. the congregation. (Hear.) After stating his objections to the admissioni of the Jews to a seat in Parliamont,. the noble viscount, who from the clamour that prevailed was frequently insudible beyond the reporters' bOx, concluded by expressng his sense of the great honour vhich he hoped the electots would confer upon him by placing him at the head of the poll on Mlonday. (Cheers and disapprobation.)
MUr. HuRssy then came forward, and was more favourably received and more quiqtly lis*ed to than either of ths other condidates. He said he had attended seven pubec meetings, at vhich- he had explained his seatiments, and whether they heard him or not upon the present occasion he' should alIways feel gratefol that they had listened to him so patiently at the district
meetings. He would first-say how it happened that he i s'od there. He should not-hav ooome forward, except to aerve the Liberal interest in the county. (Hear, hear.) He felt that-he was hardlj experienced enough to take so vest *6'responsibilityinpon him as that .of representing the larg
and influental courity of Mlddlesex, but after Mr. Osborne

Parliasnm t ptpsred to sulPrt Lora Palmerston (Ci %fs) Ble felt that- the great question for the decisiorn *f the new Parliament would be whether the country wdr! have Lord Talmersin's Government or Lord Derby's (cbeer:J'whether they woulr: have the friends of reform or not. He, td ofi tword to sa$ Against his noble opponent (Viecount Chelsesy, All he knew of hiit was good, and allthat he could say against himi was thit $9 wvs not a Liberal, He thought that the country were deeply indebted to Lord PFlmerston for his mauly and spirted coneiuct iu putting an end to the war with Russia. IE that noble lord mad not come forward to take the "bull by the h6rmis" where should we bo now? He was a friend to peace, progres, *and economy-to peace, but not peace at any price; progress, but not rash interference, which would soon be re lued
and economy, but not niggardliness. LCheers) He loved the Church of England; but his being a member of that cburch would not prevent his working with those who differed from. him on religious subjects. (Cheers.) The time had now come when different religioDs sects ought to sink their religions differences, and combine for the moral rel* ous, and social reformation of the countrv. (Cheers.
Wit regard to church rates, he thought that those who did not use the edifices of the church, ought not to be called upon compulsorily to contrieute towards their maintenance. (Cheers.) At the same time he thought the ecclesiastical fabrics ought to be kept up. Perhaps it might be found that the system could be put upon * voluntary footing, but if not, ratber than the present system should continue, he would vote for tho total abolition of church-rates. (L/Ud cheers.) He would never vote to destroy the integrity of the Sabbath. Sunday was the poor man's day. As a mrat busily engaged during the vreek he enjoyed the benefit of that day of rest, and he wished every one else to enjoy it too. (Cheers.) The subject of education must employ a large share of tho attention of the House of Commons. He obelieved that a system of education based upon the Bible would be the only effectual system in this country. It would be impossible to found the education of the country upon the compulsory system, and if the State took it altogether in hand there would he the danger of checking the voluntary system which had been such a blessing to the country. IHe did not wish to conceal his views with regard to the Jews. He saw no reason why gentlemen of the Hebrew persuasion should not take their Eeats in the Senate louse, ince theypaidtaxesand ought to be represented. But ho objected to letting them in by a side wind, and by tampering with the oath of abjuration. Ho would vote for the abolition of the oath of abjuration, but he vrould not support a motion for tampering with the words 'on tbe true faith of a Christian." With regard to the franchise, he thought the time had arrived when the ve-elth and increasing intelligence of the country would justify Parliament in enlarging the number of those who enjoyed the elective franchise. He should be willinF to begin with the counties and to support 3Mr. Locke King's measures. (Cheers.) He should, it elected, give his best attention to the state of the finances. They would proba'ly sU agree that they paid too many taxes (a laugh), and it would consequently be the duty of their representatives to look naovlyt-theeconomicaladministration of thefinances. He had never had the honour of a seat in Parliament, but he had had a business and commercial education, and onehe thought which pecularly fitted him for takingpart in the politics of this great nation. If they did him the honour of electing him, he should be prepared to give his time, and aU the energy he possessed, m promoting the local and general iterests of his constituency. He entered into this contest from no sense of self-aggrandizement. He had been called in an election squib "the small beer of Bricklane." (A laugh.) But he would teU them that the small beer would be too strong for the Tories. (Laughter.) It would get into their heads and overcome them, for he and his noble friend (Lord R. Grosvenor) intended to oppsea "I stout" resistance to that party. (Continued laugrhter.) There was one other subject to which hs wished to allude. lle felt strongly the evils of the present electoral system. That bribery, corruption, and intimidation wore carried on to a great extent there could be no doubt. He wished that some efficient and well-devised scheme could be adopted for correcting this eviL At present the question was too often ask-ed before a farmer signed a lease, " How do you vote?' A system of intimidation was injurious to the political education of the country, because a muan who knew he must vote at the dictation of others felt no interest in the politics of his country. (Hoar, hear.) He should hke to see some well-devised scheme by which bribery and intimidation could be put a stop to. so that every man could vote as he wished without fear of the consequences. If such a scheme could be hit upon he vwould vote for it; if not, he would vote for the ballot as the only means of giving freedom to the voter. (Cheers and hisses.) He would endeavour, if he were returned. to work with his noble friend, as his political master, and to do his best to serve his country and raise his fellow-creatures of every condition. Mr. Hanbury concluded by heartily thanking the electors for the courtesy with which they had listened to him, and retired amid great cheering.
Mr. Alderman ROSE wisbed to explain that his name had been placed upon the committee of Lord R. Grosvenor and Mr. anbuxy unknown to him and by mistake. He believed, however, that no man was more anxious for the welfare of the working classes than Lord R. Grosvenor.
A cry was raised for "Baron Rothschild," and the Baron presented himself to the meeting in obedience to the call.
Mr. ANDEIRTON, who appeared to be labouring under some excitement, came to the front of the hustinga, and addressing himself to the assemblage exclaimed " Gentlemen, don t dlow any person to speak."
It was understood that the friends of Lord Chelsea objected to any addresses being made to the electors before the show of hands. Some delay and altercation took p Ia
upon the hestingR, the friends of the Liberal candidates maintainis3, that any electors had a right to speak, and the friends of Loid Chelssea asserting tbat the meeting was assembled for a specific object, and that no one had a right to address the electors unless he had a candidate to propo or some question to ask of the candidates. The Sheriffs ap. peared desirous to hold the balance equally, and offered, as Alderman Rose had been heard on one side, to permit a few remarks to be made by some friend of Lord Chelsea on the other. As, however, the offer was declined, and Mr. Alderman Wire had taken off his hat and was about to address the crowd in the interest of Lord R. Grosvenor and Mr. Hanbury, it was necessary to come to some decision and to act upon it. Mr. Sheriff Mechi therefore, with great firmness, but with the most courteous manner, came to the front of the hustings and interposed betweed Mr. Alderman Wire and the meeting. The Alderman insisted upon his right, and with some warmth of manner tried to press forward, in spite of the Sheriff's extended right arm and deprecatory gestures. In this semi-friendly but not too seemly contest the worthy Sheriff hadthe advantage, for, beingof portlypersonal presence and wearing his Sheriff's robe, he was enabled to hide from the view of the meeting the figuro of the Ailderman, who is of somewhat diminutive stature. The dispate caused great uproar and confusion among tho crowd. The Sheriff in vain endeavoured to make himself heard and to explain the grounds of his interference. Failing to gain a hearing
MEr. Sheriff Mxoerr, addressing himself to the reporters, and stil restraining Mr. Alderman Wire with his stalwart arm, said,-I hive asked the authorities whether any elector has a rialht to address the meeting before I call for a show of handis. Some say it is a right, and others that it ia not. I have consulted al tha highest authorities. and I have wished to hear one on each side. Bnt the other side will not address the electors, and therefore I cannot permit it to by done by Alderman Wire, I shall therefore take the show of hands first.
Alderman WiRE.-I protest. I have a right to be heard.
The SErxmriFr then proceeded to call for a show of hands. For Lord E. Grosvenor about half the hands of the meeting were held up. For Lord Chelsea nearly the same number. For Mr. Hanbury nearly every hand seemed to be lifted up, and his undoubted majority elicited loud cheers from his friends.
Mr, Sheriff MsEcsr.-I declare the show of hands to be in favour of Lord R, Grosvenor and Mr. Hanbury. (Great cheering.)
A pollwas demanded for Viscount Chelsea.
Baron Ro=rsciin, having been again called for, addressed the meeting amid a noisy demonstration of mingled cheering and disapprobation. He said that after so many speeches it wa.s not his intention to take up much of their time. (Confusion.) No doubt some of the persons in the crowd who interrupted him had no votes, and he wished to recommend to them two men who would give them a vote. Would Lord Chelsea do that for the friends who had been shouting for him ? (Hlear, hear.) There were three candidates before them. Two were for reform, cheap bread, free trade, anA for improvement in the institutions of the country. But the other, a friend of his, was an old-fashioned gentleman, who wished to keep things as they w^or 100 years ago. (A laugh.) Who, then, were their best friends ? Would they vote for progress, for reform, anid for changes adapted to the times, or for the man who wanted to keep matters as they had always been? He advised them not to beve that a Liboral-Conservative could be really a liberaL He assured them that he would not. A man
must sit on one side or the other of the House of Commons, and upon one side sat those who opposed every reform and improvement; and, upon the other, those who supported reform and improvement. There was another question upon which he trusted they would not allow themselves to be misled. Don't lot them believe that all the men who called themselves Palmerstonians were Liberals. (Cheers.) He believed that every gentleman wished to maintain the honour of the British nlag; but let them return men who came forward in a straightforward way and sid " We are Liberals." He had looked through the votes and attendanco of Lord R. Grosvenor, and he believed that there was no better man in the House of Commons, or one more honest, or more conscientious than his Lordship. (Cheers.) He might have erred once or twice, but the electors ought not to forget that in 98 timeg out of 1OD he had been right. (Hear, hear.) He lhad attended faithfully to their interests, and he trusted that they would not listen to a noble viscount who appeared 'before them as the rejected of another place. (Cheers and hisses.) Let them poll carly on Monday morning ana use their utmost infuene top lace two LiborAl candidateiat the head of the polL. (Great cheerin.)
Lord R. Gnosvxxomr thanked his supporters for the show of hands in his favour, good-humouredly remarking that some of them were quite ele", while others apetd as if they had not seen soap for a long tiie' (Laughter. He propoaed a vote of thanks for the Sheriffs, and felt 'ound to say that hehad neverseen two gentlemen more thoroughly impartial than thepresent Sheriffs of London and lMiddleserThe least they could do was to ass a voteof thanks to Sheriffs Mechi and Ke"a.

Sir J. TROLLOPH then addressed the electors. He belie.e.
that although three candidates had been proposed, they, would not find any material difference betw*en'any of them. He never would, and he hoped that his hon. friend Mr. Willson never would, pledge himself to follow any particular course, but would act an independent part, and do the best he could for those whose interests and opinions he was sent lo represent. (Hear, hear.) Great credit had been taken to Lord Palmnerston for the very able manner in which he had conecluded the war with 1.uessi, and ho was willing to give that Minister all the credit that ho Was justly entitled to; but he could not forget that Lord Palmerst6n was one of the Ministers of that Cabinet which brought about the -misfortane in the frat instance. (Cheers and interruption.) Aid howw as it that the people of England were not satisfied with the peace? It was because they commenced war when they were not preparEd for it, and left off 'when they were just in a right position to ooinmence. With regard to the income-tax, itwas not the Government that took off the tax, but the people of England. (Cheers, and "No, no ") They mnight expect that the Government would tax them well, for they ha brought in aPoliceBill, nd there were, be saw, already in Sleaford two or three polioemen, who would have to be paid by them. They did not reqme any additional policemen about them, when they had so little crime, and he did not think the electors would blame him for voting againstthat measure. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the linmediate cause of the dissolution of Parliament, he wvould say that Sir John Bowring had no right to take upon himself the bombardment of Canton without having received instructions from the Government to do so. The Govem. ment official first boinbarded the town, and then sent home for the sanction of the Government. The_ had now sent out 3,000 men, and had alredy taken 3,COO,0C00. of money to.ardstheexpenses of carrying on the war. He gave the vote on tho Chinese question from his conscience, ana he would, were the thing to do over again, give his vote in the same way. He was in favour of national education, conducted upon a religions basis, and he had voted for the due observance of the Sabbath.- Ile would support any measrevhich be thought would set the church-rate question at rest. He was against the Bill which had been introdueed by the Government for the collection of agricultural statistics. (Cheers.) He thought that a Bill which comnellea them to give an account of all the stock they possessed amid the corn they might have, with a penalty if they did not make a correct return, and imprionment if they did not pay the fine, was aBill of.painsandpenalties, He.then. edthen for the kind reception he had met with.
Mr. A. WrLuSO2 addressed theelectors; He was a member of the Church of England,' and as such should oppote any extreme opinions, whether Tractarian, as leading to Popery, or any other opinions which might tend to produce discord in a church which should be the church of peace and unity. Ho was of opinion that Mr. Locke Kinagg motion would not have given the extension of the franchise which was desired, for the towns that were not large enough to be enfranchised would have swamped the agricaltrial votars. He was in favour of a national system of education basec Tipon religious principles, and he was also in favour of a measre that would set at rest the vexed question of church-rates. Ho was an advocate of rigid' economy in the publio expenditure, and thought that in good faith the mcome-tax ought to be abolished in 1S60. He was decidedlioppostd to the Agricultural Statistics Bil, which coald be of no benefit to tho agriculturists. (Cheers. )
Mr. GEoZGE Hussny PAcKCE came forward as au independent candidate, ready to give his support to Lord Palmerston so long as that noble lord introduced measures condacive to the benefit of the people. On the Chinese question hewas decidedly of opinionthat SirJohn Bowringhadactedin the right way in what he had done. ("No, no.!" and cheers.) He was of the same opinion as the gentlemen who had spoken before him upon the question of church-rates, and he was in favour of a national system' of education based upon religious principles. He was in favour of progressive measures of reform. (Hear.)
A show of hands was taken, and it -was decided to ba in favour of Mr. Willson and Mr. Packe. A poll, which was fixed for Saturday, was demanded on behalf of Sir John Trollope.
YORKSIIPIE (EA.ST RID7NG).
The nomination of two. members for this Siding took place yesterday at the Courthouse, Beverley.
Sir TATTONV SYxscs proposed aud Mr. R. Dmiisoxr, of Waplington. seconded, Lord Hotham.
Mr. J. R. Pm.sE proposed, and Sir H. BnToyToxr seconded, the Hon. Admiral Arthur Duncomrbe.
There was no opposition, and -the HiGnH SwEsFr (Sir S. Radcliffe) having' declared Lord Hotham and Admiral Duncombe duly elected,.
Lord HOTHAss roze amidst loud cheers.' He said,The late Parliament. had been dissolved under circwnu stances of peculiar excitement, but, nevertheless, he had presented himself in all directions before large bodies of his constituents, and had bad the gratification. of beinR everywhere received in the kindest snd most cordial manner. For all this he could not sufficiently express his thanks. Of course they would expect from him some notice of events which had happened or which were likely to happen in Parliament. As to what was to come he could not say, for, as they would all be aware the first session of a new Parliament was never very fruitful in lrge measures. Members were inexperienced, and it took them some time to get into the ways of the House. But with respect to what was past there was much to talk about. He did not know whether the dissolution of Parliament had taken many of them.by surprise, but he confessed it had not surprised him much; for if there was a disadvantage in a Parn'ament being too young, there was also a great disadvantage and considerable embariment to a Government in a Parliament begining to Bet to old. (Laughter.)
embers, when a Parliament had livedmore than its aver
time, began to look mo~re out of the House than m the House; they began to look forward htothe elections and the prospect of meeting their constituents. N'ow, at the commencement of the last session be saw;wPn of this sort of thing, and at onoe he felt that a speedy dissolution was inevitable. The agitation' in the country as to the income-tax, and other matters wFhich' compelled thet attention of Governmnent, showed him as clear as the suna t noonday that it was en absolute necessity wtith Government to avail themselves of the first opportunity for calling together a new Parliament. nt was in their interest to do so, aDd, if he wrere to speak in a part sen9e, those who gave them the opportunity vwere grossly unwise. Mid thin brought him to the cause of the dissolution-the Chinese que.tion. Without going into great detail, he wrould state that, in his opinion, the prooceedings in China wrere not taken upon fair and honest grounds (cheers); for, wfhatever was the cause of offenec-and he wfas not going to discuss that now-the punishment wsafartoo great. (Cheers.) A. very great deal had beenrsaid about the barbarity of the Chinese, but he did not think it any argument that, because a civilized natiOn wvas at wrar with a barbarous one, that therefore it should retaliate with barbarity. (EIear.) Now, he bad said that he did not think the proceedinsa were' taken against China in a fair-dealing w,ay. Einghshmen loved fair play, and if they found a man one day saying one thi ng, and another the next, they would not. be disposed to place much reliance on him. (Hfear.) Therefore, wfhen hep saw that, in -October, HIer Majestys Plenipotentiary declared to the. Consul that the Arrow, clearly had no right to hoist the British flag, and a month afterw.ards declared to the Chinese Commtissioner that she had a right to hoist it, he could not place much reliance on him. Lord Hotham then went on at great length to prove, by the' examlple of' the proceedings a2ainst the Chinese in 1S47, that the present reprisals were much too severe. Seeing this was 'the case he could not vote with Governmen'; but he wished it to he understood that, while he voted against the Government, hedid not do seas avote of CenSUre nDOn them, but upon the improper proceedings of Sir Jonhn bowring.

DiUMMPMESSH=E.
The nomination took plawe on Wednesday.
Mr. CABRRUTHFRS, of Dormont, proposed Mr. J.3. Hope Johnstone, of Annandale; and Mr. Wnae, Tinwald. downs, seconded the nomination.
Mr. JoaNsroXF addressed the electors. He referred to hs vote on the China question, which he defended at some lenglh. He then enforced the necessity of economy in both the military and naval expenditure; the Govern. maent required to be backed by the House of Commons in resisting the demand for money made by ardent and right. thining men for laudable objects. It was evident that the discussions on education wrer preparing men to modify their opinions and meet on neutral round, so as to be able to carry out a national system. Much good, meanwhile, was beng effected by industrialnad reformatory schools, and there was a decided tendency towards social reform. With regard to a change in the electoral sytem, he thought nothing would have beea done by the late Parlament; but now it was evident that the subject must be grappled v'ith. The Government Was one holding Liberal opinions, rnd would evidently obtain a large majority of membersholding similar opinions. Be knew not wht were the intentions of the Prime Minister; he had hitherto wrapped them up in vague obh scurity. Ele did not blame him for not speaking out, but in the newv Parliament Lord Palmerston would bave to Bay plainly whether or not he would bring in a Bill to Chane the condition of the representatioa. If the Premier should answer in the affirmative, but say that social subjects were more pressing, and that he would not promise to undertake such a measure in the present or next session, but 'within 18 months, be thought forbewance ought to be shown the Minister. and that he should be allowed to take his own time. Sbould Lord Palmerston reply in the negative, wbich be (Mr. Jobn8tone) dido anticipate, either sulch measures would be brought in by private members, or a motion be made that in the opinion of the House the electoral system ought to be delt 'with. If the Premier were placed in a minority on such a motion he would require to abandon the reins of power- if in a msJority, he -would only gain this by the support of his opponents, and be placed In a position worse than useless, which no high. spirited man would consent to occupy. There 'were a number of small boroughs in England returning two members of no note save for that fact, and he was pro. pcaed to take from them at least one member, and give the riht of representation to communities rising in importance.
e 'was also prepared to support a measure leading to a con. siderable extension of the franchise in towns. He would not pledge himself to the point, but he thought the present qualification might be safely lowered. In the counties tie occupation qualification might also be safely reduced, so as to include retired officers and tradesmen, and trades. men in business occupying premiser which were not their own. (Cheers.)
A show of hands having been called for, Sheriff Trotter declared ltr. Johnstone duly elected, and the proceedings terminated by a vote of thanks to the presiding offlcial.

The canvass in this county has been carried on with great energy. On Wednesday Mr. Bouverie and Mr. Vansittart made a personal canvass of Maidenhead and its environs, 'wtb, we understand, but moderate success; and yesterday Mr. Vansittart was also similarly engaged at Newbury. Neither has Captain Vernon been idle, having yesterday addressed no less than three publio meetings; one at Newbury, another at Reading, and the third at Woklngham 3From what we have been able to gather, the feelging the Wokingham district is against Mr. Vansittart, and the same is the case at Wantage. As we stated yesterday, all conjecture as to the result of the contest must be very doubtfuL but the general opinion appears to be that Mr. Palmer and Captain Vernon are sure to be returned, and that the struggle for the third seat lies betweenx Mr. Bouverie and Mr. Vansittart.

long-tried LAberaJ, Sir Denham Norreys. Mr. John Alexasder, the Derbyite, has this timae won the borough of Carlow by a large majority over the Hon. CaptainPonsouby. in the memorable contest between Mr. Alexander and the the then Lord of the Treasury, John Sadleir, the struggle was aliost neck and neck, the latter losing by some half dozen votes. But thearch swindler was no less an adapt in the art of eleotioneering than in the cooking of the balancesheet of his own bank. In Athlone borough the Hon. Captain Handcock (Derbylte) has been signally de. feated by Mr. John Ennia, Governor of the Bank of Ireland, and a Liberal, and who, after sundry unsuccessful attempts to attai4 to the rank of legislator, has at last had his perse. verance rewarded. Lord Downshire's family borough of Carrickfergus, which was represented in the old Parliament by the Hon. Major Cotton-if anyone recollects the gallant gentleman as an Irish member,-has returned a member of kindred politics in the person of Mr. C. Dobbs, the son of a resident gentleman, however, who has beaten out of the field Mr. Francis M'Donogh, the eminent Queen's counsel
and a very advanced Liberal-Conservative or Peelte. In. dependent opposition has been radely repulsed in an attempt to storm the borough of Dundalk, under the leadersbip of MIr. Cantwell, who having polled 40 votes at 1 o'clock gracefully yielded the ostof honour to the tltramontane Mr. George Bowyer. ln the archepiscopal city of Armagh, Mr.Bond, areasonablymoderateTory,and aided, itisbelleved, by the influence of the Lord Primate, has been beaten by Mr. Mlijer, a barrster, whose political principlea are said to be a little more tinged with the Orange hue than those of Mr. Bond are supposed to be. In NFew Ross, the hybrid. Liberal, Mr. Tottenham, is again the sitting member for his own borough, and Mr. Graves, notwithstanding his high postion in the mercantile world and his deserved popularity in the town, made but an indifferent figure in the contest. Waterford city has elected two untried men, Mr. Blake, the .nayor, a LAberal, and Mr. Hssard, a mitigated Derbyite, the defeated candidates being Sir Henry Barron and Mr. C. O'Dwyer, ex-filazer of the Court of Exchequer, who, though the direct nominee of the Roman Catholic bishop and the clergy, had the honour of being at the foot of the poll tby a ;very respectable minority. Neither of the late merdbers presented himself for re-election. Mx. Meagher retired from the pressure of advanced years, and Mr. M!. Keatinge's unfortunate connexion with the Tipperary Bank defeated, of course, any claims he might have had for a renewal of his Parliamentary lease. Galway borough has been won by Lord Dunkellin and Mr. A. O'Elaherty, the latter being rather sorely pressed by the aged Colonel French, an ardent Young Irelander, and a stickler for the independent opposition sham. Mr. Kirk, the Presbyterian Liberal, had a severe struggle for the possession of the borough of Newry, the ultra- ory, Major Waring, losing by 15 votes only. Kilkenny city closes the list of Wednesdey'
returns in the re-lection of Mr. AL Sullivan, its last Iiberal representative. The contest for the University might be put down as decided, there not being the most remote prospect of displacing either of the late members. The Provost and the Lord Chancellor plumped on Wednesday for Mr. Lawson, the Liberal candidate. Of the old Dublin Tory brigade of six, five it may be said are safe for Lord Derby, and the chances of the defeat of the sixth have been con. siderably lessered within the last few days by a most injudicious attempt on the part of the popular candidate, Sir Charles Domvile, to coerce his Dublin tenants to record their votes in favour of Mr. John Reynolds, the rejected of the Irish metropolis.

DuxrGAnRvox BoRoUGiL-The Cork Examiner, of Wednesday, says :-" The candidate who lay concealed behind the mask of Lord St.Laurence's name has at last appeared in the person of Sir Nugent Humble, who, without thinking it necessary to pay the constituency the ordinary respect of a formal ddress, haa come forwarcd with the aid of the Duke of Devonshire's support. On Monday, attended by Mr. Currie, he proceeded to canvass the constituency, and first went to the residence of the Very Rev. Dr. Hally, from whom he met a point blank refusal, accompanied with some Strog observations on tlxe piiodtin which he had placed h1= 1ef. The hon. baronetZs appearance as a candidate has excited the greatest surprise, and provoked the strongest comments, from his previous relations to Mr. Maguire and to the constitueccy. He had, in conjunction with the townspeople on a former occasion, given his support to that gentleman, against the influence of the Duke of Devonshire, and he has now had recourse himself to that influence ia order to try and oust his friend, and to get possession of the representation himself. Besides, he concealed all along from Mr. Maguire his intention to become a candidate.

Notwvithstanding this floulrish, it is highly probable that hlr. Maley's ambition has been alreadiy fully satisfied by the publication of a monster address in the Dublin papers, and that the late members will not be afforded an oppcortunity of trying their strength with this unexpected antagzonist.

The Westmoreland Election.
THE WBSTrOBELAND BLECTIOR.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The nomination for the county of Westmoreland took place yesterday at the Shire-hall, Appleby, and the scene was a veIy extraordinary one. To the surprise of Colonel Lowther and the Earl of Bective, and, I may add, of Mr. Luther Watson, the High Sheriff, a third candidate was proposed by Mr. James Atkinson, a yeoman of this county, aud duly seconded by another independent elector. Mr. George Wilkinson. The third candidate proposed was Mr. Thwaites, Chairman of the Board of Works, -who is a Westmorlansd man.
A show of hands was then taken, and declared by the Sheriff, without couLting, or dividing the meeting, to be in favour of the old members.
I may here remark that, as between the Earl of Bective and Mr. Thwaites, the Sheriff's decision was considered very unsatisfactory, oven by some of the Conservatives, and that I myself saw one gentleman, Mr. Wilson, of Dallam-tower, hold up the right and left hand in favour of the Earl of Becotive.
Well, after waiting scarcely a minute, the High Sheriff' though he must have seen that Mr. Atkinson was consultin vith his friends, abruptly declared Colonel Lowther a the Earl of Bective duly elected.
Mr. Atkinson protested against this jockeyship, and demanded a poll for Mr. Thwaites, bat in vain.
The gallant colonel, vhoi a wag in his wVay, coolly told him that he ought to have been sharper. Will some constitutional laweyer inform us whether the gallant colonel was too sharp, or Mr. Atkinson not sharp enough? And so obliga, among many others. your obedient sn-vnt

THE :gbDDL3RlM-S= ELEoTOH RiOTs.--The to of Kidderminster is still in an excited state, and, although a portion of the military brought down on satrday night have returned to their quarters, it is still considered necessary to retain the residue in tho town sorne time longer. Mr. Lowe, we rexret to say is stil sufferin severely from the Injuries *cted uponL ism bythe btmob. The two men apprehended on Monday, and remanded on a chage of rioting after the Riot Act had been read, as already reported in l2sc Time,, wfill be brought up to.day before the Mayor and magietrates at Kidder. rainster, and at the same time it is expected that a number of the ringleaders in the outrage of Satur. day night will be apprehended and brought before the anthonties. The pohee have been actively einployed all the week in inquiries, and have been assisted in their object by a small staff of detectives. The mokt determined efforts wiU be made to sertain who were the originsators of the attack upon Mr. Lowe, and a subwcription to a considerble amount ha been raised for defraying the expenses incident to a pro. seeution of the malefactors. A large reward is also about beig offered for the detection of the most active aailants of Mr. Lowe and his party. The friends and supporters of Mr. Lowe are even now nightly subjected to insults and asnoyances on the part of the weavers, who, notwithstanding 3he presence of th military in the town, do not scrmple, on meeting any gentemen mm ho have distinghed thelmselvUe as supporters of Mfr.

ZOND2OY, FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 1857.
The Indian Mail adds few particulars to the original statements that the Emperor of CHLNA had ordered YE} to establish peace, and had issued an edict to the high officers of the coast provinces tnot to interfere with the quarrel at Canton. &mething, indeed, is said of an Imperial despatch to Comnissioner Yzir, as usual making the Lest of t-e present position, and of the course which the Chinese may have to adopt. The destruction of our property, the abandonment of our positions on the mainland, and the withdrawal oDf our merchants and shipping to Hongkong, not to speak of our inability to follow the war junks up into the creeks, are construed into a defeat only just short of utter extermination. In such a case it is presumed that we should only be too glad to sue for terms. The objects of Chinese vengeance having thus been obtained, and our desire to communicate with their officials being construed into a proof of submission, the Commissioner is charged, according to the terms of the supposed despatch, not to press too hard on the unfortunate and penitent foreigners. He is to meet their con-
essions, not, indeed, half way, but so far as to show that he is not utterly implacable, and that there is mercy as well as vengeance in the Chinese Jbosom. That there should be such a document, nncd that this should be its language, is so exceedingly probable that the very likelihood suggests a suspicion as to the truth of the report. It would only be a mode of telling YEH that ha must make peace with the English as well as he
as the EuruRoR is totally unable to give him any assistance, and declines even to make the attempt in the only possible way, by proclaiming war against us, and creating diversions in favour of YEEI at the four other ports. !'Me value of such a policy is suffliciently understood in an empire suffering under that most painful and exhausting of social disorders, a chronic rebellion. At this moment the EMPERoE is enjoying a slight tempora=y relief at Pekin by the withdrawal of the rebel forces to Nankin. If, then, the EMPEROR had the least hope of bringing the English to submission or avertIng a repetition of the pains and penalties Buffered in 1842, he would at once give such orders as wouild oblige us to divide our armament and stand for the pretent on the defensive. He does not venture on this course. He carefully insulates Canton, and treats Ysn as a troublesome and eccentric tributory. He is evidently anxious lest the quarrel viith the foreigner should spread as wide as the rebellion; aud, as the one can no longer be localized, he will spare no pains to confine the other to its source. Such being evidently and undoubtedly his desire, -the document which report speaks of is a matter 4of course; nor can we doubt as to the terms which Chinese vanity would dictate. Whether there be such a document, however, or whether the express terms have reached Hongkong, is a matter of very nmaR importance.
Nothing whatever that the Emperor of CHIA Is done; or is likely to do, in his, most politic or most penitent Inqod, cNn 'affect our operations.
t is gquib cestai ihst b is tot at pr&et Prod
Fared to compel YEu and the Cantonese to give us and all the f6reigners ample compensation for all losses, reparation for all indignities, and cobipliance with such other terms as we may now think it necessary to impose. Nothing that has happened so far is likely to have had such an effect on the Chinese mind as to induce submission. Even were theENTpnaon to insist on it, he would find the Cantonese still refractory. So, wenever for an instant imagined that the affair couald be settled without operations, or, at all events, demonstrations of a strong and formidable character. There is a certain process which we shall have to go through. We shall have to present ourselves with an adequate force in sufficient proximity to the Celestial Court, or whatever other point may be thought the moat propitious for the object, and, after a proper amount of blows, or words, or both, we shall most probably obtain terms that would now be utterly impossible. We shall have to do all this work. There is no such great hurry about it. Trade is not interrupted at the other ports. Both sides, then, feel it their interest to abstain from the quarrel, and positive efforts are made, with success, to allay any temporary excitement or alarm. There is, then, nothing to prevent our taking our ow-n time ab6ut the measures best calculated to repair and improve our position -with the Chinese. For this a large armament is required, and it will be twice as large, so Lord PAL3IniSTON informs us, as that employed on the former occasion.
It appears to be thought a matter of indifference whether we retain our position at Canton, which is very far removed from the producing districts, and has only become by the merest accident the chief point of trade. Accordingly, what the merchants desire is to obtain pecuniary compensation for their losses, and transfer their establishments to Shanghai or the other free ports. But, 'whether we maintain our position at Canton or give it up, that is the place where the example must be made, and we trust that the expedition now preparing will have orders to that effect. The city is, in fact, in the hands of a species of Przetorian Guard, called the " Braves," whose claim to that honourable title consists in the practice of brutal murder and treacherous assassination. They are said to be 6,000 or 7,000 strong, and to be extremely elated by their recent successes, in which they claim to have achieved a great slaughter of the foreigners. Nothing whatever can be done at Canton; the populace will never be civil, and the lives of the British residents never be safe, till these invincible "B Braves" have been made to respect us, and this is a lesson which can only be impressed by the severest measures. The more thoroughly the work is done the better, not only for ourselves and other foreigners, but for the Chinese themselves, who are, in fact, kept in a state of misery and degradation by corrupt officials and a brutal soldiery. We shall emancipate them while we redress ourselves.
The official despatches of Sir JAMES OUTRAM to
The official despatches of Sir JAMES OUTRAM to the Bombay Government, the information published in the Indian journals, -and our own correspondence from the East enable us now to give a comnplete and authentic description of that weel's campaign in Persia which included the brilliant victory of Xhooshab, and it is not too much to say that in some particulars this achievement will be found even more remarkable than it was presumed to be on the receipt of the telegraphic reports announcing thefacts. The reinforcementsdespatched from India to augment the small army which had captured and occupied Bushire were preceded by General OuTvs xiia person,who arrived at Bushire on the 27th of January, and was immediately informed that a considerable Persian force lay intrenched at Burazjoon, about 46 miles distant, with the design of recovering the towvn from our hands as soon as sufficient strength could be collected for such an enterprise. A day or two later the First Brigade of the Second, or reinforcing Division, composed of the 78th Highlanders and the 26th Native Infantry, arrived from Bombay, and as soon as they were disembarked Sir JAMES lost not another moment in forming and conducting an expedition into the interior in quest of the Persian army. The force mustered for this purpose comprised 243 troopers of the 3d Native Cavalry (Regulars), and 176 of the Poonah Horse (Irregulars), making 419 sabres in the whole. The infantry assembled in greater strength, including, besides the two battalions just arrived, the 64th Foot, the 2d Bombay Europeans, the 4th and 20th Native Infantry (the former being a Rifle corps), and a regiment of Beloochees; giving a total force of 4,234, of whom rather more than half, or 2,212, were Europeans. The artillery attached to the expedition consisted of two field batteries, of 6 guns each, and a troop of Horse Artillery, altogether 18 pieces.
WVith this force, which left only some 1,800 troops, witlh a serviceable contribation of seamen and marines, for the protection of the camp, Sir JAmES marched straight for Burazjoon, but the enemy, as already related, evacuated the position at the first intelligence of our approach, and left their stores and ammunition to the victors. From this point, however, the operations assume a complexion differing in some degree from that given in the summary communication of the telegraph, and present features of great interest and curiosity. Although the Persians were so dismayed at our advance as to abandon without a blow their own fortified position, they had no sooner done so than they projected an attack upon us while occupying these very same defences, and they did really assail us on the instant of our quitting them, and continued to act on the offensive with great audacity and vigour until they were absolutely routed in the battle which ensued. 'Whether they found our force smaller than they anticipated, whether they took courage on our declining to follow them into the hills, or whethar they were inspired by some motive unknown, it is impossible to say, but General OUTAAm himself informs us that he and his troops were to have been attacked in the Burazjoon camp on the very night they left it, and that the intended operation was changed into a piursuit when the explosions occasioned by the destruction of the enemy's magazines communicated the intelligence of ouLr departure.
The whole affair now became one continuous engagement, carried on by abrupt attacks through the darkness of the night, and culminating in a pitched battle and decisive victory as soon as the break of day brought an opportunity of action, Sir JAMiES, after remaining two days in the Persian position, and completing the demolition of their stores, wisely abstained from following the retiring enemy into the mountains, and gave orders, on the night of the 7th, for the return march to Bushire. The Persians instantly commenced the work of pursuit and attack bysurrounding our rear guard with their cavalry and threatening on aU sides our line of march. To repel these assaults the troops were formed into a large oblong square, -with the baggage of the army in the centre, an attitude which proved quite effective in averting any mischief, though the enemy maintained an incessant discharge of musketry, and even brought up, towards the moming, three or four heavy gun, which opened upon our column like the Sikh cananor in the night after Ferozeshuhur, but which &ild niot, owing to the darknexA, be sileice in a, simi1i waannet. At. le3gth1 as-the mo'niiigoding tn e Persian force ~ene yiilo on X left .otl
Britisb, and was found to be drawn up in battle array in the vicinity of Khooshab.
Although General OuTniAes depat.ch contains a detailed enumeration of the troops composing the S s'S army, it is difficult to discriminate the several corps under their Oriental designations, but we can ascertain that they were 6,900 strong, with about 1,000 cavalry. On other points some remarkable corrections require to be made in the accounts previously received. The Persians, instead of being weak in artillery, are supposed to have had as many gans as ourselves, though it is not quite clear that they were aU in the field, and they worked them, according to the reports before us, with extraordinary energy. It is stiU more surprising, however, to find that the brunt of the battle was borne, not by their cavalry, as originally reported, but by their regular infantry, drawn up in squares, according to the tactics of modern warfare ; indeed, after the night attack little mention of the Persian horse appears in the despatches. As soon as it was light, and the position of the Persians was ascertained, our force was at once formed for the attack, the cavalry and artillery in front, and the infantry. in two lines in support. After a vigorous cannonade, our two cavalry regiments -one, be it remembered, of less than 250, and the other of less than 200 sabres, charged right at the enermy's squares, and with the resuts before announced. The Regulars charged a battalion of Persian Guards 900 strong, and piercedthe square like a shot-killing, as we learn from Sir JArns himself, " nearly the whole reginent ' the Irregulars bore down upon the Kashikai Regigiment, broke it, and took its colours. It was not, however, upon the instant that the Persians took to flight; on the contrary, we read in one of the Indian accounts of the engagement that they twice recaptured their guns, which had fallen to our cavalry in their onset, aud General OuR.& only fixes 10 o'clock as the termination of the battle, wbich had commenced at daybreak. But it remains clear that the cavalry and the artillery between them-400 horsemen with 18 guns-achieved the rout of the Sa's army, nor could the infantry over come up with the enemy in the rapidity of their flight.
Our intelligence informs us that after the return of the troops to Bushire it>was in contemplation to undertake a second expedition againBt Mohammereh -a town opposite Busaorah, onthe river Euphrates, where the Persiann were muastering in considerable force; and we learn, indeed, that the remainder of the Second Division, part of which had already, on the 13th of February, arrived at Bushire, would not be disembarked, but would proceed straight to the new scene of action. It must be a matter of earnest hope that the news of the pacification may arrive in time to prevent any further effusion of blood in a quarrel already settled, but the credit acquired by our troops and their commander would be sufficient to remove allapprehensions about carnpaigning in Persia. Some readers, we have no doubt, will be well pleased to find that the Regular Cavalry of India can fully compete in efficiency with those Irregular comrades of whose aptitudeg for service so much was justly predicted, but all must concur in admiration of soldiers who, Europeans as well as Indians, have so gallantly discharged their duty. The brilLiancy of a victory naturaly concentrates attention upon itself, but it deserves to be recollected that the troops not only fought and won at Khooshab, but after marching, without tents or extrr. clothing, 46 miles in 41 hours over the worst possible roads and in the worst possible weather to lura2joon, again, after an interval of two days only, performed the return march in 50 hours more, besides gaining a decisive battle on the way. On such soldiers we may rely with perfect confidence, but we sincerely trust that their prowess may not again be tested in a campaign which peace has -happily terminated.
Everything connected with the hustings is
Everything connected with the hustings is regulated by a kind of tradition in this country. The speeches must be hudings' speeches, scintillating with an appropriate jocularity. The electors, or the crowd that votes itself the constituency on that oecasion, expect it. Argument is not wanted. If it is attempted it must be made as short as possible, and even what there is must be in the form of some very, we will not say coarse, but strong ilustration, which brings the whole to a head instantaneously with a loud report like that of a pistol. The Puritan colonists of two centuries ago carried a different model over with them to America, and accordingly the United States hustings foUow a different tradition, and mnob oratory is there serious and argumentative. Bat with us "Merry England"-" La Joyeuse Angle" te-rre," as M. DuM As calls it-still survives in the ceremonials of the hustings, which affect the light, goodhumoured, standard. The candidate is expected to exchange jokes and repartees with his constituency-that is to say, if he can, for success here is more difficult than persons would be apt to suppose, and we would not advise any one to try who did not feel some vocation and natural aptitude. 3Mr. DIsnAxm went to Aylesbury on Tuesday utrimjue aVaratus, armed with a serious speech on one side, and with plenty of light material on the other, according as the latter might be wanted. He began with the sernous matter, and " tried it on," as the expression is :-" I wil not take refuge in claptraps, as the "candidates in old days have generally done, but "I will address you with the same seriousness as
if I were addressing the House of Commons." And certainly the experiment succeeded bett3r than could have been expected. Any one who will take up the report will see that the mob actually heard out four columns-four columns of grave Hlouse of Commons' speaking, with hardly an interruption, and behaving almost as well as if each had been a Speaker. Their patience then broke down, and a brisk fire commenced be. tween the orator and various gentlemen in the crowd. But it is worth noticing the success of this, almost the first regular attempt to introduce House of Commons' spealing from the hustings, because, as evelybody knows, there is nothing more difficult to interfere with than traditions. School traditions, University traditions, Army and Navy traditions are very unmanageable things for Reformers; and hustings' traditions are much the same in obstinacy. A St. Bartholomew Fair, a Smithfield-market, an Oxford Commemorationtry to alter their traditions, and you will find a wonderful passive resistance. It is the same with an English election.
Mr. SIDNEY HEPP.EIT had not apparently the courage to try Mr. Disr1snAe's experiment upon the electors of South Wiltshire, but yielded genially and without a struggle to the traditions of the English hustings. As he would not, however, probably thank us much for desenbing the suecess with which he met the suggestion, 4" Send him to "Roosia," and the question, "Who sent out " green cofFee ?" from the body of the hall, we will let those little elegancies pass. Mfr. SIDhNY HmwEpYs remarks on Parliamentary Reform-that it should be a general measure and not a partial one, and upon Mr. LocBE Kixq's Bill in particulAr-are sensible; but we will notice especiaUy one thing r. Ssnmzy HarBEnr says, because it shows that even a M hustngs' Ipe&li can Iave its iimSiohti -xptem 6 -ery plain trut i-" We has- a
to , Kf. , . rj if . . 4 , o
avow that he pays some respect to public opinion. Now, is this cowardly or is it manly ? We know it is alniost a first truth with some people that the opinion of the world at large must be wrong, and it is thought a proper act of courage to resist it. And far be it from us to say that public opinion is always right, or to deny that there are occasions on which it is au act of proper moral courage to oppose it. But, when people talk of moral courage, they ought at the same time to remember that a man may show moral courage by opposing the current opinion of his own set or clique just as much as by opposing the opinion of the whole world. As an exhibition of moral courage, it will often practicallybe much more difficult andrequire more effort and strength of mind for a mau to dare to differ even on the smallest point from his Own particular set than to defy the whole earth. There is nothing so enslaving as the dictation of your own coterie. It is a burden on many and many a man's back, which he bears through life only because he cannot summon the moral courage to shake it off. A man sticks himself with his backto the wall, and defies public opinion, and he thinks himself a hero for it; but let him try to tell four or five men who have been accustomed to exert an influence over him that he thinks them wrong, and he will find the difference 'between defying that abstraction called " the "w world " and confronting actual individual men. Mr. SxDNEY HmmEzBT, then, has had the courage to prefer public opinion to the opinion of his own political clique. Mr. GrT.&osrown, on the other hand, is, we believe, still with his back to the wall defying the public-at least, he was only a day or two ago ringing the changes upon the old Chinese question, and hammering the " true view" into the electors of Flintshire, determined to show the world that he has not received what Mr. SIDNEY HERBXBT says he has-" a lesson from the General " Election."
The fate of the Peelite party itself indepd shows, as much as facts can show anything, the inherent weakness of the ground upon which a small coterie maintains itself contra mundumn. A smal L-not of men may go on for some time flattering itself upon its esoteric correctness and exclesive possession of truth in the midst of the whole mnistaken world; but, sooner or later, it has to give up its position. The Peelite idea, whatever it is, cannot as a matter of fact keep the Peelites together any longer. They are pailing off Mr. GL&nsToNE to Lord DERBY, Mr. SIDNEY ERRBERT to Lord PAnUMsrTON. The names of CAEDWELL, R. PEriosE, R. PAnma, Sir J. HoGG, Lord A. HuvEyV, and A. GORDON, do not appear in the list of the new Parliament. The rank and file, then, are gone-have vanished altogether-and the generals have gained two opposite sides of the House. What has been foreseen, then, has at last taken place, and the Peelite party is no more. Their ground has been too narrow to keep them together, and they have incurred the fate of al1 parties tbat trust to an artficial and esoteric standard of political truth. The world is not certVin to be right on any subject; but, after all, it is more likely to be right than any one given circle or set.
That, despite of the many statutes against
That, despite of the many statutes against Bribery and unfair practices at Elections, corruption has existed, does exist, and wiiU continue to exist, is a most certain and, sentimentalists would add, a most melancholy fact. We who have seen more than one Election are not very sanguine as to the perfectibility of human nature, and shall be well content if we see corruption reduced to its minimum. Every measure which can render Bribery more difficult is a good measure. No measure, no series of measures, will suffice to extingush it altogether, but if we cannot arrive exactly at the goal let us get as near to it as possible. Candidates can do much-constituencies more. They stand to each other in the relation of buyers and sellers; but if candidates refuse to buy, and constituencies to sell, the trade must die a natural death. What the condition of affairs is in England we ]now, or nearly so, and we are not inclined to adopt any very arrogant tone in consequence of our knowledge; but what is it in Ireland ? There we are told that undue influences of many kinds are at work. We hear of coalitions in one county between the Rump of the old Tory party and the ultra-Romanists; in another the old fleshless phantom of the Tenant League reigns triumphant; in more than one borough there is talk of the most barefaced venality. Let us not expect too much from human nature. What can an Irish voter know of fair voting-au Irish voter who has been cajoled by the elder O'Com:v,--who has been infuriated by the Young Ireland Party-who has been threatened with temporal penalties by his landlord and with eternal pains by his priest-who has been bubbled by the Tenant League leadersand who has lived to see a succession of the purest patriots selling themselves at rates varying from 5001. to 1,2001. a-year per patriot? What wonder is it, we say, if under such circumstances men should arrive at the conclusion that the best thing to do with a vote is to dispose of it in market overt for a valuable consideration, like a pound of pork or a pound of butter ? The most serviceable instrument for immediate use of which we know in such a case is the Election Committee. Let matters be as bad as they may, half a dozen good exposures may be of some avail. Let us be made acquainted with the internal worldngs of Irish electoral corruption, with the ludicrous as well as the pitiable side of it. Few abuses nowadays can withstand publicity. Let us, for example, hear something of recent occurrences in the borough of Sligo.
In the Dublin journals we find it recorded that Mr. J. BAL, Under-Secretary for the Colonies, and late M.P. for the county of Carlow, has retired from the contest for the representation of Sligo on account of the open venality of the voters. This is, as far as it goes, very high - spirited and very creditable conduct on his part; butt, unless there were strong private reasons to the contrary, it might have been more politic to persevere in the contest, and to petition against a return which could scarcely, on inquiry, have been maintained. It is, however, no wonder that a man of decent feeling-and such Mr. Joui
BArL has undoubtedly proved himself to be throughout his public career-should rather make up his mind to retire into private life than to wallow through such a pool of corruption as the borough of Sligo appears to be. The sacrifice, though, is a great one. In Mr. BALs'S case, we fear it means an enforced retirement not only from Parliament, but from public life, and this because he will not consent to pay for the suflrages of men who have been debased by a long course of corruption. We can only hope that Mr. BALL will be able to find another seat, and that the venality with which he openly charges the electors of Sligo may be made the subject of a stringent inquiry. Participation in Bribery at Sligo cost M1r. SToNon his appointment; it would be hard indeed if a resolute refusal to incur a similar disgrace should inflict a similar deprivation upon Mr. JOILY BA.

The British Expedition To Persia.
THE BRITISE .EXFDITIOK TO P. S,
(nOM0 oop. WOORFhSPOXD!XT.)
CA"P BEFORE BUSHRE:, F1z IL
In continuation of mny lat from Margheel, near Basra, I have to inform you that the inquiries set on foot to discover the temper of the Arib tribes about Mohamcera'h were most steceseful. There can be little doubt of our army receiving pasive co-operation at lea5t from all the tribes in Irfk Araby. Some of the latter have already compromised themselves with the Persian Government, owing chief1y, we presume, to the fear of our considering and treating them as enemies. No agreement whatever has been entered into betweeen the British and these tribes; but they have been given to understand generally that we make lo war upon such as are dispoed to treat usas friends. Theyare consequently left free to settle the problem of their allegiance as they think fit.
The Hugh Lindusy steamed away from Basra at 4 p.m. of the 3d, and anchored for the night a few miles above Mohammerah. Early next morning our party again reconnoitred the fortifications, which were crowded with armed men; but the steamer was alloived to pursue her way unmolested. A new 'work had been added, nierced for three guns, and from the improved styfe of the masonry it is presumed that some 'rained engineers have lately reached this post. According to the accounts collected from reliable sources, the gresent garrison of Mohammerah consists of 5,000 men, with from 10 to 12 field-guns. At Ahwb.z, on the Karoon, the Persians are said to have three fojes, with four guns and two howitzers. The whole of thetroops are under the command of Ihtisham-oodDowlah Khaulee Mfirza.
While the reoonnoitring party were absent from Bushire the force encamped there was caUed into action, and a good blow has been struck in this quarter. Information had reached Sir James that the Persians wete mustering at Borazgaun (a large village in the Desht, about 42 miles distant), and had already collected there an army of 10,000 men, with 12 field-pieces, under Shooja-ool-Moolk. There could be no hope of winning over the Ellyats, or of securing their passive co-operation with us, while so large a force held a position between us and the mountain passes. Sir James consequently determined upon dislodging them, and, if possible, seizing their guns before they could make goodtheir retreat. The entire force , with the exception of such details as were requisite for the defence of the camp, started accordingly on the night of the 3d, and reached Borazgaun on the morning of the 5th, though it rained almost incessantly after their departure from Bushire. The enemy, however, had retired from their entrenchments several hours previously, taking their guns with them, but abandoning an immense quantity of ammunition and tnat6rie, which was entirely destroyed during the three days that our force remained at Borazgaun. As it would have been sheer madness to pursue the enemy into the Kotoo-Molloo PaSs beyond Dalike, with an army prepared and equipped only for a surprise upon their entrenched position, Sir James prudently determined upon returning to Bushire, prefacing his departure by the explosion of an enormous amount of the enemy's ammunition and other military stores. The force marched at 9 p.m. of the 7th. When about two hours front Borazgaun word was passed to the front that the rear-guard was attacked, andthe balls from the enemy's artillery soon verified the report. General Oatram and his staff immediately galloped back, when, on arriving near the scene of action, the general's horse fell, which completely stunned him for two or three hours. The main body of the army now faced about and proceeded to support the rear-guard, who were by this time hotly engaged. As it was pitch dark, however, no offensive movements could well be niade on our part; the army was therefore collected together in a compact body, the regiments at quarter-distance columns, and the artillery and cavalry so placed that their respective services might be brought into play as required. The whole army remained in this position, maintaining perfect silence and order, aitil daybreak, when it was formed in line of battle (Sir James having by this time recovered sufficiently to assume the command, with supports and reserves, and tho word to advance was given. The fight now resolved itself into an artiUery and cavalry battle; the 3d Cavalry, making a charge against a compact square of infantry formed to receive them, went completely through it, and buta very few-some say not oneescaped of-the 500 men who composed it. This harge was the. main feature of the fight. The a- tillery were in the meantime taking a splendid part in the engagement, their shell and round s'hot, at a range of about 400 yards, making great gaps in the enemy's ranks. The Persians at about 8 a.m. began to retire, and finally retreated into a thick date jungle, leaving two 9-pounder guns and two standards in our hands, and about 800 dead upon the field. Our loss has been wonderfully trifling, considering the heavy artillery fire which was kept up throughout the night upon our army. One oflicer, Lieutenant Frarland, and 11 men were kdlled, and two officers and about 50 men were wounded. The enemy's force was estimated at 7,500 men and five guns.
After a halt of six hours the army started again at 8 p.m., through pelting rain and mud fully ankledeep, and reached Charghadack at 9 next morning. At noon of the same day the bulk of the army marched over the AMasheela swamp, and arrived safely in camp late in the evening, having accomplished a march of 42 miles in 50 hours, fought a pitched battle, and driven the enemy back to their mountain fastnesses. Had our cavalry been numericaly stronger, there can be little doubt that every one of the enemy's guns would have been secured and his army utterly annihilated. As it is, this sudden and decisive blow cannot fail to convince the Persians of what hardy stuff British soldiers are composed, and we hope that it will produce an adequate effect upon the Council of the Shah.
Yesterday the remains of the brave men who had fallen were interred. A public funeral was ordered, and the service was most solemn and affecting. The bodies, enveloped in white shrouds, were laid before the altars in the respective Protestant and Roman Catholic church tents, the two Generals, the Staff, and almost every officer of the force, besides soldiers, attending. After the appointed offlce had been read the bodies were laid on two horse-artillery waggons, folowed by the whole cortige above enumerated, and conveyed to the burialground beyond the entrenchments. The serious demeanour of the entire party, and the solemn responses of numbers who joined audibly in the concluding portion of the services, showed that a deep religious feeling was not wanting to our army.
FEBAIJRY 14.
To-day additional draughts for our force have been landed, and it is pretty well decided that as soon as the remaining portion of the 2d Division arrives a part will be despatched for the capture of Mohammerah. Whether it will be found advisable or not to proceed to Shuster does not yet appear; Sir James wiU decide that after securing the former post. In the meantime he cannot detach too large a force from before Bushire, because another considerable army, under a new commander, is assembling near Borazgaun. Should speedy success attend Sir James's movements on the Euphrates and Karoon, we should not wonder at his at once returning to Bushire, routing the Persians a second
time irom Borazgaun, and taking up an advanced position there, ready to march upon Shiraz as soon as the season is propitious.
The best spirit and feeling animate every portion of the Britiah camp, and, the Tnen who underwent such hardships the other day wre anxious to be led on to another conflict. It cannot be denied, however,'that, for an advanceinto the heart of Persia Sir Jamesvill requirQstrongreinforcements, especiallyof European troops, who are better fitted to endure the cold of-the north of Persia than the Soppys. No delay should oecur'in despatcbing thisepeld;for repeated blowFs, quicky foAovvedup, will be the readiest way to effect our object with the Shah, and thfts to shorten the war.

I understand that* Shoojah-ool Moolk has been disgraced, and that an army of 30,000 men is being coUected just below the mountain passes. Nothing would be more opportune than the descent of this armyinto the -plains, Eince 'there bat be little doubt but that our troops would give themr a severe handling, and. thereby open s more easy transit through the pasees.

PERSIA.
(FoRM OUR OWN COonz3O ENn .)
BOMBAY, MARCH 5.
On the afternoon of Monday last, the 2d, a ateamer arrived with despatches from the Persian Gulf, bringing the intelligence of a smart action between the expeditionary force under Sir Jame3 Outram and a body of Persians commanded by Shah Soojah-ool-Moolk, ending in the total defeat of the latter, with a very considerable loss in men and material.
General Outram landed at Bushire on the 27th tDf January. It soon came to his knowledge that the Persian Government were about to make a vigorous attempt to recapture the plaee. With this view They were assembling a large force of all arms at a village caled Burazjoon, about 46 miles from Bushire, and near the mouths of the hill passes that lead up to Shiraz. It was reported that Soojah-ool-Moolk, commanding at the place, had already round his colours 8,500 men, and it was certain that very large reinforcements were on their way to join him. Under these rcircumatances, the General formed the bold resolultion of anticipating the impending attack by himself assuming the offensive. On the 2d of February he found himself strengthened by the arrival from Bombay of the 1 st Brigade of the 2d Division, consisting of the 78th Highlanders and the 26th Native Infantry, and he made his preparations accordingly. A detachment of about 1,800 men (sick included), with a company o' European artiUery and 14 guns, was reserved for the protection of the camp and town of Bushire, and was strengthened ,by a party of seamen from the several ships in the harbour. The remainder of the force, num,bering 419 sabres, 4,300 bayonets, and 18 guns, marched from the camp on the evening of the 3d. No tents were' taken, nor auy extra clothing. Each man carried his great-coat, blanket, and two days' rcooked provisions. The commissariat had ready three days' provisions in addition. During the advance the weather was severe and trying in the extreme. The nights were bitterly cold, and the rain lell in violent storms, tiU the dusty plain was ankle deep in mud. Nevertheless, the troops accomplished the 46 miles in 41 hours, and on the afternoon of The 5th found themselves in front of the enemy's Intrenched position at Burazjoon. But the enemy was not there. On the previous evening, learning the approach of the English, he had precipitately abandoned his works, carrying off his guns, but leaving behind him his camp equipage and large quantities of ammunition and stores. Unable to come to close quarters with his opponents, who had retired to the strong mountain passes, whither it would have been imprudent to follow them, the General prepared to return to Bushire. The stores of flour, rice, and grain found in the abandoned camp, and which the Persian Government had been long amassing, were collected for removaL The magazines and ammunition, containing in all nearly 40,0001b. of powder, were destroyed. On the night of the 7th the return march commenced, and had lasted but an hour or two, when the rear guard was attacked by the enemy in force. It subsequently appeared that Soojah-ool-Moolk and his officers had plauned an assault for this night upon our troops at Burazjoon, and, upon hearing of their de parture, determined to vary the scheme, by attacking them on their line of march. Accordingly they hastened after the column, and, coming up with it about midnight, threatened it from every side, creating at first no small amount of confusion. General Outram, riding rapidly in the dark, came in contact with a baggage mule, and horse and man rolled over together, the General receiving a contusion so violent as to render him insensible tiUl nearly the end of the action. Major-General Stalker, however, succeeded to the command, and, assisted by Colonel Lugard, chief of the staff, formed up the troops so as to protect the baggage and resist an attack of cavalry, from whatever quarter it might be made. After a while the enemy got up four heavy guns and opened fire with great accuracy. Had they but known how e-. etly they had gotourrange they wouldno doubt havekept usp their fire, to our veryserious loss; but, receivingno reply from our artillery, which was silent intentionally to deceive them, theyfanciedthey were throwing their shot away, and ceased firing in about half an hour. As the night advanced, the incessant sound of the enemy'sbugles gave promise of an action in the morning, and when day broke he was seen drawa -up in battle array. The Persian force which thus awaited the shook of a British attack is estimated to have amounted to between 6,000 and 7,000 men, with a fair proportion of guns, but how many does not seem to be exactly known. They had 18, it was believed, in the camp at Burazjoon; but tome of these had been hidden in wells or othervise, and rendered useless by the loss of their wheels and axles, which were taken in the camp ,by us. Their infantry was almost entirely composed of regulars, and included one regiment of The Persian Guards, 900 strong. Of cavalry they had perhaps 800; so that their force was respectable both in numbers and composition, and a atout resistance might have been looked for from it. Yet it was routed speedily and utterly. The British artillery and cavalry moved to the attack, with the infantry in support. The guns opened fire with the eelerity and accuracy characteristic of an artillery zecond to none in the world. The Persian gunners were paralyzed, their pieces silenced, and the whole line of infantry fell rapidly into confusion. Then the handful of eavalrycharged. The Persian horsemen did not meet them, and the infantry went down by scores. The line was pierced through and through. The Poonahhorse feU upon the KashkaiRegiment, and captured its standard. The 3d Cavalry ehargeda corps which had thrownitself into a squara, broke its formation, and cut down nearly every man. The rout became general, and by 10 o'clock, before the infantry could come up to take a share in the fight, the Persians were flying in al directions. Had we
been stronger in cavalry, probably hardly a man vould have escaped. Certainly all the guns would hiave been captureo, As it was, two onlY remained in the hands of the victors; but some hundreds of the enemy lay dead upon the field, and their loss in wounded -must have- been very great. On the English .ide one officer was killed, Lieutenant Frankland, Brigade .Major of Cavalry, Who 'was shot thronagh. the head in the charge. Captain Forbes, commanding the 3d Cavalry, received a musk-et ball through the thigh, and two officers of the 64th, CaptainMoekler and Lieutenant Greentree, were woundod-the latter losing a foot by a rouncd shot during the noeturnal cannonade.
ihe totalof killed and wounded was 72. The return znarch -to Bnsiire was accomplished in 50 hours, over a country rendered almost impa8ssble by heavy and continuous rain. Such was the reult of the first meeting between British and Persian troops in the open plain. The day was the 8th of February, the name of the place Khooshab.

The 25th Native Infantry, now stationed at Ahmedabad, have received orders to hold themselves in readiness to proceed on foreign service, and it seems likely that the 3d European Regiment, from Poonah, wil go also. The latest item of news of this kind that I am aware of is the receipt to-day by the authorities at the Arsenal of an order to prepare two 8-inch mortars, two 8-inch howitzers, and six 12 lb. iron guns, for immediate shipment. These pieces are, no doubt, intended to strengthen the works at Bushire, preparatory perhaps to the place being left in charge of a sufficient garrison, while the bulk of the army proceeds up the Gulf to Mohamereh, at the mouth of the river Karun.

HONGKONG, FEm. 15.
The steamer Cadiz arrived here on the 1st inst., bringing English news to the 10th of December; ri<? Calcutta, we have telegraphic news from England to tho 26th of December. The Cadiz leaves to-day with the outward mails.
Since I wrote you on the 30th ult. the occurrences have been unimportant.
Allum's trial commenced on the 2d instant, and after an investigation which lasted five days he obtained a verdict by a majority of the jury of " Not guilty."
The evidence is given at full length in the local papers. It was chiefly circumstantial, and, although it did not prove sufficient to lead to a conviction, a strong feeling exists as to the guilt of the. principal persons tried. The case was ably conducted on the part of the Crown by the Attorney-General, the Hon. Mr. Anstey.
On the prisoners leaving the Court-house they were re-apprehended as suspicious characters under a late Government notification, and Alluim, I believe, is to be detained in the 3neantime.
At Hongkong all remains quiet. The addition to the forces that has lately taken place has allayed any uneasiness that previously existed in case the place should be attacked by the Chinese. The private steamer Sir James Brooke arrived here on the 31st ult., taken up by the Government of Singapore, and brought on from the Straits about 210 men of the 29th and 38th Regiments 'Madras Native Infantry (Major Cazalet, Commander), and some gun Lasears and Madras artilerymen.
Her Majesty's sloop Elk, 12 guns, and brig Camilla, 16 guns, arrived here on the 10th inst. The Company's steamer Auckland is also here.
The United States steamer San Jacinto and sloop Levant are still in harbour.
The French mail steamer Catinat has gone on a cruise. The Virginie went out, I believe, in consequence of advices being received of a disaster to the French ship Anais, with Coolies on board. The vessel left Swatow on the 29th ult., bound for Havannah. The foUowing day the Coolies rose, murdered the captain,mate, and supercargo, and ran the ship ashore near Breakers Point, where the remainder of the crew landed. They were taken charge of by the authorities, and would be, I hear, forwarded to Swatow.
Admiral Seymour left this on the 6th inst.,. in Her Majesty's steamer Barracouta, and came down for the mail last evening in the Niger.
There is little to report of oceurrences up the river.
An attempt was made at the end of last month to burn Her Majesty's ship Comus, which was nearly proving successfuL Two junks were sent down upon her. They were on fire, and alongside very quickly. One cleared the vessel without doing much injury ; the other was got clear with difficulty, and at one time the danger appeared imminent, the flames being over the fore part of the ship. No serious damage was done.
Numerous junks stiU keep in proximity to our ships; there are no means at present of following them. Two small river steamers have been fitted with guns, but even these will scarcely prove of sufficiently light draught of water to allow them to follow the junks.
The comparative impunity with which the junks have fired at the steamers on one or two occasions apparently induced the Chinese to act with less caution on the 10th inst., when Her DMajesty's steamer Hornet, Captain Forsyth, and a small river steamer, under charge of Lieutenant Dent, were attacked by a fleet of about 200 junks. Captain Forsyth anchored the Hornet abeam of the junks, and opened fire, which, we hear, was very precise, and must have done a greal deal of damage.
A Chinese report of the affair stated that the junks suffered severely.
Nfight coming on the fleet could not be followed up the creek. One large junk was cut out by the H ornet's boats, two sank, and two blew up.
Pekin (Eazeties to the 6th of January report several successes gained over the rebels, and the retaking of some of the towns in the province of Hopeb. The retirement of the rebels from some of their posts to reinforce their body at Nankin, where disorder still continued, is stated as the origin of these reported Imperial successes. YuYaou, a town about 30 miles from Ningpo, is said to have been taken by the insurgents, the head Mandarin killed, and about 300 of the Imperial soldiers.
The Gazettes do not contain any allusion to the troubles with foreigners at Canton.
The report is correct of an edict having been issued to the high officers of the coast provinces not to interfere with the quarrel at Canton.
Yeh irs said to have orders to establish peace, but nothing is said of opening Canton.
At Ningpo con,iderable excitement prevailed towards the end of last month, and the missionaries left the place; but at the last date, 1st iust., all was quiet. The cause of this apprehension appeared to be a permission from the Intendant to the Canton men to make an attack on the lorcha men. The permission, however, was withdrawn, and no disturbance took place.
Shanghai advices are to the 'th inst.
Our relations with the Chinese authorities there continued amicable.
Trade had not been renewed since the Chinese holydays-26th of January. Previous to that date a large business had been done in imports, but the settlements of produce had been small, owing to short supplies and the high prices asked.
The currency remained in the same unsatisfactory state.
Longoloths.-Grays quoted $1.78 to $2.05; whites, $1.35 to $1.90. Supplies heavy.
Silk.-About 2,500 bales settled at an advance of fully $10 per picul. No. 3 Tsatlee quoted $3'5 to $380; No. 4, $360; Taysaam, middling to fair, $290 to $310; inferior to middling, $250 to $280. The total export from China since 1st of July, 1856, to date is 69,000 bales.
Tea.-Twelve chops of new Ningehow had been settled, after considerable competition, at about 3 taols advance on last month's prices. There were on. the market eight chops of dmilar tea, of the same quality, held for 18 to 20 taels. About 25 chops Ningehow, yet to arrive,'would finish the season's crop.

Amoy dates are to the 4th instant. Business ha I been resumed. The prices of cotton yarn wera higher, and 290 bales, mostly 16-24, sold at $24.5) to $26.10. Qray shirtings, 1,350 pieces; 6i cattie I sold at $2. About 2,200 bales of cotton sold at $3 to $10.
The Sampson was at Amoy. Nothin9 was seen of the pirate fleet of which she was sent in search.
At Canton, we learn from Chinese, great distress prevailed, and rice had gone up in price to $34 to $34 per picul. The authorities had taken possession of a large quantity of rice stored in the Chinese packhouses belonging to foreigners, and we understand other goods were sold and the proceed. paid into the Imperial Treasury.
At Hongkong little or nothing is doing in the way of trade. Rice has advanced to $2.90 pe pioul, in consequence of the demand for Canton and the neighbourhood.
Exchange on England, 4s. 7id. to 4s. 8id.; on India, 216 to 217 rs. Tonnage is abundant. Many ships have left seeking freights, and a large number have been taken up for emigrants to Australia and California. 3,000 Chinese emigrants have gone to Australia since the commencement of this year, and the vessels on the berth will take about 7,00) more.
Dr. Parker, theUnited States Minister, addressed Yeh, askdng him to allow Americans to remove their property from Canton. Yeh replied that all approaches to the city were commanded by the British vessels, and recommended that the Americans should move to the other ports to trade.
The Hon. MTr. Mercer, Colonial Secretary, is passenger for England by the Cadiz, on leave of absence. The acting appointment has been conferred on Dr. Bridges, with permission to continue his private practice as a barrister.

LATEST INTEiLLIGENCE.
We have been favoured with a copy of the Ho_gkong Re1ister of the 17th of February, brought by the Fiery Cross. We extract the following:-
" The Auckland, with the Eaglet in company, ran down to outside Lingting on Saturday last. The steamers found no vessels at the anchorage. They ran round outside Lingting with equally bad success, and then returned to the islands south of Lantao. Commencing at Chungehow, they ran down both sides of the islands, but found nothing suspicious. About 3 a.m. on Sunday they fell in with a lorch. off the western end of Lantao, which proved to be the armed Portuguese lorcha Amazona, escorting some other lorchas. They had seen nothin. At daybreak the steamers went northward, the Eaglet going to the western, the Auck-
land to the eastern side of Inner Lingting. They ran up a, little beyond Deep Bay, into which they looked, without seeing a vestige of any of the fleet. Seeing clearly the birds had flown, they were retmuning, satisfied no more was to bo done. When off Toong-Chung they sighted four large heavily armed Mandarin junks, which, it is said, have been intercepting provision and other boats coming to Hongkong. The steamers saw the boats were heavily armed and manned, and they therefore ran into them. The Auckland unfortunately got ashore on a bar, but the Eaglet ran in with the boats. The junks opened fire, and continned it verybriskly, but without doing any damage; the steamers and boats returned the fire, and the junks were captured and burnt, and the boats then pushed for shore. On landing they captured a battery mounting 16 guns, which they spiked, and, as far asg e could make oat, sL_firo to a village near it Th, place is at the bottom of a bay, of which the western side is foaned by an island called Chu-loo-cok, which approaches near to the mainland. There were extensive fortifications perceived to the west, and it was not deemed prndent to attack on that aide. The casualties were-one man sh.t dead through the eye, and four wounded, belonging to the Auckland. The Eaglethad20men of the Gaol Brigade-we are told they behaved admirably. The Eaglet expended all her ammunition, and returned yesterday afternoon to report the state of affairs. On the 16th the Niger got under way and went out, and the Eaglet is to follow (she may have left ere this) as soon as she could got coal and ammunition, and send the dead and wonnaed men on shore. On her way here the Eagleot passed a very heavily armed and manned snake boat, and was glad to Fneak past, not having a single charge of shot to fire."

The following is the letter of our Calcutta correspondent, dated Feb. 23:-
" The Five per Cent. Loan has failed. The subscriptions were from the first few and far between, and the conduct of the Bank of Bengal has brought them to a close. On the 5th instant it raised its rate of interest on deposit of Government securitiej to 14 per cent., a rate it has naintained, and 'which, even in India, is Without a precedent. It was at first imagined that the Bank Directors, a.1 largely interested in compelling Government to receive foa-r per cent. paper in part subscrip-
tion to the loan, were putting on the screw with that end only. I beheve, however, that they had no option, that money was welling out faster than the charter permits, and that even the present rate must soon be raised. The accounts from Bombay are equally unfavourable. Madras never has any money, and the Europeans all over India are waiting in the certainty that the Government must give way. The native capitaliats of Czlcutta, who care nothing about Bank rates, but act on a system of their own, are determined that the Fours shall be tal-en up, and they have a power of combination of which Europeans are incapable. Almost for the first time in this century, therefore, the Go-
vernment of India cannot raise moneyat 5 percent. I have given you the immediate reasons for the diffioulty, but there is one which lies deeper still The financial blundering of the last four years has created a deep feeling of distrust. It is of no use to tell natives that all the past operations have boen I just and legitimate. They reply that their property
has been depreciated 20 per cent., while GovernI ment, by offiering to pay them off in full, tacitly pledged themselves that it should n6t be depreciated at alL, That is theirargument; and, right orwrong, until the Fours are -called up,:, the - istut will i not be removed.

" The secrets of the Treasury are very closely kept, but it seems impossible that Govermnent should hold out. The expenditure at Bombay must be very great indeed, ancd Bombay never had a very large reserve. There were 2,000,0001., I believe, inthe Bombay Treasury when the war began; but there is the ordinary expenditure and the pay of a great army to meet out of this reserve. Money mxust be had somewhere, and the only expedient other than. surrender is to raise the sum required in England. Such a measure would strike a severe blow at the bazaar combinations, but it would increase that drift of specie to the East of which you all complain, and establish, in my judgment, a most dangerous precedent. Nobody would ever have the most distant idea of what Government intended to do. Every calculation in India would be upset,and the feeling of distrust would be materially increased.
"In addition to the expenditura in tho Persian Gulf we are now,it appears,to commence the system of subsidizing Affghanistan. The Ameer of Cabul,at his recent interview with Sir John Lawrence, demanded money, but refused troops. He was, indeed, in terror lest the latter should be sent against his will. The Govermment of India assented to his demand, and is to pay him a stipulated sum per month. The Friend of India says a lac (10,0001.) a-month, but that figure must be below the mark. They require in return permission to send three officers to Candahar, which after a stout fight was granted, and the Ameer left Peshawar in a most sulky humour. The money, whatever its amount, is to be employed in the defence of Candahar, and, if possible, the recapture of Herat. It is more than doubtful whether it will be so expended. Most Englishinen, for some unknown reason, have all idea that Dost Mahomed is a very worthy high-spirited individual, with some chivalry in his nature. Those who know him better declare that he is simply an Affghan, brave and proud, but innately treacherous, and subject to those gusts of caprice which every now and then sweep over Asiatics. He is in great personal trouble. His sons are alwais quarrelling, his kinsmen are disaffected, and even his own tribe begins to think his sagacity diminished. The con. quest -of Uandahar exhausted his treasury, and there has been a bad year in the mountains. It is feared, therefore, that he will expend the British subsidy in improving his personal position, and Iet the Persi occupy Candahar If they like. In tjhat case we shallbe compelled to restore our prestige by marching on Candahar ourselves. That is not a difficult operation. The Bolan and the base of the Bolan are both in our own hands, which they were not in 1838. The valley beyond is, in fact, a broad plain, as open to cavalry as a prairie. The fortress might be seized in a week, and the Persians are no match for Sikh Irregulars. Of course, such a movement would be horribly expensive, would lead u3 out of India Proper, and would involve an increas, of the army; but it is none the less certain that a strong Govermment in possession of Candahar could pour a force Into Scinde whenever it chose, and that Northern India would then be held by the tenure on which the Austrians hold Lombardy.
" We have had a very disagreeable business at BarrackPore. The cartridges for the new Enfield rifle are greased at one end to make them slip easily into the barrel. The Government ordered mutton fat fof the purpose. Some contractors, to save a few shillings, gave pigs' fat and bullocke' fat instead. The Sepoys found this out, and there was an immediate explosion of caste feeling. Government, they said, was going to make them Christians. They held, it is said, nocturnal meetings, and discussed wild plans for seizing the Fort and Treasury of Calcutta. The Government istantly directed the fat to be withdrawn, and ghee substituted. Then they got a new fancy. The paper, they said, had animal fat in it. I dare aay this is true, the paper being made in England and sized with animal size; but the regular ELindoo theory is, that what you do noL know cannot hurt your caste. Still there was a very high degree of feeling, and the Brigadier at last addressed the men, told them Government had no notion of making them Christians, and pledged his word that there was no such deeign. The men wera again quieted, but they soongot a new crotchet. The news, they said, had reached their homes, and they wouldbeturned out of caste before they couldexplain. This is nonsense, and Government stands prepared on the first overt refusal to do dutytouse force. I believe the excitement will pass away without the occurrence of so frightful a necessity.
II From Pegu, so long tranquil, we hear of a commotion, to which the impooing appelLatiou of ' rebellion' has been affixed. A robber chief, by name Min ILoung, of the Kareen tribe,
bad got together a party of desperadoes to the number of sever hundred, at the head of
whom he infested a whole disWict, robbing and
murdering travellers, and rendering life and pro-
perty generally insecure. His culminating offence was th,e torture and murder of a party of seven native -merchants, followed by the burning of a
village. A detachment, consisting of three companies of E[er Majesty's 35th and a company of the 48th Native Infantry, were sent to capture or extirpate him. The robber was found to have stockaded himself in a jungle. An attack by the troops took
place, and according to one account Min Loung was driven from his lair, while another report avers that the adailants were repulsed. At any rate, it appoars certain that, whatever may have been the loss among hits men, the chief himself was not taken or, otherwise dis.
posed of. The 35th had two sergeants, the 18th two privates,'shot'dead, and in each detachment there was a considerable number of wounded Further

Their argument is that the Courts are too bad, that their lives may be xworn away at any moment, and that a magistrate who may be a tative can give them two years' imprisonmnent without a jury. There is no doubt that the matter hns teen pushed too far. There are ono or two new crimes created by the code, upon which perjury is absurdly easy, and native magistrates are some
tinies bitterly hoahi'e to Europeans. Thus it is a | criminal offence to say anything that may offend the modesty of any woman. So it should be, perhap.; 'but who is to refate such a charge, supported by ear-witnesses at two annas a-pieca? It is also a penal offence to say anything insulting to any creed. As the missionaries say, they may be put in prison for exposing Hindooism. I am not without hope that a jury may be granted in all theie cases. As for the amalgamation of the Courts it is opposed by everybody, except the Friend of India, aud those who believe with it that the curse of Bengal is the Sudder Court, and there is no chance of its passing the Legislative Council.
" Mr. Grant has brought forward his scheme for the improvem?nt of the judiciary. He would have a Chief Judge in each division, who in all importaut cases should sit with the Zillah Judge and principal Sadder Ameen. Their decision should be final on the facts, an appeal on the law only lying to the Sudder Court. This innovation would bo beneficial if we could find the men, but we cannot. There are no judges at present in Bengal, most of those even on the Bench of the Sudder Court being notoriously incapable.
"'The Government of India has publisbed the first series of annual reports. These are reports prepared by every Governor and Lieutenant-Governor in India, describing the condition and progress of his territories during the official year. They form two ma3sive blue-books, the basis of the future history of India. I have not been able to wade through them yet, but I hope to send you an analysis of them by the next maiL. For the present I will notice that there is no general report for all India.
" Several changes have been made recently among the provincial governors Mr. Coverley Jackson, Chief Commissioner of Oade, has been sent back to the North-Western, Provinces, and Sir Henry Lawrence. has obtained the appointment. He has only one disqualification. He always regards the question of exemption from the land-tax as one of property, instead of one of taxation. He therefore favours all such claims, and i the Punjab sacrificed revenue at a frightful rate. He is, however, a clear-sighted, determined ruler, and will keep the province in order. Two regiments of the local infantry have just volunteered for Persia; so much for the discontent of the fighting class at the annexation I The cquntry is as tranquil as possible, and indigo-planting has commenced. As to the King, he is simply forgotten.

ALBXANI)RA, MjLRn 24.
The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamers Valetta and Indus arrived here on the 18th and 19th inst., and sail to-day for Marseilles and Southampton with the India and China mails, which reached Suez on the 20th and 22dinst.
The Etna, with the outwvard Australian mails, reached Alexandria on the 8th inst., after a voyage of 12 davs from Southampton, including a detention of 26 hours at Malta; but we are stil withoat intelligence of the Oneida, expected at Suez, from MIelbourne.
The Viceroy has not yet visited Alexandria since his return from the Soudan about a month ago. Indeed he has passed almost the whole of that time at a country residence on the banks of the Damietta branch of the Nile, whither his Eighness retired shortly after his retura to Cairo, after having confided the conduct of public affairs to the re-organized Administrations, the direction of
shich he has given to the severai members of his own family. His Tigbness's nephew, Achmed asha, eldest son of the lateIbrahim Pasha, and heir apparent to the throne, has been appointed Minister for Internal Affairs, a post for which Achmed Pasha, from his personal knowledge of the wants of the country, and from his generalcapacity for business, is looked upon as eminently well fitted. Halim Pasha, brother of the Viceroy, has been appointed to the War-office; Mustapha Bey, Achmed Pasha's younger brother, to the Financial Department; and Ismail Pasha remains President of the Deliberative Council, to which all matters not pertaining to the ordinary routine of business will continue to be stxbmitted. The Viceroy, it is said, has expressed his determination to abstain from all interference with the proceedings of his Ministry and of the Council; but their decisions, especially in matters of importance, will be subject to the approval of his Higbness, who has, moreover, reserved to himself the direction of all affairs connected with the foreign relations of the country.
Among other measures which attended the return of Said Pasha must be mentioned the order for disbanding the greater part of the men who had been collected for military service, as mentioned in a former letter, an act which has caused no rsmall astisfaction throughout the country; and the discontent on the part of the commercial community of Alexandria, arising from the cession to a private merchant of the wharf formerly used for the shipment of Government prodtuce, has been appeased by the issue of an order for the immediate construction of an additional mole, which, as has always been the case with the other wharfs, will be open to the use of the publio free of all charge.
The works on the Cairo and Suez Railway are progressing with every despatch, and 39 miles of rails have been laid, upon which a daily trafflic is conducted for the conveyance of men and mtiel. At the present moment the temporary branch which is to connect the line with the central station of the old carriage road is in course of execution, the object being to render the first half of the line at once available for the conveyance of goods and pa3sengers in transit through the country. M. Mouchelet, the chief engineer of the line, seems, notwithstanding the alarming reports that have lately obtained circulation, to be perfectly unshaken in his con&dence that the work will be brought to a successful isue; and it is even asserted that, as far as regards difficulties arising from the nature of the ground the greatest have been already overcome, The totai rise of the line will, I am informed, be about 700 feet, the highest gradient being 1 in 175. There is always more or less fear of delay from the difficulty of providing a sufficient number of labourers, but at this moment about 4,000 men are employed on the hne, and Said Pasha having for the present abandoned the intention of commencing the construction of the "Alimentary Canal," in connexion ivith M. de lessepss' project, there is evory probability of that number being fully maintained if not increased.
Among other improvements connected with the transit department, it has been proposed to prolong the railway from the present station at Alexandria, along the banks of the harbour, to the Customhouse and Arsenal, where specie and goods could be landed from the steamers with greater safety, that part of the harbour being completely sheltered from the violent north-west winds which often prevail in the winter season; but the plan is opposed on the ground that its execution would be atterded vith heavy expense, and that it would, moreover, iiterfere with the traffic of the harbour. Up to thQe
resent, therefore, no finral decision appears to hare een aclopted.
Business has been on a very moderate scale durng-tha past fortnight. Stoces of grain are very light, and transactions almost exclusively for local consumption.

Letters from Cadiz bring accounts from Mexico to the 25th February. On the 22d the Spanish frigate Ferrolana opened a smart eannonade upon one of the forts of Vera Cruz, which had for the third time fired on her boats as they were proceedingto the shore to take inwater. The situation of MIexico was still very serious. In the eastern provinces there were fresh demonstrations against Spanish subjects, and the authorities of the country, in spite of the formal orders of the central Government, were, as usual, unable to repress them.

BERLIN, Racn 3L
The following Persian orders and decorations were bestoweed towards the close of last year on certain Russian officers stationed in the Caspian Sea:-.The Supreme Commander of the Harbour of Astrakhan, Vice-Admiral Wasnalieff, received the Order of the Lion and the Sun, 1st class; the commander of the Astrabad, Licharefi the same order, 2d class,with the star ; Captain Vidaleff, commanding the Opyt; Prince Uchtomski, commanding the Eomar; Lieutenant Gellesen, commanding the Trantul; and Lieutenant }?etretschenko, commanding the steamer Kama, received the' same order, 2d class, without the star; orders of the 3d class were also conferred on two other officers and two surgeons. As the Shah of Persia is usually not very profuse in conferring orders and decorations, it may be assumed that the above-mentioned have done him good service either immediately previous to or during the late war in which he was involved with us.
Hitherto all overaea vessels putting into Russian Baltic ports were required to produce proof of their having paid the Sound dues, and the receipt for this paymnent was allowed to stand in the place of a certificate of health. Now that the Sound due3 are to be abolished from April 1, the Russian Government has ordered that all oversea vessels shall be required to produce a clean bill of health from the port where theytook in their cargo; and H they touched at any Englh, French, Dutch, or Norwegian port on their voyage they are to obtain an additional certifcate of health, duly issued by the respective Russian Consuls resident in the ports touched at.
The Journwl de St. Petersbmurg publishes the following interesting details of the military organization of the Chinese:-
" The military forces of China ae estimated at more than 800,000 nien. ln their army rank is hereditary. A soldier can retire from the service only when his son is in a position to replace him; if he has no son of his own he is at liberty to adopt one. It is allowable to enter the serviCe at a, early an age as 15. Gunpowder has been in use among the Chinese from time immemorial; novertheless the Chinesa artillory is far from being as perfect as that of Earope. The balls originally used by tho Chinese artiMerymen wero made of clay dried and hardened.
" In times of peace the soldiers are dispersed over the whole empire, and, in addition to their pay, they are At liberty to cultivate the portions of land that are allotted to them. They are generaly employed by the State in public works, or making roads, and in repairing the banks ot rivers. Their arms consist of sabres, swords, pikes' muskets, bows and arrows. The aussian traveller Timns bowski, who visited a large portion of the Chinese empire, states that the soldiers re clothed the same as the other inhabitants, with the exception of tho tunic, which they wear over all, and whioh is always of the same colour as that of the flag under which they sorve-that is to say, yellow, red, or blue, with or without border. In times of war they recive helmets of iron, enirasss that are quilted and, wadded, and shields of bmaboo wickerwork.
" From the very commencement of a campaign the Chinese endeavour to get posession of tho hostile com-
andoers, either by force or by stratagem. Ou-Tse, the author of a treatise translated by Amiol, rocommends that the drums and the cymbals should be onfided to the most vali nt warriors that can be found,-' For the drams and the cymbals,' says he, ' have to speak to the ears, the flags and th standards to the eyes, recompensos and pauishments to the hearts."'
In the waar which they have waged against their neighbours) or the nations that they have subjected, the Chinese have often been victorious, but their armies, in spite of the great number of their fighting men, are incapable of coping with European tictics.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, April 2.
COUBT OF BANKBUPTCY, BatinghalU-tred, April 2.
1'E M: SAMUEL ADAMS.--TE WVARE AN)D HERTFORD
MINX.
(Before Mr. Oommei.nCr FA,XX.l
X1nS was an adjourned examination meeting in the above case.
Mlr. LAwRANCE, for the assignees, said there must necessarily be an adjournment, owing to a ridiculous omission in the bankrupt's balance-sheet. lHe had 6mitted to mention a sum of 3,0001. due to his estate by Captain Johnston. It would appear that from time to time he had advanced Cap. tain Johnston moneys, and, not wishing the persons in his employ to know the fact, the amount had been debited to personal expenses and the Ware Manor estate. This had been done from shame, and not, as was believed, from any ^ore unworthy motive. The Court would recollect that the bankrupt bad been connected with the suit" iKay v. Johnston and others." Kay was a young heir from whom Johnston had obtained a large amount of bills of exchange. 1aay had sought to prove against the bankrupt's estate for 30, uOl, arising from his transactions with Johnston and Kiay. That claim had been compromised by admitting a proof for 10,0001. It was true that the alteration in the banlkrupt's balance-sheet would not benefit the estate, Johnston being a bankrupt in this Court and awithout estate. It was necessary, however, that the alteration should be 3made.
The CocnxTssxosNm said it was well for the bankrupt that he had admitted the truth before passing his examination, otherwise he might have been prosecuted for perjury.
Mr. LINRLATER, for the bankrupt, said the advances had been made to Kay in the manner stated, and that it was only since the last meeting that the circumstance had occurred to Mr. Adams's recollection. He had thereupon communicated the fact to his assignees. The circumstance having been thus mentioned at Mr. Adams's own suggestion showed that there ws no intention to pass his examination on incorrect accounts.
The bankrupt was examined by L,fr. SARCOOD for creditors in respect to a large square box for corn, which it was insinuated might contain other property. He denied the
allegation.
After somo further evidence in respect to the value of certain property and its alleged depreciation,
His oNioUR ordered an adjournment.
It was stated during the proceedings that tho Court had sanctioned the filing of a biu in Chancery, the object of the bill being to set aside a marriage settlement, on the ground that the bankrupt was not solvent at the time of its execution.
(Before Mr. Commiseoner EvAlNs.)
LN RE GEORGE DEEI;S.
The bankrupt was an estate agent and auctioneer, of Pembridge-villas, Westbourne-grove, and a thustee of the Marylebone Joint-Stock Bank. The liabilities are chiefly on account of the bank.
Mr. LAWRANCE applied on his behalf for a first-class certificate, which was granted, Mr. DAVIS, for the assignees, not objecting.
IN RE PEE GEORGE FOSCOLO.
T'he bankrupt was a merchant and commission agent, of Dunstan-court, Mincing-lane.
This was the examination meeting.
Mr. Lawrance appeared for the bankrupt, and Mr. Surr for the assignees.
The accounts, prepared by Messrs. Turquand, show particularly unsecured debts and liabilities to the amount of about 16,0001., and assets about 1,6001.
The bankruptpsassed.
On the application of Mr. CHIDLEY, the choice of assignees was adjourned in the case of S. Coulding, wine merchant, of i4mehouse.
IN RE OSBORNE.
This was an examination meeting under the estate of William Henry Osborne, wine merchant, of Trinity-house, Water-lane.
Mr. Brewer appeared for the assignees, and 3fessrs. Beesley, Franklin, and Meadows, accountants, with the bankrupt.
The bankrupt iu examination, said at present he resided at Gravesond. had had transactions with a person named Bignell; had had transactions with Bignoll before his last bankruptcy, in November, 1855 - that bankruptcy was almost immediately annulled. He Ld sold Bignell a house and furniture in New-cross; that was in October last year. Mr. O'Grady now had his place in Water-lane, After the bankruptcy a distress for rent had come in. He never wient by the name of Smith. Mferchants genorally disguised their names in taking wine warrants, and he had no doubt he had done so. Did not tell Smith h had made use of his name. He did not remember the case of the Cutstomhouse frauds. He knew nothing about the dock frauds.
Mr. BREWER.-NOw, don't prevaricate. AlU the world knows of the dock frauds.
Examination resumed.-He knew of the action of "Osborne v. the London Dock Company." He did not knor the defence set up was fraud. He did not know that the defence was that the property did not belong to him. The real reason the case went against him was weight of money on the other side.
Mr. BREZEVR.-Wel well, we krow all about that. The case is known aU over London.
Examination continued.-Some wines were vatted in the name of" Smith." Had not stated tbat he was in the habit of using the name of Smith, and Smith using his name, as occasion might require.
Mr. BREVER said he should have to ask for a full aocount of the transactions with Bignell and Smith, and also an account of the bankrupt's purchases from the London Docks.
Mr. Bell, the official assignee, said that the whole' of the books under the for-ier bankrupecy had disappeared, and the bankrupt said they had been destroyed as waste paper.
After some further examination of lbs bankrunt relative to a desk left behind at the " Catherine Wheel,' and Mr. Bignell, of 123, Jermyn-street, licensed victualler, an adjournment was granted.
MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Thursday, April 2.
MIDDLBSEX SESSION'S, Thursday, -pril 2.
(Beforse Mr. PASiILEY, Q.C., Assistant-Judge.)
Joseph Checkledy, 25, and a woman with whom he had cohabited were indicted for having stolen a tablecloth and other articles, the property of Thomas Murray.
The evidence showed that a robbery was committed at-the prosecator's residence, 29, Argyle-street, King's-cross, by some person opening the door with a false key, and the prisoners were seen close by at the time it took place. They were taken into custody subsequently on suspicion, when information was given to the police, and at their lodging a quantity of skeleton keys and burglars' implements were found. The female prisoner was proved to have pawned the property, the duplicates of which were found in her possession. Among the keys taken poss3ssion of by the police there were two which would open the door of the prosecutor's house.
The jury found both prisoners GutUy, and a former conviction was proved against the man by Smee, detective officer of tho General Post-office. He had been summarily convicted several times, and was well known aa one of a gang of thieves many of whom had been transported or sent to penal servitude. The woman was known as a disposer of stolen property.
The ASSISTAsvr-JuoGE sentenced the male prisoner to six 'eas' penal servitude, and the woman to 12 months' hard iabour.
William Leibyer, a smartly dressed young foreigner, described as a surgeon, was indicted for having stolen a gold watch and other articles value 101., the property of Joseph Mlliken, in his dweUing-house.
The prosecutorwasaclerk living in Murray-street, Hoxton, and the prisoner up to the 16th of March was a lodger in his house. Oa that day, sooni after he had gone out as uisual in the morning, MIrs. Milliken discovered that a drawer in her bedroom had been ransacked and a gold watch and cbain and key abstracted, and that four gold rings had been taken from a dressing-case. The prisoner, who hadrepresented that he had been a surgeon in the German Legion, occupied a bedroom adjoining, and from a communication made to the police a look-out was kept for him, and ho was taken into custody in Denmark-street. When tho policeman first soke to him he tried to escape, and denied the charge of
aving robbed the prosecutor's house, but afterwards he made no answer to it. It was proved that he had pawned the property.
The Jury found him Guilty, and the ASSISTA?T.JUfGE sentenced him to nine months hard labour.
Alfred Scott, 24, pleaded " Guilty" to a charge of having stolep a watch, tho property of Edward Benjamin Cresswell,
fro i'his person.
The AssLsTANT-Ju-DGE observed that from a certificate of a former conviction which had been put in it appeared that a term of transportation to which the prisoner had been sentenced for a similar robbery to that of which he had now oonfessed himself guilty would not expire until October, k158, he boing a ticket-of-leave holder, and the Court could
sno, therrfore, now pass a less sentence than six years' penal
Jane BaUey, 30, Sarah Wilson, 20, and Philip Brickwood, 21, a cabman, were indicted for stealing a purse containing money from the person of Daniel Ricbard Davey.
Mr. Rlibton was counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Horry appeared for Brickwood.
'he evidence proved the case. It was an ordinary street robbery. The prosecutor was stopped near Seymour-street, Euston-square, by the female prisontrs, who picked his pocket . Thc man was an accomplice in the transaction. It was stated that he had been respectably brought up, but he had taken to cabdriving as a whim, and had abandoned himself to the constant companionship of women of the basest character.
The jury found aU three Guilty. Bailey was sentenced to L months' hard labour, and the other two to nine months each.
Henry Anderson, 40, the master of a schooner of 175 tong, called the Lovely Crauier, was indicted for having stolen 1581h. of coal, the property of William Cory and others, from a barge in the port of London.
Mr. Way appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Me'ealfe was counsel for the priSOner
From the evidence of Edward Hodson, a boy on board the prisoner's vessel, it appeared that on the 26th of last month they saw a barge adrift, and the prisoner sent him up into the rigging for a boathook, with which they secared the b,rge to the schooner, and the prisoner then went on board the barge and brought about three large buckets of coal on board the Lovely Cruiser. He directed the boy to take the coal down into the forecastle, and on the following day a Thames policeman went and took the greater part of it away. The barge was called the Ann, and belonged to Messs. Cory - and when it was found that the prisoner had been helping nimself to coal he was taken into custody by the police. One of the witnesses said that it was a common tbing for a captain of a vessel to take a bit of coal from a h'arge when he ran short, the owners of which would not think of prosecutinghim for felony. The valub of that whichbwas taken was at the utmost about is. 6d., and Messrs. Cory would not have made the charge.
At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution,
The AssiSi.AN-TJuGE: said there was a failure in point of proof that the coal was actually the property of the proEecutors, and the prisoner must be acquitted.
The forcznan o[the jury said, they were unanimously of pinion that there was no- case agsinst the prieonect and that
Mseleration thould be male in a customa which zen~e
*11Y Person availing himself of it liable to a prosecution for
felony. I
Mr. METCAL said; the prisoner was a very respectable man, and there was not the least reason for supposing that ho had acted with any felonious intention. There. were plenty oE ersons present to testify to his good charactar, wbicu cold not be affeCted by this charge, which was made by the police.
The prisoner was then Acquited.
(Before Mr. CrEAsY.)
Robert Clarke, 35, was indicted for having stolen a watch of the value of 41. 10s., the property of Robert Shill, from his person.
Mr. Platt was counsel for the prosecution; hlr. Ribton appeared for the prisoner.
This was a case of " skittle shaiping." The prosecutor, a simple-loohing feUow, a countryman, stated that he was a carpenter by trade, and now lived at 53, Coldarbour-lane, BlackwalL. On the 10th of March he was returning from his employer's office, where he had been to inquire about work, when he was accostd in the street by the prisoner and another ran, who aked the way to the St. Katharine Docks. He told them, and in the course of a conversation which they forced upon him they said they had made a bet about throwing a certain weight a distance of 25 yards, and asked him if he would be good enough to Pee fair play. He assented, and they went to a beershop in Wiflow.walk, where there was a skittle-ground, but as that was only about a dozen yards long, they seemed very vexed that the bet could not be decided there, and asked him if he would go with them to another place to measure the length and see that the weight was fairly thrown. One of them suggested that, as they were there, they might as weU have a game or two at skittles, and asked him to play, but he refused. One of them picked up the ball, and said he was sure, from its being so heavy, that it was stone; the other said it was wood, and a bet was made between them upon that. Witness was asked his opinion, and if he would join in the wager, which he would not do, because he knew that the ball was made of wood (lignura vitac). The two then began to play at Ykittles, and he, at their request, consented to score the game. Others came in; they appeared quite strangers, but played, and ultimately a sovereign a side was staked, and a great showand parade made of the money. During the game the prisoner asked the time, observing that he got tipsy the previous night, and had forgotten to wind up his watch. Prosecutor pulled out his watch, and said it was 12 o'clock. He returned it to his pocket, and the game went on. Shortly afterwards the prisoner again asked the time, and prosecutor took out his watch to tell him, but that time he was not lucky enough to get it back to his pocket, for one of the parties snatched it from his hand, and passed it to the prisoner. Three of them immediately went away and disappeared, and when he asked the prisoner for his watch he said he had received it from the otherman in lieu of a bet of 2Z. which he had won of him upon the game, but as it had been obtained from him in sueh a manner he could have it returned for a sovereign. He was about to go after the man who took it, when one of the two who wereleft behind stopped him, and said he should give him in charge for having stolen an umbrella. This very much amazed him, and in the confusion they all got away, and he had not seen or heard anything of the watch since. There was no pretence for charging him with stealing any umbrella. He gave information to the police, and, seeing the prisoner subsequently in Shoreditch, he pointed hint out to a constable and gave him into custody. He pledged his oath that he did not loin in the game, or make any bet at alL or stake his watch against money.
In cross-examination he stBiotly adhered to his evidence in chief.
The defence was that the prisoner fairly won a bet, for which the watch was handed to him, and that he knew nothing of, and had no participation in, any trick by which the prosecutor was depnved of his property.
The jury found the prisoner Guilt t.
The prosecutor said he was sure the parties were all confederates, though they pretonded to be strangers, for he had seen some of them, particularl the man who stopped him in the skittle-groundl and saidr he had stolen an umbrella, about the outside of the Court waiting to know the prisoner's
Mr. CRn&sy said, if he could identify any of them he could give them in charge.
An officer and the prosecutor went out, and soon returned uNmbihrellarn who was desoribed by the prosecutor as"the
MIr. CREAsY said he should make no order, but the prosecutor could, if ho pleased, have the person taken before a magistrate, who would see if the evidence was sufficient to send him for trial.
The prosecutor left the court toprefer the charge,
The prisoner was sentenced to sax months' hard labour.
Timothy Regan, 21, was indicted for unlawfully and malciously stabbing and wounding Renry Lynch.
Mr. Platt prosecuted; Mr. lIorry appeared for the defence.
The prosecutor said he lived at.No. 8, Baldwin's-gardens, Gray's-inn-lane, and on the 22d of March he saw a woman 'with whom the prisoner cohabited rush at his brother, John Lynch, with an open knife, and he ran up to her and endeavoured to wrest the knife from her. The prisoner then interfered, and in a scuffle thrust a fork into his thigh.
It was suggested for the defence that the prosecutor struck the prisoner first, and that the latter acted in self. defence, and, if guilty at all, was guilty only of a common assault.
The jury found him Guil4y of the minor charge, and recommended him to mercy, and thst the prosecuting witneeses should have no expenses allowed them.
Mr. GREASY said he should not act upon the latter part of the recommendation, as the witneeses had been bound over by the magistrate; but, with respect to the other, he should attend to it, and sentence the prisoner only toa fortnight's imprisonment, All the parties were eviTently very ill-disposed persons.
Prisoner.-Thankyou, Sir. Please mayI see mywife?
Mr. CREASY said that was a most impudent-requesb, for - the oerson the prisoner meant by ",his wife" was an abandoned creature who had disgracefully cohabited with him. He certainly should not allow her to see him.
Police.
POLICB.
MANSIONy-IOUsE.-John Sheley and WiDiam Rugg, who had been remanded upon the charge of haviug robbed a gentleman of his watch-guard and several seals in Kingstreet oa Friday last, the day of nomination of candidates at the city election, were again brought before the LO)RD MAYOR.
As the LoRD MAyoR was about to commit the prisoners for trial they admitted their guilt, and begged that they might be summarily dealt with. They were thereupon remanded for the purpose of being dealt with in petty sessions.
GuLDuALTL.-Robert Thomas Bilham, a fashionably attired young man, passing under tho assumed rame of Captain Laune, and describing himself as of Redgrave-halD, Bottesdale Suffolk, was placed at the bar before Sir P. LAURIZ, cbarged with forging and uttering three cheeks for lL lOs. lld., 18,. 10s., and 171. 10s., with intent to defraud Mr. Sherman, of the Queen's Hotel, St. Martin's-le. Grand; Mr. Smith, a tavern-keeper, of 5, Leicester-square; and Mr. Humphreys, a hosier and glover, of 127, Strand.
Mr. Randall appeared on bebalf of Mr. Sherman, who, he said, felt it his duty to complete his ease, and he therefore wished tho case to be again adjourned for that purpose.
Sir P. LAUuRiEsaidhe would proceed with the case as far as he could at present.
The evidence in Mr. Sherman's case, which was taken on the day the prisoner was first brought up, was then read over, and the following evidence in support of fresh charges was then gone into.
Mr. William Smith said,-I am a tavern-keeper, at 5, Leicestr-square. I know the prisoner through seeing him at my house. On Friday, the 20th of March last, he dined at my house, after which he produced a check for 181. 10s., and asked me if I could cash it for him. I told him I could not do it, as I had not sufficient money in the house, but that I would lend him 4L upon it. He placed the check in my hands, and I let him have the 4L until I could get it cashed. I paid the check into tho London and Westminster Bank on the following morning, and during the day the prisoner came and displayed some anxiety to get the balance of the check, but, as I was not quite satisfied that it was al right, I declned to see him. He sent a message to me. The check was returned to me shortly after with a note appended, stating that no person of the name of Charles Laurie had any account at the Diss Bank.
Cross-examined.-The prisoner represented he had an account at the Diss Bank, upon which the check was drawn. Win. Tringham said,-1 am assistant to Mr. Huniphreyv:
hosier, of 127, Strand. The prisoner has been several times to our shop and purchased goods for cash. On Thursda, the 26th of March last, the prisoner came to our shop arn purchased goods to the amount of 17t 10s., -which he directed to be sent to Parry'a Hotel, at 87_1, Queen-street, Cheapside, at 6 o'clock that evening.
Sir P. LATRiE.-That is the house where he was found when he was apprehended.
Witness.-I took the goods there that evening, and found the prisoner standing at the door. I went upstairs with him, and he asked me if I had brought all the goods, and gave me the check produced for 171. 10s., and I left the
oods with him. I also gave him a receipt for tho amount. took the check to my employr, but he refused to receivo it, and directed me to take it back and either get cash for it or the goods returned.
Sir P. LAURm-I wish that was generally done by tradesmen, for it would put a stop to the circulation of false checka,
Witness-When I got back to Queen-street I found the prisoner had been taken into custody upon another charge in my absence.
Sir P. LAuMrn.-Where are the goods ?
Bailey (the officer)-They are still at Parry's Botel.
Witness (cross-examined).-We had dealings with the prisoner previously, but he never p aid us with checks. Be neveri offered us a check before. Be went by the name of
Sir P. LAuRsi.-I wish he bad chosen any other name. (Laughter.) This is the first case in which any one of that name has been brought before me.
Mr. Randall applied tbat the case might be remanded until Monday, as the bankers from Diss, in Norfolk, would then be able to attend.
Adjourned accordingly.
MARLBsoROuGn.Sa..-Catherime Watson was charged with stealing a quantity of valuable linen, the property of the Earl of Shaftesbury.
Inspector Lester, 0 division, stated that the prisonier was employed occasionally at the Earl of Shaftesbury's resideuce, 24, Grosvqnor-square, as charwoman. In consequence of an exeensive tableoloth having been missed immediately after a dinner party at his Lordship's residence, the police were sent for, and, from inquiries,'suspirion having falleh on the prisoner ho went to her lodgings, 22, George-street, for the purpose of makingR a search. BEe found a 9uantity of duplicates relating to shees aleoh,&. n h
were afterwvards identified, . tbelts,&. n hg
Ann Calvert, housekeeper to the Earl of Shafteshury, seid the prisoner was at the house on Tuesday, when 'tho tablecloth was missed from the stillrom. Several ihble-
cloths and other articles had been missed within the past' fortnight.
George Greaves, assistant to a pawnbroker in South Audley-street, named Brookes, ptoduced altablecloth with
the coronet and initials picked out, which had been p awned bytlthaprisocerforl4s~- ;
The housekeeper ideitified the tabledloth as Lord Shaftes.
neprisoner was remanded for a week~.
Magaret MCormick., mother of the prisoner Watson, was then put to the bar charged with stealing a quantity of damask tablenapkins, tio ropertyof Viscount Palmerston.
Inspector Lester stated Eat on searching Watson's room, which was also occupied by the prisoner M Cormick, a num. ber of duplicates was found, among which was one relating to a quantity of damaak napnlds whicb, on inquiry, were found to have been stolen from LordPalmerston's residence' Cambridge-house, Piccadilly, where the prisoner was em. ployed occasionally as charwoman.
Catherine Hayes, kitchenmaid, said about 32 napkinshad been recently missed.
An assistant from a pawnbroker named Dobie produced 18 tablo napkins pawned by the prisoner in the name of Callaghan.
The napkins were identified as the property of Lord Pal. mnerston.
The prisoner was remanded for a week.
Inspector Lester said Lord Shaftesbury was desirous oE knowing if any means existed to make pawnbrokers answer. able for taking in stolen property when detection was easy; if ordinary caution was used. In one instance articles-were taken into pledge with the initials and the coronet of the owner on them, and it was quite obvious that persons in the station of life of the prisoner could nothave occasion for damask table napkins and tablecloths worth 101. His Lordship apred to think that if facilities were not given by pawnbrokers' shops it would be difficult to get rid of such property as had, been stolen.
Mr. BNromsss-You mnst consider yourself what ,-ou wiH do. You know the clause as well as we do. Certainly there does appear to have been a want of caution otherwise the coronet and initials must have shown that the articles did not belong to the persons offering them in pledge.
Inspector Lester.-he pawnbroker says he was put off his guard because only a small sum was asked, and therefore he did not open the goods out.
3Mr. BxNxnaAL-The pawnbroker must lose the money he advanced, and I will think about a fine.
Inspector Lester.-llis Lordship is desirous of knowing if anything can be done.
Mf r. BINGLs-I will contsider the matter between thig tine and the next examination.
Wosmr-sTm gr.-Wjlir and Elizabeth Evans, man and wife, and the latter identified by Alderman, the gaoler, as an experienced shoplifter, were charged before Mr. DYEY1COuJRT with being in possession of property supposed to be stolen.
Both prisoners were committed for the completion of the evidence.
SOUTHwARI.-WiMliam Gibson, a wel1-dressed middle. aged person, -who was described on the charge-sheet as a gentleman of independent property, and who appeared in a very nervous state, was placed in the felon's dock before Mr. BuncEu4, charged with stealing four half-crowns and sence from the person of Angelina Leman.
The complainant, who was dressed in the first style of fashion, and had her head adorned after the manner of the Regent-street and Haymarket "ladies," stated that shortly after 11 o'clock on the previous night she went into a coffeehouse at the corner of the Haymarket and Windmill-street to meet a female friend. While there the prisoner, who was much under the influence of liquor, accosted her, and asked to be llowed to accompany her home. She consented, and they got into a cab, when she had loose in the pocket of her dress a half-sovereign, fonrhalf.crowns, and X
xpence. While riding along she felt his hand about the pocket of her dress, but, knowing him to be under the inunence of liquor, sshe did not take much notice of that. When they arrived at herhouse in Stamford-street; and lghted, she missed the four half-crowns and sixpencefrom her pocket, and she then gave the prisoner into custody When she first met him he said that c 5001. about him, and he wished herto take care of him and that.
The prisoner here said that as far as he could recollect, as he was much intoxicated when he met the woman, he got into a cab with her to go and sleep with her, but when he got to her house he was a little sobered, aud, Sfnd. ing that it was near 3 o'clock, he objected to enter the house with her, and.on that account she gave him into custody for robbing her.
Mr. BuEnACa (to the prosecutrix.)-What are you?
Prosecutrix.-I am inno business. I live on my money.
Mr. BURCHA3r-Now, are you what is called a gay woman?
Witness (hesitating.)-No, I am not, Sir. lam a modest woman, an I hve by myseLf.
Mr. BURc - at, amodest woman, and pick up, gentlemen in the Haymarket ? That's very singular, Where do you live?
Witness.-In Upper Stamford-street.
Mr. BuRoAJ.L-tYou say you live by yourself. What rent do you pay there?
Witness.-I have only ipartments there, Sir.
Sergeant Aylesbury, L division, here informed his Worship that a great many of the houses in Upper Stamford-street were no better than brothels.
Mr. BURCEIAL-Who keeps this house?
Prosecutrix.-Mrs. Moon. I believe her husband is something of a furniture dealer in tho New-cut.
MIr. BURCEHAm.-Now, is it not a brothel, and do not other women bve there 7
Prosecutrix.-It'is not a brothel, and I an the only
Wr.BNc .-This is a very extraordinary case and I should like to hear the evidence of the constable. Tet him stand in the witness-box,
William Tarrant, 103 L, said he took the prisoner into custody at the door of 76, Upper Stamford-street, shortly before 3 o'clock that morning. The woman said he had robbed her of four half-crowns and sxpeno. There was a cab at the -door, %nd the prner sixdpnho river hie fwrased ha droath off before witness had a opportunity of serhin theo
vehicle. She told him that siehad come from the Hay. market with the prisoner, whom he- serched, and found upon him two half-crowns and some coppers.
Mr. BoRCH"s-Do you know this young woman and the house she lives in ?
Witness.-I never saw her before, neither do I know the house as a brotheL There are several in tho immediate vicinity.
Mr. BuncHrA (to the prosecutrix).-Did the prisoner say anything about stopping with yon when you accompa. nied him to your lodgings inthe eab?
Prosecutrix.-Oh no, Sir. I would not have allowed - that. I am a modest woman. I left home at 31 o'clock to meet a woman in the Haymarket.
Mr. BuRcssut.-You know those houses in the Haymarket are frequented by gay women. You went there at 11 o'clock, and stopped until 2, when you picked up tb's gentleman. What did you bring him home for?9
Prosecutrix.-He wanted to accompany me home. That's Mr BuRcHAmr (to the prisoner).-What are you, Sir?
Prisoner.-I have property left me by iny father, and I do business with gentlemen on the turf ?
Mr. BURCssAr,.-Does any one know you about here?
Prisoner.-I am known to severbl gentlemen of high standing in London, but the only ones I know about this locality are Mr. Price, the frnitererin the Borough-market, and Mr. Wardc, of the Surtfe Music-hall.
The constable stated that he had been to those persons, residences, but they had gone to the Epsom Spring Meeting.
Mr. BuRCHAs L-Do you belong to London?
Prisoner.-No, Sir. I come from Richmond in Yorkshire. (He here mentioned the names of several influential families with whom he was acquainted there, which satisfied his worship that there must be some truth in his statement.)
Mr. BuRcHA? to the prosecutrix.-Didyou come straight from the Haymarket with him in the cab ?
Prosecutrix. -No, Sir. He stopped the- cab tbree times at different publichouses, and each time paid the cabman, but I had nothing to drink. I can prove what money I had when I left by another lady who was in my house.
Mr. BURCHAN.-YOU have sworn before me that there was no other lady in your house. How is that ?
Witness, rather confused.-She is my dressmaker, and comes at 9 in the morning and leaves at 9 in the evening.
Lr. BURCHIT .-But you say you left about 11. Witness.-She was stopping, Sir, until I left.
Mr. BuRcHAM.-If you are the person you represent yourself to be, it is very extraordinary that you should leave your lodgings at the late hour of f1 at night and pick up a gentleman in the Haymarket at 2 o'clock in the morning. After that you accompany him in a cab, and stop at severai pablichouses. That is an extraordinary thing for a modest woman. I must order further inquiries to be made in this case, therefore I shall adjourn it until Saturday. In the meantime I shall hiberate the prisoner on his own recog. nizancea until that day, when I expect that he will cause the attendance of some of his friends.
The prisoner was then liberated, assuring his worship that he was too much of a gentleman to rob a woman. He would rather give her money.

Cno CoUllRT..-(Beforev A Baron MA3Tn.)
William Nelson, aged 35, and John Leacb, aged 43, were indicted for the wilful murder of John Cragg, at lAncaster, on the 22d of February last.
Mr. Mlonk And Mr. A. Cross appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Higgin defended the prisonerir.
The learned counsel, in opening the case on the part of the prosecution, said it was one which deserved the most Serious attention of the jury for nianyreasons, as it depended altogether on circumsantial evidence; but the varioun circumstances which would be proved, thongh separately of perhaps little moment, taken altogether led to a concla sion which left little doubt that the prisoners had committed the offence with which they were cbarged. The learned counsel then proceeded to state the facts of the case, which were subsequently proved in evidence. It appeared that about 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, the 22d of February last, as a person named Fishwick was walking round the bottom of a large quarry, close to which he lived, at a place called Gcf.gotha, at a short distance from lancaster, he saw in a hollow part of the quarry near the south-east corner the body of a man lying, which was found to be the body of John Cragg, the deceased. The body was lying on the right side, with the right arm thrown up above the head and sticking up, and there were marks of blood on the spot where he had fallen. He knew the deceased, and immediately gave information to the police of Lancaster, and 3fr. Wright, the superin. tendent, visited tho spot. At the top of the quarry Was a wall 6 feethigh, to protect the edge of it from an adjacent field, and exactly at the place where the body was found at thebotton ofthequarrya gap was found mado in the top of this wall, which was buiiiXof loose rnbble stones. The gap appeared larger than one peraon would bave made in clambering over it, and there were marks on the stones as of a person climbing up it, on both sides of tho wall, as if those who bad got over it had climbed back again. There was a space of about three feet between the wall and the edge of the quarry, on which grew tome whin bushes. On examining the body the head was found to be fractured, and the heart and liver both ruptured. No other. bones were broken. No doubt, any one of these injuries would have occasioned death, and one or more of them might have been occasoned .by7 a fall into the quarry, which was 65. feet in depth. The question for the jury was was, thia fall the result of accident, or was it a nomicide? As against the first supposition the deceased lived in tbe immediate neighbourhood and was perfectly familiar with the quarry, and would not therefore be likely to have fUllen over. It was, however, right to say he was in a state of intoxication when last seen. In support of the second supposition the surgeons were of opinion that sach a fall was notbvery hkely to have caused a rupture of the heart, altho'Uth it might have caused the other injuries Rupture of the heart wan more likely to have been caused in a violeut struggle. The surgeons called, however, thought such a fall might well occasion any of the injuries found on the deceased. It was also a fact that the deceased had not been robbed nor his pockets disturbed. To connect the prisoners with the charge of having murdered the deceased, on inquiries being set on foot it was found that both the prisoners had expressed ill-will against the deceased. In 1852 the prisoner Nelson was tried for a burglary and convicted, and his sentencehad since been remitted, and he had been allowed to vo at large under a ticket-of-leave. The decesed man, Sohn Cra% had been active and instrumental in ca usg his apprehension and conviction of that offence, and Nelson had been heard to vow vengeance against him, and had been heard the very night before the deceased was found to allude in angry terms to the deceased. The deceased appeared also to have been much disliked by the prisoner Leach, who was a friend of Nelson. It was, however, only--ight to stato that the prisoner appeared to be an unpopular nan, and to be disliked by other persons also. The deceased appeared to have been drinling at an inn in Tancaster called the Beehive on Saturdaynight, the 21st of February and left there, about a quarter to 12 at night, intoxicatea and reeling, and-went on the road towards his own house, which also led towards the quarry. That road had been repasred with red sandstone, which had coloured the mud in a partcular manner, different frotn the soil of the neighbourhood; and the man's clothes were found covered with this mudc, as i he had been down in theroad; and on the road, about 600 yards from the canal bridge and 80 yards from the quarry, the deceased's cap was found. There were also marks on the road there, as if a body had been dragged across the footpath towards the quary. On that night at a little past midnight cries were heard by two womnen, who were m a window of a house near, as of men quarrelling; there was then a cry of " Oh I" followed by groans, and one of the women xecognized one of the voices to be that of the prisoner Nelson, whom she knew. On that night the two prisoners had been drinling at a publiclouse in Penny-street, Lancaster, which the deceased would pass through on his way home, about the same time as the deceaded left. Nelson then went into a shop to purchase a red herring a httle before 12 o'clock, and the shopkeeper, a person named Saudham, heard Nelson call out, - Jim, rm going to give yon b- - the best walloping he ever had il his life." The other prisoner (Leach) answered, " Thou won't," and then Nelson said, "If thou stick true to me I Will stick true to thee, and Iwillldlltheb-." The shopkeeper did not know to whom this conversation referred, and it would be for the jury to form an opinion respecting it. A girl of the town named Milner was about 12 -'lock .-that -night - ap. - a"ga- in Penny. street -with a man, and saw the two prisoners following three men, and they spoke in ngry terms of "fobowinz him." The men were walking lnthe direction which led to the deceased's house, and would lend to the quarry. Soon after this a warden of Lancaster Catle, who happened to be in Penny-street, and who knew both the prisoners and the deceased man Cragg, saw the prisoners quarreling with Cragg. After a timne the quarrel became less violent, and they walked on together over the canal bridge. That was the last place at which the deceased was seen alive, and the persons last seen with him were unquestionably the prisoners at the bar. It was shortly after this time, and 600 yards from this place, that the two women had heard the sounds of quarrelling and the cry of "Ohl" and
oans, where the dceased's cap was found on the road. Next morng, at half-past 8, the prisoners were found together in a ba in the neighbourhood, where they had pasEed the night. each then said that his head ached, that he had been drinking, and had had a quarrel the night before with Jack Cragg, and Nelson said he had prevented the two men fightrn, and made a long statement denying that he had gone further than the canal bridge. Whenrtakenintocustodyon this charge he said " God forbid Ishould have done anything of the Idnd." No blood or other traces of violence were foundontheprisoners' clothes. This was the case for the prosecution.
Mr. HIGGINS, on behalf of the prisoners, submitted that the evidence was not sufficient to warraut a conviction of the pisoners. The motive suggested for the crime was who ly insufficient as regarded Nelson, and as regarded Leach no motive was suggested at all, for it had been clearly shown that the deceased had not becn robbed.
The learned JUDGE, in summing up, said the fmrst question for the consideration of the jury would be had the deceased been murdered at alL It was not at all iminrobable that the deceased had sought concealment behind the quarry wall from persons who had offered violence to him, and had accidentally himself fallen in to the quarry. If such should be the view of the jury it would be their duty to acquit the prisoners of the murder. The difficulties s-rrounding the case rendered it improbable that the deceased had been murdered. No marks of violence beyond wbat might be occasioned by an iccidental fal into the quarry were found upon the deceased, and none whatever upon the prisoners w en they were apprehended. If they had murdered Cragg at the place supposed they must have dragged the body a great distance. Taldig all the circumstances into their consideration, it was for the jury to say whether the deceased had been murdered or not, and, if he had been, then were the prisoners, or either of them, concerned in that murder.
The jury retired, and, after an absence of about an hour, returned into court shortly before 6 o'clock with a verdict of Not Guilty as to both the prisoners.

wRrGnr v. BA .
Mr. Unthank appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Athertor, QC., and Mr. Baylis for the defendant.
The plaintiff, it appeared, is a well-sinker, and was employed to sink a pit to a mine, on the land of defendant, who is a gentleman of property, residing at Winstanleyhall, near Wigan, and proprietor of extensive estates at Winstanley, and other adjoining townships, in which are extensive coal-fields.

0Te plaintiff was examined at great length and proved that he commenced sinking on the 11thof April, and he cam unexpectedly to a spring at 3 feet depth, which Yielded 27hbuckets per hour, and that the flow of water continued to the firt fortnight, before water-laders were put on by the defendant, and that after that time also there was an overplus chargeable to the defendant, and that from the 7th of June until the 18th of August, when an engine was erected, the works were stopped in consequence

This was a er distressing caem. From tho evidence of the prosectors wno rwas the husband of the prisoner, and his cross-examnation it appeared that they had been married 14 years, and had hhd one child, now n years old. The prosecutor pursues the trade of a fisherman, and bin average tAke for the mackerel seaon was about 401. Of this he always spnt a great portion in determined sotting at the publiohouse-a practice which led to the usual results-beastly intoxication, quarrels, and brutal violence. As long ago as 12 years back the prose. entor beat his wife in one of hls fits to cruelly that to avoid him the locked herself up in a room, and on his attenipting to force open the door with a pickaxe 'he leapt ont of the window and fled to a neighbour. On a subsequent occasion he came home so drunk that he set to work to beat his wife and smash all his furniture-a freak which oost him 401. After this he deserted her, and was committed to Norwich Gaol for oue month for that offence. From these examples it may be credited that a patient wife lie a worm, wml at last turn upon her persecutor. Stiii she endeavoured to weau him from his vicious habit4, but without effect Night after night he came home drunk after his last vovage, insisting on visiting the pothouse, though hi
wife b;gged him -to desidst. 'At glast,honptoh'e07't'hoftFoe-bruarhyl, he quittaedhis house at 8 oclock in the morning, when she cautioned him not to wooto the pblichouse or she would
do for him, while he told her he would knock her down if she spent any money In paying the miller. In the course of the day the prosecutor found his way to the public. house, and aJter le had been there some timec his wife came after him, and, accusing him of sotting there all day, expresse her intention to " sit foot to foot with hinm" After a while the prosecutor began to toes for beer, on which she interfered. -This brought on a blow from ithe brute inher ye, eand assoonas that i t was offered to her, she (prisoner) sprang at him and drew a knife across his face two or three times, inficting several wounds and dividing the temporal artery, from which the blood gushadout in afeafu flood. The wound, however, was immediately 'attended to by those present, and by none more assiduomuly than by the prisoner herself on her retirn from the yard, into which she'had retired after tho -affy for the apparent purpose of burying the knife which she had brought from home with her, as she said to defend herself from her husband,
After the cross-examination of the prosecutor,
The leaned CoVszn for the risoner expressed his readiness to submit to a verict lto(r the misdemeanour, deeming thatif ever the ntx of the knfe could be palliated it could be by the gross Mltreatment of his client by her own husbendl.
fr. Justice ERLs agreed that, at all events, the conduct of the prisoner could not be reduced below the offence of unlawfully wounding the prosecutor, and zecommended the jury to acquit her of the felony and to convict her of the misdemeanour, which they did at once, recommending the prisoner to mercy.
Hi4LoRDSilp then, addressingthe prosecutor, stigmatized his conduct as most brutal and such as he should gladly ae rendered liable by the lAw to very severe puish. mient indeed. As far'as he was concered he should take care that his expenses should be withheld. As regarded the unfortunate woman at the bar, his earnest desize was so to punish her for this offence as to secure her the more effectually from the future violenoe ofthe bute to whom bhe hsd allied herself by the tie of 'ar all the obligations of which ho loa totallydsegared W T ith this view he should'senitnce her to four daimprisonment, so that her husband might reach home before her, and he trusted that hewould allow her to lead an unmolested life.

CRO"S COURT.-(Before the Lord Chief Justice COCK-
BURN.)
Josiah Parker was indicted for the wilful murder of his -wife, Ann Parker, at Wells, on the 16th of February.
Mr. Xingdon was counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. 3?rideaux for the prisoner.
The prisoner was a butcher at Wels. He had been married to his wife about 17 years, aid she was 40 years of age. They had four children. About 5 o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th of February the prisoner and his wife were about to have tea; they intended to have some veal-cutlets, and the wife went to the shop door and asked her husband if he had cut the veal cutlets. The prisoner said, "I
give thee veal outlets," and he took up ths chopper and struck her on the head with it. He then struck her another 'blow with the chopper, which knocked her down. He then stamped on her chest, and kept chopping at her head until the neighbours came in and prevented his doing further -ischief. The poor woman lingered till the 16th of Febru. ary, when she died.
The defence was that the prisoner was not in a sane state of mind at the time he committed the act. For some time previously the prisoner had been under a delusion that his vife was unfaithful to him. He would wander about the house muttering to himself. He would getup in the night and make a fire, and the verv night before this happened the servant girl sat up ll night, and the wife sent for a policeman to stay in the house during the nighbt, as she was afraid of him, and she had expressed a desire that lie night De sent to a lunatic asylum, and on the day this act was committed the wife had gone to Mr. Nicholls, an eminent surgeon of Wells, to consult him on the state of her husband's mind. Mr. Nicholls accordingly saw him only an hour before the occurrence, and he was of opinion that at that time he was sane, but on seeing him the ne.t day he found him perfectly mad. The prisoner was addicted to drinking. Mr. Nfichols detailed conversations he had had with the prisoner relative to the delusion with regard to his wife, for which there was not the slightest ground. When he saw the prisoner on the day of the fatal act the prisoner asked him to give him a composing draught to quiet his nerves, and he said he wouldgo home and go to lbed, and he would get up the next mormn a new man and would live a new life. Mr. Nicholls begge= him to be kind to his wife, as he was sure there was no ground for his sus-
cions, and the prisoner said he would not hurt a hair of ler head. He was a teetotaDler at one time, and during that period ho had evinced symptoms of insanity. Having dressed the poor woman's wounds, Mr. Nicolls had an interview with the prisoner, who expressed the greatest horror of 'the crime he hadcommitted, and said he ought to have killed all his children, that he might have been hung that moment. 'he prisoner's general disposition was most kind, and he 'was particularly fond of his wife. The prisoner upon one occasion had cut his throat very severely, and had infuicted wounds on his arms and legs with a view of bleeding to death, and he had been sent to a lunatic asylum. The priaoner's father had been insane; an aunt had hung herself when insane, and a cousin had died in St. Luke's.
The Cmxv JUSTroE said, after the evidence of Mr. :Nicholls, he thought the case ought not to proceed further.
The jury returned a verdict of 2Vot Guilty, on the ground of insanity.
Trhe prisoner wtas ordered to be detained during Her 'Majesty's pleastLro.

THE BIRKENEAD MWRDER.
(Beforc Mfr. Baron WATqON.A
I noma Zi5mlth, 21, labourer, was charged with murdering Wlliam Vaughan, polioe officer, at Birkenhead, on the 2.3d of December, 1856. Mr. Macintyre, assisted by Ar. Jackson, prosecuted; MEr. Moran Lloyd defended.
Mr. lAACIXTnY, in opening the case, briefly stated the circumstances of the case. The turning point inL the case was a question of law, whether the inflicting the wound which caused death amountea to murder. He had simply to teU them with respeet to this that if a prisoner assaults an officer of iustice in the discharge of his duty, and kills him, even if upon sudden provocation, the prisoner is guilty of murder. The question would turn upon the fact was the deceased a police officer, and was he in the discharge of his duty. It would be proved that the deceased was a police officer, and had acted as sucn many years, and was known to the prisoner as such. That he was acting in the discharge oE his duty would also be provod because the police of Birkenhead vere authorized to apprenend persons under such circumstances
s the prisoner was acting. If, then, it was proved that the deceased was a police-officer, that he was acting in discharge of his duty, and that it was the prisoner who struck the blowv which caused the constable's death, it would bo their duty to find the prisoner guilty of murder.
Mrs. Softly, wife of Mr. Softly, publican, Birkenihead, saw the prisoner about 130 on tho morning in question. He was knocking violently at tho door. He wanted to get in to obtain drink. Witness told him she would not draw any. The prisoner then kicked a panel of the door _n. WitneEs pushed him away, and then sent for a constable. When the deceased came to ask witness whether she was g'iag to charge the prisoner she said, " No, I won't if he w pay for the damage he has done." The prisoner said he had no money to pay forit. Witness then told him -to fio away. The prisoner then went away and the deceased followed himn.
Patrick Fox, groom.-Was at Mrs. Softly's house on the morning in question. I wont for the deceased, and took
imn to Mrs. Softly's house, where the prisoner was then standing. The deceased then asked prisoner to go away. 'The prisoner said that he and his companion wanted a glass of beer. Deceased said, " Yoa had better go home, young man, you have had enough drink." Theman in company nwith the prisoner was named Breen. They went away reluctantlK, but quietly.
Josep Lawton, car driver, was at Mrs. Softlv's publicLouse on the 23d of December. Heard the policeman say to the prisoner, " Go home quietly." They went away, but Smith hurried back again. Vaughan then laid hold of him and said, " Go homo, my good man." That occurred about 25 yards from Mrs. Softly's house. The prisoner and policeman then went away. A short time after a man named Croft came up to the house, shouting "Joe," meaning witness. Witness went with him to the corner of Bridgestreet and Hamnilton-street, and saw Vaughan staggr. He putbis arm round him and said, "Joe, I'm stabbed-rm _one.' They put him (Vaughan) into a shandry and took him to the pohce-office. He died in about 20 minutes afterwards.
WiUiam Reed on the morning of the day in ques'tion saw the deceased in the street. They spoke -to one auother. Shortly after heard some shouting. Walked on quickly, and saw the prisoner, Breen, and Vaughan. The deceased was saying to the prisoneraud his companion "Go home, like good lads." The prisoner and his companion went on a few yards and then returned to the publichouse. They were again admonished to leave, and then went away down the street. The deceased returned 'o Nr. Softly's. Shortly after one of the two men returned, and the deceased foUowed him. A shout was soon after'wards raised, and witness ran to the spot whence is proceeded. He then saw the deceased staggering. Ife cried out, " I'm dying, Joe, I'm dying, I'm dying." Witness assisted to put binn in the shaudry and afterwards to undress
iim. The prisoner had had drink, but was not tipsy.
James Croft.-I reside at Bidstone, near irkeunbead ; recoleet being in Bridge-street on the mornin in question, in a shaudry. Saw two men kicking at Mr. Softly's docr; saw the d&eceased, and heard him advise the prisoner and his companion togo home; afterwards heard a shout. Went to Mr. Sof tly's and cailed Joe, then went to the place from whence the voice pr,ceeded and saw the deceased stagger-
ig, helped him into my shandry, took him to the policestation, and saw him die.
Josepht Whitehead -I am a constable residing at Birkenbead. Remember seeing the prisoner and Breen on the day in question, Met the deceased, and with him went to the prisoner, and his companion and told him to go home. The prisoner when asked his -name said, -I know, and that's enough." Spoke to the priEoner and his companion bocause the deceased said they had been knoking at Mr. Softly's door. When they refused to give theifrnanes I seized 33reen, and the deceased seized the prisoner by the collar of his jacket with his right;band. The edeceased hed a stick in his hand, but did not use it while I was present. I heard the prisoner say he wonld n"tgo with the deceased; 'When the deceased laid hold of him I saw the prisoner strike him. several times on the left breast, and deceamedshoukd out, " L'm stabbed ;" let go theprisoner, and fell. risen 'let go Breen, and called out to a constable nazeed Ct;Aie, wbtm I saw comihg, to saop the prisoner.

His shirt is saturated with blood. When the prisoner and his companion said they would not give their names, I said, -Then, lefs take them to bridewelL" I let Breen go as swon as I heard the deceased say he was stabbed. Chester-street was not in the deceased's beat that night. Ihad not been at a meeting before I went on my beat) The deceased was membor of an Orange society.
CharleaClarke,policecoristable,Birkenhead.-Iwasonduty on the night in question in Hamilton-street, near Bridgestreet. I heard a voioe early in the morning calling out "Stop him, stop him; he has stabbed Vaughan." I then met the prisoner rannng towards me. When within a few yards, he said with an oath, holding up his hand, "Look out you-." Istruck him on the top of his head, knocked him down, and threw myself on him. Ithen took him to the station. On the way he struggled 'violently twice, and I threw him on his back twice.
Mr. Jeanette, surgeon of the police force, Birkenhead, was sent for to see the deceased onthe morning in question. He was dying when I saw bim. I help,d to undress him, and found a wound 2A inches in length below the left nipple, just below the sixth rib. It had passed over the sixth rib and entered the chest. After his death I made an examifation of his body. The wound was l1 inches in depth, penetrating into the a;ex of the heart. The knife producea might ave caus he wounds which zesuledin
eath. I also examined the prisoner. I found a cut above the second knuckle of his thumb on the right hand, and bruises on his back.
The prisoner's statement before the magistrates was then put in and read. He stated the facte brought out in evidence, but added that when the deceased came up to 'him the second time he struck him several times on his back and shoulder, and twisted his hand in his neckcloth; he then had no other way to defend himself but in the manner in which he did, but he had no intention of hilling the mam
Mr. MROGAN LLOYD then addressed the jury for the defence. He said the principal question was whether the count in the indictment on which the prisoner wasnow arraigned had been made out, that the prisoner had cf his malice aforethought killed the deceasedL If a constable under a warrant was taking a man into custody and was struck in isuch a manner by a man as to cause his death, then the crime would amount to that of murder. Then they would have to consider whether the prisoner had any object in waylaying the deoeased; and from the evidence he contended it had beenproved that he had none. in the next place, they must decide whether the deceased was at the tsme he received his death wound in the execution of his duty. This he also believed had not been made out, inasmuch as the deceased was not on his beat at the time he seized the prisoner. Mr. Lloyd then went through the evidence, commenting on it as he groceeded, and, urged tho strong probability of the trut of the prisoner's own statement-that when he was seized by the deceased he was struck by him sevoral times on the back and, exoited with a little drink which he had had, used his knife in self-defence. The prisoner was a sober, honest, and industrious man, and was the only support of a widowed mother and five brothers and sisters; and no manx could have grieved over the result of the affair more than the prisoner had himself.
The prisoner was crying convulsively during the speech for the defence.
His LORDSHwP, after hearing some witnesses to character, summed up. He said, the jury must inquire in the first place whether the deceased, William Vaughan, fell by the 3td of the prisoner at the bar; whether he was the person who stabbed him and caused his death. Upon that point, from the evidence of several witnesses, and among others the evidence of Whitehead, who was close at hand at the time, there was no doubt that the blow or blows by which the deceased met with his death were inficted by the prisoner, at the bar. If there had been aay further doubt upon the subject, it had been entirely removed by the reading, at the request of the prisoner's counsel, of the statement made by him before the magistrates, in which he stated that he did strike tho blows; that they were only in self-defence, and that he had no intention of committing murder; therefore they could -not entertain the slightest doubt but that the death of Vaughan was caused by the prisoner at the bar. The next question was whether the prisoner was guilty of murder or manslaughter in so stabbing the deceased officer, Vaughan If the prisoner had of malice aforethought inflicted the wounds which caused the deceased's death, then it would amount to murder. If a man met another in the street, and without provocation stabbed or shot him, then it would amount to murder. If a man armed with a lawful authority was aresting another man, and while so doing that man made use of a murderous weapon that would amount to murder. Az regarded the offence of murder he was bound to say that in this case, as in others, when a man inDficted a deadly wound upon another, and there was primd fa.cie evidence of the fact, it would amount to murder; but in looking at the circumstances, if they found the crime only amounted to manslaughter, it might be cut down to the minor offence; in the first instance unexplained the crime was murder. He would tell them the law on the subject, and then they might decide as they chose. The crime of manslaughter was the killing a man not with malice aforethought. If they were convinced that Vaughan died by the hand of the prisoner at the bar, the next queation for them to decide was whether the crime was that of murder or manslaughter. If they thought the deceased was armed with a lawful authority when he was arresting the prisoner at the bar, then the crime would be that of murder, with which he was charged in the indictment; but if not, they might find him guilty of tho minor offence-manslaughter. The authority with which he was armed was obtained from an Act called the Birkenhead Improvement Act, the 3d of William IV., cap. 98, sec. 78, and read as follows: -" That the said constable, asslstant-constables, watchmen, night patrols, and beadles shall in their several courses of service use their utmost endeavours, not only to prevent fires, but also to keep watch and ward within the said township, and to prevent murders," tc. ; "a nd theyare hereby empowered and required to arrest and apprehend all malefactor% vagrants, beggars, disturbers of the peace, and all disorderly and suspected persons, prostitutes, and nightwalkers,who shall be found misbehaving or wanderig within the said township," &c. The deceased had relied upon the words "disorderly," or " disturbers of the peace." At the time the deceased made the arrest was the prisoner gulity of disturbing the peace ? If it was not so, then the deceased had no lawful authority, and then the crime was reduced to manslaughter, and not murder. All the breach of the peacehad ceased when the deceased came up to Mr Softly's house, and therefore there had been no breach in his view, and, On addition to this, Mrs. Softly, who had witnessed the breach, refused to give the prisoner into custody for the offence. His Lordship then rcad over the whole of the evidence and eommented upon it as he proceeded.
After deliberting about a quarter of an hour the jury found the prisoner Guilty of manslaughter.
His lonDsis' said he would sentence him the following morning.
The verdict was received with some slight cheers in court, which were quickly subdued. The prisoner, who had been weeping throughout the time of his trial, appeared greatly relievead bv the verdigt

SPORTING INTBLLIGENOE.
.EPSON SPBRThG MERTTKa-_Tmm'mx. -
Loadon plesure folk are net easil discouraged. Whe
bent upon enjoyment they will purgue xport underanydi i- eulty, and seldom let foul weather interfere with their in clinatioa or mar their plaas. No wonder, then, that,despite the wind and rain which prevailed during the morning, the road to Epsom should be well throngedwith all descriptions of vehicles, and that train after train should be despatched from tho London-bridge station. Indeed, the "licensed victyallers of the metropolis and their friends" seemed deternined to pay extraordinary observance to the f6te-d&y which they themselves had called into existence, and to prove that they took unabated interest ia the two great racos which were mainly esablished by their liberality.
Those who trusted hopefully to a change in the sde;y influences were net disappointed, for before the time ap. pointed for the coume ncement of the proceedings theheavy loweoring clouds rolled away, and A intervals the sun peered forth most cheerily. A better attendanco of ge. neral company we do not remember at any preeeding anniversary of the aceting. Not only was the Grand Stand enolosure thronged-a circumstance mainly owing to the liberal distribution of tickets by the Clerk of the Course-but the "onter seVt of sporting men was nume. rously represented, while speotators ined in double rows each side of the straight ran in from the rubbing-house to the half-distance.
The business arrangements wero the same as usual. The Newmarket staff of officials-Messrs. Clark, Manning, and Hibbard-were engaged, and Mfartin Starling, "the man in the red coat," did good servioe in clearing the course. A detachment of the A div'sion of police, under the direction of Superintendent Walker and Inspectors 'Beckerson and Bray, wvas on duty, but the orderly behaviour of the spectators afforded the force no opportunity for active service. Indeed, the principal employment of the police consisted in chasing stray hats, which the boisterous wind raised into the air, aud then sent bowling across the Downs.
The City and Suburban Handicap and the Metropolitan Stakes were the be all and end all of the meetng. Althongh until within the last four days specuLation on them had been verylimited, yet the unexpected introduction into the maket at the eleventh hour of4 two little thought-of favourites created co nsiderable interest and curiosity. On Taesday Wardermarske was brought with a rush into the betting on the City and Suburban Handicap, and on Wednesday Dulcamara was quickly advanced from the extreme outside division to a prominent position among the leading favouritos for the Metropolitan. As our return wil show, both horses were defeated. The Epsomites had a great day, for the two principal events of the meeting were carried off by animals trained on the Downs. Adamas, the winner of the City and Sabu rban, was, it will be remembered, a favourite for the Northam ptonshire Stakes, for which event he was easily beaten, his owner attributing his defeat to the "use" which was made of the horse in the early part of the race. It will be seen that to-day different tactics were adopted in riding him, and that his jockey .mad what Is technically called a waiting race. Aamas became the property of his prosent owner at the Doncaster Spring Meeting last year, when he was purchased, after winning a "selling race," for 145 guineas. He has wonderfullyimproved since he has been in Mr. Melish'spossession; and his performance both for the City and Suburban and the Metropolitan Stakes has brought him into much notice for the Derby, especially, too, as it is believed that he was not exactly " fit." Tho sapporters of Wardermarke deemed the race a "certainty" for their horse, whose defeat they attributed to a disappointment he met with on ooming round Tattenham Corner. Poodle, the winner of the Metropolitan, is trained by Resves, of Epsom; he was purcbased of Lord Clifden lastyear by his present owner, Mr. Hale. The horse was scarcely mentioned in the ring, and his success compensated the bookmakers for the ill luck which attended them on every other event. Adamas, it will be seen, was within an ace of repeating the Virago achievement of 1854 Fisher. man tired with his heavy weight, andDulcamara sadly disappointed his stable.
The proceedings were brought to a conclusion about 6 o'clock.

On rounding Tattenham Corner Wardermarske and Dusty Miller showed near the leading borses, but Wardermarske, strildnginto the heels of "something,"vwas there thrown o,dt. At the distance Adamas and St. Giles began to draw forward, and as theyapproached the stand LittleTomdropped away, and Babble went off with the lead, Adamas, Wardermarske, and St. Giles being in close attendance. Opposite the Grand Stand Fordham called upon Adamas, who won, after an interesting race in, by a neck - the same distance between the second and third. St. Gilfes was beaten two lengths from Babble - Little Tom was fifth, closo up with St. Giles. Several iengtbs behind them came Admiral Lyons, Vaulter, Miss Harkaway, Fright, and Dusty Miller, close together. Hollander was last, beaten off.

No materil chang took place until tnmning into the Old Course, when l= me Richel gave way, Cocatoo going on with the loed, Comparnion being econd, the others ying up so compactly that it was impossible to determine their relative positions..

THE ZSHHMUS OF PA A A.
TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I take the liberty, most respectfully, of informing you that Hr. Kelley, ot New York, who has been most
'avounrably received by the Emperor3of the French, has been promised Eis Majest's co-operation with England and Ainenica in making a thorough sarvey of the whole Zithmus of Panama or Darien, with a view of cutting a ship canal be. tween the two oceans; and that the saum of 25,000 dollars has been voted by the Congress of the United States for the exploration of the Isthmus and the verification of the surveys alrrdy made. The only routes by which a cnal com. munication across the Isthmus of Panamna can be effected are bythn Atrato and Tuando rivers, and thenoe to Paraeuchichi Inlet on the Pacific; and, by the Darien route, from Caledonia Bay to the Gulf of San MigueL
The former route was surveyed by Captain Kennish, Dr. Jameson, and Captain Rude, in 1855, at Mr. Kelley's expense. The Darien route was first explored by myself in 1849, and a preliminary survey of it was made by me in subsequent journeys in 1850, '51, and '52. It was again parhally surveyed by the Darien expedition of 1854.
You maynot be aware that whentheEmperorof the French received a deputation from the Atlantic and Pacific Junction Company-which I accompanied-in March, 1855, His Majesty offered to join England and Amnerica in guaranteeing S per cent, interest on the capital, and 1 per cent, for a sinking fund, and also in paying all the capital which might be required for the canal over zadabove 6,000,0001. sterlig.
I hlave the hononr to be, Sir,

The Houseless Poor Of London.-On Wed-
THE HousLmESS PoolC oF 0 om X.-On Wednesday evening the Lord Mayor continued his tour of inspection of the asylums for the houseless poor. His Lordship was accompanied on this occasion by Mr. Justice Haliburton, Dr. Forbes Royle, Capin Lynch, and Mr. Joshua W. Bntterwortb, a guardian o the West London Union. The first visit was to the Night Refuge for the Homeless, in connexion with the Field-lane Ragged School, Victoriastreet, Holborn-hill. The receptacles for the two sexes were found to be at distinct buildings, a short distance from each other, and for an expenditure of about 400. per annum it appears that nightly shelter, with a small loaf of bread night and morning, are afforded on an average to from 70 to 100 destitute human beings. Attendance at the ragged school in connexion with the establishment entitled appEcants to admission to the refuge. Stil this ill was -always relaxed in favour of pressing cases. The party next visited the Refuge in Playhouse.-yard, Whitecross-street, so graphically described in Houseiwld Words. The wards were almost fulL and the spectacle of 571 destitute human beings, aU classified, as far as possible, in dstinct divisions, was an impressive one, the effect of which was, if possible, heightened by the communicated fact that in a few weeks this asylum, intended only to meet the extreme winter weather, would be closed for the season. The question naturally presented itself to the miads of the party, how is it that the solemn duty of caring for the houseless poor, confided by law to guardians, leaves, after all, so much to be done by private benevolence ? The experience derived by the Lord Mayor in his previous visits to the casnal wards of the three city unions provides a ready answer, for, while these latter, to avoid the burden of the houseless poor, designedly place their casual wards two or three miles away from the city-the result being that they are scarcely used-it has been found that the establishments supported by private benevolence, being central, are available to the wretched applicants, and in consequence ae almost exclusively resorted to by them. As a practical result, the Lord Mayor, on being solicited by a gentleman representing the West London Union, at once consented to use his official influence ineverypossible way in orderto bring about central casual wards in London, to be supported by a contributory rate from the several metropolitan unions, orat least by those unions within the limits oE the city of London.
Fmy,s.-Shortly before ,9 o'cloclk last night a fire broke out on the premises belonging to Messrs. W. H. Alen and Co., foreign bookseUers and wholesale atationers, Leadenball-street. The building stretched from the street nearly 70 feet, and had a hack entrance in Leadenhall. market. The firemen, under the direction of Mr. Braidwood, the superintendent, Mr. Fogo, the foreman, and Mr. Bridges, the engineer, went to work in an admirable manner, but they were unable to get the mastery over the flames until 11 o'clock, and not untUi nearly everything in the shops was burnt. The damage done to the building is also very seriotis. Another fire broke out on the premises belonging to Ar. Sawyer, carpeniter and builder, situate in One Bell-yvr8, opposite St. Maryle-Strand parish church. The flaraes wero subdued, but not until Mfr. Sawyer's stock was nearly destroyed, and somo damage done to the printing offl on the next floor. Anotber fire also happenedl in Cleveland-street, Marylebono, atwhbich the engines ittenided, bult the &lmes were subdued before muoh damage was done.

TO THE. EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Permit me to comment on some observations in fr. Bade iffo's letter, published in your columns this morning, which ar,o calculated to produce erroneous itnpressions, m proportion as they are based on an inaccurata estimato of the anatomical characters and practical bearing of the epidemics prevailing among cattle in this country and on the European continent.
The lung disease (pucro-pneunmona) has for many years committed great ravages among cattle in various countries, -nowhere more than m our own. It is now prevalent, but to less extent than two or three years back. But, besides, a totally different disease is ravaging the hords in some parts of Europe, more articularly m Moravia,-that is contagious tphus. The further observations I have to make are manly founded on the researches of Professor Spinola, in Poland, Professor Bngdaleck, in Bohemia, and or ML Renaultt Yoart, and Imlin, who composed the commission ordered Dy tho French Emperor to inquire into the nature of the disease under consideration.
Pleuro-pneumonia is an affoction of questionablo contagiousness, capablo of Epontaneus origin, and chiefly, if not exclusively, characterized anatomicallv by deposition of solidifying matter in the substance of the lungs; contagious typhus, on the contrary, is unquestionably contagious in an eminent degree rarely if ever originating spOntaneoutly, and anatomically characterized by various pathological states, the chief of which is ulceration of the intestinal glands. The lungs are mostly unaffected.
It is this contgious typhus which we now have to fear. I have represented this fact and all the infortmation concern ing it in a published letter toffteSecretaryo
EImDparte; an Ivry firmly believe that if the measures Ib have suggested be adopted the public health and
te interests of agriculture may be spared the iJnnending calmity. I hiavo the honour to he, Sir,
Your obedient humble servant.

BnETTS's PATENT BRAN~DY has, ever since its
