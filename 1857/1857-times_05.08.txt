PARIAAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. F1OUSE OF LORDS, TuRSDAY, MAY 7. Their lordships assembled at 2 o'clock to hear Her jesty's gracious Speech, setting forth her reasons for convoking the new Parliament. The sittings of both Houses during the past week having been exclusively devoted to the forms incident to their own re-organization, tho proceed. ings of to-day constituted the real commencement of legisla. tive business. Yet the only visible symptoms in the neighbourhood of Palace-yard that an event of sach high importance was about to transpire was the presence of a rather largercrowd of spectators than is usaally witnessed there on any great night of debate. Within the House, indeed, considerable interest waq manifested in the oeremony; 'hough, of course, nothing like the sensation invariably produced when the Sovereign lends a crowning grace to the scene by her augast piesence was excited on this occasion. Groups of distinguished ladies, in court momning, occupied the upper benches ordinarily assigned to Peers, and imparted a pleasing diversity to the spectacle, the two front tiers of seats on the Ministerial and Opposition sides being reserved for their lordships. There was also a good sprinkling of fair spectators in the Peeresses' galleries, whilo the large gallery above the bar, and, in short, the entireremainig accommodation for strangers, was tarned to the fullest account by eager occupants. The episcopal bench was represented by the Bishops of St. Asaph, Lincoln, and Glocester; Her Majesty's Ministers by Lord Panmure and the Earl of Harrowby; and the Opposition by the Earl of Lucan, Lord Ravensworth, Lord Berners and other Peers; the aggregate muster being botween 40 and 50. A general buzz of conversation prevailed in the House until the Lords Commissioners, in their robes of State, made their appearance, attended by the Usher of the Black Rod, and immediately took their seats in front of the Throne. The Commissioners were the Lord Chancellor, Earl Granville, the Duke of Agyll, Lord Stanley of Alderley, and Earl Spencer. Sir AuGusrus Cars-poRD having been directed by tho Lord Chancellor to procoed to the other House and request the immediate attendance of its members, the new Speaker, accompanied by a large cluster of representative3 of the people, appeared, afterabrief delay, in answer to this summons. So numerous, indeed, was Mr. Speaker's escortchiefly composed of new members, to whom the cere. nmonial evidently had all the attraction of novelty-that the space in front of the bar was inadequate for their recep. tion, and the overflow had to seek places as best they might where an inch of standing room was obtainable. After the exchange of three grave bows between the Commissioners and Mr. Speaker, The LORD CHANCLLLOR, amid the silence of general expectancy, proceeded to read Her Majesty's gracious Speech, which was as follows - " My Lords and Gentlemen,- "We are commanded to inform you that Her Majesty has availed herself of the earliest opportunity of having recourso to your advice and assistance after the dissolutioa of the last Parliament; and Her Majesty trusts that there will be found sufficient time during the present session to enable you satisfactorily to deal with various important matters, some of which had occupied the attention of Parliament in the beginning of this year. " We are commanded by Her Majesty to inform you that the general aspect of affairs in Europe affords a wellgrounded confidence in tho continuance of peace. " All the main stipulations of the Treaty of Paris have been carried into execution, and it is to be hoped that what remains to be done in regard to those matters will be speedily accomplished. "The negotiations upon the subject of the differences which had arisen between the King of Prussia and the Swiss Confederation in regard to the affairs of Neuchitel are drawing to a close, and will, Her Majesty trusts, be termi. nated by an arrangement honourable and satisfactory to all parties. "The negotiations in which Her Majesty has been engaged with the Government of the United States and with the Government of Honduras, in regard to the affairs of Central America, have not yet been brought to a close. "We are commanded by Her Majesty to inform you that a treaty of peace between Her Majesty and the Shah of Persia was sdgned at Paris on the 4th of March by Her Majestys Ambassador at Paris and by the Ambassador of the Shah; and Her Majesty wil give directions that this treaty shaU be laid before you as soon as the ratifications thereof shall have been duly exchanged. " Her Majesty commands us to express to you her regret that, at the date of the latest advices from China, the differences which had arisen between the High Commis. sioner at Canton and Her Majesty's Civil and Naval Officers in China still remained unadjusted. But Her Majesty has sent to China a Plenipotentiary fully instructed to deal with al matters of difference, and that Plenipotentiary wiU ba supported by an adequate naval and military force in the event of such assistance becoming necessary. " We are commanded to inform you that Her Majesty, in conjunction with several other European Powers, has conduded a treaty with the King of Denmark for the redemp. tion of the Sound Dues. This treaty, together with a separate convention between Her Majesty and the King of Denmrk, completing the arrangement, will be laid before you, and Her Majesty will cause the measures necessary for fulfilling the engagements thereby contracted to be submitted for your consideration. " Gentlemen of the House of Commons,- "Her Majesty has directed the Esimates for the present year to be laid before you. " They have been prepared with a careful attention to economy, and with a due regard to the efficiency of the deI par'ments of the public service to which they severally relate. "M My Lords and Gentlemen,- "Her Majesty commands us to recommend to your earnest consideration measures which wiU be proposed to you for the consolidation and improvement of thu law. "BElls wil be submitted to you for improving the laws relating to the testamentary and matrimonial jurisdiction now exercised by the Ecclesiastical Courts, and also for checking fraudulent breaches of trust. " Her MCajesty commands us to express to you her heartfelt gratification at witnessing the continued well-being and contentment of her people, and the progressive developement of productive industry throughout her dominions. " Her Majesty confidently commits to your wisdom and care the great interests of her empire, and fervently prays that the blessing of Almighty God may be vouchsafed to your deliberations, and may lead you to conclusions conducIve to the objects of Her Majesty's constant solicitude, the welfare and happiness of her loyal and faithful people." The reading of the RIoyal S peech was neither very impressive nor altogether free from hesitancy, the latter defect arising apparently from the iUegibility of certain parts of the manuscript, and when the noble and learned lord stumbled at some of the words, and had once or twice to repeat himself, a faint smile stole involuntarily over the breathless auditory, which an instinctive sense of the incongraity of such levity with the solemnity of ths occasion could not wholly repress. The Commissioners and Mr. Speaker having again interchanged formal bows, the Commons retired to their own Chamber. The LoRI) CH CELrOaxi then assumed his ususa place on the woolsack, and the four other Commissioners with. drew. The adminstration of the oaths to those Peers who had not yet complied with that form then recommenced, which wa3 the signal for the rapid dispersion of tho ladies; and in a few minutes the assemblage in the body of the House had dwindled down to the noble and learned lord on the wooL eack, the clerks at the table, and the handful of Peers who presented themselves to be swor. Among those who took tho oaths to-day were the Bishop of Lincoln, Lord Redesdale, the Earl of Lucan, LJord Abinger, and the Earl of .umngnhm. The sitting was suspended till 5 o'clock. Their Lordships re-assembled at 5 o'clock. PRIVILEGE OF REPORTING. Lord CAMPBELL gave notice that he should move tomorrow for a select committee to consider how far the privilege now enjoyed of publication of proceedings in courts of law might be extended to the proceedings of the two Houses of Parment and other public assemblages. The same noble lord also gave notice of motion for a committee to inquire and report on the expediency of changing the mode in which witnesses are now aworn to give evidence before committees of their lordshipe Houso. At a-quarter .5 o'clock the LoBD CHASCELLOR proceeded to read Herr Majests Speech, and that ceremony at its conclusion having been repeated by the Clerk at the table, The Marquis TOWNSHEND said, in risingto move the Address to the Speech of Her Most Gracious Majesty, although he felt that the present Government had conferred gre&t distinction on him by inviting him to undertake that duty, lie could not help feeling at the same tima how inade. quate he was to its performance, and how much he stood in noed of their lordihips! indulgence for auy omissions he might make in its discharge. It was his intention, .s far as he peodbly could, to onfine himslf to the topica of the Speech. He thought that all allusions to other matters had ettor bo avoided p order that thebir IorJhJgVht, Al come to that most desirable object-the giving a unanimous and satisfactory vote on the subject. (Hear.) In discharging tho duty confided to him he should detain their lordships bati a very short time. The present speech contained matter so little exceptionable in its character that he could not doubt that it must obtain the ready ooncurrence of their lordships. He must be permitted to make one or two observations in regard to the presct Parliament, which had been called to. gether under circumstanees with which the whole Housa was familiar. A vote in the late House of Commons decided substantially that the present Government had lost the con. fidence of that House, and it therefore became necessary either that they shoald relinquish office or appeal to the country. It was within a very few hours of the dissolation of the late Parliament that he heard in their lordships, House a noble Earl, whomhe regrettednot nov toseeia his place, speak of the noble lord at the head of the Government in terms which were not fairly applicable to the noble lord. He (the MArquis Townshend) regretted to hear the observations then made, because they were unworthy of the noble earl who gave expression to them, and certainly were not such as ought to have been applied to a man like the noble lord at the bezd of the Government. The noble earl said that the noble lord had no fixed principles, and haa only a name on which to go to the country. But the result proved that the noble lord had principles as well asa name. Ho did appeal to the oountry, and he (the 3Marquis Townshend) thought he might say the verdict had been in favonr of the noble lord. On that oceadon the country did not forget that it was the noble lord chiefly, supported by able men in their several depart. ments, who carried it through a memorable and fearful struggle to a satisfactory and glorious position. (Hear, hear.) He (the Marquis Townshend) womld make one ob. servation, not very palatable perhaps to noble lords oppo. site, but one, nevertheless, which he believed to be true. The noble lord at the head of the Government had not de. serted those men who were acting in very difficult circumstances many thousands of miles away from home. Instead of repudiating those men he stood up for them when they were assailed in Parliament, and by so doing he hai no doubt gretly augmented the feeing of the country in his favour. The country, when appealed to, most unequivo. ca)ly decided that the noble lord and the rest of the present Government were the men that should be in office, and not those who aspired to power, he (the Marquis Townshend) was sonry to say, by forsaldng and giving up the men who had served their country to the best of their power under circumstances of great diffifculty, and by lending themselves to the humiliation of the British fla. It was satisfactory to know that the most amicable relations existed between this country and nearly all the other Euaro. pean Powers, and that the general aspect of aflairs afforded a well-grounded confidence that peace would not be inter-- rupted. It was impossible not to regret the rupture-if he mIght call it a rupture-which had occured between the Governments of Great Britain and of Naples; but, although it was dreadfal to contemplate the inamons barbaritles which were committed in Naples, the people of this country could only look on, and trust that Providenoe might see fit, in its own good time, to restrain the excesses of the Neapolitan Government. He regretted that Her Majesty's Mimsters were unable to announce the termination of hostities at Canton. He had no doubt, however, thst when the reinforcements which were on their way to that quarter of the world arrived, and when the British forces were enabled to act on the offensive, they would soon teach the reckless barbians with whom they had to deal that they would no longer be permitted to commit the atrocities of which they had been 'guilty. (Hear.) There were several topics mentioned in the Speech from the Throne-as, forin- stance, measures relating to the improvement of the laws affectigthetestament6randmatrinonijuriictionof the ecclesiastical courts, and for checking fraudulent breaches of trust-to which he did not think it necessary to refer, further than to express a hope that they would receive the earnest and attentive consideration of Parliament. For his own part, he regretted that nothing was said in the Speech on the subject of Parliamentary Peform. The people had been long and patiently expecting some measure of reform h hea, and he had no doubt the noble lord at the dof the Government would propose a measure of reform quite as extensve as most of their lordships desired, and perhaps a good deal more so than some of them would like. (" Hear," and a laugh.) He certainly thought, conde the progress of education among the people and theirorderly and peaceable demeanour, that it would be most unjust to refuse an extension of the franchise because the subject had not been agitated in the country. (Hear, hear.) He also trusted that some measure would be introduced for settling the question of church-rates. In what manner such a settlement should be effected it was not for him to say, but he believed the membersof the Church of England would not be dissatisfied vith an arrangement which relieved those who were not members of that Church from contributing to its support by the payment of church- rates. He further hoped that a measure for the ad- minion of the Jews into Parliament would be received with more favour than such measures had hitherto obtained. He must confess he was surprised that.ma these days or enlightenment any persons should be so bigoted-for he could use no other word-as to refuse a man admission into the House of Commons because he happened to be a Jew. He not only hoped to see Jews in the other House of Pariament, but he would not mind seeing them in that House. A laugh.) For his own part, he would not object to see a Jew created a peer of Parliament (hear, hear); and he hoped that if, as was probable, ameasure on this sabject, backed by an enormous majority of the other House, shouldbe sent up to their lordships, they would give it their sanction. The noble marqms concluded by moving the address to the Crown, which was merely an echo of the loyalSpeech, and expressing his hope that it would meet the unainimous assent of the House. The Earl of PORTS3fOUTH, in seconding the address, claimed their lordships' indulgence for a few moments, while he touched very lightly upon some of the points referred to in the Speech from the Throne. He heard with much pleasure of the good feeling existing between the great Powers of Earope, which had been especiaUy evinced by the prompt andhonourable manner in which the conditions of the Treaty of Paris had aheady been so nearly fulfilUed. It was most satisfactory to find that the Sovereign of that vast empire with which we were recently engaged in a rivalry of arms, having seen the desolation brought upon his country by war, had now entered upon a rivalry with us in the arts of peace. It was gratifying to learn that a treaty of peace had been signed with Persia. That treaty afforded another proof of the moderation evinced by the British nation, and showed that she engaged in war, not for couquest, but for the protection of her own subjects, or of weak and oppressed States. He must be allowed to express his opinion that Her MAjesty's Government deserved great credit for breaidng through the practice which had hereto- fore existe, by appointing Sir James Ontram, an Indian officer, to the chief command of the British fores in Persia. He thought in that instance they had put the right man in the right place. Before quitting this subject he must say that he was proud, as an Englishman, to find that his ountrymen had manifested the same gallantry in Persia that had distinguished them in every other part of the world. The thanks of the country were especially due to the Indian troops for the gallantry displayeil by them, particularly In the charge of the irregular cavalry at the battle of Bushire. (Cheers.) Their conduct upon that occasion was another proof that the Indian native troops, when efficiently led, were animated by the same gallantry and determination as they exhibited under Clive and under the greatest of mode rn warriors-Weington. (Cheersm) Leaving this subject, h could not but express sorrowfor the continuance of hostities in China, but, now that th ehonourrof this great country was at stake, he vwas sure that no one who loved the country felt otherwise th an th at the war must b e carried on to the same successful termintion as that to which England was accustomed to conduct any WrU in which she happened to be engaged. He trusted that the result would be the promotion of trade, bY throwing open the important country of China to the commerce of the world. In that case the present hostilities would eventuaUy prove, through the extension of trade and civiiliation, to be tothe interest of both countries. (Hear, hear.) H1 -ccud not but express satisfaction at the conclusion of a treaty with the King of Denmark effecting a settlement of the Sound Duties, for he conceived that the termination of that impost would be a great advantage to this country, and he also was pleased to observe the recommendation in the Royal Speech of measures for the consolidation and improvement of the law. Nothing Was SO much wanted in this cOuntry as reform in the law, and he wa s sure that he ws speaki ng the sentiments of those around him, who, like h himelf, wer e interested in land, wvhen he said that no tax was so grievous to be borne as the attorney's bill tx. He was sure that wvhoever succeeded in ctting down the. fee feom frs. &L tt o. 4 Aaugli) and m au tce ceasp and easily attain. able would deserve the gratitude of their lordships and tte country. He likewise felt gratified at learmnig that measures were to be introdueed to abolish the ecclesiastical courts. That jurisdicton had been a disgrace to this oonutr,t, and he trusted that when the measures he referred to were brought forward the aavantage of them would be universally acknowledged, so that both parties in parliament, Whig and Tory, would join hand in hand in patting an end tothepresent t disgraeac l system. The Royal Spech also promised a Bill to prevent fraudulent breaches of trust and he Was sure that every one who had read the news: Papers Of late Years, and had observed how the widow and orphan had beenrjplundered,must feel the ncessity ofosome such measure. 'o rob the widow and orphan seemed to be as bad a crime as murder itself. Feelingg very axiious on the subject of church-rates he should be glad to see a Bill introduced for their abolition; and he trusted that the Government would take an early opporuneity of settling that question, which unfortunately now placed Churchmen in an antagonistc apositionv ith Dissenters. (Hear, he re.) The Earl of MAL oESBURy.-.f from private feelingn and reasons I regret the absence of my noble friend (the Earl of Derby), whO Usually sits on the bench near me, those feelings of regret ar increaedin consequence ofthe tak which IAa at this mOment obliged, as it were, to undertake, Of attemPtinga v ai n attemPt, I knowr-to fll his place for A few minutes, Your lordships will bear in mind that my nonble friend, while leading most ably thiz side of the House, always desied that on oocasions like the reaslnt the A td. dresi to the Throne should be carried in no churlish or reluctant spiri, but should be pasd with unaimity by your lordahi Po, I am glad to say that I see no apprehen. sson of a contrary course being taken to-night. (eear, hear.) I seo nothing in the Speech delivered by the Royal Commissioners WhigJ can pooiokdsion or Induce o I I I anyone to oppose the Address in answer to it recoimnndoe by the noble marquis and the noble earl posite Nevertheless, for a moment I had some fSer th. this might not be the case, 'when I liatoned to certain observations which fell from the nobM, marquis; and, if I were tD take his speech as an appendage to the Royal Speech, I certainly could not resume mgyseat. without commenting, however reluctanUy, on some of the: opiCS wrhich the noble marquis has boen pleased to intro-. duce to the notice of your lordships, and which are not to bo found in the copies of the Royal Speech in your lord. ships' hands. The noble marquis, having omitted to noticer three or four important sabjects to be found in the middle of the Royal Speech, introduced two other subjects not 1ejimporank-Parlimentar reform andchurch.rates, Now, I do thnkthatif anyonedesiredtora sadimussion, thebest thing he could do 'would be to select either one or both.. of those subject; 'which Her Majesty, in my opinion, Wisely, omitted from the Speech, but 'which the noble mnarquis intr0duoed Hlowever, the speech of the noble marquis 'was subsequnmt to the Speech of Her Majesty, and it is the Speech of HIer MAjesty alone 'which is to be looked upon as: authentic in this House, and in respect to 'which the Addres is to bo voted. I think, then, that the Government do n take toD sanguine a view, 'when they expres a hope that sthere Wi be found sufficient time during the presant. sessioni to deal with 'various important matters" for though the time be short I must say that the list of measures pro-- posed to be brought forward is also so small that we may fairly hope to get through it in the Present s teon. We sitting o n this side of the Hounse cannot but. shar in the pleasure exprema by the mover afn&I seoonder of the Address in reference to that p ap p of the Royal Speech which announces that thled &mrp Ereope is likely to continue undisturbed; and 'lpt4; could have ben added that peace iny Asa is also am ea- I am of opinionw that the peace of Erope is secure so long a-- that importantalliance now upon SO hapPy a fot0ng be. tween ourselves and France continues; and I believe that. for its continuane nothing is required t a jtdicious oofsideration ofthe differentt positions of France and Englcod both jeowraphicall7 and constinutionaly. I say this befroier bvensometimnes remarked a natural impatience opthe b,art of the Engi people in consequence of theit'y neig bours not having a constitution as free oE their own, forgetting 'what ought not to be forgotten, that the constitutions of both countries 'were create,j by the popular voice, and therefore, though differ. ing in detai they proceedy from the same foundsa. tion. The next point to which the Royal Speh adt verts is that which remains to be accomplised in respect. to the stipulations of the Treaty of Paris, the arrang ements relative to the Princiaime of W c an odavin having been left in an iomthplete state.ryspon this point I shall only remark that I hope my noble friend oppos n (theEarl of Clatendon) will not forget the original object of thew war with Runia, which has now hapily etea. Thaeti object I understood to be to secure the fture independence. and integrty of the Turkish Empire against any attack from its powerful neighbour. (Hear, hear.) Now, however it might be desired to take up the cause of nationalities, In trust that the original object ofthe warq'wil whom kept in view, and thei Turkiah frontier rendered secure in the most effective manner, 'whethier by a union of the two PiAncipalities or bykeeping them separate. In referenco tohe settlement of theaffair of Neuchtel your lordhips cannot bt texpress. great plelsure for there islwaysfeltin this countrY the greatest possible sympathy with Switzerland, on accunt of resemlsnce in religious and constitutional matters. Withg respect to the peace fortunately concluded with Perslm,st trust that theaGoverment w eil inform the House at bwhit date theI aexpaed that the news of that peace 'would reach Sir James O ntram and his army, so that we ssay have some hope of soon hearing of'o an. end beiing put to the necesatry shedding of blood. I do not know that I should h ave said anything upon ah subject 'which is perhaps the most important in the 'whole. Speech, and which has certainly occupied the attention of this country of late more than any other-Ismean the dis-- pate with China-had it not been for a reference to the past debates upon that subject which 'was made bythe noble mis 'who moved the Address, and'which I thinkhaal better ~ave been omitted. It appears samost childish to,. tellyoutr lordships that we on this side of the House and some noble lords on the other side who took a different view of the question to that which was entertained by Her Majesty's Mibyters did so from a deep sense of duty and from no other feeling. (hear, hear.) It would be avifmr childish, I ray, to repeat that assertion to your lordships, because I am persuaded that no one evernrecord a vote in this House without conscientiously believing thatin o giving that vote he is performing an act of duta . But the noble marquis alluded to what had pawsed, and he made use of an exresdsonlwhieh I cannot allow to remain unnoticed. I sheroulntr have referred to it perhaps, however, had it not been the echo of what was state by a moreimportant personage than the noble marquis-I mean by the noble viscount at the head of Her Majesty ayGoveiment. The noble marquis, adopting the tone of the noble uviscount said that there were men who were prepared for s the sake of offce to accept-as I understood him-the degracation of the Englshe flag. A heavier charge, tmYlords, Icdd not potsibility be laid upon any member of Par- lament,wortun (eany hgentleman in this country. (Hear, hear) Iwoud gadl have avoided alluxdinig to, even if I d couldnno tforget, tnamosrt similar terms 'which were made ucofby. the anob wviscount at the head of the Government. fegrrdedbing to th ersons who might possibly succeed hiam intofie, hesaidn oftm and of those who had voted agaist views on the China question that they were men 'who' had "1thusendeavoured tomakethe humiliationana degrada-. dation of their country the stepping-stone to power." My lords, I do not believe that there is any precedent for lat- guagesch as that ever proceeding from so high a souroe. Hwear, hear.) I do not think that evencin-the heat of any- debate I ever heard such language; but your lordshipsmust recollect that the language to which I refer wasdnot. spoken in the heat of debate, but that it Was calMlY'written, printed, aLnd addresd to his constituents by the noble viscount at Tiverton. Of thenoble viscounts attack, therefore, I say no more than that it 'was unworthy his great reputation, talent, and sition, and that it was as absurd as it was unworthy.(Ha,hr. It was absurd, because in a degraded countr no poe is attached to office -on the contrary the man rueshsuch a country ist to most degraded being in it. Forgive ae, my lords, if I have- ken with warmth on this subjet, for I confess that I feel strongly upon it. (Hear, hear.) But to revert to' the question of China. We never denied upon thismd of the House that the Chinese had given to this country considerable cause of offence ; but what 'we psated 'was that the punishment inflicted was out of proportion to the offence-that popu. lations destroyed and towns attacked were rather tood' stronig measure of retaliation for the affront which had been offered by the Chinese. We adde that we thought that the plenipotentiay tand admiral at Canton should have waited for further ordiers from hoeo before they proceeded to extremitie Those were the points on which'we grounded our opposition; and I must add now that if Her Majesty'Government had at the time been opleasd to state, as they now do in the Royal Speech, that they were about to send an eminent person to settle the differnnes in China, myfirm belief i that no division would have takten plac on that question, and that Her Majesty's Government would not have been opposed. (Hear, hear.) Beyond the few 'words which I have now addressed to your lordships I haven oify further to express a hope that when the estimates. for the present year come to be presented we shall fiLnd. that the promise that they wihl beedrawn up with. a careful attention to economy is nost achere idle and formal phrase. (Hear, hear.) With a war now progressr.)in China, and with an expensive war only justiconcluded, we surely cannot afford to throw away a sigleshilg, and I shall upon a future occaion take an opportunity of bringing before your lordships what appears to me to be considerable extravagance and 'waste of public money now tating place within this very metropoigs. I hope tht the, Government w lomit nothing in order to carry out thea war in China with vigour and effect to a speedy and succesful termination, for I can assur them that they will not. find upon this side of the House any undue reluctance to'. assist them withallU that can be required to make England's powver acknowledged and respected. That they may be armed with the means, however, to maintain the honour of' the country, the strictest economy in other -matters will be. nots only desirable, but necessary. (Hear, hear.) Having sad thus much I can. only Presume, in the unfortunate absence of my noble friend, to advise my noble friend behind me %4 assent to the terms of the Address which has been proposed; and I, for one, shall do so most cheerfull.T (Hea, hear.) Earl GRA&NMLE.-In answer to t-he question Which, 'wass adressed to Hier Majesty's Government by the nobla earl who has just sat down I have tostate that atelegraphic` messge has been received this VerY afternoon, from whichit appears that on the 5th of April the general commanduing. the British forces in Persia received information, of the treaty with Persin having been signed at Paris; so that 'we. can have no doubt tlhat ubsquetl toI-+ thatdat all u necessary bloodshed had ceasedl (Eear, hear.)

(Hear.) As to the expressions of the nobla. viscount at the head of the Government, which were said t; have been repeated by the noble marquis, I cannot admim that they bear the interpretation which the noble earl his pot upon them. No doubt, in the contest of parties ques' tions are ocasionally raised with the view of displacin, those in power, and it may be that such questions are mods properly raised (hear), but, if the noble viscount went beyond the ordinary bounds, let me remind the noble earlalthough at the same time I strongly deprocate the intro- duction of those personal matters-that at the close of thee late session the noble earl not now present (the Earl of 3Derby) did in this House give a very strong and personal deI acription of that noble viscount whicb, in my opinion, in the, opnion of my noble friends behind me, and in the opinion of the country, were not borne out by fkcts. (Hear, her. I isvo thought it right to mention this, although it is very mXdesirable upon these occasions to enter upon questions of7 a personal natUre, or to advert to topies 'which liuy give riseto anydebteof anacrimonious chacter; and I sin-. ceTelw hope that any bitterness which nay have been exeiaed during the elections has by this tune smbsided, so that.

HOUSE OF COMMONS, THumDAY, MAY 7. The SP}ArER took the chair at 1 o'clock. The object of meeting so early was to permit the oaths to be administered to such members as had not been sworn on previous occasions. At the commencement of the sitting only a few hon. gentlemen were present, but before the Usher of the Black Rod appeared with a message from the Lords the benches on both sides of the House were well filled. The new membersmustered ia large nunibers. None of the Ministers, however, were in their places, and the principal members of the Opposition present were Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, Mr. Napier, and Mr. Whiteside. Among those who took the oaths we observed Lord Althorp, Lord Edwin ill, Lord Brsrleigh, Sir Edward Bnlwer LyttMi, Mr. James Wilson, Mr. Henry Drummond, Mr. Henley, Mr. Napier, Mr. Whiteside, Colonel Forester, Mr. Grogan, Mr. W. Ewart, Mr. Pugh, and Mr. Bowyer. The Usher of the Black Rod was announced at five minutes past 2 o'clock. Ee wore his official costumn, and, advancing to the table, summoned the House to attend at the bar of the House of Lords to hear the Queen's SDeech read. The Speaker immediately obeyed the summons, and was followed to the other House by nearly all the members pro sent. On his return, after an absence of notmorethan five minutes, the sitting was at once suspended til the evening. Upon the reassembly of the House at a quarter to 4 o'clock several members appeared at the table and were sworn, inoluding the Marquis of Stafford, Mr. Adderley, Lord Lovaine, Mr. Alderman Cubitt, Lord Raynham, &c. SESSIONAL ORDERS. The sessional orders wero read and agreed to. The Outlawry Bill was read a first time. POSTAL COMMUNICATION WITh IRELAND. Colonel FRENCH asked whether any arrangement had been effected for expediting the conveyance of the mails between Dublin and London? Mr. WILSON replied that every exertion had been used to attain the object referred to by the hon. member, and, having been that morning in communication with the Postoffice authorities, he was enabled to state that a plan would be submitted to-morrow which he believed would be found to be aoceptable to the railway companies.

The SPEAKER said,-I have to report to the House that the Honse has this day been to the Hou5e of Peers, wvhere it has been addressed by the Commissioners appointed under the Great Seal for opening the first session of this prasent Parliament. The Lord Chancellor, who was one of the Commissioners, made a speech to both Houses of Parliament, of which forgreater accuacyl have procured a copy. The right hon. gentleman having read the Speech of the Lords Commissioners, Mr. DODSON, who wore a Court dress, in moving that a humble address be presented to Her Majesty in answer to her gracious Speech, said that though he regretted the task had not fallen to one more experienced and more competent than himself, yet he derived encouragement from a consciousness that the topics touched upon in the Speech were of such a nature that no shortcomings of his would be rllowed to impair the unanimity with which he trusted the motion which he was about to submit to the House would be received. (Hear.) Among the various subjects affording grounds for congrata. lation which were mentioned in the Royal Speech there was one which formed, he regretted to say, a prominent excep. tion to the rest. He alluded to the position of affairs at Canton. Upon an occasion such as that upon which he had the honour to address the House he was auxious to refrain from introducing into his observations all debateable matter, and he should, therefore, upon the original merits of our dispute with the authorities of that city make no remark whatsoever. Hon. members upon both sides of the House would, he felt assured, concu in approving the course which Her Majesty's Government had adopted in sending out to China as soon as possible large reinforcements of troops and vessels of a class suited to warfare in the Chinese waters, while, they upon the other hand, testified their readiness to conclude an hononrable peace, and their anxiety to act in the spirit of justce by sending out a plenipotentiary who had shown himself to be so eminent and successful a negotiator as Lord Elgin. (Hear, hear.) He trusted that the policy of this country towards other nations would always be found to be in accordance with the dictates of justice, and in the case of weaker Powers than hersef not of justice alone, but also of forbearance and mercy. (Hear, hear.) He must, however, observe that reason and experience alike tended to show that when one had to deal with a semicivilized peop'e concession was liable to be regarded by them as a sign of weaknesa, and he therefore hoped that the Chinese would be taught before long to estimate properly the real strength of this country, as well as to appreciate the motives by which our conduct had been actuated, and that the result of the existing complications would be to placr oar relations with China upon an intelligible and durable basis. (Hear, hear.) We had been also engaged in hostilities with another Bastern Power-Persia-which seemed to suppose that it could brave us with impunity; but he rejoiced to learn that a treaty of peace with that Power had been signed at Paris which was highly honourable to that country, wbile he trusted that it did not fail to secure so England those advantages to obtain which she had entered into the war. Meanwhile, the results of our operations in the Plsidan Gulf and the advance of our troops into the interior of the country served to show that there was no coast so inhospitable, no climate so formidable, no position so inaccessible as to be secure against the energy and tho valour of the Bdtish soldier. (R(ear, hear.) He trusted that our successes in Persia would have the effect of spreading our prestige among the most remote districts of Central Asia, and would prevent that country herself,from entering into relations with any other Power unfavourable to England, or from endeavouring to retain possession of a place of such growing importance as the city of Herat. He alluded to Herat as a place of growing importance because of the facilities which it afforded for the extension of commorce by means of that system of land carria e which had of late vears enabled that mode of conveyance, in some instances, even to supersede carriage by water, and which tended to restore the caravan route of Asia to somewhat its ancient importance. kierat, was in short, not only the centre where a great commercial and a great military highway met and intersected one another, but was in itself a position from which the surrounding country might be easily controlled. With respect to countries nearer, home, Her Majesty had been pleased to assure theHouse that peace and barmony prevailed, and that friendly relations subsisted between England and all the European Powers. The main stipulations of the treaty of Paris had, they were informed, been fulfilled, and he thought he might add that their fulfilment reflected great credit pon the vigour and discretion which had been displayed by Her ajesty's Gtovernment. (Hear, hear.) The vexed question of tho Soud dues had also,, he was happy to be able to say been settled, while the stormy cloud which had gathered over Neuchaitel had been dissipated. He regretted, however. to be obliged to state that the negotiations respecting the position of affairs in Central America had not been brought to a close, but he trusted he was nbt too sanguine in indulgiag in the anticipation that there existed no reason to apprehend a contest between two nations so intimately c Snuected as w,ere England and the UJnited States of A merica. Such a war would, indeed, beso detrimentl anad so pernicious to the prosperity of both countries that it would be scarcely spealdag in the language of exaggeration to say that th. greatest calamity which could befal either State next to defeat in the contest would be to be v,ictorious. (Hear, hear. ) Her Majesty had commanded the estimates to be laid before the House, and he should not trespass upon its time by dweling in anticipation upon the measures which the ChanceUor of the Exchequer might deem it to be his duty to introduce for their consideration. He should, however, express a hope that they would be f.4und to realize that combination of economy and efficiency, that due maintenauce of the public service with that immunity from oppressive taxation which had been sbadowed forth in the Royal Speech. He trusted the financial pollcy of the right hon. gentleman would be in accordance with those principles which, by giving freedom to industry and capital, had so much contribute, to promote the wellUbeing and contentment of the community at large -tbat well.being to which the condition of the agricultural and commercial interests bore so strikidng and irrefragable a testimony. For his own part he felt convinced that the House would not shink from that sacrifice of time and labour which the onerous task of amending our laws-a task so prominently recommended inthe Speech from the Throne -would require. If so long vexed aquVestion as that could be settled in a satisfactory manner during the session which had just commenced, the present Parliament might upon that ground lay claim to have conferred a most important benefit upon all classes of the community. He had a coafident expectation that the new House of Commons would prove itself to be with respect to great and comprehensive measures of legislationa worthy successor of the Parliaments by which it had been preceded, and he trusted it would, by adopting the policy of making reforms in season, not hesitate to renovate until it becamenecessary to reconstruct. By pursuing that true English policy they would have done aU that lay in theirpower to maintain their country in that high position wvhich she now occupied among the nations of the earth. (Cheers.) With respect to the less ambitious measures of practical improvement, he might venture to say that they were of a character with which the present Par. liament was peculiarly competent to deal (hear, hear). inasmuch as in the return which had just been made of representatives to that House no antagonistic array of interest against interest, or of class against class, was observable. (Hear, hear.) He saw in the result of the late elections no symptoms of the existence of a conflict between town and county. He pereeived no differences, in fact. but such as had their origin in conviction and reason, and wbich, therefore, might by the same causes be converted into harmony and unanimity. (Hear, hear.) If he might be alowed to make alusion to so humble an individual as himself, he would say that he hailed it as a happy augury of the agreement which, upon questions of social improve. mient,might he expected to prevail between members of that House that the address in answer to the Royal Speech had for its mover and secondertwo individuals representing constituencies so dissimilar as those which had returned his hon. friend near him (Mr. Buchanan) and himself. (Hear, hear.) He had the honour of representing a county which was situated in a peculiarly agricultural portion of England, embracing within its limits one of the largest and most rapidly growing towns on our southern coast, wbile his hon. friend sat for one of our greatest commercial towns, one of the busiest hives of mining and manufacturing industry in the empire. In conclusion, he offered to the House his heartfelt thanks for the kidness, forhearance, and indulgence with which theybhad heard him, and moved that a humblie Address be presented to Her Majesty thanking her for the gracious speech which shehad ordered to be addressed to both HRonses. (Cheers.) Mr. BUJCHAX2h,, who wore the uniform of a deputy. lieutenant, seconded the Address. It might be superfluous for him to discuss subjects which had already been so ably noticed, were it not desirable that members who represented large constituencies and had recently had an opportunity of observing what were their sentiments and opinions should report to the H3use what had been the result of their ob. servations, (Flear, hear.) The noble lord at the head of the GovernMent had submitted to the country the question of contentor not content with his Administration, andpaz. ticulaily with his foreign policy. That Wa the irsaue uponl which he went to the constituencies, and the answer had been a verdict, it not nni. msoualy, at eaO bv a arge majority of 'votes, -sn favour Of tXe (%umment ot tho noble lord. tHearr, eaw.) One thing had been established beyond question-it had been clearly shown that neither eloquence, nor talents, nor long and valuable publio services would saffioe to support the position aud influenoe of statesmen who might have oppo3ed themselves to the general convictions and oplnions of the country. (Hear, bear.) It was not because the country had ceased to admire the eminent talents of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford (Ur. Gladstone) or had forgotten the servioes of the late member for the West Riding (Mr. Cobden), that the mnajority which they possessedinthe lastHomse of Commonshad-een signally reversed. Not aU their talents or eloquence could carTy the coantry along with them. Unsophisticated publio opinion could not comprehend their arguments nor appre. ciate their policy. (Cheers, and a slight laugh from tho Opposition benches.) The noble lord (Lord Palmerston) had announced a line of policy by which the honour of England was to be main. tained aud her executive in a distant land was to be supported, and it was on that account that the constituencies generally had so enthusiastically responded to his appeal. (Hear, hear.) The question which immediately led to the dissolution of Parliament had out of doors been regarded as involving large and important interests, it bad been remarked that within the walls of Parliarent the whole argument was conducted upon narrow and technioal grounds. (Hear, hear.) The seizure of the Arrow, the legality of the license under which she sailed, the various details of the trausactions which preceded the outbreak of hostilities at Canton, were no doubt all most importaut and well worthy of careful discussion: but more important stil were our relations with the empire of China. It WAs not because the people of England were anxious for a Chinese war, or for any war, that they enthusiastica3ly came to the rescue of our authorities in that remote quarter of the Vworld; it was bcuse they thought it necessary that there should be a clear expression of opinion in support of the honour and interests of the country. Our cornexion with China was altogether poculiar. For 200 years Britain had in China no representative except a trading company. We had with that empire nol political relation; in fact scare-ly any recognized relations Of any Idnd. While the East India Company could nuot perhaps be blamed for the paciic, the too pacific policy which they adopted, and which possibly was the only course which they, looking to their own interests, could pursue, it must be admitted that their policyhad, as regarded the interests of Great Britain, operated most detrimentally. For a long course of years it wa, the habit of the East India Company, enjoying the monopoly of a lucrative trade, to sabmit to such treatment as it pleased the Chinese officials to give them, It must have been in consequenco of express orders from the India House that the supercargoc of the factory at Canton so completely abjured the spirit of Englishmen as to submit to the insults which they experienced. That was the ste of affairs during 200years When the time came for tho British Government to put for_ ward its influenco and power in China it was found to be a matter of extreme difficulty to establish with that halfcivilized country tho relations and observances which ale common among European States; and it was not without the most vexatious and harassing negotiations, it was not until] af ter embroilments and quarrels which terminated in the death of Lord) Napier, that we obtained the Treaty of Nankin, by which free access to the northern ports of China was given to the European settlers. In those ports Europeans were received with all kindness and courtesy, but in the south of China, at Canton, a totally different course was followed. By that treaty the Cantonese were bound to open the gates of their city in tno same manner as had been done elsewhere. That stipulation was from the very first resisted, and at this day it had never been flfiiled. Instead of softening the hostile conduct by which they had formerly been distinguished the Chinese at Canton had become more disposed to hostile proceedings against the Europeans settled there. No language was too offensive to designate the outside barbarians, no acts were too savage for the implacable hostility of the Chinese. Under these circumstances it was not to bo supposed that the representatives of England in that country would stand tamely and quietly by and see the British flag outraged. Had they pursued such a course the arroganco of the Chineso would have become greater than ever, and negotiations wonld have been nearly inpossible. It was not only in China that we came in contact with the subjects of the Celestial Emnpire. That industrions and commercial race had spread thexpselves over the Indian Archipelago; they were to be met with in Borneo and Sumatra, in Java and Siam; they were to be found in large numbers in our own settlements in the Eastem Seas, and had contributed largely to the population of Australia and California. The position of British settlers in the colonies belonngm to theircountry wassomewhat critical. In Singapore there were 70,000 Chinese colonists, while the number of English settlers was infinitely smaUer, and in Penang and Malacca the disproportion was stiU greater. It should be remembered that those Chinese emigrants maintained relations with the secret societies in their own country, so thatthose societies had ramifications in all the colonies which contained Chinese settlers. The lato sanuinar proceedings at Sarawak afforded an illustration of tho danger to which British colonists wero exposed, and could aiy one with these facts beforo him advocate on the part of the Government a weak and vacillating olicy' with reference to China t In deahng with Orinotal nations ritishC was a matter of the highest importanoe. The British empiro ini India owed its stability to the prcsti*C cquired by British arms and arts, and thatyreseige once broken down that empire from the north to the south would totter to its base. Under the circumstances which now existed he viewed with great satisfaction the appointment of a nobleman of the experienco and tried ability of Lord Elgin to the position of Envoy Extraordinary to China. (near, hear.) The difficulties which that nobleman would ave to contend against were not confined to the sub- Pct of our relations with the Chinese, but they also were I incident to other considerations. To the north-east of China a scheming nd vicious Power was advancing in a manner calculated to excite alarm and apprehension. Russia had acquired in those parts a large territory, which might at some future period be used for purposes inimical to British commerce, and that was a subject well worthy of consideration. Another question of foreign policy, well worthy of attention at the present moment, was the state of Sotithern Italy. He trnsted he should not be deemed to bo going beyond the markod routine of occasions like the present if he referred to the disgraceful scenes which at present were enacted in certain portions of the Italian Peninsula. He had no apprehension of want of firmness on the part of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs in discountenancing such ceedings, for the noble earl who filled that o(ic had too frequently exhibited true British feeling to be saspected of wanting it now, and of not protesting in the most decided manneragainstthe perpetration of such deeds; but he wished himself on that occasion, in the name of peace nnd humanity, to record his own prote,t against them. The opening of a new Parliament san epoch in political histor. It was a landmark by which to measure the progress of social and poltical advancement and there were many persons in the country who looked to the present Parliament to inaugurate many reforms. As far as those expectations were just and reasonabl he trusted that they might be realized, and without doubt the subject of the extension of the franchise must at no distant period occupy the attention of the Government. (Hear, hear.) He was not one of those who thought that to extend the franchise would secure a better House of Commons, and he was well aware that, arguing the question on the ground of expediency alone, a good case could be made out against any such extension. The question, however, was not one of expedience. It was a question which involved the riNhts of those who believed that they were entitled to political power, andit ought to be discussed on that ground; and he might add, that if those rights were moderately, but, at the ame time, firmly expressed, the Government would find it necessary, not only to entertain, but alsoto. dispose of the question. (Hear, hear.) If, however, it should be founad necessary to extend the franchise, it would at the same time be necessary to establish a system of general education; and, when he considered how many able men on both sides of the House had devoted-their attention to the subject, he confidently trasted that ere long such a system would be carried into effect. Her Majesty, in her gracious Speech, had congratulated Parliament upon the commercial prosperity of the country, and he fnlly participated in the views therein exPressed; but, at the same time, he hoped he might be allowed to say that there appeared at the pro. sent moment some indications which were calculate to give rise to doubt and anxiety, and one of those indications was the excessive dearness of money. Whatever might be the cause of such a state of things-a shteof things ruinous to commerce-he rejoiced that the committee upon banking was about to be re;appointed, and he trusted that that com- that they wonld carefully sift the evidence which might be brouaght beore them, and that -no mono I influeDce might preventrigidinquiry andjustlegisl,tion,'W webeothersabjects also which would occupy the attention of Parli&ment, and it wa ouly becoming in that House toassur Her laje-sty, inx reply to her gracious Speeh, that tbey were p'repre o devote their time and their beet atiteaton and to exibt l their zeal and energy in leIslating for the welfare of the country. (H,ear be6m) T hon. gentleman concluded by seconiding the Address. The Address, which was an echo of the Speeh from the Throne, having been rea& at the table, General THOMrPSON said? that the necessity of apear. ing without shame before friends and constituents obiged him to cuter his protest against all which he had beard o the Chinese quesion. Those memubers who coincided ia opinion with the defunct House did not intend to allow this question to pass without bringing it before the inquest of the country- (Alaugh.) They believed that this con. lration had arisen from tie voluntary act of an Englis'a ciacl in Ch3ca, and they grieved to see the Governme L set up the painciple that all that an official might do was, t pas withoat remark. His constituents, who were b-ra4 workeng naen, wanted to know whether this country wi to be pIrAged in war by every official abroad, and whetht their hard earnings were to bo talren, from them. for the purpose of ming fortunes for English offir,ials in foreign countries; or h that tba ques. tit,n seemed to resolve itslf. Many of our pro_eeaings F,ad been contrary to the national holsnor and d.ti°ity, and veemed to have for their object the in' rease of smuggling. It would ill become him to assnme the offica of defending this great cause. There was afeea3: in the country which would not be quieted witho'a !rther examinatioi, and herwot he thanked the Hotwa for the attention with which they had heard him. ("Rear:' and alaugh.) Lord P. GROSVENGF, said, that considering the question that the late PaiV.ament were called upon to decide was more in ith Aatum of a judgmqnt upon the past policy of the Govnriment with regard to th4 state of xaffSi a' Cantontthass their fature policy, le thought thit, upon theoccasion of voting the Addies ti.t 4ue*iou might have been left in aboeyance- In the fewriemarks hel should rqw venture to inle' heashould not touch upon. thit topiT at alL Upon many former occaions then the Rouse had met fokeigu affairs bad presented a more cheering prospect than at present, yet he wagratified to fmd that the-present aspect of foreign affairs did not lead to the apprehension. that the present peace would be broken in Europe. The mover and secouder of the Address, and more especially the mover, had addressed the House in speeches characterized by considerablo ability, but he thought the honl gentleman who had seconded the Address had travelled a little oat of the question. (Rear.) He had plot intended to say anything totrouble the unanimity which was likely to prevail, bat as this was the first occasion on 'which the new Parliament had met, and as hon. ifiembers were now fre3h from the embracs of their oonbtitnents it would nor be fair to the Government if they-did uot toel them what their ConstitUents most desired to see casied into execution. Ile could not pretend to be the organ of any section in the House or to speak for anyone bat himself, but having perhaps had the longest fW.c-Weith his constituents of any candidate at the loat election, andhaving addressed public meetings for the spee of thresr weeks in the metropolitan county, it would, he trusted, not be unbecoming in him if he gave an outline of what 1i consti tuents most desired. (Hear, hear.) One of the subjectg which occupied their attention was the reform of Parliament (cheers), or rather, to adopt the butings phrase, the extension of the sufrage. (HEor.) He ooncurred in the opinion expressed by the soconder, and also .by Mr. Cobden, that the Hous of Commons as at present elected did substantially express pablic opimon in this coantry. But that was not the case the House had to deal with. Nor was it altogether a question- of giving the franchise to the poorer classes, for many persons who were not poor didnot posse3s the suffrage (hear), and that was one of the evils that the publicdesired to seeremedied. The great; Reform Bill of Lord Grey, or rather perhaps he minght say of his noble friend ne%r him (Lord J. Russell), was a very great step in advance. Still the interval of 24 years which had since elapsed had shown the defects and anomalies of that Bill. The 40s. franchise in counties was low, lint, considering the expenses of a land tenure and the present working of society; it was impossible not to see thist large numbers of men whom he belioved to be better quaPed than those who actually possessed the francoise were excluded from its exercise. It was the business of the House to see that a ramedv was applied for this state of things. (Hear, heir.) e trusted that the course taken by the House would zvold the, necessity for perpetual reforanbills, which causedaneansious feeling both in and out of the House that was detrimental to the good working of Government, and in a trading i-int of view affected the money-market. (Hear, hear.) Itwould be a good thing if the noble lord at the head of the Gevernment-whom his constituents desired him to support, and' whom both he and they desired to see long occupying the place he now filled (cheers)-could devise something more elastic and self-auting than that Reform Bi unde'r which; the House was now elected. (Hear, bear.) Ie did not, desire to see tho entire power given to numbers, but somethng more self-acting and giVing more equality of numbers thau at present prevailed might be devised. Re should deprecate any attempS on the part of hon. members d this half session to introduce a Reformn Bill, hbtiet that the Government would next session, yielding to the express wishes of the constituencies of the country, bring in . z3l whicb. would be satisfactory to the counrry He trusted also that ample time would be given for the consideration and discussion of this subject Passing from that point, he wished to call the attention of the House to some of the practices-he would notsay the corrupt practices, but Practioes which could mot be approved-at elections. He had the honour in aM former session of inducing the House to take two out of the four steps recommended by the committee of 1836-7. One was to shorten the duration of county polls to one dcy; the other entirely to prohibit treating at elections._ (Hear, hear.) As he had shown himself, therefore, not.altogether an unsafe guide on the subject, he hoped tobe able to induce the House to take the two remaining steps-vis.,to prohibit the conveyance of voters by candidates, and to relieve the latter of the expenses of hustings. It was his intention at the earliest possible moment, while hon. gentle. men were stil smarting underthe expenses of their election, to introduce a Bill upon that subject. (Hear, hear.) The, question of church-rbtes had likevise attracted a good deal ofthe attention of his constituents. It was a subject in vhich the country at large was extremely interested; and, without disparagement to the new member for the Tower Bamlets. he regretted that Sir William Clay, who had so often and so ably brought the question under their notice, no longer occupied a seat in the House. In his opinion there was only one way of settling the question, and he trusted the Government would make up their minds to adopt it; if not, he was himself prepared to propose a Bill on the snbject, and he hoped to have the support of the Rouse. (Hear, hear.) He felt, however, that the matter was one so deeply affecting the interests of the established church that it ought to be dealt; with by the Government, and not left in the hands of any rivate member. (Hear, hear.) Another point to which he desired to call their attention was the position in which the House stood with respect to its membership. The, Houee was not complete at the present moment ; it wanted its full complement of members, and he mentioned the cir. cumstance for the purpose of saying that there were several large and populous metrepoh districts-Chelsea, iKensington, and Hammersmith, for example-to which the vacant seats m'ight be given with advantage to the country. (Hear, hear.) He trusted, also, that the House wrould direct its attention to the equalization of tho poor-rates. That -was a question which peculiarly affected the metropolitan districts; but, though in a great measure local, it was deserving of serious consideration. (¶ear. hear.) Ile begged to ex.press, in conclusion, his approbtiorL of the manner in which the Addrespiad been drawn up. There was nothing in the document to which any member could fairly object, and for his own part he did notinten to move an amendment. (Hca hear.) JLr. W. EWART regretted that no allusion was made in the Speech from the Throne to the question of a Ministry of yustice. That subject was brought forward in the last; Parliament by the right hon. gentleman the member for Dublin University, and, O his motion,*an Address was greed to by the House. In the Speech from the Throne reference was made to many law reforms, but he could not see how those reforms were to be accomplished unless they were to have a source or fountain from which they might be derived. The foundation of all lawreformvwas, inks opinion, the establishment of a Ministry of Justice. With respect to the question of Parliamentary reform, he did not wish to press it prematurely upon the attention of the Government; but he thought the best courme would be for Ministers to. lay before the House znd the country such returns as might enable them to form an intelligent opinion upon any measure which might be proposed in a future session. The countrysht,uld have an opportunity of seeing, for example, what; effect the franchise would have- if based upon. education, property, or population,and he hoped to hear from the Governmnent that such a proposition was not alien to the policy which they had prescribed-for themselves. The hon. gentleman had no sooner resumed his seat than cries of "Question" arose from all parts of the House. No member appearing disposed to continue the discussion, the SrxAxm after the lapse of twvo or three minutes began to read the terms of the motion, but be had not proceeded beyond the first few words when he was interrupted byA Lord PALMERSTOLN, who said,-The House, Sir, seems so little disposed to go into any discussion upon the variou5 subjects to which the, Speech relates that I certainly shall nottake upon myself to-do so. but reference has beer made to one or two points upon which I feel it is nicessary for me to say a few words on the part of the Govetnment. I Would first alude to the topic mentioned by the hon. member for Dumfries. An Address was moved and agreed to last session with respect to the establishment of a. Department of Justice.. The question was brought forward by the right hon. gentleman the member for Dublin University. Wo stated at the tiue that it was a. subject full of difficulty as regards the mode in which the proposition should be carried into execution, and in that opinion. I am smre the, right hon. gentleman himself will concur. I can only say, therefore, that we have under our consideration the bes' means of accomplising. th.object which the right hon. gentleman and the lSouse had iu view, and I trust we shail beable to propose to the House-some, arrangement which bsail effet the purpose contemplated in the Address. (Hea'.> hear.) Sir, I agree withi the noble lord the member for Middlesex that, considering the shortness of the period durinR which Parliament cmasit in the present session (hear, her), considering also. the great. importance of the many practical measares, of improvement which we have indicated in the Speech, and which will be proposed to the House, it Would be highly inexpedient to engage in discassions upon the larg% and sweeping question of a cbange ire the representstion, of the people in Parliament, because such discussions could not by any possibility lead to any conclasive resulynL.the present session (hear, hear), while it is quite obvious &inFt discussions begun in-oie session and continue& to another could only unsettle, the winds of men, and gstj rise to anticipations which would embarrass those 'who en a fature occasio might have to propose measures to the House. (Hear, hear.) But, Sir, Her Xajesty's Government quite adint that it will be their du's durinn the psriod that WMill intervene between the conclusion of the present session and the beginning of the next; t. tale the subject into their fullest and most deliberate 'obnsideration. (Cheers.) It would be unsuitable in me, at a moment when the Governmenrt have not h%d an opportunity of giving to the question the consideration awhch is duo, to say anything with.respect. to the details of measures to be proposd in a future session which would imply anticipatory conolusions, which, by fixing the Governmentb upon one point or another, might lead afterwards to embarrassmOnt if the result should not coincide with tba expectations excited, and which at all events would interfere withthefreedomof our deliberationsinthomeantime. (Hoax'} It will be, however, I believe, the duty of the Government in the onsuing recess to give that matter their most sorious and anxious consideration (hear, hear), and I hop-indeed I am coafident-that at the beginning of the next session we sball be able to propose to Parliament some measure 'which will be calculated to tisfy the just expectations of any paies, and to correct any defects which may exiit ixn | h ssn comAct, as welles to axdmit-tothe~franohis. theo present Ref orm, o,uwl aQ dmtA h f oi those classes of persons who 'M- pfeant an) excluded from it.

EQuAIJ TTION OF HEB .POOR-RATn.-Last evenmg a very nuxmeroosly-attended meeting of the ratepayers of the city of London was held at the London Coffeehouse, Ludgate-hU, to consider tho propriety of petitioning Par- liament for ani eq-ualiz-ation of the poor-rates upon a uni- form basis of assessment throughout the metropolitan districts. Mr. Alderman Sidney took the chair, 4an remarked that the question under consideration, whether regarded in Th social, a moral, or an equitable point of view, demanded the mnost attentive cons eration of the ratopayers of the aetropolis. It was beyond atl question the duty of the country to conxtrihte by means of taxation to the relief of the poor of the land, lut this should be done equitably, snd the tax should fal eu lly uon all the 14,00 parialhes of England and Wales. Veoula se no reasn why, if the criminal and lunatic population wero to he maintained by meas of a consolidated rate, which falls equally upon al the pauper pouation should not be n ps ported in the same manner. Jf they were nnanimnouasin their proceedings that evening, he believed the Government would be impressed with the Importance of taking some steps in the matter, and that before long they would have the setisfaction of seeing that this tax, so obnoxious in ita Present mode of assssment, would be putun a more equitable footing. Mr. Alderman :Eagleton mov 0the asresolution, "That the present law, by which each paris or smaller distrit is charged with the relief and maintonance of the poor residing within its limits, operates injuriously and unfairly to a large portion of the maetropolis, by throwing an undue proportion of the burden on, parishes inhabited by the poor and labouring classes, and therefore the less able to bear the charge, and exempting from all buat as nomainal charge those Parishea which from their wealth are best able to support it." MEr. J. D). Powells seconded the resolution, wrhichi waa carried acem. con. The Rev. Mr. Chase, rector of St. Ann, Blackfriars, then mnoved, "1That these laws, besides being injurious to the ratepayer, are injutrious to the beat interests of the poor, for while theY are compelled to reside in the poorer districts, at a distance from their employment and at an extra. vagant rent, they are also induced to herd together in a monner alike destructive of life and morality, and entirely subversive of those babits of decency so essential to domestic comfort andl the well-being of the community." Thtis resolution was aecended by Mr. M'Lauchian, and also carried. A further resolution inx favour of an equalizaition of the rate throughout the metropolis and a petition to Parliament in furtherance thereof were then adopted, and the proceedings terminated.

tONDOD, FRDAY, MAY 8, 18F7. In the House of Lords last night, The Address in reply to Hsa JESmn's Message was moved by the Marquis of Towxsn-nD and thLe Earl of PopRTsmiuT in the usual terms. The Earl of MALESBJRY, after regretting the absence of the Earl of DBPBy, and expressing his hope that thore would be no diffei ence of opinion among their Lordships on the subject of the Address, went on to remark on the scantinew of the list of measures which the Govern. ment proposed to introduce during the present short session. With regard to the other heads of that Speech, all their Lordships must rejoice to hear that the peace of Europe was notlikely to be disturbed,-that the stipulations of the Treaty of Paris had been carried out, and that the negotiations on the Neuchbtel affair were likely soon to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. With regard to the peace concluded with Persia, he hoped the Government would shortly inform the House that hostilities between the force under Sir JAMExS OuThAD and the Persian army had been stopped. As for the Chinese war-the most important subject of all-all he would say was, that those 'who had acted with him on that side of the House had been influenced solelyby a sense of duty ; and though they had been accused by Lord PALxtmnSox of willingness to accept the degradation of the British fnag for the sake of office, he would simply declare that such a charge was at once absurd and unworthy of the great reputation of the man who made it. With regard to the estimates, he hoped they would be framed with a due regard to economy, for in the present position of the country it could not afford to throwaway a shilling. lordGRsAvN stated that a telegraphic message hadIbeen just received to the effect that Sir JAarrs OUThA had been made aware on the 5th of April of the conclusion of peace between Persia and England. There need not, therefore, be any further fear of renewed hostilities in that quarter. He was glad to hear the observations of Lord MALM]SBURY with regard to the propriety of a unanimous Address, but he could not admit that the expressions of Lord PATzmRsroN, who had been violently attacked by Lord DERBy, bore the construction put upon them by Lord MAIS.uRY. However, he did not wish to disturb the harmony of the House by mnatters of personal dispute, and therefore would only, after the courteous manner in which Lord MArm auy had requested the House to adopt the Address, ak their Lordships to concur in that Address, and to preent it unanimously to Hn MAJSTY. The Mrquis of CwuwntcAunn was anxious not to disturb the unanimity of their Lordships, but could not help drawing the attention of Lord Panmure to the attacks which had been made on the General chosen to command the China expedition. He thought that there ought to. be some explaz. tion on thi subject, and he hoped that the Government would support the General whom they had selected from anonymous attacks made behindi his back, as in any other case theserviceof the country would be regarded as dangerous, and not an object of honourable amebition. Lord PsAwunn waa glad of the opportunity afforded him by Lord CAxRIcArDu. He had no hesitation in aying that the authors of those attacks on General AsuRNrA-refiecting as they did on what was most dear to a British soldier, his personal courage-were utterly unfit to bear the QuErN's commnssion, and to associate with their companions in the service. He trusted that General ASMrusNHai, who had behaved with great gallantry who had simply obeyed orders at Sobraon, and who had been rewarded by being made an Aidede-Camp to HER TATJESTy, would treat these attacks and their authors with the contempt they deserved. Lord GB agreed that a stop should be put to the pernicious practice of attacks by junior officers on their superiors. Re also agreed in thinking that the Address ought to be presented unanimously to Hnt MAsTrY, but he wished to remark that, as discussion must take place on the policy of the Persian war, it wag desirable that the papers connected with that war should be laid before the House as speedily as possible. Again, with regard to China, it was absolutely necessary that some definite information as to the real object of the expedition recently sent to that empire should be afforded to the Eouse. At present all it know was, that some vague extension of commerce and new facilities of trade were promised as the result of the exsedition. With regard to the opinion expressed by a minority of that Rouse as to the policy pursued by the British officials in China, he quite agreed with Lord MsX=nanii m thinking that those who voted against the Government had a right to complain that their motives had beenmisrepresented, and it appeared to him that a heavyresponsibilityreeted with those who thus vilified their political opponents and stirred up the angry feelings of the nation against the Chinese. Re concluded by some observations in defence of the Chinese and on the bad example which as Christians we set them, and sat down after reiterating his demand for further information. After some observations from Lord ALnrssRTX, the Address was agreed to. Lord REDESDAIE was relected Chairman of Committeee, and the usual standing orders were agreed to. Their Lordships then adjourned. In the ouome of Commons the Address was moved by Mr. DODSON, who, in a promising maiden speech, paased in review the leading topics of the Speech of the Royal Commissioners, observing that the present House of Commons possessed peculiar advantages for carrying out measures of improvement, in the absence of any antagonistic array of interests against interests or of cases against classes. The motion was seconded by Mr. BucrANu, who dwelt at some length upon the Chinese question. General ToMrpsoN protested against all he had heard on the subject of the Chinese question. Coinciding with the majority of the defunct Rouse upon this question, he did not intend, he said, to let it pass without bringing it before the inquest of the country. Lord R. GBosvZNon thought that, upon the present occasion, this question might be left in abeyance, but that some notice should be taken of the wishes of their constituents on the subjects of the extension of the suffage, certain practices at elections, and church-rates. With reference to the last-named subject, if the Government did not intend to legislate, he wras prepared to propose a Bill. Another sabject of paramount importance, he observed, was the equalization of poor-rates. After a few words from Mr. EWART on the ubjct of a Minister of Justice Lord PAxZsToN said, upon that subject, the Government had under consideration the best meas of accomplishing the object of a department of justice; and, with respect to the reform of the representation, he thought it would be highly inexpedient for the House to enter upon so large a subjeot during the present short session; but the Government quite admitted that it would be their duty during the interval between this and. the next sesion to take the subject into their fullest and most deliberate consideration, and were confident that at the beginning of the ensuig sesion they would be able to propose to Parliament a measure calculated to correct the defects of the present Reform Act. If the Rouse had confidence in the Government, it should exercise forbearance; if not, it was better to say so. As to church-rates, the subject was fuU of practical difficulty, but it was also under the consideration of the Government, and he hoped they would be able to frame a measure that would be satisfactory. Mr. ROMUox, accepting the statement of Lord PArLSTON as a ditinct pledge upon the subject of a Reform Bill, said, he should not interfere with his efforts to remedy the admitted defects and anomalies of the existing Act. The motion was then agreed to nem. con., and the House adjourned at a quarter past 6 o'clock.
The question between us and Lord PANmuua, -which was almost the only subject of debate last night, is exceedinglysimple. LordPrNunr demands for his patronage immunity from all but the most formal and official remarks; he claims a freedom of choice secure from ell public criticism. No doubt, there is much to be said for such a pretension. We -are sufficiently alive to the advantages of an irresponsible military administration such as that which obtains more or less under what are called the great Military Powers. But there is all the difference in the world between the case of those Powers and our own. There is no such thing as patronage, in the pleasant, kindly, domestic, gentlemanly, free-and-easy English, L-ish, and Scotch sense of the word, in either Ruasia, for example, or France. There is little or no military nepotism in those countries, no irresistible influence of charming ladies, no social interchange of official kindnesses, or family messages whispered under cover of public despatches. Under the stern reign of a military despotism the cadets of the most illustrious houses give way to the claims of the modest soldier of fortune, from whatever class-nay, whatever country, he may present himself. In such a state of things the Press can have no occupation, except possibly to institute now and then a purely scientific comparison between the tactics or genius of this soldier and that. In England all is different. Here, besides HEi MAJESTY and her Court-models of domestic life, and shedding a virtuous influence over the land,-we have the most powerful aristocracy in the world, and within it an oligarchy of a few families which has kept the chief offices of the Government in its hands for nearly two centuries. We do not quarrel |with this; we only mention it just to remind our readers that this is not a case for absolute irresponsibility. There must be a check somewhere. It is not provided, however, in the exigencies of a despotism, in the one -will and one mind of a diotator. It is but slightly supplied by Parliamentary interference or legal complaints before regalar tribunals. It is provided, as it can only be provided in a free State and a mixed constitution like ours, by the voice of public opinion; and at this time of day it is scarcely necessary to show that this is maintained by the Press. When, then, a Minister gets up in Parliament and protests against all criticism on his patronage; when he pretends to deny the right of an officer to publish the conteats of his own notebook, if they tend in any degree to the prejudice of another; when, in addition to all this, we have military and naval officers getting up to express their utter contempt for the opinions of civilians; and when, lastly, the House of Lords is only too happy to contribute its cheers to the sacred cause of official irresponsibility, we can only reply that all these gentlemen, Ministers, Generals, Admirals, and Peers, forget where they are. Were they in Russia or in France-that is, if they could exist there-they would at least be acting quite in character with the institutions of the country; but they are not acting in character with the institutions and genius of England. The ground taken by Lord PBiXr is so broad, and he so utterly protests against all criticism, that it might seem almost superfluous in his case to answer particular charges or condescend to details. However, he has not thought it superfluous. No objection, he says, was raised to his late choice while General AsiunIAXTB remained in this country. It is true. We must confess default. But it was not ours alone. Everybody was aking, "Who is General AsEmuasr.A T What has he "done 1 There was no one to answer. The single line in the " List of Services " in the Army List told very little. It was invidious to say anything against a man of whom nothing was known either for or against him. People did, indeed, ask how it was that when some scores of British officers of sufficient rank had just acquired experience and distinction in a Russian war, they were all passed over for a man whose laat services were no more recent than 1846. What General had we got from the Crimea, which was to teach us so much and provide us with so many proved soldiers? So it was, however. Lord PAz,rAus did elude criticism for a time by falling back to the ante-Crimean period of our military annals. We had been prepared to defend the claims of General PmvxFrATrm, and to this day we see no good reason why he was not appointed. But it was said that his health or strength was no longer equal to the task, and that gave a colour to the new choice. However, by the time General AsnBherfrom was actually embarking we began to hear from bis Indian contemporaries-others than those who have incurred Lord PrANsues indignation by going into print-the most positive testimony that General A sHBummAm, though what is commonly called a good officer, is not a man of that dash, that self-reliance and enterprise, necessary for the leader of a comparatively small force that has to act upon an immense population. These testimonies we thought it better for a time not to publish. When, however, it reached us as a matter of news that at Malta General AsnBnuuAsr had been too unwell to attend at a parade given in his honour, the omen-for such we described itcorroborated our previou misgivings, and we expressed ourselves in a way which, as Lord P&wmunn says, elicited numerous letters on the subject. Though from unexpected quarters, and from men of great authority, they agreed with what we had heard, and we had no choice but to publish them. The SECUETARY for WAn is, no doubt, a great authority in military affairs; but, in our humble opinion, he has not quite mastered or accurately remembered the letter he so freely condem4; npr does he state military usage quite as we haft b'n accustomed to hear it stated. His remarks ujBn Ae letter of " M. L." auppose throughout that Gen#al AsnnBrunA on the occasion descried had nothing tc set against his orders but the opinions which either he might hinmself form on the circumstances, or another Brigadiermight expresato him. Even in such a case circumstances may so evidently have changed or newly shown themselves since the receipt of the original orders as to justify a departure from them, or rather a new interpretation of them.; and none have shown how this may be done so much as our greatest Generals, including WzraNGTow himself. In the particular case instanced by Lord PANmuRE the original order was evidently paradowical, and therefore emphatically exwresed. It ought, therefore, to have been obeyed. Bnt in the present inance there was some- thing more than a question between orders frora, head-quarters and a private opinion. According to "M. L.," whose competency as to facts Lord PANmvRz (does not venture to dispute, there was an actual and evident incompatibility between the orders given to the other Brigadiers and those which General ASHBUMMIAS supposed himself to have received. They, havmg the bulk of the Artillery under their comman4, were ordered to throw up a battery and open fire at daybreak. They could not do this without possession of the spot which the General alleged he had orders to take no earlier than 4 o'clock,which would not leave time for the construction of the battery. Here, then, was a conflict of orders, and there were several authorities for one construction of them, and General AsnHBnm&sH's single one for the other, which certainly had neither reason nor the result on its side. But " M. L." further aleges that the Commander-in-Chief expressed great impatience at the delay, and vented his indignation in no measured terms, both in rtthe hearing of the whole Staff, and, it was probable, to General AsHBuRwHAx himself. Nor does this rest on his unsupported asertion, or on any private assertion. It came out in the despatches, in which Sir H. GOIuOH himself says, "It was directed that this "(the taking of the Maichan) should be done "during the night of the 9th, but the execution "of this part of the plan was deferred, owinog to misconceptions and casual circumstances, until "near daybreak." Lord PmBrRE has wholly forgotten this extract, as well as all the particular facts of the case. He has confined himself to what we must call a wchoolboy's theme on the duty of military subordination, as if there was no such thing as change of circumstances, no such thing as discretion left to Brigadiers or Generals of Division. So soon has Lord PA.JusRE forgotten the tremendous error committed in the late war by a too literal obedience to an order brought with hot haste and written only twenty minutes before, and at the distance of a short mile. Indeed, his Lordship's remarks are so little addressed to the facts of the case that they leave " M. L.'s" letter just as they found it. We are obliged to him, as also to Lords CLAINRICARDE and GBEy, for the homilies they have read us on the duties of journalists. This is a point on which long practice has led us to believe ourselves very fairly inforfmcd, though liable to errors. Should England ever see the day when appointments are invariably made on perfectly public principles, that will probably put an end to criticism more effectually than any of the advice, or any one of the authorities, arrayed against us last night. But that day is not likelv, to come while the patron of the imraortda "Dowi" still holds office.
Convocaton meets to-day. We wil reeoomenc one subject to its notice. Convocation ix understood now to be anxious to show the world that it is a practital body. Well, this is a practical *ubject; it is not a difficult subject. The subject is that of Curates' salaries, and the view to be taken is the very simple and straightforward one that the law of the laud should be honestly enforced on this subject, and not evaded. A letter which appeared in our columns this week disclosedfully as disgraceful a transaction in the clerical as any of the late exposs have in the mercantile world. We have our Banks breaking on all aides of us, from the mere natural corrosion of fraud, and we have our food adulterated behind our backs. But there is still more " rottenness in the State of Denmark,"our clergy cheat one another, and cheat the law of the land, and Bishops are standing by and conniving at these gross frauds. The very men who are charged with the guardianship of the Church, and who ought to be only too glad to be backed up by an Act of Parliament in putting down clerical rapacity, are in a conspiracy with their clergy to evade the Act. The case is this:-An incumbent who has two livings more than five miles apart is obliged by a recent Act of Parliament-and legislation has become stricter sinceto keep a resident Curate at one, and to give him 1001. a-year, besides the use of the parsonage. Well, the incumbent in the present instance gives his Curate an actual annual sum of 100I. There is the check on the bank which proves the fact. But he is abo a recipient as well as a giver, and lets as well as hies. Eo lets the use of the furniture in the parsonage, in value 601. were it to be sold by auction, to the said Curate for 101. a-year. Our correspondent declares that the Bishop of the diocess was fully aware of this transaction. But this is not all. This is one of those laws which tries to enforce itself by the machinery of a solemn declaration. The declaration is to this effect:- "I, A. B. (the Vicar), do declare that I bond jlce intend to pay, audI, C.D. (the Curate),do declare that I bond.fk intend to receive, the whole actual stipend mentioned in the foregoing nomination and statement, wiowut any deduc. tfon or resereaoion hatevm." The Vicar and Curate both sign this declaration, and the Bishop, being really privy to all the circumstances, accepts it. Our correspondent proceeds to say that this is not the only form in wnich the law is evaded. A " pianoforte," or a "mangle," or a " pony" is made the instrument for transmitting the Curate's salary back again into the Rector's pocket-this salary which the one declares he gives, and the other that he receives, " bonud "fde, without any deduction." No'w, if this kind of transtion is going on to any extent at all between Vicar and Curate in our Church, it is high time that it should be stopped. There must be some way of stopping it. Jt will be said that it is difficult to prevent evasion of the law where both parties to the transaction are determined to evade it; that the opposite interests of buyer and seler constitute the ordinary security for the enforcement of the law; but that where buyer and seller both agree in an evasion they bave the law at their mercy. There is some truth in this. Vicar and Curate can doubtless keep their secret, if they choose; but, as a matter of fact, are these secrets generally kept ? Do they not come out, sooner or later? Is not such a transaction practically known in the neighbourhood whenever it takes place ? And, if so, does it not get to the Bishop's ears by some medium or other ? Of course, it does. If there is no other reporting officer, no other vigilant informer in the service of the law, we know of one. If every other Archidiaconal eye slumbers, there is Archdeawon Gossip, who is always awake. This feathered Archdeacon is, at any rate, a good oculus epicopi, even if the shovel-hatted one is idle. Here is a preventive service ready made by nature, an Ecclesiastical Reporting Commission, which no authority of Bishop or Archbishop, Council or Synod, created, but which does its work with the efficiency of trueborn zeal, and, surprising as it may appear, without salry. This disinterested functionary, to whom it is well known the welfare of the Church is especi,afldear, is sure to give a Bishop some intellig6nce of such a transaction when it occurs. Our correspondent declares that in his case the Bishop kna-the whole affair. But if a Bishop knowiiof it-he can, at any rate, take notice of it. -H'61c-rquestion the paries. Even if they agree to lie it out and act their united part succesfully, he can, at any rate, make them very uncomfortable; he can concentrate the eyes of the whole diocem upon them, and punish them with disgrace. But they will not often do this. They will let out the fact, [and give room for authority to step in. The simple question will theu be, is such a transaction as this legal or not? If it is illegal, stop it at once. If, however evasive and really violating the law, it is technically legal, have it made illegal. Parliament will be quite ready to help you. But it is monstrous that Bishops should stand by and allow the express design of the law to be violated without either preventing the violation of it, if they can, or, if they cannot, making the slightest effort to get the power. We want honesty preached now. Trade is full of tricks, and worse than tricks; but how can the clergy preach honesty when they set the example of fraud and evasion of the law in their dealings with each other ? We say with each other, for both parties are, of course, highly to blame in such transactions. The Rector's, however, is much the worse share. He mnues the terms-the unfortunate Curate has only to submit to them, or go travelling elsewhere in search of a restingplace. It is no wonder if his conscience gives way sometimes, especially when the fact that he is brealdng the law is rather cloaked by the fact that he is no gainer, but a loser, by the act. The annals of clerical rapacity are a sad piece of our history, and for this reaon, among others,that the " respectable vice of avarice" has, after all, except in compa&atively rare cases, such poor material to feed on in that profession as compared with the great lay departments of life. A favoured Churchman here and there may amass a large fortune out of the revenues of the Church, but in the great majority of cases accumulation must be a comparatively slow process in the Church, as compared with what it is in successful commerce or successful law. The old system, indeed, gave opportunity for huge accumulations. Even times very near us exhibit a giant or tvro, whom DANTE would have lodged in his Inferno without mercy, suffocating them in pitcb, or locking them in ice. One or two Bishops even within the last ten years have been scandalously ricb. But, as a general rule, accumulation out of Church revenues alone is rather poor work. A Rector with all his efforts can only lay by his hundreds, while a successful merchant or manufacturer is laying by thousands. And what is the consequence of this ? Rectorial avarice is driven almost at the first step to meanness, to compensate for the inferiority of the field at its command. If a man with a couple of livings has set his mind on raising a capital he must " screw" his Curates. A layman may easily be avaricious without dishonesty, but a Churchman of average preferment can hardly indulge the one vice without the other; and what adds to the difficulties of the Rector as a saving man is, that he natural3 Qmpaxres on the pecuniary point with his neighbour the Squire, who has his Wpital already made. Do what he will, and pluraliat as he may be, the 5aving Rector finds his semt s a capitalist rather a slow one, if he lives n fir style and keeps up his position in society. Thows " 000 " are a long time coming. This, oteourse, makes it all the more necemsary that Curates should be protected. They are the first to auffer from the poverty of the ground, the feeblenens of the Rector's resources ax a saving man. The law does protect them, or try to do so, but the administrators of thelaw are not faithful to their trust. Let us ee something done, then, here. Let Convocation take up the subject. Iet it examine whether the existing law is enough to cope with the evil; if not, let it suggest an improvement of it. Let it put its stigMa on clerical rapacity, and stamp this wretched exhibition of Rector cheating Curate with ignominy. The honeur of the English clergy has been intrusted to the keeping of this body; let it feel its responsibility. let it show the world that honesty is thought an essential virtue for an English clergyman, and that the violation of it will receive no quarter from the body at large.
Two meetings of Parliament and two Royal Messages within three months must, of course, discompose the steadier sort of politicians. What can Mnisters promise in the month of May, what can the Opposition find to give thera battle upon, | when Law Reforms and a half-discussed Budget form the only programme which Government or public opinion has marked out for the Session ? Lord PALxERsToN meets the new House of Commons with his majority of seventy, or thereabouts. In the ordinary course of thlit his opponents would look oat for an opportunity of attack, even with the certainty of being beatenthey would not care about proving their numerical weakness if they could carry off the honours of a debate. But they have wasted their power and shown their game in the little session which has closed. We cam give them credit for not having formed any extended combinations, or united in any well-organized coalition, for in such a case we should have had something more strategical in the plan of campaig_ Naples, and Persia, and China, and financial extravagance would have been brought up, one after the other, with all the skill of a General disposing of his resources. But, as it is, the Opposition have had their say in a desultory and ineffective manner on evzrything which has turned up, or is likely to turn up during the twelvemonth. Mlr. GLADsroNE has been economical; Mr. DISRAELI, beginning at the Austrian frontier, has followed the Ministerial pO'liy aU round the globe; Lord Jom;- RussmL I has intimated his distrust of the Pnzins Liberalism, and hinted at his own capacity to satisfy the long-cherished -wishes of the nation for further Reform. So we have had it alL The Opposition chiefs have appeared each in his chosen character of deep-thinking financier, or temperate respecter of international rights, or high-minded constitutional reformer, and have asked the nation to decide between them and the ym-srxn. The answer of the nation has been unmistakeable. What, then, is left for these ardent assailants! Will they return again to the charge on the subject of Austria, or Central America; or China, or the Navy Estimates, or the Duty on Tea ? The country wiU probably think it has had enough of these themes, and the Opposition wil reluctantly confess that in too great eagerness to inflict a wound it has wasted recklessly all the arrows in its quiver. So it seemed last night, for scarcely a word was said in either House by way of objection to a Speech which certainly did not err on the side of promise. In this we think the new Parliament showed its discretion. Practical men, indeed, who know the complexity of law, the caution required in dealing with it, and the constructive power necessary for framing any Act which changes its working, will not consider the establishment of a Court of Probate and a Court of Divorce, the remodelling of the Parliamentary Oath so as to admit the Jews, together with a scheme for punishing criminal breaches of trust and purifying the commercial intercourse of the nation, too little work for a three months' Session, with some stiffly contested Estimates and a good crop of election petitions. Lot our readers call to mind any three months of Parliamentary work which their memory can furnish, and decide for themselves whether more is likely to be done by any Government between this and August, regard being had to Opposition motions, Nicaraguan difficulties, Chinese questionings and discussions, not to mention the crotchets of private members--Maynooth, the Ballot, and Tenant-right. Indeed, we shall be satisfied-we would almost say surprised-if even the little paragraph concerning Law Reform be fully realized. That Testamentary Jurisdictionx Bill is to most of us a fond reminiscence of long past years. We can almost believe that if some R, *VA. WinExL. were to sink to slumber nowr and wake some 20 years hence, the first newspaper he toolk up would contain an article declaring that the "time had really come" when the advancing spirit of the age demanded an examination into the constitution and working of the Ecclesiastical Courts. L;et us, then, not look down on this promise of Law Reform; it will, we feel sure, be found no such easy thing to accomplsh, and the INzsmxsis which waits on pride may punish those who counted on too easy a victory over the steady garrison of Doctors'-commons. The new House may not be disposed to hasten its own premature destruction, but of course such a fund of political capital as is furnished by the Reform question will not be neglected by a certain class of polticians. We shall probably have no actual full-grown Reform Bills duringw present Session, after the declaration of Lord PARxSTOo yesterday. The Ministry has resolved to devote the short period of this year which remains for legislation to the passing of practical measures which are likely to meet with no obstacle, except such as may arise from the complexity of their details and the natural inertness of the assemblies which are to sanction them. During the recess they promise to devote themselves to Parliamentary Reform. The details of their measure will be known in February, 1868, and not earlier. Lord PAnmlsrox will give no sign of his intentions, and he is wise; for, whatever might be the scope of his Reform Bill, he would be at once under a double fire. The allied but diverse hosts of the Opposition would attack him from different quarters. Government would be denounced as revolutionary by one party and retrograde by another. It would be a fine thing for the Conservatives to extort an indiscreet pledge against a large Reform by inveighing against any proposed measure, while the ultraLiberals roused their respective localities against the Mnister who held out no hope of the Ballot or the Lodging Suffrage. So Lord PAuIwrsrox will say nothing. Sufficient unto the session is the labour thereof. He says what has been done, and what it is intended to do. The Treaty of Paris has been executed, the Neuchttl business is coming to a close, the settlemeL, to the Persian difference has been completed, the redemption oE the Sound Dutes has been' cairrie into effect. On the other hand, there are 3negotia. tions reapeting Central Amnerica, aud, there is work to be done on the Chinese coast ; then t,here are tMliB get and the Law Reforms. Attend to

ABRIVAL OF THB COURT AT OSBORNE. PORTSMOUTD, MAY 7. This afternoon, at 10 minutes past 1 o'clock, a speciel .i al train, in charge of MIr. Godson, chief superintendent, an Mlr. B3eattie, chief engineer and superintendent of loco. motion of the South-Western Bailway Company, arrived in the Royal Clarence victualling establishnment, Gosport, .conveying Her Majesty, Prince Albert, the younger branches of the Royal Faruily and the Court, en route to Osborne. The Queen was saluted on entering the port by the flagships Viotory and St. Vincent, and by theBlenheim, 60, in P'ortsmoath harbour; yards manned, and ships dressed as usual. Her Majesty and the Court were a11 in mourning for the -death of the Duchess of Glocester. On alighting from the train Her Majesty was received by Rear-Admiral Superintendent Martin, Major-General Breton, Lieutenant-Governor of Portsumouth, &c.; Captain-Superintendent Dacres; Captain G. H. Seymour (flag captain); Captain the Hon. Joseph Denman, Captain Crispin. Captain A. P. E. Wilmot -*.B. - Colo,nel Forster.

For the convenient inspection of the Queen the brass gun, a present from the Sultan, which there had been somie diffi.i=ty about landing at the Clarence-yard when we last mentioned it, had been, since Sunday last, safely got across the harbour from the gun-wharf and placed in an adinirable postCtion by Mr. Davies. The gun was mounted on its handsomely. carved carriage, and was placed in the covered way from the train to the Fairy. Her Majesty was conducted to it by Rear-Admiral Martin and General Breton, and on Captain Wilmot bsing presented he said, ' I have been directed by your Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople to present this gun to your Majesty, in the name of His Imperial ifajesty the Sultan of Turkey." The Queen graciously bowed and said, " I thank you," and expressed her adiniration of the present as " very handsome,' &c., and walked round the enclosure to view its proportions several times. SUhe gun is la feet 8 inches long, 200 yeacX old, and is of 20 pounder calibre, cast at Constantinople. Besides the inscription before given (" A present from H. I. LI 8ultau Abdul Medjid to Her B. Mi Queen Victoria, 1857") the gun bears another :-" Brought to Entgland bz HM. M. S. Sphinx, Captain A. P. E. 'Wilmot, March, 1857." The former is inscribed on either side of the piece ,in Tarkish and translated), and round the muzzle are some lines from the Koran in Arabic. Her Majesty asked Captain Wilmot for the inscriptions, and the Sultan's present will now be forwarded to Windsor Castle. At half-past 1 o'clock the Fairy, under the command of Captain the Hon.

M. DE IESSEPS AND TltE SUEZ SHry CANAL.-On 'Wednesday a special meeting of the dire6tors of the Manchester Commercial Association Was-held for the purpose of 'hearing the statements of M. Ferdinand de Lesseps as to the project for a ship canal across the Isthmus of Suez, and to elicit an opinion from that influential body as to the advantages of the undertaking to the commercial interests of Enghad. Mr. J. A. Turner, M.P., the president, occupied the chair. M. de Lesseps was introduced hy Mr. C. L. lenny, -the secretary of the company, and MIr. D. A. Lange, of London, but explained that his want of fluency in the English language would compel him to make his statements througb Lr. Lange. That gentlemnan accordingly gave a brief sketsh of the enterpnse, especiaUy as to its coummercial and financial aspect. He referred to the tendency of recent improvemuents in ship building to diminish the draught of vessels, while their tonnage in proportion was increased. In supvort of his remarks he adduced the testimsonv .of several eminent engineers, especially Mr. Laird, of Birkeuh, ad, the *nost extensive ship builder in Great Britain. On this high authority Mr. Lange informed the useeint that screw vessels of 2,500 tons were now constrrcte capable of superior speed to those of former models, and drawing only 18 feet of water. It was considered that this draught would be sufficient to fulfil in the majority of cases all present requirements as to the merchant service in any part of the world. Facts took the same direction as reEarded ships of war. Formerly au 80-gun ship of 3,000 tons c8ed to draw 27 feet of water, whereAs a 50-gun frigate of 3.400 tons was now beiug constructed not to exceed 24 feet draught. The depth intended to be given to the canal-viz., 26 feet, would therefore always be suffilient, and there would be no necessity for subsequently increasifg it. With regard to the saving of distance in the case of vesselstrading with theeast the distance by the Cape to Ceylon was 14,000 miles, while by the Suez route it vvas only 7,000. The calculations of the returns of the canal had been based chiefly on the steam traffic, including vessels fitted with auxiliary screws. As the proportion of vessels emnploying steam was greatly increasing, a large margin was left for future improvement on this score in the finances of the undertaking. The Board -of Trade returns showed that in one year tho total tonnage of sailing vessels registered amounted to 4,000,000 tons, that of steamers being 300,000 tons, whereas in the same year the total tonnage of sailing vessels constructed was 130,000, and that of steamuers 4,000, showing an important advance in favour of steam vessels. As to the comparative security of the Red Sea for navigatioin, every day tended to prove that former unfavour. able notions arose from ignorance or urejudice. The Penin. aular and Oriental Steam Cormpanyhad in the commencemaent, under these misappreheissions, paid large sums for in. surances: but this was found on experience to be superflq. otus, and the amount formerly set apart for such continuencies was now distributed among the shareholdors. Several questions were then put to M. de Lesseps as to cei-tain conditions of the concession and the rate of toll to be levied by the company. The President then informed MI. de Lesseps that the b"ard considered themselves sufficiently a.- quainted with the scheme, all the explanations being moist clear and straightforward, and they would now deltierate in private. The resolution, which was received by M. de Lesseps in the course of the same day, is given below, with the letter enclosing it:- " Moved by Mr. Mu,ray Gladitone, weronded by Mlr J. Pe,d-r. an!

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. PRAN(M. (PoM OUR OWN COMMMONDEM.1 ieAmiL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 6, 6 P.3r. NO spectacle possess so rauch interest for the French of every rank, every age, and calling as a military reviewr; and at all times they love to see pass before them in aU the pride, pomp, and eircumatance of war the army of which they are so proud. When they see on certain remarkable occasions the remnant of the warriors of the first Empire, some bending under the weight of years others still robust and full of health, in the now quaint costume of the period, the witneses of the mighty victories of which Germany and Italy were the theatre, the memory of the reviews which were almost invariably held by the first Napoleon after his campaigns is vividly awakened. The reviews of the first Empire are still discussed nearly with the same interest as its great wrars. We have had some memorable spectacles of the kind during the last seven years,-those of Satory, which, if they prepared the army for the establish. ment of the Empire, may have prepared them also for the Crimea. The visits of Queen Victoria and of the King of Sardinia were marked by some of the most striking of these military spectacles. The onewhich has this day been held in honour of the Russian Grand Duke was quite as briBliant as any that preceded it. 50,000 men, comprising the d1ite of the French army, were ranged in battle array on the vast plain which extends from the Military Scbool to the Bridge of Jena. The army of the Eastern Departments, the troops of the first military division, the School of St. Cyr, and the reserved brigade of Paris were congregated on that spot. Man' had come from a distance; -from Metz the 3d Regiment of Foot Chasseurs of the Guard; from Nancy the 4th; from Compiegne, the 3d Horse Chasseurs; from Meaux the 2d Cuirassiers; from Fontainebleau the Dragoons of the Empress; from Melun the 6th Lancers; from Chartres and Chateaudun the 11th Horse Chasseurs; from Provins the 8th Lancers; and from Orleans the 17th of the Line. The whole of this large force began early to move from its various quarters, according to the distance each corps was from the Champ de Mars; and for nearly two hours the air was filled with bursts of martial music as the regiments marcbed along the quays on both banks of the Seine towards the place of rendezvous. Before halE-past 1 o'clock the whole of that fine corps d'came was on the ground in order of battle. Precisely at 2 o'clock the foremost horsemen of the Emperor's escort came in view, and as the imposing cortege issued from the Bridge of Jena on the rising ground, from which the whole was taken in at one glance, the bands struck up the Imperial air, " Partant pour la Syrie," and the eagles of every corps lowered as the Emperor, with the Grand Duke on his right and Prince Napoleon on the left, rode up the space left open to the front of the Ecole Militaire. His Majesty found the troops drawn up nearly in the following order :-The Infantry, stationed to the right of the Emperor as he rode from the bridge, were drawn up in several lines parallel to the longest side of the Champ de Mars. Each of the four divisions of the army of Paris composed a line, the four lnes, with their right resting on the Military School, having before them two more lines of the Infantry and Engineers of the Imperial Guard. The Battalion of Infantry of the School of St. Cyr was stationed near the school. To their rear were placed the Foot Guard of Paris and the Battalion of Firemen. On the other side of the Champ de Mars, parallel to the Infantry, and facing it, stood the Cavalry in seven lines, each of which comprised a brigade. The tbree lines nearest to the centre of the vast plain consisted of the Imperial Guard, and in their rear were the Dragoons, Carabineers, Cuirassiers, Hussars, and Lancers. The Artillery of the Guard and Line occupied their usual place at the bottom of the square, in the direction of the river, and to the right and left of the Bridge of Jena facing the Military School. Immediately in front, and at both wings of the building, were raised two large and handsomely-decorated stands for the accommodation of those persons,particularly ladies, who wer invited to witness the review. The Empress and her Ladies inWaiting were on the ground in an open carriage, but afterwards viewed the "march past" from the large balcony of the school. The ground was commanded by Marshal Magnan, as General-in-Chief of the First Military Division; the Imperial Guard was under the immediate orders of General Regnault de St. Jean d'Angely. The Infantry on the ground consisted of tbe following :-The First Division of the Imperial Guard, commanded by Lieutenant. General Mellinet, composed of the 1st Brigade,under the orders of General Cler, consisted of a regiment of Gendarmerie, the 1st Regiment of Grenadiers, and a regiment of Zouaves. The 2d Brigade, under the orders of General Wimpffen, was composed of the 2d and 3d Regiments of Grenadiers. The Second Division, commanded by Lieutenant-General Camou, consisting of the 1st Brigade, under the orders of General Maneque, was composed of the 1st and 2d Regiments of Voltigeurs and a battalion of Chasseurs; 2d Brigade, General Decaen, composed of the 3d and 4th Regiments of Voltigeurs. The army of Paris and the First Military Division. B3attalion of the Imperial Special Military School, commanded by General Count Monet. First Division-Lieutenant-General Forey, composed of the 1st Brigade, General Beuret, 20th and 39th of the Line, 3d Battalion of Chasseurs; 2d Brigade, General Blanchard, 50th and 97th of the Line. Second Division-LieutenantGeneralVinay ; 1st Brigade, General de Martimprey, 7th and 11th of the Line, 4th Battalion of Ohasseurs; 2d Brigade, General de la Charribre, 46th and 88th of the Line. Third Division-LieutenantGeneral Ladmirault; 1st Bngade, General de Leyritz, 10th and 35th of the Line, 7th Battalion Chasseurs; 2d Briaade, General Chaufroid, 47th and 96th of the tine. Fourth Division-Lieu. tenant-General Ulrich; 1st Brigade, General Granchamp, 17th and 66th of the Line, 1st Battalion of Chasseurs; 2d Brigade General da Bourguet, 79th and 95th of the Line; )Battalion of Firenmen of the city of Paris; Gaard of Paris. The cavalry was composed of the Imperial Gxuard, commanded by Lieutenant-General Morris; 1st Brigade, General Baron Marion, 1st and 2d Cuirassiers; 2d Brigade, GEeneral Dupuch do Feletz, Dragoons of the Empress, Lancers; 3d Brigade, General Cassaignolles; Chasseurs,. Guides. T'he Army of Paris and the 1st Military Division, commantded by LieutenantGeneral d'Allonville. Generals Dubern and NFoni commanded the two Divisions, composed of the following brigades :-lst Brigade, 1st and 2d Carabineers; 2d Brigade, 3d and 4th Cuirassiers; 3d Brigade, 8th Lancers and 1lth Chasseurs; 4th Brigade, 1st and 4th Hussars. The cavalry of the guard of Paris and the gendarmerie of the Seine. The Emperor had tiroughout the Grand Duke Constantine on his right hand and Prince Napoleon on his left; while Marshals Vaiant, Peliswier, Baraguay d'Hillters, Bosquet, Canrobert, with their respective staffs, and followed by a cloud of foreign officers, the Russians in majority, with a rare sprinkling of the scarlet uniform, rode immediately after. As thecort ge advanced, the cryof "Vive l'EmperewrP' rose from the ranks amid the music and the words of command which were heard on every side. The Emperor and the Prince, having paused for a while in front of the Military Sehool, rode along the lines. After the inspection, which lasted some time, they took their stand immediately under the central pavhlion of the btdlding, and the troops put them- selves in motion. Th' march past commenced with the Battalion of St. Cyr, followed by the troops of the Imperial Guard, Zouaves, Voltigeurs, Grenadiers, Infantry of the Line, &c. The sight of some of the flags stil displaying the bullet holes of the Crimea, and black with powder-for the greater part of the troops had served in Africa or tbe Crimea, and mauy had their breasts decorated with the Legion of Honour, the Medjidie, or the Crimean medal-particularly struck the spectators. The Cavalry were splendid; several of the regiments wore their new iniform for the first time; and the Carabineers and Cuirassiers excited general admiration. The Cavalry defiled by squadrons, at a walk, with drawn sabres. The whole was over at 4 o'clock, and by 5 the troops were in their quarters. The day was fine and far from being oppressive, as the same cold north wind still prevails. For a review, however, it was nearly all that could be desiied; the only drawback was the dust, which the slightest movement of the horses threw up in clouds. The multitudethatwas gathered on the terraces that enclose the Chmnp de Mars and on the quays could not be less than 200,000. Notwithstanding the crowd everytbing went off in order. This morning the Grand Duke walked out from the Tuileriex after breakfast dressed in plain clothes, and alone. He took a turn cu the Boulevards VUt4 12 o'clock, when he returned to the Tltezries and accompanied the Emperor to the Champ de Mars.

If Turkey iS not sooxn endowed with all the iraprovements belonging to our modern civilization, it will certainly not be for want of projects and plans submitted to the Turkish Government. Scarcely had a treaty put an end to the war, and left without occupation that horde of fortune-seekers who hover at the heels of armies, than Constantinople became their refuge; speculators out of employ flocked here from all the corners of the earth; there is no kind of enterprise of which they did not bring with them the prospectus. Banks, railways, canals, telegraphs, mining operations, agricultural schemes, all the contrivances of a most advanced state of civilization, were proposed to the Tur's. Such a variety of concessions were asked of them at once, so vivid were the colours in which each schemer painted his own design, such enormous profits would accrue from it to the country and to the promoters, according to their own showing, that the poor Turks were quite bewildered by a dream of wealth; they fancied that au El Dorado was discovered for them in their own country compared with which the goldfields of California and Australia dwindled into insignificance. All they had to do was to sit on their large divans, smoke their pipes, sip their coffee, talk civilization, and grant concessions, and they would see foreign capital flowing in miXlions into their land and enriching them faster than they could tell. There is a conmcil at the Porte called the Tanzimat, and at its head sits a certain Mehemet Kibrisli Pasha, once Ambassador in London and elsewhere, and who in his peregrinations through the world has learnt to talk largely of civilization and progress. Before this council scheme after scheme has been developed, and concession after concession granted; but, alas I more than a year has elapsed, and no millions have yet appeared, and allthese promising plans appear as distant from their realization as ever. The projectors, faU of impatience and of complaints against the interminable delays of the Turks withi negotiating here, when once they diappear whtheir firmans in their pocket are no more heard of, and, instead of returning with the capital necessary for the fulfilment of their engagements, they are not even able to raise the small proportion of it which must be deposited as a guarantee for the execution of the contract. Snch a state of things is very much to be deplored, and it is to be hoped that the Turks wrill learn from it not to listen to every one who brings to them fine words, and to grant concessions only to such parties as will show clearly that they are able to carry out what they undertake. A meeting of Greek notables is held this day at the Patriarchal Palace, in consequence of an order from the Porte to the Patriarch, requiring him to take immediate steps for consulting with his nation on the reforms in the administration of the Greek Church ordered in the late Hatti Humayoun. PIEDMONT. (FRoM OUR oWN COnBnrONDrz.) TUPIN, MAy 3. In spite of the efforts of the enemies of constitutional government, the ebullition at Genoa, which I mentioned the other day as having succeeded for a few hours in preventing the National Guard from going on duty at the Government Palace, hasa completely subsided, so far as the population is concerned; but the agitation continues unabated, and the reverend authors of the Cattolico, finding their paper too expensive, or not sufficiently popular to obtain such a universal circulation for their inflammatory articles on this occasion as they desired, have had recourse to printing flying-sheets which were either distributed gratis or posted against the walls of the town. Surely the spirit of O'Connell hovers over the town where it quitted its earthly tenement I I have heard it remarked that Genoa is the Ireland of the Sardinian Government, but that the Sardinian Governmnent, profiting by British experience, hod begun by heing just, but would, if necessary, ebd by being severe, and therefore the chances of common sense and conciliation prevailing over disaffection were increased many fold. It is devoutly to be hoped that these previsions may prove correct; and, indeed, the material prosperity of Genoa is so rapidly and evidently increasing that it seems unnatural they should not, yet there are so many counter influences that a long time must still elapse before so happy a consummation can be safely anticipated. Genoa is the tender spot where the priestly and absolutist party, under the disguise of republicanism, and acting on the unquenched spirit of municipal rivalry, seeks to wound constitutionalism and oppose the growing popularity of Piedmontese institutions throughout Italy; so that until Austrian and Sardinian rivalry in Italy has been set at rest, and the Roman Catholic clergy have renounced the hope of regaining temporal power, the Genoese are not likely to be long without a grievance of some kind or other. Turin is beginning to deck herself in gala ornaments for the annual feast of the "' Statuto," or proclamation of the constitution, which commences on Sunday next. The programme is much the same as in previous years. The ceremony begins with Divine service on Sunday morning, attended by the King and Royal family, the Ministers, senators, deputies, diplomatic body, &c.; after which there will be a deflU of the National Guard and troops of the line,the students of the universty, schools, &c., and the members of the various trade societies. In the afternoon there will be races on the Piazza d'Armi, and at night illuminations and open air concerts in town. The feast lasts two days officiay, but, practically, the crowd collected by this excuse remains more or less throughout the week to enjoy themselves. The Duchess of Rianzares, better knowns as Queen Christina of Span. who came here yesterday and is now located at Fedor's Hotel, bas arrived most appropriately to attend this festa in honour of the Constitution, although it is said her object in coming here is more of a commercial nature than to show her sympathy for the Government. She comes, it is said, to look for the concession of the Coast Railway from the French to the Modenese frontier, for which there is now a Bill before the Chamber of Deputies. A letter from Naples of the 2Tth uit. announces that the political convicts who had consented to be transported to the territory of the Argentine Republic are to sail on the 15th of the present month; at least, such is the report in the best informed quarters. It is added that neither PoSrio nor Settembrini is to form part of the first batch, which will consist of only 250 exiles, in place of 400, as originally intended. It is not expected in Naples that this measure will satisfy the English people. SWITZERLAND. The )3und of Berne publishes the text of the first instructions given to Dr. Kern.

BNVGLISH GOVERNESSES IN AMERrOA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I apprehend that much evil and disappointment mnight ensue to an estimable class of English gentlewomen were they to emigrate largely to the United States, in accordance with the well-moant advice of aPhiladelphia ady in 'he Ttmes of to-day. The ystem of education by governesses can hxrdly be said to exist on that side of thi water, being adopted only in raze instances, and by familiew who cas afford to pay for a very high order of ability aad cultivation. The modest acquairements of the great majority of English. governesses (such as would be most likely to think of e. igrating) caunot. vie with the glossy accomplishmeant taught in the fasbionable schools by professors devoting themselves solely Ao the various branches; nor-to speak frankly-do I think that the standard of female edveation in England is either so solid or so elevated as it is in at leasbh the northern portion of the Union. Am ordinary EBish governess, therefore, will not improve her prospect kwJ emigration. AN AMERICAN. RlVry U. THE ZOOLOGICAL SocTEry o?

Iwerfl article in yesterday's paper so truthfauy Oar object at the Soldiers' Daughters' Home, atVamp.. stead, is not only to save more especialy the motherlesg girl from destitation and its awful consequenceo, but to save her from over-education and its inevitable resuets. We re more concerned to train them for the kitchen, thelaundry, the dairy, the nursery, the housemaid's work,.with. a little needlework and knitting, than to lead their minds through the dificulties of the present refined education, or their fingers through the intricacy of millinery excellence. That there are many excelent industrial schools-for girls farbetterthan oar "Rome" I doube not; but m chief objectinw riting to you is to direct the attention of yoar readers to your advertisement of our "I Home." The-gentleman (Mr. J. T. Smith) wbo remits the munificent,. sum of 5001 from Melbourne, Victoria, is a warm friend to the soldier's daughter, and promises to remit very abortly. another donation to the same amount.

The report, which wasread by Mr. Watson, the- secretary, took a review of the extension of the Sunday School system. in Pazis, the United States, India, South Australia, and the West Indies. The report detailed the result of a general canvas of the metropolis made during the year, with the view of bringing into the Sunday school those who have hitberto been deatitute of religious instruction. A total-of 6,172 canssers was employed; they visited 1.675-houses and out of 240,18fi children between the ages of 3 and 18, tbey fonnd that 123,794 did attend Sunday schools; the number of children promised to be sent, was 34,901, but of this number only 13,345 had been received. The report also spoke of the resistance ofrbred to the efforts made to open the British Museum and National Gallery on Sunday afternoons, attnibuting the reject5onn the general election of several members of Parliamenk to the activo part they took in supporting this scheme fbr-seculaaizibg the Lordas-day; and, in order to pl!event a3y furthez-attempts of the kind, urged Sunday school teachws. still to, be on the alerA Duing the past year the commiXtee have been caled on to make grants of 239 lending librar'ws, the whole valued at 1,041. lws. lOd., while the schools have orl-y paid for them the sum of 4591. 6s. 7d.

goND-Z iLr.ABaBsano01TYINIELLWGBOB. I Thursday Evening. The funds opened with increased firmness this morning, but subsequently experieneed some rather violent fluctuations, owing to a measure adopted by the Bank, which seemed for a time to be greatly misapprehended. This was a refusal to continue naking advances on Government securities. Upoa its announcement it was construed s a sign that, instead of the resources of that establishment having improved, an increased pressure was apprehended, and Consols experienced an immediate fall of a-half per cent. Ultimately the grounds of the decision and its really unimportant character became better understood, and a partial rally took place. It appears that loans on stock which were made during the last shutting, and should have been paid off at the beginning of April, had been renewed from time to time, first for a fortnight, and next at intervals of seven days until the present date, and that, having at last dwindled to a comparatively smaU amount, it wa3 considered that the time had arrived for them to be closed, especially as the money-market wa, assuming a better appearance, and there was no plea for continuing exceptional aid. The parties, how.. ever, had relied upon again procuring a renewal, and insignifieant as was the total required, the sudden refusal compelled them to offer any terms for it in other quarters. At the same time, the motives of the Bank were adroitly represented in an alarming light by adverse speculators, and the entire affdir having occurred in the midst of the Consols settlement, while many purchasers were anxious to carry forward their operations to the account on the 4th of June, an unusual degree of confusion and excitement was created. Perhaps it is to be regretted that the renewal had not been declined immediately after the payment of the dividends, when, as the Bank do not hold themselves bound to make advances on stock, no one could have complained of having been taken by surprise; but the nonadoption of this course was caused, most likely, by a desire to avoid creating needless inconvenience, and in the belief that by increasing the charge, and gradually contracting the periods, ample warning would be afforded that they were not to be indefinitely continued. Under the circumstances, therefore, the only ground for complaint is that the notification was not made before the commencement of business, or that, to avert the mischief unintentionally inflicted, the loans were not continued for a few days longer, with a positive intimation that they must then be finally met. Consols for muoney, which left off last evening at 93i to i, opened at the further improvement of 9315 to 4, and continued to show great steadiness until the fact transpired of the Bank having declined the renewal of loans, when there was a faU to 92i to 93. Ultimately the market experienceda recovery, and the final prices were 93j to j for money, and 93;l to S for the 4th of June. During the period of agitation from 7 to 8 per cent, was paid in carrying over transactions to the next account. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 213; Redueed, 92 to i;New Three per Cents., 92i to i ; India Stock, 220 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, 98g to J; India-bonds, 10s. to fs. discount; and Exchequerbils (March), 4s. to is. discount; (June), Is. discount to 2s. premium. The demand in the discount-market and at the Bank to-daywas full, but not excessive. At the Bank the applications were increased by persons obtaining discount with the view of lending the proceeds to supply the wants of the Stock-Exchange. Foreign securities opened with firmness, and prices temporarily experienced an advance. Afterwards a general reaction took place, from which there was no important recovery. Tu rkish Six per Cents. for the account were negotiated at 93i, 9415, 93a, and ; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for money, at 1004; and for the account, at 100( and J. The general business comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., for account, 10(4; Buenos Ayres, 86; Chilian Six per Cents, 102; Ecuador, New Consolidated, 14; Provisional Land Warrants, 4; liew Granada, Active, 23; Mexican, 23 ; Portuguese Three per Cents., for account, 45g; and Spanish, New Deferred, 2(4. The closing quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 69f. 25c. for money and account, showing a relapse of about three-eighths per cent., caused by speculative sales consequent,probably,on the fluctuations on this side. A further sum of 70,0001. of the gold brought by the Anglesey was taken to the Bank to-day. The statement circulated yesterday regarding the proposed change in the capital of the Bank of France is believed to have been incorrect. The modification at present under the consideration of the Council of State is said to be simply for an increase of 4,200,0001., which, instead of being lent directly to the Government, is to be employed generaUy " in the service of commerce, industry, and public credit." It is still affirmed, however, that the Bank are to open a credit of 2,000,0001,, or 2,400,0001., in favour of the Treasury, upon three months' biUs. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day the choice of assignees under the estate of Colonel Waugh, late the chairman of the London and Eastern Banking Company, was perfected. On behalf of the general creditors it was stated that the principal question to be considered is the validity of the securities given to the London and Eastern Banking Company for their large advances. It was mentioned that although Colonel WA'augh is stiUl absent he will surrender to his bankruptcy. A petition was also heard to-day for winding up the London and Birmingham Iron and Hardware Company (limited), and an order was made for that purpose. This is the first case in which the Court of Bankruptcy has exercised the powers possessed under the Act of last session, called " The Joint-Stock Companies Act, 1856." Messrs. Linklater and Hackwood are the solicitors; and Mr. Edwards, the official assignee, has been appointed official liquidator. From the official translation of the last report of the Credit Mobilier Company, advertised to-day, the general public will be able to scan the course of that establshment. For bombastic incongruity the document is without parallel. It occupies the space of a moderate volume, and would require half-a-dozen volumes in reply, since each paragraph involves an outrage oln some admitted principles of economical science, which would have to be ex. plained and illustrated from their very rudiments before the faintest impression could be expected on the minds of its concoctors. The first proposition of M. Pereire and his colleagues is, that the general intelligence of the public does not constitute the best guide in the pursuit of their own interests, and, consequently, that the Credit Mobilier was required to act as a sentinel, and to initiate and support by upholding prices such selected enterprises as the beard might approve. HIis next is, that the inflation of the years preceding 1856, and the subsequent distress and pressure, alike demonstrate the services rendered by the company. In the one case in the midst of war they founded, developed, and reorganized grand undertakings, and in the other they relieved by their advances, onsuch terms asthe sufferers could, perhaps, best describe, the miseries of the speculators who had thus been enticed beyond their depth. In each transaction the company made large profits, and as a result of its experience it now enunciates that, " In industrial affairs, as in war, to know how to resist or to march forward at a proper moment is one of the first conditions of success ;" au axiom to be received with due weight by that unhappy public who for twelve months have been tempted by the facilities of the Credit Mobilier to borrow money on weak securities at enormous rates in the delusive hope of a reaction. In the midst of all the advantages conferred upon the country by the Credit Mobilier having undertaken to centralize and conduct its industrial pursuits, M. Periere, however, admits there have been some perturbations; but this is through defects of the law, which prevent the Credit Mobilier from having everything in its own hands. While the " exalte 1 wisdom" of the Emperor forbade last year the commencement of new enterprises that might add to the inflation already stimulated by the Cr6dit Mobilier, and at the same time compete with the securities of that establishment, the public, driven from one mode of speculation, turned to another, and availed themselves of the power of forming Socl6t6s en Commandite, which areexempt fromGovernment control. Thus the influence of the self-constituted "sentinel" over the finances of France was in some degree neu- tralized. Other parties wished also to aid credit and to become sentinels. In vain the Credit Mobilier urged the necessity of new laws to suppress all undertalings not its own. "Speculation had only been displaced, and found in another quarter a large outlet by which it preciDitated itself." The monopoly of the Credit Mobilier was therefore interfered with, and the directors were reluotantly compelled to limit their operations to the granting of assistance to the great companies " which form their connexion," waiting for more favourable opportunities for deluging the market with more securities. What was to become of the great companios which did not bappen to form their connexion does not appear to have been a question for consideration. As, however, the Credit Mobi,ier has made a dividend of 23 per cent. out of the results of its money-lending, probably the holders of outside securities have not fared much worse than the speculators, who, instead of at once meeting their losses, have prolonged them through being " assiAted" on these terms. While thus alikemaking gains, whether from the hopes or reverses of the public, the company still saw that its duties of sentinel also required that it should regulate the prices of the public funds. " The purchases made by us during the year 1855 to keepup the prices of the public funds" are alluded to by the directors with pride, and they add that, " faithful to the same idea of conservatism," they have steadily continued the system," remaining in the breach" at each monthly settlement to defend quotations from a fall by enabling the speculators to hold on-a selfdevotion which it is instructive to find has been rewarded by enormous profits, however fatal itlnay have proved to those for whose benefit the heroic attitude was assumed. In one single month they advanced upon Rentes nearly 4,000,0001. The directors seem to consider that one of the first among financial duties is to keep up the prices of the public funds, and they claim merit accordingly. In other countries a fall in the funds would be regarded at once as the sign and remedy of over-speculation, and would be welcomed as a salutary means of inducing investments, and thus attracting capital from the quarters where it was being recklessly employed. In Paris they have a sentinel to teach them otherwise. Proportionate aid has been accorded to the share-market, and during 'he first nine months of 1856 the: advances at each fortnightly settlement averaged 600,0001. It appears also that, notwithstanding the precautionary spirit of the company throughout' the past year, they have subscribed and issued on behalf of enterprises forming their own connexions bonds to the amount of 4,600,0001. It was in the face of sach proceedings that the directors had to struggle with a crisis to the precipitation of which they had of cou3se, in their own view, not in the slightest degree contributed. In fact, this crisis is evidently regarded by them as a cruel grievance, which has i3ost -unjustly limited their gains. It broke out, they say, at the moment when they " were using such efforts to facilitate a transition towards better times," and they attribute it to the Bank of England and the Bank of France not having sufficieitly supported public confidence. The course of the Credit Mobilier, if it had occupied the places of these institutions, would have been very different; but M. Periere does not specify the plans he would have adopted, whether consistinz of unlimited issues of paper, ultimately to assume the form of assignats, or otherwise. He and his colleagues, however, offered at the moment to buy up al the Rentes held by the Bank of France, and to subscribe by anticipation 12,000,0001. for the railway wants of 1857, and it was not the fault of the company that neither of these magnificent remedies were put in operation. With regard to the coming year the confidence of the company is undiminished. It expects a part of the concession for the Compagnie Maritime, and an extension of the southern railways, while it likewise contemplates a joint action with the Spanish Crddit Mobilier in the construction of a line from Madrid to the French frontier. An increase of the capital of the Bank of France, so that by some mysterlous means it may " extend the circulation and keep It on a par with the legitimate and serious wants which social activity and increased production incessantly claim," and an augmented issue of bonds of the Crddit Mobilier of short date and small amounts, are among the means now looked to for establishing perpetual prosperity. Thatutider this prosperity the cause of the Credit Mobilier' will be as distinguished as was that of the Bank of the United States in its most flourishing days there can be little doubt. Whether like causes will produce like effects is a atuestion for those who may presume to prognosticate its end. The Bank of the United States was cruelly destroyed by a failure in the European harvests at the very moment when it was using the most gigantic efforts " to facilitate a transition towards better times." As the Crddit Mobilier is the sentinel for all France, its vigilnee will perhaps be of a higher order. Nevertheless, its course on the first occurrence of one of those periods of political or commercial convulsion in which everybodyvwill expect itto make advancesuponeverything, and no one will buy its securities in return, cannot fail to be watched with curiosity and awe; meanwhile it may pursue its career undisturbed by the "interested and jealous criticisms" to which M. Pereire reproachfully alludes, even with liabilities of more than 4,000,0001. on deposits and bonds, and its assets of 7,000,0001. embarked in railwvay shares, obligations, and " different securities."

THE HOP DUTY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Mr. Bass, the great brewer and X.P. for Dsrby, complains in The Times of yesterday of the protection given to British-grown hopsthat the duty on forein hops exceeds that on home-grown hops by 150 per cent. Why does not Mr. Bass assist the hop-grwers m getting rid of this last rag of protection ? The .ussex hop-growers, with some few exceptions, are quite ready to give up the duty on foreign hops if the excise on En i hops is repealed. The excise on hops is so oppressive that at 'he present time there are constantly meetings being heli to memo. rialize the Chancellor of the Exchequer to postpone the payment of tbe duty. The Sussex hop-growers object to the duty, as causing hop.growing to be almost a monopoly in the hands oI a certain class, preventing in a great measure the in. crease of the plantation,l and compeling them to mortgage (if I may use the word) the coming crop to the factors to obtain money to pay the duty of the last years crop, the factors taking advantage of the groers by compelling them to sell, buying the hops themselves, and reselling at a profit. If Mr. Bess will support the repeal of the duties on hops he wll be supported by som ue of the M.'s of East Sussex. The duty on hops hag ruined more farmers than anything I shal feel very mauch obliged if you will Insert this letter. Your obedient servant. E. BARBETT WRTEIS. loaea}, May 6.
RAILWAY AND MINING SHARES. Thursday Evening. The railway-market at the commencement ,of business exhibited a tendency to further improvea ment. This favourable feature was, however, counteracted immediately it was stated that the X ank refused to make advances on securities. Sales having then increased, there was a general decline, but later in the day a recovery took place, although not to the full extent. Quotations in some cases showed a fall of from 5s. to 15s. Indian descriptions were firm; French and other foreign shares presented heavines3; Grand Trtnk of Canada were unfavourably influenced, and closed 11 lower. No movement of consequence occurred in banking, mining, or miscellaneous securities, but quotations continue deDressed.

BOYAL BBITISH BAyK. Mr. Stapleton, M.-P., lhas addressed the following letter to the electors of Berwick-pl-ped Tweedmouth, an SpitalTw .. entle en,-While I follow the examsple of theo other candidates at the late election by isuing P an address to tbank you for your aunpOrt on that occasion, it may not be amiEs that I should taxe the opportunity of offetin mo remarks on observations which have beei nade on tSe art I took in the conduct of a joint-stock bank with whish INha the misfortune to be connected for a few mont The calamity which befellthis bank was in no sense attributable to me, but it has most unjustly been atempted to throw on me responsibility for acts done long antecedent to my connexnon with it, and for others of which I had and could have no knowledge. "It is beyond doubt that I was induoed only a few months before the banwk stopped, by fraudulent representations made to me, to connect myself with it, and that I did so in the full belief that it was a prosperous undortaking managed by gentlemen of oommercial and banking experience, and enjoying the futU confidence of the propnetary. You re already aware that I never borrowed one shilling of itS money or disposed of a single share. 3y sole object in taking part. in its affairs was an honourable and umeful employment of my time. "No one denies that the stoppage of the bank was attributable to loans and advances made before I oined it, but it is eharged against me tbat I did not act with the energy and determination which the state of the concern, s now developed, required; in otber words, that I did not stop the bank at an earlier period. IIn reply to this Ir sasure you that regard for the in. terests of othera alone induoed me to continue in the bank. Had I considered my own interests solely, I should on the first appearance of danger have got nd of my shares and retire, for I need not tell you that the trifling fees to which I was entitled as a director were a matter of seondary imnortance to me, but, from consderation for others, I did not feel justified in taking any extreme course until I had an assurance from oompetent and trustworthy persons of the true position of the affairs of the bank, and until I had tried whether any means could be found of averting a catastrophe so serioug 2a a stoppage. "Acting on this view of my duty to myfellow.shareholders, I used my best endeavours, not unsuccessfully, to prevent further advances to debtors, to obtain security for money lent, to remove the manager (the chief obstacle, as I believed, to any improvement), to remove a director who had long before I joined the concern obtained advances to an unjustifiable amount, and to substitute a neow manager. Further, I wasa party to the introduction into the direction of shareholders posseased of the commercial experience in which I was deficient. I negotiated for the transfer of the business, offering to the purchaser the opportunity of investigating the affairs of the bank. I objected to any divi. dend being paid, and urged a call of 261. per share. " Overruled in the latter measure, it is said I ought to have appealed to the proprietary, or at least to have with. drawn. Had I adopted the former course the whole subsequent catastrophe would have been attributed tome, or rum would have immediately followed, and the violent close of the bank's business which ultimately took place would have been precipitated by me. If, on the other hand, I had withdrawn, I should have deserted at tho most critical moment the itrssof my fellow-shareholders. I nreferred continuing my oxertion for the shareholders, andI suffer wit them. "With the knowledge I have obtained since the stoppage of the bank, it is certain that I did not sufficiently apprecato the dangerous position in which the bank stood. I had no adequate means of ascertaining it, or the value of the securities held; my belief was that only a portion of the capital subscnbed by the shareholders had been lost, that it was a question of the shareholders' interest only, and that depositors were perfectly safe. Acting on this belief, no unprejudiced person will doubt that had I succeeded in effecting an arrangement with another bank (such as has been lately made in the case of the Easern Bank) the interests of depositors and shareholders would have been promoted in tho most effectual manner, instead of beinz aggravated by losses consesuent on a realization in bankraptcy and a wasteful expenditure in lAw roceedings. "So far as I am concerned, oth before and since the stoppage I have labonred for the interest of all concerned; and had the endeavours made by myself and some others been responded to all the debts of the bank would ere LOW have been satisfied. "A mid the anxieties and carea which these unfortunate affairs have brought upon me, it is a great satisfaction for mo to know that £ retain your confidence. "Thanking you for your support at the late election and for the continuance of your gooa opinion, " I remain, gentlemen, your faithful servant, "London, May 6. JOHN STAPLETON."
THE GREAPEST Op OUR SOCid AzzEIS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In reference to your article to-day on my letter about the St. James's Refuge and Home, I will only say that I entirely agree with you in thinking that the prevention of female demoralization would be better than the relief of it, and that one mode of preventing it would be to instruct the children in our elementary schools in the daties of house. hold servants, instead of employing nearly two-fifths of the time allotted for their instruction in qualifyig them for an ontrance into that very class of female labourers who contribute more thanany other (yet only, it must be remembered, a very little more than domestic servants themselves) to the wretched herd of prostitutes. This, however, and other collateral questions, sach as the policy of State interfereneein the matter, by prohibiting the public exhibition of prostitution and regulating the exercise of it according to the practice pursued on the continent-all questions deserving a cool and serious consideration-I purposely omitted, as not faling quite within the limits of my subject. I welcome your suggestion as I woula welcome any other that should tend to heal this great social sore. The best way to overcome an evil of this kind is to assail it from many sides at once. I remain, Sir. Your obediPnt cepi- L R. B. I fay 6. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-I have read with deep attention and sympathy the letter in Wednesday's paper of your correspondent in the pariah of St. James's, Westminster, on the subject of the noble and Christianlike efforts now being made there to grapple with the " greatest of our social evils, and I have also perused with equal interest your sensible article on the subject, in which, in my humble judgment, you point very conclusively to a fertile source whence proceeds so much of that misery now sought to be alUeviatod-namely, the absence in parish schools of any special training for youmg girls in household work to qualify them for domestie servico. In such schooLc, as usually conducted, I am aware it would be rather difficult to graft the household-work feature upon that established for ordinary school instruction, for parish schools are, as a rule, day-schools only, and the girls quit them in most cases at about 14 years of age, if not earlier-a period of their lives, in fact, when they are just ripe for the teaching of their duties as domestic servants. The irl of the tender age of 14 years, with her knowledge of sewig, reaing, writing, and ciphering, but at the same tine entirely ignorant of the duties of that state of life for which, in probability, she may be destined-domestic service-finds obtaining a situation a task of no small difficulty, and, perhaps, in despair her friends at length acept for her some indifferent employment, where the religious and good training acquired at the parish school are speedily effaced. Some 18 years ago this weak point in our parish school system engaged the serious attention of a respected inbabitant of this parish-Mr. Thomas Sloan-now no more, and before his death he lived to see established, vwith the assistance of his neighbours, the "St. Donstan's Parochial Girls' Foundation School." In this school, the funds of which are kept quite distinct, are draughted from time to time the girls from the ordinary girls' parochial school, when the have attained the age of 14. They are then boarded, lodged and provided for, as well as instructed in all the duties of household servants by a competent matron and schoolmistress, until 16 years of age. It is gratifying to add the girls of the school have obtained so good a name for competency as domestic servants that theyalways obtaingood places, andthe applications to the matron for servants from the Foundation School exceed the supply that can be afforded. These results, fortifying. as they do, so completely your own valuable suggestions as to the proper " aim at prevention" of tne evils treated of, I submit therefore to your notice, with no desire to parade unduly the doings of St. Dnnstan's, but rather that they may encourage and stimulate in other parishes the adoption of similar establishments, as valuable instruments for the prevention of one of the greatest of our social evils.

TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The Hon. Mr. Murray has made public, through your columns, a letter which he has addressed to the editor of the Quarterlk, and in which ho declares " that a mora erroneous statement of the causes which led to his brother's retiring from Teheran could scarcely have been penned by ignorance or concocted by malice" than that contained im the last number of the eviezo. If Captain Murray would take the trouble of referring to the reports of the debates in the House of Commons on the 3d and 14th of March of last year he would find that a similar statement was made on tbose occasion, and admitted, as Mr. Gladstone pointed out, by Lord Palmerston himself. The Prime Minister indeed, denied that Mr. Murray had " demanded an apolog; fromthe Shah," having onlyrequiredtht His3Maesyshould withdraw a letter whichhehadawritten tohim. Inthearticle to which C-ptain Murray bas referred this demand is termed " a virtual apology," and as such it Was naturally interpreted by the Persian Government. If, therefore, there has been any mis-statement of th3 facts connected with his brother's withdrawal from TeheranCaptain Murray mnust seek an explanation from Lord Pal, merston, whose communications to the Rouse of Commons the public is bound to accept as official and authentic, and at whose door, consequently, should lie, if at any one's, the charge of " ignorance or malice."

THE CIVIL Smtvims-There are not, in this economical age, many professions or occupations in which latour, whether mental or mechanical, can be said on the whole to be overpaid. A few make largeincomes-still fewer, perhaps, more than their skill and industry are fairly worth; but the vast majority are generally far from receiviDg even a liberal return for their toiL But of aU labourers, in whatever field, there is hardly any class se ill-p*d, as a body, as the civil servants of the Eiaglish Crown. For many years past their salaries and emoluments have been steadily cut down by the inexorable sternness of successive Chancelors of the Exchequer till they have reached so low a level that we cannot but wonder that the service still has aitractions for any men vho have the capacity for anything else, and that the cniplqoys still maintain unium paired their high professional and personal character. it is strange that any young men who feel within theei the ability to work, and the skill to work well, should consent to enter a profession in which they have so little hort of obtainingadequate remuneration for their labour. I 3might well e expected that Government, having resolved to pay so poorly, should find itself compelled to put up with service of an equally inferior description, and to enlist all tlhe hopelessly dull or incorrigibly idle who had no chance or no opening in any other line of life. That it Las not been so is no way to be attributed to any endeavour on the part of the Governrment to hold out inducements to the better disciplined or more highly endowed class of minds to devote their talents to the service of their country. From time to time the regular salaries paid to the officers of the various departments of the civil service have beea subjected to arbitrary curtailment, often turning a ver comfortable position into a very ill-paid and disagree. able one ,, at the same time that all those irregular thougk strictly legal perquisites which were paid for special services rendered were summarily abolished or greatly dimi. n,ished. We believe, however, that the great attraction of the service is the prospect it holds out of regular and nob very painful employment, seldom such as to overtax 'en's strength, and the permanency of the provision whiclaay be thus obtained. There is something, no doubt, in both these inducements; the first rendering the civil service a very pleasant profession to those who have no ambition, little love of work, and not very strong health, more especially if they can make up their minds to the prospect of never rising beyond its lower grades, and limit their aspi rations to an eventual income of 3001. or 4001. a-year , as ( the latter constituting no inconsiderable attraction to all who are more swayed by caution and timidity than by the desire for wealth and luxury, to be won by anxiety apd exertion, and held on a precarious tenure. Wbat is supposed to constitute a peculiar permanence in the incom e of a civi servant is the pension to which, after 2o years servic, le becomes entitled. The fact is, however, as is shown by a satement of ' this very hard case," publsheed in The 'mces of yesterday, that he is worse off in this respect than the banker's clerk or mnercbant's cashier -who prudently invests a smiall portine of his income in thleepur cehae of an annuity. No insurance-offliee deal ewith its customers on such hard terms as the Governmoent 0ith ita servants. The civil servant who is compelled out of bis salary of 1007. to pay a deduction of 51. under the head ot ".superannuation allowance," if he were permitted to avest the same aum in the purchase of an annuity, wonl'i irtceive a larger income from an insuranice-officethnlube does from the Government. And, in fact, of 900,0001. paid. for suprannuation allowance by those whose salaries have been subject to this deduction only 80,000, it is said. have ever been paid back to them irm pehnsions. The Exchequer hbas pocketed the remainder. Tb. cate is reindered stillbarder by the faA; that civil servants appointed before 1829, nd therefor whose salries have never been sub,ect to tais deduction, receive a higher rate of allowance on their retirement than those who have been so heavily taxed to provide it. The wbole proceeding is shabby in the extreme, and discredit. able to the richest nation in the world. England man afford to pay well for being well served, butthe cannot afford to te served ill, as she infallibly 'will he sooner or later by those who are so scurvily treated; and abe should be above the petty meannes of treating her tervnts as glop lothiers are said to treat the unhappy creature inL theeiritploy, and subject themn to these petty fines and vexations, the reources of a paltry anld peddling economy which mazy truliy be described as penny wise) and Pound fooliah_Uazha,.

lAW REPORT. CrOTR.T R PF CTAN-CERY. LLNCOLS'S-I.N, MAY 7. ee'c-P.R V. ITAWKI;E-S. (Before the LORDS JUSTICE-S of Ar'PEAL) The last innings of this complicated game of encum- I braices was played out this morning, the Lords Justices resolutely determxining that the parties thould nat be put to the torture and ruin of another term of litigation. The embrangled entanglement of the facts, accounts, and calculations of and arising out of the dispute can be likened only to a Chinese puzzle, and the endeavour to give any descrip. tion is as hopeless as would be the effort to unravel a bsll of cotton wlhioh had been submitted to the playful manipulation of a kitten. The mass of paper displayed on the tables and the number of counsel who made their appearance must have been all but appalling to such of the bystanders as were expectant litigants in the Court of Chancery. If the quarrel should eventually invade the repose of the House of Lords there is in that august assemubly at least one noble nnd learned ex-Chancellor who will revel in its intricacies and involvements, and, having done so, will, in adising the House, commence his judgment with the favourite wotds, "There is no difficulty in this case." When the minutes were at last settled, after an hour and three. quarters' discussion, Lord Justice KNIGIIT BRUcE said, it was quite impossible to overstate the obligatiou the Court, the parties, and counsel were alike under to the laborious, the prolonged, and valuable aid the Lord Justice Turner had bestowed on the preparation of the minutes, without which there seemed little hope that the litigation could have been brought to a close. Lord Justice TuiBNER briefly acknowledged the compliyment, and The -winning counsel having joined in a murmur of thankfulness, the Court of Chancery was relieved fromi its oppressive incubus. *S BANKRUPTCY.-EX PARTE DrNCAN IN RE HIADWES AND 31ACGREGOR. This was an appeal against the rejection of a proof by the Commissioner of the Liverpool District Court of Bankrup)toy against the separate estate of the bankrupt, Mr. Hadwen, for 12,7841. 17s., upon bills of exchange, drawn by Duncan and Co. on, and accepted by, Mr. Hladwen on account of consignments to the firm of Hadwen and 3Macgregor, and not then realized. The whole dispute arose npon what was the real agreement between the parties, such agreement not having been reduced to writing. The Com-,nissioner adopted one view, which the appellants contend was not justified by the whole facts to be collected from a long correspondence. The case, therefore, turned upon disputed facts, and requires no further notice than that the respondents' case was that there never was any contract for a separate liability. mr. Cairns and Mr. Ampblett appeared for the appealsMr. Bacon and AMr. W. D. Griffith for the respondent. Their LoRDsmis's were of opinion that the decision of the Commissioner was not sustainable, and that the appeal mnst be allowed, the petitioner to be permitted to prove against the separate estate, but the costs to come out of the jointestate.

This appeal froimi a decision of Mr. Commissioner Goulbourn refusing a proof tendered by Mr. Harding, the official manager of the Royal British Bank, against the estate of hlr. John Peter AL Greig, for the sum of 1,2001., being the amount of a call made upon bim in respect of 16 shares held by him in the bank, raised a most important question on the extensively used and mischievously exercised powers of the Chief Clerks to the Chancery judges in performing acts which in due course should be done by the judges themeelves. Mr. Daniel, Mr. Speed, and Mr. Aspland appeared in support of the order of the Commissioner; Mr. Bacon and *Mr. W. D. Lowis for the appellant. Their LORDSUIPS, after some discussion, ordered the case to itand peremptorily at the head of the paper on the 2d day of the next term. (LARK V. TILE ROYAL PANOPTICON OF SCIENCE A.ND ART. Mr. TERRELL and Mr. STIFFE, on opening this appeal from a decision of Vice-Chancellor lindersley, refusing an injunction toIprevent a sale, offered that the whole matter should stand over if the defendants would undertake not to sell or otherwise dispose of the personal chattels until the case could be heard. 'Ir. BAILY, Air. CIIARLEC HALL, and Mr. RAWLDESON declined to give any undertaking. Mr. Glasse and Mr. Beale appeared for the corporation. Lord Justice KENIIIT BRUCE.-Very well. We must sit here all night to hear the case, and counsel must sit with uz. Mr. TerreU must proceed. lr. TEsRRELL then began his statement of the case, ;when Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUCE said that the better plan -would be to sit as late as convenient to-day, and to resume the argument after the L'urds Justices should leave the Lord Chancellor to-morrow (this day), and then to sit on consecutively to any hour of the night, until the whole matter should be disposed of. One thing was plain,-that if the interference with the persotal chattels would involve irremediable damage, the Court, upon the commonest principles of justice, would interfere and stop the sale advertiwed for the 11th inst. This intimuation produced a long and earnest consultation among the counsel, at the end of which it was agreed that the motion should stand over until to-morrow (this day).

VICE-CEHA-NCELLORS' COURTS. 3IAY 7. PARTINGTON V. REYNOLDS. (Before Vice-ChIancel&,r Sir R. T. XI.NDERSLEY.) ims case came on upon an adjourned summons from chambers, resulting from a reference to inquire into the question of who were the next of kin of Frances Mary Shard under these circumstances. The suit was instituted in July, 1.8:G, the plaintiff being the personal representative of Isabel Cook, who claimed to be the next of kin of M1rs. Shard, who died on the 15th of May, 1819, intestate, and letters of administration were granted on the 19th of April. 1820, to George Maule, the then Solioitor for the Treasury, as the nominee of the Crown. George Maule died in November, 1831, and the defendant now fiUed his office, and under the 15th and 16th of Victoria, all estates vested in George h.aule as administrator then vested in the present defendant. Ellis Cook, of Hanover, Morris county, Urnited States, America, was alleged to he cousin german of the intestate, and at the time of her death her next of kin. A suit of " Rutherford v. Maule" was instituted in the Prerogative Court, and it was stated in that suit that Frances .Mary Shard was the lawful daughter of Robert Rutherford, of Trenton, New Jersey, United States, and Margaret his wife, and was born in 1764, and when 15 years ola came to Europe, and subsequently married William Shard; that there was no issue of that marriage. William Shard died in 1806, leaving his widow, who died as above in 1819, never having married aeain. Robert Rutherford, the father of this intestate, in 1750 married Margaret in England, where his eldesb daughter Margaret was born; Robert Rutherford and his nife died in the lifetime of the intestate, and had issue six children, Margaret, Sarah, Nancy, Frances Mary (the intestate), Webb, and Elizabeth, and they all died in the lifetlue of the intestate without issue. It was also alleged upon the iniformation of Mr. Columbus Smuith, of West Salisbury, Vermont. United States, attorney of James Cook, one of the children of Isahel Cook, that Sarah Martha Rutherford, sister of the intestate's father, in 1743 married George Davis, and died in the lifetime of the intestate, having had issue five ohildren-Margaret, who married one Butts, Thomas, James, Sarah, and Isabel, wife of Ellis Cook. Margaret Butts, Thomas Davis, Jamiies Davis, and Sarah Davis all died in the lifetine of the intestate, without issu.; bht Isabel Cook survived her cousin, the intestate, and died also intestate in 1825, at lianover, in her husband's lifetime. Ellis Cook died in 1S30 intestate, without having adibinistered to his wife's estate, but letters of adniinistration were taken out to ber on the 23d of July, 1855, by the plaintiff, Charles James Partington, for the use and benDfit of James Cook, now living at Vermont, in North America, ono of the children of Ellis Cook and Isabel, his wife. The usual administration order had been made in his Honour's chambers on the 8th of November, 1855, and an inquiry was directed as to who were the next of kin of the intestate, Frances Mary Shard, living at the time of lier death, whether any of theim were since dead, and if dead, who were their legal "personal repre sentatives?" A Mrs. Colonel Gubbins aud William ta had received 2,0001. and 4,600l., and other siinis had been paid to various persons who were considered to have made out their title to a share of the property, which canie chiefly from Mr. Shard's estate. In 1831 Miss Shard was the nearest Ilelative of the intestate, and a person calling himself John Rutherford put in a further claim "as next of kin." In another suit relative to the same matter a will bad been Eet up and 36 witnesses were examined, and the two suits came on to be heard before Sir John Nichol, wvho decided against the claims. In 1850 Mr. Columbus Smith called on Mr. Lea, in Bath, where the intestate lived and died, but this came to nothing; and seven years later the plaintiff put in his claim. The case was argued on an adjournment from chambers on the 9th of March, and other days, when an immense mass of evidence was produced. His flcnour then reserved his judgment. Sir Frederic Thesiger, Mr. Baily, and Mr. Sheffield anpeared for the plaintiff; the Attorney-General and Mr. Vicicens for the Crown. The VICE-CHAI(ELLOR now proceeded at very great lerngth to consider the whole of the evidence, and referred also in detail to the facts as given in substance above, and vhich were fully reported in The Times on the former occasion, in conclusion expressing himself as inclined to think that the relationship with the intestate for which the plaintiffcontended did really exist. At the same time it did not follow that there might not be other persons having claims - he would not, however, direct an issue, inasrituch as the witnesses were all resident in America, which would render such a course extremely inconvenient, and the Crown had Y,ot thought proper to test the evidence. The effect, therefore, was that the case went back to chambers for further inquiries. (Before Vice-Chancellor Sir J. STUART.) JONES V. WILLIAIIS. This #sas an application, adjonrned from chambers, by two of the trustees of the will ot the testator in the cause, askiDg .that one of the defendants, Catharine Jones, muight be ordered to repay to the estate certain sums which had been paid to her, and for her use, out of the rents of the estate ly her ion, who had been appointed receiver in the year Is3i. The order for this purpose did not, as is generally shecase, direct the balances to be paid into court, but =erely ordered the receiver to keep down the testator's encmmsbrances, and to produce accounts of such payments to the trustees. The tenant for life under the will, a Mr. B. -Brock Jones, after creating various encumbrances on his life estate, had hecomie insolvent in the year 1830, when a vesting order was made vesting all his property in the provisional assignee. Subsequently to this he executed a deed, h'y which he purported to mortgage his life estate to Catharne Jones,andtwo'policies nere at the same time efected na a collateral security. B. Brock Jones was one of the executors of the will as well as tenant for life and in that chr.cter lswas indebted to the estate Lor-sg whloh~ he h r eceived and not accountd for. The amount of this balance against Brock Jones was not ascertained until the certificate was made in May, 1855, i when it was found that B. B. Jones was a considerable debtor to the estate. By a decree made iu December, 1855S this debt was ordered to come oat of the moneys in thehands of the receiver before any other charge on the life estate and an oider was made that the receiver should pass his account. The result proved that the receiver had paid out of the rents the interest and premiums of his mother's security, and was a defaulter besides to the extent of more thaa 1,0001. The payments so madeto his mother were disallowed in his account, and he having shortly afterwards gone through the Insolvent Court, this apphcation was made to recover from Mrs. Catherine Jones the interest and premiums paid to her and for her benefit. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Hemming were counsel for the trustees: IMr. W. D. Lewis for an encumbrancer; and Mr. Speed for Mrs. Catherine Jones. The VScE-CHAicELLop held that the moneys, having actually been paid, could not be brought back, even if the payments were wrong on the part of the receiver, and that, considering the terms of the order appointing the receiver, the coase could not be put higher than the payment of a puisne encumbrancer out of her priority, and was not such as to call for the order asked. The application was therefore refused. (Before Vice-C7iancdlor Sir W. P. WOOD.) PINNOCK V. BAILEY. This case, wbich has been recently heard in private, was in the paper for judgment. The VIc CH"CELLOR said that, as he should not have to go through the painful circumstances of this most distrebsing case, he saw no reason why he sbould not deliver his judgment in public. The points for decision were first the construction of the limitation in the deed of covenant of 1835, and, secondly, whether that liEaitation was not Void, as being contrary to the policy of the law. The deed of covenant, after reciting that the husband was entitled to certain property in reversion, conveyed the same to trustees in trust for the wife for life during the joint lives of husband and wife, "if she should so long continue to live with him, and should not live separate and apart from him throngh any fault of her own," and, after the decease of either of them, to the survivor, or, in the event of the intended wife living separaie through any fault of her own, then to the husband. This latter provision could not be in derogation of the life interest previously given to the husband, and, being of opinion that the limitation respecting " living apart" was invalid, the limitation for the ioint lives, which was perfectly good, would take effect. 'With respect to the question as to the polioy of the law, he must say that if the limitation had provided forfeiture in case the wife committed adultery, it would not have been contrary to the policy of tbe law, for the Statute of Westminster enacted that in such a contingency the wife should lose her dower. In this case the effect of the limitation would be for the benefit of the husband, by enabling him to consent to a continued separation, and thus receive the whole ineome of the property. Such a provision was against the policy of the law, which was framed to secure the due observance of conjugal rights. He could not in substance distinguish the case from " Cartwright v. Cartwright" (3 de Gex, Mac. and Gor.), and he must hold that the wife was entitled to take as survivor, Mr. Rolt, Mr. Willeock, Mr. Daniel, Mr. Cairns, Mr. Hallett, Mr. Greene, Mr. H. P. Roche, and Mr. Deere Salmon were counsel for the several parties.
I COUIRT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, WEST1TZSTER. hrAv 7 - .... - -1- --Cu, ueJure LOra VAMPBELL and Justic"s ERiL and CRO]UPTON.) At the sitting of the Court, Lord CAMPBZLL delivered judgment in a wil case. CHOLLET V. HOFFLAN. This was an action in which the plaintiffsought to recover dama-es for the infrmgement of a patent granted to a Frenolmant named aMason for improvements in the preservation of vegetables for purposes of food. The plaintiff was the assignee of the patent, and in his declaration he had alleged that the patent had been duly assigned to him. The defendant, among other pleas, pleaded, sixthly, that the said letters patent not were duly assigned as aleged. At the trial, which took place some time since before Lord Campbell at Guildhall, it was objected on the part of the defendant, that the plaintiff ought to have sbown that the assignment had been registered in the " Register of Proprietors" in the office for filing specifications in Chancery, and that, having failed to do so, he must be ncneuited. The defendant relied on the 35th section of the Patent Law Amendment Act, the 16th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 83, which " provided that, until such entry shall have been made, the grantee or grantees of the letters patent shall be deemed and taken to be the sole and exclusive proprietor or proprietors of such letters patent, and of all the licenses and privileges thereby given and granted." Lord Campbell decided that the objection was valid, and said that the plaintiff must be nonsuited; but as the plaintiff declined to be nonsuited, his Lordship directed a verdict to be entered for the defendant Subsequently a rule was granted for a new trial, when it was contended by the plaintiff that the registration of the assignment was not a condition precedent to his recovering in this action; and that, and at all events, the defendant could not be allowed to take the objection, as he had not given any notice of it along with his objections to the plaintiff's patent. The Court having taken time to consider, Lord CArIPBELL now read the judgment of the Court, holding that at the trial the verdict had been rightly directed to be entered for the defendant. The plaintff in his declaration alleged that letters patent had been granted to Masson, and that the said letters patent had been duly assigned to the plaintiff. The defendant in his sixth plea said tbat the said letters patent were not duly assigned to the plaintiff, as alleged. The meaning of the allegation that the letters patent bad been duly assigned was, that the plaintiff was the sole proprietor, and had a right to maintain an action as such. But, on reference to the 35th section of the Patent Law Amendment Act, we find that it was "provided that until such entry shall have been made, the grantee or grantees of the letters patent sball be deemed and taken to be the sole and exclusive proprietor and proprietors of such letters patent, and of all the licenses and privileges thereby given and granted." Masson, therefore, was the sole person wbo was entitled to any remedy. With respect to the other point made by the plaintiff, that the defendant was precluded from relying on the objection because he had not given specific notice of it, the Court were of opinion that the notices of objection which the defendant was bound to give were such only as affected the validity of the patent. The verdict was rightly entered for the 4efendant on the sixth plea; and the rule for a new trial must be discharged. Rule discharged. THE QUEEN V. ALLGOOD. Mr. Lusii moved for a rule calling upon T. M. Allgood, a printer at Worcester, to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against him for a libel published by him in a handbill on the 27th of March last. The application was made on the part of Mr. Alderman Sidney, who stated that in the year 1847 he was returned as M. P. for the borough of Stafford; at which election, Mr. H. W. Meteysrd, barrister-at-law, was a candidate, but did not go to the poll. At the last election, CMr Alderman Sidney was a candidate for the representation of the city of Worcester, and on the day of the nomination, the 27th of March, a most atrocious handbill was circulated in the city, of which the following was a copy:- Hlow ALDERMAN SMnNEY OTAINED nsa SPAT FOR STAFFORn r by47.

He further stated that he was informed and believed that Mr. Msteyard lived for more than three years after the said eiection. Lord UAMPBELL said great latitude was allowed at elections, but the learned counsel was entitled to a rule, Mr. Justice Esrle.-YOU go against the printer; have you inquired for the author? Mr. LusH said that but for the printer there would be no mnischief. Mr. Justice ERLE,-Well, you are enititled to a rue, Rule nisi granted. FORlSTER V. Essrsu4ER. In this case a rule had been granted, on the application ef the defendant, to set aside an award, After a long discussion yesterday, Mr. JustiC ERilE said he would look through aulthe affidavits on both sides, and give his decison thereon this moring. His Lordship now said he was of opinion that the rule ought to be discharged andein so doing expressed in.very strong termis his condemation of the conduct pursued by the defendant's attorney in delaying the arbitration and obtaining the present rule by the concealmuent of materialfacts front the Court. HEis Lordship said theruIle muust be discharged with costs. Lord CAMCPBELL. said the Court adopted the decision of Mr. Justice .Erle, and he (Lord Campbell) heartily concurrd in every word which he had said. PENNY V. TIIE SOUTH.EASTERN RAILWVAY COMPANy, In this case a rule had been granted fur a cer-tioran,- to bring up an inquislition held before the under-sheriff of Rent, 'with a view to its being quashed, as involving an excessof jurisdiction. A jury had been saLmQoned under the 68thsection of the Landis Clauses Consolidation Act, the 8th ands9ech of Victoria, chap. 18, to settle the amount of coutpensation to bo paid to the Plaintiff in respect of lanid "iniuriously affected by the execution of the works" of the company ; and in sumjming up the evidence the under-sheriff told the jury that they mLight award compensation to the plaintiff for the injure which his land had sustained by beingp overlooked, hut ulot for that. done by the vibration caused by the carriages on the linea. On the application for the rule the Court iititmatea an opinion that the direction on both points ought to have been the other way. Air. J. BROWVN now sihowedcueaMsthrl,an contended, first, that as the ,d cas agis h ue n inquisition was good upon its face the Court could not interfere, and, secondly, that the direction was right. Mr. J. WILDE, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Wooliett)I in gotof te rule, cited the case of the Itcaledona Raw v. Ogilvy" in the House of Lords. Lord CAMPBELL said he was of opinion that the rule should be made absolute. If the under-sheriffdiited the jury to include in their verdict that for which there was no right to compensation it was impossible to contend that there had not been an excess of jurisdiction. In such a cew a certiorari ouight to go. The next question was whether it was made out that there had been an excesS of jmsziadioti 'With regard to tho vibration, his Lordship said the plaintiff was entitled to recover compensation for injury arising from that cause during the construction of the works ; but it was not necessary to give an opinion on that point at present, for if in one instancetherewas an excess of damages, that was enough to induce tbe Court to grant the certiorari and set ade the inquisition. The test was, that if an action would have ain at common law for doing that which waS done, and for which compensation was claimed, then, if the act was authorized by the Railway Act, compensation might be claimed; but if anything was done for which an action would not have lain before the Railway Act, though it might be detrimental, then no compensation could be clamed. In the present case the Under-sheriff told the jury that they might give the claimant compensation for his premises being overlooked, for that no action would lie; otherwise, if a person erected a mound half-a-mile off, and Cut off the view of a wood or church, he would be liable to an action. The Under-sheriff had committed an excess of jurisdiction in sayinm that the jury might give compensation on this account; and, as the jury had found a lumping sum for the whole claim, there was clearly an excess of jurisdiction, and the Court was bound to interfere. In the case of 'The Caledonian Rdilway Company v. Ogilvy" (2, House of Lords' Cases, 229) the House of Lords had laid down thno principle on which be (Lord Campbell) rested his judgment; and, as the Lord Chancellor and Lord St. Leonard's concurredin that Judgment, the decision was of the highest The other judges expressed themselvea to the same effect. Lord CAMSPBELL added that, so faras the vibration during the construction of the works was concerned, the party was entitled to compensation, for an action might have been brought for that without the Act of ParlHament;* but it was quite clear that the claim must be limited to the injury done *-by the execution of the works authorized by the Act." It was then arranged, with a view to save expense, that as the rule for the certiorari was made absolute, the imquisition should be considered quashed. THE QUEEN V. GILES. This was a case stated for the opinion of the Court and which raised the question whether the defendant, William Giles, was liable to be convicted under a by-law made by the Mayor and Aldermen of the city of London, under the powers of the Watermen's Act (the 7th and 8th of George IV., chap. 76). The defendant was a freeman of the Watermen's Company, and plying for hire at Potter's Ferry, between the Isle of Dogs and Greenwich, as the servant of tho lessees of the ferry, and he had been convicted of a violation of the second by-law, which provided that every freeman of the Watermaen's Company working for hire any wherry, boat, or other vessel for carrying passengers on the river Thames should have a. backboard to the same, with the number of passengers licensed to be carried painted thereon. Mr. SerjeantPiGoTrcontended that the Mayor and Aldermen of London had no jurisdiction to make such a by-law; for by the 99th section of the Watermen's Act it was 'Provided and enacted that nothing in this Act contained shall extend to prejudice or affect the rights and privileges to which the owner or owners of any ferry or ferries over or across the said river Thames, within the limits of this Act, are nowentitled by law." Thelearnedserjeantcontendedthat as Potter's Ferry was a private ferry it was not within the Act; and the mere fact that the defendant was a freeman of the Watermen's Company would not give the Mayor and Aldermen a right to interfere. Besides, the by-law itself was sot applicable to private ferries. Mr. SCOTLAiD, in support of the conviction, relied on the 106th section, which " provided that the powers given by this Act to the smd Court of Mayor and Aldermen to make rules and by-laws, to be allowed as aforesaid, should extend to the regulation of the western barges, ferries and lighters, boats and lighters, boats and vessels of woodmongers and owners of laystalls, chalk-boys, gardeners, fishermen and ballastmen, and all other lighters, boats, and vessels in the said river, within the limits of this Act, although otherwise exempted from the provisions of this Act." It was quite sufficient that the defendant was a freeman of the Watermen's Company to bring him within this by-law. Lord CAPBrsELL said it was not necessary to give an opinion how far the 99th section of the Act was qualified by the 106th section; but assuming that, under the 106th Isection, power was conferred on the Mayor and Aldermen to make by-laws for the regulation of ferries, including private ferries, he was of opinion that they had not exercised that power. The by-law in question was not applicable to private ferries; nor was it enough that the defendant was a freeman of the Watermen's Company. He -was working under the authority of the lessees of the ferry, and at the ferry, at the time when he committed the supposed offence, and he was doing an act which the owner might have done himself or employed another than a freemaa to do for him. His Lordship thought the conviction ought to be quashed. The other JUDGV!S were of the same opinion. Conviction quashed. BAIL COURT. (Sittings ia Banco, ZCfore AMr. Justice COLERMGC.) IN5 RE WILLAMS, Mr. PULLLYG %pplied that the time of service of Mr. Williams under his articles of clerkship might be compated from the date of the execution of the articles, which had not been enrolled within six months of their date,as required by the Act. Mr. Justice Erle had made an order for the enrolment without the articles being stamped, but the six months had expired before he decided. The articles had since been duly stamped. Rule granted. SroM0,ms V. MOSS. This was an action to recover 1521. 3s. for work andlabour as a surveyor. There were two pleas-never indebted and a set off. The case came on for trial before Mr. Justice Ctompton at Guildhall. After the plaintiff's examination in chief the judge suggested that it was a case savouring much more of account and fitness for examination by an arbitrator than the Court, and he suggested that one of the jurymen shouldtake it, and should proceed at once with the reference, and that he would be excused from further attendance as a juryman during the then sittings. The parties agreed to this, and then one of the jurors volunteered to take the case, and all the parties and their witnesses and the juryman retired from the court. The juryman returned into court in about four hours with this certificate,-that he found the plaintiff entitled to 1521. 3s.. and that 531. 6s. was due from the defendant to the plaintiff, leaving a balance of 981. 17s. due to the plaintiDfl; A rule was afterwards obtained for setting aside the award, on the ground of gross misconduct on the part of the juror arbit-ator. Mr. WARREN, with whom was Mr. Dunbar, now showed cause against the rule; and Mr. EDVLX JAcrES and Mr. NEEDISAM were heard in support of it. Very voluminous affidavits were read or aUuded to on both sides. It was stated that they were contradictory upon almost every statement. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE said he should take the affidavits home and read them before he decided.
I COURT OF COMMION PLEAS. WVlrgTNrT\,qmvv V, -7 CORBISENT V. Pll2RTZT (Sitings in Banco, Ea8ter Termn. This case, the argument in which has partly occupied foDr days, was concluded to-day. The question raited was what was the meaning in acontract of "a bale of gambier." Mr. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Blackburn were heard in support of the rule for a new trial obtained by Mr. Serjeant Byles,with whom was Mr. Honeyman. The argument occupied nearly the whole day. The COURT took time to consider its judgment. (Sittings at Avisi -Prius, at Westminster, before Arr. Juetic WILuI.ss and a Commo Juriy.) ILUNGATE V. GALDSDEN. Mr. J. 0. Griffith was counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and Mr. Powell appeared for the defendant. The plaintiff in this case is a Custom-house agent, and this action was brought to recover from the defendant, a corn merchant, the sum of 23t., a portion of which was claimed for services rendered in searching Lloyd's register and otber papers to ascertain the corn averages in different countries, and the remainder for the half-profits obtained on the sale of some cargoes of peas and oats in which the plaintiff claimed a share. The only point of in. terest which arose during the trial of this cause, which was partly heard yesterday, was derived from the evidence of a man named King, who was called to prove the loss of certain letters alleged to have been written by the wife of the defendant during his illness to the plaintiff, and said to contain admissions of the debt. This witness, who had been an attorney, but was now "an occasional clerk" admitted, amid roars of laughter, that he was in the habit of losiDg his clients' papers; that when he quitted the coutt last night he left the papers in the present cause behind him, and did not know what had become of them until they "turned up" in the possession of the enemy this morning; that some time ago he lost a 51. note, but "by a Godsend" found it in his breast-pocket, and that durig the present year be had already lost seven latch-keys! Eventually the plaintiff's counsel consented to withdraw a juror. This was the last cause in the list for the sittings in term.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER, TnuRsDAY. WAY 8. I - OSTER V. PRITCHARD. (Sitting in Banco.) lur. bx ANcls snowveo cause against a rule to enter a suggestion under the first County Court Act to deprive the plaintiff of his costs, he bavin in an action of tresp&s against the Eiigh Bailiff of the Southwark Court recovered a sum of money by way ofdamagesunder2ol. The question was, what was the construction of the 2d section of the lAt County Court Act, 19th and 20th of Victoria? By the 139th section of the original Act it was provided that if a plaintiff in any action against an officer of a County Court id not recover 201. he should not recover any costs. This section, with many others, was repealed by the late Act, "except as to acts done under them ;" and the con. tention of the plaintiff now was, that no act under the original clause having been done by the plaintiff, and the clause having been repealed after the cause of action arose, but before the trial, the original clatuse was absolutely repealed as far as the protection of the defendant was concerned, and the plaintiff was therefore entitled k, his costs of suit. The " acts" contemplated by the saving words of the new statute must be taken to mean acts done by virtue or in pnrsuance of the clause repealed. Mir. HEANNEN, who appeared in support of the rule, was notcalled on, The COuRT being unanimously of opinion that the repealing clause ought to receive a broad, liberal, and extensive construction, and that its operation ought not to be limited in the manner contended for by the plaintiff. In this spirit the proper construction of the saving words was, that the original clause would still aff'ord protection to all those who were witbin it as it originally stood. The defendant having been sued for an act done under the original act, and the plaintiff not having recovered more than 201. damages, the defendant was entitled to the protection of the 139th section. Rule absolute accordingly. lHOBTON Y. BOTT. This was a rule to rescind an order of Mr. Justice Crowder allowing the plaintiff to administer certain interrogatories to the defendant. The action was in ejectment by the heir-at-law to recover a large estate in the poeseusion of the defendant, anud the quesftion wras ilelther, under auch a state of things, the plaintiff having been inforned by the defendants attorney that he claimed the estate under a certain settlement, the plaintiff was entitled to the inter. ro atones. Zr. PBE'cx contended that the order of the learned judge was correct in principle and on authority, as the object of the plaintiff was to obtain on oath a statement of the ground of defence, not the evidence on which that defence was to be supported. Mr. QuAnT, in support of the rile, denied the propriety of the order, which he assertedwas the first occasion onwhicl% a claimant to an estate claimed the assistance of the party in possession to oust him from the estate. Independently of this objection, it fully appeared that the plaintiff was already in possession of al that he sought for. The CoURT took time to consider. 31UNT V. TE SOUTH srrAFORDsH= REAILWAY COMPANY. Mr. HUDDLESTON moved to set aside a prohibition granted by Ar. Justice Coleridge. It appeared that one John Hunt, the brother of the plaintiff, had committed a breach of the by-laws of the railway company, but they, mistaking the plaintiff for him, summoned the plaintiff before the magistrates. When the case came on it was dis. I missed, with 81. costs, and eventually the right man was convicted. Upon this theplaintiff demanded his costs, and was assured that they would be paid by the engineer of the company. After this the company brought the question of the costs before the magistrates again, alleging some collusion between the brothers, and the result of that step waa that the adjudication as to the costs was adjourned zine d*c. The plaintiff then issued thib plaint against the company, claiming by his particulars 18. 12s. 6d. for his expenses and outlay occasioned by the false charge so preferred against him, and on an application for that purpose Mr. Justice Coleridge granted the writ, on the ground that the object of the plaint was, in truth, to recover damages for a malicious prosecution-a class of proceeding over which the County Court had no jurisdictlon. It was now urged that the plaintiff was entitled to proceed on this plaint, as it did not disclose any other cause of aot.ion than that for which it professed to be brought. Rule ni,r granted.

After lengthened discussion, which was heardin private, His HO1Ou0B considered sufficient evidence had been produced to warrant his directing the company to be wound p, and made the order accordingly. MIr. Edwards, the official assignee, will be official liqui. dator in the matter; Messrs. J. and J. H Linklater and Blackwood are the solicitors to the petition. N Rl WaILIAI PErRIE WAUGIL On His Honour taking his seat Mr. LLNXKLATL% said this was a meeting for the choice of assignees of William Petrie Waugh, who carried on business at Branksea Island under the style of the Brankras Tile and Pottery Company. The bankrupt was also connected with the London and Eastern Banking Company, of which he was a director, and to whom he was very largely indebted. There was no opposition to the choice, Mr. Hughes, of Worcester, Mr. Jay, of Regent-street, and Mr. Pearce, of Poole, Dorsetshire, being with the unanimous approval of the creditors, whose debts had been proved to the amount of about S0,000., appointed assignees. The bankrupt did not appear to-day, but, as be had the able assistance of Mr. Lawrance, he would, no doubt, learn that it was his duty to surrender to the Court and give such explanations to his creditors as might be required. The assignees desired to institute an investigation into the affairs of this estate, and especially as to the connexion of the bankrupt with the London and Eastern Banking Company, and the securities held by them, and it was therefore desirable that the bankrupt should make his appearance as soon as possible. Mfr. L&wRANCE, who appeared on behalf of the bankrupt, said the reason of his non-attendance at this meeting was that he was abroad when the bankruptcy took place, and had not since been able to return. Communications had been made to him as soon as the proceedings in bankruptcy were taken, and he was expected in this country about the end of this month or the beginning of next, when he would surrender. He (the bankrupt) was desirous of affording his creditors that facility in investigating the affairs of his estate which it was his bounden duty to do. The choice was then confirmed, and the proceedings terminated. i RE WMLLIA BROWNSWORD CHORLEY. The bankrupt was a slate merchant, of Hart-street, Bloomsbury, and Carmarthen, North Wales. Mr. CEaDLEY applied for a certificate on his behalf, which was granted asof the second class.
.SHERIrPS' COURT, May 7. DOMIE V. FURXESS-SALE OF A PrBLICHOIUSE (Beforc MIr. Under Sheriff BuRCipTLAT. ±rns was au action brought to recover damages for breach of an agreement. Defendant having suffered judgment by default the breach was admitted, and the present was a It appeared that the plaintiff purchased the lease and goodwvrill of the Blue Boar publichouse, situated in the Market-place at St. Alban's, for 350L., the lease at the time of the purchase having 17 years to run. Finding soon afterwards that physicaly he was unable to carry on the business e put it np for sale, and the present defendant eatered into an agreement to givs 32-5l. for the lease, &., and paid a deposit of 201., bat he failed to complete the bargain on the day appointed, and consequently the plaintiff again placed the matter in the hands of an auctioneer, due notice having been given to the defendant's agent. There was an allegation that the defendant did not complete the purchase on the ground of fraud, and that and other reasons combined had the effect of preventing the competi. tion at the second sale which was expected, and, as it was to go to the highest bidder absolutely the lease was knocked down to aMr. Fritzerfor701. oaly,that being the highest offer, which sum, with the valuation of stock and fixtures, made the price to the incoming tenant something over 6001. The deposit of the 201. and the 701. given at the sale reduced the sum which the defendaut agreed to give to 2351., and this aetion was brought to recover that amount, together with 'T. costs, making the total of the claim 251. The allega. tion of fraud or misrepresentation had not been foiovwed up. for no plea to that effect had been put upon the record, and when the plaintiffs attorney wrote to the defendant's attorney making the demand the reply was that the action mi ht go on, and the defendant would take the benefit of the Ins Ivent Debtors' Act, if the verdict went againsr him. The p aintiff, however, insisted on going on, as there had been an imputation of fraud against him. Mr. HAWnINS appeared for the plaintiff, aun contended upon these facts that the onlyquestion the jury had to dispose of was the amount his client was short of what the defendant had agreed to give after the second sale, and not aS to the value of the house. For the defence it was contended by Mr. HUGHEs that the verdict should be merely a nominal one, as the plaintiff had lost nothing by the breach of contract ; his lease had been sold at a public auction, and he had received the amount it had realized. The defendant had nothing to do with that; he had forfeited the 201. deposit, and, as the costs cbarged were only 161., the plaintiff was after aU actoually 41. in pocket. The learned UNDiER-SHremir told the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, if they were satisfied that after the defendant broke his agreement he acted bond Jidc and in strict good faith. The jury gave a verdict for the full amount-2511. STAIRRIE V. STUART.-THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK. This was a writ directing the Sheriff to ascertain by means of a jury the value of certain lands, tenements, &c., within his bailiwick belonging to the defendant. Mr. SbmoN appeared for the plaintiff. He said the case was one arising from the break-up of that now too celebrated institution, the Royal British Bank, in which unfortunately for himself, the defendant had been a shareholder. The plaintiff was a creditor of the bank to the amount of 1941. 15s. 2d.; and, having obtained judgment against the official manager, he proceeded against the estate of the defendant individually, he having left the country. The jury would have to say what was the value of certain interests the defendant had in property which would be spoken of by the witnesses. Mr. E. M. Hoare stated that he was a solicitor, of 22, Lincoin's-inn-fields, and was concerned for Major Stephenson, who was the owner in fee o' the house No. 19, Queensquare, Bloomsbury. Mr. Donald Stuart was the holder of the lease for the residue of the term, and paid 131. a-year proundrent. He receivd it on account of Major Stephenison, Mr. George Harris, barrister, said he was tenant of the house in qUeStion, which he held on lease from Mr. Donald Stuart, and paid 701. a-year rent, Mr. James Harvey was called, He said he was tenant of the house 22, Bloomsbury-square; but when asked of whom he held it he declined to answer. Mr. UNDER-SiEnIyR told him he was bound to answer. The witness thought he had a right to decline. Mr. UNDER-SHERIFF said the law required that the question should be answered. The witness then said he held it of Mr. Donald Stuart, and paid 120 guineas per annum for it. Mr. Edward Thomas Parris said he held the house No. 13, Albion-street, Hyde Park, of Mr. Donald Stuart, and paid 1001. a-year and insurance for it. In answer to the learned Under-Sheriff Mr. S=0N said he was not in a position to prove strictly the tenure of the two last-mentioned houses, but where it was shown that a person let a house and received the rent and paid the groundrent, it was hut a fair presumption that he was the leaseholder. The learned UbNDEn-SHERU-F thought the evidence would do as to the house in Queen-square, and a verdict in respect of that alone would be far more than sn'icient to meet this Mr. SrxoN agreed to that course. The learned UNDER-SHERIFF then told the jury that in this case the law had been made to reach the property of an unfortunate shareholder in the Royal British Bank, he being an absentee from this country. Upon the return of the writ to the Court above the plaintiff would receive its authority for the payment of the rent of the house in Queen-square to him until his demand was satisfied ; and, though the' verdict would be for a larger amount than the debt, that would not be material, as the plaintiff would not receive 3more than his claim. The jury returned a verdict. that the defendant had an interest of 400& in the house 19, Queen-square, Bloomsbury, formerly called Lamb'sBconduitrfields. rAdvertisement.1-..

GunDHALL.-Thomas Ramby and Edvward Wilson in the employ of Mr. Deputy Hicks, meat-salesman in l.ewgate-market, were charged with the ststematic robbery of their master; and James Pluckrose, a bultcher, who bad a stall in the market, was charged with receiing the property knowing it to have been stolen. The prisoners were remanded. MtRLoR.ouGH-STsmnr.-Thomas Jordan, a wvell-knowfn pickpocket, was charged wvith attempting to pick pockets in .Uegent-street. Detective Joy, 338 A, said, he wFa- in Regent-street about 9 o'clock at nmght wratching a crowd that had assembled. Be saw the prisoner attempt to pick the pockets of several persons, but before he could lay hold of him the prisoner Managed to get away. While looking aboat he suddenly Seltanandin his own pocket. He seized the hand, and found it belonged to the prisoner. The prisoner protested bis innocence. Police.constable Holmes, 50 F, knewv the prisoner to be a regular thief, and that he had been convicted at Bowstreet. Mr. BNGmHAM said, itwa rather unlucky for the prisoner be should have made such a mistake as to attempt to pick a noliceman's pocket. He should send the prisoner to hard labour for three months. " X. Y." has sent 21. 10s. for Mary Hickey. WOn SEarnSTRnr.-GrinithGriDiths nndEobertGrifflths, dairymen in Slater-street, Spitalfields, were charged on remand with a desperate outrage. Mr. Metealfe, the barrister, and MIr. Heritage, the Eolicitor, appeared for the defendants. At the first examination, a week since, each of the oomplainants had his or her head enveloped in bandages, ap. peared to suffer from pain and exhaustion, and exhibited other indications of very terrible usage. The first witness then examined was WilliamAmos, a' trimming manufacturer at Mile-end, who said,-I was at the Whitechapel County Court yesterday, when a judgment was given against me at the suit of the defendants for a business I had purchased of them, and a verdict returned for them of 1 7L lfs. The first defendant proposed to take back tho business, which I refused; but at 8 o'clock at night I went with my wife, son, and daughter to their house, and I entered into conversation with Robert, while my wife tilked to his. The womeR began wrangling, and Robert atruck me a severe blow u,pon the eye, and then another with a stick upon the head. The blow of the stick knocked me down and stunned me for a moment, and when I recovered I saw Griffith strike my daughter with a poker across the forehead and shoulder, and she bled from the first wound. I went to ask them to pay me 181. and take the business; I was very angry, and rtore Robert's coat, but'did so as I was falling. Anne Trevelyan, a married woman and daughter of the last witness, said,--I and my mother went with my father, and some words arising I heard the second defendant say to my father "I'll settle you." He had a stick in his hand, and first struck him with his fist and then with the stick on his' head. My father fell, and while he was down the first defendant struck him several timnes with a poker till he was stunned. My mother and I tried to assist him, on seeimg which Griffith struck me with the poker, and f±actured'my forehead, and I bled so much that my things were soaked with blood. When he struck me I fell, and he then struck me with his fist in the face, and three or four times again with the poker on the arm aud .-houlders. My arm dropped and gave me great pain, and I thought it was broken. I have suffered severely, and the wound in my head has bled all night, although I was attended by a surgeon at the station-house, as also were my father and brother. One of the defendants struck my brozber, who fell on the stones, and I afterwards saw him bleeding from the forehead. Joseph Amos, the son.-Robert Griffiths was holding and shaking my father, and I tried to get him away, when the first defendant felled me senseless, "like a bullock , with a blow from a poker upon the forehead. I bled very much, and on trying to rise he struck me again with a stick aud prevented me. When I did get into the street I was covered with blood, running from my head. My mother came to help me, and Griffith struck her across the arm with a stick I also had a bruise on the leg from a blow with ai stick. I have suffered all night, and still feel very giddy. Elizabeth Amos, mother of last witness.-After the wrangling the defendants went into the house, and returned, onewith a poker, and the other with a stick with a knob at one end. The first thing I recollect was my husband being on the ground, bleeding from the head, and my son also on the ground, and the first defendant striking him with a stick. I tried to get my son away, and Griffith struck me on the head, shoulders, and arm, four blows in all. My arm and head are braised, vith swellings as large as an egg. Polceman 170 H.-I was called to the defendants, and found Grffith strikine right and left with a poker, and the witnesses were all bleeding. I drew my truncheon, and threatened to knock down any one who struck another blow, and Griffith then flung down the poker I produce. I secured Robert, who wrenched himself away, next seized Griffith, whom I handed over to another officer, and both of them were ultimately secured. Mr. Meares, divisional surgeon, described the nature of t.he wounds yesterday - William Amnoi had a large saperficial wound on the rigat side of the head, as if inflicted with a the right eye, an inch and ;-half inlength, a jagged wound, the mtddle penetrating to the bone; Joseph Amos a wound an inch in length on the upper part of the forehead; and Elizabeth Amos several brmses on the left eye and left arm. Each witness he now considered out of danger, and their injuries were Progressing very favourably. Mr. Metcalfe, who closely cross-examined the several witnesses, but without shaking or altering their testimony, now advised his clents to reserve their defence; and, the depositions having been taken, both defendants were ordered to be fully committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court, 'with liberty to put in substantial bail for their fature appearance. CLERKEWMELT-ohn Dickinson, proprietor of cab 3.39S, and James AIdridge, the driver in his employ, were each snmmoned before Ir. COBRRD, at the instance of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, -the former with having caused a horse to be ill-treated and tortured, and the latter with having tortured the same horse. It appeared from the evidence of W. Love and G. Seaman, two active officers belongin to the society, that on the night of the 28th of April, at 11 o'clock, they were in Highstreet, Camden-town, where they saw the defendant Aldridge in charge of a horse and cab which were standing on the rank there, and, seeing the horse lifting one of its fore legs up and down as tbough in great pain, they proceeded to examine it, and, on removing a piece of old sacking which had been bandaged round the fetlock joint of the near foreleg, they discovered a wound three inches long and about two inches wide on the inner part of the joint; the wound was s very deep one, forming a large bole, and it appeared to be of long standing. A quantity of matter was running from it, and the bandage was saturated with the discharge. In addition to this, the horse was much bent overin both its fore legs, and both its knees were much swoDlen, and in fact the borse was totally unfit for work. The horse had since been kiled. Dickinson had been convicted four times before for cruelty. Mlr. CORRIE observed that he had not the slightest doubt but that this horse was in a very bad state. He should have sent Dickinson for a month had not the horse been kiDed. He should now fine him 2Z. and the costs, in default of p which he would be imprisoned for one month tn uar labonr. The fine and costs were paid. Archibald Hunter, 12. Lodowick-terrace, Glocester-road, Camden-town, described on the police-sheet as a gentleman, was charged with beinm drunk, creating a disturbance, and. assaulting police Farerdon, 116 S, in Clarendonsquare, St. Pancras he constable saw the defendant drunk and making a disturbance with some prostitutes, and after the cons-able had asked them to go away the defendant struck him in the chest. Ie was very violent when taken to the station-house. The magistrate fined the defendant 5s., which was paid. SoTvInwARnL-Mr. Vivian Hughes, gentleman, of 36, Bedford-place, Southwark-bridge-road, and Mr. James Wilson, gentleman, of 31, Orchard-street, Portman-square, were brought before lir. BvscEui charged with comcmitting a violent assault upon Mr. Henry Young, the treasurer of the Victoria Theatre, at the stage entrance. The complainant stated that after the performance was over on the previous night, and as he was leaving the stage with his daughter, 13 years of age, he X eived information that the prisoners were behind the scenes-a liberty not allowed to any stranger. His daughter also informed him that the pzinoner Wilson had spoken to her previously behind the scenes during the performance, calling her a charming girl, and offering to treat her to wine, &c. Wit. ness immediately returned, and near the ladies' dressingrooms he saw both prisoners lounging about. He told them that he was the treasurer of the tbeatre, and that they had no business there, at the same time requesting them to leave the theatre. They refused to do so, and said they were waiting for Ar. Rickards, one of the actors. He again told them they had no business behind the scenes, and that their conduct was highly imProper, when they both became very violent and refuse to go. Re, however, got them as far as the stage entrance, when Hughes struck him on the head with a walking-stick and the otber prisoner struck him behini with his fists. At that time a constable came up, when he gave them both into custody, The prisoner Hughes here declared that all that Mr. Young had stated was false; he never had anything to say to any of the ladies behind the scenes. Mr. Yuung said that he had no evidence that Hughes had done so, but he had no business on the stage. The orders were peremptory that no stranger should be behind the scenes. nlr. BURBCHABI asked the prisoners whether they admitted being ordered off the stage. They replied that they did, but they were actually waiting for their friend Mr. PHickards. Mr. James Hitchinson, one of the performers, said he was leaving the theatre on the previous night. when he heard Mr. Young order the prisoners off the stage. Hugbea told him to "go to hell," and then there was a scuffle. Shortly afterwards witness saw them in the page, and Hugbes invited Mr. Young out to fight. which he politely declined. Then Hughes struck him with his walk. ing-stick, and Wilson beat him behind with his fists. Witness said that he had been many years connected with the theatrical profession, and he never saw such outrageous conduct-in his life. Mr. BuBiuCnL asked whether the prisoners were intoxicated at the tima. 'Witness replied that they appeared to have beendrinking, but they wel knew what they were about. In answer toTho chargo both prisoners said that they had been in a private box and h*d n company with Mr. Rickards, one of She chief actor who had asked them on the stage to walt iq him. Wilaon declaed that lie mnade nO improper overtnuO to any of the young ladles behind the scenes, and fin hei asserted that ho had7 not anoken to,3n0 of them. TheS cth considered that they had been harshly treated. Mr. BuRCHAU.-But it appea you had no basines behind the soene WiluR it ated thai they went thaso to wit for e r. Rickards, and they would have walked quietly aray had not Mr. Young acted roughly towards them. Hnghe6 said he -was ruptured some time ago, and he reoeived such rough usage that when at the po]ice-station be was eompelled to send for medicalassistance. Mr. BUROCHa told them that it was quite clear from the evidence of Mr. Young, the treasurer of the theatre, tat they had no right behind the scenes, and that they ought to have quitted the stage when directed. Instead of that they refused, andMr. Young was justHfied in expelling them. IiE doing so they-assaulted him in a very gross manner, quite unbecoming gentlenen. Under all the circumtances he should Dne Hughes 40e and 6s. for the damage to Mr. Young's hat, and Wison 40s., crone month's imprisonment The prisoners were removed by the gaoler, and in a few minutes they paid the money, and were discharged from LA muT.-Richard Fitts, azia,r Roberte, and Bernard Gregory, alfas. ayhew, ticket-of-leave men, James Hande .and enryBrownwere finally examined beforoeMr. ELaoTr en a charge of b lariously breaking and entering the dvellmnghouse of mlr.

COURT OF COMMONT COUNOIL. Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of public business. -SIR W5LLIJAI5 MAGNAY. The Court was occupied the entire day in discussing Mr. Blake's motion caUing upon Sir William Magnay to relinq2uih the office ofLAderman on account of his conviction, in aosence, by a foreign Court, of fraud. A copy of Mr. Blake's motion, as well as of Mr. J. J. Miflard's amendment upon it, appeared in our impression of Wednes. day. As the debate was adjourned we feel it necessary, in justice to all parties, to withhold our report of the proceedimgs-till theysshall have been concluded.
TO THB EDITOR OF THE TIfES. Sir,-Your able article on one of the prevailing " social evils" reiminds me of another, the "greatest," in sy opinion, of them all-namely, that which is daily arising out of the present administration of the bastardy laws. I recollect seeingin yourcolumns some time ago a return of tbenumberof ilel;timatechidren borninthe umted kingdom in the year1852,which amounted to no less than 55,000 souls! Now these, be it remembered, are only the recorded cases of this class-that is, births registered by tho mothers themselves; and knowing, as we do, from common experience how feverishly anxious many women are to hide their shame from the world, we may easUy calculate the large number who avail theiucelves of any means, however deceptive, to avoid a public declaration of their weakness and di-grace. Large, therefore, as the numnber avowedly is, the vice is much more extensive than it appears. In a more recentt number of your paper appeared the following paragraph:- " A Parliamentary paper recently printed states that on the Last day of the last week in the quarter ending at Ladyday, 1SS4, there were 21,673 aged and inifirm women in the workhouses in England and Wales, and 13,893 ablebodied women. Of these latter 5,855 were of good cbaracter and 1,%04 of dissoluto and abandoned character, and 3,593 were mothers of illegitimate chi]dren, but were not of dissolute or abandoned habits." Now, the latter part of this statement discloses an important fact,-that there were in the workhouses of England and- Wales at the tihe mentioned no less than 3,593 poor womuen vwith illegitimate children, who, being declared not to be of dis olute or abandoned habits, were the constrained inmates of such places simply because they could not procure from the putative fathers any support or assistance for their offsprmg. I wiU assumo that these women had for the most part been in service, and were seduced for the first time under *the ordinary artifice, promise of marriage. To the pains and penalties of child hearing there are addeui in the case of these persons irretrievable disgrace, the loss of position (everytbing to themn' howover huimble), and in all probability the aiffections and interest of their own relatives, and aU this because the law is too weak to reach their betrayers. As tbese young women cannot be expected to remain in a workhouse all the days of their lives, can it be wondered at that infanticide should prevail aud that our streets should be crowded with prostitutes or that ragged schools and reformatories are full of fatherlees and destitute children brought up to beggary and tbeft? The law of 1-D1;, which, in my opinion, brought this miscbief on society, was founded on a mistaken theory,namuely, that women are the best guardians of their own honour. This is inverting the order of nature, and falsifying the common ezperience of all time. It is, in fact, splendid nonsense. The result is that the law throws upon the weakest of the two offenders all the coneequences of a vice in which she at .least could only be a participator, 'f'here was, to my mind, ,something. marvellously cowardly and-unmanly in this. The best guardian of the honour of wo:aan is he who, having ,gained her affections, h.as obtained - mastery over her Judgment, and all that makes her rowpectable in society. But tho days of chivalry are indeedpast, since men be-come seducrs by Parlia.mentary license. It is, howvever, alleged that the Legislatuc,* has provided means for securing justice to the wromun so betrayed, by allowing her to produce corroborative evidence. T.his is adding insult to injury. Why, Sir, between 300 and 400 of these -cases come under any own observation every %ear, and I can afflrm that in 9 cases out of 10 there is a total absence of any evidence whatever-and why 9 B-cauaz the men who practise these frauds are for tbe most part habitual seducers, and take aU 4lhe precautions which such Ecunindrels are li.i:y to invent. It is not an uncommon circumstance for two-er three voung women (mere girls in some instances) to he with child at one and the sauic time by one i an, and that can a married man, and vet the lawt has no resnedy for this -becanse there is no corroborative evidence. But auppose it otherwise, what is a penniless girl to do against a fellow who can afford to fee counsiel to browbeat and fribten her out of o4ort? Lst every member -of Parliament who voted for a law founded upon the Arcadian notion that every woman is the best guardian of her own honovr apply it to his own daughters, and watch the result. Whly he giv;es the lie to it every day vf his life, hisl anxious tought being how best to guard his.children froa the polluttona which surround even then. if,, t the rich practically repudiate the notion, why apply it to the ohildren of the poor, who .on leaving bonm an early rge for service are deprived of 4be restraints and checks of iindred? It will then be asked what are the remedies for sue' aevious evils? I auswer that paternal governors shouli adct the sane course- in their collective as they would is their individusl xubaracter-nainsely, to distinguish betweetl babitual profligacy aud a casuai error; to afford to thi woman who appears3 for the first time in the ebaracter of . xmother a faeility for afSfliating her child, which should be denied to her who commjis a second vf2'nce. By this means a great ond would bie accomplisbed-viz, fixing the conserinences wbere they ought to rest-on the actnal seducer of the woman. Sterne, nso nusn observer of human nature, askcd 10 .years ago,-" I there no difference between one preponsely going out of the way and continoling there by deprnvity of will, and a hapless wanderer straying hy delndson and wearily treading back her steps?' I ask the ,e.e ncsion. J mD Mr, :or gbeldint servant, J. .i.

Considerable delay took place before the start was eftected. On assembling at the post Loyola and South-Western broke away and ran to the Castle pole before they were ,topped. South-Western ran up the embankment among the people, and his rider broke his stirrup leather. After 7everal ineffectual attemp7s the flags were lowered, and Loyola jumped off with a lead of about half-a.dozen lengths, Sir Colin, Commotion, and Special License being side by side in his wake, with Cumberland, Church Langton, and Wardermarske in close attendance upon them. On passing thejiudge's obair Glede Hawk struck into South-Western and his rider, in his endeavour to keep him from falling, was unseated, and came heavily to the ground. Fortunately, Glede Hawk was lying last at the time, and Osborne was speedly removed from the course and carried into the ,stand. On entering the Dee side Commotion took second place, and soon aftberwards Sir Colin dropped back, Special Lioensegoing on third and Cumberland fourth. As they neared the T. Y. C0. post Strathnaver went up to Commotion, and here Loyola was joined by the riderless Glede Haw. On roundingthe Grosvenor-bridge tarnCommotion and ftrathnaver were at Loyola's quarters, and as they came round the bend Strathnaver took second place. Loyela here held isi lead until reaching the distance, when be was beaten, and Strathnaver took up the running, followed by Commotion and Wardermarske, Glede Hawk stil running side by fside with them. As they approached the etand Wardermareke headed Commotion, and running in with Glede Hawk, w-ho was close in his track, could not quite get up to Strathnaver, who won by half a length, Glede Hlawk passing the post Just in advance of him. Commotion was beaten two lengths mfrom the second, and Loyola three lengthsfrum Commotion. ChurchLaugtonand SouthWestern finished several lengths behind Loyola, Sir Colin was next and Cumberlaud and Speoial License were beaten off a long way; Osborne was much bruised by his fal, but not seriously injulred.

The r i5hearse contained the remains of James Hunt aud Wjll&'m Smith, who were followed by their respective relatvs, while the bodies of seven more of the unfortunate victims followed in tbree eeparate fonerals. A large number 'of persons assembled round the general grave at'Darfield, twany of whom seemed much affected while the funeral cereTnony as hein read by Messrs. Megmison and Medcalfe. _he bodies of John Frost and Thomas Logan were interred at Wath and West Melton. 'Up to Yesterday at 5 o'clock 42 bodies hadbeen recovered, and since that time up to this afternoon seven more have been brought out, making a total of 49, or about one.foarth of the number killed. Two who were brought ont a little after 6 o'clock last evening were found in the second board in the south level. end identified as Joseph Smith, of LundhiDl, aged 53, and his son, John Smith, aged 19. Between 8 and 9 o'clock the men employed in the relay of which yr. Webster had the superintendence found three more bodies, but they were in such a state as to wholly defy recognition. They were found in tla second boardgate on the south side, where the blast seemed to have been of the most terrific character-more so, it was thought, than in any other part of the pit. The brattice boards and sheeting were blown to atoms and scattered in every direction; and this iiu some way accounted for these bodies being so much mutilated. They were, however, believed, judging from the working places in which they were found, and frorn their general ap,cearance, to be those of George Shepherd, of Lndhill, aged 29;i James Wilkinson, of Wigan, aged 22, and that of a homer. About midnight a body which was identified as that of James Tattersa, of West Melton, aged 19, was discovered in the first boardgate on the south side; and this morning, a little after 8 o'olock, another corpse, which proved to be that of Samuel Parkinson, of Wombwell, aged 21, was brought out. The latter was identified by means of a silver snuffbox which was found in his pocket. One of the bodies which had been interred without being identified was yesterday found to be that of John Halliday, of Lundhill, aged 29, it having been identified by the boots which had been kept in the shed and about which there were some peculiar marks. The volunteers, many of whom have relatives in the pit, are working with unflagging energy, although the work is of a most hazardous nature and the effluvium from the numerous corpses entombed is offensive in the extreme. Great credit is due to Sergeant Merrick and Policeconstable Latham, to whom are entrusted the unpleasant task of showing the bodies, for the manner in which they have discharged the painful duty devolving upon them-a doty not altogether free f'rom danger considering the aifluvium arising from the bodies, close to which they are Iconstantly stationed.

SALMfOZ FISHEBIES OF ENGLAND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Having read with much interest the letters of Messrs. Esdaile, Ayrton, and Benthall on the above subject, I beg leave to remark to those gentlemen that the salmon fisheries of Ireland were a few years ago in a worse condition than those of England are at present, when Mr. William Fennell, Commissioner of Irish Fisheries (Customheuse, Dublin), introduced into Parhament Bills for the regulation of the Irish fisheries, and, aided by a few friends in both Houses of Parliament, they became law. In consequence the improvement in the Irish salmon fisheries has been most extraordinary, and I have no doubt that if Mr. Fennell obtained permission from the Government to draw up a code of laws for the English rivers the suecess would be equally great. Your obedient servant, UIENGALL
CsTy MissToN..-The annual meeting of this society was held yesterday in Exeter-hall, hlr. J. P. Plumtre in the chair. The report, read by the secretary, announced an increase of 19 in the number of its missioaaries, making the entire number 339 now labouring in the uretropolia. Tho new miissionaries included one to the Gipsies, another to the night coffee and refreshment shops, and a third to the Orientals in London. The renort stated that there had been a decrease in the society's funds, as com. pared vsth last year, amounting to 1,7041., the entire receipts being 30,69:V., besides 2691. for the disabled mis. sionaries' fund. The decrease was accounted for by the receipts of one or two former years having been swollen by large legacies and other unusuaL items. The receipts for the past year included 4,491L from 300 associations in the provinces. The missionsries had paid 1,528,162 visits during the year, the largest number yet recorded - 117,443 of these having been to the sick and dyiog. Ttey had free access to a large proportion of tha Jewish, Roman Catholic, and infidel families among the ,rorking classes in their various districts; and they had let 851 persons to become communicants at different Protestant plsce of worship. They bad held a large number of opeu .* meetings, and had established libraries, concerts for th , people, penny bstks, lectures, and other agencies to pro. mote the moral and religious culture of the poor. By their means a large number of Bibles and tracts had been distri. buted; 1l,ZtW cusldrea hsd been sent so school, and 68) fallen females restored to paths of virtue. The adoption of the report was moved by Lord Charlts Riussell, seconded by the Huin. and Rev. Baptist Noel, and unanimously agreed to. Other addresses were delivered by Mr. T.
