TQR LATE AMCiDEYi INf TO1TTAXHMI COURT-ROAD. The following is the report made by Mr. Nelson to the deputy-coroner for the western division of the county of Addlesdex, and read at the inquest, which concluded yeaterday - "6, Whitehall, June 3. "Sir,-Accordlng to your instrucions that I should report upon the accident to the houses Nos. 146, 147, and 1IT, To'taenhum.court-road, I beg to state that I have surve3 ed the site and met the builders and architects engaged upon the works, as well as the district surveyor and the surveyors to the Police Commissioners. Upon an examination of the ruins in the presence of these gentlemen there was no difference of opinion upon the state of the houses before the accident or upon the work done in making the alterations that were in progress at the time of the acci. dent. "The alterations were commenced in April last, and the works placed under the superintendence of surveyors bg the respetive owners, Mr. Maples and Mr. Hunter, Mr. Maples being the owner of 146 and 147, and Lr. Hunter of 148. "Thesurveyors prepared draings and specifications to obtain estimates from builders, and in both instances the works were required to be done in the best manner with the best materials. The builders were also required to make good all damage done to the Premises, or those adioining duringthe progress of the works, and in Mr. Mapaes' case the builder was placed in direct communication with the district surveyor by requiring him to pay the district surveyor's fees and to give the requisite notices under the Building Act and, although such a condition is not in the specification tor the works to be Performed for Mr. Hunter, it is admitted by the builder that a stipulation to that effect was made previous to the opening of the tenders, and he (the builder) gave the notice and placed himself in communication with the district surveyor, and considered him. self liable to pay the fees. "On the part of the owners there appears to have been no desire to have the work done in au inferior or cheap manner. Mr. Taylor, the builder employed b pr. MapIe was selected to do the vrork on account of his being a careful builder, and the estimate he gave for the work was accepted withouti alteration. "Mr. Hunter submit'ed his specification and drawings to four builders, and Mr. Johnson's tender, being the lowest, was accepted. Both builders, after their estimates had been accepted, placed themselves in communication with the district surveyor, and Eo far as regards Mr. Taylor (Mr. Maples' builder), he appears to have followed the district surveyor's directions, and the only point of dlfference between them-viz., with reference to the cutting away of the back chimney-breast-was eventually sanctioned under cer. tain conditions, which the builder agreed to comply with, and Lhis workmen were engaged in strengthening the wall under or near the chimney-breast when the accident occurred. *' The difference that arose between Mr. Hunter's builder and the district surveyor was also with reference to the cutting away of a chimney breast in the opposite party walL It was removed by the builder without the sanction of the district surveyor, but afterwards it was not objected to by the poLce surveyor, and with a view of remedying the injury done to the wall, by the removal of this breast, the builder, as he contends, with the sanction of the district surveyor, but which the district surveyor denies, commenced removing part of the wal on the ground floor (or ' underpinning,' as it is technicaUy termed) on the morning on which the accident took place. " The works previously done to this house (Mr. Hunter's) in rebuilding the front wall were not objected to by the district surveyor. " At the time of the accident taking place the following is a brief description of the state of the houses AtNo. 146 no works were in progress. It was connected on the ground floor with Mr. Maples' adjoining house, No. 147, by an opening in the party walL At No. 147 the bressummer supporting the front waU had been taken out, and a new bressuminerhadbeenputinto carry the front waU at a higher leveL An opening in the north party-wall had been increased in height, and an iron girder and stanchion had been refixed at the increased height. The old one-pair floor had been taken out, and a new floor, supported on girders, resting on the party-walls had Ween fixed about _ fl4hFW ^;vo the level of the old floot. "The back chimney-breast on the ground floor had been cut away and those parts of the front and back first-floor chimney.breasts that interfered with raising the uoor had also been cut away, and the back part of the houEe had been taken out. " Mr. Hunter'; No. 148.-This house had been nearly gutted. The front wall had been rebuilt, the back front taken out, part of the floor joists under the roof was off' and the only parts which remained of the old house above the ground floor were one party wall and part of another - the latter, adjoinin,g Mr. aple house, had been taken down about 15 feet in consequence of its having bulged and being otherwise defective, "As the floors and roof had not been put, in the two party walls were kept in their places by horizontal strutting or shoreing. There was also a shore tn the street against the front of the house, but the shore to the front of Mx. Maples' house had been removed. "To carry out such sn extensive alteration, almost amounting to rebuilding at one house, and a complete reconstruction of the ground and first floor at the other, the greatest care is recusred, and such alterations ought never to be attempted without the walls are in a sound and substantial state, and the whole securely shored up until the completion of the works. "Beaut what was the state of theexternalandparty walls in these houses?t "The front wall of Mr. Maples' house was evidently in a most unsafe condition, cracked in all directions, split in the middle by the front casing having parted from the backing, and the materials (for the most part) of which it was bult of the worst description. The north party wall was in about the same unsound and rotten state, fractured and bulged on the basement ,story, and the chimney shafts overhanging. " The party-wall on the south, or Mr. Hunter's side, was uot fractured in the basement story, but the naterials of which it was composed were equally bad, and the upper part had so much bulged that it had to be taken down. " Bad as the existing walls appear to have been, the new brickwork in the parts I saw where the work had been made good was also of a most inferior kind. Old bricks had been used without being properly bonded, and the cements did not possess the adhesive gualities of common mortar. "The builders in explanation mentioned the names of well-known manufacturers and merchants by whom the cements were supplied, and it is much to be regretted that respetable houses will countenanoe the sale of such rubbish under the name of cement. " With such a state of things it is only surDrising that the houses kept up as long as they did; almost the slightest disturbing cause would at any time have been sufficient to occasion the accident, whether it arose from the one house or the other. Both were in an unsafe condition, of the two I think Mr. Maples' worse than Mr. Hunter's. "I The immediate cause of the fall can be ascertained only from the evidenee of those who were on the premises at the time, and I think it may be gathered (notwithstanding the contradictory statements of many of the witnesses) with tolerable accuracy from the evidence of White, Harrison, and Baker. " The witness White, while working in catting the front hole, says he felt the dust from above falling on his cap, and on looking up saw a crack close to the front pier. This was caused, no doubt, by the vibration described by several witnesses, and accounted for by Harrison from the brickwork near the front hole being harder, and this was one of the reasons why the front hole had not progressed so far as the back hole. It appears to me that the party wall between 147 and 148 and the front pier sup porting the two bressummers were the first to give way; the front walls fel. The loud report that was heard was doubtless the breaking of the two bressummers at the points of support when the fronts gave way; a momentary pause might ensue, as described by the witness Baker, while the leverage of the bressummer of Mr. Maples' front acting upon the end of the cross-girder, upan which the latter rested, hurled over the north party wall, carying with it the adjoining house, No. 146. This ill aocount for the ruins of Nos. 146 and 147 being found uppermost. " Nothing, in my opinion, could have been more injudicious than attempting, under the circumstances, to cut away the ground floor of Mr. Hunter's party walL Fifteen feet of the upper par had already been removed, and not much more than two stories in height remained standing. As a matter of expense it would have been much cheaper to have taken it down and rebuilt it. "1 The work that was being carried on at the same time to Mr. Maples' party wall was equall ill-advised-viz., in attemptmg to strengtben thewall by building half abrickin thickness against it, with such cement as that described, and without any bond. Such an addition was perfectly useless, and the only way of accounting for the want of bond is that the bricklayers at work upon it were afraid of cutting into the wall, as the vibration thatwouldhave been created might have brought down upon their heads the overhanging chimney-breasts, and probably have resulted in the same disastrous consequences that occurred to the ojDpoaite walL " I consider, therefore, that the immediate cause of the accident was the cutting of the front hole in the party wall between Mr. Hunter's and Mr. Maples' houses. " The primary cause is to be ascertained, I think, from the evidence of the district surveyor. He stated that no detailed survey was made before permission was given for the alterations; the walls were not examined either in the basement story or in th-e roo-f-. -N-o-w-he,hd the"disgtrict- siir veyor considered it part of his duty to make a proper survey in the first instance the result would have been that oth the party and front walls would have been condemned. The party wall of Mfr. Maples' house was absolutely fractr not an ordinary settlement) and brokea in the basement story about six feet from the front under the opening, that was increased in height, aud it had bulged at the back under the part where the chimney-breasts were cut away.~~~~~~~~~~~~a "On the roof the front wall of the adjoining house had separated from the party wall, and the front wall has already been described as in a moat rotten state. "'Nothing, therefore, could be more unwise than attempting any alterations to houses in this state, and nothing short of rebuilding should have been permitted. " It is only justice to the district surveyor to state that) if the Building Act requires him to make a detailed survey and examination of a house before he sanctions any altera- tions, the Legislaturo has devised the best possible means of preventing him attending to his duties; his district extends from Tottenham-court-road to Higbgate-hill, a distance of about three miles, and it contains upwards of 20,000 houses. Now, if he were to devote the wh,ole of his time in surveying the houses undergoing alterations or in course of erection, assumingthatthenumber of houses building-viz., 500 when the last census was [taken-is the usual average, and adding the houses undergoing alterations. it would take him six weeks, allowing only half an hour to each house, to viit the works going on in his district ; and if he surveyed in rotation after receipt of every notice, a builder w ould have to give a notice three weeks beforehand instead of two days, as required by the Act, to insure an early visit em the district surveyor. This is one of the many ab' sw4itidee of the Building Act. In 1774, the date of the old Act,, ne district surveyor was allotted to the parish of St. Paw, which pobably then ocotained aboy.$ 500 hou The first oficial return is in 1801, the number being at that time 4,500, but at the present time it is estimated that the panish contains 20,700 houses, bat still it has only one surveyor. It is quite impossible, therefore, for the duties to be properlv performed. This is the third accident attended with lossof life, and upon which I have been called upon to report, that has occurred in this division of the metropolis within the last two years and a quarter, and in my opinion SU might have benprevented if the Building Act had contained proper regulations. " At the first accident seven lives wero sacrificed, and after what passed at that inquest it was confidently hoped that the Act would be satisfactorily remodoUed. " In tho latter end of tho same year an alteration was made in the Aot, and the Court of Offcial eferees (which caused, it was stated, great delays in dealing with ruinous suctunres) was abolished, and three other public depart ments wele empowered to control and assist the district sUrvey7ors-viz.,the Polico Commisdoners, the Metropolitan Booarof Works, and the Commissioners of Sewers for the city of londun. The effect has been to create a difference of practice and division of authority, and the Act in this respect i. more comtlicated and confused than before. The iletro politanBoard of Works, who appoint the district surveyors ave no power to interfere with dangerous structures; and the Police Commissioners adopt one course of proceedings in one part of London and the Commissioners of Sewers another withinthecity. The twolatter bodiesdislikethe duties imposed uponthem by the Act, not being in any way connected with the ordinary duties of their departments. The Commissioners of Sewers have not appointed m rveyors to ad3minister to the Act, but return the notices to the distrct surveyors, directing them to be carried out, however arbitrary or improper they mny be. The Police Commissioners employ the surveyors, and the result is great jeadousy on the part of the district surveyors who are called upon to superintend works ordered by the Police Commissioners, and which, as in this case, they may consider improper ; but still they are required by the Act to supervise those works and see them carried out. "1 It is true that the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the Building Act, appoint an architect called 'the Super. intending Architect of Metropolitan Buildig" but altioughhls title is so oomprehensive, he has nothingto do with the great mass of metropolitan buildings to whioh the reguations of the Act apply. He can, in fact, only interfere in buildings where purties wish to construct them of iron and in a peculiar manner; and even the principal public buildings of the metropolis are exempted from his suPervision. Dangerous structures are wholly exempted from his as well as the Board o, Works controL "The houses where this s&d accident has occurredis aninstanoe of the praotical operation of the Metropolitan BuildJing Act ; for, although some of its provisions were modified in 1845 and 1855, its spirit and administration are the sAme. A witness stated that he believed nearly the whole of the houses on the east side of Tottenhim-court-road were in as bad and rotten a condition as Messrs. Maples and HIunter's houses, and these edifices, it should be recollected, are comparatively modernhouses, having been ereoted under the g ilding Act about 66years ago. My belief is (from a knowledge of the buildings in various parts of the metropolis) that not onlv are the houses on the eastern side of Tottenham-court-road in the state described but that a verr large proportion of the houses erected between l774 and 1845 are and will be in a few years in the same condition, more particularly those formerly denominated fourth rates, such as are seen in the suburbs of London from several of the railways entering the metropolLs. " I think that the Government incur a great responsibility in continuing in force such an Act of Parliament in the face of the frequently-expressed opinions of all parties, from the humblest buUder to the judges of the land. " It is an act which legalizes bad building; it has made London as inferior to many continental cities as it formerly was superior, and by its conflicting, and, In many cases, absurd and contradictory regulations, defeats the only object that a proper Building Act should have in view-viz., the substantial construction of all houses and buildi]n without any exceptions whatever, for the prevention of the spread of fire, and for the protection of the inhabitants of the metropolis from such accidents as the painful one now under investigation. " I have the honour to bes, Sir your obedient servant, " T. MRS] NESON, Architect."
UNI ZVBSITY IN'ELTIGENC. OXFORD. Jux 5. In a congregation held this day at 2 o'clock the new statute establishing a system of examinations for the middle 0lasssc was promulgated. The Provost of Oriel objected to the conferring of a degree on any persons who had not resided at the University. The title of " Associate in Arts" would in reality be a degree. He approved of the examinations, but did not wish to see any title conferred. Mr. Lancater, of Magdalen College, rose, and was procoeding to read a vitten address when the Master of Pembroke rose to order. Heo appeled to the Vice-Chancellor whether it 'was competent to members of congregation to read their speeches. Mr. Lancaster defended himself by the practice of members of Parliament, aud stated that his health prevented him from speaking ex tempor. The Provost of Oriel inqured whether the rles drawrn up for the guidance of proceedings in congregation determined the question. The Vice-Chancellor having called for a copy of the ruleo decided that 'written addresses oould not be read,. M. Iancaster upon this declared he should content himself with an amendment. Mr. Rogers, of hlagdalen-hall, approved the statute, which he thought was a liberaland'wiseact. Heobjectedtothetiteof"Asociate in Arts," to the indefinite portod for 'which examiners were to be appointed, which might allow of an appointment for life; and to the requirement of any examination in divinity. On the last point he moved an amendment. The Provost of Worcester approved the scheme, and was not only in favour of a divinity examination, but would wish to see all candidates examined in the doctriuaes of the Church of England. Mr. Chaffers, of Brasenose, objected to the statut, and particularly to the title of "Associate in Arts," which he thou ght would tend to confuse our degrees. The Master of Balliol spoke in favour of the statute, on which he felt warmly. The middle clases had sought Oxford; he wished that Oxford had first sought them. Atanyrate, he hoped and trusted that Oxford would respond to the appeal made. Cambridge, he believed, was propared to do so, and Oxford ought not to be behindhand A great boon would be conferred on the middle classes There were 400 grammar schools in England, few of 'which received any benefit from Oxford. He thought the rejection of theclause conferring thetitleof "AssociateinArte" would ruin the scheme. He trustd the clause would be maintained, and that the University would respond liberally to the doensd made on it. The Master of Pembroke was glad that the statute had been received so favourably. He deo fended the title of " Associate in Arts" from the objections which had been taken to it. The Ven. the Archdeacon of Oxford hoped that the two Universities would act in oonoert. Mr. Burgess and Ur. Earle, of Oriel. and Mr. Shirley, of Wadham, proposed other titles instead of that of " associate in Arts." Mr. Lake, of Baliol, spoke in favour of the statute, but objected to the appointment of a delagacy for three yes, and to the annual report of the delegates. Dr. Acland answered the principal objections made. He observed,-lst. There must be a title of some kind, 'Associate" or some other, for that would be the badge of success, and the reward in part; 2d. That it must be an honourable title, for many of the men would be strong men and honourable men; 3d. That the matter must be done at once, and without delay, or else, as in the west of England, it would be done by individuals or by other bodies 'whose claims and fitness for the great 'work are inferior and lessserviceable to the nation; and therefere, t , expedite the duties, it was best committed to a board of delegates. The examination of candidates for the degree of B.C.L. will commence on June 19, at 11 a.m. The Junior Proctor has given notice that he 'widl receive the names of undergraduates who intend to offer themselves for the responsions in Trinity Term, on Thursday, June 1, from 1 till 3 o'clock; Saturday, June 13, from ltill 3 o'clock.

TO THE BDITOB OF TZHD TIMES. Sir,-I shall feel much obliged by your allowing me to make a few remarks through your paper on the interesting letter of the Rov. G. P. Badger in The Times of this day, and which without some little explanation might produce an erroneous impression on the public mind. I allude to the mischievous inundations of the Lower Euphrates, which have long been known to me, and which are but the natural result of the neglect of the river's embakmenta. Such inundation must be perfectly familiar to all who are ae quuinted with eastern rivers-such as the Ganges, the Indus, the rivers of China, &c. The Euphrates forms no exception to the genoral rule in this respect, and the inhabitants of Essex would not feel very comfortable if the embankments of our own Thames were neglected as those of the Eaphrates have been lately. But Mr. Badger and all who may be interested in this subject wiU be glad to learn that the reparation of these embanlkments formed a prominent part of the negotiations which I carried out recently at Constantinople with reference to the proposed navigation of the river and rlway. As the survey of the rivers of Mesopotamia was the lead. ing object of the Euphrates expedition, I cannot but feel pleciOd to learn that my charts have been found to be correct with regard to the Sholt-el-Arab and Kar&en, both above and belo1 Mohammerah, while their inauracy at places above Kurnab, where the embankments have been destroyed and the inundations have taken place, is so inevit. able under these cireumstances as to cause me no disappointment whatever. Up to a recent period the dikes had been under the care of the Sheikh of the fontefik Arabs and were well kept up by him up to the period of his death. When treating on the subject of this temporary evil and the means of remedying it, I found the Sultan's Ministers quite prepared to do what what was required, both in this and other parts of the river, and also to facilitate itg navigation; and I perceive with no little pleasure, from Mr. Badger's letter, that steps have already been taken for this purpose; for he says,-" It is reported, indeed, that the Tnrkish Government have some idea of restoring the embankments, and that they are treating with the Mont6fik Sheikh to undertake the work, offering payment forthe same by remitting part of the annual reveiue payable by this chief." I do not, however, agree with Mr. Badger in hisgratuitous assertion that "there is little chance of its being executed." But Mr. Badger was necessarily ignoraut of the arrangements made at Constantinople, which embrace the double object of restoring the embankments and keeping them in repalr (thus facilitating the navigation of this noble river), and selecting at the same time the line for the railway. To accomplish the latter, it will be necessary either to make a curve, so asto carry it clear of all possible inundations, or to raise the bed of the railway about two or three feet in certain places So much for engineering diliculties. With regard to those which may be expected from the Arabs, I rejoice to find that Mr. Badger's letter supports the opinion I have formed during several yeare intercourse with this people. I have never anticipated any serious difficul. ties from them, aud Mr. Badger's remark that the people along the river " are most anxious to believe in the truth of the report of the Porte having pawned this district to the English" is most encouraging and satisfactory. hoping that I have not trespassed too much on your valuable space, I remain, Sir, your humble aervant ' K.- .11H41N1Z V MIjor.GeneraL 1l, Bentinek-street, June 4.

6LbA1?.s'. Yesterday a deputation of the proprietors of shares in the railways of the united kingdom waited on Lord St ny, President of the Bord of Trade and the light Hon.L I Lowe, Vioe-President of the Board of Trade, to preeunt a memorid on certain matters of grievanoe which the rail. way proprietors were of opinion demanded the mrious consideration of the Government. The deputation ton. sisted of Mr. George Hadfield, MP., Mr. Wickham, M.P., Mr. B. Bal, ILP., Mr. Hen Pee, IP., MIr. Coningham, XP., Mr. Garnett, mY, Mr. Watln, &LP., Hon. H. Dutton. ILP., 31r. C. Bailer, 3LP., Mr. Gregeon, iM.P., Mr. James Caird,k P., M., W. F. Price, HLP., Mr. Samuel Bele, MLP., Mr. PA, Mr. M?Garrell, Mr. Leo Schuster, Captan Johnston. Sir William Gore Ousley, Captain lMAnles, Mr. J. Scott, 3r. Colks Child, Mr. Crombie. Mr. MilL Mr. Wright, Mr. Leo, Mfr. T. Broadwood Mr. Richerd Daweon, Mr. Gordon Thompson, Mr. J. b. Vranoe, Mr. Tewart, Mr. Adams, Mr. Tegg, and a great many other' gentUcmen connected with railways. Mr. HnMLD introduoed the deputation from the body of railway shareholdes, whose property was the subject of discussion, and he heped the pro etors would receive from the Government-that relied whlch they now sought. He had made an estimate of the receipts and expenditure of 1 companies, and found that the woskdng expens6s amounted on the average to 50 per oent. The pasenger tax was levied on the grow receipts, which amounted to a tax of 10 per cent. on the profito. No such tax ws lin. posed in Ireland. Of the rating to the poor and other rates the raily companies did not so much complain as of the unequal and Jnjuat mode in whEich the rate was levied. It was rased not apon the property, hut upon the profits, and there was no right oE appel. hese were charges which pressed moat heavily upon. the shareholders, whose profits were estimatd at an average of not more than Si. 12s. 4d. Mr. VANCE. -Iwish to point out an error inthe stte. ment made in the memorial in that respect. The dividend bas amounted to Sl. and a deciwal twelfth, which would make the sm about 31, 3., and not 31 12s. 4., as set forth in the memorial. lMr. KADnMa said, another gevanco was the abstraction of the criage of parcelsbythePostoffice, although the railway companies were obliged to carry soldiers, polioe, and other classes at a very reduced rate of fare. After advertingto the other matters set forth in the memorial the hon. member hoped the noble Lord would aid in relieving this class of property from the excessive burden to which it was now subjected. Mr. VANCE, after apologizing to Lord Stanley for the memorial having been addressed to Mr. L5we, as VicePresident of the Board of Trade, instead of to his Lord. ehip, prooeeded to observe that the memoriaists were traders representing 300,000,OOOZ. sterling which had been expended for the benefit of the country, and the proprie. tors of which had not received any benefit whatever from the capital. This, they affirmed, had not arisen from mismanpaement on their part, but had been caused by the mode in which the Ligature had dealt with railwy property. Competition Was good in all other trades, but not in reference to railways. In other trades competition regulated prices, but in regard to railWays the Legislature had fixed the limits of charge for which they should cary pasengers Various ommittees had sat and discussed the question. The committee of 1844, presided over by Mr. Gladstone, was of opinion that the question should be referred in the first instance to the Board of Trade, and on that occasion Lord Dalhousie expressed an opinion that competition, which was then very rife, should be restricted. But instead of paying any attention to this suggestion Pariamentary committees, acting under the influence of Sir Robert Peel's dictum, that competition should be the order of the day, granted a great number ofcompet-n lines, the result of which was that many of them neveSa even their working expenses Competition, therefore;hd proved equally detrimental to the shareholders and to the public. On the subject of rating he submitted that the ra- way companies had very strong grounds of complaint. The law In regard to rating other property was altogether in. apphcable to railways. This had been admitted by Lord Campbell-in the Court of Queen's Bencb. The only mode in ch -it was posible to arrive at the value of a portion of a railway was to make a conjectural estimate of its profits, but this was regarded as grossly unjust. The queston was raised in the House of Lords some time ago, when the Mar. quis of Iansdowne pledged the Government that he would introuce a measuretoremedy the evil complained of. Lord STAXIMY.-You are speaking of some years ago. Mr.VAXCM-Itwasinl849 Inadditiontothatacommittee of the House of Commons recommended that whenever a general Bil relating to railwayscame before Parliament the subject of rating should be specially attended to. He might, hoWever, state that so loni ck as 1844, whensomaeof the leading men connected with railys met Mr. Gladstone on the subject ofcarrying passengers at the rate of a penny n-mile, and also of CarryiDg soldiers and polioemen at a cheap rate, an arrngement was made that if the companies conformed to that regulation Sir 3amues Graham should bring in a Bill that would give the shareholders relief from the oppression which they laboured underia reference. to the poor rates. Tihad never been done. Lord STrANsY.-I wish you wouldpoint out to us what is the distinction yoncomplin of inthe mode prsued ainthe rating of railways and in that pursued in rating gas compa. nice, water companies, canal companies, and other such like pub lc companies. Mr. VANCE.-Water companies go under the ground, and tberefore pay no rs.tes at all But if you take a lurge mannfactoryyou can estimate its letablevalue, which would be its rateahle value, only that you pas a special Act of Parliamens by which it is exempted from duty. Lord STANnzY.-Is not gas ratedat so mach- a mile that it passes through th pipes '? Mr. WATkN.-NO; the gas companies are rated for the land they occupy, axd not for the property that passes through their pipes. Lord STANUE-Y.-How would you proposo to rte rail-. ways ? Mr. VASCE-I would propoe to rate them in tho same mode as turnpike roads are rated. Lord STANiix.-You mean yon would rate them for so much land that they posses ? Mr. ADAM ' did not think that that was the prayer of the memorialists. It wan a question to be inquired into. Mr. VANcIL-If I am asked to prescribe a remedy I would respectfuly say that I am not the Legislature. Lord STINnxy.-If I understand you rightly, you do not say that there is any new law affecting your rating, but that there is a disinction in the application of the present law to 3our case? Mr. VANCE.-Prcisely so. Lord STANnxE.-What I wishlto arrive at is the distinction between yours and the other cases. I do not think there is such a distinction as would make it necessary to alter the law. Mr. VANCE.-Lord CampbeU had frequently pointed out the necs'ity of some remedy being provided by the Legidla. ture for the evil of which we now complain. LordSTANTLy.-I thinkyMr. Hadfieldsaidtherewasno pr. WATxss said, he did not expect that in waiting on his Lordship the deputation would be called upon to suggest specific remedies for the evils of which they complained. Theycameto the board to state their grievanceL If his Lordship should tell them that they had no grievances to complain of, why then'they must submit But if, on the other hand, his Lordship and the right hon. gentleman, Mr. Lowe, should be of opinion that there were grievances of which the railway shareholders might rea sonably complain, then he would say that the memorialists had a right to call upon them to apply a remedy. In regard to rating, Lord Campbell said that he was called upon to apply a law to railway property which, when the law was passed had no application whatever to such property, there being no railway property then in exist,- ne. Bssides, it was impossible to ascertain the letable value of a poition of railway which could never be let at alL IHe knew a case where 4-5ths of the rates of the parish were paid by the railway company, although there was no station in tho parish, nor was a shilling received in the parsih by way of passenger; nor, on the otber hand, was there any person imposed on the parish from the company. RaiIway property was altogether an exceptional case, as shown by Lord Campbell. It was a newly- created property that required to be dealt with in a manner different from the old-established possessions; and that property having been devoted to the creation of magnificent public works, the holders of it were entitled to come to the Guvernment and ak them to afford redress for any revanoes to which by the existing law they were subjected. Mr. VANCE said there was one grievance of which he thought the railway companies bad great reason to complain; he referred to the operation of Lord Campbells Act, by which compensation was awarded according to the value of the person's inoome who might suffer by an accident on the railway. Mr- WATn; observed that their own Merchant Shipping Act affotded a precedent by which this part of the law might be established, ~where there was a limitation to the amount of damages in the event of shipwreck.

WATRim knew that in the United States the law of proportion was observed, and that in some csues of casualty $5,000 were awarded, and in others $2,000; but there was in each case a limitation. But the case as applicable to the railways of this country was different. A person worth 1001. a-year paid 5s. fare for going from one point to another; a bishop paid tho same sum for going the same distance, and yet the amount of compensation for any casualty to the bishop would bo immensely greater than to the person of 1001. there was required some alteration here. No insurance-office would take upon themselves the risk that was involved by the operation of Lord Campbell's BilL Lord STANLEY.-After all, the Act only intended to re. present the sttus of the differentpersons to whom accidents might occur. You must give compensAtion to Sir Fitzroy Relly,who was the example in these cases (laughter), should any accident befall him, according to his werth. That was the only alteration in Lord Campbell's law. Mr. WATsw.-There ought, no doubt, to bh some difference made between the damages for the injury to a poor man and aman of rank and station; but he should be glad if the railways would refuse to ay bis-hops and Sir Pitz. roy Kelly altogether. Lord STANLuy.Conjd you not insure yourselves?t MSr. WATi.-We might ho allowred tocharge a small additional sum for insurance. Lord STANLEw.-I don'tmean that.

Lord STsrYconsideredthat great advantage would result from such aplan It wasobviouthat the department over which he presided thought ao berause the proposition was made by those who were at tiihead of that deprtment. Mr. VANcE wished to call the attention of his Lordship co the fad that, whil the s saved the country, ac. cording to Mr. Stephenson!a cscenUlon, 14,000.0001. of money per annium, yet the proprietors received no inore from the Government for carriage or potage than they paid to the Goveruetioh sae fd tyo passnger. LordsTA Ysid itcold by oman ete iho te Government to deteriorate heproperty oE the railway proprietors, but it could not be denied that whatever deterioration that property had suffered wa any the result of unwise conduct on the part of railway companies them. A GmEm&&w of the deputation observed that the Go. vernment was not always blameless ana referred. as an in. stance, to the cma of tho Chester and Holyhead line, where it was required by the Government that an iron tubular bridge shouldhe construtedat a gret expense, when a wooden bridge would have been eu iy servceab Iord STANw remembered when he was in the House of Commons that great complaintg were made that the public were not at libert to judge for themselves as to the lines which should be made. iiMr. WATKnT sid that, without pretending to deny that in the ea period of railways many errors were commaitted, he did not think rail wa proretors were guilty of any great mistake that should deprive them of a claim to the favourable consideration of the Government. Lord STANLEY.-We are all fully sensible that railwys are a great benefit to the country, and we shall be very happy to afford Any redress that itis in the power of the Government to render. But, of course, the deputation chanot expect us to express any opinion upon the subject on the present occasion. (Hear, hiear.) Mr. WATNn.-What we want is to plbo our case before You. We do not ask you to adopt our views until you have fully considered the facts we have represented to you. Lord SzA.sLy.-I cannot help reminding you that some few years ago I introduced a Bill into Parliament asking for certain powers, to which almost every railway company made an objection. I asked that theBoardof Trade should have the power to construct certan bridges over a certain line, but it was objected to. Mr. WArTnK.-I think I asited in that opposition; and why? The line was complete; the capital account was closed, and the company had no money to construct the bridges. He begged, however, to observe, generall, that if the Board of Trade would be s good svz to cons0l the railway proprietors a little more, and obtain some practical opinions from them, they might be able to workc together a great deal better. Lord STr.aL I think I have always shown a disposition to oensult the railway pro prietorsonallIquestions, and that I did so when Mr. Cardwells onnected with tIe Board of Trade; and I am sure that there is every dip tion on the part of Mr. Lowe to promote the interest of and consultwith those connected with railways. Mr. WAT=.-The impression is that there is not a mutuality between the proprietors and tho directors, and that the directors have not been consulted by the board. Lorz SNLuY.-I don't think you can complain of our interference lately. Mr. WA=.-Not lately. Mr. 'GAxRuELL said he was a holder of 150,OOOl. railway stock, and that there was Another gentlenlan in the room holding a similar amount, and that the average dividend he received on 80,0001 of that stock was 2i per cent. He was not a dealer in shares, but held them as investments. On the other 70,000. or 80,0001. stock he received a dividend of 6 pr cent. Mr.VANcz then expresed the thanks of the deputation for the courtesy with which Lord Stanley and Mr. Lowe had litened to their representations, and, after handing in the memorial, which bore the signatures of numerous shareholders, he and his friends withdrew.

PARLIMENTARY INTELLIGENCEHIOUSE OF LORDS, FinDAY, Ju.E 5, Their lordships met at 5 o'clock. | Earl COWLEY took the oaths and his seat for the first time since his elevation to an earldom. The noble earl wr.s introduced by the Earl of Clarendon and Earl Cadogan. The LORD CHANCELLOR brought in a Bill to Su'pply certain defects in the Mortmain Act of George I.., to enable Roman Catholic charities, such as schools, which were not for what were called saperstitious I.sos, to be duly enrolled. The Bill was read a first time. Lord DUNGANNON presented a petition, from Llangollen against the abolition of church-rater,, without an equivalent. Lo Ra VENSWORTH presented a '1etition from tho civil servants of the Crown at Ncwcastle-apon0Tyne praying for an amendment of the Superannuation Act. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY presented a petition from Macclesfield against the present system of licensing beerhouses. Lord COLVILLE, in 42ze absence of Lord Wharncliffe, presented a pettion from the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the borough of Sheffield, praying that the proceedings of te Ecclesstical Courts may be confined to matters pcurely end smply ceclesiastical, and that their jurisdiction in other mratters, particularly in matters testamentary, may be tahen away and transferred to more sefficient tribunals. CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATIONS. The Dake of NEWCASTLE, in presenting four petitions from civil servaxts of the Crown, praying for an amendment of the S uerannuation Act, expressed a hope that as the report of te commissioners had now been presented the Government would give their immediate attention to this serious gcievance. Although it was incumbent on Par. liament to study economy, especially in the civil estimates, yet the country could better afford to pay Its servants well than to be iU served, of which he was afraid there would be great risk so long as this crying grievance was unredressed. He threw it out for the consideration of the (iovernment whether it would not be possible to do away with the present system of enforcing contributions from the civil servants towards Providing superannuation allowauces, in which only one out of a large nnmber ever partidpated, and to substitute in its place a system of contributions for assurranoe for the benefit of the wives and families of civil servants at their decease. This plan was acted on by many large mercantile firms in the country, and had been found to give the utmost satisfaction to all concerned. SETTLED ESTATES ACT (IRELAND). In reply to the Earl of DONouGHroRb1, The LORD CHANCELLOR was understood to say that some delay had necessarily taken place in issuing the rules and orders of the Court of Chancery in Ireland under the Settled Estktes Act, but that no inconvenience had been caused to suitors, as was shown by the fact that no petition had been presented under the Act. PRINCESS ROYAL The Princess Royal's Annuity Bill was brought in and rend a first time. SUPERANNYJATION ALLOWANCES. The Earl of ALBEMARLE presented a petition from the civil servants of the War Department in the Royal arsenal at Woolwich, and another from the mechanical officers of Woolwioh dookward against the present system of superannuation allowances. MERCaANT SHIPPING ACT. The noble EALRL also presented two petitions, ono from merchants, shipowners, shipmakrer, and others connected withthe port of Bristol, and the other from Southampton, against certain clauses of the Merchant Shipping Act. The petitioners wecre not unfriendly to the principle of the Act. They considered it desirable that the laws relating to the mercantUe marine should be consolidated into one act, and that care should be taken to secure a right description of vessels, and a proper description of persons to command them; but they contended that there were clauses in the Act which rendered it nugatory in these respects. They complained of the cumbrousness of the Act, which consisted of 548 clauses, many of them so prolix and comolex that no seaman could be expected to understand them. Then, on the subject of limitation of liability, they stated that the 502d clause declareci that no shipowner should be liable for any damage done to property or life beyond the value of the ship and the value of the freight, and that in no instance was that value to be taken at less than 161., while in case of life the liability was limited to 301. in each ease; but that this limitation was rendered a nullity by the 511th clause, as it provided that parties not satisfied with the statutory award might have recourse to an action in a court of law. The petitioners ad. mJitted the principle of being liable to penalties proportioned to their responsibility, but they objected to the unlimited responsibility laid down in the Act. Yioreign ships were generaly exempt from the liabilitv to which Briti'h merchant ships were exposed, and especially the American mercantile marine, whioh was our greatest competitor. The total tonnage of British shipping was nearly 4,000,000 tons, and the Amorican tonnage was about the same, but, being free from labilities to which English ships were expored, it was natural to find the former increas. ing more rapidly than the latter. In consequence of the liability not being defined, it was difficult for shipowners to insure, and therefore the Act tended to deter men of capital from entering into the passenger trade, which was le t chiefly in the bands of speculators. Thus, the very clauses which were intended to protect the interests of emigrants were found to operate to their disadvantage. Another point of which the Petitioners complained was the construetion of the tribunals wbich tried cases under the Act, The objections were that the court was arbitrary, not recognized by the law of the land, and, inasmuch as its decision was not final, the effect was to prejudge the case. The court consisted of two magistrates, aided by a nautical assessor, who in 19 cases out of 20 was a pcst captain in the Royal marine. The petitioners objected to justices of the peace as being totally unacquainted with nautical matters, and a naval officer was objectionable on account of the antagonism which Prevailed, or was supposed to~ prevail, between the Royal and the mercantile marine. In some countries abroad similar courts existed, but were composed in a different manner, there being two officers of the mercantile marine and one officer of the Royal navy-an arrangement which was found to work weil and satisfactorily to all parties. Having stated the objections which were entertained by the petitioners, he wished to ask the noble lord at the head of the Board of Trade whether it was intended to introduce any measure to meet the requirements of the shipowners ; and if not, what means were to be adopted to remedy the grievances complained of. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY said the first grievauce enumerated by the noble earl was that the Merchant Ship. ping Act was a long Act. That statement was undoubtely correct, but it could not be otherwise, as it was a consolidation of some 120 or 130 previous Acts relating to merchant shipping. At the same time, although lengthy, the Act was not obscure, for the able and eminent men who drew it up had divided it into various heads, which rendered it very easy of reference. The shipowners also complained of Lord Campbell's Ac, but they had little reason for so doing. By the common law any carrier on sea or land who inflicted injuries upon another person was liable to pay damages to the party injured, and Lord Campbell's Act merely extended that prinsciple, by eclaring that where a person had met his death through the neg gence of any master of a vessel, or other convey. ance, his representative should have power to sue for damages in the same manner as the party could himself have done had he not been killed. Some modifications were introduced in the Merchant Shipping Act-one, that as emigrants going out in a body would not be able to undertake separate proceedings in case of misconduct on the part of the master. or damage sustained by his negligence, the Board of Trde in such cases should have power to make claims for all parties with a maXnimum limit of 30. per head. Theliability of the shipowner was limited to the entire value of the ship and freight. The noble earl had animadverted upon the constitution of the courts of inquiry, but he (Lord Stanley) thought those tribunals were well selected and had answered their purpose. They were of two kinds-the local muarine boards, composed of the principal merchants of our various ports; and courts of inquirv composed of two justices of the peace or a stipendiary strate assisted by a nantical assessor. All ordinary cases, such as drunkenness on the part of the master, were decided by the local marine board, but more serious matters, such as wrecks, were inquired into by special courts constituted as he had mentioned. The nautical assessor was, no doubt, generally a naval offcecr, but that could hardly be consldered nudesirable, and certainly the Board of Trade had derived great advantage from the assistance of the a le officero nnect ed wit h h thatdepartm ent. H e did not hin, tereore tht terewasanyground for an alteration in the existing law. No ease of injustice had uee produced, or any reason stated for supposing that the decisiosnofteleca bhcourts rof ienquiry were notfounded upon The Earl of HARDWICKE observed that the statement lopethiat, aS farsas the Government were concerned,any inquiy would be mnade into the operation of Thae erchant Shapping Act. Th-at an inquiry would be made he was perfectly ceonfident, believing that their lordshipe, in the absence of action on the part of the Govern. men, weoud think it right to apspoint a selet conmittee on the subject Some of the demands of the petitioners oould not reasonably be refused, while there were various points not mentioned in their complaint which ought to be investigated. Both the merchant service and the pubiae were of opinion tat the existing Act ought to be reconsiderd and xevised, without party preiudice on one aide or the other. The fomrner had no objection to be placed under any Law which would extend to the latter security for their perscus or property in their conveyance from port to port. But, as stated in the petition, they complained of various provisions in the Shipping Act which bore hard upon them without zasnefiting tho public. They objected, in the firt plaoc not to the existenco of tribunals for trying cases of wreck and the like, but to the mode in "wich the members of those courts conducted their buained , and they asked that they should be allowed a right of appoaL A more reaEonable recuest could not, in his opinion, be znade, and he was sure tfiey would be satisfied with an appei to the Admiralty Court. Their objection to the assessors was not that they were naval officers, but that they were not always the most competent men. All the officers in the nav were not seamen, and a gentleman acting as assessor who was not thoroughly aequanted with his profession could n.Ot beexpe&e to give satisfaction. The petitioners also oomplined of the inspectors appointed by the Board of Trade 50 examine the constmction and machinery of vessels with n view to the safety of their cargoes. He admitted that it was ncessary to place such a powor of inspection in the hands of Government; but here again the objection was that no apW waa allowed from the decisions of the inspectors. he Beard pf TIdQ )iuid nfmqd4 ffignie ;0and reguI&ROg for the gui.aance of their inspeotor ' sRxoh instructions, ofwevle tilfully and sagaciously drawn, could evidently be of dlitA6 use unless placed in the hands of men of superior judr,ment. An inspector might examine a boiler, i foz~ example, and if he found that it was r4ot furnished 'with " stays," he might condemn it, although pToved by actual experiment to bear a pre sure far greater than it would ever he required to sustain. He wou d suggest that in such a ease tho boiler should be tested in the presence of the inspeotor, and if found strong enough without stays, should not be condezmed in consequence of the want of them. Wherever the parties could not agree the question ought to be referred to some tribunaL A great deal of jobbing resulted from the present system. He did not say that the inspectors were capable of accepting bribes, but they were influenced through the mediutm of third parties, as he was prepared to prove before a select committee. In the port of Glasgowthe shipbuilders were in the habit of submitting their plans to the mspector. Now, it was never the intention of the law to interfere ,with private business; its object was to sece the safety of the public in their persons and property. He did ubt agree with the petitioners that the regulations were insultiug, although he was of opinion the law required revision. If the Government persisted in refusing inquiry. means might be found to compel investigation by a select committee. The Earl of ALBEMARLE said the prayer of one of the petitioners was for the appointment of a select committee. Lord STANLEY of ALLDERLEYs3idthat if it would give satisfaction to any parties the Government would have no objection to give an appeal from the loc'l courts. At all large ports the inspectors were entirely unconnected with any trade which could influence their judgment. The Earl of ELLENBOROlUGH disapproved of appeals generally, though it might be proper to- allow them in cases of certificates being cancelled. He thought the Government would do wrong to consent on light grounds to an alteration of the law, which had been settled after full discussion only three or four years ago. Lord CAMPBELL camed attention to the fact of applications beig made to lords of manors to state whether they claimed the right to wrecks wFhich came on shore withsin their jurisdiction as against the Crown, because he had been informed that those applications were made under the lIfer. cantile Mlarine Act. LordREDESDALE said, the position now assumed under the Act in question on the part of the Crown with ree.pec to wreck which had drifted ashore was most unfair, ismuch as each proprietor of land bordering on the sea was now caUed on to prove his title to wreck to the satisfaction of an officer of the Crown, who was, in point of fact, the cLaimant against him. A man might be now exercising by prescription the right to wreck cast ashore on his estate, but by this act he ran the risk of incurring a heavy penalty by continuing to do that which he had done for years, and which had been done by his ancestors before ham, under colour of that prescriptive title. Such a case of injustice was never before perpetrated by an Act of Parliament that he was aware of, and nothing short of the absolute repeal of the clauses in the Act in reference to wreck was requirod by the commonest principles of justice. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY was understood to say that it was not made compulsory on the lords of manors to produce their title-deeds, and that it was only in cases where the right to wreck was not claimed by any other person that the Crown tepped in to exercise it. If a man claimed the right, he was caled on to produce his title, but it was not compulsory on him to do that, and if he failed to do so the question of the right remained to be settled by the legal tribunals of the country. Earl GREY said his recollection entirely bore out what had beon stated by the noble lord opposite (the Earl of Hardwicke . He (Earl Grey) knew that on his own estate wreck had atways been claimed by him; but he had recently recelved a peremptorynotice that if he continuaedto claim that right he would be called on to show his title. The Earl of DERBY said, he had been alUed on in precisely the same manner to show his title (a laugh), and his neighbour, the Earl of Sefton, had received a similar notice in respect of that part of his estates situate at Liverpool. Although in las (the Earl of Derby's) case the value of the wreck wfas very inconsiderable, the right to the property between high and low water mark was involved in the question. Lord WYNFORD stated that this question assumed additional importance when it was borne in mind that the clauses in question applied not only to the coast but to the shores of navgable rivers, and that in both cases the lord of a manor was liable to be caUed on to show his title. Lord BROUGHAM, adverting to what had fallen from the Earl of Ellenborough, said he must protest against the notion that appeals were generally to bo disfavoured. At the same time, the best course was to make their original court as perfect as possible, so as to render appeals une. cessary. After some further conversation, in which Lord COL. cHsuSTEr and a few other noble lords took part, the subject dropped. PROBATES AND LETTERS OF ADlIINISTRATION BILL. The order of the day for the third reading of this Bil was then read. In reply to a question from Earl STA.HorE, The LORD CHANCELLOR said, he did not anticipate that, under the 37th clause of the Bill, there would be any increase of the judicial business of that House. The only questions connected with this subject which had ever occupied the time of the Judicial Committee of Privy Couneil aroso upon appeals as to the sanity of testators. Under this measure those questions would be practically excluded from the consideration of the Committee of Privy Council, for in 99 cases out of 100 the sanity or insanity of testators would be decided by a ju. If, however, there should be any complaint of misdirection the matter might be brought before the Privy Coancil from the court below by writ of error. The Earl of DONOUGHMORE expressed his regret that the noble and learned lord on the woolsack had stated a few days ago, in reply to the noble earl (Malmesbury), that it would be impossible to grant compensation to proctors. The noble and learned lord sad that any great public reform must be attended with some injury to private interests; but he (the Earl of Donoughmore) wished to 'know what public benefit would arise from throwing open the courts of testamentary jurisdiction to solicitors, when there was in existence an able body of men-the proctors-who were experienced in the business of such courts, but who must necessarily suffer loss from the competition to which they would thus be exposed. Under these circumstances, he certainly thought the proctors were entitled to some compensation. He t ought t at some alteration ought to be made in the 43d clause, which provided ithat the ditrict registry might grant probate if it should appear on the affidavit of any one person that the testator had a fixed place of abode within the district, and that his personal estate was less than 1,5001. He would suggest that the amount should be reduced to 8001., and that the affidavit should be accompanied by a very simple descriptionofthenatureandvalueoftheproierty. The noblo earl then referred to the 73d clause, which he said was not very clear, but the object of which he understood was to relieve the Bank of England from certain responsibility; and he suggested that some words should be introduced to give the Bank of England al the protection necessary. He thought the proectors of York had an especial claim to compensation, for their court was abelished and no substitute was provided, and the whole of the business which they had been in the habit of transacting would be entirely destroyed. He concurred in the desire to reform the ecclesIastical courts, but it was expedient that the cause of useful reform should not be Injured by a provision of the nature to which he had just alluded After a few words from Lord WYNFORD, The LORD C3ANCELLOR said, he should always be very glad if he could seo his way clear, to compensate persons who suffered loss by any great public reform,; but if every reform was to be delayed until all possible loss to the different classes of persons affected was put out of the qaestion, no one need attempt the task of a reformer. Ozn a close examination of the case of the proctors, it was impossible to say that they were entitled to compensation. The changes proposed in the Bill might diminish their pro. fessional profits, but it would be impoemible to ascertain their particular profits for a certain number of years back, and then strike a balance between what profits would be lost and what would be retained under the new system. If they took away a situation which a man was entitled to hold for oe, then compensation ought to be given; but the case of the proctors was very different. There had been exceedingly few petitions from the proctors on this subiect, and that he believed arose from an honest feeling on their part that compensation in their case was impracticable. He thought no valid objections had been raised, and he therefore moved the third reading of the BilL The Bill was then read a third time and passed. THE CASE OF MR. COONAN.

LONDOZ, SAIURDAY, .TuxZ 6, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, The Princems Royal's Annuity Bill wa rtad a third time and passed. A discussion then arose as to the worling of the Mercantile larine Act, in which the chief point worthy of notice was the alarm caused i the minds of some noble lords by a provision under the Act which called on Lord, of Maaors to prove their title to wreck. The Probate aud Letters of Admbtrtiom Bll was re&d a third timae and passeda, after au nr.w
It is not often that ten columns of debate -admit of simplification so easily as ihose which we .yesterday reported on Mr. HonsFALr's motion for 'reerring the constitution of the Board of Trade to the consideration of a Select Committee. The Board of Trade is a body standing between the great interests of this ounmtry and the public, with the special chargo of protecting the latter. Its duty is to Eee, as far a: such matters admit of legislative regulation, that no particular dass shal take advantage of tine public. In its past history it 'will ba found the pioneer and champion of ]pree Trade ateveUyae ofthegmatProteotionist strgl. In its present functions it superintends the general economy of our mercantile marine, and provides for the safety of passengers by land or water through the machinery of inspection at its coramand. If a ship is wrecked it inquires into the circumBtances of the catastrophe; if a railway is to be opened it tests the stability of the work, and pronounces on the security of the line. As a comprehensive example of its duties, it reports upon private Bills before Parliament, and gives information as to the manner or degree in which such measures may be likely to affect publio interests. All this sounds like a highly reasonable and judicious policy, but there is one consequence which must inevitably ensue. Either the mission of the Board is ideal and it performs nothing at all, or, if it really acts, it must act to the correction and therefore to the discontent of those who, but for this intervention, might have had things more their own way. In either case it would be exposed to attack, and this is the contingency which was exemplified on Thursday evening. The great commercial interests are occasionally chafed at the action of the Board, and Mr. HonRsALL represented their case with a good deal of earnestness. As was natural in such a matter, there were plenty of points to be mado. The Board meddled with all kind of things -Agriculture, Commerce, Statistics, Navigation, and Railways. It was iinpossible to treat so many subjects properly, and in fact they were not treated properly. The Board had too much upon its hands, and those under its control suffered in consequence. Then, again, it was composed, not of men professionally conversant with the affairs in question, but simply of statesmen, and, as was just now the case, of a peer and a lawyer. How could such men be competent to deal magisterially with the thousand interests of commerce ? The immediate object of such government, moreover, could be nothing but the destruction of that local self-government which Englishmen cherish as their birthright and their palladium, and what must be the event of such a policy ? Finally, the Board was a Board, and as such essentially and necessarily obnoxious in popular estimation. Of such materials Mr. HORSFALL made the best, perhaps, that could be made, but so strong was the case against him that his arguments could not save his motion from being negatived without a division. In all this there is nothing surprising; in fact, when it came to the point Mr. HORSFALL himself could not make any practical demand except for the introduction of some professional element into the constitution of the Board, and this was about the weakeat point he could have taken. If the temptations naturally incident to great commercial cnterprises are to be corrected by independent authority, it is clear that this authority should be really independent and absolutely unconnected, either by sympathy or interest, with those over whose claims it is to sit in judgment. That the regulators of trade should not be traders is a maxim self-evident in its character. If, indeed, any merchants of eminence after retiring from commerce should be disposed to give the country the benefit of their experience in this department, their services might be most advantageously engaged, as was proved in the case of Lord AsH- BuRToN and of Mr. PoxuL-ETT THOMSON; but that the functions exercised on behalf of the public should be kept as free as possible from the influence of private or class prepossessions is too clear an argumen' to be insisted on. The commercial magnates appear to think that their right to be immediately represented at the Board is analogous to that of every man to be tried by his peers, but the more correct description of their claim is that of every man being judge in his own case. The safety of the public demands that ships and railways should be inspected by authorities who are ntot shipowners or directors,Nand whose opinions therefore are not liable to the bias of particular interest. If the cognizance of the Board of Trade is extended to a great variety of objects that is only a necessary incident of the functions it assumes. Its duty is to intervene at every point where the interests of the public at large require to be consulted as well as those of commercial enterprise, and these points, as things now go, must inevitably occur at every turn. There is certainly, however, no reason prim4facio why two intelligent men, of any political party, conversant, as we must presume them to be, withthe aspect and management of public affairs in general, should not be competent to pronounce an opinion on behalf of the country at large, -either on shipping matters, or railway administration, or agricultural statistics, or private BiUs. Heterogeneous though such subjects may seem in some respects they would al possess this feature in common,-that the private or peculiar interests involved in the several questions were to be balanced against the general interest of the whole community in so far as it might be affected by the pending transaction. It is clear, too, that no such change in the constitution of the Board as Mr. HORSFALL had been advocating would meet this objection, unless, indeed, it could be assumed that every imaginable " interest " was to have its particular representative, and that then this increased staff could exercise the functions of the body with more efficiency. But the probability evidently is that each such. representative would simply exert himself obstructively whenever the interests of his constituents appeared to be at stake. If the shipowners, observed Mr. LABo-u- :HERE, " had had exclusive possession of the Board "of Trade they would never have repealed the Navigation Laws-" The various instances quoted by Mr. foRsnALL of the injustice or inefficiency of the Board do not appear to involve any more serious errors than must necessarily be expected from a faUible tribunal; and some of the points selected for complaint admitted obviously of being cited on the opposite side of the question. For instance, it was alleged as a hardship to shipowners that inquiry should bo instituted as to the insurance or non-insurance of a vessel that had been wrecked, as if such a proceeding was inquisitorial and injurious. But in reply it was show)n that the system of maritime insurance-so valuable in itself-had occasionally the ill effect of creating negilence, or worse motives, through which a ship might be improperly sent to sea or navigated. This very week a petition from the seamen of the North-East ports appeared in our columns, in which, among the causes assigned for the decrease of seciuity to life and property at sea, was alleged the " sending vessels to sea in an " unseaworthy state." Surely any kind of inquiry by which life can be saved ought to be resolutely maintained. In the case of Railways it was argued that in one or two instances the officers of the Board of Trade had restrained the use of portions of a line by injunctions which they had afterwards been obliged to cancel, when the perfect stability of the work proved the falsity of their previous apprehensions. This, however, is plainly a fault on the right side. The public want security, and if all that can be said is that assuranoe is now and then made doubly sure they wvil not think much harm has been done. Throughout the whole of this argument there ran, more or leas overtly, the old and interminable question between self-government on behalf of individuals or companies and supreme administra_ tiSm on behalf of the community. By instinct aRDA 3saihion we iacline to thl former priciple i i3 some terribi,2 miscarriage comes home to us, and then we cry oub for the latter. Where the supreme power is weakest c,;taatrophes are most common, as in the United State:; where it is strongest, they are of proportionate rarity, as under the absolute Governments of the Ow1tinent. Of course, freedom of all kind, commercial a.q wel as individual, must be more or less interfered with by the exerciseof this generalcontrol; but, as such controlis manifestly demanded in the interests of the public, we can only trust to approximate to the exact means by which the lnazimumn of advantage may be combined with the minimum of detriment. We hope we are not far off the mark with our Board of Trade in its modem form. Certainly British feeling has not yet been unlocalized, and yet the Board, as Sir J.&Bm GRAnAt explained in a luminous speech, has accomplished a very large amount of good. It can never please all parties, that is clear; but it can protect all against each in turn, and that is a better mission to undertake.
Some of our politicians certainly seem determined that patriotism shall be made easy to the British public. The democratio orator who indignantly asked his audience, "Did you know that "you were oppressed till I told you ? Did you "know that you were miserable serfs till I told "you?" is the type of the gentlemen 'who are grieving over the inertness of- voters at great elections, and who are anxious to coax the nation into exercising its political rights. - Lord ROBERT CECIL and his friends cannot bear that only half Middlesex or Lancashire should care to make known its opinion on the merits of rival candidates. That the metropolitan county should have 13,000 registered electors, and yet that little more than 7,000 should vote at the last election, is a fact to be deplored and an evil to be remedied. Now, if a plain man were questioned on the cause of this phenomenon-if one of the nonvoting electors, for instance, were asked why he had foregone his glorious privilege, he would probably answer that there were quite enough to vote without him, and that the contest was really not of sufficient interest to tempt him from his ordinary business. This we conceive to be the true explanation of the whole matter. There is no strong party feeling in the country; there are no subjects on which direct antagonism exists. Everybody is a sort of Liberal, and nobody pretends to be much more. We might as well attempt to resuscitate ELDox and ELLENBOROUGr, to revile and be reviled by HUNT and Cossr.r, as expect to find a keen appetite for party conflict in the well-todo householders of the London suburbs. They know that the Liberal member will not vote for anything very new or startling, and that the Conservative, through the hope of office or under the pressure of his constituency, will often go beyond his opponent. Furthermore, the great body of the electors think one way, and the battle is never for a moment doubtful. A majority of two to one or more may be counted upon for certain candidates, and it is of no use for the elector to put himself to inconvenience to swell a triumphant majority, or to make a certain defeat a little less disgraceful. We cannot therefore see on what grounds Lordl ROBERT CECIL would rest his scheme of voting by papers sent by post and filled up at the residences of the electors. What is the advantage of thus enticing and supplicating men to express an opinion which they do not care to express 7 Surely there is no great hardship in requiring an elector to proceed once in five years to a polling-place at the most only a few miles off, and there in person to give the vote which will help to constitute the Legislature of his country. What he will do any day for business or pleasure he may surely be asked to do some eight or ten times in his life at the call of his country. If he is too lazy to drive over to the nearest polling-place,-if through apathy or ignorance he does not value his own vote, we think it no great calamity that his vote should be lost. If the contest be at all a close one and he stays at home, he must evidently be a man who has no very definite opinions and no very strong feelings. In either case it is as well that he should be out of the way, and any system by which the exercise of his rights is thrust upon him must have a tendency to swamp real sense and public spirit by the votes of the ignorant and indifferent, obtained by clever organization on the part of electioneering agents. The whole scheme of Lord RoBnsT CECIL is based on the theory that it is desirable to obtain the votes of all persons who are voters. Now, the theory itself we entirely deny. It is desirable to obtain a correct representation of the public opinion and public feeling of a county or borough, and this will be best effected by giving a large and independent class the right of suffrage. But, so far from its being necessary to induce every man of this class to vote, we hold that it is, on the whole, advantageous that the electors should be in a manner sifted by the necessity of going to the poll -the earnest and the well-informed from those who have no opinions, or who are indifferent about making them prevail. As to the system of voting papers, the ingenuity of man could hardly conceive anything more effective for making eternal and invincible every abuse of our Parliamentary elections. Bribery and intimidation are bad enough at present, but at least the millionaire and the landlord have not entire possession of the voter. He may receive money to vote blue and at the last moment vote orange, while the blue agent must hold his tongue, or content himself with railing at the treachery in private. One of the most effective checks to wholesale bribery under the present system is the want of security. The candidate is afraid to pay the voter beforehand, and the voter does not like to trust the candidate. Bat, as was justly observed during the debate, the vote itself, instead of the promise of the vote, might, under the proposed form, be bought and sold. The printed form is the actual instrument by which the elector exercises his right, and it might be filled up and bodily made over to the candidate's agent in return for a 101.-note. The transaction might be completed without danger from treachery or mischance. If it were desired to find an expedient which should restore to its former vitality the somewhat palsied system of corruption, we know not any more effective than this of making a vote a written document, which can be handed over to another and locked up in his desk days before the election takes place. It need hardly be said that intimidation also is likely to be more frequent and effective when the votes are given privately at home than when the elector walks up to the poll under the eyes of hundreds. Other scarcely minor objections may be urged conclusively against the scheme. The dangerof forgery, the certainty of personation, and, what ought to be of importance in the eyes of the Conservative, the total change from all the habits and traditions of English political life, are matters which might well insure the refusal of a Select Committee on this subject. As for the argument about the lessening of the candidates' expenses, it seems to us that this object can be equally well effected by an increase of polling-places, not only in counties; but in boroughs. Of coarse, if candidates choose to provide cabs and ca,.iages for the transport of the voters they must be wontent to bear the expense. All that ! the Legisl.aue can do is to provide that the votes. shall be taken in a sufficient number of plaes *tQ I malt hii ditance traversed by each ele%toq as small as may .4MYtiently k% Parliament has already half supprOied the abus2. and there is no reason why it should, in endeavt,.uring to escape from the evil, give its sanction to a ay.;tem which unites the worst forms of the continient~d procedure with all that disfigures our own.
We publish in another column a copy of the Report which MTr. N=oSoN has addressed to the De-puty-Coroner for the Western Division of the County of Middlesex with respect to the late lamentable accident in Tottenham-coet-road. This gentleman reports that previously to, and at the time of, the accident the front wall of one of the houses must have been in a most unsafe condition-that " it was cracked in aU directions, " split in the middle by the front casing having "parted from the backing, and the materials (for "the most part) of which it was built of the "worst kind." So with regard to other parts of the works; one party wall was in a rotten state, bulging out at the basement; another was composed of materials equally bad with the first, and a portion of it had to be taken down, so much had it bulged out. Then, with regard to the new work jusb executed, the new brickwork was of the most inferior kind. Old bricks had been used " without being properly! " bonded," and the cement used did not possess the adhesive qualities of common mortar. This cement was supplied by houses of mark in the trade, upon which fact Mr. Nw-soN very pertinently remarks, " It is much to be regretted that "respectable houses will countenance the sale of "such rubbish under the name of cement." It would be useless to trouble our readers with technical details, which would be quite uninteDigible to any but professional men; we will therefore give Mr. NEwmso's conclusion in one short pbrase. The immediate cause of the accident he considers to have been the cutting of a hole in the partyi, wall between the two houses. This, however, was only the " immediate" cause of the accident. From the condition in which the waUs were found it was only to be wondered at that an accident had not occurred before. Bad materials, bad work, walls rotten and bulging on every side, would seem to be a sufficient explanation of what ensued, even although we had been unable to assign with certainty what particular act of the workpeople had brought these miserable structures tumbling about their ears. Such was their condition that in Mr. Nn.7sox's deliberate opinion any attempt to patch them up must necessarily have been attended with the utmost risk. One only course could have been adopted with safety, and that was carefully andi deliberately to pull them down, and then to reconstruct them from the foundation in a solid and workmanlike manner. The poor labourers who were at work were in about as safe a position as though they had been employed on excavations in the crater of a volcano in eruption time. This case of the Tottenham-court-road accident is not an isolated case. Occurrences of this kind are not unfrequent. We are bound, then, to give publicity to Mr. NxasoN's statements as to the actual insecurity.of the metropolis from defective building, defective repairing of buildings,defective supervision of buildings, and from the insecure and unworthy condition of our buildings even when completed. We are, of course, speaking of the tenements ordinarily used for purposes of trade and for dwellinghouses in the occupation of the middle classes-of those long, interminable rows of brick buildings, in which for the most part the life of London works and has its being. It is impossible to walk for half-a-mile along any of the usual thoroughfares of London without striling upon some balf-filled gap where workmen are busily employed in the work of demolition or reconstruction. It becomes, then, a matter of the most vital importance to know that these operations are carried on in such a manner as not to endanger the lives of the public while they are in hand, nor the lives of the future tenants when they are completed. We somewhat fear that in giving publicity to the statements of this gentleman we may be exciting alarm; but it is not only right but necessary to raise the note cf alarm if matters are in the condition he describes. It was stated by one of the witnesses in the course of the recent inquiry that " nearly all "of the houses on the east side of Tottenham"court-road are in as bad and rotten a condition "as Messrs. MAP"LS' and HUNTER'S houses." These were the houses which fell. Mr. NursoN reminds us on his own account that these houses were erected under the provisions of the Building Act, about 56 years ago, and adds,- " My belief is, that not only are the houses on the easern side of Tottenham-court.road in the state described, but that a very large proportion of the house erected between 1774 and 1845 are, or will be in a few years, in the same condition, more particularly those formerly denominated fourth-rates, such as are seen in the suburbs of London from several of the railways entering the metropolis," Where, then, is the fault? On whose shoulders should the blame be cast? This is a question which is only forced upon the attention of unprofessional readers once and again when some tragedy occurs, such as the one of which Tottenham-court-road was lately the scene. One's natural impulse is at once to challenge the District Surveyors. The popular belief is that these persons are really the working Adiles of the metropolis, and should be made answerable for all accidents which occur from any cause over which they might have exercised control. The discretion and care of the District Surveyor charged with the supervision of the Tottenham-court-road District were called in question, and there were conflicting statements as to the vigilance and care which he exercised upon this occasion. We cannot, however, resolve to say anything very strongly to his disparagement when we read Mr. NmLSONx's tatement of theduties which he is required to discharge. It appears that his District extends from Tottenbam-court-road to Highgate-hill, a distance of three miles, and that it contains about 20,000 houses. The usual average number of houses being built is estimated at 300. M1r. NimsoN calculates that it would take the Surveyor about three weeks to make his rounds and visit each house under his supervision, allowing only half-an-hour to each house. Now, if this be so, it is the system which is at fault, not the man. A builder who requires inspection is obliged to give three weekse notice if he would make sure of a visit from the District Surveyor. At present three public bodies are authorized and required to control the operations of these District Surveyors. These are the Commissioners of Police, the Metropolitan Board of Works, and tho Commissioners of Sewers for the City of London. The Metropolitan Board of Works appoint the District Surveyors; but, if we lightly apprehend the matter, they have no fur-' ther right to interfere with their operations. The Police Commissioners, however, exercise control over them without, and tho Commissioners of Sewers should do so within, the City boundaries. These two bodies should appoint Surveyors to check the proceedings of the District Surveyors. The Police Commissioners have done so, but the Commiasioners of Sewers have neglected so to do, and have left the District Survayors to take their own way. In addition to these arrangements the Metropolitas Board of Works appoint a functionary w1to is somewhat pompously styled " the Superintiending ".Architect of Metropolitan Buildings ," but, as lie is Qnly called upon to act i cases where the buildingi i) to be consitructed of iron and in a peculiar manner, his nomination, as fax as the great bulk of the Londoners are concerned, may be considered a dead lettir. The point which we have thus briefly exc: plained. is one which ahould receive the immediate ald anxious attention of the Government. lVhatever may be the other defetts of the Building Act, hero is a great and obvious blot. London ahould at once be divided off into, manageable Districts, and over eaxch of these Districta a Surveyor should be appointed-a person of cmnpetent skill who should be sufficiently remunerated for his xervices. When this is done the District Surveyors- should be made strictly responsible for al aecidents which mnight have been prevented by -rofeswional skill and vigilance. More we may reqaie, but with less than this the Londoners ougit not to be satisfied.
Our readers will see with pleasure thettement of the CHANcEmoR of the ExcHzQuEir with re- I ference to the payment to the Danish Go7arnment for the abolition of the Sound Dues. Tie total sumn which this country has agreed to pay is 1,125,2061., in return for which the Danes agree to maintain lighthouses and other aids to navigation, and to further reduce the Transit Dues. The advantages derived from thus getting rid of a vexatious charge, which inflicted more loss by delay than the amount of the impost itself, are, we believe, of the greatest importance. The trade suffered so much by the detention of vessels that we may reasonably hope that, now the Daes are abolished, it wiU increase to an amount far greater than that present value by which the indemnity to Denmark is calculated. But the actual payment of this milion-and-a-quarter sterling is of less importance than the manner in which it is proposed to effect it. It might naturally be expected that this great sunm would be thrown over a term of years, and that the finances of the country would hardly allow such an amount to be abstracted from the revenue of a single year; but the ansurances of the OELAacEuop of the EXCHEQUER on this point are as explicit as they are satisfactory. The resources of the country have been raised by continued prosperity to a point which wil allow the disbursement to be made with ease at once. At the beginning of the year the national income had been estimated at 7i,885,000l., but it has in reality amounted to 72,334,0001., or 449,0001.., over the estimate. The expenditure had been calculated at 78,000,0001., but ithas turned out to be only 76,588,0001., being 1,412,0001. below the estimate. The balance, therefore, in favotir of the nation is 1,861,0001. Consequently, no power to borrow money for the payment to Denmark is required, and Sir a. Lzwis is enabled to pay the whole sum at once out of the present balances in the Exchequer. The public will be satisfied that our trade is to receive the benefit of such an alleviation of burdens, and atil more that we shall be able to pay down the purchase-money without adding a farthing to tho debt of the country.

THE ABERDEEN CABINET. An historical group of singular interest has juSt been engraved by Mr. W. Walker, of Margaretstreet, Cavendih-quare. An English CabinetCouncil is, we believe, a subject altogether now to pictorial art. Such a subiect would have provokec. curiosity under any circumstances ; and for thepresent work a moment has been selected that allows the most celebrated politicians of this age and. country to be brought together within the limits of a single fram% and represented under the influence of a single thought. The Cabinet of Lord Aberdeen is supposed to be in the act of discussinc the policy of the expedition to the Crimea. No less than 15 personages, all depicted with admirable accuracy, are present. The centre is occupied by Lord Aberdeen *maelf, Who sits with folded hands and seems to be submitting with grim resignation to the necessity of war. On his right, and rather behind him, stands the Lord President of the Council, Lord Granville, engaged in reading a number of the Momifeur, which, while it serves to give reality to the scene, answers the artistic purpose of bringing out ia strong relief the head of Lord John Ruaell, whoL is seated on the right hand of the Premier. The next chair belongs to Lord Clarendon, but he is supposed to have relinquished it to Lord Lansdowne, and as he still leans at the bak we have a graceful action turned to good account in the advantageous position of two portraitL The portrait of Lord Lansdowne is excellent. Tee Duke of Argyll, Keeper of the Privy Seal, is standing by the side of Lord Clarendon, and before him snit Mr. Gladstone in the extreme foreground. Sir James Graham stands conspicuously behind Mfr. Gladstone, and on his left hand is the less prominent but highly characteristic figure of Sir William Moleaworth, late President of the Board of Worlks. Sir Charles Wood completes the series on the right hand of the Premier. The principal figure on the other side of the engraving isLord Palmerston, who, although seated, is addressing Mr. Gladstone and Lord Lansdowne vith extreme animation on the subject of the proposed excpedition. Lord Cranworth, Sir George Grey, and Mr. Sidney Herbert, are all in'oduccd on the same side of the group, one of the most sriking personages being the Duke of Newcastle, who is leaning upon the sand of a rap to which Lord Palmerson is calling attention. The general defect of works in which a great number of portraits are comprised is a certain stabbornness in the component parts that seems to resist combination for a general effect. The spectator perceives tbat a number of miniatures have been executed, and that they are brought into contact with each other, but in spite of this meclanical juxtaposition the appearance of isolation is not overcome. Now, this engraving of the " Aberdeenx Cabinet" is not only valuable from the number and correctness of the portraits it contains, but it in equaly admirable as a composition. Not only is every face accurately represented; but no faoe is obtruded as if its owner had joiued the party for the mere purpose of sitting for his likeness. The, attitudes of every personage are various and natural; "the right man is in the right place," much more in the print than he was in the reslity, for those who might be supposed most prominent in the discussion are likewise most prominent iu the. engraving. The composition of the work- belongs to Mr. John, Gilbert, well known as an artist both in oil ana. water, who executed a chiaro-oscuro drawing for the use of the engraver, and superintended the. modifications of the original designs. The accuracy of the portraits has been-obtained at no smelAlexpen.dituro of care and. trouble, both to the artists and to the persons represented. ?hoterita. of all the Ministers were taken, ancd. these were corrected and improved by lit*g) to Mr. and Mr. Walker. Thus the ent! groEp is the result of the joint lbours* wf the historica artist and the portrait nteu>,whohavve united their talents wth a succes blmost unparalleledinthis clas of subject. -.n.biscapacity of engraver Mr. Walker has fully pr^eWved the characteristics of the design, and p., theorld with a group in which our most e mjient politiciana are not only copied, but live, brathe, and act in their several characters.

FOBEIGN INTBLLIGaENB. ff1(.UJJ. ino following appoared in our second edition oP ye. terdav:-1 fvrt%?f AT7R OWM CORRVFPl'A WM ' PARIBS, THURSDAY, JuNx 4, 6 p.m The Co7isiiutiwnlen contains an article by ML Granier de Cassagnac on the elections, which is little more than an echo of the Ministerial circular on the same subject issued some days ago. M. de Cassagnae labours to prove that complete liberty is allowed the electors in the choice of the candidates for the new Chambers, while the Government presents to them those it considers eligible. He says:- "There exists full and entire liberty of personal opinion, but parties have vanished before the national sovereignty. Since France, after being consulted in a legal manner, has thrice pronounced herself by a majority which might have been termed unanimity, no group of political men has the light to exonerate itself from the obedience and respect due to the will of the nation. Only two interests can, therefore, be heard at 'his moment, when the country is called upon to choose its representatives-the Government in tho name of society, and the candidates in the names of their doctrines nd services. What have been wisely rejected by existing institutions are the agitators, agents, and electiona eering brokers. Tbese are at perfect liberty to dispose of their votes, but they no longer command the faculty of leading others astray by means of falsehood or intrigue." There is a great deal more to the same purport, but the meaning is that the electors are at perfect liberty to name the ecndidates presented to them by the Government, and none others. How this can be called perfect freedom of choice ordinary men will find it difficult to understand. It resembles the IIliberty" accorded to Figaro when about to establish his periodical, entitled Le Journal Inutige. He says,- " I was informed that, provided I do not speak in my vritings of the authorities, nor of religion, nor of politics, nor of morality, nor of people in offlce, nor of public bodies, nor of the opera, nor of any other dramatic representation, nor of any one who has anything to do with anything whatever, I may print everything freely,-under the inspection of two or three censors." M ste Cassagnac further says:- "Some time must elapse before the new electoral body cnn become acquainted with the exercise of its rights. Until its political education shall have been accomplished, it requires the advice of an enlightened and paternal Administation. The dominant sentiment in France is the confidence in the efficiency of the Imperial institutions, and in the wisdom of the Emperor." If this be true, and if the infallibility of the Emperor is so universally admitted, there is no need to go through the farce of the elections, for, under such circumstances, they are nothing but a solemn farce; and there is no reason why he should not at once name the deputies himself, by decree or by Senatus Consultum. It would be much shorter, quite sa effective, and not a whit less liberal. The Presse announces that the elections Will be contested in the five electoral districts ofthe Gironde. The official notice eiven to the press of certain departments to abstain from discussing the electoral question has, according to the Phare de la Loire, been withdrawn. That journal says:- " The Presne will no longer doubb the correctness of our asertions in reference to the notice addressed to the pro. vincial press. This notice, as we had been led to expect by the circular of the Minister of the Interior, has now been officially withdrawn." The Sitcle publishes two rather curious letters exchanged between the Prefect of the Gironde and M. David, lately Deputy in the Legislative Body for the arrondissement of Libourne, in that department. The Prefect's letter, dated the 24th ult., stated that the Government is of opinion that it will be right to support M. Armand, one of the most eminent men of the Gironde, and in the full vigour of his age; and it accordingly requests M. David to " give a new proof of his devotion to the Emperor and the country by generously abstaining from presenting himself as a candidate, and thereby causina division in the great party of the Imperial cause, which he has always firmly supported." M. David, in his reply, dated the 26th, declares that, " far from giving up his cause, he will persist in it more Iinly than ever ;" and that he "( owes such a line of conduct to himself, and stiU more to his arrondissement, which revolts against the Prefect's pretensions of imposing on it a eandidate who does not possess its sympathies." He adds that he shall publish some letters relative to the affair, and among them one from the Sub-prefect of Libourne, which states that though he would communicate to him the lists of the electors he would not allow hiM to take a copy of them, a declaration which, says M. David, amounts to a restrlction on universal suffrage, in opposition to the "just and liberal ideas of the Emperor." The correction inflicted on the Senate some time ago seems to have produced its effect. The Senators are determined to prove to the world that they are not the useless lumber people thought them, but that they really possess a considerable amount of animation. They were long fishing about for something to show that they are capable of more than registering the votes of the Lower Chamber, and they at last found it. They have actuaUy dared to take the initiative, and, though their success was not equal to their courage, yet they have let people see what is in them. A commission prepared some short time since a project of law to the effect that the military Senators, 1Marshals, &c., should be removed from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts-martial for military officers, and be tried by the Senate; and, moreover, that the non-military members should be amenable, not to the ordinary tribunals, but to the Senate-in fact, that they should be put on the same footing in these matters as the old Chamber of Peers. This , startling innovation was discussed, and referred to the Council of State. M. Baroche, the President of this last body, was charged to address the Senate on behalf of the Government; and this worthy citizen, who is never more constitutional than when he receives a large salary for being so, opposed the project, and administered to the Senators a very severe lecture. The project conceived with such hardihood is, of course, at an end; but the Senators are indignant at the offhand manner in which they were treated by the ex-patriot. I have not heard that the " Conscript Fathers " have as yet thrown up barricades about the Palace of the Luxembourg, but so great is their anger, that if they could do so and keep their places, I should not be surprised if they voted for the entire Red list of candidates talked of for Paris. The Senate is a dangerous body to meddle with. It is like the famous ol d gun at 00ontantinople-it requires a vast deal of trouble to make it go off, but when it does it makes an awful noise, with not much harm. The Pays, Ministerial journal, contradicts & statement in a Belgian paper that Feruk Khan is going to London to arrange the modifications which are to be made in the treaty of peace. The Pays adds that the treaty of peace between Great Britain and Persia was ratified unconditionally at Teheran. A special clause in the treaty grants to the British Government the right to appointConsuls in the northern provinces of the empire. The privileges and func. tion8 of the Consuls are to be, as they always are in similar cases, the subject of a special convention independent of the treaty. Such is the truth. Count deMomny, previous tohis departure from St. Petersburg, which is to take place about the 25th of the present month, will sign the treaty of commerce between the French and Russian Governments, of which all the clauwes are already arranged and agreed uponl. The King of Denmark has determined to despatch the war corvette Najaden to the China Seas. She is to be stationed at Macao during the ImDending hostilities. A number of pieces of 20f. each have been lately coined at the Mint, which are manufactured of gold discovered at Cayenne, and which is of excellent quality. A telegraphic despatch had announced that the Grand Council of the Canton of NeuchAtel was convoked for the 21st of June to deliberate on an amnesty, without mentioning to what claws of prisoners that measure of clemency was meant to apply. We now know that it relates to such mem- bers of the militia as did not join their regiments when called on in consequence of the events of September. They would be pardoned as a matter of course when the treaty came into operation, but by me3ns of this extraordinary meeting of the Grand Council they wiU be restored to liberty or to their country, according as they are in confinement or fugitive, about a fortnight sooner. The King of Bavaria yesterday paid a second visit to the Palace of Versailes, and returned to Paris at half-past 6.

The accounts from Bel ium speak of tranquility being generally restored, aithough some slight agita. tion still exists. The objections to the late BiU on Charitable Institutions appear to gain ground. The Communal Council of Ghent, in its sitting of the 2d, voted by a majority of 18 to 5 an address to the King similar to that of the commune of Brussels. Tke Communal Council of Namur was to Asemble onthe same day to drawup a similar addres. The cTozrnal de Huy of the 2d says:- " For a great number of years past a club of forestrs, under the patronage of St. lIubert, have niade every two years a pilgrimage into Ardennes.. On Saturday morning latthey started asusual from the Church of St. Pierre, and on the afternoon of Monday seturned in procession, and proceeded to the Church of S:. Pierre. To their great surprise, and that of a crowd of people who had assembled' to witness their return, they found the doors of the church closed, and every request for admisdon vas positively refused. The crowd soon becamo excited, and,.amidst cries of 'A bhas la caloUel ?A bas ls couvents i' the members of the club dispersed This fact has produced a consider. able sensation m the town, andit is much to bo regretted that the order to close the church in this manner should have been given by the clergy under existing circum. stances."

The funds opened this morniung at an impr vev ment of a quarter per cent., and subsequentLy eX perienced a further advanoe of. an eighth, the market closing with a steady, appearance. Consols for money were first quoted 93B to gI and they left off at 93; to 94 for money, and O4i to ig or 93 to 8 ex. dividend for the 9th of July. A further arrival of overdue vessels from Australia, coupled with better accounts from the] Paris Bourse, was the principal causes of the increase of confidence. Rsliefwas likewise felt fromthe termination of the extra pressure in the discount-market, consequent upon the liabilities of the 4th and 5th of the month. Money in the Stock-Exchange, however, wA3 still in full demand on Government securities at 6i per cent., and Exchequer-biUs experienced a further fall, which considerably increases the prospect of a large number of the June descrlptions being sent in for payment on Monday next.

In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates, with the exception of Paris, were a shade lower than last post. The corn-market was dull tis morning at the rate3 of Monday. The report of the iAverpool cotton-market for the week shows a tendency to lower prices. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evemnng were 69f. 20c. for money, and 69f. 3Gc. for the end of the month, showing a preponderance of money purchases, and a further average improvement vf a quarter per cent. The gold by the Walmer Casle, from Port Philip, is 38,123 ounces, vaued at 152,4921. This makes the total Australian arrivals of the present week to have been 573,0001. The only overdue vetssls now out are the South Carolina, with 82,0001., and the Medway, with 72,0007. : The 126,0001. of gold brought by the Sydenhaux reached London this afternoon, but the totals by the other vessels last announced have not yet been received. A large proportion is expected to be sold to the Bank. The Paris letters to-day confirm the advice3 regarding the increase in the bullion of tha Bank of France during the past three weeks. According to one statement the total now held is 11,400,000W., but, as this would show an augmentation of more than 2,000,0001. since thelast return, it is possible some mistake may have occured in the figures. The improved position of the Bank has led to rumours of a contemplated reduction in the rate of discount. It seems incredible, however, that such a step will be resorted to before the artificial purchases of gold are entirely stopped, and in the present uncertain state of the silk crop. Politically it is doubtless regarded as very desirable in order tO create a more hopeful feeling pending the commencement of the elections. The West India mail on Tuesday last brought intelligence that there had been a great discovery of gold at Upata, in Venezuela. "The gold," it is alleged, "is exceedingly pure, and the quantities realized are beyond belief.' The existence of the3e mines, however, has been known for several years,. and although the statemest now made of their wonderful richness Is probably a great exaggeration there has long been reason to suppose that they might be foundL to yield a return to any individual labotsrers at least equal to the average obtained either in California or Australi. Traditions oe large eeposits in the alluvial soil of the Yuruary hava existed from time immemorial, but the actual discovery of their character and extent appears to have been first made by Dr.-Plasard, French Vice-Consul at Angostura, Venezuela, in1849, by whom the fact was communicated to the Minister of the Int6tior. The Government forthwith notified that all diggers must pay one-fifth of their earnings to the State, but no turther steps were taken, and, as the district was wild and remote, and such as could be searched only by properly organized parties, little result arose. The accounts then given, however, by such few persons as from time to time engaged in the pursuit correspond with the facts now mentioned, that the gold is found in nuggets rather than in diffused particles, and that It is considerably more pure than Californian gold, the difference being about 34 per cent. About two years back M. Plassard having associated himself with a Mr. uEhas Gorrin, of New York, obtained a grant from the Venezuelan Government for the exclusive working of a defined district, to be calle I "the mine of the Yurnary," for 60 years, at a royalty of 10 per cent. on the netproceeds,ant efforts were made to form a public company for its development with shareholders in New York, Paris, and London, the encouragement of immigration being also a foature of the project. Bt the disastrous termination of the various ,Californian and Australian gold companies was then fresh in the minds of all, and even if this had not been a sufficient obstacle the degraded character of the Venezuelan Government and its utter shamnelessness and bad faith in matters of finance would have entirely precluded European capitalists from joining any enterprise in that country. The produce-markets during the past week have assumed a more animated appearance. Sugar has again attracted the attention of speculators, an occasional decline of Is. accepted a few days back having proved merely temporary. The stock continues comparatively light, and the recent arrivals have not been large for the season. Considerable quantities of plantation Ceylon coffee, just landed, have been taken readily, both by shippers and the home trade, at an advance of is. to 2s. upon coloury kinds. Threa cargoes of St. Domingo and Rio have been disposel of for near ports at previous rates. Cocoa is agaia 3s. to 5s. higher for Trinidad, and a large business has taken place by private contract. For rice a speculative demand has sprung up at a recovery of 3d. to 6d. from the lowest rates current last week, which is attributed to the serious falling off in the shipments to this kingdom. The spice-market ham been steady, and the public sales have gone off without alteration in prices. Saltpetre remains dull, and the few sales effected shew a further sligit decline. There has been rather a better feeling in the tea-market, 2nd stne descriptions met with an improved demand for shipment. Good common congou has advanced to is. 04d. to Is. 1d. per lb. Large public sales are declared for Friday next. Advicos from Bogota to the 24th of April state that the Mackintosh queetion was either setted or on the point of being so, and that relations were about to be restored between the two Governments. lt is added that Don Juan delFrancisco Martin, who has resided for the list three or four years in Paris, is appointed Minister Plenipotentiarv from New Granada to the Court of St. Jame-s. He i3 a native of New Granada, and is said to enjoy a high reputation in his own country. The Catharine Adamson from Sydney, has arrived off Dartmouth, but her amount of gold remains to be ascertained. This vessel is statedto have made the passage in 69 days, the quickest on record, and her advices will be a fortnight later than thote previously received. The Commissioners of Customs have, on the application of Messrs. Cairns and Co., extended to Red Lion Wharf the privilege of landing, ep_ amining, and warehousing all foreign merchandlse except tobacco. This is the first time the privilege of landing silks, &c., has been extended to any wharf or place above London-bridge. Another order of the Board of Customs, made on the recommendation of Mr. Cockshott, Landing Surveyor, directs that in future British spirits bottled in bond may be exported in 12-gill bottles, instead of 5 1-3d-gill bottles, as heretofore. This will be a great advantage to those engaged in the spirit trade,, who, owing to the previous restriction as to size were very much obstructed in their competitiZI with the Dutch exporte to South Amorica. Under the law as it origially stood the Dutch could import into this country for the purpose of re-exortation, spirits in bottges of 12 gills each, whereas British spirits could only be exported in bottles cf 51-3d pills.

A NEW HYDRAULIC M&cEN-A boat, con- taining a curious apparatus, the invention of AL Louis Arnoux, of Marseilles, is now lying near the wharf of the Pont du. Carrousel. It is an engine for raising water, end more especially for pumping water out of vessels. Thecon trivanee, though new, is but the application oi an old prin ciple-viz., the production of a vacuum by steam. The apparatus consists of four cylinders closed by valves at the top; being made to communicate with the water to bo extracted, asufficientquantity of steam is successively introduced into each cylinder to expel the atmospheric air; no sooner is this effected tbau the steam is condensed by its contact with the cold water; a vacuum is produced, which causes the water to rush into the cylinder, and to issue from an aperture provided for the purpose. From experiments effected it appears that this engine will drain 31 cub-i metres of water per minute. As this appatus act by atmospheric pressure, it cannot raise water beyond an altitude of 32 feet - hbut this is sufficient to render it a valuable appendage to steamers when, in the case of leaks, steam may oe readily obtained from the boiler to produce the necessary vacuum and set it a-going, when it will perform its task much more readily than the ordinary pump.

LEY'S DIVORCE. ROTTAR1 Oli LORDS. JUNE 5. This was tha petition of Edward Ley, of Kent-cottage, Now Kent-road, Surrey, for an Act to dissolve his marriage with Rosanna Sarah Ley, his now wife, and to enable him toMar. j,gain. (with whom was Mr. J. Martin) saidi that he had the honour of appearing at their Lordships' bar on behalf of the petitioner, Mr- Edward Ley, who had been for sosae years engaged in commercial pursuits in partner. ship with Mr. Thomas Meadows, the father of the petitioner's wife, as an oil cooper. The parties were married on the 20th of January, 1852, at the parish church of St. Mary's, Nevington, in the county of Surrey, with the full consent of their parents, the ladv being 16 years old the petitioner 28. For the first two years-during which period they had one childafter their marriage they lived at Kent-cottage, in the New Kent-road, on terms of the greatest anfection and kindness. At the end of that time Mrs. Loy was confined of a second child prematurely, and then, in consequence of an internal complaint from which she was suffering, her medical adviser intimated that marital intercour6e must cease for a period. The husband accordingly slept in a separate bedroom, and he then found that his wife's affection for him was declining. He did not think there was anything serious, however, until he want in Aigust, 1854, to pay visit to hismother, who resided in Leicestershire. During hi absence his wife left his house, and returned to her parents. As soon as he discovered her absence he returned to London and went to see her, when, at the joint entreaties of himself and her parents, she consented to return to his house. She, however, only remained one night there, and Mr. LAy then took a house for her and their daughter at Twickenham, and made her an allowance of 1U. 15 per week for their maintenance. Mr. Lay frequently begged of her to return to his house and bed, or else to assign a reason for not doing' so. She refused to return, and her only reason was that she had taken a dislike to him, but it would be for their tordships to say whether sbe had not fixed her affections uPon some other person. Mr. Ley from that perlod had never seen his wife, excepting upon one occasion, at he had trusted and hoped that her love for her childand her respect for herself and her family would have prevented her from dishonouring his name. However, he had received information which resulted In his being convinced that his wife had been guilty of open adultery with a person named Launcelot Blagden Shutte, a Custom-house clerk, with whom she had lived publicly at 33, Doddington-goe, _Cennington, as man and wife. On the 11th of CYrh 1&56, Mr. Ley had brought an action in the Court of Queen's Bench against Mr. Shutte for criminal conversation vwith his wife, when a verdict was taken by consent for 1501., which smn to-ether with the costs, had been recovered. In December -inst the petitioner had obtained a divorce frombed and board, and he now sought for further relief at their Lordshipe hands. The following evidence was then adduced in support of the petitioner's prayer:- enry Weston, clerk to the petitioner's solioitor.-He knew vr Ly when she was living with her husband, That was about the middle of the year 1852. He lately served a copy of the Bill upon her. She was then living with jher uncle at London-waL. He produced an office co of the judgment roll from the Court of Queen's Bench. There was a verdict for the plaintiff for 150. The money was paid after a writ had been issued. He saw Mrs Ly In April, 1856. She was then living at Doddington-grovec The damages were laid at 1,0001. in the action. MaryWatkins Meadows.-I am the wife of Thomas Meadows, and the mother of the wife of the petitioner. I was present at their marriage at St. Mary's, Newington, in 1852. They were married according to the rites of the Church of Bngland. IMy daughter was 151 years old at the time of her marnage. They lived happily, so far as I could see, foz some time. There were two children born. My daughtcr suffered from some internal complaint after the birth of the second child. Her medical man made a communication to me, in consequence of which I spoke to Mr. Ley, and he ceased to occupy the same bedroom as his v-ie. Matrimonial intercourse ceased between them. Mr. Ley eingageda housekeeper during his wife's illness. Mr. pd hi mother a visit in 1854, when my daughter came I to our house and said she would rather live at home with us. We persuaded her to return to her husband. Mr. Ley returned to town and took a cottaga at Twickenham for her. That was in August, 1854. My daughter ws stiU ill, but was much better. Mrs. Lay and her child went to Twickenham. Mr. Ley stayed at his house in the Nevw Kent-road. Mr. Ley allowed her 11. 15s. per week. I visited my daughter, and Mr. Ley also went to see her. I can't say I heard him ask her to return to his house. At Christmas, 1854, Mr. Ley met his wife at n1 house, and asked her to go to Jersey with him. She said she would go as his companion, but not as his wife, I then advised her not to go under those circumstances. She had ben living separatefrom himformore than ayearatthat time. After this conversation about Jersey she returned to Twiokenham. In October, 18.55, Mr. Lay had his child home. I understood that he had requested Mrs. Ley to return home. The allowance was reduced to 11. per week after the child's return until March, 185, when it ceased altogether. By the Housx.-My daughter did not give any reason for her aversion to her husband. She did not complain of cruelty on his part. He was a young man; he is now 32 years of age. Thomas Meadows.-I am the father of the lady in question. I was present at the marriage of the parties, to rhich I gave my consent. They appeared to live happily for some time afterwards. I recollect my daughter going to Twiokenham. On one of my visits to that place I heard of Mr. Shutte being there, but I did not Bee him there. William Dabage.-1 am a surgeon in the New Kentroad. I attended Mr Ley in her confinement. I recollect her second confinement in 1853. Previously to the second confinement I had attended her for an internal complaint. I gave advice to her mother that marital intercourse should be discontinued for a timo. I did not say for how long a time it should be discontinued. After the confinement she got well, and there was no reason why that prohibition should have been continued. I communicated to the mother that she had recovered. I did not say that the intercourse might be resumed. I took it as a matter of course that it would be resumed. Ann Sammers.-I am the wife of Henry Summors, living In the Hackney-road. I am a dressmaker. I worked for Mrs Ley both before and after her marriage. The Ohristmas before last Mrs. Lay asked me to stay with her. That was at Doddington-grove, Kennington. I stayed there two months. Mrs. Lay was then living with Mr. Shutte. His Christnn name was Launcelot. They occupied the same bedroom. She passed by the name of Mrs. Shutte. They lived together all the time I was there. Sarah Hobbs.-I am servant to Mr. and Mrs. Meadows. In the early part of last year I was living as servant to a Mrs. Shutte. That lady afterwards acknowledged herself to be Mrs. Lay. Mrs. Ley occupied the same bedroom as Mr. Shutte, and slept in the same bed with him. I know Mir. Ley. He did not live at Doddingten-grove. Henry Packman, a milkman, living at Doddington-grove, Kennington.-In 1856 I supplied milk at 33, Doddingtongrove. The persons living there called themselves Mr. and Ars. Shutte. Afterwards Mrs. Shutte acknowledged that she was Mrs Ley at the EcolesIastical Court. Mr. Robert Ley, a solicitor, said he was the brother of the petitioner. Re had acted as attorney in the action in the Queen's Benoh. He had received the damages and costs. He had seen his brother and his wife living together. They lived very happily until after the second confinement. She did not evince the same kindly feeling for her husband after that. She was ill at that time. Mrs. Ley left her husband's house wheb he was on; a visit to his mother. He went to her mother's house. He tried to persuade her to return. She refused toreturn, saying that she had taken a dislike to her husband. He could get no reason for the dislike. He thought her mind affected. He did not know shen she first saw Mfr. Shutte. He had never heard of his name before these proceedings. His brother was very anxious to get her back; he was constantly talking about her. After the second confine. meilt they occupied separate bedrooms. The dislike she showed kept on increasing. Her husband had gone often for a few ays to his moter's house. He had never seen her since he had spoken to her at her mother's house. She was of a sullen temper. She acted towards witness in the same cold manner as she did to her husband. She did not act so to her mother. Mr. Weston was recalled to produce the certificate of the MrIa1%&CXAXsR said that the petitioner was present if their Lordships wished to examine him. The LORD CHASCELLOR said he saw no cause for further delaying the second reading of the BilL The fact of the adultery had been clearly proved, and the only question which could have arisen was as to the conduct of the petitioner in not being more decided in insisting upon his wife living vith him, as she ought to have done. He (the Lard Chancellor), howvever, did not tbink that there had been anything like collusion on the husband's Dart, and under these circumstances he should have no hesitation in advising their Lordships to read the Bill.n second time. The Bill was red a 6econd time accordingly.

APPEALS. I HOIUJ} OF LORDS. Tm.R ,; TMl OALEDONIA.N FtAVAILWAY CO0MPNY V. Lo1BD _ TLTAV- Lnelr 1Lrdships sat this morning for the purpose of hearIng the further arguments in this appeal from the decision of the First Division of the COurt of Sesion in Scotland, affirming a decision of the Lord Ordinary. - ' Sir F. Kelly and Mr. Rolt appeared for the appellants,-- and the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate repre. sented the respondents. The question involved in this case was whether Lord Bel. haven was entitled to work certain minerals 13 ing under a portion of the appellants' line of railway without giving security against any damage and loss he might cause the appellant6 by so doing. It appeared that the portion of the line in question had originally been intended for a 8imple horse tramway, which would not have been so likely to sustain injury from workings beneath it as the present line, upon which a large locomotive traffic was carried on. Lord Belhaven had given the land to the railway company, reserving to himself all the minerals beneath the soil. Under the company's Act the proprietors of the soil over which the line was to-pass had the power of reserving their right to the minerals, and were to be permitted to work them upon giviDg sufficient security to the company for any injury which might be caused to the line by so doing. Lord Belhaven had commenced working the minerals beneath the company's line without giving the required surety, and the company had then presented a note of suspension and interdict, equivalent to an application for an injunction, praying that Lord Belhaven might be compelled to discontinue his workings beneath their line. it was contended on behalf of Lord Belhaven that under the statutes now in existence he was entitled to work the minerals without finding security. The Lord Ordinary was of opinion that Lord Belhaven was entitled to work the minerals witbout giving security. This interlocutor being appealed from was affirmed by the First Division of the Court of Session. From the latter decision the present appeal was brought. Their LonDsrLps, in giving judement, said that the present question had been decided by the House in the case of " The Caledonian Railway Company v. Mark Sprot," and they were of opinion that the decision of the Court was erroneous, and must be reversed. Interlocutors reversed accordingly.
LAW REPORT. COURT OF CIACIRY. T,*iyv't.-, -r. T EX PARTE THE LONDON JOIT-STOuKo ? M K'I RE 'RATTITru-r (Rpf.^ir ho TlnYm Tn.., - - A to \ This appeal from a decision of Mr. Commissioner lIoroyd was argued on the 25th and 26th of May, and thon stood over for judgment. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Morray (of the common law bar) appeared for the appellant ; Mr. Daniel and Mr. Aspland supported the decision of the court below, Tho facts of the case were these :-The London JointStock Bank sought to prove against the bankrupt's estate for the sam of l,4231. lOs. for principal and interest due to the bank as endorsees for value of a bill of exchange dravn by Mlessrs. Rogers, Lowrey, and Co., and for their accomn. nodation, upon and accepted by the bankrupt.' In Febr 1855, MKessrs. Rogers and Co. compounded with their cre4i tors for Ls. ithe pound, payableby four instalments, the last being an instalment of 3s. in the pound, payable on the 18th of November, 1855. UJnder this and subsequent arrangements a sumn eauivalent to 14s. 9id. in the pound had been received at diBerent times in respect of the above mentioned bill from the estate of Messrs. Rogers and Co. Mr. Houghton became bankrupt in September, 1855, and the question now raised was wbether the London JointStock Bank was entitlod to prove as against the estate of Eoughton, the acceptor, for the full amount of the biU in their nands, limiting their right to receive dividends to the sum of 5s. 2nd. in the pound, the amount actuaUy due, or *hether the amount of proof should not be restricted to the sum actually due at the time the proof was made. In giving his judgment, llmiting the amount of proof to the smaller sum, Mr. Commissioner Holroyd said,- *I admit it may be difficult to understand the principle upon which the rule of bankniptc7 fs founded-namely, that vhre a part payment Iaa been rLceived before the proof istendered it operatesaz a olscharge pritgnto. hthe object seems to have been to rrevent aarty from reevn Sht ha hadnuojuttright to. Buttlie rule having been acted upon for more than 1l0 yars. it must be conaidered as tettied that the aum received umust be deducted from the full atmount of she deobt With reari tire rule of law I-do not think I ahbuld act upon that alone, and for this reason,-thai you cannot act in bankruptcy in all caesEas ~on may at law. Stil that rule has been In operationx for a grat port of the time during which the rule In bankruptcy ba heen in force az to bills of exchange." Lord Justice KNIGnT BvTic said that a biU of exchange was drawn by Messrs. Rogers and Co. on the bankrupt and accepted by him before the bankruptcy to the order of the drawers, and endorsed by them to the appellants. The bill was dishonoured on arriving at maturity, and certain tums were afterwards paid by the drawers to the appellants on account of the bill. The acceptor became banlkrpt some months afterwards,' and the appllants were admitted to prove for their debt, but not, as they contended, for a sufficient amount. The commIssioner reduced the amount by the sums received by the appellants, whilo the appellants claimed to prove for the whole amount of the bilL Now, it might not assist, but certainly it would not damage the case of the appellants to assume, as his Lordship did assumne, that on the whole state of the evidence, if there had been no bankrugptcy the acceptor, as between himself and the drawer, would tLe person primarily hable to pay. Still, the fact remained that the appellants had received from the drawers certain sums on account of the bill after It had arrived at maturity. According, therefore to the ge neralrule of bankruptcy, which was aiso a whoiesome and rational rule, the appellants were not entitled to prove for more than the balance after deducting the sums received Isy the claimantsfromper-gnsHiable,eitherdirecly orindirectly, for the payment; aud his Lordship did not see any reason to make this case an exception to the general rule, if that rule could have an exception. Ib was contended by the appellants that if there had been no bankruptcy the appellants might have brought an action at law, and would have been entitled to recover the whole amount vwithout deduct. ig any previous payments. Neither, however, by argument nor by the authorities cited at the bar was his Lordship con. vinced of the accuracy of this position; but, however that might be, the case here was in bankruptcy, in which the same rule did not always prevail as at law. On the whole, his Lordship was of opinion that the decision of the learned commissioner was in conformity with principle and precedent, aRd the appeal therefore failed. LordI Justice TuxNER added that ho was also of opinion that the decision appealed from was in conformity with the settled practice of thb Court of Bankruptcy, and that there was no reason for disturbing that practice. It was argued that if the acceptor had been solvent the appeUants might have recovered the whole amount of the bill at law and it was contended that the right in bankruptcy followed the right at law. It was not necessary to give any opinion as to the right at law, but for the present purposo his Lord. ship assumed that the appellants could have recovered the whole amount, but it did not follow that because there was a right to recover at law there was a right of proof in bankruptcy. The obligee of a voluntary bond could recover on it at law, but he could not prove in bankruptcy. So also a mortgagee of a bankrupt's esate could recover on his covenant at law, but could only prove for the deficiency in bankruptcy. If this were not so, the appellants' argument, to be followed to its legitimate conse. quence, must be that proof must be made for what was due from the bankrupt, and not for what was due to the creditor. It might be difficult to nnderstand how the rule of bankruptcy was settled; but the rule was settled, and his Lordship was of opinion that the grounds for disturbing it in the present case were unsound. The appeal, therefore, must be dismissed with costs. Their LORDSHIPS added that the case was of sufficient importance to be taken by apeal to the House of Lords, if the parties desired it, and their Lordships were wiUing to $ive their certificate to that effect Mr. BACON said that, as this case was one the decision of *hich would rule many others, probably the parties would dvail themselves of the considerate offer of the Court.

.VCE-CHANCELLOES' COURTS. Jux 5. WELLESLEY V. ir.RNNwT'rnr tzJeore vC Y-UanceUor Sir R. T. KtNvi)RRqT.wv- LADY MORNINGTON V. NVELLE sLRy. These causes now came on at the hearing , and on a ino. tion and petition. The billwas forthe spec'lic performance of a certain deed of trust, dated in 1834, under which J 62,0001. was to be raised to pay off ec.lumbrances, and the eshdproceeded to sell parts of the estates, the shbj ct. of th deed. The "etition was by Lord Wellesley, to carry those salesinto eflect, the Earl of Mornington lavin rWIsd the question whether they were fit and proper, ang ijnder those circumstances the trustees were unwillng to act except under the direction of tb3 Court. The motionL came aon under these circumstances:-Lor WeUesley was tntitled i#nder the deed in quetion to 46,0001. Qharge, and two an, ]Juities, one of 6,000I., and the other of 1601.?er anhitmi ' d in 1848 a hill was filod to get the earl ouit ofpossession, Laa r miver wax apontd with A direction to Cee down the encumbrances. He treated, and properly treated, as the I~1Abifft contended, the annuities as encumbrances, the accounts were regularly passed on that footing, allowing ~e rceier hos pamens. he nteeston the enoums.~ Master hesitated to allow the payments on account of the annuities, and this motion was for the purpose of having a direction that the receiver should be enabled to make them. Questions ha4 been raised on tLe construction of the trust deed; and it had been arranged that, inasmuch as the argaments in the cause, motion, and petition would be, in substance -the same, the whole case should be opened together. The plainiff, Viscount Wellesley, contended -that, he Was entitled in - priority to the conntess (who might boe consdered for this purpose to have got all the beneficial interest of the earl in the premises) in full, to the present and past income of 46,0001. and the annuities: At the time the deed was executed the position of the parties was this :-Upon the first marriage of the Earl of Mornington, with Miss Tylney Long, in 1812, large estates in Essex, Hampsbire, and Hertfordshire were settled by indenture, dated in 1813, upon the earl for life, with "remainder" to trustees for 1,000 years to raise portions for younger children, and with remainder, in the events which had happend, to Viscount Wellesley, in tail male * and there was a power to the husband and wife to charge the property with 100,0001. for any purpose they might think fit, and for the wife by will to n.arge to the amounn of 50,0001. The property was so charged by the husband and wife, and by the, wife, both chargesbeingin favour of the earl; but he having the beneflcial interest in those charges, mortgaged them to the full amount in various modes, by way of aniuities, -judgments, &c, and all the income was thereby absorbed. Lord Wellesley had an independent estate, on which the 46,0001. was a charge, but a part of the consideration for the deed in question was that that charge should be thrown on other estates, the aggregate amount necessary to carry that ayrangement into effect being about 462,0001. Subject ,thereto, the estates were limited in trust for the earl for life, with remainder to the plaintiff in fee if he survived the earl, but if not to the plaintiff in tail, with remainder to the earl in fee. The questions, therefore, had arisen between the earl and the vscount. The earl havlng by a separation deed with the countess covenanted to settle lO01. a-year upon her, she proceeded against him upon tis instrument in 1850, and the Court decided that she was entitled to a charge on the earl's interest, and directed him to.make a settlement,in pursuance of it ; but the countess had never taken any steps to get a receiver, which the plain. tiff (the viscount) had done in 1848. The -present income was not sufficient to keep down the viscount's prior charges. The deed recited the settlement of 1813, and dealt with certain Irish estates, which had been limited to Lord Maryborough for life, remainder to Lord Mornington for life, and then to the plaintiff absolutely ; and there was a charge of 100,0001., raisable after Lord Maryborough's death, and a charge of 12,0001. by Lord Maryborough in favour of the Earl of Delawarr. The Irish estatea only realized 80,000Z., and in 1834 the plaintiff took Dro. ceedings in Ireland to get a receiver apRointed. re plaintiff was likewise entitled to property m Wilts and Yorkehire under the will of. Mr. Tylney Long, subject to a charge in favour of the two daughters of the testtor ef 40,0001., and the annuities on the estates being du*ing the joint lives of the earl and viscount, and still existing andl on the death of Lord Maryborough, which took I e in. 1845, an additional annuity of 6,0001. was paid t the viscount, and a dtsentailing deed a executed, limiting hie estates to the joint appointment of father and sOn, the earl and the plaintiff; sand the estates by the deed in question were vested in two gentlemen named Wright and Green, as trustees (now represented by Colonel Howard and another gentleman as new trustees) upon trust, by sale or mortgage, as they should think fit, to levy or raise the whole,sum of 462,000., which was to bear interest until raised The sum required was borrowed, as the plantiffs contended on account of the earl, which was not admitted by him. Among the encumbrances was one to a Mr. Thompeon, who had a power of ale in his mortgage deed, and gave notice that he should sell accord. ingly, and the plaintiff purchased the earl's interest, under the power of sale, for 20,0001. Large sums still reained to be raised. the income was ins'fficient by 5001. -year to keep downvthe interest, and an injunction had been obtained against the earl to restrain him from committing waste by felling timber and from lettn at premiums, but that injunctloh had been disobeyed. The second suit wa in the nature of a cross bill, filed by the Countess, as an encumbrancer on the earl's interest, for an account of the dealings with such portion of the 462,0001. as had been raised, and for ascertaining what interest the earl now had, to substantiate her charge upon such interest, Upon these facts the plaintiff aked that such trusts of the trust deed of 1834 as remained unperformed might be carried into execution, and that the annuities might be paid to him by the trustees. This claim was altogether resisted by the countess and the earl, the countess insisting that the general amounts ought to be taken, upon which it would appear that considerable in. tereBts still remained in the earl in the estates upon which her charge could be made good * the earl and countess both contending that at aU events the payment of the annuities ought not at present to be made to the plaintiff. The earl had evidently suffered considerably by the non-raising of the whole 462,0001, which ought to bear interest ; and whatever had been the conduct uf the parties, the question was now in a position to be discussed irrespective of al that had taken place in that respect, and on the dry question of the deed itself. * Mr. Baily, MEr. Glasse, and Mr. Nalder appeared for the plaintiff; MIr. Haolt and Mr. PFreeling appeared for the C ountess of Mornington; Mr. Cairns and Mfr. D)ruce appeared for the Earl of h[ornington; Mfr. G. xf Giffard' for [ the trustees.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~'h Mr. BAILY was heard in reply on behalf of the plaintiff; Mr. FRTIaNG oU behalf of the countess. The VICE-CHANCELLOR said that the first question was on the construction of the deed, whether the whole or part of the 462,0001. should bear interest; the earl contending that the whole ahould bear interest, and the countess that interest should be payable only on the surplus. It appeaed to his Honour incredible that such an important thing should have been omitted in the deed, considering that it was drawn by a gentleman of the greatest experience, when not the veriest tyro would have committed such an error. His opinion, therefore, was that it wa not intonded, and did not bear interest. Was there, then, any equity, ir. respective of the deed, that the whole or an part cf that sum should bear interest? It appeared to his Honour thero was not. All that he (the Vice-Chancellor) should do was to express his opinion on the different points, leaving those matters to be made the subject of minutes aB counsel might arrange. His Honour then -eferred to a charge on the Irish and Southampton estates of 31,000L, which he thought bore interest, and that the surplus, subject to the payment of the plaintiffs annuities, belonged to the earl, or the countess In his shoes, who were not barred by what had taken place to a rightto an account. With respect to the question of Lord Wellesley's right to have the deficiency in payment of the annuities out of the rents supplied from the corpu, he should express no opinion, but there must be a general inJu&whether, after payment of all the charges out of the 46 . 2., any surplus would remain. Then, as to the sales, and the parts of the estates to be sold, to raise the remainder of that sum. It was said that the trustees were the proper vendors, and that there was a sale without their concurrence. It would be difficult to say, however, that the trustees were tot bound; but there must now be inquiries as to what had taken place, and thepropriety of future sales. The Irish estates were not subject to the trust, but only the charge of 100,0001. on them ; and, if the Irish estates had not pro. duced 100,000 pence, the deficiency did not affect the rights of the parties in other respects. Althougb the 462,0001. was liable to pay the interest of charges, yet that iiust be recouped out of the rents. There must be some inquiries8en that respect. Without determining the question whether the power of leasing in theearl was subsisting or not, no order would be made upon it. No order could at present be made as to payment of the 6,0001. a-year to the iplaintiff, nor of the 1,00I. a-year to the countess; that is, ihere could be no extension of the order to the receiver to keep down the encumbrances pending the taking of the accounts. There munt be some enquiries as to the repairs and what leases had been granted, and with those inquiries the matter stands for the present, Solicitors for the plaintiff, Messrs. Coverdale, Lee, P and Collyer; for the Countess of Mornington, Mfr. J. Wickens; for the Earl of Mornington, Messrs. Cates and Son; for the trustees, Messrs. Clayton and Cookson.

This case came on by way of general demurrer to the bill, by which the plaintiff sought for specific performance of an agreement entered into between himself and the defendants for the formation of a joint-stock company, and for a decree directing the defendan^ts to take all necessary steps for the registration and incorporation of the company, pursuant to end in accordance with the memorandum of association and artiClesof association mentioneid in the bill, and rto do aii other necessary acts for cari-g th-eag`r-ee`nent and articles into effect. The case, &-asraeged by the bill, was that the plaintiff, being entitled to certain patents for improvements in the manufacture of bottles, pots, jas, tubes, &c., and being unable himself to work the inventonsthrogh ackof funds, entered into negotiations being signed, whereby they all agreed to unite as members of a joint-stock company, under the name or style of " The Patent Corporated Mlineral Company, Limited." This agree. mjent contained several other terms,escuring to the company the patents in question, for which certain sums and other benefits were to be paid and secured to the plaintiff out of the capital and profits, and, among other thP gs, the plain tiff contracted to take any proceeding required of him by the company at the company's ex use to obtain other p tents en foreign countries which sZould belonig to the com-; pany; and, further, that he would, also, at the request the company, and so long aa thxe company should desire, hot exceeding two years, devote his time to the mannffacture of the patented production and engaBe himself holly for the company to promote Its interets in every ossible way, and to use all his skill in improvements lm working the patent process; and also that if at asy time during - the continuance of the iatent the plaint shoid discover or come to the knowledge of any imp rovement ornewinventionrwhich should be applicableto the p,atentprocess intended to be worked by the company the ;antifb should hbeound to impart and mako over to the company such invention or improvement, upon payment of a proper oompenaaton Several meetings took place betlv,en the parties, and eventuaUyamemorandumof afoi^ tion and articles of asciation were drawn u and sigped by l thedefendants except one.

Cairns ancl Mr. Cotton suapported the demurrr, and :Mr. Bolt and Mr. W. A. Collins appeared for tho plaintiff. The VIcE'CuAxcELon, withouE calling for a reply, said that the bildl could not be sustained. 'If this had been an agreement by which in consideration or the assignment by the plaintiff of hirpatent the defendants had agreed to form a registered company ampti,iter, there might possibly in such a case be no difficulty EO great as to prevent this Court from interfering. Bnt this was not the casm. It was impossible to sever tho agreement into two parts. It was all one entire contract whereby the parties agreed to form the company, with additional terms Jor insuring certain benefits to the plaintiff, in consideration of his agreeing to do certain specific things for the company when formed, none of which provisions would be properly inserted in the deed of partnership. Assuming the company to have been actually incorporated at the time the contract for these several provisions had been entered into the contract was clearly one whiel the Court could not 6ae enforced, because there was no power in the Court to compel the plaintiff himself to perform his part of the agraement, which consisted in his rendering services to and devoting his time and labour for the benefit of the company -matters over which the Court could exercise no controM The case of a party entitled to a negative covenant coming for an injunction to restrain the covenantor from breaking it stood on a perfecty intelliglble, footing. There the very terms on which the Court granted such an injunction were that the party seeking it should act up to and perform his part of the agreement; and if it was shown to the Court that he failed to do so the Court always had the power of dissolving the injunction, and thus doing complete justice between-the parties. But if Mr. Stocker, the plaintiff in this case, should obtain the decree asked for by his bill, and then decline to carry out what he had contracted to do, how could the Court deal with him ? If the rarties had agreed to execute a. partnership deed, in which there should De inserted the several provislons embodied in the existing contrac, that might have been a different case and the Court maight have decreed execution of the deed; but this was not so. There was no such agreement, and in this respect the ob6ervationi of Lord St. Leonard's, in the case of "Jervis v. Edwards " (2 Drury and Warren), were precisely in point. There were other difEiculties in the case, some of which were suggested in argument and some by the Court, arising out of what might be done by the directors and members of the companythemselves when incorporated as to the transfer of shares, refusal to act, and otherwise, but which difficulties it was not necessary to enter into. The demurrer must be allowed on the grounds before ad, verted to, and the costs must follow the reult.
COURT OF QUE1 BENO Wx umJn . 3im' ! ALDRIDGE V. JTnmcnv- 1tMMzga s7 .sanco, oejoT rcj UAMPBELL and JuStiM CoLxxX, ERLr, and CnomPTow) -Tihs wasa special case for the opinion of the Court, and which raised the question whether the plaintiff had a right of property in certin goods, and, secondly, whether there ha been a conversion of the goods by the defendant. The defendant had entered into an agreement with a person named }Knights for the sale of some bullocks, for which he wasto receive a quantity of barley in payment. The bullocks were delivered, and the plaintifff saw the bulk of barley out of which his sacks were to ba filled, and was satisfied with its quality. A portion of the 'barley was put into 155 saeks, but the rest remained in bulk, when the plaintiff sent orders to have the barley sent to him. The harlel was not sent, but was again taken out of the sacks by Knights, who became banruapt. The defendant, who was the official asignee, then took on of the barley. Mr. BxrvmxLsro was h or the plaintiff and hir. FnNTc for the defendant. Lord CAMPBELL said he iras of opinion that the proy which remained in bulk wuas not vested in the plaintifirfor it was clear that til there was an appropriation by. the vendor and accptance by the purchaser the property was not transferred. Therefore, so far as that part of the barley was concerned, judgment mnst be given for the defendant. But as to the 155 acks judgment must be given for the plaintiff, for as soon a the barley was put into the sacks with the plaintiff's assent the property was transferred. It wasa wrongful act of this bankrupt to take the corn out of the sacks, but the plaintiff was no party to that. The defendant had denied the title of the owner, and claimed tho 'whole as the property of the banlkrupt, and in so doing he had converted the plaintiff's property. The other JUnOXS were of the same opinion. Judgment accordingly. HOWELL (VZSmY COLERK OF ST. GEORGES-nI1THT EAST) V. TER LONDON DOCK COMPANY. This wasa special casefor the opinion of the Court Tho vestry of St. George's-in-the-East, appointed under tha Metropolis Local MAnagement Act (the 18th and 19th Victoria, cap. 120), had made an order on the trustees of the panish to levy the sum of 6,000. upon the whole pariah for generalpurposes. The trustees of the parish, appointed under a local Act, accordingly made si rate, and assesed the London Dock Company in the sum of 3,0634 in respect of their occupation of land and propery situate sin the parish. The compay admitted their liability to be rated in respect of the wharfs and warehouse, but they disputed their liability to be rated in respect of the " quar and basins," which formed about three-fourths in value of the dock property. The rate in queston was made for general purposes, but one-half of it, or about 3,OOO, had been incunTred for paving the streets of the parish. The company contended that they darived no benefit from this expenditure, at least so far as the qaays and basins wereS concezaed. IrnderaLoa InlPaving ActIthe 17t GeorIm cap. 22)b and also under the General aving Act (the 57th L eorge 11L, cap. 29), the company had been held to be rateable to the paving rate in respect of the warehoues and wharfs opening mto and adjoining the publio *treets, but noti in respect of the quays and basins. It was therefore submitted to the vestry that as the expense of paving had been incTrred for the special benefit of a particular part of the parish, and not for the equal-benefit of the whole, it was the duty of the vestry to exercise the power vested in them by the 159th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, and exempt the dock company from liability to be rated in respect of the yuays and basins. The section referred to enaots that ' where it apytmrs to any vestry or district board that aU or any part of the expenses for defra ng which any sum is by such vestry or board ordered to ho levied as aforesaid bave or has been incurred for the special benefit of any par. ticular part of their parish or district, or otherwise have or has not been ncurred for the equal benefit of the whole of their parish or district, such vestry or board may by any such order direct the sum or sums necessary for defraying such expenses or any part thereof to be levied in such part, or exempt any part of such parish or district from the levy, or reqmire a less rate to be levied thereon, as the circumstances of the case may require." The v stry came to a resolution that the expenses in quest:on had not been Inenrred for the special benefit of any particular part of the pariah, bnt had been inourred for the equal beneft of the whole panish - and they resolved that the dock company were not entitied to any exception, and that the poor-rate assesgment was the only basis of assessment for the whole parish. Upon this refusal of the vestry to grant the exception an action was brought, and a speca case was stated for the opinion of the Court, with a view to raise the question whether the rate ought to be made upon all the property in the parish, or whether the dock company were entitled to the exemption claimed. Mr. PAsELLry, Q.C. (with whom were Mr. J. Brown and Mfr. Huddleston), was heard for the plaintiff; and Sir F. KrEuY (with whom were Mr. Grove, Q.C., and Mr. Bittleston) for the defendant. Lord CA3wB?enL said it seemed to be a great hardEhi that the company, who paved all that part of the parish which they occupied, should also be called upon to pay towards the paving of the rest of the parish; but there was some difficulty in saying that the vestry were bound to gran the exemption. The Court would take time to (Swsngs at NMir Prius at GuildWTl4 before Mr. Justie W wm&x and a Common Jury.) SAINSBURY V. SMiT AND OTEURS. MLr. Edwin James and lr.

This was an action brought by the author of a work illustrating French history against the defendants, who were bookbinders in Long-acez, to recover the value of certain of these books, which had been sent to the defendants to be bound, filleted, tooled, Ac., and which, it was alleged, had, through the neglect of the defendants, been much injured, ancd some lost. ft appred that the book was very valuable, containine fac-sIm esof the autoraphs of most of the parties who flourished or eminent n aris and Franoe during many years, from Louis XIV. and particularly during the re-in of Napoleon L The selling price was 251. a-copy. The workak d taken 40 years to compile. The amount now claimed was 6004. According to the plaintiff's statement 189 copies of the work (250 had been printed) were sent to the defendants to be bound in 1840. They were returned in wrappers, and the plaintiff did not look at them for seven years. He then sent 175 of them back to be "filleted and tooled." The books remained in the defendants' possession for some years, andwere:then retumed to the plaintiff,as he aerted, in an injured and mutiated state, and eight of them were missing; those returned were, in fact, valueles. He made a claim on the defendants, one of whose firm, according to ihe plaintifi's evldence, treatedhim so rudely that he left the premises. In cross-examination the plaintiff said he had only sold six copies, but he had iven a great many away, had lent out several, and had loft four with the French embasy. Napoleon IIL had one. The defence ws that the whole were retmrned, and that they were in a perfece condition when they left the defendante' premises. The result of the evidence for the defendants was that the whole number had been eent back to the plaintiff, and th*t when they, left their premises they were In a perfect stte.

The p laintiff sid he could not take it back,-he must be paid, and then, if he sent it back, he would give him sherry to the amount. Mr. Smith said he should ike some diamondasherry at 42as, as he and Mrs. Smith averaged a bottle a-day. Some time afterwards the plaintiff received two dozen and a half of champagne bclk, but no money. An action was then brought, and after some time an arrnge. mentwas cometo, and the plaintiff was so much pleased thathe invited Mr. Smithandsome friends to agood dinner, and he gave them some of his best wine. The next day it was expected that the money and the costs would be paid, but a delay took plaoe about the coate, and something was said about it not bein right for "dog to eat dog," but the debt was to be paid. The defendant was written to for the money, but instead of that arriving several pleas were sent, and thus the cause came into court. Tha plaintiff proved these facts.

The case of the Celerity wa -that about 7 p.m. of -the 3d of Jinuary l ast she wa abreasd of Goldiners Gatway, at the lower part of the Gunfleet Sad, on a oge from the North Sea with a corgo of fish for the Londmonmarket-; that the evenin*gwa very- deer, and the moon shining very brightly; that b reason of the wind blowing hard from south-weat by south she was hove te iiorder to eef her mainsail and lay nearly dead on the water; that at sch time the red light of a steamer (the Cit of London)-was seen, liu open on the strboard bow, distant aboxt two miles, and steering est by north, which coure would have cleared the smack, but that in about six minutes afterwatds the temer altered her oourse to the north-.4 by north, exposig her:green light to view and coming direct for the smack; that the smackle' mnuter lashed the helm aport, and, with the crew, ran forward and hailed thb steamer to rort her helm; that no notice was taken thereof, and the steamer, hortly afterwards with hei port sponson struck the smac with gret violence on the starboard aide of her stern; that in two minutee.the smack -wentdown and two of her crew were lost; that the steamer was going at the rate of at least 12 miles an hour through tbe water, and, with a strong ebbtide, waagoing atthe rate of 14 miles an hour over the ground, and was - not stopped until the was half a mile from the laoe of -ollision; that the col. lision was attributable solely to te steamer, and that the smack wsw lyig deadon the water with her mainsail down, and oould not get out of the way of the steamer in time to avoid the oollision. The detenoe of the steamer was that she did all in her power to avoid the collsion by porting her helm and stopping her engines as soon as the smack wa seen that the steamer kept a good and careful look ont and saw the mack as soon as she could be seen; that the smack was lying hove to and end on, and had no 1 ght exhibited; that if a light had been exhibited by the simack those on board the steamer would have seen her iu sYfficient time to avoid the cotllsion, and that the smack's -aster admitted afterwards that he did not exhibit a light because he had not one handy, and beause he did not think it necessary to do so. The responsive plea of the smack was that b reason of the clearness of the night and the brightness of the moon the oollision was not and could not have been caused. by the omission of those on boad the smack to exhibit alight.

Dr. LUS=GTON (summing up tothe Trinity ers)'With respect to the collision ia question an investigation has taken place by direction of the Board of Trade; but whatever may be the result it cannot possibly govern this Court. It is impossible to say upon what evidencethe decision of the Board of Trade may have been founded. This Court can look only to the pleadings and evideuce produced beforeit. It is desirable in. consideru this to keep the conduct of the two vessels quit distinct There is no dispute as to the place, the wind, or state of the night. It is admitted to have been a bright moonlight night; the smack was hove to, reefing her mainsail, and the steamer was proceeding, according to the admission of her matter, about 11 miles an hour. On the part of the ateameritiz ii evidence that she had four persons on the look out, and the question arises why, if these persons were really looking out, she did not see the smack sooner than she did, and in sufficient time to have avoided the collision. The reason given by the witnessesisthat the CelerityisasmalUvesel, her sails are new. andthe moon shone brightly on them, so that she could not have been descried earlier, as she exhibited no light; therefore the case of the steamer is that a far as she is concerned it was an inevitable accident, yet one of their witnesses says, "If the mowas hining on the back ot hereal Iaooldse a brg under wya long dlstase, but Ir shining iu the frootof hor sails coul see i, o dsnoe; I oQuld ee hm ull, bsut ficoulrio shoot 2hal-amBaoro could see a brig at anchor wlthoetX So that they saw the hull before they saw the sails, and the question is whetherthey did not see, or whether they might not have een it in sufficient time to have taken the proper steps to avoid the oollision, provided a proper look Oat had been kept.

(Before Mr. Commi.noner Evws.1 Mr. LAWRANCUE, for tho bankrupt lately rn cirector of the EasteunBanldng Corporation, applied fo ,An enlargement vf tine for hi surender, and put in ai letter from mrs.

Mi. IINILAxur, for to assignees, without directly tepposimg the apication,> U11Aed the attention of the Court *to ctzoum.6tancoe in the ioase. Colonel Waugh was vezy largely in debt, and the rapidity with which he left the *cointry was eot comptible with the very serious illness Inoir alleged. They hed not even the evidence of his own 'oath thaft?E was ignornt of the proceedings under his bnkruptey. 1K he -had - sw.orn that he had no knowledge of his bankrupty at the time he left the country, that he had since bvan ilL and-the. he intended to come back, the Ceurt would probably bevinclited to accede to the appliction. This,however, -was-not affirmed; and even the affidavit of thermedical man; w, now furnished, showed that he had not seeii Colonel WnauBa for six weeks. If the Court enlarged -the time for sur ender it would doubtless intimate its opinion that no further enlargement would be permitted, excoept upon 'filing affidavits of the most stisfactory character. The Comtrnssmo .-If any good is to be got by re'fusing the application I will refuse it. Mr. In"-ATER feared that at present evil rather than good might result from so decided a course. The COrISesOrNoR.-I will enlarge the time for surrender to the 30th of this month only. There is no aflidavit from the-bankrupt himself, and the medicalcertidcateisvery Vague. Ma: LXWVRANCE asked that oertan papers belonging to Mrs. Waugh, taken possession of by the assignees at Branksea-castle, might be given up. The CoMmIssioNER.-The assignees must act in the matter on their own judgment and responsibility. I cannot make-any order. The time for surrender was then enlarged to the 30th instant, IN RE STRAHAN, PAUL, AND BATES. The bankrupts were the notorious bankers in the Strand. .A question arose as to what estate property belonged. The official assignee stated that he was about to receive 'tho purchase money for Park ChapeL There was a debt due from the chapel to the bank; on the other hand, 'the chapel wras alleged to be the private property of Sir John PauL -Mr. LAwRANCi for the assgnees, and Mr. LrxKLATER for the creditors under the private estate, agreed that the assets should not be apportioned without notice. IN 551 J. JOHNS. The bankrupt was an innkeeper of Hertford. This was 'the certificate meeting. 'Mr. Debenham, for the assignee;, did not oppose ; Mr. -nArnstrong supported. His HONOUR awarded a second-class certificate. IN Rn PARRY AND PARRY. The bankrupts were builders in Houghton-street. This was a meetingtoexemine William Henry King, with - aview to obtain from tue Court an order upon him to deliver to the assignees a sur of money. It appeared from his examination that he had been a solicitor until about seven years ago. He had ever since been the managing clerk of Mr. John Cambridge Fisher, solicitor. T'he body of the deed produced was written by himself. The signature thereto was not, he believed, in Fisher's hand. writing. The deed was anu signment datedOctober, 1856, .for the benefit of creditors. He (gingi was the trustee uinder the assignment, and he had employed his employer (Fisher) In the matter. He held in his hands 971. lO3. 61. as the balance undor the assignment. This was exclusive of 171. paid to the bankrupts and a sum charged for Mr. Fisher's costs.

Mr. MURROUGH (for tho assignees).-Only one creditor dor 10l has signed the deed. There can be no objection to his taking the beneficial interest under it. The witness said that this ceditor had been paid his lOs. Sn the pound, but there wwore Mrs. Windle and other credi. -tors. Mrm Windle was a creditor for a considerable sum. Me had been served that morning with notice from creditors not to pay over the monoy Mr. MURItOU4GI.-Mrs. Windle is a poor washerwoman. 'She has stated so; 601. odd has beean already paid for this -deed. Mr. King said he would pay the moiey on reoeiving an indemnity. Mr. MURROUGHI objected.-If an indemnity were given -he assignees might be subjected to harassing proceedings and costs in Cbancery. The COaWrSRIONER sald he should wish to be furnished 'with a copy of the deed and the assignment, that he might examine their-contents. Mr. MURXROUGH suggested that Jhe original deod should be retained, and the required copy furnished by an otihcer of the court. The COilUrSJONER said he did not see wbat pretence -there was for retaining the money. Only one creditor had signed the deed, -and he 'had been paid. His opinion was -that Iiing would ultimately be -cmpelled to give up the money. He would however, on boing furnished with the -copies referred to, adjudlcate on the matter on the 18th of -June, when he and Risher must again attend.

A tolerk from'the General Post-offlce identified the four railings as being the property of the Crown, and a portion of a number which had been removed from the interior of the building and placed in the yard. They were worth Is. each. No communication on the subject had been made to the Pos-office authorties, and the prisoners were remanded to await their decision. MAIReRouGH-ms =sr.-John Greenfield, 10, Hayes. court, greengrocer, was charged with attempting to cut the throat of his wife, 3liza Greenfield. The wife said she had been married to the defendant for about seven years, during which period he had constantly ill-wsed her. About 3 o'clock that morning he came home drunk and swore he would cut her throat. She begged him to spare her, but he dragged her upstairs, and taking a knife from a table drew it across her throat. She pnt up her hand, and thus saved her life, as the back of her hand was cut across. She made her escape from the room and screamed "Murder," when assistance came, and the defendant was secured. PoHce-constable Bowley proved that he heard murder called, and saw the complainant bleeding from the hand. She told him her husband had attempted to cut her throat. Mr. BINGn.&m sent the defendant to prison for six months. WORSUIP-STREET.-Mar YVickers was charged upon remand with a street robbery. It is necessary to give a word of repetition of this case to understand what now followed:-About a week ago an elderly widow lady named Weston was accosted by the prisoner, who then bore a very respectable appearance and was leaning on the arm of a young man equally well dressed, and they inquired the shortest road to George.street, Islington. The prisoner kept the old lady in conversation eome time, by affecting not to understand her, and when she seemed to do so at last, and she and her confederate walked rapidly away, Mr Weston recollected she had felt a slight pressure at her side, and on feeling for her gold watch found that it had been twisted off at the swivel and stolen, her chain still hanging round her neck The two thieves then parted, and Mrs. Weston grasped the collar of the man and clung to him with much pertmacity, but his streneth was too great for her to cope with, and he wrenched himself away and escaped from her, leaving Mrs. Weston exhausted, breathleEs, and one of her arms nearly twisted out of its socket. The determined old lady, however, was not to be baulked, and on finding the man, who evidently had her watch, was beyond her reach, she set off after the prisoner, who was taken in the pasge of a house in an adjoining street, to which she had obtained admittance by the stratagem described at this hearing, and to obtain evidence of which she was remanded. The prisoner, on being now placed at the bar, became greatly excited, cried and sobbed continuously', repeatedly entreated mercy, and as esch fact. was given against her kept saying, " Oh, don't! oh, pray don'tl" HIer appearance was wonderfully altered from what it was at the last examination. She then had a fresh, cool, selfpossessed air about her, and was dressed in a large and handsome sik or satin mantle, whereas she was now thoroughly downcast, disarranged, and wore a small checkered shawl, which greatly altered her identity. Mrs. Mary Car,penter said,-I live in Little John-street, HIoxton, and at a o'clock on the afternoon of the robbery the prisoner, as I believe, ran breathlessly into my house. and asked me for a draught of water. She said she had had words with her husband, whom she had struck first, and being conlvinced he was following and would Duse her, asked me to let her out at the back wy. A mob gathered round the house, and I was tellingher she could not pet out at the back, cs there was no way there, when the police and prosecutrix came up and charged her with robbery. She was at that time dressed in black, and looked quite different from what she does now, hut I beleve her to be the same woman. Prosecutrix.-She is the same woman ; I can swear she is the same woman who robbed me, but she then had on a mantle, I think a black silk, or it might be cloth, and she looks different altogether in this littie shawL Alderman, the gaoler.-The governor of the prison has sent a message to your worship that this Prisoner has been convicted two orthree times already for sich robberiee,and, is indeed a notorious thief. I think it proper to mention, in explanation of the alteration in the prisoner's appearance, that the sergeant of the police van had formerly the assistance of an extra constable, whose business it was to constantly watch the prisoners, prevent any communication with them, and be in some measure answerable, together with the sergeant, till the prisoners were delivered to the police on duty at the court, who brought them across the charge-room to lodge them in the cells. By some new regs. lation the sergeant has been deprived of this man, and has to do the duty himself; and the consequence Is that great facility is afforded to prisoners to get rid of any wearing apparel or other articles which would confirm identification on their leaving the van to be transferred to my custody. In this instance the prisoner tells me that on leaving the van this morning she flung her martle to her mother, who was in the crowd surrounding the vehicle, and received this shawl in exchange, which in most cases tends greatly to prevent a satisfactorv identificatimnn Air. HAMMLL concurred in the observations of the gaoler, and, having directed the van-sergeant to make a report of the circumstances, the depositions were completed and the prisoner fully committed for triaL UInBEr-Mary Cownden, a middle-aged married woman, was charged before the Hon. G. C. NORTOw with attempting to oommit self-murder, by swallowing a quan. tity of laudanum. Police-constable William Verrils, 142 L, deposed that about half-past 6 o'clock on the preceding evening his atten. tion was drawn to the prisoner, whom he found lying near the distillery of the Messrs. Hodges, with her face downwards. On taking her up he found an empty phial under her, which had evidently held laudanum. He conveyed her without delay to Guy's Hospital, where the necessary means were used to counteract the poison, and when sufficiently recovered he took her to the workhouse for the night. On her way to the court on that morning the prisoner said she had swallowed two two pennyworthl of laudanum, and she wvas sorry the dose was not stronger, to have finished her, and that she should take care that it should he stronger the next time. Since he had taken her into custody he learnt that she had been at this court about six months ago on a charge of attempting to drovn herself, and had also been frequently In custody on charges of drunkenness. Cook, the gaoler, said, this was perfectly true, and that all was owing to her thirst for drink. Her husband who was a most respectable man, was obliged to leave 6er in consequence of her continued drunkenness, but at the same time was uilling to do anything for her, but all his efforts and those of her friends were not sufficient to restrain her from her love of drink and drunkenness. Mr. NORTON observed, that it was perfectly shockdng to find the increasing love of drink and almost habitual drinkenness among the middling classes, and remanded the prisoner to a future day for the attendance of her husband and friends. Thomas Harrison, alias Goulding,was finally examined on a charge of stealing from the person of Mr. Thomas Shelton, a merchant in the city, a valuable gold watch on the "Derbpy" night. From the evidence it appeared that while the prosecutor was passing through a dense crowd of persons in front of the Elephant and Castle on the night in question the .pi'Roner snatched the watch out of his pocket, and was about ,to bolt with it. The prosecutor, hLowever, instantly colared bids, and finding thPat hebaÃ¯Â¿Â½d no hope of ewsape he dxe~ed he atc at is eet an itwas fortunately recovered by the proEsGustor.ye Tpe prisoner 'was committed nder the Summary Justice Set-tosu monthe hard labour in Wandsworth Eouse of

THE COMING GPJAT COONBES3. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As so ninny thousandsformtheir judgmentof public matters almost wholly from what they read day after day in She Times, it would be difficult adequately to estimate the influence which you exercise on the national mind. I feel assured, therefore, that you would regret that influence beinD vwrongfully used to the detriment of large bodies of the pecp e, who bavo everything both to hope and to fear from the right or wrong direction of public opinion-with whom, in short, it is a questien of comparative happinems or misery whether the feeling of the community ls turned against or in favour of any efforts that may be maldng to ameliorate their condition. Now, as certain remarks which occur in your Tuesday's "leader" on the subject of the approaching "Congress" on education are of a nature likely to create an erroneous impression relativetothe early closing movement I must hope tat you wiU allow me space to say a few words in reply. In the first place, it is stated that such is the pro already made by this movement that " in summer, long before sunset, London looks almost like Sunday," &c. Now, in reference to this point, it cannot be denied that as the result of an arduous and long-sustined struggie, large masses of the people have been rescued from a condition of servitude but too suggestive of the unchristian doctrine that they existed for no higher purpose than " to work, to eat, to sleep, and to die." But it is not the less a fact that there are yet other numerous sections of society who are even now borne down by excessive and unnecessary labour. Take, for instance, chymists' assistants, shopmen generally in low neighbourhoode, omnibus servants, journeymen bakers, and dressmakers' and milliners' assistants. And I would here remark, that-excepting in the case of Saturd vrhich must universally b made an early day if t!he Sabbath is to be even deoently observed-7 o'clock in winter and 8 o'clock in summer are the hours at which those conducting the movement desire to see retail business suaspended. It wil thus appear that their aim Is not to carry early closing aaywhore to an extreme, but rather to extend as far as practicable to all sections of the industrial classes that reasonable amount of leisure which, through the liberality of enmployers, has already been conceded to cer. tain of those sections. Referring to the subject of the employment of this extra time, I desire to state tbat the committee of management have from the first been deeply impressed with the imp ort. ance of this point. But, looking at the constitution of the and the commands of Scripture, that men hould "get wisdom" and "understanding," the committee have ever felt that they were but carrying out God's designs in securing for the rising generation opportunityto cultivate their faculties, believing, at the same time, that those who should,, unhappily, abuse such opportunity would themselves incur the responsibility o!that abuse. And if it be granted that it is the will of Providence that His intelligent creatures should have the means byewhich to cultivate those wonderful wers with which aehas endowed them, it may, I thn, fairly be argued that to give them the leisure necessary for that purpose could not fail upon the whole to raise them in the scae of being. Supposing, however, for the sake of argument, that the present actual results were not satisfactory, I submit it foiows from the foregoing that the proper course even then would be, not to vithhold the leisure, but rather to direct attention either to the increasing of existing appliances or to the devicing some new scheme for its more profitable employment; aud it is possible tbat the utmost w hich may behas not yet beendone in this particular. At the same time, lookgi to positive facts, we possess abundant evidenceprinteg evidce-nwhich we shall be happytto supplytto any of your readers, showing that the expernence furnished up to this time is highly eacouraging. And if it is not entirely satisfactory, it only adds another to the many proofs that in the present imperfect state of being there is rarely any good without a measure of attnedant eviL Indeed, considering the truly debasing system from which young men have but just emerged, with its remaining demoralig influences, it would be little short of a miracle if they all, and ithat immediately, turned their newly gained iberty to a good account. To look for this would certainly be to expect to sow and reap in one and the same day. You have referred to an increase of late years of places of public resort of a questionable character, which I beg tosay no persons more deeply regret than do the committee at have the privilege to represent. At the same time they believe the most prominent of the places in questionthose modern hells, the casinos-are only reproductions in a new and possibly more fascinating form of old haunts of inlquity, such as the pot-house with its alluring " free and eanes,' and the low theatre with Its demoralizing saloons. It is happy circumstance, however (which unfortunately you omitted to recognize), that since early closing has come into operation there nave sprung out of this movementnumerous institutions of a moral and religious kind which are now flourishing in the metropolis and the other great cities of the em pire, and are exercising an influence for good which nas already powerfully told on the chcter and deportment of the younger portion of business men. In truth, so palpable is the im. provement which has of late years taken place in the moral ronduct of assistant tradesmen, viewed as a body, that it is all but universaly admitted by those who have the most ample opportunities of forming a right judgment in the matter. me moral advancement which has thus taken place among these classes may be seen in their more general attendance at divine worship, and it is stiklingly manifested in well-nigh all retail concerns where early hours of closing prevail in the superior bearing and inteligeno3 and more nonourable conduct of those who serve in these establishments, compared with what was observable in years gone by, when the practice of "white lying" and the worse forms of chieanery were notoriously the rule among them, and plain honest dealing the exception; and when, as a consequence, customers felt they need look about them pretty sharplyto aveid being "taken in." I doubt not the experience of most of your lady readers will bear me out in thislatter sttement. I scbamit, therefore, that these reaults afford a gratifyingprof that, while a number of badly disposed men may have abused the privilege in question (and what privilege or blessing is not abused ?),'yet that the general tendency of the early closingsystem isto elevate the character of those who are brought under its sway. I may also cite the testimony of even unwilling witnesses to the satisfactory working of the "Ten Houra' Bil4" of sz ich 2lc Times bhe ever been one of ihe warmeat and ablest advocates, as additional conclusive evidence that the 'eisure hitherto giveu to the people has in 'he main well as,:M0red the puroose for which it was conceded.
