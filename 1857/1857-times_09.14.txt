fOCZqBY-M4RBKT and CITYINYTELLIGRNOC. Saturday Evening. There have been scarcely any transactions in the funds to-day, and up to the official close they reanained without the slightest variation. Subse<qlently some operations took place at an improvesNent of an eighth. Consols were quoted at 90k to - for money, and 900 to J for the 14th of October. Alter regular hours the price for the account was <3();. India Stock left off at 210 to 213 ; India Bcnds, 23s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-biUs, 78. to 2g. discount. The transactions in foreign stocks bave been very limited, but the market has not shown any particular depression. Buenos Ayres were negotiated for the account at 85 ; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for tbe account, 79 and 79i-; Spanish Passive, bi and ; ; and Turkish Six per Cents., bor the account, 95 aud J. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were (-of. 7 Oc. for money, and 6lif. 8Oc. for the end of the month, showinig a dlecline of an eighth. The report to be submitted on Tuesday week to the meeting of Venezuela bondholders has been issued by the Committee. About nine months back the Government of Venezuela, after a long course of evasion and default, sent to England two commissioners, with full powers to conclude an arrangemenLt for the settlement of the debt. Terms were in consequence agreed to, and then the Government refused to acknowledge the acts of their own agents. Subsequently MIr. Mocatta, the agent of the bondholders at Caracas, endea-vouzed to bring the Fiuance Minister to some sense of shame, but without success. Meanwhile the Government published a decree, embodying the plan on which alone they would consent to pay anything, and -which had already beein unanimously rejected. 3Mr. Bingham, Her Mlajesty's representative at Caracas, had been instructed to use his good oflices; but these seem to have been lukewarm. }'or the present, therefore,the bondholders are without any prospect. The corruption and mendacity of the Government appear unexampled, even when looked upon according to the Spanish American standard, and such of the bondholders as may wade tbrough the long correspondence printed in the present report will see that their agent in endeavouring to negotiate with such people has had a task similar to that of any one in this country who might be employed to collect a debt of honour from the lowest blacklegs of the betting ring. The mnean insolence of the Finance 'Minister is practised wvith a zest which shows that even if it had made no difference to him or the country he would prefer not paying to paying, and that ultimatelv to cajole and deride those who may have claims upon the State constitutes the chief charm of his position. In the midst of such proceedings it is painful to notice that any part should be played by a British Minister. Doubtless the Venezuelan authorities derive increased amusement from the fact that concurrently with all the reclamations made upon them from month to month and year to year Her Majesty's Chargd d'Allaires " loses not a single opportunity of impressing on them the extreme urgency of the pending claim and the necessity for coming to some satisfactory understanding with respect to it." But there are certain conditions under which friendly remonstrances of this kind cannot be carried on without degradation. No ,one would think of volunteeriDg " good offices " between a gentleman and a pickpocket. The course would be either to advise the victim to put up with hisi loss, or else to holp him with the strong hand. If the British Goveriuneit do not intend to resort to acts as well as words in such cases the less they have to do with them the better. The folowing is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week :-At a meeting of the Lancaster and Carlisle the dividend declared was at the rate -of 8 per cent. per annum, leaving a balaDce of 1,3091. The amalgamation with the Kendal and 'Windermere has not been carried out, owing to a dispute as to the construction of the award of the arbitrator. Authority has been obtained to make a line from Lowgill toTebay. The surplus receiptsof the Colchester and Stour Valley have been appropriated in liquidation of their bond debt, which amoants now to 23,1501., and preference shares will be issued to pay ofl the remainder. The Banlf, Mlacdufl; and Turriff Railway, an offshoot of the Great 'ortli of Scotland, has been opened with the usual festivities. Active exertions are being made to reduce the working expenses of the Great Western. At a meeting 'f the Glasgow and South-Western the dividend declared wvas at the rate of 5 per cent. per annnmm. A satisfactory increase in the traffic has taken place. The working expenses are also larger, chiefly on account of the relaying of part of the line, and the repair, &c., of plant. The long pending question as to the amounIt of toll payable by the Troon Railway has been decided in their favouir, mnaking a difference to the company of from 5,0001. to G,0001. The works on the Castle Douglas and Dumfries line are proceeding with vigour, and there is every prospect of this being a valuable feeder to the southern end of the mndertaking. The report of the Furness Railway recommends a dividend at the rate of S per cent. per aimnum, and that a reserve fund be established to meet the heavy outlay in tho construction of a wall zt tiarrow Pier. It is intended to proceed with' the new line to Coniston immediately, with a view to having it opened for traffic in the course of next year. Steps are being taken to obtain an Act for a railway between Dewsbury, Ossett, and Wakefield. In the report of the Caledonian the directors propose to declare a dividend for the past half-year at the rate of 3A per cent. per annum, leaving a balance of 2,8011. In concert with the Edinburgh and Glasgow a traffic agreement has been conclnded w-ith the Scottish Central, on the principle of a joint revenue for the thrce comipanies. I'he (Granton Branch will be proceeded with, asid will afford an additional outlet for the minerals from the Lanarkshire district. A saving ii the workIng expenses of 51. Ss. 3d. per cent. is stated to arise from economy in the use of stores and the combined action of the staff. At a meeting of the Shropshire Union a dividend was declared at time rate of 21 per cent. per annum. The net earnings of the canal are stated to amoiint to 17,2411., and of the railway to 7,11t;1. The accouints of the Lancaster and Carlisle show a balaiceof 93,5781., which will admit of a distribution of 4 per cent. for the half-year, eqjuivalent to 8 pelr cent. per annum. The dividend of the Midland Great Western is proposed to be at the rate of 5 per cent. The followinig information respecting the mining btusiness of the week is condensed from the Mimning "A considerable amount of business has been transacted in mnes this -week, and the nmarket sbows an improved appearance. At South WVheal Frances meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of the mine of 3,3781., a dividend of 2,',761. (61. per share) was declared. At soscean Mine meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of adventurers of 2,35G1. a dividend of 7201. (31. per share, was declared, leaving 16361. in hand. At Drake Walls Mining Company meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of the adventurers of 1,4691.,; a dividend of 2s. per share was declared. At the vale of Towy meeting the accounts showad a balance in favour of the mine of 97GI.; the profits for the three months' workings amounted to 1321. At WVheal Russell meeting the accounts showed a halsnce against the nine of 491. * a call of 3s. per sbare was nade. At Devon Wheal Bailer meeting a statemuent of aeand liabilities showed a balance against adventurers of 051 . a call of 2s. Gd, pcer share was made." With regard to foreign mines it is stated "1 At a meeting of the Imperial Brazilian Mining Asso. iation directors and conimittee of shareholders it was resolved to recommend the shareholders toaccept an offer of 32,0001. for the purchase of the whole of tho companys property in the Bracils. Apparently the carrying out of the arrangement should insure to the shareholders a return of about 31. per share, for the total number of shares is 10,000, of w hich, we believe, OO have been forfeited. The Australian Mining Com,pany sold at Swansea, on the Sth Inst., a small parcel of copper ore, from their new property at Charlton at from 301. to :341. per ton. -Regarding the New Zealand goldfields the following extract of a letter from Wellington, dated 1st MIay, gives the latest particulars: "It was only last night I arrived fromn the Nelson dig.. n6-s (Massaore Bay), and brought with me a small parcel of gol I now send. A great gold district there is no doubt exists in the middle nland, but as the winter is now fast approaching the settlers are timid about leaving their comfortable homee to rough it in so cold a region as the range of mountains which run down the whole island where the auriferous deposits exist. As it is about 600 peoplenow occupy tbe ground, and wben spring comnmonces it is supposed mearly ;,000, or more, will he there. They are merely on the margin, it is supposed, of the gold region, as the land beyond bas never been traversed by the foot of tho white man, and the gulleys or valleys are mianv of them covered with bush. The chain of mountains called the Snowy ones, reported to be covered with that article, have been found to be all quartz, perfectly white." The annexed refers to a suggestion, made by a correspondent on Friday, regarding the dcgirak1eness of facilitating the substitution of checks for Bank- notes in certain mercantile paymenta '- Sir,-The inconvenience of whiah ' A Merohanmt complain in The Timas of Friday is easily remedied. " It is at present a custom for merchants and others res quiriDg to pay duties to ask their hanker for a draught on the Bank of England in cash instead of cash, in exchange for the check drawn for the required amount. " The same plan is applicable to moneys required to pay hills under discount. " Bankers would be willing to enter into this arrangement, as it would obviate the necesaity for their keeping so many notes in their tills, and so economize capitaL 'I am, Sir, yours obediently, _ " A BA&iER's CLZRK'"

BAILWAY INTELLI&EYCB. NORTH RRTTT9TT The report of the directors of this company states that the balance of revenue, after deduction of expenses, interest, and dividend on guaranteed capital, is 37,.911., out of which the directors recommend a dividend to be declared on the ordinary consolidated stock at the rate of 21 per cent. per annum, leaving a surplus of 2,9871. The sum paid for interest Is smaller than usual, partly in consequence of the first instalment of the 71. guaranteed shares enabling the directors to postpone the iseue of debentures, partly from the reduction of the average rate of interest at which loans have beeu renewed, and partly from tbe circumstance that a sum larger than neceesary was reserved for the payment of taxes in the previous year. The average rate of interest on debenture loans is now 41. 10s. 7d. per cent., as compared with 41. 12s. 7d. in the half-year ending July 31, 1856, and a saving at tho rate of 1,1141. per annum is thus effected. AU contracts for stores are now made for monthly settlement, vith a discount of 2. per cent. The balance-sheet shows a total expenditure ot. 4,473,8331., and a sum of 22,2551., at the credit of capital. The remaining obligations of the company consist of 41,0001., estimated as the comDany's share of the cost of the Edinburgh station ; 11,0001. land claims, 12,1351. turnpike road bonds and balances of unsettled accounts, and 4,0001. telegraph and other new works under contract-total, 68,1351. The assets consist of unissued 71. guaranteed 5 per cent. shares, 123,7881. ; debenture bonds, 53,44S1., surplus land, 12,5001. ; road bonds, 7,0001. ; halbeathkailway, 4,5001. and cash, 22,2561.- amounting together to 223,4931., leaving surplus of assets over obligations of 155,3M. The directors trust that at the end ox the year the whole of the above liabilities will be wiped off, and a clear available surplus capital of 1.50,0001. remain. In addition, a sum of 7,7981. has been placed in reserve, formed of over-paid calls, unclaimed deposits, and other sundries of simUar character, which do not belong to the revenue of any half-year, but in course of time practicaly lapse to the shareholders at large, as aU trace of the original owners is lost-the interest of this reserved fund belongs legitimately to revenue; but the principal ought only to be reloased upon a vote of the shareholders, and in such proportionate amounts as may preserve the curraut revenue from responsibility arising out of incidental claims made from time to time upon the fund. Such a fund is eminently useful to meet extraordinary outlay occasionally forced upon raUiway companies (either in defending or opposing measures promoted In Parliament by themselves or others), which, though not legally chargeable to capital, cannot be strictly said to belong to the half -yearly expenses, inasmuch as it is incurred in order to advance or protect the permanent interest of the company. Several shareholders having expressed 4 desire to pay up the second instalment of the 71. guaranteed shares, a resolutiton will be proposed to enable them to do so, and to receive 5 per cent. interest, corresponding with the dividend guaranteed to the paid uip shares, and also to convert these into consolidated stock. In order, however, that the present payment of the instalment should be optional, a distant date (July 31, 1858) has been named at which the call shall become due. It may be wel to mention here that beyond the deposit of 11. per share on the Hawick and Carlisle Junction capital, no call will be made for about 12 months fromitbis time till after the Act for the construction of that railway shall bave passed. The directors look upon the mode by which the extension of the North British system south of Eawick shall be accomplishe4 as deeply involving the future welfare of the compai They state that it is not too much to say that on the event depends not merely the continuance of the limited capacity for improvement existing at present, but the question whether this company is to establish its right to free access for its traffic to and over those great thoroughfares beyond it which communicate with the manufacturing districts in England, with the western counties of Scotland, and thence with Ireland, or to allow the last opportunity to escape whereby it can avoid being effectually shut up within its own threshold at Hawick, and open the way to Immediate and extensive development of Its internal resources. The directors confidently rely upon the support of the bhareholders in their determination not to yield to a mere sDirit of aggression or obstruction the right of access to Carlisle and to Gretna. They have already contracted alliances with other companies and landed proprietors, whose co-operation Is necessary for the profitable development of resources opened out by the new route, and they have reason to believe that the interchange of traffic will be cordially reciprocated by those railway companies which are established in the possession of the district west of Gretna and south of Carlisle. MID-SSUSSEX. The first half-yearly meeting of this company was hold at IHorsham oln Saturday, Mi. W. P. litf ord in 'he chair. Mr. CArNSSAO-, solicitor to the company, read the report, which, after congratulating the shareholders upon the presernt position of the undertaking, stated that the directors had pleasure in an,nouncing that an agreement between them azid the London ands Bsighton Company, Eecuring a return of 4 per cent. per annum upon the capital to be exI pended in the construction of tbo railway, had been sealed. With the view of completing the line at the earliest possible mowent, the directors had decided upon making a call of 21per share, payable on the 20th of Ociober next, and the pre. iminary arrangements eoncluded with an eminent oontractor justified them in anticipating the early completion of the line. The number of shares already subscribed for represented a capital of 119,0001. The London and Brighton Company had intimated their wish to see the present line extended tu alidburst, and the directors, ilfluenced by a desire of affording railvay accommodation to the extensive district of Slid-Sussex, were prepared to entertain this or any other similar prqopsal. The C5IAlMAN,Df, in nmoving the adoption of the report, said, he had no doubt the undertaking would sbortly be brought to a successful termination. They had already received 1349201., which had been paid as a deposit; 11,4501. of thls sum was lodged in the Court of Chancery, according to the requiremwents of the Act of Parliament. iMr. CARY seconded the motion, which was adopted unanimnously. The Ron. R. CURZON proposed the followine gentlemen as directors: -Messrs. J. Garrard, J. Cary, W.B. Bartellot, W. 1'. Mitford, and A. J. W. Biddulph. The salary of the secretary wvas fixed at 2001. per aunum, and Mir. George was elected auditor. The proceedings were terminated by a vote of thanks to the chairman. TRAFFIC RETUIRN'S. Miles Pas- Ier.

CAmT FROM THEi NORTH OF EtROPE.-The gross ! imports of cattle into Lowestoft-harboar last week from Busum, Frederickstadt, and Tonning (Duchy of Sohles. wig) amounted to 1,024 beasts and 1,298 oxen. The iNorth of Europe Steam Navigation Company's steamers the City of Norwich, Captain Oliver, and the Tonning, Captain Russell, arrived on Friday; and the Cumberland, Captain Rivers, followed on Saturday. The Cumberland brought 221 beasts and 220 sheep, and the other vessels having equally large cargoes, the stook were despatched to town in tive special trains, as they bad been consigned as usual to metropolitan firms. A telegraphic message received on Saturday froni Lowestoft states that a fourth steamer, the I Royal Victoria, Captain Rose, was also expected to arrive in time to enable ber cargo to he despatched to the metro. poitan market. It iz probable, therefore, that the total arrivals will be as heavy as last week. The importations vill continue for about six weeks longer, but they will be suspended during- the winier mocnths,
RAILWAY AND MINING SHARES. Saturcly Evening. The railway-market has been steady, and in some cases an advance has taken place. Great Western, Caledonian, and Sheffield show a recovery from the late decline. After official hours Laneashire and Yorkshire, North-Eastern, York, and Eastern Counties were rather weaker. Grand Trunk of Canada improved, and Buffalo and Lake Huron receded. In foreign shares, Dutch Rhenish were a shade higher, and a reduction occurred in Paris and Lyons. The transactions in mines have been unimportant; South Wheal Frances and Wheal Edward closed at an advance. In joint-stook banks and miscellaneous securities the only alteration was in Electric Telegraph, which were quoted at 104 to 106, the last plice being 104 to 108.

Turnips end other root crope as well as grass land. have received much beniefit from the rain, end for ploughing the lend will now be found to be in capital condition. The atnual meetings of agricultural asmociations ar-e approaching, at which we may expect to hear gratifying accounts as to the harvest Just now cleoed, and also much valuable Information as to the Improved tillsge adop)ted in west districts. For the easke of the poorer classe It Is lamentable to hear further reports of the Partial los of the potato crop. At market to-day a faLrmer, having a considerable beeadth of Lend planted wIth Potatoes, stated that,as far as the Process of digging up bad gone at presnt, fully tine-half had poroed utterly worthiess. hlifs being the case, we miust expect the corn tradieto assume a muchi firmer saeet than the reports of an abundant yIed at one time lal people to anticipate. in the Oorn Exchange to-day the stands were extensively occupiedl with samples of wheat, represeting an unusually large quantity. The wet weather has been very unfavourable for it. aud it does not come to handso bright and dry ag wished, TIe bulk of the supply may be said to have been of an indifferent quality. Since our lass report the London, Liverpool, ancl Bristol mnarketsi have shown a gret Improve. ment, and thus It was that our factors began by nseking to ettablish a higher range ofpricesthaan previously existed. Despite theextremely lihera supply holders demanded, an increase of as much as 2.. to 3e. per quarter. Jest prior to the last rise in the price of corn the flour trade declined Is, per nck, so that at the current pricee for thie article it was Impoalsble that mealmnen could give the increase asked for wheat. Trade upon this became languid, and though a few in - Mitnces might be mnindi which really choice samples realired ani additional Is., the mareket taken as a whole. was not deare than last week, The prioes were reported as fallow : Old white wheat, beet qualities, fits. to file-: cecondary, 5ie. to 6is. ; and inferior, 5Os, to 5is. ; new white wheat, fl0e, to 64e.;, secondary, lBs. to file.: aed Inferior, l0s. to 5ie. ; beat red wheat, old. 58s. to 62le: secnary, h4a. to l3s.; inerior, dOs. to ts,; new red wheat, beet1tlat,54s,to ls. ; seonadary, 50s. to Us e,; enidinferior, 4-s, to ls. There was afair show ofbarley,, themalting descriptions of which were taken ofr clowly at late curencies. Soein v., et country dealers, anxious so obtain the distilling qualities gave an impetus to this, part of trade, and a, little more money was realized. but the grindine samples were less eagerly sought after. Malting barley sold at 44s. to 47. ; diattlUng at 40Oeto 4ja. ;and grinding at Ss.to 0sO. Allold oleamet withan activeinquiry,sandthere was anupward, tendency in price.

At Abingdon, on Monday, there was a large quanttity of wheat on offer ; the high prices asked ceceked trade, but what few Weaz were effected were at an ad. vanes on the previous quotaitions. On Tneaday, at Alton, there was raich animation in the trade, and sellers readily realized an increase of Is .

There was a degree of languor In the trade, and a decline of Is. took place, Oais and bseane were is. dearer, and tar-es a4vanced fully 25. At Henley-on-Thames on the smme day, the market was quiet, and prices did not undergo any alt-eration, On Friday, at Wallingford, there was a faullsupply of corn. Farly in the day p1n advance of Is. was made, but beore business closed prices receded to thezetandard of the prevriousvweek. Barley for malting wasisaactive cequect, and vwas quoted Ia. dearer.

The potato dsteaso is committing its ravages very extensively, and in many eases t'oe blight is very zredone; there appears to be littie doubt, however, that the crop wi!I be a very lerge one notwithstanding this; drawback., The recent heavy rains hare bad a masked effect on the turnips. wvhich are nowv looking well, with the exception of those early sown. Hiop-picking, which is cow being actively carried on. has been conisiderably retarded by the rains. which have fallen almost daily for nearly a fortnight. The hop3 come down in comsparatively goAd condition, the quainty and colour generally being very fine. In some gardens, where the plant h3asbeen t-z, highly manuxred, the hops continue in a green state, whicha maktes them weich light, but in others the condition, weight, and ejloar are statedI to have ncr r been excelled.

LtUiNDON, MONDAY, SBPTEDIBBB 14, 1857. 'ITh.. intelligence from India, so anxiously ex(C 1, is on the whole quite as favourable as roasonably have been anticipated. We ;,ai.,t, indeed, announce either that Delhi has 1.'iui captured, that execution has been done upon li imlnster NTNA SAIiB, nor that the Mutiny is st,l nlifined to the Bengal Army, for one regiment of l:ombay troops has caught the infection, and M ah)nedani intrigues have excited alarm on more than one point of the Bombay Presidency. But time had begtun to tell for us. The insurrection had long pas.i d its most formidable phase,-that of a sur paii. v we have never lost our hold on the country, although taken at every disadvantage; and now rei frorcements are beginning to arrive, which will * n:.ble the army, which, weak as it was, had everywhere held its own against the Insurrection, to bake thle field in force. (General ThvmLocn appears to have attacked IN i. SHIm in his stronghold of Bithoor with cenoplete success. His object was not only t) punish the monster for his unexampled perfidy aind cruelty, but to secure his flank while uoving to the relief of Lucknow, and this result sce(ins to have been sufficiently obtained by the two defeats he is Baid to have inflicted on the relbels and the capture of their artillery. With his hainds thus set free he would be able to cross the river in security, and relieve the heroic garrison, which, even after the loss of its gallant leader, Sqr 11ErNRY IAwRm-cr, appears to have successfully made head against its swarm of enemies. Tlke Mutiny at Dinapore, which had been described as imminent at the date of the last mail, is but another incident in the universal treachery. IHappily, it seems to have brought immediate retribution upon the mutineers, another body of vvheua o their maroh from Sealkote towards Delhi are described as having been "totally destroyed" by Brigadier NIcHOLSON. These terrible examples come too late, indeed, for the Bengal Army, which as a military body has ceased to exist; but they must have an immense effect upon the wavering among the native chiefs, as proving that ours, after all, is the stronger side. At Delhi we have another proof of how heavy is the awful responsibility of command. Since the 1 0th of May, the date of the outbreak at Meerut, two Generals, ANsON and BARNARD, have perished from disease, the consequence of exertions in the field; and now General REID is obliged to surrender his command after a yet shorter tenure. Sir CoLIN CAM¢BEI, has, however, arrived at Calcutta, and we shall probably hear by the next mail that he has set out to assume the direction of the siege at the head of the reinforcements which will before then have arrived. As we have already said, we do not consider the delay in the capture of Delhi a subject for regret. So long as it serves as a rallying-point for the mutineers we can well afford to leave it in their hands until such a force can be collected as may render not only the capture of the city certain, but may prevent the escape and dispersal of the horde of ruffians by whom so many horrors have been perpetrated. The one unfavourable point in the news is the disaffection of a single Bombay regiment. We trust this will continue an exceptional case, to be accounted for by exceptional causes. This Mutiny is said to have been suppressed; but if it were shared by any large portion of the Bombay Army it would be an important aggravation of our difficulties. Three months since, indeed, such *a movement mnight h-vo proauooa ix mloul- lo fniuchief. Now, happily, the troops diverted from the China Expedition have begun to arrive at Bombay, to supply the place of those which have done such good service in Bengal, and every additional English soldier in India is a security not only that a mutiny will fail, but that no mutiny will be attempted. If, on the general grounds which we have stated, the news may be considered favourable, so, for the sake of the many thousands who have looked forward to this mail with sickening anxiety, do we rejoice that we have now to recount none of those appalling massacres which have carried misery to so many English homes. We believe, indeed, that fierce and threatening as it has becn, we have seen the worst of the storm. -
The characteristic of making very narrow remarks is one which belongs in common to educated and uneducated people. The remarks which children and savages make upon great spectacles and grand works of art are very disappointing; they are sure to single out some trifling circumstance to e.xpend their admiration upon, simply because they do not know the most simple thing they see from the most wonderful. But educated persons show ofteh the same littleness in their observations upon men and things, particularly if they are persons who have especially devoted themselves to some one pursuit. A military man looks at a country simply with reference to fortification, an agriculturist simply with reference to crops, a geologist simply with reference to strata. The father of FREDERICE the GREAT looked at thewholemale population of his kingdom in one single point of view_ their being or not being six feet high-a fact which decided their admissibility into his regiment of Grenadiers. The aspects in which any one thing may be viewed are innumerable, and men show their ingenuity in selecting the particular one which favours their own side of the question. Theorists and partisans are in this way the narrowest of commentators. A Calvinist sees his own doctrine, and nothing else, in the whole of the Bible. Heads of political factions, of religious factions, intellectual gladiators of all kinds, seize hold of every new event as it occurs, and fix their aspect upon it. It may be a point of view the furthest possible from natural, no ordinary person would ever have dreamt of it, but it suits the gladiator's purpose. Cardinal WissnAsN's discourse at Salford, of which we published a report on Saturday, is rather an extreme specimen of this kind of ingenuity. If there ever was an event which had its own straightforward natural aspect, it is this Indian Miutiny. It suggests its own comment. The facts are plain, that it is an atrocious, sanguinary conspiracy, that its leaders are monsters, and that for the sake of India and humanity it must be immediately put down. But, vhile the public is breathless with horror and indignation, asking every moment impatiently, "When will this be over? How long wiU "this dreadful scene last '"-while we are aU of us absorbed in the one thought of suppressing this monstrous and infernal outbreak of human passion and crime, and while we are waiting with painful eagerness for the slightest news about it, Cardinal WLSEyAx coolly mounts the pulpit at Salford to draw from the Indian Mutiny-what argument should you think ?-an argument on the side of the Papal States and Naples versus Piedmont; and we suppose versus England too I What should we say, is the Cardinal's ingenious comment, if the leaders of this Mutiny escaped to an independent State in India, the Sovereign of which refused to give them up, on the ground that they were political refugees, who had only fought for a change of Governmrent in Hindostan ?-the retort, of course, being that European countries ought on the same rule to give up the Ioman and Neapolitan refugees. Noow, it would be perfectly easy to reply here, first, that these Indian mutineers are not only rebels but atrocious criminals as well. That one fact immediately of itself sweeps away the Cardinal's analogy. And in the next place we might say-and we defy contradiction-that we have fulfilled our engagements to our Indian soldiers, while those European States have notoriously broken theirs to their subjects; and therefore that the Indian mutineer, were he a political criminal only, would stand on very different ground from a disaffected Neapolitan. Can the Cardinal deny the fact that the Neapolitan Government has broken express engagements made to its people? He knows he cannot. He knows that the Neapolitan Government has published a formal defence of the admitted violation of those engagementx, founded upon a particular casuistical theory. All this is simple fact,-it is in black and white, and we have the printed documents, whieh Mvfr. GLADSTONE published. But we want only .to draw attention to the eircumstance that the Cardinal can at such a time as the present coolly institute a comparison between an Indian mutineer and a disaffected Neapolitan ! How truly sympathetic, just at this moment, to tell us that the Indian mutineer is, according to our own standard, a very respectable sort of person, that he is only a political crimiual, that we ought not to feel so very angry I with him, and that we welcome with hospitalty to our own shores men of exactly the same type in Europe! WVhat English sensibilities are here, what tenderness to the honour and the griefs of Englishmen and Englishwomen I Very sharp of the Cardinal, very clever, no doubt !-an adroit use of a capital opportunity, when the English lion is supposed to be rather prostrate, and therefore to invite the same treatment which a dying predeceacsc did from a generous friend I But not so sharp either. There is such a thing as catching at a petty advantage before the eye, at the cost of something substantial in the background. It is understood to be tho ambition of this foreign ecclesiastic to be considered an Englishman, or at least to stand well with English society. Everybody that can be laid hold of is pressed into the soirees at Golden-square. But if there ever was a spech which had the foreign stamp upon it, it is this speech at Salford. For the outrages, the horrors, the insults, the atrocities of the EIndian Mutinies the Cardinal does not care one straw-he is only intent on finding something in the event, or its possible concomitants, incidents, consequences, which may favour the King of NArLES. Is that like an Englishman ? Would a man with a single particle of the Englishman about him have passed over the whole of this horrible so ae itself, and simply said to himself-" What if, when "the Mutiny is suppressed, the leaders escape, and "what if they should take refuge in an in"dependent State, and the English should "demand them, and the State refuse to give "them up, and the English then punish that State?" The tortuous and small ingenuity which, overlool;ing the whole natural view of the event, should have twisted it into this remote angularity, and by screwing the eye up to a needle's point, and darting glances round half a dozen corners, should at last have obtained the triumphant result of a spurious argumnentm ,ad lwminem against England-this feat of argumentative squinting is not after all a very politic one, even for the Cardinal's own purposes. We see in him at once the foreigner, not the Englishman; the man whose sympathies are all with European despotisms, and not with the Constitution, the power, the honour, or the influence of England.
The Credit Mobilier is subsiding into an ordinary Commercial Company. The «hares, although still bearing a premium, have fallen fifty per cent. in the market. It is not impossible that the capital originally subscribed may still be forthcoming, but the confidence which enabled the Association to realize enormous profits is irretrievably gone. A trading firm without a definite sphere of operations can only prosper by the reputation of prosperity. There is little cause for regret in the probable failure of a project which ostentatiously violated all the rules of economical prudence. The exceptional gains of the Cr6dit Mobilier for a time appeared to sanction the extravagant pretensions of its founders; but all commercialdoctrines would have been confused if a Bank had permanently thriven which was precluded by its constitution from engaging in the legitimate business of Banking. The auspices under which the speculation was commenced furnished additional ground for suspicion. The conception of the scheme was due to the St. Simonians of five and twenty years ago, and the official favour which facilitated its introduction might arise from considerations altogether irrespective of the interests of the shareholders. The Socialist admirers of the enterprise hoped that it would ultimately defeat the competition of individual capitalists; nor was it a secret that in the event of complete success the new Company was destined to become an important department of the State. Englishmen have little right to triumph over the collapse of foreign bubbles, but in this country speculations are only attractive when they profess to be exclusively commercial. Philanthropic or political promises would be fatal to projectors. French writers on political economy have never succeeded in impressing their doctrines on the popular mind. The clearness and controversial vigour by which some of them are eminently characterized may, perhaps, in some degree be attributed to their position as the representatives of a protesting minority. The different Socialist sects are unanimously hostile to a science which is founded on axioms contradictory of their own; and the influence of Socialism extends far beyonad therange of its nominal adherents. No delusion has been more widely epread in France than a belief that some mysterious attributes belong to the notion of credit. Louis BiAsc relied on this resource when he preached the regeneration of labour at the Luxembourg, soon after the Provisional Government had with admirable consistency abolished the Professorship of Political Econdmy. In commercial parlance, credit is no more than the transferable value of some material possession. In this sense the landowner knows that he can raise money on his titledeeds, and the mechanic that his watch will be represented by a pawnbroker's duplicate. The transcendant credit of the new school of antieconomists is exempt from any servile dependence on actual property. Almost all the speculative projects which inaugurated the Imperial era originated in a belief that phrases might be substituted for money. A beneficial result was produced when private hoards were tempted to enter into profitable circulation, but nearly every application of the principle of credit had long since been brought into use by the necessities of trade. The founders of the Credit Mobilier announced as their peculiar function the purpose of supplying speculative enterprises with the same banking facilities which were already provided for ordinary commerce. The statutes of the institution confine its operations to joint-stock companies or to public funds. Its investments have been made in docks, in railways, and in similar works, and at least in one remarkable instance the Association has come to the assistance of the Government. The capital and reputation of the Cr6dit Mobilier have not restricted their beneficial influence to France; Austria and Spain have received their share of the fertilizing stream. The effect on enterprise and on the prosperity of the proprietors themselves has been precisely analogous to those of the similar operations which were practised during the supremacy of the Railway King in England. New undertakings have been stimulated, large dividends have been declared, and by degrees it has transpired that a community is not enriched when money is transferred from one pocket to another. The Credit Mobilier is, in truth, neither more nor less than a stockjobbing company or associated " stag." Its profits consist in selling at a premium what has been first bought at par, and then increased in value by the notoriety of the original purchase. Dupes have been readily found to believe that an enterprise was sound because it was patronized by the Mobilier, and the Directors of the great Company have boasted that they created wealth when they suCceeded in rigging the market. It would have been inconsistent with the original purpose of the institution to make a permanent investment in any undertaking, however beneficial. It is, in fact, the proper business of bankers to deal exclusively in money; and the Credit Mobilier is a Bank, engaged, however, in discounting expectations, instead of existing values. All genuine commercial paper represents in the first or second degree so3ne actual amount of goods; bills of exchange correspond to dock warrants or bills of lading, which again are the title-deeds of cargoes and consignments. Through the medium of documents of this kind credit discharges many useful functions, and professes to perform no unintelligible miracles. The Or6dit Mobilier as long as it holds its investments enjoys the security of possible future profits, but ita tangible gains are derived from the credulity of speculative purchasers. It will probably be found that a business so preeminently hazardous requires individual superintendence and the stimulus of personal interest. When the loan for the Russian War was negotiated the Association took a considerable share in the contract; and the Directors in a subsequent report actually claimed the approbation of their shareholders on the ground that they had offered the Government terms which involved a patriotic sacrifice. It is unnecessary to inquire whether the purchase of official favour is a beneficial investment, but it would seem that in ordinary cases a losing transaction was scarcely a cubject for self-congratulation. The Board was well aware it had been expected that its operations would be far more successful and universal, extending to an absorption of all the joint-stock capital of France. The convenience which the State might have derived from the control of so powerful an engine is sufficiently obvious. Only a small portion of the original scheme has been carried into effect, and it is not likely that the great financial experiment will be tried on a larger scale. The projectors intended to issue debentures to the amount of 60,000,0001., though t is difficult to understand the basis on which so enormous a circulation was to rest. If they had held shares of the same nominal value they would bave incurred a fixed liability in reliance on a fluctuating profit. Investments in the debentures of minor joint-stock companies would have left no margin of gain except in the improbable contingency of a confidence placed in the superstructure which was denied to the foundation. The Credit Mobilier could never have enjoyed a higher degree of credit than that which belonged to the nature of the property which it held. Fortunately, the monetary crisis and the excesses of stock-jobbing speculators have induced the Government to withhold from the institution the more extravagant powers which it desired. Commerce, and especially the money trade, has been too earnestly pursued and studied to leave much room for startling discoveries. In pecuniary transactions what is true is seldom newr, and what is new is probably not true. The great semiSocialist speculation of the present day has developed itself in the form of stockjobbing. It wil be well if the shareholders are satisfied with the experience they have gained, and if the Fhrench Government learns that no artificial stimulus to enterprise is any longer required. The untoward incidents in the career of some of the Directors may suggest the further consideration that the managers of a stockjobbing company are not uflikely to speculate for themselves.
A famous historical proposition was once enounced under the title of " Kiling no Murder." In pretty t imilar terms might we describe a paradox which l as been allowed in some way or other to affect opinion in recent times. Murder is thought not to be exactly murder when its features are considerably more shocking than those of the average crime. Killing by inches is not killing. When death arrives as a consummation not of a few strokes or a brief grapple, but of barbarous and protractecl torture, it is doubted whether it falls under the category in question. One of Mr. LaGREz's friends observed that if he could catch a certain iunaway he would "take him a long way round," implying, in the language of the South, that he would conduct the captive through a good many stages of suffering before he allowed him to expire. Suchtreatment might be defended on the principle we refer to as not clearly amounting to murder, and the assassin might possibly be mitigating his own punishment by the very proceedings which enhanced his gratification. It is but a few months since we bespoke the attention of the public to the execrable cruelties practised on board merchant ships, and to the difficulties which from one cause or other were experienced in bringing the offenders to justice. Even in cases where agony was actuaUy terminated by death, and the murder, to all common observers, seemed as clear and as flagrant as such a crime could be, some looDhole was found for escape. Nowhere were such barbarities committed as in this service, and yet nowhere was impunity so common. This morning, however, we have to record an instance of condign and salutary punishment, which may exert, we trnst, a powerful influence in checking such atrocities for the future. A captain of a merchant vessel, convicted of the murder of one of his own crew on board the ship under his command, has forfeited his life on a public scaffold, and his accomplices, the first and second mates, have only escaped this last penalty of the law after a terrible suspense, on the condition that the remainder of their days shall be dragged out in the miseries of penal servitude. It is not easy to conceive what motives can be at work to produce such crimes as those of which we read, and to convert men who cannot originally, or as a body, be more inhuman than others, into tyrants of such hardened and inhuman character. The chief causes must probably be sought ia the effect of almost absolute power over minds unqualified for its exercise, and to a still greater extent perhaps in the absence of all that control which society, observation, and opinion supply in ordinary life. When a vessel goes to sea she constitutes a little world of her own, and is isolated from all influences beyond the smaU circuit of her decks. Within this sphere the captain is an autocrat, and, like all autocrats, is pretty certain to find abettors in any policy he may adopt. We rarely hear of any case of tyranny in which the brutalities of the master are not backed by the emulous barbarity of a mate. The crew, perhaps, comprises a bad bargain or two-some sickly, shallow-headed " shirks," who are hardly worth their victuals, who soon get bad names, and presently stiUl worse treatment. From this point things go on till cruelty stimulates cruelty, and atrocities are committed over which when they are abruptly brought to light nature positively shudders. Such we take to be the course of these iniquities. Generally, perhaps, the victim gives some offence, or occasions some disgust, though his delinquency seems usually to partake rather of misfortune than fault ; the rough usages of the sea and the traditions of the service begin the mischief; the uncontrolled power of the authorities aggravates the evil, and the gradual growth of crime does the rest. We were taken to task, we remember, upon our last notice of this subject, for ascribing in general anything like such practices as these to the merchant service of England, but we can only qualify our observations by admitting the exceptions which are demanded. Nobody, of course, conceives that such barbarities could go on in the fleets of our great commercial companies or shipowners-nobody attributes such proceedinga to the commanders of our clippers or our Indiamen, or, in short, to any of the higher branches of the service. Even in the more modest departments there are, doubtless, hundreds of well-conducted vessels and of humane and honourable captains, but no arguments or protests can prevail against the evidence incessantly afforded in our courts of law. If the bad treatment of seamen by their masters were not common we could not possibly see so many cases brought to light. We can only trust that the success of justice in this instance may carry with it a wholesome terror, and that, in addition to such other correctives as vigilance may supply, a warning may be given to all such authorities in the fate of Captain HEzNY 3oG1Ros. It is not a little remarkable, after the disclosures which have been made, that among our seafaring population there should be found occasionally a kind of aversion to the Royal Navy and a preference for the merchant service, grounded on the severity of the discipline thought to prevail in the former. We were assured, however, at periods when measures for manning our fleet wer; under consideration, that sailbrs did sometimes shrink from a man-of-war, for fear of the treatment they might experience, and took service in vessels where they were exposed to such liabilities as those here put on record. How such an error could ever have obtained currency among men whose very experience should have taught them better it is scarcely possible to imagine. The credulity of the Sepoy himself is hardly more astonishing. On board a man-of-war tyranny would be scarcely practicable, even if we could conceive an officer desirous of indulging in it. The service is so regulated as to extirpate the elements of temper or passion in proceedings affecting discipline or punishment, and to substitute the operation of law as completely as is done on shore. The two cases, in fact, resemble those of civilized and despotic Governments. Under the former, offences as well as penalties are defined beforehand, and the result is determined by impartial law. Under the latter, though there may be more occasional license, there is no permanent security. Custom, and perhaps necessity, lodge in the hands of a merchant captain a greater amount of arbitrary power than pertains to the commander of a man-of-war. He has to meet aU exigencies from his own resources, and has to control by his own authority what may be, perhaps, an irregular, an insufficient, or turbulent crew. It was, probably, in part out of these considerations that excesses committed in the merchant service came to be regarded with more leniency than they deserved, but nothing can be plainer than that no such conditions of government can justify barbarity. Cruelty can never prevent a mutiny, though it might possibly cause one. No captain can ever become more respected, or even more powerful, from descending to the brutalities of a tyrant. Such atrocities arise from the wickedness of nature when left uncontrolled,-not from the necessities of any special service,-and we trust we shal hear less of them now that it has been shown how dreadful a penalty they may entail.

The F.ench Government has received a telegraphic despatch from Jassy announcing that the Moldavian elections, which had commenced on the 10th inst., had, as far as concerns the first operations, been in favour of the Unionists. Of 32 votes 27 wvere in favour of the union of the provinces. The clergy voted on the 10th. The great proprietors voted yesterday, together with the peasants in the com-, munes. To-day is the turni of the small proprietors in the cbi'f towns of the arrondissenment3. The elections of the same class in the chief towmns of districts are fixed for to-morrow. The peasants I in the chief towins of the arrondissements are to vote on the same day. The peasants in the chief towYns 8 of districts will vote on the 16th, and the elections in the -reat tovins will follow on the 17th. M. Vogorides, the Kainiakan, had proposed to adjourn the elections, but the Porte had, of its own: accord, refused, by a telegraphic despatch, to admit any fvrs her delay. M. Ihouvenel, who has received leave of absence, will return to France after the elections ln Moldavia. The French Government has likewise received despatches from Admiiral Parseval Deschenes, dated, Tunis, l0th ist., announcing that the Bey had made the following important concessions. The establishment of criminal tribunals and of comunercial tribunals; complete liberty of commerce; iberty of industry; right to possess property; respect of persons and property; equality in presence of the law ; equality of taxation; a limnited period of service and liberty of religious worship.

Every one at all famluliar with the weak and vacillating mind of the Sultan was not a little astonishcdl at the dcdcsion displayed by His Majesty during the late political crisis. Not all the threats, nor aggressive acts of the confederate diplomatists, could make him yield; but, the rstruggle over aud the battle won, his energy has failed. Instead of foDLowing up his triumph, and shaking off aU foreign influence, he has in one moment surrendered all the advantage gained,and by lending himself to a shame. ful intrigue jproved once more to the world that he k-nows not how to be independent. He has conr sented to remove cdoshid Pasha from office. No one could bla'ne the Sultan for this measure, did it appear that Redschid had in any way forfeite his master's. confidence and goodwill. But the Sultan himcelf has taken care to let us know that such is not the case, by assuring Redschid, since his removal, that his confidence is still boundless, and bis desire to avail himself of his services as great as ever, lutt that circumstances prevent him doing so for awvhile. What thlese c;rcumstances are is soon told. Redschid has nmusy enemies. During the late conflict, uinindful of their country's honour, they were leagned vwith the stranger. This policy failed, but Redschid ceased to be Grand Vizier, and some of * heir nurnber cr-pt into the Ministry. Still Redschid beld an inmportant office; his influencewasgreat, and it beemed likely that he would be soon again at the bead of aflairs. But it was represented to the Sultan that it would be very agreeable to the French Ambassador and to the Emperor if the Muister who had so ruceessfully resisted their demands were altogether set aside. As diplomaatic relations were resumed and 4. Thouvenel would shortly have an official audienco, such a measure would efface any remnant of bitterniess lurklig in the bo om of that diplomatist, and be very grateful to the feelings of the Emperor. And so the only man who has shown any governing talent has ceased to belong to the Ministry. Ile h:.s been replaced by Puad Pasha, who, it wvill be renembered, when last Pr office, made such a mess of the Bolgrad question that its Eolution seemed quite hopeless. A further change will probably sooni take place. PMrehemet 33eprisli will become Grand Vizier, and then the party in power will have raUlicd all the talent it can com'and ard try to hold its groond as long as it can. And this is how the game of Ministers is played here. Now one influence, now another, disposes of the Dlaces ; as for the interests of the counte; or the opinions of the public, they are coutated as nothing. But the day is not far off when, even in I Turkey, the public voice will speak so loudly that it will force a hearing. Since the war the miiddle and even the lower classes of Turks have singularly opened their eyes. They are beginning to see and feel that they are forgotten in the race of a few greedy Pa-has after the public moneys. They will' not long conseut to see the wealth and resources of their country squandered by improvident and incapable Mlinisters. The extravagant expenditure of tse Sultan and his women, the endless palaces he is every day building, are becoming common themes of discussion in all the cafenehs. Only two days ago, in the sacred suburb of Eyoub, the City of the Tombr,, the abode of the most fanatic Mursulmaans, the last place in Stamboul where one would expect to hear seditious language, a white-turbanned Turk, in the midd3e of a large group, ask-ed me whether it was true that the Kings of England had not builh themselves a new palace for upwards of 200 years. " WVhy," ho says, " our Padishahs build themselves one every year. How cani a country be rich when its wealth is so heedlessly squandered. Y'ou are wis -, and do not let your Kings do as they hke." W'ith all the religious presfige wbich surroinds the Imperial person, such opinions must not gain much ground among the people to become serious. Hitherto, all attempts at reform in Turkey have been frustrated by the corruption of the upper classes. These constitute an army of placemen, dependent on the State for their support. Accus. tomed to indulge themselves in eveiy luxury, they are obliged to invent perquisites, that they may afford them selves an expeediture far above their salaries. Nothing is to be expected from a class thus situated. Though they may possess talents, and acqluire klowledge, they cannot acquire bonesty; their talents and knowledge they must apply to dishoniest purposes. Unfortunately, this ciass is every day increaaing; beys, from the provinces, servants and slaves of high functionaries ere every day receiving civil rank, and increasing the number of useless pensioners of the Government; several thousand persons have been addld to the list in less thani a year. If there is any hope for Tnrkey it mnust rest on the middle and leawer classes; here alone is still found the antique and proverbial honesty of the Turk. They are gradually developing themselves, ltarning the history of the world, and every day becoming nmore and more initiated into the real Conidition of their country. They will rouse themselves to energy at no very rewote period, and then woe to those who now so superblylord it over them. AUSTRIA. (FRsO OUR ONVN CORRESPONDENT.) VIENNA, SErT. 11. The correctness of my so often repeated asser. tion, that no greater political privileges would be granited to the Hungarians than to the inhabitants of the other provinces of the empire, has freouently been caUed in questioin by other writers for the press, but the subjoinecl official document proves that you have not been misinformed:- "1 Dear Cousin Archduke Albrecht,*-During my recent tWur through the greator part of my kingdom of Hungary I everywhero met with the most lively expression of attach. ment on the part of all the different races, and innumerable striking, and on all occasions well-meant, proofs of loyat ho-raue rnd Eirctre devotior.

"Laxenburg, Sept. 9, 1857." The foregoing Imperial rescript will not fail t, produce an extremely unfavourable impression on the Rungarian nobles, who have always flattered themselves that they should be able to obtaiu im. portant concessions from the Crown;; but it is perhaps well for all parties that such plain and unmistakable language has been employed. As has already been said, the news that the Emperors Napoleon and Alexander were to have an interview in CG'ermany produced an extremely unpleasant impression on this Government; but a few days sinceBaronBonrqueney gaveexplanationswhich either satisfied or appeared to satisfy the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Vienna papers are inclined to attach conaiderable importauce to the fact that an Austrian Field-Marshal-iAeutenant has been sent to Warsaw to pay his respects to the Emperor Alexander, but you may be assured that if there were any improvement in the relations between Austria and Russia one of the members of the Imperial family would have gone to the capital of Russian Poland. About a week ago Baron Bud. berg, the Ruesian Minister at this Court, was sum- *The Archduke Albrechtls Governor-General of Htuwg . moned to Warsaw, but his stay there must have been very short, as he is already on his way back to this city. The King of Wuttemberg, who left Paris at 7 o'clock in the morning of the 6th, reached Stuttgard at 11 o'clock in the evening of the same day. His Majesty travelled by the usual "express' to Bruchsal, but at that place a special train was in waiting to take him to his capital. The following information may be of interest to such of your readers as are fond of statistics. Although Vienna is seldom free from typhus it lies high (some 600 feet above the level of the sea) and is extremely windy. According to observations made during the last 75 years, the mean temperature of the Austrian capital is rather more than 50.00 Fahr. The highest is 93, and the lowest 2.75. Dariug the 75 years there were on an average 127 fine days, 75 days with fog, 111 with rain, 33 with snow, and 19 with thunderstorms. The most prevalent wind is that from the north-west; the most rare that from the east. The city, with its suburbs, contains 8,793 houses, with 36,000 sets of apartments on the ground floor, 28,890 on the first, 14,741 on the second, 6,231 on the third, and 1,792 on the founth story. Of the 8,793 houses one half have more than two stories, 3,293 have but one story, and 1,308 have only a ground fcor. The population of the city consists of 473,957 Fouls living on an area of about five square English miles. Travellers declare that at present there is no country on the continent in which people are subjected to so little inconvenience by the passport and CustomI ouse emploijs as in Austria, and it is my belief that they speak neither mo: e nor less than the t.uth. They will, however, do well to recollect that tobacco is a State monopoly in Austria, and that any one who endeavours to smuggle ever so small a quantity of it is subjected to a heavy fine. Information has been received that Austria wished to negotiate a Treaty of Trade and Navigation with Russia, but that the St. Petersburg Cabinet declined to treat. A Governmental correspondent of the Frankfort Post Zeittung denies the correctness of the statement of the Constitutior,nel, that Baron von Prokesch insists on the evacuation of the island Of Perim. It is known to me that the Austrian Government is of opinion that the English have no just claim to the island, but it is by no means likely to take any step which could tend to increase the present embarrassment of England. Austrian rDilitary wen talk of nothing but the matiny in India, and continually express their surprise that Government does not endeavour to obtain volunteers by promising that those men who, on the showing of their comrades, have most distinguished themselves during an action shall immediately receive a certain rew'ard. Whenever this country Is at war there is a superabundance of volunteers, because every one knows that he can aspire to the very highest military honours, as the best man always gets the most rapid promotion. Meer All Khan, of Khyrpoor,* left Vienna for Trieste yesterday, as did the Tunisian Envov, General Ismael Sappa-Tappa. The latter produced a favourable impression here, and is really an amiable and good-natured man. According to advices from Mehadia,Sir Henry Bulwer has retu-rned to Bucharest. A lady arxived here not long since who calls herself a Gonzaga, and lays claim to the Duchy of MIantua. She affects to consider the treaties of 1816 so much waste paper, but the Austrian Government does not share her opinion, and she may find it more difficult to get out of this country than it was to get into it. As the murrain has broken out agaiu on the other side of the Transylvanian frontier, all foreign cattle are subjected to a quarantine of ten days. The last number of the Franl:forf Post Zeitu,sgj contains the followhig :- " FRANTEFORT, SEPT. 8. "A.ts the British Embassy In this city continually receives offers to take service in the English army, we are authoilse to state that at present the British Govers"nent does noP intend to form a foreign legion, and that foreigners cannot smrve in the English army."

THE NEWTV SCHEME FOR RECRV27TrNo. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Seeing the other day, in ny county town, a number of recraiting sergeants at work on market day, I inquired I what bounty they were offering for men. I was told, "' 21, and a free kit." Shortly afterwards Iread'in your columns the memorandaum 1isued by command of his Royal Highness the Commander. in-Chief, offering cormmissions on very easy educational t3rms to any young man who can contrive to raise 100 recrnits. The price of an ensigncy in the Line is 450!. Now, if I go into the market-place among the recraiting sergeants and give out that I want 100 men, that I will give 2!. 5s. a man for them, and 1. additional to the bringer, be he civillan or recruiting sergeant, it strikes me that I shall oertainly obtain 100 men at an outlay of 325l. before the recruiting sergeants obtain one man in the usual manner. Therefore I shall get my commi.ssion 125!. cheaper than if I had obtained it in the usual way. The Government will lose that 125., will not get a man more than they would had I not interfered, at their own suggestion, with their recruiting parties, and they will, moreover, in many cases, obtain the services of officers whose defective education would not have permitted them to enter the servioo had they been subjected to the ordeal recently prescribei for them by the Councl of Military Education at the Horse Guards. Another case occurs to me. The Government may raise the bounty, say to 61. a man and a free kit. If I wish still to enter the army, I have only to go down to the market-place and bid against their gergeants. I shall then have to pay, say 714 a man. This will increase the price of first commissions from 4501. to 700! But as long as I am in the market the Government recruiting must stop, and the result again will be that they will obtain no more men than they would have done had I not been instigated by themselves to bid against them, and they will get an inferior class of officer. Moreover, we know that in the late war no persons could be found willing to pay 450Z. for first commissions. Is It likely that at the prosent crisis persons will be found ready to pay 7001 for them ? I am of opinion that the bright picture which you so enthusiastically drew of the magnates of the land hurrying down to their ancestral domains, arousing their tenantry with the cry of " Rescue for India," and despatching them in bundreds, headed by their family cadets, to embark "for Delhi and vengeance," is rather of the Turner or Danby school than exactly true to nature. The magnates of the land-the noble, the wealthy, and the influeutial-who are in a position to use territorial influence, usually put their sons in the Guards if they put them in the army at all, for the Guards do not go to India or to the colonies. The class of men who enlist as privates in the Line are, perhaps, of al classes of EDglishmen the class least susceptible of ancestral prestige; the farrner, the farmer's son, and the farmer's labourer, if of good character, rarely enlist, and the middle classes never enlist, for they know that in thr British service there is no fair career open to them. Is it likely that in Hertfordshire we shall see the Dacres, the Grimstones, and the Cowpers -or in Oxfordshire the Dillons, the Churchills, and the Vlhierses, coming forth as ensigns of infantry at the head of their attached retainers and marching on Delhi ? I think not. And I am sure the Commander-in-Chief does not expect it; ror I know that it has been expressly stated to applicanta at the Horse Guards, that the young gentlemen who succeed in raislng 100 men, although they will obtain in retarn conmimlons, will not necesarily be appointed to the regiments in which their reornits will serve. The Eooner this crude experiment is withdran the bettor lor tte public servioe. A CIVILAN.
[ THE FATAL COLLIOH OFF DUVGZESS. In The Timeg of Satarday was a telegraphio notioe announcing the running down of the Dutch steamer 8ophie in ttehChfnnel off Dmenea s tld tohe loes of 12 of her Mnrgel and crewr. The n rviorso who ladod from plotL boat at Dover, have since been forwarded to London, on the way to their homes, by tbo Dutch OO.DuL Their stktent of the catastrophe ahows that the colisLion was one of AleTr ferful ebcter.

Thenightwas dark and somewhat stormy with rain, but all went well until bount a quarter past 1 on Friday morning, when she was about six miles off Dun e- Dsea pursuing her usual course down ChanneL The captamn, who ha his wifeon board, was below At the time; Mr. Ets,, the chief mate had charge of the watch on deck; he was on the forecastle deck, and a Bristol pilot named George iBerry was at the wheeL She was steaming at fUll speed, at therate of 8.t knots wn hour, when a steamer was suddenly observed approaching her about three times her own length off orn the port bow. The mate instantly caUed ont for the helm to be put ;port, hard a-port," and ran aft to see that it was done so. efore there was time, however, for her to answer her helm the ships came together with tremendous force. The approaching steamer, which proved to be the William Hutt, a powerful screw collier, bound to Shields, from Bavre, carne stem on and struckthe Sophie on the port side betweenl tbe fore bulkbead and foremast, cutting her down below tho water line. The shock produced the greatestdismay among tbose on board, and all who were asleep below rushed up on decc. It wag soon discovered that the Sophie was rl fiPing, but for some two or three minutes after the colision she was kept steaming ahead at her ful power, the order for her to stop not baving been given. Mr. John Sambrook, thc chief engineer, perceiving the TesEel was settling dow;n, then acted upon his own responsibility, and stopped the engines. The mischief, however, had been done. The connecting pipe of the ballast tanks at the bottom of the ship was Droken by the shifting and working about of the tanks, and the water thus found its way from the fore compartment into the engine-room and after part fo the vesseL rhe Sophie had two qnarter boata and a long boat. It is stated that the latter was lashed up endways by the foremast, and therefore very difficult to get clear. It is amserted, bowever that had anytbing liko prompt orders been given, the lash;ngs might easily have been cut, and the boat got over the ship's side. The captin was appealed to by the engincer, but the confusion still prevailed, and every man was looking out for tbe best chance to save hirself. Arush was made to the starboard quarter boat, and four of the hands gotinto it, butin loweringhershe was dashed against Sb, -ddo of the now rapidly silking steamer, andc seriously stove. The sns ilan got out of her, and made for the other quarter boat. In all 19 got into her, including the captain, his wife, a female passen ger, and Berry the pilot. As they were -bout to lower it the ropes were found to be secured to the davits. JUfit at this critical moment the bow of the steamer was seen to gradually disappear under water, and before there was time to get the ropes clear the ship went down, drawing with har the boat ana the whole of her unhappy occusparits, Only seven of them were saved. ldilson, a stoker, on coming to the surface of the water, was seized by the captain's wife, who held on to his jacket with a deatblike grasp. The poor fellow could not svwm, and, as her weight was aragging him down, he contrived to loosen her grasp, and aba disappeared. He then managed to get hold of an oil ca sk, upon which he floated some 20 minutes before la was picked up. lex, anotber of the crew, saved himself, vith a dog, upoa a piece of hatchway, and others were preserved by clinging to pieces of bulwark. The remaining four survivors, SLmbrook, the engineer, Ets, the inate, Morgan, the second engineer, and Vincent, the tok-er, took to the disabled quarterboat just as the vessel wAs sinkinn. The boat, however, was filling with water and they expected every moment to sbare the same fato as their unhappy ship. They took off their clothing aud stuffed it ia the aoles which had been stove, and so kept her afloat until they were picked up by a boat from the William Eutt. The latter brought up within 1T5yards of the Sophie and immediately sent ber bostsato the aid of the crew. Owing to the darkness which prevailed it was some 20 minutes or half bour before the whole of the survivors were picked up. Tho Wiliaam Hutt remained near the spot for some time after. wards in the hope of rewsing more of those on boad the Sophie, and then continued her courso to the Down; -where the survivors were put on board a Dover pilot boat and landed at Dover at 7 o'clock on Friday morning. The Willam Hutt sustained serious damage to her stem, and her fore compartment was reported to be full of water. Very fortanately abe ws light. Had she beea loaded the probability is that she would have gone dowx with the Sophie.

MURDER NEAR CLIFTOZ. A murer has been committed, apparaently under very atrocious circumstances, in Night'ngale-vaUey, Leigh. wvoods, near Clifton. About 7 o'clock on Friday evening, as a gainekeeper, in the employ of Mr. W. J5iles, MI.P., was passing along the north side of Nightingale-valley, near the rabbit warren, he discovered the body of a wvoman lying on the ground, with her arms extended, and her face covered with blood quite dead. The keeper raised an alarm, and on examining the body it was discovered that the woman's throa. was frightfuUy cut from ear to ear, and the head nearly severed from the trutk. There is also a wound on the right side of the head, apparently caused hy a bullet, though this can be only ascertained by a post rlnsr examination. There were no other marks of violence on the body, and no instrnment of death was found near it. The deceased appears to have been about 30 years of age; she is of diminutive stature, rather handsome, and is dressed in a gray alpaca gown, friled round the neck and down the front, with kid boots, and two skirts, one gray and the other white. She had no bonnet. At present the deoea is unknown, bat there can be no doubt that she has been crueUy murdered. The gamekeeper states that he passed the spot on Thursday afternoon in going his rounds, and from this, as weU as from the freshness of the wounds, the crime was- apparently perpetrated in the course of Friday. Since her death some of the flesh of the throat has been torn away, it is supposed, by rats. The body has been removed to the Neew Inn at Rownham Ferry, and information of the melancholy occurrence has been forwarded to the coutty coroner, r. 13. Fry, who wil hold an inquest. During the summer several picnic parties have taken place in Leigh-woods, and have been prolonged on some oecasioas until midnight, and persons have taken refreshmentj at the cottaes in the woods, and then stroUed away to Nightingale Valley, and in many cases the women bave left their shawls and bonnets a' the cottages. This mnay possibly farnish a clue to theidentification of the body, and explain the fact that the deceased was without a bonnet. The crime has been committed in the oounty of Somerset, beyond the jurisdiction of Bristol, but the city polloe are on the alert. Somathinj hA already oocurred which may possibly assist in unraveling the mystery of this murder. A woman named Bowden, who keeps a beerhouse in Dowxy-plAce, at a short distance from the scene of the murder on the Bristol side of the water, states that, between 12 and 1 o'clock on Thursday or Friday mvorning last, a woman dressed simtlarly to tbo deceased, accompanied by a young man in sailor's dress, came to her honce and asked for some Devonshire cider. They were supplied with a pint, but not liking the beverage it was exchanged for beer, for which the womani p'id. 3Mrs. Bowden remarked at the time that the purso from which the money was taken was nearly fnU of sovereigns. In the coue of some conversation with Mrs. Bovwden the woman stated that sbe came down from Hull to Bristol by the midnight train on the preceding evening, and that she was going on to Appledore, Devonshire, to meet her busband who was the captain and owner of a timber ship whieh had just arrived at that port from Quebec. She also exhibited her dress (which was one of gray alpaca) to hMrs. Bowden, and said ahe found it very convenient for travelling. During the conversation the young man went out of the room for a few minutes, and Mrs. Bowden, finding that he ws only an acquaintance made on the journey from Rull, cautioned the woman not to expore her money. She replied that the young man had behaved very kindly to her, and was going on by the same train with her in the afternoon, and that In the interval they were gOing to see Leigh woods and the suspension bridge. Mrs Bowvden, -wbo is a native of Appledore, gave the woman the names of some friends of hers at that place wvith whom she oould lodge on her arrival. She expressed her thanks to Mrs. Bowden, and promised to call aain on her way back to the train. She did not, however, fulfil her promise, and a neighbour who happened to be in the shop at the time, having seen the description of the decemed, called Mrm. Bowden s attention to its remarkable simllarity with that worn by the woman whom she had seen in her shop under the eircumstanows already stated. M Bowden accordingly saw the body of the deceased yesterday morning, and although the features are too much disooloured to prevent ber from positively yecogniztng In them those of Fte woman she saw in her shop, she sates that the dreu e.'nc2y oorresponds, and that ai has no moral doubt that the murdered woman and the one whom she saw alive in company with the young sailor are the same person.

(FxOM OUlB OWit CoRagSPO A r"Rw ,AR1.2, SArT,anY, S . 12 The Minister of the Interior bss received a despatch from Cagliari describing the operation of laying the telegraphic cable from Algeria to Teulada in Sardinia. Teulada being conneeted with Cagliari by telegraph, a compulete conunuication exists between EuXope and Afica This is the second time the operatioa was &ttempted. Last year the telegraphic cable embarked on board the Result was lost a few leagues from Galita. The present cable is 162 miles long, contains aix conducting wires, and weighs 1,250 tons. The preparatory soundings required to ascertaiu the exact direction to be given to the cabie were executed by order of the Minister of Marine, and were finiihed at 12 o'clock on the 29th of July. The sare day the ship so employed touched at Cagliari, and a despatch was transmitted by telegraph to Paris to announce -what had been done. There were three lines of soundings made. The first commencing at Cape Malfatano, in Sardinia, proceeds to the east of the Island of Galita, then takes a bend towards Monte Rotondo, and ends on a shore easy of access, and presents all desirable security for the cable. The length of this line of soundings is 125 sea miles (60 to a degree). The greatest depth isfrom ],900to2,000yards, and this mo...ri mum depth extenda only 10 miles. This was the line chosen last year for laying the electric cable, and was rejected this year in consequence of the last accident. The line now chosen takes its direction from Spartivento to Cape Gsrde, and presents a horizontal distance of 125 miles. The depth during the half of this distance is more thaa 2,000 metres, and the 71u.,)imum 2,600 metres. The bottom is formed of gravel, coral, and soft yellow mud. This line has the advantage of bringing the cable directly to Bona, in a safe place, sufficiently deep. It was there that the laying of the cable -as commenced. There axe still 17 miles of cable wanting to complete the commraunication withSpartivento. The correspondence with Bona was always perfect during the entire pa3sage.

VOLUNTEER TROOP,% TO THE EDITOli OF TEIP TIMES. Sir,-The sudden demarnd for troops in Inda, and the necessity of sending them there immediately, engross public attention. As I was in the 'Tiited States when the xiews arrived that GeneralTaylor audhis army were cut off by the Mexican forces opposite Matamoras, allow ne to suggest a few facts, to show how that countryundertook to supply soldiers for the demarnds of wrar. The regular army of the United States amounted only to 11,000. These were scat. tored through the extent of that immense country in garri. sons. Only a very small part was available at the seat of war. The hostilities of Mexico took us by surprise. We did not believe they would dare to invade Texas, The way the Federal Government proceadeod a simple. An army wa5 voted, and the President aathorized to call out so any regiments, each State, through the Governor, furnishing its quota. These regiments were composed of volunteers, to serve for a certain period, andto be diabanded ater the war. A tcan wishing to enrrol a corapany would call & meeting in any town, and when the requisite number of names were entered the list Was submitted to the Governor, who entered them as cormpany s>-and-so of such a regiment. The company then elected their own captain, leutenants, sergeants, and corporals, the -President appointed regimental officers-these men receIved A stlipulated pay from the Fede. ral Government while the war continued, and were given bounty land from 40, or 60, or 160 acres after their termn of service in proportior to the period they served. By this simple process the Government could raise 100,000 men in a month. When tho regimentswere required the compAsses assembled at designated dep6ts, and then regimental officeri took command to aot under the direction of the Urited States' Government, and discipline was enforced as in the regular service. It was these men who fought at Buona Vist and Mon. terey, who stormed the entrenohmerets at Chutabusco, Ceno Gorda, and the Mational bridge. The Texan Rangers, the best rihemen in the army, under Colonel Walker, himef a volunteer, inflicted a greater loss on the enemy and per. formed greater acts of valour than any of the regular reg. inents. 'I e soldiers raised in this way-and they composed a m ajority of the army, which never numbered more than i2,000 eTective men-mnarcbed from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico amid an incensed population, throagh one of the most difficalt countries for rmilitary operations, surrounded by Guerillas, stormed mountain passes defended by armle more numerous than themselves, and finally "conquetoe a peace" in the capital of the country. The troops that fought under Jackson at Nvew Orleans, under Scott a.t Lundy's-lane, and Harrison at the battle of the Thames, were mostly raised in this way. Sometimes they may have takeLi panics, as at Blladensburgh and at Camden; but the regulars under Bradock, near PittsbuLrgh, and Hessians at Trenton, have done the same. It seems to me there are thousands of adventurous spirit3 In Engsland, Scitland, and Ireland, who, like their brethren in America, dislike enlisting in the regular army, and whom a love of excitement and patriotio motives would indtce to floek as volunteers under thoer country's banner to any quarter of the world where national honour or interest called theou. Those thus volunteering would be mostly young men of education and ambition, and who could leoa rnilitary manwuvres in a month, at least for all purposes of an Indian campaig. Milxing 'with soldiers of the Line they would soon learn the habits of veterans, and in the end would become valuable colonists, wherever their Government saw fit to assign them lands. I have seen the workings of this system so weU in the 'United States that I am convlnced of its utility. Wvhat is the need of employing CaIfres from the Capo, as has been mooted, or from Germany, men who feel no national honour, ard who are actuated solely by mercenary motives, while you areo every year losing thousands of young men --aye, and married ones, too, by emigration to America, because there is no field open for them at homae' The American backwoodsman, who is encouxraged to the far West byathe prospect of Government grants, supplies the place of regular troops on the frontier; they organizA in case of danger into irregular companles for mutual defence, become bush-fighters par r-cdl.cnce, and with rildes drive back hostile tribes of Indians; they improvo and farm the -wilderness and add to national wealth without national expenditure. 'Twas In this way Ohio, Kentucky, and many of the Western States wero conquered and settled. What prevents Southern Afrca from feeling the same inafuenoe ! It was not soldiers and colonias that reclained the " Originsl thirteen States ;" while France, trusting to her regular army, and by not eneouraging emigration sufciently, left Canada a military waste, the fate of whick was doddede by a single battle, which could never happen in a colony.

The steam aip New uranada arrived at Panama on the 21st of August with the South Pacific mail, and advice from CaUso July 12, Yalparaiso July 3L From Valparaiso wve learn that an amnesty was granted to all persons who on account of the part they took in the events of 1851 have been, or may be, indicted, and who reside at present in the The leaders of the Conservative party, who have hitherto supported the Government, and the Liberals have united and formed a strong party against the Government. They demand a change in the Cabinet and a more liberal line of policy. Late advices announce that the Ministers had presented their resignation, and it had been accepted by the President. Nothing is said as to theii successors, and some persons are of opinion that the new Cabinet will not be appointed until September. Datea from Callao are to August 12, which give intelligence of the assasination of Alr. S. E. Sulivan, British Minister at Lima. The following particulars are from the Callao correspondent of the Panama &tar and .Rerald:- "News has just been sent from Lima that Mr. Sulivan, the British Minister, was assassinated by six Pertvians. The Vixen has gone to Paita in search of Admiral Bruce. It is supposed that he was murdered for the British interference in the matter of the Tunbes and loa, I have just received the particulars of the affair:-Mr. Sullivan was dining alone, when six men, masked, entered and fired three shots, one of which Is fatal, having entered the groin and passed up Into the lungs. Aftr the deed was done one of them exclaimed, ' I si now sathfied,' and then they all disappeared. As yet no one is suspected for It. There is a desire on the part of the Peravlans to put off the whole matter as the refult of an intrigae with a lady. Be that as it may, the Government feel abarmed as to wh t the results wil be. The steamers Ucalya and Tunlbos are going south to bring back General Castills, and probably some troops." ' Ca o, Aug. 12, 3 p.m.-A Frenchman and a negro have been just arrested on suspicion of being accomplices of the assassination of Mr. Sullivn. There are not the slightest hopes of his recovering. It is now reported that the act was committed by some of the most respectable persois in Lima. However, I will give you the rumour. It appears a short time ago a ball vas given by one of the leading fan,fliPA in TLima, and that Mr. Salivan took them a wellknown prostitute that he has kept a long time as his mistress; the gentlemen present remonstrated with him, calling his attention to the fact that it was a gross insult to all persons present; to which he Is said to have replied that she was as good as auy woman present or in Lima, and that they were all a set of prostitutes. A reward of 100 ouncs4 is offered for the apprehension of the 2aurderers. Ths steamer will be searched by the Retribution as soon as sha gets out of the harbour." The conduct of the Peruvian ofaicials towards American vessels had eaUed for the interference of the IJnited States7 Minister. Private letters state that the presence of an Anericanvessel of war was much needed on the coast. The Government of Ecuador had notified its adhesion to the convention entered into between Pera and Chili in September, 1856. General Castillo, on his return to Callao, had been placed under arrest by the Council of Ministers, who exercised the sulpreme p)ower during the absence of the President. Castillo bad published a letter complaining of this outrage. The matter was referred to the convention, which disclaimed the action of the Council. Her British Majesty's steam-frigate Retibution arrived at Callao on the 6th, and the Magiclenne sailed on the 7th for Paita and Panama. During the month of July 60 ships, with an aggregate tonnage oE 47,369 tone register, loaded at the Chincha Islands with guano-viz., 43 vemsels of 34,309 tons, for England; 4 of 3,755 tons, for the Unite~ States; and 13 of 9,305 tons, for France. CALIFORNIA. The steemship Golden Age, from San Francisco August 5 arrived at Panama August 19, with about 500 passengers. There is but little news by this arrivaL Several coifAagratlons had occurred during the fortnight in the towns in the interior of the State. On the 25th of July the town of St. Louis (Sierra county) was almost entirely destroyed by fire. On the 22d of July a fire broke out at Michigan Bluffs (Placer county), destroying 67 buildings. The adoptionl of the State DE;ebt (declared illegal), boy populaBr vote at the coming election seemed to meet with little opposition. Politics had been the all-absorbing topic in this State. lThe American party had a set of candidates in the field for all the State offices. It was as follows :-Fpr Governor, G.

IBON SHXPS. TO TEE EDITOR OP THE TIMES. Sir,-I have read " Angle Iror's" letter in your impression of to-day, and agreo with him as to the desirability of improved construction, but I do not agree with him when he says this is the only thing needful. I maintain that the quality of the material used, be it wood or iron, is of very considerable importhace. Within the last few years an article bas been Introduced nto the iron trade caUed boat plates, or ship plates, being made especialy for building ships, and is considered by the ironmasters and %hipbuilders good enough for that purpose, though for little else. Thirteenyears ago my firm launched an iron ship:although iron was then very cheap she cost us nearly 251. per ton; but what was the result? Why, except for scraping ard painting, we have never laid out in the whole 13 years 131. on her hull. She is built of best boiler plate, and still insures at Lloyd's as low as any 14-year wooden ship aloat. 'We are now building a small experimental ship on an mproved mode of constiaction. We wore offered ship plates for her at 91. lOs. per ton. We preferred paying lit. for boiler plates. LAoyd's committee have lately decided that in future all hon ships must -have the name of the maker of the iron stamped on each plate. So far well; but the surveyor should be a man who, by previous training, knows the makers of good iron froin bad. " Angle Iron's" remark that a good lron ship ought to be as strong as a wooden one is very amusing. The old ship alluded to once went ashore at the top of high water in the China Seas on a hard rock with all her cargo on board; she was got off next tide, and not a particle of her cargo was damaged. The ury to the ship was not repaired until her return to Engl..d, whea it cost the not very alarming sum of 5s. to do it. I I am, Sir, your obedient servant. COLD BLAST. I Liverpool, Sept. 11.
THE RECENT ROBBSY OF 50O1. rnLivERPoOL.- At the Licerpool Police-court on Saturday, before Mr. J. S. Mansfleld, the stipendiary magistrate, Thomas Pimm, Louisa, his wife, and John Rice were brought up in custody of Inspector burphy and several other detective officers on a charge of having been connected with the recent robbery of 5171. from the establishment of Mr. Kearns, vwine and spirit merchant, Park-lane. Mr. Murphy sa:d that on the 30th of August last he reoeived information of an extensive robbery from the promises of Mxr hearns. He went to examine the place, and found that an iron safe in the inner office, which had contained 5171., had been opened and the money abstracted. The door of the safe had been bored through with a drill, but the hole had been too high np, and did not take effect upon the lock. The burglars, after the failure of this attempt hAd proceeded to search in other parts of the promiss 1n one drawer which had been brolen o a duplicate key of the safe had been found, with which the bur. glars had opened the safe. Mr. Kearns was then examined, and staed that be left his establishment about 6 o'clock in the evening of Saturday, August 29. A little before he, looked over and counted his money, which be deposited in the safe; the total amount was 5171. On the Sunday morning he was told that his p1ce had been robbed, and went down to his offlice. He found the safe and drawers open, and the offiee In confusion. The safe was in his private office. He had examneod the money found in possession of the prisoners and identified three sovereigns as havig been in his safe; each of the coins dpecuiar marks. Edward Lewis. the manager of Mr. Kearids establishment, stated that he closed the premises about 20 mntutes past 12 o'clock on the night in question. About 11 o'clock ha saw the prisoner Rice in the bar drinking, but did not aotice what became of him. This witness identified another sovereign which was found In the prisoner's possession. Detective Sanford, of the Manchester police, stated that one evening he and Bite. man, another detective, werc passing along Bedford. street, Chorlton, when they observed a light in a beer. house in the street. They entered the house, and pro. ceeded upstairs, where they found Thomas Pimm, and took him into custody, as well as Rice, whom they also found. After handing the two prisoners over to other officers, the detectives proceeded to search the house, ancd found a large quantity of tooLc, &c., used by burglar The femeale prisoner was attempEneg to make her escape, when they apprehended her.

The United States' mail zteamshlp Atlantic, hence, arrived at Nevr York on the 30th ult. The following despatch respecting the Athnmtic cable had been received at the Navy Department from Captain Hudson, of the Niagara : United States' Steam frigate Niaara, I Plymouth, England, Aug. 14I "Sir,-I have the bonour as well as the 3mortification to report the *rrnvaa of the Xiagar at this port. after ha ia run ont 334 m-les of the tegraphic cable, somo portions of it in a depth of over2,050 fathoms, or more than two miles and a quarter, when it was broken by too much presmrc on the break attached to the machinery for paying it out. I have every reason to believe, from 'what we have thus far experienced in wire laying, that under ordinary circoumstnces of weather, and machinery adapted to the purpose-for such as we have on board requires ultering and Improving-the cable may be laid in sJety on the track marked out over the Atlantic Ocean. *'At the timue the cable parted-Augut 1i, 3 45 am.- the ship was going along four knots, and had been rmnnirg at the rate of from three to four knots through the night, with some motion from a moderate head sea, and the com. pany's chief engineer and men attending their breaks to lessen the expenditure of cable, until they finally carried It away, which made all hands ofus through the day like a household or famrily which had lost their dearest friend, for offlicers and men had booDme deeply intere4ted in the suocess of the entern's Mr. a CA the ship soon after the accident occurred, in Her Britannic Majest's steam brig Cyclops, for Valeaia Bay, Ireland, requesting that the Niagara, Suqueihanna, and Agamemnon should prooeed to this place, after making certain expeorients with the vire and machinery in deep water. Tih Leoprid procoeded at once to Spit. head. "Whether the- company intend to supply additional cable and try it gaia this season, or defer it until next season, I am as yet unadrised. If the ltter, the wire wlU have to be taken out of the ship and retarred, to save it from the effects of rust. I presume a few dxys wrill solve their present difficulties at to further action; and if the effort is not to be renewed At this late season of the year I shall require further instructIons to govern my future proceedings with this ship. "Your obedient servant, -" Wm. L. RuDsoT, Captain. ERon. L Touccy. Secretary of tho N1Zy." It is stated that this letter was accompanied by one from Mr. Charles T. Bright, engineer to the Atlantic TelegraPh Company, speakdng in the highest terms of Captain Hudson and all on board, and concluding by saying,- " I feel it my duty, before leaving the Niagara, to state that I do not consider the freatu of tho cable to be In the least degree attached'to any one connected with the ship. On the contrary, I mast take this opportunity of expreon. ing, on the part of the company, the great oblgations we are under to the offices and yourself and men; and I wi estesm it a favour Uf yOu will thank them on my behalf for the never-failing seal and attention bhich have so universally been displayed in oar causea" lt it asserted :that a trial of -speed wasraaadfs between the Niagara and Susquehanna and the Aga. memnon on their return to port, and that the former passed the atter easily. Thae race" is thus described in the, ashiny"So Stai- " We had something of a race to-day, and a good desl of excitement for awhile. The Agamemnon and the Nliagra ha-ve each large fenderasor yards over their propellers. The former has a load of about 1,500 tons, and we now about 1,150, both load and guard not much of an sssistance in a race, and besides Iwas a littleafraid of the Agamemnon, as every one deolares in England that she can steam 11 or 12 knots easily, and I thought certainly the Susquehanna would lead us badly. TI this trim we are. So, with al the3e reasons, Iamanagedto keep little baok than otherwise. This morning ai 9 the Susquehanna was about two miles a-head, aud we were -ust abeam of the Agamemnon. Captain Sands signalized ' I am going to Plymoth,' as much as to say, I can't wait for such slow coaches. I asked-Captain Hudson to let us try and go to Portsmouth also. Each ship's smoke-pipes told the story of hard frng at once. The sea was smooth, and the wind light after us, smoke just up and down when at full speed. At 5 p.m. the relative positions were nearly as follows :-The Agamemnon was more than hull down astern. We could just see her smoke, and the Susqnebanna was about seven or eight miles astern. As Captain Hudson wanted tokeep company with the Agaanemnon, we stopp-d and waited for her. The Niagara's speed was 12 knots in the conotest" A sum of between $200,000 and $300,000 had been paid to Maryland by the Treasury Department as interest on half a-million dollars, which amount tbe 'Inited States became indebted to laryland during the war of 1812.

In consequence of the wholesale seduction of women on board the American emigrant ships, tl*e New York Commissioaers of Emigration have begun to publish the names of the captains of ships in which such disgraceul proceedings occur. The military expedition for Utah had been ordered to proceed to its destination. Dr. Formy had accepted the appointmnent of superintendent of Indian affairs in Utah. General Earney or Colonel Johnson would have the comnmaand of the force. Ten companies had been despatched to Kansas to replace those ordered to Utah. The New YorI- Times states that one-third of the force selected for the expedition had deserted. Dr. Rae's schooner the Iceberg, with which he intended next spring to go in search of Sir John Franklin's remains, is supposed to have been lost on Lake Ontario with all on board. There waa a scarcity of seamen at New York, and wages had advanced. A sanguinary engagement, resulting in the defeat of a large body of Chevenne Indians by the United States' troops under Colonel Sumner, had taken place. The loss on the side of the troops waa very trifling. The steamer vwith the California mails of the 5th ult. arrived at New Orleans on the 30th, and reported that the steamshp Illinois, from Aspinwall tor New York, with the mails and $1,600,000 in specie, went ashore on Colorado Reef, but was towed off and proceeded to Havannah. Several large fires had occurred in the interior of California. From Yucatan we learn that the whole of the State was in arms, and that the revolutionists were successful everywhere. The Governor was marching against Campeachy with 1,500 men. At Havannah on the 24th ult. sugars were dull, and prices had declined; Nos. 12 and 13 were quoted at 14i reals.

Letters from Honduras report that the engineer corps of the railway were progressing rapidly with their undertaking. It is stated that the British Government had appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Stanton, Royal Engineers, and Sergeant James Finch to proceed to Hlondaras to review the work now in progress, and to report to the Government on the route generally. From Central America there is no news of interest.

Iln its review of the market for the three previous days the New York Cornmerci.d List of the 29th ult, says:- "Finimoial affairs continue in a '*psm,' thogh yesterday a more confident feeling obtaine, and thiDgs had evidently takeT a turn for the better.

There were repors m ciculatio ayesterday affecting the Erie Railroad Compauy, but the proinot action of several of the strongest banks in coming forward to give that corporation reneowed aaunce of financial sapport had a very favonrable influence npon Its stock at the Second Board, and contiibuted materially to inspire confidence generally. It is nest to iapossible to expect loans to any extent uapon railroad stocks as collateral securitv. Under thetar, -eed, it would be wonderful if this were not the caue.

THE UNYITED STATBS. I| (FROM OUR OWN CORRYSPOND°° .) N1EW YORK, SBer. 2. Ihave at last seen a panic. I have heard of fdghtened buffaloes rushing thousauds strong before a! single horsemanu, over the prairiesx, and hurling themselves down the precipices that line ths banks of Western rivers; I have seen foolish sheep follow a terrified leader over stone walls, picket fences, running brooks, and prickly hedges; and I bave beeu told, by those who had seen a commercial town in a panic, that men had in such times no more sense than the buffalo, And no more courage than the sheep. I confess that a limited knowled,ge of the race led me to doubt an imputation which I now feel to be trae. I have seen the frightened mase blindly follow the more frightened leader and tumble all headlong together. There has been, A panic in New York, Unprecedented in commercial and financial circles. Thoso who remember the scenes of 1837 (of whom I am happy to Esy I am not one), when the whole country fell in one mass of ruins, from WLhich even the recuperative energy of America could reconstruct nothing for half a-dozen years, tay that those days must yield in interest to the week that has passed. As age generally claims for that portion of the past which it exclusvely remzem_ bers a character superior to that part which it shares in common with younger mon, I am inclined to believe that the lock-up and tumble-down which it hbu been my fortuno to see and to study is somethiDg very peculiar even in this country of contrasts. The railwaY floating debt has been the prima cause of the trouble. I have so often dwelt upon the great extension of the railway system in the Western States, and your readers are so familiar with it, independently of any letters of mine, that It is needless to speak of it now. It is only necessary to say, in this connexion, that these great highwaya have not been constructed without the contraction of great debts, and the absorption of a great amount of the capital concentrating at New York. To say nothing of the vast amount of railway bonds which have been created within the past 10 years, all the great lines have been for a long time borrowers in the New York market on their acceptances; and as they have generally been willing to pay the highest rates of interest, and have offered collateralsecurity, supposed to be immediatelyavail. able, at a lage margin, their paper has been preforred to ordinary commnercial paper. This facility in obtaining money led the great lines on till the aggregate floating debt of a few of them -say the Michigan Southern, the Michi an Central, the New York and Erie, the New or Central, and the Illinois Central-amounted to between $l0,000,000 and $12,000,000. When it is remembered that the aggregate capital of these corporatioDs exceeds $140,000,000 and that their net earnings are $10,000,000 or 812,000,000, this does not appear to be a large snmu; but, when it is considered that the New York bank line of discount was on the 22d of August only $120,139,582, and the day before yesterday only $116,588,919, you will see that it was a very large sum for a few borrowers to owe in troublesome times The "bears" have for a long time been " operating" in view of this great amount of railway indebtedness. They have reasoned Ona these grounds-that there is always a tight money-market in Newr York between the crops. Between the produce bills of one year and anotherthere are always heavy shipments of specie to cover the importations. This country has been for so short a time a producer of gold that its merchants have not yet got to regard it in the light of merchandise, as one of the ordinary products of the country, as much so as cotton or corn. Consequently, whenever the gold begins to go, maoney begins to comnand high rates in 'New York. The " bears " also reasoned that the low receipts of the great railways, caused by the short crops, would affect the value cf their securities. The country, until this year, had never recovered fromn the great drought of 1854. The Western crops have been required at home. The railway receipts have consequently been diminished on all the principal lines, while the same causes have made money dearer to them in New York, the great monetary centre of the country. These causes alone were sufficient to justify the gamblers of the Stock-Exchange in operations against the credit of all railway securities. Added to then camne gigantic operations in sugar, sbared between Cii-Atlantic and Transatlantic houses of the first commercial standing. This product of the West Indies, to the amount of millions of dollars, has been bought at high prices, and i5 now held for an advance, although daily w,rasting away under the influence of summner suns. These speculators also are bidders for money, and, as they are. represented by the first commnercial houses of the country with great accumulated capital and excellent credit, their renewals find better favour than the domestic railway bills. For somae months past there has been a decreasing disposition to loan on railway collateral. The " bears" pressecl hard at the brokers' board upon the securities of first one and then another corporation until confidence began to cease in good and bad alike. Lenders on such securities found their margins more than used up, and called for fresh collateral. The Michigan Southern at last went to protest under the pressure. A dash was then made on the Western road, and, with the lack of confidence, nobody felt stroug enough to hold them up. In the midst of this the Ohio Life and Trust Company, oue of the most Conservative and beast-esteemed banking-houses on the continent, suddenly, and to the gurprise of everybody, stopped, hampered with railway loans. The suspension of the Bank of England could hardly take the town more by surprise, This company was originally established as a Life Assurance and Trust Company in Cincinnati, in the State of Ohio; but it fbund it more profitable to employ its credit in domestic exchange. It established a branch In New York, and has for many years been the principal dealer in W1'estern exchange upon New York, a safe and profitable busine.s. Its Ntew York connexions drew the branch into railway loans, and, in the absence of any statement, the most that we now know is that it stopped in consequence. This was the signal for the commencement of a panic wbich has since been steadi]y increasing. The weakest fell firat. On the day following the explosion the reports of one and another and another fall came successively, and as close upon each other as the messages of evil to Job, though I question whether our estimable bank managers imitated the example of that pious patriarch. lVhen the smoke cleared away it was found that no great amount of damage had been done. Then the real struggle began. Confidence was entirely destroyed-the word is not too stroug. Alen undoubtedly worth balf-a-million found it difficult to obtain on any security the means to keep themselves from protest. The disbelief in the value of property eXtended from railway shares to all secuxities. The Ohio Loaftof 1886, which was awsrded in New Y-ork lst winter at 104, sold yesterdy on a forced tale on an average of 92 and a fraction ; yet there is nothing in the financial condition of Ohio making it worth a penny less now than it was then, The failure of the Ohio Life and Trust. Company does not affect the finances of the State. lt even affects the private banks in t'he State. of which it was the correspondent, less than was feared. It had taken their collection paper to a large amount, and hypothecated it for its own debts. It was feared that this would cripple them and cause them to suspend. They have taken steps to reclaim their collections if the law will allow, and have stood their owlrn up to this time. The only cause for such a depreciatioW in the secuitiesi of a prosperous State like this is the entire want of confidence in anything. The man that has money buttons his pockets and keeps it. Yesterday was the most exciting day I bave ever seen in Wall-street. The September coupons on the Erie eecond aDd third mortgage bonds matured, and the company were without means to meet them unless the banhs would advance $600,00O. It was not until midday that tho banuls agreed to do it. Meanwhile Wall-streot wns crowded witli people awaiting the result, in tho belief that if Erie were carried ovor the difficulty confidenice would be restored, but if it went to protest the little that was left mast tumble to pieees.

NVORWICH MUSICAL FESTIVAL. NORWICH, SFPT. 12. The twelfth triennial musical festival at Norwich will commence on Tuesday, and as the meeting has now continned for 33 years, it may be interesting to give a few particulars with reference to its past history. The festival was originated on the 18th of October, 1823, by the governors of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and it was Bubstitcted for the annual performance of an oratorio in Norwich CathedraL It was not determined, however, to hold it periodically till the 20th of October, 1827, when the governors of the hospital, emboldened by success, resolved that in future the meetings should be triennial. The festival has since continued with varying success, an inde. pendent comnmittee of management having conducted it aincelS3S; but the pecuniary results have never been sosatisfactory as those which followed the first effort. This will be shown by the foHowing statement of the receipts and expenditure at each meeting. Year. Receipts.

The committee have been accused in some quarters of unnecessary prodigality, but the figures just quoted show that on the stw o ocossons there was a great reduction in the expenditure; and, however much the non-success of their labours may be regretted, no blame appears to be attached to them In this respect. The real difficulty appears to be that since the introduction of railway communication into the distriot the money appropriated by the local public to purposes of amusement has been diverted into otherchannels. Through railway communication between the metropolis and Norwich was established in July, 1845, and it will be seen that the receipts at the subsequent festivals have since gradually declined:- Vear.

They avoided this Scylia. but unfortunately encountered Charybdis in the shape of festivals In other parts of the country. They therefore wisely returned into their old track, and it is to be hoped that this year the untiring efforts made by the intelligentgentlemen whocompose the committee of management will be rewarded with better success. There is certainly a cloud on the horizon in the shape of the Indian troubles, but the gloom which pervaded the public mind in the autumn of 1834, before the storm burst in the Crimea, was very great, and in this respect the present festival does not come before the public undor less favourable auspices. On the other hand, the city and district have enjoyed for the last three years a very general prosperity. War taxation has ceased, peace prices navo returned, and but for the Indian difficulty the-re would be little to complain of. The committee of maiagement hope, moreover, to welcome many visitors beyond the boundaries of East Anglia, and a journey to the eurious old city of Norwich would repay the trouble of those who are strangers to the locality. To recur to the past. The festival has handed over to the local charities sinee its establishment the following Eums:- NorfolkandNorwich iloipital .£5.18 1 West Norfolk and Lynn Hospital. 70 0 0 Great Yarmouth Hopiltal. 645 0 0 Norwich Dspensa. . 267 7 9 NorWich E-e IBrenary .227 7 0 Norwich Bind Hospit. . 227 7 0 Norwich Sick Poor Society .190 0 0 Norwich Lyingin Charity.io o .

As there were ony 5,945 persons present at the unfortunate festival of 1854, and the sale of tickets will still continue five or six days, it must be considered that a very good start has been made.

Probably no play has been more frequently acted at this house, but here Shakspeare never tires, and, moreover, a gentleman ;who is almost idolized by his own public, both s a manager and as an actor, had to be welcomed after several months' absence.

IRELAND. (FROM! OUR OWN CORtESMONDENT.') DUBLIN, SATURDAY MoliOsNMG. STATE OF BELFAST. Instead of showing any symptoms of subsidence, the Belfast riots are daily aasuIing a more serious aspect, and it is evident from the tone of the last accounts that it will require no small amount of executive energy to prevent the spread of the social disorder which for a period of exactly two months this day has been festering without anv attempt being made by the authorities to stay its progress. The Dublin journals have despatched reporters to the scene of the disturbances, and the papers of this morning contain ample communications descriptive of the state of the town up to a late hour last night. To give a fair idea of the lengths to which matters have proceeded it will be necessary to quote pretty extensively from the information thus supplied. Here is a sketch from the Tory or Conservative side:- "I cannot fully describe to you the state of excitement that prevails among the lovser classes in Belfast-and, indeed, I may say it has spread also among the higher classesconsequent upon the riotous proceedings that take place in this toown every night. Suffice it to say, we never had any. thing like it before. In certain districts, since Sunday, the utmost terror and alarm are felt by the people, and hundreds of them do not go to bed until 3 or 4 o'clock in themorning, lest an attack should be made on their lives or property. There is a large police force in town, but it is not suficient to prevent the disturbances. At present, the constabulary force numbers 210 men, including Sub-Inspector ely, from Armagh, with 50 men; Sub Inspector Armstrong, from Newry, with 50 men; Sub-Inspector Taylor, from Antrim, with the like number; and Sub-Inspector Bindon, of Belfast, with 60 men, being 30 more than are permanently stationed here. They are all under the command of Mr. Williams, countyinspectorforAntrim. Besidesthese wehave the military, but it is now considered this force is still insufflcient, and this day there are to arrive in Belfast 50 of the constabulary from the depOt in Dtublin, 6I from varfous districts in the county of Down, and 50 from the county of Louth. They wil all be required, it is expected, on Sunday next, when open air preaching will be followed up by the Rev. Mr. Hanna and other clergymen, it is said, of the Presbyterian Church. There is no use in concealing the fact, -arrangements and preparations are being made by the people, protestants and Roman Catholics, to ' fight it out' the first opportunity. All that the authorities can do wiUl be done to prevent bloodshed, and if they succeed in their object they will merit the thanks of the respeotable and peaceable portion of this community. This morning the dead waUsof the town are covered with addresses from the Rev. Mr. Hanna, telling his followers to be on the qui vive for Sunday next, as he and others are determined to assert their rights and privileges as freemen. HIe does not say where the open air sermons will be delivered, but hb tells them they will be delivered in certain places which for the present shall not be mentioned, as the Ronianists wvould endeavour to stop them by swearing information that a breach of the peace was apprehended. A public meeting is to be held this evening at 7 o'clock for the purpose of establishing a I Protestant Defence Association.' Admission is to be charged for at the door. Last night the excitement in Sandy-row, Pound-street, and CaUlintree-road was unbounded. Between li and 12 o'clock p.m., when the constabulary who had been on duty retired to their barracks and lodginge, as everything was then quiet, the constabulary of the Dlurbam-street station were suddenly roused from their beds, it having been stated that desperate fighting was going on in Sandy-row, the Roman Cattholics of Poundstreet and Cullintree-road having made, it was said, an attack upon the rrotestants of that locality. Sub-Inspector Armstrong, with six mcn, allhecouldhastily muster, marched from the station in Durham-street to go to the scene of the alleged fighting. When they reached the entrance to Sandyrow they found the people to the number of several thousands, male and female, young and old, aU in the street, and armed with bludgeons, implements, and are-arms. Shots were frequently discharged by the people, and, not knowing what might happen Mr Armstrong directed his men to halt, and load with ball cartridge. Eaving done so he then proceeded through the crowded street, and learned that a false alarm had been the cause of the assemblage. The people believed that the Romish mob were coming upon them by a back way through the fields, and they sallied out into the street, armed as I have described, waiting for what might happen. Shortly after a large body of constabulary, with MIr. Hunt, RLM*, at their head, rnade their appearance, and it was not until some hours had elapsed that the poor people conld be assured that they might go into their houses In peace and security. While this proceeding was going on here the Romanists in their district were aiso on the alert, and out in the streets and fields expecting that they were to be attacked by the Prolestants. About 1 o'clock firearms were discharged by both sides in the rear of their dwellings into the respective districts in rapid succession, and this was continued for a long timo, but without any person being shot, so far as is yet known. The constabulary stations which are exposed tothe two parties are considered obnoxious, and a large pane of glass in front of one of the stations was broken during the firing by a Minie ball. The wonder is that some of the police (constabulary), who are often in the way of the bellgerents, have not been shot. You are aware that the Romanists have established a gun club, where the rioters meet nightly and distribute tho prizes-rifles. The place of meeting is in Smitbfield, and last night, about 8 o'clock, the usual meeting was held, and two policemen-Constables Smith and Cunningham-were directed to attend the meeting, bat when they presented themselves they were refused admission without a ticket. Not having a ticket they went away, and reported the matter to the county inspector and the magistrates. So much for the Romanist gun club. '['he party spirit prevails now among the workers in the different mills, and the Romanists, who are most numerous in them, are beating the Protestants whenever they get an opportunity, Already two mills-those of Messrs. Johnston and Carlisle, and Mitchell, Brothers-have been pitted against each other, and many houses on both sides have been partially wrecked. In consequence of this state of things, I learn, on ' authority,' that the millowners are about to hold a meeting to try whether or not a fortnight'e idleness and consequent want of money will not have a good effect in tranquil)izing the parties. From these facts and from what you see in the local newspapers you may form a pretty correct notion of the present state of Belfast. The inflammatory and villanous placard which was distributed in this town on Sanday last, caling upon the Romanists of Dow.n and Antrim to meet and put down street preaching, was printed in the Uts-iman newspaper office. The intelligent and respectable people of all shades of religion and politics denounce this placard in the strongest terms, and there is now no doubt that the recent riots are solely to be attributed to that infamous placard and the Smithfield gun club." Without going further in the narrative it may be as well to lay before the reader a copy of the placard bearing the signature of Mfr. Hanna, and referred to in the foregoing ex;tract: "TO' TIlE rRoTESTABTS OF BELFAST. "Men and Brethren,-Your blood-bought and cherished 'rights' have been imperilled by the audacious and savage outrages of a Ruomish mob. The well-meant but foolish leniency of an easy-natured magistracy, vainly hoping to disarm resentment by conciliation, has hastened and aggravated the present crisis. But you were not to be either bulUed or cajoled out of your rnghts. They are not to be surrendered, and they will be strenuously maintained. That you have unmistakeably shown on the past Sabbath. Then you arose calm but powerful, as the thunder reposing in the cloud. You firmly, temperately, and triumphantly asserted your rigbts. Yon were assailed-savagely assailed. The Ulsftennwm and Whig have belied you. They said you were the aggressors. I tell them, and I tell the world, that they lie. Your enemies were the aggressors, and they are covered with lasting disgrace. " Yonr ministers have a legal right to preach in the open air. No man can honestly deny that. You have also a right to listen to them. Let them choose convenient places for their services. Where you assemble around leave so much of the thoroughfare unoccupied that such as do not choose to listen may pass by. Call that clearance the ' Pope's pad.' No man has any right to interrupt the services. It is an offence against the law to Interrupt an 'oysterman,' and we will insist on the same law for either 'minister' or 'priest.' Fairplay on all sides must be the rule. If any man interrupts the services consign him to the police. If the police be not at hand, do ao violence to the man. Do not allow your feelings to betray you into any unchristian act. Be always governed by reason and religion. Get a suimmons for the man, and the law will teach him propriety and protect you. But never until your lives are imperiUed stir in your own defence. Then, indeed, selfdefence is a duty. You threatened on last Sabbath to dip your aggressors in the dock. You were wrong. The 'ipolice dock' was the right place for them. Keep your present high position. Don't tarnish the laurels of your vlotory. "A few Sabbaths like the last wi2l achieve a prmanent good. I do not mean i2ke the last in rioting, for b=oodshed is a brutal thing. I mean lIse the last in the peaceful, Christian, and mighty assemblage in Corporation-square. Yoa saw your btrength there. You encouraged each other, and when you saw yourselves you wondered at your strength. Many a heart then thanked God, and 'took courage.' You saw that, aided bv the Divinity, it was impossible to wrest from you your cherished rights. Your preachers will do their duty. You will manage to find them out wherever they may appear. No one knows whether you are to have preachiDg, but you may all guess. I cannot speak more plainly. If I did, somebody might go and swear that as somebody was goiog to preach he had reason to apprehend a riot, and our affrighted magistrates might be tempted in their infatuation to prevent it. They know that you are loyal men, obedient to the autborities-that you will obey them for 'conscience' sake,' and because you have a I conscience' Eome of them are disposed to see you robbed of your rights. Some of them wanted somebody to swear such informations against last Sabbath. One of them has wished 'the Lord-Lieutenant would put down open air preaching.' You must therefore be very cautious how you act. But every Protestant man, woman, and child should rally round their preachers, and appear on the right side. " You mnay have difficulty in returning to your places of abode. You may be assaulted individually as you pass to your homes through the Romish districts of the town. But from the 'nettle danger' you I pluck the flower safety.' Not one of you must fail in this eventful crisis. The magistrates must see that the eye and hand of the police are everywhere. Should they fail in their arrangements to protect you their conduct will be put before the Government and the country. But whatever danger confronts you know that this is tte hour for the high display of your moral courage and Christian heroism. Above all, put your truse in God, and fear not what man can do unto yon. " Be kind to your tonsan Catholic neighbours. Tell them, show them, that you want to be at peace. If you have done evil to any of them confems it to them, and ask fog1veness. Don't do an unkind act to tbem, nor suffer an uncbristian word to escape vour lps. [n all Protestant dis4d* of SO twn *Pf A few z blc uixi toglu t hbeir influence In tho maintencnce of peace. Why should there noet he a ' vigilance committee' of Protestant householders to parade the line of confict on the Quadrant-road, and require turbulent people to retire to their homes, or hand them over to the police ? That would check disorder on one side. Peaceloving Roman Catholics might do the other, and thus 20 householders have a better influence than 100 police. When Roman Catholics pass through Protestant districts of the town see that they safely pass. If you should hear of Protestants being waylaid and beaten don"' retaliate. It is cowardly and unwo2thy your Protestant character to imitate what you condemn. Let us maako another strernous effort to restore peace and good-will in Belfast-to differ without breaking eac'n other's heads. The drunken, brawling, abusive, swearing, Sabbath-breaking, profligate, violent Protestant is your weakness and disgrace. Thne peril of your rights is a judgment on your sins. Sanctify yourselves unto the Lord, and rise to a man in the spirit of your fathers-a spirit of invincible loyalty to your principles, and proclaim that the liberty and right of streetpreaching will he mnaintained. " HUGE H.iNXA." The reporter of the FreemanX's ,othunal (the RomnuB Catholic Dublhn organ) writes as follows from Belfalst:a Muartial law, it is true, has not been proclaimed in this quarter, but in almost every street you meet with a constabulary picket, anid at the corners a temporary barracks, while the avenues of communication between the hostile localities-and the line of demarcation between them is strangely well marked-are guarded by strong bodies of police. Notwithstanding aU these precautions outrages are comnitted on both sides, chiebfly after nightfall; houses are attacked and people beaten. As you walk along your ear is frequently saluted with shots fired on various sides, in defiance or in triumph. So accustomed have people apparently become to the state of things I have referred to that I am told, when I inquire on the subject, I the town is quiet,' which expression I now understand to he used in a comparative sense; ' but wait tiU Sunday' is immediately added, and I deeply regret to have to state that the most serious apprehensions are entertained with respect to that day. Alarming rumours ae afloat; and, although they may be and it is to be hoped are without foundation, yet I mention them as showvngthe feeling which prevails where such statements are seriously made and credited by respectable persons. That there will be desperate fighting on Sunday, if the most energetic measures are not taL-en by the autho. ities, is the impression of al whomI have heard speak on the subject. The Catholics, It is said, are detrmied, if again assailed, upon shoug ' what they can do,' and that It will not be sue an affair as last Sunday, where only a few boys from their side were engaged, the men having remained in their homes in deference to the most earnest appeals made to them to do so from the several altars in the town at every mass. The gun clab held a mecting this evening, and for the farst time the police, who usually attend, were refused admission. On the other hand, the Orange lodges, I am informed, are holding their meetings, and to-morrow (Friday) night a public meeting, called by advertieement, will be held to form a Protestant Protective Society. A quantity of arms is said to have been brought to a house at which a lodge meets, and another rumour is that circulars have been sent out, earnestly inviting the brethren of thesuzzounding districts to come In thousands to defend the ' right of openair preaching, which must not be surrendered'-that the 'brethren will respond to the call, and will send, as a letter published in the Belfast Newsletter requires, ' 10,000 Protestant heroes' to assist in this civil war. That some organization is going on appears to me from all I have learned." Referring to the Hanna manifesto, the same writer says,- "1 Not only has Mr. Hanna declared his determination to obstkuct the public thoroughfares, to raise the standard of religious discord, but he has actually accompanied the announcement with statements strongly calculated to leal to the most fearful consequences. He calls on the Protestants to rally round the preachers, and the Orangemen of this town do not require the call. They will assemble. They are preparing for an onslaught, and all expect a sad day's fighting. No respectable clergyman will go out to preach. The Episcopalian clergy have stated they wiU not do so, and the Presbytery have refused to sanction it; but Mfr. Hanna feels he is bound, above all others, to assert the' great principle,' even though In doing so he disturbs the peace of a large town, puts it almost in a stage of siege, excites hatred, and renders it highly probable that lives will be sacrificed, and most assuredly they wiiU if the authorities do not perform their duty with energy. I can state on autho.ity that the Catholic Bishop, the Right Bev. Dr. Denvir, is making every exertion to prevent the assembly of his people in the streets, and to have measures taken to preserve order. A private meeting of the magistrates of the borough was held to-day, and I bave been informed that informations will be sworn to justify them in stopping the street preaching. It has been further communicated to me on the best authority that one of the most extensive millowners in the town, a magistrate, is considering the propriety of dosing his mill for the present, and thus the inno. cent and poor will be made to suffer for the criminal perti- i inacity with which persons by courtesy dubbed 'reverend' insist on preaching the Gospel." Just before post hour an express from Belfast reached Dublin, in which it is announced that a meeting of the civil authorities was held yesterday evening, the result of which was the issuing of a proclamation forbidding all assemblages in the public streets, upon pain of arrest axid prosecution as the law directs. The proclamation, which is signed by the Mayor, was extensively posted thlrough the town, so that Mtr. ifanma's intended demonstrahion must be postponed to some convenient opportunity. REPRESENTATION OF DIUNG AINW'ON. There was a meeting yesterday of the electors of Dungannon for the purpose of considering the address of the Hon. Major Knox in reference to his approaching departure for India. A cordial reply, expressing the approval by the constituency of tlie step taken by the gallant officer, and of unabated confidence in him as their representative, was submitted to the meeting and met with unanimous adoption.

STATB OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, SEPT. 12. There is stil a very limited business for India, and buyers and sellers were alike indisposed to operate this morning, from an expectation that telegraphic advices would soon be to hand which might materially affect the market. There is some business doing In long.oloths for Egypt, but the Greeks are not operatirg to much extent for Constantinople. Fabrics from 91b. to 10kb. weight are difficult of sale, and in some kinds of printers stocks are increasing heavily. For domestics and T-cloths there is a demand, but less active than of late, and buyers are con- tinually induced to hesitate by the advancing rates. The I demand from the home trade, however, is healthy, and vwould lead to a fair business but for these constant changes in value. In yarns the advance in price has gone rather over Tuesday's quotation; and it is evident that until the approaching close of the seasoa the demand for the German and Russias markets will cause sufficieat competition to keep them firm. Water twist for these markets is Id. per lb. over what it was about 12 days ago, an4 some kinds of warps are much as 4Id. higher. BIRMINTGHAAL SEPT. 12. There has been during the present week but little change in the iron trade of South Staffordshire. Moderate orders for best descriptions of manufactured iron continue to be received, but some have been declined, except at a slight advance on last quarter-day's quotations. As Is usual, however, upon the near approach of the preliminary meeting et the trade (which will occur within the next fortnight), few contracts or sales have been rade to any extent, but generally are withheld until present lists are subjected to a revisaL. No doubt is entertained that the prices of the present will be those of the ensuing quarter, although some well-informed members of the trade intimate a not improbable advance. The copper and brass manufactures of the town remain at present uninfluenced by the late advances in the prices of the raw material. The principal foundries are remarkably brisk, both for the home trade and for exortation The great demand for copper and the reluctance ofthe smelters to sell except in small parcels induce the belief that another advance is contemplated; and should this anticipation be reahzed a corresponding rise will of necessity take place in the prices of manufactured articles. This advance, if it can be avoided, is to be deprecated, inasmuch as it vill in all probability lead to a reduction of work in our brass-foundries at a season of the year when it would be most injuriously felt by the operatives. At the present lime most of the establishments of the town are fully employed; the sheathing wire and patent tube businesses being more particularly active. It was feared that the late unfavourable commercial intelligeneo received from the IUnited States would operate unfavourably upon the Birmingham trade with that country. but upon inquiry we learn that the American " panic," of which mention was made In the early part of the week, has not as yet in the slightest degree interfered with the interests of BirminDgham houses; the last advices, in fact, are more favourable and encouraging than any which have come to band for some time past. There is an imnuroved demand for hardware and ironmongery of all descriptions, and the fall trade, which has just set in, it is expected, will be extremely heavy. iThe falling off in the orders for India, to which we alluded 13st week, continues to slacken work In soroe establishments; but generally the chief manufactories of the town are in full work, and have been little affected by the disturbances of the East. The factors speak of the country trade as improving, and b-ate that theironmongers and braziers in most parts of the kingdom are buyingmore freely than at the corresponding period of last year. Several failures, but of little importance, have been Announced in the course of the present week; but, with one exception, none of them afford any criterion by which to judge of the manufacturing condition of the towvn and neighbourhood. The liabilities of Mfeesrs, Fardon and Co., of the Stoke Works, are said to amount to somewbere about 30,0001,, and their assets to between 5,0601. and 6,0001. A jewelry firm (Messrs. Bache) appeared in the G'azete on Tuesday, and an extensive budlder and contractor, reeently engaged on public works, ha8 offered a compromise of 7s. 6d. in the pound to his creditors. None of these affairs will, however, seriouEly affect the general trades of the town, nor are they indicative of their present condition The accounts from the manufacturing districts, if tXhey do notq ;epreselt kuELUnEs to be particularly astiiYev .tat most branches to be seady. The foundries are roderatel well employed, and in somne Instances, where time bad been lost during the hot weather, tho men are at work extra hours. At Brierley-hill wbere boilermaking is carried on to a great extent, businesg is very brisk, and tho locknakers at willenhall are better employed than during the earlier months of the year. The chain and cable manufacturers of Stourbridge are busy, and at Dudley the nail trade is described as looking up. The rivalry of the London and North-Western and Great. Western Bailway companies Is likely for a time at least to benefit the manufacturing interest8 of this town and neighbourhood. Msfr. Bronghton, the goods manager of the North-Western, has -issed a circular to the following effeet: "The Great Westen Company halog determined to make a large reduction In the already very low ratee of carriage betwreen London and Birmingcham, I am instructed, on bebalt of the London sand Itorth-Wotern Railway Company to Informx you that they will be pre. pared to charge You the ratn which the Great Western Company may from time to time be quoting however low tboes rate, b6* and that erry facility and accommo datlon will continue to be gsven to Wu by this company -A heretofore In onnexion with ruch redices rates." A fnrther reduction has also taken place in the charge of conveyance by canal. The Grand Junction Canal Company have announced that from the 8th of this month the rates of all class goods to and from London and Bi-min ham will be 20s. per ton. The rates charged by both ilway companies to London have hitherto been 27s. 6d. per ton, and to Liverpool 20s.; by the Grand Junction Csnal to London 258. 10d. An old competition, which it was expectcd was mutually abandoned, has thus been revived. NOTTINGEHAM, SEPT 12. The lace trade remains in a quiet state, inaost departments being dulL There is an inquiry for brown cotton goods. Plain nets also keep In request at excellent prices. In quillisps there is a fair amount of business doing; still, as the ir~easl busy season of the year is not yet at hand, the dernand for t be several branches named .is not to any great extent. In silk goods naow edgings continue in fair demand. There has been a trifling reduction in the price of silk, but m,anufacturers do not appear sanrnine as to any marked decline at present, and, consequently, great caution in producing goods igstill ex;ercised. InW hosirry there is not much doing; orders are given only to a small extent, and manufacturers will not make goods to keep aS stocks, the present high rates of silk and cotton preventing them. LEICESTER, Sm. 1 The hosiery trade continuesto be in a tolerably active condition, the business doing in most branches being of fully an average amount. Good orders have come in, and manufacturers are engaged in their completion. The high price of both wools and yarns precludes any ereation of stock. Wfools are frm at late prices. There is no change in the price of yarns. LEEDS, Slim. 12 Steadiness prevails In the woollen cloth trade, and a full average amoUnt of business is doiDg considering the seaaon of the year. The shipping houses appear to be the busiest, and some fai- orders have been lately sent off for our North Americ#n colonies and the United States; but the reported failures from the latter will probably ratber check ordersat least for a short time. Some tolerably good German orders are in the course of delivery, and in them are induded some of the best West Riding black cloths; indeed, the Yorkshire clothiers, if they will actively set to work, are quite capable of competing in the manufactare of the finest cloths with the manufacturers in either the West of England, or those of Belgium or Germany. At present there is too great a desire to make cheap goods, and in order to do so much second-hand and other inferior material is used. Incommonlow-pricedgoods,the clotl manufacturers of this district have no equals, and they doubtless subserve a good purposeby theingenuity they bring to bear to render usef ul what would otherwise perhaps be thrown away. But this pronenews to produce cheap fabrics has brought soine stigma upon the general woollen cloth manufacture of the West Riding. Good substantial cloths, however, are made in considerable quantities, and for them there is a constant sale. The attendance in the cloth-halls this morning was to about the usual extent, and the market had a cheerful aspect, No ver large purchases were made, but in the aggregate a fair bulk of cloth was sold. Heavy goods are in nost request, and those of a fancy character command the first attention. Rather an improved demand for Ireland is experienced. Prioes of all kinds of woollen goods are very frm. Wools of all descriptions keep up in price, and the demand is steady. The supply of those for cloth is certainly under rather than above the demand. The quantity to be offered at the ensuing October sales in the metropolis is expected to be within a moderate compass. The quantity already declared is about 16,000 bales. BRA.DFORD, SErP. 12. There is hardly so much animation as last noted in the worsted trade. The piece department is somewhat quieter, for, although in some instances a slight advance is obtained over late quotations, in the generality of cases business in worsted goods has experienced a diminution, as merchants intho home trade manifest a great reluctance to comply with the imperative demands of the manufacturers forhigher rates. The foreign houses do not present any increase of activity. We noticed in our last report that the council of the Chamber of Commerce for the Bradford and Halifax worsted district had appointed a committee specially to inquire into theallged prtial loss of the fine goods trade of the district. Mr. Wlckhai, hLP., has since consented to act as chairman of the committee, which will sit each Tuesday and Friday at the secretary's offices at Bradford - and Mr. J. Darlihgton, the secretary, has publicly invited the attendance of persons engaged in the worsted trade who may be willing to tender either vivd mCe or documentary evidence upon the sabject under consideration. It is intmated that the committee will confine their inquiries to the 10 years previous and the 10 years subsequent to the establishment of free trade in 1846 With respect to this matter the Leeds Mercury of to-day remarks:- 'wIthwilthus be seen that the Inquiry inTolves to someo extent sn fnvestigstion into the operation of our free-tradt polley. The report os the committee will be looked for with much interest by a larg body of mercantile men. Considerable doubt is entertained. however, as to whetber the labors of the conmittee will lead to any practical resut. It is remarked that the French have long made the production of the finer goods their particular business and stucy, that their m chinery is better adapted to ihat branch of trade than our machinery i and that they tbus powsess a superiority over the Yorkshire manufacutrsinregaedtonner fabric,whel inotber depatmentaof the worsted trade the FrenchDroductlous are far iDueri.ir to those of this disrlet, the premelenoeeof which remal intact, asudI isno danger. Astothetncrered demn,ndfor Australianandother wools for the conti. nent, it i said this Is but the natural consequence of the extension or manufacturesthere and whatwastobeexeected Ontheotherhand. It Is mid that if the Inquiry does no good It can do no real harm, and that It wi at all events satiry those who have been auxious that such an Inquiry shoud be instituted, by bringing to light the causes, Or some of the cause, which hari led to the partial lw of the fae trade of the district." The yarn trade is characterized by less business. Spinners of worsted yarns are compelled to firmly demand enhanced rates, witch there is great reluctance shown to pay, but in the contracts entered into an advance apon last week's figures has had to ho acceded to by the manufacturers Cotton yarns are also higher in value. The wool-mqarket is firm, end the tightness of prices causes a less weight of combing wools to change hands, as the spinners are unable to accede to the pretensions of staplers, with their present rate of remuneration on production. Clothing wools contInue firmly to support full rates. HALIEFAX, SEPT. 12. A fair demand for yarns and piece goods has been experienced during the week and to-day, and late p,rices are supported. For wools the demand has rather slckened, oig in some degree to enhanced prices being demanded by holders. DUJBLIN, Sgpv. 12, The heavy weather which has prevailed this week and the large quantity of rain thal fell on several days gave tended to increase the hecaviness which trade has experienced for some time past, and business has been accordingly exceedingly dulL The markets for articles of general consumption are still very high, though most of them have this week experienced a slight decline; nothing, however, which would be felt as a relief by the retail purchaserm. It is probable that the cattle-market wvould be somewhat less firm were it not for the purchases of provision curers, who are putting up beef in antldpation of the navy contract, which is very small one, by the way; but the armaments for India will possibly render it necessary for the Government to contract for further supplies before the season is over. The Customs' receipts for the week to Thursday, 10th of September, inclusive were 15,6291. againts 21,68l. last week.

ExECuTIoN OF CAPT4Ir RoamS -a.- (Abridged from the Zivcrpool Albion) On Saturday, at noon, Henry Rogers, late master of the bark Martha Jane, was executed at KlrkdAle Gaol, Liverpool, for the wilful murder of Andrew Rose, one of the crew, on the high seas. Tho evidence addnoed at the trial before Mr. Baron Watson, on the 19th of August, dslosed these facts, which will be fresh in the minds of our readers The Maxtha Jane is a British bark, owned at Sonderland. in May last, on her homeward voyage from BarboAdoes, the deceased sbhipped in this vessel as an able seaman, Rogers being the captain, with William Miles sad Charles Edward Seymour, first and second mates. From the day he went on board to the day of the vesel's arrival at this port he was subjected to a series of barbarities which have no parallel in the annals of brutality. He was repeatedly beaten with a rope and heavy whip and put in irons; aged with an iron bolt thrast into his mouth and fastened vwit a rope carried round his head; torn by a dog, set upon him by the captain, until blood came; sent up aloft naked, followed by the chief mate with a whip, whih was applied to his bare limbs; had his own excrement forced into his mouth and nostrils; was fatened in a water-cask and rolled about the deck, without any means of getting air except through the bunghole, was kept there without food or water for 24 hours, and waa finally run up to the yardarm, where ha remasined suspended b his neek until he 'as black in the face, his eyes protrude his tongue lobed out, aLnd froth came froL his mouth, and when cat down he feUilfat ashI deadm A day or two after this (June 5) he died. The state he 'ws in at that time was thus described by one of the witnesse --He had wounds aU over his body froma the beatings and crueltiee he had suffered. Hls wounds had festered and he was in guch a state that the crew were loth to touch him. They dred him aft with a roye, and in about an hour afterwards, y order of the captain, he was throwa overboard. The ship made land next morning, and arrived at Liverpool on the 9tbh of June. Information was given of this afr, and the captain and mates were arrested They were all three found gBilty of nmurder and sentenced to death. Great exertions were used by Mr. Snowball, the solicitor for the prisonrs, and m-PhlU -~~Pl0e- ' withx the view of inducing the Home Secetary to spare the grves of the toreo pr2naietr bat until the middle of last week these efforts were unattended with even the least measure of suocess. Early in the week, Mr. inowball, who appears to have felt strongly that there was no evidence to establish the charge of ilful murder, proceeded to London, and on Tuesday obtained an interview with the Home Secretary, before whom he urged all the circumstances most favourable to the prisoners; one point especially dwelt upon being that, although It 'w clearly proved that the deceased's face was black on one side down even to the collar bone, there was not a tittle of testimony in the evidence, even a it stands, that either the captain or mates struck him for several days before death, whereas it had been proved that the cook knooked him against the gangway the very day before he died. " Well,I ws Sir George's reply, "thoee facts were before the jury." Mr. Sno'wbll then still further urged that the seaman Groves, who was one of the most material witnesses on the trl,wa unworthy of belief, basing his argument on the manner in which he had supplemented his onigina evidence These continued efforts were more succeeda than those previousl made, with regard at least to the two mates; for on Wednesday morning Mr. Gibbs, the governor of the county gaol at irk-dale, received a commuzication from the Homeoffice, to the effect that Sir Georgo Grey saw no reason wby the law should not take its usual course with regard to Cagaiu Henry Rogers, but respiting William Miles and Charles Edwvard Seymour, the first and second mates, condemned along with him on the triaL Up to this period the captain and the three mates had occupied the same cell, but It now became necessary to part them, after breaking to them the Intelligence which had been received from the Home-office This painful task was asutned, at the reuest of the governor, by the chaplain of the gaol, th Rev. Richard Appleton, who had been unremitting In hls attentions to them. The mates were quite unmnaned, and wept bitterly, either from excess of joy at their own deliverance from an Ignominous death, or from grief at the approaching fate of their oommander, to whom they were evidently closely attached. Captain Rogers received the intelligence with frmnes, unmnarked by bravado-the firmness of % man who was prepared to die, having made his peae with his Creator. Before the separation they requested that they might be allowed an hour together for prayer, a boon which was granted to them, and they united in devotion for a prolonged period. The mates were then removed to another cell, anda turnkey was placed in constant attendance upon Captain Rogers. The most distressing feature of the case LIes in the fxat that the condemned criminal had a wife and five children, the two elder of whom, a fine lad of 14, and a goodlooking girl of 12 years, have, along with their mother, had several interviews with the unhappy man during the week. The eldest boy, who was present at the trial seemed to feel acutely the dreadful position in which his father stood; but the little girl was unconscious of his apptroaching end, although he told her atthe final meeting, on Fnday, that bhe would never see him again on earth. At that interview the scene was pathetic beyond description, but the poignaney of the gief was subdued by the consolations of religion in which the afflicted wife seemed especially to seek for refrge in her distress. She is a member of the Wesleyan body, and had from time to time urged her husband to lace his trust and hope in the Saviour, and had exhibited some distress of mind from a fear that ho would not direct his thoughts solely to that object. With the intention of subduring these fears, Captain 'Rogers expressed a wish that, before their separation, his wife should be present while the chaplain offered up a prayer, a wish which was not only granted, but she, as we as the two mates, was permitted to parae of the sacrament, when adminijstorod by the chaplain on Friday morning. The scene at parting ass affecting in the extreme, the grief of the two mates being of an intensity little ahort of that displayed by the almost inoonsolate wife, who was so soon, and.under CirCumstances so dreadful, to become a widow. After the mates had been removed the culprit remained in prayer-with his family for some time longer, and at half-past 2 o'clock the final separation took place. Mrs. Rogers was so overcome that she was unable to support hersef, and the chaplain conducted her and the children to a cab 'which was in waiting, and thus the afflicted wife and children 'were driven away. Calcraft, the executioner, arrived on Fridayevening, and slept all night at the gaol. Saturday morning ushered i a clear, sunny day, the brightness and warmth of which presented a remarkable contrast to the wet, cold, and miserable weather of the preceding day. At an early hour the scaffold was projected from the northwestoorner of the gaol, at a point commanding an uninterrupted and extensive view of the Channel and the docks, crowded with their large fleets of merchantmen of all nations. Immediately before the scaffold are several extensive brickdfelds, occupying upwards of 100 acres of land, and stretching, with a gradual fall from the gaol down to the immediate vicinity of the docks. The area of the briokfieldsis terminated, westward, by the embankments of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and a high waU enclosing tho goods' yard attached to the SanhilU -bridgo station. This was a desirable point from which to view the execution at a distance, and the wall and banks vwre covered by men and boys long before the appointed hour, while the intermediate space between them and the gaol was occupied by crowded masses. From the river side increasing streams of seamen, ships' engineers, carpenters, aud artisans engaged about the docks, roUed in towards the place of execution and the thoroughfares from the town were crowded from i to 12 o'clock by wel filed omnibuses, " lorries," " floats," donkey carts, and pedestrians, whose faoes exhibited traces of such joyous expectation as that which might have been expected had they been going to one of the great national sports of former days. Among these were women with children in arms, and many lads, whose shoeless feet, bare heads, scanty clothing, and eneral dirtimess of aprnce, distinguished them as det" ments of that too wel known town corps the " City Arabs." The omnibuses were occupied chiefly by members of the shopkeeping clacs, while the "lorries" and donkey carts were flled with dock porters. basket women, ct hoc genus omne. Thus the crowd continued to increase, until it was computed that not less than 50,000 persons werepresent, a numberwhich has been equalled only once, and that on the occasion of the execution of Gleeson Wilson for the murder of Mrs. Henrichson and her children. This immense concourse of spectators must have the credit paid them of behaving with the greatest decorum. There were no cries of execration by intoxicated seamen-a contingency which it was feared would have arisen- nor did the great pressure cause any unseemly outburst of angry feeling. The street preachers, too, were less obtrnsive than on the occasio of the execution, wben they paraded in front of the scaffodin large force, singing psalms, and with much violent gesticulation, accompanied with high-sounding words, created considerable commotion and annoyance. On Saturday they could not be seen, and only once were heard the sounds of psalm-singing, which rose from the centre of theodense throng in muffled cadence, which speedily died away, and was not again heardL At 12 'clock an awful stillness hung over the great multitude as the procession made its appearance upon the scaffold. First came the culprit, dressed in black, with his neck bared, anid his arms pinioned. He was accompanied by Caleraft. the hangman, a portly man, also dressed in black, and with a gold watch-chain displayed across his breast. They were followed by Mr. Birchall, the deputy-sheriff~ Captain Gibbs, the governor of the gaol, and Mr. Wright, the prison philanthropist, who had arrived on the prenious day, and had that morning spent some time in prayer with the culprit. Captain Rogers came forward with a firm step, paung tor a moment, as if awed by the light of those 50,000 upturned faces-himself the one chief object of attraction. Withdrawing his eyes from the multitude, he glanced towards that sea on which he had spent 25 years of his life, and appeared for a moment to look tenderly towards the tall masts which rose, skyward, from the docks along the margin of the river. Firmly still, but without bravado, he 5tepped forward and placed himself under the drop, where Caleraft adjusted the rope, and prepared to place the cap over the culprit's face. Before this was accomplished Rogers addressed some earnest words to the executioner,who seemaed not to understand him. The chaplain, who had, in the meantime, proceded with the service, came forward,afewwordswereexchanged betweesrhimandthe culprit, who then shook hands with Caloraft, and in a moment more all was over. After the body had remained suspended the usual tine it was cut down, and buried within the precincts of the gaol. The multitude began to disperse immediAtelY the bolt was drawn, and in an hour but few of that vast concourse of people remained in front of the scaffold, which vas speedily removed, leaving no sign of the dismal tragedy which had just been enacted. The Martha Jane, the vessel on which the barbarities that have thus led to the execution of her commander occurred, is a handy bark of about 350 tons, and she is at present, we believe, lying for sale in the Wapping Dock, Liverpool. The sentence upon the two mates, it has been understood, has been commuted to penal servitudefor life.

POLICE. GUILDUkLL,-Mr. ames Welsh, a brass finisher, of 6, Halfmoon-passage, Aldersgate, and Mr. John Harding, of 8, in the sane place, were summoned for creating a disturbance, by causing a number of bells to be rung and other noises to be made every evening, to the annoyance of the inhabitants of Halfmoon-passage. It appeared that there were two houses of ill-fame in this pssage, which caused a most ssiious annoyance to the defendants, and they had tried every means of getting rid of them without effect. At last they had resorted to a system of counter-irritation, and had caused an incessant noise to be mado in their houses, which adjoined those complained of, every evening by ringing bells and knocking tin ettles. The other inhabitants of the passage, however, objected to this proceeding, and now applied to the mnE. irate to put a stop to it. Inspector Cole proved the e.xistence of the noises, and stated a]so his belief that there were two houses in the passage which had been devoted to Imuproper purposes for 40 years. Mtr. Welsh said that his private door opened into Halfnoon-passage, and his wife was continually annoyed by persons mistaking the door, and when she re;used to direct them to the house they required she was subjected to the grossest abuse. He held three houses up the passage, which were tenanted by poor, but honest and moral people, and they were also continually annoyed in a similar mauner, in the hot weather particularly, when they left their doors open to admit the cool air ; they often found persons in different bedrooms of their houses. He bad obtained legal proof of the houses being places of ill fame, and had appIed to the parish to prosecute them, but the request had zaways been refused. Mr. Martin said that the parish could be compeLled to prosecute at tAhe request of any two parishioners. Mr. Welsh said that unfortunately the court was in two different parishes. He had no voice in the parish in which the houses complained of were situated. Mr. Harding said that he once commenced legal proceedings against one of these houses, when he was surrounded b a number of women, who threatened him with personal nolence and broke his windows. Sir P. LAURIE said they must proceed legally against the houses, and not annoy the other inhabitants by the noises spoken of. The defendants promised to desist, and they were bound over in their own recognizaness to keep the peace. BOW-STREET.-Mr. Henry Smart, of Tlchborne-street, Covent. -street, and Mr. Thomas Clo s, of Charlotte-street, Blackfriars, I )th picture-dealers, were summoned before Mr. JARI)i5'5E for conspiring to defraud Mr. Henry Fitzpatr-k, carver and gilder of Sheffield, by obtaining 1201. from him under false pretences. Mr. Metcalfe (instructed by Mr. G. DiUon Webb, of Carey-street) conducted the prosecution; Mr. S. B. Abra. harns, of Bloomsbury-sqaare. attended for Mr. Smart, and Mr. Austen for the other defendant. From the statement of the learned counsel it appeared that Mr. Fitzpatrick, the complainant, called at the shop of MIr. Stnarc about the 20th or 21st of July last, and expressed a wish to purchase one of Linnell's pictures, A small landscape piece was shown him by Mr. Smart, who asked 2001. for it, but the parchase was declined. What followed will best appear from the evidence: - Frederick W. Adams, of J, King-street, Covent-garden, picture-frameiuaker, said,-On the 24th of July the defendant Closs, who is a customer of mine, came to me and stated that he had a picture of Linncll's for sale. I said, "Is it the picture that Mr. Fitzpatrick has seen at Smart's7" and he replied, " Yes, it is." le then told me that he did not want his name to be mentioned in the matter, but wished me to tell Mr. Fitzpatrick that a gentleman had brought it to me for sale. 1 said, "Is there anything wrong In it, because if the picture is oaly a copy I would not do such a thing for 501., Mr. Fitzpatrick being a customer of mine !" Hie assured me that it was an original and directed me to say that the owner of it, being pressed for money, wished to sell it, bht could not allow his name to be kuown. The picture was sent round to my shop after. wards in a frarne and case. I showed it to Mr. Fitzpatrick, and told him that I was not at liberty to reveal the name of the owner, as the gentlewan wanted money very badly; but if he wished to satisfy himself that it was a genuine pictre he was to show it to Mr. Smart. Closs told me to say this, I did not consider myself a sufticient judge, but, relying on what Close had said, I expressed my belief to Mr. Fitzpatrick that it was all right. There was some conversation about the price, and I went to Closs, by a pointment, In Green-etreet, Leicester-square Close said te would take 1201. for it, although he shoulid lose 401. by the picture. I returned to Mr. Fitzpatriok, aud he ultimately agreed to give me 1301. for it, if it was genuine. He took away the picture to show it to Mr. Smart. He asked me if the entleman would give him a warranty? I replied that e could not, because lie did not wish his name to appear, but that I did not believe the gentleman would deceive me. Utpon this he agreed to purchase it, and he handed me the anmount in a 251. check, a biU for 151. at two months, another of 401. at three months, and a third for 501. at four month~. Cross-examined.-I gave the chek and acceptances to Closs, except the I.W. bill, whioh I retained for my own comamission. I did not tell Class that I had received 1301. nor did I tell Mr. Fitzpatrick that I bought the picture fo1 r 1201. Air. Closs agreed to sell it for 1201., and Mr. Fitz. patrick agreed to buy it for 1301. I took the 101. for my trouble in negotiating the matter. Mr. .JTADIN :.-That sounds very much like a fraud to me. You deceived both parties. Witness.-It is the practice in the trade, and I have got as much as 101. upon a picture of 101. value. I should wish to call witnesses to prove this; although, as the matter has turned out, I am quite prepared to give back the acceptance to Mr. Fitzpatrick. Mfr. Henry Fitzpatrick, after giving some evidence in coafirmation of the foregoing, said-Wlhen I first called at Mr. Smart's, and he showed me Linnell's picture, I saw a man in the shop who I now believe was Air. Closs. He was a stranger to me, but resembled the defendant. I asked Smart if he would allow me to take the pieture to Sheffield, to shov to a gentleman, stating that I would haid hini the 2001. if the purcbase was effected. He answered, " I have sold it, I believe, but I'll see about it." I think it was the next day after this that I met Mr. Adams in Fleetestreet, and he told 3ne he had got UinDell's picture at hisshop. I went there nnd saw the copy now produced, but In the same frame and boxthat Ihad seen at Smart's. I feel confident of this, although I couldn't swear to it positively. I was of opinion that the DiCture mustbethesameas I hadsoenat Smart's, becauseithano appearance of boing freshly Painted. After I had purchased it of Adams I took it to Mhr. Smart; I placed it in a good light, and I asked him if that was the picture I had seen in his house ? He replied " Yes, there can be no doubt about it." He said " How did you become possessed of it so soon?" I said it had been left at a shop for me to see, although I could not tell why the owner refused to come forward. Smart add " iPerhaps he wanlts to raise the wind ?" I then asked Smart if he would give me a letter of wArranty, saying that the picture was one he bought of John Linnell, of RedhilL IIe replied, " Y ou did not buy the picture of me, but I will give a warranty to the gentleman I sold it to." Mr6. Sfmarit had previously told me that he gave Linnell Mr. Metcalfe.-I suppose you don't consider the copy worth 1.51. ? WVitness.-I would not give 51. for it. Mr. Metcalfe.-Don't hurt the feelings of the gentleman who painted it. (A laugh.) Mr. Abrahams.-Did not Mr. Smart say that the picture was very like the original ? Wfitness.-No, Sir. He raid there was no doubt that it was the original. 1 have since sold the copy for 1501., but I inormd te prchaer iretlyI hd discovered the fraud. I have nlot been parid.I dliYd not have any receipt or invoice from Adams, being insa great hurry to save my The two pictures were here exhibited in court, and were regarded with mnuch interest by the cr-owd of artists whn) were present. The copy was considered exceedingly skdlful Mr. John Linnell, the painter, was theniexamined.- After making a doss surveY ofth original he expressedlhis belief that it was the one he painted for Mr. Smart, who gave him 17-51. for ft in Februiary last. He had been'asked to pa-int it " as an old acquaintance," having known Smaart's family for 50 years. After looking at the copy, he said he should know that it was not his painting upside down; but the colouring had been well imnitated, and it miight de'ceive an inexgerienced eye. The signature to it was a forgery He had never known anything against Smart's character. Mr. J. Lloyd, of Gracechurch-street, proved that he pur. chased the "original" of Closs, who told him that he bought it of Smart, He had since re-sold it to a gentleman, who bad sold It again. ~ ~ ~ th in The present owner of the picture being absent, the in. opinion upon. the case at prese.nt.

It is a bas-relief at Augsburg, repreientisg the stowing away in oellars of the newly-made wine. It has been en. graved by Mr. Rich in his "Iliustrated Companion to the Latin Dictionary and Greek Lexicon," page 141, in explanation of the cela zinasra. Wishing for a sketch from the stone itself, I asked my friend Mr. Fairholt, now at Augsburg, to procure one. 1 have just received his reply:- " On asking after the bas-relief of the men stowing away wine the keeper of the museum told me its curious history. He says it is m the wall of a cellar under the town-hall, pro. bably a wine-oallar used by the Romans; but some years ago alterations were made there which subdivided the place, the walls were strengthened, and this bas-relief was abso. lutely built up in the new walL The keeper took much in. terest in findiDg this out, and he was also anxious to know the exact spot in which the monument was immured. After much 'rouble he was given the name of an old mason who had helped tobuild it in-this was four years ago, vwhen the cholera was raging here-and on going to the mason's house he found the poor old man lying dead; and now he believes no one knows the spot."
