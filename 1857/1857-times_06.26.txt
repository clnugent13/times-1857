SUTVEY OF SCOTLAND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Trom the letter of Lord iElcho In 1;w Times of to-day it would appear that his Lordship is not satisfied with the decision to which the House of Commons has already arrived regarding the scale of the Ordnance survey of Scotland, ard he leads one to infer that the subject is to be again brought forward for puble discussion. Isee no object tion to the course whlch thonoble Lord proposes for justifying the course he has pursued in promoting the establishment of the large scale; but, in criticizing the conduct of those who do not agree with him, I think he should be carefully accurate in h is statements of fact, ande more particularly so when he charges with inconsistency other members equally interested with himself in giving to the publi0 all the advantages of a map at the smallest cost to tbe country. I have not come to the conclusion, nor has, I believe, my I friend Mr. R. Stephenson, "that a six-inch map is a judicious outlay of public money a" nd Lord Elcho is not justi. fied in that assumption, for that was not the motion sub. mitted to the House when the large scale plan was con-, demned. The quotation which his Lordship makes from the opinions of Mr. Stephenson, Mr. Brunel, and myself shows that for certain sped(ied objgcts, a larger scale would be desirable, and he considers this opinion to be inconsistent with the vote given by Mr. Stephenson and myself on the subject of these scales; but it his Lordship had done us the simple justice to continue his quotation he would have found immediately in connexion with it that-- is As regards engraving and publication we do not see any sufficient reason for the Government incurring any expense beyond that involved in the one-inch map. A facility for making extracts from such maps is what the public would require, but any further expense ought to be borne by the parties requiring the accommodation." This, notwithstanding all that Lord Elcho has stated about France, Is all that is done in that country. The larg, scale cadastral maps used for registrations and transfer are neither engraved nor published, and all that the Government has done isto publish a map on a scale less than one inch to the mile. And now, Sir, what is to be done amid the diffiqulty and confusion created by tho promoters of this largo scale? The decision of the committee of 1851, of which Lord Elcho was chairman, did (as he says) unanimously reject the large scale, and urged the speedy completion of the one-inch map and hadit not been for the agitation of those persons whose opinions were not adopted by that committee the whole of Scotland would by this time have been completed. But we sEem to have gone on from one awale to another, leaving large discretionary powers in the hands of the Ordnance Department to use one scale in one district and a larger one in another-to adorn the map with certain imaginary lines called contours, until Parliament hs been indutced, nay, almost forced, to interfere. and place some limit to this confusion and extravagance. My sole object, however, is to make the best of the position, and not rigidly to adhere to the decision of 1851, if it cam be shown that there would be any advantage ia departing from it. But Lord Eloho and his friends must show more clearly than they have yet done in what way the public is benefited by funishing these large scale plans to persons desirous of improving their eatates or otherwise employing them for their own individual purposes; and let it not be forgotten that these large plans would reqaire a large staff of officials for the purpose of revision (probably every year), and thus the great expense to which many persons now object would be porpetuated. One word as to contouring, en which Lord B3clho is silent. In his report of 1851 the cost is stated at 120,0001. for Scot!and alone, and the committee unanimously recommended It to be abandoned. las his Lordship chanced his opinions on contouring, or is he disposed now to give effect to his own renort? Apologizing for the length of this reply, I am, Sir, Your obedient servant. JOSE PH LOCKE. June 25. TO TRE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In an elaborate letter, published in The Times of this day, on the subject of the survey of Scotland Lor Elcho has done me the honour to allude to me both by nana and as President of the Royal Geographical Society. His Lordship has correctly quoted my reply to a Treasury circular, in which my opinion was asked as to whether a scale 6 or 24 inches was the best for certain purposes ? lNow, tho reasons I aseign,ed for preferring the larger scale had reference exclusively to plans of estates in which each acre was to be accurately noted for tithe and parochial sssessment, as well as for the enclosure of lands, and for the conveyanee and transferbnce of property. Adopting the views of public men of great weight on such subjects, I uniformly expressed my conviction, that such large plans or cadadstres did not properly come within the ECope of physical geographers or geologists. My opinion as above stated having been cited, as if I were in favour of the publication of maps on the 25-inch scale, I beg to state that during the last 23 years I have been known to be the warm advocate of a map upon the 1-inch scale. Seeing in 1834 that my native highlands of Scotland were then worse mapped than any civilized country; that Cape Wrath and other headlands were out of position by many miles; I induced the British Association for the Ad. vancement of Science to appeal to the Government upon the subject of this great national want. Heading a deputation to the Government of that day, I contended that Scotland was entitled to be furnished with the same 1- inch map which England and Wales were obtaining. Subsequently Ireland wvas surveyed, and her map published upon a 6-inch scale, that being considered the smallest measure upon which her disputed townland boundaries could be accurately laid down. The 1-inch, or generally useful map, is now in course of redactionfrom the larger scale. For a long time I remained unconvinced of the rea practical value of any scale larger than that of the 1-inch, but when I became the director of the geological survey I foundl that in Ireland, where the 6-inch scale with con. tours had been used, the geological surveyors could delineate every outcrop, bend, and break of the strata, and that where this 6 inch scale had been appled in Scotland it was of high value to miningproprietors. I therefore stated in my evidence before a committee of the HouseofCommons duringthe.lastsessionthat I hal modified my original opinion, and believed that a 6-inch survey, co-ordinately with the 1-inch map, was desirable. and particularly in rich mineral districts. At the same time I expressed my conviction that it would be useless and wasteful to publish any map of the 10,000,000 or 11,000,000 of acres of wild lands of the Highlmids on any scale larger than that of 1-inch. I remain. Sir. vour very obedient servant. RODERICK L MURcOlmoh. Royal Geographical Society, June 25.

BLEcrIOz( CO3IfJ!T2ERR& MAYO (COU1NT). Tbi eomnmittee mot at 12 o'elok la room No. 16, Its members are Mr. Scholefdeld, chairman; Sl John Ham. mer, Colonel North, Mtr. Puller, and Mr. George Tomlin. The ooansel for the petitioner are Mr. E JTme, Mr. O'Maltey, and Mr. W, P. Hale, instracted by Mesr Holmes, Anton, andgaTrnbull, Parliamentary agents. The counsel for the eitting member ae Mr. X. Smith, Mr. J. R. Karlake, and Mr. Bobert Cannon, of the Irish bar, instructed by Mr. Theodore Mrtin, Parliamentary agent, The usl resolutions as to the order of proceeding having leenannounoed by tho Cn R, The CLERK (Mlr. Dew) read the petition of Lieutenant. Colonel Gore Ouseley Higgins. It stated that at the election in April last Mr. George Henry Moore, Mr. Roger Palmer, and the petitioner, being candidate" for the representation of the county, the poU was declared on the 8th of April, with the following result:-Palmer 1,225, G0. E. -Moore 1,160, Higgins 1,037; that the majority obtained by the t,aid G. L. Moore was obtained by violent, illegal, unoonetitutiond, fraudulent, and outrageous means, and thst the return of the saidG. H. Moore ought therefore to be declared null and void. The petiUon then proceeded to state at length the facts upon which Colonel Higgins reled in support of the prayer of the petition, which was that the name of the petitsoner should be substituted in the return for that of the said G. H. Moore- Mr. B. JAMM opened the case on behalf of the petitioner, amd stated that it was the most important eection petition which In the course of his experience had ever been brought before a committee, involving as it did no less a question than that of the freedom of election. Those who had pre sented the petition-and they had not ventured to do it without great deliberation and caution-were not so nuch prosecuting a nero election petition u preferring a series of ch rges of high crimes and misdemeanours against a large body of relates of the Irish church; and he should therefore deal with those charges ns he should do if this were a crnninal p rosecution, and state nothing hut what vras capable of; positive proof. Parliament had framed a series of resoluons, extending as far back as the time of Ed. ward L, declaring the princdple of freedom of election-a princple which he should prove had been vioLated in this mnstance. he had to make a charge of organized conspiracy against certain priests belonging to the county of Mayo, of whom Dr. acHlale, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of' Tuam, was at the head, entered into in order to provent by violence and intimidation a number of vote= from voting for Colonel Higgins, to compel them to vote in favour of Mr. Moore, and to prevent Colonel Higgins from exercising the falr influence to which he was properly entitled over the conedituncy. In order to carry out this conspiracy voters had been taken to the houses of priests and sworn on the Bible to vote for Mr. Moore; and every kind of influence had been brought to bear upon the uneducated Irish peasantry. The validity of the election was therefore im. pugned on the ground that the section of the Corrupt i?ractices' Prevention Act which forbade the exercise of undue influence had been violated. Colonel Higgins was a Roman Catholic gentleman connected by his family with the couty and supported by a large body of the resident gentry. He had givenoffencetoDr.oHlsleandthelonanCatholic priests in consequence of not-having adopted Ulltramontane views, and of the course he had taken 1n reference to the Eccleiastical Titles Bill and the Tenant Right agitation. Wr. G. H. Moore was the scoond, and Captain Palmer was the third candidate, but he would acquit that gentleman of any intentional desin to profit by the machinery of intimidation, although he hdprobably, in fact, profited by it. A combination was, for seine reason or other, effected between Mr. Moore andCaptain Palmer, and they were supported by theprineets. It would be necessary to explaia that the county of 3ayo had a constituency of about 2,600, that it was divided into nine baronies, and that it had six polling places. The writ was issued on the 21st of March ; it arrived mn Ireland on hfonday, the 23d; the nomination was fixed for Friday, the 3d of Anpril, and the polling for Monday and Tuesday, the 6th and 7th. On the 23d of March a meeting of Roman Catholic clergy took place at Castlebar, the county town, at which resolutions were agreed to, pledging the Roman Catholic church to support Mr. Moore, and a placard was issued calling upon the people to obey the voice of the chlurch, and to doi their duty by electing Ur. Moor6 and Mr. Palmer. The placard also published the resolutions rgreed to at the meeting, and signeA byArchbishop MacHale and three other bishops. The OH An. Yu are now using the expression "Archbishop MacEale." I must remind you that it is an t-xpresdon which cannot be recognized by the committee. JAUM said he was only stating the title which Dr MacHle gave to himself. Perhaps he would be able to explain his reasons for taking that title when he came before the committee. No doubt he would have the honour of speakingto the doctor presently. (A laugh.) Mr. M. SarrTi objected to the placard being read before it was proved to be in some way connected with the sitting memer or his agents. Mr. JTtEs thought it would be sufficient if he proved that it had been published with the signatures of theRoman Catholic bishops and not disavowed. The learned counsel then proceeded with his statement. Sir R. O'Donnell 'and Colonel Higgins had for some weeks carried on a successful canvass, but when this placard and these resolutionswere published a great alteration took place. At Ballinrobe two priests, at the head of an excited mob, kept Colonel 1igginsprisoner for two days, in fear of his life. Sir R. O'Donnsll would tell them the excitement that prevailed and the danger in which Colonel Higgins was placed. On the 30th of March a priest named Peter Conway (he be. lieved chaplain to Dr. MacHale), who was constantly in Mr. Moore's company, and who canvassed with him, appeared uyon the scene, together with two other priests. The nomina. tion took place on the 3d of Ajril at Castlebar, and in consequence of the excitement of the Castlebar population riots were anticipated, and three companies of the 38th Regiment were sent to the town; and a police force was organized. At the nomination such was the excitement that Peter Conway was requested to calm the people, and the result wasthat itpassedoffwithoutaccident. On the Saturday night. and Sunday morning it became necessary to bring Colonel Higgnss voters for protection to an hotel in Ballinrobe, where there was a large military force. Conway, under pretence of taking tho voters to mass, endea. voured to get at them, but was unsuccessfuL He became very violent and a magistrate was sent for, who interfered and sent away the mob who accompanied Conway. Ball'. robe contained 6,000 or 7,000 inhabitants, and Conway'f chapel was the only one there. On the Sunday in quesUon Conway denounced Colonel Higgins from the altar dunng the celebration of mass. At Killala, where Luke Byrne was the priest, and at Bollols, where James Balloran was tho priest, Colonel Higgins was also de nounced from the altar, and H1alloran stated that he was acting by direction of the Rev. Dr. MacHale and the Roman Catholic bishops. At Kilcommon, where Mr. Joyce was the Catholic priest, the same scene occurred. Ballinrohe was, of course, in the most excited state, and Conway addressed the mob in the afternoon out of Mr. Moore's committee-room, ind said he wanted 100 men 'a his gate immediately, and 100 more in half an hour, to meet the voters of Colonel Higgins. At the head of this mob he proceeded to a neighbouring village, called Neale, below v hicb, at Lough Corrib, lived Colonel Higgins, as he expected that the voters would come in that direction. They met a respectable gentleman, 75 years old, who was intimiu dated and cruelly beaten because he was one of Colonel Higgins! voters. Provender for the horses which had taken the voters to Ballinrobe bad also to be sent into the town urnder charge of Colonel Higgins's servant. He met the mob, nd, at the instigation of Conway, they scattered the provender, cut the horses loose, and illused the man. Eight or nine voters were met, accom- anied by an escort of cavalry. Conway gave orders Sor their attack, and such was the excitement of tho mob that the voters ran away and the cavalry were of no use. Two of the voters were caught, and Conway having ascertained that they were voters swore them upon some book purporting to be the Bible not to vote for Colonel ggins. The rest of the men who were capturod were taken aS prisoners to an hotel at Soon, and Conway there canvassed them on the same evening. He told them the) must either vote for Mooro and Palmer, or else split their votes for Moore. Conway never left these voters, but the Eame night took them to Moore and Palmer's committeerooms, and conveyed them to the poll on the Monday. They were too late for the poll, and he locked them u in hi' own house during the Monday night, and on the follovAng morning took them to the poll and made them vote for Mr. Moore. A numberof voters in charge of a strong escort of cavalry weregoingzto Ballinrobe through Clanmorris, be tween 9 andl1 o'clock on the same Sunday. The mob rushed out of the chapel, where one Reynolds, parish priest, was performing mass, and with Reynolds at their head at. tacked the cavalry and nearly killed one man. Reynolds believing that hehd beenakilled, announced his death to the ple, saying that it was the will of God. On the road to nrobe from Clrnmorris the same voters met an enormous mob with Conway at their bead, and Conway iD Irish gave his curse and the curse of the church and of God to all who should vote for Colonel Higgins. A gentleman 'who 'was with the voters, however. went up with a pistol to Conway, and said that if he did not leave off exciting the mob he would shoot him, and Conway, who was probably, judging from his actions, a coward, then desisted, and the voters at last arrived at Ballinrobe. About half-past 8 on the same Sunday Colonel Higgins was going to Ballinrobe with his servant and postilion, when he saw a large and infuriated mob, with Conway at their head on horseback. Conway called out, "Is that Ouseley Higgins? Yes, boys, it is." The postilions endeavoured to drive on, and Conway called out, " At him, boys," and Colonel Higgins was obliged to take refuge in the house of a friend, where he was oblieed to remain the whole day. He did not dare to show himself outside the door. Between tbree and 4 in the morning the windows of Colonel Higns's supporters in Ballinrobe were broken by *he mob, and at other places similar occurrences took place, lways at the instigation of the priests. On the Monday be polling went on from 8 till 4. On the Tuesday the Xxcitement and terror increased. The Riot Act was frec.uently read, and ultimately the returning officer, at 2 'Celook, was obliged to adjonrnthe Poll tilthenext morning, The priests wereactually leading mobs and preventing Colonel Higgins's voters from getting to the polL Afterthe adjournmnent of the poll the magistrates thougbt it was time to vindicate the majesty of the law, and it was que3tioned whether Father Conway ought mot to be arrested; but suoh was the state of the town that they had not military enough to cirry their purpose into effect. Father Conway heard that a large force had been sent for, and went home and published this placard :' ' t homo and My very dear Fiends,- X never asked a Uvour of yoU that Ion did not grant at once.

The learnd counsel then weent on to mention instances In which Mr. 3Mooro and his agents had promised to reimburse voters their expenses and to treat them, and ha held out other indaew ments of a similar zature la induoe them to vote for him. Trating bills, originally made out to Moore aud Palmer, had been altered to Mr. Palmer alone in the hope that they would not be allowed to be given in evideno before that tribunal. In addition to the facts he had stated he under. took to prove that if it had not been for the system of in. tiidation carried on dving the whole time of the elec tion, Colonel igggins' wotad have had a clear majority. Mr. Moore Wasa mere puppet and tool in the hands of the priests, and if they owu un ted 3Mr. Moore and sent down a writ for another electon, it was a mere mockery and delusion in the present state of the county to mfappoethat it oould be properly executed.

Mr. G. H. Moore, who had been present during the learned cousel's address, said a1S its close, that if he had interrapted it, such interruption was entirely unintentional on his part. Mr. JAsEs said he wasnot aware that the kon. gentleman had interrapted him. A short disuesion then took place between the learned counsel as to the order in. which the evidenco should be brought forward, and the writ and the return of the election were formall proved.

The district war very much excited after the plard was published. On the.polling.dbr a large number of military were brought into the town. On the Saturday I had gone to Clanmorris with a troop of dragoons, in order to meet a number of Colenel Higginses voters thero on the following morning. Some gentleamen sent on the Sunday to know whether the militay had arrived, in order to protect theIr tesantry. At l0 o'clock on the Snrday morn. rng the voters arrived near the hobtL Some of the voters who came on horseback were anxious to go on while the people were at mass, und vait for the escort outside the. town. About 40 went off, and I followed with the remain der as fast as possible. I collected upwards of IO voters by ll on Sunday morwng. As we passed close to the chapel where Mr. Reynolds was preaching the people came out in a state of great excitement, and threw volleys of stones at us. One man, Peter Cummins, got a blow on the head, and we thought he was killed. The voters, who were in a van, became frightened and wanted to get out and run away, -but I made them stoop down, where they were safe. The escort remained a little behind and provented some of the mob from getting at us. The mob consisted of 300 or 400 people. We at last got out of the town, and formed into a body for the purpose of procoedlngto our destination. We goton to within two miles of Ballinrobe, which is abeut'22.English miles from Clan. morris, when we heard that the town was in a state of great excitement, and'we sent for a further escort, and 25 infsntry were sent out in addition to the 25 cavalry which bad accompanied us. We then proceeded towards Ballin. robe. We passed near a lane or road about 20 feet wide, where we met a mob of people. I stationed a few police which had come out with the infantry at the foot-of the line and took the cavilry to the head of the lane. There was a bigh wall on one side of the lare, on whiEch I observed a number of people, Father Conway among them. Father Conway spoke to them in Irish, and I understand enough of that language to know what he said. Mr. M. Sarin submiStedthat the-words ought to be given in the language in which they wero uttired. The Committce, after deliberating for a short time with closed doors, overraled the objection to tho admission of the evidence. Witness.-The words were, "My curs as a priestk and that of the church, and of thepeol be upon yon seven tii us if you vote for Colonel Higgins." The words were aadressed in a solemn manner, Conway being on his knees to the voters. From the space enclosed by the Wall there then issued a number of violent men, who seized the horses by thgir heads and prevented them from proceeding untU I drove them away. They then commenced fingring stores from the wall, where the prlest stfll remained. Mr. Burke, a magistrate, said, "If any-man throws a stone at me, lwill shoot him,"pointing to Conway; and Conway then disappeared.

I was a member of the colonePs comimittee. I forget wvhether Captain Brabazon. was onl the committee. HMs son was CaptaPin Brabazon was a sup- porter and a relation of Colonel Higgins. I was an actire partisan of Colonel Higgins. I do not think that Bishop Ourkin was present at the nomination, On the day of somination there was a great deal more than the ordinary exoitemen. of an Irish election. At every contested election 4hat I have sEen in Mayo military have been brought into the town; but they have nob been "c alled out." At the Galway election, too, the military are often present. On being exauiined with regaid to the expressions used by Conway in Irish, the witness said he could not speak that language, but he had no doubt as to the words used by the priest. On being pressed for the %rords, he mentioned one or two in the Irish language. With regard to the attack upon the cavalry, he said he had told the men to draw their swords when it took place, but he did not hear the officer in command tell the men to put their swords back into their scabbards. When everything was over they did put up their swords. Mr. Burke was the seconder of Colonel Higgins, and when he made his speech he wished a long and happy life to Archbishop 3WHale. On re-examination, the witness said there was always a difficulty in gettig gentlemen to act as deputy-sheriffs. Mr. Mooze's voters dd not require the least protection. The violence of the mnob was directed entirely against Colonel Higgins's voters. At the conclusion of this witness's examination the committee adjourned until 11 o'clock this day. CABRIDGE3 (BOROUGH) The committee, consistin of 'Mr. Deasy, chairmn, the Marqumis of Blandford, Mr. Es. Lockhart., Viscount Melgund, and M Wyvill, met at 11 o'clock in room No. 17. The usual risolutions with regard to the exclusion of witnesses and the mode of proceeding, having beo n agreed to, the petition was zead by the clerk of the committee. It was signed by Mr. R. A. Shafto Adair, and after htating the number of votes poled at the lath election, charged-the sitting member, Mr. Andrew Steuart, with bribery and corruption, either by himself or through his agente, and prayed that his return sbould be annulled, and tt the petitiner should be declared duly elected. adttth MIr.

In the first place, therefore, e should have to prove that the sitting mqember had beefn guilty of bribery. The borough of Cambrilgehad for many yearsbeensubjectedto contested elections, andaommission which had been appointed to inquire into the practicm whichi prevailed in the borough had ascertained that corrupt practices were cearried on at every election.

There were two counts in the delaration in that case -one charging the defendant wvith the payment of travelling expensea for the purpose of inducing a favourable vote, and the other charging him wFith having paid those expenses on account of a vote. The case was argued in the Baschequer Chamber, and judgment was delivered by MEr. Baron Parke. that the judgment referred t6 by his learned. friend hadnot been affirmed. Mr. POWvER said it had not been reversed, and be would prove that Mr. Steuart had sanctioned the payment of travelling expense, and had, therefore, according to that decision been guilty of bribery.

APPELBS. IIOUSE OF LORDS. JuiEn 25. Ds9tliWRrY A1qD OT'RS V. M3'DOWLL AMD OT=RS. Their Lordships sat this morning to resume the hegringof the arguments In this case, the Lord Chancelior, Lord Bmcnglasn, Lord St. Leonards, Lord Wensleydale, andother peers being present. Sir F. Kelly, with Mr. James A. Lawson, appeared for the appellants; the Attornoy-Generl, Mr. R. Palcmer, and Mr. Deasy for the respondent E'Dowell, the official manager of the Tipperary Bank; Mr. Vance and Mr. Napier for th3 respondent Stirling, and Mr. Rolt, Mr. Cairn; aud Mr. Exhsn for the respondent Hone. This was an appeal from a decision of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and, although the question before the H:ouse Was a short one, yet it is of great importance ta joint-stook banks. The hieEf point at issue was whether tho shareholders in the Tipperary Bank were bankers within the meaning of the 33d of George IL, cap. 14, or whether the provisions of the 6th of George IV., cap. 42, under whioh the bank was established, repealed or rendered inapplicable to jont-stoek banks the stringent provisions of the former Act with relation to the property of the shareholders. By the 8th section of the 33d of George IL, cap. 14, it was enacted,- 11That fromn and ImmedIatey after the time that any baniker isball abscond. conceal himself from his czeditr, etop ament, or die, cal the real estates, whetber for live in fee simple or fee tail, and all the perzonal estates, credits, and effects whatsover, either at law or equ ty, of wbich euch banker oba1l be seized, posseed of, or entitted unto ait tLe time of tSI death or stopping paymenS, or absconding or cunenine imslf romhiscreitos, hal beliable and subject to the payentof li nd ver hi dets f wat ature or kiud soever the asher sha contract bet are he became a tankeer sand except such debt are aambancs a shal h semedby eed or conveysacis registered according to th'e provisions of this wet ," It Rppt ared that the Tipperary Joint-Stock Bank was pro. jected in the year 1838, and that by a deed dated the 5th tf July, 1842, it was agreed that it sbould be regulated and carried on under the provisions of the6th of Geore IV., cap. 42. The noninal capital of the bank was 5000001. hut only 50,0001. was subscribed by the various persons who joined the co-partnership. Discount and deposit business was carried on under the management of a court of directors, including James Sadleir, James Scully, and Wilson Kennedy, from July, 1842, until the 20th of February, 1856, when the bank stopped payment. At the time of the stoppage the bank was indebted to upwards of 8,000 creditors in the sum of 430,0001., and its entire available assets did nct exceed 50,001. At the instance of a shareholder in the bank namedRafferty proceedings were instituted on the 21st of February, 1856, m the Court of Chancery in Ireland, under the Joint Stock Companies Winding-up Acts, and onithe4th of March, 1856, he obtained an order from the Master of the Polls that the company should be dissolved and that the matter should he referred to the Master for the purpose of the winding-up of the affairs of the bank being effected. On ,the 17th of March the respondent, George M'Dowell, was appointed official manager oi the affairs of the partnership, and on the 23d of March a return was made by one of the managers of the bank upon eath under the provisions of the 6th of George IV., stating the namues of 34 persons as partners ol the society. The official mansger paid a dividend of 2s. in the pound upon the 17th oft June, 1856, of which the appellants who were creditors of the bank at the time of ts stoppage have received the benefit. On the 11th of June previous to the dividend being paid the appellants filed a petition on behalf of themselves respectively, anda'so on behalf of all the other creditors of the copartnership who should contribute towards theexpenses of the suit, against the respondent George MXDowell, asofficialmanager, and against the Attorney-General for Ireland, praying that it might be ordered and declared that the trusts created urder the 8th section of the 33d of George IL, cap. 14, night be carried into execution, and that the appeluiats and all the other creditors might be paid out of the *oint and separate property of the partners in the bank, and out of the property of the persons whom the Master should find to have been members of the copartnership within three Sears previous to the stoppage, The ofndac assignee filed an affidavit in answer to the petition alleging that the 33d of George IL did not apply to jointstock banks constituted under the 6th of George IV., cap. 42, and that the shareholders were not sufficiently represented by the respondent as official assignee. It was also contended that the 33d of George IL must be held to have been re. eal d so foar sz it was inconistent with the 6th of George IW. land the Winding-up Acts. On tbe 25th of November, 185G, the petition was argued before the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, by whom it was dismissed without costs, upon the ground that the 33d of George II. did not apply to joint. stock banks. The present appeal was brought against that decision, and it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the 3d George II. was left untouched by the subsequent Acts of Parliament, and that therefore the entire real and personal estates belonging tol the shareholders should be placed in the hands of trustees for the benefit of the creditors, and thus prevent innumerable actions at law, -wich otherwise Would have to be brought by the creditors against the individual shareholders. On the part of the respondent M'Dowell it was submitted that he was not t'he proper party to be sued, and that even if the 33d of George I . apphed to sointstoc banks it had been repealed by the Winding-up Acts of the 11th and 12th of Victoria, cap. 45, and the 13th and 14th of Victoria, cap. 108; that partners in a joint-stock bank constituted under the 6th of George 1V. were not " bankers" within the meaning of the 33d of George II., und that as the Tipperary Bank was not a bank of issue it did not come within its provisions. It was also contended that the private creditors of the individual partners must be parties to the petition as well as the creditors of the bankc. The other respondents were persons who had transferred their shares before the bank stoPped payment and who were sought to be made liable on the ground that they had not transferred their shares according to the provisions of the Act, and that, at all events, they were liable for debts contracted before the date of the transfer. At the conclusion of the arguments this morning, The LoRD CnsEAn.-oitLO said that in consequence of the great number of Acts of Parliament and other authorities which had been cited he should advise their Lordships to defer their decision upon the important question before them untUl a further occasion, The further consideration was then adjourned sine die,
THE DIVORCE BILL. The following is a copy of the Bishop of Exeter's Protest against the third reading of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill - " Dissentient,-Because the BiU authorizes the intermnarriage of the adulterous parties, but does not relieve the clergy from the legal obligation of celebrating matrimony in such cases with the office of the church. Yet that office expressly declares that holy matrimony, instituted by God in the time of man's innocency, signifies the mystical union between Christ and His church, whereas adultery is constantly spoken of in holy Scripture, as symbolizing apostay from that church and the violation of that blessed umon. In conteimpt of this sacred truth.the Bill not only sanctions the marriage of parties whose ability to-marry is founded aItogether on their being adulterers, but it also compels the clergy to marry them in profanation of the most sacred words of Scripture, and with perversion of the most solemn truths of the GospeL For, even if the use of the office could be tolerated in the marriage of adulterous parties who are repentant of their adultery, yet no security is given or can bo given by any statute that the parties concerned are really penitent; and yet those parties have by their adultery incurred the church sentence of excommunication, which, if duly pronounced, would render them incapable of being married with the rites of the church. If the circumstances of the times prevent the due exercise of the church's discipline, yet the least that might bh expected from a Christian eiature is that it be careful to protect the State from the guilt of countenancing such fearful profaneness, and to respect the conscientious feelings of all faithful churchmen, who cannot but be shocked by such wanton trifling with the gravest spiritual matters - and especially of the clergy, who, if the Bill shall fLnally pass, wil not be able to perform what belongs to their office without violating their sense of duty to God, and cannot refuse to perform it without incurring the heavy penalties of human law. The enactment is the more grievous because there already exists a mode of contracting matrimony between such parties, which not only leaves the rights and sanctions of the church unviolated, but would also relieve the parties themselves, if truly penitent and sensible of their own degradation, from the an nish and misery which they must feel in repeating vows to God which they have already broken, and hearing pronounced over them the curse of God against all vrho have, as they aJreadv. hav,'uasne those wrhom God has joined together, ye, 'put asunder "H.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENC&. HOUSE3 OF LORDS, TaUvSDA; Juw. 25. The LORD CAIANCEIOR took his seat on the jolsrk at 5 o'clock. Lord CAMPBELL presenteW a petition from the provost, magistrates,and council of the fty of inburghx rayig that their lordsbips might pass a By, removing the politicat disabilities under which theJews now labour. LAW OF DIVORCE. On the motion of lord REDJSDArL a Biliwa read a first time, having for its object the removal of those objections to the Government Divorce Bil which the noble lord enter. PROBATE OF WILLS AND LAW OF DIVORCE (1REL LND). The Earl of WICKLOW said that two Bils-the one re lating to the probate of wills, the other to the granting of diverces, having been passod thirough that House, and neither of them embracing Ireland within its operation, ho wished to ask his noble and learned friend on the woolsack whether he was prepared to introduce simnilai measures for the sister country. He should no doubt be told that it'wa~s the intention of the Goveriment to do so; but such inten. tions, he regretted to say, were very frequently not carried into execution, as was shown in the case of a Bill granting license to sell game, which had been passed for England, and which the Government had announced it to be their intention to introduce in tie very next session for Ireland-a pronise, howrever, which had never beal performed. He trusted, therefore, that his noble and learned friend could assure hun that steps had already been taken to extend to Ireland the operation of BiUls having a similar object with those which had passed that Hiouse in rehation to probates of wills and the granting of divorces The LORD CHANCELLOR said it was not only the intention of the Government to take that course, but that a measure in reference to probates of wills in Ieland ws nearly if not quite prepared, and that his right hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General for Ireland entertained a confident expectation of being enabled to introduce it to Parliament during the present session. The Marquis of WESTMEATH said he hoped that the came alterations with respect to ecclesissticai jurisdiction which had been introduced into this country by the Bills in question would also be extended to Ireland. Having given expression to that hope be trusted the House would permit him to take that opportunity of correcting a mistake which appeared in the report of the observationi which he had made when the MinisRters'Mloney Billhad been under discussion on Monday night. He had been re. resented as having said that the Roman Catholics in Ire, rand would strike down the established church, whereas what he had stated was, that the Roman Catholic clergy would agitate the country as long as they could, and would strike if they dared. He had added that the Roman Catholic laity were disposed to live peaceably with their Protestant fellow-subjects if they were only permitted to do sO. OBSCEN1E PRINTS AND PUBLiCATIONS. Lord CAMPBELL, in moving the second reading of this Bill, the object of which is to prevent the sale of obscene books and prints, said that their lordships probably would not be able to entertain any notion of the extent to which the traffic in obscene books and prints was carried on in London. A considemble capital was engaged in the trade. There were warehouses in which those abominable produe. tions were stored, and there were agents employed through, out the country for the purpose of increasing the trafflc. He believed that in no country in Europe did such facilities exist for carrying on that detestable trade, which it was the object of the present Bill to prevent. The pria. ciple upon which the present Bill was founded wrs a simple one. At present the only remedy against the evil which was afforded by the law was the power of indicting the publisher of obscenepublications for a misdemeanour, and from the more than doubtful character of the witnesse3 whom it was necessary to call-'pies and common informers-it was very difficult to iusure a conviction. Now, he proposed to give a powver of search and seizure upon a warrant to be procUred from a magistrate upon affidavit. The principle was not entirely a new one, for it had been acted upon in the Bill which had been passed for the suppression of gaming-houses, which gave not only power to the police, aoting under a proper warrant, to seize cards, dice, or any instrument of gaming, but also to take into custody any persons whom they might find upon the premises, and to procure their summary conviction by a magistrate. The present Bil did not confer powers so large, but it gave the power of search and seizure of indecent prints or publications which might be found, and he trusted that their lordships would not refuse to read a second time a Bill which would suppress a traffic so detestable. The noble lord concluded by moving the second reading of the Bill. Lord BROUGHAM said that nothing could be more disgusting than the publications to which his noble and learned friend had referred, and no one could have any wish but to do anything which could be safely and properly done for their suppression. At the same time he was afraid that his noble and learned friend would find some difficulty in so framing the details of hismelasure, more particularly in giv. iag such a definition of the word obscene, that it might not be applied to some portions of the works of such wiiters as Voltaire and many of our greatest English poets. Lord CAMlPBELL did not intend the measure to refer to such works as those to which his noble friend had alluded. The LORD CHACELLOR was extremely reluctant to appear to oppose the measure, of which the object was extremely laudable, and which had been most fitly introduced by his noble and learned friend. HIe was, however, afaid that it would be found to be impossible so to word a clause that it would not enable a person disposed to be vexatious to interfere with those very works to which his noble and learned fiend had said that he did not intend the measura to apply. Even if the operation of the Bill were limited tx indictable hooks it wonld, as he read the clauses, rest with the magistrate and the supfrintendent of polhe to say what boots or prints were Indictable. Then, no provision las, made as to what the polce vwere to do with the books whe, they had seized them. v Lord CPBELL was understood to say that they mlght do as they pleased with them, there was no property hif suoh publications. / Xho WED CHANCELORc did not like to oippose the second reading of the measure, but unless it could be most materially altered in the course of Its further progress, he could not think it a measure which would-fitly bome part of the law of the country. After a few words from the Earl of GnLINTOUN, which were not heard In the gallery, Lord LYNDHURST said,-While giving full credit to my noble friend opposite for the feelings which have prompted him to bring forward this Bill, I entirely agree with my noble friend on the woolsack that it will wholly fall in its object, and that it is unwise and imprudent to poke into these questions and agitate the public mind in respect to them. My noble friend's aim is to put down the sale of obscene books and prints, but wbat is the interpretation which is to be put on theword " obscene 2X' I can easily conceive that two men will come to entirely different conolusions as to its meaning. I have looked into Johrnon to see what definition he gives of the word, and I find that he says it is "something immodest, something which causes unchaste ideas, something lnconsistnt with chastity of mind." These are the definitions which he gives of the word. Suppose now a man following cthe trade of an informer, or a policeaen, sees in a window something which he conceives to be a most licentious print. He goes to the magistrate, gets a warrant, and then goes in with it to the shop, and says to the shopkeeper, "Let me look at that picture of Jupiter and Antiope." (A bugh.) "Jupiter and what P' says the shopkeeper. "Jupiter and Atiope," repeatstheman. "Oh! Jupiter and Antiope, youmean," says the shopkeeper; and hands him down the print. Hle sees the picture of a woman sArk naked, lying down and a satyr standing by her with an expression oR his face which shows most dfstinctly what his feelin&s are and what is his object. The informer tells the man he is going to seize the picture, and to take him before a magistrate. :Under what authority?" he asks; and he is told- "Under the authority of Lord Campbell's Act." " Bat," says the man, " don't you know that it is a copy from a picture of one of the most celebrated masters in Elurope?" That does not matter; the informer seizes it as an obscene print. He asks if the shopkeeper has got any more prints like it? " Oh, yes, I have got several others," is the answer. Whereupon he searches the shop, and in so doing perhaps he stumbles upon a print of the story of Danae. There he sees a naked woman lifting her eyes to heaven with a strange expression, the shower of pold dessending upon her, a little cupid peeping over r shoulder pointing with his dart, and other circumstances which I wil not describe. These pictures come within the description in this Bill as much as any work you can conceive. And yet they are both celebrated pictures; the first is a copy of a famous Correggio which hangs in the large square room of the Louvre, right opposite an ottoman, on which are seated daily ladies of the first rank from aU couantries of Europe, who resort there for the purpose of studying the works of art in that great gallery. But this is not al. A man goes into the studio ofasculptoror some statuary and sees there figures of nymphs, fauna, and satyrs, all perfectly naked, some of them in attitudes which I do not choose to describe. According to this Bill they may every one be seized,- " Nympharnmque leves cum satyris chori." I w1il go now to the books. I don't know whether my noble and learned friend is familir with the poems of Rochester (a laugh), but I think they would come under the description of this BilL. "The freedom of ancient satiriste," says Hume, the historian, "no more resembles the licentiousness of Rochester than the nakedness of an Indian does that of a common prostitute." Suppose that book is in a certain library lent out for hire; under mynobleand learned friend's BiUit may be seized at once. Ithe same way the dramatists of the Restoration, Wycherley, Congreve, and the rest of them,-there is not a page in any one of them which might not be seized under this Bill. One of the principal chrac trs in one of Congreve's plays is Lady Wis for't. Dryden, too, is as badasanyof them. He has translated tbe worstparts of Ovid's Art of Love-works for which Ovid was exiled and died, I believe, on the banks of the Euxine. There is not a 2sngle volume of that great poet which would not come under the definition of my noble and learned friend's BiLl I need scarcely recall to your lordships' remembrance that oem, Sygfmonda and Guicardo," I ttink it is, be- Whe Norman Tancred in Salerno reigned," In which occnrs the description of the secret wedding, the scenee that preceded it, and the scenes that wareoimmediately consequent upon it. I won't repeat to your lordEhips more of it than this passage:- "The holy man, amazed at what he saw, "Made hta to sanctmfy the blis by law; "And mattered fast the matrimony o'er, t For fear oommitted sn should get before." But I think your lerdshipe will see from thi imen thAt Dz 'g pe,eW IM 4 be pl9d lu m a jble a e friend's Index Eaxpurgatorivt.S Take, too, the -whole fight of French novelists, Irom CrebiUon, jUs, down to Paul do Kook ; rothing can be more unchaste, nothing more immodest, than they are; and whon my nobmo and learned friend's Bil is passed every copy of them maybe committed to thebonfirewith as little mercy as Don Quixote's chivalry books were. But, my lords. I contendthat thisBIll wiUbeentirelyinoperative. The books and printa at which it is aimed are imff in bulk, they may be kept in a retired part of the shop, and only be prodaced when a customer comes in for them, so that, in fact, yon vill not 3lways be able to lay your hands upon them. I feel asastrongly as any one can the infamy of the sale of these books, but, so far from agreeing with my noble and learned friend that a BiU of this description is necessary to put it down I am satisfied that the law as it stands is abundantly strong enough. All that is needed is additional vigour in the aaministration of the existing law. When persons are found guilty of thq offence of publishing and selling these books, instead of getting merely a noaminal punishment, let them be sentenced to such a punishment as the infamy of their guilt merits, and as wil effectualy deter others from following in their steps. M1y lords, I movo tha,t this Bill be read a second time this day six months. Lord CAMPBELL said that, on the principle laid down by the noble and learned lord, not only could there to no new remedy for this evil provided, but the old remedy must bo taken away also. The noble and learned lord said there was no definition of obscenity. Lord LYNDEURST rose to order. Lord CAYAPBELL.-I have a right to he heard. (Cries of "Order 1") Lord LYNDRIIURST spoke to order. His noble and learned friend, having made a speech and concluded with a motion, was not entitled to rise and make another speech till all the noble lords vho wished to address the House had expressed their sentiments. That was the rule of the House Lord CAMPBELL said, an amendment had been moved to the motion which he had made, and he had a right to make another speech on that amendment. His noble and learned frsend rose to order, but he was himself out of order, In bis zeal for these filthy publications his noble and learned friend had gone entirely wrong as to what was the rule of the House-an error which certainly surprised him in one who had so long held the office of Lord Obancellor. (Cries of " Order a o) Lord ST. LEONAIIIYS rose to order. His noblo and learned friend (Lord Campbell) had made a motion. To that motion an amendment had been moved, but theAmend. ment had not yet been put to the House. (Hear, hear.) The LORD CHANCELLOR said the motion before the House was, that this Bill be now read a Eecond time since which it had been moved as an amendment that it be read a second time that day sx montbs. Lord CAMPBELL.-And on that amendment I have an undoubted right to address the House. (" Order, order ") With reg,ard to what has beenx said by my noble and learned friend,- Lord IEDESDALE again roso to order. He thouget his noble and learned friend was under a mistake as to his right. The object of the amendment was to meet the question that the Bill be "now" read a second time, and it w;as not usualfor the mover to speak to suh an amendment, so long as there were other noble lords who wished to address the HSouse. Lord CAMPBELL repeated that he had the right which he claimed to address the House. Lord BROUGHAM said, it was the office of a Speaker to preserve order, as in the other House of Parliament; bat in their lordship2 Houso the office of Speaker was in commis. Sion. Both in that and the other House of Parliament the maker of a motion was permitted-he would not say by right, but by courtesy-to make a generalreply; but he must say he never heard of any one having a right, after making a motion, to speak on an amendment. (Bear, hear.) The Earl of WICKLOW contended that the noble and learned lord (Lord Campbell) was entitled to speak to the amendment. In point of fact, the debate did not begin till an amendment was moved. The LORD CHANCELLOR perhaps ought to havo p .t the question when the amendment was moved, but to do so was not the practice of their lordshipa' House. His idea , f the rle dstimntly wa, that his noble andlearnedfriendhad a right to speak to the amendment that had been movedh and such, he beieved, was the invariable rule ia the other House of Parliament. In point of fact, a distinct question was raised by the amendment. Lord .CA3PBELIs climing his right to address the House, was perfectly willing to waive that riaht till ho had heard such of their lordships as wished to speak upon the question. (Hear, hear.) Lord BROUGHABI said, an amendment might be substantially another motion, embodying different matter, and in such a case the maker of the original motion might have a right to be heard upon it, but the present was not one of those cases, Earl GRANVILEB wished to speak with great diffidence on a queition whicn hadellcitedsomuchdifferencaofopiiMon He believed that in the cse of a substantive motion there was no right of reply, though the House generally allowed one to bo made; but, if an amendment such as had be brought forward that evening was made, then, be v4ed, the rule of the House was that a right to3ey existed. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH tlotht that every man who made a motion had a right toleply, and might make that reply whenever he liked b't if he chose toreplr imme. diately aiter the amcndmentS as made he lost his right to the last word in the debat. (Hear, hear.) Lord BELPEB s*1 the rule of the House of Commons was that any mepber who made a motion had the clearest right to speak,o an amendment If it was proposed, but at the sameti if he did so, he lost his right to reply at the end of thedebate. _LopMONTEAGLE said he understood the rule to be thWno one had a right to spe_k twice upon the same sub.ct, but, if an amendment was moved which was aubstanially another motion, the person who made the original motion was entitled to speak again. (Hear.) Lord CAMPBEILt, still maintainig his right, repeated that he was willing upon this occasion to forego it. lordWENSLEYD.ALE,resuming the debate uronthaBill, said there was no doubt but that the noble and learned lord was animated by a very proper desire put an end to the nefarious traffic in indecent publications, bat, at the same time, he (Lord Wensleydale) was of opinion with his noble and learned friend near him (Lord Lyndhurst) that the common law as it stood, was quite strong enough to deal with such offences. (Hear.) Any person exposing indecent prints was liable to be indicted for a misdemeanour. The extendve powers sought to be conferred upon the police by the Bmill required grave consideration, aud the definition of what was obscene was very uncertain. There was nota library in which books could not be found contain. ing passages which a strict-dealing makistrate might con. eider to biing them writhin the operaffon of this BilL The classic authors might be held tobeobscne, and the possession of L/ucicis LuSluu, or Juversal might expose the owners to the penalties which the Bill prescribed. Lord WYNFORD admitted that in works of merit to which reference had been made there might be found some objectionable passages, but it would bo absurd to supposa that the possession of such books would renderthe r liable to punishment. (Hear.) Thosieworks, includi gthoss of the immortal Shakspeare, werepreserved, not on accouu; of the exceptional passaes which were objectionable, bu;i for the noble and elevating sentiments wthich they inculcated.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Lord CAMPBELL thought that the particular street to which he kad referred, but not named, would rejoice greatly upon learning that the cause of free trade in obscene publi cations had been upheld by such distinguished authorities Notwithstanding the arguments of his noble and learned friends opposite, he trusted their lordships would no' reject the Bill EHe could not see why there should be any objection to allow the same means to be used to repress the abominable traffic in obscenity as were allowed to put down gaming-houses and for the seizure of smuggled goods. The noble and learned lord who moved the amendment had objected that the1Bill, if passed, could permit interferenice with private picture-galleries. When the law was made stricter in order to put down gambling.hous there miht as well have been an outcry, "What will-become of St. Ja6meses-street, of Brookes's, of White's, of Boodle's-there may be gamblinig in those respectable establishments, they may be comiDlained of bythe oLcee, and members of eltherHouse of Par1iament may be taen before a magistrato and sent to the House of Correction." Another argument of the noble and learmed lord would, if correct, Prevent any indictment being laid, for hesad, "Whowastoded nwhatwasobsoenel" Thelanguage of the indictment was for selling or exposing obscene prints or books, and the questiounwhether the pictures orukst impugned were obscene or not was left tothejurytode- un derteÃ¯Â¿Â½ l rvi coletos rgtonerfr ih rLot intended for sale, btsweekffr ,eonr o wDPnVIO v IU:ger was a broad an-d marked distinction between such pictures as the noble and learned lord had so grphically decribed and the abominable prints which could only disgust him, which possessed no artistic merits and which could only be regarded with aversion by every Tight-mninded rson. It was not aainst the masterpieces of Correggio tPat the Bi ll w slevell butagainst the ma3s of impure publications which was poured forth on London, to the great injury of the youth of this country. If their iordahips would read the BiU a secondtimehe thought there could be no difficulty in introducing words in committee to guardaainst any abuse which might be appre. hended ; but he cautioned their lordships against a proceeding which could not fail to shock the public feeling of the country. Earl GRA NVMLE had no doubt that the evil of which the noble and learned lord had coenplainedwas a very serious one, and that steps ought to be taken to put an end to it - but it was no less clear, after the statements made by other noble and learned lords, that the Bill in its presenm shape would not effect the object in view -atleast not without produdng considerable inonvenience. The noble and learned lord, however, had just stated that words might be introdued in committee to put down the evil, bxu, at the same Itime, to obviate the difficulties which had been pointed out. Under these circumstances he for one was inclined to vote for the second reading, reserving his right to consider the amendments which might be proposed in oomnittee, Lord BRlOTjGHAMl sluggested the propriety, after the statement of the Lord Chief whose opon upon suchasub,ct was entitled ustore,t weihto of withdrawn nendt andaUowinOg~ theBillto go to the sW con The amendment was therefore withdrawn, and the Bill read a seond iime. COlJNrY CESS (IRELAND) BILL. This Bill was read a second time. VEXATIOUS LITIGATION PREVENTION SIIL. Lord BROUGHAM iild he did not at preent propo py S 1ibi Bill to 8ecopd r badLg bqt n[ he ^haa glven notice of his intontion to caUl the noticf of their lordship to the subject of vexatious suits, he would take this opportuuity of maklnghis statement. This was a Bill Ximhch tO had twice before ptseanted.to theirlordahip, for preventing vematious litigation by the establishment of a court of reconcilement. He had the misfoitune to differ from the noble and learned lord on tho woolsack and from other noble and learned friends upon that subject. They were, at least, notso suanin e as he was of the benefit' to be derived from the estab'hment of a court of reconcilement. His oWn opinion was a very strong one, and was founded upon what took place in other countries. IQ France more than two-thirds of all the causes brought into coirt were stopped by the court of reconcilement, including one-third of the greater causes. ln Denmark the result was stil more striking; for there, out of 30,000 causes brought into court, no more than 3,000 or 1-10th of tho whole, ever came to be tried, 9-lOtus being stopped by the court of reconcilement. In Germany and Switzerland the experience was precisely the same. n all these countries the system had been found to answer better than in Frauco, because it was under better regulation. Now, knowing the great indisposition of his nolble and learned friends to adopt this plan, he could hope for no mnore than that -they might be induced to approve other parts of the Bill for preventing vexatious litigation. Re had made* one material change -in - the BilL. It origiinall stood that the parties were to go before thejudge without their counsel or their attorneys; but he had been induced to alter it, and to enable tem to go there, if they were so minded with their professional advisers. He now begged to cal the attention of their lordships to the experience of the Examinerae-office of the Court of Chancery since the recent change in its constitution and practice. The present examiners had had before them somewhere about 600 causes, and they had found the process of reconcilement most successful. One-seventh of the whole had been stopped in the office, and allowed to go no farther. No doubt, as the Master of the Rolls, the head of that office, suggested, much of this was owing to the parties becoming aware of each other's feelings. One advantage of the plan, indeed, was that the parties at an early stage, before any expense had been incurred, were brought together, and, discussing their several cases, each knew what chance ,he had of meeting a formidable array of evidence against him, the result being that many hopeless actions aud defences were stopped. But in what he proposed there vas also the great benefit of the parties comingbefore a respeted individu of sagacity and experience, wholly uninterested, and giving his advice from no possible motive exeept that of kindness towards the intending litigants. The effect of that with respect to the examiners had been that in almost all cases in which they had recommended the plaintiff to give up his suit because he had no chance of success, or advised the defendant to abandon his defence because he was sure to be defeated, their advice had been followed. They had told him that a very large proportion of the actions that came before themwere attorneys' actions. Another provision would enable application to be made to compel parties to abstain from prosecuting saits unless they gave security for the costs. Actions the most desperateand untenable were brought; subseriptions were obtained for carrng them on, at the instgation of some pettifogging practioner of the law; and, when they failed, the plaintiff was found to be utterly incapable of paying a farthing. Therewas thewell-known caseof "Smithv. Provis,"inwhich a man utterly reckless, wholly unprincipled, as dishonest as any man who ever entered a court of justice, brought an action of ejectment against the proprietor of an hereditary estate, and put that proprietor not only to great expense but to great anxiety for months and years. The claim on his property was defeated. Smith himself was examined, and a person seeing in the London papers an account of the examination was enabled to send down a telegraphic message which convicted I him of the fabrication of a ring and of the forgery of a I document. He was tried for forgery. He might also have been tried for perjury, but he was tried and convicted of I forgery and sentenced to transportation for life. The I defendaut in the action brought by that man had to pay between 7,0001. and 8,0001. It might be asked how were the funds for carrying on the uroceedings provided I He grieved to say they were proviced by the subscriptions of persons in London and Bristol, who, on the promise of 150 per cent., were ready to speculte on the chance of saccess; but those persons would tot have been willing to run the risk of having to pay the whole costs in the suit. He would answer for it that if there had existed sach a provision as he proposed, Smith would never have found any person to give security for costs. He had reminded their lordships of that remarkable case, but there were many of smaller amount in which the defendants were put to an expense of 400?. or 5001. by these vexatious proceeding. The only other provision was to cure a defect in theinsolvencylaw. The Insolvent Court did not possess the power of visiting parties to vexatious suits with punishment, unless they happened to be defendants. He proposed to make the power of punishmeut apply equallyto the ilaintiffs. The noble lord concluded by moving that the debate be adjourned, The LORD CHANCELLOR said he was opposed to courts of reconcilement, beeause he bexiedheywoul be only sinks for addingto4hq-eiF of ordinary litigation. When it wsid-Uat the examiners in the Court of Chanceraj,iehodthey could often put an end to suits, it should be -rehiembered that the parties had been in violent hostility to each other for some tame, and, the truth having all come out, were more likely to listen to the suggestions of a settlement than they were before the suits were commenced, With respect to the proposal to call upon the plaintiff to give security before entering upon a suit, he could only say that it was one which in his opinion was open to grave objection, because the judge who wasto fixthe amount of security could know nothing about themerits of the case without having the whole matter investigated before him. The object which his noble and learned friend sought to accomphah was no doubt one of great importance, and its attainment would be productive of considerable advantage if it could olybe made consistent with a due regard to the interest of the poorer class of plaintif He must confess that he entertatned reat doubts upon that point, but he should abstain-as his noble friend had moved the adjournment of the debate-from offeing any further comment upon the subject on that occasion. LordCAMPBELLsaid he had not the slightest doubt that a court such as his noble and learned friend sought to establish had been productive of 2reat benefit in Denmark and other continental oountries, but he must at the same tiue contend that it would be found to be totally irreconcilable with, the form of procedure in England; that it would add to the amount of vexatious litigation, and would increme the oosts of particular suits. Out of the causes which came on for trial in this country 80 per cent. were of a naturein which the question involved admitted of no doubt, in which the defendant had not a shadow of a chance of succeeding, and in which his only object was to seek some mneans by which a good defence might be got up. In 10 out of the remainlng2O per cent. to bring the parties facetoface before entertng upon a suit would, Instead of leading to a reconcilement bletwveen them, be, in his opinion, productive only of excasperation. He was quite as much alive as his noble and learned friend could be to the evils resulting from the prosecUtiOn of vexatious claims to estates, but the inconvenience was one which he despaired of seeing removed by the operation of any general law. The debate was then adjourned. GRAND JURIES (IELAND) ACT (1336) AMEND- MENT BIIX, Lord MONTElA3GLE moved the second reading of this Bl, stating its object to be to enable grand juries in Ireland toprovide that publlc works for the prosecution of whichthegrantingof a oertain sum had been previocaly approved by the magistrates and ratepayers at sessions might be entered upon either by means of contract or by placing them under the control of the county surveyor, who was the offioer who had charge of such matters. Under the present system works of the nature of those to which he referred could onl be carried on by means of contract, nd, as a consequence, they often were allowed to drop to the ground, no person being found disposed to enter into the contract for the sum which the magistrates and ratepayers ight have considered to be suficident for their construction. The Earl of DONO0UGEHMORE expressed his approval of the object which the Bill proposed to attain. After a few words from the Earl of CLm;cAnTy and Lord STUART DE DEcrrs, the Bill was read a second time. Their lordships then adjourned, at 20 minutes past 7 o'clock.

The6DoNoGHuE objected to the Bill, not because it admitted Jews, but because it refused equal rights to Roman Catholics, and virtually re-enacted the Act oi 1829, making the measure, in his opinion, a mere-inisterial job. Mr. BALL spoke in support of the Bill, but he obtained a very reluctant 3iearing. Mr. DrwvYN, who was likewise very unwillingly listened to, condemned the concession of the Government in admitting th% clauses excluding Jews from cetain offices, which imposed, he said, a disability. Mr. CoiN S oh7ected to the retention of the Roman Catholic oatis, and I Br. Bowyzn opposed tho Bill because it re. affirmed and re-encted that oath.

At the Council which was held yesterday an order was passed for publishing a Letter Patent, by which the QuEEN grants to Prince ALBERT the :title of " Prince Consort" during their joint lives. No one can object to the distinction which is thus -conferred on the husband of the QuEEN after 17 years of married life. We are not now concerned to ,say whether the title of " Prince Consort" gives to the possessor any accemsion of heraldic rank 'which ' continental Chamberlains would recognize. Suffice it to say that it makes Prince ALBERT legally, as 3he already is actually, a member of the British Royal Family. Hitherto the Prince has had no *British rank whatever. PHILIP of Spain was -itular King of England, but the Consort of the ,Spresent QUEEN is only what he was prior to his -Marriage-a Prince of the House of SAXE-COBURG'GOTHIA. He has not even received a British Peerage. Althongh a naturalized subject of the British CRowN, Prince ALBERT has hitherto iaorne only his German title, and out of 'England takes, we believe, according to the code of Court precedence, only his rank as a younger brother of a Ducal German House. Although :atyled 49 Royal" among ourselves, and no doubt -invested by courtesy 'vith Royal honours in friendly States, the Prince has by birth a claim ,only to the title of " Serene Highness," and must yield precedence to numerous bcions of continental Rtoyalty, whose lot is obscure comparatively with his own. HER MAJESTY has then certainly transgressed no bound of moderation when, after a reign of 20 years, she confers on her husband a title which, ,without giviDg him-a any authority at home, assures to him a high and definite position abroad. Prince ALBERT will now meet foreign Royal families with tAe stattus of a British Prince of the highest rank. -Already, by Royal Order, he was takew precedence -of all members of the reigning family in England; -the new title only assures to bim the same position an other countries, where these matters are ordered Iby.immemorial usage rather than in accordance waith the statutes of a.n.y particular monarchy. We -ay well acquiesce, therefore, in the act which the natural affection of the Quuns has prompted ia making this innovation on English heraldry. The law of this oountry has, indeed, always been that the rank of the. wife confers no dignity on the husband. No doubt this is in accordance with the law which determines the descent of dignities in England. Al our old English Baronies and a g,reat number of the Scottish Peerages are. like the Crown, heritable by women. So, in default of a Salio Law, we have established by custom another which thenon-existence of theformer almost renders necessary-namely, thatthehusband shaUreceivenorank, dignity, or precedence in right of his wife. This has become so much a part of our jurisprudence that we are inclined to forget that it is hardly understood in many parts of Europe. In Spain and Portugal, botl lately governed by Queens, the Consorts of the Sovereign had the title of " King." It was thought no more than just that the husband of a Queen Regnant should have the same social rank as his wife, even though he did not share her authority. HER MAJESTY is certainly the best judge whether a similar regulation in England wiU enhance the dignity of her husband. If the title of " Prince Consort"' gives to Prince ALBERT a higher position at Courts where the wife's dignity. naturally attaches to her Consort, the people of England can have no objection to the grant. It is within the prerogative of the SOvEREIGN of England to bestow any title of honour or any place in precedence, although actual authority within the realm can only be constitutionally exercised in pursuance of an Act of Parliament. Prince ALBERT, therefore, may. fairly bear his new title. We cannot, indeed, believe that the change was necessary to obtain for the PBiNCE fitting respect among ourselves. For 17 years he has received almost every honour which the CROWN or the great Corporations of the country can bestow. The list of his titles and offices obtained before middle age is a proof of the public respect for himself or the widely diiffused loyalty to the CROWN. His Royal Highness the PRINCE CONSORT of the United Kingdom will be to us pretty much the same as His Royal Highness the Prince ALBERT of SAXE- COBURG-GOTRA. But, in spite of the poet, tiere is much in a name, and, if there be increased homage rendered to the new title on the banks of the Spree or the Danube, the English people will be happy to sanction and adopt it.
The Marquis of BLANDFORD takes what is called "a high ground" on the Jewish question. He assumes that this is a Christian country, and Parliament a Christian assembly; and that this implies, by necessary consequence, the disqualification and exclusion of those who declare themselves not to be Christians. We keep up forms, we cherish ceremonies, we retain the same emblems for ages. Christianity is something more than a form, a ceremony, or an emblem; it is a faith and a fact, and has far more claims to our reverence than any idle pageant or empty bauble. It is the palladium of our State. Do it the least dishonour and the charm is broken. Such is the line taken by the noble Marquis, whose impressive mind very faithfully records the talk of certain circles where religion has taken refuge from the torrent of ungodless. Shocking, however, as it may seem, we have a distrust of high grounds; there are so many of them, they are so various and discordant, and, so vety ancharitable. There are people who take a high ground, and who accordingly cut, insult, and traduce everybody who does not hold with them the doctrine of particular election and irresistible grace. There are others wbo take a higher ground, who cut, insult, and traduce everybody who will not agree with them on certain explanations of the Thirty-Nine Articles and the proper furniture of altars. The King of NAPLES is taking a high ground; so also is the Emperor of AuSTRIA. The Chinese take a very high ground, much higher than the Marquis of BLANDFORD; for they exclude outer barbarians not only from their offices and councils, but from their verysoil. The Jewish law, inits originalintegliuy, was very high ground, and every step, every change of dispensation, judges, kings, and prophets, down to that very mixed and temporized condition which paved the way to the Christian' advent, was a sad falling off, as the zealots of those days continually deplored. According to the letter of the Law, the Jews ought not to have allowed- a single Roman in the land; they ought not to have paid CEsAn a penny ; they ought not to bave rendered his servants either custom or honour ; and they ought to have disposed of lawbreakers after their own fashion, instead of remitting them to the Roman Governor. They ought not tohave had any dealings withthe Samaritans. They ought to have considered that they were a peculiar people, and therefore ought not to have scattered themselves all over the earth, coming into impious contact with idolatry, wherever a profitoffereditself. On high ground, and as a good Jew, a Hebrew of Hebrews, and true to his early instructions, ST. PAUL, though he could not help being born at Tarsus, ought not to have entered into intimate relations with the Roman Proconsuls, Governors, and Captains. The truth is, that by a very extraordinary coincidence the high ground originally enjoined on the Jews, and occasionaUy though only partially observed by them, was given up more and more, till it disappeared just at the very moment when, according to our faith, the fulfilment of their promise had come, and a still higher ground was opened to them. Mere want of space compels us to pass many other notable instances of high ground taken by respectable nations, such as the objection of the Egyptians to eat with the Jews, what are called the prejudices of caste in India, the hostility of the QuxN of the Rovas to all foreigners, aad the 'practice of the Feejees aud other tribes, not only to slay, but in some instances even to eat, all foreigners. It is necessary to have an eye on these cases of high ground, since the habit of asserting religious truths by simply excluding dissentientb from society and from political rights, though starting from a high principle, miny lead to questionable results. Experience has. shown that it is neither the maost efectual nor the most improving way of showing our light before men. When we tell people that. on account of their deep and honest religious convictions we can have nothing to do with them, except just borrow their money, levy taxes from them; and bry and sell with them, they 'wil be apt not to love us. Exclusion is a very disag;reeable thing, whether social or political. It frets and cankers the temper of its victims. It commonly aggravates their obstinacy, and deprives them of the opportunity, which some may possibly desire, of coming over to us in a quiet, disinterested way. Here have we half-a-dozen societies, maintained bygood people at the cost of many thousands a-year; and a Bishop of JExaSALEDI with a diocess of fifteen British residents, an average of about as manytravellers, and not quite so many Jewish converts maintained by the mission. The usual explanation offered for this poverty of results is that the Jews turn converts adrift, driving them out of their synagogues and their marketplaces. That is, they take a high ground. We cannot expect them to gi'ee up their bigotry till we give up ours. They will expel every convert from their community if we persist in driving them out of our national Synagogue. Exclusion is a game that tvo people can play at-as, indeed, all the world has played at it in turn, the worst ann weakeat nations the most. But that is the peculiarity of this so-called " high ground." It is not the way to teach and baptize all nations. It is a aort of Epicurean Christianity-a sitting aloft and contemplating our own perfections, without cariffg for the rest of the world. Its only warrant is derived froni those states of religion in which a small body of believers was to be preserved with a fixed character for ages in the midst of depraved and incorrigible nations. Exclusion answered its purpose then to some extent, but was gradually relaxed when religion became an active rather than a passive power. Exclusion-that is, the exclusion of the Jews from our public offices and councils-has no warrant in the Christianity of the Gospel, and is opposed to its liberal and comprehensive genius. In the Scriptures of that Gospel not a word can be found to justify the doctrine that a Christian ought not to sit at the same council with a Jew, and confer with him for the common good of their common country. As this high ground has been repudiated by the House of Commons, which no longer pretends to be either a Propagation Society or an Inquisition, we presume that the Marquis has an eye to the Loids, where Lord DERnBy awaits the arrival of the measure. If it had come up damaged and. wounded, faltering and staggering from a succession of heavy blows, he might, perhaps, think it worth while to put out his whole strength against it. In our opinion, however, he will take a course much more conformable to his own genius, as well as to the .particular circumstances of his party. Suppo3e he threw out the Bill in the Lords, and suppose in the course of time he found himself and his friends once more in office. HIe wouldahave to meet the Jew Bill every Session, and to survive as well as he could an increasing majority in the Lower House against him. Lord DEnBy can have no such great anxiety to defeat Mlinisters in one House when they will always be able to beat him nin the other, and that the more popular and more powerful one. It is his interest, and the interest of his whole party, to see the question settled for ever. Possibly he may wish to preserve what we must call by courtesy the consistency of his character. If so, let him mako a speech against the Bill-a very fane speech; let him declare that his mind is unchanged, his conviction sound, his faith unsullied, but that he has not the heart to resist the tendencies of the age. So he will deliver his conscience, and fight a losing battle. We trust he wil do this, for a man who leads and loses, who pushes on his followers, and keeps them always on the threshold of office, with no wish himself to go further, is a very unprofitable sort of chief, and his service but a thankless one. His follou ers will at last be apt to perceive that he really stops the way.
The remarks made by his IRoyal Highness the Duke of CA3YBRIDGE in his speech at the Junior IJnited Service Club on the subject of Military Education redound greatly to his credit as a General in command, and promise well for the improvement of the Army under such auspices. The case could hardly have been stated in plainer words. " It is only," said his Royal Highness, addressing the officers around him, " by studying our pro"fession that we can hope thoroughly to under"stand and qualify ourselves for the position "in which it may please PnovIrDNcB to place "vs. Nothing can be of such value to the mili"tary service as carefully studying all its details "in a practical way." The truth of these observations is so evident and the maxims inculcated are so obvious that it is hard to understand how such principles could ever have been over- looked, or been so far forgotten as even to be in. need of advocacy. Nobody in serious argument would ever deny that there is such an art as that of war ; that it must be studied before it can be mastered; that on its mastery the fate of a nation may depend, and that military officers are the class of persons on whom this duty is incumbent. Yet hitherto, whatever may have been our general assumptions, it is certain that professional studies were but little pursued in the British Army, nor has there, indeed, been entire unanimity among military authorities as to the extent to which the deficiency should be remedied. It is fair to observe that such opinions may be traced in a great measure to the peculiar character of the service which our troops are called upon to discharge. In ordinary seasons the British Army has always been worked by regiments, nor was it often that an officer had much opportunity or much occasion to study anything beyond the limits of his own corps. Captains and subalterns did their duty if their companies were In good order, and commanding officers if the battalion generally was in a proper state of discipline and efficiency. Nor can it be denied that these conditions wera usually fulfilled. Our regimental organization was admirable. If some officers were foolishly or frivolously inclined, others were well-enough disposed to such practical studies as came under their notice, and the regiments of the Army, regarded as units, displayed an appearance of promise which was not falsified by the test of actual service. The great fanlt, however, of this system was to be found in the fact that, whereas officers with more extensive capacities were required in the general organization of an army, the onlypractical school for them was in that very regimental system the scope of which was so confined. If, besides the several battalions of an army, there was another corps totally distinct in its origin and character, which could be always relied upon for administration and guidance, the case would be different, but this, in reality, can never occur. Nominally, indeed, a " Staff Corps" may be maintained for these very duties, and may be organized apart from the rest, but it must be composed, after all, of military officers-of those very men who, when not selected for this purpose, must be engaged in ordinary service. There can be no permanent or essential separation between officers of the Line and officers of the Staff. The latter must be made out of the same material which supplies the former. All alike are officers of the Army, engaged in the samei profession, and liable to the same calls. In actual service they may have to interchange functions, or to take upon themselves, duties created by the cmergency, for which nothing but general professional training can, properly qualify them. Here was the great shortcoming of our system. Our regimental officers -were excellent, but their excellknce was not of a kind to yield excellence of other descriptions; and the education of the Army in general needs elevating for this simple reason,-i that it is from the general Army that the special officers must be selected. If we regard the question for a moment from another point of view, and ask why professional studies should not have been more popular, the explanation of the fact will probably be found in a variety of considerations. In the first place, such kind of exertion, being neither compulsory on the one hand, nor remunerative on the other, was nat-urally not very fashionable, and, indeed, was positively disparaged. HisRoyal Highness described very accurately the sentiments thus produced, when, in allusion to the utility of practical stady, he observed, " I have heard it said that it would "be too much of ' the shop' to do that;" but the words which followed cannot be too widely circulated. " Gentlemen," proceeded the Royal Duke, " if we do not do that we arenot of&ivets, "and what is the use of telling a man thatihe is I cdoing wrong when we ourselves do not know "what is wrong and what is right I' There needs but advice from such a quarter to 'dissipate all such ideas as those ta. which we have referred. When the General in Command of the Army states his decided opinion that every branch of the profession should be regularly atudied, stidy may soon be expected to. take its proper place in military estimation. A more plausible ground of depreciation may be discovered in the idea that war is not one of the sciences which mere book learning can ever teach, and that it is possible for a man to pass a very good exanlination and yet make a very indifferent officer. In a certain sense this is true. Miitary excellence does require qualifications which are not to be gathered from study; but if study, or observation equivalent to study, be not added to such qualifications they will be thrown away. Nothing is more erroneous than to suppose that a great military genius diseards details. The one prominent feature in the campaigns of the greatest Generals is their sedulous attention to the smallest points connected with the efficiency of the soldier or the Iregiment. The master strokes of Nsoeotiw's art depended nos -merely- on' the first conception of a grand manceuvre, but-- on the prodigious accuracy with which he calculated the. chances of every contingency, provided for every risk, and regulated the march of every battalion. Genius, of course, in this, as in other pro-. fesaions, comes from nature, not from study; but genius never neglects the aid which study can supply. We do not overlook the fact that, independent both of genius and study too, there is a certain faculty of resource and self-reliance of the very highest value in the military profession. It is this which, in the Report upon Military Education, the Commissioners 'describe as cultivated in some foreign Academies by the encouragement of a tone of feeling resembling that prevailing at our best public schools, and it is this which, originating in English character, and admirably developed by public school education, constitutes perhaps the groundwork of that peculiar excellence for which the British service is renowned. It is alleged that the aptitudes arising from this general manliness is not only not created, but may actually be damaged by close study, and we are sometimes asked whether CLIvE, for example, would have been likely to give evidence of his capacity by his performance before regular examiners ? To such inquiries and such arguments there is the same reply as in the case of military genius. Aptitudes of character are of the utmost value, but they become more valuable stiU when enhanced by professional study. To praise the natural capacities of British officers is simply to extol the nature of the material with which we have to deal, and to give reasons more cogent than ever for turning such material to the best account. What, indeed, after all, is the end, purpose, and meaning of MDlitary Education ? It is nothing but the training by which a soldier may be enabled to make the most of his means. As discipline and equipment make 301diers more powerful than other men, so military science will make certain soIdiers more powerful than other soldiers. The art of war is that art which will bring war to an end as soon as possible, which will help to secure victory against odds, and which will reduce to a minimum the sacrifice of life incurred in the operation. How, then, can such an art appear either unattractive or superfluous in the eyes of a soldier? We do not believe that our officers-whatever may be their social positionare deterred by the mere aspect of work. Men of birth And fortune will labour fast enough under other conditions-at school, at the Universities, at the Bar, or -in Parliament. - To induce similar exertions in the Army nothing is required beyond a plain representation of the case and a fair prospect of encouragement, nor do we think that any words could be better calculated for the information of the service than those which, in a brief and straightforward speech, have now fallen from the ComruA?zmn-N--CmF.'

COUr.T OF COMMON Couzmm.-At a Court of Common Council held yesterday the Lord Mlaror stated that the Court had waited upon the Queen with the address recently voted, and had received a most gracious answer. Mr.j Fry, the Chairman of the Committeo of Privileres brought up the report of the special committee appointed in May last to examine into the charges brought against Sir William Magnay. The committee stated that, as Sir W. Magnay had resigned his gown, they did not consider it necessary to proceed further, and they recommended that the committee should be dissolved. An amendment was moved by Mr. De Jersey for the production of the minutes of evidence taken by the committee, but the original motion for the dissolution of the committee wRS carried. Mr. Fry brought up the report of the Special Revenuo Committee, to whom on the 21st of May last it was referred to examine into the amount and particulars of the revenue, the expenditure and liabilties of the various funds and estates of the corporation, for the purpose of considering and reporting to the Court whether some more economical mode of meeting its obligations may not be adopted, Instead of effecting temporary loans at the high rate of interest which the exit.ing state of the money-market requires for all necesary advances. The report was agreea to. In answer to a question, theLord Mayor said that no particular arrangenients had been made by the Government for the accommodation of the Corporation of London in Hyde Park to-day. Mr. ROBS gave notice of motion " that this court is of opinion that it is expedient that a new metropolitan market for the sale of meat and poultry should be Formed on the vacant site on the north side of Lon-laue, comprising therein a portion of the ancient site of Smithfield, the land which has been purchased by the corporation, and on such other property as may be required, and that it be referred to the Markets Improvements Committee to draw up plans and estimateS and to commuriicate 'with the Government to ascertain whether the Government would be disposed to contribute a portion of the moneys necessary for such a purpose, sad, if so, what amount, and that the said committee do report tbereon." Upon the motion of Mr. Anderton, it was referred to a committee forthwith to ascertain the several vacant site3 of land within the city of London belonging to or under the control and management of the Corporation, and where situated; their supposed values, to let; and in what way such sites can be best and most advanthgeously disposed' of; also, the amounts paid for the purchases or such sites, and how long the same had been acant and unproductive. iMr.1 Lawley submitted a motion, tothe effect that the trade of the inhabitants had beenseriously injured by the removal of Smithfield, and suggesting that steps should be taken to provide a remedy for the evnls complained of. The motion gave rlse to a long discus8ion. Deputy Bowver moved the prenious question, on the ground that the motion of Mr. Anderton, just agreed to, comprehended all the points connected with the subjoct The amendment was agreed to, and the Court shorty after wards adjourned.

MILITARY EDUCATION. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.

EDUCATION IXT THE ARMY. At a banquet given by the Junior United Bervice Club on Mhonday last, to celebrate the opening Of their new clubhouse, the Duke of CAsninoDG iaid, in acknowledgnment of the toast in his honour,-Gentlemen, we live in peculiar times, and while I .have the honourof presiding at the highest post, I am convinced that -u will every one aid xme, and all try to do your duty. (hers) I feel the difficulty Of My position, and I expeet you codial support. We live in a country that is perfectly free, and where every man is permitted-and not only permitted, but encouriged-to say anything he likes. I should be sorry to see any change in that respect. (Hear, hear.) We must, however, take care that we are not carried away too far. We live in a time when the edao catUqn of the army has been placed on a sounder footing than ever it was before, but I should feel extremely Orry to see that carried to such an extent as to be a permknent Injury to the army. Soch a course would, without doulft, do great. injury to both Eervloes. (Hear, hear.) As regards the generAl efficiency of the arny I may be permitted to miake one or two obeervations. I may revert to what my gallant friend said about myself, and add that it'is only by studying out profession that we can hope thoroughly to understnd and qualify ourselves for the position in which it -=ay please ProTidence to place us. (Hear, hear.) -Nothing can be of ;uch value to the military service as carefully studying all its-details in a practical way. I can speak with some knowledge when I say that from the attention which I have given to details I feel in the proud position of having -confidence in myself. (Cheers.) Most strongly do I feel that the officers of the army should follow thesame course. I have heard it said that it would be too much of " the shop' to do that. (Launhter.) Gentlemen, if we do not do that we are not officers;' and whit, is the use of telling X man that he is doing wrong when we ourslveado not knoow what is wrong or what is right? (Hear, hear.) I am afraid, gentlemen, I shall be thought an extreme bore, bu.t I assure you that I intend to make every offioer in the army -Audy every branch of his duty. I ar determined, with the support of my rriends and the country, to carry out all those principles to the utmost extent as far as 'in me lies-that is my irm determination. (Cheers.) It has been said that British officers will not take the trouble of detail to which I have alluded, but I Inow ther will. I have seen their gallantry in the field, and with a ood knowledge, of the details of their profession we shall cave one of the mo%tsplendid- boies of officers in: the world. (Cheers.) With -this knowledge of our' duties, gentlemen I Eee no reason why the military serrice should not be as higbly. educated as any other. We have officers to lead and troops to followr-I wl not say where, for Ihave seen what they can do-and there sed be nothing to fear. I have been led into these oberations b e eeing so many branches of the service around me, madI trust, in conclusion; that when any of you bring anything before- me in justice you will always find me doibg mny duty, and supporting you in yours.

FOBBIGN INTEBLLIGBNE. FRANE. (FROM 01UR OWN cortRwroXI)ENT-) 'II2e fd'e 4g IIu-t4 in tr iccLd eiticn ye; tereEr .-I FABS, WxoNDN AY, JuNz 24, 6 P.u The movement caused by the elections begins to subside as the accounts come in from the depart ments of the suacess of the Government candidates. The mortification at first vlsible at the Hotel de 'Vile when the returns showed General Cavaignac (though his final succes3 is as yet uneDrtain), M. Carnot, and M. Goudchaux in a majority, begms to paes away, and give place to contentment, real or pretended. Official people now declare that nothing can be more flattering than the result; while, on the other hand, the Demoeratic pary express the greatest satisfaction. Neither the" Minister of the Interior nor the Prefect of the Seine nor the Prefect of Police regards his positfon as menaced; and we are now told they merit praise for successful zeal rather than for mischievous remissness. Everybody expresses himself satisfied with the re3ult; whether he feels so or not is another question. A zealous partisan of the Government declares that "1 the success is even greater than was supposed, and the defeat of the Opposition is so complete as to resemble a rout." Amid all this exultation one can easily perceive that the number of those who have abstained from voting is considerable. The Government says that those who abstained ought to be counted for rather than agaist itan asumption by no means certain. Be this as it may, it is a fact that out of the 356,069 registered electors in the department of the Seine 212,899 have voted, and 143,170 have abstained. In the elections of 1852 there were 338,843 registered electors, of whom 240,073 voted and 92,770 abstained. In the Fame year, out of 246,073 voters, the Government candidates had 134,487 votes, and the Opposition 87,778. In the present elections, out of 212,899 voters, the Government candidates have obtained 110,526 votes, and the OppositMon 96,299. So far, the advantage is to the Opposition. On the other hand, the Opposition has only returned Jive members (supposing General Cavaignac as certain) out of 267; these are General Cavaignac, M. Carnot, M. Goudehaux, Paris; M. Henon, at Lyons; and M. Curd, at Bordeaux. There is, it is true, a small number of candidate3 returned as doubtful; they do not belong to the Democratic party, and the Government appears to adopt them as their own, though they have started aide by side with, if not in opposition to, the regular official candidates. Then, again, the Democratic candidates whose names were put up in various places at the same time have been beaten. For instance, General Cavaignac, who was put forward in,I believe, seven different districts, is only enabled to claim a doubtful victory in Paris. Five deputies of the late Chamber, who were generally on the Opposition side-namely, M. de Montalembert, the Duke d'Uze, M. de Civrac, xL Oharlier, and M. Desmnalles, have losttheir seats. TheDemocraticOppositionhad,infac115 candidates in 58 departments, of whom 111 have been beaten. From the want of an absolute majority, three new elections will have to take place in Paris-namely, inthe 3d, 4th, and 7th arrondissements. The democratic candidate, M. Ganier Pages will not present hin;elf at the second trial; he will aow those who voted for him to vote for his rival, M. Olllvier, against the Government candidate, in the 4th arrondissement.

It is not expected that he will remain longer than three days. Despatches have been received from M. Place, French Consul at Jassy, which announce that the electoral lists are closed in Moldavia, and a copy is sent which proves to be unfavourable to the Unionists. Despatches have been received to-day from the French Minister at Stockholm. They state that the RCing of Sweden, whose health had considerably improved, has again had a relapse, and that his physichils prescribe complete repose from all official busine3s for at least three or four months. A notice appeared the other day in some of the French papers relative to the late Princess 13agration, whose sudden death at Venice on the 2d, where she had only just arrived, occasioned | the sincerest regret among all who were admitted to her acquaintance. The Princess Bageration was; borm at Naples, where her father, Count Polio Skavronaky, was Amb asador from the Court of Russia. She was maried young to the celebrated Russian General Prince Bagration, who, after serving in Poland under Prince ISouvaroff, took a distinguished part in the campaigns in Germany during the French Empire, and was present at the battles of Austerlits and Smolenako. He was wounded at the battle of the Moskowa, in 1812, and died soon after of his wounds. The Princess, who had remained a widow for many years, married Lord Howden (then Colonel Caradoc), who is now British Ambassador at Madrid. She left Paris about the middle of May last, intending to be absent only six weeks. She visited Berlin, and spent eight or ten days at Vienna, reached Trieste on the 31st, and Venice on the 1st, where she died suddenly the following day. Various absurd stories have been recounted about the vast property she possessed, and which she has left. Nothig can be more untrue. The Princess had no property to bequeath, except her house in Paris. Acting on the advice of her husband, Lord Howden, now 12 or 14 years ago, and in order to get rid of various embarrassments, she gave up entirely, and without reserve, to the Russian Imperial domains the whole of her immense property in Russia of every kind, receiving as the rce, and not as a pension, as has been errneously stated, a life income of 200,000f. (8,00004) a-year, which was paid in half-yearly instalments. The transaction was therefore immensely advantageous for the Russian Government, as the annuity expired with her, and the property has completely merged in the Crown property of Russia. Such Is the true state of the case. The Prinoces cauld not have had a farthing of property to bequeatb, -and whatever insinuations may have been thrown out respecting the survivors are utterly and completely unfounded The Three per Cents, closed to-day at 68f. 90c. for the end of the month, and the Four-anda-Half per Cents, at 91f. 45c.; Orleans &llway Shares, 1,487Ã¯Â¿Â½ 50c.; Great Northern, 990f.; Strasburg, 740f.; New Share3, 721Ã¯Â¿Â½. 25c.; Parils and Lyons,1,520f.; Lyons to the Mediterrancan, 1,955f.; Western of France, 780f..; Bordeaux and Cette, 776f. ; ditto New Shares, 772f. 5c. - Great Central of France, 628f. 75f.; Lyone and deneva, 750f.; Bank of Cr6dit Mobllier, 1,192f.

A dazing murder was committed on Wednesday last at Bujukder6. A relative of Prince Daniel of Montenegro was shot in broad daylight. He was a young man of 2- or 26, and had been for some time in the Austrian army. He had dined at the Hotel Lapierre situate at one end of the village, and was walking back, arm-in-arm with M. Novikoff a secretary of the Russian Embassy, when, on passing the country house of the Spanish Minister, a man rushed out from a by-street and fired two shots at him from behind, one of which entered the hip, and the other passed through the side. He survived only a few hours. The murderer escaped and has not been found. The feud reigning between the two branches of the princely family of Montenegro is said to be the cause of this atroclous murder, but that any one should commit it in broad daylight, and then escape lnhurt, shows the use of the stipulations to which, in spite of continual excesses, all foreign Governments adhere so fanatically. I enclose you the list of four of the Russian steamers which have gone up to Odessa. They were all built on the Clyde, and most of them have done service during the war as transports. They are:Napoleon III., 747tons, 135-horse power; Caledonia) 775 tons, 135-horse power; Empress, 775 tons, 135horse power; Collingwood, 372 tons, 120-horse power. This last is very small, and is expected to run between Odessa and the Crimea. One came in yesterday from Odessa to meet the mail which arrived this morning from Marseilles. The Jfunwl de Constanti2tople, which had been warned a year ago by the French Government, has now received an intimation that it will no more be received by the French mail steamers, and will not be allowed to enter France. The reason given is that it is opposed to the interests of France. This paper receives a subvention from the Turkish Government, and has naturally to support its policy, which, in the question of the Principalities, which both parties have taken so much to heart, is opposed to the views of the French Governmnent. The Imperial Irade for the Kostendje Railway is out, but the firman is not yet delivered; the question of the fort of Kostendje is under deliberation in the Tanzimat. This latter Council has declared against the Euphrates line of telegraph, on the plea that they could 5not guarantee it against the Arabs; no such guarantee was, indeed, demanded, but the members of that Council still fear that the Turks will be ultimately responsible, so, having no control over that part of their donminions, they try to keep out of it. SPATN. (FROM OUR OWN COBR.RornNv.) MADRID, Juax 20. Among other evidences of the flourishing condition of the slave trade placed before Lord Palmerston by the deputation that had an interview with him on the 10th instant, there was a statement in 27w Times, founded on correspondence from Cuba, that on the 9th of May 12 vessels were for sale in the port of Havannah as sLavers. Authentic accounts, juBt received here, give the names of five American vessels, varying from 110 to 330 tons, that had just been purchased in the Havannah for tha.t traffic. They had cleared, one for Monrovia (coast of Africa), one for Madagascar, three for Boston. It is not of the slightest consequence where they cleared for-the object of their voyage was perfectly well known, but nothing was done by the Spanish authorities to prevent its being carried out. As the Spanish Government uniformly denies, or at leaat strongly questions, the truth of eharges brought against its agents, it is as well to be particular as to details of evidence, andcthe names of these ships could be supplied if desired. We will suppose this done, coupled with particulars of slave-decks, manacles, water-casks, and the other appurtenances of the odious traffic, and the whole nass of testimony transmitted to Queen Isabella's advisers, accompani ed by an eloquent and energetic note from Her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Madrid. Does any one who is acquainted with the ways of S,anish uovernments imagine that a realy good eflect would be produced, that the matter would be seriously inquired into, tha' the guity persons wwoud be punished, that the Spanish Governor of Cuba (who himself has, in former times, proved that it is in his power to prevent such flagrant violations of the treaty) would be reprnnandeT, and warned that, under penalty of instant recall, such things must not again take place ? Not ing of the sort. The Englilh Minister would receive the strongest assur- ances of the good faith of the Spanish Goveruntent, of its strong desire to carry out its treaties and to stop the slave trade, of its intention to address, by the next packet, the most positive injunctions to General Concha, and to institute a strict inquiry. All verbiage and professions, nothing more I A despatch on the subject would perhaps be addressed to Conchs, in the ordinary tedious routine of the Madrid Foreign-office, and Concha would pay just as much attention to it as he has done to previous formal communications of the same kind. This is mere child's play. And, if Concha were recalled to-morrow, and Lersundi or another sent out, matters would not be in the least mended. For the first few months a new Captain-General is on his best behaviour; he is a new broom, and sweeps accordingly. But then he begins to reflect that the period of his com- mand is short, that his elpenses are heavy, and that his friends would think him illy if he came home without a handsome fortune. His vigilance relaxes, one eye is closed, and the trade in human flesh and in human misery again auda- ciously raises its head. With one or two exceptions, all the Captains-General of Cuba have done the same cbing, and they will continue to do no, connived at and even supported by this Governrent, so long as Engla nd contenfz herself with diplomlatic notifictions. To apprceiate the truth of this it is neessry to understand the state of feeling in Spain as regards England, especially since the ignominious expulsion of Sir Henry Bulwer in 1848. Since then Spain seems to have imagined that, of all European Powers, Great Britain was the one to whose just claims and remonstrances there was the lea-t necessity to attend. Since then it has . taken months and even years to obtain the settlement of the smallest matters in which English interests were concerned. Since then a large body of British creditors have been shamefully defrauded. Until quite lately, Protestants dying in Madrid, the great majority of whomwere, of course,Xnglish, were buried in th3 stable of some gasworks,because a nooklofconsecratel ground was denied to them by Spanishbigotry. All these things have been submitted to with a patience and tameness which the Spaniards have not failel to note. I am quite aware that, as regards some of the instances I have cited, a foreign Government could not do more than reason and remonstrate; nevertheless, upon a general review of the last nine years, our attitude with respect to Spain has been so mild and indulgent, not to say tam) and yielding, that Spaniards have got the idea that we are afraid to go beyond expostulation. I do not mean to say that even their great national self-conceit and undiminished opinion of their prowess leads them to suppose that they could cope with Eugland in any way; but they have a vague idea that we sheuld fear the complications that might arnse out of the adoption towards Spain of sterner measures thanl those we have hitherto taken. To sum up my meaning,-theyknowthat we have borne a great deal fromthem, that we have been patient and long-suffering, and they think we would bea a great deal more before giving them the alternative of a strict fulfilment of their treaties and obligations, or of witnessing the adoption of such a course as would humiliate theirnationalpride and compel them to dotheir duty to us. Until they have been shown their mistake, diplomatic notes wil, I am persuaded, obtain nothing from them. By persons who are not as well acquainted as I have had the oDportunity of becom- ing with the ideas and feelings of Spaniards, and the habitual insincerity and duplicity of Spanish Governmenta, this may be thought an exaggerated view of the case, but I feel sure that my opinion will be backed by nine-tenths of those Englishmen, and of other foreigners also, whether diplomatists, journalists, or mere residents, who have had similar opportunities of observation. If the iufamous trade, covertly sanctioned in Cubaby Spanish Governments and Spanish Captains-General, is to beeffectually anl permanently stopped, it must ha by a stern and de- cided demonstration. The best, and Indeed the only one, that naturally suggests itself, is a blockade of Cuba. Such a measure would stsrike terror in Spain, would shake the present inistry, and quicky produce effectual guarantees. Anything less than this will produce nothing but reiterate promises, ever unfulfied, and continual disappointments to those who interest themselves, whether as a matter of right or as a matter of feeling and humanity, in the suppresson of the save trade. As I yesterday informed you, the last interview between Senor Lafragua and Pidal had no satisfactory result-in fact, might aa well not have taken place. The Spanish Government still insists upan the claim for compensation to the Spaniards who were ill-treated and plundered being at once ad- mitted; the Mlexican Envoy refuses this until the result of thejudicial proceedings now going on shaU show whether, as Spain affirms, the outrages in question were the work of, or instigated by, Government agents, or whether, as Memica poBitively maintains, they were the crimes oe lawless banditti. As long as there can be a dout on this point the Spanish Government is no' justified in driving thtof Mexic to the w all, and saying, "PTay first and proveafterwvards." Kevrerthe- less, th;s is in fact what it is doing; and, in the present state of public feeling, it will have a difficulty inreceding from thia false poition. The press, or that porthon of it, at least, which is in the pay of certain persons who think it their interest to foment the quarrel, continues its irritating comments, doing all in its poTter to inflame the wround which it insists has bee n inflicted upon the natonal honour. From these pexons, too, proceel the data which certain members of the Lower Chamber have expanded into incendiary speeches- data which, as in the case of Senor Rios Ross, have afterwards been proved wholly fallacious. The prospects of an amicable arrangement are certainly not bright just at present; at the same time all hope is not abandoned. What is pretty certain is,that the affair will not drag on much longer. It is positive that Senor Lafragua proposes leaving Madrid in the course of next week, unless he is enabled to inform his Government, by the mail which leaves in four or five days, of his reognition as Minister Plenipo - tentiary. His instructions from the Mexican Government were not to come to Madrid at all, unless so received; but he yielded to the wishes and urgent representations of Maishal Serrano and of the French and English Governments. The Three per Cents. were done at 40.50; ditto, Deferred, 26.30.

MO2YRD-MARKsTana CrTy"BJLU . Notwitlstanding thereducion of 80,000l. wh as, occurred during the last 10 day in the stock of bullion of the Ban of Frnce, the directors of. that institution decided this mornng to Iower their rate of discount from 6 per cent., at which it had stood since the 26th of September last, to a per cent. It is believed, however, that by all the 'moBt prudent members of the Board the step was regarded'as inopportune, and that it is virtually to be attributed to Government compulsion. Yesterday M. Fould, who is at present acting for the Minister of Finance, officially called for the attendance-'of all those members whose presence might otherwise bave been uncertain at the weekly court to-day, 'on the ground that a reduction would be proposed and it was fully undentood that, whbatever might'be the amount of individual opposition, the Government would certainly not aband6n their' point. Perhaps if Count D'Argout had still been governor, the reaistancemighthave been greater; bat theirery object of the recent rangements for the retirement of that functionary was asumed to have been, the re'moval of the difficultieswhich the weight of his long experience often interpoed in cases likethepresent. Happily there is ground to hope that the measure, although utterly inconistent with sound principle, may not for the moment lead to serious consequences. The Government are, doubtles, rendeied sanguine by the prospects of the barvest, and are impatient to snatch its benefits without waiting for it to be safe from all contingeacies. Of course, if any untoward event were to happen the position would be one of great dsnger; but if finncial insitutions are-to be made subservient to poltical motives riss of that sort must be rn. The worst danger Des in the use which the precedent is likely tobe put tofor the future. The English funds remain without the slightest alteration. Consols for the 9th of July -were a quoted throughout the day 93k to p e. div. Bank Stock left off at 212i to 214; leduced, 924 to 93; New Three per Cents., 92J to 93; Exchequer Bonds, 98i to Ã¯Â¿Â½; India' Bonds, 8s. to 4s. dis. count; and Exchequer-bills, 5s. discount to par; The discount-market waswithout pressure to-day, and some exceptional transactions took place at a trifle below the Bank minimum. Foreign securities have.experienced a favourable change, and prices were rather f$mer towards the close of business. In Turkish Six per Cents, the trAnsactions took place at 96d for money and 9q and ifor the account ; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, were negotiated at 102j, 101., and 102; Guatemala Five per Cents., 55; Portuguese Ihree per Cents., 46i; Sardinian Five per Cents., for the account, 893; Spanish Three per Cents., 42i; the New Deferred, 26k ; Spanish Certificates, per cent.; and Belgian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 96k and p7k.- It seems impossible for anything to exercise a restorative inuence on the Paris Bourse. The action of the Bank of France has been followed-bY a renewed fall of nearly a half per cent., the Freno Three per Cents. having clored this evening at 68f. 40c. for money, and 68f. 45c. for the end of the month. The fact that the reduction to 5J per cent. is limited to commercial bill., andthat for advances on stocks and shares the rate is to remain at 6 per cent., ia ansigned as the reason for the heaviness. This, however, is not sufficient to account for 'it, since with money at 5W per cent, in the discount. market, the holders of (iovernment stocks can eay get advances out of doors at a fraction above that charge. The Bank Charter Committee coutinue their heavy labours, but, according to report, no revelations have thus far been arrivedl at to encourage the delusion that the means of establishing a " sufficient currency," such as shall keep the supply and demand for money always independent of any disturbance from the foreign exchanges, are destined to be armved at. The evidence taken is likely' to prove voluminous, yet, however wearying may be their task, it is to be hoped the committee 'ill not break up until they have given ample latitude to every gentleman anxious to unfold any idea on the subject. With the whol 'arguments of the various schools comprised in one book it wil be in the power of any person, even if the committee should abstain from reporting their own conclusions, to form a clear judgment, and the public will be 'relieved from a continuance-of that isue of pamphlets -each propounding some obvious and infallible system, wholly overlooked by every previous inquirer-which has been kept up in an uninterrupted stream for the past 12 years. It will create surprise should it be found that the examinations have brought out a single opinion or statement which had not years previously been answered over 'and over again, but an available record of them [ will be invaluable towards stopping similar repeti- tions for the future There is one suggestion, however, which, although more specious than most others that are put forward, has been less discussed than any, to which the committee will perhaps give particular attention. It is founded on the cry of free trade, which, according to many recent signs, seems as liable to perversion in the commercial as that of liberty in the political world. The question is, why should there be a monopoly of the power of issuing notes I " Let us," it is said, "have free trade in money aa in everything else." The days of restriction and prohibition are passed, and, if a private individual, or a body of individuals constitutino themselves a company, choose to issue their promises to pay, and the public choose to receive them, why should the law interpose a bar and declare that such a privilege shall not be allowed to any establishment other than the Bank of England v Even if it be found impossible all at once so far to discard old prejudices as to refrain altogether from the paternal system of State interference in such matters, surely, it is said, it would be enough to stipulate for a deposit of certain recognized securities, such as Government stock, real estate, Ac., with an ample margin. Against such arguments can anything be urged? To the astonishment, perhaps, of those by whom they are brought forward, the answer even in Tile Times must be that they are indisputable. There ought to be no legal restrictions whatever on the issue of notes. If this is what is meant by free trade in "money" the wishes of the advocates of that principle might at once be granted In strict consistency every man should be at liberty to make what promises he pleases, leaving the public alzo at liberty to place faith in them or otherwise at their own discretion. But is it certain that this is all that the agitators of the question demand? Of coiirse such notes must not be a legal tender. If the Government force the community to receive notes as a legal tender they are bound to take upon themselves the responsibility of insuring that they shall, under all conceivable circumstance., be found convertible into the gold they purport to represent. That precaution is taken with regard to the notes of the Bank of England, and it is capable of demonstration that umder no imaginable contingencies can the exchangeable value of the issues of that establishmentbe for one moment jeopardized. But 14,000,0001 or thereabout, which is the issue allowed to the Bank, has been clearly ascertained to be the limit to which a currency based merely on securities can be carried withthe certainty that its par value inthe money-marketwIlbeimaintained. Hene, as the Governmentcannotguarantee any fartherissue that may be made except against a deposit of gold of equal amount, theymust of course refrain from assuming any liability with regard to it. To prevent misconception it must therefore be provided that all notes except those of the Bank of England should be stamped with the words "not a legal tender," or if this should be deemed an unjustifiafble compulsion by the extreme sticl;ers for license, the -difficulty might be equally well met by the 'words "a legal tender" being prominently affixed on all Bank of England notes, leavin-g the publio to discriminate the probable value of the paper on which this inscription is wanting. Such a provison in connexion with the existing powers of the criminal law would undoubtedly supply all the protectionthe community are entitled to insist upon. In case of attempt. topass other notes thanthose of the Bank of England as "money" the courts of Justice could at once meet the evil If any person asks Mr. A for his note there can be nothing wrong in the transaction, but if Mir. A gives his promise to nay on demand to a customer across his counter; who through being a foreigner or an ignorant person is' led to assume- that he has received a legl disbursement, then,, of course, Mr. A must hold bchim liable to sustain, the penalties which, as the la,w already stands apply to all anaRlogous p rooeedings..

A scheme had been framed for the future managementof the charity and the case now f rther contideration and for the confirmationOfmhescheme, in which certain altereatinas were made, the only question now was as to costs. Certain persons representing the parishioners of Hampstead had attended before the Chief Clerk, there being so provision in the original scheme that they ehould be represented in the management of the charity; and it w3s ultimately arranged that three persons, to be chosen by the oampstead board of guardians, should take part insuch management Mr. ROXBURGH appeared for those parties who had com in before the Chief Clerk, and asked for their costs. Mr. S. SmITH appeared for a gentleman named Jackson, who was a trustee of the charity and had answered separately, and asked for his costs. Mr. TOILBB said that the costs of one set of trustees only o to come out of the charity property. V. Terrell appeared for the Attorney. General. The VICE-CHANCELi0i thought that this charity stood upon a somewhat peculiar footing, for it appeared that the parishioners of Hampstead were more immediately interested in it than was usual in such cases. This formed a reason for the intervention of the parties represented by Mr. Roxburgh, and, as it certainly appeared that such inter. ventionhad been useful, they mnst have their costs. With regardto Mr. Jackson, who had answered separately, it appeared that certain suggestions made by him had also tended towards the settlement of the affairs of the ch'rity, and, as the other trustees did not agree in those views, he was obliged to answer separately, and therefore he also miust have his costs of the separato answer. (Before Vice-(Canceilor Sir JoHN STuART.) BROWNE V. BROWNE. The VIC.-CHAxoxLLOR this morning gave judgment in th's case, which was argfued before his honour in lNovembe last. The question in it arose upon the will of the late Dr. Browns, of launton, in Oxfordshire, aJd was of a purely technical nature. Mr. Bacont Mr. Malins6 Mr. Ehnsley, Mr. Craig, Mr. Toller, Mr. Aphlett, Air. De Gex, Mr. Hoare, Mr. Pearson, and Mr. Martineau were counsel in the case. The VIcE-CiANComrOB made a decree in favour o the plaintiff; (Before vice-Chancellor SirW. P. WOOD.) LOVBTT V. LOVETT. This case came on upon the equity reserved after trial of an issue at law directed by this court as to the validity of a will and codicil executed by Elizabeth Lovett, and bearing date the 8th of October, 1853, and the 16th of June, 1855. The bil was filed by the devises under these instruments for the purps of establishin them against the defendant, Robert Loveit, who claimed under a previous will, made in 1851. Probate of the willofl1853 had been decroed in the Ecclesiastical Court, and the defendant, Robert Lovett, who had opposed the grant of probate on the ground of undue influence and want of mental capacity in the testa. trix at the time of executing the instrument, was condemned Inthe costs of his opposition. The plaintiff, after obtaining rebateof this will which disposed of personalty to a consi=erable extent, had filed his bill to establish it in respect of the real estates which were in the county of Bucks and of considerable value. The defendant, Robert Lovett, asked for an issue, devisavit wel non, which had been granted.aithough theapplication was oppos-d by the plaintiff. The issue was tried it the Buckdngbhamshire Spring Assxes in March last, and resulted in a verdict establishing the validity of the will and codicil of October, 1853, and June, 1855,a&&I thus displacing the claim of the defendant, Robert Lovett, as devisee under a prior wilL The case now came on upon the equity reserved, and the question was as to whether Robert Lovett was entitled to his coosts of the suit and of the issue in which his contest hud failed. Mr. RoLT andl Mfr. G. L. Russnas., for the plaintiff, contended that the whole litigation had been occasioned by this defendant alone, and that, as he had shown that he had not a shadow of title as against the plaintiff, he ought to be made to ay the costs. Mr. V~ M. JiAixs andl Mr. JESSEL, for the defendant, Robert Lovett, contended that a devisee under a prior will, when made a defendant in a suit to establish a later wfil against him was in the same position as the heir-at-law, and could not be deprived of his costs. The decision of the Ecclesiastical Court being inoperative as to the realty, the defendant was entitled to have this will, which disinherited him, proved in the strictest manner, especiaUy as there were strong primd facie rounds for imputing mental incapacity to the testatrix at the time of Its execution. Mr. WilUcook. Mr. Prendergast, Mr. Hetherington, Mr. Bentinck, and Mr. B. B. Rogers also appeared, but took no part in the discussion, The VIOE-CHNCELLOR said that he could not accede to the proposition that no distinction existed between the position of the heir-at-law and a prior devisee in a suit to establish a wil, the law having at all times favoured the heir, and taken care that he should have every advantae, so as to prevent his being caprioiously disinherited. -xne prior devisee, however, was a mere volunteer, clothed with no natural rights lke the heir, and not in the same .oeitlon. In this case, however. many of the observations as to the heir were applicable to the defendant, Robert Lovett. He had been forced into the litigation at a time when it was not certain that he would have taken any steps in the matter. Being entitledi under a prior and undisputed will, except so far as it was impeached by the fact of a subsequent will, he was entitled to have the subsequent will olearlyand distinctly proved against him. It was an error to say that he had occasioned any litigation even in the Beclesiastical Court in an improper sense. As executor he would not have done his duty if he had not cHale the attention of the Court to this subsequent will, and sen it provee in solemnu form, coupled, as it was (in the instructions for it), with a document which unexplained was most incoherent, and resembled the ordinary talk of persons under treatment for lunacy. Nor ws hhe beund to let the matter rest in the Ecclesiastical Court; in fact, he would have been greatly to blame' If he had allowed the will to be established without insisting that it should be proved rn to the real estate also in strietform. With respeet to the case set up of mental incapacity, he could not say that it was not a fair question to submit to a jury, looking at the strange letter of the testatrix, with nothing at the time befrthdeedant to explain it, thouzgh there was quite suffioent in the letters suPbsequently produced at the trial to satisfy the solicitor who prepared the will for the tetatrix that he was justified from her state of mental capacity in carrying out her Instructions. Another part of the defend. ant's conduct was more reprehendble, and would have the effect of depriving him of the costs of the issue. No doubt he was exceedingly aggrieved at finding himself displaced, and not unreasonably aggrieved; but he had commitied a grave error In that, not being contented to rest his case upon the incapacity of the testatrix, he had further endeavoured to establih the charge of an exercise of utndue influence against the lady residing with the testatrix, taking up thiL hypothesis wit out adducing the slightest proof. He had not been content to cross-examine the lady herself, but had called witnesses to prove the exercise, not or a tender influence, but of a tyrannical, overbearing, and even overpower. mg~ control upon the mind of the testatrix.

Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Cook Evans, and Mr. Gordon Allen were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Bovill, Mr. Buddleston, and Mr. Saw-yer for the defendants. This was an action to recover compensation for injuries the platntiff had sustained by reason of the negligence of the defendants. We confine our report to the evidence given in the cause, for hard words were used in the opening which, from the course the cause took, the defendants had not an opportunity of answering. John Steadman.-I am the plaintiff, and reside at Layton. I am 5L I am an engineer and smith. Before 1852 I wEa in a large way of business, and in that year I becameinsolvent. My wfe and daughters carry on a boarding school at LAyton. In 1854 I went to Australia, and remained there two years and realized some property. On the 21st of November I went to the Lea.bridge vtation and took a second-class ticket for Shoreditch, and got into acarriage. Between Stratford and Shoreditch the train suddenly started off the main line and got nto a sding, and ran into a goods train that was shunted. I was in the second or thlrd carriage from the engine. I was thrown forward, my chest coming across a partition, and then thrown back again. I was quie stAnned. I found myself afterwards erect cgainst a wal. A great many people were injured. Some one took me to Mr. nancorn's, a surgeon of the Eastern Counties Railway. I there fainted. There were 12 or 14 persons taken there. rw-s examined, and it was said I had no bones broken. In half an hour I was taken to Mr. Whitehead's, opposite, when I went out in the yard and vomited. A Mr. Coveney from the company offered to compensate me then and there. I went to Clapton in an omnibus. I brought up some blood in the omnibus. I went from Clapton home in a chaise. On reaching home I was put to bed immediately. I took the medicine Mr. Hancorn had prescribed. I became worse. I had pain in my head, baok, and chest. I sent to Mr. Iancorn, and then to Mr. Evans, who prescribed for me. I was obliged to take very strong medicines, and use other means for constipation. I took 32 dose" without effect. I was completely laid up for three months. I had a blister applied the whole length of my back. I wa sent to Brighton. Mr. Evans came down to see me once. I was attended there by Mr. Burroughs for three months. I was obliged to have a nurse to take me out of bed and dress me. I returned to London, and have been examined by several medical men. I cannot now stand without crutches, and can't sit upright long, and stil suffer great pain. Cross.examined.-lyhealth had been generally good up to the time of this acctdent for the last five years. I had no illness. I have brought an action against a man who knocked me out of a chaiEe in 18i1, and against the Midland Rail- way for an accident in 1852. This isthe third action I have broughtforaccidents. I didnotatthattime (1852)conmnlain to Mr. Digby that I had suflered a concussion of the brai. I must have given that evidence in 1852. Mr. Digby and Mr. Evans were examined to support my statement. I have no recollection of walking about the day after the trial as well as ever I wa. I wa at my place of business in Bull and Mouth-street. The damagea were laid at 1,5001, and I got, 601. The action against the Midland Railway Company was commened in 183 I did not make any demnmd I don't know what my lawyers demande.L In the present instance I have no recolleetion of how I got out of the car. rinage. Ihave neverhaddei2urntrmns inmylife. IJa not in the ba'bit of drinking. Dr. Salmon operatedl upon mse 17 years ago forprolapsuw ani. L=i10A2ndELL saidt he must ~say thatthis vwas going too far. It was not decent. Crossoexamination continued.-I went to Australia in my own nante. My son-in-law gave a check for my passage mnoney. It was my own money. I never had a distress put in may warehouse. tord OAMrPBL again interfered. Were the defendants to enter Into the whole history of his life when no demand was made for loss of business ? Mr. BOVILL said it was to his credit L4rd CAMPBxLL did not think such inquiries at all creditable. Cross-examination continued.-I have seen several men here who were formerly in my employment. Alter the trial in 1852 1 have no recollecton of telling Williama and Sparks that I had put their names down as witnesses, aud gave them a subpoona, and I told them to say nothing about it. I don't know what3my lawyer got for their attendance. Lord C IAmru..-This isacourse of proceeding perfectly unprecedented. wa triecd for perjury, and acquitted. Lord CAmmBmEr.-Then, we ar to try all actions and indictments. Cross-examined.-I commenced business at West Smith. field. Lord CASPiEm .-Then, this is to be a charge of felony. Cross-examined.-I took off lead and nut on zinc. Re-examined.-I brought an action about the zinC, and got damages. The company's surgeon, Mr. Hancorn, attended me for three months for this accident. He saw the whole of the symptoms. Francis Steadman.-In NovemberI was residing withmy father. When he was brought home he was mauch shaken and was put to bed. The journey to Brighton made him very ill. He continued ill there. He was not able to undress himself. ICross-examined.-I recollect my father being ill from a railway accident four years ago. Mr. Evans.-I am a surgeon at Walthamstow. I have known the plaintiff 10 or 12 years. I attended him for an accident from being thrown out of a cart. He did not exaggerate his injuries. I was called in the third day after this waident. I met Mr. Hancorn, who visited him for three months. I have attended tho plaintiff ever since this accident. He suffers from concussion of the brain and chest, and some degree of concussion of the spine. I now consider him to be paralyzed to a small degree, and unable to sustain the weight of his body on his righb leg, and to us his right arm freely, but leaving the powers of motion of arm and leg very considerable. His face is drawn aside. I thnk it very doubtful whether he may recover from the in 3uries. Cross-examined.-I believe I attended him for the former accident, but I have forgotten all about them. On the trial I stated that he had had concussion of the brain. I don't remember saying that his injuries were then perma. nent. I can't say that I have stated the plaintiff was not so bad asshe pretended to be. I had my suspicions at one time, but they were removed. Hlis symptoms have been Re-examined.-It was an error in my judgment. Surgeons on the of the company have examined him. Mr. urroughs.-I am a surgeon at Brighton. I was called into attend the plaintiff on the 7th of Mazch, and attended him till the 30th of May. He was sufferiug from concussion of the brain, loss of the use of his limbs, and n-Tvous debiUty. He was quite incapable of attending to business. Ciross-examined.-He dia not tell me of any previous acCi. dent. Mr. Luke.-I am senior surgeon of the London HospitaL We have 10,000 accidents in a year. I saw the ?laintiff on the 11th of this month. He told me of other accidents. As regards this rccident, the injury of his brain has led to a paralytic condition. His face is drawn slightly to the right side. He has lost considerable power of the right arm, and is unable to stand on the right leg. He complains of rushing, howling pains in his head. I saw no symptoms of exaggeration. Ithinkitprobablethattheinjuryisperms nent, with a probability of increase Cross-examined. -If he had had concussion of the brain in 1851, and in 1852 suffered from dedirium tremens and psotapsus ani, I do not think the conoussion continued, because he had been perfectly welL. R. E. Tnrner.-I am an auctioneer. I have known the plaintiff for seven or eight yers. After his return from Australia he was in perfect health. Thomas Constable.-I am an ironmonger, and have known the plaintiff 18 years. I was at Melbourne with him. He was a strong, ablebodied man, able to work at the forge. Plaintiff had been put to an exjpense of 901. MT. BOVIaL isisted upon the stems being gone into. Mr. Evans's bil was 691.; Mr. Burroughs's, 81. 8s.

CRAP'LE. Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Dunbar were counsel for the plaintiffl ; and Mr. Mllward for the defendant. This action was brought to recover compensation for a loss sustained through the alleged negligence of the defendant, who is an attorney carrying on business in Great Carter-lane. It appeared that the plaintiffs, Mr. John Carr and Mr. Richard Farrow, are the trustees of a settlement executed in June, 1847, on the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Hocheday, by which a sum of 3001. Consols, the property of the lady, was settled on herself. In December, 1855, at the suggstion of her huaband, she determined to purchase some leasehold houses in Bermondsey from a person named Keyes for 800. The trustees assented and sold out the stock, which produced 2777., the husband made up the difference, and the purchase was completed. It was soon found that the property was utterly worthless, not producing enough to pay the groundrent, and had been purchased by Keyes for 501. Mrs. Hocheday consulted a Mr. Farrer, who was managing clers to the defendant, and on his advice de. temnedtobring an action in the name of the trustees against Keyea. The cause was set down for trial at Guild. hall on tho 10th of December, 1855. The plaintiffand their witnesses were in attendance, but after waatin all day th were informed the cause had been settled. it afterwards appeared the terms were that the defendant Keyes should pay 2001. on or before the 11th of June, 1856, and the plaln. tffs reassign the cottages on payment of that sum. On the 26th of June an ejeotment was brought by the landlady of the houses and judgmant allowed to go by default. No por. tion of the money had been paid, so that Mr. Hocheday had lost everything. The plaintiffs and Mr. Hocheday were examined they stated they were never consulted as to the terms of the compromise, and never consented to it. Mrs. Hocheday ad. nitted something was said about a compromise by Keyes' agant, and she said she would not object, provided she got 0l., and each party paid their own coats. She further said twarsedbyi defendants advice se allowed judgment to be For the defence Mr. Farmer, managing clerk 'to the defendant, was called.o Re stated he had had the entire manaeet ftecae r Chapple never interfered at al When it was proposed to compromise the action against Keyes he conted the counsel en ed, and they advised his proposal should be accepted. fle then saw Carr, Farrow, and Mr. and Mrs. Hocheday, and thev all agreed to accept the terms. They never expressed any dis satisfaction with the terms until October, 1856, when the present action was commenced. He was not told of the ejectment having been brought until the time for appearing had elapsed. As the plaintiffs were now unable to fulfil their portion of the agreement by reaasiglg the houses, great difficulty was experienced in recoverig an thing from Keyes, but he bad no doubt somethig would eventually be got. He was endeavouring to enforce the agreement when this action was commenced Hocheday the husband, who has been separated from his wife for some time, confirmed Mr. Farmer's statement as to the conversation with the plaintiffs and Mrs. Hochedy, and swora they all three expressly assented to the coin. promise. Mr. Justice WrGranT said the question he would ask the jury was whether the defendant had been guilty of neg. ligence in assenting to these terms of compromise; if they were of opinion that he had they would then consider the amount of damages; if they thought he had done what underthe ircuatanes ws th be~for his clients they oughttto find for him.fsuthey Tojury after a short deliberation said they found fo the laintiffs for the amount of the Judea's order. v erdict for the plaintiffs-Damages, 2001.

(S#ings in Banco, before JUvstice CRXSSW , W MS, and WYThiE I uinl was a raule nisi for a setting aside the verdict for the plaintlff and granting a new trial. Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. F. J. Smith, and Mr. Tindl Atldn. son showed cause against the rule. No counsel appeared in ms u ort of it. The action was for the crininal conversation of the defendant with the plaintiff's wife, and was tried before Mr. Justice Willes on tho 7th of February last at the sittings at Westminster, after EBlury Term, when the jury gave a verdict for the plantiff, with I,0001. damages. A full re. port of the triappeared in our columns on the following djay. It willbe remembered that the defence rested on certain alleged letters of the plaintiffto his wifn amounting it was said, to a license and consent to her dishonour. The authenticity of these letters was denied by the plaintiff; who, on the contrary, submitted to the jury that they were forgeries made for the purpose of the defence. This view the jury by their verdict adopted. The leurned counsel ob erved that the affidavit of Mr. Hobler, the defendant's attorney, in support of the rule, stated that he was surprised that the plaintiff should call evidence to prove that the letters were forgeries. Major Croker, the defendant, and Mrs. Ling made a joint affidavit, dated the 15th of April, and descnbing themselves of the same residence. The mor alBo alleges surprise at the genuineness of the letters being denied. It was stated, however, In Mr. Hobler's affidavit that he had had an interview with Mr. Powell, clerk of Mess. Cox and Co., the army agents' who waa acquainted with the plaintiff's handwriting, as to his opmnon of the genuineness of the letters In question. And Mr. Powell's own affidavit in opposition to the rule stted that he had expressed his opinion tothe defendant's attorney that the letters were not written by the plaintiff, although the envelope of one might be; that he (Mr. Powell) at. tended the trial on the subpcena of the defendant's attorney, but was not called as a witness. Mr. Yates, an army tailor, acquainted with plaintiff's hndwriting, also ma de an affidavit that the letters were previously to the trialshon to him by eMr. Hbler, tthehdefendant's attorney, by ths plaAntlt~ These affldaTits, the learned oouanel eon. tended, dipoeed of the grond of surprise.

The bhlls were put in, and the signature of the defendant proved. Mr. HAWKNS addressed the jury for the defendant, detailfng the circumstances under which he had been induced to give the bialls,and which he contended afforded a safficient legal answer to the plaintiff's claim. Mr. T. Kirk, the defendant, daid, he carried on business as a ham and beef dealer in the Haymarket. He took the business of a Mr. Clements, and after he had been in -osso somne time he substituted ring burners for argand Durners.

Cripps, one of the inspectors of the London Gaslight Company, came and saw the ring burners in use, and he said todefendant, "This -wil be rather an expensive job; it is a felony; you will har fromusagain; itis justthe sameas if any one were totake your hams ouxt of the shop."Th same day he went and saw Tully, the chief tnspeotor of the oom any. and propoed a compromise. Mr. Tal y said he could do nothing; it must be brought before the board. A few days afterwards Tauy caled and said he had stated the case to the board, and Mr. Martirn,their solicitor, was waitingat C,rnipp' offic to stl the matter. Defendant went there. Cripps stated the case to Mr. Martin, in the presence of Tully. Air. Martin requested Crippe and TaWl to withdraw.

Mr. Bon gATsi said he should lice to se any authority for taking money for penalties to be imposed by the decion of a magistrate. There seemed to be no consideration for the bills.

COI PuISORY TExPRruxacN rr SCO Y&ND.-It won't do, Mr. Neal Dow, and you can just tell themn so when you go home. You can tell them all about your reception, your meetinga in England, and your visit to Scotland. You may even, if you like, publish a book aboat it, and describe how well Professor M' or can shout, and how enthusiastic a few ot us can get about cold water-in the hot weather. You may, if you please, do all this; but don't go away with the Impression that, although ve have submitted to the tyranny of Forbes Mackenzie and the despotLnm of a few anti-backdoor "Justices," we would for a moment pin our faith to a "4Maine Limuor-law." Don't beleve that the "enthusiastic demonstrations of applause" meant anething elso than a kindly welcome. The audience on Monday night just looked upon you as they do upon the "stars " who come to the theatre; and the crowd shout and clap on the7o occasions from a spirit of imitation. One bold feUow shouts, and the timid follow; but neither the "demonstrations of applause," nor the "hip, hip, hurrah "-(bythe-by, why 'ship,hp, hurrah" it was quite a toddy. drinking simile)-meant that we were at all likely to go into the thorough cold water business, even in the dog-days. We have already seen too much of the abuse which Acts of Parliament on such subjects inevitablylead to-the secret drinking, the selling in forbidden places, and the injury whicb as a consequence, is done to public morals, to wish for any further legilation on the snb3ect. If the present measure, vwhich only restrains the old drinking customs by an hour or two, has produced so much miscbief, it ought to teach us that the less we have to do with Acts of Parliament on such subjects the better. We have been told by a gentleman from Maine that the liquor law there has no effect whatever in keeping people sober, and that any person who wants " a drink' can find ways and means to obtain it. If there be no other mode of keeping a man sober than by Act of Parliament, the cause of temperance is in a hopeless way. Mr. Neal Dow went over all the old arguments, and through aU the old S6gures, as so many have done before him. We don't mind the figures much, because they are used on both sides of the controversy with about the same effect. Nor do we greatly fear for Mr. Dow's figures of speech; they may have had some effect on the hot-headed, impulsive Yankee folks of the State of Maine, bat they won't go down with us. Besides, he is misinformed on some of them, as, when he talk-s of the licensing law being established long ago, and not the expression of public opinion 3ow, he is in error. Tho great fault of all such agitators as *Mr. Neal Dow is, that they do not distinguish between the use and abuse of a thing. Because certain people get drunk -and go mad on whiskey punch, that is no reason why we sbould abstain from taking that " fascinating concoction" in muoderation, if it so please us. But this won't do with Mr. IDow; his way of managing matters is different, vastly .different. If there be a dozen asses in a community who make beasts of themselves by getting drunk. Mr. Dow would immediately proceed to hang everybody that even looked at a gTass of ale. Just in the same way, we presume, would :he legislate, if a man bought a razor, and committed suioide with it, he would immediately bring in a Bill to guillotine all the cutlers of Sheffield. Or,. suppose a 3 oung woman is unfortunately, through an insane love of fine dress, brought to prostitution, is that any reason that other young women should be prevented from dressing finely, or that all dealers in articles of dress khould be scouted as villains and murderers ? There is too mnuch cant canted about this liquor business now-a-days; =nd when a good cause like that of temperance comes to be "canted" about in the shapes now adopted we may be -ursired that it is ngt gainig many convets,- orth
THE CAMP AT ALDBRSHQTT. The 88th Regiment, under the command of Colonel Maxwell, 0.B., quitted the carap yesterday for Portsmouth en route for India. It seoms almost a pity that this fine corps, whose deeds in theCrimea did Eo much towards show. ing the necessity for the institution of an order for dls. tinguished valour, should leave the country on the ver eve of the imposing ceremonial wbich to-day inaugurates the Victor3aCress The regiment was loudly cheered as it left the camp. It is now at its ful strength, the muster roll showing 1,0S5 rank and file. The second battalion of Rifles, under Colonel HIll, 0.B., mustering 780 rank and file, wiU leave Aldershott this (Friday) morning, at 5 a.m. On its arrival at tho Nine Elms Station it marches direct to Eyde Park, and at the conclusion of the ceremonial proceeds to Euston-square, whence a speoial train conveyp it to 1iverpool, en route to Dublin. An admirable step has been taken at Aldershott, which even the troops them. selves'do not dislike, and which wiU convert the dark col. liery aspect of the camp to the gay, festive look vbich the cantonments of the little army, wore on Chobhasi ridges. A real camp is to be formed, and next week a considerable portion of the troops now sweltering discontentedly within the black hideous-looking shells which form the north and south camps will be under canyass. The situation chosen for the cantonment is at the most northern extremity of the plain, on a space called Covecommon, between the Farnham and Farnborough roads. Tho ground is both high and dry,-well drained and amply supplied with water from some fine springs, down to which weDs have been sunk by the Sappers and Miners. It is in. tended that by Monday or Tuesday next the 1st battalion of the Coldstream Guards, the 22d, 54th, and 66th Regiments, with the 6th Dragoons, 7th and 15th Hussars, and one field battery shaU pitch their tents here. With some alight alterations the whole of this force wil probably remain under canvass tiU the close of the sumnmer. This camp is reaUy a step in the right direction, and seems as if Aldershott were intended to carry out the objects for which it was originaUy instituted. Of course, there are some who grumble at the change; and who would grumble if thoy were quartered in Paradise, but, generalIy spaking all the working officers, and nearly all the seniors, view the matter in a true professional spirit, and are glad at what must contribute to the efficiency of each corps going into cantonments. Though, the troops were never more healthy than at present, still the change wil be a benefit even in a sanitary point of view. There is one subject to which we humbly venture to suggest strict attention should be paid *hile the troops are in camp, and that is the cooking. The British Grenadierstout and valuable as he is for all the actual purposes of war- is a most helpless individual when left to his own resources. He shows this fault pre-eminently in the bungling culinary process which he calls cooking his rations, but which, in reality, is only another term for wasting his fEel and spoiling his food. If there Is one subordinate official more wanted than another in the English army it is a cook to each regiment, literally to teach'theyoung soldiers how to dress their rations in a palatable and wholesome manner. Slight as this deficiency may seem, it is, in fact, a most important one, and none. who have once obscrved the wasteful and innutritious manuer ina which the soldier cooks his own and his comrade's dinner, will be inclined to underrate the evil. Adjutants and sergeants should look to this while the troops are under canvass. When the camp was first formed at Aldershott the heat in the cooldng-houses, the waste of fuel, and loss of time in preparing the rations, soon becatne a serious evil, which nothing but the adoption of Captain Grant's stoves throughout the camp put an end to. Each of these stoves now cooks for between 400 and 500 men daily, at an average cost of ilb. of coal per man. Captain Grant has, hoWever, again improved upon these, and erected a stove in the South Camp, which, though no larger than'those now in use, in made to cook for 1,000, and can if necessay cook for 1,500 men. The expenditure of fuel with the new stove will not, it is expected, be more than 3lb. of coal per man'at the most, though by a new arrangement nearlv one-third -of the wholo quantity cooked can be baked-a beon whlch only our soldiers, who never taste anything but boiled meat, can properly appreciate. In the course of next week, we believe, a trial of the now stove and Its culinary capaCities will take place in the presence of General KnoUys. The 11th Hussars wili proceed to Aldershott at the conclusion of the ceremonial in Hyde Park to-day. Her Majesty is expected to visit the camp and review the troops in the second weelk of July.

I IRELAND. THE MU;DBE OF MIL LrmTIV IYUBLIN. TMIMAi7 MiRwlrn- IThe telegraph h&'s,already announced that after more than nix months' clreary and almost hopeless suspense there aeems to be. a reasonable, probability that justioeis not yet defeated, and that the murder Of Mr.Little will not take its plaoe in the liBt of those discovered deeds of blood which within a few years have digraced the records of Irish crime. When the news became known yesterday. that an actual arrest had been made the excitement became tremendous, and the newspaper offices were literally besieged. by crowds of anxious inquirers after the truth of the intelligence, and up to a late hour in the evening the curiosity of the public, gentle and simple, seemed to be quite unabated. The following full particulars are from the mornmng papers " A clue has at length been obtained to thia fearul mystery, which for months has created such a painful inteest in the public mind, and which at length came to be regarded ss an item in the long array ofundisecoveredcrimes- lunthe dispensations of an al-wise Providence, however, light to n certain extent has been thrown upon the murderous gloom in which all traces of this sad event seemed to have been enshrouded, and by which were baffled all the efforts and the utmost skil1 of practised defectives, constituting a force till then 'unconquered; aided or distracted, 8as the case might be, in their laborious inquiry, by the numberless anonymous letters, hasty decisions, and sticlk-at nothing conjectures which emanated from the brains of the deep-thinking portion of the community. I At an early hour yesterday the circumstanoes became widely known that a painter named Joseph Spollen, residig in one of the cottges adjoining the tank from which water is supplied to the lecomotives at the Broadstone terminus of the Midland Great Western Railway, had been taken into custody by Superintendent Guy and Inspector Ryan, at half-pist 9 o'clock rm., upon information supplied by the wife of the prlsoner, who, it was alleged; positvely charged him with pazticipation in the murder of Mr. George Samuel Little, cashier in tho railway company's service on the 13th of November, 1856. It was also known that Spollen had been conveyed to Frederick-lane station. house in charge of a sergeant of the defective force, who remained in the room with him. The oircumstances which led to his arrest were of the most singular description. -It would appear that the wife of the accused went voluntWrily to Superintendent Guy, and :actuated by the combined effects of fear and of conscience, made lengthened, Nad, iE her statement is to bet believed,- most important disclosures respecting the murder, stating at the same time that the conduct of her husband had of late been most extraordinazy towards her, an' that she had in point of fact strong reason to be afraid of him. Shd openly charged the latter with the commission of the marder, asserting that he himself had told her all about it, and that she had, assisted him ip,concealing the stolen property. Her suspicions were first excited by his returning home later than usual on the night of the murder, at about 8 o'lock, bringing with him a bucket in which was a large quantity of money, both old and silver.. He confessed that th nged to r. ittle, and that he had killed him, after doing which be made his escape by the roof. She saw him burn his cravat and likewiise a pocketbook upon that night, and the blood-stains which were upon his clothes he covered with Lanbs of paint. She further informed the police that she had assisted in buing the money in tvo places, and expreesed her readiness to indicate the locaities; she added that the hammer and razor which had been ound in the canal belonged to her husband, and that on the day the latter was found he manifested considerable uueasiness and dread that it might be identified as his property. The statement was sufficiently connected to excite very grave suspicion, and the prisoner having been already secured, Mr. Guy accordingly proceeded at about 1 o'clock yesterday to Capel-stieet police-offlce; where he intimated the circumstances to Mr. O'Donnell, the presiding rnaistrate, 'with a request that he would take informations against tho pioner. His worship, however, declined to do so without her corroborative testimony, not deeming the unsupported evidence of the wife to be sufficient in a legal point of view to warrant him in taking that step. Meanwhile, a very active search had beeninatituted by the detectivepolice upon the portionof the premises indicated by the informant, Mary Spollen, which is situated immrcediately beyond the cattle platform, that lies to the rear of thepassengerplatform for the arriving trains at the terminus. Visitors to this pop tion of the railway may frequently have remarked that ongines and goods trains, when apparently about to enter the roofed iron shed which covers the arrival and departure platforms, offices, &c., have suddenly diverged and ran out of sight to one side of the building, making, as it were, for the heart of the city, and leaving the terminus in the rear. The lines of rails along which the engines run in this direc tion conducb to the extensive stores, &o., which are situated at the harbour of the Royal Canal; and upon one side of the tramway is an elevated cattle platform immediately overlooking the gronuds in rear of the North Dublin Union Workhouse, an separated from them by a double wall with, an intervening space of five feet in breadth and from 12 to 25 feet in depth, this difference being occasioned by nuirerous cross walls, erected to give strength to the platform, and which divide this interveningsp ce into sections resembling large vats, more or less led up with large stones and earth. The wall e rnning along tio plnt. fofm, which lies at the western sde of the railway, rises to a height of five or six feet above the 'walking level, and the second or boundary Wall, between which and the first tliese interstices occu ha e opndicular fall of upwvards oE 20 feet into the fiek; below. lhe last and deepest ot the cavities so occasioned w as boarded over for the accommodation of the workmen at the railway, beir g constantly supplied with water by the stream known as the Braudo;he, which having ran throu,ghGrangegorman-laile and underihe prison, emerges at the grounds of the lTorth Union, flows under the railw-ay at .'he P0it in question, thence ander the Teniple 'and Four Courts, and ultimately makes its exit near ArranqUBay, Th;s minute description is requisite to afford a suitable idea of the p lace chosen for the concealment of the money, which, although daily frequented' by numbers of the empl1opgs Of the company, was until the present occasion completely overlooked in the rigorous teareli that was instituted and beleved to have been carried out in every department of the Broadstone, extending even to the pipes and boi!er-tubes of the different locomotives. Attention was, in the first instince, directed to the necessary - and police-constable Donnelly, 119 C, having descended by means of a ladder fixed 'in the wall, to admitof obstructions being removedlwihenever they occurred, made his way into the inner chamber through an ayerture barely 3 feet square, and upon a ledge at the bottom slghtly above the level of the channel which occurs between the double foundation, discovered the object of the search in that quarter, consisting of a little tub, such as is used by painters in the carriage department, and which, on removal tothe surface appeared to be full of red lead. A few blows of a sledge, however, exposed the deception, for on removing the contents it was found that between layers of red lead or about 281b. respectively there were bags containing no lesi than 671. 5s. in silver, which were so rotten that on being lifted out they burst open and literally dropped to pieces. The difficulty which was experienced in gelting at the tub and remoolug it from its place of concealment would lead to the inference that no man could singly have placed it in that position, and would thus, independently of her having pointed it out when all others had passed it over, tend to corroborate the statement of the woman that she assisted in hiding the moncy. One of the spaces between the walls higher up was next tried by Serjeant Meyers, of the G division, who descended for that purpose, and under a pile of large stones discovered a bundle, which was found to contain 1321. Os. S.Ad. The component portions of this amount were, with the tiifling exception of a few coppers, sovereigns, half sovereigns, and bank-notes, some of which latter were decayed and very much defaced, but none of them so much so as not to be negotiable. It is worthy of remark that the moneys were divided into several sums in the same way apparertly in which they had been received from the different stations, and not placed together in a gross amount, as would have been the case if made up and included in a cashier's docket. Such ofithe notes as are legible do not present any stamp or brand of the company, but there are maarks upon certan of themwhich it is alleged will prove themtohavebeen abstracted from the cashier's department, and upon one in particular, said to be in the handwriting of the unfortunate Air. Little. The total thus recovered amounts to within a few shillings of 2001.; and with the 471. ls. previously found over the tank in the locomotive department, and 501. additional for which the police say they are in a position to account, would leave a balance of only 401. unacoonnted for of the amount which, on the closest possible calculation, is now believed to have been carried away on the occasion of the murder. In addition to pointing out the quarter in which the sums had been hidden, Mary Spollen handed over to the police a suit of barragon clothes of the kind usually worn by painters, which were extensively daubed with paint, alleging them to be the habiliments to which reference has been already made. James Spollen, son of the prisoner, who is serving his apprenticeship to be a fitter in the company's service at the Broadstone Terminus was also waited upon by the polce, and conveyed to Chancery-lane station-house, where be was detained in charge of a police-constable, woith the object, it was said, of givnag material testimony in the case. The elder Spolien, against whomn such a dreadful accusation now rests, is a man apparently about 43 years of age, of a sallowr complexion, and with sandy whlskers; in form he is thin and spare, although athletic, and has lost the sight of one e e. 4e was employed as a painter and 'handyman' aoout the Broadstone terminus; his introduction to the railway company's employment having taken 'place in consequence of the leakage between the glass and iron roof of the new terminus erected by Mr. Turner, and which required the constant attendauce of a man to supply putty when the leakages required it. He was always at his post industriously employed, and his son was taken into the mechanical department from the good conduct of his father, who came over from England to this country in 1840. -Ina addition to his wife, Spollen's family consisted of three sons and a dangihter, and they jointy occupied a small slated house upon the company's ground, near the old locomotive sheds, great taste being evinced in the mnanner in which flowering shrubs *nd flowers were introduced and trained in front of it. Toe cattle platform near to which it is situated lies upon the right-Rlan of the main body of the Midland terminue, and directly oPnna site to tho window of Mr. Little's apartment, which is ie. wise plainly visible from the door of Spollen's cottage. The weekly salary of the latter amounted to I1. 4s&, in addition to which his son received Os. weelkly from the company. It would appear that early in November the accused was employed in painting portions of the interior of the building, and, according to some, upon the day itself, or on the one preceding the murder, was engaged in some paint-. ing work in the room of the deceased gentleman. At the date of the investigation subsequent to the niirder, which was conducted by the Crown solicitor and police authorities, somo slight suspicion, in common with other parties in connexion with the line of railway, attached to tte accused, ana his house was searched upon three occasions by the detective police, but nothing of a snspiciu,S charactr was discoverdand upon examinatidnhegave what appeared tbiagatistac. tory account of his time, slleging that on the evening of the murdor-.he went out of his Own house after tea, at if-pist 6 oqclo* .Accompanied by his wife and son, and made zp - chuea of meat, &o., in Moori-strest, ana did, not return home till half*past 10 o'clock This statimenT w e_ roboratedby his wife, who it -As considered at the tile hAd no means of communicating with her husbind.

C iscnruIRmC, BLAcxmARs.-The Rev. Joseph Brown's usual parish picnic 'was held in the avenues of lysart House, at Ham, on Monday last. The wseather was unusually favourable, the heat being moderated, while the ky continued to become cdeareras the day advanced. The numbers, also, somewvhat -exceeded the asual amount. Arrangements were made with the railway company for the conveyance of 3,000; it is calculated thatthere werealso about 150 babies inL arms; about 250 added themselves to the party, -paying their fare in the usual way; andi there were between 0 and 300 of the chief parishioners. The day passd off in the gayest manner, the grouinds, kindly lent Jor the purpose by the Hon. Fxederick Tollemache, M.P., being peculiarly suited for a meeting of the kind. As usual, the multitude spread itself over a large space, the neighbouring fields ancl the heights of Richmtn I b.ing ocou. pied by the outposts of the main force. But under the lofty trees of the avenues was the host, enjoying itself in various amusements, assisted by organs, monkeys, and othor aids, with refreshments at intervals. hlr. Brown and his family were active in every part. As usual, when the humbler guests had begun to wend their way towards home, the chief parishioners and other friends of the rector of Christchurch assembled In the tent of the garden attached to the British Orphan Asylum at Ham. In the course of the evening Mzs Tollemache and miss Sinclair joined the party under the tent, and the children of the Orphan Asylum, 'iow exceeding 80 in number, were introduced to the comI any. Their healthy, comfertable, docile, and bap?y condition was apparent, not only in their persons, bat an the countenances and manner of all. T-E GREAT EASm=.-The Catadian, -Neus states that the, successful negotiations entered into between the directors of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada and the Eastern Steam Navigation Comnany, according to which the Great Eastern will make her first trip to Portland, State Maine, has excited considerable attention, and that it is a matter of some uncertainty when the " leviathan of the seas" will be finally ready for the voyage ; but there is the -Ifullest xeasonfor believing that it wvll take place early noxt Fpring. It is calculated that she wil be able to take out inoless than 1,000 first-class, 2000 second-class, and 3,030 'ird-class, at very reasonable fares. The duration of the .voyage from the port of embarcation, wherever it may be. .decided upon, to Portland will not be moro than seven days, . and-der speed, at full power, it is estimated, Win be at ilast 18-kn6ts an hour.

By good for tune-there was in the pary wisch accompanied him in' these journeys a lady witha strong lose of art, and herself no. contemptible artilt MMrs Hi?gford Barr. She executed coloured drawings of the frescoes wihich Mr. lyiard traced from the walls. By this fortuiste conjunction have been accutnulated illustrations of thei ni6t inteiesting produetions of the highest art of Ita2y-such -a have never be. fore beeu brought together. - These traciugs and drwings were yesterday exhi.; bited at 30, Charles-street, Berkeley-square, when Mr. Iayard gave an acconnt of his operatingsto an audience compgrising many of the most distinguished patrons of art, ord Elcho taking the chair owing to the inablity of rd' lAnsdowne to preside in consequence of a Cabinet CounciL Mr. Layard told the story of his excursion,illustrated by reference to his tracings, hung round the walls and to the drawings of Kra. Burr, thus enabling his :audience at once to apprec*ate the beauty,of these frescoes as complete compositions, or parts of a whole system -of citna' mentation, while single figuresAnd.detailseweshbo bythe tiac?igs.

To this room there were five keys, one for each director of the Monte di Piethe, and thesefio gentlemen happening to be at loggerheads, it may be conceived that some diplomacy was necessry to obtain tho five keys. And then there was the room to clear ofcorn, wool, cloth, oil-jars and lamps, andl then the windows having been bricced up candles had to be brought in, till at len th was discovered, trced, and recordled in a faithu drawing, one of the most impressive representa. tions of our Lord's resurrction. By the tracini of the solemn f of the Sviour stepping from the sarcophagus,, and byelp y of M n. Burr's dirwing the audience could: apprecowne the power of thea painters conception-the gray dawnbetween the twilight tree-tranks and beyond the' summits of the darkling hiis, the soldiers quietly sleeping round the tomb, andathe figure of the Redeemei, white and wan,with the banner of the cros in his wastedhand, rising,e with astIl serene x ain esty, from the arms of death. Another and scarcely inferior freso of the same painter was shown, representing that sleep of Constantine in which the victoricus cros was revealed to him in a dream -the very fresco so praised by Vari in his life of the paite as havi givenanimpulsetothe artdbiitlight and eyeade. While M. oayard was tracing this fresco the 'workuine were breaking through the wall above it, and a brick falling strack away half the head of the page who is watching the' Emperor. When Mor. Layard remonsated, "Half his face gone?' was --the reply, "Per Bsaccol then woe *ill -paint him another." a ar. dsyard described how when, byi Mr. irkp's efforts, th contemprro poftrai 'of' Dante, by' 'Giot, was brought tloren hTh th. 1 wa ll of'the 'BargeUo, at lornZle, it was discovered that a nain bd been dhiven right into the eye of the poet. So the Grand Ds ke employed a painter toIpaint in a new eye ;. and then the ola face was ropinted to monize it with the new eye; ant l then, as th red of Dantes hood and 'gree of his dress were the colour of Italian unity, the obnoxious tricolour was replaced. by a harmless chooo'ate. Mr. Liyard found the chapel of St. Ceclia; at Bologna used as a cavalry stble, and the frescoes of Francia and Costa destroyed as high as the soldiers cowad inech. One of the finest fre of Fra Bartoloimeo ia d a cart-abed atFlorence. This Mr.Layard foundtu ofwater, and was Olgd to extemporize a drain before he could. begin 'bis wor At Spb are the masterpieces of pintureschi6i the contemporary of Peragino, 'and friend of Raphael. Of these frescoes the audience wore enabled' to formi acme idea frosii the tracing on thoe wall of Jesus disputing with tbhe doctors, than which we know nothiak of more modest grace and divine calm. A few moe winater oins will have obliterated this lovely image from the wall At Cageli in Urbino. is the finest fresco of Giovanni Santi, the father of Raphael, representing a Madonna and saints, int which the portrait of the young Rphael himself, is introduced as one, of the anogels. This' fresco is in danger Qf the bily stdestruction which hags actually befallen another, adlso.yl Giovanni Santi, in the same chapel. In Gabbio isan exqIsite Madonna, with harping angels (traced r.s ya an copied in colour y Mrs. Burr), bOr Ottavico Neill, which fills a gap a in the histry of Uimbrian art. The school takes ift rise in Oderiei, mentioned by Dante as the great iluminator of his time. Ee was the master of Guido Palmerucci be of the lcder Nellio he of his son Ottaviano oell -' and he of Giovanni Santi, the father of Raphael. Of this chain every link has bena SkGmited'by Mr. lAyard's traings, but the works tremselves are rapidly perishing. Our space will'hot allow usto follow Mr. TAyard through his long enumeration of works of equal interest, exposed to the same dang6rs. He himself ba Aremoved from the wal of a half-ruined house, tenanted by the lowest 'class in Arezw, the fine fragments of the great fresco of Spinello of Apzzo, the largest of which is now in the Manchester Exhibition. Of the earlier 'work of Benozzo Gozzoli, at St. Gemnano Mr.S Leyard has eroed tracings from the series ilustrating the history of St. Augustine. Not one of the frescoes we have enumerated has been Aenraed, or is likely to be. At Paniter on' the Lake of Perugia, is one of the best frescoes of the finest period of Perug Ino. Tb Mr. Layarmn has had carefully copied by aibyong artist whom he found Qn thespot and he has placed this drawing in the hands ofptho Arindel Society to be producea in chromolithography, as of their issue for last ytears sabsdiretion, accompanied with facimiles of his own tracings of the heads and upper parts of all the figures. At Siena, in the Palao Publico, is the masterpiece of AmbrogioLorenzettit the contemporary of Giotto, butwa ho worked independently of thatgreat master, representfi the characteristics of good and bad government. It is unengrved. nmr. Layard exhibited his tracings of the single fga n Mrs. Barr's elaborate drawing of the whole comp t Among the allegorical personifications of mtheavirtue of good government special attention was directed to the graceful draped figure of Peac, evidently from an ancient statue, mentioned by Ghiberti as having been discovered in the Sienese territory early in the 14th century. This statue was an object almost of venemtion to the people till the Sienese took it into their heaids that theii -fortune in one of their wars with Florenac was due to heathenish over-reverence for this statue, which they therefore broke in piec and buried in the enemy's territory. Mr. Layird has also made tracings from the frescoes of Luini, at Milan, and Saonno, includinog that most exquisite "St. Catherine borne through the Air by Angelrd' which suggested to the German Macke his immreasrably inferior icture of the sameine sjer. Mr. Layard concluded his address by an appeal to the gArundel Society to arrest, so far as this caE be done by careful copies, the annihilation of these grand works. The society has already accepted for publication in 1856 chromoelithograps of the fresco of Perugino at Spelo, with fac-simiIes of Mr. Layairds tracings. So important are these pblications considered in their bearings upon art that the Government take 100 copies for the use of the Schools of Design. With this the society will present to its subscribers a chrommo-lithograph of the Arena Chapel at Padun, frem a drawing by Mrs. Burr, and two of tbe. wood-engmrvings froma those frescoes in continuation of the ser5s already so far advanced. Mr. RIakin addresd the meeting after. Mr. Layard had concluded, and gave eloquent confirmation to all Mr.Layard had said of the progressof destruotion among the great mural monumients of Italian arL He impressed on the meeting the facts, firt, that fresco preserved to us the beat thoughts of the greatest painters. Secondly, he pointed out that this work was just that 'which could. be reproduced with best effect by chromo-lithography and outline. Then he dwelt on the peculiar danger to which such works were exposed, and the duty that lay -apon uas to' save, if we could, these records of a time when art and literature wer th ony eponntsof en' bet tougtsand noblest canvss nd st is fae t thewal forsafty? Still mire, If e sw amanso lun uderthehores'hoos,and if he calld t us an sad h ha toimprt,som tuho bea. die andl carry his thought to the grave? Even so Italy is calling to us to0 save these relics of her greater and happier timie from. that dissolution through which she herself must pass to what of new life may be in store for her. He did n2oz believe the Arundel Society would be deaf to her appeal.
