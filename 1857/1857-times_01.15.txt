Wednesday Eveng.
The stock-markets to-day have been without any return of animation. Consols for money, which left off last evening at 93i, opened heavily at 93k, 1 but some purchases on the part of the public caused steadiness, and the general quotations throughout the morning were 93i to g for money, ana 93i to 94 f(.r the 5th of February. Therewasno foreign news of ixmportance, and the state of the discount-market is the only subjeet of consideration that exercises much influence. Bank Stock closed at 216 to 217i; 1ieduced, 93S to ; ;New Thiree per Cents., 94k to t; Indlia Stock, 219 to 221; India-bonds, Is. discount to 3s. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to 99 ; and Exchequer-bills, Is. discount to 2s. premium.
There was again a very active demand for money at the Bank and in the discount-market, and similar activity is expected to prevail to-morrow, owing to the preparations of bankers for disbursing large amounts due on the 15th and 16th for interest on r-ailway debentures.
Foreign securities were steady, the operations generally having been unimportant. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 95, and for the account at 95, and J. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the transactions were at 103i. In Venezuela bargains took place at 36, 35i, and 36 for money, and 36i for the account. The general business included-Brazilian, 101 ; Guatemala, 55 to 57; Mexican, for money, 21j; for the account, 21i; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 78i and 78; Portuguese Three per Cents., 431 and 44; Sardinian Five per Cents., 89i and 88- * Dutch Two-and-aE alf per Cents., 64i ; and the Wour per Cent. Ce - ttI'cates, 98 and 98k.
The quotations from the Paris Boarse this evening again failed to arrive. Yesterday the closing prices of the Three per Cents. were 67f. 85c. for money, ancd 67f. 90c. for the end of the month, showing a preponderance of speculative sales, and a consequent reaction of three-eighths per cent.
The corn-market this morning was without alteration.
The Madrid steamer to-day has brought 30,01,1. from the Peninsula.
At the half-yearly meeting of the Colonial Bank, held to-day, Mr. C. Mlarryat presiding, the dividend declared was at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, and the report was unanimously adopted. It was stated that the progress of business is satisfactory, and that the profits for the six months are the largest realized since the establishment of the bank. The total of bad debts, hitherto estimated at 210,0001., has, on careful examination, been found I be 204,7681., leaving, after the appropriation of I 81,5481., the accumulated fund, a residue of only 23,2201. to be met. The directors express an opinion that they will shortly be in a position to annotuce a final extinction of this, and to recommend an increased dividend. A thorough investigation of the stock ledgers of the company has shown that the transfer department has been faithfully conducted. In answer to questions it was stated that the principle of granting cash credits has been discontinued, but that owing to one or two old accounts remaining open the item stiU appears in the assets. The expenditure for managernentin the colonies is large, properly qualHfied persons requirng ample remuneration. Annexed are the report and statement of the accounts:-
"The directors have much satisfaction in submitting to the proprietors the annexed statement, which, by an adherence to the prudent course hitherto pursued, will enable the directors to make a considerable addition to the fand to rmeet bad debts, and, should nothing unforeseen occur, they w)ll ere long have it in their power to announce the final extinction of old outstandings, and be in a position to .ecommend an increased dividend. Mleanwhile, the directors do not doubt that the proprietors will agree with them in their proposal that out of the profits of the half-year endieg on the 3Oth of June, 1S56, which, after making provisi(n for income-tax, and for current, bad, and doubtful debts, amount to ... £... ... ... ... 25,967 a dividend be mnade of 2, per cent. (being at the
sate of 5 per cent. per annum) on the paid-up
capital of the corporation, which wil require ... 12,500
Leaving £... ... ... 13,467 to be added to the fund for bad debts, whereby it will be increased to 181,5471. The directors consider the time has now arrived when they can comply with the wish of the proprietors that the half-yearly statement should show the balance of bad debts. Having thoroughly investigated those outstandings, they are happy to report that the loss which they have slwass hitherto estimated at 210,0001., 'will not exceed-.. .. ... ... ... ... 24,768 Firom wvhich deduct fund to meet bad debts, as
above-... .. .. . . .181,548
Leaves a balance of ... £23,220 In the next statement, consequently, that balance will sppear instead of the 'fund tomeetbad debts.' Thedireotors are glad to report further that the accounts of the half-year just ended, so far as they hsve been received from the branches, give every reason to expect that its result wiU be qu,ite equal to that of the corresponding period of 1855. It will doubtless be satisfactory to the proprietors to be informed that the directors, after a minute examination of the stock ledgers of the corporation, can state them to be perfectly correct and in order.

The comnmercial advices from New York this week describe an improvement in most descriptions of stocks, notwithstanding an increased pressure for money at the close of the year. Erie Railway was quoted 62 toJ : Reading, 86 to i; Panama, 98 to 99; New York Central, 93j to 94; illinois Central, 122: ; and Illinois Central Bonds, 97i.
A return oI the Sherry wines exported during the past year shows the quantity to bave been 54,611 butts, against 43,637 butts in 1855, and 52,746 butts in 1854. Of these 41,087 were sent to the united kingdom, 4,637 to Russia, 2,669 to the United States, 1,810 to Australia, and the remaining 4,408 to various other markets. The proportion from Xeres was 30,407 butts, and from Port St. Mary 24,204. At the former port the largest shippers were:-Gonzalez, Dubosc, and Co., 3,885 butts; Pemartin and Co., 3,239; P. Garvey, 3,144; P. Domecq, 3,033; S. de la Sierra, 2,536 ; M. Misa, 2,047; F. G. Cosens, 1,864; Paul and Dastis, 1,433; Ysasi and Co., 1,079; P. Beigbeder and Co., 1,013; and D. de Goni, 1,001. From the latter port the largest were :-J. G. Burdon, 3,507 butts; Duff Gordon and Co., 3,036; Mousley and Co., 2,154; Diaz, Moreilo, and Co., 2,056; Widow Harmony aud Co., 1,995; M. M. de Mora, 1,746; ' MI. and F. Tozar, 1,417; and Widow Portilla, 1,046. AR other shippers were under 1,000 butts each.
The subjoined statement of the export of bullion from London to the umdermentioned countries, during the six months ending December 31, 1856, has been prepared by Messrs. Haggard and Pixley:-
. During the entire year the total of specie shipped to the above countries reached 17,806,9401., against 24,224,6101. in 1855. These amounts do notinclude ihe large sums sent from the Mediterranean ports, wvhich comprised during the twelve months 3,7001. of gold and 2,025,4501. .ilver. Neither do they embrace the extraordinary amounts despatched vf
Folkestone and Dover to France, of which no aggregate records are obtainable.
* .lti5 understood that the Venezuelan Commissioners, who lately arrived in London to negotiate an arrangement of the debt of that country, feel themselves aggrieved at the representations madeyesterday by the Committee of Bondholders regard.. ing their mode of conducting the negotiation, and tiat theyintend immediatelz to publish a statement,
with the view of exonerating themselves from the charge of having evaded the terms originally assented to, and of showing that it was fromi an attempt of the committee to alter the terms that the disagreement between them arose.
A subscription, headed by Utasrs. Rothschild, Baring, and Gurney, has been opened to-day, for sthe family of Mr. Mortleman, who perished in tho mail steamship Violet, and who is aqcertained iQ the midst of his danger to have floated the mailbags, so that even af.er the loss of the vessel and all on board there might be a prospect of their recovery. They were picked up on the following morning, and much inconvenience to the commercial community was thus prevented.
According to the latest mtelligence in the city this evening, the Tyne Royal Mail steamer still remained on shore, but strong expectations were entertained of her being got off. As the company are their own insurers, any loss must be met by them from the fund set apart for that purpose.
The following statistics of the quantities of coal and iron imported at Boulogne from England during the past three years indicate the beneficial result that has already followed the partial relaxation qf the French tariff-.
The Customa' dues paid at Boulogne amounted to 110,3721. in 1854, 187,0121. in 1855, and 195,8901. in 1856. The figures for most of the other French Channel ports present proportional results.
The Challenger has arrived from Shanghai with a most valuable cargo of silk and tea.
The following correcta an erroneous statement in one of the trade reports of the last Mlelbourne papers:-
"Price's Patent Candle Company (Limited),
Belmont, Vauxhall, Jan. 13.
"Sir,-We ask the favour of being allowed to contradict in your columns a statement made in the Mfebourne Journua of Commerce, of the 11th of October last, which being be. lieved in London and Livrpool is injuring our busiuess. The statement complained of is to the effect that our company by large shipments of Belmont sperm candles on their own account have greatly depressed the market. We beg to say that this statement is entirely without foundation, as during the whole of last year we made but two shipments of Belmont sperm candles to Meolbourne (together only 12 tens), the last of which wfas made in April.

HULL, JAN-. 13.
After several days of mild weather, with frequent showers of rain, a6 sharp frost has again set in.
Arrvals from abroad are now limited, little rain having been received here since the beginning of the week, and the latest accunts from the Baltic state thatthe navigation tberc in now entirely closed. " The wheat trade during the wee (says Binney and Co's Oircuhr) has been steady, and prices have been wel maintained, but without
activity. We can make no alteration in quotations. The general sn pressIonamong holders aopears to be that pnces have for the Dresent reen the lowest, but buyers show no disposition to increase stokrs, and it remains to be seen what , ffxct the curtafiment of foreig auplie ill hare on the trade. As noticed in our late circulars, we consider the British farmer has not up to tbisperiod -lade an average delivery of wheat, Partly owing to the conditioisn, anrsatLy owing to the rein. tive high value of barley, which has been an inducement to britn the latter into the market in preference. We do not look for any material improvement in value, even If foreign supplies should be kept out for a time, as, with deliveries from growers and granaried stocka combined, quite sufficient wil be found to meet the consumptive demnand.

A XLWA Y INT.RLLIGENCZ.
LA.KcAsmxE AND YORim '
A special meeting of this company was held yesterday at Mlanchester, " to Jlecide upon a proposed arrangement between this company and the EAst lAncashire Ralway Com. pany for uniting and consolidating into one concern tho traffic and business of the two cornpanies."
Mtr. H. W. WicKnAr, M.P., Chairman of the board, said tho question of an amalgamation between the two corapanies had often been the subject of discussion at the boards of the two companies, and also among the shareholders, but the directors had never before been in a position to come before a meeting like tbis, and formally ask the consent of the sbareholders. The question naturally resolved itself into three parts-fSst, the desirability of an amalgamation at all; secondly, the time at which, if desirable, it sbould take place; and, thirdly, the terms upon which it should take place. As to the first, almost every shareholder present probably knew that the two lines met at almost every large town in the neighbour. hood, competing for traffic, and supporting two separate staffs of servants. An amalgamation would put an end to these evils, lessenin very rcaterially the expense of working the two lines, wnile the public would be equally wel served by the arrangement. As to the second question, he thought this was the best time, because with the East Lancashire they had already certain traffic arrangements, the term of which must soon expire, exposing the companies to tbo old difficulties of fighting for trafric, to the great sacrifico of rates and the consequent reduction of dividends. Then, as to terms, it would be remembered that so long ago as 1852, and again in 1854, the project of an analgamation was almost agreed to, by which the companies were to unite upon nearly equal terms It was true that the publin had or late set a higher value upon the stock of this company than upon that of the East Lancashire; but the true criterion of value was not the price in the market, but their relative position as to traffic and dividend. N ow, he found that the ratio of increase of dividend in the Lancashire and Yorkshire had been 83, while on the East Lancashire it had been 84; and any one who had watched the traffic of the two lines during the last half-year would see that the progress of the two lines ws pretty much the same. le thought, under these circumstances, that they couldnot propose any terms of amalgamation on either side that were not equal in all respects. He concluded by moving a rezolutieo to tho effect that the meeting approve of the union into one concern of the traffic and business, and the amalgamation into one undertaking of the two companies, on perfebtly equalterms as regazded every class of share-
ol ers, the two lines to be under the management of a joint board, consisting of 18 Lancashire and Yorkshire directors and eight East Lancashire directors, until the expiration of three years from the obtaining of an act for the amalgamation, when the number of directors from the East Lancashire beard should be reduced to six, unless that reduction should have previously been attained by deaths or otherwise; and that application be made to Parliament for an act to carry out the proposed amaigamation.
Mr. STUART, Vice-Chairman of tho board, seconded the motion, because he thought it would bring peace into the district. He did not know whether it would benefit the East Lancashire more than this company, as some thought but lie was sure that mutual advantage would arise fronthe amalgamation, and should bo sorry to see any obstacle thrown in its way.
Mr. BOBLBTS thought an amalgamation on equal terms was unust, because a glance at the Stock-Exchango lists would siow that there was a striking difference in value. It was true the East Lancashire had increased in value since this amalgamation was talked of, but that only proved that in public estimation this was the better property, and that the amalgamation was a benefUt to the East Lancashire more than to this company. If the union had been equally advantageous the price of the two stocks ought to have risen equally. He also obeected to such an extensive board, as lessening the responsibility of individual members of it.
The CwAMIMA N said every director was impressed with the desrability of the amalgamation; the only division ab the board was as to the terms.
Mfr. ROBERTS said that was just the point whero he dissented. He was in favokr of the amalgamation, but not on equal terms.
Mr. P. ftoumn said he was In favour of an amalgama. tion, but he thought the basis of it should have been to take the average prices of each stock in the market for six months. fle thought no amalgamation could be fair or equal which had the effect of raising one stock in the market 131., while it depressed the other (tho Lancashire and Yorkshire) 51.; for he could inot but think that but for this proposal their stock would now be worth 1001. He believed an amalgamation would add 1 per cent. to the dividend of each company, and therefore it would be desirable - but he thought they should unite upon fair terms. He understood their dividend this half-year would bo 5 per cent., unless interfered with by the malgapmation.
The CRAIss..t said the amalgamation would not be in force so as to affect the next dividend. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. W. ENTWISLE said, though he should probably be in a minority of one, he must oppose this amalgamation. because they were not in possession of the terms, which he thought should have been fully stated to the proprietors He moved as an amendment that the meeting be adjourned for six weeks in order to take a final vote upon the question, believing that itwould be advantageous, by giving the shareholders time to acquire a better knowledge as to the justice of the terms on which it was to take placo.
Mr. ROBERTs seconded the motion.
The CRAIRNUL&N in answer to some of the questions raised, said it might be as well to state that since 1852 the traffic of this company had increased 30 per cent., while that of the East Lancashire line hid increased 36 per cent. (Hear, hear.) With regard to dividend, he had a letter from Mr. lJugdale, chairmaan of the East Lancashire, stating that their dividend would probably be 41 or 5 per cent. at the forthcoming half-yearly meeting.
Mr. W. RV5V0oN did not thinik the East Lancashire could fairly claim to amalgamate on equal terms, but he was sure t ey would not agree to any other. He thought the principal thing was to know how much the united oompames could save by the amalgamation. If they were going to keep up two staffs the saving would be little. The question was whether they would save more by reduction of expenses than they would lose by taking the East Lancashire on equal terms. SHear, hear.)
Mr. VASCE was glad to see that the shareholders in this company were not so apathetic as to enter into such arrangements as the one proposed without more circumsection than was usually exhibited by railway proprietors. The experienco of amalgamations and exteDsions had too often proved extremely disastrous, but he believed that in the present case the systems of the East Lancashire and lancashire and Yorkshire were so intimately connected that the poIicy of, an amalgamation could not be doubted. The only question w as to th terms on
ich such union should take place. He beieved it wasnot by taking the market price of different stocks that the relative intrnsi values of the respective properties conld be ascertaied, as it would be seen, by a comparison of the divdends paid in each case, that the mode of computation suggested was not alwvays reliable. He submitted hat the questionbefore the meeting could not be aomned with any advantage, because the EXat Lancashire project for a lne from Caine to Bradford would in the meantime proceed, and for ever put an end to an amicable settlement, which he believed would in another year add I per cent. to the value of both the undertaldkgs concerned. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. HZYWOiTH, iM., deprecated all idea of " makin
a good bargain" with the other company, because the rcal object of an amalgamation was to avoid what he felt justified in terming the fearful consequences of competition.
BBOADDENT was favourable to an amalgamation, provided the terms were favourable. He understood, however, that the directors were not united in recommead.
EAM B iES, M.P. (a director), explained that a very decided majority of the directors were strongly in favour of an amalgamation on equal terms, and a minority were at first somewhat undecided, wishing, however, for an amalgamation, on the best terms that could be obtained, not exceeding those of equality. He was himself a decided advocate of amalgamation on equal terms, becanse, even assuming, which he was not prepared to admit, that the East Lancashire was , per cent. inferior in value to this concern, the apparent concession would be amply compensated by the saving of expense and avoidance of competition; and competition was much to be feared when the
resent traffic agreement expired, as the East Lancashire gempany were naot satisfied with their existing proportion of receipts divided; and moreover, the estimated S per cent. return on the 800,0001. to be expended by that company for their new Bradford line could only be arrived at by supposing a traffic of about 80,0001. a-year, a great proportion of which would be abstracted from this company. The Lancashire and Yorkshire would be forced into measures of reprisal, and the present proposal was therefore, in fact, an anticipatory treaty of peace. He wished the shareholders to decide at once whether peace or war was to be their policy. (Applaus-)
Mr. HL fouLrswoRTHf thought this company should not hesitate, even bya sacrifice of , per cent., to secare their expected dividend of 5 per cent. and upwards from the liability to curtailment, and he was therefore prepared to suport the proposition of the directors. %plause.)
as. viADFeLD, y LP., also supported the motion. It was evidentlya ling pgame to on competing and the possible .4 per cent. difference w ich had )een ailuded to would, in faCt, be distributed over the 13,000,0001. of Lancashire and Yortshire capitaL, added the 4,o0o,0001. of East Lancashire, being only, on the whole, the diminutive asmount of 2s. percent.,or thereabouts, (Cheers.)
MEr. EIAIGII, of Bradford, said he represented nine-tenths of the commercial interest of Bradford, in opposing the mnonopoly which wvould be created by the proposed amalgamation. ("Hear, hear." and laurhter.l
The CILUI5t,&- having given Enr. itwisle the etatistics of the Liverpool and Crosby working, the amendment was put and lost, being supported only by nine or ten hands; the original motion was carried unanimously.
The meeting then separated.
MANCHESTER, SHEFFIELD, AND LINCOLNSHIRn,
The half-yearly report of the directors of this company states that the revenue for the half-year amounted to 288,9081. and the expenditure to 137,O91,, leaving a balance of lol,2981., which, with tho balance brought from the previous half-year, gives a total sum of 153,3461. available for interest and dividend. The debenture and other charges against the half-year amount to 59,8011., the canal annuities to 13,7341, the dividend on the 61. preference shares to 23,6901, thedividend on the 31 per cent. stock to 5 958

In order to develope the trade of Grimsby the directors have founT it necessry to arrange for an extension of shed accommaoda

There was an increase in the tonnage of three of the comnpany's canals of 23,960 tons, but a falling off on the Ashton tanal, aring from the ttrn-out at the local collieries. The working expense show a net decrease of 2,7691., as compared with the corresponding perod of 1855 DThe e n- diture on the repaurs and renewals of the won r a iton

The Life And Correspondence Of Sir John Malcolm, G.C.B.*
'TE LIFE AND CORRBSPONDBNOE OF
SIB JOHN MALCOLM, G.C.B.*
.b-
(Concladed from 1h Times of Janua&7 10.)
!Xt the beginninc of the year 1812 M'alcolm resl ned on leave to hngland. He had been married . -nie years, and, having acquired a competent fortue, entertained some idea of settlingdown asa counI ry gentleman, diversifying his agricultural pursuits swith literature, to which he was always much at*tached. In 181a he published his History of Persia. tie was not unknown as an author, as his work on the Political History of India had been out for some j ears, and had been well received by those who took in interest in our eastern polities; but the History f Persia commanded a wider circle of readers; xiula statesmen and poets vied with each other in their praises of a work which, from the romantic *ieas associated with the country of which it spoke, *i.icrded almost equal food for both classes.
In the spring of the year 1815 he received the Corder of the Bath ; and when the battle of Waterh o drew all the world to Paris he gladly accepted I ie " Duke's " invitation to pay him a visit in that capital; and the diary of his visit contains many jnteresting anecdotes which we do not remember to l:ave met vwith before. We get from it the Duke's oNin simple description of his great and final victory. " It was hard pounding on both sides, .a:Lve pounded the hardest." (ii., 101.) We -fDdn a eharacteristic story of our great commander's imperturbable coolness on witnessing the :light (for it was nothing less) of the Belgians, Mhich elicited from him the simple comment" Voila des coquins avec qui il faut gagner nune bataille." And we meet also with a singular :proof of the very early period at which the friends of the Orleans branch of the Boyal family brad begun to intrigue against the elder Bourbons. " I told him," says Malcolm," they had abused him nnore for giving Fouche a dinner. . . . . If I had not settled with FouchM when I did," he said, -' the Duke of Orleans would have been proclaimed King next day, and that would have been a new troubile." (108.) But the most singular statement contained in this part of the book is that " it was proposed, as the army was advancing, to offer the 'Crown of France to the Duke of Wellington. This extraordinary proposition was not only made, but -discussed for some time." (p. 113.) If Sir John's informant did not deceive him, a very extraordinary pioposition it certainly was. One would be curious to know who was crazy enough to make it, who was 'weak enough to diseuss it; but we can be at no loss to conjecture who rejectedit ; that the project a-hGuld have been entertained, or even the report of it believed for one moment, is among the most reenarkable proofs with which we have ever met of the complete and universal confusion of things, ideas, and principles which had been, or which was believed to have been, wrought in France by the terrible agency of the first revolution.
The next year Malcolm returned to India. He alrived at Madras at a critical time, when Lord Hastings was preparing for his war against the Pindarrees, and contemplating the probability of its involving him also in hostilities with the chiefs -of the different branches of the Mahratta empire. 'I he Pindarrees were bands of eavalry living mainly ecn plunder, and in time of war offering their serv ices to the piincipal Mahratta chieftains, especialy *qcindiah and Holkar, to whose connivance they -owed their rapid increase in numbers, and on whose protection they were with reason supposed to rely. The MIabrattas themselves were in many respects not much better. Over a great portion of what was called their dominions they neither exercised nor desired any authority beyond the exaction of revenue, to which they had established their claimn by a system of black mail which they had gradually extended over the greater part of the Deccan. When they had marked out a district for their prey they appeared with a sufficient body of troops upon its borders, and, pointing out the damage which it was in their power to inflict, they demanded a large sum, generally the utmost that it seemed possible to extort, as the price of their for"bearance, and the repetition of this demand for a fe' years entitled them, in their own opinion and practice, to call the district thus despoiled their -dominion and the sums thus exacted their lawful revenue.
33efore the commencement of the war Malcolm shad abundant occupation in his diplomatic capacity, travellinog from court to court of the different native 1'inces who were connected with us by alliances; arranging for the assistance of the Mysore cavalry, -and of some of the battalions of the Nizam, though not, as we may suppose, for that of the female Eepoys whom that Prince kept in his pay. No man could possibly have been better suited for the tasic allotted to him. A rule which he often laid down for his subordinate officers, " to keep every one in good humour," was always present to his own recollection ; so lie flattered dancing girls, gossipped 'with palanquin bearers, and joked with Mlinisters, tUll he carried every point which he had at heart, 'while those whom lie had persuaded scarcely felt that they had ceded their original opinions, or -abandoned their more deliberate intentions. He -failed with the Peishwah, or Prince of Poonah, Badjee Rao, not that the latter abstained, while Mal*colm was with him, fr m making friendly promises, but the weakness of his character was such that -when Mlalcolm had departed he was incapable of adiheiing even to that line of conduct which he saw -to be the best for his own welfare; and the youthful Rajah of Berar, though at first equally profuse of -assurances of friendship, proved equally unstable, and, forgetting the defeat which his uncle had received at Assaye, was easily led by bad advisers -to distrust onr friendship rather than to rely on -our protection, and from this distrust at last to ranxe hhimself among the ranks of our enemies.
ltr. Kaye blames the distrustful suspicion with which the native princes regarded the policy of -our Indian rulers as a national weakness to Mwhich their wars and consequent subjugation 'were in general owing ; but while we can hardly agree that it was unnatural on the part of those -who werc eye-witnesses of the rapid strides that our dominion had made since Clive first raised the shout of victory on the plains of Plassy, there is abundant proof that in this instance it was particularly well-founded, for, not only was the probability of a war with the Mahrattas the common subject of conversation at all the Presidencies, even while MIalcolm was negotiating amicably with the different chieftains, but it was looked forward to with such eager hope that when Lord Hastings annotuiced to the army that Scindiah had signed a treaty which seemed to render such an event impro'bable, he actually condoled with the troops on the ilisappointnient that "the diminished prospect of serious exertion" must have caused them, nor could his well turned phrases about equity and moderation conceal the fact that he himself, as well as his officers, conceived it more for the British interests to have an excuse for what 12 years before Malcohnl had called without disguise "destroying Scindiah and Ilolkar" (i., 317).
After all, the first hostile measures came from the Peishwah, who attacked the Residency, and -destroyed much of the property belonging to Mr. Elphinstone and others of the English, but who ieceived a severe defeat at Kirkee from Celonel Burr, which rendered us safe on that side for sorae timc. In the meantime Malcolm, who had teen appointed Brigadier-General at the head of one division of the army, was engaged in a fruitless pursuit of Cheetoo, the most enterprising of the Pindarree leaders; but, as soon as he ascertained that it was impossible for him to overtake him, he turned back to join the main army, under the
tonunaurter.inciief, Sir Thomas Hislop, who was marching towards Holkar's army, which was encamped under the walls of Mehidpoor, a strong town on the river Sepree. Holkar himself was only a boy, and his affairs were nominally managed by Toolrah Bhye, his father's favourite wife, who, however, -was at variance with his Generals, who suspected Toolsah, with good grounds, of preferring an alliance with the English to an uniohi with the rest of the Mahrattas. So they put her to death and prepared for battle. They took up a formidable position with the river in their front; the attack of which, at.s own request, was intrusted to Malcolm, <and was completely successfuL The victory was obtained more by fearless gallantry than by military skill; but it was complete, and Molkar had no alternative but to sue for peace, 'e settlement of which was a3 usual left to Mal-cohm. Mr. Kaye claims for him the praise of great moderation, and assures us that "thepareere sukiectis maxim was never absent from his gind"' We should hardly have guessed it from his conduct to the young Rajah, w ho was s tripped of the greater
* The iVfe and Cor,esondence of Sir John Malcolm G.C.B., by J. W. KLye, Eq.; 2 vols., 8vo. Siith, Elder, aid Co., London. 18D7.
portion of his territories; his revenues and his power were greatly reduced, and the British force which was promised him tO protect the rest of his dominions from any future attacks of enemies whom his now disabled condition tnight invite was not calculated to be a very pleasant sight to one whowae just smarting so severely from their prowess. Yet so thorough wao Malcolm's understanding of the native character, and so great the ascendancy that he acquired over all who came in contact with him, that he soon attached the young Rajah to himE elf as much as if he had been his benefactor, instead of his conqueror; gave him a pony, and took him out hunting, till the boy looked upon him as his best friend, and " expressed grief at his going away, as he was very fond of play and hunting."
It was not long before the Peishwah, who had fled from Poonah after Burr's victory, began also to think of submission, and to send envoys to Malcolm, but they could procure no favourable conditions. However severe the decision of the British statesman was, there can be no doubt that, as far as the tranquility of our Indian dominions was concerned, he Judged rightly in determining to leave the suppliant Prince no alternative, but to comnpel him " to throw himself on the protection of the British Government, and finish the war by the surrender at once of his person and dominions." And in the prosecution of this object he showed as much military skill as diplomatic firmness. While discussing the Peishwah's affairs with his envoys he made such a disposition of his troops as rendered it impossible for him to escape, and at last that Prince consented to place himself and all his power at Malcolm's mercy. But, though we, perhaps, ought not to condemn the relentless rigour with which Malcolm insisted on the terms which he imposed on the fallen Prince, we confess that,
aiter making all due allowance for a biographer's I partiality, we are surprised at the implied approbation with which Mr. Kaye quotes Sir John's address to him, complimenting him on the hereditary courage of his tribe, contrasting his fate with the more terrible one of widows who " have burnt on the funeral piles of their husbands," or of men who '" have thrown themselves from precipices to propitiate the deity," while "the sacrifice demanded from him was, in fact, o7ly the resignation " of his power, his independence, and his country. It is hard to see how such an harangue could have been felt otherwise than as an insult, or how the Peishwah could have been expected to feel very grateful for what was offered him in return -" a safe asyluni and a liberal provision for himself and such of the most respectable of his adherents as had been involved in his ruin." (ii., 245.) It gives us a far more agreeable picture of the kind-hearted affectionate amiability of the man to turn to a letter which, amid all the trouble of his negotiations, he wrote to his wife in England on hearing of the illness of one of his children. " IRow completely," says the man so fearless for himself, so pitiless to his fallen eiiemies, " do such communications awaken me from every dream of ambition, to tell me whom all my happiness is treasured up in-you and my little ones. The thought of one of you ailing makes me unhappy. I cannot bear to contemplate any reverse in this fortunate part of my condition. I have been spoilt by everything hitherto going to my wish. I am become unreasonable, and expect more than God gives us; but this
I cannot help. I pass days of toil and anxiety; I I am almost weary of my existence. But I retire at night, and, when alone, build castles, every room of which is inhabited by you and my children, and am happy." (ii., 243.)
Yet, severe as were the conditions which Malcolm had imposed upon the Peishwah, they were too liberal to meet the approbation of his employers. He had granted him an annuity ef eight lacsof rupees,-about 80,0001. a-year, and both the directors and the Governor-General thought the pension excessive. We cannot agree in this view of the case, and rest our opinion, not on the fa .t which Malcolm urged in his defence, that when he made the arrangement the Peishwah had still the means of greatly protracting the war, so that it was cheaper to pension hin than to fight him; nor on the precedents which existed for evea larger grants; but on the broader principles of iustice and general policy. The whole history of our I,ndhan empire had given but too much colour to the assertion often made, and quoted by the Duke of Wellington in one of his letters to Malcolm, that " the moderation of England was not unlike the ambition of other nations." And though it may be truly urged inour defence that most of our wars and conquests have been forced on us by circumstances, yet certainly justice required that those whom, with their descendants, we had stripped of rank, independence, power, and revenue, should at least be secured an ample provision for their own lives ; and as surely did general policy dictate that the principle of so dealing with all our enemies, and especially with those who spared us the necessity of expensive wars by voluntary submission, was not only the most humane and equitable course, but that recommended by the soundest wisdom and the most real economy.
Malcolm had now ample occupation for many months in restoring tranquillity and order to the provinces which had been the seat of war, and which had been annexed to the doriinions of the Company; and he executed his task with consummate tact and with complete success. One of the great secrets of his success was that he did not expect too much; he was " very tolerant of abuses, and could wait with patience to see them die their natural death" (277); and his practical wisdom so completely conciliated aU parties and all ranks that when, on the anniversary of Assaye, he gave a party to celebrate his old friend's first victory, the Pariahs at head-quarters gave one also in honour of the same event; and when the arrack, which flowed in abundance, had led to such a tumult that Malcolm sallied out to see what was the matter, one of the soberest of the party sought to propitiate him by a statement of their conduct which many in the great conqueror's native island would, 30 years ago, have thought the most becoming compliment to pay him. " We all get drunk for Wellington name."-(ii., 279.)
The next year, at the beginning of 1819, he received a still more singular proof of the regard in which he was held by the natives even of hostile tribes. He had conducted the main operations of the siege of Asseerghur with such vigour that Jeswunt Rao Lar, the commander, was soon forced to surrender; and when the fort capitulated he actually found that Jesawunt had ordered his artillerymen to avoid firing wherever they saw a piebald horse (piebald being the well-known colour of Malcolm's charger at the time), and the gunners had gladly obeyed hime, since " all thought that the evil day might come, and that they should have no friend in India so likely to serve them as himselE" (ii., 295), and his poDularity was not only universal, but durable. Sorine years later Bishop Heber found no one so gratefully recollected or mentioned with such deep respect; his name pronounced three times by a priest was accounted a sovereign cure for a fever, and the Bishop saw an amulet worn by a native child with nothing more than the word Malcolm engraved on it, "w hich was considered in that part of the country the most efficacious of charms." (ii., 318.)
His services were not so well appreciated in England. He had hoped for the Government of Bombay, and Mr. Canning, the President of the Board of Control, had shown himself favourable to his claims; 'but his policy had been too expensive, andhehimself too high-minded and independent
to win the favour of the Court of Directors; and under the pretence that the Governors of the Presidencies ought to be civilians they gave the desired appointment to Mr. Mountrtuart Elphinstone, a man of undoubted ability, but younger, and notdistinguished by such very eminent services as those of Malcolm. And then, to sbow the falsehood of the reason they had alleged, they conferred the Presidency of Madras upon Colonel Munro, certainlv a most distinguished servant of the Company, but laoouring under the infirmities of deafness and impaired eyesight, which ought to have been a disqualification for so inportant a post. It is a pleasing proof of Malcolm's generous nature that his disappointment and indignation, for he felt thathe had been treated with greatinjustice in beino,
thus passed over, never led him to utter one 'word in disparagement of those who were thus preferred to him, nor in the least diminished the cordial regard which he constantly entertained for them.
He received some consolation for his disappointment in the Grand Cross of the Bath, which was sent to him from England, and of which he had long been particularly ambitious, and in 1821 he returned to England, became the tenant of a small estate called Hyde-hall, in Hertfordshire, and began to contemplate passing the rest of his life as a
country gentleman, divenifying his "talk about oxen"' by intercourse with some of the men most eminent for science and liteature, who all held him in high esteem. In 1824 he was again disappointed in his endeavour to obtain the Government of Madras. But at last, in the beginning of 3827, both Ministers and directors agreed in offering him the longdesired Government of Bombay, the new GovernorGeneral being Lord W. Bentinck, with whom he had long been on terms of friendship, and with whoseviews he was prepared cheerfully to co-operate; though in some respects they must have been greatly at variance with his inclinations, as they pointed to a large economnical reform, which could only be carried out by a reduction of the emoluments of the officers of the Government and of other expenses in respect of wiich Malcolm was naturally disposed to be liberal, if not lavish. His own share of the work, however, he accomplished with less dissatisfaction on the pals of those who suffered from the reductions than he had expected, and he began to anticipate a period of tranquillity which might enable hini to devote his atttntion to the general amelioration of the condition of the country, when his hoDes were disturbed by the encroachments which the judges of the Supreme Court endeavoured to make upon the authority of the Government, seeking to extend their jurisdiction over the whole Presidency. Nearly 50 years before a similar attempt had been made in Bengal, when the powersof the Government were so loosely defined that Warren Hastings was forced to bribe Impey into a surrender of his pretensions; but now, though there was still a want of clearness in the manner in which the powers of the Supreme Court had been defined, there was not the same danger in meeting its claims with direct opposition. The judges issued writs to be executed in remote districts; Malcolm forbade any returns to be made to them. They issued an attachment against those who had disobeyed the orders of his Court, and, when Malcolm again prohibited its execution, closed the court. The decision of the Supreme Court at Calcutta soon arrived; it was unanimous in favour of Malcolm's views, it was confirmed by the Privy Council in England, and Malcolm showed the kindness and generosity of his character by making the first overtures for a reconciliation with the offended and defeated judge. He now applied himself diligently to the development of the resources of the province, visiting every part of it, encouraging the development of its resources, and the extension of the means of communication between the different districts; and finding that there was no chance of his hopes of having Central India committed to his charge being realized, he returned to England at the end of 1830, leaving, his Presidency in a state of complete tranquillity, and of consequently increasing prosperity, which was so universally felt to be owing to his judicious sway that the inhabitants paid him the unprecedented compliment of erecting a statue in his honour, appropriately placed in the Town-haU of Bombay.
He reached England at the time when the whole country was agitated by the question of Reform. The Duke of Northumberland gave him an entrance into Parliament as member for Launceston, and he plunged as eagerly into English as he had ever done into Indian politics. His original prepossessions and his friendship for the Duke of Wellington both tended to make him hostile to the Reform Bill, in which he believed that the interests of India were in some degree concerned, since the close boroughs, which it was proposed to abolish, afforded an opening into Parliament to those interested in India and the colonies, which he thought they would not be able otherwise to procure. To remedy this grievanee he himself proposed, in the course of the discussion, that the proprietors of India Stock should form a constituency to return four members, but his arguments in favour of his project were ingenious rather than practical, and failed to influence either the Ministers or the House. The passing of the bill deprived him of his seat for Launceston, and, being disappointed in obtaining one at either Dumfries or Carlisle, he retired to a small place at Warfield, in Windsor Forest, which he had purchased, and began to occupy himself with the improvement of his estate and the composition of a Life of Lord 0live, to aid in which Lord Powys had supplied him with al the papers in the possession of the family of our first great Indian hero. But this task, which was in everv respect a labour of love, he was not destined to comrplete. In the spring of 1833 he had a severe attack of influenza, and befoie he had recovered from its effects he was, almost unavoidably, involved in business of a most laborious character, in consequence of the negotiations going on between the Goveranent and the Company with respect to the renewal of the charter. When the Company had made the best terms they could, he himself undertook to move the resolutions in the Court of Proprietors necessary to empower the directors to accept the new charter on the terms proposed. Of thoseterms this is hardly the place to discuss the justice or the policy; but we may say briefly, that while the abolition of the Company's commercial privileges was amply conmpensated to the proprietors by the annuity secured to them on the territory of India, it has been, even if we only regard its effect in cheapening an article of such general consumption as tea, a most important benefit to the whole kingdom. And that the authority of the Company for all the pLurposes of government has been in no degree impaired by any of the regulations then enacted is amply proved by the steady improvement that has taken place ever since in the prosperity of the vast empire which it enjoys; by the vigour with which it has extended its sway by further conquest, by the elasticity with which it has recovered from disaster, and by the advance in all the arts of civilization and peace under the sagacious and beneficent rule of its late Governor.
But tne exertion which the debates in the Court of Proprietors imposed upon Malcolmn proved too much for his constitution; within a week after his last speech in the court he was attacked by paralysis, from which he never rallied, and on the 30th of May he died at the age of 64.
From what has been said it is plain that Sir John Malcolm was an eminently useful public servant. During a long career-for he was engaged in importantemployments for nearly30 years-heacquired and retained the uniformly favourable opinion of all his superiors, except Sir G. Barlow; and, more than any one who has ever been in the East, conciliatedthe goodwill of the natives of every classnot only of the poor man whom he encouraged and protected, but even of the Minister whose cunning or whose avarice he baffled, and of the Princes themselves whom he defeated and deposed; while in England his counsels were listened to with respect by statesmen, and his acquaintance was sought by some of the men most eminent for their attainments in science and literature in their day. His onfly failure was in the case of the Madras mutiny, where it may be alleged in his behalf that he was not allowed to carry out his measures to their completion; in every other instance he was successfal. As a diplomatist he invariably carried his point in Persia and in India; as a Governor of a province he administered affairs with consummate prudence and farsighted benevolence, reforming abuses with a gtntle but resolute hand, and conducting himself in a very critical dispute with an admirable mixture
oI nrnmess andgood temper. As a General he gained the only battle in which he had a command; as a historian he has left behind him more than one work which, though perhaps not of the highest order of literary merit, is stil referred to as the standard authority on the subject of which it treAts.
Never having been, except during the brief period of his government of Bombay, placed in a situation of independent authority, he had not the opportunities of acquiring glory that fell to the lot of governors-general and commanders-in-chief, but, in his comparatively subordinate situation no one ever had such varied services allotted to him, or ever performed them better. If the events of his life do not authorize us to place him in the first rank of great men, we can have no hesitation in at least awarding him a foremost place in the second.

THE LATE 3URDER nr CARLOW.
The correspondent of Saunders' Newslete,r supplies the following particulars of the murder which was perpetrated m Carlow on Saturday night last *-
" CARLOW, Jan. I8.-In the short electric telegraphic message which I sent you last night of course I was unable to give the particulas of the awfvul tragedy which has been enacted in this county. From the facts .which have been brought to light at the inqtLest it appears that a farmer named Dyce was transacting some business in Tullow on last Satuday, after which he proceeded home in a cart in company with his brother-m-law, Michael Kealey. When they arrived at Tankardstown Dyce alighted opposite the house of a farmer named Mt'Lean, with the avowed purpose of lighting his pipe. The door of the dwellit being closed he gave several knocks, whereupon hI ean's wbfe inqured who was there. The deceased stated bis objectin seeking admission, which was denied him. Having been repulsed he madeuse of some rude observations towards the woman, and then pursued his wy. MLeana wife, as it was elicited, was a person of questionable character, felt indignant at the remarks and went into an adjoining field for the purposo of stating her grievanco to her husband. The circumstance, it would appear, aroused the worst passions of the man, as he caUed on his brother to accompany him for the purpose of avenging the insult. Both parties hastened in pursuit of the unfortunate deceased, Suring which time they armed themselves with dreadful weapons. Having pursued Dyce for about a mile acrossthe fields, they suddenly pounced upon him and his companion by leaping over a ditch and bla uringthem with the heavy stickstheyhad provided,themselves with. The *ttacked, lhaving no means of defendinf themselves, were soon overpowered and dreadfuly mangled and injured by their assalants; poor Dyce only survived a few hours, but Kealey was more fortunate, having escaped with a broken head and anm and several of his ribs severely injured. The jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against the M'Leans, and the coroner issued his warrant for their apprehension. They have left the country, but the police are on their track."
SUICIDE BY STRYCHSNIE.
Mr. J. E. Hyndman held an inauest yesterday in Coffey's Hotel on the body of a gentleman named St. George, who was found dead in his bedroom that morning. A large quantity of strychnine was found in the room occupied by the deceased. After the examination of several witnesses the jury returned a verdict that the deceased committed suicide while labouring under temporary insanity.
NEV POSTAL ARRANGEMENTS.
It is stated that early in this season the mails for the south of Irelaud will be despatched direct for Milford, in South Wales, to Waterford, instead of passing through Dublin as at present. In the course of a few weeks all the receiving houses in Dublin will be abolished, with the exception of six, which will be confined to the registering of letters and the issuing of money orders. Iron pillar-receivers, as in London, are to be substituted for the abolished offices.

Ministerial Changes At Sydney.
MZNISTEpwA CHANGES AT SYDNEY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-My absence from home has prevented me from taking immediate notice of the veryunfair manner in which your Melbourne correspondent has spoken of my brother, nr. Stuart Donaldson. Having been in constant communication with my relative, I may claim to be better informed in regard to his motives than this writer, who does not pretend to have any personal acquaintance with him. It would be impossible to employ expressions more inapplicable to MIr. Donaldson, as a publc man, than those which yoar correspondent has permitted himself to use. "A-dministra. tive pusillanimity" and " political cowardice and fastidiousness" are just the qnalities which even his opponents would least of aU recognize in him. If he is distinguished by any prominent characteristics, he is certainly marked by the buoyancy of his spirits and by an unwavering resolution, which no circumstances can daunt or discourage. And it is hard that his consicuous unselfishness, independence, and integrity should be stigmatized hy an iteration of phrases both offensive in themselves and inconsistent with the facts of the case. His resignation, in the propriety of which all his colleagues concurred, was occasioned solely by his conviction that, with a majority which the casual absence of two or three of his supporters might at any time convert into a minority, he could not serve the colony as he wished to do, in the face of an opposition who have proved that they were anxious to obtain office by any means, and wiHling to accept it on any conditions. The Ministerial changes are very aimply eI
plained. The Donaldson Administration resigned because they could not go on with a miserable majority of two or three. The Cowper Ministry were turned out by a vote of censure, without having had any majority from the very beginning. )tMr. Hay, who moved the vote of censure, was first commisoned to form a Ministry, but failed. The Governor then sent for Mr. Watson Parker, an independent member of very conciliatory character, who undertook avowedly Ito attempt to forma combination or coalition Ministry." In his speech to his constituents, which I find in the ByLdneq Herald, MIr. Parker thus describes his mnode of action :-M My course was to request Dr. Hay to proceed to MIr. Donaldson, when I went to Mr. Cowper. I pro. ceeded myself to Mr. Cowper, because I thought that Lentleman might imagine that he was least identifed with my feelings; and having explained to him the object of my mission he (Mr. Cowper) told me that he knew of no difference between us that would prevent him from joining my Administration, and that he thought he could work with me to the world's end; but that be was afraid to leave his party; and therefore (after some hesitation) he afterwards told me that he could not join me. That was my first effort. I immediately sought Mr. Hay, and found that the result of his commumcation with Mr. Donaldson was of a very difrerent charaoter. Mr. Donaldson, whose conduct, I consider, reflects upon him the highest honour, not only consented-having been Premier himself-to take office under me, but also to waive his political differences with Mr. Cowper and to join with that gentleman, if Mr. Cowper would join with me. If he had done so we might have formed a united and concentrated Administration that, I am confident, would have carried on the business of the country satisfactorily. I say the course taken by Mr. Donaldson redounds to his everlasting credit. I should have been exceedingly glad if Mr. Cowper had taken the same course."
To this explanation I will only add that my brother's circumstances are notoriously such as to make the emolu. ments of office a matter of perfect indifference to him, As to his ' playing second fiddle as Finance hMiister"-an office or w hc his mercantile experience has sDecially qualified him-I cannot think it at all derogatory to him to hold this place in a Atministry in which Mr. beas Thompson, -who was chief Minister under the old system, also has a seat, and in which the third office is filled by 3Mr. Hay, who had been himself commissioned to form a Cabinet before Mr. Parker was sent for. If this disinterested magnanimity istobs censured Lord John Russell did not deserve the praises bestowed upon him for consenting to work under Lord
berdeern and Lord Palmerston, and the Duke of Wellington forgot what was due to himself when he took a seat in Sir Robert Peel's Administration.
The prominence which you have given to your correspondent's letter in your paper of the 8th and the leading
cle of yesterday have invested these antipodean politics with a general interest which they would not otherwse possess; and I feel myself bound, under these circumsnces, to endeavour to conect the nnfavourable ipression which your correspondlenfs remarks are calculated to
son is a stranger. r Dnl
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant.

The Frauds On The City Banks.
I THE FRAUDS ON THE CITY BANKS.
-~~~~~--- - -- l .
Saward and Andersob, charged with having comruittid x great number of forgeries, were brought before the Lord Xayor at the Mansion-house yesterday for ftrther examina. tion.
Mr. Mulleng, the Uolicitor to the Committeo of Bankers for Protection against Forgeries and Frauds, attended for the prosecution, and Mr. Henry James, barrister, appeared for Saward. Anderson was undefended. The public curiosity on the sublect appeared to have undergone DO diminution.
After an arrangement had been made, upon the application of the learned counsd for Saward, s to the cross-examination of Atwell and Hardwick, who had been at the commencement of the proceedings ewimined for the prosecution,
Mr. Mullens proceeded at once to call witnesses to corroborate the evidence given by the approvers.
Mr. Joseph Bolton Doe, ironfonnder of Osborne-street, Whitechapel, said, I keep an account with Barclay and Co., the bankers in Lombard-street. A few days before Christ. mas, 1855, my premises were entered-on the night of the 21st or the morning of the 22d of December. I had in the premises an iron chest, which was blown in by gunpowder or gun cotton, and afterwards burst open with instruments. I rissed some checks which had been paid at my banker's and returned to me. Two blank checks had been taken from my cheek-book. I have got their counterfoils, which are numbered 9,281 and 9,303, the one being for 461. 15s. 6d. and the other for 951. 17s. 6d. The signatures, "J. B Doe" to each of these checks is not in my handwriting, nor has it been authorized by me.
Cross-examined by Mr. James.-No one had been prosecuted for the roIbery
Mr. William Isaiah Duttson, cashier at Mfessrs Barclay's bank, said,-On thelOth oiJanuarythecheck for 461.15s. 6d. was presented to me for payment, and I paid in two notes for Il. each, and 261. 15s. 6d. it cash.
MIr. H. ML Leslie, also cashier at Messrs. Barclay, saidThe check produced for 951. 17s. 6d. was presented to me for payment on the 10th of January, and I paid it in five 101.- notes, and 451. 17s. 6d. in gold.
Mrs. Mary Ann Smith, of 103, Leman-street, White. chapel.-I recollect the January of last year, and that on the 7th or 8th of that month a prson hired a room in my house. He said his name was Davis. That (pointing to Anderson) isthe man. Hesaid he did notkknowhow long he might want the room, but he might require it for some months. I let the room to him for 9s. a-week. Ican't say whether he took the key of the haU door. He said his luggage had not come, and he oostponed sleeping there till nextnight. He said that ho only wanted to do some writinz. He came on three separate days, Thursday being the last. On the Wednesday a yonng man came to the house and made a communication to me, and I think Anderson saw him and took him into the parlour. A day or two afterwards the same young man called again upon Me.
Edward Brown, porter at the King's Arms Eotel, at Hampton Court.-At the latter end of the year 18-55 I was a porter at Bnrrell's Hotel, London-bridge, and I left that situation in December. I advertised for another situation on the 8th of the foUowing January, and received an answer on the 9th, and went to the address of the personfrom whom I received it on the same day. The answer was in the shape of a letter. I went to 103, Leman-street, Whitechapel, and saw the last witness. I afterwards saw the pnsoner Anderson, and had a few words with him as to the advertisement which bad appeared in l ke Timoq, and he engaged me to go down to Rugby with him to look after a pony cart. He was to go after mv character that night to Mr. BurreUl and to meet me at t e Eastern Counties Raiway at 1 o'ciock next day. I went next day at 1 o'clock, and saw Mr. Anderson there against the clock, and walked towards him. He told me I was too soon, and that his friend he expected had not come Up. He asked me if I knevw a publichouse in Bishopagate-street, called Barker's, and told me to go there and get him a bill of wholesale and retail prices of spirits, as he wanted to take some down to Rugby. He told me not to hurry, and I went and got a biUl and took it back to him. When I got back he told me his friend had not arrived, and I had better go across the road and get some refreshment. We then went over to an eating-house, which is opposite the railway terminus, and belongs. I think, to a p arson named Cann. We went upstairs. He then said, as I had been at hotels, he supposed I had frequently been to bankers. I told him that I had often been to banks in Lombard-street, and others close by. He then took a book from his pocket, from which he took a check, which I believe to be the one produced. I know it had the name of " Doe" on it, and was Por the amount mentioned in that check. He asked me to get five 101-notes, 451. in gold, and 17s. Gd. in tilver. I was to take it back and meet him at the eating-house. I went to the bank and got the money, and I was going over to tr. Burrel's, as Anderson had not told me he had been after mny character, and I was going to ask Mr. Barrell
;hether he had been written to respecting it. I had reached the foot of the bridge when a young man whom I have since recognized as Atwell tapped me on the shoulder and asked me-
Mr. James submitted that any conversation that might have taken place between the witness and AtwveU was not le al evi3dence
le LORD :AdYOe overruled the objection.
Examination continued.-Atwell asked me if I had been on an errand for a gentleman named Davis? 'Upon my saying that I had, he told me that I was going the wrong way back. I told him I was on my way to Mr. Burrell's, when he said that the gentleman was waiting at the eating-house opposite the railway. On our return back I saw Anderson coming along, and said to Atwell " Here is MSr. Davis coming." AtweU then left us. Anderson took took me into a publichouse, where we had some refreshment. He then put down my name and address, and said be had been to Ur. Barrell's for my character, but that ir. Burrell was not at home. I gave him the money that I had received. He gave me 3s., and promised to go after my character in the morning. I waited over Friday, and, not having heard from him, I went to Leman-street, and then to Messrs. Barclay, to whom I gave some information.
Elizabeth Bethell. of No. 4. Dean-street, Finsbury-square, servant to Mrs. Zaphiel, said, -In January, 1856, was waitress at Cann's eating-bouse, in Shoreditch, opposite the railway, and I beLeve that Anderson is the person I saw there about the time some inquiries were made. I saw the last witness there in company with the man whom I believe to be Anderson.
Elizabeth Haydon, of No. 20, Suffolk-street, St. Pancrasroad, said,-Henry Atwell is miy nephew. At the beginning of last year hevwas residing at 8, Cottage-lano, City-road. A young woman was living there with him as his wife. They passed by the name of Hawkes. I used to go there nearly every day. I was in the habit of doing their domestic work. I know Saward, and have seen him there. The first occasion on which I saw him there was the 18th of Februiary, 1856. I have also seen him near the Sportsman publichouse, nearly opposite Cottage-lane. I took a message to him from Atwell. Not knowing his name I said to him, " Excuse the liberty I am taking, but aro you waiting to see a gentleman named Hawlkes?" Ho told me that be was. I told him that Mr. Hawk-es was engaged, and could not come that morning to see him, but that he would meet him on the Wednesday following at the appointed place. After this he caUed at AtweUl's, and asked for Mr. Hawkes. I told him that he was not at home. This was after I had seen him in the City-road. He afterwards came on a Saturday morning. Atwell was at home, and the wooman with whom he lived was in the parlour. I showed Saward into the parlour, where he remained about 20 minutes. I entered the parlour while he was there, when I saw a small parcel of papers, about the size of a finger, rolled up and lying on the table. I saw this parcel for several days afterwards on the chimneypiece in Atwell's bedroom. It was like the roU of checks now produced.
Cross-examined by 1r. James.-I used to work at other
charwoman besides Atwell's. I did not know ow AtweU was getting his living. He used to keep a horse and cart. I did not know how he got his living. I knew he had been convicted. The young woman did nothing for her living. Atwell did not go out disguised in any way. The first time I saw him was on the 18th of Febrnary. My sister had been confined that morning, and I had been up all night. The person to whom I spoke was dressed very respectably in a dark coat, but with more velvet on it then that whic Saward now wears. He had no moustaches then. He did not ask me how Mr. Hawkes was engagaed. He again caled on the Tharsdal-, and on the Saturdav, when I showed him in at once. I did not see hiin touching the papers. I can read a little. I have not read an account of these proceedings in the newspapers. I heard of it from a young man, and I then reada portion of it.
Elizabeth Evans.-I live at No. 29, Hartland-road, Camden-town. In the beoinning of the year1856 I was living with Atwell as his w'ife, and I continued to do so tiUl he was taken into cnstody at Yarmouth in September. I know the prisoner Saward. I first became acquainted with him when I vas living in C-ttage-lane at the beginning of last year. We were both passing by the name of Hawkes. I saw Saward in Cottage-lane twice at o!r lodgings. I recolect one morning being in the parlour with Atw eU whlen Saward was shown in. and he spoke to Atwell. I did not hearvwhat passed. Saward took some papers out of his pocket. I noticed that they were checks. They were doubled in half then. I went into the kitchen, and returned into the parlour while Saward was there. I then saw the papera on the table. There was a nark on the
lacy forde romand some egaig c could see as they layfoledon hetable. After Saward& left I received from Atwell the nine chbecks Produced which I kpt rolled up on the mantelpiece in my bedroom. I think I saw Saward once after that in the house. AfterAtwell was in custody I went to a house in Trafalgar-place, Walwor-tb. I saw a woman there, but I did not see Sawarda
Cross-examined by Mr. Jams-I first became acquainted with Atwell about two years and a-half ago. I frst met him at a singing room in the KbiasalaAd-road. I first lived with him as his wife at NLo. A1 'Unie-n.buildings, Hackney. road. I think I lived with him in three or four places before wo went to Cottageblsue. I had some slight idea of how he got his living. Difrerent thiiiqs occurred which induced me to think tiat he was getting his living dishonestly. I did not theeaten to leave him on account of dishonest practices, anI I did not know that be bad been convictedL We wenfe to Cottage-lane about a fortnight before Christmas. I think it was in March when I saw Saward. I do not know the day that he called, but it was the middle of the veek, because I was washing. It was my habit to wash cn a Tuesday or Wednesday. He called once a-a a Saturday. AtweU and Saward seoke before uAe, but in so low a tone that what they said, did not reach ln e. I reollect Mrs. Haydon coming into tb

The New Water Supply For Liverpool.
THE EBW WATER SUPPLY FOB LIVERPOOL.
LIlVERPOOL, JAY. 13.
The long-expected supply of water from the Rivingtoa biDs, 26 miles from Liverpool, bas within the past few days reached the town, and has done more to allay the oppositiun to its introduction than all the speeches which have beelL delivered in its favour. The question of the Rivingtiu water has been the grezt cause of local squabbles during the wvhole period in which the works have been carried on, and the town has on moro than one occasion been convulsed by the bitterness of tho controversy. The Anti-Pikeists (a name derived from the " pike" at Rivington) maintained that the red sandstone under and in the neighbourhood of the town was capable of supplying aU its wants ; and that the catch water at Rivington would not only be a failure iq quantity, but that its quality would be such that, even if it arrived in the town, which manF doubted, it would be unfit to use for domestic purposes. The Pro-Pikeists, on the other hand, contended that a town increasing with such rapid strides as Livero ought not to depend ulson the water beneath it, which was being contaminated bythe proximity of cesspools nd sewers, and which required to be puniped up at a great coat; that the iiivington water ivonid be abunidant in quantity when inpounded in the valeys; and that, after passing through the filter beds, it would he pote and w holesome.
The scheme, as projected by Mr. Thomas Hawkesley, the eminent water engineer, received the sanction of Parliamaeat ald has been brought to a successful close-successful, at least, as far as the construction of the wrorks and the conveyance of the water to Liverpool are concerned. The quality of the water is stil a debated point, the Pro-Pikeists producing favourable analyses from Dr Taylor, Dr. Lyon Pla
fair, and others; and the Anti-Pikeists submitting to the town autagonistic analyses from local chymists, and cautioning the inhabitants against the use of the water, which, they say, in certain conditions wil be poisonous.
The results of the analysis by Dr. Taylor were as fol. lowa:-
RItYflOTOI SAMPLES.
Calculated for the imperial gaUon, the solid contents amounted to 2-7 grains, consisting of
Mtineral matter, chiefly sulphate of lime (with traces
of oxide of iron and silica) ... ... ... .. 2 0 Organic matter of a vegetable nature .. . . 0 7
Grains in imperial gallon ... ... .. ... 27
On Dr. Clark's scale the hardness amounted to about 1A degrees.
Thereis (says Dr. Taylor) nothing of an unwholesome or injurious naturo in any of the waters. On the contrary, they contain less mineral and organic matter than is frequently found in wrater supplied to towns.
The whele question was ftUly debated at a meeting of the town-council yesterday, when Mr. Aldermun Bennett, the leader of the Anti-Pik;e movement, proposed that tho lIivington water be kept in readiness for use at fires, bat that it be not used for domestic purposes.
The proposition was negatived by 3Tto ll, and the proceedings of the water committee were adopted.
The Rivington scheme comprises the impounding of the catchment, river, and spring waters of the Rvinton district in three large reservoirs, formed in the valleys, its conduction into filter-beds, and its descpnt to liverpool through a pipe line 26: miles long. The reservoirs at Rivingion cover 50 acres of )arnd, and hold 3,0O0,00R,00 galloas of water; the entire water-shed, in round numbers, is 10,000 acres;* the rainfal, 50 inches per annumn ; and the undertaking will havw cosb between 60W0i00. au-I
At the meeting of the counnil yesterday itwas stated that the total cost of the old waterworks was S01,000e., pr. ducing a week)y supply of water of 44,0,0f gaUons; 'hile the total cost of the Rirington works would be 094,7721., in addition to 35,278I. paid for the purchase of the Chorley WaUerworks, and the weekly supply of water would be 19,00%W000 gallons per day.

LO.frDON, THURDA Y, JAN UA.BY 15, 1857.
Why should we hesitate to confess it ?-there is a great deal of distress in the country. Ten thou,aud men met the other - day among the deserted pens of Smithfield-market to make known their want of employment. Everywhere ia the country you meet stout, honest, simple fllOWS, with the usual ntory of penniless hunger. Poor Law Guzrdiani and County Magistrates are plotting against one another, the former ready to crowd the gaols with rebels againkt their atem reign; the latter resolving that flin A FI-Sky's prisons
and the once glorious system of criminal jurisprudeuce shall not be degraded into a mere engine of workhouse discipline. As to the want of work, it proves no more than what everybody knows. Everybody knows that just now it is midwinter, the days at the shortest, the groumd either wet or frozen, and that consequently the employer does not get much work done for his money, or the work so well done. Anybody who has under his observation a number of publie or private works will notice that scores, or even hundreds, of labourers have been dismissed for the present. There are fewer railways in progress than for some years past. The Army, Navy, and Dockyards have been diseharging their superfluous men. The nation has just concluded, and is paying the bill for, an immense undertaking, of a most unproductive character-a war, which in the eyes of political economy is much on a par with conflagration, flood, volcano, tempest, or pestilence. We may have won security for our children and glory for ourselves, but that is the whole of the recompense, and when we "take " stoek" at the end of the year it affords but a very sorry capital for reinvestment. The most inunediate and most tangible result of the war is that we are paying Income-tax, every sixpence of which is abstracted from the funds of enterprise and the wages of labour. Such is the general propensity for spending in one form or another-and so little satisfaction do most people happily find in merely adding pound to pound-that money is commonly spent, perhaps, even faster than it is earned, and it cannot be spent except by some process of industry, labour, and wages. Just now we are annually many millions short, and the result is, a good many people are showing themselves rather close-fisted to their poorer, and even their richer neighbo-ras. It may seem almost ridiculous that we should have to explain all this, whieh, indeed, explains itself to the common understanding; but we are held in some quarters responsible for the perpetual and constant prosperity of the country, come what will-come peace, come war, come famine, come plague. That responsibility we beg to disclaim ; and we only mention the causes of the prevailing distress in order that it may be better apprehended in connexion with them.
What is to be done ? A stern political economy answers, " Nothing." We are to leave the problem to work itself out. lYe are to button up our pockets, shut our doors, and look out of windows at the spectacle of poverty running through its phases, and coming to a natural conclusion. Pray don't disturb the experiment. These tender processes do not bear the least interruption. Poverty, provided the conditions be favourable for it, will umdergo first the vinous fermentation; it will become rather excited, argumentative, and menacing; then it will pass through the acetic fermentation, and sour into crime. It is then ripe for our gaols. We know how to deal with it in that state; and, so generous are we when we are quite certain we are right, that we can afford to spend on a criminal twice as much as on a pauper, and thrice as much as on an honest labourer out of doors. It is rather odd, and it shows what paradoxes the most healthy British minds can go through in their very gradual and irregular development, that just now the State is most kind, generous, and open-handed towards crime in all its stages and circumstances, at the very time that it will not give one farthing to poverty and toil. In our grand annual statement of the Public Income and Expenditure the words "Poverty," " Charity," "Relief," do not cccur; and public works, or other employments afforded by the State, are, of course, simply on its own account, and have no reference whatever to the wants of the population. On the other hand, the Courts of Justice for the last year cost the country 754,9311.; Police and Criminal Prosecutions, 1,012,5821.; Correction, 1,424,9071.; total, 3,192,4201. This is comprised under the general head of " Justice." For Morey there is nil. Of late years there has been an increasing tendency on the part of the State to undertake the whole dirty work of the nation, and the only check on this morbid appetite for disag,reeable business has been the reflection that the dirty work would probably increase all the more for there being some one so ready to undertake it. This has proved not far from the truth, for at times we have begun to fear that the "'normal'" Englishman was an animal that must pass through a regular process of picking and stealing, poachiing, petty larceny, &-c.; then through the hands of the police, the magistrate, the prison, and so on, till he emerged in his butterfly state as a ticketof-leave man, and, having laid the eggs of fresh crime, died. We are almost afraid to bring up these subjects, for we have observed the more they are talked about the more rapid is the tendency we have been describing. County Magistrates and ratepayers are always delighted to hear Parliament talking about gaols, police, correction, and crime, because it always ends in Parliament taking some of the responsibility off the county shoulders. It is just as whenyou arebetrayedinto questioning a mendicant. It matters not whether his story turns out good or bad; if you have taken up five minutes of his valuable time you must give him sixpence at least. The Parliamentary debate invariably ends in a large addition to the head of " Justice" in the public expenditure.
All evils, however, have their linit. Thley become at last so exorbitant, so preposterous, as to convict themselves of absurdity. We believe it to be so just now in this matter of " Justice," and in the enormous cost of prisons, police, and correction. It obtrudes itself on the public eye with the pompous vulgarity of a handsome county prison stuck, as the frontispiece of a genteel county town, vis-A-zis to a first-class railway station. You can't help noticing it, try ever so much. So people-that is, the few people who are absolutely committed and bound to the oxisting practice-are beginning to ask how it is that poverty is so fast maturing into crime, and why crime is becoming so enormous, so vested, and so bighly favoured an interest. Among other things, they discover that many of the poor creatures who crowd our gaols in winter-time, and who cost
tlle country so much, are either sent there straight from the workhouse for some act of insubordination, or are committed for some act the natural result of. sheer destitution. Though a learned Judge. observed from the Bench that he did not see why it was necessary a man should live, that is not the universal opinion; and there is a large class who will work when they can get work, and steal when they can't. Thousands of persons of this sort are sent to prison, where they cost the country nearly a pound a-week, when they would have been glad of half that sum in honest wages out of doors. We are not surprised, therefore, to observe in a circular which we publish elsewhere, entitled " Suggestions prqposedl to be embodied in " a Repmot to the Quarter Sessions for the "consideration of thte Committee in relation to
Criminal Jurisprudence," one suggestion on the existing subserviency of the prison to the workhouse. It is, " that offenees against workhouse " rules should in general be punished by other "means than imprisonment in a criminal prison; "and that greater faoilities for obtaining relief "should be afforded to the poor and destitute, as "well as to discharged prisoners, to prevent their "committing offences in order to procure an <asylum." It is not our place to nuggest how
this should be -done, considering the psrt we have taken on the subject of poverty and labour; though we sha3l be ready to offer our advice when au opening presents itself. But it does rather devolve on those who have got us into this difficulty to show us a way oat of it. If we remember right, the authors of the existing Poor Law system promised us two things,first, that the maintenance of the poor would cost much leas; secondly, that it should cost the State nothing. In an irregular and unexpected way both these promises have been signallydisappointed. The maintenance of the poor is now done through the medium of the crniinal prisons, which are filled with half-starved labourers and refractory paupers. The poor ask for work, and are refused, though they only ask for 10s. a-week or so, and offer labour for it. So they " qualify," as the term is; they commit some offence, and get into a warm cell, where they are well clothed and fed till the spring, when they are as glad to get out as their keepers to let them go, neither party, however, much the better for it.

A letter which we insert in our columns of this
A letter which we insert in our columns of this day recalls our attention to the recent crisis of Antipodean politics. Mr. J. W. DoN.ALnsox writes to defend his brother, the ex-Premier of New South WVales, from the imputations of "political cowardice," " pusillanimity," and "fastidiousness," afflxed to him by our Mel. bourne correspondent. But we cannot say much for the effect of this advocacy. Mr. J. W. DoiALDsox's own admission, indeed, fully justifies the language of our correspondent. He distinctly affirms that "the DONALDSON Adlninistra"tion resigned because they could not go on with a "miserable majority of two or three." But why did they not try 9 Why did they not attempt to convert this " miserable majority" into a respectable majority? Why throw up the cards at once? Weak as the DoxAIDso? Ministry was, there was no probability that any stronger one could be found; and, ap to our latest accounts, no stronger had been found. Surely this conduct was politically fastidious and politicaUy pusilanimous; and it was unfortunately exhibited at a time and in a country which demanded the very reverse oI pusillanimity and fastidiousness. If ever there were a country, a time, and a combination of circumstances which required from a constitutional Minister a firm and resolute bearing, the inauguration of a constitutional Government at the other side of the globe required it; and to slhink at such a time from the chances of a rough collision or a possible defeat might not imcharitably be deemed unworthy of a man to whom had been intrusted the delicate task of inaugurating responsible government at the Antipodes. His conduct seems to have introduced other difficulties and dilenmmas. After the DoNA1)soN IMinistry broke up, becaiise it might hereafter be beaten in Parliament, the CowPER Ministry broke up because it was beaten on some discussion of secondary moment. And to this hour, for aught we know, the whole legislative and executive progress of the oldest Australian Government may be brought to a dead lock by the alternate nomination and retirement of successive Ministries, defeated, or apprehending defeat, on questions which involve only personal predilections, and not one political principle. Now, this is much to be regretted. It is to be regretted as obstructing the progress of legislation in New South WVales. It is to be regretted as affording not only to the haters of self-government, but even to its less sanguine and less hopeful admirers, a pretext for the belief that our institutions cannot bear transplanting in their fullgrown state to other climes and a distant, albeit kindred, people. To this belief we should be loth to give our adherence. It would be too disheartening were we obliged to confess that, because no one State can exactly reproduce the historical phenomena of another, or exhibit precisely the same process of development, therefore a younger nation is unable to repeat the fortimes or the institutions of its prototype.
Undoubtedly, however, there are some disadvantages attending the translation of full-grown constitutions and elaborated systems from an older to a younger people. It is very like the inheritance of acquired wealth by the son of an industrious and saving trader. He, at 21, steps into the possession of opulence accumulated by 40 years' toil, saving, and solicitude. He begins his own life with the fruits of two-thirds of his father's life. At his age his father was in a condition not much better than the boy who grooms his horae or brushes his boots. lWherever he goes, and whichever way he turns, he may enjoy the pleasant thought that his comforts, luxuries, and pleasures are the redundant acquisitions of 40 years' hard work and rigorous parsimony. He has books, pictures, wines, horses, carriages, such as it never entered into his father's head to buy to his dying day. So far he is better off than the founder of his fortunes. But there is one part of the old man's capital that, ten to one, the son has not inherited,-he has not inherited the patient thrift and the constant labour to which he owes his wealth. He may, indeed, be moderately prudent and reasonably careful; he probably also has what the old man never pretended to-taste. But the creative and hardy energies of his sire he rarely does possess ; and, were his fortunes to be wrecked either by accident or temerity, it is not very likely that he would be able to rebuild them. There is some analogy between his condition and that of the colony which inherits the legacy of self-government from the mother cointry. That which cost the parent State centuries of intestine troubles, factious conflicts, or hapless revolutions, the happy offspring inherits without a struggle and almost without a demand. Popular representation, free discussion, responsible administration, are its unearned and traditionary acquisition. It would be unreasonable to suppose that privileges so easily obtained will at first be very highly prized, or that there will not be some waste of the power which has sprung so rapidly into use. But at the same time it would be harsh to predict that the power would be wholly wasted and the boon utterly despised; that; because the colony had obtained in two or three years 'what the mother country had not acquired in less than 200 years, or because the former had not passed through the ordeal of petition of rights, remonstrances, impeaehment, and civil war, therefore the duration of colonial self-government would be briefer than that of its metrowolitan prototype.
At the same time, those who are the best friends to the colonies will not think it superfluous to warn those who poesess free institutions against a reckless prodigality of means which have been given them for their use, for their honour, and their advancement. They have an immense extont of country; they may reasonably expect to grow into a very great people. As is the germ of that people so will be its development; as is the character of its early, such will be the character of its maturer, legislation. It is no light or trivial thing to make laws for an empire, even in embryo. It is no slight or passing peril to trifle, or seem to trifle, with its interests, to postpone public to pri. vate questions, matters of state to personal predilections. At the present moment there may not, indeed, be very much to engross the attention of Australian Parliaments and Ministries, but every year will add to their work, their occupation, and their constituents. Grave and
momentous topics affecting millions, 'where now they only affect thousands, will come undet
the cognizance of the colonial authorities. To prepare fitly for their high destiny, and the duties which it will bring with it, tho Par]iaments of the Antipodes should now, in their sson of leisure, learn to perform their work with all simplicity and truthfulne3s. They are not vestries, nor spouting clubs, nor debating societies. They are I instituted not to qualify this or that man for
speaking wel or gaining popularity, or to gratify this grudge and feed that job; but to guard the liberties, promote the prosperity, and cherish the honesty, the virtue, and the manliness of the people whose representatives they are. On them depend the happiness and character of future millions. They have inherited a boon which -Bad to say-is to two-thirds of civilized Europe a stumbling-block of offence. To the despot and the bigot, who hate more deeply even than they pretend to despise the free government of England, the self-govermnent of English colonies is an abomination and abhorrence. Every failing that marks their career, every error and shortcoming, will inspire with joy and gratulation the statesmen and the autocrats who hate England both because she possesses and because she communicates freedom. Let this recollection be ever present to their minds, and divert them from the idle game of faction and personal antagonism. Let it stimulate them to vigorous and healthy action, to honest and hearty work; and, if at times they are warped by petty feuds or paltry quibbles from the higher duties of their calling, let them only reflect for a moment that their shortcomings will inspire the enemies of rational freedom in every part of the world with malignant, though probably premature, exultation.
It is a fashion of essayists, when depicting any
It is a fashion of essayists, when depicting any bad state of society, to represent crime as " stalk" ing abroad with unblushing front," or vice as "rearing its head unabashed," with other tropes of the like import and novelty. But what is to be said of our own age and time ? That we are worse than our forefathers we do not in the least degree believe, nor could such an opinion, indeed, be ever entertained by those who know what kind of days the days of the past really were. On the contrary, we are persuaded that in the middle of this 19th century there is a higher tone of morality pervading the nation, more general uprightness of principle, and a more elevated standard of public opinion to be found, than could have been discovered at any former period. The observer in such matters should look, not only to the calendar of offences committed, but to the spirit in which they are viewed. Nor should it be forgotten that the unexamplcd publicity now attending al trans. actions gives a new species of prominence to every misdeed. It cannot, however, be denied that crime in the present day seems to have acquired a character which, if lacking some atrocities of feature, is nevertheless stamped with a cast of its own. It partakes more of the nature of a profession, is more deliberately adopted as a method of livelihood, is pursiued with greater systeim, and practised with more signal aids of skill, patience, and capital than we conceive to have been the case in days gone by. More than one example will probably suggest itself to the reader's mind in confirmation of our remarks; but just now we simply call attention to the life and career of a convict, as described by himself.
EDWARD AGAR, a prisoner under sentence of transportation for life, was placed in the witnessbox at the Central Criminal Court on Tuesday last as approver in the case of the great bullion robbery on the South-Eastern Railway. From his evidence it appears that the only employment, that is to say, the only legitimate avocation he ever had hi his life, was for a certain period some 14 or 20 years ago. As he is now 41 years of age, he mnust then, we will suppose, have been about 25; but upon what service he was engaged before that time we are not informed. It does not seem that he quitted this employment in consequence of any breach of trust on his part; indeed, he stated that he did not know of any robbery committed in the establishment during his connexion with it. Neither do we hear of his being enticed into wrongdoing by the accidents of special temptation, or allured by tlle seductions of veteran offenders. That he might have known want is possible; but he had evidently learnt economy, and to some purpose, too, for while in his situation he saved 501., which he took away with him. Nevertheless he now acknowledges, with a startling simplicity of declaration, that within two or three years of leaving this place he " first began to live by crime, "and has been more or less engaged in the commis"sion of crime ever since." What was the particular or prevailing character of his offences is more than could be precisely elicited in the examination, but he has " been in the United States, where he " speculated a good deal," has " discounted bills," and has " received the proceeds of several " forgeries." How, according to his own confession, he directed his attempts against the bullion safes of the railway company our readers have seen, but the most remarkable feature in his statement is his plain acknowledgment that he was under no kind of pressure from anything like poverty or destitution. "At this time," says he, " I was not in want of money," an avowal which he presently expanded and confirmed by the admission that he was possessed of no less a sum than 3,0001. That this money was ill-gotten we may safely presume, but the old proverb was not verified by its being ill-spent, for it was prudently invested in Govermment securities, and, in fact, as he avers, had been in the funds for some time. We consider this one of the most extraordinary statements ever made in connexion with the pursuits of crime. Great gains have often, no doubt, been wrongfllly accomplished, but it is usually assumed that they are dissipated with very poor returns. In the evidence given concerning -the frauds upon the City banks the other day ono of the approvers-himself under sentence of transportation for life-appeared, it is true, in the character of a capitalist. ' I paid them," said he, speaking of some bills, " into CouTrc's to my " account. I had had an account with them for some " time." But this, though not exactly in keeping with our ordinary conceptions of such matters, is explained by other allegations made in the course of the inquiry, which represented the possession and employment of capital as part and parcel of the transactions. AGAin, however, had actually got 3,0001., we will not say of his own, but at any rate at his own command, which seems simply to have been accumulated and invested as might have been done in any bonesttrade. Howoften indeed, may we ask, can the utmost industry and frugality be relied upon to yield such a saying as was effected here ?'
Yet there ,i no reason why honesty should look with envy upon crime, when the successful criminal in the very prims of his days finds himself condemned for the rest of his life to a punishaent only short of death. A more serviceable reflection may be suggested by the light which is throw-n by an exsample like this upon the various projects devised for the reformation of offenders. If AcGA's statement is to be in all respects credited he must have passed his youth, if not in innocence, at all events nithout any serious acquaintance with crime; and he must have brought hiis intdustry or his abilities to at least as productive a marl;et as most men meet with, if he left his first employment with 50Q.
saved. -Yet, when about the age of 30 he enters upon a eareer of crime, and makes it so completely his profession as to practise, it more or less ever afterwards. Now, how, we ask, is it reasonable to suppose that habit5 formed in this manner are to be superseded by more desirable persuasions concerning right and wrong? What has been said about the "professional" character acquired by crime could not be more clearly illustrated. The purstut may be lucrative as well as captivating. It involves the excitement of enterprise; it provides the spur of emulation, by pitting tho dexterity of the delinquent against the precautions of his intended victims; it brings always the hope and occasionally the reward of success; and, though retribution is indeed looming in the distance, it is safe to suppose that this element of computation has been deliberately considered. Let us hope that, as things proceed, the risks of such a pursuit may be so increased as to rob it of its allurements. The tricks of vice can hardly be infinite, and, as one exposure follows another, one profit after another must be cut off. It is hard, perhaps, to believe in the perfectibility of the human race; but if the young can be taken out of the paths of evil, and the seed-plots of crime destroyed, we may look with some confidence to such a preponderance of the balance in favour of honest labour as shall leave a criminal profession with very few chances indeed.

A "Casualty" In The Indian Army.-The
A "CASUALTY" D; m} LTHE Di Aivmy.--The following are extracts from an officer's letter, dated Bombay, Nov. 1, 1856 :-" A most awful fire has just consumed every house in the 11th Regiment, with the exception of mine and Bolton's. Our houses are built (?) of grass mats for walls, bamboos for posts and beams, and woyen palm leaves for roof. In my case my tent was slung up inside and tied to the ridge pole. In the others luxury has made imitation ceilings of cloth whitewashed. Well, I was listening to our band playing Don Giozanni in the mess, next door, and thinking of getting ready for parade at a quarter past 4, when I beard cries of ' Arg,' and heard the awtul cracklng sound of a fire close by. I rushed to the bedstead, clutched a blanket, dipped it in the bathing tub, rushed out, threw it on the roof, and a horsekeeper after it, and as the palm leaves caught fire he put them out. When I got out the sight was awfuL I could not say whether my own house was not on fire. Captain Cahusac's house, where it originated, was due N.N. W. of mine, and in two or three minutes that very wind sprang up strongly. Over my house there was an arch of fire and smoke, which caught the mess-house, and the fire began on the other side of me. I threw a knife to the man on my roof. He cut down the tent, and in less than seven minutes every book, table, desk, Ic., was out of the house. I had my friend Nowton's buggy and horse in my charge; they were safely got out, and by that time the store-room was flaming on fire. I tried to save the stores, and got out some cheroots, beer, champagne, &c. Our hedges, which are made of reeds, were down in a jiffey, but the wind was too strong for us. We lost the whole of our mess kit-two sets of mess crockery-such a pretty one !-the new one was worth 2001, a billiard table and a carriage belonging to Lieutenant Davison. Our mess has lost altogether 2,0001. Major Drammond and his daughter, Mrs. Forbes, 5,0001. between them. Our Mlajor will have to serve on, instead of retiring. Those who were in debt are now in bopeless difliculties, and those who kept out of debt have a taste of the happy state of indebtedness, MajorDrummond has just found a lump of goldwhore his gold comns were. We were to have had our halfyearly review and inspection. Now, we have not books to inspect, nor, some of us, uniforms to be inspected in. The six ladies have, most of them, only got what they escaped in and what was at the ' dhoby's,' or washerman's. If the fire had taken place at night we should bave had specimens of roast a Ia New Zoaland, but only one horse and parrot lost their lives. Some poor fellows of the Bth, who were studying, have lost their books, one semnt came and told me that he had lost his 4aracter in the fire. The sepoys behaved like trumps, fetching out tables, chairs &c. One 'seedey,' or negro half-caste, waLked into the smoulder. ing fire of the storeroom, with the fire up to his ancles, and handed out the bottles of blazing straw-bound wine with the coolness of a fire-king."
FRIGcTr-, CGlUETIrrs ON BOARD AN AxErIc.NI SInp.-A case is at present under investigation by the American Consul and the police authorities which involves the death of a fine young Dutchman, about 19 years of age, from alleged cruelty by some of the officers of the American ship Guy Mannering. Upon the arrival of the vessel in the Bramley-Moore Dock the young man was removed on a stretcher to the Northern Hospital, at an early hour on Monday morning, in a state of insensibility. From this state he never rallied, and death terminated his sufferings in the course of the afternoon of the same day. His body presents a frightful spectacle; his head and face appear to ho "mashen to a mummy," the nose completely flattened and crushed, and the sklil evidently fractured. Down to the extremities scarcely an inch of space appears between the bruises, cuts, and sores. The evidence, so far as can at present bo ascertained, implicates a man named Lewis, the boatswain of the ship, who is said to have struck the deceased a blow across the face with a belaying pin, which may account for the fractured state of the nse. This man is under the surveillance of the police; and, as an inquest wiU be held on the body today, the case will then be fully investigated, Mr. Wall. the head surgeon of the hospital, having expressed his opinion that the injuries received have been the cause ef death. Another man, named George Watts, belonging to the same sbip, is also lying in the same hospital with a severe soalp wound, which he said was intlicted by Cuttings, the third mate. His body is also fearfully bruised with blows fram belaying pins and other murderous weapons, with which the mstes of the ship had armed themselves during the voyage. The inquest was opened yesterday (Wednesday) before the borough coroner, and the third mate, Henry Cuttings, and the boatswain, Lewis, were in custody. It was proved that during the voyage both the
risoners hxd repeatedly beaten the deceased, as also nad the firt mate.-Liverpool cUcrcury. (By Electric Telegraph).-The jury returned a verdict of M ltan. slaughter" against the second and third mates andthe bo3tswain, and the two latter were committed for trial, a warrant being issued for the apprehension of the second mate cuttings, who is a young man respectably connected in Liverpool, cried like a child when the verdict was given.

QUEEN'S HOSPITAL BALL, BMsNGa3Lse
annual ball for the beLefit of the Queen's Hospital, Birmnngham, took place on Thursday last, and went off very successfully, there being nearly 1,000 persons present. The hal was tastefully decorated for the occasion. Major-General Windham attended, and his presence contributed much to the success of the bail. Over the orchestra, in front of the organ, was hoisted a white banner, displaying, in letters formed of pink roses, the inecnption ' Welcome, Windham, the Hero of the Rodan.' General Windbam was received very enthusiastically, and the band played " See, the conquering hero comes." He joined in the aance, and re,nained tiU a late hour. Letters expressive of great regret at unavoidable absence wero received from tbe Earl of Stamford and Warrington, the Earl Howe, the Earl of Cardigan, Viscount Curzon, Lord Willoughby de Broke, Lord Sandys. Lord Leigh, Colonel Sir T. Skipwith, Sir R. Peel, AP., Mr. C. N. Newdegate, MLP., Mr. G. F. Muntz, M.P., Colonel Wilkie, alonel Unett, Colonel Boultbee, Major Harrison, Major Tbomnpson, S;c.
Thte Times of Saturday last, among soomc reflections upon the mode in which honounrs have been conferred for services during the war, referred to Lord Panmute's emphatic approval, at the Forfar banquet, of the report of Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tullooh, and resnarked that they were almost the only persons of such distinction who had received no honorary reward for their labours. The individual grievance, that journal olserved, may be a trifle, but it may happen that the individual represents a priiciple, and in that case the affair becomues one of poibhc concern. " The object of the whole system of military rowards is the efficiency of the service, and for that end it is necessary that there should be fairness in the distribution of the rewards, that there should be no favoaritism as regards individuals, and no illiberality or prejudice with regard to classes of services, but that aU kinds of services should be rewarded, and none left out." Now , admitting the soundness of this rule, a case has fallen under our notice in which there certainly seems to have been same neglect in putting it in practice. The importance and difficulty of the duties whlich devolved upon the muedical staff attacbhed to the armiiy it would be impossible to overrate; and it may easily be believed that nowhere were those duties more arduous than in those semi-civilized forces where the niedical department required to be organized for the first time. Yet, while the services of Sir John Hall, the chief of the medical staff attached to the British army, and of his subordinates, have been rewarded with honorary distinctions., n,rne such have been bestowed upon those of Dr. Farqushar, who was at the head of Omar Pasha's English Medical Staff, orof Dr. Dancan M'l'erson, who filled the same post in the Turkish Contingent. Our readers may re,nemtiher the tribute we paid to Dr. M'Pherson's exerti"ns, when he visited this city with a view to the fonrnatiun of his staff. We believe there is no question at all ,f the value of the services rendered both by him and Dr. Farqushar in their respective spheres. and it sems hard to understand whhy they shonltd be ta,de exceptions in the distributioni of honours. The Turkish Contingent, at all events. was reckoned as forming a portion of rhe army under the British Commander.in-Chief.-Edinbvurgh Evening Courant, of JAn. 8.

The Bullion Robbery On The South-Eastern Railway.
THE BULLION ROBBEY ON THE
SOUTH-EASTERN RAILWAY.
VENTRAL cRIMINAL. COTRT. JAN. 14.
The trial of the prisoners Pierce, Burgess, and Tester, charged with co!amitting the extensive bullion robbery capon the South-Eastern Railway in May, 1655, was resumed -before Mr. Baron Martin and Mr. Justice Willes, at 10 <elook this morning. The interest excited by the proceed. ings continues without much abatement, but at no time througbout the sitting was the portion of the court allotted to spectators filled to inconvenience. The demeanour of bhe prisoners was the same as on the previous day, Tester, 'the youngest of the three, seeming to be more concerned -about his fate than his older accomplicea. The communication between the accused and their legal advisers was also kept up to-day, the prisoner Burgess, however, taking by far the greatest number of notes, and handing them to his counsel.
The first wvtness called was 3r. Everard, who, in answer to questions from Mr. MONK, stated,-I am a member of the firm of Everard and Co., of Paris. I received a bullion box from Messrs. Abel and Co., on the]l7th of.May last. I saw the box opened. It contained nothing but a quantity -of shot and some shavings.
Thomas Sharman, examined.-I keep the Torrington lArms, at Mereworth, Kent. I was boolcing-clerk at Folke'ftone, In May, 1855. I saw Agar at Folkestone in October, it54. I know Ledger, and recollect when he was married. His marriage took place about the period when I saw Agar. I saw Tester-a clerk on the line-with Agar. They were walking about the pier. I was on speaking terms with them. I went in their company to the Pavilion Hotel, and had some refreshment. A friend of mine, named Grimstead, was also there with us.
Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant BALLXI,rNE.-I don't know when Tester was married. Don't recollect whether Tester introduced Agar to me. Hazel had told me that Afar was a suspicious person before I went to the Pavilion wnth them. I went with Tester, whom I believed to be respectable, and I afterwards remarked to Hazel that I thought he had been misinformed regarding Agar.
Mr. G. D. Ha7el, examined.-I ain inspector of police to -the South-Eastern Railway at Redhill. In October, 1854, 1 held the corresponding situation at Folkestone. I saw Pierce and Agar at Folkestone harbour in May, 1854. They -were looking at the boat which ran in connexion with the
tdal train. They remained at the pier about a quarter of an hour, and then went away torards the town. I had a xreason for watchingPierce at tha ttime. Saw them both about 10 or 12 times after this at the arrival and departure of the boats. I made a communieation to Mr. Steer, snperin4en. -dent of the town police of Folkestone. In October, 1854, I saw Agar loitering about the booking-office for about 10 eninutes. He was watclhing the proceedings of the clerk, Sharman, who was making up his money. I saw Agar talking to Tester by the pier on the following day. The boat was then getting ready. They afterwards walked towards 'the Pavilion Hotel. Tester went up to London the ame
aiiht.
Cross-examined by SIr. Serjeant BALLANTINE.-Cannot tell whether Tester was married before or after the robbery. He held his situation in the employment of the company some time after the robbery. He left it for better employ.ment; and subsequently he surrendered to take his trial. I cautioned Sharman against Agar, whose appearance I did -ot like. I did not say anything about him to Teeter, who seem to know him well.
James Steer, superintendent of police at Folkestone, de. Vosed,-I was at Folkestone in Mlay, 1854. I saw Pierce half-way between that town and Hythe, in company with -a man named Adams. In consequence of something that bad been said to me I noticed them. They were at Folkestone in the spring for about a fortnight, and walked a good deal on the pier. When they saw that I observed them they soparated and wvalked away. In October I again sawy Agar, near the Pavilion Hotel. On one occasion I saw Br -gess with Agar near Folkestone harbour.
Henry Williams, booking-clerk to the South-lEastemnI ailway Company, esamined.-I was formerly a night
porter and watchman at Dover. I was on duty when the Sl -o'clock nmail arrived at Dover on the 15th of Mlay, 1835. Bnrgess and Kennedy were the guards of that train. I did not notice the passengers who came down with it. I attended the departure of the 2 a.m. up train the next morn. ;ng. Saw two passengers who travelled first-class by it. They carried bags with theni. I noticed theme pass through the office wbile Burgess, Kennedy, and I were standing there topethei. A porter asked to carry their bags for them. vne of the two men was taller than the other; the one was of light complexion and the other dark. I issued two tickets only for that train, but not to the two passengers I have described, who did not apply for any tickets.
Joseph Witherden.-I am a porter, in the employ of the South-Eastern Railway Coumpany, at Dover. Was on duty -on the night of the 15th of May. Before the 2 a.m. train went up two men, carrying carpet-bags, and wearing short cloaks, came on to the platform without taking tickets. The bags they had appeared to be heavv, from the way in which -they carried them. Spoke to them about their tickets. They produced two Ostend return tickets. I asked whether their uggago had passed the Custom-house. They replied,
o; ;t came over the prevous night." One of them gavSehme some money; I don't kno-.v which of the two it
Mr. Werter Clark, examnined.-I keep an inn called the Rose, near St. Mary's Church, at Dover. Two men, one of whom was tall and dark, and the other short and fair, came -to my house one evening in the early part of 1855 and had some refreshment. They stayed at my house al night, and went away next morning. They asked the way to Folkestone, and I directed them to the road thither by the
Robert Clark.-I am a waiter at the Dover Castle Hotel, Dover. Two men came to thab house one night sho,tly after the date of the arrival of the French Emperor. One of them was considerably shorter than the other. The complexion of the short man was fair; the tall one was dark. Theyasked for some brandy and water, which they wished to be put into a sodawater bottle. I got it for them. They left the hotel late the same night, carrying their own luggage. They said they were g ,ing by the 2 a.m. train.
W. Dickinson, policeman at the company's terminus, London-bridge, deposed,-I recollect the 2 a.m train arriving froni Dover on the morning of the 16th of May, 1855, about 4 o'clock; only about four passengers came by it. Two men came out of a carriage that I opened. One of them was taller and of darker complexion than the other. The man who first left the oarriage had a bag with him, and wore a loose cape. I did not notice the dress of the other sian. I offered to get a cab for them. They declined my offer. An offlicer is always stationed at the door of the station to take down the numbers of the cabs as thoy go out, and their destinations.
William Woodhouse, another railway porter at the time -of the robbery, deposed that there was no luggage in the van of the up early train on the morning of the 16th of May.
Stephen Jones stated,-I am a guard in the service of the South-Eastern Railway Company. in may, 1855, 1 was guard of the 7 30 t.lD. rainfrom Dover. We were due at Redhill at 9 2. 'he 8 p.m. train from London was due there also at J 4. Tester came up by my train. Saw him come out of the refreshment.rooim at Redhill before he got into the train. He had with him a black leather bag, of from 12 to 15 inches in length. He entered a first-class cariage. The traim did not stop tiLl it reached London. Did not see Tester again that night. 1 saw Pierce and another nman on the pier at Folkestone antecedent to the -robbery. I had also seen Burgess, Pierce, and other persons at a publichouse in Tooley-street. I was guard of the 730 p.t. up train in April, as well as in May.
Cross-examined by Mr. Strjeant BALL,kNTINE.-The guards don't often have charge of the same trains for more than one month; but there are some exceptions to this rule, such as when the service is special. Can't swear whether or not I mentioned anything about Tester having -a black bag before I heard that Agar charged Tester with being an a"coimplice in the robbery. Swear that I saw Trester with the black bag at Redhil in May. In the June flowving the robbery I was examined by the company on the subject, but I did not then iemition anything about this
bag. I was not questioned on that point. I see nothing unusual in Tester's having the black bag with
Cross-examined by Mr. RiDTnON.-Never saw Pierce while he (Pierce) was in the service of the company. Pierce left the company's employ before I was engaged on the line.
Frederick Russell, examined.-I am booking-clerk at the London station of the Greenwich Railway. I know Tester, and recollect his coming to the office, about 10 10, one eveng in may,1855. Hetoldme he had come upfrom ieigate hy the Dover line, amid had beeii there and back since office hours. Tester then lived at Lowisham, and so did I. The last Greenwich down train left at half-past 10 o'clcek. Tester asked iue if I was going down to Green. wich. He had a black leather bag with him, which he set down in the booking-office, and then went out for a little timie. The bag looked new, and about 15 inches long.
hile T^ester was out Perry, the night porter, came in and lookedat thebag, remarking that it was heavy. Tester returned, took up his beg, and went into a carriage. I traveiled i the same carriage with Tester that night. He waa not in the habit of going down by the bali-past 10 p.m.
Cross-exanmined by Mr. Serjeant BALLA?TUNE.-The bag was a shimy black leather one. Tester was away for about seven or eight minutes, during whioh timne the bag was left in a corner by the fireplace of my office. Tester was mariled about two months before the robbery.
,jonn r'erry, night atchnman at the London and Green. wich termminus, deposed,--I know Teeter. Remember seeing him in May, 1855. He was then entering the Greenwich booking-otlice. This wAs shortly after 10 o'clock p.m., and -the lst train s to leave London at 1020. In shiftiig the position of som6 'uggage in the office I took up a black bag, and observed to MIr. ussell that itfelt heavy and "lampy," just as though a stone was in it. Mr. Russell said that it was Tester's beg.
Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant BALLAN'm7B.-The bag produced ms like tb one m question, It might have been a little larger. When we read Agar's evidence the circumatancesjmected wvith the hag recurred to our memory.
[r. C.bkb, the eminent locksmith, was next exanined. HIe ststed,-I belong to the firm of Chubb and Son. We -made four bullion chests for the SouthKEastern Hallway Company several years ago. There were two locks to each safe. The superintendent of the company a*plied to us to mnake several alterations in the locks of the chests between the months of June or July and September or October, 1854. The orders for these alterations were given by letters written in the handwriting of Tester, and signed by Mr. :Brown. The correspondence now produced is that which our firum received from the company on the subject, The No. 1 looks of two chests were altered, and the keys from time to time returned to the superintendents ofrice. When I first heard of thecommittalof the robbery I coamunicated wirththe rail way comipany on the subject. I snbseqcuently in. spected the chests. The whole of the No. 2 locks were so corrodied that the keys would not open them. They ap,
peared to have been in that state for some time, and to have become so for want of use.
Mr. J. P. Knight, examined.-I succeeded Mr. Brown as out-door superintendent of the South-Eastern Railway. In 1855 I was hMr. Brown's deputy. Tester was a clerk in the superintendent's office. He left that situation in September, 1855. In April and Mfay, 1855, Tester bad to regulte the rota of the guards' duty. The paper produced gives the names of Bugess and Kennedy as the April guards. The words II and May" are added after the names in Tester's handwriting. Tester gave as a reason for makingthis alteration, that it was not an unusual thing; and I did not think it necessary to interfere further. I recollect no occasion on which Tester's presence was required at Folkestone on the company's service, except in September, 1851.
Cross-examined by Mr. Serieant BAuLANTLNE.-In one or two instances dar,g the year the guards were coutinued on the same train beyond their prescribed month. I was present when Tester altered the list.
Cross examined by Lr. GIFFARD.-Kennedy's name appears in the list of guards of the mail for March, so that Kennedy acted for the same train for the three consecutive months of March, April. and Mlay.
John Matthews deposed-I assist in the busineas of Mr. Massey, goldsmith, St. Mary Axe, Leadenhall-street. On the 16th of May, 1856, I bought 210 American gold coins. I gave the suiiI of 213.4 1N. in gold for them. The man who brought them asked to be paid in gold. Did not lnow the man, and could not now identify him, I had not sufficient moniey in the shop to pay him with, and I therefore went out and sold the gold in the trade. I got banknotes for it, which I went and cashed. The man stayed in the shop until I returned. I was absent about half-an-hour.
Rudolf Prommel examined.- I am a imoneychanger in the lHaymarket. On the 16th of May I bought 200 American eagles, for which I gavo 2031. 6s. Sd. in a check on the Union Bank, payable at 4, Pall Mall, East. This is the entry of the transaction which appears in my book. I recolect nothing more about it beyond the partioulars I have stated. I cannot recall the personal appearance of the man who brought the coins to me.
The cashing of the check at the Union Bank was proved by Mr. Alexander White, a clerk in that establishment, who deposed that he gave English sovereigns in exchange for it.
Mary Ann Porter, of Harleyfo;d-road, Vauxhall, examined by MIr. BODKIN, proved that she had seen Agar at the Mansion-house, and that she recognized him as Adams, he having tqaken apartments from her in that name in October, 18S54. He had a woman with him at that time (Fanny Kay), who passed as MIrs. Adams. She also knew the prisoner Pierce under the name of Peckham. He frequently visited Agar at her house, and remained often for half-a.-day at a time, orlonger. Agar and the woman lodged with witness about seven weeks, andremoved a week before Christmas. Pierce assisted them to remove.
John Bonner, hairdresser, of Lambeth-walk, deposed, in answer to Mr. Mo.NK, that he knew theprisoner Pierce, and had known him for four or five years. Witness dressed a wig for him when he lived in Walnut-tree-walk, about a month or five weeks before Pierce left that place.
In cross-examination by Mr. PABRY the witness stated that he dressed the wig in question about the end of 1854. He had not dressed many wigs since.
Fanny Poland Kay was then caUed and examined by Mr. Serjeant SE&.-She deposed as follows :-Before I became acquainted with Agar, and some years ago, I was an attendant at the Tunbridge station on the South Eastern Railway. I was first introduced to Agar in 1853 by the prisoner Burgess. Some time after that introduction I became intimately acquainted with Agar, and had a child by him. In Decenmber, 1854, I went to live with him at Cambridge.villsas, Shepherd's-bush. Before that time I had seen Pierce in company with Agar at Harleyford-road, where we lived under the name of Adams, and at the Green Man, in Toolay-street. I have seen them very often together, and I should say that they were weeU acquainted with each other. I had not seen Burgess in company with Agar between the time that he introduced me to him and our going to live at Shepherd's-bush. Pierce I knew by the name of Peckham. I remember my child going to be weaned. He left me for that purpose on the 7th of May, 1855. Charlotte Painter was at that time in our service. A fortnight after the child had been taken to be weaned I went on a Sunday to see it. I remember the death of Mrs. Bessell, our next door neighbour, on the 18th of May, 1855, and I went to see my child after that occurrence. For a few days both after and before that event Agar was absent from home all night. He was so on the Tuesday or Wednesday night before Mrs. Bessel's death. When next I saw him he came in the afternoon in a cart with Pierce, and they then had two bags with them, which they carried into the washhouse. After that Pierce came regularly almost every day, and they usually went then up to the first floor back room. I looked into that room upoai one occasian when they were there together, and I saw that they had got the stove out, and that there was a very bright fire. I opened the door, but was not allowed to go in. They both ran to the door as soon as I opened it, and closed it so as to prevent my entrance. Previous to that they had been a good deal in the washhouse together, sometimes spending the whole of the morning there. I do not know what they were doing there, but I often heard them hammering.; They had shooting bags with them made of drab leather and one black bag. When they were upstairs in the back room, although I saw nothing, I constantly heard a noise, such as proceeds from a furnace; it was like the roaring of a large fire. It continued for several days. After that I saw what appeared to me to be square pieces of stone brought down stairs by Pierce and taken away. When they were working in this way they came down regularly to their meals, and appeared always very hot and dirty. I asked them what they were doing, and they said, " Leatherapron weaving." They never gave me any other answer. I went into the room after their operations had ceased, and I saw that the stove had been replaced and blackleaded. I also noticed that the floor was burnt in two nlaces. About the time that the child was weaned I never saw Agar or Pierce in any peculiar dress. They wore shortish cloaks, or capes of a rather fashionable cut, which they had made for tbem about two months beforethe child was weaned. I never saw Pierce disguised or wearing any other hair than his own to my knowledge, although I have knovn him to have more hair about his face than he has at present. Soon after we removed to Cambridge-villas Pierce left me and went to Kburn, but I did not know where he had gone. Be came to see me, however, before he was arrested, and at that time the child was at Rotherhithe with a cousin of Agar's. From that time until his arrest I did not see him for a con. siderable period. I went, after his arrest, to live inlodgings in St. George's-road, and Pierce provided for me up to January. He was to have allowed me M. a-week, but he did not. He gave me something, but I cannot say how much. I went to live in his house m January, and remained there till April, 1856, when I left in consequence of words with himi. At that time therewere two trunks of Agar's at Pierce's honse. They contained Agar's clothes and tools. I do not know that they contained anything else except his watch, a ring, and some shirt studs. I did not know of any notes or money being there. The first time that I ever saw any considerable amount of money in Pierce's possession was before I went to live at his house. Ithen sawhim with a large bag of sovereigns. Sometime previously to that Pierce told me that he had asked Agar to lend him a sovereign and that he would not. and he added that sometimes he could get money out of Agar, and sometimes he could not. Once in 1854 Pierce asked me to lend him a shilling. Previous to the committal of this robbery Agar used to sell Iiis old clothes to Pierce. At least I suppose he soldithem, for I have heard them bargaining about them, and Pierce used to take them away. After I left Pierce's house in April I fell into distress, and had no meaus of
Mr.Sgerjeant PARRY objected that this was not evidence. Mr. Serjeant SHEx said that his next question would be whether in consequence of that she made a statement to the Governor of Newgate.
Mr. Baron MARITUN.-I don't think that is evidence.
Examination continued.-I asked Pierce for money frequently afterwards, but he refused to give it me. After that I saw Mr. Wetherhead, the Governor of Newgate. and I niade a colomunication to him. I likewise saw v r. Rees, the solicitor to the railway company, and I made a comnun. nication to him also.
Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant PARRY, on behalf of Pierce.-I am 25 years of age. I left the Tunbridge station in 1852. I was dismissed from that situation. It was mot for anything at all dishonest. Yes, I am quite sure of that. I then went to my own^ home, at least to my mother's, in London. I have not lived with other men besides Agar. I wil swear that. I know a person named Tress. I don't consider that my conduct has beenimproperwith him. I kuew a personnamed Hart
for six months probably. I did not live with him, nor was I constantly in his company. He used to come up to town occasionally, but did not stay with me. e h.as given me money-sometimes a sovereign, somuetines twosovereignsat a time. No, never l0s. or 5s., and not for any improper purpose. Be is about 30 years of age, perhaps. Mr. Tress has also given me money. Be gave me 51. once. Neither he nor Mr. Hart is in any degree related to me. I had a very comfortable situation at Tonbridee, and my remuneration was 121. a-year, and board aid lodging. I was not dismissed in consequence of any inproprieties with men. I did not speak to Hart till after I left Tnubridge. Yes, I knew Bill Barber, too. He was an under-guard on the line. He never gave me any money. I wil swear that. I stayed at my mother's till the month of November, I think, having gone there in ApriL I then went to Johnson-street, Somer's-town, and I then worked for Messrs. Crosse and Blackwe31, of Soho-square.
Hart came to see me at my mother's, but t do not mean to say that he ever gave me a sovereign, or a couple of sovereigns, in my mother's presence. Certainly not; he never saw my mother at a1L I was acqu.ainted with Agar at the time that I was living at Johnson-street. I knew him by the name of Adams, and not by any other name. Agar left me twice. He did not say that he left me in consequence of my drunken habits. I was not " in the habit" of getting intoxicated. I will swear I was not. I knew Agar's real name at the time of the christening of my child, which is ratber more than two years ago ; but I did not know it wben I was in Johnson-street. I know a person named Hodges. He used to give me money too-a sovereign at a time-never less; never half-a-sovereign. When I was at Pierce's I was out all night upon two occasions. I never was taken home drunk to Pierce's, and did not quarrel with him on account of my dranken habits. No; I quarrelled with him in consequence of a letter which I received from Agar, and I then left his house.
Will you swear that you were never taken home drunk to Pierceb's -No, I will not swear it, but I don't remember it.
When you were living at Shopherd's-bush, were you ever taken home drunk in a wheelbarrow ?
Witness (smiling).-If 3 was. Idon't recollcet it. Might it have happened 7-Yes-once.
More than once?-No, I will swear that it might not have happened more than once.
Examination continued.-I have not been down to Portland-island, where Agar was confined. I have been sup. ported by the railway company since the firt disclosures which I nade relative to the robbery. They don't allow me anjthing. I get my food and lodging, but not my clotlha. I have been supported in thisway b the company smie last October, probably, but I don't know exactly how
I I kneeg r!:a Perce was what is called a botting ai i
sporting man, but I have not seen money in his possession which he has stted had beet won at races. I never saw him with a betting book, or making up books of anu kind. I will not undert.ko to swear that I did not receive, in all, from Pi)cco as much as 8oO., but I don't think it was so much. I wil swear that it dia not amount to 100Dl Mrs. Pierce haQ not complained of my drunken habits. She ha told me that it was " a pity that I sbould do no," but she said it merely in a friendly way. She never had occasion to complain of me while I was in her house.
Cross-examined by Mr. Ga.=D (for Burgess).-From the time that I was introduced to Agar by Burgess I never but once, I think, saw Burgess in his company, although I lived with Agar for two vears. I did not know Emily Campbell, and did not know that Agar was living with her u,til after he was arrested.
Be-ex amuined by Mr.h Serjeant Ss.-You have been asked a good deal abor,t money given you by different gentlem' n, hsve you anuy objection to say why it was given you?
(No answer.J Was it for any improper purpose ?-No, it
Re-examination continued.-hIr. Hart made honourable proposals to me after I left Tunbridge, and he gave me money at that time. and also after my mother's death. I quarreled with Pierce in consequence of a letter which I received from Agar, and he said that Agar never had any mon. y. I never heard of a sumn of 3,0001. Consols given by Agar to Pierce to be settled on me. Pierce always said that Agar never had any money. The letter which caused us to quarrel was written from Pentonville by ARar on the 2d of April, and in it he asked me to purchase a siver cup for my child and one for Pierce's child, and told me to do several other things, which I could not do because I had no money. Amongotherthings he wanted a" Geography" senthim. Agar said in the letter that " William," meaning Pierce, was to give me the money, and I told Pierce so and his wife too. They refused to let me have it, and I left tbem. Since this case has been under investigation I have been living in the house of Mr. Thornton, the inspector of police,
Mr. Baron MAuTir--What has become of that 3,0001l Consuls? I should like to hear something about that.
Mr. Serjeant PAxRRy.-It is in the hands of the railway company. They have got it.
Mr. BoDEIN.-No such thing. fy friendisentirely misinformed.
Mr. BAron MARTrN-.-If these Consols were Agar's own, and were made over to Kay before his conviction, the railway company can have no earthly claim to them, any more than I have.
Mr. Serjeant PARBY.-A complete explanation of the whole affair can be given by Mr. Wontner, the solicitor, and he is ready at this moment to give it. I hope, however, that my friends will regard him aS a witness caUled for the prosecution.
lr. Serjeant SasEE, however, declined to do so.
Mr. Serjeant PARBBY-Then, I shall not call a witness to rove that 'which I think is perfectly irrelevant to this
Mr. Baron MAARTIN. -No doubt it is mot relevant to this inquiry, but what occurs to my mind is that Consols to the amount of 3,0001. were transferred by Agar to some one for the use of this woman, and that she has never seen the money. I should like to hearsomethinz about it.
Mr. Serjeant SHEE~ said that, under those circumstances, he would not reply upon Mr. Wontner's evidence if he were called.
Mr. Wontner, however, without being called by either side, said that he wished to explain the matter.
Mr. Baron MARTLq.-I think it quite right that you should do so.
MIr. Wontner offered to bo sworn, but
The learned JUDGE said that that was quite unnecessary, Mr. Woutner's word was amply sufllcient.
Mr. Wontner then said, -Previous to Agar's conviction he had 3,0001. Consols, which had been standing in his name for a long time, and he authorized a stockbroker to sell It out. That was done accordingly, and the amount realized was about 2,7001. A number of payments were made out of that sum by Agar's authority, and he directed me to hand over the balance-2,5001-to Pierce to invest for Ray and her child (as we understood). He gave me a written order to that effect, and that order I executed. I subsequently asked Pierce if he bad invested the moneo, and he told me that he had invested it in Turkish bonds. I have since taken the trouble to trace out the notes which were handed over to Pierce, and I find that they correspond with the notes paid in the transaction of the Turkish bonds.
Mr. Baron LRvTIN said that the explanation was perfectly satmsfactory so far as Mr. Wontner was concorned.
At the request of Mr. Serjeant BALLANT1INZ (for Tester) Agar was recalled, and he stated, in answer to questions, that Pierce told him that he had heard from Tester that the key of the safe had been lost on board the Folkestone packet. TO the best of his belief, witness was not on board the packet the night the key was lost.
Charlotte Painter was next caUed and examined. She deposed that she was in the service of Agar and Kay for about a month in the Harleyford-road, and that she went with themu when they removed to Cambridge-villas. She confirmed the evidence as to the intimacy between Pierce and Agar, and as to their proceedings in the washhouse and in the first floor back room in the house at Cambridge-viUas. On one occasion, when Agar and Pierce were in the wash. house together, she knocked at the door and tried to get admission, but they kept the door fastened and said that she could not go in. She had, however, when she bad gone into the washhouse at other times, and when they were not present, seen a vice fixed there, and she had seen a drabcoloured leather bag there, like the one proeduced. It had a long strap to it. In the room upstairs there was a common stove in the grate, which was there as long as she remained. She had also seen white boxes in the washhouse, which she had pushed along in order to sweep under them, and they appeared to be heavy.
Cross-examined by Serjeant P,stBY.-I never saw Pierce doing carpentering work or anything of that sort. He helped to remove the furniture from Ilarleyford-road to Cambridge.villas.
Mary Ann Wild, servant to Mr. Bessell at the time of Mrs. Bessell's death, deposed that she slept in the back room npstairs, and that from the window of her room she could see the window of the washhoute next door, where hfr. and Mrs. Adams (Agar and Fanny Kay) lived. She often heard hammering noises there; and upon one ocCa. sion she saw another man go into the washhouse with Mr. Adams.
Zacchecs Long, of No. 5, Crown-terrace, Hampstead-road, deposed that in December, 1854, Pierce rented the house No. 4, Crown-terrace, from him. and remained there six months, vhen he went to live at No. 3.
John Carter, beer retailer, of Camden-town, proved that Pierce rented No. 3, Crown-terrace, from him in June, 1&55, and that he remained there a month.
John Wood, cab proprietor and driver, badme No. 3,016, remembered in the spring of 1855 being hired a'6out 7 in the evening, and told to pull up near the corner of Crown-terrace. The manwho had caUedhimthenleft him, andsbortly afterwardsreturnedin companywith anotherman. They had, he believed, one leather ana two carpet bags with them. They told him to drive to the London-bndge station. One of the men was, he should say, foar or five inches taller than the other. 'WYhen he got to the London-bridge Hotel the shorter man got out, and the other ordered bim to goto St. Thomasstreet, and to stop near Guy's HospibL The two men wore mantles. Did not observe anything going onw hile he was driving the men, but he observed that the " aetion of the cab" was very different from what it ought to be. The " action" appeared to him as if people were standine up and moving about. The man who left thecab returnedIn about a quarter or half an hour-he could not say which-and they then ordered him back to where they had started from. When be got near the spot, however, they told him to go to the Mother Shipton, which was about 200 or 300 yards from Crown-terrace. About a week afterwards the same man fetched him off the rank near Chalk Farm-it as the shorter man of the two who called him. Could swear that the shorter man was the samne man who had caDed him before, but could not swear that the taller man was the same on both occasions. He drove them the same round as before, and precisely the same events occurred. Similar transactions occurred upon a third occasion, the men bringing their lugg age and cloaks with them as before. Once only witness hEted one of their carpet-bags, and he found that it was heavy-weighing he should think a quarter of a crt., or more. He should say thatall this took place during the latter end of Aprzil, or the beginning of May. The twomen did not appear to witness to be equals. The short man he thought -was valet to the other, and it was the short man wbo always directed him where to go.
Joseph Carter, cabdriver, rending at Brook-street, Camden-town, proved that he also was hired in the same manner about 18 months ago by two men. It was some time in the evening. Agar was one of those persons, " and the further gentleman there" (pointing to Pierce) was the other. They had bags with tbem, and they appeared to him to be heavy. He drove them to St. Thomas-street, where Agar got out and the other man remained. Agar went to theleft, towards the railway-arch. Ee was gone about half an hour; and when he returned he said to Pierce, "It's not going down to-night." He then got into the cab, and witness drove them to the Mother Shipton, wbere theyboth got out, and went in the direction of Crown-terrace, carrying their bags with them. Witness bad frequently seen Agar and Pierce together walking past the rank in King-street, Camden-town. That was witness's usual place of standing, and had been for the last 20 years.
Cross-examined by Mr. PAatrAy.-Never heard anything about this gold robbery until the Friday before he gave information of what he knew at Scotland-yard. He went once to the Mansion-house before he was examined, and the fnrst time that he saw the prisoner Pierce since he drove hin to St. Thomas-street was in the dock at the Mansion-
house. He had not read Agar's evidence neither had he Italked about it to any one.
Fanny Kay was recalled, and in answer to Mr. BOD=N she stated that she remembered Pierce having the lumbago, and being lame duing the time that she lived at CambridgeBy Mr. Serjeant PAsuRy.-I have never stated that before, that I know of.
James Clements deposed that In May, June, and July, 1855, he kept a coffeeshop in High-street, Camden-town
and that he remembered two p nersna going there with a
carpet-bag about the middle of May. One man was taler than the other. O,ae went away, and remained away for some time. He then returned, and the two went away together.
John Allday, a boy, living at Haverstock-hill, proved that he found some shot in Prince's-terrace, which was about a stone's throw from Crown-terrace. The shot was strewed alongside the curb, and witness picked up about a double handful, and several other boysa als picked up some. Did not remember when this was, hut it was a good while ago. The shot was of two or three different smzes, and corresponded with that now produced.
Emma May, formerly servant at the Marquis of Granby,
at New-cross, deposed that she knew the prisoners Burgess and Pierce, both of whom frequented the house while she lived there. They used to go usually between ll and 12 o'clock intho morning, and in the eveningbetween 7 and S. She also knew Agar by sight, and he used often togo there; but witness did not kniow hs name at that time.
Walter Stearn, examined by Mr. Serjeant SBE .-I keep the White Hart, in St. Thomas-street. Pierce and Burgess were in the habit of frequenting my house for three or four years.

I afterwards paid Burgess 8t. Is. Id., which my m-ster gve me for him, as interest on the money which Mr. Lee had given to me,
Mr. Lee, a stoclgobber, examined by Xr. BOD=NE.-I know all the prisoners. Pierce and Bargess I have known for eight or nine years, and Tester for about four years I have seen them together at Stearn's. I purchased 5001. Turkish bonds for 3urgess at the beginning of last year. I paid 4071. lOs. for them. I went to his house at New-cross by his directions for the money, and Mmrs Burgess gave it me; 4051. was in notes. I paid those notes into Messrs. Hutchinso's. I wrote my name on the back of them. The notes produced are the sa.pme notes.
Cros-sexamined by Mfr. Serjeant B&uALLmx.-I never saw Tester at Steam'!s.
Cross-examined by bMr. GiyFyRrD_-I was once in the railwas company's employ, and I always understood that Burgeis had the reputation of being a honest and faithfal servant. Bargess afterwards sold the Turkish bonds, and netted about,501. by them.
MSr. R. H. Bailey, a clerk in the bank-note office of the Bank of England, examined by MIr. BoDxW.-On the 28th of May, 185. six 1001.-notes were Daid out of the Bank to the name of Edgington. They were numbered from 45,420 to 45,425. On the 14th of September, 185I, one of those 10.- notes, No. 45,420, was paid in; it had the name of " Tester" written on it, with the address, Jermyn-street, Iewisham. Another note, 45,422, was paid in on the 11th of Sep. tomber, 1855- it had also the name of "Tester" upon it. The note 45,'e25 was paid in on the 21st of November, 1855. It had the names of *"affan" and "Fisher" on it.
Cross-examined by MEr. Serjeant BALA2fns. -The two notes with Tester's name on them were issued on the 9th of Januay 1856.
irKnig,ht'recalled.-The signature on these two notes is sn Tester's handwriting.
George Raffan, a fruiterer, examined by Mr. Seijeant Sasx5.-Some time ago Pierce asked mie to change a 1001.- note for him. I wrote my name on it, and took it to a man named Fisher, who gave me small notes for it. On another occasion Pierce got me togo to the Bank of EDgland to get 200 sovereigns for notes which he rave me.
Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant ARY.-I was then in Pierces employment, getting 30s. a-week from him. He kept a betting-house, and had considerable betting transactions. I have often seen him with large sums of money in his2 esion derived from betting transactions,-as much
Re-examined by Mr. Seoreant SEr=.-It was about spring time, 1855, tha' I first saw Pierce with so much money. Early in that ye-ir I took a pair of boots out of pledge for him.
To Mr. Serjeant PARuY.-I know that Pierce had a book of more than 1001. on the St. Leger the year Saucebox won.
Mr. Smith, cashier to Messrs. Reid, the brewers roved the receipt of the money from Mr. Stearn.
Mr. Young, a stockbroker, examined by Mr. Serjeant SHEY.-In August and November, 1854, I purchased SpanLsh bonds for Agar in the namo of Adams. There were three bonds, and their numbers were 1,658, 1,084, and 2,675. They were to the amount of 7.551.
Mr. James Page, examined by Mr. Seijeant SiEE.-I am related to the prisoner Tester by marriage. The Spanish bond produced I held for Tester until very lately, when I gave it up to the solicitor for the prosecution. Tester told me that his possession of it was perfectly legitimate.
Mr. Forrester, a stockbroker, examined by Mr. Serjeant SHis.-I purchased the bond produced in February, 1856, for Mr. William Tester, the father of the prisoner. I purchased it with the proceeds of other Spanish bonds which Mr. Tester brought us to sell. The bond purports to be for 1,0201. Its value at 52 per cent. discount would be about 4891. I have had various dealings with Mr. Tester, the father, and always looked upon him as a highly respectable man.
Kr. W. C. Furney, a clerk in the Bank of England, proved the payment in May last of six 1001. notes, numbered 45,420 to 45,425 inclusive. The name given at the time was Edrgiton, Duke-street.
Mr. Griffin, also a clerk in the Bank of England, proved the exchange of the 1001.-note, 45,422, endorsed wi th e name of Tester, for sovereigns.
Mr. Francis, of the firm of Edgington and Co., Dukestreet, was called to show that no person had been sent by their firm to exchange goldfornotes to the amount of 6001. during the month of Alay, 185a.
Mr. Lee, recalled, stated that in March last he got a Spanish bond, numbered the same as the one left by Agar in his trunk when arrested, sold for Pierce.
Air. Cousins, a stockbroker, who sold the bond, also gave evidence to the same effect.
Mr. Rees, solicitor to the South-Eastern Railway Company, examined by Mr. BoDXLS.-I am the solicitor for the prosecution, and have conducted the whole of this investigation. In consequence of what I heard from Agar I went up to Kilburn-viUa (Pierce's residence) on the day of Pierce's arrest. The house has a garden in front, and leading from the front door is a flight of steps. Underneath those steps is a pantry, and on searching in that pantry I found that the ground bad been disturbed and a hole had been dug, and in place of the natural clay it had been flled up with cinders. I should say that it had only recently been filed up, for there were green leaves in the cinders and the claw of a lobster quite fresh. In the house were Turkish bonds to the amount of2,0001., leases, deeds, and securities of different sorts. The green tool-box was in the attic. I also went to Cambridge-villas, Shepherd's-bush(Agar's residence,where the gold was melted down). I had the grate in the back bedroom removed, and behind it I found the three firebricks which have been produced and identified by Agar. The chimney bore evident marks of having been subjected to great heat. The floor between the fireplace and the window was very much burnt. I had the boards taken up, and underneath were a number of small bits of gold, which had evidently run through the floor. When saw the man Agar at Portland I did not say anything to him about what I had seen at his house.
Cross-examined by Mr. GIPFARD.-It was about the middle of October when Agar made the statement.
F. Williamson, a detective officer, examined by Mr. Serjeant SsiE.-I went with Mr. Rees to Kilburn-villa, and, besides the property mentioned by him, I found there a gold watch and chain, which I produce. The watch has a representation of Windsor Castle on the dial, and the initials
'E. R. A." on the back. There were also betting-books and some I 0 U's taken from Pierce's house.
This concluded the case for the prosecation.
Mr. Serleant PABBy said that before addressing the jury for Pierce he should like to have the opinion of the Court whether there was evidence on the list count, which indicted Pierce for larceny as a servant of the company; and also whether he could be properly said to have been a receiver. The third count charged him with robbery from a dweling-house, but he apprebended that a railway carriage could scarcely be called a welling-house.
MIr. Baron MARTin said that Mr. Justice Willes and himself were both of opinion that it was clearly disproved that Pierce was a servant of the company at the time of the robbery. On that count of the indictment there was no evidence to go to the jury. His learned brother and himself were also of opinion that Pierce could not be called a receiver. As to the third count there would scarcely be any necessity to trouble the jury on that.
The Court then adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow (this) morning, the jury being reconducted to the London Coffee-house under the charge of the officers of the Court.
It was arranged that the trial of Redpath should be taken on Friday morning.
The Workhouse And The Prison.
THE WORKHOUSE AND THB PRISON.
Tho following suggestions are proposed to be embodied in a report to the Quarter Sessions, for the consideration of the committee in relation to criminal jurisprudence:-
" L That although in grave offences, especialy offences against the person, it is necessary that the punishment anould be certain and severe, yet in small offences, with a view to avoid the increase of convicted felons, it is denirable to carry out the powers given to the magistrates by the 18th and 19th of Victoria, chp. 126, and to avoid convictions of felony and imprisonment whenever the interests of society may appear to be best promoted by so doing.
" 2. That offences against workhouse riues should in general be punished by other means than imprisonment in a upmin prison; ,an that greater facilities for obta'inis reief should be anorded to the poor and destitute, as le
as to discharged prisoners, to prevent their committing offences in order to procure an asylum.
"3. That power should be given to the magistrates to send young persons -who my be brought before them to an industrial school, without a previous conviction of any offence, under similar regulations to those adopted in Scotland, by the 17h an1th -of Victoria, chap. Sct4ud b
" 4. That the law should be altered regarding simple larceny of limited amount, declaring such offence not to be felony, but a trespass to be punished by fine; and for a third offence the offender to be declared a common thief, and sentenced to such punishment in addition to the fine as shall be declared by the statute. Theparty injured to have compensation ount of the penalty paid, and the remainder to go to the Crown in lieu of felons' goods and chattels.

The West India Steamer Tyne.
i THE WEST IBDIA STEAMEB TYN].
SOUTHAMPTON, WEDN6ADAY.
There appears to be very little hopo of saving thi6 smfortunate vessel, jadging from the scraps of information w1ich have reached us from time to time during the day. A con. siderable portion of the baggage, however, and a small part of the cargo hava been rescued, and ardved here about half-past 4 o'eloek this afternoon in the Aid, steam-tug, which left the Tyne aboat half-past 10 in the lnorning. There were then five tues there rendering assistance, besides Her Majesty's steam-frigate Devastation, the paddle-box lifeboats of which were of great use in keeping up communication between the Tyne and the tugs. From inquiries made on board the Aid, we ascertained tha' there were 2 feet of water in the steamer's saloon at high water, and that the boilers had moved about 6 inches forward when the ship struck, and the steam-pipe had also burst. A Coastguardman was unhappily drowned last night by the swamping of a boat r.e it wm going from the shore to the ship. 1'.art of the crew of the Orinoeo, who had gone down to render assistance, have returned in the Aid. The crew of the Tyne came up from Wareham by railway this afternoon.
One of the Tyne's officers arrived here early this morning, by the first train from Wareham, who reported that vhen he left the ship late last night she was lying upright, end on, her rudder knocked away and sternpost started. The water flowed in and out of the after compartment of the ship. Captain Valler and the whole of the officers aud crew left for the shore last night, it not being considered sfe for any one to remain on board aU night, and a watch was kept up on the beach.
We had the opportanity of a long conversation to-day with one of the Tyne's passengers, Mr. William Lilley, from America, late lUnited States' consul at Pernambuco; and from his explanations we are able to supplement our accunt of yesterday, and correct one or two statements re'ative to the accident. It was first understood and reported that the steamer ran aground while at full speed. This gentleman states that the engines were redaced to half. speed at 11 o'clock on Monday night, and again at 1 o'clock in the morning to about quarter-speed, or perhaps a little mnre; in addition to which the vessel was stopped every two hours for soundings to be taken. About 1 o'clock he was conversing with Captain Valier in his cabin, and, in answer to Mr. Litley's inquiries as to whereabouts they were, the captain pointed out on the chart where they were if his calculations were correct, and he then went on deck, stopped the engines, again took soundings, and found that he was right. The first time the ship struck the shock was slight, a second shock much more violent, and then a third not quite so bad. Mfr. Lilley was awoke by a fellow-passenger (Dr. Ribeiro) when the ship fist struck, and after tho third bump he was drawing on his socks, when a lurch of the ship threw him forward on his head. The ship was soon in a state of great -alrm and confusion-everybody rushing on deck, the ladies in their night-dresses in terrible alarm, and the darkness and gloom adding to the terror which prevailed. The bumping of the ship kept on for four hours at least, and began to ease after 8 o'clock in the morning. For an hour after the Tyne grounded, Mr. Lilley states, nothing could be seen, the night was so thick and hazy. The ladies were on deck wrapped up in blankets. He left the ship in the afternoon, in charge of the ladies int a lifeboat, and came on from Wareham to Southampton last night. When he left the vessel she was making water fast, and the after-compartment was fiUed with water. She was In an upright position, grinding heavily, and, in our informant's opinion, evidently on a rock, making a berth for herselL He believes that if she had been a wooden vessel not a soul would have been saved, as it would have been perfectly useless to attempt to lower a boat before daylight, the haze being so thick as to prevent them seeing what course to take, and the surf and swell being exceedingly violent. They fired gauns and threw up rockets, but received no answer. When daylight broke they saw a high bluff land rising up just before them. The captain behaved throughout with the greatest coolness and intrepidity, and was dosirons of attempting to land the passengers early in the morning, but a Coastguard boat which came off remonstrated, and the attempt was not made until the middle of the day when the landing was effected in safety, although one or two of them had an unpleasant immersion by the boats swamping.
IMr. LiUey and all the rest of the passengers whom we bave seen speak in the highest terms of Lord Eldon's praiseworthy condact in providing for the comfort of the passengers and crew. His Lordship provided them with food and lodging at his estate, and, after using every horse and vehicle ho had, sent to Wareham for a couple of omni. buses to transfer them from the shore to the railway station.
The Tyne, as we stated yesterday, is one of the strongest of the company's fleet, and her value was about 80,0001. The company's vessels are not insured, a reserve fund for the purpose being set apart from a portion of earnings.
Should the attempts to recover this noble vessel fail, as there is strong reason to fear they will, this will make the ninth steamship the company have lost since their formation,-viz., the Medina, wrecked on Tark's Island; the Isis, foundered off Bermuda; the Solway, lost off tho coast of Spain; the Actseon, on the Spanish Main; the Tweed, on the Alacrane's rocks, in the Gulf of Mexico; the Forth, on the same rools; the Amazon, burnt at sea; the Tay, wrecked on Cape Roxo, in the Gulf of Mexico; and now the Tyne, off St. Alban's Head. In addition to these, one of their small schooners was lost, and the Demerara, built at Bristol, it will be remembered, broke her back in going down the Severn before she was out of the builder's hands.
The Crystal Palace.
THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
The exhibition of poultry, held for the first time in the Crystal Palace, closed yesterday evening after a continuance of four days, and it is understood that the executive body are so well satisfied with the result that thoy have resolved to repeat the experimnent at the beginning of next year. The general public seem to have appreciated the exhibition, for nearly 20,000 of them have visited the Palace within the four days on Lwhich it was held, whereas during the whole of the preceding week, though it was partly a holyday time, the aggregate number of visitors was only 6,358; in other words, the average daily attendance during the poultry show was not far short of that of the whole previous week Again, in money taken at the doors while the exhibition lasted, not to mention season tickets, the company would appear to have realized about 7501 As some indication of the value of the exhibition, as giving an impetus to the rearing of poultry of the purest breed-that being one of its main objects-it may be stated that the sua taken in sales of specimens exhibited amounts to upwards of 6001&, one gentleman alone being a purchaser to the extent of 1641b With respect to the rule which obtained at this, as at similar exhibitions in the country, requiring exhibitors in all cases to affix a price to the specimens they send, and which has given rise to some little dissatisfaction, it ought to be explained that the R1ev. Lyon Fellowes, who was named as having, with several other exhibitors, attached a prohibitory price to most of the birds shown by him, only availed himself of the liberty guaranteed to every exhibitor under the same rale, when, as was Mr. Fellowes's case, he is indisposed to part with the specimens he furnishes for exhibition.
It may be added, touching the programme at the Palace for the forthcoming season, so far as it is yet developed, that the directors have made arrangements for a second series of concerts by the artistcs of the Royal Italian Opera company, on a scale of at least equal attraction to those of last year, and that, as on the former occasion, the concerts wil be held on successive Fridays during the season. The
eat event of the year, however, will be the Grand Handel dusical Festival, which will take place in May. The airangements for this ceremony will, it is said, be on a scale greatly beyond anything of the kind ever before undertaken. It wMi be held in the central tranBept of the Palace, which will be completely fitted up for the purpose, and be of three days' duration. The committee of the Sacred Harmonic Society will have charge of the musical arrangements. A large organ for the occasion is in course of erection, and the orchestra and chorus will consist of 2,300 practised and thoroughly efflCient performers. As h generas y known, the festival is intended to be a preliminary to a grand musical commemoration in 1859 of the centenary of the death of Handel. For the present, and in tbe meantime, the concerts of classical and romantic instrumental music by the company's band, which, under the direction of M. lanns, has now attained to so high a pitch of excellence, will be continued on Fridays and Saturdays in each week. There will also be two flowver shows in the course of the season, one in May and the other in September.

The Peninsular and Oriental Companys steamshipo Madrid, Captain G. Bradshaw, arrived this morring witlr the mails from the Peninsular ports, in chargo of Lieutemant Tickell, R.N., Admiralty agent, and dates from Gibzaltar to January fi; Cadiz, January 6; Lisbon, January 9; and Vigo, January 10. She called off Oporto, and remnained nearly three hours, but could not communicate. Across the BaY Of B'iscay the Madrid encounterod strong westerly winds, with a beavY sea, and up channel a strong north-easterly gale, r!tih very heavy head-sea.
The steamer brittgs 17 passengers (seven first-class, five tecond-class, and five dock), U3 packages of specie (value .0,0171. sterling), and a cargo consisting of 146 chests ann 71 barrels of orang-'s 99 boxes of dates, 127 boxes of eggs, 10 casks of wine, a *I '1;, packages of general merchandise.
Lisbon exchanges for three months are quoted for this packet-London, 52j; Paris, 537; Amsterdam, 41 ; Hambarg, 46.1; Genoa, .32?. Paper was very scarce on London, and few takers; on tiie continent it was likewise scarce, but in demand. The st'rw miarket was rather du3L Three per Cents. registered 45 to 451 ; Coupons, 44j to 45; Deferred, 24i to 25; Bank of Portugal shares, 509 to 511 mnilreis; Bank of Oporto sh-ares, 19 to 20 per cent. premium.
The following is our Lisbon correspondent's letter of the 9th inst.:-
" The King of Portugal's speech upon opening the new Legislature, oni the 2.i, of which I send a translation, will probablv have resch-d vou earlier rid France. We have seldom 'been so ivany days without a steamer for England, and this time even tbe Royal mail packet Tyne, expected from the Brazils. is behind her correct time. You will observe the young King of Portugal pays in his speech a just tribute to tht, Englilh people and Government for the very liberal succour atS,rded by them to the islands of Made6ra and Cape \'erd during the lateinvasionof the cholera.
" Their Majestips Donk Pedro and the Ex-Regent Donm Fernando, acco.unpaukd bythe Duke of oporto,paidAdmiral Dundas a visit on board the Dake of WPellington on Wednesday last, wbere they partook of a a recherche' dej,ilner, and employed nearly ttree hours in inspecting the vessel and exercise of the crew. Tteir Majesties seemed much pleased with the ship, where the British Minister, Mr. Howard, the Russian, French. and Austrian Ambassadors were invited to meet them, as al:o the captains of the other ships of war in the Tagas, and Mr. Consul Smith. The Austrian frigate.Radetzky had likewise been similarly honoured by a Royal visit a few days previously.
I It is hardly necesrary to state that the proceedings of the Cortes are, so far. devoid of interest, the House of Deputies being occnpied with the preliminaries necessary for the approval of the el.etions, in respect to which the three committees gave in to-day reports in favour of the majorityof the electoralcircle,. which do not include Beija, CasteLlo, Branco, and Lanmego, wvhere some irregularities are said to, exist, as also in respect to the Legitimist deputy, M. Elario, whose election for BrLga is likely to be annulled.
" Mr. Scott Russell recently paid Lisbon a visit, for thepurpose of pushing forward the Royal Portuguese Steaux Company, which haS SO long been on the tapis between Portuguese and English projectors, for the purpose of establishing steam lines between Portugal and the Azores. Coast of Africa, &c.. and by the las' packet one of theLisbon directors, Mr. J. H. Fradesso da Silveira, left for England, as reported, upon the same affairs; but, unfortunately, he left his own in so precarious a state here that. his house suspended payments almost immediately after the packet left. A meeting of creditors was held yesterday, when it appeared he owes about 20,0001., and I was told by one of the sufferers that their hopes of ultimate payment depend in part upon the carrying out of the Royal Portuguese Steam Company, in which, it is said, the Government will take the large number of shares which have not met with applicants in this country.
" M. Fradesso was formerly employed in the Department. of Public Works, and has only recently appeared on 'Change as a mercantile man; but his intelligence and activity enabled him to take a prominent part in the commercial association, and the fact of his having so soon extended his business to 20,0001. proves he had in a short period ac uired considerable credit. It was also to AL Fradesso andl Mr. Pro3t, of Paris, that the Commercial Union Company of Lisbon was recently transferred by the shareholders and reorganized as a Credit Mobilier Company, by Royal decree.'

i'AIUA, 'X5DAY, JAN. 13, 6 P.M.
The Constitationnel, in an article which has all the appearance of emanating from an offioial source, confirmk in great part the account I gave you yesterday of the state of the n,euchtel question. There are a fen points n i my letter not touched by the l'oneitationnel, but wl ich I have reason to believe iPre quite as correct as those that are, The English Government never called in doubt, throughout the whola of the negotiation, the right of the Confederation to bring to trial the seditious citizens of one of its cantons, and its joining in a demand for their liberation would have had the appearance of ealling it in doubt. The Swiss Government
as satipulated for the " entire independence" of Neuchatel, and the liberation of the prisoners is declared by it to be in the exercise of her sovereignty. The question may now be conttiderec as settled; and, whatever discussion may arise in the Federal Assembly, it is not anticipated that any serious difficulty will be started. Switzerland occupies a proud position. Her course has been firm and dignified, and she was not turned from it nor daunted by the momentary ill-humour of Prance, for which reparation is now made. The Swiss have shown that self-reliance is, after all, the best security for existence, and that a people who are determined to maintain their independence at any cost will succeed in the end.
But Switzerland, free and independent, and justly proud of the reputation she has acquired, has, in turn, a duty to perform. Let her do her best to put a stop to the trade in blood which some of her children still carry on in Europe in the support of tyranny. While Switzerland deserves praise for the stand she has made against the attempt to oppress her, it is a shame that her sons shouid continue to wear the livery of a tyrant, and that they, the children of a free soil, should still enable hio to oppress those who love liberty quite as much as the Swiss.
The following address has been circulated amono
the Swiss soldiers in the service of the King of I Naples and the Pope. It is printed in three lan- I guages, on the same page, in parallel columnsItalhan, German, and French. It is headed "Italian National Party-Independence and Unification," and bears date "Italy, the 10th January :"-
" Swiss,-Your country is in danger, and you, instead Of defending its liberty, defend the tyranny of the Bourbon Of Naples and the Pope.
* The Prussians are already putting themselves in motion to invade your country, and you remain at Naples and Rome to aid those who oppress ours. In Switzerland iyou would be sc'diers covered vith glory; here you are dishonoured sbim, and, while you might use your arms for the defence of that independence which your fathers have purchased at the price of their blood, you employ them to uphold slavery. Shall the sons of William Tell be assassins in the pay of Ferdinad IL and of Cardinal Antonelli ?
"Many Itaians have already offered their services to your country. Say, while they are fighting for Switzerland, have you the courage to fSght against Italy?
"Hasten where your country calls you. There is glory; h,ere is infamy. Thcre is the blessing of your parents, of your wives, and of all free men; here is the malediction of the women and children of Italy, whom you will render widows and orphans-the malediction of the whole eivilized world.
" Choose now between the glorious laurels of Sempach, of Graason, of Morgarten, of Morat, and the infamous laurels of Naples and Messina. Return to your valleys, to your mountains, and you shall be accompanied by our prayers, and the blessing of the God of Battle, who is the OCod of the soldiers of liberty, and not the God of the satellites of tyrants."
The following telegraphic despatch has been received
"MARSEILLES, JAN. 13.
"Accounts from Constantinople of the 5th state that the British squadron had been apprised of its approaching departure; nevertheless, it will continue to occupy the Black Sea until the Austrians evacuate the Danubian provinces. For that reason Lord Lyons has sent to alta for provisions.
" The British fleet in the Persian Gulf is hastening its operations, in order to have them terminated before three muonths, the period of the excessive heats. The English are inciting the Governors of the provinces to separate from the Shah. The Shah is making great preparations for defence, inotwithstanding the penury of his finances and the fear of reyolt. The Persian army had taken possession of all the towns situate on the road to Candahar.
"The Russian flotiUla in the Caspian Sea had already landed troops in the Persel Islands, alleging the ancient treaties of alliance between Russia and Persia.
" The Russian Ambassador Anuikoff had quitted Teheran, it was said really charged with a mission to demand assistance for Persia at St. Petersburg."
The Patrie announces, on the authority of a letter from Kalisch, that the troops of the last Polish levy but one have received orders to leave immediately for the Caucasus. It is believed they are to reinforce the corps of observation of 40,000 men which it is asserted is assembled on the extreme frontier of Persia. " It appears," adds the Pathie, " that serious operations are expected in the beginning of spring, to counterbalance the probable results of the English expedition to the Persian Gulf."
The Moniteur de la Flotte contains thefollowing description of Komrat, which has been ceded to Russia by the late treaty, and which is not to be found in any geography -
* Komrat is a town in Bessarabia, situate on the right bank of the Yalpuck, at about 65 versts from Bolgrad, in the zone comprised between that stream of water and the Pruth. This town did not exist in the year 1812, when the peace of Bucharest was signed, which annexed Bessarabia to the Russian empire. It is built on the ground formerly occupied by the village of Arka, celebrated for being the birthplace of Prince Bessaraba, who first reigned over that country, and gave his name to Bessarabia. The town of Komrat occupies the third rank after that of Kischenew, the chief town in the province. By the treaty of March, 1856, it was to have been given to Moldavia by the Emperor of Russia. The Russian Government proposes to transfer the seat of government of the Bulgarian colonies to Komrat, and to establish a Custom-house there, which establishment has been hitherto at Bolgrad. The Bulgarian colonies in Bessarabia are prosperous, and comprise altogether 35 villages."

RUSSIA.
The Nerd publishes the text of a despatch addzesed by Prince Gortschakoff, theRussianMinister Or Foreign Affairs, under date the 30th of December last, to Baron Budberg, the Russian Envoy at Vienna, in rely to a commuication fromVienna on the Nieuchhtel question. It says:
' We fully share, .I. Ie Baron, the opinion of the Vienna Cabinet as regards the perfect legality of the rights claimed by-His Majesty the King of Prussia-rights guaranteed by the act of the Congress of Vienna and solemnly sanctioned by.the protocol of London.
"' We do not the less desire to see a pacific settlement of the question. The counsels we have all along given to the Berlin Cabinet have been with that object in view; and we have een with dncere satisfaction that the Prussian Governm7t.u&after keeping constantly in the path of modera-
tioa,Fwmi4p p;eparing at the same time for more efficacious rceas pt kept open a door to conciiation.
"' Neveithkless, M. 1e Baron, we derive from the very ciraunsts±ces which gave rise to the NeuchUtel affair in Septemaber 1aftWth conviction that itis our duty to leave thae Government of His Majesty the King of Prussia perfectly at liberty to appreciate what its dignity, its rights, and its ntnreats demand."
The despatch then enters into a discussion of the London Protocol, to show that all the recoent measures adopted by Prussia were justifiable,
Ai regards the attempted Royalist insurrection at NeuchMel, the despatch says:-
M Moreover, some devoted subjects of the King of Prussia having recently attempted to overthrow the defaPco Go-
vernment existing at Nealch*te and.to estore theauthcrlty of their legitimate Soverlgn,Athey wero eihed, ill-treated sent into a severe imprisonme6th and submitted to the juridiction of the de facto authorities at &Teuchi_teL
" HisM ajesty the King of Prmssi coild not remain indifferent to such acts nor abandon the defenders of bis cause His Majesty demanded the immediate liberation of the Royalist prisoners. But he deemed that his dignity required that he should insist that they should be liberated unconditionally before entering into any ulterior negotiation; and it is only after having exhausted all the means of conciliationin his power, and on theobstinate refusal of the Helvetic Government to comply with that demand, that His Majesty has come to the conclusion that he must necessarily have recourse to more efficacious measures thian a purely diplomatic intervention.
" The Imperial Cabinet cannot but admit that in acting thus His Majesty the King of Prussia has remained within the strict limit of his rights. It therefore does not think that the slightest restraint should be put upon the freedom of action of His Majesty, whatever may be the measures he may think fit to employ to obtain the satisfaction he Ask$ for,
"In our point of view if the Powers which siged the Lohdon protocol, equally anxious to procure a peaceful solution of this question, feel themselves called upon to intervene, their action should be brought to bear, in virtue of the engagements contracted, upon the Federal Council, so as to make the Helvetic Government hearken to the voice Of justice and of reason.
" Such is, M. le Baron, the constant object of the efforts which we have not ceased to prescribe to our Minister at Berne, and we are persusded that, on its side, the Austrian Government will not refuse to shar them."
THE NEUCHATEL QUESTION. (0ma OUR OWN COPOwD>Tr.)
BERLIN, JAN. 12.
In a very few days the Neuch&tel affair will have entered a new and decisive pbae; either a pacific one, by the Swiss Federal Asembly empowerng the Federal Council to accept the terms that have been agreed upou by its special Envoy and the Emperor Louis Napoleon, on the assumption that they will be agreeable to the King of Prussia; or a warlike one, by its rejection of them, and the consequent mobilization of the Prussian army. EB attendant,and in the hope that I may thus take leave of this most unsatisfactory affair, I send you herewith a succinct summary of the diplomatic steps that have been taken in the matter since September 3 of last year, as far as they have become known to me. I take this date as a starting point, assuming that all the preceding incidents of the Prusian Neucbatel history are by this time well knownsuch as the King's recovery of the Principality of Neuchatel in 1814, by the varying fortunes of the campaign against Napoleon; the confirmation of it to him by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, and the simultaneous introduction of its cantonal relation to the Federal Government; the rejection of the King's sovereignty in 1848, and the assumption of a new Federal Constitution in Switzerland; the recognition of the King's right of sovereignty by the Great Powers in 1852; and the risinog of last September, for the purpose of reinstating the King's sovereignty.
Within a few days after that miniature attempt at Royal restoration, the King caused his representative at Berne to renew his former protests on the subject of his sovereignty over the Principality of N euchhtel, accompanied by a demand for the liberation of the Royalists taken prisoners in that affair. The Federal authorities rejected thb protest, and met the demand for the liberation of the prisoners by an assurance that they should be well treated and fairly tried. In that same month of September Austria and Russia, by their Ministers, made representations to the Swiss Federal Government in favour of an inimediate and unconditional liberation of the prisoners; France did the same, with the additional promise of the Emperor's kind offices in behalf of Switzerland, if it complied with his request. England, on the other hand, did not co-operate with the other Powers in requiring the liberation of the prisoners, but simply called upon Switzerland to state what terms she could accept as the basis of negotiations to be opened. The terms which the Federal Council demanded in reply to these applications of both France and England were, that simultaneously with the liberation of the prisoners guarantees should be given for the removal of all foreign claims to sovereignty over Neuchatel.
In the mean time Prussia resolved to apply to the German Bund to add its countenance and authority to the recognition of the King's rights, contained in the London protocol of 1852, and towards the close of the month of September gave notice to Austria of her intention to do so. About the same time the King applied also to the Emperor Louis Napoleon for his personal intervention in the matter, the attitude of England precluding at that time any expectation of a joint action of the two Governments of England and France. In her answer to the above-mentioned intimation Austria acknowledged to Prussia (October 8) that the King was entitled to claim the liberation of the prisoners as the indispensable preliminary to any arrangement of the NeuchAtel affair, and expressed her belief that the Swiss authorities would not fail to see that to punish men for' endeavouring to roinstate a thoroughly recognized monarchical right would extremely enhance the difficulty of arriving at any arrangement. Austria hoped and trusted further that Switzerland would comply with this preliminary condition, and promised to send her representative in Berne such instructions as should leave the Swiss Government no doubt as to what oreat importance she attached to its fulfiment ; and added at the close, that in the same way as Prussia was wisely conscious of the risk entailed upon the peace of Europe by anything like threats towards Switzerland, Austria was of opinion that the Bund should refrain from every ting like menace, unless in concert with the Great Powers of Europe. In conformity with these views the German Bund, October 30th, adopted the recognition of the King's rights contained in the London protocol of 1852, and undertook to back the Prussiandemands for the hberation of the prisoners by means of the various representatives of German States re3sding at Berne. The intended threat of ulterior measures in case of refusal was, however, dropped. It was not ti the second half of the foUowingmonth (November) that the Prussian demands for the liberation of the prizoners were categorically repeated in Berne, backed by all the representatives of German Powers resident there. They were, however, as before, rejected by the Swiss Federal Council.
While these negotiations were going on in Germany France was active enough in endeavouring to execute the mission the King had committed to the Emperor's hands; and at length England set to work by herself to bring about an arangement; but, as she left out of her account the one sole
demand on which the whole affair turned, viz., the I liberation of the prisoners, her exertions had no result, and her proposals were never laid before the King. The Emperor Louis Napoleon proposed to Switzerland, through General Dufour, that she should at his request lIberate the prisoners; if she would in so doing repose her fate in his hands, he would on his part do all in his power to procure a solution of the difficulty that would be acceptable and honourable to Switzerland; and at the very least he would keep Prussia from sending any armed force against Switzerland. If Switzerland did
not agree to his proposals, he would not trouble himself with the matter any further, and would offer no opposition to a Prussian army being stationed on the Swiss frontier. General Dufour, on repairing to Paris in consequence of theso overtures, was instructed to declare that Switzerland could not agree to an unconditional liberation of the prisoners, not even on condition of the Emperor's using his bons offires, since she had no guarantee that, the prisoners once liberated, Prussia would not come forward with perfectly unacceptable demands with regard to the sovereignty. As the nearest approach to a guaranteefor the abrogation of the sovereignty over NeuchAtel, Switzerland stipulated for a common agreement to be entered into jointly by France and England. The latter, however, was not only loth to CO-Operate in support of the King of Prussia's demands, but was also unwilling to negotiate on the same basis as Franee, which presupposed a knowledge of. theKing of Prussia'sulterorintentions-; this caution, it was averred, was the more necessary as Switzerland seemed to assume that if she liberated the prisoners the King would renounce his rights: England would not be justified in confirm*ing her in that assumption, seeing thatno comraunication made by Prassia gave ground for it, and she was totally uninformed of Prussis'a future intentiOnIS. .Tbe Swiss endeavour, therefore, to unite iranee sad England in a joint guarantee failed, and General Dufour returned to Borne.
Towards the end of November the Emperor Louis
Napoleon made another attemptonhiasoleaaccount; he strongly i-rged SwitzerIaud to hberate, the prisoners unconditionally in virtue of her ow,sove. reiguty; if ahe did 'this he wouid exert himself to the utmost to procure the King's cession of his i sioverNeuchAandValengin, andSwitzerland domg this would be looked on as a token of a Coal eiliatory spirit in no way derogatory to her dignity. Switzerland, however, refused on this occasion ais7 to give way, on the plea that it was not clear that the Emperor was sufficiently well informed of the intentions of the Eing of Prussia; she maintainae that the smallest guarantee she could be satisfied with was a declhaution on the part of the Emperor that the Prussian conditions were not opposed to Neuchters entire emancipation. This was the close of the second act, and France withdrew fur the moment from all further attempts, as England had already done after her own failure; a sort of attempt made subsequently bZy the, Swiss Minister in Paris to open negotiations with this Prussian Minister there came also to nothing, for want of the first essential to the negotiations, viz., the liberation of the prisoners, not having yet been compled with.
The third phase of the afair commences with Prussia's informing the four great Powers, December 8, that now that all attempts at a settlement by diplomatic means have proved fruitless, she finds herself driven to have recourse to military means; but the door should still be kept open for pacific intervention of any kind, based on the preliminary liberation of the prisoners, up to the time that might be found necessary for isuing the order for the mobilization of the army. This eame depateh was subsequently (December 18) laid before the German Bund, with the further declaration that Prussia had already entered into negotiations with the Southern States of Germany for the free passage of her troops to the Swiss frontier. On the 16th of that month the Prussian Minister accredited to the Federal Government had also been ihstructed to break off all further diplomatic relationapwith Switzerland. The result of these measures was that the Swiss Federal Asembly was convoked at once, and military preparations were set on foot in Switzerland. The Moniemur on the 17th read Switzerland a lecture on the impropriety of her continuing to reject the Emperor's propa and good offices, and held out that, in case of her continuing refractory, she had nothing more to expect from himi. France having thus openly expressed her withdrawal from al further mediation, England nade some fresh advances towards the continental view of the question, and seems, in the course of a diplomatic interchange of ideas with France$ to have admitted the conviction that the liberation of the prisoners was under all circumstances, an essential preliminary.
At this tine Austrian diplomacy entered on a fresh tack. In a despatch of the 19th of December, in answer to the Prussian of the 8th of that month (declaring the necessity of military measures), Austria pointed out that, as the Great Powers of Europe had had no opportunity of speaking out collectively since the rising in NeuchAtel on the 3d of September, it was incumbent on Prussia to defer having recourse to arms till after the Great Powers had issued their dictum, in conference assembled. This was, in fact, endesvouring to bring on a debate on the main question, while Prussia was stiU insisting on the previous question.
In another despatch of the 25th of that month Austria pointed out also the necessity of all negotiitions for the passage of Prussian troops through German Federal territory being submitted to the cognizance and the deliberations of the Diet. In Berne also the Austrian Minister was instructed not to join in a collective note of all the Powers interested and addressed to Switzerland, on the plea that Austria could be no party to any undertaking which had for its object to constrain a Sovereign to give up a recognized right. France refused so to join in this collective note, expressing at the same time the Emperor's intention to put forward his own proposals to Switzerland, in which the other Powers might join if they chose. At this conjuncture the Swiss Federal Assembly met, December 27, snd the commission appointed to deliberate on the subject expressed in its report the hope that " the Federal Council would avail itself of the propitious state of things to proc-ure an honourable arrangement by pacific means." Dr. Kern, the Pre3ident of the National Council, was despatched to Paris, in company of the ordinary Swiss representative there, for the purpose of carrying out, this recommendation; and the trial of the prisoners was soon afterwards fixed to come on on January 19.
In the meantime Prussia had met Austria's suggestion of a conference, as a preliminary to military action by showing, in a despatch dated Dec. 29 that tate Great Powers had during a period of four years taken no step towards the arrangement of the disputed sovereignty, and it was this inaction on their part that had encouraged Switzerland in believing it would never be taken up; it was stiU open to them to meet and negotiate an arrangement of that point; but as regarded the prelimmary and more prominent question-the liberation of the prisoners, Prussia could not consent to subordinate her action tothe deliberations of aconference,seeingthat time pressed. In another despatch of Dec. 28th, addressed to the other three Powers, Prussia announced that she had postponed issuing the order for the mobilization of her troops to the latest possible moment, viz., January lo, for the purpose of giving the Great Powers, on the one hand, every facility for taking a collective step in the matter, and of giving Switzerland, on the other, further time for the attainment of more prudent determinations. About the same time Russia answered the Austrian objection of the necessity of Prussia's subordinating her action to the decisions of a conference by pointing out that Prussia was not bound by her undertaking in the London protocol not to go forward in this matter of the hberation of the prisoners, and that the near approach of their trial left the various Powers no more time than was necessary to instruct their several representatives at Berne to put forward their separate remonstrances with the Swiss Government. These communications of Russia were subsequently answered, it is believed, by the Austrian Government, in a sense which showed that it had modified its suggestion of a conference previous to the liberation of the prisoners to one to be held after their liberation, and which should have for its object the settlement of the main question. Bavaria, Wurtemberg, and Baden, at the same time, hastened to indicate their right to enter into separate negotiations with Prussia for the passage of her troops without reference to the Bund, and arrangements have accordingly been concluded with them to that end.
In the course of the correspondence that took place on the question of whether it was competent for members of the German Confederation to enter into separate arrangements with each other for the passage of troops, it was reverted to with considerable point that Prussia had offered no objection to Austrian troops passing through Silesia in 1848 on their march to Gahicia, nor to Russian troops passing the same way on their route to Hungary, and it hras no later than January, vg55, that Austr a heiwelf had endeavourera to nuotiate miltary arrangements with separate States without reference to the Bund.
On January 3 Colonel von Manteuffel left here on a mission to the Government and the Emperor of Austria. Ostensibly he was the bearer of the above-mentioned Prassian despatch of the 28th December, declining to lay the nrgent question of the liberation of the prisoners before a conference; in ad tion to which, he was intrusted with another despatcMh, resisting the Austrian requirement that the negotiations with tne South German Powers. should be sulbmitted to the Bund. There is good reason also for believing that he was instructed, at the same
time, to ascertain the extent to which the Austrian Government contemplated occupying the nieighbouring Cantons of Switzerland in ease of war breaking out between Switzerland and Prusia, and how far the idea was entertained there of a revision of the Swiss Constitution, and eventually, un4er propitious
circumstances, of proceeding to a partition,of Switzerland. Colonel von Manteuffel has returned to Berlin within the last 24 hours, and the impressi n seems to be that Austria has given up these ideas for the present, to which the .circumst%nce wi I doubtless have contributed that on the present eccasion she will probably not have an opportuni y of acting on them. That she, really intended o occupy a portion of Switzerland, and, without goi g to war, put herself in a position to speak a decisii e word in the settle ntent of the question, is plac d beyond doubt; nor would it have been anythi g
more than a repetition of the taetics observed in t e Danubian Principalities.
The negotiations that have been carried on an Pails between Louis Napoleon and Dr. Kern since
the beginning of this year were confined to the former distinctly, enunciating to the latter what he knew of the King of Prnia's resolution as regards the liberation of the prsoners, and his intentionsl with regard to the lnain question when thiu preliminary should have been complied with. This Government has beet no party to those negotisa tions, and seemrn not to have had any authentic knowledge of their progress. As little have England, Austria, and Russia participated in them, and their representatives at Paris have only attained a knowledge of their results in the ray of confidential personal intercourse. What I can gather here from authentic sources favours the belief that the Emperor Louis Napoleon has remained to the end consistent in uriging on Switzerland the necessity of liberating the prisoners by quahing the proceedinga against them as a preliminary to negotiations for the settlement of the main question of the sovereignty, and that consequently it ma fairly be confidently hoped and expected that on the 14th inst. the Swiss Federal Assembly will resolve to comply with this preliminary, andrussiaberelieved from the necessity of issuing orderafor the mobilization of her troops. How the main question of the sovereignty is to be deliberated on, whether by a conference or by diplomatic correspondence, does not yet appear. One point is however quite clear, that if conferences sre to boe held on the subject this country will not consent to their veeuue being laid in Vienna.

(FROM OUR NW YORB OOBRESPONDMa.)
NEW YORK, Dzc. 29, 1856.
Tne revolution of time brings me once more to the usual review of what the dying year has done for the United States, and what the IUnitea States has done for it. This time I have no wars or victories, no commercial crashes,no civil convulsions (beyond the border struggles in Kansas), as food for the pen. No great statute has this year changed the political balance of the country, to call into action bitter sectional strife. No statesman of towering strength has passed away, leaving the country without the restraint of his power. No successful'railway Samson has fallen, puling with him the pillars of public confidence and security. Instead of these we have this year the national election-27,000,000 people working themselves into a gradually increasing excitement for four months, quietly voting at the close, and sinking the next day into an apparently profound apathy until the incoming Administration shall develope its policy. The year began with faint murmurs from the plains of Kansas-murmurs of outrages and oppressions-of the grossest abuses of stolen power in the hands of brutal men-murmuz
faint and discredited. Soon the stories took visible shape, and before the first of the political conventions met we saw actual civil war; fortified Laiwrencesurrounded by Missouri invaders, and defended by Free State rifles. The Federal power was interposed on behalf of the Missourians, and the Free State men were obliged to succumb. The different political conventions next met and put forth their nominees and their declarations of principles. The Ostend Conference, endorsed at Cincinnati, was denounced as " the highwayman's plea" at Philadelphia. The non-extension of slavery, proclaimed at Philadelphia as a cardinal article of faith, was winked out of sight at Cincinnati. The canvass was conducted with a greater fluctuation in the chances than was supposed possible in the outset, and Mr. Buchanan was at length elected in the face of the most imposing opposition vote ever given in the States that threw their electoral votes for Colonel Fremont.
The year has also produced great changes in the relations between Great Britain and this country. January, 1856, was more than a " winter of discontent." Let us hope that January, 1857, is the beginning of perpetual Spring. A year ago the enlistment embroglio was in its worst phase. I think it was a year ago yesterday that Mr. Marcy sent the long defence of the American position upon the question which effectually shut the door against any settlement, except by withdrawing Mr. Crampton and the offending Consuls. The Central American question also was in about as bad a way as well could be. Mr. Buchanan and Lord Clarendon, having failed to agree about the construction of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, had laid down their pens in despair. Lord Clarendon had proposed arbitration; Mr. Buchanan had said there was nothing to arbitrate; and Mr. Crarmpton had quietly stowed away in his portfolio a similar offer which he was instructed to make at WVashington. Now all these questions are happily disposed of. Mr. Crampton was dismimsed without disturbing the diplomatic relations of the two countries. MIr. Dallas replaced Mr. Buchanan, filled with the spirit of conciliation, and armed with plenary powers. A treaty was concluded with Honduras, by which the sovereignty of the Bay Islands was definitely vested in that Republic, on a plan the possibility of which was first foreshadowed in The Times when the troubles seemed most difficult of adjustment
and another treaty was entered into between Great Britain and the 'United States-which still awaits the action of the Senate-by which prospective arrangements are made for defining the limits of the Mosquito occupation; for establishing a free port at Greytown; for opening the navigation of the San Juan to citizens of Costa Rica; for settling the territorial disputes of Costa Rica and Nicaragua by arbitration, if they cannot be otherwise disposed of; for the recognition of grants of public lands; for an annuity to the Mosquito Indians; and for defining the limits of that hitherto very vaguely bounded territory, the Belize. Thus, after the lapse of seven years, and the expenditure of any quantitv cf best hand-made linenpaper foolscap, diplomatic pattern, to say nothing of convincing argument; and bad temper, these questions are adjusted on the precise basis which the late Mr. Abbott Lawrence on behalf of the Government of the United States offered in 1849. Meanwhile, however, power has changed hands twice in this country, and is E0On to pass again into new hands. New men have come up inI the Senate, new interests have been created the national wealth and commerce have expanded beyond the belief of those who have not seen it, and the nation has become more conscious of its strength, and less willing to submit to a cartailment of the foreign influence which it feels to belong to it upon this continent. There is said to be some doubt whether the settlement which in 1850 would have been acceptable to everybody will be palatable to the Senate in 1857. At the last advices from Washington the opposition to the ratification was giving way, and I hope soon to be able to advise you that the last obstacle in the way of the adjustment of these annoying questions is remioved.
The year 1856 has been a fortunate year for the commerce of the country. Although its imports are greater than these of any previous year, and no.w exceed 50,000,0001. a-year, the exports are still larger by $12,000,000, ^ounting Californian gold a, a domestic production. which, economically speaking, it is. This is a fact indicating a healthy condition of trade, and confirms the views I have invaliably taken-that the country is prosperous, and its business, although expanded and expanding, is on a healthy basis.. The constant demand for money for the construction of new and enlargementof old railways keeps a tight money-market. That is no sign of want Of prosperity. Railways in the West take the plae of common highways and turnpikes in an old country. They penetrate tracts of land before inaccessible to markets, and carry with them and distribute the rapidly increasing pOpUIati0o of the United States. Though they
may not pay the shareholders they increase the wealth of the country more than fourfold the cost of construction.
The cotton lands of the South have been visited by many adverse influences during the year, unfavourable to a large crop. Though we till have no certain information as to the whole crop, we know enough to say with a proximate accuracy that it will be under the average. The agricultural mlds of the West, on the other hand, have been unusually productive. Tl'he farmers have baen busy there, also, getting large new tracts into cultivation, and if the new year run its course with genial sunshine and refreshing rain harmoniously intermingled we may look for an increased production of cereal crops. In the east, our city has continued its expansive strides with undiminished energy. New streets stretch their thin arms out on the rocky waste to the north. Old streets " down toun" lie in ruins pre. preparatory to appearing next year in the splendour of marble and sandstone. Population stiUl pours in; wealth, churches, poverty, and crime increase sideby side, and croakers, here as overywhere, mourn over the rotenness and predict the speedy downfal of this Babylon. But in spite of all ve grow, and grow rich, and growing rich spend our money-in houses that are palaces, in equipages, silver, servants, and wines. New ships lie at our whars, new warehouses receive new consignments, and we continue to prosper. The yellow fever hung at our door for months, threatening to check our growth, and unquestionably did do injury to our trade, but not enough to be perceptible. With that exception the pant year has been one of unbroken prosperity.
Most noticeable of all is the increase in the good feeling towards England-not the gool feeling of cabinets, but the more solid good feeling of popular will. I see it in every part of the country where the public mind has an opportunity to express itself.
There is little local news of interest for this packet at this time. Congress will not be in se3sion until the holydays are over. The House wiU try to get hold of the Pacific Railway in some form or other; and as they wil jumble together a variety of grants, and thus combine a variety of interests, it is possible that something may pass. The modification of the tariff wiU also come up, upon the reports of Mr. Letcher and of Mr. Campbell. Mr. Letcher's bill, takdng the tariff of 1846 as its basis, transfers manufactured silks to the 30 per cent. schedule; flax and blankets to the 25 per cent.; raw wool to the 10 per cent.; and raw silk and dyestuffs to the free list, and then a uniform reduction of 20 per cent. upon all the duties levied under the tariff of 1846. lrIr. Campbell's bil puts on the free list raw materials and dyestuffs used in American manufactures, and leaves blankets in the 20 per cent. schedule, and woollen goods and silk; goods in the 25 and 30 per cent. schedules.
A most remarkable criminal trial is going on here, the result of which, not known as I write, will probably be known before the mail leaves Boston. One Huntingdon,a bilibrokerof Wall-streat, who robbed the "note-shavers" to the amount of half a million and lived en prince on the proceeds, is on trial for the forgeries. His counsel admit the execution of the paper, and set up insanity, because no sane man ever would have committed so glaring crimes. To prove this they rake up from a career of swindling every criminal act they can lay hands on (of which there seems to be plenty), and ask the jury to believe that so great a rogue must be an honest man.
The Baltic brought us the news of the appointment of Mr. Matthew as Consul at Odessa. It will gratify his many friends in this country to know that he is once more cared for. There was a general feeling that Mr. Matthew was hardly dealt with in the enlistment business. His case was different from that of the Consul at this port. There was no bark Maury blunder on his part, and the Philadelphia Boua of Commerce, so far from being disposed to make representations to the Government for the withdrawal of his excquzatr, as here, were his personal friends.

Her Majesty's steams troopship Doe arrived at Woolwich yesterday at noon, having experienced a moet favomrabl, psage the whole way up. Mr. Taplin, from the engineer's department of Woolwrich Dockyard, having been deputed by the Lords of the Admiralty to proceed to Portsmouth on board the Dee in ordor to note the progress of MrWeathered's apparatus for auperheating steam, fitted, on boardtha&tvessl, has confirmedthe reportsalreadyforwarded to theAdmiralty, and has fuUy corroboratedtlae former state. ments detailing tho spocific amount of economy obtained thereby, without. causing the slightest perceptible injury or extra strain to the machinery of the ship. A econd invention, the production of a MX. Lees, for -uperheating steam, was on Tuesday brought forwardand subjected to a preliminary trial on board the steam vesset Water Sprite, doring a ran of two miles down the river from Erith. The apparatus consists principally of a hydro. caloric engine, by which the steam is first produced in a smAl boiler or generator. It then passes through a second. which is named a " coil boiler," and traverses a coil of 6 circles or coiled tabes, and, issuing thence red-hot, is4 Oeved into a third, where it is condensed with water and boiled. It id supplied in that state for the use of the engine. The experiments were highly satisfactory, and were recommended for further triasl, as the method, sub. ject to a slight revision, is considered likely to become of considerable importance in the navigation of steamers.
3ear.Admiral the Righi Hon. Sir Maurice F. F. Ber. keley, K.C.B., and Captain Sir Baldwin Walker, K.C.B, Surveyor of the Xavy, paid an official visit to Woolwich Dockyard yesterdaymorning, and were accompanied through the various departments by Commodore J. Shepherd, superintendent of the yard. They likewise went on board the Caledonia, new Seamen's Hospital Ship, and inspected the internal arrangements, after which they took leave of the Commodore and returned to London.
The freight ship Swanley arrived at Woolwich yesterday morning, and having embarked 18 barrels of powder was towed down to Gravesend, whence she is to proceed on her voyage to Jamaica.

(Before the LoRD CHANCELLOR.)
'ADIS was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Stuart, dismissing the bill with costs. The question be. tween the parties turned upon the legal effect of the will of Edmund Penny, dated October, 1796. The testator thereby devised certain freehold estates to trustees in trust to pay the money borrowed by him on mortgage; and after that vas fully paid to pay the rents to his five children, and after the decease of four of them to pay a certain part thereof to the survivor, and to divide the overplus between his two grandsons, James Penny and Thomas Marchant Penny equaly - and after the decease of the survivor of his five children, then as to part of the estate to James Penny in tail, and as to the other part to Thomas Marchant Penny in taiL Four of the testator's children died prior to 1827, leaving their brother Edmund Penny, and the testator's grandsons, James Penny and Thomas Marchant Penny, them surviving. James Penny died in the year 1837, leaving the present plaintiff, his eldest son, surviving, who thereupon became entitled under the will as tenant m tail to the estates. It appeared, however, that in the year 1828 . common recovery was suffered, and the estates wreoe conveyed to certain use- and such estates sub-
sequently became vested in t&, defendants. The plain- ' tiff contended that the recovery was invalid, inasmuch as the representative of Thomas Marchant Penny, who died in the year 1827, had nob concurred in making a tenant to 4#<pl ecipe, and therefore he claimed to be entitled to the zhtaments as tenant-in-tail in possession
Mr. Malins and Mr. Hardy appeared for the appellantMr. Walker and Mr. Berkeley supported the decree.

his HoNOUR. gave judgment in thiscas the particlars of Which are as follows :-The plaintiffs in the year 1818 carried on the business of export merchants, at Emden, in flanover; in that year they shipped a cargo of wheat to the order of Mr. Carl Hennings of london, to sell the same and account to them for the proceeds. Hennings kept the wheat till 1825, when he sold it, but omitted to remit the proceeds of it to Hanover, on the ground that the plaintiffis were indebted to him to a larger amount than such proceeds would cover. In 1832 Hennings instituted a suit against the plairntiffs at the Royal British Hanoverian Court of Emden, and the plaintiffs commenced a cross suit against Hennings. On these two suits a judgment was given in favour of Hennings, but this judgment was reversed on appeal to the higher court at Aurich. The case was subsequently taken to the Hanoverian Supreme Court of Appeal at Celle, when final judgment was given in favour of the plaintiffs in 184L Hennings appears never to have objected to the jurisdiction of the ELanoverian courts, but, at the same time, their several decrees and resolutions of contumacy were insufficient to prevail upon him to pay money wbich he disputed owing. Hennings died in 1846, andin 1855 the present suit was instituted against his representatives, the principal question putin issue beinghowfartheCourt of Chancery in ngland could act upon and enforce a judgment recovered abroad? His Honour, however, without going into this question, further than to express an opinion that such a judgment was impeachable for errors on the face of it, ordered the plaintiffs' bill to be dismissed, upon the ground of unnecessary delay in the prosecution of their claim. From the year 1842 up to the time of Mr. Hennings' death, and from Mr. Hennings' death up to the year 1855, no proceedings appeared to have been taken by the plaintiffs to enforce their clim, and it was too late now for the plaintiffs to come to this court to recover against Mr. Henmngs' representatives on a judgment which Mr. Hennings migh in his lifetime have proved to the satisfaction of tiis Court was irregularly obtained. Twelve or 13 years' delay was unreasonable in such a matter, and the plaintiffs must therefore be held not to have used such diligence in the prosecution of their alleged claim as would entitle them to the intervention of this Court.

luis was a bill for the specific performance of an agree. ment for the purchase of freehold and copyhold land, situate in Middlesex. The defendant declined to complete as to the copyholds, and was willing to do so as to the freeholds; but the plaintiff refused to complete as to one without completing as to the other. The defence as to the copyholds was, tirst, that there was no certainty as to the subject matter of the contrat; and secondly, that in the particulars of sale the copybolds were described as building land, nearly equal to freehold, whereas it appeared that they were subject to arbitrary fines.
Mr. Craig and Mr. Beales were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Malins and Mr. Boyle for the defendant.
The VicE-CiA_NcE"OR said that the defence failed on both grounds. With respect to the first objection, the contract was written on the back of the printed particulars of sae, which had a plan of the land purchased annexed, and there was no want of identity as to the subject matter of the contract. But then it was said that, even if there was certainty as to the property purchased, there was a misrepresentation in respect of its being described as copyhold building land, nearly equal to freehold; but the defendant could not be heard to say that this was tantamount to a representation that the copyholds were held at a ffine certain. The plaintiff was entitled to a decree for specific performnance, with costs.

WVHALLEY V. NEW BRITISH IRON COMPANY,
The Court was occupied during the whole day with this case, which was presented in the shape of a motion by the defendants, thelessees of a colliery on the Plas MadocEstate, in North Wales, under an agreement with the plaintiff, the owner of the estate, to dissolve an injunction obtained ex parte by the plaintiff, whereby the defendants had been restrained from working the collie in a mode contrary, as the plaintiff alleged, to the terms of the agreement.
The discussion turned upon the construction of the agreement and the manner of workiDg the mine by the defendants, as to which the affidavits were voluminous and conflcting, and wholly uninteresting to all but the parties concerned.
Mr. Rolt and Mr. Cotton appeared in support of the motion todissolve; Mr. Daniel and Mr. Robert Hurst for the plaintiff.

(SiUings in Banco, before Lord C"rPm and Justicu
COLERIDGE, WIGU1TMAN, and ERLE.)
This was a case stated for the opinion of the Court, and which raised the question whether a local board of health, before proceeding to contract for the execution of works under the 69th section of the Public Health Act (llth and 12th of Victoria, chap. 63) were bound by the proviso to the 8.th section to obtain from the surveyor an estimate in writing as wedl of the probable expense of executing the work, as of the annual expense of repairing the same, and whether an order enforcing payment of the expense incurred in executing such works, without such estimate having been made, could be enforced against the owner of the adjoining property. The appellant was the owner of some houses in York-street, Wolverhampton, which was not a highway, and the corporation of Wolverhampton, acting as the local board of health, had called upon him, under the 69th section, to sewer, pave, flag, and channel those parts of the street abutting upon his property; and on his neglect so to do, the local board of health, though they might have done the work themselves, entered into a contract for its execution. The work being executed, the amount to be paid by Mr. Cunningham was settled by the surveyor; and ultimately an order was made by the magistrates for the payment of 411. odd-his proportion of the expense. Against this order there was an appeal, when it was agreed that the facts should be stated for the opinion of this Court. The question turned chiefly upon the construction of one of the provisoes to the 85th section, which provided '-that, before contracting for the execution of any works under the provisions of this act, the said local board shall obtain from the surveyor an estimiate in writing, as well of the probable expense of executing the works in a substantia, manner, as of the annual expense of repairing the samre also a report as to the most advantageous mode of contr%cting-that is to say, whether by contracting only for the'execution of the work, or for executing and also main:aining the same in repair during a term of years, or othcrwise" By the 69th section of the act, the board, on the default of the owner, had power to execute the works thernselves; but in the present instance they had thought ;proper to enter into a contract for that purpose, and the
question was, whether they were bound by tlhe above proviso, before contracting, to obtain the estimate and report before referred to.
The case was argued during the last term by Mr. Huddleston (with whom was Mr. Sawyer) for the respondents; and by Mr. Scotland for the appellant,
The COrRT havinm taken tune to consider,
Lord CASII'aELL now delivered judgment in favour of the respondents. The proviso did not apply to a case like the present, where the repairs were done to streets which were not highways, there being no power or duty in the local board to continue to repair the roads after they had Lonce put them in repaar.
FZIL V. BtJPCiETT.
Mr. Pnsrsox moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant. The action was brought by a customaer of the Royal British Bank agas the defendant, a shareholder, to recover the sum of 33§ ,7ing the balance of the plaintiff's account current with the bank. At the trial, which took place at Guildhall before Lord Campbell at the sittings after last term, the verdict was entered for the pLaintiff for the amount claimed, subject to the present application.
Lord CAMPBELL said, the question was whether the c ion would lie. The facts were admitted. The bank was 4fom.ded under the 7th -d 5th of Victoria, and the plaintiff rinad epoA4ted money with the hank, He had an account ."rient, an.4 was a creditor. Tne defendant was a sharelh .Ider in the bank when the debt accrued, and he was so -s-ill. Upon those facts the verdet was found for the plain4 ,t ff, leave being oiven to the deC41ant to move to enter it in his favour.

SIMONS V. PATCHETT.
Mfr. X SatiTH, Q.C., moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to show cause why the verdict which had been found for the plaintiff, with M001. damages, should not be set aside and entered for the defendant. The defendant had represented to the plaintiff that he was authorized by Wessrs. Boston and Co. to purchase a vessel of the plaintiff of the class nine years A for the sum of 6,0001. The contract of sale was made, hut it turned out that the defendant had acted without authority. The present action was then
brought to recover damages for the false representation, and I at the trial, which took place before Lord Campbell at Gnuildhal at the sittings after last term, a verdict was entered for the plaintiff for 5001., the difference between the contract price and theprice for whichtheship was afterwards sold, subject to the defendant's motion to enter the verdict in his favour if the action would not lie. The learned counsel now mnoyed accordinglv, and he also eontended that the proper measure of damagealhad not been applied.
Lord CAMPBELL said, the learned counsel might take a- rule 33si.
BEATm V. THE LONDON, BRIGHTON, AND SOUTH COAST
RAILWAY COMFPANY.
The argument in this case was continued this day.
Mr. gindmarsla and Mr. Macrory appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill, Q.C., Mx. Webster, ande Mx. Aston, for the defendants.
Before the close ofthe argument,
Lord CAmPBELL said, the Court did not consider the verdict satisfactory as to the novelty of the plaintiff's invention, and upon that ground there would be a new trial, in order that further evidence might be obtained. If the question of novelty should be determined in favour of the plaintiff, the judge who tried the cause would then have to say what the patent was for. There would therefore be a new trial on the yment of costs.
Mr. BOVILL said, he had not yet argued the misdirection; if he succeeded in that point it would give him the costs. The only fact within the six years was the user of the machine, and it had not been used beyond the six years.
Lord CAMPBELL, after consulting the other judges, said, the costs might abide the event.
BOVILL V. REYWORTH AIND OTHERS.
This was a rule for a new trial or a nonsuit. The action vas brought to recover damages for the infringement of the plaintiff'spatent for certain improvements in the manufacture of wheat and other grain into meal and Rour; and at the trial the plaintiff had obtained a verdict with 1,2391. lls. I'd. damages.
The argument was only in part beard when the Court roe.

NEEDHAM V. ANDREWS.
Mr. Serjeant Shee was counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. M. Chambers and Mr. Overend for the defendant.
The plaintiff was the patentee for making machines for expressing moisture out of all substances, which were called
adesiccators." The defendant had some whitelead works at Penrance, and he had an interview with the plaintiff for the purchase of one of these machines, and, according to the plaintiff's statement, he told the defendant that the cost of the machine would be 1501. The defendant said he thought the price was too large, but he presumed that would include the fixing the machine at Penzance, but the plaintiff said there woula be an extra charge for that. The 1A. wvs to include sn ordinary machine. The defendant at first talked of employing a local engineer to construct the gear for erecting tbe pump but ultimately he instructed the plaintiff to send one of his men to do th and wished to Znow the expense. The plaintiff told him it would be impossible to name a sum until he knew the nature of the work to be dobe. The defendant wishing to see the machine in opration the defendan, ha,d a model made, and it was trie in the presence of the defendant, who expressed him. self satisfied, and it was ultimately ngreed that the plaintiff should send down one of his men to fix the machine at Penzance, the plaintiff saying that he would do the best he could, and, if possible, he would keep the price under the 150, including the fixing. The defendant agreed to this, and the plaintiffs foreman went down to Penzance and fixed the machine. The present claim was for 1891. The defendant had paid 1401. into court.
The trial was adjourned before its conclusion.

Mr. QUAL moved for a rule in this case, calling on the defendantea company to show cause why a writ of injunction should not issue against them under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act to compel them to desist from preventing the plaintiff from entering into the yard of the Kingston Ratlway station with his omnibus, The affidavits on which the learned counsel moved stated that the applicant was the proprietor of an omnibus which plied from Twickenham station on the Windsor line to the Kingston station on the London and South-Western line, and that while other Otnibuses, and particularly an omnibus called the " railway omnibus,"ying fromthe oldtownof Kingstontothesttion had been alowed admission into the yard, the atplicatio
omnibus had been improperly and unfairly exclulcEd. The company alleged that the station was private property, and that they had the right to admit or exclude any person or vehicle they thought proper; and, as they had agreed with the railway omnibus proprietors to provide for the traffic of the station at Kingston, they were entitled to exclude the applicant's omnibus, or any other omnibus they chose. The learued counsel submitted that this was an infringement of the provisions of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, and that under that act all persons going to the station were entitled to be treated aIke, and that the Court ought to enjoin the company to admit the applicant's omnibus to ply in their yardl.
Rule nisi granted.
PONIS V. HARDING, P. 0. OF THE ROYAL BRITISH BASK
In this case Mr. Lossi moved for a rule for leave to issue execution againastthe person, property, and effecteof Andrew Beattie, a shareholder of the Royal British Bank, for the sum of 5761. and costs, and for the costs of this application and the proceedings against Mr. Beattie. The learned counsel moved on affidavits that judgment had been obtained by the plaintiff against the defendant as official manager of the bank, and that execution had issued against him tor the amount of that judgment, B691., and costs, and that nulb booa had been returned to the writ. The motion had been made before Mr. Jnstice Willes at chambers, when, it having been objected before him that the return of the shareholders was wrong, as it purpnrted to be made in pursnuance of the statute 4th of George IV., chap. 46, and that it had been filed in June, instead of between the 28th of February and the 2Bth of March; and also that Mr. Beattie had been induced to become a shareholder by the fraudulent representations of the directors of the prosperous condition of the bank, And had sought to rescind his contract and recover back the amount paid on his siares before the Bankruptoy Court, as money had and received to his use by the bankntpt company, Mr. Jtutice Wiles referred the motion to this Court, on an undertaking by Mr. Beattie to show cause in the first instance. The learned counsel now contended that the heading of the memorial under the statute of George IV. was mere surplusage, as the return of the shareholders contained all the requirements Prescribed by the 7th and 8th of Victoria, chap. 113, and that, as to the time of fihng the memorial, the statute was directory and not compulsory. The return of the shareholders was a second return, made in consequence of a change in the directors. He also contended that Mr. Beattie, having become a shareholder and signed the deed had no power to repudiate the responsibility cast upon hima by the 9th an 0th sec tions of the 7th and 8th of Victorih and 1 sc-
Mr. HILL, Q. C., with Mr.ellish, now showed cause against the rule. He contended that the memorial was not made out pursuant to the requirements of the 16th and 17th sections of the statute, as it purported to be made in pursuance of the provisions of the 4th of George IV., chap. 46. The act of Victori~a required the memorial to be enrolled between the 28th day of February and the 2-th of March', whereas this memorial had been enrolled in June last. The leayned counsel also contended that Mr. Beattie had bee; induced to becomie a shareholder from the published report of the directors of the flourishing condition of the banl, which was false, and that this was a fraud which vitiated his contract, and he was not therefore liable under it The learned counsel referred to the case of " Kingsford .
Merry," which had been alluded to in the city article of Thie Times, as an authority that fraud in a contract vitiated it.
Mr. Justice CRmsS%vLL said, that case had been greatly misunderstood and misapprehended, and, as it had been reierred to, he might state that it had been very well treated and explained in the last two numbers of the Jur.it.
Mr. HILL said, the facts as stated in the article in 2he Times were certainly not the facts on which the case was argued in the Exchequer Chamber. I
Mr. LusH and Mr. BEASLry, in support of the rule, submiitted that shareholders must be bound to know their liability when they purchased shares, as the price of shares in a joint-stock bank was affected by the liabilities in7 curred. The suggestion of fraud did not affect the case. No fraud was implied to the general body of the shareholders, and the directors were liable for any misrepre. sentations they might have made.
The LORD CmEF JUSTiCE said he understood there were other cases pending in the other conrts on the same point, and, as the case was one of considerable importance, looking at the number of persons implicated and the amount involved, it was desirable to let the case stand over for a short time to see if the Courts were unanimous in their opinion. The Court would therefore take time to consider its judgment.
r'RIDEIUX V. BUNNET.
This was an action tried before the Lord Chief Justice at the Guldhall, in which a verdict was found for the plaintiff.
Mr. EDIIN JAMES, Q.C., now moved to set aside the verdict. The action was brought to recover the price of X smoke consuming valve, and a question in the cause was whether or not there was a warranty that the apparatus ,should consume smoke. For the defence it was contended there was such a warranty, and that the apparatus did not answer. The plaintiff's case was, that a known article was ordered and supplied, and that the case came within the decision in " Chauntler and Hopldns ' (4 Mf. and W).
The COURT, on hearing the contract read, were of the latter opinion, and refused the rule.
C02X V. LECI.
In this case Mr. Bovill and Mr. Honyman appeared to show cause against a rule to enter the verdict for the plaintifffor 102l., and Mr. Norman in support of it.
The plaintiff, it appeared, isan attorney, and waS xst4ined
by the defendant to recover a sum of 161. on a policy of iDSurance on a ship, which the plaintiff sought to do by issuing 46 writs against the underwriterg in the Lord Mayor's Court of the city of London. In the course-of the actions it became necesasary to issue a commission to obtain evidence, and it was there found that the Lord Mayor's Court had no power, on the common-law aide, to issue any such commission, and, although it might be issued on the equity side of that court by ffling a bill of discovery, it could only be done at a cost of 301 to 4001. Tbe actions were in consequence abandoned, and Mr. Leach, the defendant, refused to pay the costs incurred, as they were in. curred owing to the plaintiffs gross negligence, who ought to have known whether or not the court in which he chose to bring these actions hadpower to deal with them so as to secure to his client his rights. Mr. Cox thereupon brought an action for his bill of costs, and the verdict being against him, on the ground of negligence, the present rule was obtained,
The COuTBT were of opinion that, so far as the costs incursed for taking out the writs in the Lord Mayor's Court, there was sufficient evidence of negligence to support the verdict. But with regard to the cost of letters a yjLnfo payment of the policy, which amounted to 6a1. os.ngthr was no case of negligence, and they were distinguishable from the proceedings in the Lord Mayor's Court. The verdict, therefore, for these costs would be entered for the plaintiff. Rule accordingly.

_ DEGG V. THE 3IDLAND RATIIWAV tA'NPA'N-YV
{Stings in Banco, before thie CHC F BARON and Barons
BRAMWELL and WATsMnso
flhs action, which has been twice tried at the Glocestersbire Assizes, was brought by the plaintiff,as administratrix of one James Degg, to recover under Lord Campbell's Act eompensation for death, which resulted from an accident on the defendants' railway. The matter now came before the Court on demurrer, and the question was raised whether the declaration showed any cause of action, and, if so, whether the plea was an answer to it.
The declaration stated in effect that James Degg was assisting in the turning and removal from one place to another place of a railway truck upon the Midland Railway, andthe defendants, by their servants, carelessly, negligently, and improperly moved some other tracks against the track which James Degg was assisting in moving without giving any notice or warning to him of their intention so to do, or taking any reasonable or proper precaution to prevent the damage to him, and that he was thereby dashed against a ehed and kiUed. The plea stated that the other servants employed were persons of ordinary skill.
Mr. Serjeant PIGOTr (with Mr. Skinner), for the plaintiff, said that the facts as stated above showed that he was entitled to an action, and that it was immaterial whether or not the deceased was a servant of the company or a mere volunteer who was for the moment lending his assistance for the puroose of moving the tracks. Bespondeat superior was the maxim of the English law, and a master was liable for the negligence of his servants. Where spring guns were set on premises and injured a person who was trespassing, even he was entitled to an action, and a servant or a volunteer helping a servant could not be in a worse position.
The CHIEF BABON.-Tiie law as to spring guns rests on this :-You leave on a certain spot a piece of mechanism which, being touched, will do an mjury; that is the same as if a man were himself to point * gun at a trespasser as soon as he sees him on the particular spot and shoot at hina, and he has no right to do so. But a man may put broken glass on his wall, or if he surrounds his house with a moat he is not xesponsible if a person who has no business there gets up to his neck in water. The principle which prevents servants bringing an action of this sort ainst a master is, that if a person takes an engagement in your house he takes the risk of the service, just as a sailor takes the risk of the sea, or of the captain getting drunk-they sail in the same boat. That principle, too, is extended to guests. If a number of persons are at a dinner party, and a servant were carele6s enough to spM a basin of soup down a lady's back, or if a stair-carpet were left unfastened, and an elderly gentleman were to trip and break his l-g, no action could be maintained against the host; the host chooses his guests, and the guests their host, and they are each subject to the risk of ordinary mistakes.
After a very prolonged and desultory argument, and the citing of a vast number of cases,
The COURT intimated its opinion that it did not think it necessary to hear Mr. Keating or MIr. Phipson on the other side, and reserved its decision.
In consequence of the absence of Mr. Baron (Alderson, through iUlness; of Mr. Baron Martin, who is engaged at the Old Bailey; of Mr. Baron Watson, whose attendance was necessary at chambers; and, yesterday, of ir. Baron Bramwell, who was sitting at Nisi Prius, the Court was unable to proceed with the motions for new triaLs, and rose at a comparatively early hour.

TIE DAQUOISM-COLISlSON.
(Beforc Dr. LusanGmToN.) --
TDIs was a suit promoted by the brig Mistley, of the burden of 173 tons, against the French schooner Daquoise, of the burden of 77 tons, to recover the loes arising from a collion between them at 3 a.m. on the 6th of September last, off Whitby. The brig, coal laden, was bound from Sunderland for Harwich; the schooner, in ballast, was proceeding from Antwerp to Sunderland. The brig alleged that she descried the schooner at a distance of half or threequarters of a mile on the starboard tack, and immediately ported her helm and exhibited a light. She hailed the schooner to port her helm also, but soon afterwards discovered that she had starboarded it. On the two vessels near. ing each other the brig again hailed the schooner to port her helm, which, if it was done, was not done until too late to prevent the collision. The blow was so violent that the brigsank in a few minutes, butthecrew escaped bymeans of their boats, the schooner makinz no effort to save them. The schooner, in her defence, pleaded that, owing to the fog which prevailed, and the brig not carrying a light, she did not observe her until she was within one ship's length only; that she instantly starboarded her helm, as the only means of avoiding the collision or lessening its effects. The schooner answered her helm, but the brig ran into her starboard bow. She was not aware, as she said tlsX the crew of the brig had been obliged to take to their 6oFt.
Dr. BiYFORD and Dr. SPnxs were heard for the briDr. DsNxE and Dr. Twiss for the schooner. °'
The learned JuDnX, having consulted with the Elder Brethren by whom he was aisted, said they Were of opinion that the French vessel alone was to blame.
Decree accordingly.
THE MlIGEANT.-COLLISION.
This was art action brought by the Walter Hood, of the burden of 918 tons, against the Emigrant, of the burden of 653 tons, to obtain compensation for the loss sustained b
reason of a collision between them at 5.45 a.m. on the l8th of December, 1855, in sight of the Ower's lightvesseL The Walter Hood was proceeding from London for S3dney, the EDigrant from Yew York for Bremen. The Walter Hood, according to her aiccount, was lying to, in order to shore the pilot, when ahe saw the light of the Emigrant, distant about two miles, two or three points on her portheamn. Thehielm by the orders ofthe otwasput to port, and the ship paid off from W. to I9. The Emigrantwso h starboard tack, shnding up Channel, and when within half. a-mile of the Walter Ho suddenly starboarded her helm, raninto her abaft the foreri gng on her port tdde, and d-d her considerable damage. on the part of the Emigrant it was asserted that she discovered the Walter Hood without any light up close upon her starboard bow. The Walter H ood advanced at great speed, and before anything could be done by the Emigrant to avoid the collision, or to lessen its violence, she ran into her, stove in her bows, &c. The Walter Hood represented the state of the weather as being fine, whereas the Emigrant alleged that it was very thick and hazy.
Dr. ADDAMS and Dr. Twiss were heard for the Walter Hood ; Dr. BArFosuD and Dr. Srs?NcS for the Emigrant.
The ELDERs BRErT eN considered that there bad not been a proper look out on board the Emigrant, and that that vessel was alone to blame.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, Jan. 14.
COURT OP BANKRUPTCY, Basnghasircet, Jan. 14.
IN RE THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK.
. (Before Mr. Coamv,kioncr HOLROYD.)
This was a sitting to hear a petition on the part of Mr. Michael Banes, warehouseman.
Mr. Joseph Browvn (instructed by Mr. Linklater) appearod for the assignees; lr. Aspland (instructed by Mr. Reed) (Reed, I ngfo-d, and Co.) appeared for the petitioner.
Prior to the case being called on
Mr. GANr, on behalf of a creditor, applied for an order to be allowed to inspect the deed of settlement of the bank, in the possession of the assignees.
Mr. LINKLATER-hMr. Gant, your Honour, is suing an individual shareholder for a creditor and has proceeded f o obtain an adjudication of bankruptc; against him. He has applied to me on behalf of his client, a creditor, to be at liberty to refer to the original deed of settlement and the register of shares, for the purpose of seeing who is the attesting witness. It seems to be my duty to resist any such proceeding on the part of the creditors and assignees, because we desire that no individual shareholder should be singled out by an individual creditor; but we are desirous of proceeding for the public good, and tberefore we think that it would not be right to allow Mr. Gant to do what he asks. And more particularly the assignees now desire to resist this application, because they are in communication with the soacitors for the purpose of getting up some speedy way by which a large fund may be raised, so that wo
y be absh put an end to all litigation, and raise such an amount as shall satisfy all the elaims of the creditors by compromise. Under these circumstances I feel myself bound to mesist this application; but I am in the hands of the Court, and if the Court should think it right for us to produce it we wll produce it immediately; but, otherwise, we must leave Mr. Gant to pursue his ordinary remedy in the best way he can.
bes cGANT.-If I stop till Mr. Linklater produces it Ishall certainly then know, but then it will be too late. I want to know who is the attesting witness to the deed, so that I .may have an opportunity, when the mztter comes before Mr. Commissioner Evans, to summon the witness to prove the alleged bankruptcy. It is certainly discourteous oh the part of my friend to Tefuse, and it is the first time that he has refused assistsice to another professional mani. I am sure in furtherance of justice that your Honour will cohaider that I should have liberty to inspect the deed.
The CommissiozNE-It appears to me if the other side is not willing to consent to at that I must follow the ordinary rule' that is wheze creditors are taking proceedings whiph may be considered adverse under the bankru tcy, and taking proceedings for their own benefit ultra of thebankruptcy as it were, that they are not at liberty and are not entitled to come and demand any advantage or assistnc under the bankruptcy.
Mr. GAvNT.-It is not quite so, because my client has claimed under this bankruptcy.
The CoMxRoNER.-You are taking now a proceeding fg; your own benefit ultra the bankruptey-cometbing
beyond the bankruptcy; and it is with a view to that procetding thatyout want assls=nee. That being so, Imust leave you to take the ordinary course.
Mr. ASPLhjD said that for some years prior to October, 1805, Mr. Banes kept a drawing account at the bank. In October, 1855 he alOopened a discount account. All appli. cants for a discount account were required to sign an undertakinto keep ash t the bankto the amount of one-fourth that of the bills discounted On three occasions only, and
hose only for a day or two and by Scecial Permision, had there been a less amount of eash at the bank than this onefourth. At the stoppage of the bank there was a cash balance in 3. Bauesrs favourof 5031., the bank beingtho bolder of certan bills. The assignees claimed a right -to sue Mdr. Panes and other parties wose names were on the bills, and that Mr. Banes must prove for the balaneo in his hands ke any other creditor. Mr. Banes prayed that, the bank having applied from the cash balance a sum of 166!.,
s required for the full liquidation of its claims uwn the bill, the sAid bills might be given up to him, and that the Court would make an order that no action be brought on their account. Mr. Banes would then srove for the smaller instead of the larger balnce. Mr. Aspiand contended that it would shock common sense if Mr. Banes were not thus allowed a set-off.
It appeared from the examination of Ur. Banes that on three or four occasions only had he overdrawn the onefourth referred to by MIr. Aspland ; but according to the books of the bank, nowproduoed thoseoceasionshadbeen 17 or 18 in number. To.thirds of thoe occasions were errors on the part of the bank in keeping its accounts. He found, however, that there maight have been a dozen instances in which he had thus overdrawn, but except in thr or four of those instances they were for hours only not days. At an interview the manager of the bank ha
led him to expect that the rule in respect to the onefourth would not be strictly enforced. 20L was the largest amount he had ever overdrawn. Writs have been served upon some of the acceptors of the bils by the solicitor for the offcial mnauiger. Mr. Linklater had also written to them in strong terms. They were more frightened by Mr. Linidater's letter than by the official manager's Writs, as they thought Mr. Linldater wa in earnest. In several cases be bad requested the parties sued to pay the amount to him, as it would be of advantage to him to plac the amount as a set-of The bank bad expressed its willingness that he should discount to the amount of 2,OO., and he had generally kept a cash balance of from 6001. to 7001., although it might three or four times have been less than the one-fourth the amount of bills under discount, as already stated.
lMr. BRowN said this vas a very important question, the amount of the bils similarly placed being little short of 30,000. It was a case that must have occarred many hundred times on the occasion of the failure of b&nks, and the Court would require some strong authorities befere it granted the prayer of the petition. One case only had, however, been cited in support of the petition. There was one short and conclusive answer to the petitioner's case, that the bills ha been dishonomred at hibs own request, and with a distinct understanding with the acceptor It was clear that Mr. Banes had been in communication with the acceptors whether they should pay the amount or not. He said he might have told them that they might dishonour the bills if they liked, but he had not requested them to do so. It was not difficult to judge of the efEet of uch wggestions to the acceptom 3ir RNa however, h.d actBa.y receivod peyment of some of th=blis to the amount of MI. It s impossible for any man of busine3s to doubt that these bills
been dishonoured by an understanding, and this was a violation of the terms of the agreement. By discounting the bills the bank became their owner, and, this being so, if, after that, Mr. Banes went to the acceptors and suggested the dishonour of the bills, there was a clear violation of contract. It 'was a maxim of law that no man should take advantage of his own wrong. If the precedent sought to be established in fnis case should be allowed, they would have every depositor in a bank going to the acceptors of bills, ancd by that means obtain payment of their deposits in full, to the prejudice of the general body of creditors. Mr. Brownt proceeded to cdto " Gites v. Perkins," " Carstiairs v. Barnes," " Whitehead v. Walker" (10 Uea30n snd Welsby), and numerous other cases, and concluded by sulbmitting that the prayer of the petition must be re-
Mr. ASPrLA,-n replied, in the course of his reply ing that theprobable solution of one case only having been reported that he relied upon was that the hardship of such a course being taken by thu assignees of a bankrupt had preventedcases of the land becoming of frequentoccurrence.
The CoamSSroN -I think in this case if 3Mr. Banes, the drawer of these bils, had been the party who was meant to provide for them, the case of " Ex parte Hippens" would have been a clear authority in favour of the prayer of this petition. That not being the case, It reaUly seems to me that the case must be governed more by " Er,arte Burton," upon which I will make one or two observations, and which I think has been confirmed by another case. With respect to the observation of the learned counsel, Mr. Brown, as to the che of collusion between 3Mr. Banes, the drawer of the bills, with the acceptors, it does not atpear to me, upon the evidence adduced before the Court, that I should be,justified in saying that there was any collusion. Perhaps it might have been better if Mr. Banes had withheld altogether comUmunication with the acceptors, Lnd said nothing at all about it; but stil I cannot consider thsit what he has sad awould operate upon the mind of the acceptors so as to induce them to refuse payment of the bills with the view of benefiting Mr. Banes, the drawer. Therefore it appears to me that the question resolves Itself eimply into this, whether 3Mr. Banes the petitioner, having a drawing account with the Royal British Bank, and havi also a discount account, i5entitled nowtohavethobis whiMc
have remained unpaid delivered up to him, aud to have the benefit of the cash balance in his favour with the bank taken into consideration in order todisabarge the amount of thoce bils. Now, it appears to me, upon the best consideration that I can give to this case, and having regard to the law of merchants with respect to bils of exc.ange and discounters of bills of exchange, that thatrightdoesnotexisin a case of this sort, where thebillsare bils accepted forvalue. I feel bound myself to say so, independently of principle, by thecaseof "Bxparto on,"t i inconnexionwLiththe obEervations upon that case which were made by the Lord _Chancellor in another case. The case of "Ex parte Bar-
ton" itself Is unfortunatelt reported in a very meagre way, not at all satisfactory; but, at the samne time, it appears with sufficient cearness to ascertain this, that the petition was presented both by the drawer and acceptor of certain bills, the drawer having a bankingaccount with, certain bankers who had discounted the bills in question; and the petition was presented to the Court by the drawer and acceptor to have the bills delivered up, and to have the benefit of the cash balance with the viewv of discharging those bills, and that petition was dismissed. It is quite true, it is stated, that the question was asked -what business have the acceptorshere, and allusion is also made to the remedy by in3uncton. It was said an end would beput to all suits for injunctions against assignees, if relief were given in the way sought. But when the case is commented upon in " Ex parte 3ippeus," the Lord Chancelor desires the minutes to be referred to with regard to that case, because, from the report, he could not ascertain whether the bills were accepted for value or not. He desired the secretary's book to be referred to; and on a aubsequent day the lord Chancellor SAys,-
'Thecaseof 'Ex parte Burton' did not bear upon the present question, as upon an examination of the secretary's book it appears that it was not an acceptance for accommodation." That seems to lead to the inference that, it not beig an acceptance for accommodation, the Lord Chancellor did not quarrel with the decision of that case, which he would have done if it had been an acceptance for accommodation. Then, with respect to the observation lastly made by Mr. Aspland, with the view of making it a case of mutual credit, it appears to me that it can hardly come to tbat, for this reason, that I do not see what the mutual credit is as between the drawer and the Bank with reference to the prayer of tbs petition. If the drawer were the party who was asldng to be made liable, then there would be a mutual credit, it might be a mutual credit given by the bank to the drawer, who discounted these bills as drawer, and there was credit given by Mr. Banes in the money he deposited with the bank. Now, upon this subject, I think there in a case which appears to me to bear upon it; it is a case, also under a bankruptcy, of "H Holland and others, assignees of Mr. Marsh and others, bankrupts, v. Sash. That is reported in the 8th Barnwel and Cresswell, page 105, That seems to meto be applicable to the present case, because here who were the debtors upon the bills? Variousacceptors. The bills are accepted for value, and the aoceptors were bound to meet these bills, as they were the debtors upon the bills. Then br. Banes was the drawer, and he having money in the Royal British Bank endeavours by this petition to transfer his right against the bank to the acceptors of these bills, or to get the benefit of them himself by having the bills delivered up to him. It seems to me that to decide this petition in favour of the petitioner would be reallyputting bil discounters very much upon the footing of bideposited, and therefore, upon the whole, I feel bound to say that, in my opinion, the bank has a right to require payment of these bills from the acceptors, and to leave Mr. Banes to take such course as he may be advised with regard to the drawing account. I ought to make one or two observations with regard to the cases cited by Mr. Aspland. Thefirst was "E xparte Sollett." It does not appear to me that that case bears at all upon the present. It was an action for money bad and received against the factor. The factor was entitled to credit for all paymeuts hle had properly made, but he handed over the rest to the
prnncip,i *Dkd jiwcd`aset-off. As regards the other observation, with respect to the marshalling assets and the rule in equity thAt where one party has two funds to D against and the other party has only one fund, that the one having two to go against, and the other having one to go against and against which the other has no claim that applies to cases where there are two creditors against tne same debtor, two creditors against one debtor, and there being two properties against which one creditor may go and only one against which the other may go. Here I do not see the two creditors, as Mr. Aspland inferrd, meant that the drawer was to be taken as one creditor of the acceptor, and the Royal British Bank was tohbe taken as tie oher creditor of the cceptor; hut the drawer havin parted with these bills by way of discount, I do not think
e can be lookedupon as standing iu that position Mr. BROWN. -It hba been intimated to me that your Honor'sjudmen wil h fial n tis atter, and under those circumStances I will not press for the costs, The petition will be dismigsed without costs,

GUlL -)T A._Abraham Look, a la about 15 yaso age was Placed at tho bar before SirR.W CADN cuaryged uinder the followlng circumstancs:_~
On Mfonday the Wa applied at this office for relief, and Sir 1M W. Carden having inSuired into hig condition, and finding him destitute and wibthot any means Of existence directed him to apply at the West London Union, and gave him a letter to the relievin oMcier In order that he m-ight be sur-e of being taken cr of. After thes precautions Sir Rl. W. Cardon was greatlysurprised on Tuesday to find among the lis of prisoners te unfortunaste lad whom he believed at the ti6e to be comfortably housed at the West London Union. The lad accounted with the most inge. nuons caLndour for his appearwice In that position by stating that he went to the West London Union, and the relieving officer, after reading the latter, andi ascertaining thait the lad slept on the prvous night at the Riefuge in l1ayhouseyard, referred him vto the parish of St. Luke's, in which the Eefuge is situated ; the poor boy then turned from the union in degrir, and with starvation staring him in the face (unrperceived stole a skittle'bal from
a shpaIn Long-lane, and proceedn ntesm drcon he gave himself into custody for the offence he had so committed. On being takenx to the station Le there stated, that he had neither father nor mother, and had obtained a maintenance for 12 months by working under the maaster of a barge plyine betwen Hngerordand Gravesend; that the master dEN about six months ago, and that since that time he had been knocking about the streets and sleeping where he could, sometimes at the Rtefu, and some limes lying in the streets all night. SI& W.Carden on kerigthe lad's statement remanded him tilltefloiUdy and brdered a summons to be serveduonterivngfic, requmin hin to attend and exleniscnut Mr. Web1h eivngofcro h Ws odnUin apperd bdec othe summons.

Sir R. W. CAnnDtZ.-But You op>ened it.
Mr. Webb.-Yes, Sir, I opened and read it) but as he raid he had slept last inx St. Luke's, I told him to go thero, anid he went quietly away without saying another word. When he was gone I found the letter was not dietdt e n Irnatrhm u gewaone.
Sir R. W. CARDLEN.-I think you have acted somewha6t harshly to this poor boy, and thus been the means of his committing this robbery. I sent you a letter, which I should not nave done had I not madle inquiries of the lad, and the fact of that. letter being misdirected is no excuse for our neglect,as you admit that you readand acted upon it, be1ieving it was addressed to you.
Mfr. Webb.-I shouild have attended to the case had he, resded in our district) but I am bound to imake the inquiries I did and to act upon them.

would recommend you to be more careful in future, and remember that your predecessor always attended to a requegt Ifrom the msagitrates.
la. Webb.-I Wil attend to any communication for the future that I may receive from you.
Sir R. W.

It is a very serious consequencee to contemplate, and such might have been the. result of your neglect of this boy.
Mr. Webb.-The 'wording of the sumimons is for not relieving the boy being in mny district, when he realy belongs to St. Luke's.
M1r. MArtin (the chief clerk).-.You arre in error; for the summons states, " that the Poor Law Commissioners did by an order, rule, or regulation, dated the 24th of Juir, 1847 and duly iseced to the West London Union, and being silli in force in the said union, order and direct that the relieving officer should receoive all ap.plications for relief made to him within his district, and in every case of urgent necessity afford such relief to the destitute person as may be requisite, whether such desdtituteperson be settled in any piiarsh comrsem the union or not.on ficr n h

The Double Murder In Walworth.
THE DZOUBLE MURDER IX WALWORTH.
ADDMrTONAT. PA7Z7TIM AT.
Yesterday, after the ordinary buintss of the Lambeth police-court was disposed of, Mrs. Martha Bacon, who stands charged, on the coroner's warrant, with the wilful murder of her two children, Edwin Fuller and Sarah Ann Bacon, was again brought before Mr. EL5-IOrr for further exansination.
Mr. Woodward, the solicitor, agent to Mr. Atter, a solicitor at Stamford, Lincolnshir,e who is agent to the prisoner's family, as on the last occasion, attended to watch the case.
The prisoner has so much improved in personal appearance since the last examination, and particularly since her apprehension, that it is now very much doubted whether she is labouring under aberrationl of mind, or whether her manner and silence are not the resalt of other and very different causes.
The melancholy case has since the last examination, from many causes that have transpired, assumed a very different character; so different, indeed, that it now becomes a matter of considerable doubtwhether hers (the prisoner's) is the hand by which her unfortunate children have been deprnved of existence.
It will be recollected, from the testimony of Dr. Bushell, the medical gentleman who had been examnined at this court and at the inquest also, that the wounds in the throats of the poor children, aud which niust have instantly deprived them of existence, were the result of one cut, executed by so powerful and mnscular an effort that the heads were nearly severed from the bodies, while the wounds on the prisoner's own throat were mere scratches, and penetrating only skin-deep.
On tbe prisoner being bronght into court andbeing accommnodated with a chair,
Mr. ELLioTT asked Mr. Inspector Young, of the L division of police, if he had any further evidence to offer in the case, and that officer called-
Mrs. Mfary Sergeant, the vife of an engraver, who lives next door to the house in which the murder took place, and who deposed that though the prisoner lived next door to her she did not recollect having-seen her before. On Monday, the 29th of last month, the day before that on which the alarm was given, she (witness) was sweeping the front of her street door wheni by accident she struck the brush against the door of No. 4, and diLstinctly heard the footsteps of some person in the passage, but no person came to the door, nor did she see any person.
Mtr. ELLIOTT.-Were you in the habit of hearing the prisoner's children cry next door?
Witness.-Yes, Sir, frequently.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-DO you recollect having heard them cry the whole of Mondav?
Witness.-No, Sir; I did not; and I recollect remarking on the Tuesday, on hearing of the death of the children, as omervwhat extraordinary that I had not heard them cry the -whole of Monday, and having seen Mr. Bacon go out on the Sunday evening with a womiian, vho might be the prisoner, and one of the children in his arms, I doubted whether they returned. I neitber saw nor heard any hing more about them until the Monday night, when a young woman knocked several times at the door without being able to obtain admittance, and I then offered to take a message for the people, though I did not know them. The young woman, however, said she had come a great way and wanted to see them, and this is al I know about it.
mr. ELL.so-r-You say you were accustomed to hear the children cry daily, and you are quite sure you did not hear them cry on the Monday inquestion? Witness.-I am quite sure, Sir.
Mrs. Mary Pearson, a widow, residing at 5, Fouracrestreet, Walworth, next door to the prisoner, said she kne w the prisoner by sight, but that was all, and that on the nighb of the 29th of last n onth, at about 11 o'clock,and while in bed in her upstairs back-room, she heard the footsteps of some person in the adjoining room in the prisoner's house. They appeared to her as those of some person pacing the room backwards and forwards. Could not say how long this was continued, her attention having in the first instance been called to the circumstance byhearing rome person knock at the door, and finding that the person, whoever he might be, had not gone down to open it. Witness was frequently in the habit of hearing the children of the prisoner cry, and believed them to be very cross children; but not having been at home on the Monday she could not hear them. She, however, slept at home on the Sunday night, and did not notice anything particular. On the Saturday before the Monday she spoke of she heard a man speak cross in the yard. In reply to Mr. Woodward the witness said the footsteps she heard were heavy, and she heard them quite plain in her own room. She did not hear any struggling or knocking at the wall.
John RIatchford, a shoeiuaker, who works in the back parlour of No. 5, said he heard Mr. Bacon make a fire in his back room at about G o'clock on the Monday morning. Ree did not hear any one speak nor the children cry, though ne had frequently heard them cry in the morning, and throughout the day.
Mr. ELLIOIT.-You say the children used to cry a good deal, and that you had not heard them cry once during the whole of Monday. Can you say you must have heard them if they cried but once ?
Witness.-I could, Sir; they used to be very cross indeed, and cry a great deal.
Mr. Young here said that this was a}l the evidence he was prepared to lay before his Worship to-day, but, as lie was still engaged in pursuing the investigation respecting the alleged robbery and other matters, he should trouble his Worship with another remand.
MIr. ELLIOTT.-VerY Well; let the prisoner stand remanded to a future day.
The prisoner was then removed from the court, and her husband, who was present during the examination, and who occasionally instructed Mr. Woodward, followed her to the gaoler's room.
As before stated, circumstances have transpired, in -connexion with this Pffair, of a higbly-suspicious character, and on Tuesday evening Inspector Young, who has been ably and actively engaged in their investigation, attended before Mr. Elliott with Bacon, the father of the murdered children and the husband of the poor woman just renmoved from the bar, when the inspector, addressing the magistrate, said,-Your Worship, having heard for the first time on the morning of the inquest on the children that a robbery had been conimnitted in the house where the murder was committed, I made it my business to see Mr. Bacon the next day, and he then in,formed me that between the tine of his leaving home on the Monday morning, the 29th, and his return on the Wednescday morning, the 31st, his house had been robbed of a 5i. bank-note, two sovereigns, a Geneva watch, belonging to his wife, and a suit of clothes. The note and sovereigns he said were in a small box placed on a chest of drawers, the watch on the drawers, and the suit of clothes hung outside on the lobby of the upstairs room. The 51.- note he describes as one of four which he had received from the London and Westminster Bank for a check sent to him by Mr. Atter, his solicitor, at Staumford, and the monry, the watch, and the clothes he said -he sawv safe on leaving his home at an early hour on Monday morning. The watch he -said he had purchased from his brother, who lived in Charles-street, Northampton-square. and used to be worn bv his wife, and its number was 32,798. It was a silver Geneva watch. The suit of clothes he described as consisting of a greatcoat, with pockets at the sides, a frock coat, andtrousers. Having received these particulars, I first proceeded to inquire about the notes, and, having procured - the numbers, I found that three of them had been paid
intothe Bankof England on the 20th and 21st of November. A fourth note Mr. Bacon passed on the 24th of December at a shop, No. 41, Bishopsgate, but that has not been paid into the Bank yet, and therefore I caMnot say whhether it is one of the foar mentioned; but Mr. Bacon distinctly told me that the note stolen was one of those he had re* ceived from the London and Westuiinster Bank in change for a .301. check.
Mr. ELLIoTT.-Then, the whole -ofthe four notes had been passed away, and three of them reached the Bank of Eogland before the alleged robbery?
Mr. Young.-Yes, your Worship, but I am not certain whether the note passed in Bishopsgate-street is one of the four he received at the London and Westminster Bank. I told him (Bacon) I had traced out the four notes, and asked him if the one he -hadl passed in Bishopsgate-street was one of those he received at the London and WVestminster Bank, when lie hesitated a good deal, and at length said he had other notes since he came to London. I asked him particularly where he got this particuaar note from, and he varied considerably in his statements, as he h.as frequently done through my inquiry, and eould not tell me.
hlr. ELL in'r.-Haveyou been able to trace the clothes? Young.-I have not, your ;Worship. Mr. Bacon has varied .a good deal even in his description, and says -he started -from London before 7 o'clocel on -acold winters-morning for Beigate, with only a c-anvass 3acket on, leaving a greatcoat in -the house behind himn.
Mr. ELtorsr.-Did he say how he left his wife on leaving h1ome on the Monday mnorning-?
Young.-Yes, Sir; he said he left her in bed quite com-fortable. That he kissd her before leaving, and -that she bad tiedup his anger before he left. I asked him what was the matter withAiis finger, and 'he said he had cut -it while . catting.a stick. J asked him to ehow it to me, and -hle x- hibited his left hand, vhen I found a straight cut below the -irst andasecond joints of the first finger -half an -inch in length, and an eigkth of an inch in depth.
Mr. ELLIUT-r. A straight and deepo ant?
Mr. Young.-Yes, a deen cut, and even about this Bacon provaricated, for hezfterw"rds told-me the-out had been oceasioned by the knife-slipping vhile o-arvingthe dinneronthe :Sunday, but could not account for his-not having it dressed before liis starting on the Monday miorning, when -his wife .did.i for hiss.

Grain Trade Of The Port Of Hull In 1856.
RAIXTRADB OF 1EHR PORT OF HULL Zff1856.
The following is an epitome of the annual report of the Hull Chamber of Commerce and Shipping relative to the grain trade of th&t port during the year 1856:-
The past year has been characterized by an extraordinary inorease in the trade of this port, fousnded on such a legiti-
mate basis as to give every prospect of a progressive con- I tinuance. The return of peace has led to a great extension of business between this port and Russia, grain, linseed, iron, deals, tar, and other articles having been largely inported during the year.
The tonnage enterin' the port during the year amounts to 1,076,787, against 7S2,411 last year, and 850,229 in 1854. The number of ships and vesesls reported inwards on foreign voyages is this year was 3,157, and the tonnage, 743,517; while last year the number was 2,123, and the tonnage 468,047 - showing an increase of 1,034 vessels and 275,470 tons. The
tonnage of steamships in the foreign trade wvas in 1855 l 14,392, while this year it amounts to 28,229, showing an i- n crease of 13,837 tons, or nearly double the previous year's steam tonnage,
The favourable change of circumstances above alluded to has had a marked effect on the value of all sorts of cereal produce, and the year closed with prices very much in favour of the consumer as compared with last. These would unquestionably have been lo'wer but for the extended consumption of wheat and the failure in the crops in Southern Europe. As soon as hostilities ceased with Russia large shipments were made from that quarter. From the other Baltic ports the arrivals were much less than usual, and the Black Sea and Mediterranean supplies were almost entirely swallowed up by the demand for France and the South of Europe.
The crop of wheat in this country would, doubtless, have been large and of fine quality but for the prevalence of heavy rains about harvest, which reduced the crop both as to quantity and quality below the average. During the negotiations for peace some fluctuation in the price of wlieat took place, but on the conclusion of the treaty of Paris this market was but slightly affected. At this time the value of fine English red wheat was 67s. to 70s. (631b.); Danish and Hamburg about the same; Konigsberg and Dantsic white, 78s. (601b.). In June the Russian wheat began to malke its appearance, value 60s. for soft qualties. In the end of that morth the prices advanced to 65s. for good soft Rassian; good mixed Dantsic, 80s. In the followmng month the prices became more firm, but a brilliant sun in the beginning of August soon left sellers almost at the mercy of buyers, and prices declined Os. to Ss. per quarter. Harvest commenced in the middle of September, and, the weather proving rather stormy, prices stiffened a little, notwithstanding a liberal import of foreign, particularly Russian. At the end of the month samples of new wheat, generally of fine quality, appearedin the market, red bringing 60s. to 65s., and white 70s. to 72s. per quarter, Danish and Hamburg red being worth 60s. to 66s., Konigsberg and Dantsic white, 72s. to 75s., and Russian soft, 58s. to 60s. By the end of September harvest operations were nearly completed, the yield being rather less than the average, and the quality fair. Complaints of the potato disease, combined with a demand for the continent, gave an inpetus to prices, chiefly of hard wheats. Daring the months of November and December the demand was slow, and prices had declined from 56s. to 60s. for English new red wheat and 65s. for mixed Dantsic, while new Baltic was quoted at 58s. to 60s., Russian soft -Ss., and hard, 68s., at about which rates the year closed. The stocks of wheat in this country at the beginning of the harvest were under an average, but the condition of the continent and the increased consumptive demand on the part of the working classes of this country combine to negative the idea of any dechne in price; while, on the other hand, the still comparatively high range of prices all over Europe, which may lead to a greater breadth of land being sown, the splendid seed time winch has been experienced here, tho favourable accounts of the crop and the large imports from the United States tend to the exnectation that the staple article of the food of the people is not likely to be greatly enhanced above its present value.
The supplies of barley from abroad have been large,-sar, 159,S20 quarters against 27,089 in 1855, blit a ready sale from shipboard has been effected throughout the year. The shortness of the home-grown crop at the tnrn of the year was made up by importations from Denmark and other countries, and prices remained about stationary tiU the middle of the year, when the imports from abroad fell off, and a gradual advance ensued, amounting in the month of September to Ss. or Os. above the lowest price (in March). Since then the good accounts and subsequent large deliveries from Denmark and Northern Germany have, in spite of a deficient home crop, checked prices, which now range aboutthe same as six months ago, 39s. to 40s. per quarter (541b.) for usual foreign malting; and 34s. to 36. per narter (521b.)
for grinding, against 39s. to 40s. and 37s. to 3Ss. res ctivelv atthis hpved ias year. Fine Chevalier, Saal, andyEnglish malting barley, being unusually scarce, is at present worth 46s. to 4Ss per quarter (o61b.). The stocks are rather large 3-000 ,31,o00 quarters, against 3,000 quartes at the end of
last year. but mostly Mediterranean.
Oats have shown but little fiuctuation this gear. The supphes have been toa fair extent-42,046 quarters, against 36.059 quarters lastyear. The present stocks in the port are 3,000 quarters, against 3,600 quarters in year.
Beans have been imported to a much larger e rtent than last year, The price fell at the beginning of the year, recovered towards midaummer, and declined again subsequently, their present value being about 40s. to 42s. per quarter (G31b.), against 49s. to o0s. last year. Stocks are J,000 quarters, against8,500 quarters last year.
Peas have followed beans in the movements of the varket, hut there has been a considerable falling off na the imnorts of this article. Thevalueis about 12g. less thn that of last year, being at present 40os. to 41s. per quarter (631b.) for wodhite boilers, and 36s. to 3S for grinding. The stocks are 3,000 quarters, against 2,600 last year.
The stock of both wdhite and red Cover seed left over after deasserso in this country was smal, anud, notwithstandi
oifle reports from Germany, supptd es camerforward ivery springly, and prices continued to advance thus, seed asod in August for delivery in October and co ovember at 60. to 6hs. per cwvt. was at the time of delivery worth 68g to 76s. free on board at Hamburg. The white seed now coming insfrom Germany is of good fair quality, though
not equal to what we have had in former years; and those eales n this countrywho are waiting tobuy fine even quacity wil, in aU prohability, be disappointed. Thecrop in Germny is represented to be nearly an average one, but there being as before stated, no overheld stocks, it becomes questionable whether this year's produce w ll be sufficient for the requirements of the ensuing season, and therefore higher prices may fairly be anticipated. The crop of red seed in
France iS small in quantity and inferior in quality in comparison writh former years. There are likewise vary trifling quantities saved in Belgium and HIolland, and that mostly of wveathered and inferior quality; while in this country, the continued wet wea.her happening just at the critical tuinelwhen the seed was cut and in the fields, the crop,
boichatsonegtime promise adtob q abundant whs as belalmost entirely destroyed, andthe, tridflne stoquntitysave wai ho of very inferior qualty. The crop in Germany is represented to be about an average, and, although the quality will not be equa to what has been produced in some former years, still there will be a fair quantity of good useful growing
