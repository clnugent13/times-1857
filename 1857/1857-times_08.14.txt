Some charges had beea recently made against him which compelled him to solcit a patient hearing for what he hiad to offer in his defence. Tbohe chsagebad not been made in A obscure place, or by persons sE insignificant that he m,ight properly sufir them to pas by #nnotioed, but had been brought in the. House of Com. moqs by an bon. gentlemsuflinwg tho imoortnt and responsible situatioVs of one of Her Majesty's Unider-Secretailes of [ ate. He was sure, tberefore. that their lordaships would not:attribute his anxiety to vindicafe himself from these -ges to any feeling of egotism, but rathe4 to the respect vhlch was due to their lordshipa. It wa-withgreatf relud tanoe.that he oocuspled any portion of their lordship.' UJmn I'ioe especially at this period of the session and in the prP#en state of publio business, by any matter of a peif -zonil pAture, but th4t. reluctance would be tihi greater if this matter, though it did most ;nearly concern himself individually, did not likewise involVe some, questions of very considerable public interest, in -hvich not only his right rev. brethren of the episcopil be*ch, but the whole body of the clergy of the church of England, were very deeply interested. Though lie had not t h# advantage of speaking in " the pressnoe of a very fall attendance of their lordship, yet he was happy to sea somq nople lords present mout compeent to form a judgment on sunh-queetions as he was about to refer to, and whose ittention he respectully invited to his statement. He did not Complain of the severity of ,tno.remarks which appeared to have been made on his cenduot, though the motives which mighb reasonably have been sfpposed to actuate his eonduct, and the object he had in view,' might perhaps have bdee allowc,a little to-temperO that sverity, or at events to divert from him- that-tiorm- of indignto hcapae "s aekbet excited b7= Pepr,eeentations of -his conduct. serc was onervery simIteshswertobe-given to the charge .ainst him; and whlcb,^ he wks aware, had already been pMven thrqug the -kindness of a right rev. prelate sitting nearhinu le couldl repeat what that right rev. prelate - Ui,a * l b l r:yt D it of any violation of 'he law-forthe charge against him amounted to nothing less than that he had violated the law, and wilfully disobeyed, its enactmente-he had done so unconsciously and unwittingly- through ' ignorance or error, and he was quite sure!:their lordships -would be disposed to give hirm credit for the sinceri of that declaration. But on the present occadou he vcould not be content to accept such a measure of their-lordshipf? confidence, or to re his caAe snply on the atiertion of sdmethingonly.kun n,to , self,.and le ttusted to be able to sasfy theirlor4ships?hinothinghad occud throughout the whole of this- tra,nsiteion to warraint any such charge, but that all the facts of the case pointed directly to an opposite concluion. Ble was quite lling to admit that, if the charge could be pzoved,.harlly ny form of censure could be too strong or severe; but before he proceeded to a brief statement of facis, which would enable their lordships to appre¢Ate his nreFent position, be was anxious to maoe one ohseriatio; which he begged their lordships to bear in mind nd bear long *ith them through the whole of )is stteenet, namely,that froM the peeuLiar mature of thecase ho nota ' only hki the right, but it was his bounden dut*, to require the cl'e andvaost oonclasive eviden¢ s tif. his nild. thty'he did[not possees that discreti oi with whichr he Se lieved-the law did invest him, b;fore he did the ae .*hoh t was supposed ho wanrequired by the>awto do. It was his bounden duty to satisfy himselfthat in so going heoshodi not besoting sa free gent, but.aimply in a miisterial capacity, and in obedience to the'?aw, because the nature ot the case was such that if he did poaesa diretioni¢ power he was bound to take care xthat he di4isotexertpo*e in a way to inflict njury on any one, and more particulrly on a person. whose rights apd interest& he was bound to protect. That which he was -caUed, onx to do would ha"ie had that effect, and it woul d saviadded to the labours of a person. engaged in some of the, most laborious duties attaching to any parish within ,lis diocese' with out adding to his very scauty, remuneraton, The ~ncoome of - the vicar, of swansea, independent 'of anY occasional and fluctuating fees, only`ambxted to the tuam ol ,981. a-yea, and thatsmall Usum had to be collecte, froth somke :1,784 individuals, and tberefore.'shpir lordship. might judge whether it would Rot he .ze"otable that some deductions 'should-bomade oaon that account'rom the nomnal amount. He woutd prooeed to cal their lordships' attention t isfe v facts in referenceto the origin of this dispute, which, he would -not say, had beeu~ studiously kept out of view, but vhic4, had been passed over in sllence in AUl the discussions 'whichlhadtaken placein.theHouieof Qouipons6nthesubijeLt He held in his hand acopy of the published correspondeite which had taken place between the -'Swenshn Bur i Boird . and himself. It opened' with a letter addressed to him by the Mayor of Swansea on behalf of the burial board, dated September L 1855, in,which he atate4 that every pcOib1e exerton had been, made to procure, an el'gible site for the new cemetery, that it hld ben *found extremely difficalt to select such dsite, bnt that at length one had been met iv'th which appeared to be the best that could be obtained7 - He added, however, that it was open lo some objections, and, among others, that it would be necessAry to take the funerals across bridges which, at certain atUte" of the tide, would bo open for the navigation of vessels.

HOUSE OF COMMONS, THXmSDAY, AuGusT 13. Tae SPEZA tR assumed the chair at 12 o'clock. SHEPHERD'S DISABILITIES REMOVAL BILL. On the motioa of Mr. ESTcoUsiTr this Bill was read a third time and passed. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE HOUSES OF PARLLA. MBNT. MZr. ESTCOUET said, seeing the First Commissioner of Works in his place, he begged to ask him a question. The other day the right hou. gentleman, In answer to a question put to him by the hon. member for North Staffordshire (Mr. Adderley), stated that he had entered into communic.- tion with the local authorities of Lambeth with regard to ceztain noxious trades carried on in that parish, and which, as was obvious to the perception of every one who put his nose out of the library windows of that House, were to a considerable extent the cause of the bad vapours which entered tho House from the direco tion of the Thames. The quesion he haa to ask of the right hon. gentleman was, whether that commu. inication had led to any result, and if so, whether he felt hbimself at liberty to state it to the House ? Sir B. HALL said he was glad that his hon. friend had put that question to hima, for the matter to 'which it related had become one of a very serious nature in conse. quence of the course which the local authorities in the parish of Lambeth had chosen to pursue on this occasion. With the permission of the House he would read a letter which he had sent to the vestry of Lambeth on the subject, and their answer :- " Office of Works, &c., July 30. "Sir,-By directioL of the First Comnmis3ioner of Her Mlajesty's Works, &o., I send you herewith an extract from a report from Air. Goldsworthy Gurney, who has the charge under this board of the warming, lighting, and ventilatine of the Houses of Parliament, respecting the nuisances a2 fecting the atmosphere of those Houses from offensive manufactories on the other side of the river. I also enclose a copy of a letter, dated the 23d inst., from Mr. Gurney to the solicitor for this department, specifying some of the manufactories referred to by him * and I am to request tbht you will 6ubmit these papers to the vestr of the pariah of Lambeth, and move them to cause steps to be taken for The suppression or abatement of the nuisances in question. " I am, &c., "A' u AusRD iJI2, Secetary. "Thomas Roffey, 3Esq." That letter was sent on the 3l0th of July, and in roply to It he received on Tuesday last the following communication from the vestry clerk:- "The Vestry of the Parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. "V vestry-hall, Kenzington-green, Aug. 10. "Sir,-I beg to inform you that your communication of the 30th ult, respecting the nuisances affecting tho atmosphere of the Houses of Parliament from offensive manufactories on this side of the river was submitted to a vestry tueeting on the 6th inst., and, in reply thereto, it was resolved that Mr. Austin be informed that this vestry hms had the matter referred to in his letter under their considera. ion, and are not prepared to take any legal proceedings in oonnexion therewith. "I am,.&o., " Tsom- Roppzy, Clerk of the Vetry. " Alfred Austin, Esq." The Eoaee would therefore see how important it-was that the Act of 1855 should have contiined the clause inserted on the recjmmendation of the select committee, imposing penalties on the local authorities for the neglect of duty on thefr park, and how much it was to be regretted that that clause should bave afterwards been expunged. (Eear, hear.) He would ouly sAd that he hoped eaxy In next ssion the I Houe would pus a shorb Bill t remed7 the omision, and to compel the loal *authorities, on reqUslltlon beingmade to them, to act in tb.e discharge of their duty. (Iear, lear.)- D-IVO1O3 A21D MATRIMOTNiAL CAUSE3 BILL. The House then went into committee on this BiU,. re suminig the oonsideration of it at the word "adultery" in the 25th clause, immediately after the word "incestuous," which was retained upon a divisdon when the Bill w=as la` before the committee. Lord J. MANTBItS moved the insetion, after the words "incestuous adultery," of-thewords "orof adulteryoom. mitted in the conjugal residence." He complained that the Government had ignored the existence of the codes collated by Mr. M'Qaeen, which seemed to have been collated for the gnidance of the House of Lords, bht not for the guidance of the House of Commons. He had not bean able 1n the short time which had been allowed to oonsider the blue-book to make a critical analysis of all these foreign codes, but it was clear that with regard to Fiance, which was the most matured law, and the result of the opinions of Napoleon and some of the ablest men of his day, the wife had the right of demanding separation a mensd et Utoo where the husband had committed adultery in the conjugal residence. He had adopted these words in the French code as translated by Mr. M'Queen. In Sweden the wife was permitted to claim a divorce on the ground of adultery alone on the part of her husband. In Bavaria divorce a medsd et thorowas granted indiscriminately to the wife and to the hasband. Sardinia and the Two Sieies,hebelieved,followed the rule of France. It was obvious that many of the most heartrending, most aggravated, and most crael eases of adultery would not be met by the words in the clase. (Hear.) If they were about to change the law of England with respect to divorce, and to give the wife a right to claim divorce under certain circumstances, they would do well to consider the provisions of the law in other countries, and, in his opinion, the decision arived at by the ?Freiich jarists was more in accordance with good sense and with the kindness and respect which they ought to show to the female sex than the extraordinary provisions - of the clause as it stood. He therefore moved the insertion of these words. The ATTORNEY-GENER&i said, the noble lord had again made complaint of the shortness of time which had been allowed for the consideration of this Bill. Lord J. MANNERS.-No I Of this paper. The ATTOIBNEY.GENEIAL.-If the Bill laid the foundations of the law anew, no doubt that blue-books and many othermuch more important documents ought to be weighed and considered. But the Bil proposed no addition to the law. It vas intended only to embody the actual administration of the law, and to transfer the administration of it to a more accessible and, hb thought, a more competenttribunal. Undoubtedlytheprinciple ol the amendment was traceable in the codes of other countries. He believed the same principle was to be found in the Roman law. If a husband brought a concubine into the matrimonial reidence, and there carried on cohabitation under the domicile of the wife, such an offence against the matrimonial law, such an outrage upon the conduct which ought to be observed, was recognized as a just ground of divorce,-not divorce merely in the senge of separation, but divorce a vinoulo matrimon ii. But a great number of other topics might be legitimate subjects of consideration if it were proposed to make an entirely new law. The Bil was accepted by the House as involving only an expression of the existing administration of the law of divorce, and upon that principle he declined toenterintothe consideration of the question whether this head of divorce ought or ought hlot to be added to those others which the law now recognzed. EAch individual cause of divorce had been sanctioned by the House of Lords as a fit and proper cause. Each cause had become a precedent binding on the House of Lords, and therefore the law of the country. The Bill was confined to the causes hitherto recognized, and, on tha part of the Go. vernment, he declined to add to them. Mr. GLADSTONE took objection to the speech of the Attorney-General alike as a statement of facts and an enunciat'on of principle. (Hear, hear.) The furthertheyadvauced in the dussion of this Bill the more obvious did it be. comne that it was most essential it should be subjected to an emination and scrutiny which had not been given either by the House of Lords who passed or by Her Majesty's Governmuent who were responsible for it. (Hear, hear.) Let them try the statement of his hon. and learned frien i first as a matter of fact, and next as a matter of principle. The Attorney-General said they were only going to embody the expression of the administration of the existing law. Was that true in point of fact, or was it not? (Hear, hear.) The Government invited them, and if the House should so decide they were about to abolish -the action of criminal conversation. Was that an expression of the existing law, or was it not a change of enormous importance if joined with no other, and was it not a change which of itself required the maturest and most careful discussion? (Hear, hear.) They were going to constitute adultery a criminal offence, or something like it, or, if not a criminal offence, a nondescript transaction, neither criminally nor civilly punishable. Was that embodied in the existing law? (Hear, bear.) Was that the expression of the existing law? His learnedfriend said he declined to admit the amendment on the ground that the Bill made no change in the law. Would his learned friend have the kindness to acquaint him in what case a woman had obtained a divorce from her husband oa the ground of desertion during two years and upwards? (Eear, hear ) The right hon. gentleman here paused for a reply, and the Attorney-General was about to answer the question, when Sir G. GREY rose and sid that if every hon. mnember vho addressed the committee were to put a specific question in the middle of his speech, and then wait for a reply the only result would be to delay the proceedings. (Hear, hear.) Mr. GLADSTONE said the object of his question was not to create delaT, but to prevent It. He believed there was no case in which divorce bad been given for adultery coupled with desertion for two years and upwards; but before proceeding to comment on the speech of the Attoiney-General in that sense he had thought it fair to his hon. and learned friend, as he was not himself minutely conversant with the history of proceedings in the House of Lords, to put a question to bim upon a matter of fact, which, if it were capable of answer at all, might have been answered in three words. Such had been his purpose, and he was in the judgment of the committee whether it would not have tended to shorten debate rather than to prolong it. (Elear, hear.) However, tht r was no answer forthcoming, and he was therefore driven to the alternative of supposing that there was no such case a dvorce for adultery coupled with desertion. That being so, what boame of the statements of the Attorney-Genera, and what confidence could be reposed in his accuracy in describing matters of faot? The Attorney-General had told them distinctly that he refused to entertain a proposition which he admitted had much reason in it, because It was making an alteration in our law of divorce. Well, according to facts, judged by the silence of the Attorney-General, the Bill already made an alteration in what his hon. and learned friend Called our law of divorce d vinculo. The Bill provided for an entrely mew category of divorces d trinssuo, and therefore he called upon the Attorney-General on his own principles either to strike out of the Bill divorce & vincuao for adultery coupled with desertion for two year and upwards, or else not to attempt to stifle discussion uponthe important amendment of the noble lord tho member or Lioestershire. (Hear.) He now came to that part of the speech of the Attorney-General in which he dealt with this question as one of principle. The hon. and learned gentleman had told the committee that itwas their businews to embody in the Bil an expression of the administration of the exsting law, and not to change it in any respect whatever. He ventured to say that a more preppos terous proposition never was submitted toParliament. The Attorney-General had spoken of the administration of the existing law as if it had been something fLxed upon a principle; whereas, on the contray, it had been in a constant state of growth and developement from generation to generation. The House of Lords, acting like wise and prudent men, had dealt with cases according to circumstances, and when new cases had come forward of sufficient gravity to induce them to think that they ought to be included by parity of reasoning within the principles upon which they had formerly granted divorce Bills they had made fresh admissions of such cases accordingly. That was a rational prinoiple ; and not only with regard to those new cases but with respect to the ro-marriage of the guilty person and the inter-marriage of the two guilty parties the practice of the House of Lords had also been in a stas of growth ad developement. To represent therefore, that the administration of the existing law wa's somethingconsistent, systematized, and fixed, constituting of Itsef a fir standng ground, so that we had nothing else to do but to place our feet there, he must say was a proposition entirely unworthy of the Attorney-General. More; he ventured to say it was a proposition which the A ttorney-General would never have made if it had not n for the extraordinary circumstances under which this Bill was being,ressed through Parliament, and which rendered it abaolufoy necessary to sp discussion and prevent that consideration which the subject required. (Hear, hear.) Such was the true reason for saying that the Bill was merely an expression of the administration of the existing law. Nor was this all that the extraordinary speech of the Attorney-General opened to the committee. He byi understood that the real object of the Bill was to get r.d of the quasi-judicial proceedings before the HEouse of Lords, and to substitue for them a real judicial proceed. ing in a court; but the Attorney-General now called upon the committee to pass the Bill upon the ground that it was merely an expression ofthe exist ing law, and' ten for the improvement and 'extension of that law to trust to the new precedents which would from time to time be established by private Bills of divorce brought before the House of Lords, and receiving their affirai=on, therebybeoonbing equivalent to judgments upon appeals. If the Attorney-General really contemplated that the law of divorce was still to remain exactly in the same fluent and uncertain state, subject to modification, relaxation, and addilion by successive private Bi'lls, he could only say that he cut from under his feet whatever little narrow shred or strip of groand yet remained for him to stand upon, and again supplied a conclusive proof of the crndity of the Bill and the scarcely decent haste with which it vas being pressedthrough Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Differing entirely from the Attorney-General in reiard to hhi facts and principles, he likewise diffred from him in the conclusion at which he had arrived. He thought there were very strong grounds for entertaining the ptoposal of Ahe noble i lord the member for elcestershiie, or somethingequivalent ] to it, The noble lord proposed that they should introdoe into the BiU a provison b1 which not only. bigamous adultery, adultery with cruelty, adultery with incest, and adultery with desertion- should supplyr a Wife with ! pounds for a divorce, but Dliewise adultery eom- miged in the conjugal residence. They were goingto give' divorce to a woman for adfaltery with e2aelty. &w' adultery with crulty was a thi'ng most unlrown in-the higher classes of society, because the crnelty mentioned in thre-Can didmot mean moral:erulty, hut cruclty.attended ' with the effcot of produsing bodily fear, He was smidthst paled wit adultery, which the claso as It stood would 'Mr. GLADATOE iJaid, ta whien thi queation should be discused hereafter, when this -ouri ehoad havo bomonits fzinl.adad whee thb pubIs mind should be more ightened It ould be diffilt probably to resi the amendment of ,la hon. friend themnember forWee Sre. The opinion had ofen been. expreasd, that If the diasolu- marYdo rlbm age wene once admitted in oer onases it vod bo ml3blo to find any brovA gronad on whioB they couldtakq their stand against furthheir asion indeed, wag not the current opnion, but be. hr stziven to imprems upon the mind of the committee that they ought not to plae too much confiden0e in temporary and local opinion, but that they ought to elevate their vision,and to take less contracted views of the operations of tho human mind than thea were apt to do fr9m a defec, he feared, inherent in th eir naturl Ms5. poition-a defect which prevented their assuming the exiatence of anything In heaven or earth except that which ehanced to be dreamt of in their philosophy, and which made them imagine that what they knew in their sphere comprehended all in God's univse, and that the notlons current amoong themselves afforded grounds for nermanset and durable legislation. He proteste eanesuly agaist that doctrine. He had warned, and he would again wan tho committee againstthe undue confidence which itweemela inclined to repose in the fSasionable opinions of the day~ and he claimed that they should found their legiation upon the bass of a wide experience. At the same time, he thought that in thits instance it would be inconsistent with the principle upon whih be had protest'sd against the second reading, were he to join with h hon. friend i; the introduction of a comyploely new category of caue for which divorce should be granted. Entertaining gloomy thoughts asto the effect of this Bill he did not wis to accelerate the fulfilment of bis predictons - and although he agreed with his hou, friend that there were causes in whichi the misconduot of a husband to a wife-t-ran ad.uelty,fo emple-laid the ground for a divorce, such as itr wa, yet he could not joinn the introductlon of this new chapter into the history of such cases. e d,id not think that the principle which his hon. fi;end roposed to introduce was called for by the coumtry, and heoeared that while appearing to do an act of humn ty in particular Instanoe, they would, if they agreed to the amendment, Inflict a new and a deep injury upon the In. terert of those for whose welfare they were so anxious Mr. B12XTON explained that on a former occasion. although he hd been apparently mIsunderstood, he had In tended to saythat the distinction dra in the Bil was not an arbitra distinctlon of the Attorney-General's, b'ut a istnction drawn by natre. Without strong ground he shbold not feel justified in drawing an artificial lino between the rights of men and the rights ol romen. The amendment was negativod without a division. Mr. HEWI1 Y asked for a legal definition of the temn 44dsse rt.ion." Lord J. MANNERS asked for a sImiar definition of the phrsse " ithout reasonable excuse." The CHAIRMAN reminded the committee that there wa no motion before the chair. Mr. HENLEY then, to put himself in order, would move as an amendment fhe omission of the word "de. ,sertion." The ATTORNEY-GENIERAL sald, he should have thought that the right hon. gentleman, who in his city of magistrate Aust have madue many orders upon husbds for the support of wives deserted by them, would have been perfectly accnintad with the meaning of the word. When a man hana btoaether left his wife and children, not simply refusing to cohab4, but quitting hia house with no intention of rsturning s was desertion. It had he believed, in a case which had come before the House of Lords been called abandonment. Of course such a construction ^f the word excluded temporary or consrained absence. With regard to the queStiop of the noble lord wfhether conFtrained ah-. sence, urcder a criminal sentence, involved desertion, hiS reply wFould be certainly not. Desertion implied volunStar a ban do nmnent, Lord LOVAIE asked whether a wife, whose husband, -condemned to penal servitude, did not return at the expiration of his sentence, would be alowed to coutrict a second marige on thacore of desertion t Tho ATTOBNEY-GENERAL sid that, suposing a nan to have been tranSprted, to have completed his sentence, and not to have returned home or been heard of for two years sfterwards, the wife would be entitled to marry again. Mr. AYRTON observed that, by the criminal law, to leave a wife chargeable to the pari constituted an offence. but when they wereo remitted to the question of simple deserdon he saw no-end to the difficulties which would aisa in the constrction of that word. If a husband, stIll koep. inIup hishouse in England, went to live in Puar, and ther committed an act of adultery after two years' absewle, was this to be oonsidered adultery coupled with. desertion? Mr. GLADSTONE thought they were Involved in con. siderable diflhultyvrith regard to this matter of desertion. What was the use of the words "without reasonable excuse" as they stood connected with the word " desertion?"' Surely theword " desertion" of itaelk was sufficient, for if there wero reasonable excuse for the abeence of the husbatnd how could there be any desertion I Acoording to -the defnition of the Attorey.General, a man who d a house in Bel- rve-square in which his wife dwelt, and anothsv in Dorset-square in which he kept a mistress, could not be subected to the penalties of: this Bill, even though he might not once in two or ten yeas visit the houee in which his wife dwelt. It wa said, forsooth, that because that. mana paid all the expenses of his house in Belrave-square he had not deserted his wife. That certaiily was rather stagering. T.he Attorney-Geneal had been asked to give a dehniti1ron the wor desertion, an& his answer was-a tion of retuning. But in the cae le had su ped, surely tho man who rever wentto tbehouseXlwbhih s wife dwelt must be heldtolhave deserted her; hehadnointentionof re- h to Belmvecsquame The definition of the AttorneyGeeral, therefor e,ntirely broko down Then, with:goard to a clms of persons m the humbler ranksoflife-the ors Ia the commerl"i navy, was the onus of proof of an intention to desert to be tlhown upon the wife in case of her husband having gone abroad and not returned within the od mentioned in the Bill? It frequently happened that a sailor remained abroad fipds of two years for a liti mate cause. How was it posiblo that in such caes the wife could esbtabish a case of desertion? The committee were entirely in the dark as to the probable operation of that pat of the clause relating to desertion. Mr. LYGON suggested that if the Attorney-Geueral re. ferred to the Code of Holland, which enacted that in ase of a maliciou desertion of five years divorce might be obtained, he might be able to framue a claune which would be more -satisfactory to the committee. M1. GLADSTONE-I ask my hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General whether he has considered that? (Laughter.) The ATTORN -Y.GENERAL saId, that in regard to desertion, the Court would judge of the animus of the party from the overt act. The essence of the crime consistd in rho intention of the person committing it. Whether the absent husband communicated with the wife, or sent money for her support, was a matter that could be easily ascertained. Mr. CLAY complained that the committee had been occupied for hours in the profitless task of splitting straws. He could hardly oonceive a case in which a man of ordinay sense could not readily pronounce whether or not there ha been desertion. The case put by the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxford University jIaIgd by te rules of common sens, and he believed so be the r-les of law, would be clearly one of desertion. Hear, ofear. Lord J. MANNERS denied it was a waste of time to endeavour to comprehend the legal meaning of their own legislation. It would be a great injustce to refuse to a woman whose husband had not only coummitted adultery but also some great crime which caused him to be trans. ported for life that relief which was to be granted to wives m cases that were far les agravated. Yet that would be the effect of the oonstruction put upon the clause by so high an authority as the Attorney-GeneraL Sir D. NORREYS reiterated the complaint that in disuting about words they wers lodng sight of the substance. ow, he asked, could it be said tht a man who lived in another house with a mistress, and habitually remained away from his wife, had not committed desertion? Lord LOVAINE rldiocled the Idea of thzeir blindly agree Ing to words of which they did not know the purport, and then leaving it to the judges to interpret them. Sir W. HEATHCOTE wa quite willqin that the view of tho hon. rnember for Mallow (Sir D. Norreas) should be acted upon, and that open adultery should be held to be desertion. (Hear, hear.) The limitations introduced into this clause were none of theirs (the Opposition); bhb, if those limitations were insisted on, it was only reasonable that they should have a definite signification. ?r. GrIADSTONE believed it bad been truly affirmed that the committee had been asked to adopt words of which they did not know the meaning. It was not his doctrine at the case he had put was oneof desertion. A numberof hon. and learned members declared decisively that it would not be desertion, but the hon. member for Hull said that comnon senee and the courts of law would alike declare a, it was a case of desertion. He always suspected his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General when be shifted his gro'und. (A Laugh.) [The Attorney-GeneraL-I did not diift my groud.] That was matter for argument. le begaum wth a definition of desertion, which he defined tob -"wben a man had. ceased to livo with his wife ana had .no ,intntion of returning." But when the lawyers sqreed that no case of desertion could bce proved on this defuittion of desertion, his hon. aitd learned friend did not return to his definition, but gad the courts would b guide by the animus dese,-endi. But what was the m oansg of the word deserendi? (Hear.) That difficul still remained.. He hoped that his right hon. friend would not make himself responsible for the working of tho clause, the responsibilt of which properly belonged to the Govern. went. The fac was that arliament was asked to pass Bils with haste xnd precipitanay a the end of tho session, to make up the tale when it was ahorter than usual, and the Acts so pawsed went into the cours of law with great disparagemnent to the reputation of Parliament, which was in the foUowing session asked to amend them. (Hear.) Mr. HENLRY ha>d gtcat dificultyiumaking up his mind, after the opiniops that had been expressed ulpOnt the mean. ing of the w6rd~ desertion, whether his amendment would be of any aribao to the woman. He should therefore consent to the r:ithdrwd of his amendment. The amenldment was therefore withdrawn. Sir D. NORREYS proposed to strike out the words, "for two Years.and upwards" leaving it to the courts to dedde Whether deertio,n. had been of such a character as to justify the c,laim p the wtlfe. Mr. CLAY wished to explain that whrthe had said .wa that o,ommen sense-would call the - case put bg the tight' Ien. gentle,rar, (M,r.Gla.datone). one of desertion, andthat' he-elleved.< the-e,ofril law-would agree In 'ta -'oi,ld not ag theeo the amendment of the hoo. member°for Dfialuw.

Mrt. LYGON su_ggested that the amendment of the hen. mnember for Yopghtl should be confined to thee wors "on adultery, attendedd with aggravated circumstance.." The ATTORNEY-GEN'ERAL had some. difficulty In reconoiing the, speech of the hon. and lewed member for Youghal with his amendment., The case which he pul was t aut of a husband ot openi to the charge of adultory bimaelf or of being acessory to the adultery of his wife, btt who, hAving de. prived her of the advantages arising from his wealth, and redulcd her to poverty, was In soom der the cause of her degradation. Such a cse as. this he re s ted h a a reason for the amendment which he now. proposed.to the House that amendment being "adult coupled with ag atesd Ill-treatment' as caumes whieht should entitle the wife to a divorce. This was introducing, a new title to divorce iu favour of theo whe; for It introduced adultery, and not adultery alone bti adultery ahercvated by rU-treatment. But in the cae on which therosn.xan luared mecmber rested hi. Argument ahere was no adultery, but heimpl what he described as Ill. treatment.

Nowv, I wil meet may noble friend by no retort of 'anuguge,' by no epithet such as, perhaps, ina a moment of temper, I in the lower classes the oonsequence of their giving a remedy for adultery with cruelty, ad not for adultery alone, would be in a mnltitude of instances to induce the husband to add cruelty to adultery with a view to divorce. (Hear, hear.) That which in the hilgher clases bore an analogy to adultery with cruelty in the lower was adultery with insult-adultery paraded under the roof and in the view of the sufiering wife. Cases of that kind were common in the upper ranks-of society. They were not likely to find among those classes adultery with desertion, adultery with incest, or adultery with bigamy, bat he was afraid there were many examples of that Eort of adultery which was attended with the eatest amount of convenience and luxury to the profligate fusband, and which consisted in his converting bis own house into the scene of his infamy, vwhile at the same time he compled with the demands of society by maintaining outwardly peaceful relations with his wife. That was the form which the temptation took in the higher classes, and that was exactly what the Government had omitted from their BilL (Hear, hear.) He hoped, therefore, that the committee would adopt the amendment of the noble lord the member for Leicestershire, or something equivalent to itin ite spirit and its effect. (Hear, hear.) Mfr. DRUMMOND said, he should proceed upon the same principle with regard to the noble lord's amendment as he would with his own, viz. to support any proposition having for its object the establisament of perfect equality be4tweea the sexes. (Rear.) The clause as brought in by the Govern. ment would permit a man to turn his house into a brothel, while he could discoard his wife fora single act of adulter Grosser and more horrible systematic cruelty could scarcel; be devised (hoar), and to the shame of English gentlemen be it said, that this was the only country where such a law was tolerated. (EHear.) Mr. HUGESSEN, as one of the majority who voted for the second reading of the Bill, begged to state that he had not done so U)on the grounds assigned by the Attorney-General. (ear.) When he voted for the second reading he had not carefully considered all the details of the measure, but, beleving that the present state of the law of divorce was not satisfactory, he had confidence in Her Majesty's Government t'at they would nropose a satable measure for the amendment of that law. But to had the strongest objections to the clause now before the committee, and should vote for every amendment that would tend to better the unfair position in which a wife was now placed. (Hear.) It was proposed that a sin which, by whomsoever comnitted,was equal in the eight of God, should be permitted inono case but not ia the other. He demurred to that principle, believing that the sanctity of h6me would be best maintained by perfect equality existng between husband and wife. The clause proposed to protect the lust of the man from the scandal attendant upon an application for divorce, and to pour out the vials of legislative wrath upon the vwoman alone. Women's Sin generally arose from the weakness of their nature-men's From the strength of their passion. (Heasr, hear.) Itwas Eaidthat thesin of awoman led to greater social evil than that of a man, but was it not a great Eocial evil that a man should be permitted repeatedly and withimp mity toindulgein sin, and would not snchastate of thelaw hold out strong temptationstomentoindtlge in vice? He believed the clause as it stood was not just, that it was oposed to morality and to the Christian religion, and, therefore, he should vota deliberately and conscientiously for the amendment of the noble lord, as well as for every amendment which would lead to the establishment of principles of equality between the sexes. (Loud cheers.) Mr. NAPIEPR concurred in every observation that had fallen from the hen. gentleman who had just spoken. As the Lord-Advocate was now in his place he (Mr. Napier) would remind the HEouse that in Scotland husband and wife were placad upon a footing of perfect equality. In this country there was no law governing such matters, which were left to be dealt with by private legislation. In cases of adultery the Legislature had declared that there was no scriptural objection to granting divorces under special circuarstances, but that they shoald be dealt with as public licy might suggest. When a wife applied for a divorce the Agislatare hA decided not as a matter of law but of public policy not to grant it. He had already voted for a perfect equality between husband and wife, and he could not see that there would be any danger likely to arise from adopting the amendment, because wives would not be likelyto apply for divorces on account of simple adaltery alone, but would do so only in cases where the husband's adultery was accompanied by circumstances which rendered continued cohabitation imposible. (Hear, hear.) Mr. AYRTON supported the amendment. He would ask the Government whether a wife was not entitled to a divorce whose husband introduced a concubine into his house, or maintained a mistress with a separate establishment ? A husband scarcely ever deserted his wife; it was the wife, who was compelled by his vicious conduct to leave his house; and, under such circumstances, the clause would not allow her to receive a divorce. Before pas-ing an Bill to amend the law of divorce, they were bound to see that it was made conformable to the principle of justice, and was likely to afford a remedy for a raost aggravated form of suffering and injustice. Mr. HENLEY expressed his great surprise at the course which had been taken by the Attorney-General on this amendment. The hon. and learned gentleman did not condescend to say a word against the amendment, bat with an a lamb possessed certainly by no other nan in the House (hear, hear), he refused to take it: into consideration, be. cause he said Parliament was not now engaged ia altering the law of divorce. Bat was that the cae? (Hear, hear.) In this clause there were four cases for which a divorce might be obtained by the wife, and two out of those were new. (Rear, hear.) The Royal commissioners stated that only four divorces el vincuZo had ever been granted to a wife, two of which were for incestuous adultery, and in the other two there was the element of bigamy, There was no one fin the House, then, with the exception of the Attorney-General, who would have the hardliood to say that they were not altering the law in this clause. (Hear.) The committee, too, had just as much right to complain of the conduct of the Home Secretary. The right hon. gentleman, when a plain question was put, got up and objected to its being an,swered because it would lead to delay. That was the right hon. gentleman's idea of the manmer in which this Bill was to ee discussed. Again, the oommittee had a right to hear the Lord-Advocates viewss apon this question. What was the reason that the law was to be different in the two countries? If the law was wrong in Scotland the LordAdvocate ought to bring in a Bill to amend it. If it were right, why should it not be right forEngland? (HIear, hear.) It was absrd to say that Parliament was not enactinz a new law with regard to divorce, for there had been no Law at all before in which the Houseof Commons had concurred. The House of Lords alone had laid downv the conditions under 'which divorces could be obtained. In establishing a new law of. divorce the wife ought to have the some rights as the husband. Nobody had denied that the sin of adultery was the same in the hus. band as in the wife, and the remedy ought to be the same. But one member in the House-the hon. member for Newport-had had the boldness to admit that the only reason for maing this difeerence was the difference between the socia effetas of the cime in the two sexes. The amendment of the noble lord was a good amendment, and he should give it his cordial support. The LORD-ADVOCATE: WaS glad hofind that the right non, gentleman had altered his mind as to the convenience of assimilating the laws of the two eountries. The law of Scotland proceeded upon the principle that the twro sexes should beona footingof equality, and that that principle was a correct one was proved by the result of ecial eperience. No doubt there was a difference between the social effects of the guilt of the two parties. It was a differenoe which was recognized by society and by public opinion, and it was so plain and so elementary that it was unnecesay to point it out. Even the other sex at once admitted it, and condonation on the part of one sex might be amicable, while on the part of the other it would be degrading. (Hoar.) But, notwithstanding that, he was of opinion that the rights of the two parties ought to be equal (hear, hear), becsause there wras this countervailing balance, that nothing but absolute extremity would induce the wife to apply for the remedy. (Hear, hear.) This was not merely a theoreticalreason, for it was borne out completely by Scotch experience. In Scotland it was found that the Tpropor. tion wasas three to two. Oat of 17 cases in a y6arina population of 2,000,000, seven were applications from wives, and 10 from husbands. Out of 175 cases of divorce, 73 were at the instance of the wife and 102 at the instance of the husband. It was a mistake to sappose that these divorces were only available for persons residing in and about Edinburgh. e had made inquiry, and he had found, on analysing the cases, that petitions prodeeded from all parts of the country; but it might appear that they came mostly from Edinburgh because manyof the parties would come to reside in EDinburgh while they were suing out a divorce. He had agreed in the principle of the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Surrey the other evening with regard to the omision of the word' " incestuous," but he had not voted for it for fear that it wfould entail the rejection of the Bill by the other House. Mr. HENLEY explained that he had never expressed any opinion other than. that marriage was dissoluble. Lord J. MANNERS thought the speech of the le irned lord, which did him infinite credit, demanded the serioas consideration of the committee, because it had been announced tha it would be necessary hereafter to introduce fresh lawvs applicable to the cases of the colonies of Ireland and Scotland-[The AT on?rny-GxN3nM.-Not as to Scotland]-applicable then to Ireland, India4 and the colonies. Were these laws to he fonded rupon what the Lord-Advo. -toe Iaa properly desmibecl as tho -princdples of immutable justice, or Upon those of this Bill? The argument of the Attorney-General prooeeded upon two assumptions. The first was that four cases which had been deoided by private Acts of Parliament in the House of Lords were to be regarded as settling and establishing the law of the country; and the recond was that this clause in no way altered the law as laid down in those four cases. Admitting the first of these assumptions for the sake of arTument, the other could not bo supported, because, while th ause gave a divorce for adultery ooupled with deser. tion for two years, no such ground was recognized in the four cases decided by the House of Lords. The LordAdvocate did not sand alone in the opinion which he had expressed. It was the universal opinion of Scotch lawyers that if a divorce were Allowed to the husband on account of teo wife's adultery, the same remedy ought to be gven to the wife on account of the husband's offence. hat would he the practical effect of tbis clause if the ameandment were rejected ? As a divorce was to be granted for adulte coupled with desertion for two years, a hus oand Who showed so much respect and regard for the feelings of his injured wife as not to commit this great sin and crime in her presence, or under her roof, would be visited with the penalties of-the law; but the man who flagrantly and shamelessly dishonoured the mar' bed 'who kept his coisoubine in the house to the daily and hourly torture of his wife's feelings, would be sanctioned and upheld by the lAw in the violationuof his marriage vows. Traly it seemed to him that justi¢e, the principles of relion, and soclal expediency all combined to condemn the clause as it (Hear, hear.) TheATTORNEYrGFNERAL, said,-I think thastIhave a certain right to complain of some of the remarks which have been made with regard to myself in connexion with thi4 Billin quarters where I should least have expected thom, but I am xure that upon cool condderation the oommlttee wil age tMt thoe Mtta which hayg bona made upon me are withont the slightest foundation. This Bill was cou. minitted to nry charge PA being based upon the limited prin. ciplo of embodying the existing law with regard to divorce, and I presented it to the House as being based upon that principle, and I explained upon the second rzading of the Bill the course which wo proposed to adopt in order to carry out that principle. It is undoubtedly true that divorce on account of desertion for two years and adultery has not in that specified form been embodied in any Bill which has passed the House of Lords, but, although the statement which I made may be carped, at as it has been, it was substantially correct. Well, then, I *r¢ now, sueh being the principle upon which the BiU'was introduced invited to enter into the consideration of a auestion, no doubt of great importance, and one which it wouTd be most fitting, if not most material, to consider if we were propoeinz to place the law of marriage on a new foundation; but that is not the function whioh we are now called upon to perform. I made no such representation when I introduced the Bill into the House, nor was it upon any sucb principle that the majority of this House voted for the second reading of the mseasre. I think therefore that I-have some right to complain of the language which has been adopted.by the noblelordand bythe righthon. gentlemanthe member orthe University of Oxford with regard to mysecf-naniely, that I have disdained to consider this subject. If we were about to enter into the consideration of the whole subject of the law of divoroe at large it would be a most important subject for our careful attention, and I think that the committee wiU do me the justice to remember that I stated that the princple of giving equal faility for divorce to the woman and the man was recognized, not only by the laws of France, but by laws anterior to the law of Prance. Was that disdaining the question or treating it with contempt? (Hear, hear.) It would, however, have been beyond my functions, and beyond what I had undertaken, to have entered into the consideration of that subject on the second reading of the Bill, because it did not come within ths scope of that principle which I was commissioned to invite the House to accede to. I think that the person who has charge of this Bill ought to be treated with some consideration, and it is not just to impute to me an insensibility with regard to the great question of giving equal facilties of divorce to the woman and the man. I am erfectly aware of the importanoe of that sabject, and is it at or right to taunt me with insnsibility or indifference with regard to it, because, having proposed to the House a limited field of inquiry, I decline to enter iato the consideratior. of other points not yet embodied in any existing rinciple of the law of divorce 1 this country ? I hope, therefore, that the committee will do mae the favour to distingupsh between any feeling whlch I might entertain if the whole subject of the law or marriage were being entered into, and what I feel it my duty to do when the inquiry is limited As it is at present, and to beheve that I am not actuated by any feeling of disdvin or contempt for a principle which I admit under other circumstances would be entitled to the utmost consideration. The duty which we have now, however, to discharge is a limited one. It is merely to emboody the law of divorce which at present exist, and I know of no private Bil ever having been granted which has embodied the princiOle which I am now blamed for refusing to discuss. If tis Bil were onoe thrown aside, and the whole law of mariage and divorce made the subiectof inquiry, then I should be the last mma to limit the field of discusson orto refuse to oonsider astate of law which infficts Ijustice upon the woman most wrongfully and without cause, and which may be considered oppobrious and wicked. (oud cheers and counter cheera.) N e are now, however, limited to the performance of that duty which this Bill imposes upon us-namely, to erect a new tribunal aud to embody the principles of law which already exist. As regards the question of equal facility of divoree being given to both sexes how is it that some hon. gentleman who, like the right hon. member for the University of Oxford, or the right hon. gentleman opposite, has been aware that injustice has been perpetrated year after year and century after certury has not bronght the subject under the consideration of the House ? The subject is one of the greatest importance and need not be the end-all of legislation upon the subject. (Loud cheers and ironical cheersm) By this Bill we shaU creato a tribunal which may hereafter have to administer other laws made under. happier auspioes I hope that some hon. gentlemen will In a folowing session perceive the inconsistency which has marked their conduct throughout this discussion. In what way do those hon. gentlemen think that they have presented themselves to the country? Do the, suppose that after having recorded on the minutes of this House theic intention of advocating in every way the rinciple of the indissolubility of marrriage they wiU be ned to with credit -when they come forward and move amendments which not only reoognize the principle of the dissolubility of marriage, but which propose to afford further facUities for obtaining divorces a vincudo malt-imnonii 7 Do they sup- pose that such proposalB as they bring forward will e| received by the people of England as coming from sincere advocates? (Hear, hear.) N9; such proposals cannot be sincere. An hon. gentleman caDnot be supposed to be sincere, nor wll the people of England look upon him as sinoere, who, after advocating the prin I I of in - solubility of marriage, brhis forward amedmeats based upon a diametrically opposite principle. (Hear, hear.) Mr. GIADSTONE.-If r, Sir, had been a mere spectator of this debate, and had heard the speech which the hon. and learned Attorney-General has just delivered upon an amendment to a clause of the Bill, and had notioed what a wide range he has taken both in general discussion and in personal attack (loud cries of "Hear, hear"), and if I had been ignorant of all that has taken place In this house with regard to this Bill, I should have thought that there was an intention to defeat the BiU bydelay, and that thatdesfgnwa3 nurtured by the Attorney-GeneraL (" Hear," and laughter.) The Attorney-General thinks himself entitled to charge members of this House in so m any words, not only with inconsistency, with which he has a perfect right to charge them, but with insincerity (hear, hear), in that they have brought forward and supported a proposition with respect to which, he says, they know well nobody can believe them to be sincere. Now, it appears to methat my hon. and learned frlendtheAttorney.Genercl himself,lf he has not crossedtha line, has trodden very close to the line, where it would hava been the duty of the right hon. gentleman who presides over the deliberatlons of the committee to interrupt hima3 a disorderly member of Parliament (laughter and cheers) who abuses the privilege of speech, for I say It is not usual with members of this House to chalenge the sincerity of an hon. member in reference to any proposition he may think it his duty to advance. (Cheers.) Now, if I had the intention of defeating this Bill my hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General has given me the best handle in the world for taking that coure. (Hear, hear.) After the charges, not of inconsistenoy only, but of insincerity also, which have proceeded from his mouth and from those eloquent eyes of his (laughter), which have been turned continuously on me for the last 10 minutes (renewed laughter), I should have been justified in entering on a personal defence of myself Bat I shall do no such thin. I give my hon, and learned friend all the benefit of al his Imputations of inconsistency and insincerity. Let them go for what they are worth. I will not occupy the time of the committee by replying to them. (Cheers.) Bat this I shall tell my hon. and learned friend, that those charges, multiply and reduplitate them as he may, will not stand between me and the performance of my duty, or go to absolve me from the obligation of canvassiug and criticizing a measure which has now, perhaps, more than ever assumed a position that renders it totally unfit to be submitted for discussion in this House. (Cheers.) What are the statements of my hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General himself, and of my hon. and learned friend the Lord-Advocate 7 Are those statements really compatible with the course which Her Majestys Government are pursning? Can it be justifiedI don't say out of the moaths of the opponents, but out of the mouths of the friends and champions, and out of the mouths of those who are responsible for the Bill. The LordAdvocate says I have misinterpreted the reports on the Scotch divorcee. On the contrary, I contend I have ana. lyzed them with the utmost care to the extent to which the information goes. I have appealed tohim for more information, but he has not had time to procure it, (Hear, hear.) But if you will refer to the 73d page of the Divorce Commission you will ace that the operation of the law of divorce in Scotland is in the main to make it a local law, and almost to oonfine it to Edinburgh and Leith and their immediate neighbourhood, and to some other great towns which are in easy communication with them. Bat that is a matter comparatively unimportant, except when we match it with other admissions made by my hon. and learned friend the Lord-Advocate. He has been fairly challenged as to the merits of the question now in issue, and what were the memorable words of the Lord-Advocate? I think he said that the law of Scotland, which gives perfect parity of divorce to a woman, was well founded both in principle and experience. (Hear, hear.) He used, I think, other pretty strocg words on the subject. He said he concurred ia the principle of the amendment of my hon. friend the mem'ber for west Surrey ; and these admissions have been followed by the admissions of my hon. andlearned friend t'he Attorney-GeneraL The Attorney-General distinguished between the advocates of the Bill nd5 .those who ad he harg ofit,an it appears from my bon. and learned friend, that thotsewhio havethe charge. of the Bail arenotth adocaesof t.

Why, thee,A is it not to bo admitted Into th'e Bil?

It would be far beer t'wait until we can with deliberation deal with a sauMet, ef this vast and immeasurable importnce tha now to . ceed with haste and precip incy to give our aUction to a measure with regard to which its own advocates make admissions more damning than ny es which san be brought by those who are opposed toit. (Chees) Lord PALEESTON sid,-M rigit lOio. friend wrho has just sat down hasaccued my hon. and leaned fden the Attorney-General of dealing severe taunts on those to whom he is opposed. The right hon. gentleman the memberfor the University of Oxford, with that great kindness whlh' distinguishes him, has dealt, as I thin, an undeserved taunt,' not on his opponents, but on other paxt of the House. The right hon. gentleman has accused my hon. and learned friend of being a hewer of wood and drawerof water. My hon. and leamned friend ha, Indeed, In the course of these debates cut most severely right and lt, but it was reserved for the right hon. genutleman thememnberfor the University of Oxford to describe the persons onv whom those cuts were inflicted as composed of thatmMela of which ho says my hon. Lnd learned friend is a hewaer. (Laughter.) Whether, as a drawer of water he hias drawnz tears of repentance from the eyes of those who have abandoned these opinions, it Is not for mse to say. This ament ment undoubtedly will be recommended to our adoption by the reflection that those who vote for it must have given or are giving a publio, formal, and deliberate reeantation (No, no !) of the principle which they hava hitherto maintained of the Indissolubiiily of marriage (No, noi), because the object and direct effec' of 'this amendment are to extend to a grater range the principle of disolubility, which the right hk. gentleman the member for the 'University of Oxford ant others have denied. We shall certinly bo dispoed tolook vith favour upon an amendment which drawsintoorcamp, from the adverse camp, -all thoee who have hithe'o opposed the fundamental pritcipleof thisBilL (Hear hear.) The right hon. gentleman opposite, and some w2vP bave taken part in thig debate, support this amendment upon the broad principle that with regard to divorco thert ought to be no differenoe between husbbad and 'wife. I cannot admit the extent of that principle, and I thlnk, without explaiing more particularly the grounds noreasonable man who looks to the constitution of society and the results of marriage can fail 'to me thalia, whatever may be the quality of the moral offence, the consequences of adultery are utterly different in th. case of the woman. (Hear, hear.) As far as regards the interests of society it is not true that the womn ought invariably to be placed on the same footing in this respect *a the man. (Hear, hear.) The Lord Advocate with tbat national feeling which I trust every Bootchman will alwayg cherish, and with that natural regard which is instiled intothe msind in early youth for the insitutions of his country, would have all distinctions between English and Scotch lawabolished by the extension to England of everything peolierly belonging to Scotlaud (a laugh), and that, I under. I stand,is the opinion of some of thoe who riton the other ddi of the House. Do they mean tosay thatthe lawof marriage is the same in the two countries? Do they mean to introduoe into this country the extremefacility of contractng marriage which has been brought to light in a recent trialIn, Scotland, and formed part of the defence of one of the par-- ties-namely, that the writing a letter to a woman by a. man, or by a woman to a mina, claiming the other as hus. band or wife, constitutes a marriage? They do not_ Therefore it is quite preposterous to argue this question upon the ground that because there Is a difference betweon the law of Scotland and the law of England that differenceo must be removed by adapting to England everything which. maybe foundm in the law of Scotland. Jf my Sootch friends will permit me to say it rithout offence, I woul&d rather attain imiarity in an opposite direction, by extending to Scotlnd the law of England, but. I am well content to leave the laws u they are, exoep-. upon matters where 'common interests require thaxt legislation should be uniform. The great objection to theamendment proposed by the noble lord is that it gives rise, to great onportunities and means of oollusdn between the' parties I think it is evident that it would very much asdist a busband and wife -who wished to get rid of each other' by legal process, and it is obvious how much lnore easy that process would be umder this amendment than under the Bill. as it now stands. One great argament of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford Is that. we ought to make this Bill as perfect as posgiblethat we ought to correct every evil which mayr exist in the law of marriage. That Is a etercotyped objection to every measure the opponents of which desire. to prevent its passing. It is an old, standard, set-up form, for the purpose of objecting to any improvement to say thatit does not carry out all the improvements of which the' matter in hand is susceptible, and if we admit that to be a, valid reason there is hardly any improvemert in the lwwhich ever can be made, because lt aLways eaiilbe said tatwe have not done everything which might b3 done. It is the same argument which for Years -has delayed the improvement of the Bcclesiasical Courte. When measures with that object were brought be. fore the House those who wished to perpetuate abues. said that they did not accomplish everything which It was3 desirable they should accomplish. (Hear, hear.) I do notgo so far as my hon. and learned friend the AttornaeyGeneral and others who have spoken in thinking that in reprh to the dissolubility of marriage we otighe to plae the wife on the same footing as the hustand in all and every respet,. but I admit there is some foroe in the argument which ha5 been alleged in favour of the 'rtibular condition of theamendment. I cannot blt dmit that th argument orthe right hon. gentleman ban sonic force that by the Bill as itstands marriage may liebroken by the wife for a less 'Viola- tion of berrights thsnthatwhich thlsaimendmentwrould con-, template; and;although'~ tbicbw'lith tthe Attorney.General, that it would be much better that- tEle sIoue sbould pas thu Bill, adopting int it tho lawf as it stands with triafing ernie..

LONDOBN, FPDAY, AUGUST 14, 1857. Inthe House of Lords last night, The Bishop of ST. DAVID's, on the motion that the Rouse resolve itself into committee on the Burial Acts Amendment Bill, took occasion to repel the attacks which had been made upon him in the matter of the Swansea cemetery. After considerable discussion the several clauses were agreed to, and the House resumed. The Earl of CLAnmmox, in reply to the Marquis of CLARICA}RDE, made a statement with regard to the position of affairs in the Danubian Principalities. Some other business was then despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned. The Houseof Commons, at the early sitting, went again into committee upon the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill, resuming the consideration of the important 25th clause, which enacts that a wife may petition for a dissolution of her marriage on the ground that her husband had been guilty of incestuous adultery, or bigamy, or adultery coupled with cruelty, or adultery coupled with desertion. Lord J. M.&Nns proposed to add another ground, " adultery committed in the conjugal residence " The ATTonNnY-GxmaI. opposed this amendment, because it made, he said, a change in the existing law, which it was the policy of the Bill to avoid. In a diecussion of considerable interest, the tone of whIch was occasionally warm, the amendment was supported by Mr. GLADSTONE, Mr. DRUMMOND, Mr. HuGESSEN, Mr. NAPn, and Mr. AYRTON. Mr. nzy urged the inconsistency of the ATToigy-GEny r's objection with the fact that the clause itself contained two causes of divorce at the suit of the wife which were altogether new. The Lon1ADvoa gave apparently a reluctasit opposition to the amendment, avowing his approval of the divorce law of Scotland, which recognized the principle that the rights of the two Fexes ought to be equaL The ArrosxEY-GENLsAj reasserted that the Bill embodied substantially the principle of the existing law, and said that to admit this new ground of divorce was beyond his limited function in taldng eharge of the -Bill. After some further debate, l£ord ALMrMISTON, remarking that the proposal to multiply,the grounds'of.divowce came with an iU graee from those whomaintained the indissolubility of 'mnriage and that the amendment would give ['rise t oport nitles'and means of colusion between j*aiiies,, c ,omhsen*d neverthieless, on the iart of the Goverfiment;.l,waivie objection to it. l.rd J.

Hxisnr objected tit th3is would 'fritter d'own the amendment, and render it wrholly li: opertive. The ATToRNrGzNxRlA thereupon withdrew i propositon, and the amendment as originll . moved was agreed to. Another wanm debate arose upon the term!n "bigamy," an offence which in the clausews di conneed from " adultery," but which was legpiy completed by the solemniation (or rather profan&x tion) of the ceremony of maniage alone. After several' abortive attempts to ameud the cause In this particular, The ArroRsNz-GmrAT, havlng made two un. succesful attempts, proposed to add to the word "bigamy " the words "tand adultery with the same person;" but to this amendment exceptions were taken, and 4 o'clock approaching, the Chairma= was ordered to report progres. The report of the Committee of Ways and ,Means was brought up and agreed to. In the evening, the House retarned into commnittee on the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill, and to the consideration of the proposedanZezidd. ment of the 25th clause. The ArowI.-GmunL now withdreaw hi amendment, or rather altered its terms, substituting the words " bigamy with adultery." Mr. GLADSTONn considered these words anblguots, and that it was uncertain what judicial constrution would be put upon them,-whether or not the two offences hlust be oommitted withl the smiie person. Nioe questions arose at every step of the enauing discussion; legal difficulties and embArrsNenn likely to result from the amendment were pointed out; itwas denied that the term "bigamy" had any legal meaning; and it wras asked wrhy other felonies besides bigamy, or theecontracting of a marriage during a. subsisting marriage, coupled with adultery, should not be a ground of divorce. Mfr. BurT moved to amend the amendment by appending the words "by feloniously intermarryhlg with any other woman." This proposal was negatived, and the ATIoRNKYGENin's amendment was agreed to. Certain other felonies were then added to the list: contained In the clause. Mr. WiGBaar moved to insert the words "being proved by conviction." The ATroNz y-GzNERA opposed this amendment, which was negatived upon a division by 103 to 68. MIr. DRumxoiD proposed to make cruelty alone a ground of the dimolution of mriae; but this propoisal was resisted both by Sir G. (lza and hir. tLADsToNm, because it would introduce a new principle into the Bill, and a new category of divorce. The motion was negatived. Mr. HzNiy moved the omision of the words desrtion without reasonable excuse," suggesting the difficulty of defining the term " desertion." The ATroFrav-GxxzEAL observed that where a husband ceased to live with his wife without the intpution of returnig he would have deserted her, and the Court would collect from the facts whether there was an animus deserendi. Conflicting interpretations were, however, put upon the term. The amendment was ultimately withdrawn. Mr. BuTr moved to include among the grounds entitling a wife to petition for a divoroe " adultery eoupled with aggravated iU-treatment of such a nature as ought in the opinion of the Court to entitle her to such divorce." The ArronN s-GmuxA opposed this3 amendment, observing that, if adopted, such general and indefinite terms would render the antecedent parts of the clause, upon which so much time and laoour had been bestowed, useless, and even worse than useless It should have been proposed at an earlier TUpon a division the amendment ws negatived by 137 to 4. Mr. Cox moved that the CisIsxw ?epOrI progress, and Mr. GAs'roNx seconded the motion. LordPA1ms=o.w said he congratulated the opponenta of the Bill upon their ingenuity in having expended 10 hours upon three lines of the clause. He should have resisted the motion for reporting progress if it were not out of consideration for the professional engagements of the ATroiuen-GzNx&An, whose preaenoe was required at ar early hour in the House of Lords; out of consideration for him, andi niot for his opponents, he asented to the motion. Mr. GLADsToNx complained that Lord PAx. STON had emancipated himlf from rules ordinarily incumbent upon members of that House in the observations he had made.

Some day the philosophy of railways will be better understood than it can be said to be now. Who made them T For what purpose ? On what theory or design 7 It is true that, like many of the marvels of nature, like granite ranges, coral reefs, sandbanks, and rivers, eccentric as they are, they are found very useful. But it requires as much of an argument to prove one of our great British railways a work of wisdom and beneficence as to prove the same of nature, which in one place does not give you a drop of water for five hundred miles, in another deafens you with cataract rushing to the sea, enough to slake ten milion thirsts, fertilize as many acres, and turn ten thousand Mils. We approach such subjects with reverence, and it behoves us to prostrate ourselves before the iuscrutable mystery of our British railways. For example, take the train on the Great Western in which you came up the other day--ay, 3lon-i day afternoon, a good day for tralfc, 4nd, asu it, happened, a fine one. As it rushed into -your station, a good deal behind time, how you wished that it and a dozen like it were now starting hourly or daily from Calcutta to Delhi! The wish is a pious one, for even Mr. BRIGHT has pronounned that the revolt must be suppressed. But there you saw a dozen or a score of carrlages,-t9he first-class capable of holding with comfort, or rather luxury, twenty-four passengers; the second-class capable of holding twice or thrice as m any. You have your choice of seats, for half-a-dozen compartments are quite empty, and the rest nearly so. The immense caravan flies through the air, and. lands you at Paddington, whete it disgorges its pauaengers. They form a little lapot on the platform, and you then see that one firht_ and one second class carriage could have Jrought the-whole batch. This is a pleasant tight for ali,s cbolder. a good, honeat;-borgnal shareholder; fthe ioritthy.

"1 The new Enies were mattets of neces tionty> For our part efearethod is, thosafersplea of the two, for, trie or not, at alr eve nse, it is not liable to nonfutation by the event. What do the cnbiarsd, undeluded public, thioe of the probability of the towenty miles ofo tnew hIae from Salisbury to Warminster turnoi ould pro fitable by supplying the neat little city of neisbury wite coal? What do they think of the fiftthree miles of new line from'Frome to Weymouta paying some day by the increased influx- of visitor3 to GEonun M.'s favourite watering-place? What wi rmake the nine miles from Bathampton to Bradford pay? As for the half-dozen little forks and branches, no doubt they are very oonvenient to the people of Uxbridge, Henley, and Melksham; but will the increae of traffic cover the interest on the capital sunk and the increased working expenaes?. Thatis the shareholder's question. The answergiven in the report is not encouraging. The number of miles opened in the firxt half of laat year was 366; the number opened in the first half of this year 457. This is an increase of somewhere about twenty-five per cent. The receipts of the twro periodcs, however, have only increased from 704,6501. to 768,9547., which is not ten ,per cent. But even this insuffieient increaae of receipts wholly disappears when the worling expenses are deducted. The net revenue for the two periods becomes respectively 422,5691. and 419,6181.; that is, the real revenue on the 457 miles is less than that on the 366. When the interest on the new capital expenditure is further dedacted, and the account msade out as fairly as the present s3tat of railway oonscience will allow, it results that the disposable balance for the dividend, which thu time last year was get down at 109,7321., is this year no more than 50,1971. It is evident, then, that the interest of the shareholder is not promoted by the rapid addition 0. hundreds of milea of new rail, through " agricl"tural districts," from coalpits to cathedral towns, to "rich beds of iron ore," and to every little bit of a town that does not take a 2C minutes' drive to the station. Every such branch and every such town contributes its carriages, be they ful or empty, which must be attached to the main train, and dragged all the way up to London and all the way down to Land's-end, Milford Haven, or Lancashire. When these accumulated trains exceed the powers of the locomotives, the activity of the company'e servants, or the capabilities of the gradients aud inclines, then it is neessay to have other trains for the greater distances, and we has the varieties of Parliamentary trains, stoppimg. trains, mail trains, fast trains, expres trains, and excursion trains, besides ordl-i nary luggage trains, coal trains, cattle traing,, and ballast trains. The amount of time.' kieeping, shunting, siding, stopping, and signallingrequired for the rUnning of so many different sorft of trains on one line of rails paases ordinar) belief, and even the extrordinary powers ot railway officials. There wil be accidents when sc many unwieldy trains are to be run with suce nicety within twenty-four hours; and there arf more accidents than the public are aware of Every now and then a huge train declines to bi dragged at mnore than a certain rate, or obstinatelv refuses to be ignominiously shelved into a sidin till an express train, has passed by, or rolls over ar ellbankument in a thunderstorm, as one did th( other day beyond Swans a.

At all events, tiprooess has gone far enough;. and, noa that. the Great Western dividend has sunk t 1 per cent., with some very respetable authoritic declaring that even that is paid eut of capital,: is probable that the company will Ub6 content i develope the traffic'of the- eting mage withof asking.for more.

The irrepressible buoyancy of the English revenue announced by the Crrawosp. of the ExonzQua on Wednesday may be regarded with feelings of unmixed ratisfaction. Prophets of evil, domestic as well as foreign,. will be puzzled by the ainouneement teat, while recruiting is proceeding with the utnost vigour, and although: a portion of the Militia is to be called out, the Government has not found it necessary to demand of the House of Commons any addition to the Ways and Means. One large payment for the redemption of the Sound Dues, which, to borrow the language of joint-stock companies, was properly " chargeable to capital," has been already paid out of the revenue of the year. Mr. GLrASTOIs, indeed, asserts that the discharge of the Danish claims was just as much effected by means of borrowed money as if a special loan had been raised for the purpose ; but the loan of 1856 had been already appropriated, among other purposes, to make good deficiencies in the current expenditure. The existence of a surplus which enabled the Government to defray a new and unexpected charge is exclusively attributable to the elsicity of the ordinary national income. The continuance for two years from next April of tie present duties on tea and sugar was a part of the original Budget introduced before the dissolution. Mr. G(1DsToN2s furious attack on the CR&xcRaon of the Excnrs=u is still fresh in the recollection of the flouse of Commons. It was alleged that the suspension of the fail in the dauties was, in fact,. an increase of taxation, and the Government was denounced as having taken the first retrogradstep since the time when Sir RoBTar PErL cormmenced his reductions of the indirect taxes. The same indignant orator stigmatized the breach of faith by which Parliament was about to violate its own promise to itelf in continuing the tax of 7d. in the pound on incomes. Finaly, his philippic wound up with an elaborate demonstration that the Budget was so constructed as to produce an inevitable deficit. Before the House could comprehend how it was asked for supplies at the same time excessive and insufficient the Chinese vote brought the Session to a close, and Sir Co sNvwAn Lawis satified constitutional propriety by contenting himself with a provisional scheme of finance. In continuing the duties for two years he once more recognizes the undoubted fact that the Russian War has initroduced an -navoidable inaccuracy into the calculations of 1853. A greater expendfture requires a larger revenue than that which was provided on the assumptign of uninterrupted peace. i The total revenue from tea and sugar exceeds 10,000,0001., and it is calculated that the vote of Wednesday last secures for two years an additional payment of 3,000,0001. Mr, GLADSTONE'S eloquent vindication of the claims of the poor has suggested an official inquiry into the comparative consumption by different classes of those luxuries which border most nearly on necessary comforts. It appears that in Great Britain the demand on the part of the upper and middle classes exceeds that of the poor in the ratio of 6 to 4. Mr. Doax&mui points out the fact that domestic servants are included in the clas to which theiremployers belong, and it may be added that the comparative consumption of the working classes would rapidly increase with a fall in the price of the commodity, Families in easy circumstances measure their consumption by their wants, but the labourer's wife must often stint herself of tea, or be content to dispense with sugar. It is more by prohibition than by actual taxation that heavy duties on articles of consumption affect the needier portion of the community. Direct taxes have been found in praetice obnoxious and unpopular, but those who have really an interest in protesting against them are the owners of property. The small tradesman and the operative ought to watch with far greater jealousy high tarifi of Excise or Customs. After inaugurating the Parliamentary year in the temper of a lion, Mr. GLADSTO.ro is content that it should go out like a lamb. He frankly owns that the opinion of the country on foreign policy is proved to be different from his own. A still higher degree of candour would have led to the conclusion that the difference was widest when his denanciations of the Government were loudest, and that there is, in fact, no question of foreign policy on which any present dissension can arise. There seems to be a certain fairness in the admiision I that it is wrong, when the country is dis"posed to recommend a policy involving great "expenditure, to interfere with the right hon. g gentleman,, who, as Minister of Finance, "wishes to make timely provision, so far as it "is in his power, for that expenditure ;" but neglected preachers, when they professedly despair of success, always cover their retreat by Parthian darts of ironical exaggeration. It is utterly untrue that the country desires an expensive policy, nor is Sir CONiEWAIL L2wIs making provision for. any expenditure except that which belongs to peace. The Estimates, notwithstanding the igmrative language of orators, are not war Estimates, and even now the Government abstains from any increase in its demands on account of the formidable crisis in India. Experience has more than confirmed the prudence of the determination to avoid excessive reduction in the military establishlnents; but tho dininution in the outlay applicable to warlike purposes for the present year amounts to twenty millions. The unavoidable cost of the struggle in India must be met at somb period, but there is a considerable advantage in postponing the payment till the danger is past. The regiments whieh lbve been sent to the East are no longer, chargeable to the Eng4Bsh revenue, and it consequently happens that the 'Imp~erial Treasury for the moment relieved? while ti~ In&dia, Tudget profits by the suspenionl of pay to thie axnutnou army; but no accidental advyantage- of. thisdknd, wienafIe w-. to snppozt wat.

We ae sorri7 to observe that, notwitbdAndyLg the endeavourg we have made to eofain and to recommaend the Bill now pending in the Houn* of Commons to check the sale df Obsc"e Bookrs i*ud Prints; its object is misunderstood oI wrantonlyznurepresented by its opponents. The objebt of it ¢leiY is, not puritanically to interfere with. naked statues or with any books, ancient or modern, to befoizd. in any public or private library, altholzgh th.ey may.. contain. passages, or whole poems or plays, o. a lic-entious description, but, if possible, to puf an end to.the traffic in those infamoui, £ithy,rand. corripting publications which outrage deency and are equally revolting to taste and to morals. By the common law of England- the sale of stch publications was a nisdemeanour, subjecting tne offender to imprisonment and the pillory. The pillory is now aboliihCd, ;aid.the proceeding by indictrent has beeii found quite inadequate to meet the evril. On convictioni the - defendant goes to gaol, .but the trade is carried on at his shop -it incr briskness from the notoriety he has acquired, and the law is set at defiance. There is 's-street near St. Clement's Church, in the Strand, consisting almost entirely, of warehouses in. which thoee, abominable coinnod,ities are Atpred for circulation over the metropolis and over the whole, kingdom. The trade is rapidly increasing, for It is z3i3ost profitable, and the only peril which.those engaed' 'in it at preseut incur is, that a spy may be employed by the Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy of an obscene book or print which they hare on sale, and that, if he is believed by a jury, they may suffer some months' imprisonment, knowing that their stock in trade is secure, and that they will soon be able by increased caution to contimue the business with impunity. The sale of obscene books and prints is now carried on to a greater extent in London than in Paris or any other capital in Europe. On the continent the police have the power of summarily seiydng all such books and prints, wherever they are exposed for sale or concealed by the vendors. Such a course is ineonsistent with our notions, which require that in every instance the power of interfering with domicile or property shall be strictly defined by law; but, consistently with the precedets already to be found in our statutes with respect' to betting-. houses, smuggled goods, and unlicensed printing presses, it is proposed that, on proof laid before a magistrate that these obscene commodities ar~ kept in any house for sale, he shall be authorized Ao grant a warrant to eize them and to order them to be destroyed, with a right to the owner to appeal if he disputes the justice of the decision. Thus we get an effectual remedy, without 4anger to the liberty of the subject. But,. says Mr. Ro=uox,. this proceeding will be abused by a country justice to get rid of a poacher! A Squire WEsTErzN would thus punish a GronoG SEAGRm I for wiring a hare ! Mr. Rounucx goes still further, and seems to think that the law ought not to interfere on such a subject, and that there ought to be as free trade in obscenity s in corar If he succeeds, a statuc will be erected to him in Holywell. street. Other members, less excited, make a diculty about what shall be considered "Sobscef.ie." But the Bill is expreasly confined to books and prints the sale of which would subject the vendor to an indictment for a misdemeamour, and to cae where an indictment for a misdemeanour would be fit and expedient, if a sale could be proved. This objection, if well founded, would put an end for ever after to all prosecutions for oling obscene books a,nd prints, and would eiffectua establish the doctrine that an obscene exposure of the person in a public place could not be visi with punishment. We trust, however, that LordCArBn.'s Bi, with the proposed amendmeits, will be approved by a large majority of the House of Commons, and we are confident that it will powerfully tend to the purification of public morala.

SEOOND EDITION. T TIMR&0FICffE1, Flid" M0minbq INDIA AND CHINA. We have received, in anticipation of the Overland Mail, files of papers from Bombay to the 14th of July; from Calcu.tta to the 4th of July; and our private correspondence from Hongkong to the 24th of June. INDIA. (From the Bombay Times of the 14th July.) in the last fortnight we have probably passed "the flood" of the insurrection, and may now hope that our future advices will be ohiefly occupied with a recital of the subsidence of this great rebellion,and the restoration of order in the disturbed provinces. The buth Is that there are no more Tegiments to mutiny, unless they are to be those of Bombay and Ms,drar, concernig the fidelity of which there s no; the slightest groundof suspicion. Delhihad not fallen up to the 27th June, the date of our latest advices, vid LIahore. There has been a good deal oflfighting outside the walls, the rebels being defeated on every occasion with great daughter, and it is matter of much congratulation that the apparent hopelessness of their cause has effeotually oheeked the disposition of the mntineers at other stations to proceed to their assIstance. The only attempt which has been mado to reinforme them seems to have been on the part of the Nusseerabad mutineers, who were cat up dreadfuly on the occasion by General Barnard's force. Whether any of them got inside the walls or not we cannot say. Duringthe fortnight just elapsed we have received Ilntelligence of the mutiny of the troops at Moradabad, Fyzabad, Seetapore, Saugor, Nowgong, Banda, Futtehghur, Mhow, and Indore, and we proeeed briefly to relate the particulars of each in so far as they are known to us. It is now evident that an arrangement existed between the troops at Bareilly, Shahjehanpore, Lucknow, and Moradabad to effect a simultaneous rising. A glance at the map will show the proximity of these stations to each other, and the outbreak occurred at each on the morning oI the same day. The mutiny at Bareilly, which we reported in a few words in our last issue, seems to have been attended with eircumstances of peculiar atrocity and treachery. Only the day before their outbreak the Sepoys appealed to thelr officers to recall their wives and familiec from the hills, where they had been aent for safety, and even toWthe last moment thse miscreants swore to protect their officers to the death. The regiments iose en -masse on Sunday morning, the 1st of Juae, a shotted gun being fired Si the signal about 11 o'clock. Themen at once rushed upon the officers' lines, and opened a fusillade upon the bungalows. Such officers as were able immediately got on their horses, and made for the rendezvous previouslyagreed upon among them-the cavalry parade ground, An iaeffectual effort was made to bring back the troops to their allegiance, but the scoundrels opened upon them with grapeshot, and they had to ride for their lives. The country having riseln in all directions, it was with extreme difficulty, and only by a rlde of 70 miles, that the little band at last found safety at Nynee Tal, in the hills, where they had previously sent their families. H:ere the refugees are congregrated in numbers which will probably awe any attempt to attack them, and, as the place is of very difricult approach, we may hope they are in safety. At Moradabad the desire of plunder seems to have prevailed over the murderous propensities of these miscreants, and they gave their officers two hours' grace to malke their escape, in which they fortunately succeeded, the whole of the offieers (29th Regiment) and the rsidents, with their families, escaping to Nynee Tal the day after the arrival of the Bareilly refugees. We stated in our last advieez that great fear was entertained that the whole of the station of Shabjehan. pore had been massacred. We are happy, however, to learn that a good many have escaped, but we are umable as yet to give the particulars. The rising at Fyzabad occurred on the night of Sunday, the 8th ult., the 6th Regiment Oude Irregular Infantry giving the signal, which was imsediately answered by the 22d Regiment Native infantry. They at once took possession of the battery, and would not allow the officers to ap. proach, but do not seem to have offered them any further violence. Fyzabad is in the very heart of Oude, and is situate npon a branch of the Ganges. The office determined to endeavour to escape by boat, and were allowed quietly to embark. What followed is thus related by one of the party:- " I remember the officers in the two boats; I accompanied Lieutenant Bright, 22d Native Infantry; Lieutenant Parsons, 6th Oade Irngulars; Lieutenant Cautley, 22d Native Infantry. Sergeant Busher, Sergeant-Major, QuartermasterSergeant, 22d Native Inhsntry, and myself were in one boat Colonel Goldney, Lieutenant Currio, Artillery, Lieutenant Ritohie, 22d Native Infantry, Sergeant IEd& wards, and Sergeant-Major Matthews in the second boat; three otherlboats followed behind. We waited two hours for them, but as they did not come we pushed off. As we were getting into the boat we saw the Sepoys of the 22d rushing towards the Treasury; there were about 2 lakhs and 40,000 rupees In Captain Drummond's house (where the treasure bad boen placed. On reaching a place called Begumgutge, about 10 miles below Fyzabad, we met some mutineers encamped; at half-past 1 these men fired on us; there were 800 or 900 of them; about 100 men fired on us whe. we were 600 yards off. Colonel Gold0ey advised our pushing off to the opposite bank of the Gogra; we got on an island among some jhowfields. The mutineers got into dinghees and followed us; wo made for the main boat from the island; there we e about 40 or 50 yards of water between. Major Mills was drowned. The Sergeant-Major, Lieutenant Bright, and I wero taken prisoners, and taken to the camnp of the matineers, who were men of the 17th and 37th Native Infantry, and the 17th Irregular Cavalry. We were taken before the Soubahdar commanding the rebels. I don't know his aame; he was a Hindoo, and belonged to the 17th Nattve Infantry. He was an old man, slightly made, about 5 feet S inches high, with gray hair, no hair on his face, and dark complexion. He asked us who we were; we replied. He then appealed to the Mussulmans on the Koran, and to the Hindoos on the cow, not to injure us, and told us to go away. Two men of the 17th thenasteppedaout and 4hott'he Sergeant-Major and Lieutenant Bright. I was rescued by an artlleryman, and was hid in a Serai .t Begamgunge, and sent off in disgaise. While we were talking to the Soubabhdar some 16 or 16of the%rxegujar Cavalry, and 10 or 12 Sepoys, went after the remainder of our party. We heard firing acros the river; theoparty returned, and reported they had killed Colonel Goldaey and ax other officers, and that three had escapod. ion arriving at Tanda, on the 10th instant, I heard people in the Serai saying that six or seven ofaicer, had been killed, and two or three were sheltered by some zemindar in Goruckporo disttict. After this I came mii4 Mattoopoer, Shahgunge, and Juanpore. Captain Reed, Deput-Com. missary; Captain A. P. Orr. Assist-t-Commlsary Mr. E. O. Bradford, ditto; ad Captain Thurnburn, reached ajakh Mann Sing's house, and he promised shelter and pro. tetion. When I was at Mattoopore I heard that the above offacers were going down in boats, with their families, escorted by some of the Riajah's guard. At Tanda I heard that a Mr. Fitzgerald, clerk in the Deputy Commisioner's ofioe, and Overseer Sergeant Hurst, who were escortlng the fasmera of some sergeants to Allahabad, vi Sultanpore, were killed, and the women and children also murdered. I do not know what has become of the offlicers who were in the boas behind us when we left Pyzabad." We have reason to believe, however, that a considerable number of the officers have effected their escApe from this xtation, and, whiatever May hva taken place after leaving it, the conduct of the $epoys st the timee s to l1SVe been ohuacterea by the atangeet moderation. W cannot redst the temptation of quotingfron a letter on the subject:- "I Te account of the mutiny of the 22d peglment bI,x any romAnce; they guarded their officr and their bungalows aft, mutin* g, plced sant1 OYer Iiagazines and all public property, sent out pickets to prevent tho tA*wntpeope -ad servihtS from lo6tng, held a council of'war, In which the CAVAry (Fshears Iegular) proposed to idll the officers, but th6 22d objeoted, and Informed the offioes th&t they would hb allowed to leave, and mlght take with them their private arms and property, but no publio property, as that all belonged t the King of Oude. Their office xsked for boats: the rebel Com0iacary-General, a Resaldar, Wa order&d to provide them. He did so, but merely small dingies, so that they could only bring away a bundle ech, and then they were presented with 900rs, which the rebWs had takeu from the treasure cheat to give them. When the officers Ltied to recall them to their duty, they respcf ly asured them that they Vwere now under the orders of their native officers, and that the Soubah0darajor of the 22d Regiment bad been appointed to the command o the ation, and that each corps bad appointed one of its ofaoers to be their hief." We are as yet without particulars of the mutiny at Saugor, the news of which reached us on the 8th instant from our correspondent at lKamptee, who was able, however, to informn us that no atrocities had as yet been committed, all the officers and families, with the European Artlllery, having taken refuge in the fort. Saugor is the chief sttion in the districts known as the Saugor and Nerbudda territories, and must have a considerable European population in the shape of writers, oonductor;, and others, concerning whose safety, after what hs transpired at Jhans, in thee usme territories, muoh uneasiness must be felt. It is to be hoped that these men and their families have taken refuge in the fort also. Concerning the mutiny at Noowgong,. we simply know the fact that the head-quaZtera of the 12th Native Infantry and of the 14th Irregular Cavalry stationed there have followed the example of the left wing of each, corps whieh was sationed at Jhansi, but that the officers are safe. The news of the Jhanai mutiny we communicated by last mail, 'with an account of the bloody tragedy enacted on that occaion by the massacre of all the Europeans in the place. We now lear that, besides, Mrs Skene and family, Mr Browne, Miss Browne, and Miss Davidson were killed. Altogether 12 of our country men and women were slaughtered in this small station. The only persons known to have escaped are two Customs' officers, who have reached Agra. The only particulars we have of the mutiny at Banda are contained In a letter from Nagode, dated June 19, of which the following is an extract :- "We have caped from Banda to Nagode, and, through God's mercy, have been miraculously preserved. On Sun. day, the 14th, the Nawab's troops mutinied, as well as the Native Infantry. The Mahomedans planted their flag and wanted tokill us, but the Nawab stood by us, and we got into buggies and on horses and got off. The place was En a lae before we had gota mile: it WAs a fearfl scene. We start again to-night for Mirzapore,and hope to reach it sfely, but this district is very much disturbed. We have in our party Mr. a-d Mrs. Edmonstone, Mr. and Ms. Webster, Messrs. Mayne, Sherer, Ciark, Bows, Couins, Hutchinson, Oswin, and GIn We are staying with Major and Mrs. Ellis, at Nagode. Their kindne3s is extreme, and we have rested two days." Of the whole country of iRohilcund, Futtehghur (Furruckabad) was the last station to rise. The 10th Regiment has unquestionably given in simply to the force of the dangerous example all around it. TheSepoys of this corps Continued for weeks to guard the treasury and maintain dlipline, while every station near them was in open mutiny. They do not appear to have ofered any violence whatever to their officers, but a most melancholy rumour prevailed iu Allahabad on the 234 int. as to the fate of the unhappy fugitives after they left the place. We take it from the Bngs1mwn of the 29th ult.:- "Did the report of the mawsae reach you of the Futtehghur fugitives ? It surpased in atrocity cI thsat hs hitherto been petrated. 132 ]u&'opeams, n'su, women, and chidren, in 60 boats left Fuatehghu for this place. " They were all the non.m}litary residents of the place. On arrival at Bhitoor the Nana Sahib fired on them with the atllery the Government allowed him to keep; one round shot struck poor M-r--, and killed her on the spot. The boats were then borded and the i rnm i.,a.a a dragged to X prdc grouna at Cawnpbre, whera they wsre first fired at and then literally hacked to pieces with tulwars. Report says not one escapod." B1hitoor is a little placo a few miles to the north of Cawnpore, and we Eadly presage a confirmation of this intelligence, in view of the state of matters in that neighbourhood. A bloody reckoning will surely be exacted of thege fiends in human shape. At Mhow the 23d Bengal Native Infantry have mIut!nied ; the number of Europeens sain is at present unknown, but it is sald to be four. The officers are holding a fortified square in the place, where the ladies and all the other Europeanm have taken refuge. If the 3d Nizam's Cavalry prove staunch, they will soon be relieved, as Captain Orr was within 50 miles of Mhow some days ago. We know little of the state of matters at Indore, beyond the fact that the two regiments of the Maharajah Holkar have openly mutinied and proceeded with the Bengal Regiments towards Oojein, on their way, as is supposed, to Delhi. The Maharajah seems to be in no way implicated in this business, but to have acted with the same good faith that has characterized the conduct of the Gwalior Prince. We have now again arrived at the close of a long and tragic story. We can, of course, understand well the intense excitement this intelligence will produce at home, and we pass on without comment to notice the state of matters before Delhi, and the progress of the siege. The force at General Barnard's disposal has doubtless been inadequate for the reduction of the place, but as important reinforcements must have joined his camp long before this, we entertain a confident hope that our next advices will announce the faU of the place. Meantime, the force has not been idle. inimated by the courage of despair, the mutineers have made the most desperate sorties, but ever with the same result. They have been driven back into the citY with terrible loss on every occasion, to find eventually, as we trust, their tomb within its walls. Our columns contain ample details of these several actions, and to attempt to summarize them here would swell our epitome to an inconvenient length. General Van Cortlandt, who is marchming upon Jhansi and Hissar with the Buttianah Irregular Force, has had two engagements with the rebels in the neighbourhood of Sirsa, defeating them in each instance with severe lows. The last action was a very declded one) and the rebels fled in disorder, leaving 200 men dead upon the field, besides many prisoners in our hands. Thne troops of the Bikanir Bajab, 2,700 men of all arms, have joined General Cortlandts force, though what relianee can be placed on these men remains to be seen. MajorGeneral Nicholson's moveable column was at Jualundur at the date of our last advices, vi4 Lahore. The whole Punjab remais quiet, thanks to the energetic eonduct of the Commissioner' and the men in command. Many of the disarmed native regiments have begged the retittion of their weapons, and to be led against Delhi, but it would be madness, after what has transpired, to listen to such prayers. The men nwy be loyal in their present mood, but, In the presence of an example such as that offered now at Delhi, would yield to the dangerous influence to a certainty. To overawe the Mewar territory, and keep the Gwalior contingent in check, a coniderable force Is on the march from Deesa, and must now be in ad. vance of Nusseerabad. It consit as follows 3 Horse Artillery gunm (European). 500 men Her Majety's 83d Regiment of Foot. 400 men 12th Regiment Bomay Native Infantry. Two squadrons 2d Bombay lIght CavaRy. To quell the mutiny which Is now general aong the valley of the Nerbudda, from Mhowto Bundel. kund, a light field brigade has been ordered to as< semble immediately at MaU3gaum, under the co5na. mand of Colqne!

C.,Mr. Bovlll, QC.. and Mr. Hawkins Were cotunsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeaut Sheo and Ar. Watkins Williams for the defendant. The actiok was brought npon the warranty of two horses, purchased of the defendant, as being quiet in harness end sound, and the declaration alleged that one of hhe horses was unsound, and that they were not quiet in The plalntiff, It appeared, was a patent agent and civil engineer, and the defendant is a horsedealer at Twickenhm. The horses in question were purchased by the plaintiff for 1101., and they were warranted sound and quiet in-harnesg. The plaintiff put them into his phaeton, and was driving down Sichmond-hill, accompanied by his wife, his brother, who is in the navy, and a servanit, and vhl&e going dovn the hill one of the horses commenced kicking, and they both eventually bolted, ran the carriage into the ditch and overturned it, and the wife of the plaintiff reelved very severe injuries. Theze facts were proved so far as the accident was concerned, and a num'ber of veterinary surgeons were examined, whose evidence went to show tba7 cof othe horses had Epavins, and was consequently unsound. For the defenudvat several profesaional men were also examined as witnesses, with a view to show that the horse in question was sound; and with regard to the wakrrty of uetness, it-svas alleged ti6at the accident had 3aisen solely t cugh the unskilfJne of the driver, and the horses being put into a vehicle not at all adapted to them.

OXFORD CIRCUM. GLOCESTER, AuG. 13. 'IVIL UOOURT.-(Befo f Mr. Baron MARiTIN, ana Q; City .tury.) RDIqT V. T}IZ GRET C N STERI IAMWAY COMPANY Mr. Gray and Mr. 3t'Mahon appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. H uddleston, Q.C., and Mdr. Powell for tho defendAnts, This was an action on the case for not carrying and de. livering wheat belonging to the plaintiff from Gloester to Stonehouse, and also in troverfor converting the s-me wheat to the defendants own use, to which theypleaded a payment of 44 10s into court and no damages ultra, whereon issue was joined. It appeared that the plaintiff on the 28th of Februay lat bo t ht Obuhels of wheat of Messrs. Sturge, of ts city, end 40 bushels of Messrs. Robinson, for the several sums of 291. and 171., and obtained the usual credit of a fortnight and recelved delivery notes, by which on the 2d of March he obtained possesion of the wheat, and cent it to the defendants' station at thbis place, and invoiced it for conveyance to Stonehouse for the purpose of being ground into flour. The vendors, however, not being satisfied with the solvency of the plaintiff, gave an indemnity to the defendants, and thereby obtained back possession of the wheat. The plaintiff, at the expiration of the fortnight's credit, paid the price of the wheat, and thereunpon the wheat was forwarded by the defendants, who had got it back from the vendors, to its original destination at Stonebouse, but the miUer there by the plaintiff's direction, refused to take it in. On the 19th of March the defendants' traffic manager -rote to the plain. til saying that the -wheat lay at the Stonehouse sttion at his rin but the plaintiff still refused to take It, On the Jth of Aptrl the writ was issued. On the 18th the declaration was delivered. On the 25th the defendants pleaded the payment of the 41. 10s. into court, and on thne 2d of May the parties were at issue. Subsequently in that month the plaintiff agreed to take back the v,heat on an express understnding bythedefeedants' tmfiac manager that his doing so shold in no wise compromise his rights in the action. Proof of these facts was given, and that the plintif on igetting back the wheat, ssld it at a loss The defendants' counsel contended that, as the wheat had been tendered back on the 19th of WAsch and aepted back on the 13th of May, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any damagee but for the detention or conversion, and that the money paid into court covered these, but his Lordship ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the full value of the corn at the time of the conversion, besides damages for the deteation and conversion, though execu tion should issue only for the latter ; and the jury accord. ingly, after hearing counsel on both sides, found a verdict for the plaintiff for the full value of the corn and the full damages proved; but it wasarranged between the parties that execation shoald issue only for the spec damages recovered. (Befo-e a SpeciaZ Jury.) HADDOCK Ah'D AlOTHER V. LEWIS AND AIrOTEns Mr. Serjeant Pigott, Mr. Dowdeswell, Mr. Cook Evans, and Mr. H. James appeared for the plaintiffs; and Mr. Whateley, Q.C., Mfr. Skinner, Q.C., Mr. W. EH Cooke,and Mr. Powell for the defendants. This was an action of ejectment brought to try the vlidity of a will made on the 14th of April, 1855, by Mrs. Anne Higgins, an old lady who died at a place called " Shepherds," about four miles from Newnbam, on the 13th of May, 185f5, at the advanced age of SO. Condiderable Interest attached to the inquiry, arising from the clroam. stance that the willin question was made by Mr. Smith, the solicitor of Newnham, and that one moiety oI the property, after paying certain legacies, was left tos Ms. Elliott, an old lady of 66, who was Mr. Smith's mother-in-law. The other moiety was left to Sarah Lewis, who was the testtor's first couin. The plaintiff claimed as heir-at-law and the defendants as devisees. When the case wa called on, Mr. WAT&r.y, who appeared for the defendants, the devisee, said he admitted the plaintiff was heir-at-law, and climed the Sight to begin, by proving the execution of the wiLl. Mr. Serjeant PIGOTT said he could not resist that application. Mr. WsuATY then stated the facts of the case to the jury, and called several witnesse" to prove the due execution of the will, which was dated the 14th of April, 1855, and -was proved in Doctors'-commons on the 16th of June following. The testatrix devised all the estates vested in her upon trut or by way of mortgage to John Taylor, of Griers. hill, in the pariah of Lydney, farmer, and appointed him execator. She gave 2001. to Mary Lewis, then staying with her; 501. to Mary Kear, then living with her; 1004 to Alfred Meredith, then living with her. To Henry Awre, innkeeper, she gave 5001., being the amount of mortgage money due to her upon his farm. As to the residue of her propery, real and personal, she devisd and bequeathed the eamne to the said Sarah Lewis and Marg aet Jane Elott, of Newnham, widow, as tenants in common, subject to the payment of her debts and personal and testamentary expenses. The will pu rted to be signed by the tegtatrix, " Anne Higgins,"on the 14th of April, 1855, and was witenessed by "Edwacd Robinson, Awre-MI11," and "George Parsons." Edward Robinson, one of the attesting witnesses, was examined by Mr. SxNrN-He said he was a miller, residing in the parish of Awre, and had been acquainted with Mr. and Mrs OHiggins for 18 or 20 years. Mr. Higgins died on the 30th of March, 1855, and Mrs. Higgins on the 13th of May following. He said that one morning, but he could not fix the date, Alfred Meredith came to him at about 8 o'clock and fetched him to Mrs. Higgins's house. He went into Mrs. Higins's bedroom with Meredith, and found Mr. Smith, the solmcitor, of Neawnham, there. Mr. Smith told Meredith to go down and mind the horse, and to tell Parsons, the driver of the carriage, to come up. When Meredith went downstairs r. Smith said2 "Robinson, we want ;ou to witness Mrs. Higgins's will." Mrs. Higgins was olstered in bed, and Mr. Smith was on ono side, vhile RoM L= on wa on the other. Mr. Smith put a paper on a hook before her. Parsons camne up, and Mr. Smith told Robinison to bold the paper steady, which he did. He saw Mrs. Higgins sign the papr. Mr. nuth.then put the paper oa a chest of drawers, and Robion signed s naJame as witness, and Parsons did, the same. He then saw Mr. Smith give MSrs. Higgins a paper and heard him say that if she wanted to make any alteraiaoA he would call another day. On cross-exmination by Mr. Serjeant PsoaoT the witnesssaid, he could not say whether Parsons was in the room when Mrs. ggin pther name, ae he was behind the eoor, which was open. Tbe old lady did not sneak while he was in the room, but made a moaning noise. Mr. Smith did not speak to her. She shook very much, and could not sign until witness went to hold the book. After sho had signed Mr. Smith took the en and touched it up, and emlied at witness, and said, " I must not do too much to iLt" The witness said Ms. Eliggins had known him before very well, bul she did not reoognize him. She appeared to be In a very helple3s ste, and he said he thought she had left it too long, and said so the same morning to Mr. Harrison, her medical man, whom he met asho wu aosng home. LHe believed he said, " She (Mr Higgins) did not know much about will-making." Mr. Hooper, who lived about the ame distance, was a more intimate friend of Mrs. Higgins than he (witnes) was. This took place on a Saturday morning, about a fortnight after Mr. Higgins's burial (April 7). Wltness was a debtor to the estate to the amount of ml George Parsons, the other attesting witness, wu examined by Mr. COOE3; and said he was servant to Mr. Carter. Wu Wohtboy, u 1855, to Mr.Cwirns, and recollected driving Mr. SmfUl ft to rs. sHigins's, at the Shepherd's. A flw minute after Mr. Smith went In Meredith came out, aM in a little time returned with Mr. Robino, They went into the house, and soon after Meredith came out, and gave p witne a mase. Meredith stayed to ma the horse while witzims went up to Mxs. Hgitnes room, Mr. Smith and Mr. Roblnson were there. Smith said, " We want you to put your name to this Zper, or wiA." A book was placed on the bed befors- Mrs. -oIis,-n l-per.put os it, which Mr Higgns sgned. Mr. Smith held one corner of the paper and ir. Robinson the other. 3M. Higgin was propped up In bed. Witness signed after Mr. Robinson. It was then on a dresslng.table. Mr.. Robinson signed on a chest of drawers. Mr. Smith folded up the paper and gave it mrs. Higgins, and witness left'the room and Mr. Robinson fol. lowed directly. Witness said he sad driven Mr. Osborne, Mr. Smith's clerk, over from Newnham the evening before, and he had told him to hold himself in readiness to bring Mr. Smith over the next morning. About four days after he witnessed the will witness drove Dr. Evans, a phy. sician of Glocester, over from Newnham to Mr. Higgintsa. On eross-examinatlon b;7 Mtr. Serjeant PIGoTT the witnees sald,- Mrs. Higgins did not speak while he was In the room. She wa pro ped np in bed. There was no woman in the room. Mrs. LewAs (one of the defendants) was down stairs, but ho did not see Mrs. Kear. Mr. Smith put the pen Into her hand. She was moaning all the tame. He did not remember that Mr. Smith spoke to her before it was signed. After it was signed Mr. Smith said some of the letters were not exactly joined; bht whether he joined them, or held Mrs. Higgins's hand, he did not recollet. The old lady appeared to be in a very weak state. The whole affair took 10 miinutes. She said nothing during that time. John Osborne, on being examined by Mr. PowaLr, said he was clerk to Mr. Smith, a solicitor at Newnham. On the 13th of April. 1855, Mr. Awre came to IMr. Smith's office, and brought a mesage from lrs. Higgin. Inconsequenosof thatmessage, witness wentthat evening to Mrs. Higgins's house. Was driven by George Parwons. Mr. Awre was there. Went into Mr Higgins's room, and shook hands with her, and asked her how ahe was. She said she was better. I said M-. Smith was not at home, or he would have come himself. There was a pause for a short time, and I repeated what I had said. I then asked her if she wished me to do amything, and told her I had pens and paper. I had taken them, in consequence of the message. She did not say anything to this then. In consequence I said I understood she wanted Mr. Smith to make her wvill She said she did, but she would wait till Mr. Smith could Icome, and I was to tell him to come next morning. I said he wss gone to Bristol to-day, but what appointments he wouldmake I could iot tell; he might be out. She would not allow metodo it. I l8d, "Yourwillwillbeneeessarily long; you have a good deal of money to leave, and if you wi tell me to put it down how you meau to leave It it will enable you, if you leave anybody out, to put them in; md if you leave one too much and another too little to put it satisfactorily. After I am gone the women can read it over toe yoa- it will be instrcons to Mr. Smith, and will very mucL facilitate his doing It, maldng the wilL." She said it would not take Mr. Sith imorethan 10 mlniutesto make her will, because there were only tbrcc or four persons to benefit by her property She told me to tell Mr. Smith to come down, as nobody but he should dolt. I went bome and told hir. Smith. Hewas gone to bed, and I called him. I gave Parsons Instructions to be ready to go the next day.

Mr. and Mrs. Higgins kept no servant, and when they were ill Mr Lewis and Mrs Kear were sent for. They both lived in the house. I had been at Mrs. Biggins before the 13th of ApriL I had no business there. I called on my way to Blakeney. Mrs. iggin was dreseed and down stairs then. I was at Awre's also on the 24th of April nd aRan on the 26th of ApriL About a week after Mm. iligginss death I saw her will on Mr. Smith's desk. This witness was strictly cross-exmined to show that Mrs. Lewis had used to him words to this effet-" We must not let her (Mrs. Higs) know that we have ent for you," wad that he rp7lded by saying that "he would toll ehea go to Bikene on business." Weunderstood the witness at fist to admit that those 'words might have been used, but he subsequently distin;ctly denied tbat anything of the sort had passed. He said Mr. Smith had told bian to call upon Mrs. Higginl and ask how she Was aS he was going to Blakenoy. He denied having raid that if he could get Mrs. Higgins to sign a memorandum he should do well enough. He also said he had been coneArned for Mrs. ear in a Chancery suit, but he didNnot know whether she had signed her name, or only made her mark. On re-examination b Mr. W T , the d ritne said the only conversation he had with the wromen was that they wanted to come into Ms. Higgnes's room with m, ade he told the they might leave the door open and liten outsde, but they must not come into the room.

I was wth herfor an hour. She was then downstairs In the kitchen. The neIt time I saw her was on the morning of he 14th of Ahpr4i I got there about 7 o'clock. That was in consequence of the communnication made to me by my clark, Osborne, the night bfdore, b8he wa n o bed. I went up into her room. I shook hands with her and asked her how ehe was. She said she was very poorly. I asked her if she wished me then to make her wlrl. She said she did, Ilacked If it wouldbe a long will or a short one. She said it would oe a short one. I odher Mr. Taylor had consented to act under her will, and therefore I would et. once head the will. I sat down and wrote that part of the will which gives the mortgage and trot estates to Mr. Taylor. I read it over and explained that that was suaL I then aked her to instruct me as to her property. She said she should lIave Mrs Lewis a little ready money and would remember Mr1 ear, Alfred Meredith, and Mr. Awre. She said she would give Sarah Lewis 2001.; MR A ear, 504.; and Alfred Meredith, 100.;. and Benry Awre, 5001.; " But (she said) please to say that is the mortgage I have on his farm.'

I said, " Well, ma'am, if that is your determination, so let it be," and I finished the wll. I read the will over to her, and she said, " Yes, that will do." I said, "Now, ma'am, will you allow me to cal your cousin ua and explain what you have been doing for Elott?" She sid, "Yes, but you need not tell her everything." I called her (Mr Lewis) up, and said to her, "MrsLewis, Mrs. Higgins has remembered all Awre; but what I wish more ac. u is. that she has been particularl kdnd to my wifs mother." I said tomr Hiiggins, " Wil You be kind enough, Mla'am, to inform Mrs. Lewis if that be so I?' She answvered, "Yes."

I should say she was a clever, intligent, aotive woman. Sho had A local complaint. She was peculiar in manner, and might be called rather an oddity. She was remarkably inteligen She lived 16 miles from Glocester. She -had consulted me at Glocester. In Apri last I went to her house, and I met Mr. Harrison there on the 18th of April, 1855. Mr. Smith met ms at the Newnham Station. She Was propped up in bed. Shte -wa suffereng, in addition to the local aecton, from bronchitis. She was propped up to assit the breathing. She was very feeble. There was nothing inher mind to lead me to doubt that abe was In the entire possession of her faculties. I took pains to ascertain whether she was clea about her symptoms, and I had every reason to be satisfied with her anwers. At that time I believe she was quite able to make a wiiL Croess-examined by Mr. Serjeant PITorr..-I had not at. tended her at her house before. Mr. Awre fetched me. I did not expect Mr. Smith to meet me. I found him at Newhham and a carriage ready. He got into the carag witbme. He appenaed to be a friend. I think I head M Hanrison was to be there. 1y attentiott was not called to this for a year after. I did not know that she hba made a will. I never saw her again. Mr. Smith took me back. I think I paid for the cariag I especially reoollect that I- paid attention to the Etate of her mind. The fact that the attorney (Smith) paid so rmuch attention to her led me to py particular attention. About 12 months afterwards I met Mr. Smlth, and-in answer to his questions I stated that she (Ki Higgins) was in the full poession of her facultle. I ielvo the party In attendance upon her (Mrs LeAwis) paid my fee. I should not have recollected that If Air. Sm.i hd not called it to my mind. Sarah Lewis, examined by Mr. COOsEx, said, I was first cousin to the late Mrs. Higgins. I resided about seven miles off. I hadattendedMr.and M Higgins du Inesses they had bd I was in the house when Mr. in died I bad been there five weeks. They both dieof bronchiUs. Mr. Higgins wes 84 and Mr. Higgin was in hsr 80th year.. . Bird ws their usul- medical attendant. Mr. Harrison was called ia through Mr Kea. He told Mrs. Kear he knew their complaint. Mrs. Kear was a distant relation of Mr. Higgins. I wernt cn the Monday, and Mrs. Kear was sent for by Mr. Higgins on the Saturday. Mr. Higgins died on the 30th of March, and tho funeral took place on the 7th of April On his death a Mr. Whit%, from Plymouth, came and claimed the property. I saw Mr. Osborne the ndght before Mr Rigginss will was made. Mr. Awre hAd been sent by Mrs. Higeins'x orders to fetch Mr. Smith. Mr. Osborne came instead He stayed 10 minutes or aquazrter of an hour. I heard Mrs. Higgins say Mr. Smith was to come down. The next moring Mr. Sn 'th came down. I was in the room. I went up with Mr. Smith. I went down, and thoughtif Mm Hlgginswantedmeashewouldsend for me. Iafterwardswent u Mr. Smith was there, and he said, "Mr lawi rs Higgins has thought of yon, andMmrs.Ke, and Alfred Meredith, and Henry ALwre.' He sid, "that is not what I want you for. She has thought of my mother-in-law." Mr. Smith looked a, Mrs. Higgins', and she sadd "Y Ys" and smiled. I remember Robinson and Parsons being there. I remember Dr. Evans coming. It was four days I paid Dr. Evans his fee. I got the money from the dresng. tabla drawer. She retained her fcultiertill -herdeath. Cross-examined by Mr. Serjesnt PIroo -I remember Mr. Smith telling her about her husband's ill She took to her bed soon after. She was very angry; she said he had wronged her, and died 'ith a lie in hts mouth, and the would not be buried in the same grave with him. Twro years ago I went for Mi-. Howell to Monmouth to-come and read the will to Mr. e Mrs. Higgins wshed her to come, as she saaa sbe was part ofr laIyr herself. (lAughter.) I told Mary Haddockthat if Mrs Eiggins had not madea w*ill the property would all have Bone to her husband. On the 12th of April I asked Mr Higns to maike her WilL. Hanky Awre went to fetch Mr. Smth. Itold him Mra. Hggh-wished to send for Mr. Smith. When Osborne came I don't remember saying to hia " It will never do to letMrs. Higgins know that we had sent for You." I don't remember that he said he would say 'he was going to Biakeney, and called on his way." Henry Awre wtnt up to see Mr EHiggins. Mrs. Lilley called and told her Mr. Harrison had forbidden anyone to see her. I told Irs. Hooper the same. Mrs. Higgins knew Henry Awe's step, and when she heard his step she said he was to come up. Mrs. Lilley often called. Mrs. Hooper was very friendly. By Mrs. HiEins's orders HenryAwvre took some deeds away. After herdeath he told me he had not got them al, and I told Alfred Mere. dith to give them to him. That was the night she died. I packed up the plate the next day. The plate was weighed after the sle. I paked up the plate which Mrs. Higgins gave me and gve Ft my son-in-law. I al0o sent awaya bVg ol guineas I did not tell Thomas Trotman I could not per. suade Mr Higgins to malke a will. 1 did not tell Mm. Illey a week after the 14th that she had not made a will. She said to me, " You are one of her nearest relatives, and I should think you would benefit by it;" She did ask meIfshehadmsdeaawll. I didtellher, "'We eoaldnot get her to make a will," but not after she had made it. She Ad not refvsd to make a will, but she said she thought she should get better. The night Mrs. Higgins died I- put on a large pair of pockets, and begantoput thingsinto them. (Laughter.) t thhs point the proceeditgs were In. terruptedby a Rev. Mr. Sayers, A magistrate, who, having made his way inside tee door leading to the seats Inaside i$ bench, insisted on being accommodated with a seat. These were oocupied by ladies, but, as the rev. magistrate insisted on his right to a seat, an appeal was made to the learned Mr Baron MAuTlx said thst those who had seats on the bench were welcome to them, and ha should not order any one to be turned out. The witness oontinuel I put the plate and bag with eas In my apron. Mr. Thomson wanted to put his nd S in ny zpran, ancl I begged to be excused. (laughter.) Re-ex&mined by Mr. W 1HAT 5Y.-Mr. Harrison pro. posed to make Ms Higgins's wilL Mr. Hairrson told Meredithhehad no businesa to dictate about the wil Mrs gins told me that when she did go I was to take the ready cash, and told me where it was. She gave xme, as I understoodi, the whole of her plate:. three sugar-tongs, silver half-pint, pair of ssltceLlrs and spoons, 10 teaspoons, eig^ht table spoons. They were valued to me At a little after 6 'clock Mlr. Baron Martin adjourned the cause till19 o'dockthismornolng, and proceeded with the trial of another crause. At the sitting of the Court this morning the .trial was resumed. Sarah Lewis, on being recalled, and re-examined by Mr. WHATxr.Y, said,-Mm Higgins was acquainted with Mrs Elliott. I never savw Mmr Elliott at Mr. Big. ins's. Mr.1 Higgins visited Mrs Elliott. On the morning when the wUl was made I got Mrs. liggns osteredup in the bed. She ordered me to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to get her ready, that she might not be flurried, and might not feel nervous. After the will was made and Mr. Smith was gone I went upeairs, and she reached out her hand, and I kissed her an asked her if she had done thingpto her satisfaction. She said she believed she had. She said, " Don't you trouble, Pveput you sale enough." Then she lifted up her finger, and aid " Remember, as long aa a man or woman live they can alter their will," and looked Ak me very hard. Then she pulled the wil from under her pillow, and gave it to me, and told me to put it in the dressing-table drawer, and lock it up, and put the key in my pocket. I said "No, a'am;rll put the keys in your pocket." She called ms " a foolish woman." On another occasion Mr Harrison, the surgeon, saw her. When he came down I went up. She said Mr. Harrison had told her he could not insure her life 12 bhus, and furthermore she said "he wants to make my will," and asked me what I would do. I told him topleasehimAslf. She said that if she let that fellow make her will it would be throZ every public. house in Blakeney, "and my afirs are in .Smith's bands, and Mr. Smiith shall make my will if I live tUil morning." She sid, "If I do live, I do live, and if I do dle, I do die." Mr. Osborne came in that night. Cross-examined by Mr. Seijeant PIGoTT.-I still adhere to my statement that the will was made the day after she took to her bed. I once dined with Mr. HIiggln, Mr. and lEMrs. Smith, And Mrs. Elliott. That was on the occasion of the prosecution about thewatch, six or seven years ago. Thatwas ater we came from the megistrate's. mrs. Eott was at the table. That is the only time I saw Mr. Higgins with Mr. Ellliott. - Mrs Higgins was also one of the party. fr. Higgins was in the hait of going to Mr. Smith's house. Mr. Smith was his lawyer. Mrs. Higgins was very angry with Mr. Hig about the codiCI; but I be. lieve she changed her feeling. I do not remem. her sasing to M.r.Trotmnau, "It was an awful death audlhope you and I shall never see such an one." I dia notsay, " You ma depend uonit they are both fightlng lubell." She was not to the lastextremely an8ry with her husband. She changed a fewv daysl before her desth. There wasa disturbanoe about the wil In two or three months. I told Trotman Mr. Smith had told me they were going to say Mm Higgins was not right. Henry Awre, examined by Mr. WHATxLL?Y, said,-I keep an inn tand a small farm at Aures. I was always con. sidered a distant relation of Mr. Higgins-something of the blood. I was very intimate with him for 20 yeats or upwards, and had tracions with him up to his death. Until he had a farm, and in harvest time, I used to asdsthim. When he lent money I used to go with him to loook at the pperty. He generally consulted me, and so did Mrs. igglns.I have taken money to the bank for him. Iatterl they aept no hired servant. Alfrzed Meredith lived with them more than 20 years. Since Mr. Higgins left the farm Meredith was my servant, but he slept at Mr. Hi,ggins's. MEr. Higgins lenti me at different tflmes up to 2404 At the time of his death I owed him 7401. Mr. Higgins a few days before his death sid, " It ia my wish for mywife on the day of my death to give you up your writings, and if I thouFht she would not I would do it through fire and wrater.' I soid I thought she would. He told me to mansage his funeral, which I Id. IIe gave me instruotions. When M1zs. Higgins wras so very ill, I and Mtr. Harrison (the surgeon) were in her icom, andr. Harrison said to me, "Henry, Mrs. Higgins ought to make her will." She saiad she wiould if abe did not get better. 1 sad, "If you wasn't to make a will, mada, it would be very awkward for me." She said, "No other man than Mr. Smith-shal make my wiL". I have heard Mr. and Mrs. 3Ig&I when they were together, say twould do something for Kr. Smith's fam'ily, for he bad got them many hundreds of pounds which they never wouldh 8ot bt for Mr. Smith. They knew Mrs. Elo. I have seeen them in Mrs.' Elliott's comupany, and I have heard Mrs. Higgins say she wished she lived nearer, that she mght ie her eltner. Z.

On Wed. nesdy, the isth of April, Ms. Higgins xent for me, and asked me to go and fetch Mr. Evains, 'as she wagsvery ill. I came to Gloceterand saw Mr. Evans, and he said he would comne do3wn. He went. I remember perfectly weU going for Mr.Smith on the 13th of AiL rs. Higgin sent for me and asked me to go to New= to fetch Mr. Smith. She sid hsb wasvery lsaud wnted- Mr. Smith to come and settle kmr affairs. Mr. Smith was not at home, and as lmrs Smith,'zAd he was akt Bristol, and was not expected home il thi late train, Iasked for Mr. O,borne. She said he was one home to tea. I went to Hr.

Mr. Osborne said, Alfred Meredith eoud reed it over, and she could alter it. She sId, "1 No, io onezshallmakeamywillbut Mr. Smith" I saw her the next d-,;r afxhdo made her will.

Smith ha been down, and she had setted her affairs, mad Mr.IRobinson of the mill, and the man who drove. Smith dow,, signed ier will." I saw her again on the MondAy, and from time to time dowrn to 1er death. I remember she sid it would be so expesive Dr. Evans attending her. but afterwards he sid it wasnot so expeilve. She said ftwas five gulne, buttabethoughtIt weuld have been more. I have never seen Mrs BiIMiat Mrs si Mr. Smith used to send tarts and je1ie esto b forc e thWmli. Cross.examlned by Mr. Seant PIGOnX.-I saw the man deliver the tarts. I nevertated hem. The old people were ill at that time. They were vry fond of my misss' puddings, which is -ver good. (Aughter.) They could not make puddings Mrs. Hear could not. I examined the deeds the morning Uiter Mr Higginxs death, before brekast. I did not take the deeds between 12 and I o'clock in the morning. She dled before 12 o'clock on the night of the 13th of May. Alfred Meredith calledm3e up, and I went. I ta yed there tlM 2 or 3 o'ldock in the morning. I did not take the deeds away then.

I go sometimes three or four times a-week. When I saw Ms. Hi ggins on the 14th she seemed better. I saw het worse everal times. She spoke tome several times about her will on different days.

-Thurs4y Evening. Thia hb4.beeu a day oX recoveg. The Indian ,news, although it confirmed the report curreat last evening, appeared satisfactory when taken in coaunetlon lrnith thexdetails reg4r4ing the checks inflted upon the mutineers at all points, the amoant of the force before Delhi, the paca behaviour of the general population, and the continued faithftilnews of tee Bombay snd lMdras armies. Thu quiotations of the rates of exchange from China Also wrere ueus nfavourable. An equally important effect was produced by the statement of the. ChanceLlo of the Exchequer, showing that the eseourcea of the home Government appearto be ample for-the wanta of the current year, that there is no intentiontojeopardize the revenue by foregoing anny portion of the exitng tea a-nd sugar dutiesat all evenfp, until 1860-that there ia-at present little appreheu!4on of financial difficulties on the part of ths East India Company, and that the idea of an 3English. loan being immediately desirable on their jZeialf was altogether without foundation. CoAsols for money, which were quoted last evening, after regular hours, 8!4 to 4, opeted at 89i to. 90, and, after a temporary decline to 89k, returned to 90 for money, at which they remained to the offcial close. Subsequently there was a further Improvement, and the latest tanso. tions ware at 90j for money and 90i to j for the 9th of September. The purcbass of the public during the day were large and numerous, but sales were pressed by the speculators. Bank Stock left off at 21 5to 216i; Reduced, 90qto i,; New Tbree peCents., 90 to ; Indi Stock, 211 to 21S; and Excheqaer-bblJs. Cs. to 2s. disco-unt. India Bonds Were less weak, and closed at 27s. to 24s. disoount. Very few transactions have occurredin the foreigna stock-market, and the highest price have not been maintained. A further small advance, however, occud inTurkish. Braiilian Five per Cents were negotiated at 3011; Russian Four-and-a-lf per Cents., 98k i; Spanish Pasive, 5q ; Turkish Six per Cents., 94 94i; ditto, for the acount, 54; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98*. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 95c. for money and 67f. 1So. for the end of the nollth, showlng no alteration. The letters by the present overland mail are expected to be delivered in the middle of the day tomnerrowk The next Indian telegraph may be looked for on the 28th of August at the latest. The vemel will be the Nubia, a fast acrew steamer, and, a the recent loss of the Erin will caume a blank in the China mail, the posibilty of a detention at Gaile, waiting for its arrival, will be avoided. Both the India and China exchanges show a de- clining tendency, and the drain of specie will there- J fore be slightly checked. A tCalcutta there seems to have been a reducton of about a-half per c8nt. At Shbagbai it is about I or 1I per cent. At 33ombay and Hongkong there haa been no altera. tion. A private telegraphlc despatch from Calcutta, reteived -to-day by one of the principal firms engaged In the exportation of manufactured goods to -nd3a, gives an mproved account of commercial prospects. About 6,4001. in African gold was sold to the :Bank to-day. The bulk of the recent American arrvals has been sent to the continenbt for the purchase of silver. The capital of the East Incia Company ;s 6,000,000l., and under the Act of 1833, which extinguished the trading powera of the Company, it 'was provided that 2,000,0001. should be Wet apar as a security fund to be applied ultimately, with its accumulated interest, to pay off the 6,000,0001. of Stock at the rate of 200 per cent. A Parliamentary return published to-dy fahows the total receipts on account of this fund up to the present time to have been 4,282,5941. -namely, 2,000,0001. the original appropriation, and 2,2%2,5941. for dividends. These have been invested in the purchase of 806,4201. Consols, and 3,899,2401.. Reduced, making atotal of 4,705,6W01. 7Ihree per Cent. Stoclc, which at the prices of this evening would be worth 4,251,7321., or within 30,8624 of its cost price. It appears that within the last few days a considerable proportion of the 1,125,0001. due for the redemption of the Sound Dues has been handed to the London agents of the Danish Government. It is understood that the payments on this accouut will not be remitted to Denmark, but wiU be retained to discharge a portion of the Danish loans contracted in this country. So far, therefore, from causimg mconvenience the transaction Is likely to Impart ease, since the sums as they are received will most probably be temporarily employed in the discount-market. Advices from Russia mention that the Emperor intends shortly to revisit Germany, where he haa left the Empress, and that an interview will then certainly take plece between His Majesty and the TB'peror Napoleon. The report of the Bank of Egypt, issued preparatory to their meeting on the 25th of August, states the profits of the Bank fro, the7th of July, 1856, to the 30th of June, 1B57, to have been 13,0211., after appropriating 1,l401. to the reduction of preliminary expenses. The business of the establishment is rapidly increasing, but it is carried on with great caution. The doubtful debts have amounted onlyto 8761., and the whole of this sum has been written ofF, although at least one-half is expected to be recovered. A dividend of 6 per cent., free of income-tax, is recommended, and 1,7711. will remain to be carried forward. The report of the English, Scottisb, and Australian Chartered Bank, issued preparatory to their 3meeting to-morrow, recommends a dividend for the half-year at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, free of income-tax, and the appropriation of 1,5001. to preliminary expenses, &c. A balance of 3,6401Z vill then remain to be added to the reserve, which will raise that fund to 7,6561. It was announced to- day that the Cyclops had returned to Valentia Bay with the news that a part of the Atlantic telegraph cable has been lost. AUl transactions in the shares of the company have ceased until the probable results of the accident shall have been ascertained. Advices from Buenos Ayres report the opening up of a new and important market on the western frontier of Brazil, by the banks of the IJruguayana, but it is feared that the shipments to it have been excessive.
