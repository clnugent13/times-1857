About 100,0001. of Australian, Russian, French, ma other gold was sold to the Bank to-day. In the days of George III. many culprits who had t6mmitted forgery under what were considered extenuating circumstances were hanged because men In like case had been hanged before, and if one was spared the others were to have been looked upon a murdered. In the present day the practice is revered. The plan is to hunt down some secondtate or moderate offender just for the sake of vindicating the law, and to allow to those of the first rank the greatest pomible impunity. The diectors of the Royal British Bank have proved such sapegoats for the offended majesty of the commercial public that absolutely a surplus of forbearance in other instances must be manifested to put the balance straight. Has any one heard of Mr. John Edward Stephens ? Certainly not as a delinquent to be pursued. It may have been noticed that such a person, described as a banker, " lately cl GothicLodge, Twickenham," is paxticipating in the difficulties of the period, and is about to avail him. self of the advantages of the Scotch bankruptcy law; but if so he has doubtless shared the sympathy awakened in most minds by a perusal of the Gazette lists, and commonly expressed in a general hope that all the poor creatures will get comfortably through their troubles. Yet the career of Mr. John Edward Stephens stands almost alone in the history of fSnancial fauds. Sir John Paul, ns it was abundantly shown at his trial, did not begin his busines as a banker with a plan to rain his victims. Only three or four years prior to 3is conviction he had a private fortune, and his malversations were evidently commenced to meet an mnergency which in a few months was to have been repaired. The same Is observable nearly without ,exception in every case. The first step consists in sacrificing principle to a momentary pressure. But 3Ifr. Stephenx, in bringing hopeless misery upon Ecores of families, must, as far as can be judged from aU that is at present known, have entered upon his course with a perfect foresight of its termination. He was manager of the London and Eastern Bank Corporation,-a concern started about -our years back with a capital of 500,0001., of which !250,0001. was paid up. His chief patron and oonfedexate was Colonel Waugh, -who figured as one of the most distinguished members of the board of direction. The objects of the establishment were to promote our monetary intercourse with India, and numerous subscriptions to the share list were con. sequently obtained from the savings of omfecers and others who had worn out the best part of their lives in that country. Women, too, were of course drawn to invest in it the whole dependence of themxelves and their children. Almost the moment these funds were handled the misappropriation oi 'hem must have commenoed, and in March last it transpired that Colonel Waugh and Mr. Stephens had absorbed for their own purposes not only the entire total, but a portion of a further sum intrusted to the bank by its ordinary customers. No explanation was given. Colonel Waugh absconded to the continent, and is now residing in Spain for " his health" on his wife's settlement (in handsome cases of insolvency there is always a settlement, 'which very frequently is then heard of for the first time), and Mfr. John Edward Stepbens has quietly remained in Loudon until within the last few weeks during which he has been residing in Edinbulrgh, wrhere he will this morning come before the Bank. ruptoy Court of that city. A sojourn of 40 days in Scotland is necessary before the easy privileges of that process can be secured. The object of mrStephens has obviously oeen to avoid the publicity ancd the rather less agreeable character of the London jurisdiction, and to deter any individual shareholder or creditor from incurring the trouble and expense of attempting to iuterfere with him. Perhaps he thought it well to make assurance doubly sure, but there really seems to have been little ocasion for him to apprehend that he would be subjectei to much inconvenience anywhere. }rom the first explosion of the whole iniquity to the present moment there has been no talk of a prosecation of any one of the parties connected with it. The British Bank directors, including the comparatively innocent as wellaa theguilty-and they were all models of virtue as compared with these men-were chased all over the oontinent, but in the case of the London andEatern Corporatiou there seems tobe a commaon consent that inquiry even shal be suppressed. 5What is the meaning of this? Have the shareholders and creditors entered into a combination to defeat the claims of justice ? Their plea will, per.haps, be that such is the state of our bankruptcy admbinistration that a resort to that Court would hiave been at the cost of additional ruin to themselves, and that they were not in a position to incur such a result in order to perform a duty which rested quite as much with the general public. But, after al thelaw-making of last session with reference lo these subjects, is there no public officer to drag these men forth, and purge the country from its Indifference to such candal? The last notioe of the Xffair was that the winding up is to take placein the Court of Chaneery, instead of under the private arrangement which for montbs had been previously going on. What is to be the result of this ? Will 3ir. John Edward Stephens, freshfrom his discharge at Edinburgh, be in any manner affected by it, or is tf to be publiclr intimated that for delinquents of lila stamp England will henceforth be an Alsatia there they may liesecure ? Tb,inpenson has been announced of lIvoem Albert Pell7 and Co., a firm extensively connected wlth the Norwegiael trade. Their engagements Amount to 170,0001., and the prospect of liquidation will depend grestly upon the su-ms that may be recovered from bils held upon other failed house. Two or three months back there was a surplus of 25,0001 Annexed in the circuar isued- 1, W3nhda buldings, London, Dec. 7.

The suqsension has also been notified of Mesr. Krdll and Cohn, a German fin, with moderate liabilities. The Amnexic nadviceto-day confirm the antleL pations expressed In previous letters that, whatever might happen on this side, the worst of the crisis at New York would be found to have passed. The banks hold more specie, and are stronger than at any previous period, and would reume instantly but for the fear of causing a reaction which might check the payments from the interior, which were now being made oax an increased scale. Dennistounl, Wood, and (lo . of Now York, had made an asignment of all theirpropertyin that cityfor thegeneral benefit of their creditors to prevent attachments, and the partners expressed a belief that their los in the United States will not exceed 100,0001. The agenti of the Western Bank of Scotland were also understood to hAve made an asignment. A report' hd been circulated that Richard Irvin and Co., the agents of the City of Glasgow Bank, had suspended, but it was entirely without foundation. The firm were prepared to cash every liability on preentation. Of 'the 290,0001. of gold brought by this steamer about 115,0001. consists of sovereigns. The remittance comprise. 40,0001. to Messrs. Palmer, Mackillop, and Co., in part liquidation of the claims of the English bondholders in the North Americn Ilfe and Trust Company, which had been disputed for 15 year. The principal of these bonds is 300,0001., and the overdue interest largely exceeds that amount. The nua at present available to meet them appears to be about 260,0001., and large usets, it is said, still remain to be realized. The stock-market had experienced a partial reacton from the late extraordiny improvement, but the last quotations given are those which prevailed just before the arrival of the newvs of the suspension of the English Bank Charter Act, which will doubtlem be found to have created a new advance. Erie had receded to 15k; Reading had reached 51i, owing to the settlement of variou:suits pending against the company; Now York Central ras quoted 77; ; Illinois Central, 94; Panama, 89; and Michigan Central, 56. The canals were expected to cloe in the course of a weekr, a circumstanca viewed with regret, as the quantity of Western produce still to arrive by that channel was very great. Exchange was firm, and the leading hous were ai3ng 109i. Telegraphic advics from Hamburg state that tho Senate and burghers have resolved to establish Inmediately a State discount hank, with a capital of [15,000,000 mark banco, and that public opinion is 6nthrely favourable to thisn measure. . It appears that the Wolverhampton and Staffordhire Banking Company, which suspended on the 18th of November with liabilities for about a million, Is to reopen to-morrow for the payment-of its notes, and that a resumption of regular busines. is, under certain arrangements, likely to be effected in the course of a few days. The following letter on the compulsory enforcement of unlimited liability aa a protection to the creditors of joint-stock banks, who, although belonging to the commercial community, are assumed by the Government to be wanting in sagacity to make such contracts as wiin best protect themselves, is instructive at the present moment. It will be seen that the evidence given by the City of Glasgow In favour of the paternal system was actually founded on certain " opinions" formed of the Western 3ank of Scotland as an example of its beneficial influences. Probably, how., ever, a great amount of public enlightenment, purchased by dearly bought experience, will yet be required before its true results come to be underatood. In principle, the interference of Government to dictate the terms upon which traders shall trust each other is of course admitted to be unsound, while the enforcement of the system upon dealers in money, and not upon the dealers In any other commodity, is altogether inconsistent. But neither principle nor consistency is just now in fashion with respect to commercial or financial quesidons. The victims may askwhatis the value of a protection that disarms their own vigilance and lands them where they have to struggle through all sorts of litigation, as in the case of the Royal British Banei, to get even a compromise, or where, as In that of the Western of Scotland, with 6 millions of deposits, they are condemned to wait for a couple of ye ars. The prudent merchant may demand whether these banks would have been trusted with almost exhaustless means for their vile career but through the false confidence thus generated, and the practical statesman may protest that a law w.hich has been shown to be so intrineically odious to all careful and honest men that few can be found voluntarily to place themselves within its scope cannot be adapted to a state of social progress; but they will be overpowered by numbers who will still, like the Glasgow authority, pour out the everlasting and all-sufficient phrase that, in their " opinion," there would be no safety for anything if a change were made *- " Sir,-Allow me to call Your attention to the report of the Mercantile LIw Commissioners, issued in 1854, and more pariculrly to the evidence therein containedrespect. iDg Scotch Joint-Stock Banks. " The comimisioners circulated a seies of questions with regard to parnensh, lability. "Question 8 was,- ' Are you of opinion that unlimited liability, in the intance of joint-stook assoctations, especially where there is a numerous and wealthy list of shareholders, leads to an undue amount of confidence on the part of capitalists or money-lenders in the Operations of the company ? "'Do you think that it induces a board of uncontrolled directors, where the partnemsip is a joint-stock banling company, to discount bills or advanoe moneys more extenaively and less prudently than the resources of the bank or the character either of the objects for whibh monev is lent or of the bills discounted would warrant? Are not the directors of other joint-stock companies, under similar circumstances, liable to lavohe their shareholders by entering into engagements of an equaly hazard. ons or objectionable character?' "To these questions John G. KinEear, merchant (selected by the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce), replies as follows, on the 3d of Deeember, 1853:- "I do not think that unlimited liability in jointstock companies whose partners are numerous and wealthy leads to undue confidence in the operations of the company on the part of oapitaists or others, or that the directors of such companies are peculiarly liable to involve their shareholders in hazardous or objectionable speculations. My own experience is that the reverse is Ahe cae, especially with joint-stock banks I consider tfe-unlimited liability of the partners the best secarity for the creditors, and for the partners also. Ihe unlimited nature of their liability as mulates the partners to elect fit and proper personsasdlreotors, men of wealth as well as experienoe, on whom their own unimited liability must operate as a check to impru. dent speculation. It is the direct interest of these directors to manag the affairs of the company *ith ptudence, and, if need bh, to p and wlnd up. the business before the whole pidd.up capital is lost; in other words before they have incurred liabilities beyond the amount of their whole paldTup stockr. . . . . .'The Western Bank of Scotland, in Glasgow, has a F~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~o W1 luo iU4onX Â¢ !1XpxdX "P inl the event of a sped&id porUon -of the, VpiW.W4lu lost The dirsetrs an imen of -wealth in the ity, or of laded property in the neidhbou&ng couut1, me. -who we to the lA dege unlikey to permit thir clause to b. 7ioltd, Or tobring the bank into such a poaftionast, zeuder the enfeeemmnt of the eause nheesy.'

I CEr UKITED STATES.% (wMil Io oW2r caRmum""tA NElW YOM: Nov. 25. The Atlantic arived on the 22d, bringing the intelligence that the Bank of England had raised its rate of disount to 10 per cent., that several eminent houses in the nmerican trade had failed or had been shaken, and that two Scotch banks had supended. This'news is more unfavourable than that by the previous mail, and it Is to be hoped conveyx nearly the extent of the calamity the rash here will produce in England,' ilnce a few days from the 11th of November must have suffioed to calm some of the worst apprehensions of the state of thirigson tXi side. First,' 'the certinty that no great amounts of "f specie" )were required here to pull us ttrough the' difficulty must have tended to lessen the fear that 4here would be a long and entensQve sdrh" of'gold ;,.next, th atrivalof ship. ments of specie from-hence toEiglaid must have furnished ocular and-tangible proof that it could. not flnd employment on thisa side at a profit; finally, when the English finanial world heard, as it must have done by the sucoessive mnails, that specie, except for a few days at the vey height of the cribs, has not been worth so much as one per cent, premium above Bank paper, one cause of terror at leaat must have psed away. The flow of gold In this direction could ;s"ly. continue l6ng. after such a plaii inimation that it is not wanted -as that given by the fact of immeilately sending itback again. - -hipments of specde 'havoSInde& hereon a ~t~irdrby he steamer arriving from iverpool,, and re-shipped for the return-:voyage by goe steamer departing on the Wedneaday following. There has therefore been a doub qle current of gold acros the ocesn, one sent West- wards on the caJculation of high profits to be made, therefrom under' a general bsiAi auspenuon, thb other eastwardsagain, in consequence of there being. really no means oi emploig it. If the re-shipmeats of gold to England have abated fears, lessened the demand for money, and lowered the rate of discount in Threadneedle-street, the effect has been slutary; but the lods of interest on all this too literally floating capital; with the chargesior freight and insurance, must be entered on the wrong side of the books by somebody. 'Under the first impresSion produced in Europe by the panic here correct calculatton of some of its anomiali was hardly possible, and during the time required to develope soime 'o thein measres have been adopted which a dilly kIdowIedge of whit was pauing on this side would have rendered unnecesary. The diaster that befet the iubmarine cable has been more than ever lamented during the past ix weeks. In this period it would have saved more than it cost to both countries, had it been at work, by'dissipating alam and preventing the useles danoe of capital, and the "cros and change sides"of specie. With the slenderwire in the bed of the ocean these freights of 'bullion would not have been sent on two profitlews excursions over its surface. The fortune5 of may firms really broke with that cable when it snapped on board the Niaara in August last. . The present actual -condition of the Neo. York money-market is sound, as far as abundance of money, and that not pajper, but specie, can producer srundnees, and it continues to improve. Bullioi steadily accumulates in the vaults of the banks; vlrtually, those establishmenta in this citymay b said to have resumed cash payments. They make no. difficulty of giving ispecie for their own notes, sand readily furnish their regular customers with hard coinfor checks, if it is required for paying duties aV the ustoin-house, which takes nothing but gold and slver. At noon yesterday ghe amount of specie' the banks of the city exceeded $23,000,000, after an export of $43,933 to England during the week-. There is, in fact, a superabundance of coin, in con: sequence of its flowlng in from the intenor, from California, and from Europe, and, it remains inactive. The difficulty and embarrassment ae not witikn 'the banking circle, but beyond It, buasness outside of the banks does not revive as rapidly as the store of bullion acoumulates; it still remains paralyzed and depred. The panic was not caused by any great national calamity destroying property, but a suddenfever fit of suspicion, excited by several sinister " developments" well calculated to alarm, which at once destroyed credit. From an exaggerated extenion of It to everything and almost to every. body the community has passed to the oppoaite extreme, and for the present believes in nothing. The shock was universal and cannot be soon recovered; and though the increase of ballion will naturally enoDurage a return of confidence, yet it is accompanied by revelations of recldess mismanagement, and worse than mere errors of judgment, amongmanagcrs of public oompanies andbankrs which retard the revivalof a healthy state of things. Even real property is seriously depreciated; sites in the best busines part of New Yerk, as shown by a recent sale, have sunk in value as much as 50 per cent. compared with what they commanded at the last transfer. Probably the present price is nearer the real value than was the higher sum paid in the periodof general ineation. But suchaudden changes confound all calculation and arrest enterprise. The banks are therefore not so much pressed upon for " acommodation" and advances, and are more cautious than formerly as to the selection of the Upape&e they are willing to deal with. To those "not eompromised by the failures and extensions of September and October" the market is described as " generally easy ;" but this condition precedent narrows the sphere of tranctions very considerably; it alwo appears that " the practice of lending on demand, on the pledge of bills receivable, is seAre-lylmown since the recenttroubles." It is diecoveredthatamountssafein the cashbox, and sumsof which payment is prospective, are two very different values. Speculation being checked on one hand, while the banks on the other exhibit unwonted caution in dealing even with the recluced number of applica tions, the increase of coin in their coffers is a natural consequence. They could formally announce their return to specie payments to-morrow; should the next intelligence from Europe be favourable, that step will probably be taken. In New Orleans it has been already done; thea banks there VE& asusPended have resumed. The country. banks, the notes of which have been received by the New York houses at par, are redeeming their paper on the usual terms. The dealers in money have enough of the commodity on hand; but the public has not recovered confidence enough to find employment for it. The following in the return of the amount of specie received by the banks during the past week : vrom Euxrope direct to Telw Yolk ...538,O0 From Europe fd Boston. . . 43000o0 From Cjfor . ... 1,176,000 From the Interior by exprems ... 5..00. Disbursed from sub-treasury, met ... 287,000 Together ... ... ... ... 2,931,000 The banks hold, as before stated, above $23,000,000 in specie; t4e exact figure is S23,167,980, and it is rather increasing than diminishing; the total amount of specie in the city, in the banks and circulating, is stated to be $28,045,640, or $3,000,000 more than the amount under the xame heads in the same week of 1856, when all was prosperous. Here, therefore, 1i an instance of a community posessing more solid money than ever, and yet poorer, more timid, and Eeemingly more helplees than when it had less. As there is no material reason for the prostration, the caues must be moral; and even with the encouragement of facts and figures the revival of con- fidece muat be ,th workloftime. WhatthattAte of tÂ£xngs woul be if the, above anoianth wee not so solid in their nAture as specie at is imposible to calculate. The tnotledge tht' the buisexists and is at hand keeps meii quiet and resigned at leSat. If the sums were only reprented by "s en. rities " there would be the wildest confudIonj and every difflulty would be multiplied ity-foli. The Atlantic landed a shipment of 115,000 dolrs froinEnglaudon the 23d The Arabia to-day (25th) will, Itis uppoaed, cay out a remittance of about 1,000,000 dollars The only branh of busin that can be described u active is that of the stock-market. The Beaws, who had achief part in producing the panic by their constant and ,sstematic depreciation of verything, wore punihed by more umeces in that direction than . they intended, ahaing knocked down every kin d o stock to the lowest point to whiich itcou fall and reisin any existence; {they have given a chance to the Bull, who, for the moment, have poeiot n of the fiela; for the lut10 days they have had the profit of a gradual but consant rise; there was room for an upward move.ment.- Even the unfavourablo te.-our of the news ,by the Atlantic only " tiffenedthemarket alittle, -it did not check purchaes. The ,truth is, for the ultrba-larmistS the effect of the e n panic in England has: hardly been diautrous etxough; the amount of damage done so r 15 3ot great enough for those who like a "csensation." This dims of persons had nide up thfeit nindafstI the Bank of nlnd must auspend payment;gonshe 4rntbrli of the Newr York disasters; th5t this would pro*duee a convi~si6n -rwkchi spreading to the eontin]1t, i'Culd ,virt i mot of the thrones of Europe, and inaugurate a lively and interestig period of universd zuin. Anything sh6rt of this will be a disappointment. The failure of a; few firms in the American trade and the suxpension of two. orthree.banks are nothing,- nor is rmoney at 10 per cent, alaming to those aocustomed to 26 and 30. If the return of gold from this side should lower tho Baik of England rate, and check any nauent tendency to panic, the sensationists Wil have to give up Europe as the probable- source of a aeoond excitement. They are stiii Inhop howevers and are going about predicting most direful things; as far as the present mail is more unfavourable in its tenour than the lut they find s degree of comfort in it. Next in intereat tofinanial affairsi the pendlng election of a Mayor for the city, and though the city polities are not of momentoux importmocebeyond the locality, yetthe present contest has some special and curious features. Eirst, by a recent Act of the Legisature the electionof Mayorhabeen separated from that of the officials of the State, and is held a month later; before, the Mayor was "run" with them, and carr-ed into oflice' by the force of the same great party sweep. Now lie must shtnd alonec irtually, which is an innovation. Next, et. happens that the present occupant of the Ci:vic chair in personally and morally obnoxious to the great mass of the citizens, but stands for reelection for another term, because he is the child and champion of the lowestand largestsection of the Democratic party, by whose support he rldes the city and the taxpayers, much as the Old Man of the Sea bestrode Sindbad niot to be shaken off by any effort, or, at least, by any hitherto made. He is hated, but alWays uppermost, and, though deeply cursed, continues to govern. TwQ hostile partes, and a section of his own, have twice tried to extinguish him by stting three candidates against hir, who Were alwaya beaten, becaue tlhough they collecively received the greater number of votes, yet -r. Ferliando,WOd `always showed more than either of them hingly NoW the tactic are changed, and the P-epublican; Native American, and the resPectable section of the Democracy have united on one man-Mr. Tieman, a Democrat, which is a necesity of the case, but also a gentleman of unblemished chaterand good poeition, which incity politics is a novelty. It would be difficult to give an idea of the depth and extent of the detestation in -which the present Mayor is held by all parties Men who have borne personal lomes and pecuniary disasters with perfect resignation break l into fury, and talk of halters and gibbets, if you jmention his name; and he has actually been nearer to both than beseems a civic magistrate. At the great public meeting held a few days since to seoure a candidate against him the denunciations were terribly strong, and unfortunately true also. "Robber," "swindler," and "forger" were among Ithe terms applied to him, nor were they at all figurative or used in a Pickwickian sense, but intended for exwactly what they express. The secret of the influence that bear him up against such a character is the spell called the " regular nomination"-that is, he has on this and former occasions secured the " nomination" of that small and irresponsible body which selects the candidates of the Democratic party, after whichthe party itself must confirm the choice. To go behind the noiniuation for such trifles as qualifications or character is not permitted, and to oppose it on any ground is treason. The words " regular nominee" once breathed over a man, the party is blind and deaf to facts and arguments. But the new law that divides the city election from that of the State is likely to shake this influence, as city reasons will come into play. TheDemocratioparty has, besides, just carried all before it in the said State election, and success in the more local contest is not essential to it; and as the coalition candidate is taken from its ranks, it is a sufficient concession to its supremacy. The panic, too, is unfortunate for Mayor Wood, as the city taxes are eight millions for the puat year, and will probably rise to ten during the next, with money more valuable than in the days of bank expansion. If those united against bim vote as they talk, there is a chance he wil be dethroned, but the "regular nominee" superati. tion is stl powerful. The election is on the 1st of December. The military expedition sent against "the Sainte" of Utah may be pronounced a failure. It will not reach Zion on the Salt Lake this winter, as it is understood it has gone into quarters at some station short of the holy city, with the loss of 75 waggons loaded with stores, on which a roving and armed bOdy of Mlormons pounced suddenly, finding the trAin marching without a guard, plundered it of what suited them, and burnt the rest, the waggons inclusive. It was a bold stroke, and a clear act of rebeDlion ; but, as a military operation, it was very neatly executed. It was not supposed, probably, that so audacious an act of defiance of the Federal troops would be attempted. The expedition started six months too late; the force was kept in Kansas till after the election, which took place in October; to attempt the march then was most ill-judged, as snow always sets in along the White MIountain range early in the winter. The insolent summons sent by Brighabm Young to the offlcer in command of the troops to disarm the men,-in fact, to surrenderas the only condition on which he (Brigham) would permit them to winter within his territory, is on the whole one of the most astonishing of recent documents. The policy of the Saints is quite inscrutable. Young is far too shrewd not to have estimated exactly the power of the centLal Government. Such -an expedition as the present i merely an advanced guar compared with the force that could ultimately bellaunched against him if he proceeds to extremities, and seizing and burning the military stores locks as if he is prepared to do so.

THE TA MONBTARY CEiIs. The Befast papers ate that in commeorcal matters everything paed off well on the 4th of themonth. Al bls were paid in the different bank- ing establishments. In fct even mi prosperoustimee, there haa seldom been a bill day on which there was more promptitdde in payments. TheDublin commercial report for the last week ae as favourable as could be expeced. Trade is very sound and money abundant out of doors, but thereduction in price on almost every leading article of produce has been enormous-whisky alone having maintained its full value during nearly three months of premure. The last Irish bank returns present the unusual feature of a contraction in the circulation at this period of the year of no Ieo than 500,0001 Concurrently with this there is an incremse in the amount of ooui heldof 130,0001, so that the stements we have made all through as to the cautious and judicious - system pursued during the period of presure havebeen most fully borne out. The amount held by the National Bank alone was 613,689b, or greatlymore than half of its entire i sue, so that it can, I eaily be seen how utterly without cause was the irun which some persons endeavoured to get upagainst it.

CHURCH RATES. Earl GRANVIILE, in reply to a question from the EArl of Malmesbury, said, It was the 'wish of Her Majesty's Go. vernment to introduce a measure during the present sesion on the subject of ohurch ratve, but it wa at present impossible to say when the state of the publc business would allow them to do so. THE QUEEN'S ANSWER TO THE ADDRESO3 The Earl of St. GERMANS, Lord Steward of the House. hold, brought up the following gracious message from Hor Majesty in answer to the Addresn:- "' I thank you for your loyal. and dutiful Address. Yon. may be assured of my cordial co-operation in whatever tends to Increase the prosperity ot all parts of my empire and to promote the welfare of a11 classes of my subjeots." LORP) GRANVILLE AND LORD DERBY. Earl GRANVILLE (who at times was almost inaudible In the gallery) was understood to say,-I am deslroas, my lords, of making eome explanation with regard to the contradictions which I felt it to be my daty to offer to oCertain statements of the noble earl opposite (the Earl of Derby) durlng the debate oa Thursday night. The noble earl stated that Major-General Hearsey had been reprimanded by the Governor-Generlal for having promoted a Sepoy to the rank of havildar on account of his gallant con-' duct at the outbreak of the mutiny. I had read all the papere relating to the subject, and my impression-an Impressionconfirmedbyaeveralnoble frlends nearme-was that no such reprimand had been given, and I accordlngly stated thatimpresdon. Sincoethenlfind,oureferringto theblue-book, that there are certain orders inexlstenoe whlch, whether right or wrong, limit the powers of officers commanding troop3 in the field, whioh orders did not orginate with Lord Canning. I find that Lord Canning, in answer to the announcement of General Rearsey In reference to the promotion of the Sepoy in question, said that he considered General Hearsey had no authority to mako any promotions under the existing rega. latlons; but, his lordship added that, as the prome-. tion in this case hsd heen announced, and was ia hls opinion richly deserved, he begged to submit t the Council that it should be confirmed. It appears to me that if the noble earl had read the blue-books, instead of a certain red pamaphlet, he would have seen that the intlnation to General Hearsey could not be considered a repri. mand, but that, on the contrary, the act of General Hearsey had been confirmed. The other statement of the noble earl to which I wish to direct the attention of their lordshps is ono with referenee to the eonduct of the President of the Board of ControL The noble earl on Thursday night said-and I am now quoting from the report contained in ltlc Vimes- "( Really, my lords, what I am going to say sounds so Incrediblo that it Is difficult to believe it, and I ask to be contradicted by tho Government if they are able to contradict me, but should they do so I promise to bring forward incon. trovertible evidence to prove it Some considerable time after the arrangements to whlch I have referred the right hon. gentleman the President of the Board of Control somewhat surprised the agent of the Peninsular and Oriental Company by a letter, in which he asked him if some plan could not be arranged by troops which could be sent to India bymeansof thesteamersof thecompany. Well,mylords,the gentleman to whom the letter was addressed read it over, and then examilned the seal and sorutinized the signature to see if it could possibly be a hoax, but fin4dig that it was a genuine production he wrote back to say, ' Yon ask if it can be done; why, it is being done and has been done for a considerable time? under the authority of the Government.' I ask your lordahips if It is not inconceivable thatthe President of the Board of Control, himself a member of the Cabinet, should wAte and ask if it was possible to orgauize a scheme when that scheme had been in full operation for a considerable period under the sanction of the Government?" I have since made inquiries in reference to that subject, and al I have to say now is, that Mr. Vernon Smith never wrote such a leoter, that the Peninsular and Oriental Company never received inch a letter, that therefore they did not make the reply which had been eugge6ted by the noble earl, and that reply was; not teceived by the right hon. gentleman. The Earl of DERBY.-My noble friend was good e4ough togivemo notlce, aboutan hourago, of hiszintention tomake some explanations as to oertain contradictions with which he met some statements of mine on Thursday lsst. With respect to the reprimand which I said had been given t) Major-Genoril Hearsey for having taken upon himself to promote a Sepoy-a proceeding which had been disap-. proved by the Indian Government, my nobic friend the other night charged me with having taken my statement3 not from the blue-book but from a certain red pamphlet. I admit that I have road that pamphlet, and, if any of your lordships should not yet have done the same thing, I would advise them at once to pernse it, for a more able summary of proceedings in India I never mot with. Ho-vever I did not make a single statement founded upon that pamphlet wit!. out verifying It by comporison with official documents, and my noble friend must admit that, even had I borrowed mnyfaots from the red pamphlet he alludes to, I did not borrow Its language. I stated that a reprimand was inflicted upon Miajor- Goueral Hearsey, and I say so still. Bat I fmin that I have judged the minute of Council too favourably, for I assumed that it contained a hlgh approval of General Hearsay's conduct; which was not the case. In the minut) of the Governor-General, confirmed by the Council, it is stated "That it is not in the power of the major-general 2emmandmg to make this promotion, which can proceed only from the Government of Indi., and therefore should not have appeared in a divisional order without the sanction oi the Governor.GeneraLa I sy that appeas to me to be a reprimand. (Hear.) It may not appear so to the Government of India, but I believe every gallant and high-spirited officer would feel it to be so. It is quite truo the minute goes on to add:- "-But the promotion has been annonnced by Major. General Hearsey, and is richly deserved by Sheik Philtoo, and may, I submit, be properly confirmed." (Hear.) The order of the major-gencral was undoubtedly confirmed, but the confirmation was accompanied by a r.epri 2nand. The next statement I made w respecting a refusal to insert the names of two offioess In general orders,in which the Governor-General says,- 16 I am sorry I cannot aee to Major-General Hearsey's proposal, that Lieutenant gh and Sergeant-Maj or Hewson who suffered so severely in the conflict with the nautneers, should be the subject of a gener order.", The minute goes on to say,- " I thilnk it should bo observed to Major-General Hearsey that it would have been better if the divi6ional order had not characterized Mungel Pandy's condition as one of ' religious frenzy.'" That is the notice which is taken of General Hearse's con. duct, and I am astonished that my noble friend should persist in saying it was not intended to be a reprimand. (Hear, hear.) The next matter upont which my aoble friend met me with a contradiotion was my statement that, for a considerable perlod of time, no steps were taken todisabuse the minds of the Sepoys with regard to the intntions of the Government to Interfere with their rolion, &f.y noble friend Baid, "What can you mean by that, seeing that within a mouth there was a discontinuance of the issue of greaed cartridges whlchhad been complained of ?" Bat *her .wss no declartion by authority to the Sepoys, tatluE that it Ws the determinAtlon of, the Government, 8It hsad evr beeg, to abtin fromuallsteps tending to. an interfeee with iheirralgion. NKoW, upon the 9of JnemT soble friend sear e ord.lBlenborongh) aked whether it vw the latentia of toe Government of India to iue any polamation to qiwt the 1ubc mind !n. that onnUtrYI K ' No,'" said my nobl cnd opposite (Earl Granllleb, " the oZvc etet bd no sucb intion,-lt wa eedless to issue any such deolarasto, which might -be aeobjeyco, The Government eatlrely approved the. conduct of Lord Canilig In absteing fiom diturbing tha p'bllc-mntind of India by any -suh proclamatioe." Btt what reaUy didhappeA At the very time the noble earl was making this.vindication of the Governor-General the GovernorGeceral had acted in accordanee; withthe suggestions of my noble friend (Lord EUeaborough), and had actually issued a proclamation such as the Goisrument at home wereland'ng him for sot iwaing. The only thiig is that ib was done three months later than shoild have been the case. Now, as to the third contradiction, I certainly ahould be very, sorry to misrepresent, or even to exaggerate, -the mistakes of the right hon. gentlemau the President. of the Board of Control, and I was not at all surprlsed that the statement I made the other night should have been received with an expression of incredulity, for when the sttement was first ade to me I said at once " That is impossible." In the statement I made to this House I belleva I said for a eonsiderabletime, whereasthespace of timewas only threeor four daja hbut the information was given to me by a gentleman who I am sure would not mislead me, rmd who obtained it from the msnager of the Peninsular. and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, a member of Parliament not at this raoment in England, to whom the letter in question was addressed, and by whom it was anrwered. Upon the day before Parliament met I again saw my informant,.and said, " This is a most. serious charge, are you ure you are quite correctin your facts?' 'ebiad "The-managing director to ' zhomhe had referred was not in England but that hewduld iavean opportunity of seeingthe other. managing director and wouil ascertain positively." Re didsee hint, andi-upon the next day he informed we that there was no mistake, and upon his authority I made the statement to your lord. ships. I shonld regret very much if I have done injustice to the President of the - Board of Control, but if 1 was in error I am astonished thkt the -noble earl, who zould have had immediate access to the best quarter for information upon the poEtnt if he had aicertined that I wvas misiniormned, shoiidnot have given an immediate and authoritative deniaL~ I cannot explain the contradic. tlon between the Iwo statements, but I have stated by what means I acquired the information; my-noble fr.iend has given a contrdIctIon, aud thera I suppose th~e matter must reat. Earl GRANVILLE.-A to the explanation respecting the.alleged reprimand.to MajorQeneral Hemrey, I have nothi to idd. .With rjPec- to.the other point. thoioml sion oftWe Governm'ent to aa pro nation in India, I will only remind your lordships of what was the charge made by the noble earl,- " Throughout the wrhole of this period, from thIe begin. 2n1ng of.ebruax to the 2Qth of March, no-single step, as fat as I can find. was taken on -the part of the GBoverunment either to disabuse the minds -of the Sepoys-on o subject of these greased cartridges, or to *tcertantheir probable intentlons and the extent of the dlsaffectpuprevaiuing among them." My answer to the charge was- "Neither do Iknoww hat authorltyjhe hasjorsaying that Lord Canning did nothing to stop the issue. of the greased cartrdges. To my knowtledge he sent a telegraphic despatch discouraging theisse, and ordering that 5he nativeo troops ehouId uee their owrn ammunition. Then the noble earl says thxt all this ought to have been foreseen by Lord Canning. It As remarkable that on. the 9thof June te noble earl opposite (Lord Ellenborough), whose knowvledge I have no wrish-to undervalue, began a speech in this HIouse by sayingthatlt wras painful tohim,and what he did notexet,to have to recur in Parliament to these matbtes, but that ra. cent and more setious events renderd it ne ." With respect to the explanation which the noble earl has just given,Icanonly saythat I held in. my handa correspondenlce which will place the whole question in the clearest point of viewv before your lerdsibips. My right hon. friend the President of the Board of Control, the momnent he became Aware of the nature of the imputation which the noble eal made aginst him, instuitted the inquiry amuong the clerks a his offlze as to their knotledge of the existence of the ground upon which the charge was based. They were, howevezn utterly at a lossu hoa to acconnt for thenoble ea l's satement, and accordingl the chief clerk at the IndLs Board, addressed the following letter to the managingdirecthr of the PenInsuia and Oriental Steabe pascket Company:- You will see that Ic ord Dteby makes avery round assertion respecting a correpondence between our Presiden and your board dpon the subject of facilitating the transi of troops across Egypt. The assertion is so strongly insisted upcon that I begin to doubt my own recollectona but will yOU bear me out in the impression that ro dire correspon deuce betwreen our offlce and yours has taken olace at a on thls subject, ana that tr e frat iotioe of it (nd that indirectly through the east Inc ahousefr was nh September To that communication the follownag reply was received at the India Bolard:- - "In reply to yours othis morning respetding All assertions made by tord Drby on the b ubject of facilttating the transit of troopa acroes Egypt, I beg to uay that this compny receved no direct correspondence from the Board of Control, Â«And that the firt communication bmade by this company for theconvyanc of troopse ri th Overlhand was dted the 9th September, and adi to the on. the East India Company." This correspondence canot, I thih, fa to dispel all douAbt In ref erene to the subject; but before I it dowz I cannot refrain from expressingt it as my opinion that wome precauti.on ought to be taken on siftnginformation before a ch^arge of this nature is brought against a pubLic servat who haAp peso tbeengagedlnthe dsharÂ¢ of an arduous dsst hear.) The noble earidenies thathehasberrowedhiss"a from that of the pamphlet to wAhich he has referredbut he will not deny that there is, generally speaking, a similarity-and I admit a judielousand prudentsmiaritybetween the expressionx and arguments which he uses au d thoae which fall from the right hon. getleaUn who represents him in another place. There is perhaps an exception to this rule to be found in the debates which took place upon the opening night of the sesion, when the noble earl made a charge in this House against the President of the Board of Control, and when an attack was made upon the Preddent of the Board of Trade by the leaderof the Oposi tion in the other House of Parliament. Now, I annot hel thinking that the better course to adopt would hae been for the noble Earl to have made the attack upon my noble friend the President of theBoardof Trade lnyour lordlhip ' House. and that, the repreentative of the noble earl in the other Rouse should have made the attack upon the Presi. dent of the Board of Control, when both my noble friend and the right hon. gentlenan would be enabled to defend themselves. (" EHear, hear," and laughter.) The Earl of DERBY. - I quite eoncr with the noble earl in the opinion that it Is desirable the utmost caution should be exercised in siftinginformation before a charge is brought aainst a public man*; and I must add that I thought I could have no better authority than that to which I alluded for the statement which I made, while it appered to me that I had so far sifted the question that I could not possibly have been led into a mistake. With respect to the similarity which the noble earispeas of as existing between my arguments and those which are used by a right hon. frlend of mine In another place, I can only say that it is not extraordinary that some such colneidenoe as he mentions sbould prevail, inasmuch As it Is my castom, whether in or out of offloe, to oommunicate freely with my colleagues in both Houses of Parliament. (Hear.) That is not probably the practice of those with whom the noble earl Is associated in the Government. ("HIear, hear," and a laugh.) I can asure the noble earl that I was not even aware that the attack to whioh he alludes bad been made upon my noble friend the President of the Board of Trade in another place. Ifheis particularlyanxious that I should do so, however, I have no objectiors to saake an attack upon him In this House. (Great laughter.) Earl GRANVILLE.-My noble friend has no particular wish to be attacked (a laugh), but when an attack is made upon him he is dedsrous that it should not be done behind his back. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of HARDWICXE.-My lords, I think I am bound to state that eitherin the month of Auguast or Sep. tember last-I forget wbich-I heud from the gentleman to whom my noble frlend near me has referred the state. ment in respect to the Presideat of the Board of Control which has been the subject of discusson this evening. I afterwards visited my noble friend at Knowsley and aen. tioned the circumstance to him. He at once said, " Oh, it is inmossible; it cannot be tre." That is precisely the state of the caae, and I shall only add that I made the st,t. ment on authority which I could not for a moment doubt. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-The noble earl opposite says that the statement of the noble earl near me is completely contradioted by a letter from the manger of the Peninsular and Oriental Steampacket Company in reply to one addressed to him from the Board of ControL Now, from my recollection of the Board of Control no such letter could have been sent through that office. As a public office, It corresponds only with the Court of Directors, so that any letter which was addressed from it to the director of the Peninsular and Oriental Steampacket Company must have been of a prlvate, and not of an officil character. (Hear, hear.) The Duke of ARGYI&L-It is quite true that no official communications can take place between the Board of Control and any other body except the Court of Directors. But I hold in my hand a letter which I think will set at rest the whole question at issue. Nobody imagines that the noble earl opposite made the statement which he has made without blienvig it to be correct, and I am perfectly ready to admit that it has been the result of a misconception. The letter which I am about to read to your lordships Was written to my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Ad. miralty by Mr.Willcox, who was-I am not sure whether or not he Is now-a director of the company. It is as follows :- "Dec. 6, 1857. " Dear Sir Charles,-My attention has just been caled to a report of the Earl of Derby's peech in the House of Lords on Thursday evening, and I read with great sarprise the following:- (Ele quotes The 27mes' report.) " 'L The Peninsular and Oriental Company offered in the month of July last to make such arrangements that the troops might have been taken across the Isthmus in 24 hours, and they likewise offered the use of theL- mail steamers, which would carry 500 men each trip. "'2. In the month of August an application was made to the Court of Directors to make the same arrangement withi the Peninsular and Oriental Company which had been offered and refused. ' "3. Some considerable time after these arrangements had been made, the President of the Board of Control somewhat surprised the Peninsular and Oriental C-ompany by a letter which he wrote to thsm to ask if a scheme might not be organized for sending troops to India bo the company's steamers. Nows this had been done for a considerable time, both under the authorit of Her Majesty's Government and that of the East Ina& Cmpany, and yeot the President of the Board of Control wrote to ask if it was possible to organize asclieme for doing it.' at I have to observe, in reply to te~tad2,ta hi Itatemestt are Utterly untrue, aud,ot enlY so, bnt- that nothing whatever occurrd in connezon withthe Peniusnixar anc[Orental Company whichbb pobUity could give'rise I; a m(scanception umpon the subjee".

INDIA. THE ARMS AND PRESS ACTS. TheEarl of ELlBOROUGHrosepursuant to notice and said,-The first motion I have to smbmit is that there be lidd upon the table of this House the Arms Act which hs been reently. r,aed by the Legislative CounCiL of India. I believe tho circumstaesow under which that Act was passed are these --There had been a moat unusual importAtlon of arms lato Ccutta, and It appeared that the purchases of those atm had been to a great extent made by natives. This naturally very much &larmed the Europea, inasmuch s they had before them the bad use which had been made of their arms by natlves in all parts of the. country, as there was reasonto suppose that there existed a: combination to massacre all the Europeans in Calcatta,' and m moreover there were present in that place i,000 or -1,500 persons, natives of Oude, who werd' .servants'of the lKingof Ouace. Underthesecircumstane" itws v n rally suggested to the Goverament that It would be desirable to diarm the natives in Calcutta for the' 'secrLity of the Europeans,i who are few in number, and had but a small military force for their protection. The Govern. ment declined, but aid they would produce a0 Arms Act, andthatisthe Act"whioh I wishtogseeandtohaveplceum before you. Tht Act, as I understand, adhering to a 'prn. dple very recently attempted to be introduced into the legislation of India, places the luropeaus and the nativesthe persons who abuse arms for the purpose of destroying us, and the Europeans who wish to have arms for their pro. tection-on exactly the same footing'; and it went to this extent, that Europeaus were not to be possesed of armg unless by the consent of a magistrate. Now, in the Mofusail, that is in the provinces, the magistrates boing to a great extent natives, the Europeans Ire therefore compelled by the Act to go to persons of this description, many of whomn aresuspeotedof being traitors, and many of whom have really proved themselves to be traitors, for per. mission to retain the arm necessary for their protection. Now, my lords, my apprehension is (the noble lord on the woolsack will correct me if I am wrong) that, according to the BiU of Rights, we English, being Protestants, are psr. mitted to have arms forour own defence. Why ? Beeause at that time the Roman Caitholics were suspected of traitorous designs, and there was a reason why Protestants should for their own eafety bear arms. Now, is there not a reason for confiding to Europeans in India a similar privilege, and for excluding, under present circumstances, thenatlve popu. lation ? Yet at this moment the Government of India consider It expedient, in accordance with what they caU a principle, to place both these classes of persons on exactly the same footing, and to subject Europeans to the disadvantage of not being allowed to possess arms unless by the consent of a native magistrate, if they should happen to live in the interior of the couutzy. My lords, that resolution of the Legislative Council appears to me to rest upon a total misapprehension not only of our poeition at the present mo. ment, but of the position which for years the Europeans necessarily must hold with respect to the natives of Indfa Our position in India is like that of the Normans in Saxoa England. We must be armed, or It is Impossible for us to protect ourselves. Instead of bringing in a meamre subjecting both English and natives to a law of{this description, the law of India ought to be, that every Englishman should be possessed of armg under a penalty for neglect of the ordinance; and, if a resident in India, he should even be oompelled to enrol himself In somr corps for ocasional disCipline and drill. It Is imposdible for us to preserve in security the lives and property of Buro. peans in India unleEs we, for a time at least, assume the appearance of an armed militia. My lords, it is not surprislng that this fatuity on the part of the Government acting upon a principle which never can be a'dopted in Indi (least of all at the present time), and subjecting our countrymen wvho are now fighting for their lives to this indignity, produced throughout the whole European population a very strong feeling of dissatisfaction and disgust. Of course there can be no objection to the production of this Act. Buet then thero is another Act, of which we have a copy, which was laid upon the table of the House at a very late period of the last session-I believe after I had discontinued attendance here-I meau the Act relating to the Indian press. We had laid before us at the same time the speech of the Governor-General in pronosing that Ao.t and lso some minutes of the Legislative Couneil in order to explain the circumstances under which It was pssed. Before I say a word regarding this Act for the suppression (for practically it is a uppresson) of the Englih press in India, I Aish youAr lordsipe disthnctly to undersand the difference which exists between the pres in India and th, press at home. In this country the re Is ephatcaly the press of te people of EugFZand. It Advocates their interests; It is supporteId by, them. Different opinions may be expressd by the editors of different newspapers; but the allu endeavour to impress upon their readers that their object is the general interest of the people, and if they did not it would he impossible, for them to exist. A newspaper must pay, andl it cannot pay unlesis Itrelies for supportu n the mtase s aby whomit ip to be purchased aud read. Batte ressrofIndia ina*totaly different position. In the lirat place there are two ldnds of joumnals-natlve and EnfWW The English Press ia not the press of the people of India. It Is the press of the stranger, the press of the Government, the press of the governin.- cla&% It advocates their interests. I do not say that it' ma not occasionally advocate also the general interest of the country - but that isnot the particular object of the En-I'-h press; At is to reprcsent the intercsts of those by w om iLt is especiall sunDpted-the governing class, and these interests the English journals have to support in direct contradiction to the general interests of the people of Indis. The native press, on the other- hand-erroneously as we think, traitorously as it has lately seemed-take u what it conceives to be the caus of the population genersy, and is opposed to the personal interest of the governg lasses.

Meanwhile It has no more influence on the people of India than the English journars vould hive upon the people of this country if they were published in Greek or Latin. On the other hand, the native press has no influence whatever upon us, for by us it is not read Howover, there cai beno doubt that, although upon the people of India the English press can have no effect whatever until its articles are trAnslated and have received a ogenral circnultion through the native' press- the native princes (and I think probably all the moreconaiderAbit persons in India) obtain for themselves; as I h&ve been . in,to,rmed,notthrough the European press of India, but directly f-oni this country, translation3 of all the articlE relating to tb4 Intere,sts of India whbich appear in the Eugli sh ne-0 papers.

We owe the saety of onr commuvnications di an extensve diostict altogether to the fidlelity of the Rejabs of Rewak and Gwa. Ior; bto if, inaste of abataiineg om making observations upon the conduct of thoe princes, the Indian newspapers had expressed doubts of their- fidelity aand, in the aspit which too much anlmatehp persons In tat country, had expressed a hope that when our rule was re-established there would be further and furher annexations, I aswre you that every part of oentral Indio, chefs a well a subjebts, would have bieen in armas agaitnst us. I therefore entirely agree with the Government in the ncessity of Making that condition, and also in the neoessity of makli dnrnI the coniution with reepectrn to the religion of the nativesr; but observe how eshe conditions fal in meeting the requirements, 'which arne equally, or nearly equally pressing, and how the Act itself and the conditions imposed under it go altother beyond the nooessity of thu' case. No doubt inceonvemenoe mar iresult-utder some circamostanera there may be more than inoonvenience-from the disemination through the press in India of observations tending to bring the Government of that country into contempt. Bat the providons of this Act are not confined to the general oonduct ofthe Government in India, but they apply to the conduct of tio Govaenment of this country ia so far as it affes the Indian empire. Al that the Government of India hAve to do is to p reserve their own safety, aud to leave us to ourslves ; but, Instead of confmuingthemselves to this object, they make the penalties attah to any newspapers or books whatever, wherever printed, and also to newspapers which rpubli pape printed elsewhere. Indeed, tha recent cae a newsa t per was either waned or suppressed-I don't remeber:wrt ch-for republishing Inte dias an a pticlefroman2wsper,calldthePr, published in this country. Now, obeerve what tue elfect of this provision really is. Thiaw rohibits thaepressof India fromspeking frEey on the asubject of the position of Engishmen In that country, and also with reference to thea onduct of the Government there; and, as far as It can, It extends its coercion to the press of this country, for It provides for prohibietihg the pubication of anything which has been publishea I Englad that may notnsuit the views of the Government of India, and'from the day of such prohibition any Engfish gentleman In India who knoWingl reeveI book or a nowewspaper o proibited wlnl b ibet a pnlt of 5001., and to two ymeas Imprisonment.

My lord,Idntko hte ti h ob1ect of this provision, btcrtil Its effect, if fully carried out-and from the warning - given to a newspper for republishing a pargraph from an Englis newspaper 1 have no doubt It Is intended fully to carry it out-its effect will bo to deprive us in tbis' country of knowing through the presswhat are th'e opinons of our countrymen in Tndia, and to deprive them, of 'what is stil more imiportant, the opportunity of knowing what we think of them. (EHear. hear.) It'will etablisha systemof mutual Igorance. The GoTerno-r.Gneral sald,when. he imposed the law,that It was directd aginst the native preoss; that the native press had pbihdthat which was fnjurious to the State - that he could no say the same of the English press; bul that he could not xee any solid standing ground on -whic'h a line might bedrawn marking out the diffiference between one and th ther That, again, Is following out the inisane principle oftreating inni-and epcal at the .present tme- Matves and Europeans upon the srme foo ng. (Cheers.) abt, although the Governor-General may not have bean able tofind this solid standing ground, it seems he ha3 found in the native press a steppng-stone from which to diret his weapons ainst the press both in India and ia this oountry. Suppose that two persons, one a native and the other an Engihman, were ten before a magistrate in lndia, charged with offenoes. Snppoe the proof atainst the native was decisive, 'hile that against the Englishman was extremely slight and that the judge should say to the native, P andyZ-hat is what we call the natives now- "you are convicted upon the clearet evidence; your offence is of the deepest die; I cannot say 'the same of the English- man, whose offenee Is very lght but I have no solid-standing ground on which a line may be drawn; I cannot nake any dEisnction between you, and therefore you muat both be subject to the same punishment." Can you cal tht justicer? Do you think th4t the Enro. peans with all their pride from the reooLectio of the libar. ties they enjoyed in their own country would suffer that ? But observe that while this Aet does that which is unne. cesary, while it aims at the freedom of the English press as wel as that of the pross of India,it faUls altogether in doing that which is nocessry. There Is not in the conditions one word with respect to the diemmintion of information with respect to the movements of troo s. At a moment like this that of all things Is the mosb important to prevent. If you look back to the despatches of the Duke of Wellington you will see how grevously;be felt the injury on this point done by tho freedom tnd indicretion of the press. (Hear, hear.)

(Hear, hear.) ase noble earl concluded by moving for a copy of the .Am Act lately EEsed by the Leisaive CounCIl of Inda; ahso, a rehurn of all native and Europsai 'newDsapers licensed under tbe .&ct of the Legla,latlve Council of India sed on the 13th of Jnne last; and ala, copies of all etiirs of wanng addressed to the editors oF any such nativ and IEnropea n ewsppers resipectivel, and of all revocations of tbe licenoes, if any, of such newppers, and, of all corres,con. dense relating to thre restitution thereoF. Earhl GR&ANVILLE.-Th noble earl, in pursuu4 oF his 'notioa, has directed his attention chiefly to the subjects of the Arms Act and of the Act wthich places restrIctIons onth# prem in Ind&; hut he began byatating that dalar had been felt in Calcutta for the safet of that plaes. TEhi very circmstnce wa folly Invst!fgted, and it wasz oascrtInd 'that there was nothing ta warrant V'ny ea alasrm as to -the safety of Calcutta The ArsActi to whic-h the noble earl referred contains provi. awirsp ect to theiotalJon of ltptre and gun, and writh respect to dealing Inars As the nzoble earl has not alluded to that partof the measure, it is not necessr for me togo into lt. Tbeother pat of the measure I do ;not think In any way meats the description wlifeh the ,noblo earl gave of it. The Act does 'not immedli' jatey compel the Eunropeaus. and atives to give Sup their arms, or to obtain licene to carry them; hut iti enables the. Governor-General in CouncUl to,proclimnany distrlcti,reerving to blinel tbe porer of exempting from the operation of the Act any persons or classes of persions whom hre 'may think fit; to exempt. I knowr that at Calcutta there was a eryg neraislithat ,maril law should be at once established, and general disappointment took pliceO that that was not, dons. It has been said that Sir Colln Capbell, supported by the Governor-General, desired the establishment of martial law, but there Is not the slightest foundationfor that statment. The towrn wan not in danger, randcontinued perfectly tranquil during the two Mahomedan festIvals, whEen danger was mos t o be apprehended. With respect to the defence of the lives and property of the inhabitants, their lordahips would recoUlect the ridicule with which on a former occasion the noble earl treated the idea of persons going about with revolvers under their umbrella ho defend themstelves. But the noble earl's objection to the Act is that Eunropeans are comprehended within Its provisions as well an natives. and. he says tha this is net the policyr we ought to purse|but the policy should betomaket,he English he liko Normana and th3 natives like Saxon. I eannot agree In that opinlon, w/hich I think is perfectly iceonsLstent with that portion of the noble earrs speech In wthich he observed that without Imutu al feelings of kldndoess the Governmlen t of India could |not be carried on. Nothing could be more inconsitent with such an opinion than the announcement in this house by one of Its most eloquent members, and one, too, who han had so much experience in India, that the fewrzesident E3nglsh there should act as Normans, and that the millions of natives sould be treated like conquered Ssxons A suggestion ws made to Lord Canning that Christians should be exempted from the Act, but, most properly I thinkc, he felt &tht since many of the native rajabs, zemin. dars, and their retainers, had exposed their lives and properly in order to stand by the cause of the Government, any act subjectinag them to a disarminent from which all Europeans and Christ'ian ere expressly exempted wrould have been a most unwnsre and impolitic meaunre. (Hear, hear.) Supposig the Ac proclaimed in any dir. trict, can your lordship. Imagine that it would be difficult for aloyal Englishman who wishes to be exempted to gve a t once -the onlb notice required with regard to the number of arms which he possesses and wthich he desires to retain 9 It must be obvious that every English man worthy of the namne will he very glad to comply writh the Act In that respect, and nothing mnore will he required of him, for the Act provides that in a proclimed disrict wherever any person make3 a return of the arms in his poe. session and requests to he allowed to retain them he wili receive a loenee enabling him to do so. There can he no objection, surely, to such anAt (HIear: how ) The noble earl, leaving the subject of the Atrms Act, proceeded to comment upon the restrictions placed on the press, and that question he seemed rather to darken by the statement that Lord Cannng had made an attack upon the British press at home, I deny that statement. I believe Ljord Canning would be infinitely fees likely than the noble ear Ihimself to object to the freet discussion of public ques- tions in the press, or to the widest circulation of a nything tending to the enlightenment of every class ef BrilUsh subjects. Nobody but a madman wvould think of attacking the press at home; and the day on jwhich such a question may arse, If we can venture to contemplate such a thing, will be a day d'ark and gloomy in the annals of England. But the English press In India, a s partly stated by the noble earl, stnds on a perfeCtly different footing from the press at home. Ntothing, indeed, ca nbe more dissimilar. Thenoble earl stted that the press here represented the people. That is sO true that I believe |there is no clans wfhich is not represented by a portion of the aggregate press. It is to be remembered, moreover, that our press is asisted and controlied by the Houses of Parliament and by the public meetings whilch are constantly held all over the country. The press eertainly influences and assists in the formation of public opinion, but public opinion daily reacts upon the press, checking and controlling it in a variety of ways. A wholly different stateof thingsexistsinIndia. Thenoble earl mnut have read the minute of Sir Thomas Munro, and, although he may not entirely agree with it, yet the author t. of Sir Thomas Munro is not to be put aside, es- ecia when he points out what dangers may aocrue in ndla from the errors of the English press, refrtring particularly to the msbchiefs which maght be preduced among the Sepoys in our own psy. It is woey of remark that the noble earl has treated the Act relative to the prem as if it werea permanent provlsionL adopted for ever in India, wbereas, in the letter alroady presented to Parlianment and by the Act itself, it is clearly conflined to one year, and is intended merely to apply to the extordinary and exceptional circumstances in which India is now placed. (Hoar, hear.) I may state that the English press in India, by an order issned by the noble earl himself, is now pro. vented from obtaining that official information which it formerly ued to possess. Sinoe the promnlgation ut that order everybody connected with the Government of Lndia has refrained from writing in the press or glving it intel-llganoe, and henoa the absence of any securty exoept the loyalty and judgment of Ite managers for the wise and sober exercise of its power.

I was glad to bear the n2oble earl affirm, so firmly a.s postively all the principles ofLord Cannng policy with rerd to the punlbmoent of the guilty and theihowng, I not ay marcy, but justice to the innoeant. Itntirely agree with te noble earl that the oly means oE insuring good -government in India Is to oduce and encourage-confidence between thepeople and thelr rulers. If our government is to continue, cur only object mnust be thehappinew of those whom we govern. That object isperfectlI compattblo wiiththebestlnterests of the inglish nation, and E believe that when theselevents re calmly condderd, and at all events, when history shall pronounoe its verdict, nothing wil so entirely justify lord Canning as the cAlmoeEs and the Snrnees ith which he resisted the presSure to which he wAs subjected to Induce him to place Europeas and natives on a different footng. s conduct in this re. spect will, when this dlsstroux mutiny has been suppresged enable the Government to resume its former course, and lo be administered without its being regarded by the native& as a tyrannical and hostUe power. This calmness and couae Iord Canning has displayed In the highest degree. I have seen letters in which he has been accused of every compatible and incompatible deficiency which a man could exhibit under such circustances; but I anm bound to say that in some of these very letters, written before Delhi was taken or Lucknow reached I have seen imputations of actual cowrdice cst upon both General Wilson and General Havelock (hear), the renlts of whose operatlons havo shown that not onfy was every bit of caution whch they displyed ab4dlutely necessary, but that their objeck have been attained only by the most heroic exertions on their parts. (Hear, hoar.) On the other hand, my lords, I have seen letters-from young men, It is true, whose opinons are not worth much, bui still showing that the conversation which they bear is noW all on one side-defending Lord Canningsi character and' conduct, and complaining of the unfairness of the attacks W6 which he ha been subjected. I have also seen letters from some of the ablest Indian offioers, praising In the highesi termatheoouoae anthe ooolne of Lord Canhig. I havsieen letters from elvlians who have passed their whole llv.t In India, holding exactly the sane language, and stating that the real cause of Lord Canning's unpoprularity among a certain portion of the Calcutta peo,ple is the singar calmness and absence of fidget with wich he ha ap lleda his energies to the workn haband. Do youwishL toinoo what General Mansfield thinks? General Mansfiele said, by the first mnal, that he could only judgo Lord Cau. ning to be oneof the beat men of business that he hacAevamet; by the second mail he wrote that, having had sameb o,pportunity of sECertalnin facts, his belief was that the one calm head in sctta was that upon Lord Canning's shoulders. (Hear, hear.) Sr Cohn CAmpbel thinks that the English in India are fortunate in having shc their head at this momnent so able a chief, so perfectet gentleman, and such an admirable mn of business as IArde J"anning. (He, hear.) I think that to some imputatiou Lord Canning is jusly liable. I think; that, at a momentwhen great paulo existed ix Calcutta, he was rash in trust. Ing himself to troops whose fidelity might be suspcted; but it was at a timeo when he felt that, as our domnion lax India depended upon the belief In our self-confidence and courage, It was of thb greatest importance that the head of' the Europeans in that oountry shoud not be thought to be deficient in thoe qualitles. (Rear, hear.) And I m quite sure that, among Englishmen vn, toogrenat an Indiffereosc. to peronaldanger is not likely verylong totdllagainstloIS Canning. (Hear.) Ihavethoughtitrighttosaythusrauch In justice to Lord Canning. With regard to these two A ct li admit that possibly there may be defects in their degauss but I cannot aee the justice of the accusations which the noble earl has brought against them, and I oertainly be. lieve that by the means ot these measures the principle of amciliating the native tribes has been carried out, without; In the sightest degree endangering the lives or the property of the Europea residents. (REear, hear.) The Earl of ELLENBOROUGEL-If I undestood the nobleearl orrectly, he expressed the opinion that Lord. Canning is more favourable to the liberty of the presa that Iam. EArl GRANVILE.-More favourable to free di-cas. sdon. Lord ELIENBOROUGH.-Free discunssion I I thonght. It wa about the pres Asto that, LordCa&nning,% Ibera4 Ws the author of this Act. After I had been in Indiethree days I was subjected to much more abuse than Lord Canning. I saw the danger arising from the indiscrelon eP the press, and it was not for want of suggestions from homethat I did not adopt some measure against it. The Directors,. I recollect, suggested to me that it would be adviable to hmn poe some restrietions npon the prets, and that it wold receive the cordial support of theBoard. Totelltherel truth, however, I suspected the quarter from which the eommunib cation came, and thought that I had got diffioulties enongk without engaging in a oonfliect with the press Therefore I bore the abuse as I could, and my only offenoc wAs that. after my first three months' residence in India I never rea aword thatappearedinthenewspapers.

Mr. IL MILE S.-The noble lord gave us to understand that he wa In expectation of receiving additional Information respecting the condition and treatment of the two Briti engineers who are detained in prison by the Neano. litan Government; I beg to ask him fwhether he has re ceived that Information, and if hhas, whether he wil communicate it to the Housa ? ;ord PALMEWSTON.-The qtuestion of my hon. friend has onlysanticipated an intentlonwhich Thad to askpermlssion to make a statement somewhat modifying that which- I made on Friday.. On Saturday morning we received additional despatches, and another despatch was received this morning. I am sorry to say the aceount which those despatehes give does not tally with the account received before from the Rev. Mr. Pugh. The Rev. Air. Pugh stated that the men made no complaint of their treatment, that they were in good health, and in a tolerably spaciouw apartment. On Saturday morning waereceived despatches from tho actIng consul, giving an account of an interview which he and the father of bne of them had hbad with the engineers. They seem to hanv entered into much more detail with re. gard to thelr treatment since the commencement of their confinement. They did not know the chaplain, They did not know who he was, or from whom he came. Hon. memben wil very easily undertad why they did not like to expatIate very much on thelr con, dition to a stranger; but to the acting consul and the father of one of them they were more communicative. (Hear.) That which they complain of is, I am afraid, not at all exceptional. Of course, it is well known that lleapolltau prisons are reI a disgrace to a eivilized countryh and that the treatment to which prisoners re mbjheted Is more fitting a barbarous age than tihe present time. (Chers.) However, the englneers had not beea sabjected to anything like torture, except that the suffering from being handouffed azid apped when no suoh security was neceary may be somewhat . eo that desciption. They hadben oconfinedat first surd for three months in a dark, damp, gloomy cell, with attendant ircmstanoes which made It paricuarWly offensive- and in. jurious to health. Their health had suffered, and It ir quite true, though It was not stated to the chaplain, that weeof them In a fit of despondency, occasoned by the trtnent they were undergoing and the proepects before them, did attempt his lfe. There was albo reon to think' that on oe of the intrrogatorls of a witness an attemps was made to falsify the evidenoc I was corrected, and the statement was afterwards made suck as the witness deposed. With regard to their present situation the account of the actn* oonsul and the father tallies very much with, the report wllch 'Mr. Pngh had made-namely, tht they were In an sparment sufficiently airy, and that there was nothing In their present treMatont which could be materally oomplained of.

LONDON, TURDAY, DKCB3EZJR 8, S.X7. Their Lordships met at 5 o'clock, when Earl Sr. GExarAxS, as Lord Steward of the Iousehold, read Elm MAj=sry's gracious Answer to the Addrems of their Lordships Ia reply to the *eech from the Throne. E:arl GnAwviuz begged to correct an error into which the Earl of DEBy fell on Thursday, when his Lordship rpoke of Major-General HxA.BSny having been reprimanded by the Govmwon-GLw-AL for promoting a Sepoy for distinguished conduct in aiding the General in 4uppreming a mutiny without firt consulting the authorities at Ccutta, and obtaining their approvalofsuchpromotlon. The fact was simply that Lord CkAiinG had communicated to General fixEszy that it was against existing regulations for any officer to promote a Sepoy with. out first consulting the authorities at Calcutta, but, so far from his having given General HEis any reprimand, he even confirmed the promotion. In reference also to the accusation that the Government had taken no step to disabuse the minds of the Sepoys of the notion that they intended to interfere with their religion, it was quite without foundation, as the authorities in India lost no time in iuuing a proclamation on the subject, recalling the greased cartridges, and giving the natives permision to use - their own ammunition. The Earl of DzRBy contended that if the Govnuxon-Om;Rss., without inquiry into tb,e facto of the cmse, tolc an officer withouit furthet,comment that *13 had done that whch he ought not to ha'vo done, iswa* some:thing so like a reprimand that any offcer ;in HnuTM&ESSy' svice woudso rO ecelve it. Hisb Lordsip also generally repeated the ciharge of the want-of energy shown by the Government in not issuing their proclamation sooner. Earl GP.ANvnu believed that the noble Earl had been misled, and intimated that public men should be more cautious about receiving information on whichthey afterwards founded grave charges against other public functionaries engaged in the discharge of most arduous duties. His Lordship also twitted the Earl of DERBY on the similarity, not only of the arguments, but even of the jokes used by the noble Earl and his colleague in Opposition in another placo. After some further discussion, The Duke of ARGYLL pointed out the inaccuracy of other statements of the Earl of DniBy relating to the refusal of the Government to availthemselves of the repeated offers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to take out troops overland to India, which offers had not been taken advantage of by the Board of Control. Since that atatement of the noble Earl had appeared, he (the Duke of AR!GYLL) had received a letter from one of the directors :of ltih Peninsular and (Orienutl:Oompepny, in which i-vas distinctly stated itat at the time referred to by the noble Earl no 'auch tender for the conveOyAnc oL*roops had been ma~e by the ompaay Io,the i.Thearl of D ruitvat.hs d I iied thbAt the frAc*laa I" ethwd nwas p,blied iii the Fenin aula* and Oiental Qo lny'i root to Tho abiect RD thp e. a- - oe ,M.e LOBD C *z..on red a,B hee!fomn nm Ma, annoC. her g i to confer a pension of 1,OOOl. &year Upcn 3ajor.

The edfect of the measur., if fully casrr ou4 iWou2d be to derie the Englih pubic of the Indianewp; and, what Ws more to the purpone, prevent the Europns in India from lmno6wig what we thought of t he. i.Lordhi:p, in conci0o4-wIhl condemnm.g in the strongest terms the Sopo atro. cX-itie and the necessity for piublic vengeance vo the peertotwof those diabolical acts, sai ffu4~ or tihe other hand nothing shiould be neglecte which couldacoure tous the confidence of thie satives in lIndia. Lord Gswrvix could not for a moment agree wMt the nofton that 'we should keep sucha, peoition in Indi as In thi country the Normans once held to the SAon. Neither could he sge wit the noble Eair that the Anms Act waa a grievance to Enropeavs since the law ximply required, the Englabman to come forward and give notice to tha magistrate of the arms hewanted to keel or cay, to enable him to do so legally. He vindcated the operation of the law rnetic'nc the ldia .preo from the censure which had been cast upon it, ard xtated that it Was only owlng o that lair having been impatly enforced that Lord 0A?<zc anad bi admintitratiox of. the ffalirs of Indi had been so recklesly sttacked. Up to three weeks before that law cam8 into opetion there was srcely a European in India wlho did not coincide with Lord CANxG andi sympathaze with him. He quite agreed with the noble Eal1 that no effort shoud be xsp tc ecure the confidence of . the natlves, and he was sure that when history should 'pronounce its verdict uponx theso tanactions in India its high euloglum *ould be passed upon Lord Ca?Ga for having se the pressure to put the Europeans and natives upon a different footing, a mesauro which would lead the whole ma. of its population to regard the Government as a partisan and a violent hater of their race. Lord GPr cord1ially agreed with the impartia policy of the Arms Act,which he ntimated had been resorted to from sheer necesity, and to prevent a trade which might, and there was no doubt Would, have bsen carried on between the nAtives and some bad Europeans, had the latter been allowed to poes uamS to My extent. It was a paramount necesity that the Government should be sl conducted M to secure the confidence of the natives in India, for the days of our empire there would be numbered if ever its vast population. .abould inow that our rule was inconistent with,their interests.- Afe*r,f6w.wordzfrom. the Lord MA1XxrMj , who defended generally the remarks made b L ELLiNBorOUGr, The Marquis of CLAN&nrARDz expressed his approval both of the Arms Act and the restrictions on the Indian pres. The free sale of arms to all persons and a free press were totally incompatible with carring on properly a civil war of such magni. tude as that wn Indiax The Duke of AxGar deprecated further debste upon the subject at thepresent time, and made an eloquent defenoe of Lord CANING, whoee leniency bad more tended to check the spread of mutiny than the most severe sentence had done at the outset. After a few further observations from Lord DErnY with reference to Lord GRAxvargs statement In the early part of the evening, Their Lordships adjourned. In the Houe of Commonr, in reply to Mr. Mi. Mirqs, Lord PxRSvow made a xtatement regarding the two engineers taken on board the steamer Cagliar, somewhat modifying that which he had de on Iriday. He was sorry to ay that by accounts he had reoDived on Sunday from the acting British Consul it appeared, although the engineers had not been subjected to actual torture, they had been confined in a dark, damp, gloomy cell; that they had complained of their food; ani one of them, in a fit of despondency, had made an attempt upon his life. lTera had been also an endeavour to falsifythe evidenceagainstthem. There was nothing in their preeent treatment, he said, materially to complain of, but the Government were expecting further accounts. Lord PALTORms brought down a meGsage from Hm MlrrY, recommending the House to enable HEa .A&=Y to confer upon General H.VEzLocx, s a mark of her approbation, a pension of 1,0001. per annum for his life. Upon the motion of the noble Lord, EIm x&. ranr's most gracious Memage was ordered, to be taken Into onAideration this day. On the order for the second reading of te Bank Isues Indemnity BiU Mr. Gr&sTohz objected to the wordlng of the first clause, which, he said, indemnified the Bank for acts of which Parliament knew nothing. lBe like. wise asked for explanations respecting the profits on the isues already made-whether they were to go to the Bank of England or to the Government; how they were to be computed-whether they were to be profits of the issues or of the discounts; and, lastly, whether the profits -were to be alculated on tho amount of the issues made to the issue deprtment of the Bank, or on that portion only -whicIt would go to the public ? Sir H. WntOUGuBY hoped that before the Bill went through the committee some explanatiorL would be given as to the necemity for supending the law, and how the pressure came upon th,e Bank of England; whether there had been any unfinx action, by combination.or conspiracy, upon the currency of the ompire. - Mr. CAYMLrx entered at oonsiderhble len4tb, ancl somewhat difluiaively, 'into'a general critici1m upon the monetary system of the country and that of the oint-stock banks, and their operation upon the aome and foreign trade. Ile &,ndemned -the exhting sytem as Impracticable without periodical collapses. Mr. COxnnHA" regretted that the Government had not gone further, and declared their intention to abrogate the law of 1844, whicb, although not the cause of the recent commercial panic, in his opinion had seriously aggravated its Seyerity. It attempted to cary out a theory baed upon a fallacy. Mr. MALs cordially approved the BMil; he only regretted that the interference of the Government had not been much eurlier, and that they had not armed themselves before the clobe of the late wseion with the power to take saeasures. for the relief of the then approaching stringncy., lr. CnoSSLEY thought that credit wa due to the Government for their interference without pressure.

The inteigeneo received last night at the Yoreign-offlce from the seat of hostilities in British Zndia may be summed up in a few words. The beleaguered garrison of Lucknow was still holding -out. Two convoys of provisons had been conducted safely to that place. SirCow CAMPsBL himselfhad left Calcutta in order to preside over the operations in person, and all the available British troops were being moved up with all possible despatch. This intelligence covers the state of facts until ithe end of October, and doubtless in speculating -on the event we are treatin, of a foregone con-elusion. Before this despatch had reached us Luckknow had either fallen, or it had been relieved& It was not in the nature of thing that -the siege should be protracted indefinitely, am was -4he case with that of Delhi. In this insbance We -are dealing with known forces. Could the -defenader of Lucknow but hold out for a few weeks after the date of the despatch there -would be on the ground a European force which, -mdded to the strength of the beleaguered garrison, - would be amply sufficient to deal with the rebels -on fair fighting ground. The point is one upon which any man may form his opinion, for there is no concealment of facts, nor any mystery about --their import Three thousand desperate and disciplined British troops are, or were, fighting for their lives in the midst of a native army by all accounts some 30,000 or 40,000 -atrong. The advantage of position was on the side -of the Brizh, for, althoughthe worls and buildings they oocupied would have presented no very insur-mountable difficulties to a besieging arrsy of Europeans, it is well-nigh superfluous to say -that when the besiegers are Asiatics-even diseiplined Asiatics-the case is widely different. In the - despatch we have received it is mentioned that -according to general report the Indians had -with them some 300 guns. This number is no doubt greatly exaggerated. Considerable allow-ance, too, must be made for " telegraph-guns" and other implements of the like kind, which, however formidable in appearance, would not in all probability add materially to the difficulties of the besieged force. Still, when all due deductions are made, it is very likely that the rebels had with them a very numerous and powerful artillery. The fact being so, we can afford to look it boldly in the face, for it is not within our ex.perience that an Indian force, unguided by Europeans and unassisted by European combatants, could manage to carry such a business as the storm of Delhi to a successful issue. Now, there can be no reason to doubt that the -esistance offered by our countrymen in Lulknow -will ha-re been as cesperate as any recorded in the military annals of any nation. Not only in their -case can we depend upon the inherent courage of Englishmen and upon the -warlike ability of their chief, but we know that there is not a man among -them who is not fully awara that the option is between defence to the last and death in the most -cruel form at the hands of the rebels if they are -conquered. On the whole, there seems little reason to doubt 4hat if their provisions hold out the garrison of Iucknow will be able to maintain their position until the arrival of relief. There was no complaint of any want of arms, ammunition, or any of the matiel of war. The question was -simply one of food. We cannot, unfortumately, add one word of explauation to the irief announcement of the telegraph, that two -onvoys of provisions had reached the town in safety. It would only seem probable that had these convoys been inconsiderable or unimportant the intelligence of their arrival would not have been transmitted from the other side of the globe. But if they be of sufficient magnitude, as seems probable, to have afforded substantial relief to the besieged, it follows that they cannot be so straitened ,by the hostile leaguer as to render their resistance 'at all a hopeless one. The last days of a besieged garrison can scarcely have arrived when two heavy -convoys are safely passed through the besieging force. We may add to these ascertained facts -And to this reasoning upon ascertained facts that time was working heavily in favour of the besieged and to the prejudice of th. be- -ziegers. The desperate character of the ')nltiny-and the convietion of its ultiraite asitspeedy failure must have occun-eed very forcibly to the minds of the great bulk of the mutineers. Delhi had fallen, and they knew it; -indeed, many of them must have been refugees from the captured city. They knew, too, ihat the masses of mutineers in their. flht, wherever they had been encountered by the avenging forces of the British, had been scattered to the winds, and that such of them as hiad escaped had only found their safety in a race for life. They knew, too, that Britixh troops by hundreds and by thousands had arrived and were wrriving in Calcutta, and were on their way to the ground before Lucknow. They know, finaly, that if a day should ever come when they were to meet the relieving force in the open field they had but little mercy to expect from the troops who had 'come expresly to exact a dire retribution for the past. The country behind them was open for Ilight, and the thunder-cloud was gathering in their front. We cannot, of course, Inow. iWhat is the nature of the authority` tos- 'hlch theyy Ave. submitted themselves, but it can arci et have had ;time to consolidate itelf sufe.- ciently to keep together huge maes of men ho inuiit beforei all 'thingx bie e'nsedi each n personX,p l 02i1 ety.

Sfirt reinforcements, but, asumiDng that all the ships mentioned In the despatch as "spoken with" had arrivea, we may reckon upon additions of 3,000 or 4,000 more to the British troops actually in band. It remains only to add that the telegraph brings a report which we most earnesty trust is unfounded,-to the effect that General OxRx. Wad been wounded in action with the enemy.
.;That thle ..ovEs roiusir and . ouncil of Ilndia, shotadhave incurredthi hptitif.he3i settlers and of a great part of tha ofiial world in certainly much to be deplored. Where a few thousand men are to hold their own over milions unanimity and good feeling among themselves are indispensable. The public hive consequently seen with extreme regret that between the Government at Calcutta. and the British population, which should be naturally its chief support, there ba arisen an animosity which neither danger nor a common feelingof patriotismeemBsabletoallay. Thefact 's the more r-emarkable and the more lamentable, since never in the history of the country was the home Government more willingly and earnestly supported by men of all shade, of opinion. Hlere the Legiulature, the pres, thie great corporations of the country, and the publlc, as a body, have been ready to intrust the Government with almost unlimited power. Every speech at a meeting or banquet, every article in a newspaper or review, has added strength to the Quxaes MiniBters by xhowing the unanimity of the nation and its resolution to crush and punish the treacherous revolt of the Sepoys. All this time the Ehglish of Calcutta have been almost inclined to imitate the example of the native soldiery, and to rise againat a Government which they consider to have treated them with wrong and contumiely.: This difference between opinion at home and opinion on the spot has, no doubt, been partly the result of the roceedings of the Council, but it is also perhape inevitable from the circumstances of India 'and the position which a commuinity of the dominant race hold with respect to the Goveruniient and to the mwses of Aiatlcs whose affairs it administers. The two measures which have oalled down such obloquy on Lord CANr=G were the subject of a debate in the House of Lords last evening. Lord ELzxBonouGH moved fora copy of the Arms Act lately passed by the Legislative Council of India; also for a return of all licensed native and European newspapers, and for copies of all letters of warning addresed to the editors of any such newspapers. As Lord ELLZNBoRouTG in the course of his speech admitted the neesity of almost every act of the Government, and as his censure dwindled gradually down until at last it became a mere expression of opinlon that what had been done was not done in the moet judicious manner, there was really little left for Iord GiRANVI to answer. But the subject is of such importarce, and involves questions so much affecting the permanent government - of India, that; we cannot join, with Lord Gxux in. regretting that -it has r been thus brought before the country. The question of the Arms Act is easily disposed of. In this case we must conclude, with the majority of the speakers, that no hardship was suffered by the European body In India. The Arms Act was passed at a time when it was uncertain whether 24 hours would elapse without a general rising of the population of certain districts, supposed' to be disaffected.' It enacted that every person should send in an inventory of the arms in his poSSession. Those thought trustworthy would receive the permission of the Government to retain them. Now, this enactment would evidently prevent no one British settler from keeping his weapons. It was only necesary to comply with the law by sending in the statement, and there could be no doubt that the authorities would gladly see arms in the hands of every Englishman throughout the country. But the alleged grievance was that the English were placed in the same rank as the natives. The law had been passed to prevent the latter from posessing weapons, and no special exception had been made for persons of European blood. Hence the indignation and complaints of Calcutta. Now, the question how far the European and the Asiatic shall be equal before the law, subject to the same code, and amenable to the same tribunals, is a large one, and we have no desire to discuss it now. Whether Europeans generally should not be excepted from any permanent Arms Act is a subject which the Legislature may well consider. But in this case it certainly seems that they had no just cause of grievance. The Govermment might be supposed unwilling to alarm the suceptibilities of the millions who still held to their allegiance by making at such a moment any marked difference betwecn them and the English who were scattered among them. It is the true policy in times of danger to embody strong measures in gentle forms ; and to pas an Act for disarming the people, making it nominally applicable to every one, but really enforcing it only on the natives, seems certainy as sensible a proceeding as could be expected from a Government. It shows more irritability thau good sense in the Europeans to makle so much of what was not an injury, and could not be intended as an insult. The Act for the Restriction of the Press was undoubtedly a more serious matter. It was suddenly proposed by the Govzunox-GaRXuR& and pamsed within a few hours. By its provisions any one who kept a printing press without license might be fined 5001., and imprisoned for two years. Newspapem -might be " warned" or suppressed- for containing articles- obnoxions to the Goversnent,wwhether they weor original or extracts. Any ngl;Ah ne)wsp4per right be prohibited in India, and any person introducing a copy of such a paperafterprohibitionwas liable to a fineof 5001., or two years', imprisonment. This Act, which seems to have taken the community by surprise, was at once followed by an outbreak of animosity on the part of the press. It is asserted that up to the sudden introduction and passing of the Act there had been no illfeeling against Lord CANxiNG; that, on the contrary, every one had been inclined to augur well of his career from his general demeanour, his great industry, and his aptitude for business. There can be little doubt that this feeling would have continued to animate the press, and that the Government at Calcutta would have received the satne thorough support which has strengthened the Ministry at home. It malst be allowed that, to threaten men who had given no offence with two years! imprisonment in an Indian gaol, merely becanse they might possibly say something imprudeni during the struggle, was hardly the way to oonciliat the goodwill-of a elass from whom, after aU".,bte public at home. kaia most of what it kzM1% Qf Iot L The number of2 English newspapers is not #X large tut 'th,t the iri4es and iutextious of: the- GO,er3m;ent gt ha.be.,i cow ,ie to their conduotor, and then the Act regultingthe press would have been aequiesced in as a- necessity duing. a tie of danger. The iea sure was eviaently inteided to , xuppre3s the sedition .of the native, and to guard against any imprudence of the English papersx In conformity with its legilation on the kms question, the Council had determined to make: no dstinction between the English and the nativ'e'p' and'the determination appears to us to have been juatified. The mistake was not inthe act, bat in the manner in which it was effected. That at a time of 4uch awful peril it might be right for a-Govertment to, inspect the intelligence an4'the comments -which were sent abrosd among- a alf-barbarous populationean hardlybe denied.

The debates in the House of Commons fairly represent the state of public opinion on' the. currency question. The special enactnents of 1844 have their supporters and their opponents, but one great principle has been firmly establishqd, in the admission of all parties that the bank-note ought to be convertible into gold. The members for Glasgow have wisely abstained from urging on an unsympathizing audience the doctrines which 'they lately deduced from the practice and consequent necemities of the Western Bank. In truth, the collapse of that disreputable establishment and the scandalous efforts which have since been made to conceal the ruinous state of Its affairs have 'done much to clear up tho doubts which prevailed as to the expediency of maintaining a convertible currency. The advocates of the policy of 1844 were sometimes baffled by the confident appeal of Scotch patriots to t'he prosperity of their national system, but, as Mr. G"srozxE remarked, Parliament is now in an unexpectedly favourablo condition for dealing with that safe, easy, and economical method of banking. '" That .2,000,000.," he said, " of' gold s"hould have been sent to Scotland to enable "people in that 6untr to go on with a Vytem of "investing their capital in securties, iatead of "employing gold, which would not be so profitable to them, is indee a singular state&of things.. It "is, no doubt,' extr6mely satisfactory to theem, but I ',' I hope~ the intelkect of ' Eingland ii not so en- I "ctirely in the baciground but that we under-, |" atand at whose expense thi has been done, As. " an explanation of the present state of things, I " may say that no doubt the system that pre"vails in Scotland is an extremely cheap " and easy system of living for a private inai"vidual, who cam prevail on his friends in that "way to pay his debts." Scotch xpeculators will not find it safe to reckon further on the com. plaisance of their accommodating frierds in the South. Votes of confidence in the defaulter moved by all the Dukes and merchant princes on the Clyde will have the effect rather of promoting irritation than of reviving credulity. Perhaps, by this time Mr. D.Aoisu and Mr. Buc,wTN may have advised their constituents to return to Glasgow without preferring to the Treasury tneir modest demand for an advance to the Joint-stock Banks out of the public funds. Even Mr. SPooNR. har discovered the necessity of restricting the manufacture of promissory notes. According to hIs present scheme the Bank ought to issue in its own name paper payable on demand, and at the same time to administer a separate State currency of inconvertible obligations. It is satisfactory to be assured that a motion tending to carry out so preposterous a scheme would scarcely find a seconder. Mr. GLvi considers the effect of the exisiting law on the country eircu- lation as highly beneficial; and, notwithstinding' the vehemence of his language, he simply proposes to vest a limited power of relaxation in the Bank Directors rather than in the Government. Mr. HE,LEY urges the curious objection that the restriction imposed on the iÂ£sues of the Bank tends, under certain circumstances, to produice an unwarrantable inflation of crmiit. None of the speakers,in the debate professed the opinions in favour of a paper eireulation wvhich were openly put forward during the last Parliamentary discusion on the general question of currency. During the recent controversy some progress has also been made in the public mind towards the establishment of a just distinction between the maintenance of public faith and the soundness of commercial credit, or, in other words, between the employment of private capital and the regulation of the national cunrency. Lord JoHn RussELma, in his lucid argument in favour of the Ministerial proposal, pointed out the absurdity of expecting that panics and losses could be prevented by any method of dealing with the circulating medium. " All" he said, " that any "Act of Parliament can do is to endeavour aslfAr "as possible.that the national currency may not ."be imperilled, or rim-the-risk of being: swept "away by the torrents whieh occationally desolate "the field of :eonmmerce." The Act of 1844 has, as he explained, fully effected its inimediate object of securing the convertibility of the note. It has only failed in providing embarrassed traders with as many notes as they may require for the discharge of their liabilities. - Mfr. DisnAu expresses the same opinion, with pardonable exaggeration, when he declares that great commercial distress can no more be caused by the. management of the currency than a great nobleman can be ruined by the management of his pocket-money. The question of t'he currency is sufficiently importaut to engage the full attenticn of Parliament, and the,subject is strictly proper for legislation. With the other causes which may occasion or relieve commercial distress it is only posible to deal partially and' indirectly. Yet the intimate connexion whieh exits between the practice of banking and the operations of trade furnishes a reaEan for contiumng the inquiry which was commenc in the two preceding Sessions.

It is difficult to speak to people. dmtressed and hunger-stricken, of whom the numL-r. Is, we fear, increasing, because there is one argument which nature appears to put in their mouths as an answer to any word of an adviser,-" You are not in cc our case." This is a natural argume.nt. We do not say that it is a deep, one, or even a reasonable or a sensible one, but it is undoubtedly a natural one. It is thefirst idea which occurs to a poor man when one of his so-called betters begins to lecture him; he says immediately, " Oh, it is all very fine; you "can give capital advice-you can teli us aii in "the best language to bear our sufferings well, "to be quiet and orderly, to submit to the "trala which PROVIDENCO sends, and to wait for "hetter times; but it is easy to preach resigna"tion with a full _tomach, it is easy to be philoso"phical by deputy; if you were in our case you "would knaw what real trial was, and how hard "it is to flesh and blood." We believe that this is the great argument wbich makes a population under severe temporary distress so .inaccessble to persuasion. They think that nobody has a right to advise them, that misfortune,. at any rate, confers the privilege of being let alone, that; in fact, together with its miseries it imparts au elevation, lifting them up for the time above ordinary reason, and giving them a right' to take a high tone with advisr-an immunity * which is, indeed, regarded as a sort of compensa- tion, a veri poor and melancholy one, but still the only compensation they have for 'the evils they are suffering. All persons connect a sort. of dighity with misfortune, and this is the dignity which is often connected with it in the miund of the operative. 'Andm yet it must be clear.that 'when men are in tho exciteimnt of' diJculty and dlatresj and under circumstances which severely 'try their sense and discretion, and tempt them to acts of d1soraer, there must. be the. right,. somewhere or other, residing in some persons or. other, to give * them advice, even if that advice consists of no miore than what would spontaneously' occur to them6elves, if it is no more tlian the sinplest comIMon sense. It does not stand to reason .that a large class should be in the disquiet and agitation of distress, and 'that7 nobkdy in the world sh6uld speak to th'emn. If ther are any persons who have a , sincere wish for. their' welfare, feel . real sympathy with them, ahld are anxious that .they should not do anything which they 'will afterwards regret; such persons. have the right, which belongs to jll1hoiest,neighbours, to speaElT,thiem. Without honesty an sincerity no, man has thec right. to say a word. and with, honesty and sincenty any mau has the right who has anything to say. We are not'going to read the distressed crowds of our maliufacturing towns, just thrown' out of 'work by this financial emergency, a lecture upon the duty of saving in the day of prosperity in order to be prepared against such a catastrophe. Such a lecture; however correct it might be upoh a returi of sunshino, would' be inopportune now,'apd look like simply adding reproach to misfortune. '.e shall c Antent ourselves with one two plain. pieces of advice, which will. be vexy: easy of fulfilment. In the first place, do not listen to demagogues who rise up on such 'casioils as these to set you against your eiApIc,yews,. aind persuade you that these seasons of distriaassje owing to some fault in somg% particular cl',As or:to some defeets in the arrangement of the iocial system which mray be repaired- -some inequalities .bich mayX W bevelle..

It is quite'true ia,, thee ce of 0Â£c improves such iuddeil commotions as these way be 'more guarded against, and preventives discovered, but in tho meantimel they must and will occur oecamionally. Our opera.ties kno6 this perfec,tly well, but, as we juot'now sid, in there' seasons' ot distress they are apt tb indilge in the privilegeo of being unreasonable, and to think that misfortune raie them above the claims of evidenoe. - -They know perfectly wellthat *hat these demagogues' ell thent on these ocalior, ish nonisense'; thei'know; that the masters smart as wqell asthe en, ind thatit is to nob6da interest that mills should be sshut up or half'ime begi, ' but they. exercire what appear th6 legitimate :ii-Pghits of &aversity-t4ey ,WWl t-'theinaives- bi-tke- woird of resosnr nd 1-d tdrrie to' believe shit -omebod,y TaI .' o, tliiem.- of, Wrong impa3 jan, excitement to dtress and' eems to aUlay its' pain, on the pilncivIe' of eounter.irritation.* But if they know-and: we; Are certain they do know- ibat,what these 'agitaforx say is nonsense, it is ,no,* ;nuch' to ik' that they shciuld not listen to 'them. -It-will be,an-et of self-control and for; earane-an, actby wchich they will give up cej" 'taiWimount 'of 'excitement and- morbid agitation, whiC,h men are ,apt' to like on such occasions as Thiese; but it will be richly -rewardec& by the ad.- VXntae of an undistire and heihtenea: pynpat.hy,from their masteza. and the public. 'Tn the next place, they need not suppose that' ,tLi'gloomy crisis 'is et6 La for ever, or even to. last long. .Evybodykiow this theoretically, but pra;ctically the eflect' of d5stress is often sO 'to'-3ower the spirits and fasten the mind upon present evil that, a mtre temporary calamity acquires a kind of1imAginative endlennes. They do not see their ,way out of 'it; all is' dark around them, and the hreizon is as nlack as, the sky overhead. But this' ,iAmero lmaginati6n,for everyboly kmonov that such -acrisi, as ,this is only tetporary, aud maust pia8 off soon. Mqeantime, the law of this country is that iobody shall starve, but that every man, woman, and cbild in the country shall have that which shall preserve life.' This in the law of England; it is the fundamental condition on which every one who, inhabits a British house or, owns a British etate enterswuponi his occupation and his tenure. in perinciple the 'whole pro ertyof Great Britain is pledged to this law, 'and that wiiole property, andevery farthIuig 'of' it, must go to the dogs before one single man shall be' deliberately and knowingly allowed to starve. The operative, then, whatever be his distressw has the necesary .1upport of life guarmated to him upon the scurity 'of the whole 'roperty of England. The pleasures of life, or the comforts of life, may not be, ibut the necessaries of life are secured to him, 'and he may as mAuch;depend upon them as upon the sunrise or the tides. ' Azd, this being the cue, distress like the present is simply IfBe under gloomy and unpleasant circumstances, borne for a particular time, and 'that' certain,. by every evidence,of precedent, to be a short one. It is a. fate to which, under some shape or other, everybody, 'even the richest and most splendid members of society, have to submit. What is a sickness which onfines a man to his bed or to his room, and is accompanied with much.bodily discomfort, but life borne under painful circumstances ? Let our. operativei'only- rfefct'tath'thi crisis of ' dist is a - tianient one, and they :ill see tbat it is no more, ihun Iat; they ,i*4d- bear perfec,tly well and 'take as a-matter of course if it came to them from naturno more, indeed, than what, as coming from this latter source, they copstantly do bear, and think-it part of the law of existence.

Tnx LxvTAN.-The work at the launch was resumed early yesterday morning, and with great difficulty a start of a few inches was made. Unfortunately, the pressure required after this was so great that the supply-pipes of two of the hydraulic rams were burst or broken in such a manner that a considerable delay was occasioned before they were sufficiently repaired to be fit for use, and it was two o'clok before further efforts were made. Between that hour and half-past 4 o'clock, whenwork was discontinued, svevil smnal slips were made, the bow showing at every time a much increased ten. dency to descend fasterthan the *stern. During Saturlay.this tendency showed itself in again of 16 inches on the mtern, but at the close of the day's labours yesterday the bow had descended 10 feet 7 inches, While the stern had only moved 3 feet 4 inches, and this difference in progress had so turned the stern ecadle on the ways as to induoe an increased amonnt of friction, which deducted considerably from the amount of progres. It is, however, confidently expected that the result of to-day's ( Uuesday) work *i put the vessel in such a position as that ishe may be safely left to the influence of the next spring tides.

. .s . -FOMIN IKTBLLIGBXB. - FRACE. (FROM OUR OWN OORwBONDMq.) (A POZIj of the following &ppeavd I ou- smond ,a. iemiof yeewnwday-.- j, PAW, SUNDAY, DM 6, 6 P.M. In my letter of. Friday I mentioned that the .Presse had been stopped for an artiole on the refusal to take the oath by two of the rbcently elected deputies for the department of the Seine, namely, M0M. Carnot and Goudchaux. This refusal was probably laderstood as a censure on the oonduct of the two other Democratio deputiec, MM. Darimon and 0111vier, who, with little or no hesitation, submitted to the test. M. Darimon Is one of the writers in the Presse, and the article In question, usnuy vague but strong in comparion with. the timidity or subserviency of the rest of the press, severely censured the conduct of the recusant deputies. Besides these atricturesit launched into a strain to which the public has been for a long time unaccustomed. Yesterday the Moniteur contained an order from the YMinister of the Interior suspending the.Presefor two months. The order is as follows : " Considering Ar. 32 of the organic docree en tho press cithe 17th Februry, 1852; 'Coideeing tv warngs givento ike Preae under 4at rft Mfrch, 1853; 24th Mah, 1854; and 26th March. 18-57 ; "Conwdering the aicle published by thePrusee in Its auinber of the.3dinst., commencing with thee. words, 'Das1 Zla Ilecour qui oad eu lieu,' under the sinaure 'A.

The pro1b which preos. eupy the political world dlmplifY themselves-parties draw cloeer together, and reckon their numbers-it apper as If we had all heard, from one end of Europe to the other, a voioe caling on us to arlse and march! Ought We, always living on our reminiscenes and our regrets, to ink deeper and deeper in our dejection? Oaght the revolutilonary ?arty to mitate the egitimisto, whom abstention has re uced to ullity? We have already reckoned our numbers; we know that we re a great party devoted to revolution,' " Considering that, senseless as soh expreuons may be, in the midst of the profound pce which the country now enjoys such turbulent spirits caanot be alowed to freely preach up aittion, and appewto revolutionah, pbapions, " Consideslng tha, for the general inte6tt and partwo cularly for that of those labozious cles for whom no one in France has ever maifested more anxiety or exerted him. self more effectally than the of perorl the right an duty of the Governunent are to showr IseLf seveore against the mad:exs of those pretended Democrat. whose infuence, if they ever had ny, canot but be dMisatrous to the welfare and the regular proges ofa D the Demcracy whch, happily, mhey have henceforth no poter to disturb; "hDecrees as follows:- "tart. 1 The journal Za Preund es speded for two oniths from this day, 4th December. "Art. 2. The Prefect of Polece in charged with the execution of the present decree. ' BILLTA UIT." The article, such ar7 it is would probably have passed unnotitced, or wrould have been soon forgottent had not the eosniteur directed the attention of the public to it; and the effect may be felt at the lew elections for Deputies to fill the places left racant tby Mh . Carnot and Goudchanw o Besides Pris there re a few hacancies in the depuatments, where the proceedings are Wingularly illustrative of the purity of election, as undertood by the Government press. The wonitdr of yesterday announced that Dm Segur, Deputy elect, and Government pominee, tendered the redgnaion of binseat, which was of course admitted It appeasr that the circumstances of this election were sauch tht the comruittee ohareed with the "v erification of po iers refused to pas.s it. There 18 probably some retnt In Paris, but in the country it seems to be tron aide, and on the present occasion the " eccentrIcitIes" of the authorities were such that even a committee of the Legis. 3ative Body was forced to annul the returo. A report to that effect waa brought up, and was on the point of being read, when the deputy was given to understand thatkresIntion was th wor. eSiratiom was perhaps conyidered better than the pubiica- ion of the proceedings. When the Preddent of the Chamber ainounced the reItrement of a Sngur the report was withdrswno M. Ollivier, one of the Democratic Deputies for Paris, asked perhission to be heard on- the question before the House-namely, the reslgnation. Bfelievng he had received it he mas beofnning hi apeeuh, whn hen we sas metwth cries of ?o I no u" aud Md. de Moray said, En his sternest manner, "CSir, I have not granted you perission to speak." "I thought you had," said ELf Ollivier-" u9 as I was mistaken I nowr ask iti" "Very well, Sir," said M. de oiorny, "I refuse yon permision." "wThen all I have to do," replid the disappointed orator, " is to it down; I cannot contenld against 200 persons who refse to hear m." of. Ollivier put his ech in his speech bupocket and sat down. Public curiosity, It is said, X likely to be edified bv further discloures respertno g thee ethinor the rlaut Rhi, wrhere, ia I have already Informed you, ount rfigeon is determined to again present himelf to the electors. The Tbunal of Colm vr, as you are awaro,sentencedhimtoronemonth'almpryoAmentb It was saidthat the Pzocureur meant to appeal againvt this eenbnce, on the ground of its bevg toollenyent That functionary has to the 22d of the present month to enter his appeal, but there are some misgiVil3gSall to whether he ill persIt. Be tho as it may, the resignatio of Mp. Migeon veems to have eterfered with the preconceived artangemen. Mad his election been driputed on the "verlfication of powers," it wouldJ mnost probably have been annulled; if not dis3puted, the past would have been buriedale oblivion. But the voluntary resignation of Id. Mlgeon means a second appeal to the electors, and his friends affirm that he will be awUln chosen by a large majority ln spite of all the local authorities can do. If the judgment be against Eim, no one will be'1 Aurprised if the second sentence prove of a far severer kind-that, In fact, It will go to deprive Id. Imigeon of his civil rights, and, consequently, render whm incapable of filling the functions of deputy. His riends declare that in the event oi a second trial he will go all lengths, "tand," they say, " exoe with. out mercy the whole of the intrimes lset in mte tiona." A decree in the Moa t jneur dismisles the Procureuramperial of St. Etienne, no dou4bt for miseconduct in the affair connected with the abduction of the child which occurred there. The Minister of State has also written to haf. Chapuls de Montlaville, the Const itiionnel says, to express the decep displeasure of the Emperor " that a Senator should have diven the example of so great a scandal," the;aaid Senator bein3g the principal party concerned in the abduction. It Is raid that Md. Chapuis de MonlXville Intends resigning his post as Senator. The Commisary of Police of St. Etienne has also been dismised. General Piobert, of the Artllery, and a member of the Institute, has made a discovery by whioh the explosion of gunpowder in magazines may be prevented. It conilsits Implyof rnixingthe gunpowder with coal dust. When the gunpowder is required for uwe, it is only neesay to sift it; the coal dust fals through the sieve, and the gunpowder resumes its original qualities. The experiment has been tried on a large scale with complete smcces. A againe filledA with gunpowder so mixed was set on fire. N~o explosion took plac," asays the Moniwt'u dec i'Arsnte. "The gunpowde burned like other combustible matters mu,ch as pitchor tar, and the fire was extinguished with common nolumn" Subscriptions ha%e ben opened in thedeprt ment of the Loire for the relef of the unemployed operatives. A coniderable um ha been already colleted. It appears that the number of medals called MdIdailles de Saint Eine alrady distributed to those who served undor the Empir amounts to no less than 300,000.

Almost all the German "' note-Isuing banks" (Zeffel-Banken) have hitherto paid large dividends, but the Impression on my mind Is that all of them have weaky constitutions. For obvious reasons, no names can be mentioned; but 1 know that the Vienna Bank ha, by order of the Minister of Finance, saved more than one Hambug firm from falling. No les a sum than 4,000,000 marks banco was advanced to one house.

This satisfation at the excellent position of the Royal Bank, in the iidst of the general distres, is perfectly in keeping with the whole spirit of the bureaucratic polhy of Prussia, in which the ease and comfort of the State and its servants are the considerations that take precedence of everything, and the publio at Iarge is an object of hary condary consideration. It X lkept out of sight here that this diminution of 5,000,0 in bills discounted (and indeed of 7,000,000 since the end of September) Is the exact meumre of the accommodation withdrawn from the public at the very period when it required every facility to be extended to it, consistent Mith prudence; and this contraction of avalable currency iis further aggravated by an incrase of three-quarters of a million in the amount lying to the credit of plblic bodies and private perns, who have thus withdrawn sO much more than usual from circulation for the purpose of being prepared igiinst possible contingencies.

The fact, too, of many of the bankers and bill discounters having been compelled, in eonweuenoe of inns upon them, to supend all further p ayments, hs caused a stfill greater excitement among all clue'; and, so fas has this deplorable state of th'ings increased, that on Thursday a plan was proposed by some of the merchants and others on the Exchnge, tht, unless the Senate did something to re-establish publio confidence, they should all of them suspend their payments at once, in preferenoe to seeing houses absolutely forced to dO sO by does at a time, when a trifling monetary aid might have prevented the necessity. In the meanwhile the Prussian Minister, Von dier Ieyde, ancl Prince Esterhazy, have been here, it is said to consult with the Senate upon the best meras for remedying the presont difficultlie, ad to cause a speedy return of mercantile confidence; buit any. thing beyond this Is not known. There is sufflclent money in this city to meet all demands, even were they greater than they are, -were public confidence on anything like a par with the means that private parties, and even many morchants, might employ in the discount line; but nothing can prevaiupon these persons to afford any aid In the face of the failures of zuch firms as are daily appearing in the list.

In short, such is the effect of the present panic, that it is with the greatest difflculty Prussin Royal Bank notes, however small the amount, can be oexchanged for ailver; and then only by allowing 25 per cent. discount. However, the hereditary burgesse. are again assembled to recelve the proposals of the Senate for establihing a temporary State Discount Bank, with a capital of 80,000,000 - of marks banco, and to give their inmediate uanition thereto. But the burghers are generally of opinion that, as the mercantile community have been the man cauxe of bringing the difficultir upon themselves by over-speculatlon,l they ms do the best they can to get themselves out of the mess, and have no right to call upon the freeholden to pay their losses. 4 o'Cr.ooK I.-.

Although for some months of this year there seemed little in the affairs of Piedmont likely to intereet other than her own people, or to awaken the particular attention of Italian Liberals generally, the case Is decidedly different since the elections of the 15th of November; and I do not think I exaggerate when Isa that throughoult Italy men are anxously speculat-ing on the public consequences of thos elections and. eagerly awraiting the opening of the new Sardinian Parliament.

I yesterday heard talk of a respectable Genoese house tottering on account of losse sustained by the stoppage of a lIondon house; but It Is hoped that it may right itself, and, at any rate, I could not learn that this casualty, if it occurred was likely to be followed by others. The financial difficulties in Lombardy are stated to be dminshing, although the crisis cannot be considered at an end. The general state of that country is one of depression, and but for its great natural richness it would be impossible it' should long support its burdens in the face of recent bad harvests. I am assure:d that in themoat fertile and flourishingparts of Lombardo-Venetia the land-tax carries off a thirdof the average produce, while in lesa favoured districts it amounts to a great deal more, and eastwards towards Venice, ther are lands that have actually been given up by their holders because their pro. ducts wouldnot pay the impost.

- BAIL- AY ;LLIaSNO - _DOMDAY, BARODA, AC1D OBJBAL INDIA. Xne ail.hu-arly meetibg of this company was held yeaterdaysat the office, Livarpool-street, Colonel French, M.P., in thechair, Mr. Kennedy, the secretary, having read the minutes of the Lat meeting, which were confirmed, the report, an abstract of which appeed iz Thc Tmnes of yesterday, was taken as read. The CHA3RMN, in moving theadopkion of the report, congratulated the shareholders on the fact that sinoe the last meeting the Government had anthorized ther to construct the line from Surat to- Bombay. Ie d-stated on a former oCcasion that thefr line began: snowher and ended nowhere, but now- It would extend from Ahmedabad pg tbrough a district kaowu as the garden of western India, to Bombay. -The districts through which theirline would pass eontained 62,616 squae miles,tbhe population was 7,160,000, and the cottor disrict contained 2,020,060 acres. Taking theannualproduceat an average of 701b. per acre, that ditrict alone would pro. duce 141,402,0301h. of cotton, being . equal to about two. thirds of the amount of cotton exported from Indla in 1854 Nothing he thought could be morc sxtisfactory.than tbAt portion of their undertaklng. The country,.sofat as-roads were oonoerned, wasin a state otnature. He hadstatedin his evidence before a select committee that n1o People could be in vruder Ctatltian those at Baroch and Bunrat# Hei had. seen them xol the cotton down te the bohts ilntho mudatddirtand shipitinaairty and dampstate,-Therpwere ito wharves or jetties at the shippig plangp*s;o lhat before eotton could beshipped on thea.oatitcould.be conveye&by the railway down, to Bombay. The richest-producing di-. trict on their line extended from a pla4e to he north of Ahmedabad to a point about 30 miles below SurAt, towards Bombay. It was a district fully as rich as most parts of the Deecan. The country-through which the line psed ii lower Bengalwasnotby'any means so rich sathe npper part, but it was capable of.cultivation.- There were large townsi on the line at Broach, Baroda, and AhmedabPd considerableoentrep6ta .f tride, which would- be further developed by the extension of. the raihwy. On ithewhole, he thought-their affairs were niow- in a satisfactory state. The first section of - the line would be opeaed in Ma er Jurt next. The works .were progressing favoaby and hehoped, by that timde nexrt,year to be able. to may something about the tralffo on their Iibe. (Hear, hear.) Colonel HoLLND seconded the motion. - Mr.Wixmimsaid,itappeared to hinm that as thelr line would pea at right angles -to the etrem of traffict would intercept a great deal of it before it ached the coast. He wished to know whether anything had, been decided with reard to having a sepaate station at Bombay. lhe C iw said, no mention of that had been mad;e by the hon. Court, but it would no doubt be left tothe local anthoritie Theywouldprobablyhavoesepuar stion.' In reply to questions it was sttod that. the iew' shar would be isrned on the first favourable.opportunity, the first call would amount to 25 per cent..of the whole, and the time had been extended to the 18th of MarcL They had conirsated for a large amount of permaneht way, th balance in hand was being gradually reduoed, but at the end of five or six months it would be necessary to have more money in hand in ordertoproceedvjgorously.with theworks. Lieutenant-Colonel Y aKN Y, the consulfing engineer, at the requost of the meeting entered into an.. explanation res 'ctig the program of the 'work.s He belived that no railway -ndertaking would be-superlorto thelrlinesAit now Etood, jolning the wetern capital of India with a rieh andtproductive-district. With zegard to the constrctLon of the line they had adopted the principle of doing their works themselves. Thls had involved a good deal-of preliminary education before they could get into ma efficent system. The lat progres report he had received was very satisfactory. Jn the month of July last about oneeleventh part of the total amount of esrth. works between Surat and Ahniedabad was executed by their own staff. July being one of the worst monthr of the year, the result reflected great credit on- their sta The, required two years from the commenoement of the worm on any sect}on to open even the small-i portion of their line, becaue carthworks in Iudia required tie seaon. Ing of one monsoon to oonsolidate them before they could prooeed with the permanent way. But, although two yeas were required for the construction of the smaLlt portion of their line, that time was sufficient for a very lrge portlon. The whole extentof their ooneion ws for alngth of only 320 miles, but the oountry required a greater length of ine to boeconstruted. Looking to the interzeseef India and the company's system of carrying on the works, the scheme they had proposed should have been so arranged after the first year's opsratidna tha they could open the railway at the rate of 200 miles per annum. With a line of only 320 miles In length It was not to be expected, under the circumstance, they. oould open more than 100 miles per annum. When they got 100 miles ready fortraffic, the other two sections should hem such a state as to open consecutively. So important was the extension of the railway system that he trusted in future the Government of India wonld show their appreciation of it. If their com&pany had been allowed inshe first instnce to go on with the construetion of the line from Bombay onvards, as proposed, thewhole distance oouldhAve been oompleted and opened up to Delii before the present time, Had that been the case the Sepoys would not have dared to mutiny. The course which would have been most beneficial for the inteets of India would also have been most advantageous to the railway company. On ther line they had no tunnels, and after the enrthworks the most difcult works were the viaducts and bridges, masonry, & B means of improvements in Ironwork he was enabled to dlspense with a great deal of masonry, and to construct the bridges and viaducs entirely of Iron. They had sent out many of the minor bridges. The Ner. budda viaduct was in course of constraction, near London. The plan he adopted was very simple. The openings wer all 6 feet in span, formed by Warren's patent girders, and the piers consisted of a number of pieces which fitted in each other, secured in the usual way, so that piers of any required height could be eretod, or bridges of any length, from one to two or three ailes, constructed if necesary, all of the same materials, so that no mistaka could possibly occur in building them. Several of the girders of the Ner. budda bridge had been carefully tested, and the zesult had been very satisfactory. They were enabled to corntuct any class of bridge by those mean, from a single span of 60 feet to any number. With regard to their engines they were all of one class--aix wheels, four being coupled. He would not advlse any alteration in the kind of engine until after the line paid theshareholders 10 per cent. He truted they would not attempt to run the rapid trainx of Eng. land and thus reduce their dividend. He thought that twenty or twonty-five miles an hour was quato fast for a people who were now tredging along at the rate of three miles an hour. Some endeavour had been made to force them to carry their line 16 or 18 miles out of its course tojoin the Great Iudian Peninsula Ralw7ay atoalliad ith a viewr to eav 135 mules up to Bombay. He hoped their line would not be disfigured by that deviation, as the gradienta of the other line would seriously affect the profitsble working of the Baroda line, which had very easy grAdients throughout. There would be no difficulty in forming their line direct to Bombay and crosing the Bassein creek by a bridge about 1 mile in length, the waterway being only 600 feet andslowr in lt3 coun The aot of the viaducts on his plan would not be more than 60,0004 or 60,0001. per mile. (Hear, bear.) The report wa then lunanimously adopted. A voe of thankato the chairmaln and directors, including the offiicers of the oomprny, closed the proceedins RAILWAY AMALGAATIO0N. Yesterday morning a meeting of the East Lancaahire Company was held at Bury, to sanction the steps taken by [the directors, in conjunction with the Lancashire and Yorkshire, to apply for powers to amalgamate with the Blackburn Company on terms which have already appeared In %te 2Times. A resolution was agred to snctioning the proceedings without opposition. A sdmlar moeting was held at Mancheter of the Lan. cashlre and Yorkshire Company, when the proposition was so agreed to unanimously. The Blackburn Company held the meeting to take the consent of proprietors to the same agreement also at Manchester. The terms appeared to give great satifaction to both old shareholders and preference holders generally, but Mr. Derbishire, solcitor, objeoted on the ground that the preference shareholderswould lose 20per oent. of theirrnoney, and he thought the old shareholders, getting, as they would, good terms for -their property, ought to pay off the whole amountof preferenceclaims Heithdrewan amendment he had proposed to that effect, and said he should not oppose the Bil in Paliment, but he should hold himself at liberty to take any steps at law on this subject he might think right, Thnemotion for amalgamation was agreed to.

Asto the novelty, the plaintiff diclaimed tbe novelty of any pricular portion; it was only a patent for a combination. and the point to be consddered wes whether tbat combination was new. The plaintiff clcimed tour things,-the general arrangement of the machinery the applioation of a needle in combination with a shule the constructfon and use of a sliding frame, and the mode of actuating the frame and needle. If they believed that any one of these was not new they ought to fiud for the defindant.

,SMITHFIELD CLUB COATL BROW. If the members of thisclub do not discove aonie nore spacious building than the present Bakerstreet Crriage Bazaar, or else open their hearts, after the Midland Society's example, and erect a commodious exhibition-hall for themselves, the period seems theatening to arrive when either the vidtors or the aniumal must be admitted by a aystem of relayx and rotation. The present show-yard, 'improved as it has been, Is already too confined to do jurtice to the enormous display of fat stock aad implements; unable to entertain the throngs of town idghtseers with comfort, much les to afford the grazier or his customer full scope for displaying or eminig an. animal; while in the galleries there is scarce elbow-room among that impawable accumulation of mills and chaff-cutters. Yet the show is farmed out to the proprietor of the plaee for four years to come, and the club, instead of resting in their present scale of operations, are of course endeavouring to widen their influence and enlarge their prospective collectio pf anial, by invitng clases of cattle hitherto neglec*ed, and heightening the attractions of their . prize-sheet. There is ground-room enough -belonging i to the present building to admit of conuiderable enlargement, but even were this effected at great oest, the prewsre would soon again be felt n consequence of the growigg mag,nitude of the show. There is our vast Metropolitan. Cattle-market, with ample space for the erection of a nobIe exhibition-hall; and why might not the Smithfield Club prize animals be ihown simultaneously, or nearly so, with that largest and finest thow of fat beef and mutton, our " Christman market ?" The club are realy laying out for larger operations, for we are no longer to have an exhibition of the few pet breeds, with his Royal Highnes and Mr. Heath rt i Devons and Herefords, the Duke of =fEomrt, Earl Spenoer, Lord Leigh, and Mr. Stratton triumphant among the xhorthorns, hc.; bat, taking a step with the times, the list this year comprises separate classes also for the longhorns, IScotch horned, Scotch polled, Irlsh, Welsh, Norfolk or Sufiblk, and Sussex cattle, and alw.cross and mixed breeds, besddealthe usual clas for extra atock. While the Devons, Hereforda, aud ahorthorns have lour clames each, the croms breeds have three, and the other breeds two classes each, the frt three descriptions of cattle being apportioned 4051. worth of prizes and 12 silver mredals; and the others, which (excepting the cotc, Wels, rsh, and c were last year obliged to compete in a general pure-breed class), have 3151. and 17 medals for their share. At the present show we have 43 shorthorn,, 36 Hlereford;, 32 Devons, 8 cross breedf, and 57 other cattle-a total of 174, being an iucrease of 33. There are 130 sheep, or an increase of 34; and 59 pigs, or an increae of 18; making a total of 363 entries-85 more than last year. It will be remembered that last year the cattle clases were more noted for their even character and general excellence than for any marked preemninence of individual animals; the shorthorns were uncommonly fine, Mr. Stratton's cow being, perhaps, the beat animal in the yard; the Verefords, meritorious as a whole, comprised no specimens equal to some of former years; and the Devons, though well repre-.nted, surpassed previous shows rather for their substance than their beauty. On the present cocas ion there are fewer ipecmiens of extravagant fatness than we have had iu many former years, btut, instead of a few such obese marvels, there is more general exceUlence, and mot an inferior animal to be found. The Devona, as a whole, maintain their fame for beauty and quality, and have lets of the oharacteristic defect of hindquarter that was formerly universal among them. And here, as at Birmingham, compactly formed though small animals have, 1y their quality, carried the day against aize and weight. His Royal Highneas the :Prince Consort takes a first prize for a very beautiful heifer, atid a s3cond prize for a ateer rwhich, though well fed, has narrow hindquarters and is in seversl points of inferior merit to the Earl of Leicester's steer, which has been awarded the * third prize in the same class. His 1Poya1 Highness's. ox is a particularly good beat, with extraordinrily fine rounds of beef and nice quality of flesh. Mr. Y. Overrman's prizo steer is very perfect in form, very dleep, with a full breast and line head. Oaf the HEcrefords the oxen are exceedingly good, end the cows still more remarkable. Mr. Heath's prize steer has an irmensely long frame, and is well Meshed, but is a less imposing animal than has won the ame honour at former meetings. Hs Royal Highness's second prize steer is straight, compact, and heavy, but not particularly handsome. Mr. *Shaw's prize ox has a frame of great breadth, and is well covered with meat of splendid quality. The six Hereford cows exhibited here were rl1 at Birmingham, and the prize cow at that show not being here, the second now takes her place. The short-horns have come up better than at Birmingham, and both the gold medals have been won by this breed, instead of being shared as heretofore with a Hereford or a Devon. The steers or oDxen form a very fine class, comprising some wonderfully good animals. MIr. Wortley's prize ox has been justly awarded the gold medal of the show. This animal is very level, of a finely cylindrical compact shape, and beautifulpronelyicns,nand exceedingly handsome. :Eis girth is 9 feet, and length about 6 feet, indicating a welght of some 130 stone imperial; bult splendid as he is, we must say that oxen of a more noble and majestic appearance have appeared in former years. Mr. Wortley is also suoccesful In another class, taking the third prize for a cow in an extraordinarily Wone class; and it is gratifying to learn that this gentleman, a breeder as well as feeder, has never ibefore contested at Baker-street. he county of Rutland was at one timne invincible at these shows; and 'We are glad to see that its stock has in no way lost Its olden character. Mr. Baker's white heifer is of bIeautiful form and quality, and doubtless considerable dicusqsion will arise upon the correctness of the judge's decision in leaving her not only without the prize that in the opinion of many she ought to have had, but without even a commendation. Of Colonel Towneley'x unsurpassed cow, successful first at Chelmsford as a two-year old, then at Salisbury as a cow in milk, then at York, at Durham, at Birmningham, where she won the gold medal, and lastly here, where she is simnilarly victorious, we cannot speak too highly; she is a model of excellence, and all the more meritorious that she Is not too fat to display her perfect symmetry and handsomeness. 3indeed, it is a feature of the present exhibition, that the meat is in a more edible and profitable condition than has been too often the case. The Sussex breed of cattle have come up En good force, and are of better character than they have yet appeared, while all are 'val'uable, Mr. Smith's prize heifer might compete for beauty of proportion and nice quality with any Devon. The Norfolk and Suffolk polls are feebly represented. The long-horn clases comprise some 'veri favourable specimens of a breed generally too lak and big-boned. Among the Scotch cattle Mr. Goodman's ox is wonderful for his deep frame and evident strength of oonstitution The Marquis of Downshire also exhibits a good West Hghland; and the Duke of Beaufort takes a prize for his West Highland heifer. Mr. HIeath's Aberdeen Sw ;R an exceedingly good animal, and is specially notable as being the beast shown at Poissy Fat Cattle Show, and yet deprived by the authorities there of the lionoursawarded to him. The breeder of this ox being unknown, and some of the "pointa" beingsunerior to those usualy attained by thisbreed, certinzisa pointed competitors protested against the judges award, alleging that the aniaf was not of pure breed, but a cross between Scotch and Short-horn However, Mr. Heath has at last been fully acquitted of the implied charge of false certifying, and the judges at Baker-street have properly given him the first prize. Coonel Pennant's Welsh ox is very good. The cross or mixed breed make an exeellent show * and the extra stock classes are exceedingly meritoriom. The euripity of the show is a Short-horn steer in Class 10, high-standing above all other cattle, and in frame tremendous like a maimoth; but of course inferior in flesh and beauty. The pride of the sheep classes last year was Mr. Walmaey's pen of Leicesters, and the short-woolled clasEes were especially good, the Duke of Richmconds and Lord Walsiigham's Downs having been he beat shown for many years. On this occasion they poess the quality, beauty and just proportions of Â±ormeryears. We think the pecimensof rossbreeds have gained grftt6r uniformity andpreseat most admiratble outlines; as individua animals msny of them are of sulpassing beauty, such as we could Scarcely have anticipated three or four years ago. The pre-eminent breed of South Downs are as handsome and large in fme as Over, The Ieicesters are exceedingly good) aQC we saw some beautiful specimens-such beauty in countes- I nance and form is sedom seen. Mr. F6ljamrbe'sI axe nearlpefection; Lord Bernera' pen of Longwools are admirably proportioned, and pomess very hbndsome " looks." The Royal College at Ciien6eeter sent some large specimens of Cotswolds,. but Xi. Hewer's being more equal in frame tae the firit Erize. These we havebeen. led to consider the tWue ngwool. Here we find Longwoolgand Leicesters inthesamecasconstitatlngscnylongwooledbreed." The Duke of iUchmonnd Is again eminently suocesul in South Downs, carrying off the two first pris In classes 35.36, and the third prize in Class 37. The Earl of Radnor also occupies a good position in. the 35th and39th classes; LordWalsingham, Mr. Rigden, and Mr. J. Rent are the other fortunate winners. The classes of pigs comprise 40 pens of three each,. and 19 single specimens in the Extra Olass. They. constitute in number a splendid show, but by no means superior to those of former years in quality, Indeed, we have seent e pr4e .nd e t better singlespecimeps. . Th'e re , oi afew' that ste,k us as being of e xfr nord chuctar,; fiJiei in fatness or porcine beauty. yMr. -or 4'sre very superior pens, quite equalling the 'weight and correct ,proportion of our best years. Mr. Boxlez's pen deserves our shighest praise. Sir J. B. Mills showss a very good pen, as do also DÂ£r. E. h. Betts and Sir WilliamBootb, all of whom taLk prizes. The implement department has grown in extent and importance untl the number of exhibitors to more than half what it is at the Royal Agricultural Society's meetings-all our well-known makers bringiDg specimens of their invention and workmanmnanship, and trnsaciing a large amount of busines 'with a concourse of customaers from every part of the kingdom. Thus we see in their usual array below stairs the portable steam-engines and combined thrashing machines of Tuiford, Clayton and Shuttlewortk, Hornaby, Garrett; Ransomei and Sims Cambridge, Barrett anad EsalJ, and other firm. In the galleries we have an imense assortment of ever possible kind of tool mil, churn, pump, fencmg or fitting, available -n the field, farmery, or rural household,-itcluding the reapin -nachines of Croskill, Dray, and Burgess and Key ; the drills of Hornaby, Reevee, and Garret Ransome's and Howard's plou hs, Bentall's and Coleman's cultivators, Croikil s and Cambridge's clodcrashers, Busby's carts, Smith and Ashby's haynakers, Samuelson's turnipslcer, Wedlake's oatbruizer, Fry's pulper, Reevil s cheesennaking apparatus, Clayton's tile and brickmaking machinery, seed samples and specimen stals of Lawson, Skirving, Sutton, and Gibbs, and numberless articles by these and other manufacturers whose names we have not space to enumerate. We mBut not omit a mnention, however, of the Royal Dublin Society's specimens of roots, cereals, pulse, wool, and butter, contributed by various landowners and agrioulturiBto, as being remarkably interesting evidencm of the productive power of the " Siter Isle." The entire arrangements of the Show are very complete and satisfactory; but we wish the Sraithfield Club were in a poution to adopt the Binningham plan of having one five-shillPng or halfcrown day for the comfortable reeeption of visitors whose support sdesirable, and for allowing the press more than two hours in which to master the details of the show.

(Cheii) AgainI eall upon yonto tteadIn the sie of thes. men and emulate seir distinguished zerits. Bat I must not dieguise from. you that ?om will h(ave anore difficlittak toperfor_n and a far harder put tplay in India than any of those have had who have pre. eededyotr-. Hitherto, and up to the time of this feari outbreak, mutual conidenoe and goodwill hsve sxubsed between the govning race and the natives whom they governed There wi full trust on both ides, and wa know that in zany inataneahbee ha beea een affection as welo s confidence, - Bat -nore, uthappiy, that cham has bee destroyed, and for. mAny years to wome there must exis distrust and supqcion at least, if not more bitter feel. iDeg betwe those who rule and thme who form the subject body. It is impossbe it hould be otherwise after the treRaeries and the muders, and worse than murders that have bWm so fthmughout that land. But you are bound to sruggle with those feelings and subdue then. It will beyour-duty to so; for, after all, let it be remembered that it h onlyan infnitedmal pert of India that he. been engaged In thee sndalous outrage.. It is only by theepoy%, bytheAloes-relesedfrom the gpolo, by,the themo ~ithep"oethe eLsht n ya few temitorb tbi-it lta t thie dnadu mslchief, this fgbtful outrageha been committed. The pget body of the poplation, it ought to be stongly impresed oa our mainds, fror the highest chiefs to the humblest ryot., hare boon true to - the -British: Governmeht. The Raia 'of Oudespore, the highet and greatest Ripoct chief I thecounty, haxshown an unaworving fidelity. He hs protected our fugitive., he hbafedthem, and set them away with money in sfety. The Fahsajsh of Gwalior^nd-Holkarhave equallyshown their attachiment to our ule,- while many zemindarE, and nany inhutabIe life, haveproteedor fellow-countrymen. Therefore it woda be most unjust to charge treachery, rebellion,-andmarderon the wholepopulationefIndia. But ho wever that may be, itwill be your duty to struggle aganst tie natunl snupicio, and distrust whiic have been engen-dered, and-to endeavourtowintheaffections of the people over whom you have to exercise power. If we ar not able to govern India by thse means we had better atandon -the country altogether. If we are to govern India at- all we -aust - govern -it for the people of India, and in a great meaesre by their Instrumentality. I thereforecall upon you, and I desire toimpres it upon you as the last lesson you will receive on leaing these shore., tbat it Is= ounb4den duty to attempt to govern the people of b the affecIons and not by their feas (Cheers.) We-couidnotiwe wrould govern them by their fars. We camnot have a British army stationed in every prt of India- we must '.herefore govern them by their affections, and I believe, no'twithstanding all tIat has pased, tbhat tit posibleso to govern them. (Cheer,) I now turn to another subject, and that is to point out to you that you are the last representatives of this olUege and of . the system of nominatiou to the civil service in India. When yot enter upon that srvice you will -be subjected to oompetition -with gentlemen older than yourselves, many of them trained at other institutions and whoare abletosaythat they have gained their sitations by their own merit. I pray you..therefore, so to conduct -Yourselvesin thatDompetition as to do credit to the educe.tion which you have received at Elaileybury and to do no .dircredittothosewhobavenominatedyou to the service. The hn. hirnan then addresed him ellfmore especuytothoe who were about to prooeed to India, exhorting them to hold lfrnIy to the.reigous principles which had been inculcated Ln. their minds at college, and adhere to a strict observanooof the Divine precepts which they had been taught. After advising them to cultivate an uninterrupted correspondence with their relations and friends at home, which he asured them would be of great value to them In stimulating their exertions and keeping them In the path of zectitude while far removed from their native land, he bade them an affectionate farewell, again reminding them that they were going -forth to discharge an arduous duty-to work against distrus and suspicion, to concilAte the catriged affections of the people, to bind up and pour balm Into the wounds which have afflicted Indian society, and to link together once more the conqueror and the conquered. The hon. chairman then, in very feeling terms, took his leave of the Principal and Professors of the institution, bidding them a hearty and affectionate farewelL He espressed in his own name and on behalf of his colleagues their thanks and the gratitude the felt for the rvices which those rev. gentlemen ha redered to the East India Company and to the country at large. They had sent out to India most admirable representatives of the nation. They had sent out men who hd extorted from those in this country who were not very favourae to the Eat India Company, and from foreigners who were not favourable to Engl%nd herself praiaca whichlil the first instence they were unwilling to ive, and it was to the gentlemen who were then around him tbat the East India Company and the country were indebted for that result. (Cheer.) The Bishop of LosDoN.-After the address which you havo jet heard there remains very little forme to sy. The gentleman who hs addressed you is able to speak with an itimate sequaintance both of this institution and of India, but to both of which I nm altogether a stranger. My offlce begins to day and ends today. But though coming as a stranger, I am gld to find that I have been introduced to faces not unfmiliar to me elsewhere; and what I always believed has proved true, that those who con. duct themselves well in one department of learning are pretty sure to distinish themselves in other departments. Iwasglaiito find names familiar to me at Rugby and at BallioL (Cheers.) It is alwys a melncholy thin to do somiething for the last time. When you. leave this institu. tion no one else will come in vour place. WithoDt expresing any opinion as tohether it is wlie that Haileybury College should cease to exist, yet, looling back to what this inttution has done for the last 50 years, we have at least the satisfaction of knowing that it has played so Inonsiderable part during that period. It Las cerainly acquitted itself well. Withoaut referring specily to the Indian service we are entitled to say that both literatur, and sienoe are deeply indebted to this institution, - and that names which are connected with political economy, with law, and more especially with Eastern litrature, willlong keepaliveinthis country therem membranoe of what Halleybury hua done. I as a stranger may give my full testimony to the universl belief prevailIng not only in the Court of Directors, but throughout the country, that the admirable way in which those who have been educated at Hailcybur have oondu.ted themselves in India has shown that the IndianEmpire, ac a scene of opentions to men of talent, geniuS, nd energy, is theno lest thing that the world can offer. It has been -so at atimes; butatthismomentitsso more thnever. You, myyoung friends,aregolngto dlast atimewhentbeeyesofthewhole civilizedworld are fixed upon you; you have to acquit yourselves notonly In one clll dcpa~tment of the Company's servieo, but you will hav^e throwrn upon you duties that more properly belong to military life; nand, permit me to Ssay towhnich will be added somewhat of the duties of a Christian misionary. (Cheers.) You go forth at a time 'when the very_existence of the British empire in India is Imidper . That empire e must e re-Lestblfshed in its mo ct integrity, falNg In which The calue Cof elvllizsgon In that portion of the globe must fal to the -grouad. You, -thereore, go forth d at a tme when your~ country commits to - You a gret and must serious misonP. tou Wil hAve to re-establish that which for a time appear to boshaken. You wMlhave to fight In the vaniguard of civilization. In order to advance and prpare the world in the East for the coming of our Lord and Saviodr. We say, therefore, that virtually you go forth as Christian mIssonaries. This is no exaggerated expression, for it is my conviction that far nore wMl be dune 'by you in the discharg of your civil functions and in your own proper sj hue showing by your conduct that you remember you ae Christians, and that you have Chritia duties to perform, than wHil or can be done even by the more direct exertions of the devoted menc who go forth as specially professed missionaries. Ihope audtrvst thatite words you hiave heard to-day will be imnpressed deeply upon your minds, and that they ha~ve found an echo In your heartql. (Cheers.) -The company then retired to the great hall of the college, where a lunchconr had beenL prepared, and of which they were invited to partke. After doing faUl justice to the excellent Tiands placed before them, The CHAnisrA? proposed the only toast given onx these occasions ---" the health- of the Principal and Profeors of the College." The toast was drunk w'wth loud cheering, and The R1ev. the PBRireOrrL returned thanks, and said that he and his rev. frends slid colleagues woulld retire from the scene of their labotur, In the earest hope that the new them Immdiatelyreturne to tow, peaao Xnnr.-L th teegrphi smamary of A2merl. can Intelligenice bytheAai I was salted that 4[mesr.
