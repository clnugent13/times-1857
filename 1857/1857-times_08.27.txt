IPBOPOSED GBBAT ORNTRAL WEST-ExD I TBf KfNLrS. Every one klnows the di ffieut#eg experlenced in getbing t' Or from the West-end, wether by. road or raiL Temse adficulties the proposed West-endTerminusabout to be established will do away entirely. It wil purge and oceanse the dirty partg of Fiilico, relieve the msunstroas aggravation of traffic which for years hlsa made London-bridge a auisance, mako the lonely aeighbourhood of Victoria-street one of the mnost inportant sub-centres in the metropolis, wad give such faeilitios tD 'netropolitan commanication as have long been wished for, though until now without a prospeet of being realized. The plan by which all this is to be effected is so si nple, so inexpensive, and so thoroughly practicable in all its details that the marvel is howf it has egoaped the vision of railway rrojectors for so long a time. It is nothing more nor lees thrm the formation ot a Bhozb line from Battersea, running tbrough Brixton, Clapham, Dulwich, Camberwell, and the tuburbanx districts on the Surrey side of the water and oIn. ninnicaWting vwith aUL the hes of ralway going south. From Battersea it crosses the river on an iron bridge, to be bult for the purpose, and at once enters the bed of the present Grosvenor canal, along the course ot which it con. tiaues to the ventral terminus to be erected on the site of the Grosvenor basin-au immense area at the ond of Vie. torlastreet, Wfestminster, wit-hin a stone's throw of Bwk lnghhm Palace and Grosvenor-place, a quarter of a mile of the Houses of Parliament, and less than a thousand yards from Charing-cross. tt is alwaya xa% ci5fuit to describe intended bualding plans on a large scale, but such of our readers as are unable to appreciate the advantagges of the scheme from this verbal report will be enabled to do so fully by a. isutaut!s reference to the map of London. The short suburban line which we have mentioned Is intended to run round the south of the mnetropolis, will communicate with the lines to Brighton, Dover, the Crystal Palace, the main l2ne of the South-Waestern, the Croydon, Epsom, Kid-Kent, and Nortl Kentin fact, with all the London railways on the Surrey PAde of the Thacns. Thie amount of suburban pas. seDger traffic by this line is estimated as being of itself slfficient to justify its immredito forma. tion, and the peculiar s adutages -which it must derive from being in connexion with all the other main routes are sufficiently apparent. To accommodate the expected Increase the whole of this line will be laid down tor four pairs of rails. Prom Brixton the line will approach the river along the eastern boundary of the new park at Battersea, passing above the Crystal Pale Sloane-street staton. The bridge portion of the lndertaking wfll be the only one prerenting any features of engineering interest or difliculty along the entlre route. It wiU run parallel with tho handtome new suepeusin Btoidse a Dater, but only about a quarter of a mile distant from it on the London side. In consequence of this rather near proximity to what will undoubtedly be one of te haindsomest bridag about the metropoli objections may be offered on the part of the Government, who may stipulatethat the span of the centre arch of the railway bridge shall equal that at the sfUpension. This would require an iron arch of nlearly 400 feet span-a rather important engineering work, though nothlug when compared with the oolossal ttbular bridge 'which csossea at arm of the sea at more than 200 feet above -*tssurfaca. The promoters of the scheme are, however, quite prepared if neceesary to make the ceatre arch of any breadth of span. which the Goverrnnent may fix. The bridge will run direct to the entrance of the Grosvenor-canal. As even among the best-informed of our readers there may be some not thoroughly acquaited vith. the topography of ths staRnant channel, we may mention that its entrance from the Thames is on the Middlesex side, about a quasrter of a mUe or so from the new bridge, and thence it runs in a almost straight line through the shabby parts of Pimlico, terminating in the Grosvenor-basin, a deep and extensive dock near the end of Nevr Victoria. treet. Itt aSMAdeb 'sthe Marquis of Wetminster, wh7se consent It vas, of course, necessary to obtain before the canal could be converted into a route for a railway. As however, the canal hae be by no means a lucrative investment, his Lordship at once consented to the proposal, merely requiring to be assured that neither he nor his property would btiwinred by the intended change ThFis was, of course, satisfet,orily demonstrated, and hix Lordship gave a lease of the property for 999 years, stipulating for nothing more than the preeent rental of the cauaL -a by no meanabovy smm. Ths great liberality on the part of the Mlarquis removed the only bar which could have been placd on the success of the plan, and, accordingly, since that tine the whole uNelrtaling has beent earefully imatured, and has advanced the necessary stages towards obtaining a Bill from the Legisture next seadon. The canad presents almost nequalldec, feilitles for carry ingolut ,the- plans in the most effective and cheap mannor The operation will be broughlt about W 6penITz itie ro0 gates, letting out the water, and filling in the bed and basin 'ith dry rubbish, till the whole is raised to the " low level's on which it is intended that the line shall be laid. No vaulting Is required; no oxpensive property has to be purchased, or engineering dicuities to be overcome. The line thus made will terminate at the Central station, on the site of the bain of the canal. If this station is finished as intended, it will undoubtedly be one of the finet and rtoat capacious buildings of its kind in existence. The area the basin affords is seven times greater than thAt of the station at London-bridge, and nearly five times larger than the whole extent of the Great Western terminus at Paddington In addition to this large space the promnoters have alrady secured no less than 40 acres of ground round the basin, ," asto admit, if necessary, oi the terminus being extended to more thau twice ita at present proposed size. There will be mnore than sufficient space in all for every line south of the Thames. For tha aooomnodation of these there will be 16 departure and six arrival platforms. Only a smal nuntber of the latter is requisite, for an ariving train is empty in a few mninutes, while those starting h%ve generally to occupy the platform nearly half-an-hour. Each platform, as belong-Ing to a distinct line, vwill hsve its own booking and luggage office in the general buildingg of the terminus. The roofing of the space set apart for the actual arrival and departure of trains will of course he glas and iron, and upwards of 1,400 feet long by 500 feet wlde,another Crystal Palce in its way, 'Tbe general plan of the whole terminus will be that of a huge quadrangle. The exterior thus forms a noble range of buildings, and which, judging from the desi3gs already prepared, will prove a* valuable addition to our not very large stock of ornamental awhitecture in London. The style wvAI be Gothic, and the front elevation in its general features is not unlike the tex. rae front of the new Iouses of Parliaraeut though, of conre, less florid and expensive In detaiL This portion will be expreesly built for an extensive hotel-an hotel sufficient, if raedeib, to shelter all the multitudinous visltors who daily flook up to London from the south of England. The courtyard in the interior of the quadrangle will be 350 feet long by 150 wide, and ela roofed in 'with glass and iron Into the centra of this passengers will drive on coming to start per train, and aU the various entrances Into the terminus beyond will he marked with the names of the limes to the platforms of which they lead. Thus the intending traveller drives at once to his point of departure-Gosport or Windsor, Brighton or Gravesend, alisbuxy or )Devonport, as the case may bo. In these few remarks we have, of course, merely given the "heads" of the scheme, but enough, we think to show beth it importsace And great utility. The extent of the letter, in fact, can swarcely be overrated, for, in addition to the West-end and the sooth side, nearly onse. half of the northern division of London will alSO be a#COmnsodated. . glace at the msp will show our readers a few of the routes which the weary passengers from Bayawater, Paddington, or Camden-hill must traverse are the Brighton, Waterloo, or Crystal Palac statio can be reached; and none can. doultt the iofunnt of tho ehange, which may be sid to make Charing-crost the oommon mnte It is, In ahort, the first great step towards making our unwieldy, ovrgrown metropols, mana ble with regad t distanoes, and diminishing the in.odinut, taffic through some ol out most crowded routes. The idea itself is a grand and comprebeNsive one, and, as far as it has gone, i has ben wel and carefully planned. For the rest, we can only hope that mob. success may eteud, It it a n cheme e conducive to the public benefit and accommodation really deserves.

TOR RECRaIIING SYSTZM. TIO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Having lately observed a notice issued, lowerlng the standard of recruits for the Line by half sn inch, I think it well to draw the attention of the public through your widely circulated columns to the very gradual reduction wbloh is pursued at a tine when great anxiety to obtain reornits quickly prevails, The consequence of this is the loSu of many good soldiers. During the late war in the Crimea the standard for recruits was reduced by half Inchesto5ft. 4in. Whyis not5ft. 4in. named at once on an emergency like the present ? I was on the recruiting service during the late war, and oblged to reject numbers of strong useful young men, as they were not quite the height then ordered-say, 5 ft. 6 in.-a the regulations on this head were Tery strict. In three months or less the required standard had become 6ft. 4 in. Where were all my rejected recruits and those of other offioers under similar circumstances. Gone, and most prohably lost to the service, The same occurred before the standard was lowered to 5 ft. 4in. In ride regiments men are not permitted to be enlisted over 5 ft. 8. in., and no injury wil bo done to the efficiency of our army by allowing 5 ft. 4in. men to join the ranks, until the numbers required to complete have been obtained. I have the honour to be. SIr. &e.. A 1ETIRBD OFFICER

LONDON, THURSDAY, A UGUST 27,18557. The Bombay mail arrived at Suez six days after the arrival of that from Calcutta, and brings usnewsfromDelhi down to the 14th of July. At that date, it appears, we were Atill waiting for reinforcements, as, owing to the extent of our own poBitions to be protected, no more than 2,000 Europeans could be spared for an effective attack on the city. On the scale of the calculations made in the not very different case of Sebastopol, this would not necessarily imply a less aggregate than 7,000 Europeans in the camp, the last estimate reported. The death of Sir H. BARNARD took place on the 5th, so that his successor, General REm, had been nine days in cormand at the last date. The garrison of Lucknow, in the words of the despatch, was " still " holding out," after the loss of its lamented Commandant on the 4th. The report of General AEvLmoc¶'s successes is confirmed. With his flying brigade of 2,000 Europeans he ihad achieved three brilliant victories over the rebels, and driven them away from the extensive positions they were lately occupying round Sir,HuGHWBmELE at Cawnpore, capturing from them 26 gunm. They are the very men who, under the miscreant NENA SAHIB, perpetrated that horrible massacre of European women and children caught in their passage down the Ganges, and it is a good omen for ear cause that they are the first victims of a just retribution. These sBccesses have been obtained with little loss on our side. On the other hand, the report from Agra looks ill, though not very explicable. The garrison is said to have fought the Neemuch mutineers on the 5th of July, with the loss of 49 killed and 92 wounlded, out of a total force of 500. At the last previous date there were few Europeans at Agra, and we are left to conjecture what were the component parts of this force. We have, then, to ask under what necessity so small a body took the initiative. But the most remarkable feature in the statement is, that Neemuch is 300 miles from Agra. This is a much longer march than any other of the mutineers have yet accomplished, as they seem generally to have gone no further than the first city that gave them shelter, or the first district they could ravage with impunity. It happens, also, to be in precisely the contrary direction of the last march of the sort mentioned, which was that of the Gwalior Contingent in the direction of Indore, though agreeing with the report of the Indore mutineers marching to Delhi. If all these reports are correct, there is at least a want of plan in the movements of the mutineers. " Several massacres have taken place in the North" Western Provinces." This may or may not mean more detailed accounts of the calamities already reported. "1 The Bombay and Madras Presidencies were "perfectly tranquil, and their armies remained "loyal." This is now our chief hope, for so long as the mutiny is confined to its present range every day will place it more under command. The Punjab was quiet, excepting that some cavalry and infantry of the Bengal Army stationed at Sealcote, on the Chenab, about sixty miles north-east of Lahore, foilowed the example of their comrades, and marched off towards Delhi, thinking that probably a safer course than to remain among the Sikhs. They were, however, attacked on the 12th of July by Brigadier NICHOLsON, and driven back with 200 killed and wounded, leaving their baggage and plunder in our hands. This shows what can be done by promptness, and how much easier these spoilt Indian Mamelukes, whom we have petted to our cost, find it to massacre and to plunder than to fight Europeans in the open field. The retribution was inflicted with the loss of only 6 kdlled and 25 wounded on our part. As the mutineera were driven back with the loss of their baggage, andu as the attempted march to Delhi is near 400 miles over a sandy desert, and other obstructions, besides that the Panjab is not exactly the place for an outcast and destitute Hindoo to find himrelf at home in, we may expect some further account of these gentlemen. A rising took place at Hyderabad on the 18th, probably under similar circumstances, lout was quickly suppressed. Here again, then, we have to repeat, what was observable on the face of the last despatch, that the only two pleces of bad news are the deaths of the two ConeraLs. The loss of Sir H. LAWnmoE is indeeda misfortune which it is hardly possible to over-estimate. We exclude the report about Agra, for the present, from the dark side of the picture, for we must confess ourselves unaole to underatand it. Besides the distance of Neemuch, and the little inducement a mall force at Agra would have to unnecessary enterprises, it will be remembered that the telegraphic abridgment of the Calcutta mail which reports the death of Sir H. BARNARD at Delhi on the 5th states particularly that Agra was all quiet and that the native troops had been disarmed. This is scarcely compatible with the fact of a disastrous conffict with mutineers on the 5th, for at Calcutta, if they had news of Delhi up to that date, they must have had still later news of Agra. As both the Calcutta and Bombay mails must arrive in two or tbree days, we shall not bave to speculate long on this mysterious piece of intelligence. The calculations of the force necessary for an on the folly of maintaining large fortified towns. With what viewv were the fortifications of a city containing 200,000 bigoted enemies of the British rule, with six miles of circuit, carefaully repaired and strengthened with bastions, dikes, and martello towers? There can be no doubt that 2,000 British eoldiers could soon effect a lodgment on the ramparts, but they would be lost in the city, which is probably every day adding to its internal defences, at the cost of the peaceable and more wealthy inhabitants. A place of this sort requires a large army both to take it and to hold it; and in our position we have both to take it and to hold it, Ior we have to occupy the city and maintain a good position outside at the same tine. The British army has to get into the city and protect its camp outside tiU the process is complete. It is, however, the old delusion of warmongers, and their judicial blindness, always to be supposing one enemy and one species or warfare. No doubt, the anticipated foe was a foreign one, advancing from the north-west, and it was takea for granted that a common sense of danger would unite against him the British and the native soldier. This unanimity was indispensable, for it now appears that Delhi must fall to the more nusmerous host, and tihere would never be such a force of British soldiers there as to dispense with native aid. But, granting the necessity of a large arsenal and dep6t, there certainly was no need why we should encumber ourselves with the protection of 200,000 civilians, who would never be of any use, and were always ready to turn against us. Of course, when we have taken the city we shall know what to do with it, but we shall acquire that knowledge at a rather disproportionate cost.
The reasons for maintainng a large army at the Cape are intelligible, if not satisfactory. The Governor naturally wishes to make his administration popular, and he knows that the local estimate of his character will be in some degree proportionate to the number of regiments at his disposaL The colonists entertain no old-fashioied objections to a standing army. If the present garrison of 15,000 men were strengthened by the addition of the Guards and of the Household Cavalry the newcomers would receive a hearty welcome. No vulgar jealousies of race or language interrupt the general favour accorded to the army. The German LIegionaries, who were sent out as settlers, are still doing duty as s4&iers, with the general approbation of the inhabitants. It would seem that the danger of a Caffre invasion can no longer disturb the most timid alarmist. The contingency of a frontier war is, in fact, not so much a c&use of dread to the people of the Cape as a part of their common stock-in-trade. If there were no warlike savages in the interior there would be no excuse for troops to keep them in check; and with the military establishment would disappear the corresponding expenditure from the Imperial Treasury. The exploded doctrine of the balance of trade still holds good for some of our colonies. The produce of the Cape, consisting of hides, of good wool, and of bad wine, may serve to pay for the hardware and cotton goodc which are required for consumption; but the most profitable import consists in remittances for the service of the army. The colonists might be willing on occasion to fight for their own property, but they naturally prefer to be fought for by a numerous body of liberal customers. Wherever an Engliah force is stationed all markets rise, and it is not unlikely that even Cape Madeira may find a ready sale among the soldiers. Sir DE LAcy EvArs lately observed that as far as England was concerned a peace maintained at so considerable an outlay was scarcely preferable to war; but it is not surprising that colonial opinion should be favourable to a system which combines the profits derived from a large military establishment with the security of peace. The Cape Parliament will probably watch with some jealousy the Governor's measures for civilizing the frontier tribes, lest by removing all pretext for military demonstration he should eventually kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. It is, in fact, scarcely probable that the present happy condition of things should long continue. The mother country has not yet lost the habit of bribing the colonies to be loyal, although modern legislation has given them the entire direction of their own affairs. The people of the Cape have their Parliament, their Public Lands, and their Budget. Even before the grant of their present constitution they successfully refused to admit a shipload of convicls who were sent to them in conformity with the existing law. As long as they abstain from a formal declaration of independence they enjoy all the liberty which a Sovereign State could desire. With the Imperial Government they are only connected by the golden link of the CRowN, not to mention other lnks which may 'oe called golden in a sense less metaphorical. Sir Guon11G GuRz's zealous furtherance of the policy which is so popular in the colony may under present circumstances be found productive of considerable advantage. Oriental despots have always seen with pleasure the success of their viceroys in amassing wealth, looking forward to the future time of confiscation when the sponge is ready for squeezing. The regiments which have beea assembled to guard against an imaginary Caffre war will furnish seasonable reinforcements to the army in India. UTnfortunately, the mild Vizier who presides at the Colonial-office has only demanded an insignificant detachment from the Governor, but Lord ErxiixsToNE has, with praiseworthy readiness, taken upon himself the responsibility of sending to the Cape both a requisition for troops and a flotilla of transports to convey them. The demand will be enforced by the not inconsiderable authority of the Commander-in-Chief at Bombay. That functionary has recently shown an insufficient knowledge of Indian character, but no officer in the army more thoroughly understands the real necessities of the Cape. A residence of twenty years on the Caffre frontier, varied by all possible relations of war and of peace with the border tribes, may fairly entitle Sir H. Soassar to attention when he affirms that the wants of India are paramount to those of the colony. The fact that a reserve is ready at the Cape will suppress all disposition to criticize with severity any apparent inconsistency in Mr. LABoumne's successive statements. It would otherwise be difficult to understuad why the supposed danger of Caffre inroads should have disappe-ed precisely at the moment when the troopa were wanted elsewhere. The Minister " entertains no I" doubt that Sir GEoRxc. GRnz wll send to "India as large a force as he can spa, con|"istently with the preservation of the peace and "tranquillity of the Cape." Already an unconditional order has been sent for the despatch of two regiments, an& the country will somewhat more than share in the disappointment of the Governmext " if Sir G. GarY does not do all in " his power to amist the Indian Government in " this emergency." It may be hoped that the withdrawal of at least one-third of the colonial garrison will prove to be compatible with the maintenance of tranquillity. The residue will be usful as a reserve to make good the inevitable wear and tear of service. Even the Grerman Legion, which has been so unaccountably kept on foot, may be useful, as releasing English regiments. After the termination of the crisis there will be time to inquire whether the force which suffices for the Cape during an Indian mutiny becomes incapable to Zlefend the colony on the return of pea,t. Mr. LABOUCHaRE states, probably with good reason, that troops acclimatized at the Cape are peculiarly adapted to Indian service. It is gratifying to find that the maintenance of an army for the profit of the colony turns out in a mauner quite unexpected to be useful to the mother country. Englishmen are accustomed to find that their successes are attributable to fortune, and they willingly cast a good deal of bread on the waters, in the hope of finding some of it after many days. It would certainly seera that an empire which girdles the globe with military posts ought to enjoy some strategic advantages in return for an enormous outlay. The Mediterranean garrisons, the positions in the Perian Gulf, the Cape, Mauritius, and Ceylon are all stages on the different roads to India, and consequently a large force is at all timaes far on its way towards the seat of war where it is now required. NArOmLoN, in similar circumstances, would have rejoiced in the opportunity of moving his reinforcements forward like chessmen, each to a position somewhat in advance. The British islands form the ultimate depOt fromwhich all the deficiencies in the various positions must be supplied. It is abstird to regard all our scattered possessions as isolated fortresses, capable only of providing each for its own defence. The Executive Government must take care that in a great emergency all the available forces are concentrated at the seat of war. No nnnecessary discretion ought to be vested in Colonial Governors, who may exaggerate their own local wants. It happens that the whole responsibility of increasing the army, as well as of distributing it, falls at this mioment on the Ministry. The House of Commons, -whichwould wilingly have granted any supplies which might have been necessary, is about to separate without even being asked for any considerable vote. The transfer of a large number of regiments to the charge of the Indian establishment has left a great part of the sums voted for thfe army at the disposal of the Government. The announcement of the proposed addcitions to the forces at home will be received with general satisfaction; but the expense which is cheerfully borne for the preservation of India will be reasonably grudged if it is applied to keeping imaginary Caffre invaders in fear and actual colonists in goodhiumour.
The appeal to the generosity of the public made at the Mansion-house on Tuesday does not require a word to support it. The case speaks for itself so loudly that anything said in formal recommendation of it would be like a feeble whisper when a trumpet was sounding. Numbers will rejoice in the opportunity of contributing to the relief of the Indian sufierers, simply as a vent to their feelings of horror and indignation at the outrages which have been committed. Such feelings want a vent when they have been once roused, and this is the very best that could have been provided for them. It will be a way of expressing ourselves which will go further than the mere act of expression. What relieves the public will benefit the stfferer, and the act will have the good effect at the same time of withdrawing our eyes from the scene of horror anrd preventing us from dwelling too much upon it It is, indeed, remarkable how very soon the offices of mercy, kindliness, and love come in to soothe the painful impressions which war produces. The field of carnage is immediately followed by the attentions of the hospital and nurse, by thoughts for the fi3miiez of the alaiu, cAlculations of what they will want, consultations about meat, drink, and lodging, subscriptions and all the consolatory bustle a, -1 business of charity. It is right it should be so; it is the order of nature and PRovrnDzNc. It is not meant thatwe should think for ever of the very worst passages of a public calamity, upon the field of slaughter, and upon the groans of the wounded and dying. It is surprising how very soon in the -very worst events of this kind other duties and offices come in to soften the effect of the firt blow, how soon the pleasing and cheering activities of benevolence relieve and occupy the mind of the sympathetic public, supplying material for discussion, plans to be compared, persons to be talked of, letters from this place and fromx that. We are thus made almost to forget war and its horrors in the neighbourly cares which are the fruits of them, and are immersed in an instant in an almost domestic sphere of thought, in talk about food and dress, in the work a-nd contrivance and consultations and gossip of charity. The appeal, then, from the Mansion-house has come at the proper time. The cruelty of the false soldier, his treachery, his vindictiveness, his coarse passions, should not arrest our attention so deeply as that we should not be abWe at the proper time to shake off the horrible picture, and turn to the business-like and charitable view of the case. The scene of horror ought to be dwelt uDon long enough to affect us deeply and give us the feelings we ought to have; but, when we have the feelings, we should not waste them and let them die away without any result. We have been horrified now by Indian accounts for some weeks. There comes now to our relief, and to prevent us from being absorbed in the mere frightfulness of this picture, an appeal to charity. Something must be done for these poor sufferers, who are many of! them in the greatest extremities of want. They are arriving in crowds at Calcutta, with hardly any clothing upon their backs. Women and children had to be hurried off in a moment from the attack of fire and sword, before they could collect even what little portable property they had. The GovnsuoR-GBNzAL and Lady CAxNsIG are indefatigable in their attentions to the distressed, subscriptions are opened at Calcutta and Lahore, and the services of the chaplains of the hill stations and other cities of refuge are enlisted for the purpose of supplying the names and families of distressed persons, and the amount of loss sustained. It is true that a great deal of the burden of compensation in these cases will faU upon the India Company, and we are told that 30 widows are already added to the overburdened Bengal Military Fuhfd. We may be sure, of course, that all cases which fall within the law of public compensation will be met by the Company's pure; but at a time like the present one, when a great deal of property is destroyed in a moment, there must be cases of loss which do not fall exactly within the terms of any public law of compensation. Indeed, every"body knows the trammels under which legal com- pensation moves, and from which it cannot afford I altogether to relieve itself, even in such ex- i Iremities as the present. Public justice moves in | ertain grooves, and has not pliancy and flexibility |nough to meet all the ins and outs and different turns of such a complication of claims as a sudden (onvulsion like this produces. A considerable (las of sufferers lies moreover outside of the Company altogether-the tradespeople and shopkeepers of the up-country stations. The indigo factories, too, have added maany to the list of destitute fugitives. The English name has been for the last few years associated with suffering. There was the great suffering in the Crimea, and now there is Ithe great suffering in India, Without imposing any unusual task upon public sympathy, we may, perhaps, remind persons of a certain feeling which rises up naturally, we think, in most minds Iupon hearing of great troubles from which we are whoLly removed ouraelves. It is no reptach to us English people who stay at hose, and do not leave our native shore3, that we have been in England, and not in ludia, all this sad time. We are pursuing ourlawful calings in our own streets, warehouses, offioes, marts, and courts of justice. Other people go to India to fight the great battle of life in another hemisphere, and gather the golden honours of the East amid the toll ana sweat of a tropical clime. We must all, we sup. pose, take the rik of our respective choices. Nevertheless, whenever we hear of any great destraction anywhere, let it be a fire, an earthquake, a tempeat, the plague, or a matiny, the idea does, we believe, rise up spontaneously in almost every mind of the contrast between our own security at home and the fate of the unfortunate travellers3 or sojourners at a distance. It may be a libel to describe uzs as "gentlemen of England who live " at home at ease," for we have not a particularly easy life of it after all; we most of us have to worlk rather hard, and pay for what we get by the sweat of our brows. Yet it mnust be admitted that, on the whole, England is safer than the Crimea or Hindoetan. We have the advantage of our military or civil service friend so far. If we have, then, as a matter of fact, so far a certain sense of good fortune as stayers at home and residents in good old England, let us express our gratitude by proper sympathy with the misfortunes of our distant countrymen when they come before us. Their exile has, indeed, been a self-chosen one, but they have, at any rate, chosen a more perilous field than we have, and we should regard them as the comminsioned guardians of our empire, and so far as doing work for us. When a sudden fate overwhelms them, then, at their perilous posts, the liberality of our assistance to them should show the gratitude we feel for our own comparative security and safety.
What is the subject upon which at this moment the greatest interest is felt by the population of these islands ? What wish with reference to public affairs has been most universally expressed during the last two months? These questions can be answered without a minute's hesitation. If there is one ardent and albsorbing desire pervading the whole nation just now it is the desire to know what is passing in India,-to know it from day to day, without uncertainty in the intelligence or suspene in the conmunication,-to feel that we are omitting no exertions through ignorance and losing no opportunities through delay. Nor does the occasion, momentous as it is, appeal to public spirit only. Private affections are extensively iuvolved in the matter, and the fate of our countrymen, for whose safety prayers are put up in our churches, furishes a subject of unceasing anxiety to thousands of households throughout the kingdom. If by these observations we have quicke-ned the emotions of our readers we have something in reserve for their satisfaction. To be as brief as possible on such a point, we simply state that there are persons now prepared at a very stmlsl expense, in a very short time, and by methods which seem palpably practicable, to bring India into such connexion wtth England that 1 whatever is known one day in Calcutta may be known that day week in London. Of course, the agency is that of the Telegraph; there is nothing new in the principle, but there is something very striking in the coincidence by which the facilities in question have been created. At the south-eastern corner of the Mediterranean basin lies the port of Alexandria. From Suez, at the opposite side of the narrow isthmus which cbiniects Africa with Asia, to Aden, ollr own settlement, at the outlet of the Red Sea, the distance is less than 1,500 miles; from Aden to Kurrachee-the most convenient port of Indiathe mileage is about the same; so that the space to be traversed between Alexandria, a point almost at our door, and Kurrachee, a town standing on the Indus itself, assaumes no very considerable proportions, and is besides divided admirably for the purposes in view. But thousands of miles of cable are not to be had at a moment's notice ? As it happens, they are. The Atlantic Telegraph Company, in the exercise of their discretion, have decided on not immediately renewing the attempt to eomnect England wiith the United States, and their cable is disposable for a similar enterprise in another direction. We said the cost would be small. The fact will be admitted when we state that 300,0001.--little more than the amount of which a single railway company was robbed by a single servant-will link Alexandria with Aden. The connexion of Aden with Kurrachee will be more costly by 100,0001.; but 700,0001. would complete the business; and so plain are the prospect, and so confident the projectors, that London, it is distinctly averred, could be brought within a week's distance of Calcutta almost as soon as the troops now leaving these shores will arrive before Delhi. To speak more precisely to the point, we are assured that this most desirable communication can be actullay established before the end of the present year. What hinders, then? Not money, when 400 times the amount has been spent upon British railways only. Not money, when a million could be raised for almost any scheme imaginable. Season the morsel properly to commercial palates, and men are found rolling in riches up to their chins. But, though your tare British merchant will give, spend, or even squander without scruple as appeals arise to his sympathies or his tastes, he will not make an unpromising investment or hazard a single shilling against the maxims of trade. Business is business. Ask him for a gift of a thousand pounds, and you may get it ; but recommend him to stake 101. in a bad speculation, and he flatly refuses. Now, the Indian Telegraph as a mere commercial project has not a sufficiency of attraction. India itself is unsettled, and the greater the necessity for the coumnunication the less would be the inclination to the investment; besides wi, our greatest telegraphic enterprise has just this mement been suspended. So on 'Change it might reasonably enough be questioned whether the Indian Telegraph in itself promised that amount and certainty of remuneration which would command the capital requir -min other words, notwithstanding the extraordinary popularity and eminent utility of the design, it might not as a commercial undertaking find the necesary support. Announce it as an impending fct, and no, words can be strong enough to paint thes univaxaal- at-i factCon; introduce-it as s.businepa esp tion, and the question is, 'what 'will it pay-per cent. I The oldmethod of meetingtheseexeptionalecse is, of course, a guarantee,--.s proceeding by which certain governing authorities supply through their own xureties that certaintywhich the entere itsef does not seere to carry. Is it worth while to give this guarantee under present circumstances? Let the reader recall a few facts to his mnind, and consider. The outbreak which disclosed the tre character of the Indian Mutinies occurred on the 10th of May, and the gravity and extent of the emergency were developed by the two successive mails. Not till the end of July did we fully learn that the apparent insubordination of hslf-a-dozen regiments meant the desperate mutiny of an entire army, and that in the struggle before was really represented, not the correction of a r6fractory battalion or two, but the grapple of an enormous, though disorganized, host with'tne tw but courageous supporters of Gevermea)t ,d order. Now, if an Indian Telegraph bad b#sp ix. operation we hould have beo saved l, or early aU,oursuosivestagesof mnionceptiwiau .jhj have done at fist what we did l. We with despatching four or five regiments to ludis whereas the demand has aredy Asorbed betweem 20 and 30. To oompres the whole cae intoh alt-x dozen words, these mutinies have beenmatedas threatening a cost of some 20,000,000. ; aad coull any investment be more promising tih the Aplie. eation of les than a twentieth part of tf5swsnx to the establishment of such a communication *s might most materiaUy modify the expenditure of the whole ? As we have made up our mindeto vindicate our position in India by the abwslute reasertion of our supremacy, the whole ustion is pa.Lfly a question of time; and time zaved is money saved, here as everywhere. The rexbor.ar tion of order in a siagle province of BeA9I through the agency of this Telegraph a month ooner than would otherwise have been tfe case would go far towards a reimburseiet of the whole outlay; indeed, the money might pouibly have been saved at once in a sigle lump if these means of despatch had etuabled us t6 pratect the Indian treasuries from plunder. .3veit then we have hardly stated the matter with sit ficient force, for after the arrival of ewOrcMMi has secured the communications between De1 a3i Calcutta, and after Alexandria ha bseconnectodj as it might readiy be, -with Condstnnople Q1Malta, there is no reaon why 24,hours should no'. suffice to put us in posession of every event on the banks of the Onugee. If we ask our *esde to contrast such a position with the incidests of delay and suspense now experiened we shall have sid, we are sure, quite enough to commend to public attention the project of the Telegraph 1t India.

SECOND EDITION. THB TIMIBS-OFFISCE, Thursday Mcrning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following Is the letter of our Pariz correspondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), 6 p.m. : The incident that had arisen with respet to the Moldavian elections was of course ended by the Porte's compliance with the wishes of the four Powers-a fact confirmed by the last despatches received, which further add that AL de Thomvenel is to pay an official visit to the Sultan to-morrow, and that diplomatic relations wiU be at once resumed. It was expected at Constantinople that the -new Ministry would be constituted by the end of the present week. The conduct of Lord Stratford and Baron Prokesch, in abstaining from joining the other Ambassadors in their representation to the Sultan, is now the only point of the affair possessing interest and requiring expla nation. That want of unanimity, concerning which the Paris papers are not sparing of comment, does not appear to be here dwelt upon or taken up in any unfriendly spirit towards England. Ib is plainly seen and well known that Lord Stratford is the cause of the hiteh; and people generally have left off being surprised at anything h. does. They do inveigh against and wonder at his Government retaining the services of so troublesome and turbulent a personage. The censure of foreigners, however, is not to be invariably advanced ans a sound motive for the removal of an ambassador, Eince he may very often incur it by doing good service to his country. Lord Stratford has so many enemies at hoome as well as abroad, and he has so repeatedly been the cause of trouble to his Government, hesides having on at least one recent and well-known occasion incurred its severe disapproval, that one is led to the inevitable conclusion that he has been so long maintained where he is only on account of his possession of certain raluable qualities and high qualifcations for the post. It is presumable that we shall know something, before long, concerning the reasons he held to justify his recent disobedience of orders. TheD6bals has a xecond long article on the Indian mutiny. It commences by maintaining that the movement is in no degree to be considered national, since the immense population of our Indian possessions is not a nation, but a heterogeneous a3semblage of different races, speaking many tongues, professing various religions, differing as widely in their customs and ideas as they do in colour and physical characteristics. Such a collection of human beings has none of the attributes of nationality, and the writer in the Dibats in&ists that patriotism is a sontimer.t unknown to them. To the possible allegation that misgovernment and oppression have drivea the motley population to joia and rise against a common tyrant, he replies that, whatever the faults and imperfections of the Company's government, every impartial man must acknowledge that it is incomparably the mildest and justest, the most enlightened and the best, that the Indians have ever known. Moreover, had discontent prevailed, it would have manifested itself by murmurs and complaints, perhaps by local disorders, before it broke out in the form of a miltary insurrection; there would be some banner, some war-cry, indicating the cause of offence; somothing better and more valid than the paltry story of the greased cartridges, which it is now pretty evident was a mere pretext. Moreover, the innumerable lettes rooeaved from India agXoe -in -doaerb 4ko in habitants as taking no share in the proceedings of the revolted soldiery-excepting, of course, the thieves, murderers, and evil-doers of aUl kinds that are to be found in every country. And In how many cases have the people fed, clothed, and protected the unhappy fugitives, flying before the bloody hana of the ferocious Sepoy. The Debats comes to the conclusion that the revolt is purely military, but, while venturing on some reflections and conjectures, it declares itself incompetent to decide what were the incentives to it. The article concludes as follows:- "1 The Sepoy complains of no particular hardship; he has revolted In 50 different places without naming any other grievance than that of the greased cartiidges, which isnota grievance, for he has not hesAtated to make mse of them against his former employers. He entered the service by voluntary engagement, and in India admission into the army was sought after with the same eagerness as Government sitations in France. He received a pay which ren. dered him nearly opulent, and, in fact, he was more liberally treated and paid than any other soldier in the world. These circumstances have not prevented him from conspiring. But, if we are asked how this conspiracy was organized without ever being detected by the authorities, we must admit our ignorance. Ths is6 a question to which none, we believe, can reply, and which will not be solved for many a day to come." The Minister of Marine has announced to the maritime prefects that Admiral Prince Adalbert of Prussia will visit the French seaports in the month of September. Nothing new has reached us to-day with respect to the dispute between Sardinia and Naples. The Emperor was shooting at St. Germains yesterday. On Friday he will be at Rambouillet. On Saturday he is expected to leave for ChAlons and Luneville. It is believed that he wiUl remain a month a' the former place. M. Fould accompanied him on Sunday to the fete in the Landes, and then left for Mont de Marsan and Tarbes. M. de Rayneval has asked art audience of the Emperor, to beg to be kept at Rome instead of going to Berlin. The return of Maria Christina to Spain, which was believed to be close at hand, is provisionally adjourned. Possibly she wishes to see the effect produced by her manifesto, shortly to appear.

Tho Emperor left this yesterday, at half-past 12 o'clock, en route for Paris, i.nda telegraphic despatch received this afternoonainnounces that he hs avready arrived there. On taking leave of the authorities at the railway terminus His Majesty said 4jusqu'd C'annoe procaine." One of the gentlemen in attendance expressed his surprise and regret that the Emperors stay should be so brief in this part of the country, and his hopes that His Majesty would return during the autumn, were it but for a Law days. The Emperor replied that it was very doubtful. After exchanging compliments with the I autho-feQs, he took leave of the Emprews, who had accompanied him in an open carriage to the station, and, attended by AI. Fould, Minister of 0!4te, he entered the carriage prepared for hin. In a few' moments the Imperial train was out of sight. The Emperor was met by the Prefect of tbe Landea at a short distance from Mont de Marsan, the chief town of the department, and visited a property which he has lately purchased inthatneighbourhood. The Minister of State returns to Tarbe3 in order to preside at the Conseil G6n6ral of the department. The Empress returned to Biarritz, but again proceeded to Bayonne at 3 oclock to attend a bullfight in the Faubourg of St. Esprit, on the same spot where these sports have been held for the last few years. The King of Wurtemberg, who was curious to witness, for the first time, I believe, this humanizing amusement so dear to Spaniards, took his seat in the bull-ring at a quarter to 4, attended by his suite; and Her Majesty the Empress, accomparied f by her sister and the ladies who are in ordinary waiting upon her, was punctual to the moment, and made her appearance in her box precisely at 4. The bulHighters only awaited the presence of Her Majesty to begin operations. The Mayor of St. Esprit, after the usual preliminaries, gave the signal to the troop (cuadriUla). The stall where the animals are kept in waiting was thrown open, and the first bull bounded into the arena. He gave sport the usual time. and, after undergoing the usual process of torture, secundum aiem, to the apparent satisfaction of the amateurs high and low, he encountered the sword of the redoubtable Salainanquino, who gave him the quietus from which there is no escape. The second animal afforded for the same space of time a similar pleasure to the upper and lower hundreds, and met the same inevitable fate as his predecessor. The applause from the boxes, which testified to the ability of the bullighters, and of the matador in particular, were scarcely hushed, when the sky became overcast. The very moment when the third bull was about to issue from his staU a flash of lightning shot from a pile of black cloud which hung in the sultry atmosphere, the distant roar of thunder was heard, theheavy drops, announcing the presence of the storm, fell in the arena, and in a few minutes the rain rushed down with violence. The sport was at once interrupted; but if that was the only casualty of the day there would not be much to lament. To escape tho " pelting of the pitiless storm,"-for thunder, lightniug, and rain threatened to come in full career-numbers of the spectators rushed to the gallery or platform where the musicians were stationed, and which, except the reserved boxes, was the only spot covered by an awning. The gallery consisted merely of boards laid horizontaUy, with their extreme ends resting for their only stay on wooden posts, but witb no support in the centre. It might have borne all day without accident the 40 or 50 musicians who were stationed there to cheer the spirits of the spectators,. but it couxld not resist the weight of the hundreds who rushed at once on it for shelter. It was the weakest part of the whole structure; and it was, moreover, immediately over the spot where the mules and the muleteers usuaUy employed in removing from the arena the horses that have been torn and disembowelled by the bulls, as well as the slaughtered bulls themselves, are kept in attendance. Amid the storm and confusion, the fragile structure suddenly gave way, and the crowd that clung to it were precipitated to the ground. A cry arose from the multitude. It was feared that several persons were kdlled. The fear was exaggerated; it is said that t. ==nVwxonaa, if t t.o nhstatnt death, in such a manner as to leave but little hope of sur. viving; and eight or ten, according to one account, five or six according to another, have either had limbs fractured or are severely bruised. One of the animals underneath was killed, but he probably saved one or two huran beings from the same fate. The confusion was at its height. The rain stiU rushed down, but it did not seem to diminish the ardour of the spectators for the bull fight. The manager, naturally enough, thought that the weather, not to speak of the disaster which just occurred and the sight of the victims, would dispense him from presenting the rest of the bulls. He was never more mistaken. The continuance of the " sport " was called for as if nothing had happened, and, enraged by the delay of the managger, the most enthusiastic of the spectator' shouted at the highest pitch of their voices, gesticulated angrily, and swore, and still no bull making his appearance,they feU to tearing up benches, breaking down barriers, and breaking everything they could lay hands on into pieces. The disaster, and the confusion which followed, was not a spectacle of the most agreeable kind to man or woman The Empress, doubtless, thought the same. Accompanied by her ladies, she quitted her box and returned to Biarritz, not, however, without having made inquirles as to the state of the wounded, and having received assurances that they should be taken care of. AU chance of continuing the " amusement," now that Her Majesty honoured the ring no longer with her presence, was, of course, over, but the rioters still continued their uproar. The troops interfered, and, after some delay and difficulty, the place was cleared, and, by the joint exertions of the civil authorities and the soldiers, tranquillity was restored. The second buU fight, which was to have taken place this day, has been postponed until the broken posts, benches, and galleries have been restored. Whether the Empress intends to appear again on some fature Sunday at these bul fights is not stated. The Emperor is, I believe, sincerely desiroas to restore as much as possible the observance of Sunday among the population of Paris and the departments, the disregard of which iz one of the remnants of the Revolution. The working men,who are paid by the day, excuse ther violation of it on the ground of the loss of a day's wages to themselves and their families. They may probably point to the example of similar disregard on the part of the Court, but unpalliated by any such cxcuse. The Imperial Court has within the last few days augmented its spiritual resources. It has now the religious aid of Cardinal Merlot, Archbishop of Paris, just named Grand Almoner, in addition to the Bishop of Nancy, the First Almoner, not to speak of a coniderable number of spiritual advisers of an inferior degree. None of those right rev. or rev. persons will hesitate to declare, if necessary, that the bull-ring, with its ordinary ac. companiments, is not precisely the place to visit an hour or so af ter divine service on such a day, and that the presence of the Court on such an oocasion is not the most edifying spectacle to present to the people. Without touching on the abstract question of bull fights as a national amusement, it may be said that in France it is not, and is not likely to become, national. There has been, for many years, a floating Spanish population in Bayonne, but it is only very recently that bull fights have been regularly held in it; and I suspect that the authorities who are supposed to preside at these spectacles -perform the duty much against their will, an. would gladly be dispeneed from it. Neverthele",, if the Spanish residents and a certain portion of the population ot Bayonne wish for bull fit nts, let them gratify their taste; but the Imperia.l Court, to whom people are suppnxed to look ur as models of various and exalted virtues, wll suP~ er but little in public estimation by not hurtug, at least on Sunday fromthe church to the bull ring. I am mistaken if the kEmp-eror,gi not find many of his subjects of the same opinion, ALGERIA. At the banquet given by the Governor-General of AJgeri& on the oce,sion of theflte of the Emperor, Marshal Randon, in proposing the health of the Imperial farily, said - " Gentlemen,-According to the enstom of our fathers, we are assmbled to celebrate the fg4l of our Sove. reign. Algeria, on this day of nationol rojoicing, raises her voice to the Thronerwith the more assurace that sbe,is proud of having merited well of the mother ooaetsy, While her abundant crops are Bowing to the markets of Franoe, the army of Africa inscribes a fhue page in her xrilitary history. The conquest of Kabylia is not only a title of glory for the army, but it effects a great progress in our colonization, which stands in need of space, arms, and sc. rity. The work, gentlemen, advances; property becomes secure; our commercial relations extend more and more every year; our agriculture improves, and our minnafaotures develop themselves; and it is manife3t to every eSe that our young colony is in the most prosperous state. One wish, however, remains for us to form, which, by being renewed every year, cannot fail to become more ardent. It is that of seeing the Emperor on these shores, of enabling him to judge from personal observation what we are all doing, each in our several spheres, for the prosperity of the colony, and receiving from His Majesty's mouth those expressions of satiufaction which increase tenfold the happiness of having done well. That day, we dare hope,wiUl come, and then, as to-day,we will unite our voices in the patriotic acolamations of I Vive VEmpereur /' 'Yivc 1mP6ratric' I Vive le Prince Imp6rial I"'I AUSTRIA. (FROM OUR OWN COBREESPODJNT.) VIENNA, AuG. 24L The Triester' Zeitung learns from the Dardanelles that the Porte intends to sutmmon to Constantinople delegates from the different Greek communities, annd to take their opinion on a project for the future constitution of their church. The news may be correct, but itis not very probable that the Turkish Government will bring forward the Tanzimat question until it is obliged to do so by the parties to the treaty of peace. The programme of the solemn antry of the Archduke Ferdinand Maximnilian and of the Archduchess Charlotte into Milan has already been drawn up. The whole garrison will parade, and a double "hedge" will be formed by the troops fromtherailroad station tothepalace. The "Place-I majors" will lead the procession, and the state car- I riage is to be followed by the commander of the corps which occupies Milan, and by the military commander of the city. The Lombard aristocracy will be invited to attend in their carriages. It need hardly be said, that there will be a great ringing of bells, playing of military bands, and thundering of cannon as the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom and his fair bride pass through the streets of Milan. Count Sebregondi, the Podesta of the city, will receive their Imperial Highnesses at the Porte Orientalo, where a splendid tent is to be erected. As has been said, the exterior of the beautiful cathedral is to be lighted with Bengal fire duximg 20 minutes. His Majesty the Emperor left Vienna for Pressburg yesterday afternoon, and will now visit the north-western parts of Hungary. It is probable that the Hungarian journey will be completed on or about the 5th of September. ITALY. A telegraphic despatch in the Univers announces that the Pope arrived at Leghorn on the 25th, and was most warmly received. From the Monitore Toscano we learn that on the 21st, His Holiness gave his benediction from a balconv of the Pitti Palaee to the Tuscan army drawn up on the square below. Jf. - a at t.nt far Pra and Pistoia, and returned to Florence the same day about dinner time. In the afternoon he visited the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova, in company with the Grand Duke, and gave his benediction to the patients. On his return to the palace he was greeted by four bands of musicians, preceded by a detachment of 300 soldiers, with torches. The bands continued playing under the Pope's windows until 10 at night. The Opirione of Turin states from Naples that since the discovery of arms and ammunition onboard the two Neapolitan steamers, mentioned last week, several houses in the capital have been searched, and some arrests made. A Paris letter in the ZVord of Brussels says "'The dispute bebveon Naples and Piedmont on the subject of the seizure of the Cagliari is becoming complicated. The Cabinet of Tarin insists on the release of the passengers of that vessel, and the Neapolitan Government refuses until the trial of the insurgents of Sapri shall have terminated. The reply of Xf. Caraffa was accompanied by some warm recriminations against the Piedmontese Government, on whose terrritory the plot, be declared, was organized. Count de Cavour demands a dis. avowal of tho note of 2. C_raffa, and a diplomatic x apture between the two countries is considered not improbable."

GENBRAL D'OP!WNI. TO THE EDITOR P s. THE TIM Sir,-I observe a notice in Ti* Times of yesterday's date to the effect that one General DOrgonl had passed through Marseilles o. his return to hAia. Imet this person in Baslh in 1852-53. He was then ccnsidered a doubtful chasater, and was to a certain extent under surveillance; h. was, however, an occasional guest at m1Et of Vke messea c tbe regiments occupying R%ngoon. Herepresented himself as a retired Firench officer, a somewkit violent Legitimist, and not a little opposed to the present Emperor. 'He was ultimately taken prisoner by a partv of Burmese and conveyed to Ava. It was generally thought the capture was pre-arranged. I always understood his real name to be Dugonier. HIe had possibly eerved in the French army, but that ho hid ever attained to the rank of officer many doubted. Your obediAnt pprv"3nL B, Aug. 25.

The 16th Lancers, in Kilkenny, having at length received the expected route for Edinburgh, have already begun to march. On Monday morning a troop, under the command of Captain Irwin, with Cornet Armstrong, left for Belfast, sid Carlow; and on Ttesday morning the head-quarters division, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Pattlo, followed them. The four troops at Athy, Carlow, Waterford, and Cahir, have also oommenced moving to Belfas3t from which the whole regiment (eonsisting of 24 offioers, 300 non-oommissioned officers, trumpeters, farriers, and rank and file, with 45 officers' chargers and 271 troop horse.) will embark on the 4th, 7th, and 8tb of September for Glagow, and march thence to Eninburgh, where they will oocupy the Piershill barracks. The arrival of the Conqueror, 101, screw two-decker, Captin Yelverton, C.B., at Spithead yesterday morning is to be accounted for as follows :-When Admiral Lord Lyons was at Gibraltar with his squadron the transport Abeona, des tinedto bring the 47th Regiment to England, arrived from Malta In a disabled state. As the Governor of Gibraltar represented to the Admiral that the authorities at home were particularly desirous of getting the 47th to England with the least possible delay, his Lordship detached the beat line-of battleship at his disposal for the purpose, and at 21 hours' notice from the time of the Governor's expressing his wish the whole regiment were embarked aud the Conqueror underway. She made the passaLe to Spithead in x days. Her troops were landed on Tuesday afternoonby the steam-tugs Pigmy and Comet at Clarence-yard, whenoe they proceeded by rail to quarters.

The Mermaid transport Is shipping pr9vlsions from the Royal Clarence-yard for India. The Ehersonese stearn transport arrived at Portsmouth from Liverpool yesterdsy to embark troops for India. The Atbleth has been chartered, and is hourly expected in Cork harbour to c;m bark Major the Hon. D. Frazer's (C) battery of Artilery. The horses have been handed over to the 9th Battalon of Royal Artillery at Ballincollig. The head-quarters of the o6th will not be able to leave Cork before the end of this weok, as the Waterloo, in which they are to proceed, is not expected to arrive before Thursday, owing to the preparation of some necessary fittings. The sailing ship Aiipore, belonging to W. S. Lindsay and Co., fitted out at Deptford to receive the artillery troops for Kurrachee, went down to Woolwich on Tuesday evening, and has stUl a number of artificers on board arranging the military fittings. She is expected, however, to be in readiness to-day (Thursday) for the inspection of tho Naval Board, and will probably embark her troops on the following day. Thoy are to consist of Liheutenant Colonel E. Price; Lieutenant W. Stirling, Adjutant; Lieutenant A. T. C. Peurse (Pearse), Quartermaster; Captain A. F.

Captain Morri, in charge of the ehip Rio Blanco, recently arrived in Young's Wharf, at Millwall, has engaged 10 Artillery sergeants (the majority of whom are employed in Woolwich arsenal), to proceed to Poru as troop instructors in the Peravian Horse Artillery. Eighty extra labourers were yesterday engaged to clear out the iron ballast, consisting of 800 tons, on board the Defenco hulk at Woolwich, so sa to enable her to be towed into dock. The whole of the stores to the value of 2, 0001., principally bale goods, damaged by their long immersion in the water, have been disposed of to the naval contractor, and havo been removed. A telegraphic order was yesterday despatched to Woolwich directing the steam frigate Curacoa to retain her tores, as, by Admiralty directions, she is not to be paid off at Woolwich. Captain John Adam is to have the good service pendon vacant by the promotion of the Hon. HIenry Keppel to his flag. Captain W. C. Addsam was yesterday appointed to the Valorous, commissioned.

A TEPPERARY MuRDBR.-One of those foul and atrocious murders which in former yea used to be of frequent occurrence in the connty of Tippe rary was committed on Thursday at a piee alled Grtnahoe,I about eight miles from Thurles, and close to Long. ford Pass.

It is altogether an unettled and anomalous region; it has rivers thst rise suddenly without visible feeders, aud disappear before reaching the sea; both its land and water we shifing and changeable; one lake district, Inron as the Everglades, Is said to be draining Itelf and becoming dry by some unknown proces, -probably a cannel forced to tho ocean too reestly to have been noted by the mapmaker The Spaniards had nome stange notions of this part of the oontinent; they supposed It to contain the "3ountain of youth," of ancient fable, and mae eploring expediton In search of it.

Time, surveyor., and the demand for cotton wlll robabiF soon open up this southern extremity of -the continent, of which so much is the reserve of the future; but at present, an not a fiftieth part of it is peopled, nor a thousnmdth fraction of its area oultivated, the traveller, who must keep within the line of civiiization, is compeiod to skirt Its northern border and tur his face fronl the Atlantic shore towards the Missisippi.

It is the "dead" season, at which residentsj depart to distant springs and retreata in the higher lando fE thie interior to the north, and those left behind have abundance of leisure. The port is on the river side, whare terraces amd quays are growing up, with an avenue of trees between ship and warehouse. From this platform, which is no lee than 40 feet above the river level, there is a wide view over the plain of the opposite shore, that looks like excellent meadow land, but perhaps is not rich s pasture, the hotel milk being so poor and watery. The river itself, the Savannah, is the frontier be.tween South Carolina and Georgla, and is navigable up to August, a distance of nearly 300 miles; but the Augusta and Savannah Railroad, running nearly parallel with it, has taken away the pasenger trae from the steamers. The water is very turbid, like that of ail the rivers of the South, and tnust contain a large percentage of deposit. It is yellow enough to contrast distinetly with the brilliant verdure through wAhich It fiows, but is not otherwise remarkable except for its alligators, which are described as voracious, and of an %mamiable disposition generally. Being much persecuted they have boeome suspicious; they swarmed round the early explorers, and attacked their boats, " bellowing like bulls," whlch was not courage, but merely ignorance of danger. Tlhe older, larger, and pugnaious specimens having been Idfned off, the prwent race have learnt to keep their distanee, which is just out of rifle shot; they shunned the cquaintance even of the disinguished naturalist, Dr. LyelL Surprisingastories are told of their age, and the odd articles of which they have occasionaly 'been disembowelled. The compiler of AppletoV's HaiL*Aook (the American Murray) says, " We once saw a large specimen of the genus that had swallowed a bottle of brandy and a certificate of membership in a Methodist church." A descendant of Munchausen may have been included in the large German immigration, and is guiding travellers for the New York publishers Augstat, the second city or town of Georgia, is on the Savannah, at the head of its navigable water. It Is a place of spacious streets, somewhat too Spacious for the number of inhabitants; and its chief features are some verv pretty mausions,perfect models of neatness, the abodes of retired leisure, standing aloof from the business section of the main avenue. This cbnsbts of dry goods stores, two or three hotels, and several druggists' shops. I)rapery, drugs, and ready-made clothes form the bulk of the trade of the inland towns; often there is very little else, and the traffic in prepared garmenta is mostly In the haads of the great race with whom it is a speclality. Jews an) Germms abouad i-x the interior of the States; they seem to have ousted the native Americm from whole branches of traffic. You may pas rows of shops with names * and faces that are genuine.. importations from Whitechapel, the streets of Frankiort, or the towns of the Rhine.

What are the natives, it mnay beasked t itn not so e to ay. For m&na the poty trades are too slow of profit, and they flock to the West to speulate in land; or the wholej Wale houses, the profeions? and in the Southern States, certainly, the plantations and farms may help to answer the question. Another thing the inland towmn have in commou and in perfection is dullness; they combine the quietude of a vilage with the streets of a metropolls. Ten imes thoe ife of the Imperiallyrnamed August, would not crowd its spacious avenues, and the ery genius of dullness desoended upon it on what should have been On inspiring day-on the national festival, the 4th of July. No attempt was made to elebrate it, and, as the shops were closed, the place looked as if mourning some national calamity. -q& puzzled and entirey bored, the people did not know to do with themseves The Bird of Freedom dj4 tf gt idp the slightest scrm, but fairly put bb head under his wing and went to sleep.

Thq atmosphere was heavywith uilexace and apathy1 and all was so utterly unlike his preconceived ideas of a 4th of Jule onmterican by that your corre - spondent fled fuom the town by the train departing for Savannah, midnight, in due course, taking the disnally keet anniversarv awav with it- In going from Augusta to Sivannah, and thence to Macon, the traveller passes over the whole of the line on which Mx. Arrowsmith had that dreadful vision of revolver fights, duels, murders, and infanticide, by the dexsption of which he made this Georgian railroad more talked of for a time than if it had paid a 20 per cent. dividend. The story startled the British public, and considerably amused the Americans. It excited some curiosity to know on what it could be founded. It Is quite useless to inquire; the narrative has no foundation whatever; it is a mere hallucination. It is not easy to prove a negative, but not diffioult to ascertain that a waking dream is not a reality, however vivid it may have appeared to the person visited by it. The officers of the line and the conductor of the train in which the series of tragedies is supposed to have occurred have already formally denied the truth of the statement; two of the passengers by the same carn, on the same night, are still relsiding in the Macon, respectable and intelligent men of business, and their direct testimony as to the utter baselessness of the narative wrould satisfy any court of law or jury in the wvorld. It is a mere waste of time to pursue the absurdity further in the way of disproof. Nothing of the kind has occurred on the line from the day It was opened; the nature of the delusion and the motive for publishing such a monstrous timue of fictiou remain wholly intelligible, and are as incapable of being explained in any reasonable manner here, in the locality itsels, as in England. It is supposed that the author of it may on some occasion have been told a dreadful tale, which so forciblr ipren d-him that he reproduced it, with the slight addition of making himself an eye-witnes of facts, instead of an auditor of fables; that he somewhere supped full of horrors, and, having a good digestion for such diets so thoroughly asimilated them that they became part of 7imlf, and were recorded as exner1tne. The dreadfl night ride, with its pistol fghts and massacres, was in reality a quiet ordinary journey between two commercial towns, with the average number of peaceable citizens, and involved no more alarming incidents than would be likely to oocur on the same number of miles by the Great Western. One of my informants was in the baggage, car, in which one of the duels, I believe, is supposed to have been fought, during the entire trip, and was not disturbed by any terrific combat. The baggagecar is the smoklng room of the trains, and pmtee occasionally retire thither with "refreshments.'J It should be stated also that a bottle of ohampagme in known in these parxt as a "Monte Ohrido pistol," a brand of that wine bearing the name of Durnas's hero. In the narrative this pleaeant and harmless article figunres as a lethal wealon, making but a slight repo.t, and therefore used by the hostile parties as convenient for qniet fighting With the addition of as many "dead men" stretchedl on the boards as there are empty bottles left behind some tasee of a prior my2tification or mistaking figurative language for literal description become apparent; and some of the sanguinary hosrro is wiped out oflthestory.

THE INDIAN MUTINIES. T1ho iollowing letter is ron anm officer at Benlares.:-. ,. ; "BENA.ES, JUx 22. " On Thursday, June 4, about midday, our authoritles recedved intelligence of the meeting at AzlIghur, and resolved in oonsequence to be beforehand with our Sepoys and disarm them that afternoon. Our European foroe consisted of a few companies of Ifer Majeaty's 10th, a very few of the Mafdrasi Feieera (who had arrived most opportunely that very day, under Colonsil Rot), and threa 9-pounders with about 20 gunners. The Sikhs, under Colonel Gordon, were believed to be stanch, as also the 13t'h I-regular Cavalry, Under the unfortuate Captain Gause The above regiment. were accordingly drawn up in front of the 37th Native Infantry, with the view of intimitin, the latter into subninjvenes&. In reality, hoWever, as th3 event proved, thes two native corps-viz., the Slkhe and the 13th IregnlarsI were as much in need of being di, armed as the37tb, and the consd4usuens of this no doubs enoouraged the 37th to Act as they did. The 37th wera drawn up in front of their lines, with the cannon pointed xs them. The Earopeans were drawn up within musket rauge, and the Sikhs and IrreguLar Cavalry within sight. "It is not wonderfaltha esuodeadlypreparations should have fdIled the Sepoys with alrm and disaffection, even supposing them to have remained up to that moment true to their colours. A.lthough, no doubt, in the 37th there wer3 many disaffected spirits, yet I believe that the reglment aI a whole was sound, aud that t,he diarming might have been effected in perfect peace and quietuess,hd it been gone aboutin alessabruptandthrecteningmanner. ButProvidenc"' often turns our mistakes slill more signay than our wise3t measur to our advantage, and so It was onthe 4th of Jane, for there can be no doubt that ou-r safety depended on the dispersion and panic of these rascally Sepoys; and even if aome 'good men and true' were involved in the fate of their fellows, the sacrifice was an inevitable one in an emer. gency like the present. Therefore, I say, although the Sepoys might have been quietly diebanded, the mistake thst provoked a row wa a most fortunate one. Well, then, on eeing themselves hemmed in with musketry and artillery, tho Sepoys (many of them, no doubt, with a gnilty conscience) naturally suspected that they were to be blown t pie, -d mu thu NzUrAnes of their ofloers proved ineffec tual to keep them composed. They were ordered to pub their muskets into the little stone bunldings called kotes o bells of arms. The majority of their number obeyed at c^oe, and European soldiers were then marched towards the bellr of arms with the view of securing them from any attemiA which tI, 9 /A But the 5epoya were beforehand with them, and making a sudden resh at the belb ef arms recovered their nmakets and fired at onCe upon ther own officers and upn the ad vancing Enropeans, retiring at the nme time witWa, their lines, and tbeinct keeping up a brsk fro upon the Enreces, Up to this time, however, ne ofter had boen hit, The SopoyS of the 37th ensConoed thexna!ves forthe most pt be W4dtheirhult,awe,of thembhndhebeHofarn.s.

Bat the Irragular Cavalry were sttered about in evey direotion, and thus the chanoes of my ever raching my bungalow seemed to me very slender. But the worst disposed of the Irregulars were engaged in assisting the Slkhs, and those whom I met were fellows who contented themselves with rendering the 'Sahibs no manner of assistance, without personally seek. ing to molest us. They, therefore, with one exception,. rode leburely p te`e, 4itaough, hd any of their number felt inclned to out me down, I Was so entirely heiples and fat from loss of blood that they might easly have done go.

Bat even the my circumstances were the reverse of enviable, for, besld i the intense pain which I Was suffering, I knew not whether my wotnd was mortal or not, and was In momentary expectation of being murdered in cold blood by a party of rnutineerm " Thus I lay until about 2 o'olock on Friday morning. " The Sikhs had no sooner been dispersed than the lines Of the 37th were charged, and every Sepey driven out. The soldiers were then fully ocoupied in going the rounds of the cantonments, and escorting the terrified]:dies and civilians to the Mint. Daring the whole progress of the affray on the parade-ground-a full hour-the catonmnenis had been at the mercy of bands of armed Sepoys. These were assem. bled from two sources,-first, from the various guards which had been posted (as usunl) throughout the cantonments ; the I treasury gard, for instance; the hospital guard, baza guard, mesa-house guard, and so forth. On the outbreak of the row these respectable and conselentious fellows et to - work (wit one or two honorabole exceptions) to plunder teilr several trusts, sad, that aecompled dispered them xelves among the various bungalows, as beat on bloodshed as on bootY. Many ahairbreadth eapo was made that nlght, ad I oo u ld § 1t wthM a d et e of Ulthe W .oad Providence to which defenceleas women and children owed theirlives. The bungalows were of eourse abandoned for such lurking-places as the outhouses could afford, and in a"ldmtas , thesePwemnmuaked bymv4deious Sepoys. Of course it would haie been quite miraculous had none of us been burt But it is truly- iemark. able lt Colonel Gordon, bn adjutant, Lieutenant Glasse, and Captain Dodgson, mounted aa they were on huge chargers, were not riddled with the perfect shower of bullets with which they were pursued. The ' casualties were :-Killed on tho spet, Captain Guise; died of his wounds, Enign Hayter, of the 25th Native Infantry, bat doing duty with the 37th until the arrival of his regi. ment, vid the river, from Calcutta. Poor fellow, he has been in the country a still ahorter time than youand L It was In consequenoe of a fever which Attacked him shortly after his landing in Calcutta that he was sent by Gharry dAk to Benares, there to awatt the arrival of his reRiment which, had It not been for that fevor, he would at this moment have been acoompanying up the Ganges. To save the pain of a wounded ankle-joint, though without the slghtest hope of saving his life, one of his legs was ampu. Wtted above the knee. He was wounded besides in the "abomen, and this in itself ws in all probability a mortal injury. For nearly a week he lingered, sinldng grsduaUy and not very ainfully into his grave. " Threewere wounded-viz., EnsignChapman, of the37th, 'verydangerously,' myself 'severely,'andDodgson 'very alightly.' Poor Chapman was shot through the face, the bullet entering at one cheek and going out at the other. His apeech, slong with the sight of one eye and the use of one ear, is hopelessly gone. It is with tho utmost difficulty and pain that he caa swallow even the fluids which eonsti tute his mole sustenance, and hence his limbs ar little else thn akin and bone. His life, however, is not supposed to be in any Immediate d*nger, and as oon as he can travel he wil be sent home to his parents round by tAe Cape. Both he and HAyter were shot by the Sikhs. " But all this is a digressmon, for I was spealing of the civilians. The bolder -. them emerged At last from their lurking places, and nade their way to the Mint, a large -bullding, previously agreed upon as the general asylum. On their way whole volleys were poured in upon them by parties of Sepoys, but not even one of their hore or syces was touched. " I told you that the Sepoys wre let loose from two 3ources upon the cantonments. I have mentioned only one of these sources, vlz.,-the varlous guards; secondly, a still greater aumber came strgling into the cantonments from the lines of the 37th; the temptation to plunder the ' SAhiW' bungalows being still stronger in their inaances than the love of 'potting' the Sahibs themselve upon the parade ground.

I 2THR GUARPDS AT PUENTiS DlOROL TO THE EDITOR OF THE, TIMLES. Sir,-Having given place in yourwidely-extended columns to a correspondence between Captain Brialmont and Sir William Napier, perhaps in fairne s yon wiajSnd for a refutation of a most unfoundedttack. byx&schtosi, ties on very dinpished corpe. 'Captain Arillcnt " General Pelet reported that General Fournier, at the head of the 7me and 13me Chasseurs & Cheval, sabred three battalions of the English Guards which supportedthe English cavalry and formed the right of the British infantry podijin,kiad that these battalions threw dowzn their arms." The Captain then goes on to quote Marshal Jourdan, whho Dot only confirms the foregoing statement, but adds "that the General comrmanding these English Guards was taken prisoner." IL Thiers, more modet, states that Colonel Blill (of tihe Guards) "remit son 6pde, et que leal1,500 prieonniers, au lieu de prendre tous la ftle laistdrernt 400 11 500 des leurs entre les mains de Montbran." I happened to be present in that action with the Coldstreams, and know what I saw. There were not three battalions of Guards, but only two, somewhat weak ones, attached to the Ist Division of our army. We were moved early in the actionof the 5th of May tothe right of our postion, in support of the Light and7th Div,lions and our= e cavalry on their retiring across the plain. We were arways in lne, and iin the front of the position assigued Tts, and, the right flank of our brigade being thrown back, lwe sood en potmncc, where we remained throughout the day. We never were chrged by cavalry, neverformed square, and did not lose the General commaeding our brigade. I bave notea by me taken at the time, and snce ptbYished previous to the appeance of hIL Thiers's and Captain BrialmontVs publications. I find in them the following notice of these eircamstinoes as they oocurred -* f, ,Lord Wellington rode up, and, seeing lat the fire of the enemy's round shot, shells, and sharpshooters was beginning to tell on our front line, ordered us to lie down Our further orders were to remazn on the groand until the enemy approached in columns to within some 30 yards, then to rise. fire a volley, and chage bayonets; bat their 8ma of infantry never advxnced, " A picket of the Guards, under Lieutenant-Colonel Hill, while skirmishing in our front, 'w attacked by cavalry, but resisted them with success. They were suddenly charged a second time from behind some undulating ground, under cover of which the cavalry bd approached unperoeived. The Frech horsemen dashed at once on them while in extended order, and took them in flank and rear out down the men in detail, and carried off many prisoners. Ont of 100 rzak and file and fire offioers, about 30 of the former and one of tho latter esoaped unwounded.

RAIL WAY AND JMhINKG $HAM Wednes&ay Evesg. In the railway-market only a moderate emount of business has been tranacted, the attention of operators being chiefly occupied in the arrangement of the approaching account. An advance, however, occurred in many of the leading delcriptionsi tespecially in North-Eastern; and in South Wales there was a partial recovery. Great Northern B stock declined 11., while the preference shares improved. A reduction took place in East Indian. (3rand Trunk of Canada and Great Western of Canada were higher. In foreign shares, Southern of France and Pais and Lyons receded; Dutch Rhenish and West Faanders were rather better. In rmines, Devon Great Console advanced, and there was a fall in North Wheal Basset, St. John del :Rey and Santiago de Cuba. An improvement of I l. took place in Bank of London; Union of Auztralia were lower. In miscellaneous securities, Electric Telegraph were quoted at an advance, while the second issue of Netherlands Land showed a downward tendency. ORDNtARY SH&P28 AND MUK&

SUMMEfR ASSIZE NORTHERI' CIRCMll. LIVERPOOT, AUG. 26. n; THE CASE OP MACKAY AND OTSS V. SnWlSoN. 3Mr. Baron CHAN1N summed up the evidence at some length B leaving three questions for the jumy :-1, Whether the illness at Blackpool was a diseas ot diorder calculated to shorten hfe. 2. Whether 1r. Barke was the medical attendant of the deceaed, having regard to the attendanoe of Mr. ayton. 3. Whether, if they thought Mr. Burk} was the medical attendant, they were of opinion he was the only one whose services the deceased had required. The jury found that the deceased was suffering from a disease calculated to shorten life; that Mfr. Burke was not his medical attendant ; and that Mr. Clayton and Dr. Risleg attendanoe ought to have been communicated to the Campany. Verdict for the defendant upon all the pleaE, including that of fraudulent misrepresentation. ,Before Mr.Baron WeTsos.) COMI'PANY. Mr. Pickering, Q.C., and Mr. ilward appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Brett for the defendante. The action waa brought for damages for an Injry s tained by the plaintiff himself and some cattle of his by an accident arising from the negEgenoe of the company's servants. The laintiff as a cattle.dealer, living in Queen's County, Ireland. ln Apnl lst he came over to liverpool th 43 bead of cattle, which he took by the Iaucashire and Yorshire Bailtay Comant y toBu rroughear,dena aro gate, withthe 3 iew ol selling them. It i 1 customr on thlce when there isa large quontity of cAttle, to allowe adrover and owner toegorunkthe van with the guarad i On this occasion thera were nine drovers, int dhading the plaintif and 180 head of cattle Out of the 43 cattle belonging to the plintiff 12 were pfrcedponthe, y rck neo' to the engin. Afterwthedc ttle had al been placed in the ru nd the plaintiffkhad paid his money, one of the officials of the oompany came to him a nd handed him a*ticket. The plaintiffcoa0dMneither read nor wrsite, and he consequently asked whb3t the ticket waSB for. " Oh, you know," wa the reply. Afterards itap. peared that some of the drovers signed the ticket, and some did not. The plaintiff put his cross to it. The laintiff again asked 'vhat it meant. He was told, in reply, by one of the company's servants that it meant that he was to run all the risk, and bear all the responsibility in case of accident, He replied, that ws no time to tellhim when his cattle wore in the trcJks and his money paid; and if they injured his cattle he would make them pay as he had done before. The train went on until it cwne to Geldardroad, where there was a junction and sidmig. The guard here said the drovers could not sit in the van with him and that they mus go into the tracks with the cattle. They did so, the plaintiff getting into the waggon where 12 of thls cattle were. About 2 o'clock in the morning the waggns went off the line in consequence, it ws aleged, oE the abeenae of the polns Iman at a certain crossing. The truck in wiiich the plaintif and his cattle were wasa thrown over, the phlaitiff wa s injured, and some of his cattle were renderci unfit for sale. The pla intifreceived such iujuries, particularly to the sDine, that, despie the best medical treatment and sa batfiing, from being a strong and healthly man, he could not now walk a mile, and he s compeled to employ another mau to perform his business. Upon the part of the defendants it was conte3 ded hat, as far as the cattle were concerned, the plaintiff had entered into a special contract under the 7th section of the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 31, by puttiinghis cross to the ticket, and had thus relieved the railway company from all legal responsibilit for any injury to the cattle. They Oonsentel, howlever, to a verdict for the plaintifi, damas 100L., for the injuries susaied by himsself, which wvas ulltimately.S accepted. nItVmr V. BEli.-nRXACH OF P5ROMI OF MA 1;G Mr. lidwrd James, Q.yC., and Jtr. Aspinall appeared for the plaintiff; and Mir. Conway for the defendant. The plaintiff is a rmiliner, and a daughter of the late Captain Wa&kr Baven.~ and carrmed on a very respectable 'ouslijeis ipt~ -to~ % ear I.SBf2 at Wbltebaven. t c then came toLIAverpool, and continued with her sisters in the same business supporting her aged mnother. Inthe year 1849 she became acquainted wih the deFendanit, whio wa at that timne a cerk in a corn broker's ofice, having been In. troduced to her as a lodger by two genen who had p viously rented her apartments. In Janu of the following year he made proposals to the plaintif which were eventually aooepted, and the defendant was, after that, generally received as the plaintiff's future husband. The do. fendant, however, repeatedly suggested that the marriage should be postponed until he should obtain a better dtuation than the xQi he then had; but, after repeated delAys and 1pgFiastination, he left the house and ozly paid VEcoa8inal visits, and went to reside at Wrehsm, idiere the plintiff called upon him in July, 1854, for the purpose of demanding somae 'eplanation of his con,duct, and upon her arriv she cetained, to her great anaement, that the defendwnt had i'ceen married for some days to a widow whio put up At the I house. The defendant at that time was indebted o the plaintiff in the sumof 431.14s., of whic he had sine paid 174. It was proved that for a long period of time the defendant had been out of a situation, andsffeig inhealth, and during that period he had been boarded ad nerded by the _plaintiff anhersister.

T}IE MuDn a m TzXB HIxMpTRAI-oAD .-The unfortunate youth Galleo Benzonelli, who was stabbed by a man named Cornelius Denny, now in custody on the charge, at an ice d gingerbeer shop, 17 Hampstead-road, on She morning of Sunday list, e3pired from the injuryhe sutained, at University CollegeHosipital, At 9 oelock on TQesday evening, after great suffering. It appea tbat Mr. Ericson, Mr. Vincent5 and other surgeoos of the hospitl had but faint hopes of the young men's iecovery from the outset, as, although they were enabled to eotu the entraols which had protruded, there was every apprehension that Inflammation would supervene, and that there was internal bleeding,althouge theintctnefoundprotrudinghadnot baen cut orwoanded, so far as couldbe ascertained. The suspiclons of the medical ofioes puroved to be correct, sad the ptent became so excessively low and weak in the course of Vonday that it was felt advisable, after the examination of the tccused at Mrylebone police-court, to have his dying depositions taken in the presence of the prisoner. At tat time the deceased, who is but 19 years of age, was perfectly sensible, and the moment the prisoner wa produced before him he identified him as, the man who had stabbed him. His statement was to the following effect:-" My amue is Galleo Benzonelli I am an Italian, and was in the employ of Mr. Joseph Baretti, confectioner, 17, Haipstead-road. The man before me came into the shop about 12 o'lock on Saturday night with a woman and had some gingeroeer. He then fel aleep. About 3 o'clock on Sunday morning I woke him and asked him to go out, as we wanted to cl .se. As he was going out he struck me In the fae I defended myself, aud he then took out a knife and stabbed me. I ran into the shop and told them what had happened. I was then put inhto a cab and brought here. The prisoner is the man who stabbed me." The prisoner Denny, who is a smithx by trde nan an Irishiuan, is notorious for his violent and overbearing disposition, and it is stated tt this is not the first time this fellow has been guilty of attempting the use of the knife. Mr. W akley, the coroner, has had intimation of the occur. rence forwarded to him, and has ordered a posi mworM examination of the deceased's body, but, in consequenoe of prior engagements, it is scarcely expected that the inquest can be hld before Friday or Saturday. In the meantime t,he prisoner Denny stands remanded till Monday next at MaSry le bone pcol ic e-cour t Thxs (JN 0- -The opening of this ampor tant means of communication with the sea was inaugurated on Sunday with great rejoicings. The municpalcouncil had voted a sum of 10,000f. towards the expense of the ftte, and anumber of piivatepersonsf thetown, interested in the sucoess of the undertaking, had contributed liberally. The canal shortens the distance to the sea upds of three miles, as in place of 18 Iklometres (11i miles) it is only 13 (not S miles. In addition, vessels of larger aze, which hitherto coule only a-scend to the town at the very highest tides, can now comne npat any season, the lowest depth of wfater being twelve feet. A port of refge abs also been established at Oistreham, were in story weather vessels of from 500 to 600 tens can fnd shelter. The canal was opened by tolerance on the 20th of June, and ismnediately its grest advantages became apparent. In the course of 40 days 162 vessels, of 13,500 tons, asoended the canal, which would give for the year at the Tery lowest from 130,000 to 125,000 tons. The feight for Caen which was very considerable, has sensibly diminished. When the ahipowners of England, Holland, anad Norway become aware of the advantages presented by the new means of communication with the sea a very notable increase will, it is expected, take place in the number of vessels sent. The portion of the expense which has fallen on the town of Caen is 9,000,OCOf. -a very large sum, but one which w3ll soon be oompensated for by the benefit acruing to the oommerce of the town. On Sunday the whole of the vesselsin the port were gaily dresed out, as were the houses intbeneighbourhood. Two steamers from Havre, the Ome and tbe Eclair, towed up a brig and a schooner, which arrived at a certain fixed hour, n presence of the municipa councl, and a conaderable number of persons specially invited to be present. Afterwards a variety of amusements werer ghen totbe people, and, as the weather wsfine, evrthing passed off mnost agreeably. wf Adverlsement.lWyId's New Mar ps of TIn1a-India.-- ~lda ?New Map of la, with all the Cfivi and militay StatIces ~!alesD ci Distncs kc I sheet. l.: In ease£L Yai;ahws the Poticas Da wk SttIs an 3flwy; meShet a. tiz 7e.6d.

WOROBSTER MUSICAZ FRS,PI7AL. (EROU o0jI~ OWN }t2Pt'rR N WORC=:SE JI11 AIUJ. 26. The seatorations ot the-cathedral form one ot the chief topics of Interest in the preEent meeting. The 'task hitherto bias been ably accomplished; and whether the removal of 'uhat was unsightly and out of keeping, or the complete renovation of some of the most striking parts of the original, be considered, the venerable edifite is a gainer in the strongest sense of the term. An Sdmirer of medimval urchiteoture would be rewarded for a journey to Woroester by a mere inspection of the choir, the disappearance of tho -rhitowash from the initerior walls of which has brought to Yliht many points of consummate workmanship that had lona bem forgotten. The dark )olislhed inble ,of the detached columns, in vivid contrast with the lighter stone, helps to define more clearly the tree ahfts from the clustered columns, and to reveal the bases, capitals, and mouldings in all their pris. ine beauty.* Much remains to be effected, it is true, be. tore the work of renovation can be said to be achieved in a zaanner worthy a monument of which Woroester has so good reason to be proud; but the Dean snd Chapter (with the true instinct of dears and chapters), frightened perhaps at the enterprise in which they found themssdves engaged, -aave intimated that there are now "no funds" to -meet the cost of anything more than ahan- Intely "n necessary " repairs. So fareelL, for time, 'to the glitterHng dream which many credulous people had .begnu to cherish !-farewell to stained glass, decorated roof, illuminated windows, and other pleant imaginations. It is at least eatisfactory to reflect that something has been done, and creditably done-that, to mention nothing else, *dirty whitewash has been removed, Purbeck marble laid -baTe, a new east window constructed, and buttresses so for. tsfied and restored to perpendicularity that there is no further apprehcasion of any portion of the ancient building tumbling down about the ears of the minor eanons. The reek may come later-better late than never. 1 here was a very good attendance (about NOO persons) last night in the College Hall a. the first miscellaneous concert. As the programme offered an average example of tho nature of these entertainments-which p,Yceco -tctions for the fairer part of the inhabitants of the three counties, who put on their best looks and gayest attire for the occasion -we subjoin it:- PAr L S;mphony in A minor.. .. .. .. ..

Overture-(Egmont) .Beethovr A Londoner exhausted by the London season would find little to tempt him in the above selection, unless he were sufficiently a lover of genuine art to be able to appreciate and enjoy such music as the symphony of Mendelssohn, the overture of Beethoven, and the " finale" of the first nared. But to the audience assembled last night it is more than probable the greater number of pieces offered all the charm of novelty; and from this point of view the concert should be regarded. The symphony was not played so well as we had a right to anticipate from so excellent a band; there was throughout a want of light and shade, and only in the last movement -was that spirit manifested for which our EDglish orchestras are justly famous. And yet this is a work with which every one of the performers should be pretty well acquainted. The whole was listened to with marked attention, and no one seemed to find it a minute too long. The grand piece from Loreey-in which the magnificent voice of Madame Clara Novello more than atoned for a car. taln lak of sensibility in her delivery of Leonora's pas. sionate musio-fared better than the symph!euy, cnd was the most entirely successful performance of the evening. The chorus sang well, and the band was more on the alert, so that there were not many discrepaucies to complain of. The overture of Egmont was capitally played, but to emptying benchee. The place for so grand a work as this is surely notat the end of a concert. The audience was one of the most frigid, though not perhapsleast discriminating, evergathered together In a concert room. The only attempt at an encore (wonderful and pleasant to relate of a provincial festival) was in favour of Mr. Hullah's "Three fishers went sailing," a new song which Miss Dolby is doing her best to - render popular. Miss Dolby Is not among the small number of artists who are apt to be shy with her audience, or who, on principle, put their faces against the absurd "-encore " system; and so she obeyed the bequest of her admirers 'with alacrity and repeated her performance. The two very graceful romances from Meyerbeer's l'Etoile du Nord vere both admirably given, that of Peter by Herr Formes, that of Danilowitz by Signor Gardoni, the original representatives of the parts at the Royal Italian Opera. These and Mr. Howard Glover's beautiful setting of Shelley's Indian serenade, which Mr. Sims Reeves s3ng with fervid and intense expression, were welcome, not only on account of their own merits, but because they wero unhackneyed. Mr. Hatton's spirited cantata- in which the music of Robin Hood was even more effectively song by Air. lleeves than at the Bradford Festival, where it gained so much praise, the other parts being very effliCently supported by Mlrs. Weiss (HIaid Marian), Mr. Weiss (the Sheriff) and Mr. Smith (Little John)-was also welcome, and for a similar reason. How Robin Hood's " Under the Greenwood Tree," a faultless specimen of pure ballad-singing, escaped an "'encore" we are puzzled to expla n. Miss LouisaVinning produced a favourable impression in the air frorn 1I Trovatorc, which has not been heard so often and from snch a variety of *throats at 'Worcester as in London, and was therefore gene. rally acceptable. The violin solo of AL Sainton (his own anrangement of the Troratore melodies) was a finished and masterly performance. The concert was none the les; agreeable on account of tho discretion exercised by the audience in refraining f-om asking for everything twice over. although a little more warmth would have had a beneficiaL effect, and imparted ltsetlf in a measure to the singers, to whom applause is not merely encouraging, but sometimes indispensable. The early morning Eervice in tho cathedral was well attendedto-dav, and the congregation(admittedgratis)addei the sum of 21. 17s. lOd. to the collections for the clarity The musical part of the service (Afr. Townshend Smith, o. Hereford, at the organ) comprised Humphrey's chant for II Venite," Dr. Crotch's 99th double-chant for the psalms, Orlando Gibbons's " Te Deum " and "Jubilate," and the anthem "H ear, my prayer," of Norris. The performance of Elijah was in many respects as effective as any we have heard at the meetings of the choird. There were some drawbacks. it is true, but the only im. portAnt failure was in the double quartet, "For He shalt give His angels charge," which is always difficult, but has never fared worse than on this occasion. The unaccompanied trio, " Lift thine Eyes from the Mountains " (sung by Madame Novello, Mrs. Weiss, and Miss Dolby), was repeated in obedience to a signal from the Bishop, and the choras, " He watching over Israel," which follows, and of which it f orms a part, was spoiled in consequence, as usual. Almost any piece in the oratorio (always excepting " Hear ye Israel ") would better endure being put to this ordeal than the trio in question, which cannot be separated from the ehoruswithoutloslng half itseffect. TheothersingersinECijah vwere Mr. Sims Reeves, Signor Gardon4i, and Herr Formes, the subordinate duties being assigned to Misses Palmer and Gilbert, Messrs. Montem Smaith and Thomas, The tenor music of the first part was in*rusted to Signor Gar. doni, who gave the Tecitative and air, "If with all your Hearts," with graceful aud perfect expression. In the second part Mr. Sims Reeves confirmed his right to be con. sidered our best singer of sacred mush., both in execution and in style, and sang "Then shall the righteous shine fo:th " to perfeetion. The patbetic appeal of the prophet, "It is enough," most irupressively delivered by Herr Formes; Madame Novello's "Holy, holy," equalling that of Jenny Lind herself in power of voice; and Miss Dolby's 0 O rest in the Lord," wvere the other solo displays which elicited the greatest admiration. The choruses were ce3rly all satisfactory, in several instances faultless, and invaritbly marked by that peouliarly solemn tone which can only be heard and felt within the sacred walls of a cathedral. The Duke of Cambridge arrived at Worcester at 2 pm.. and almost immnediately went to the cathedral, where his Royal Highness remsaincd duning the whole of the second part of the oratorio, to -which he listened with nmarked attention and evident interest.

ISFRJIOUS CHARGE AGAIiVST A LIVZEPOOL BBORER. LIVERPOOL, AUG. 26. At the Liverpool Police-court this afternoon, before Mr. Iansfield, a case of considerable importance, and havinR especial interest for the mercantile community, attracted a lxge nu;nber of the principal merchants and brokers of the town. Mr. Aspin*A, barrister, said he was instructed on behalf of Messrs. BiDgham and Co., corn merchants, Liverpool, to prefer a charge, under summons, against John Doherty, of Liverpool, general produce broker, for obtaining money under fdlse pretences. HIe wshed now to ascertain whether Mr. Doherty wvas in court. An affirmative answer was returned, and the case pro. ceeded. The charge, as stated in the summons, was, that the defendant had obtained securities from Messrs. Bingham and Co. under the pTetence that he was entitled to certain flour per the Centurion. Mr. Aspinall, instructed by Mr. Martin, appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Brett instructed by Messrs. Gregory, for the defendant. Mr. Aspinall, in resuming, said the eharge he had to prefer was that the defendant, John Doherty, obtained from Meesrs. John Bingham and Co., corn merchants, two acceptances, one for 1,2501., and the other for 1,700., under false pretences; that he had represented that a certain bill of lading which he deposited with them as security was a negotiable instrument, whereas he knew it was not, ax he himeelf had deposited a du licate .f th sanme hill nf lading wth -Mears flhaok and Co. for another advance. lt appeared, said thelearned counsel, that Mr. Doherty, a little while ago, pre. vious to his failure, was carrying on a very large business in the corn trade, his liabilities at the time of his suspension being something enormous, and no doubt when this occurrence took place his didiculties were very considerable. He had been doing an extensive business with the Borough Bank. On the 23d of May the defendant forwarded to the bank the bills of lading, representing that the produce hadi been sold to Messrs. Biagham and Co. That was untrue, the produce not having been so sold, which fact was ascertained when the draughts were sent by the bank to Messrs. Bingham and Co. for acceptance. The bank sent for Mr. Doherty, who made some explanatien, saying there had been sonme mistake, and he took away the draughts, undertaking to get the acceptance of Messrs. Bingham and Co., to whom he toek the draughts, and offered as security a bill of lading for certain goods by the Centurion-1,500 barrels of flour. At the time that he obtained from MKessrs. Bingham and Co. their acCeptance they had already pledged one of the blls of lading to htr. Hubback (one of the largest corn merchants in the towvn), who was entitled to the benefit, sO that the hill of lading in the hands of Messrs. Bingham and Co. was worthless. The defence, ha was told, was that the sending the duplicate bill to Mr. Hubback, was a mistake; and there was also the technical objectfon thst this was not a fraud within the meaning of the Act, the defendant having Only obtained an acceptance, which was not a valuable security. The case of "Rlegina v. Danger," reported In the 29th volume of the Lae Times, would, no doubt, be cited; but, as his wrorship would see, the cases were not identical, as in the case now before the Court the acceptance had been endorsed, and was a valuable security to the Borough Bank. Mr. Brett counsel for the defendant, apprehended that the technical objection must be fatal to the case, and he would therefore make it now and a%ve the Court time, and the parties engaged in the case some pain. So the defendant was charged with obtaining what? An acceptance, amere promise to pay certain moneys on certain conditions, which could not be called a valuable security. Mr. Mansfield.-Was the money paid to the bank? Mr. Aspinall -Yes, bv Messs Bingham and Co. Mr. Mansfield.-It is evident, then, that the acceptance was a valuable security to somebody. The case must proceed. Mr. John Bingham, being sworn, said he carried on businss under the firm of John Bingham and Co., corn merchants. Remembered seeing the two bills of lading (produced) at the office, and understood they were from the Borough Bank. Believed they were endorsed. Sent them back to the Borough Bank unacoepted. Shortly afterwards (on the 13th of May last) Mr. Doherty came to witness, bringing the bills with him. Defendant made a memorandum on a piece of paper and showed it to witness. Had saarched for that paper, but had not been able to find it. Defendant said the Borough Bank had kicked up a devil of a row about the bills going back, and that he had brought up this security, which they (witness's firm) must accept. The securities were bills of lading by the Centurion. He also produced a bill of exchange for 7901., which witness rejected. Defendant, in making the memorandum, assamed the balance of the account would be about 2,2001. as the value of the flour. and the balance of witness's account about 1,0001. The bill for 7901. was put down as a collateral security. Defendant asked witness to accept the bill, and witness's brother did accept it on the security in question. The bill offered had been endorsed. TUpon the faith of those securities his firm consented to accept those bills. WitnesBs brother accepted them in his presence. Witness's firm had since paid the bilUs of exchange. On the arrival of the Centurion they were unable to obtain 1,00 barrels stated in the bill of lading, but they did get 14 barrels. By Mr. Brett -The Centurion arrived on the 22d of May. On the same night the defendant came to witness's house. Had been previously at defendant's office, and had asked bis clerk whether he had two lots of the same brand, as Mr. Hubback had a bil of lading for the same amount. Doherty said it was a mistake-that his clerk had put the wrong bill of lading in Hubback's letter, as he in. tended the corn for Habback and the flour for witness. Witness told him to get it speedily arranged, as he was liable to a criminal prosecution for obtaining money under false pretences. The same evening defendant came to witneEs's private house. He gave no explanation as to how the mistake occurred. He said he found himself in a fix, and he wished to give them security, in order that they might withdraw their claim against the flour, as he was afraid of Hubback. Defendant offered several securities for covering their loss, but witness objected to them, chieflv on the ground that they were not sufficient security. Witness very likely suggested that the defendant should obtain his brother-in-law's (Ur.Richardson'>) security for 2,0001. Went to the defendant's houpe next day to tell him that he would szot be allowed to go by the steamer to America, and while there it was arranged that Richardson should enter into security. Defendant went to America, whence he promised to remit 1, 000. He returned about six weelks ago, and as he had not sent the money this summons was taken out. Mr. William Bingham gave corroborative evidence. Mr. Joseph Hubback said he had a transaction with the defendant which was completed on the 6th, when he received two bllls of lading, accompanied by a letter from the defendant. [Bils of lading produced; one was for the flour per Centurion.] The bills were given to witness as secu. rity. Witness did obtain the flour in pursuance of the bill of lading. [The letter was read. It stated that the enclosed bill of ladingwas for " flour," which Mr. Aspinall urged was conclusive against the plea of mistake that the defendant's clerk had enclosed the biUl of lading for the flour in mistake for some Indian corn.] Cress-examined by Mr. Brett.-Mr. Eichardson called upon witness on behalf of the defendant and Mr. Bingham, for the purpose of getting something from witness for Mr. Bingham, and witness subsequently saw Mr. John Bingham in the matter. They wished witness to give Mr. Bingham 5001. out of the proceeds of this flour; but he declined to do so. Mr. Edward Bell, eecurity clerk at the Borough Bank, produced letters written by Mr. Doherty to the Borough an enclosing the bills of exchange. Mr. Brett. In replying, said this transaction had hitherto been known in all its circumstances, to aU parties, who had treated it as a civil matter, and therefore, now that there might be some ditficulty in obtaining a verdict in a civil actLon, the Court would assist them in trausforming it into a case for oriminal proseeution. He proceeded to argue that the duplicate biU of lading for the flour had been seat to Mr. Hubback ia mistake, it being Mr. Doherty's intention to have let Mr. Huibback have the Indian corm. As t o this charge, it never would have been brought, had Mtessrs. 8inghann's caim been satisfied. They had made every possible aSttmpt to get their claim covered, and finding they could not do so theg determined to prosecute. The very fact of Mr. Doherty returning from America was sufficient to show that he at least was innocent of any criminal intention. For the purpose of showing how the mistake had arisen, he called Mr. Owen Corr, clerk to Mr. Doherty, who said the defendant was one of the largest importers of produce in Liverpool, and a great many bills of lading were passing through his office every day. The duplicates were put on a file and the originals kept in a drawer. A great number of the originals were taken from the drawer almost every day ia tbe course of business. B-tAween the9th and 13th of May there were somebills of lading pertbeAndrewFosterinthedrawer. It was then known that that vessel was lost. Those bills, not being required, were put upon the file. Shortly before the bill in question (per Centurion) was handed from the drawer the bills per Andrew Foster were taken from the file and put into the drawer by Kr. Doherty. 'The Ceuthrion was reported to have cleared out from New York on the 25th of ApriL In reply to Mr. Aspinall witness said that several statements made a fortnight before these transactions to the Borough Bank by Mr. Doherty were, he believed, incorrett. At that time Mr. Doberty was very much Fpreseed for money. When he went to Amnerica Mr. Daherty left only a pound or so with witness to carry on the busiLess. He returned to surrender under an order in btakuptoy. In forwarding a bill of lading it would be necess iry to examine it for the purpose of ascertaining its worth. Mr. Aispinall having briefly replied, Mr. Mnsfield said he could not undertake to dispove ov so imporsant casa on so elight a hearing, involving, as it did, point8 which would require tho greatest legal acnmem to determine. The subitaanti2 matters in the case, as stated by tho. lsarned counsel for the prosecation, had, he thooght, bfcn cnapWetely borne out; and un&-r the circumstances, disprgzble g the duty was, be had no xther course to adopt tharxfo send the case for trial at the asozes, allowing tho defendant the P7iviege of bail, himself in 2,0001, and two sureties in I 1,0001,ec. cub.
RAILTAY IYrNTLLIGENCE. t ' h METROPOETTAY. Tne halt yearly meeting ofthis' ompai was held eater. lay at 'be offloes, Great George-skeet, W'e minster. r, L oulpz in the chair. The report stated that the nWt1+tions with the Great We,tern and Great Northern %ilway Companies did not lead to a satisfactory result. The Bill for the extension of time had receiyed the Royal assent. The -whole of the powers of the oompany are therefore intact for another year, and the directors are consequently in a position to enter into arrangements with any persons who may desire to possess the powers enjoyed by the company. The reasons which induced the promotion of the ine, and obtained for it the sanction of the Legislature and the cooperation of the Great Western Railway Company, have been not only generally recognized, but have grown in public estimation, from the repeated investigations to which they have been since subjected, and from the additional evidence which sabsequent experience has furnished. The Postoffice having undertaken the carrisge of book and small parcels has re;,dered the new line the more necessary for the accommodation of that department. The openinz of the cattlemarket at Copenhtagen-fields has created a necessity for the railway to connect the cattlemarket with the dead meat-markets in the city. The extensive use of the North London Railway for goods has demonstrated the advantage wbich a simaar extension for the accommodation of the goods traffic of the Great Western and Great Northern Rsilways will prove to those companies. The large accession to the street traffic which has since grown upon the already overcrowded thorough. fares of the metropols has increased the urgency of the demand for the relief which this line will in that respect afford; andthe increased use of the cheap above-bridge rver steamers, coupled with the immense passenger traffic of the North London Railway, has confirmed the expectation of the great number of persons who will avail themeelves of the facilities of the Metropolitan Railway. The directors caU the attention of the proprietors of the Great Wetern Railway Company seriously to these matters, and urge upon them not to allow the opportunity to be lost whtch this line affords of remedying what is very generally oonsidered the patent defect in their systemnamely, the remotencEs of the Paddington station from the city nd the busier parts of the metroplis, and which is alone, perhaps, sufficient to account for the depression of their undertaking. The directors have settled the large olaims for professional services that had accrued during the four years which have elapsed since the incorporation of the company, the gentlemen concerned having, in consideration of the circumstaunces in which the company as I-v - b duetio in the amounts respectively claimed by them. The accounts still Qutstanding are bat few and of small amount, and the directors see no reason to a'ter materialy che opinion expressed at the last meeting that the ultimate I losswould not exceel 6. per share, Looking, however, to the large amount borrowed from the bankers of the company, the directors thought it nocessary, for the safety and rotection of all parties, to make a call of IOs. per sh re. Lu the event of the favourable winding-up, which they confidently anticipate, such call would of course be repaid, in addition to the 14s. per share of tho original deposit of 1U. per share. Thecapital account showed that 147,4831. had been received, and 66,24S1. expended, leaving a balance of 81,2351., consisting of 71,250L in the hands of the Ac. countant-General, 3,1101. due by the Royal British Bank, and 5,5'S. at the bankers. The balance nowin the bands of the Accountant General, after payment of the July dividends, amounts to 84,5o51. The Ciu isium, in moving the adoption of the report, reminded the proprietors that at the last half-yearly meeting a distinct understanding was come to between the directors and the shareholders that a final effort should be made to induce the Great Western to do something to insure the carrying out of the undertaking, either by way of additional subscriptions or by taking shares; and it was also hoped that the Great Northern might be induced to exercise the power they had from Parliament to raise aasum of money to make that part of the line between the Great Western terminus and the city. The negotiations entered into with those companies, though carefully conducted, had entirely failed. The letter received from Mr. Saunders, the secretary of the Great Western Board, declining to afford any assistance, being conclusive as to that company, the directors felt that it would be idle to incur further expense to do that whichx appeared indispensable to the development of the Great Western system. The opinion of the board asto the necessity of the line was unaffected by anything that had taken place ; on the contrary, every circumstance that had arisen had only tended to confirm them in the conviction of the absolnte necessity of such an undertaking being carried out at no very distant period. That opinion, too, was Ehared by all men of experience in railway matters, The late chairman of the Eastern Counties Railway, at the meeting of that company on Friday last, urged the importance of metropolitan connexion strongly upon his late colleagues at the board and the shareholders, as being a great advantage to that company, and, if to the EIastern Counties, howmuch more so was it to the Great Western, the London and North-Western, and the Great Northern 7 He had no doubt that many gentlemen present had had their attention drawn to the figures showing thc progressive condition of the capital and earningsof the great metropolitan railway companies-the increase in the mileage, and the earnings per mile; and had observed the dsagreeable-position occupied by the Great Western in the scale of comparison-a position which he believed was mainly attributable to the fact that they had no city termninus. (Eesr, hear.) The necessity for such a terminus for the lines north of the Thames seemed to be generally recognized. But when the directors found themselves In a position in which they could not carry it out in a manner which they considered consistent with the interest of the shmreholdera they decided upon asking their consent to an application to P.rliament for a BiUl to authorize the return of the large sams deposited wi-h the Accountant-General preparatory to winding up the concern, should that step become necessary, and it was proposed to submit a resolation to the present meeting to that effect. (Rear, hear,) When they arrived at this stage of the proceedings the directors thought it right to wind up all outstanding liabilities of the company, knowing that that could be done much more advantageously while the company was alive than at the last stage of its existence, when they would be pounced upon by any creditor and made to pay to the last farthing. As it was, they had been enabled to compromise mai)y of the claims, and he was bound to say that the compromises they had offered evidenced great li'erality on the part of the gentlemen with whom they had been made. They had now no outstanding liabilities, or rather he should say that every remaining liability might be met by something short of 1,0001. He would not dweeU on the disturbing circumstances which had contributed so far to the failure of a project which at one time was so promising. The state of the money-market, the Russian war, and, in fact, almost every possible circumstance seemed to have intervened to prevent the suocess of the undertaking. The position, too, of the two great companies, the Great Western and the Great Northern, had had a depreciating effect on the prospects of the Metropolitan Railway. As dividends went down the directors of those companies were naturally averse from submaitting to their sbareholders' proposal for epending large sums of money in carrying out other undertakings whiob, however valuable to them, were not likely to be regarded favourably at such a time. (Hear.) He regarded theloss of this metropolitan line as a national one. Re did nob believe that anotber opportunity would occur of carrying itoatupon equally favourable terms. He did not believe, if their powers of this present Act were allowed to lessen, that they would ever again obtain a Bill which would be accompanied with so small an amount of risk, or that they would be able to secure so large an area of land as they had now at their disposal for a terminus in the heart of the city of London. (Hear, hear.) It was, therefore, with deep regre. that he had to announce the concusion at which the board had arrived. (Hear, hear.) The resolution for the adoption of the report having basn seconded, hr. W. A. WILRINs81 confessed he was surprised that even in these times there was not sufficient confidence on the part of the public in a scheme which appearod to him to be fraught with advantage to all parties concerned. (Hear, hear.) All railway oompanies had made mistakes, bat what he woald point out was that, if not the directors, at all events the shareholders of the Great Western were deeply interested ian the proceedings of this company, and that their present position wns owing in a great measure to that want which the Metropolitan Railway would have supplied. He then entered into an elaborate statement with a view to show that it was not the new brancaes of the Great Western Company that had reduced its dividend so low as 1 per cent., but the want of a city terminus such as the Metropolitan Railway, if constructed, could afford them. A very long and animated discussion ensued, in which Mr. Jones, dir. C. Pearson, Mr. Ayrton, and other shareholders took part. The utility of the undertaking in developing the property of 'the corporation of London and thetraffic of the Great Western and Great NorthernRailway Companies was strongly urged; but it was held that without the assistance and hearty co-operation of those bodies it would be a folly for the existing shareholders to proceed with the undertaking. It was proposed by Mr. Pearson that the scheme should be divided into two undertakings, leaving to the Great Western, if they pleaeed, to make the extension from Paddington to King's-cross, there to ioin the Citv terminus lin5 The report and statement of accounts were adopted. Mr. W. A. Wilkinson and Dr. Challis were requested by the meeting to join the board, and on a show of hands were unanimously elected directors of the company, with the understanding that they should be at liberty to retire from the board wvhenever they pleased. On the motion of Mr. AYRTON, a resolution was passed authorizing the directors to take the neesary steps for making application to Parliament in the next session for power to dissolve and wind up the company, unles3 in thae meantime they should make arrangements for the disposal of the company's property. A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concladed the proceedings. WEST LONDON. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held ycs%ir. day at the London Tavern, Mr. S. Bird in the chair. Mr. Turquand, the secretary, read the report, which stated that at the half-yearly meeting of the company on the 10th of March last a resolution waz passed authorizing a dividend of 2. per share to be paid to the S&st-olass preferred shareholders. A sum of 6,4001. was thus distributed. The directors recommend a further division of 11. par sharo among the holders of firatdclass preference sharos. The directors are unable to state what auoaunt may haveto be ref unded by the London and North-Western Railway Com.

The half-yearly meeting of this company waS held yesterday at the office, Gresham-house, Old Broad-atreet, 3r. W. Tite, 1!tP., In the chair. Mr. Harris, the secretary, read the report, an abstract of which appeared in The limes of Monday. The capital account showed that 497,8371. had been reoeived and 494,3341 expended, leaving a balance of 3,5031. in favour of the company. The revenue account showed a net balance of -5,5W4L, after deductiDg 4461. for expenses * The CHAiRmA., in moving the adoption of the report, said the line was leased to Mr. Brasssy for seven years, at 12,0004 a-year, five years of which were now unexpired. ey had, therefore, 12,0001. a-year to pay expenses, interest on loans, and dividend on preference shares They were also entitled to half the profits when the receipts increased so as to admit of a surplus profit beyond the 12,0001. a-year. The falling off in the dividend on the orc'inary shares was caused by the high rate of interest theybad to pay on borrowed money. They expected that they should have been able to raise aU the money they wanted at about 4X per cent., but owing to the state of the money-market they could not do so, and they had been obliged to create a redeemable 6 per cent. preference stock. A short time ago they had borrowed 20,0001. at 5 per cent. to replace onds falling due at 44 per cent. The proposed dividend on the ordinary stock was at the rate of l8s. per cent. per annum, and that would absorb all the balanc, to within 21. They had no occasion, however, to make any reserve. The traffic was affected in the eArly part of the year in consequence of an unusual continuance of-wet weather; and as compared with the receipts of the preceding year, which were increased by movements resulting from the war, a decreae was shown. It was intended by the Admiralty to form a harbour of refuge somewhere on the west coast, which would tend to increase their traffic. The receipts on the Bideford extension had increased, and it was from that line they should look for an increase of their traffic. He would be happy to answer any questions respecting the affairs of the company. Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividend on the ordinary stock at the rate of 1s& per cent par nm.n, and Rt tbh rAte of 32s. per cent. per annum on the B stock; authorizing the recommendamons ot the committee to be carried out in respact to the disposal of certain forfeited shares, and the merging of 34,0001. not entitled to dividend. The proceedings concluded with a vot of thanks to the chairman and directors. BIDEFORD EXTENSION. The half-yearly meeting of this Compiany was held yesterday at Gresham-house, Mr. Braginton in the chair. The report stated tbat the continued high rate of interest and value of money had precluded the possibility of issuing any of the unappropriated shares o. the company, which, with 6711. arrears of calls, amount to 18,3211., and in consequence the rent received from Ur. Braesey has been *ap. propriated towards the diseharge of the debts of the company. Every pending, dispute or difference has been adjuated without litigation. The contractor's claims and extra bill have been referred to Mr. Tite, but from his engagements he has been aunable to make his award. The amount, however, be it what it may, is to be taken iu shares. The accounts showed that 47,2151. had been received, and that 18,3211. remaineA due. To meet this there were 1,765 shares not issued, 6711. due on calls, and the rent from the line. The payments to the 30th of June amounted to 50,4101. On the motion of the CAIRmxA., seconded by Mr. CAMrPON, the report was adopted. It was stated that the rent of 2,2501. a-year paid by Mr. Brassey was appropriatedto the payment of the debts of tibe company, and therefore they could not pay any dividead at present. ThA proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors. LANOASIIRE AND YORKSHIRE. The directors of this company state in their report that the total amount of sbare and mortgage capital chargeable on revenne for the half-year ending the 30th of June last, excluding leased lines, is as follows:-Ordinary capital 9.206,3601.; guaranteed 6 per cent., 794,0001. ; loans, 3 333 3261 . moneys in advance of calls, 54,0181. ; total,' 13,37,7441. The expenditure on capital account during the half-year has been 1.52,9091., of which 51,4054 was for working stock, and 21,434f. expended on the main line. The receipts of the company on revenue account during the last half-year have been 610,7141., less 10.170G. received for working the Blackburn line, 600,537b The receipts on the Lancashire and Yorkshirpoer amounted to 573,2691. against 532,6041. in the same half of 1856, and the working and other expenses amounted to 229.1571. against 208 7151. The number of passengers conveyed was 3,749,732 against 3,153,571, showing an increase of 596,161, or 18'90 per cent. The increase in the miles travelled was 1339 per cent. The tons of merchandise conveyed were 1,633,254 against 1,545,318, or an increase of 87,936 tons, or 5 69 per cent., and in the miles travelled 2 79 per cent. The earnings per passenger were 13 80d. against 1446d.; and per ton of goods 5170d. against 52-54d. Each passenger was carried on the average 10 77 miles against 1130 niles at the same period of 1856, and each ton of goods 23 85 miles against 24i52 milcs. The result of the working of the railway for the past halfyear the direetors consider to be favourable, the receipts for passenger traffc showing an increase of 25,5621. over the correspon dg period of last year, the receipta for mcrhbandise traffic showing an increase of 13,5481.; which latter is satisfactory, owing to the depressed state of trde. The working experses of the company compaze favourably with the corresponding date of last year, being ncw 4085 per cent. ogainst 41t58 per cent. at that date. The rolling stock of tbe company has been maintained in a state of efficiency. The directors have continued their efforts to reduce expenses in all departments, but so as not to interfere with the safe and efficient working of the lines. In the locomotive department the consumption of fuel is considerably reduced, and a number of experiments are now being made which, it is hoped, will be productive of further benefit to the company. The renewalof the permanent way ha been vigorouisly prosecuteddaring the half-year,and, the new rails being laid with what are termed " fish joints," the directors believe that the company is in course of having aline of read which will compare advantageously with any in the kingdom. The balance of revenue -pplhcable to the payment of interest and dividends and other fixed chares is 371,2481. It is recommended that a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. pei annum,deducting incometax, be declared, leaving a snrplus of 8591. for next account. Theagreement with the East Lancashire Railway Company, which was resolved upon at the last half-yearly meeting, for the interchange of traffiGpending theamalgamation of thetwo companies has proved in its working agreat convenience to tbe Dublic, by its having induced a system of through. hooking for passengers and a running tbrough of carriages atd waggons which could not otherwise have been secured; it has also caused a saving in working expenses, but the full extent of the saving which is anticipated cannot be realized untU the amalgamation is completed. The capital account showed that 13,437,0201. had been received and 13,521,1731. expended, leaving a balance against the company of 84,1521. WEST CORNWALL. The report of the directors states that the traffic, as compared with the corresponding period of 1856, shows an increase on every branch except copper ore, on which there is a serious falling off. The expected addition to the traffic from the landing and shipping of merchandise at the company's wharf at Truro has been realized to a limited extent, and is steadily progressing. The working expenses of the half-year show a serious increase in tho three items of "carrying account," "locomotive account," and "maintenance of way and works." Towards the close of last year a series of accidents occurred on the line by the erxgines repeatedly running off the rails, fortunately wthout injury to any passengers or tbe company's servants, but doing serious damage to the eDgines and rolling stock. With a view to prevent a recurrence of any such accidents Ur. Brunel, at the request of the company, and Captain Tyler, R.E., by direction of the Board of Trade, have inspected the line, and on their joint suggestion alterations have been made in the engines, a superior quality of iron has been used in the manufacture of the rails, a greater amount of ballast has been laid inder them and the ioints have been secured with additional rivets. After full consideration it has been resolved to charge at once to the half-year's revenue the whole cost incurred in repairing and repl cing the roiling stock, and in respect of the ballasting and relaying the line a sum of 2,0001. has been charged against the half-year, which it is believed is considerably in excess of the fair charge for maintenance. The wor1ks on the -Cornwall line continue to progress ateadily, and it in expected that the first half of the bridge across the Tamar at Saltash will be floAtted to its place at the commencement of next month. The revenue account for the last half-year shows the otalreceipts to bare been 14,260Z., and the expenditure 10,802, leaving a balance of profit of 3,4581. The balance of the general revenue account shows a sum of 4,843&. to the credit of the company. The capital account shows a total receipt of 61B,8651., and expenditure of 515,1011., leaving a balance of 7641. SOUTH DUIRHAM AND LANCASHIRE. The "first sod" of this line was cut on Tuesday at Kirkby Stephen, in Westmnoreland, with the usual festive auxiliaries. The railway thus commnenced will complete the connexion between the east and west coast, across Darbam, Westmoreland, and Lancashire. Its capital is 375,0001. for 44 rniles, and tho proposal is to make a junction with the Stockton and -Darlington on the east and the Lancaster and Carlisle on the west. The former company bas already agreed to work the line under very favourable circumstances, and conditionally to purchase or lease at a gnaranteed rent of 6 per cent. The line will, it is expected, derive its principal trade from minerals and merchandize, but as a feeder to the already large iron trade of the Stookton and Darlington, and as a medium of trade communication between the north-eastern shipping ports for the continent and the manufacturing districts of ILncashire, it is considered to have a very good prospect of traffic. SUNDERLAND DOCKS. The anntal meeting of this company was held at Snnder. land on Tnesday, Mr. G. Hadson, M.P., in the chair. The report stafed that the receipts for the half-yearending 30th June last were 19,8U11, while the receipts for tbha corresponding period of 1856 wvere 13,789L, being an increase .of 6,032., or nearly 44 per cent. The nett balance at the dis. p osal of the shareholders, after paying interest on the entire nd debt of87,500, amounts to 8,2741., out of which the direotors recommcended a dividend at the rate of 41. per cent. per annum on the 21. lOs. preference shares; of 51. per cent, per annum on the 61. 5s. preference shares ; acd of 3 per cent. per annum on the original 2;1. shares ; leaving a balance of 154.

THE LATB A CCIDENT ON THE BRIGE TON RAILWAY. A correspondent of the Globe thus corrects our report of the conduct of the Bishop of Oxford on Tuesday last- " A feeling of justice towards an eminent individual induces me to address you. these few lines. " The correspondent of Te TiTmes who notices the acci. dent yesterday on the Brighton Railway takes occasion to speak of the Bishop of Oxford as 'being very active in rendering assistance to his fellow-passengers.' t hNow, s this paragraph might not unnaturaUy give rise the idea that this admirable prelate occupied himself in going among the wounded and alarmed (most of them swomen), and behaving himself as a mere ordinary clergrman might do under the circumstances, I take the earliest opportunity of contradioting a statement every traveller by the train in question knows to be inaccurate. " The Bishop of Ozford did no such thing-not for a moment did he lose sight of the far higher importance to society and the church of his own safety, and, I may add, the recovery of his portmanteau, than the soothing the terrifed or comfortino the wounded. And while the telegraph boro instant witness to the frst emotion in the good bishop's mind, I am happy to be able to state, that by the aid of one guard and two porters the second object of pastoral care was secured, and that the bLhop arrived on Ioot at the Reigate station, bag and bag. gage, sound in wind and limb, and ready for the legidatorial 9abours of the evening. "No one who witnessed the incomparable presence of mind of this father of our church wil easily forget it. It was, it still Is, the general theme of respectful remark and admciration, and not even the 'rather foribldemand for compensathon' (spoken of by Dine hTime) for losses he hanot nandergone, andl tho' slight ruffling of a bearisn Ia recently serene and undisturbed, could efface the impression produced by this memorable scene."
THE BRMISH .USBUAM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIM3S, Sir,-I am glad to find my letter has not been Written in vain,' and that some one else has taken upthe subject. Your correspendent "J. (l. B.," appears to have misunderstood the drift of my letter, so I give him perfectly to understand that I did not merely wish to view the reading-room, as he appears to have done but to obtain permission to use the library. Yonr correspondent of to-day, who signs himself "Fiat Justitia," says he cannot join me in mygrumbling; but if the case is as he says-viz., that he with nobody half so important as the tttor of a oollege to refer to obtained admission in six days, which I have been trying at in vain for six months,-I think I have good cause for grumbling because if he considered my reference as good as, or even better than his own, I do not see why they should excludc me and admit him. But here is the mystery. If xine is an isolated case why does not the secretary or librarian, whose business it is, write and explain the reason why they would not admit me? They must have some remembrance of the circumstances. If the fault bo on my side I shall be free to admit it. I am well aware of the value of such a library, and the immense saving of expense It must be to any one who can get admission, and am much disappointed at my failure. Apologizing for again troubling you, and thanking you for the insertion of my first letter, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, JUSTETIA.
FIRx AT BwIxwoN.-Yesterday afternoon a fire sf a serious character, attended with a vagt destruction of property,took place In the premises belonging to Mr. Spratt, a builder and saw-mil proprietor, situate in IAngton.place, Brixton. A most abundant supply of water was inmmedi. ately procured from the Southwark and LambethCompany's mains, from which the firemerL wentto work,but owing to the firm hold the flames had previously obtained, it was found im. possible to check the violence of the fire until the whole of the factory was consumed and aU its valuable contents, not excepting the men's working tools. Tbe saw-mills, ma. chinery, and also the counting-houses are in addition seriously damaged by fire. Several of the firomen narrowly escaped owing to the falling of the walls. Fortunately the sufferer was insured in the Atlas fire-office. TEE ATLANTIC TELEGAAPr.H-Or readers will scarcely require to be told that in a matter of such absorbing interest aq the recent failure of the attempt to counect tho Old and New World we are inundated with suggestions from all quarters for the completion of the great scheme. The following is from a correspondent who does not wish his- letter to appear, though it nevertiheless contains the only sensible and feasible suggestion that has been made. He is very properly of opinion 'that the breaks for regullting tho paymng out of the cable should not be left to the judgment and attention of any man, no matter how great his sulL but that they should be governed by a selfacting apparatus operated on by a float on the surface of the vater, that would, of course, feel the slightest variation in the immersion of the stern of the ship. As this suggestion, next to devising a cable to be paid out without the use of breaks at all, is the most practioal that has yet been made, and as it is perfectly easy to see how the neoe&sary apparatus oould be devised for effecting it, we willingly give it a place in our columns.
