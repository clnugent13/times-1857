BELEXT:rON COMM .& "rEEf At the Sitting oI the Coroitite on SBL_ Jay, The CHAnRgA?f (M¶r. D_ j Said, they were unanimously of opinion tlal the G'4.,o, o bribary had not been made out againt the sitting member. This was ail that would appear upon tho minutes; but, lor the satisfaction of the parties, ho would state the reascus which had induced him to arrive at that conclusion, without presuming to bind any other member of the committee to complete acquieseence in those reasons. The charges made by the petitioner were -first, that the sitting member had been guil'ty of bribery by paying the travelling expenses of nine voters who had voted for him; secondly, that he had been guilty of bribery by colourably employing, as messengers, seven voters who voted for him, and who rendered no adequate services for the remuneration given them. With regard to the first point, as the law stood before the Corrupt Practices Act, the payment of such expenses made eond ilde, and not as a cloa forbribery, was perfectly legaL Although expenses of this nature had been notoriously paid at elections no member had ever been unseated by reason thereof, and there was no decision of a court of law that a payment of such a nature was opposed to the provisions or the policy of tho law. Then it was contended that, under the recent Act against corrupt practices at electiQns, the payment of traveling expenses was ilegal, aud that Mr. Steuart had brought himself within the first section of that Act. The first branch of that section related to promises made to voters, and the second branch related to acts done. His own impression of the law was, that the statuto had not made the onad ffde payment of traveling expenses ilegal. The subject, however, had been under the consideratlon of the Exchequer Chamber in the celebrated case of "Cooperv. Slade" (6 Ell. and Bl., 447). The case dis. tinctly decided that a promise of a candidate to pay the travelling expenses of a voter, and the subsequent payment in pursuance of such a promise, was perfectly legal. It deCided also that the promise to pay and the subsequent pay. ment would be iUegal if the promise were accompanied by a condition that the person to whom it was made should vote for the candidate by whom the promise was made. In other words, an unconditional promnse to pay the voter the traveling expenses incurred by him in going to and retarn. img from the place of polling was not within the first clause of the section, and the subsequent payment in pursuance of such promise was not within the second branch of the section. Accepting the law as laid down in that case, was there sufficient evidence here to show that it had been violated by Mr. Steuart 1 The committee ought to be very fully satisfied on that point before they decided against Mr. Steuart; since, if guilty, he would be liable to punishment by fine and imprisonment for misdemeanour; and, though the decision of the committee would not have the effecb of punishing him, stil it would prevent him from sitting in this Parliament forthe borough of Cambridge. Ithad notbeen alleged In this case that the payment of travelling expenses had been made a cloak for bribery, or that any one of the persons paid received more than the expenses actually incurred by Emm, but it was alleged that the promise to pay was made in such a manner as to bring the case within the rule laid dowsn by the Court-that is, it was conditionalupon the voters' voting for Mr. Steuart. Now, it appeared that Colonel Adairs party had resolved not to pay travelling expenses, and they very fairly communicated that resolution to the agent of their opponent, and apprised him at the same time that such payments would beillegal andwouldbe goodgronnd for a petition. Upon this it appeared that Mr. Macaulay and Mr. Steuart gave express directions to their agent (Mr. Barlow) to keep within the limits of the law; and in order that this might be done a case was laid before counsel, who fuly set forth,in hisopinion,thelawaslaiddownin "Cooper v. Slade," aud impressed upon the person consultinghim the necessityof caution. There was no doubt thatevery caution had beenused, and c&rehadbeentakenbythesittingmember's committee to avoid any act that should make the payment of expenses illegal, or should deprive Mr. Steuart of his seat. The opinioa of the committee upon all the evidence laid before them was that the facts of this case did not show a conditional promise on the part of Mr. Steuart's committee, but that the promise to pay and the payment of expensos, had been made in a perfectly legal manner by Mr. Steuar;. Then, as to the payment of the messengers,the evidence went to show that a larger number of messengers had been employed than was necessary; but there was no proof that inadequate services had been rendered; the messengers had been paid no more than the messengers on the other side. It appeared that Messrs. Macaulay and Steuart's committee had employed 74 messengers, while 35 only had been engaged by Messrs. Adair and Ribbert. The committee woul giea no opinion as to the necessity of employing so many, sin a in this case it was not proved that the employment of those who were voters was such as to bring the case within the rule laid down by the Leicester committee as to the inade. quate services for the payment received. For these reasons he thought that the case against the sitting member had failed. The committee then proceeded to a scrutiny of votes, commencing with the case of CharleslHarrison. This voter had plumped for Mr. Steuart, and had afterwards received 11. 14s. for his expenses to Gravesend and back, in consideration, it was alleged of the vote he had given. The ComsiTTEE after hearing Harrison's evidence, held that the expenses had been paid bonzd ide and that the sitting momber was justified in paying them. The next case was that of John Halsey, to whom 1l. had been paid for travelling to Isleworth and back, and evidence vas given to the effect that this voter had never been to Isleworth, but had remained in Cambridge the vhole time of tho election. It was proved on the other hand that the money had been paid in consequence of a false representation on the part of Halsey, and that his imposition had not been discovered until some time after the money had bean handed over. The CosrFrrrxs held that there was no proof that the money had been paid as a bribe to the voter, The man had evidently obtained the money under false pretences. The vote must, however, be struck out, as in their opinion it came within the mischief against which the Act was directed. It was no doubt a case of great hardship against the sitting member. The committee adjourned until 12 o'clock this day. MARLBOROUGH. On the reassembling of the committee at U o'clock on Saturday morning the question of Mr. H. B. Baring's qualification was again discussed, the argument in support. of the petition being that in consequence of Mr. Baring's connexion with the British Bank the judgments which had been entered up against that bank operated as a disqualification Mr. Edward James, Mr. Rodwell, and Mx. J. N. iggins appeared for the petitioner. Mr. Edwin Jamese Mr. Picker. ing ,and another learned gentleman for the sittmg member. The committee, after deliberating th closed doors for nearly two hours, agreed to a resolution that Mr. H. B. Baring was duly qualified. They refused, however, to declare that the petition was frivolous and vexatious, and directed that each party should pay its own Costs, PONTMBFRACT. At the meeting of the committee on Saturday morning the examination of Mr. Robinson, the manager of the Yorkshire Bank at Pontefract, was conitinued. The witness was subjeoted to a long and searching examination by Mr. Serjeant PIGoTT, with the view of showing that he had unduly used his influence as manager of the bank to induce the customers of the bank, and particularly those who were in. debted to it, to vote for the sitting member. The learned serjeant was, however, unable to extract any admission from the witness that he had acted in the manner alleged. A list o' the names of 50 customers of the bank who had voted for the sitting member was put into his hands, but in every single case he denied flatly that he had said or done anything to induce them to vote for Mr. Wood. Th case mainly relied on was that of one Airey, a brikclayer, who, it appeared, being indebted to the bank to the amount of 1501. at the time of the election, and having voted for Oliveira and Milnesin spite of warnings which he had receivedof the consequences, was, two or three days after the polling day, served with a writ by the bank, and consequently had to make an asgnment of his property, and sell it at a great loss. The witness however, denied that there was any connexion between the serving of the writ and the adverse vote of Airey. It was served as an ordinary matter of business, and had been issued some time previous to the election. Airey had overdrawn his account 1461., and the securities iu the hands of the bank being only worth about 1101. as witness calculated, he was anxious to compel Airey to pay up about 401., so as to reduce his account within the limit of the value of the securities, and it was for that purpose the wrib was issued. He was not aware when he directed the solicitor of the bank to serve the writ which way Airey had voted. He had heard that the securities beld by the bank when sold under Airey's assignment had realized 1841- The witness was also examined as to an alleged case of treating by the sitting menmber, but it did not amount to more than this. The sitting member during his canvass diued with the witness and one or two other of his principal supporters at an Odd Fellows' Lodge, or a Benefit Society of some kind. The ordinary drink at the dinner was ale, hut the sitting member ordered a bottle of wine, which he passed on to those who were sitting see^r him. James Aoy, abriclclayer, living nearPontefract, was next called, and, in answver to questions from r. JA=us, he said that shortly before the election Mr. Wood, the sitting member, accompanied by Mr. Sidney Wolff and Mr. Carter, the solicitor to the bank, had called upon him to canvass him for his vote. He hatt declined top-r-omise it to them, and after renewed solicitations, to which he was equally deaf, they left him, Mr. Carter saying to him as he went out, "Well, it will be worse for you, then." Shortly after this Mr. Sidney Wolff called upoa him alone when he was on his work,: and after again asing him to vote for Wood and being denied, he said, " Mind, you are indebted to the bank." Witness asked who had told him so, and he said, Mr. Robinson (the manager.) Witness said he should makeo about it, as he thought it rather a curious case for the manager to tell that to any one, and then Wolff endeavoured to turn it off, saying that it was Carter who had told him, On the polling day Wolff came to witness in the wool market as he was going to the poling-booth, and asked him to vote for Wood. Witness said he should not, as he was going to vote for Oliveira and Milnes. " It will be worse for you, then," said Wolff. "How can that be " replied the witness, "All you can do to me is to take away my work." (Witness was then executing a contract for Wolff). *To this Wolff made answer " You shal- be obliged to sell your property." Witness then went off and vo for Milnes and Oliveira. On the Monday after the election, which took place on Saturday, witness was served with a writ by Carter on account of the bank. He had had no notice that it was intended to take proceedings against him. In consequonce of the writ being served on him other creditors came down on him, and he was obliged to make an assignment and sell the houses on which the bank had a mortgae as security for his debt. The amoant of his debt was 1461., and the houses fetched 1841 In the course of the examination of this witness the question was raised by Mr. JAME whether, under the new Act, evidence of undue influence could be given without first proving agency. This may be done in cases of bribery, and Mr. James solicited a decision of the committee as to whetlwr it mig b; al bo done in ca kes of =duve idusg The poinl, hOid, was Of very great importance and must, be decid one way or the other very soon. The Coaurrsr', however, intimated their opinion that the agency of Mr. Sidney Wolff for the purposes of canvasding Airey was sufficiently proved; consequently no decision was given on the point raised by the learned counsel. Edward Airey, son of the last witness, examined by Mr. Serjeant PIGOTT, said that he had beea canvased a great many times-it would be hard to count how many-by Mr. Wol He declined to promise. At last Mr. Wolff told him that he must be " hanging back for bribery." Witness did not te' him that he was or that he wasn't. (Laughter.) Wolff told him that if he would vote for Wood he would give him 101., and that probably Ifr. Wood would help him to the means of getting to Australia,whitherhewas desirous of going. The u10. was to be paid as soon as the poll was closed, for Wood said hedurst not payit before. Wolff saw witness going to the poll, and said to him, " Mind what I told you the other day." Iu spite of this promise witness went and voted for Wilnes and Oliveira, le his father. Wolff followed him to the poll-booth, and alter be bad voted went up to the poll clerk and asked him to do something-what witness could not hear. The clerk made answer, "I can't, its bribery." Edward James, an innkeeper at Knottingley, was examined as to the scene which took place between Wolff and the elder Airey on the morning of the polling day. He came up to Airey, took hold of him by the arm, and asked him to vote for Wood. Airey would not, and they talked at one another until both got irritated5 and at last Wolff said, with a menacing gesture, " Well, if you don't it shall be worse for you. f'1 mark you, Airey, you shall have your houses to sell." Airey then walked off to the poll. The committee adjourned at 3 o'clock until this day. ROCEDALE. This committee met again on Saturday morning. The counsel present during the day were Mr. Monck and Mr. Vaughan for the petitioners, and Mr. Phiun for the sitting member. John allone, a voter for tho, borough of Rohdale, stated that on the dlay before the nomination Thomas Renessey ofrered him 51. if he would vote for Sir A. Ramsay. He refused to accept the bribe, andpolled for Mr. Miall Daniel Nutt grocer, proved that during tho week before the election Richard Mills offered him 10l. if he would go away from Rochdale during the election. He was a supporter of Mr. Miall, and had refused to give Mls a pledge that he would not vote for that gentleman. In cross-examination the witness said that he regarded the offer of 10s. as a joko. John Hlolt, woollen: printer, Moleaworth-street, Rochdale, stated that tthetime of theelectionhe owed1614s. 4d. for half-a-year's ground rent of his premises to Mr. J. S. Entvnsle, of Fox.holes, the brother-n-lawr of Sir A. Ramsay. During theweekbefore the electionAbrahamu Rhodes, Mr. Entwisle's agent, offered that if he would vote for Sir X. Rarsay he wonld excuse him the payment of these arrear Richard Hughes, clothesdealer Hatton-garden, Liverpool, was in the flst of voters for Rnchdale, at the last election, during which he was in Liverpool. On the day before the poll at Roohdale John Riley came tohim at Liverpool, and brought a letter from his wife informing him that she had received 5h on condition that he would go to Rochdale and vote for Sir A. Iarsay. He refused to do so, and neither voted nor went to Bochdale. Joseph WhiteheadLawton, a printer and stationer, stated that he and his partner had purchased a plant and stock iE those trades from John Mills, the brother of Richard Mils. in December, 1855. Part of the purchase money they paid in cash, and for the remainder, 100Z., they gave a promissory note. John MilUs died in January, 1857, and at the time of the election this note was held by his silter, Mary lls. On the 27th of March he saw Mary MilUs near his shop. She asked him to vote for Sir A. Ramsay. He refused to do so, and she then said that the would have her money, for no one who voted for MiaU should have a halfpenny of hers. A few days after the election he received a letter from Messrs. Whitehead and Sons, the attorneys of Mary Mills, and he and his partner were obliged to pay off the promissory note. Mr. Thomas Livesey, cotton-spinner, and alderman of Rochdale, was called and examined at considerable length by Mr. MoNCm as to the proceedings at varlous meetings of electors, and of the Reform Association, at which resolutions were agreed to In support of Mr. MiaUl. Mr. Monck was about to examine him as to the proceedings at a meeting of non-electors, but Mr. Phinn obiected that this would not be evidence, and the committee decided in favonr of his objection. Mr. IUvesey was then examined as to his dedings with Daley an Rothwell. He corroborated the accounts given by those witnesses, stating further, in regard to Rothwel, that he lent him ol. in Rochdale for which he received an I 0 U, and that his only reason lor taking him to France was a fear that if he remained inLondon he might be tampered with by the op.posite party. The counsel for the petitioners were not prepared with other witnesses, and at half-past 2 o'clock the committee adjourned until U o'clock this (Monday) morning. WAREJIAML On Saturday the co nmittee entered into a scrutiny of the votes which made up the majority of Mr. Caicraft, the sittilng member. Counsel for the petitioners, Mr. xI Smith and Mr. J. Clark; for the sitting member, Mr. James, Mr. Phinn, and Mr. Welsby. The committee were occupied the whole of the day in the consideration of the case of one Davis, who had voted for Mr. Calcraft. It appeared from the statements of Davis that he had always, until the last election, voted for Mr. Drax, the Liberal candidate, but that previous to the last election his wife communicated to him certain conversations she had had with Mr. Pike, a merchant of the borough, and his employer, and in consequence of that communication he voted for Mr. Caloraft for fear of losing his situation. Mrs. Davis stated that Mr. Pike had threatened to throw her husband out of employment unless he voted for Mr. Calcraft, and had also said that he need not trouble himself about the arrears of rent which he owed to Mr. Drax, who was his landlord. On the other side Mr. Pike, who was an active supporter of Mr. Calcraft, was caUed, and denied that he had ever used any threats, or made any promises to Davis or his wife vith a view to influencing Davis's vote. Ie stated that Mrs. Davis's account of the intcerviews she had had with him previous to the election were untrue, and produced a document with the mark of Davis attached, the effect of which was entirely to exculpate him from the charge of intimidation. Davis had affixed his mark to this document when he was perfectly sober. The committee ultimately struck out Davis's vote, and, after a short conversation as to the order in which the remainder of the evidence should be taken, adjourned until 11 o'clock this (Monday) morning. MAYO (COUNTY). The committee proceeded with the hearlng of evidence In support of the petitioner's case at 11 o'clock on Saturday morning. Counsel for the petitioner-Mr. O'Maley, Mr. Edwan James, and Mr. Hale; for the sitting member-Mr. hi Smith, Mr. Karalake, and Mr. Buchanan. Mr. John Burke, who was under examination at the adjournment of the committee on Friday, continued his evidence.-My father did not vote. The mob wished to swear him before letting him go, but Conway said there 'was no necessity for that, as he had tledged his honour as a gentleman not to vote. I returned home with my father. Either before or after this Conway said, " It is a shame for a Roman Catholio gentleman to be acting oontrary to the wishes of his priests." We went towards home, accom. panied by the mob, a man being on each side of the horses' zeins, holding them, and men holding me and my father by the knees. Conway was on the car. We met some carts laden with hay and straw, ane the mob caled out that they belonged to Colonel Higgins. They scattered the hay and strawi shout the road. ~When we drove up Conway said in a Jocular tone, "Oh, boys, don't scatter the hay and straw." Mr. E. JA3izs.-I suppose in the tone in which he would have said, " Don't pump upon him," if he had wished them to pump upon any one? (Laughter.) Witness.-The effect on my mind, and, I believe, on the mind of the mob, was that it was a direction to scatter the hay and straw. We met the military escort under charge of Mr. Shiel, a stipendiary magistrate, and I informed him what had been done to my father. The mob had then left us. The stipendiary magistrate requested us to go back to Ballinrode to swear an information, but my father refused. I am a magistrate. Cross-examined by Mr. M. Sov.-I was made a magistrate in lFebruary last. Conway was on horseback when we met the mob. When I asked Conway to let us go home he said, " Oh, I will take care of you 3" and he also said, "rul give you as good a bed and as good a dinner as you have got at home," or words to that effect. My father said he would notvote for Colonel Higgins if Conway would lethim go home before Conway spoketohimontheaubjeet. The mob appeared to belong to the lower olass-the labouring poor. I think my father spoke about the voting afeer Conway had spoken about the dinner and the bed. Conway sat on the car by my father's side; Conway and the mob accompanied us for Iabout a-quarter of a mile. Conway shook hands with my rather and myself when we parted. I was one of the per. sons who made an affidavit in consequence of which the poll was closed. I was not told that the affidavit was not strong enough. I am not aware that it was altered after it was first drawn up, It was written almost from my dictation. On the Weednesday morning I received a letter from my sister which I have destroyed. It was given me by a gentleman called A dam Neale abcout 9 o'clock. I was staying at a lodgiughouse, and I walked to the courthouse when the poll as opened. Iam nets avoter. Myfather is not hero. Re-examined by Mr. O'WAsLxY.-The letter did not relate to the election, but it did refer to Mr. Conway. By the CO30nI=rc.-The officer in command of the escert proposed to take me back to Ballinrobe to swear au information. I said I should fear to let my father go, as he was in a very nervous state. My father might have gone in to Ballinrobe and voted on the Wednesday, bat he did not know that the town was quiet enough. ConwaT told him on the Tuesday night that the poll had been adjourned. * did not think my father was bound by his promise. Mr. Joseph Burke was recalled, and stated that he recollocted the name of Colonel Higgins being shouted by the voters under his charge at mass time, as they were coming out of Clarendon's. They were 500or 600 yardsfrom the chapel, and he did not know that the people were coming from mass. Mr. Hearn, examined by Mr. HALE, Eaid,-T am an elector of Mayo, and clerk of the magistrates at Ballinrobe. Mr. Moore and Father Conway canvassed me together. I told them that I did not intend to vote for Mr. Moore. I had frequently seen Mr. Moore and Conway in company. During the election I heard Conway addrems the mob with a view to deter the electors from voting for Colonel Hig- ins. Conway and Moore both addresmed the mob from. Moore carriae before the election. Mr. Griffin was abused and hooted by the mob. I also saw some of Colonel Higgs voters pelted. On the Wednesday afternoon I saw Moore addressing the mob. He said, "Where's Father Peter? Where's your priest ?I As the retmrning offier and deputy-sheriff (Mr. Sharkey) passed, Mr. Moore said, 1- e7 ay,a,argh4 au Ixelaa nd to =a for th Ix purpose, and that is he." The deputy-sheriff was thaei. pelted. Soon afterwards Father Peter Came full gaUsp down the street, and went to the window from whioah Mir. Moore had spoken. I then went away. Cross-examined by Mr. IKARSLAIE.-I only listened to Moore's speech for 10 or 15 minutes. When Sharkey was being pelted he held up the poll-book towards Moore and clapped his hands with it. 7He had adjourned the poll. Some of the leading gentlemen of the county had remonstrated against the adjournment. I first saw Mr. Moore in Ballinrobe on the Thursday before the polling, Friday being the nomination day. I did not see bim afterwards until the Wednesday. I lodged about 200 yards from Conway's house. Re-examined.-I could not hear any thing said by Shar]tey as he passed the window, because of the noise. Mr. Grifin, examined by O'LLmi.r.-I am an attorney and sollditor, and agent of Colonel Higgins. I was at Baliarobe on Sunday, the 5th of ApriL I received information respecting Conway, on consequencoe of which I went to Monaghan's hoteL Lady de Clifford is a supporter of Colonel Higgins, and her tenantry were there. I saw Conway and Mr. Kenny with the tenantry. Conway was asking them to go to mass. I offered to take them to mass myself, if they wished to go. They refused to o, saying they were afraid of being attacked by the mob. He ',rsevered. I said, "Mfr. Conway, I haveevery respect or you, but I have a duty to discharge, and I must rewind you that you are a trespasser in this house." I proposed that he should celebrate mass for thenm in the hoteL He refused. I then said that his wish to take them to mass was a mere pretext. Before I could get rid of Conway I had to go to a stipendiary magistrate, and in conseqoenCa of his remonstranac Conway went away. In the afternoon I went to meet the Clanmorris voters. Mr. Ruttey had sent for an increased escortk whioh had been sent out. [The witness here corroborated the statements of the previous witnesses with respect to the attack upon the voters in the lane, and the danger in which Colonel Higgins's voters were placed, when the poli commenced, from the excitement of the mob.1 I heard gather Conwvay telling the mob that Colonel Higgms was a traitor, and that some of his supporters had esaped them, but there were voters comiug from Neale by another road. He added, "Let 200 of you boys go up to my house, and 100 remain on each side of the street." The voters would have to pass close to his house if they came by the Neale road. I went away to inform the magistrates and rend reinforcements. Conway, who had ceased speaking, approached me, raised his hand, and said, ";Oh oh oh " Iwas then il-troated and abued in every way. Th1evotersl coming from leate did not reach their destination. I had to conduct voters to the booth on the day of the electioD, and I was obliged to have a strong escort. I saw Convray acoompanied by an excited and violent mob in various parts of the -own. That was the mob which obstructed the free. holders. I endeavoured to employ drivers of cars, but they would not get ready. They all gave some excuse or another, because they were in fear of personal injury. Mr. Ward, a voter, was dragged out of hiis car by the mob, and taken to Moore's committee-rooms. A. stipendlar; magistrate (Mr. Shiel), was struck with dirt as he was going into the house to release Mr. Ward. After the poll the voters remained a considerable time in the court-house, and ashe returned he was seized by the mob, and they regularly waltzed him down the street. (Laughter.) Cochrane was streck in the street after voting, He had gone up with an escort. I was also strack. Other voters were ill-used. Moore and Palmer had committees together, but the real contest was between Moore and Higgis Many of the Protestant clergy anld gentry plumped for Yiggins. In fact, every liberal-minded Man in the county supported him. (A. laugh.) The value of votes given to Higgins was nullified by their being split for Higgins and Moore. Michael and Pat Conway were supporters of Hgins before the election. I sent for them to vote. I saw them taken by the mobto the poll, and I followed them. I had the question put to them whether they had voted before. One said he had, and so escaped voting, and the other voted for Moore ad Pal Other voters who had promised their votes to Colonel Hg gin voted for Mooro and Palmer, and others did not vo at all. I had a conversation with one of them, named Fergs, with respect to his vote after the election. Mr. KAMSLAsE1 objected to the reception of evidence of conversationsbetween thewitness and voters. The voters themselves might be called to give an account of any sach conversations. Mr. O'MArILE contended that the evidence was admissible. The committee cleared the room, and aft6r a short deliberation announeed that they had determined to receive the evidence tendered, subject to suchrestrictions as they might think it neceay to impose in the course of the examination. The committee ad'uread imediately after this decision, until n o'clock thi day.

LIBEL ON A Brsssor.-Among the proxies against thesacondreading of the Ministers' Money Bill, inthe Housa of Lords, we observe the name of Lord Plunket, Bishop of Tua.n. It is morally impossible that this can be true. Ia fact, we have no hesitation In denouncing it as a libel upon that noblo lord and right rev. prelate. Lord Plunket everybody knows, is the son of the late lord, better knowa to the publie as, Mx. Plunk-et, the orator, the foremost Irisha. man of his day as the champion of civil and religiois liberty, the Whig, the Irish Chancellor of the Whigs the man whom of all his countrymen the Whip most delghted to honour, on whora they showered their favour and their patronage, not satisfied with advancing himself to the hghost posts of the lawv, with the dignity of the British peerage, but lavishing places and preferments upon every member of his family with a profusion and partiality that excited the astonishment and often even the indignation of the public. To the success of Liberal principles, to the Liberal party, and the Governments reslting from its triumphs, the present lord is indebted for all that he possesses and enjoys; for his mitre, for his coronet, for his wealth, his rank, his luxury, for every shred of his purple and fine linen, for every glass that sparkles and every dish that steamsuponhis table. ButfortheWhigsandfor Whig prlnoipleshewouldneverhave exchangedanulstercoracy for a Cornaught bishopric, andhis hot punchfor his coolclaret. He would never have been translated to turbot, or preferred from the mutton-chop to the haunch of venison. Therefore , e do not scruple to affirm it a moral impossibility that he could have voted, either in person or by proxy, in the manner attributed to him. Whoever inserted his name in the minority that voted against the Government and the Ministere~ Money Bill virtuallb bande him both with MRlberalty and ingratitude; wi degeneracy from his ilastrious father, with for,getfulness of the unnumbered favours that have raised his family from poverty and obscurity to riches and consequence. We owe it to truth and justice, we owe it especially to the memory of the most eminent Irishman since Mr. Grattan, to vindicate the character of his son from so crmel an aspersion.-xaminer. A FRENCH OCninrarrT4w.-The most celebrated and the muost successful charlatan of Paris -Mengin, the itinerant pencil seller-is just dead, and has left behind him a fortune of 400,000f. No one can have passed many days in Psjis within the last 10 years without having observed on the Place de la Bourse, the Place du Chll.telet, the Place de Ia Madeleine, or some other open space, the conspicuous figure of a tall handsome man, with a brass helmet and plumes, and a beard-the very model of that of Hudibras "in shape and hue most like a tile" standing on the box of a light c'rt and harangning a crowd. He wore a costly mantle of green velvet, embroidered with gold, and on the fingers of his white hands were many rings of great price. Behind him was a squire, who from time to time blew a trumpet to attract public attention, and whose garments were only less splendid than those of his master. The only end and aim of all this pomp and CirCumstauce wasthe sale of lead pencils at two sons a-piece. Menginposseasedin ahighdegreetheartofoommandiug the attention of his audience. The laughs he raised wer3 rare, but his face was faU of promise of somethinggood coming, and thus he kegt alive curiosity. Though his speeches took a long time in tie delivery, he was essentially a man of few words. He made long pauses, which were filled up by pantomine, and making grotesque sketches on a slate to show the qualty of his pencils. The substance of every one of his discoarses was that he had originally set up in a quiet shop, but, finding that he could not get a living in it, he had resolved to become a quack, and that from the hour of his taking that resolution he had done well. " Why." he would say, "do I fig mnyself up in this ludicrous costume? I will t-ell youL candidly; because going abaut in this dress I sdl a great miany pencils, and- ifI stayed at home in a, warehouse coat I should sell very few. I amn a, quack, I admit, but I am an honest one, for I sell a good article; and if you want a peneil I doubt whether you will get as good a one anywhere else for the money."

THE BZVEVUE. (From the Obserrcr.) The revenue accounts for the quarter wil be nade up THesday night next, the 30th int Withtot giving S eXact aLmounts we are happy to learn that thee quacterl-: returns will be of a most satisfactory chacter, nstead of A large eatimateKd deficiency in the GasoSr to be apprehended from the reduced rates of duty upOnla te and sugar, which took effect on the lBt of April (the:9m.- 3encement of this quarter), there will be, on the eontraz' an increase of something like 30ODOI. in the CuJtoms 43 comparedwiththe corresponding quarter of ltear. T favourable result is very-much to be attributed to the large, quantities of teas which were kept over to take advatage of the reduced scale of duties; consequently, the deliveries of ta were unusually large in the month of April, mad Y duties thoreox form an exceptional increase, which will ILet occur again until a similar drop in the descending abe of duties shall take effect. In the meantime the actul increase, where a deficiency was caloulated upon, shows that the import duties continue to exhibit a zising and a progressive tendency, in spite of every reduction. The gpsi. which paid duty is much less than it was at the same pWIedi last year. In the E1xcis the expected deficiency from the reductonof the duty on malt was calculated at no leos than fom 800,000I. to 1,000,0001. The aotual reduction will, probay,. not amount to one-half of that sum. The whole deeze.e upon the EBxcise will, probably, not be luore thaa 400,0%01. This is all the more a matter of congratulation, iince a peat portion of the balance of this amount arises from the Aill increasing consumption, although the great brewers hkaya not yet given to the public the benefit of the great redoi.- tion made to them. The Stamps and Taxes exhibit a steady increaset, chow. ing the progressive characterof our commerci relAteUN, a nd the improved revenues derived from the transfer aDc succession of land. The falling off in the Inoome-tax Will be much smaller than was expected, owing to the reduction of the duty only having taken place upon officia salaries and upon the recipients of intereat in the public securities, whic Wer, always collected closely--deducted, in fact, from the pymeats made by the Bank. Upon the other schedules the tax was not collected so quickly, and a great amotnt of the, income-tax due before the 1st of April has only boe gelected in this quarter. The 16d. in the pound ecsed on, the 1st of April, or rather dwindled to the old Td in the pound-the war 9c; being taken off; but the effect of thae rednction will not tell upon the revenue fully during *3 greater part of the year, since the arrears due and payablby the public are of the old 16fd. rate.' The whole deficiency will probably be less than 400,0001. -a sum far less than the lrge reduction of taxation woold have led us to expect.
THE RIVArL SuBVZyS. TO THE EDITOR Op THE ES. Sir,-I trust you will find space for a few words in rmlyto the lettarsfrom Mr. Locke and Sir RF d1urchi_on vhkhS appeared in 2The Times of yesterday. I readily accept the letter of Sir R. Hurchison in e- firmation of the great superiority of the 25-inch over thesix.- nch scle for publio property parpose4 and in juifieaios of the course which has of late been pursued by the Go,ement in reference to this question,-vi&x, a 25-inch surrey o. the cultivated and mineral districte, with reduced maps on the six and one inch scales. MSr. Locke complains that while criticizing the condc oE those vvho do not agree with me I have nkot been acce, , my statement of fact, and this inaccuracy he endeavours tow prove in the following respects:- L That neither he nor Mr. Stephenson have come to tha conclusnonthat a six-inch map is a judicious outlay of pubUc money, and that I am not justified in that sumpveu, for "that was not the motion submitted to the Houewhen the large scple was condemned." 2. That in quoting the opinions of himself, Mrr. StepheuSnO, and Mr. Brunel I should have continued the quota.. tion, which would have shown that their votes were ' inconsistent with the opinlons they had exjpresge( As to the motion not having been one in favour of the six-inch scale, I fid, on referring to the speech of Sir D. Norreys, as reported in She Times, that "he proposed Us; it (the vote for the survey) be reduced by 36,000., in order to compel the survey of Scotlnd to be taken on the sai3 scale asireland and the northern portion of Englaud had been taken-viz., on a scale of six inches to the mile, inasab& of the larger scale of 25 inches to the mile." The object and intention of the mover, therefore, is thta: clearly shown, and I maintain that I am justiflied in hag considered the vote that followed as being an expression o' opinion adverse to the 25-inch and in favour of the di-incd; scale. Messrs. Locke and Stephenson-the one having been a member of the committee of 1851, which unanimously eondemned the six-inch map, and the other having given evidence against it before the same committee-voted with Si. D. Norreys; and all I said in my previous letter was ibM" I was at a loss to understand by what process of ssning those hou. gentlemen had come to the conclusion that a sixinch survey and map were a judicious outlay of public money." Now, I rejoice to learn that they have not oomn to that conclusion, and that consequently they did ot. Intend to vote for that for which they practically voted. As regards my not continuing the quotation, from their reply to the Treasury circular, the further quotation whicdh it appears I ought to have made is thus given by Mr. Locke, " As regards engraving and publication we do not see anysufficient reason for the Government inunrring any expensebeyond that involved in the one-inch map. Ai faclity formaking extracts from such maps is what the public woald require, but any further expense ought to be borne by theparties requiring the accommodation." This quotation, It wil be observed, refers only to the ques-- tion of engraving and publishing the large survey, and if x. Locke will turn to my letter he will find that in the passage of which he complains I make no reference whatever to it; indeed, towards the close of my letter I say that "I have purposely omitted many points of considerable, interest, such as the mode of publishing the large survey, &c." To have continued the quotation would thezefore have been to fill your columns -with irrelevant matter. I hope I have now shown that I have neither misststol facts nor misquoted the opinions of Messrs.

TaB *ROYYA COLLEGE or PhsrcLAxs.-Th3. annual Latin oration, in commemoration of the celebrated Tarvey and of his researches and great diswovery, was delivered on Saturday last at the RoyalCollege of Physiciaus, in the presence of Dr. Mayo, president of the a co e Dr. Andrew Smith, Dr. Henry, Dr. Laugmore, Dr. Silvester the Ven. Archdeacon Hale, the Rev. S. Wayte, 1assrs. Jobn Hlll, T. J. Pettigrew, Ingoldly, Palmer, Henry Johnson, &c. The orator on this occasion was Dr. Copeland. whocommenced by pointing out the great advantages which had accrued to all the departments of medical science, as welt as to the community at large, from the discovery of the circulation of the blood. After adverting to the state of medicine during the dark ages, and tracing its rise concurreatly with that of the Reformation and of free discussion, the orator briefly described its subsequent rapid progre.,. which he attributed to the discovery made by Harve. He then dwelt upon the high character which Harvey bore in the opinion of his contemporaries, and spoke in terms of eulogy of the efrorts made by him to promote the welfare of the college, and the advancement of medical sience. Expressing his inability to notice within the time aalottedto him the many eminent men whose names graoed tbe annals of the institution, ho referred to the loss which tbatbody had sustained since the last comimemoration by the death of Dr. Paris, their late , rddeat, whose distinguished merits he proceeded to estim%e, xd to whose high-minded and honourable character he paid & wel! deserved tribute. Dr. Copeland then alludedcto the circumstance which, in his opinion, chiefly tended to depres the social state of physicians and medical men in the present day,-namely, a want of due protection by the Govermn.e t; both of the regular professors and of the science of med.- ine from the deadig arts of empirics and of irregular practitioners. He congratulated the College on the fact that none of its members haddeparted from the honourable the rational, and the scientific practice of medicine; nor hat even for a moment allowed themselves to be seduced by that publio patronage it had become the fashion to bestoir on the absurd, worthless, and injurious quackeries of ttio day. He exhorted the members individually ancd eo31e. tively to persevere in their adherencetothathonourables course, at d thereby maintain the high character of their institution and ormote true medical knowledge; and then concuded byecring that, although the physician rarelyacquired either fortune or rank, he had the inward satisfactionof knovringthat by the science his laboriousreyaraof study ha!d enabled him to possess he conferred the greatest. benefits it was inthe power of man tobetow ron his fellowrcreatures.

M¢ONlRY-1ARKET arn CITYINTBLLI(ENVOR. Saturday Evening. Whe news from India this morning caused the 1ands to open at a decline of a quarter per cent., wthich was soon followed by increased heaviness. 'The first transactions in Consols for the 9th of Jully -were at 92j to s ex dividend, whence they went to Ug to -, at which they remained without recovery atothe official close. After regular hours some opera. iions were entered into at an improvement of an eighth. Fortunately, the present overland mail has ived in time at MarseniUes to avoid detention -from the imperfect arrangements of the French il service, aud the letters and papers will .arrive in London on Monday. It is not exiected, however, that they wiU greatly alter the asrect of affairs or mitigate the prevailing uncer taintY as to the faithfulness of the troops who, in the Gabznce of a full European force, must be relied upoa -o meet the emergency. The fortnight to elapse be fore the arrival of another mail will therefore b3 characterized by great anxiety and caution in all departments of business. The India Directors, it is i nderstood, resolved to-day upon prompt measures, and have ordered all officers at present on furlough in this country to return immediately to their regianento. A considerable number of additional English Iroopa are likewise to be sent out instantly. The i.umber of Europeans at Delhi at the time of the anamacre will, it is hoped, be found not to have ex-ceeded a hundred, including both military and civilians. Bank Stock left off at 212A to 214; IMeduced, 92i; New Three-and-a-Half per Cents., f2* to i ; Exchequer Bonds, 98i toa; and India Bonds and Exchequer-bills, 10s. to 5s. discount. Foreign securities were heavy, and there wvas almost a total absence of business in them. The -only official bargains quoted comprised Danish Three per Cents., 85; Guatemala, 56; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 99i ; Turkish Six per Cent., 96 and 951 ; and Dutch Four per Cent. Cerliificates, 98. The French funds have experienced their usual -daily fall of nearly a quarter per cent., the final quotation this evening for both money and account being 68f. The Washington from New York to-day has brought 80,0001. The America on Monday wil bring a further sum, but it will be limnited by the I:'rcusnstance of her port of departure being Boston. About 22,0001. of American gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The position of the Exchequer-bill-market is exiwemely unsatisfactory. In former times these ecurities were among the most popular with all classes of capitalists, and were more free from adverse fluctuation than any other. The unseemly Exhibition of the floating bills of the Government being offered for sale, vainly, at a heavy discount was rarely witnessed. Of late they have been held In far less estimation, and have repeatedly been allowed to stand at a very discreditable point untit the approach of the period when the possessors could claim to be paid off. The reasons commonly asigned for the change are the competition of railway debentures, the facilities for lodgina money at call, and the prejudice awakened by the losses sustained when Mr. Gladstone made the experiment of reducing their rate of interest to a penny a-day, but there is ground to believe that these are not the true ones. So great is the convenience of Exchequer-bills for ,bankers, and so completely do they embody the principal requisites of a banking security, that they would always hold their place if they were issued on proper conditions. Originally the understanding was that they should be put forth at the lowest poszible rate of interest, but that the holder should always have the certainty of theirnever being allowed to fall to a discount. To insure this it was provided that at any time after they had been out three months they should be receivable for revenue payments. Thus the moment they declined to a trifle below par they began to be paid in for duties, and the removal of a very few from the market in this way Eoon gave an increased value to the remainler. The practice, however, was discontinued many years ago, and from that time Exchequer-bills have never enjoyed perfect stability. MIr. Glad. stone committed no error in reducing them to a penny a-day. It was a rate at which they would :loat at the time, and those who took them took them voluntarily, while the country had the gratilication of seeing the British Treasury able to borrow money at the rateof 11. 10s. Sd. per annum. The error was in suffering them subseqiuently to remain at a large discount. Sir Charles Wood effected great damage in this way dturing his term of office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Gladstone confirmed the mistake. It is to be hoped that another repetition of it will now be avoided, bnt the quotation to-day is I0s. discount, and the prospect of the holders is not encouraging. The telegraphic quotations from India and China to-day show no material alteration. If the Calcutta quotation of 2s. 01d. could be considered correct it would indicate an improvement of between 2 and 3 per cent., but it is believed that it should be a penny higher, in which case there would appear to have been an adverse movement of at least 1 per cent. At Shangbai the rate is less unfavourable, to the extent of about 1 or 1J per cent. At Honhong there seems to have been an improvement of about . per cent. The silver-market was dull this afternoon, pending the receipt of exact advices. In the tea-market there was great excitement consequent upon the report of the increasing disorganizalion throughout China from famine and the rebellion, aind the approaching resumption of hostilities by Admiral Seymour. Common congou was quoted Is. 2d. per lb., but business was restricted by the firmness of importers. The railway meetings of the week have not been important. 'The Deeside Extension Company have announced to their shareholders the passage of their Bill tbrongh the House of Commons. The line is to run from Banchory to Aboyne, and an amalgamation is to takoe place with the Deeside Company whenever three-fifths of the shareholders shall sanction it. The Sittingboumne and Sheerness Company are applying for power to construct new hranches to Sheerness Dockyard, Queenborough Point, and West Swale, and to en-er into working arraigements with the East Kent. No increase of capital, however, will be required. The Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Company have neootiated an agreement for 50 years with the Great Northern to open a new route from Manchester to London tiQ Sheffield, which threatens an active competition with the London and North-Western, tbe distance being only 8 miles further. The Edinburgh, Porth, and Dundee Company have obtained the approval of their shareholders to several Bills for small extensions now before Parliament. The 2andy and Potton line-an enterprise which possesses considerable interest, since it has been constructed at the sole cost of a private individualCaptain Peel, R.N.,-was opened for traffic on Tuesday. It is 3i miles long, and connects with the Great Northern at Sandy. The Buffalo and Lake iEuron Company have issued a discouraging report, not only as to the recent traffic on their owrn line, but with regard to Canadian railwvay prospects in general. The directors of the North British Australasian company have published a reply to the report of the committee of investigation mentioned in The Times of the 20th. They deny most of the inferesnces, and say that if the committee had applied to them for information each point could have been satisfactorily explained. A meeting takes place on Monday, but public meetings are not the occasions on which the merits of a dispute arising out of different views of eomplicated accounts can be fairly ad,iuated. The following information regarding the mining:market and the meetings of companies is from the Mininag Journ :_ "In the early par of the week there were many inquiries made for shares in dividend and progressive mines, but 'bargains' were the chief things required, and with the symptoms of improvement in prospects sellers have not been so anxious to realize. The Derwent Mining Coapany have declared a dividend of 101 oer share. At Ownstvfith Mine meeting, on tahe 17th of June, th-e accouts for the year ending Decemsber showed a balarice in x sioWe 9 1,Q2 the0 p it won th 1X a2 ' ntht "rOrking was 1,8461, 2B. 6d.; a dividend of 61. per sabara 'Ws declared.

At Fowey Cousols meeting the accounts for four months, caGing April, showed a balance in favour of the mine of 5,7021.; the profit on the three months' working was 1,5871. At West Fowey Console meeting, on June 17, the accounts showed a balance against the mine of 2261. ; no call was required.

At West Wheal Towan meeting the accounts for 10 months ending December showed a balance in favour of the mine of 6711.; the profit on the four months' working was 591. hlessrs. Taylor reported that it was evident their chances of any discovery of value were reduced to a very narrow compass, and they recommended that the cross-cut in the 65 should he continued for two or three months longer, but if the lodes be not met by that time, they will consider the trial has gone on to a sufficient extent, and would wish to be authorized to abandon it, and wind up the affairs of the company. A resolution to meet this recommendation was carried. At Old Wheal Basset meeting the accounts for eight months ending December showed a balance against the mine of 3681. ; the loss on the eight months' working was 4641. ; a call of 21. per sharo was made.

With regard to foreign mines, it is stated "The Wildberg Great Consolidated mining Company have convened a meeting on Monday to consider the present position of their affairs, which appears to be very unsatisfactory. The Copiapo Smelting Company have obtained the amountofapital requisiteforcarrying on operations. The whole of the shares have been sabscribed for, and the deposits paid upon them." The annexed has been received from the United Mexican Association:- " Extract of a despatch from the Commissioners, dated Guanaxuato, May 5, and received via New York. Major Farrell writes :- - " ' Jesus Ataria y Jose.-I am now mnost happy to confirm every good report of the mine of Jesus Maria. We have at present two haciendas at work-viz., Dolores and Durau, having given up the Maquila .with Mr. Furber in Casas Blancas. The two haciendas referred to are amply supplied with ore, and the mine presents every prospect of a continuance. To secure sufficient quantity of carga in store I have suspended for the present the sales at the mine, but I think it probable it will not be long before we may resume them again consistent with the supply of the hacienda and a stock in hand. The extraction for the last week was 850 cargas, and for the week previous 800 cargas, as stated in my letterof the 27th ult. The ley averages from 9 to 10 mares per monton."'

A VETERAN HEito.-We have at present in the sick ward of our poorhouse at Southampton rather an interesting character, one of the last survivors of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. A short time ago one of Nelson's men died at Greenwich 101 years old, and it was then stated that somewhere there lived another of evea more advanced age, " and this is even he." Thomas Goodman, our hero, was born at Southampton on the 1st of January, 1755, and is therefore in his 103d year. He served his seafaring apprenticeship from this port, and in due course wooed and won the fair daughter of a neighbour1ng farmer. The happy pair had just left the old Church (St. Mary's) after having been solemnly "spliced," and were enjoying them. selves with a few friends, when (alas ! for the course of true love) the terrible press gang entered the house and carried off the bridegroom, never more to behold his bride, for the poor girl died 18 months after. Young Goodman was sent on vatious sorts of service in the East Iadies, and had a brush after Paul Jones on the Scottish coast. In 1801 he wvas engaged at Copenhagen, where he came off almost without ascratch; but at Trafalgar, where he served on board Nelson's dag-ship the Victory, he got considerably damaged, and was carried below but a few minutes before the immortal hero himself. In the brief war with America, in 1812, our venerable tar was aboard the Shannon, and took part in the hot encounter between that vessel and the Chesapeake, which has since been immort.lized in song and story. Here he got severely wounded in the foot, but not sufficiently so to be obliged to "lay uD in port," for we find that he joined the Bellerophon in Lord Exmouth's expedition to Algiers, and, as a gt and proper termination to his own career, he helped to carry the world's great peace-breaker, Napoleon, to Plymouth In the Rochfost, Captain Maitland, previous to his being taken to his island prison. The old gentleman has been in receipt of a comfortable pension for many years, which he has just made over to Greenwich Hospital, whither he was making his way when he became ill, and was lodged in the sick ward of our Poorhouse, where, under the solicitude of the master and the medical officar, he is doing well, and will be able in a few days to proceed on his journey towards " the College," that palatial retreat for the tars of old England. It may be remarked that our hero is commUnicative and cheerful, and that, in the absence of " foul weather," his timbers, which are in -wonderfully good condition, may yet hold together for several years.-Hantm Iadepenadent. TMu SALE AT ALTON Towxas.-By order of the executors of the late Earl of Sbrewsbury the superb contents of Alton Towers, for many years a source of delight to tonrists from all paints of England and other countries, and of excursionists residing in StaffordshiTe and the neighbouring counties, will in a few days be disposed of by publio auction. The sale has been intrusted to Messrs. Christie and Manson, and vill be commenced atl o'clock on the 6th * f July, and continue during the 29 following days. The Towers are now closed to the general public, and admission can only be obtained by catalogues. Under one of the conditions of sale no lot can be removed during the time of sale, and therefore the contents of the Towers may be inspected by aU lovers of the beautiful in art until Saturday the 8th of August. It would be futile, in the limited space at our disposal, to attempt anything like even an outline of the treasures thus to be brought to the hammaer. We find that the sale of the pictures will last six days, and that there are upwards of 700 lots, including the collection of Madame Letitia Bonaparte, mother of Napoleon I. The various Italian, and the Spanish, Flemish, and French schools are admirably represented by the productions of, among others, Raffselle, Guido, Bellini, Perugino, C. da Sesto, Paul Veronese, Paris Bardone, A. del Sarto, Bonifaccio, Carlo Dolce, Sasso Ferrato, and Guercino; Velasquez and Murillo; John Van Eyck, lolbein, Cuyp, Van der Velde, Van der Neer, Berghem, Wouvermans, Hondikoeter, Weenix, R. Ruysch, and Jan Steen; David, J. Vernet, Lariesse, Patel, N. Poussin, Guardi, Panini, and the brothers Rippenhausen. The greater part of these pictures are hung im a noble gallery, 150 feet long, lighted from the ceiling, which is of oak and supported by light arches springing from corbels of Talbot dogs holding the arms of the family. The coDection of arms and armour is, perhaps, as a private collection, unrivalled for extent and for historic interest. In addition to a knight and horse in complete armour there are not less than twenty-two fine cap.d-pie titing suits, numerous three-quarter and half sUitz three hundred weapons, casques, and shields of various kinds; a large stand of arms and several small cannon. The sculpture includes a magnificent seated statue of Raffaelle, six beautiful statues of the seasons, and a number of colossal, heroic, and life-size busts of mytbological deities and modern celebrities. The collection of porcelain is exceedingly rich and varied, and embraces Oriental, Derby, Chelsea, Worcester, Stffordshire, Dresden, Berlin, S8vres, and other ware, in addition to a small but very valuable selection of mnajolica and a few fine Limoges enamels. Thore is, too, an almost endless variety of the finest old buhl, marquetrie, Florentine, mosaic marble, and carved oak furniture, and the remainder of the appointments are in admirable keeping with these gorgeous articles. The service of silver and ilvergilt plate weigs upwards of 10,000 ounces.

How 0 OACT TH QUF TO BE RECBIVFD AT MACHlST9. -Doubtless some of the numerous questions of etiquette addressed to us by readers previous to the recent vist of Prince Albert have been set at rest. But there is one upon which some doubt and difficulty sti exist, and upon which it may be as well to say a few words. Is it etiquette, or it proper, to cheer our beloved Qeoen as she pasces along within the building? We believe that, although etiquette does not prononnce absolutely and decisively on the subject, all the good taste, good feeling, and kind consideration which should dictate a loyal reception of our honoured Sovereign by her faithful subjeots, are in favonrof that reception being one of respectful silence. " Ob, but," exclaims soune one whose pent-up loyalty longs to vent itself in a good shout, " are we aU to stop our mouths, and not eive a single ebeor for our own Queen2" Softly, loyal friead; just consider what your Queen-a lady, a womanwill have to go through In the course of her Royal progress from Worsley-hall on Tuesday morning to the building at Old Trafford. The cheers which await Her Manesty as the Royal cortqe issues from the gates of Worsley-hall Wil commence that genuine and truly and only English course of vociferous loyalty which, sweUing from time to time as more populous neighbourhoods are passed, will never die away upon the ear until the Art Treasures Palace receives its Royal visitor. And how much of the whole distance can be regarded as country? From Pendleton Church at all events, through the borough of Salford and the city of Manchester, to the Exhibition, is a distance of at least four miles, through one of the dersest iopulations in the united kingdom. Think you, loyal s-outer, that in this distance the Queen witl not have bad sufficient of the noise inseparable from these vocal ebullitions of loyalty? To the Royal lady who. comes among her faithful subjects of Manchester for the second time, with a lively remembrance of their former reception of her renewed and strengthened by the reverberations which will everywhere teU her that the loyalty of 1861 has no whit cooled in 1857,-wil it not be rather a relief than otherwise to pass from hot and dusty streets ringing with the shouts of a joyful populAtion to within the walls of a building sacred to the arts, and filed by a well-dressed, silent, and respectful crowd, whose reception will not be the less cordial because it is not disturbing? There is no fear that Her Majesty will construe it into a cold or a lukewarm welcome. Besides, we havs it from a high quarter, that while cheering and shouks are the usual and acceptable greetings for our beloved Queen, wherever she passes along in cities or othor potulons places in the midst of her people, it is noi usual-it is, indeed, very unusualso to greet her within the walls of a building. In the Exchange, in October, 1861, an incipient cheer was promptly, and we think propezly, hushed. It may be said that thie Queen was loudly cheered at the Sydenham Palace the other day, but we ma!; assure our readers that that cheering has been a little mizsuderstood; it was, in fact, an " ovation " for the Princw Royal, on her appearance in public with hpr betrothek. It was so understood by the Queen herself, and, we baeve, much affected her true mother's heart ; indeed, Hcxe Majesty h said to have so expressed herself, and to l,ave added tha% she had never but once before felt so murl this Idnd of reception, and that was on beaing the cheei'ng of 70,000 or 80,000 Sunday scholars in Peel Park on 'ner visit here in October, 1851. On tbe whole, then, uw bAlieve reason, taste, feeling, and authority are alike in favour of a large assemblage of ladie anad gentlemen, within the building, receiving their Sovereign with respectful and loyal silence on her appearance among them. Silence best bfitu the person of the august visitor, the character of the place, and the mixed nature of the loyal assembl ibelfU; 'and we think such a reception will rally be most acoeptI able to the Queen herself-a peintwhich ought tohave ehief wseight wvith all pi cnt,-MGuckhr Gaieardiea of
STATE Or TRAD_. MANCHESTER, JurNx 27. There is a moderate, but steady busaness, at' full pricet, and since Tuesday manufacturers at asking rather more money for some kinds of clotbs,but in generalit isfound diffioult to get any advance, notwithstanding the upair4d tendency of cotton. The good clearance of stockl made in some kinds of T.clotbh ancd longoloths has had the effect of improving the position of manufacturers of these goods, and makers of 4-inch sbirtings are doing a fair basinese at full rates. Painters are slow of sale, andprices are unsatisfactory. In yarns the principal demand is for 20's to 30's mule and water twist in the bandle, and in the modium counts of warps and cops, both for export and home use. BIRMiNGEHABl JuNE 27. At the preliminary quarterly meeting of the Staffordshiro and Worcestershire ironmasters, held at Stewponey during the present week, it was resolved to adhere to the present prices of manufactured, and there is little doubt they will De maintained at the ensaing meetings in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Dudley. The trade is represented to be steady, and the furnaces throughout the district areowdl1 employed. For the last few weeks reluctance has been exhibited to enter upon fresh contracts, but now prices are understood to be settled for the next quarter orders will be gen out and accepted more freely. For Americs Stafford. sire iron is in considerable demand, and Liverpool houses have been in the market during the week. The attendance at the forthcoming quarterly meetings is expected to be unusually numerous. The reports from the large foundry establishments of the neighbourhood are generaly satisfactory. The extreme heat of the weather hu to some extent impeded the opera. tiens of the men, bat upon the whole they have been fairly enployed. The copper and tin manufactures of the town and neigh. bourhood, although somewhat improved by the recent re. ductions in the prices of ores, are not so active as anticipated. The lamp manufacture is dull, and some establish. ments engaged in the locomotive tube trade complain of dulness. The manufacturers of best descriptions of japannery goods are well off for orders, and one or two branches of the jewelry business are basier than they have been, upon foreign orders, for some months past. There has been little change in the position of the general ironmongery trades of the town. The near approach of the qaarterly meetings usually induces inactivity, and few orders are delivexed out to manufacturers until the commencement of the new quarter. The pearl buttonmakers contimue to be remarkably bury, the great weight of the manufacture being for foreign markets. The factors describe the home trade in Birminghatm pro. ductions as languid, but there are appearances which indi. cate a promising business upon the turn of lidsummer. The trade with the Continent is decidedly improving, and so far the last retuns of the Board of Trade conflrm the repeated statements we hear of the great increase in the exports of the Birmingham manufactures. NOTTINGHAI, TuNx 27. A fair business has been doing this week for the German market. Plain nets conitinue in tolerable demand. There is an excellent inquiry for mosquitoes * in plain quillings there is also a fair busness doing. There is very little demand just now for fancy articles. Upon the whole there has been more doing this week, some houses completing their orders for the United States. In the price of silk there is no alteration, it being fully as dear, and the probability is that its price will rather in. crease than decline. Yarns continne also dear. In hosiery there is no improvement, the trade generally being very flat. Hosiery, silks, and yarns continue very high. LEICESTER, JTrgn 27.

The demand has increased, and the manufacturers are better employed. Within the last few days there have been several of the metropolitan buyers here, and they have made some tolerably large purchases of cloths, chiefly to assort -stocks. There is evidently more briskness than of late, and the prospect for the fall trade is considered to be favourable. A good deal of work is in the hands of the manufacturers and dressers for winter goods. Thestocks inthe hands of merchants are to a ful average extent, or perhaps a little over. There has been a good attendance of buyers in the cloth-halls this morning, and they made purchases to a considerable extent. The bulk of cloth sold was larger than on any market-day for several weeks past. Wools of aU descriptions continue firm in prices, and sell readily. The local wool-growers are stiff in their demand, and appear determined to keep their produce rather than make any reduction in the current rates. At the last wFool-market at Selby prices varied from 16s. 6d. to 21s. per 141b. At York, on Thursday, where there was a good show of wool, prices ranged from l9s. 6d. to 22s. per 14lb. HALIFAX, Juns 27. The staple trade has been rather quiet this week, yet there are sorne indications of an improvement in the demand for piece goods. Wools are fully as high as last week, and yarns are without change. BRADFORD, JiuXs 27. There is a steady improvement observable in the trade of the worsted districts. Tlhe tone of the Bradford markets this week is decidedly better than could be reported of late, and a wiingness to give rather better prioes is shown by merchants, whose operations are upon a more extended scale than for many weeks past. The manufacturers look forward with confidence-based on the high rates commanded by all descriptions of wools and cotton, counpled with the more extensive inquiries they experience for their goods-to a somewhat higher range of prices ruling in the trade, those hitherto current failing to cover the high cost of production. The yarn department does not present anymaterial alteration. Prices raling are yet about the same. There is more activityin the demaud foryarns forshipping urposes, and a fair amount of business is transacting. An improvement in the rates ls looked forward to by the spinners, who would otherwise have to limit the number of frames in operation, and thus eventuaRy enhance prices by the cuartaiIment of the supply. In cotton warps purchases are more readily made, at firma currencies. The wool-market improves; and prices are exceedingly firm. As the new clip is being obtained from the farmers at prices relatively higher than those current here, combing descriptions are inquired for to a more satisfactory extent, and a steady business is doing in them at ful ratesClothing wools meet a steady demand; as there are no stocks of short wool on hand, full prices are obtained for the limited quantity on offer. NORWICH, JUN~E 27. There has been more activity observable in the manufacturing trade of this city during the week. The shoe trade continues good. Yesterday the official manager appointed by the Court of Chancery in the matter of the winditg-up of the Norwich Yarn Company attended here for the purpose of collecting the second plan of 301. per share made by the Master of the Rolls upon the contributories in the unfortunate concern. It is stated that the collection is proceeding on the whole satisfactorily. The litigation with regard to this unfortunate company has been almost as distressing as that attending the failure of the Royal British Bank. The order for winding up was made in lS60, and the matter is not yet closed. It is unde-stood that a further smaU callwill be required to finallyclear off the debts of the company. company.

Linen Yarn unaltered. Flax.-The supply of flax in the diffarent country markets this week was fair, considering the lateness of the season, with a brisk demand for all kinds at rlet week's pnces. Cotton.-Weavers in the north of Ireland ara all well employed,-not, however, at tieir legitimate business, for numbers of the looms aro idle; but iuch is the demand for hands at the field that all surplus Iabour is readily picked up in the rural districts. There is no change in the value of goods iD this market; twillsare in greater request forthe print fields, and jacconets meet a fine sale.

LOND ON, MONDAY, JUNE 29, 1857. The details of the Indian mutiny, as given by our correspondents at Bombay and Calcutta, from the number of compensating incidents seem somewhat less alarming than was the bare telegraphic despatch. The movement is likely to be confined to Delhi, and troops were marching from every side against the town. Meerut has been entirely delivered from the mutineers. In the Punjab Sir JonN IcwRENC had taken every precaution, and was ready to trample out the first spark of treason. The LieutenantGovernor of the North-West Province had placed the districts of Meerut and Delhi under martial law. The Cosm x-xx-Cumr was at Umballa with the QuumN's 75th Regiment, the 9th 1ancers, the 1st Fusileers, two Regiments of Native Infantry, and two troops of European Horse Artillery. At Meerut he would find reinforcements, and with his augmented forces would advance on Delhi. In the meantime troops were advancing from Agra, and the Rajahs of Bhurtpore, Gwalior, and Putteeallah, with their tributary Princes, were sending in their contingents. It is therefore probable that the next mail will bring news of the suppression of this dangerous outbreak and the condign punishment of the offenders. Nor wil the severest retribution which it is in the power of military law to inflict be too severe for the treacherous bands which have thus added murder to mutiny and rebellion. At Meerut the 11th and 20th Regiments of Native Infantry and the 3d Cavalry murdered every officer on whom they could lay hands. At Delhi it is supposed that Mr. FRASER, the Commissioner, has fallen, with many others, men, women, and children. The list of fugitives is given in another place. The most reassuring intelligence is, that the mutiny has not affected the troops in other stations. At Agra the native soldiers stood by the Lieutenant-Governor. At Lucknow a tendency to revolt was checked by the firmness of Sir Hmmy LAw-rsiusc. At Benares and throughout Bengal all was quiet. So stand matters for the present. Now, at the risk of being thought to prophesy after the event, we cannot help saying that a tumult like this ought to excite little surprise. The progress of things speedily sets aside false or insufficient surmises, and the notion that the discontent was confined only to one or two regiments, and arose from trifling and local causes-the greasing of a cartridge or the imbecility of certain officers,-is now shown to beinadequate for the explanation of what has occurred. The mutiny has not been confined to one body of troops or one locality. At Meerut two regiments of Infantry and one of Cavalry have mutinied; retreating to Delli, they were joined by three other Native Regiments, and committed the atrocities of which we have now received the detailed account. At Ferozepore, higher up in oiur northwest territory, a similar spirit sbowed itself. The disturbances beginning with the Eindoos have actually ended in placing on the throne of Delhi a alahomedan Emperor, and the fever has gone on to seize the distantgarrisons of what were lately the Sikh States. A movement so universal and so independent of conditions and circumstances must have its root in feelings which the prejudices of religion or the neglect of a proner supervision may indleed have strengthened, but which they could hardly have produced. The fact seems to be that we have arrived at that point in our Indian career when the total subjection of the native element and the organization of all that we have conquered become a matter of necessity. We have gone so far in the conquest of the country 1;hat it is now necessary to complete the task. What we have done is too much, and yet not !enough for tranquillity. A hundred years ago, when the disaster of Fort William was avenged, a policy was begun which, excellently suited for the time, has been continued into an age when it is both meaningless and injurious. As England governed her Indian settleInents anomalously though a Company, so the Company chose to govern anomalously through a vast, complex, and often unintelligible native organization. Indian rulers became our tributaries or our pensioners; Indian territory which our arms had conquered was mapped out among the native potentates who had aided our cause or been the instruments of our schemes. The arrangements of the public service and even the ordering of the army have been to a great extent made to conform to Asiatic examples. The tenure of land, the admirnistration of law, were altered by us less than they would have been by any race of conquerors that the world has ever seen. No doubt, all this was wisely done, and it is easy to imagine that this wonderful subjection of a sixth part of the world's inhabitants has been effected chiefly by the tact which knew how to establish the greatest amount of power while wounding the least amount of prejudice. This system went on also very well while the British dominion in India was still militant and progressive. Up to within the last few years the habitual state of our Indian rule has always been war. We have always had before us the next country which it was our destiny to conquer. Although the succession of GovernorsGeneral has, no doubt, furnished large-minded men, philanthropic men, men who saw the future of India, and the duty of raising the populations committed to their charge, yet the immediate care of each has generally been to guard a perpetually advancing frontier, and to defray the expenses of large military establishments. The best arrangement for the moment has always been made with dethroned, or conquered, or inefficient Princes; pensions have been granted, new sovereignties have been established, or old ones divided, without any purpose except the assurance of immediate tranquillity and the easy possession of what had been latest gained. While this system has grown up of dividing with native power the government of the country, there has also been pretty constant employment for the native armies, and an understanding that their religion, their castes, and their liberties or prejudices of all kinds shall not be interfered with. But this system has had its day. Whatever may have been the effect of the unclean cartridges at Barrackpore, there is one thing now evident-that we have an enormous empire, with 150,000,000 of people, and an army of 200,000 native troops, and that this empire is in a state of profound peace, and this great armyis to some extent reduced to the duties of a police. At the same time that we have these thousands of troops under arms without the prospect of a foe, it is known that the greatest changes are about to pass over Indian society. For a hundred years Mahomedans and Hindoos have submitted willingly to a people who were always conquering and never oonverting. Now, when conquest has ceased, and conversionnot merely religious, but of morals, manners, and habits-must begin, we cannot wonder that their minds should pam through a phase of disadection. What the hidden causes may have been that have conduced to this outbreak time must show. The intrigues of Persia, and of a more powerful empire than Persia,-the strange intelligence whichreigns among Asiatic nations-some perverted accounts of the proceedings of the native Princes, who are ever intriguing, and affecting martyrdom over heremay have stirred up those ignorant masses to revolt. But, on the whole, we are inclined to consider the disease as an epidemic generated by the present condition of Indian society, and to believe that under prompt and sldlful treatment it will pass away. The irst thing, of course, is to put down force by force. Whatever be the moral causes of an insurrection, the only safe remedy lies in a ready appeal to arms. On this point we are happy to say that there are no grounds for despondency. We can only hope that the suppression of the mutiny will be speedy and decisive. As for the expression of a wish that it may not be accompanied with bloodshed, we feel that it would be an unworthy affectation. Justice, humanity, the safety of our countrymen, and the honour of the country demand that the slaughter of Delhi shall be punished with unsparing severity. Asiatics are not the people to whom rulers can safely grant impunity for crime. The native army must be made to feel that treason, mutiny, and murder must bring, a memorable retribution. When eight regiments stationed over a long line of country, and without any common grievance, burst out into open insurrection,-when the ancient capital of India falls into the hands of the rebel soldiery, and the descendant of a dethroned monarch is actually set up as a rival to British authority,-it is too late to talk of mildness and negotiation. But, though the immediate work to be done is rough and terrible, yet it ought to be only the prelude to a more thorough organization. Now that we have conquered India from the Indus to the frontiers of Siam, it is our interest to establish in it a homogeneity which it has never before possessed. All its former monarchs have been weak because they ruled over a chaos of races, sometimes servile, sometimes insurgent, but always troublesome and faithless. There is no reason why the British Government should not attempt to fuse into a solid mass the conglomeration of provinces which is called India. Why, for instance, should there be a MOGUL at Delhi, whose very existence, as we see in the present case, preserves the memory of what we should endeavour to obliterate? We would even hope that the death of the NIZ Axmay be the occasion of the Deccan being brought more completely under British sovereignty. We cannot now refuse our part or change our destiny. To retain power in India we must sweep away every political establishment and every social usage which may prevent our influence from being universal and complete.
To those who have been in the habit-not unnaturally conceived-of regarding the Slave Trade question as one fraught with interminable embarrassment, we beg to offer a succinct statement of facts. Attention must first be given to the distinction between the traffic in Slaves and Slavery itself. Against the latter, as an institution, enough can certainly be said, but with this at present we are not concerned. The practice under the ban of universal law is the Slave Trade -that nefarious and inhuman commerce by which GOD'S creatures, being first captured on their native soil, are carried through successive scenes of the most frightful misery till they are landed upon an opposite coast, to be there sold into lifelong servitude with all its abominations. For this, at least, no plea of custom or necessity can be suatained. We cannot be told at this point that the practice has a patriarchal sanction, that it has certain advantages, or that it cannot be termi;nated without certain difficulties. Whatever may be argued on behalf of domestic Slavery or serfdom, nothing, at all events, can be said for that horrible trade which involves at once the worst kind of war and the worst kind of theft, and which in all its accessories is so thoroughly atrocious that viUanies of the most heinouz kind are its natural and ordinary incidents. This, and not the domestic institution of Slavery, is what we are now considering-this i what for so long a time, and awith such exemplary perseverance, we have been striving I to put down. |Now, what is it that stands in our way? Under what conditions is this trade still maintained, and how has it come to pass that it cannot be absolutely abolished? The concurrence of European Governments against the practice is universal and entire, and this unanimity has existed for years. The Powers of Christendom, of every degree, have consented to denounce and extinguish this most detestable of trades, and, this common assenthaving been stipulated, two of the greatest nations of the world have combined to keep the police of the ocean, so that no contrabandist should attempt what all honest merchants have undertaken to forego. In other words, whereas the Governments of Europe have covenanted, for themselves and their colonies, that Slaves shaU not be imported into their dominions, the export of these unhappy beings from the soil of their birth is stopped as far as possible by a maritime patrol. What further conditions, we ask, could possibly be required for the extinction of any traffic marked out for destruction? As far as undertakings go, every market is closed and every communication interrupted; yet the Slave Trade is not at an end. Its proportions have been diminished, but it exists still, and its victims are still to be numbered by thousands. Ostensibly, all Governments are of one mind, and yet the traffic is not abolished. Where, then, is the obstacle, and what can be done which to all appearance is not done already? As it happens, we can put our finger without any difficulty on the leak from which the vessel is now suffering. There are no Slaves imported into British Colonies. Our own work has been done thoroughly and is beyond impeachment. There are no Slaves imported into the United States. There are none imported into the French or Danish settlements, and none now, as Brazilianxs earnestly assure us, into Brazil. The only receptacle for these cargoes of misery is Cuba; the single delinquent State is Spain. But Cuba is nominally closed against Slaves as much as St. Vincent's or Trinidad, and Spain does not deny that she, as well as Great Britain or France, is committed by treaty to the abolition of the traffic. How the execution of these conditions is evaded has appeared very plainly in the letters of our Madrid correspondent. The Governor of Cuba is an officer the tenure of whose place is usually brief, and always uncertain, while his emoluments admit of enormous increase from connivance at the forbidden importations. The Cubans are ready to buy Slaves, others are found to fetch them from Africa for sale, and, as there is no class of Spaniards whose sympathies are very active in the matter, the planters can lay in their human stock; and the Cabinet of Madrid finds it more convenient to employ pretexts and excuses than to exert its authority against its own officers and subjects. Spain, in short, has not entered honestly into the abolition of the Slave Trade. It could not for very shame refuse its concurrence, but it will not be at the pains of executing its engagements against the will of an important colony, and it would rather carry on a war of despatches with the British Foreign-office than involve itself in trouble at home. We do not say that this policy contains much to excite surprise, but to the interests of others it is prejudicial in the extreme. The Cubau market keeps the whole Slave Trade alive, perpetuates all the introductory horrors of the traffic in Africa itself, and maintains at their full weight the heavy burdens arising from the preventive squadrons. At the same time, our own colonies are suffering the most grievous injustice, for Cuba is allowed to thrive on their ruin by its own perseverance in evil, and to supply the demands of Europe through the instrumentali'y of the very machinery forbidden in the adjacent islands.! If it were not for Cuba the Slave Trade, so far as we can see at present, would be at an end. We do not deny that a policy confined to this species of repression alone is likely enough to be defective, and that something in the way of substitution for the labour intercepted would probably be indispensable to the complete and permanent success of our efforts. Still, as far as the first and immediate object is concerned-the interruption of the traffic in human flesh,-we should be apparently accomplishing our ends if the importation of Slaves into Cuba could be stopped. Here, then, are the facts of the case in a very narrow compass. All countries-Spain included -are committed to the abolition of the traffic, but it continues still at a point of Spanish territory where Spanish authorities are not disposed to repress it. If we can repress it at this point we shall be only doing what Spain herself is bound to do, and what, when pressed, she declares her desire to see done. It has been suggested, as our readers are aware, that we should try the effect of a preventive force on the coast of Cuba, as well as on the coast of Africa, and the gunboats, of which we now possess a serviceable flotilla, have been considered a kind of craft especially adapted to the purposes in view. The moral effect, too, of such a policy would be material, and would prove to the Spanish Government that we were resolved to insist upon our rights and carry out our engagements. Such a resolution, indeed, we owe not only to humanity, in the cause of which we first undertook the struggle, but to our own colonies. The laws of trade-invincible in their operation-prevent us from discAriminating between importations of sugar. We must buy this commodity in the best markets, and consume it without reference to the circumstances of its production; but we can, at any rate, endeavour to provide that other settlements, equally bound with our own to abstain from the Slave Trade, shall not take advantage of their own bad faith, and rise upon the ruin of more honest communities. We do not, however, deny that this policy, after all, would be a policy of violence alone, and as such would be liable to failure at the first period of suspension or indifference. Moreover, it is not for the interests of civilization that productive estates should go out of cultivation, or that an article of almost first necessity should fail in the European markets. We should rejoice, therefore, to see the recent suggestion of certain active philanthropists caiTied into effect, and a legitimate supply of labour established by proper communications between Africa and the West Indies. Be it remembered that there is no humanity in leaving Africa to itself. Many of its tribes, and especially those near the coast, have been bratalized by the prevalence of the very traffic we havy been considering, and even those of the interior, though less debased, are still savages and heathens. The work of instruction and conversion caunot be maore effectually prosecuted than through a system which would maintain a constant communication between Africa and other parts of the world. Africa is rich in races of men who can endure tropical labour, and it is allowed on all hands that when Slaves were well treated their I condition was superior not only to that of their countrymen at home, but to that of the poorer classes iui many parts of Europe. Why should not some such result be now established as a general condition of things? Why should not the engagement of black labour, stripped of the evils of Slavery by the certi6ed existence of freedom, at once restore our colonies to prosperity and introduce Africa to better days?7 If any person sholld still be apprehensive about the poxition of Negroes in the hands of planters, under what name soover, we commend to his notico as, a final argument that this promise to be the ,only effectual method of abolishing Slavery. Slave labour, and therefore the Slave Trade, may be driven out of the field by labour of a more lawful description, though it has not yet been extirpated by any means we could adopt. Even if the importation of blacks, therefore, into the West Indies be an evil, it is far the Emaller of the two. Better, surely, have a System of engagements under the immediate cognizance of a protecting authority than a uystem which, in spite of all that can be done, leaves the Slave Trade in active vitality, with all the catalogue of atrocities which follow in its train.
There are some evils which so obviously belong to the province of penal legislation that it is a waste of time to discuss the abstract possibility of dealing with them. There may be some difficulty of detail in devising the proper remedy; yet the question is not whether the work can be done, but how it is most convenient to do it. The iniquities which Lord CAaPTBELL has lately denounced to the House of Lords certainly possess no special immunity from punishment. The distinctive industry of Holywell-street has received a compliment which is wholly undeserved in being classed with the sale of poisons. There is nothing intrinsically wrong in the existence of arsenic or of strychnine. Poison is, as Lord PALx2sToXN said of dirt, matter out of its proper place; and there is a risk of interfering with the proper use of drugs which are only incidentally dangerous to life. Bad books, bought and sold only for their badness, may be prohibited without any corresponding inconvenience. It is not even necessary to invent any new application of law to the principles of morality. The publication of immoral writings has always been treated as a misdemeanour, and the experience which shows the insufficiency of the existing remedy must necessarily suggest the new precautions which are required from the Legislature. Lord CAxFBunL has, however, been met, not with practical objections to the details of his measure, but with criticisms which would be equally applicable to the provisions of the common law. For the first time it has been discovered that the freedom of the press and the liberty of the subject may be endangered by a hasty extension of the securities against indecent libels. Lord Lv?DwnusT is alarmed lest a police. man should seize an engraving from Tlhm, under colour of an enactment for suppressing prints which have but a remote relation to art. In the same manner it might be argued that a powder-miU ought to be tolerated in the streets of London because a chymisfs shop may sometimes contain an explosive or combustible mixture. It is possible that in some cases there may be a difficulty in deciding whether a licentious book is punishable or simply mischievous; but the same indistinctness of boundary line extenda along the whole range of criminal jurisprudence. The difference between an untrue statement and a false pretence is sometimes scarcely perceptible, but it involves the alternative of acquittal or of penal labour. The law of England generally refers questions of this kind to the verdict of a jury, or, in other words, to the arbitrament of common sense. It is scarcely worthy of Lord LYKDnmiR's sagacity to put forward the obvious objection that twelve men or one man may be mistaken. The legal rule that a doubt shall be decided in favour of the accused supplies a sufficient security against practical injustice. If any vriter or publisher incurs a risk by running too close on the verge of criminality he must take the consequences of his own imprudence. Lord CEAwwoBRT has a quick eye for difficulties, but it is surprising that experience should not have tUught him that some obstacles are made to be surmo;unted. If a thing could be done without the smallest impediment it would probably have been done already. Every new essay in legislation implies previous neglect or incompleteness in its closer definitions or more stringent remedies. The CHsArcEurou justly assumes that evils which exist must aise from certain causes. If the weed is cut down it wiU spring again from the root; and, as to digging it up, time or tools are generally wanting. It is provoking to observe how much real ability and good sense are wasted in Lord CRs&wonrO's trick of opposition. His reasons against any proposed reform of the law are generally sound as far as they go, but they embrace only half the question. It was perfecfly right to remind the House of Lords that some care was necessary in providing for the suppression of even the vilest form of venal licentiousness. The error consisted in regarding the conditions of legislation as barriers which rendered it impossible. Lord CA?mBELL's Bill may probably admit of improvement, but its opponents never suggested an amendment. The LonD CHANcE1oR. is not bigoted, like his predecessor of forty years ago, but he is almost equally in the habit of using Lord E1DoN's formula, "I doubt." Lord LY"NHuBST's opposition to the measure rested on different grounds. This wonderful veteran was only anxious to find a vent for superfluous vigour, and at the same time to indulge himself in a revival of critical or literary associations. That Holywell-street should be tolerated because Greek poets are occasionally voluptuous is a proposition which will meet with little acceptance; but half Lord LYNDHURSTIS audience were probably unable at the moment to detect the fallacy, which its author could have swept away in a moment. The protest was in itself somewhat ambiguous. It was difficult to say whether the speaker was denouncing DRYDEN, and CONGBxvE, and VOLTARE, or protecting the graceful dances of Nymphs and Satyrs against the interference of profane policemen. It is unfortunately true that great writers have not been always free from licentiousness. Greece and Rome, Italy and France, and England itself in former generations, have contributed in turn to the stoek of questionable literature. Sorme of Lord LYNDu%s heroes were even influenced by motives scarcely distinguishable from those of the objects of Lord CAPsBELL's indignation. DRYDEN and WYCHERLEY wrote for the market, as French novelists write for it still. VOLTAIRE deliberately appealed to the lower passions of the society which he desired for other purposes to control. No Englishman of the present day defends the practice of lieentious writers; but, nevertheless, the works of DRYDEN and of VoLTAIRE keep their places in the library. No triblnal would censure a bookseller for supplying his customers with complete editions of the classics, although much may be urged against the morality of PETRONIUS, of NONNus, of AILRTIAL, and even of CATuLLtIS and OvID. When their works are advertised in low thoroughfares in inflammatory placards, obviously addressed to the young, the ignorant, and the vioious, the law which Lord CAmPBELL wishes to strengthen will become applicable to the case. It would not be difficult to extend Lord LYND> HURST'S list of writings which may tend to stimulate prurient curiosity. A collection of Mr. SPOOR'S speeches on Maynooth, garnished with quotations from PBTBr DENs, would be not less indecorous than the famous treatise of PnuTATORIuS De CoZnculdnis lietivendis; yet it would be absurd to doubt the austere Protestantism which dictated the compilation of all imaginable PQpish improprieties. The incidentil evils which may ,result from the well-meaitinduxtry of the collector are the same to which satirists and preachers have in all ages been exposed- "sAll the emces sores aa& heeded.vIl "Whieh thou, with lloen of free foot, st caught, ! WWOuIdtthotl disgorge intahe general world.t Lord LnsDHuxsr himself, perhaps, aely perceives the use which laxer moralists may make of the Index Bxprryatrius 'which he has benevolently drawn up for the House of Lords; but it would be unjust to censure too hanhly the exceptional vagaries of an intellect which is as sound as it is powerful. No great orator of the present age has been moro singularly exempt from the ,tendency of rhetoricians to accept words for things. If Lord CnVwoBnrT's tuan of mind had suggested to himu n anmusing exercitation on the immorality of classical -writers iord LYmHu,sT 'Would have been the first to explain that the license of genius had nothing to do with the retail trade in provocatives. There is no seriousc difficulty in diminirshing the extent of the evil, although it may be imposrible to suppress it. The criminal book trade is by its very nature confined to great towns, if it is not, in fact, limited to the metropolix itself. Summary powers for the suppression of the nuisanee may safely be confided to the police magistrates, who are already on the spot. It is satisfactory to know that in this instance the rewards of crime are not extravagantly tempting. The Holywell-street publishers who have been convicted nader the existing law have generally appeared to be mere insolvent vagabonds of the lowest order. Some of them have complained of the injustice and severity of the law in language which seems to imply that it is not altogether without efficiency. Nevertheless, offensive advertisements stil defile the windows, and there must be a demand which maintains a commerce so dangerous and disgraceful. When the discussion on Lord CAmparaL's ]Bill is resumed the Lords will do well to remember that not one of their number really believes in the dangers which Lord CRA.wooxTr laments and which Lord LYNDHRuTx chuckles over. The case is one in which debates may be advantageously concise, for it is not desirable that our reporters should be compelled to omit particular speeches as unfit for publication.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE. . (By EtnIO xm INTMENAToIXAL T=GnAuPn) We have received the following despatch, dated Hamburg, June 27, 2.15 p.m.:- " The Emperor of Rutsialhas this moment arrived at the Hotel de rEurope. "He arrived this morning at 11 o'clock at Kiel, and leaves Hamburg to-morrow morning for Hanover."
FRIGHTFUL ACCIDENT ON THE NORTH EENT RAILWAY. A fearful accident took place last night, about half-past 10 O'clock, near the Lewisham station of the North Rent Railway. The particulars of this unfortunate accident, so far aswecouldleaxn, are these:-f hbile nap-train was stopping a sbort distanoe beyond the Lewisham station a train from Maldstone cameup suddenly, and dashed into t^he4stLonary trai. The break-vaa of the Maidstone train was forced on to the top of the last third-class carxiage of the forward train, and was completely wedged into it. It was some time before the unfortunate passengers could be extricated. Dr. Roberts, of Sydenham, whohappenedto bethe only surgeon in the train which caused the mischief, gave every posslble assistance to the injured persons. It could not be exactly ascertained how many persons were killed, but Dr. Roberts informed our reporter that he saw three women and one man dead. The number of persons more or less injured amounts probably to 30. There are 2 cisee at St. Thomas's HospitaL A train which arrived about 1 o'clock this morning at the London-bridge-station brought seven or eight persons, who were taken to the hospital, and a succeeding train in about an hour brought several more. Some of these passengers were so much injured that they gave no sign of life. It was stated, but we do not know if the statement be correct, that the train which was ran into did not exhibit a light, and that no signal had been mado to denote that there was a train stopping between the Blackheath and Leowisham stations. ~Another account of the accident which has been sent to is says - " The lives of no less than 12 passengers have been sacrificed, and nearly 40 persons are more or less injured"

THE MUTINY' i INTlE _: INDIAN ARMY;,1 (ROY Ou1 OWN om mu' :BOMBAY, M&Y 27.- In my letter of the 11th I mentioned that' telegraphic message had that afternoon arrived at Bombay from Agra to the effect that the 3d Besit Light Cavalry, stationed at Meerut, was in a state oi open mutiny. The report Soon received ampleconlfirmation, and worse was to follow. For aeveri days the intelligence from the North-West told of. nothing but revolt and mureler. As wtas o be-ex- pected, much thus reported has since turned out to. be untrue. Stations said to be disturbed are found to be perfectly quiet, and eminent public servAntg asserted to have fallen victims to the soldiery are preserved to their families and to the State. Other facts there are, too, of a cheering ma' ture,-the steadiness and promptitude of the Lieittenant-Governor, the loyalty of the native Statei of Central India, the failure of the outbreak in it; attempt to spread over and occupy a very extended area. Nevertheless, after making all allowances fo" these legitimate sources of comfort, the occurrence is one of the gravest moment. At the two grest stations of Meerut and Delhi the whole of the native troops have broken out into mutiny and murder' From the former place they have fled or been.ex-' pelled. 'The latter (where no Earopean troopr were quartered) remained, at the date of the latest accounts, completely in'their possession. I will endeavour to digest into a continuous narrative as much of the fragmentary intelligence i that has been day by day rushing down frozn Agra as has been proved, or may be reawonably conjectured to be true. ASt the commencemEantof thismonthlthenative force at Meerut consisted of the 3d Light Cavalry and the 11th and 20th Regiments of Native Infantry. Among the men of thd cavalry corps the question of the greased cart-. ridges, which had previously been mooted at Bar;rackpore and other stations, was freely agitated, The result of the movement was that 85 men of the regiment refusing to handle the cartridges found. themselves in the early days of the month tried bj court-martial, and sentenced to various terms of im. prisonment with hard labour. On the 9th their sen-- tences were read out on parade, and the offenders marched off to gaol. 'Ip to this time disaffec. tion had shown itself only through incendiary fires in the lines, hardly a night passing without one or more conflagrations. But on the 10th it appeared at once in all its unsuspected strength. Towards the evening of that day, while many of the Europeans were at church-for it was Suanday-the men of the two native infantry regiments, the 11th and 20th, as if by previous concert, assembled together in armed and tumultuous bodies upon the parade ground. Several officers hurried from their quarters to endeavour to pacify them. Colonel Finnis, of the 1Ith, was one of the first to arrive, and was the first victim of the outbreak. He wea shot down while addressing a party of the 20th, which is said to have been the foremost regiment in the mutiny. Other officers fell with the Colonel or in the terrible moments that ensued, for the troopers of the 3d Cavalry poured out of their quarters to join the insurgent infantry, and the whole body, now thoroughly comrmitted to the vildest excesses, rushed through the native lines of the cantonment, slaying, burning, and destroying. Every house was fired, and every English man, woman, or child, that fell in the way of the mutineers wAs pitilessly massacred. Happily, however, many of the officers and their families-the great majority, I hope and believehad already escaped to the European lines, where they took refuge in the Artillery School of In6' straction. Mr. Greathed, the Commisioner, and his wife were saved, it is said, by the fidelity of their servants, who assured the assasins thattheir master and mistress had lefttheir house, though they were at the time concealed in it. The mutineers set fire to the bungalow and passed on. The names of the victims I am unable as yet to give with certainty or completeness. This,. however much to be regretted, is, in the present confused state of things at and around Meerut, inevitable. A list was published here yesterday, emanating from Agra, and said to be " from authority, though open to correotion." I will copy it im extenso presently, when I have written of the occurrences at Delhi. While the main body of the mutineers were thus destroying the houses in the native lines, some of their number proceeded to the gaol, broke it open, and released the prisoners of the 3d Cavalry. Which regunent had furnished the gaol guard on that day is not stated; but as we hear of no resistance and no loss of European life at that point we may presume it was one of the native corps. Meanwhile the European portion of the brigade was called out and marched down to the native lines. It consisted of the Carabineers, the 1st Battalion of the 60th Rifles, and Artillery, horse and foot. But they were too late to save life or property, and, night faling fast, they were unable, we are told, to inflict any serious loss on the insurgents, who abandoned the station and betook themselves to the open country. Some of them-how many we know not, bat probably a large body-made the best of their way down to Delhi, distant some 40 miles. The garrison of this city was entirely native. It consisted of three regiments of infantry-the 38th, 54th, and 74th, and a company of one of the native battalions of artillery. On the arrival of the mutineers from Meerut the whole of the infantry force ran to arms, and forced, as we are told, the reluctant artillery to jointhem. The latter stipulatedfor thesafety of their officers, all of whom accordingly have reached Xeerut. The infantry showed no such good feeling, but attacked their officers, though with different degrees of inveteracy, the 33th being the worst. Then the insurgents ran riot through the city, which was entirely at their mercy, and the bloody scenes of MIeerat were reproduced in the streets of this ancient Mogul capital. How many English lives have here been lost will in all probability not be fully known tiU the day of retribution has arrived and the place is again in our possession. Mlany are already known to have escaped, as will be seen from the list already referred to, and which I will now subjoin. But it is feared to be only too certain that Mr. Fraser, the Commissioner, has fallen, and Captain Douglas, Commandant of the Palace Guard, and Mr. Jennings, ,haplain of the station, with his daughter and many cthera of aU degrees, including Sir Theophilus Metalfe:- K' ILLED AT MEEVx, "11th Regiment Native Infantry.-Colonel Finnis and m Chambers.

TO THE EDITOB OF THB TIMES. Sir,-The Chairman of the Court of Directors of the East India Company was understood to say at the recent Addiscombe examinations that the blame of the disaffection in the native army in Bengal is attributable to the European officers. This is a grave accusation, and requires to be sifted. It excited, I am informed, lively indignation in some of tho3e who listened to this singularly ill-advised expression of opinion. That it is wholly erroneous and without any just foundation I am quite confident; and I do not envy the hon. chairman the comments with which it will be received in Bengal, where already the European regimental officer has but too ready a per contra to urge against the authorities of the India House. Looking to the facts of the case,what possible influence, let me ask, could European officers have exerted in a disaffection like the present, originating not in any imprudence or misconduct of theirs, but primarily with certain Calcutta functionaries, and calculated, as has been proved by the result, to excite general suspicion and distrust in the minds of the native soldiery-acts of careless neglect or indifference of which no expla- nation, far less denial, has, as yet, been offered on I the part of the Government? So far from the regimental officers being blameable in this matter, it is, I submit, quite obvious that they have grave cause of complaint, and that they are placed in a most unenviable and difficult position by the errors of their superiors. They had no control over the acts which led to the unhappy display of feelings now so widely spread, and they have not been even armed with the means of affording an authoritative explanation of the circumstances or a denial of the supposed facts. I contend that, so far from originating 'with the regimental officers, these last are in reality the parties chiefly compromised, and that in any way attributing the disaffection to them a grave injustice is perpetrated. But, even if a proper straightforward explanation had been offered, would it be so easy to undo the mischief, to remedy the consequences of official remissness deacribed in various letters I have received as " the fatal suicidal blundering in Calcutta?" Is it strange, or anything but simple human nature, that the Hindoo soldier should feel outraged and incensed at this act, which so compromises and lowers him in the estimation of the native community, or that it should be found next to impossible to make the sepoy or his fanatical relations in the provinces believe the Governor-General's statement in the manifesto disbanding the 19th Regiment, " That the Government of India has never directly or indirectly shown a desire to interfere with the religion of its native troops"-a statement which would not require much Brahminical influence to represent as directly at variance with the unexplained fact that cartridges greased with tallow or the " fat of bullocks and pigs" have been prepared by thousands for issue alike to the European and native soldier ? Why, the least prejudiced may well be excused for suspecting in such a proc.edure an organized design against caste, and it is the very height of misrepresentation to visit the results of such incapacity and carelessness on the heads of the regimental officers. To these, whom it appears to be the fashion, just at present, to underrate and undervalue, the Government of India is indebted for a body of men who rule, with a steadiness and ability unsurpassed even by the Indian Civil Service, over many of our provinces. Oude, Rajpootanah, Mysore, the Valley of Assamn, Arracan, Pegu, and various other dependencies are aU in the hands almost exclusively of military officers taken year by year, nay from month to month, from the ranks of regiments. Adnmit that good men, the best, as it may be imagined, are taken, but still " another race the following spring supplies." They do, indeed, " spring auccessive," and if with native regiments, there is undeniably a paucity of the more experienced officers, the error surely rests with those in authority who denude regiments in this manner, and not with those officers who remain to qualify themselves in turn for similar selection at a future time.

THE ZOUAVE TnAPPIST.-The following anecdote gave rise to a very pretty painting by Horace Vernet, now exhibited at the Pnlais de l'lndustrie and styled the ' Zouave Trappiste." Some years since a soldier presented himself to the superior of the Trappists at Staouli, in Algeria, and told him that he belonged to a regiment of Zouaves, and that he was entitled to his discharge. He added that, having been severely wounded in the head in action, and that having been between life and death for some days, he made a vow that if he recovered and was unable to serve as a soldier he would devote himself to God. The superior received him kIndly, requested him to return in a few days, and in the meantime made strict inquiries respecting the soldier of his officers, from whom he received an excellent character. The Zouave returned the day ap- pointed, the superior exaied him a' t length, asked Dmnif be had a real vocation, and wheaEr he was prepared to suffer every privation and undergo the severest tnals, confiding in God alone to judge him? The soldier replied affirmatively. The next day the superior assembledthe entire community in the chapel and addressed the monks in the following words :-" Brethren, a stranger demands to be received among us. Ho is a soldier, unworthy of that name. He has ever been notorious for bad conduct and want of courage. He solcits an asylum in this honse, where he ma2 atone in the bosom of God for the errors of his past life. Let each of you reflect, and to-morrow at the same hour let us know the result of your meditations." During this disconrse the stranger, kneeling on the flags of the chape, was fervently praying to God. Some tears which he cold not retain dropped from his eyes, and he passed his right hand, as if by an involuntary movement over a large wound visible in his forehead and scarcy healed. He remained at prayers all day and during a great part of the night. a daybreak the monks again assembled in the chapeL The superior, as on the preceding day, addressed them in the following terms. " Brethren, you have before you not only the bravest, the most worthy of soldiers, bearing on his forehead a noble scar, but likewise the most resined, the most humble, and the most virtuous of Christians. Yesterday, in order to expose him to a severe trial, the most unjust accusation was made against him. He suffered all, endured all, plaing his confidence in God alone and expecting from him a merited reparation. He has thus given you, the very flst day of his presence among us, a remarkable example of the great Christian virtues necessary for a monastic life. Henceforth the new brother whom Heaven has eent us will walk at the head of the community to serve as an example for all. The Trappist Zouavo lived ia thasmoaatery for four yer, during vwhich time he edified the community by his profound piety. One day the wound in his forehead again opened, and shortly after he met death with t-he same courage ho had previously exhibited on thefie ild of battle.
1OREIGf INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN ooPARoNDxMT.) [A portion of the following apperWed inour scond odition of Saturday :-] PARIS, FnmAY, JUNE 26, 6 P.Y.| General Cavaignac, it is said, would rather! not present himself a second time to the electors of the third arrondissement, if he could avoid it. If, as is pretty certain, he would refuse to take the oaths to the Emperor, he would act like a man of sense by not coming forward. The 'times are no longer propitious for mere manifestations. The circumstances are no longer the same as under the Restoration, when Manuel could produce an immense effect by resisting the sentence of expulsion from Parliament, and only yielding to brute force at the hands of a Gendarme. General ( avaignac is not Manuel; the Emperor Louis Napoleon is not Louis XVI I.; the Legislative Body is not the Chamber of Deputies; and France is no longer in 1823. If General Cavaignac were sO ill advised as to attempt the imitation it would probably produce as little effect as the refusal of the oath by M. Bonhier de rEcluse in 1852, and would be as Boon forgotten. It is said that a proposal has been made to a distinguished member of the Parir bar, a moderate Republican, to take General Cavaignac's place at the new elections, but it hass not been accepted. The Prefect of the Seine has this day posted a notice in Paris announcing that the electors of the third, fourth, and seventh circumscriptions are convoked in their respective sections for the 5th and 6th of July next in order to elect a deputy in each circumscription. Cards will be delivered to the electors by the Mayors from the 1st of July in the localities which will be indicated in a future notice. It is stated that, in piursuance of a report of the Minister of the Interior, the Emperor, previous to his departure for Plombiares, signed a decree suppressing, the Directions-General of Public Security and the Telegraph Lines, at the head of which respectively were M. Collet-Meygret and M. de Vougey. The statement is correct, and those gentlemen are to be transferred to other posts, one 2S Prefect of an important department, the other as Receiver-GeneraL The real cause of the suppression of these offices not being known to the public generall;y, many rumours are put into cir¢ulation, which can only possess interest for the authors, of them. It il probable that in ruch cases the Emperor forms the decisions which he adopts on grounds more serious than any of those that are alleged. It wil be remembered that the decree for the suppression of the Ministry of Policecoincidedwiththereturnof comparative calm after the agitated period which immediately followed the coup d'6tat; but it was considered that, in the circumstances which then existed, it was not safe topass at once from a i'Ugime of too rigorous a character to a total relaxation of vigilance, and the creation of the intermediate Department of Public Security followed as a statelof tranhition. It is alleged that at the present moment the utmost material tranquillity prevails; secret societies, the great plague of the country, though they may not have totally disappeared, give but faint signs of their existence, and the general silence of parties, while it proves the decay of public spirit, is at all events adduced by the admirers of the Imperial 'regme as evidence of the confidence of the masses in the strength and watchfulness of the Emperor. TJnder such circumstances the Emperor doubtless thought that a Director of Public Security,as the office has existed till now, has become superfluous; and that the services of the intelligent functionary hitherto so useful to the supreme authority might be advantageously transferred to another and more busy stage. The post of Director-General of the Pablic Security is perhaps one of the most difficult and least popular in the State, particularly in times of political turmoil; but, if ever any one succeeded in softening down the harsher attributes of such a post, M. Collet-Meygret, it is generally admitted, was the man. It is well that the office is abolished, for his successor would have had a difficult task before him. I believe there are few indeed who will not admit the loyalty of his character, the superiority of his intelligence, and, what is far more valuable than is generally supposed, the unvarying amenity and polish of manner which stamp the gentleman. Journalists and men of letters especially, whatever they may think of the institution itself over which he presided, regret his retirement, for it would be hardly possible to exhibit more impartiality and forbearance in carrying out the very rigorous laws and regulations which weigh upon the press. It is no small merit for a maan at the head of a difficult and unpopular department to have won respect and regard from those with whora he was brought into qontact, and even collision, and this merit public opinion generally accords to him. The trial of three Protestants, MM. Massy, Rambaud, and Ledoux, of Tonzac (Charente-Infdrieure), for having been present at a meeting consisting of more than 20 persons, held without the authorization of Government, was mentioned eome weeks ago. M. Massy was moreover charged with having publicly insulted a curd, anbd with having turned the Roman Catholic religion into contempt. The SiUcle now offers a detailed account of the proceedings which led to the trial, and which places the matter in an entirely new light. That journal says:- "M M. Meassy has been requested by M. Rambaud, a farmer, to visit him and to read the Scriptures t-, his family. On the day appointed M. Massy, not having a horse at hand, gave up the projected visit. But he subsequently met AL Ledoux, a tradesman, who offered to drive him to the house of Rambaud. On arriving there they found that the family, after having waited for some time, had dispersed in the fields, and were engaged in their usual occupations. But the youngest son ran off to fetch his parents, and in the meanwhile a considerable crowd of persons, numbering more than a hundred, flocked into the house and courtyard in order to listen to the words of M. Massy. The latter, surprised at the number around him. asked the cause, and was then informed that the cure of the parish had on the preceding Sunday an^ounced from the pulpit that a leopard, devouring all that it encountered, was prowling about the country; that the ferocious beast would probably appear in his parish, but that he should decidedly go to meet it on its arrival; then, dropping the metaphor, the curd added that the leopard was a landowner namecd issy. The crowd bad, consequently, assembled in order to witness the encounter between the cure and the leopard. M. Massy contented himself with reading, without comment, the 23d chapter of St. Matthew, in order, as he said, to prove to the audience that religion is holy in spite of the faults committed by those who teach it. A person present asked M. Massy if he believed intheVirgin;upon whichhereplied:' The miraculous conception of our Lord Jesus Chrlst is a mystery I worship; no woman has so many claims on our veneration as the Virgin Mary, because she was chosen by G(od to conceive the Saviour of the world.' 'But, said another person, ' we are told that the Protestants believe that the Virgin had other children, and that she did i not always remain young ?' IM. Massy, in reply, read the I chapter of St. Mark where it is recorded that Jesus had four brothers, named James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, and several sisters, and he reminded his hearers that at the time of the crucifixion the Virgin was 33 years of age. In returning home M. Massy met the curd, who thus addressed him,-' I have already said, and I repeat to you, what StI Polyoarp saidtoMaroion-'Youareademonvomited fromhell 1 for the misfortune of the country.' A lively disputefollow.d, but the provocation was not on the side of iM Massy. We. have not the honour of belonging to the Reformed Church but thn religion to which we do belong orders us to ! protect the weak fromn the strong, the oppressed from the oppressors; it teaches us to look upon every man as a brother, without inquiring into his religious b'elef, anrd to respect liberty of consoience and of worship. For these reasons do we struggle agaiRct all aggressive tendencie., frem whatever quarter they may proceed. We are the antagonists of every intolerant clergy." The Emperor proposes to remain 20 days at Plombieres, during which time there will be no Cabinet Council held, nor wiUl there be any official business transacted except of urgAnt necessity. The Count de Morny, on quitting St. Petersburg, left the direction of the Embassy to M. Baudin, the First Secretary. He takes the title of French Chargd d'Affaires until the appointment of a new Ambassador. The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 17th June amount to 1,103,865f. 8c., being an increase of 506,506f. 88c. as compared with the corresponding week of last year, The receipts from the 1st January to the 17th June amount to 26,830,894f. 70c., being an increase of 5,946,294f. 66c. as compared with the corresponding period of the year 1856.

A telegraphiodespatchiromelombieresannounce3 the arrival of the Emperor yesterday afternoon. He was received with loud ac¢lamations froln animmense crowd assembled to meet him. The town was tastefully decorated with garlands of flowers. It was briliantly illuminated last night in honour of the Emperor's visit. A letter from Avignon statesthatGeneral Cavaignao obtained a majority in that town of 500 over the Government candidate. Some field guns on a new model are at present on trial at the Arsenal of La Fere, under the inspection of commissioners selected from the Artillery, who are to report on the advantages to be derived from this new system. Last week the Generals of Artillery, Count La Hitte and the Marquis de la Place, paid great attention to the experiments. It appears that these new guns possess a decided advantage over those in use at present. Their weight is considerably less, the charge of powder is diminished by one-half, while the distawe they throw ehot is much longer, the aim more certain, and the effect more destructive. It remains to be seen whether there are defects in these guns more than sufficient to counterbalance these advantages, and it is to this point that the commissioners are directing their attention. A letter from Trieste of the 22d inst. informs us that the railway from Vienna to Trieste, which is completely finished, is to be solemnly inaugurated on the 27th of next month. The first trial train passed over the section from Laybach to Trieste on the 20th inst. This is the last section to be opened to the public. The termination of this railway wiUl establiah an uninterrupted communication betweea the Adriatic, the Baltic, and the North Sea. MM. Stokes, Tharaud, and Co. in 1849 contraeted with the Company of the Left Bank Versailles Railway to farma the line on certain conditions. In 1850 the liquidators of the railway ceded the line to the Western Company, and obtained from the Civil Tribunal a judgment declaring that the agreement with Stokes and Co. should end on the payment to them of 2,400,000f. in bonds. Yesterday MM. Stokes, Tharaud, and Co. brought an action against the Western Company to obtain payment of 732,522f., for a balauce due for worka executed previously to the cession of the line to the company, for tolls due from the (jovernment for the passage of goods and trains during the time the Western or Chartres line was in its hands, and, lastly, for land taken by, the Western Company. In support of their demand, they pontended that a proper interpretation of their agreement with the original Left Bank Company fully justified it, and that the Western Company, having taken the place of that company, must pay its obligations. The Western Company disputed the claim, on the ground that they knew nothing of the agreement between the plaintiffs and the Left Bank Company; that the plaintiffs had allowed the company to take possession of the line without raising their claim, and had received the indemnity of 2,400,000f. to which they had been declared entitled; and, lastly, that the Western Company had paid the liabilities of the Left Bank Company which it had agreed to pay, and could not be held responsible for any other. But the Tribunal, in a judgment of some length, decided that the Western Company should pay Stokes and Co. 611,653F., which was the amount of the Government tolls, but that they should not pay the rest of the demand. The Moniteur publishes the average price of wheat in the various markets of France, from which it appears that the highest pricd is 31f. 31c. the hectolitre at Marseilles, and the lowest price is 22f. 71 c. at Raye in the Somme. M.Ville, Secretary-General of the Bank of France, has at his own request, after not fewer than 60 years' service, been allowed to retire. He is suCceeded by M. Marsaud, chief clerk of the discount department, who in his turn is succeeded by ML H. Villemot, receiving clerk. The Bankr of France shares were quoted yesterday at 2,770f. That quotation is exactly equivalent to the price of 4,600f. before the coupon was detached. In deducting the half year's dividend, or 160f., the price of 4,440f. is arrived at, to which 1,100f., the value of each new share, being added, the sum of 5,540f. is formed for the two shares old and new; and that amount being equally divided gives the sum of 2,770f. for one.

English newspapers are so little read in Spain, and Spaniards generally pay such superficial attention to what passes in foreign countries, that probably very few persons here are aware of the strong feeling that is evidently being. aroused in England by this country's non-observance of~ the treaty regarding the slave trade. A considerable sensation would be excited by the announcement that the British Government had decided to transfer the squadron of vigilance from the African coast to that of Cuba; and there would be positive consternation were it known that the stronger resolution had been come to of establishing an effective blockade of the ports and landingplacesl of that island. The latter measure, which, in consequence of Spanish bad faith and brokren promises, has been sometimes talked of, is doubtless the least likely to be executed, but it would be the most effectual and the quickest remedy for this crying evil. The preventive squadron would probably be more efficient round the island where negroes are received than along the great extent of coast from whi ch they may be shipped, and the experience of our naval offiers on thb West lndian station would enable them to place our cruisers to the best advantage; but it must be borne in mind that the American flag covers the living cargo, and that there is no right of search within six miles of the Cuban shore. The blockade of a country with which there is so large a trade as there is with Cuba is of course a thing to be avoided as much as possible; it would occasion inconvenience and loss to the commerce of England, the United States, France, and some other countries; and, although none would have a right to object, it would be the natural wish of the EngliSh Government, while adopting decided measures towards Spain, to put itself and its friends and allies to as little inconvenience as possible. The argament in favour of a regular blockade is, that it would be short and efricacious. Caba is the milch cow of Spain-the ready resource of needy Governments, who raise the wind by anticipating her revenue; and it is not easy to imagine what the Spanish Cabinet could do were a blockade declared, except yield within a very brief delay, and employ the means which are at its command tostop in good earnest the importation of slave There is nothing easier; it has been done before, and could be done again; the will only is ~i ntig.GenralCochadiditdurng isformer command and at the comrmencement of this one, Although for the last two years he has found it impoible-in other words, unadvisable and inconsistent with% his own interest. General Concha ,should, of course, be immediately recalled, and .replaced by an officer selected, not on political trounds, but for his probity and high character. General Narvaez lately set the exaample of this kind of nomination, very rare in Spain, when he appointed General Lemery Captain-General of New Castile, an act for which he was applauded by all parties. Let him send General Lemery to Cuba, of which island he has already been second in comimand, or, if he be wanted here, there surely may be found men among the 500 Generals inl Spain capable of ruling a West Indian colony without entering into partnership with slave-traders. To strengthen him against temptation, however, it would be as well to warn the new Captain-General that the first well-proved case of slave importation would be the signal for his recall in disgrace. I believe it to be impossible for the slave trade with Cuba to be carried on, except-to a very small extent and at a risk that would make it not worth pursuing, if the Captain-General be determined to prevent it. He has abundant means at his command to hinder the linding of negroes, and, if landed, the registration system, properly enforced, affords a remedy. During the early period of Concha's rule, between two and three years ago, ho employed military posts and cordon.fl, and domiciliary visits to the plantationswere frequent. It is notorious why he has relaxed such praiseworthy vigilance. Although the Spanish Government affects to condemn and to do its utmost to prevent the slave traffic, and although the Spanish press does not lift up its voice in its behalf, a great many Spaniards, even of the more enlightened and professedlyliberal class, look upon it with a certain degree of favour, as necessary to. the interests of their colony. If you talk to one of these of the indignation felt in Eland at the continual violation of the treaty, he at once attempts to carry the war into your own country, and tells you that it is not philanthropy but a regard for our own West Indian interests that makes us so anxious to check the supply of slave labour to Cuba. You may as well not join issue on this point, for it w31i be hard to persuade a Spaniard that there exists in England a very large number of persons who, out of pure humanity, and without the slightest prospect of advantage to themselves, are at all times willing to make great efforts, and even sacrifices, to promote the abolition of slavery, and, since that seems at present impossible, of the slave trade. You remark, therefore, that English West Indian proprietors have a right to be protected from unfair and illegal competition, and that a treaty exists, ratified by Spain and paid for by England, by which the former Power binds itself to put a stop to the slave trade in its colonial possessions. Your Spaniard understands the nature of a bargain-money paid down for a consideration-so he contents himself with telling you that such a treaty ought never to have been signed, for that it is destructive of Spanish interests, and that Cuba, now so flourishing (thanks, he might add, to recent large importations of slaves), would sink and decline if the Africau flesh marke-s were closed to her. Here would be the place to bring in the suggestion of the abolition of slavery and substitution of free labour, but to this plan there are, indeed, many difficulties in the way, and, if Spain were brought to consent to its adoption, it would still be hard to find a guarantee that the free labourer in Spanish colonies should be, in fact, better off or better treated than a slave. Finally, and by way of clinching the sophisms with which he flatters himself he has utterly defeated you, he probably tells you that England should not make such a fuss about a few negroes taken into Cuba, when it is notorious that she has tens and hundreds of thousands of slaves in her East Indian possessions; or else that Spain has just as good a right to complain of the quantities of British manufactures smuggled into her territory and grievously damaging her revenue as Great Britain has of the contraband introduction of Africans into Spanish islands. To such arguments as these the only possible reply would be an offer to commence the education of the person addressing them to you. They have both been addressed to me within the last few days by Spaniards who pass for highly intelligent men, and whose position would necessarily imply (at least, in any country but this) the possession of a more than average amount of common sense and general information. A memoranduma was handed to Senor Pidal by Senor Lafragua on Saturday evening, comprising, as I am informed, a sort of qatimatum-a statement of the utmost concession which the MexicanEavoyconsiders himself justified in making on behalf of his Government. SenorPidalpromised to send a counter-memorandum. Should thisbe unfavourable, and should Senor Lafragua's recognition in his official character not immediately ensue, I believe there is scarcely a doubt that he will leave Madrid -within the week; indeed, he can scarcely do otherwise, nor would there be any use in his remaining longer. I find the Spaniards I converse with generally very bitter against Mexico; nor is this surprising, considering how much has been done to envenom the question, from the period of the Spanish Charg6 d'Affaires' ill-judged and overweening pretensions down to the present time. The impression seems to be that by force of arms they could soon bring Mexico to terms, and they appear scarcely to consider or remember the unpleasant and dangerous incidents that might spring from such a contest, the view the United States might take of it, and the possible intervention of England and France to put a decided stop to a war which would not be damagaing, only to the parties immediately concerned in it. They insist on considering it fully proved that the outrages perpetrated on Spanish residents in Mexico had a pohtical character. On what grounds they base this assertion I am unable to say, but I am not aware of any papers having been as yet published that contain proofs one way or the other. They accuse Mexico of bad faith, and point to the slowness of the proceedings instituted against the criminals. The proverbial sluggishness of Spanish tribunals ought perhaps to make them a little more indulgent to their cousins across the water. It is said that letters of marque have already been sent from Mexico to the United States, in anticipation of a war with Spain. The Spaniards would do well to think of the fell swoop that would be made upon their merchant navy as soon as the first gun was fired. That gun, too, would be wadded with all existing treaties between the two countries, including the convention for the payment of Spanish claims on Mexico--claims the larger half of which Mexico has declared herself ready to pay, leaving the remaining portion for revision. Spain must be very sanguine if she thinks that the ultimate results of an attack on Mexico would greatly mend her present position and enable her to lay down the law to a thoroughly vanquished opponent.

THE LATE MR. DOUGLAS JERROLD. On Saturday evening the series of performances 'in remnembrance" of Mr. Douglas Jerrold was most hapily inaugurated by the concert in St. Martin's. haI?. The names of the artists in the programme, com. pnsing those of Madame Novello, Miss Dolby, Mr. and Mrs. Weiss, Miss Mary Keeley, Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr. Albert Smith, Mr. P. Robson, Herr Ernst, Signor Bottesini, and Mr. Osborne, will be sufficient to show the varied nature of the entertainment. Probably a concert of so decidedly miscellaneous a character was never heard before, and few have given more general delight. The galleries were accessible at the low price of 1s., and the most fastidious could not but feel that lbe had enough for his money. A payment of 2s. obtained admission to the body of the hall, and there was a reserve of stalls at 5s. each, occupied by a most brilliant audience. A great number of the pieces were encored, and what was one of the most pleasing features in the whole affair was the interest taken by the artists in the performances of each other. The gentleman who has his time to himself may require to be reminded that vocal and instramental artists are probably engaged every afternoon and evening during the London season, and are utterly unable to be present at entertainments of which they do not themselves form a part. Hence, Mr. Albert Smith's story of the Engineer, with its accompanying song, and Mrr T. G. Reed's performance (in costume) of two characters from her "illusti ations," produced a freshness of mirth that wastruly exbilarating. To the credit of the artists whose names we have given it ihould 'oe mentioned, that none of them were personally solicited, but that all tendered their services spontaneously as soon as they beard that a committee had been formed to pay a tribute of respect to the memory of Mr. Jerrold. Some members of the Vocal Union likewise contributed their aid, and Messrs. Frank Mori, Francisco Berger, and Bene. dict were the oonductora. The zeal of the public for the encoura2ement of the "Jerrold perform ance" appears to be altogether bdundless. The rartof the stalls are alreadysecuredtohear Mr. Charles lDickens's "reading" of the C7 ritnra Carol tomorrowr (Tesday) ; and the managers of the Harmarket and Adelphi Theatres are beginning to "let" largely for the p'erformances on the 15t sand 29th Of July,
CALOR N.. (FROM OUB OWN CORFRPk -nlvWnr I SAN FRANCISCO, MAY 20. The aubject which has chiefly occupied us here for the last few days is the news-received last week of the destruction of a party of California Filibusters by the Mexicans in Sonora. The expedition which has ended so disastrously was headed by a Mr. Crabb, formerly a member of our Legislature, and who, of eourse, was dubbed for the monee a " general."a The " general's" laudable object was to wrest x; et arTmis the State of Sonora from Mexico, and afterwards to trust to the chapter of accidents for whatever might turn up-probably annexation or ale to the United States. He appears to have been aided and abetted in this ambitious project by a few Mexican traitors who had attached themselves to the | expedition, and who all fetl with it. For the rest, it was made up of about 100 "C fast men" from various parts of California, who had not beenfavoured with the smiles of fortune in the El Dorado. At the beginning of April 92 of these desperadoes entered Sonora wel armed and provided with munitions of war, but professing peaceable purposes, whicb, however, they did not deign to define. On their arrival at Cavorca, a Mexican town, near Point Lobos, on the Gulf of California they encountered a stout resistance from the Mexican troops and inhabitants. Fighting was kept up for six days until the houjo in which the Americans had taken shelter was set on fire, when the survivors of the party surrendered. These numbered 51, who, " with Crabb at their head, and beariDg a white flag, marched out unarmed and delivered themselves up to the MIexicans. The next morning the whole body, except Crabb anda lad of 15 years, were led out and shot in squads of five and ten each." Rank and file, general, officers, and subs, seem to have been treated with scant ceremony, for the account goes on to relate that "Crabb was taken to the front of the house where he had fought, his face turned towards a pillar, his hands tied and drawn above his head, and, standing thus, was shot from behind. His head was then cut off mand carried to the office of the judge, placed upon a table, and exposed to the jeers of the poputace." Not satisfied with this total destruction of their prisoners, a party of 25 Mexican troops proceeded 'to a place caled Sonorita, within the line of the Gadsden purchase (as this portion of American territory is called), and there kdlled four of Crabb's party, who were lying wounded in the house of an American citizen. The wholeband ls, in fact, annihilated. The intelligence has not ereated much sensation in San Francisco. The large draughts of Filibusters for Walker's expeditions and the expulsion of eo many of a similar or worse class by the Vigilance Committee have purified our moral and political atmosphere, and a much healthier feeling exists here now than formerly. We now feel that Filibusterism has received its death-blow. ; The recelt news of Walker's desperate situation mnakes it probable that the Nicaragua route will soon be reopened, and the lines of steamers again placed upon their former stations from New York and New Orleans to Greytown, and from San Juan to San Francisco. The accounts of the dissolution 'of Walker's followers are expected by every arrival from Nicaragua. iA waggon road has been completed across the Isthmus of TehuanteDec, upon which a line of stages will soon be placed for the conveyance of passengers to and from California, while the American Government is taldng measures for constructing a road across the Rocky Mountains to this country, so that there will shortly be ample means of communication, by which a large ummigration is looked for. Notwitbstanding a cry of "hard times" which prevails among u at present, California has made great progress within the last two years in industrial pursuits. For some years almost the only use made of capital was to invest it in or lend it upon !real estate. These sources are now nearly exhausted, and attention is turned to manufacturing industry of various kinds. Several iron works, breweries distilleries, and oil refineries and flourmills have been worked for some time successfully, and lately a paper mill and a cordage and oakam factory, and a sugar refinery on an extensive scale, have been established. These are important agents for developing the resources of the country and for supplying the wants of the population, while they give employment to a great many persons unfit to work in the mines. Labour continues to be highly paid, although the prices of provisions and rents have fallen greatly. Vages vary according to the capacity of the employed. Men servants get from $35 to $50 a- month and their board, women $30 to $40, but good cooks for restaurants and hotels get $100 to $120 a-month, besides board and lodging. From the mines the accounts are, as usual, most flourishing. In quartz mining a great advance has been made of late years The business is now weU understood, and where it is undertaken with sufacient capital, and conducted with skill and judgment, pays handsomely. The breeding of sheep is a business which is attracting much attention at present. From the experimnents which have been made with different breeds brought from Australia and New Mexico the fact is established that the country is well adapted for sheep raising and for wool growing. The pastures are abundant and the climate suitable. A recent sheep-shearing has produced excellent wool, which will find its way to the English market shortly. Several silver mines have been recently discovered in the southern portion of the State, but none of them have been worked. A good deal of speculation is likely to be set up in tins article. I have no definite information as yet upon the sabject. It is stated that a sample of the ore assayed in San Francisco yielded $250 to the ton. A new quicksilver mine is now worked in the neighbourhood of the well-known New Almaden mine. Its operations have not yet produced more than 4,0001b. of quicksilver per month, bat means are in progress to extend the works. The L.igislature some three years ago imposed a heavy poll-tax upon all Chinese immigrants ($50 a head), whtich had the untoward effect of keeping these useful creatures out of the country. This tax has been declared unconstitutional, and, in coneequenee, the immigration has been renewed. Several thousands have lately arrived, and great swarms are preparing to leave China for California. A considerable trade is springing up in Californian w;ine. The grapes are excellent, and those who profess po be judges assert that every description of wine, from ordinary claret to spark;ling champagne, may be manufactured from them. Talking of " manufactures," there Is no country, as I have frequently had occasion to remark, which manufactures divorces waith the same facility and to the same exztent as we do inCalifornia. As an intstance, I clip from one of the papers: " Within a very few months we have had (in San Fran. Cisco only) 130 cases of divorce, 21 at the requlest of the hubands, and 106 at the prayer of the ladies. This fact decdeos the amiability of the gentlemen. we are at a lo-s to account for the frequency of these * dissolving views' Money is abundant, and interest falling. The receipts of golddwst from the interior have been large. Interest is at from i* to 2i per cent, per month, and but little demand for money. Gold is worth $17 to $18 per ounce. Very little is now sold. as the greatest part goes to the Mint. Bar ar, quoted at 870. Spanish dollars are at 12 per cent. premium for India. A large amount of business has been done in merchandise during the fortnight, but, except in domestic produce, which has sold well, the rates obtained have not left much profit. Large shipments of Californian barley are being made to New York. The incoming crop of this grain wil be abundant, but wheat and oats will be rather short, owing to an unusual length of dry weather in the spring. In corroboration of my notice of the favourable state of matters in the mining region, I quote the following remarks from one of the San Francisco papers pablished this morning:- The accounts from the aines are all of an encouraging character, and from the heavy deposits of snow in the mounnts, the probabilities are that he miners will have a good supply of water thronghout the entire year. This 'will to a certain estent interfere v;ith the river wvashings in the fall, hut the loss 'will be far more than compensated by the increased steady yield of the tuunel and hill claims."

T THE RuFDER, OF MR- LITThE, - The public investigation into the chargo p ferred agauPt Spollen by his wife took place this morning before the magistrates of Cael4treet Police-office, who upon this oocasion .hlad the assistance of Mr. Porter, the senior magistrate of the head office. Shortly,after 11 oelock the prisoner was conducted into the court, whiclh XAS densely crowded. Mr. Corballis, Q.C., law advier to the Castle, and the Crown olicitor attended to conduct the probecution. Thewitnes for the proseoutionhaving been dret to withdraw, Mr. O'Donnell (magistrate) inquired whether the prisoner had any profesional aeiItanch Spoleni, in a perfectly calm =nd collected manner, sCid that he had written to Mr Madonougih, Q.., sand Kr Whiteside, QnC., but bad been unable to procmr the ;erz vices of either. He had no means to fee an attorney, add, under those circumstances, he claimed the indulgente of the awma in every respeot that a persat placed in his ptbtion reqIred, and h trusted it would not be denied lihin, freely, calmly, and impartially. Mr. Corbais said he would at onor consent to the prif roner's application if be thought that anoncompliatce ane it would prejudice the fair cours of juAstice,bth fc was that the examination had been postponed h ntil this periodl in order that he mnight bave an opportunity of taindng the necessry preparation. If he didl not aval himPelf of this the Crown wua not to blame, asd he (sr. Coro ballis) bhould proceed -with the case. The prcioner said it wa anseriousthin to bring a Cbarge of this mature against a man and not alnow him the assstance which it was in the power of the lae-toafford. He did snot think any prosecution would wish t6 take advantage of a lman in his position, andhe ished topro his application upon every gentleman with any kind of feeling. It was ultimately resolvedstonadoum tbheroceedingfor abrouf priod, and a constable was despatched to a Profesioatel gentlemr wheome the purdsoer 2ndicatd.

He zaid be bad no inteition of doing more than to convey to the magistrates a general view of the case in order to pla theo in a posdtion the better tv ed herstand the nature of the informations which would be tendered against the prisoner. Having referred to the poition of the iate Mr. Little in the Midland rAilway Companoy, the learned oounsl said that the prisonerwasalsoi the employment of the railway company as general t handy man,' and. occupied a cottage at the Briortione Harbour. The charge brought against poUen was, that his was the hand which deprived Mr. Little of life on thel13th of November lastli.Im mediantely after the discovery of the murder suspicion began to attach to many persons conected with the railway, some of them beingin a most respectable walk in life; and one of the most consolng reflections in connexion with the presnt position of the case was itha4 those persons would he elieved from the dreadful suspicions which had been unjustly cat upon them. From the date of the committal of the murder until within the past week the authorities had been unable to discover any clue to the maurderer, but at this time certoain informa.o was afforded to the police which led them to institute an inquiry,which resulted in the present charge. The Crown did not, propose to offer any direct evidence of guilt against the accused. It was purely a case of drcumstantial evidence; but, nevertheless, evidence of such a chaaceter as would, he thought, convey to the bench no dsruht whatever of the guilty participation of James SPOilen in the murder of George Samuel little. The Crown pro poe oprove that a certain portion of the property Whic whadbeenin the possession of Mr. Little, as cashier of the glidland Great Wester Railway, was observed in the hands of the primner on the very night of the murder, and' thata similar parcel had since been disovered wrappedum in a piec of calico which had been traced to the prisoner' home. They would prove the acqaintanofe which the i soner from bis occua tion must have had with the habritse of the deceased, andthe facluities which he had for proceeding unobserve and unquestioned to the office Of Mr. Little, and, having perpetrated the crime, effectingchis escpe a, alsecret and unsuspected manner. They would, in addition, prove the absence of the accused from heome lrom half-pasti o'clock on the evening of the murder until 10 o'cloer. These, along with otp6r matters which would be given in evidence, 'would forma the grounds upon iwhich the Crown sought for the committal of the prisoner to take his trial.

Afterpartaking of edinnerprovided in averysuperior style byMessrs. Elkington and Shrewsbury, the chairman proposed the usual loyal toasts, which were drunk with *athusiasm. The annual rgrt of the society was then read by the secretary, Mr. . G. Rogers. The society was established in 1832 to enab)le the law clerks of the metropolis to make Eome provision for themselves and families in sickness, old age, or other infirmity, and on death. A mutual association was afterwards formed to afford assistance in temporary distress. All law clerks whether members or not, were allowed to participate in the benefit of this fund. The two f,,nds were Acept distinct. Among the benefits are a weekly allowance of 11. in sickness ; pensions payable weekly, from Ios to 14s. ; a payment on a member's death of .501. ; and on the death of a member's wife a payment of 251. Last year 18 persons received relief; this year 29 have been releved, and the amount paid to these 29 members was 2471. 14s. The total amount received by members on account of illness has bcen 3,7351. 5a. 10d. There are seven members in receipt of the weekly allowance. One who had been in receipt of it had since died. Re contributed to the society's funds 401. 6s., in return for which wzs received, on the death of his wife, 251. ; in illness, 811. 18s. ; on superannuation, 1201. 7s.; in all 2671. ls.; and on his death a further sum of 501. was paid to his family. In the preceding year the number of deaths of menibers was four; in the year just past nine. To the family of each 501. had been paid, making a total payment on account of death alone of ,632l. 14s. fid. The contributions have- amounted this year to 1,4631. 8s., besides a donation of 30 guineas from the Hon. Society of the Middle Temple. On the 7th of April, 1856, the investmeints amounted to 19.3991. 8s. Id., since which 2,5981. Ile. bad been received. The investments on the 20th of May, 1856, amounted to 19,7281. Ss. 5d. On the 20th of May, 1857. they were 21.0321. 16s. lld. The relief afforded out of the casual fund consisted of small gifts not exceeding 51., not restricted to members, but granted to all lawkolerks and their widows, snd to the children of deceased members, but the applicants mxut be deserving persons, suffering from temporary distTess not the result of their own misconduct. The Chairman, in proposing prosperity to the society, expressed his Freat satisfaction at the report which had been just read. The object of the society was to enable a laborious and meritorious class of men to make provision against the hour of infirmity, sickness, and need for themselves and their families-a olass of men but for whom the laborious a dministration of the law-nay, he might add, the business of society, could hardly go on, and yet men whom, in spite of their exertions, the casualties and chance's of life often placed in a position of necessity which caUled for the assistance of nuch a society as that which they were then muet to support. The " Hlealth of the Lord Chancellor and the other Patrons of the Society" was then proposed by Mr. Roundell Palmer; after which Mr. M. Smith propoEed the " Health of the Chairmoan" in terms of high eulo]y, which were enthusiastically cheered by thefcompany. Tbe Lord Chief Justice acknowledged the complinment in terms of great warmth and earnestness, declaring that he knew of no assembly of men the tribute of wlose Xegad he would more gladly accept or more deeply value,

The testator died in 1825, and the defendant, Frederick Findon, his second son, proved the will. Mary Findon, the daugter referredl to in the will, was married in 1827 to Francis Demsinbray, ancd had one child, which died in its infalny. No settlement was made on the marriage, but the sum of 2,5001. had been set apart by the defendant and the interest paid to Mary D)emainbray so leng as she lived. She survived her husband, and died in 1856, when the plaintiffs, as the surviving children of Francis Fmndon, claimed the fund by virtue of the gift over -contained in the will.

SECOND COURT. In the course of the day, Lord CASr^BEsL, in reference to the large entry of causes, said, it was most desirable that there should be a Second Court, but great difficulty had been experienced in obtaining the assistance of a second judge in consequence of the various avocations of the judges, and their necessary attendance in the House of Lords; but he (Lord Campbell) believed that by great exertions and some sacrifices a Second Court would be formed on Tuesday next, and for the rest of the week. T3101AS V. REYNOLDS. Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Webster, and Mr. Salter appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Atherton, Q.C., Mr. H. Hill, Q.C, and Mr. Hindmarch for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action, Mr. Thomas, was a nianufacturer, carrying on business in Oheapaide, in the city, and he sued the defendant, George W. Reynolds, a stay manufac. turer, in Broad-street, Birrmingham, to recover damages for the infringement of a patent which had been gtanted to the plaintiff on the lst of December, 1846, for "improvements in machinery for sewing or stitching various fabrics." The defendant, among other pleas, pleaded two pleas, denying the novelty of the plaintiff's invention, and aso tho infringement by the defendant. It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that his patent was dated the Ist of December, 1846, and was granted for "improvements in machinery for sewing or stitching various fabrics." By the specification subsequently enrolled it appeared that- " The invention cousists in certain novel arrangemeuts of macinery, whereby fabrics of various textures mnay be eewn together in such a maLner as to produce a 6rm aud lasting seam. The principal novelty of this invention ia the covbhleation of a vibratinx needle with a ebottle, which shuttle, when the moint of the needlei haa entered the cloth or other f.brise under operation. and formed a loop of thread, pases through that loop. and leaves a thread on the face of the cloth, nwbich means the need!e when it is withdrawn from the cloth, iastead of drawiLg back the thread withL It leaves a tigbtened loop on the oppoEltosideof thecloth to thatat which itentered. The fabric, then asaintg foiwrwd to the distatce of the length of the stitch required. Is again Pierced with the needle, and a stitch is in like maimer produced."' After describing the nature of the machinery by which he effected his object the plaintiff claimed as follows:- " 1. The general arrangemonet of machinery above described, and shown In sheet 1 of the drawings, whereby l am enabled to unite p!ecess of cloth or other fabrics together by sewing either staight ot curved eamse, such sewing being more speedily and economically effected than hyhand. 2 2. I claImr the application of a shuttle In combination with a needle, as shown in sheet 1 of the drawings, for forming and secuaring loops of thread or other substance, fr the purpose of Producing titches either to unite or ornament various fabrics, whatever may be the means employed for working suoh shuttle saTd needle. But I do not claim the use In a machine of several needles aud shuttles : nor do I claim any of the mechanical parta separately of which the machinery ahown In the dr *wluo is composed. "3.

But at that time the plaintiff found great difficulty in adapting the machine to the purposes of his trade, arising from the wretchedly low rate of wages in the sewing trade. Bat the discovery of gold in California and Australia caused the needlewomen to emigrate, and at the same time created so great a demand for various kinds of clothing that the machine was without difficultv brought into use, and established its credit. Since that time the machine had been introduced into various departments of trade, and was now used in the making of boots, shirts, collars, linen fronts; &.c., to such perfection, that it was impossible that the fineness and evenness of the stitches could be excelled. In some departments it had completely superseded hand labour, but, instead of its being prejudicial to the interests of the persons employed, it had actually had the effect of raising their wages, and the poor needlewoman who fornerly earned only 7s. 6d. a-week, could now earn from 17s. to 20s. a-week. So that in this, as in other instances, it would appear that more hands were employed; and, from the diminished cost, an immense benefit to the public was the result. Mr. Carpmael and Mr. Newton were examined, and explained the -nature of* the plaintiff's process, which may be described thus :-A needle grooved on both sides, and with an eye near the point, was either fixed to a lever or to a slide attached to a lever. The lever was actuated, or set in motion, by a " camn surface" on a rotary axis. The thread supplied by a bobbin passed through the eye of the needle, and the needle was made to pass through the fabric to be sewn, the fabric being at the saine time pressed between two surfaces, through which there were holes for the needle to pass throueh. The needle was then drawn back, and left the thread which had passed through in the form of a loop. A shuttle then carried another thread through the loop so formed, and as the needle was drawn out the thread was prevented by the other thread from returning, and so a stitch was formed, Other stitches were formed in the same manner, and to such a perfection has the patented machne been.now brought by the plaintiffs son,t who has taken out Feveral patents for improvements on the machine now in question, that 1,000 stitches can be made in one minute. The machines were exhibited in court and set to work, so that the jurv had an opportunity of seeing the interesting results. The plaintiff stated that every article of clothing which he heu on, with the single exception of the soles of Iis boots, was made by his sewing machines. Thirty different kinds of clothing made by the plaintiff's machinery were exhibited to the jury, and excited general admiration, so that at length the 'court bore very much the appearance of a ready-made warehouse in wbich a party bound for the diggings or the East Iudies was choosing a suitable outfit. The scene reached its climax when the Lord Chief Justice rose from his seat, and banded to the jurymen a large reversible Californian coat, black on one side and brown on the other; and earnestly fixing his eyes on some finely worked linen fronts-whether for ladies or gentlemen we could not see-inquired their price, with the appendant studs. (Loud laughter.) No question was made as to the utility of the invention; and, as to the infringement, it appeared that the defendant, a staymlaker at Birmingham, had 40 machines at work at his establishment, which he had bought of Messrs. Grover, Baker, and Co., machine makers, at New York (the real defendant.;), and which there was no doubt were made after the plaintiff's speoification, In fact, some of them had the plaintifi's name, "H owe's Patent." impressed upon them. At the close of the plaintiffs case, Mr. AiHERTON submitted that there was nocasefor the ;ury. According to the evidence already given it was prove- that the plaintiff's second claim, the application of the sha'tle in combination with a needle for forming and sfeuring loops of thread for the purpose of producing titches was identical with the process patented by Fisher and GiDbons in 1844; and, as to the plaintiff's third claim, which Yeferred to the slidinaeframe, which held the fabric in such a manner that it could be moved in any required 'directirn, to receive straight and curved lines of stitches, tebe learned counsel contended that that was identical with Dunoan's sliding frame patented so far back as 1804. Lord CA-'lxsrELL said, he was clearly of opinion that there was evidence to go to the jury, both as to the novelty of the plaintiff's invention, and as to the infringement by the defendant. The counsel for the defendant then called several witnesses to prove the identity of the plaintiff's process with the two processes referred to. It appeared that Fisher and Gibbons's patent was for improvements in the manufacture of lace; and, tbough it was clearly proved that the stitch used was precisely the same as that used bythe plaintifE it appeared that the machine was not properly a sewing marhine, but a lace-making machine. It was. however, stated that it would sew, and that it actually performed that ope. ration.. The plaintiftl's sliding frame was also said tohe identical with Duncan's frame of 1804. which it appeared was used in embroidery. The only difference which the witnesses acknowvledged was that the plaintiff's frame was aetuated by a "rackand pulley," and Duncan's bly "screws," which were said to be " mechanical equivalents." Mvr. ATrlEsRTOIN, Q. C., and Sir F. THIsSiGER having severally addressed the ju ry upon the evidence, Lord CAMPBELL summed up. His Lordship said, he was sorry to Pay that Air. Baker did not appear to great advantage in this proceeding. A countryman of his (Mr. Howe), bad become the inventor of a most useful machine - and it was to the honour of the American people that they distinguished themselves so mueb, and Pin nothing more tban by their inventions. That invention, the value of which the jury had had an opportunity of est. mating, had been sold to the plaint who had taken out a patent,as he was atliberty to do,a¢cording to the law of this count-ry. For ten long years he hada remained in undisturbed possession of his patent; but Baker had now sent over to this country machines which clearly claimed to he Hlowe's invention, sand some of which actually habd HIowe's narae snt np~on them. That being the ease, and an action being bryn t by te plaintiff agait the aefmat, stya ekeer at Bi=gharm, what do6e BAter. .ao? We sayc he ras not infringed Eowe's patent, although he has put on them the name of Howe as. the maker. But when the case was brought into court the counsel for the defendant felt that it would not be decent to set up such a defence, and to call on the jury to say that there had been no infringement. The only queation then raised was as to the vadity of the plaintiff's patent. It was said that there was no novelty in it, and, out of the eight points of obiectlon of which notice bad been given, two only were relhed upon-viz., that the plaintiff's second claim was anticipated by Fisher and Gibbons's patent of 1844, and his third claim by Duncan's patent of 1804. After reading over the evidence on both sides his Lordship said, it would be for the jury to say whether or not either of those patents was substantially the same as the plaintiff's. If they, or either of them, were EO, the defendant would be entitled to a verdict; but if the jury thought there was a substantial difference they ought to find their verdict for the plaintiff. The jury, without the least hesitation, found a verdict for the plaintiff with 40s. damages. Lord CAmPBELL said,he would give all the necessary certificates to entitle the plaintiff to costs, &c. (Sittings at *iii Snus. at Westeminrter, before Afr. ATwice 13RLP and a Specia Jury.) BEATmIS V. TEE LONDON, BRIOGTOI, AND SOUTH COAST RAILWAY COMPANY. Mr. Enowles, Mr. Wilde, and Mr. indmarsh were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill, hr. Webster, and Mr. Aston for the defendants. This action was brought to recover damages for the infDingement of a patent granted in Decemnber, 1840, to the plaintiff for a lathe ho be used in the preparation of railwa w.heels, by which two wheels fixed in the same axle could be bored or turned, driven from or by the same mean cone pulley. The defendants pleaded that the invention was not new. It appeared that the patent granted to the plaintiff had expired in December, 1854, but it was not unti nearly two years after that the action was commenced. The case came on for tril in June, 1856, and the plaintiff obtained a verdict, which was subsequently set aside and a new tral ordered. Theplaintiff, in the specification of his patent claimed as new the combination of apparatus by which he produced the desired result of turning two wheels at the same time. In support of his case Mr. Locke, Mr. Stephenson, Mr. FothergilL and other engineers were called. They stated that the invention of the plaintiff was a new and important one, which fully effected its purpose, and according to their experience was, at the date of the patent, perfectly new; thatit was usefulto effect its purpose and a complete machine; and that the machines used by the defendants in their works were of the same construction. To support their pleas the defendants attempted to show that at the date of thevatent there were machines at work in various places eubstantially the same as that of the plaintiff's. Three models were produced in court. The first was that of a lathe used at the Milton Works, but the defendants failed to show it ws in use in December, 1840, and abandoned so much of their case as depended on it; the second machino had been invented in 1838 by a Mr. Crossley, and used at Royton Works for turning pulleys; the third was a modification of it, which was used at Brymbo Works for boring and turning pipes. Mr. Justice ERLa left it to the jury to say whether the machine of the plaintiff was substantialy the same as those relied on by the defendants. The plaintiff admitted all the ingredients of his machine were old, but claimed that the combination of them to produce the desired result was new. The jury fouud for the plaintiff. It was agreed that the damages should be assessed at the amount found in the former trial-1241., being a royalty of 10 per cent. on the price of the machines used by the defendants.

COTURT OFP COMf0wn PT.TR¶A 4 XT ')7 GAUNTLET V. UG ANMB ELtTA7P. (Sittings at Westminster, in Banco, before the LrOBD CRImE JrUsTICE, 2fr. Justice CRESSNvELL and lMr. Justwice WThLL'AAMS 2Tis was a rule for reducing by 40s. the verdict found for the plaintiff, with 31. 6s. damages, on the ground that the defendant Eliott was not liable for the act of his co-defendant in takmng certain books aud papers. Mr. hL LLOYD showed cause against, and Mr. LuSH, Q.C., supported the rule. The action, which was tried at the Middlesex Sittings after Easter Term, before Mr. Justice William;, was in trespass for takingand detaining books of accounts, receipts4 invoices, and other papers, and the goods and chattels of the plaintif. The defendants by their pleas denied the trespass, and justified under a distress for rent. It appeared at thetrial thattheplaintiff wastenantof some premises at Camden-town under the defendant Elliott, and that the other defendant King, a broker, acting under the landlord's authority to distrain, had siezed, among other things, some gas fittings, some door keys, and a quantity of hooks of acceunts, invoices, receipts, and other papers, all of which were assumed at the trial to be not distrainable. For the defence it was then contended that as to the books of accounts and papers they were not, in fact, distrained at all, having been inserted in the inventory; and, further, with respect to the defendant Elliott, that he was not liable by reason of his broker having exceeded his authority in taldng them. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 31. 6s. damages, being 12. for the gas fittings, s. for the keys, and 40s. for the books and papers, leave beiag reserved to the defendants to move to reduce the damages by the value of the books and papers. In opposition to the rule it was now urged that the circumstance of the bcooks and papers not having beer inserted in the inventory was immaterial, they having in fact been seized and carried away by Eing avowedly for the rent, and that Elliott had subsequently recognized the act of the broker by proposing to return the books if the plaintiff would give up possession of the premises. In support of the rule, it was argued by Mr. LusH that Elliott was not liable for articles improperlI taken by his broker, citing " Freeman r. Rosher" (13 Q. ., 7S0). Moreover, these books and papers cannot be said to have been distrained at alL The LORD CBaiF JusTicE.-The rallenust be discharged. The evidence shows that these goods were in faet taken by way of a distress. Without waiting to ascertain what the things in the cupboard were, King directed them all to be removed. Mr. Justice Wuffams was of the same opinion. According to Ning's own account, he desired his men to clear the closet. He caanot pu-ge the trespass by any subsequent act. The learned judge, in the course of ie argumnent, intimated that, although it was assumed throughout the trial that these books and papers were not distrainable, and the question whether they were so or not was not raised by the rule, he must not be understood as quite acquiescing in that proposition. .A'%S V.

The rest of the dy. was occupied with this case, which turned upon the right of one partner to bind another by drawing a check :n the partnership name, and the reasonable. ness of the time within which such a check must be presented for payment.

(ftintsa at Xii Prius, at Guildhlz, befomc Mr. JTustic WnLL3s and aOmmon Juries.) GIESIER AND OThERS V. RUIG. Mr. Sergeant Shee, Mr. Prentice, and Mr. Lewis were counsel for the plaintiffs; and Mr. Skinner, Q.C,, and Mr. Norman appeared for the defendant. The plamtiffs are wine rerchants, carrying on business in Fenchuroh-street, and this action was brought to recover damages from the defendant, who is a builder, for having erected certain shelves in their sample-room in so negligent a manner that they had given way and destroyed a large quantity of bottles containing wine placed on these shelves. It appeared that in the first instance the defendant had built for the plaintiffs a partition of wood, and by their instruction it had bean constructed very slightly, but still sufficiently strongly for the purposes of a mere partition. Afterwards the plaintiffs required that some tiers of shelves should be added ou to the face of this partition. Thess also were eventually erected, after having been altered at the wish of one or other of the plaintifis no less than three times. The purposes for wbich they were intended were answered for some months, but one day theygave way, and a number of bottles containing wine were nrecipitated to the ground and broken. The plaintiffs said t1iat Mr. King's instructions were to make such shelves as would hold their samples in safety, and that he was liable for the consequences of their failure so to do. The defendant contended that he had made t3ie partition by contract, and bad not anticipated that shelves would have to be added ; that when he put up the shelves he proposed strengthening them by placing certain upright supports such as had been used for the sample shelves already there, but that one of the plaintiffs objected on the ground that such additions would spoil the iffect of the sauaples; that one or other of the plaintiffs was always Dresent dur. ing the progress of the work, and that each had given the defendant and his men orders as to how it was to be done.-"what one ordered one day, another unordered the next day ," and that, if the shelves had been put up as he (Mr. Kingg) wished, they never would have fallen. One of the main points made by the plaintiffs was that the screws fastening the brackets supporting the shelves were not driven into the thick uprights of the partition, but into the thin material intervening. The defendant laid great stress upon the fact that the plaintiffs had loosened the shelves by using a ladder and reaching over to them from a distance so bearing too heavily upon a partition which by their owa orders was made very slight. The learned JuDvn Saving carefully summed up, the jnry retired, and eventually, having been absent until after the rising of the Court, found a verdict for the defendant. BORKRARDT V. SALTER. Theplaintiffisapicturedealer, andthedefendant is aclergy. man at Exeter, and this action was brought to recover the amount of an 1. 0. U. given for oil paintngs; also for some additional sums for engravingssupplied, and for the expenses of the plaintiffin travelling for the purpose of endeavourin to raisemoney for payment of his own debt. The sum claimed was 3051. 3s., and Mr. Warren, Q.C., who appeared for the plaintiff, said that the action was undefended. Mr. Wordsworth, Q.C., however, appeared for the defendant, and sue. xeeded in reducing the amount to 2831. 3s., for which a verdict was given by the jury under the direction of the learned Judge, who granted immediate execution on an aflidavit stating that MIr. Salter had settled two other debts on being arrested, and that he had advertised for sale his property at Heavittee, including the very pictures sold to BRA AND WIFE V. SCHIOLES. Mr. Serjeant Shea and Mr. V. Williams appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. R. James was counsel for the defendant. In this action the plaintiffs sought to recover damages for injuries done to the female plaintiff by the servant of the de. fendant, wvho in stepping out of his master's cart in Breadstreet trod on r.ea leb shoulder and hurt her somewhat The facts of th case were very simple. The cart of the defeadait a carman in Wite Horse-yard, was standing near the end of Bread.street, and not farfrom the residence cf the plaintifs, when the driver, not seeing Mre. Beale, who was passing or. standing close to him, got out and set his foot upon her shoulder. Being an old woman, she was hoth shocked and hurt, and the main qnestion seemed to be whether under the circrunstances the servant's aot could bo traced to the master, soas to make hin liable ; the pl*ntiffs contending that if the carman was gettirg out of tho cart in the course of the execution of his master's business the latter was liable for the result of any neggence in his mode of performing his duty. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, damages 20s.
I COURT OF EXCEQUER, SATDAY. n - (NUM9S at Nisi Prius, before the CIEF BABoA at Guildhall.) These sittings commenced to-day with a list containing 109 causes. Of these 16 are remanets, and 32 are marked for trial by specialjunes. 8SCHEINDLER V. SmIrrE Mr. Joyce was counsel for the plaintiff; yr. Hawkio8 apueared for the defendant. This was an action to recover a picture. Thoe plaintiff and a friend swore that the pictiire in question had been de=oD sited for safe custody in the house of the defendant on his own offer, andc that he afterwards refused to give it up unless he was paia 5. for warehouse-room. The defendant and a friend denied this account of the transaction, and proved that though the picture had originally belonged to the plaintiff, she had handed it over to tha defendant's friend (a gentleman with prodigious whiskers and, moustache, who went by the soubriquet of "the Flea," as the plaintifPs friend stated, because he owned the once celebrated "Industrious Fleas) as a security for a debt, by whom it had been placed iD the hands of the defendant. In the course of the case it transpired that the plaintiff had Dleaded " Guilty" to an indictinent for keeping a brothel, while " the Flea" admitted that his claim upon the plaintiff was for services rendered to the plaintiff In several "dirty transacions." The Cmrr BARoN said there was nothling he looked upon with so much horror as a human being engaged in the rosecution of practices disclosed in the course of this case. The best advice he could give to the jury was tofinda verdict for the defendant, if they could not make up their minds that either side was entitled to credit,for the plaintiff was bound always to satisfy the jury that he was right, while the defenaant stood upon the defensive. The jury, after a brief deliberation, returned a verdict for the defendant.
COURT of BANKRUPTCY, Basin a&8sre4, June 27 __ _ THE BASTIEGS 0D B . Afv- lk .Ur. wNY asow presented a petition for adjudication of bankruptcy against Messrs.

The CoSManSSrONr' held the evidence insnflicient. Mr. IRwsucE also presented a petition for the same purpose. Mr. WrLrsoN applied under the 5th and 6th rules of the Court for three days to prosecute his petition. His petition being the first on the files of the Court he was entitled to this privilege. Mr. LA;vR1ACE said he was prepared with ample evidence to support his petition. If three days were allowed to Mr. Wilkinson the Crown might put in an extent and sveep off a large amount of property. The CoOar oNEo thought the rules rnost impolitic which gave an unprepared petitioner three days' stat over a petitioner who was prepared. He strongly advised the withdrawal of the first petition. 3Mr. LAWBAxCz was willing to pay the whole of the costs if Mr. Wilkinson would adopt-this suggestion. Mr. WiLxNsoy declined to do so.

IXSOLVENT DBBTORS' COURT. June 27. 12T BE WILLIAM GEOP. Th=WAl). L. C'?- ? TXhc heaxing of this case was resumed this morning and occupied several hours, but the inquiry beingsolely directed to the consideration given by Mr. E. R. Cbrk for the securities exeouted to him by the insolvent, possessed no feature of publio interest. Upon the termination of the inquiry an application was made for the appointment of an assignee, but the Court declined at present to make any order. Mr. Sargood, Mr. Reed, Mr. Casrteen, Mr. Way, Mr. Denney, and Mr. M'Oubrey appeared as counsel for various parties; and Mr. S. B. abrahams, a creditor, appeared in person. * It was found impossible to complete the reqnired amendments to the schedule without some delay, and as there was no opposition offered to the insolvent's discharge, his colunsel applied that he might be allowed to go at large upon sureties for a small amount during the adjournment. The learned COsn,nSSIO1mR acceded to the request and ha11 was accepted intwo sureties for 601. each until July 27,
POLICE. MASIOX-HOUSE.-Timothy Bates was charged before Sir R W. CARDmR with having feloniously and violently assaulted Mr. John Houston, and robbed him of his wateb. Mr. Houston said,-I am one of Her Majestv's Royal Body Guard, and am now residing at No. 4, St. Thomss's. street east, Borough. I was coming from Hungerford. market yesterday on board a steamboat, about half-pest i o'clock, to London-bridge, and just as I was leaving the boat at Dyer's hall-pier the prisoner snatcbed my watch from my pocket and broke the rng of the watch, and attempted to ran off with the watch. I seized him immediately, but he was rescued by several men who were of his party, and he was then seized by a young sailor. I believe my watch was passed by the prisoner to the man who rescned hira from me. I caught the ring and the guard chain, and the watch was dragged violentlyfrom the ring. The other men who assisted in rescuing the prisoner struck the witness Knight. The prisoner had not any coat on wben he snatched my watch, the value of which was about 5Z. Thomas Maguire said,-I am a sailor, and reside in Fellstreet, Wood-street, Cheapside. I came on board the boat, and as the last witness was landing I saw the prisoner snatch his watch, and the moment he did so a crowd surrounded him. Mr. Houston, the last witness, cauaht hold of the prisoner, who was immediately rescued by his confederates. The prisoner had his coat on his arm. I tried to getat him, but I was shoved away, and a young fellow (the witness Knight) got hold of him, but was struack and knocked down, and I then ran round to the front and caught the prisoner as he was running up the gangway. The prlsoners mate said, " Let him go, we'll pay you well for it," but I slewed his arm round and held him tiU the offl'er came. The prisoner's mate then got away. I saw the prisoner with the watch in his hand, andhe put hishand round and passed the watch to the other man. Joseph Knight said,-I am employed at the pier. I know the prisoner from his going backwards and forwards by the boats, and I also know the other man who accompanied him. I seized the prisoner as he was wrestling with the gentleman, and the other man who was with the prisoner, and had on a Guernsey frock, knocked me down. The pisoner then got away from my graso, and was stooped by te last witness. I did not see anything of the watch. Bennett, 501 N. said,-I was coming off the penny.boatpier, at London-bridge, and was sentfor to take the prisoner, whom I found in Maguire's custody. I searched him and found lOd. on hnm. The prisoner was committed for trial. He was, he assured the Alderman, an innocent man. It was stated that the prisoner had a little before robbed a gentleman of his watch in Trafalgar square, and been appre- ended bytwo officers of the metropolitan force for the offence; but the gentleman, having had pressing business in the country, from which he had just arrived by the train. would not press the charge, and that the policeman had allowed the thief to go without subjecting bim to any detention, although there was no doubt of the commi6sion of the offence. Mr. Houston (the prosecutor in the present case) stated to Sir R.W. CARDgZN that, In aU probability. if the pris,nerhad been detained by the metropolitan officers, the second robbery would not have been committed. Sir R. W. OARDsIN said be thought the proeecutor ought to represent the matter to the Commissioners of the Metropolitan Polce, and the prosecutor said he would certainly take the advice. WOslip.STREErT.-WiUliam Mann, a diminutive wretched-looking young man, described as a shoemalker was charged before Mr. HAVmrsLn with cutting and wounding a woman named Mary Anne Inwood, with intent to murder her. The prosecntrix, a handsome-looking woman, parts of wbose face and neck were covered with adhesive plaister, stated that she was in the employment of a tradesman named Freeman in the Kingsland-road, and some time since became acquainted with the prisoner, who had courted her ever since, and ultimately asked her to marry him, She was at first inclined to accept his offer, but from somethirg that occurred she had reason to suspect him, gave him no encounragement, and tried to keep out of his sight as much as she could. While leaving her employer's on Thursday evening, however, she found him waiting for her in the street in a verv excited manner, and he then told her enmphatically that if she did not consent to live with him she would bring the blood of both of thoet upon her own head, for that he had fully made up his mind to kill her and then destroy himself. Without giving her an opportunity of further explanation he then walked rapidly away, ahd she heard no more of him tlll the next evening, when her employer told her that the prisoner was about to leave the country and wanted to see her before he went. She therefore left the workroom and went into another, where she understood he was, and as soon as he saw her the prisoner advanced towards her, took her affectionately by the band, and told herthathe was going far away, where she wouldnot be likely to seehimn any more, and that he couldnotbear, therefore, to part'with her while upon unfriendly terms. She reciprocated the feeling, and was shaking hands with him in a very cordial manner, when he suddenly fnng his left arm round her neck, and the next moment she felt herself cut in the left side of the throat, and s%w ths bloQd trikling down over h.rclthee, A desperatestrugle ensued between them, sho striving to releae herself from hi& grasp, until her screams for assistance brought in M&r. Freeman, who seized the prisoner, saved her from further violence. Mr. Freeman stated, that while In his outting-room on tbe preceding evening the prisoner entered and asked per. mission to see the prosecutrix for a minute, s he was going a long way ofl; and would much wish to take leave of her for ever before he left. Witnems notioed that he was very much excited at the time, and although, therefore, he gave he hispernission and told the proseectrixthe prisoner was there, determinedto keep near the door, that he might be within reach, if necessary. This precaution turned out to be very advisable, for he had swarcely been at the door a miuate when he heard the sounds of a violent struggle inside, followed by ocreams of " Murder" from the prosecutrirx' and on his bursting into the room he found them struggling with each other, and the prisoner drawing bac an open knife from the direction of her throat. Witnew immediately seized him by the neck, and, wrenching the knife from his hand flung him upon the floor, and there held hirm until a consTWle could be procured to take him into custody. Cox. a constable of the N dvislou, deposed to being fetched to apprehend the prisoner, who went with him quietly to the station, and on the road there m ade the voluntary admission that he had heard theprosecutrix had altogether deelined his overtures, as she was about to be mnarred to some one elae, and that he had therefore made up his mind to murder her. When he saw the prosecutrin she was bleeding from the throat, and the blood dropped on tlhe stairs. (The witness here produced the knife, a shoemaker's cutting-knife, the point of which was broken o£] Mr. Cowrd1 the divisional surgeon, said that he was sent for to the station, where he found the prosecntrix bleeding from a wound in the left side of the neek, about an inch in length, directl7 over the jugular vein, and at the angle of the law, in the fleshyinteguments. Theknifeproduced was calculated to inflict such an injuy, and he considered that the blade must have been broken before the infliction of the blow or it must have otherwise to a certainty been fataL Tlbe 6lowr appeared to him to have glanced off. The prisoner, who was vezx despondent, declined offering any defence, and was committed till tha day week for the completion of the depositions, SoUTswAsui.-Mr. COm1B has received2Z. from "X.Y." for Mrs. Ives, the wife of Thomas Ives, a waiter, who was a few days ago committed for six months for assaulting her in a oowardly manner. The donor requested an acknow. ledgment in Die !ima. L sAIx.-Mr. George Fender, a grocer, carrying on business in Bradley-terrace, Wandsworth-road appeared before Mr. ELLioT'rtoanswertoan information lid against him by Mr. Moore, the Sapervisor of Excise for the dis. trict, for selling, contrary to law, a mixture of chicory with coffee, when pure coffee was askod and paid for. Mr. ELiroTr observed that there could be no doubt that there was a mixture of chicory in the coffee to the amount of 24 per cent., and that the defendant had thought he could evade the law by wrapping it in the paper produced. fe then convicted the defendant in a penalty of 201.

CHINA. (FROM OTM OWN CORP=PONDENT.) HONGKONG, MAY 10. The steamer Pekin, with the l0th of March saail from London, arrived on the 29th ult. The steamer Norma, with the 26th of March mail, arrived yesterday. The Pekin lDves this morning with the outward mails. The inteligence brought by the 11th of March miail of the opposition the Government met with on the China question caused great disappointment among the community her It was satisfactory to learn, however, the policy comxuenced was not likely to be influenoed essentially. The accounts we are now in possession of, that seemingly the voice of the country is in favour of an extended policy in treating with China at the present crisis, give us sanguine hope that our relations wvith this country are at last to be put on a firm ana proper footing. Since writing on the 26th ult. litteo oiia interest has ttceofroliica We have intelligence from the Canton river to the 8th inst. Several attempts had been made to blow up some of the ships. One was nearly successfu in doing miscbief A tank, supposed to have been one of the boilers of the steamer Queen, filled with gunpowder, was floated down towards the Acorn. When within about 15 yards of the vessel it exploded, but fortunately did no injury. Tenders for raising Her Majesty's ship Raleigh, it is advertised, wiU be received to the 16th inst. We fear the chances of success in raising the vessel are now small, as, besides the difficulty of the undertaldng in ordinary times, the Chinese are afraid to come forward for such employment at present. Captain Bate has surveyed the rock on which the Raleigh struck, and he states that it is not put down in either the English or French charts. Her Majesty's steamers Fury and Cruiser and gunboats Staunch and Bustard have arrived here. Her Majesty's steamer Sampson, Captain Hand, accompanied by the Camilla brig, Captain Colville, has done good service on the coast in destroying a large number of piratical junks and lor-has. The Sampson arrived here on the 28th ult., und leaves for Foochow to-day, as the rebels are in the neighbourhood of that place, and they are seriously interfering with the trade. The Comus leaves for Aimoy to relieve the Cailla, which vessel takes the Racehorse's place at :Foochow. The latter vessel goes to Singapore to relieve the Spartan. The coolie who murdered Mr. Markwick the Government auctioneer, has been tried and found 6 Guilty," and has been sentenced to be hanged. Some Chinese who were employed by the Government at Stanley were seized and put on their trial for high treason, in consequence of the discovery of some papers. One of the men was convicted, and had sentence of death recorded against him. Shanghai advices are to the 29th ult., but do not contain anything of political interest. We mentioned that a tax of $12 a-chest had been imposed by the authorities on the import of opium into Shanghai ; a similar tax has been established at Ningpo. Foocho v dates are to the 30th ult. The near approach of the rebels caused considerable uneasiness, and little or no business was doing. The merchants and wealthy people were removing their property, and a complete stoppage of trade was anticipated by many. No operations could be carried on for the next season's teas. A notice has appeared from the Consulate at Foochow, stating that a preliminary intimation had been received from the high Chinese authorities that they are desirous of raising among the foreiga merchants the amount of o00,uOO silver taels, to bear interest at 3 per cent. per mensem, for repaymentof which the duties at all the ports of foreign trade are to be made security. At Amoy on the 6th iat. all was quiet. THE STRAITS. SINGAPORE, MAY 16. You will have heard by the last mail of the disturbance created by the Chinese in this place. All things are now proceeding in their usual train, but the btorekeepers are not without fear that the recent Government regulations may be made the excuse for some further attempts at plunder. General Garratt and his staff landed from the Aden yesterday under a salute of eleven guns. They were entertained at the Governor's house. His Excellency is absent at Manilla. We have had a little dispute here between the English and American authorities. On the 25th of February last the American ship Cour de Lion, Captain Tucker, bound to China, fell in with a Dutch ship, the Henrietta Maria, in lat. 17 30, long. 110 30 E. Seeing that the ship was not under command, Captain Tucker boarded her and found that she was navigated only by the Chinese crew. Their story was that they had risen against the Dutchmen and compelled the captain to run the ship over to Cochin China, where they had allowed him and his officers to take to their boats, and were then trying to make their way to China. The American took possession of the vessel, and, after considerable difficulty, keeping sentry day and night over the Chinese, and having only five Europeans to do this duty, brought the ship to Singapore. The authorities here sent over to Batavia to give notice of the circumstance. The Yankee hoisted the American flag on board the Henrietta Maria, and the Singapore authorities sent off an armed force and hauled it down. A Dutch vessel of war now arrived and took away the ship, the Batavia authorities, however, saying that any claim for salvage would be duly decided by the Courts of Batavia. Captain Tucker put the matter into the bands of his Consul. The American sloop of war Portsmouth has come into harbour, as somne say, to " see about" this matter, but, as I believe, to take on the ratification ofEthe American treaty with Siam. It is a ridiculous mantter, but the Yankee captains are sulky on the subject. CO34MERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. CHINA MARKETS. HONGKONG, MAY 10. At Hongkong we have to report very little doing in trade.

CALCUTTA MARKET. SATURDAY, MAY 16. Since our last issue, under date the 2d inst., we have been put in possession of London advices to the 10th ult. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Ava with the mails arrived here the day before yesterday. We have no particular change to report in our produce. market, all staple articles, with one or two exceptions, continuing in limited request in conseqsuence of amall supplies coupled with extreme prices and high freights. Sugar has been in improved demand at enhanced figures. Rice has remained without any alteration. Very little has been done in saltpetre for Great Britain. A good business has been done in raw silk, but at a decline in prices. For want of supplies corahs have not been largely dealt in. Jute in ecellent request at enhauced figures, but little to bie had in the market. Linseed continues to command attention for America Scarcely any change in lac dye or shell lao. A brisk demand has prevailed for safflower, and the new crop has been taken at extreme rates. Cutch has been sold to some extent at a reduction on our last quotations. The position of our import-market has experienced little change. All descriptions of gray goods have been in fair request, while white do not seem to attract much attention. The active demand for mule twist which we reported in our last has continued unabated, and a furtber rise in value has taken place. A fair amount of business has likewise been done in coloured yen. We have not had any activity in our metal-market. The money-market has scarcely been easier during the past fortnight, though the Bank of Bengal has reduced its rate of interest and discount 1 per cent. all round, wh:ch stands now as follows :-private bills and notes, 7 per caent.; Government biUs (accepted) 5 per cent.; Mint certificates, o per cent. ; loans on deposit of Company's paper, 6 per cent.; ditto on goods, 7 per cent. Rates of Advance.-Sicca 4 per cent. and stock receipts, S8r.; Company's 4 ditto, 83r. ; Company's 5 ditto, 95r. Shares.-Since our lest report there has been no change in this market. The BondedWarehouse Association have just declared a dividend for the past half-year at the rate of 17 rupees a share. Government Securities.-Soon after the Bank of Bengal rates were lowered last week an improvement in the value of al securities took place. A large business has been done in Company's Fours at 12r. 4a., which is the rate to-day. Sicca Fours are quoted at 14r. to 14r. 4a.; Company's Fives at par. The other descriptions of paper remain nominally at our last quotations. Exchange on London.-The market for the present mail opened at 2s. lid. for first-class American and other credits, it fell subsequently for a few days to 2s. 1Id., batis again u to 2s. 1 Ad. for Barings and other first-clas-m papers, and2s. lid. for credits in less favour. On China transactions to the ex tent of about I) laos at 227r., and bils in fair demand. On Mauritius 60 days' sight bhls are quoted at 53c. Freights.-Our rates for Great Britain, since our Iast report, have continued unaltered, present quotations being still 41. 15s. for London, and 41. 7s. 6d. for Liverpool, all round; but the scarcity of produce has curtailed business. Some large engagements of tonnage have taken place for the West Indies, Hamburg, Australia, and other ports. The rates to the Mauritius suddenly declined from 2r. 2a. to Ir. ga. a-bag, in consequence of five large vessels, which were taken up within a few days for the conveyance of emigrants to the Mauritius, requiring dead -weight to the extent of about 60,000 bags; but we have since had a reaction, and our closing rate is lr. 12a. a-bag. For China, also, since the arrival of the steamers Fiery Cross and Lightning, lower rates were accepted, the bulk of the engagements, to the extent of about 100,000 bags of rice, having been at $1 a-bag, though $1 10c. has latterly bean paid. We have again to report a scarcity of tonnage in our port, and a want of vessels of moderate sizes, which are always preferred to ships of large carrying capacities. As yet supphles of produce have come down very sparingly, in consequence of the rivers not having risen sufficiently; but, as in a month hence our stocks wil be considerably increased,a larger demand for tonnage is expected. It is however, dificult to say whether our present rates will be further enhanced, ass good number of vessels might visit our port from different quarters seeking employment, and induced by prospects of remunerative freights. TEE BOMBAY MARKET FROM THE 11TR TO THE 26TH OF MAY. The English mail from London of the 26th of April, per Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Bombay, reached Bombay on the afternoon of the 22d inst. Our money-market during the past fortnight has, contrary to expectation, become very much tighter, and the banks in consequence have raised their rat-es of interest 3 par cent. al roumd, and present rates of interest now range from 8 to 10 per cent.; but we are of opinion that the present pressure will be of short duration, as the public do not seem inclined to submit to these high rates. A drain on the banks for speculation in opium and in the new 5 per cent, loan is said to be the cause of the present tightness in our market. G-overnment and other securities remain at about former quotations. IMPOPRS. Cotton Piece Goods.-The business transacted during the fortnight has been very limited, andthe market wears a dull appearance, inquiry for goods being moderate. Gray shirtings have undergone a decline iu value since last reported. T-cloths and cambrics continue scarce. Madapollams are inquired for, as also low jaconnots. Yarns.-This article has slightly revived in inquiry, and transactions in it have been made to a fair extent, in several instances showing an advance in the prices. Metals have manifested a decline in the rates. EXPORTS. Cotton Wool.-The market is easy since the arrival of the last mail, which brought accounts of low rates in Eng- 0ad.Ou pesn quotations are-Broach and Surat, 135- 37r.

Opium.-The market is dull, and drug has declined in value to l,100r. for both Indore and Mundlesir. TONNAGE. Freights have declined, and exhibit a downwardl tendency, owing to abundance of tonnage. Our present rates are 21. 2s. 6d. to 21. 5s. for Liverpool and London. Exchange has ruled steady at 2s. 1 13-16d. for China drawn bills, andat 2s. lid. to 2. 2d. for local bills.

LIVERPOOL, June 27.-The Royal mail steamship Arabia sailed to- day for New York with 96 passengers, the mails, and a large cargo. THE SPECIE EXPORT FROM AXMEPIC,J.-The export of over 2,250,000 of specie, on Wednesday in the Arabia, followed, as it is likely to be, by an export of 1,000,000 on Satarday, is an event of too much importance to pass without something more than mere mention. The total receipts of gold from California for the incomplete fiscal year of 1856-57 faU short of those of the corresponding portion of the fiscal year 1855-56 by nearly $4.000,000, while the total shipments of gold from this port for the samne period exceed the shipments dturing the corresponding period in 18.55.56 by over $20,000,000. Thus the 11 months show a difference against us as compared with the 11 months of 185--56, equal to $24 000,000. Assuming that the shipments during the present month will continue on the present scale, we shall have gent abroad to Europe during the fiscal year ;8.657 no less a sum tban S48.000,000 in gold frot thisport alone -fully 10. 000 000 to 12,000,000 mnore t-hani the total receipt from California. That this steady drain of specie is due to the over importations of the dry goods men and dealers in luxuiles is obvions. The importations this fiscal year at this port are $25,000,000 in rxcess of those last year, while the exports show only a trifling inicrease of somo $4 000,000. The fact js, last year everybodv expected a crisis, and was cautious; this year people seem to have made up their nminds that aU is serene, atfd the orders for foreign goods, in defiance of hard times in the Wwst and extraordinary specie shipments from this port, are exorbitantly large. The new tariff witl doubtless tend to increase them and favonr the exI ansion of moteantile credit. It is a singular good fortune for us that concurrently with these events the decline in railway property disengages capital enough to enable merrhants to carry on the husiness of the country without inconvenience. Were there as much speculatiosn as usual in railways, money would now he v.ry close indeed, and failares would be common.-A5rese York Hreald.

TMI RRoY BRITisH BANK.-The names of the nine persons who have been arrested, or who have surrendered and given bail, are-Mr. Humphrey Brown, Mr. Esdaile, Mr. Stapleton, X1:P., Mr. Alderman Kennedy, Mr. M'JLeod, Mlr. . VaLant, Mr. L. Valiant, Mr. Owen, and Mr. Cameron. Mr. Cochrane is the only grson who has not yet responded to the summons of Lrd Chief Justice Campbell. Two only of these persons remain in custody; they are Mr. Humphrey Brown and Mir. Cameron, neither of whom has yet completed the req huire ail. The arrest of Mr. Cameron wiUl give a deathblow to the notion that any person may, by fleeing to the continent, safely defy the pursuit of the myrmidonsof the British law. Defaulters and others maynow' banish from their minds the pleasing delusion that France or Switzerland will afford them a sanctuary. The Govern. ments of both these countries have in the case of Mr., Cameron, and one or two of the directors, declared by their acts that they would not permit their country to be made the hiding-place of British delinquents. Immediately upon the issue of the warrant on the 5th of June Mr. Simpson, one of the assistants of Inspector Field, started to Paris, for the purpose of arresting Mr. Cameron, and one or two other persons, who were known to be then residing in the French capitaL Mr. Cameron wag in Paris when the officer arrived, but by some means he obtainedinformationthat hewas "wanted," and immediately started to Lausanne, in Switzerland. On Simpson placing himself in communication with the French police he ascertained that the bird had flown, and by directions from the Prefecture a telegraphic despatch was sent to the police authorities at Lausanne, giving a personal description of Cameron, and a request that he should be arrested. On his arrival at Lausanne the fugitive was at once taken by the Swiss police and placed in confinement. He was shortly after liberated, as there were not sufficient grounds alleged for his detention, but placed under strict 8u7seiance. A short time after his liberation two of the French gendarmerie presented themselves at the bureau of police in Switzeiland, stating the object of their mission, that of securing Cameron. The Swiss police, accordingly, again arrested him, and conducted him to the frontier of Switzerland, where he was handed to the French officers, who accompanied the fugitive to Paris. Cameron's son arrived in Paris shortly after his father had left, and in a few minutes after leaving the station he fonnd himself in custody of the French police, who detained him, notwithstandiDg his appeal, as a British subiect, to Lord Cowley, in order to prevent his communicating in any way with his father. Immediately upon learning that Cameron was in the custody of the police the son was liberated, no doubt with as many bows and apologies as a first-class se-ryest de v-ille of Paris can call to his command. On arriving in Paris notice was sent to Simpson, the English officer, to hold himself in readiness to meet some representatives of the French police at Boulogne, who would have under their charge a certain English subject, to wit, the missing Mr. Cameron. By the command of Lord Cowley the said British subject was conveyed to Boulogne, and then and there handed over on the English steam-packet to Simpson, who held the British warrantforhis apprehension. This "hunting down" system, as it is called, is a very efficient one, and acts perfectly independent of any extradition treaty between any two countries. Let the Pzefecture of Police be once satisfied that there exists reasonable ground for the apprehension of any person, and instantly the whole machinery of the French police is set in motion, not to surrender the offending party, in the strict sense of the term, but rather to remove him from the French soil as some had or improper character. The proceeding is a very simple one. "'Your name is Mr. So-and-so" "You were connected with such or such a firm or company VI and the answer in the affirmative is followed by the polite request that the person addressed should accompany his interrogator to the frontiers of the country, or some other place which may be named. It is useless in France to plead other engagements, or to decline to accept such an invitation from one of the members of the gendarmerie. When Mr. Cameron was in custody he said he would not have returned to Paris had he not heard that his eon was in custody, but wo'lId still bave retmaine..I in Switzerland. He also complained bitterly of the conduct of some members of the board of directors. It appears t.- be the confident opinion of the late manager that the business of the bank might have been carried on successfully, and that in a very short time it wonld have got over all its difflculties. Assistance to a large amount, he says, might have been obtained from the Bank of England, had he remained connected with the bank; but the conduct of the directors after he left was not such ns to inspire the necessary confidence to obtain funds in the event of a run upon the establishment. Between some members of the board and their manager great differences of opinion existed as to the proprietyof alyingthemselves in any way with the Newcastle Bank. Cameron was opposed to such an alliance, and hence, as he alleges, arose the desire to drive him away from his post as manager. On arriving in London Mr. Cameron was accompanied by Simpson to the Cathedral Coffee-house in St. Paul's Churchyard, and on the following day was takea before Mr. Justice Erle at chambers, but, not bheing pro pared with the required bail, which was fixed at 12.0001. for himself, and two sureties of 6.0001. each, and the officer in whose custody he was declining any further responsibility of his safe keeping, he was handed over to one of the tipstaffs of the court, who conveyed him to the Queen's Bench prison. The personal appearance of Mr. Cameron has greatly changed since his late residence on the continent; he has now a moustache and long white beard, which wsould preven his most intimate friends from recognizing him except npa a cose scrutiny. 'he bail required id much larger tban in any of the other cases, and Mr. Cameron expectedthatLrd Stewart and Sir James Matheson. who were the bail for h;s son-in-law, Mr. M'Leod, would have satisfied the requirements in his own case also. Various speculations have been indulged in a, to the cause of the Governreent ofrwring & reward of 2001, for the apprehpnsion of Mr. Hainphrey Brown exclusively, and at their not evincing a similar regard for the persons of the other parties for whom th3 wvarrants had been issued. The reason for this aprIareas favouritism was owing entirely to the conduct of Mr. Brown himself. Itappearedthat a commnunication was made to Mr. Brown to the effect that a prosecution was intended on the part of the Government, and requesting him to surrender by a time specified. This he consented to do, bat faWling to keep his promise, having left his residence, and his place ofabode not. being. noen a rpwar,i was at -ns.e offered for his apprehension on the part of the Government. -Mesfrer.

DISTRIBUTIONOF CTHE V ICTORIA CROSS TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI&ES. Sir,-The adventures of an AP. on the above occasion may not be unacceptable to some of your readers, nor void of interest to Sir Benjamin Hall. Provided with a red ticket, I reached the park gates a little before Her Majesty's arrivaL I applied to two policemen to inform me how I was to reach the scaffolding with the red flag, to whioe my red ticket gave me the right of admission. Simultaneously they imparted to me instructions diametricaUy con. trary the one to the other. I hastily took my choice, and hurrying on, half roasted by the sun, presently discovered that I was decidedly on the wrong side of the road along which the Royal corMge was at that moment Proceeding, and was, in fact, cut off from the ecaffolding altogether. I humbly craved a policeman's advice. He shook his head with an air of gloomy austerity, and informed me that he knew nothing whatever of the matter. In the hopes of catching at least a distant view of the scaffolding I nowran across the parkat the peril of precipitating myself headforemost into the portable groves of gingerbeer and porter bottles which studded the plain, and endeavoured to get to the opposite side of the parade ground. Policemen stopped me. I implored them to tell me what to do. Con. tradictory instructions again assailed me. Finally I was directed to make for a white flag, where I should be permitted to cross the road. I saw no white flag, but reached, after great jostling and struggling, a point where a passage was permitted. I pressed forward, and at length, to my great relief, discovered a scaffolding. But it had a white flag instead of a red one waving over it, and I had another pilgrimage to perform before the red flag greeted my eyes. I ascended the stairs and found a crowd of ladies and gentlemen apparently en. gaged in the pleasing occupation of preventing each other from seeing any portion of the ceremony enacting in the plain below. Parasols gracefully hovered ia front of the gentlemen's ontstretched faces, while the gentlemen's hats blocked up the line of vision to the ladies who were so unfortunate as to stand behind them. An officer in a huge bearksin cap was agreeably conspicuous in this respect but the ladies whom he shut out from the spectacle consoled themselves by reflecting upon the intense heat his headdress inflicted on him. Half a dozen men were wedged into the entrance a-top of the stairs, and would not go in themselves nor suffer others to pass. Waiving, therefore, may Parliamentary dignity, I clambered to the top of the railing at the back of the scaffolding, aud there, sitting astride in an attitude the reverse of Ixurious, ob. tamed a pretty good view of al the proceedings except the distribution of the cross. It was Hamlet with the part of Hamlet omitted. If the central compartment of the scaffolding, allotted to Royalty and the Diplomatic corps, had been on the other side of the parade ground opposite the spectators, aU would have seen the ceremony. As It was, only the rninutest fraction of the company saw Her Majesty deliver the Victoria Cross. Mounted as I was, at some personal inconvenience, on the top of the railing, and overlooking the bulk of spectators, I only caught a glimpse of a few of the recipients of the cross standing in single file, like a row of recruits about to commence the goose-step. As for her gracious Majesty, I am told she was present on the occasion, but of my own knowledge I can say nothing A word about the construction of the scaffolding. It was on an inclined plane-an abruptly inclined plane-which experienced persons will probably bear me out in saying is very trying to stand upon for any length of time. In fact, it anfords a species of slow torture of a mild character not unworthy the attention of King Bombs or any other patrons of the art stil extant. It seems incredible, but my humble opinion is that for all useful purposes two or three rows of benches carried entirely round the parade ground would have been far more comfortable, far more advantageous for viewing the spectacle, and I should con. ceive far more economical than the awkward structure standing upon which for some hours last Fridav morning 7,000 ladies and gentlemen did tot see the distribution of the V7ictoria cross by her gracious hlaiestv. Youzs obediutly, - AL P. TO TEE EDITOR OF T1E TIME%. Sir,-In the report of the "Distririntion of the Victoria Cross" fot valour, in The Times of this morning, you say, eescribing the recipients, "only one was maimed-Lieu. tenant John Knox-who, after greatly distinguishing himself in the Eusileer Guards, lost his arm in the attack on the Redan." I beg to inform you of my claims to the honour of having been maimed in the service of my Queen. and country; and, as publicity was the spirit of the ceremony yesterday, I trust I may ask yoo to make them known. They are as fellows:-Oa The 8th of September, 18355, I was struck inside the Redan on the right upper lip by a muisket ball, which carried bway all the upper teeth except one, with their sockets, the Ioof of the mouth, fractured the lowerj. w, and remained in *he muscles of tho neck until 10 weeks aftorwards, when it was cut out above the collarbonAe. I have since been compelled, from the effects of the wound, to lose five teeth from the lower jaw, and to undergo Zn operation for the purpose of removing injured bone. I am. Sir.

In April last the Oxonians obtained the " matery o'er the flood" by defeating the Cantab.L The ease with which that victory was achieved either showed that the Oxfordwas an exceedingly good crew, or the Cantabs a very indifferentone. The tyle of the Oxford menonth&t occasion was matchless, and bad there been necesitzthey could have done much mnore. The Cambridge vacathon commenidng three weeks earlier thanthe Oxford, there was no proba.- bility of their keeping a crew togethereven had they enter. ined any notion of engaging again with the sister Uni. versity so soon after the previous race. Fresh opponents were, however, feuna for the Oxonians, and they were doomed to a surrender of their laurels, but not witbout a rae that will long live in the memory of the oldest aquatic man. *Tho Grand Challenge Cup at this, essentially a gentlemans, regatta, affordfa the newly formed LondonClub an opportunity whicb, from the shortness of their exiatence, they had not pireviously possessed, of proving their strength. 'he club is most unquestionably composed of, with the exception of the eanders, all the rowing men in the metropolis who oc6upL the position of gentlemen, and in the crew selected for ths contest were, as it will be seen, Messrs. HE Playford and J. Paine, former holders of the silver sculls, the symbol of amateur championship of the Thames, and Mr. Casamajor, the present holder of the proud distinction. The London Rowing Club came to the scene of action on Monday, in order to have an opcortunity of well training over the course. The Oxonians left their seat of learning directly after the Commemoration, and had a tun over the Henley water. Their style was as perfect as before, and maintained in the hottest part of one of the most desperate races ever rowed. They rowed so well that independent lookers-on, judging from trainin' "spins," backed them at 6and7to4, and although the London men were rowing well and expressed every confidence. The race was as usual from the island to the bridge, the London men having the best station. The start was very beautiful, and was slightly taken by the Londoners, who came in first by nearly half a clearlength. Both crews were very loudly cheered, and well deserved it.
