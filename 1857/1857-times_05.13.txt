THE PUB]LiC OFflCE TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIlES. Sir,-In my letter on the public offices in 2%e Times of to.day the following sentence has been obscured by a mistaken repetition of the word " national".- " If they were brought Into one point of view with other national monuments, and were combined with 'naturalX p(ot 'national') objects of great beauty, &c." It probably had never occurred to your compositor that nature as well as art might contribute to the embellishment of London. Nevertheless, a stately river, with its ever varing lights and haadows and its moving panorama, is a natural object of great beauty, which is sean with peculiar advantage in connexion with handsome pablic buildings. At Greenwich Hospital we have a glimpse of what m3 be accomplished in this way; but in London the picturesqne resources of our noble river have been entirely neglected. What would our neighbours give for the privilege of substitutig the lordly expanse of the Thames for the narro w sunken Seine at tho Place dce la Concordo ? The combin. tion of trees with public buildings is better understood. Those who hove seen Salisbury Cathedral will at once feel that the already ample space in the angle between theAbbey and the Houses of Parliament might, by a slight exercicg of the taste which is doing so much for our parks, be mado to add to the effect of the adjoining buildings; and by the removal of a single house the Privy-gardens, which still in great part exist, and the view of the Thames might bo thrown open to the enjoyment of the public. Every plan for the improvement of Westminster of course supposes the substipution of stone cpays and public walks for the abominable mud banks -which disfigure our beautiful river, and convert into a laboratory of miasma and murky fog wrhat nature intended to be a mneans of healthful *entilation; but this part of the subject is connected with questions of main sewers and marginal railways which wrould require a separateo isuisition._T have 2l. CrVIS B ETANNICUS. London, May 12. - -
Tns PUBLIC OffFrOES.-The commissioners appointed to adjudicate on the architectural designs and plans or the construction of the new Foreign-office aud the War Department and to award the prizes, will enter upon tho occpion of the offices allotted to thera to-morrow. Thmes ofiices are not situated in any of the public buildings, but have been spocially engaged for the purpose. In this plan the Chief Uoml=isjoner has but followed out the course which he had laid down from the first There has at least been nothing exclusive about that course. Two now public offices were absolutely requisite. The state of the Dresent Foreign.offieein Downing-stroet has long been a matter of notorety; no pnvate gentleman would have tolerated it in his own estatbishment. The War Department is new in itself, and is without a permanent home. The public office however, are many of thetn inconveniently lodged, and not less Inconveniently mcattered; And in constructing the two new offices it was desirable to hear in mind the probability that other *ffce would be brought to the same spot. In issuing the specifications inviting plans and elevations for the two newv offices, therefore, the Chief Commissioner invited also a plan for the concentration of all the public offices, and that was the only tangible guarantee that the architects would really make the designs for the two offices available, or adaptable, prospectively, as parts of a larger whole. Such an alteration would necessarily involve the entire sof the ground occpied by official Westminster, and t iOdistrbution of the approaches; and hence the architects were permitted to extend their plans beyond the ground to be occupied by the buildings-a permission of which tbey have universaly availed themselves. The design which are bxibited in Westrainster-hall poses a value beyond the mere furnishingof dedgns for the buildings immediately required. The perfect openness of the invitation issued was a guarantee against favouxitism. The immense amount of labour and expense bestowed on the designs showed that the profession, abroad as well as in this country, appreciated the opportunity. We have in the collection some approximation to an estimate of what the profession at large can do forus in the need-and some evidence, perhaps, as to its shortDomings. And this colloection is before the public, -which has the opportunity of ju2dging for itself as to the fairness of the whole proceeudngs and of the ultimate decision. Four days in the week are given to the public ; two days are reserved for the judges. The names of the 3udges are before the public. They are, without exception, persons of high standing, most of them are of great experience in public business, the others are men of kniown professional skill. They wil exercige their survey without the slightest interference from the Government or fromthe Board of Public Works; and this principle of non-intervention is carried to the extent of placing them in offices of their own. The labour will be considerable, and it will need time. Of course, it will begin-as in such cases it usually does-by large reductions in the number of designs to be compared; then further reductions, until attention shall be concentrated on the comparatively few of the best. Even then the labour will be considerable. It is, however, far from impossible that valuable suggestions will accrue -vothewoeelfsur a Xro from a survey ftewofedo th.60 designs; so that the report of the gentlemen commissioned to adjudicate the prizes will substsantially brin3g together a repo:rt of the architectural profession on the more immediate requiirements for the publi offices, on their future colocation, and on the prospoctive improvement of that part of Westminster.- THE BimT BIT.-On Friday morning, shortly before 7 o'clock, an elderly bachelor-looking gentleman entered the booking-office at the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Station, for the purpose of procuring a ticket. The clerk saw him, on entering, gtoop and lift somethain from the ground, and. when he ased his ticet he ob6erved several banknotes in his hind. After fumbling with the rings of his puse a little, hoe huriedly handed the clerk the payment, beig evidently eager to get out of the way. The clerk, supposing his customer haadfound the money whici he saw, put the question to him, when the latter sratiei retorted, telling him "Ito mindl his own business," and, hastily putting the ticket into an outside pocket, 'walked a , that m enUtema oso freviouns t this another gentleman had observed by tho clerk to enter the offieo n a great hur,as if thinking hmself late for the train, and also boughda ticket for Edinburgh, hut the clerk took no partclrnotice of the circumstance. When the 5 p.m. train froneyfrm Edinbuarrived in Glagow the bachelor-looktg traveler. a Nwentered the booking-offie, andI complained to the cler that he had gone away in the morning without etting his tiket, and had consequently been obliged to p, y his fare a second time at Bdinburgh. The clerk imimediately recognized him as the person he suspected in the mornig of having found the money, and sad he had given the ticket to him, as he always gave the ticket before lifting the money, and accordingly he refused to return the fare. In the midst of the altercation the gentleman whom the clerk noticed in the morning hurrying through the office stepped in, and stated that he had lost four iL-notes in the morning, which he thought he miust have droppe while purchasing his ticket, and he as'ked the clerk whether he knew anything of them, "1Yes,"1 replied the clerk, who felt he spoke the truth, IIt'hat gentleman has found them," pointing to the customer with whom he ha been wrangling. The latter looked confused, and instantly, yet reluctantly, drew the money from his poc'ket and handled it to the riIhtfal *owner. "Now," said the clerk, "I think I can telyont where to find your ticket-lookc in the outside pocket of your coat." The covetous traveller, patting his and into the pocket indicated, drew forth the misigtce,ad conmenoodiiken nd hagined, quickly left the office, after being admonished that ahe ad by his over-greed lost both hisfare and the money he hAd wished to appropriate.- afasym 404?
THE PVBLIC HIAL2'H. (From the WecklyB eturoftib B rGener&) The number of deaths regitered in London in the week that endod on Satmrday is 1,064, and exhibits s small in crease on that of the provious week, which wa 1,038. In the ten years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the veeks corresponding with last weekws 1,00. But, as the deaths of last week occurred in an increased population, the average, with x vl.ew to comparison, must be raied pro. portionally to the increase, in which case it will beoome 1,144. Hence it appears that tho deathsnow returned were less by 80 than the number that would have occurred under the average rato of mortality. The number of births recorded Ist week is 1,816, and shows an exoess of 782 on the deaths recorded in the same period. The retuns now contain indications of the effect of the cold north-east wind that has blown uninterruptedly for come time. During 18 days from the 22di ult, to the 9th inst., both days included, the mean daily temperature of the air has been constantly below the average, and the extent of depression has been generally 7 deg. or 8 deg., and on four nights last week the theemomneter fell to 32. deg., or below that point The resolt of- this -continned coldness is seen in the deathX referred to diseases of the respiratory organs, which a I previously decreased, but which roe lat week from 177 to 208, the speca disease under which this increase is found being bronchitis, which rose from 84 to 116. The deaths due to pneumenia..(or inflammation of the lungs) remained nearly the same, having been in the two weeks 74 and7O. Iast week bronchitis and pneumonia were fatal to the same number of young persons-viz, 52; but among persons of mature age the two diseass were fatal in very different pro. portions, for 64 persona aged 2) years and upwards diea of bronchitis, and 18 of pneumonia. Whoopingeough declined last week to 44,-a lower number than hs been o¶taiied for a long period. There were 2 deaths from smallpox. Of 32 from measles .5 occurred in the sub-dis, trict of Bethnal-green, ana 8 in that of Limehouse. There appears to have been n Tiolent outbrk of reealoes in thq workhouse aituated in tho latter sub-district, as all the 8 deaths occurred in that institution, and nearly allof them within a few days. * Sevennonogeniansudiedinthe week; the twooldeet dwer women, aged 93 years, one of whom died inl Brompton, tho other in the Pancras Woikhouse. Last week the birts of 924 boys and 922 girl-in anl 1,8i4 children-were registered in London. In the ton corre. sponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 3,550. At the Royal Observatory, Green'wicl, the mean height of.tho barometer in tho week wAS 29'962 in. The mean daily reading was above 30in. on five days; and the highest reading in the week was 3012in. on Tuesday. The mean temperature of the week was 44-8 deg.; which is 6-7 deg. below the averago of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The lowest temperature occmrred on Monday, &id wss 315 deg,; the highest on Saturday, and was 65-3 deg. . The rango of tho 'week was 33 8 deg. The men derw point temperattre was 38&2 deg., and the difference between this and the mean air temperature was 6-6 deg. The wind blew almost invably from the northeast. There was scarcely any rain. The first five days were very cold.

Sir,-Exception having been taken by "Another Adn nistrative Reformer," in your paper of the 7th inst., at the remarks in my letter respecting the official " Statistical Abstracts, 1842 to 1856," not giving the public aU the information they are entitled to have in such publications of the public revenues and expenditure, I have to request he will inform you, pro bono puico,-bst, which ot the table' in those abstracts eontains the gross revenues, with the balances thereto belonging, for the year 1851; 2-ly, whether 6,915,626'. is not stated, in figures, as the "total expendituro for civil list and civil charges of all kinds" in 1851; 3dly, whether 6,915,6261. only was the gross amount of all the civil eharges; and, lwtly, whether the tqtal or gross amount taken out of thepublic rey6nues for the civil list and civil charges of al kinds was not quito ll,41Z010t-i. e., 4,496,3841. more than is specified in any column of those statistical abstracts.

The necessity of bouflce accounts of the financiaaffairs of even such minor publie interests as joint-stock companies, &a., you have shown conclusively.

The items in the financo accounts aro at present so twisted about, and scattered over different parts of these publica. tions, that it would appear as if months had been occupied in the process of mystification. There is no justification for such a waste of either the public time or the public money. The following comaparative analysis of the several accounts of the Public Revenues, &a., from the returns ordered by and made to the House of Commons will, I believe, as statements in goss, be perfectly inteUigible to the public, and I submit it for your consideration and oDinion *_ This letter is now suffiiexstly lengtby, but I shoula like to be informed by '"Another Administrative Reformere wby the contrariety of 1,266,083=.

Sir IL RAwLaxsox addressed the meeting by observg that he held in his hand Ereporto n Mohmmera andSh el Arab which he had prepared for the information of the Government about 15 yeams. ago, when the dominoh of those pluacs was contested between the Pers oanu d the Turks, and when th e two Powers had requested the arbtration of thoEnglishand Rudman sfovrnmedts forf 1,OOD ment of the matters in disputeo Bat, as the dociumet to whieh he alluded treated almost exclusively of dry gogra cphcal details, he thought the meetig 'would pr efr hearng a statement of the history and acto al postion of Mohara-sx to having infjiited on them a dry list of geographical namesu.

The expedition hiaving left usto foro the 19th of March was notable to attck Mohamanerab till the 26th-being apwarcl of a woeek The question was constantly asked o-Where is Mohammerah; is it in rersiasoris it in Turk "i The whole country from Ararat to the Persian Glf ia pen scientificaly surveyoda by the English and Russia Commissioners for a distanTe of 1,00( milesnan the phyesilorgeographical question atisueiti ee Persia and Tobrkey was whether Mahammrnh wa- nthe EupIrat oro sthole aron. Itnwasaresod that the country witereId byhe reainu ates belonged to Taebey andmthe countr7wateraoby. te Karoon belonged to Persia but the questiono was, as he had just statedi whethec Mohammerah was on the one river or on the other. It was finally decided that Mohammerah shoul be oonsidered am belonging to Pers, hut there ws rean to beieve that that was contrary to geographical accuracy. He kin. uplf was of lopion that, the plaeo was situatoed on the Euphrates, and, it so, it belonged to Turke. Sir H. Raw. linton thenred some hotesontheh ioaryo M ohammerah. 'It hadi, he had already stated, been ruled that Mohammerah was Persian, and the Persians had occupied the place fOr a certain period, but the Turkish Government was never satisfied with that adjudication, and within the last six weeksa when it was known that an expedition had gone forth with the oP tentioix of attacking rohammera, the, Turish Government,entered aplrotest agaiusth i Thaydibe not onsider that they ha lost their ter betoral elsm toat plc.Si Henry then referred to the history of Mohamer fr6u the earliest times. It was not generally known that Mohiammnerahi was formerly a, city oa a very famous Greek kIngdom, and although rtmi ih not have beern the capital, it formed peart of t kziagdom of Xsraknis and Messinvu It waso a city out geat importance, anbo re were ere extant con ins hle holed from its iint. The ground upon which tho cityo stoodwas formed from alltuvialdeposits. The present forta easa quadrangl enclosure of aboute, yards by300pyardse and was entirely destitute of artiery. The town hdi ton atural pdvantages overB ssorar to hfad triven solely fror the uncertainty of ita dependence, whether on Persia toro Turkey, and its conseuentfreedom. from a tariff. The objectb of General Sir James Outram in removing from Bushlrq to, tohammerah was to obtain a position for Carryn on the war. It was absolutely necessary that hEe should secre a strategical basis urom which he might advance, into the country. Had he remainedl at Bushie it would have been -amiere idle demonstration. He had no reason to sapos that a trenty of peace would be concluded at Paris; but obj therefore was to carry on the war with activity and violr, and the basisfor his operationscould only be obtaino4 at Mobaminerah. No doubt he believed that by g a ,nn position uponthe taroonhe would have maade an amprsson upon'the mersdaes which would havehroughttherato reas and had the war continuedlhe would have gone further i)to the country. This wm, however, now a matteIr of specula. tion which bewouldnotiuvestigate. Hlis own opinionwas that, the indertaking would have been one of difficulty, but in Oriental countries the peopletwere found to succmb before there was any real necessity. It was not absolutely impossible to enter Paersi from Mohanmmerab. There were several routes by which it might be wone, though he aamlttea tIdat they were extremely difficult routes. If the war ha been protracted Gteneral Ontram woald have been obligedato ao highet up the river, where the climate waxonmp . tirely gooa; and, as the troops would have toremain fcin persia during the summer, for, the treaty of peace could niob be ratifiod before June, and t'he evacolaion of the country could not be before September, the worst month in ihe whole year, he hoped GenieralOtitram wouldtake his trop higherup on theKaroon, the advantage bing thatg although91 he would have a hot climate, the air was pure and clear, and by maiEng huts and surrunding them by camelthorn the temperature would be redu6ea, to a bearable point.1V~ith regard to food, atthe present tiine 'the 'whole country was a mass of the most luxuriant vegetation.. There was -no country richer than what was calld the Dturah, above Shuster.

(Cheers.) The CaAisnmw, in moving avote of thanks to Sir H. Eawlinson, congratulated the society that it possessed a member who was so competent to illustrate the subject- on which he addressed them by his own prsonal exprience. M1r. CRuvwruitu asked Sir H.

'THE A2I ICANS AND THE WAR WITHE COHIA. A war with the Chinese differs from every other war in the manner of. waging it. At our latest accounts foreigners were undisturbed at Shanghai, and the resident Mandarins felt, or appeared to feel, no particular resentment for tho bombardment of Canton. M. Hue assures us thait the people of tho interior provinces, whose knowledge of navigation is confined to a trip on the canal or a short voyage on the Blne or Yellow rivers, will hardly admit consanguinity with the people of the sea coast, whose feelingsthey do not share, and whose mode of living they hardly understand. Now, in warring with a people thus essentily divided,and under the control of an. authority too weak to coerce enlistment or even resistance to ar invader, a general will obviously pursnue a policy different from that whvch he would adopt in prosecuting hostilities against a Power like the United States or England. He will content himself with inflicting injury on those portions of the people whose positive hostility he has made sure of, wad will do his baO, to conciliate the rest. This may be assumed to be tho course pro ected by the commander-in-chief of thoguanboat flotilla. There are two great rivers in China, the one 2,000 the other 2,900 miles long, with ' 1 cotfluents scarcely inferior in length. Of these ths I one, the Roang-Io, a mighty river which over- flows. its banks every four or five years, and submerges hundreds of persons and millions of property, may be naviable for boats of light draught for 1.200 miles of its length, exclusive oflakesand tributaries The other, the Yang4teoKiang, is even more magnificent. Por 200 miles ships of the line can sail up it, for 2.000 it is covered with knks, trade and pleasure -boats. -It has been estimated that between it and. its tributaries light vessels could find over 12,000 miles of inland navigation. Besides theie, there is the great canal, which runs at right angles to the rivers, and bears upon its bosom a fleet of eailing craft larger than the whole tonnage of thle United States. This wonderful network of internal waters is the destination of the British gunboats. Their light draught willenablethem to creep up the river and lakes without obstacle, and we apprehend, when they get out of the provinces of Juan-tsung and one or two others on the seaboard, they wll meet with no obstacle. They are likely, on the contrary to experience kindness, goodwill, and a villingness to taado among the inhabitants; for such was the face they showed to M. Hue. Having ascended these rivers to the great centres of trade and population, it may be expected that the gunboats wil proceed in a business-liko manner to establish forts for the purpose of a permanent trade. The EDglish have invariably pursued this course in Asia; even where they have relinquished conquered territory, as in the Gulf of Persia, they have retained prounud ftor a fort and residence, togethor with a perpetual right of trade on their own terms. We prestme that've alhxhear of English forts bein planted at the head-waters of .the Rong-ho, Yasg-tse-kmang, and their chief tributaries, as well as at convenient distancos throughout their na, .ble length. It may be asumed that a trade will istantT bo established as well in opium as in the other commodities which the East India tompany ha to interhaige wth China. Whilo we have no gunboats tozsendtoCi and propose to send none, we trust that Yr. eed will net le sight of the necessity of obtining, on fair a shae of the trade to be secured to the maritime naios. a peDSe to be borne will probably fall on the Chinesee* but should a payment of mnoney be necessary to secure our ticipation mn a foture free trade between China and :Franeisco o,ur surpls could not be better i- Aate a.y [dvertisementpTo al Freomasons.-The " Era" ' inagoe5e.andtprotIng ljaqrw4aLOaUaMf me xt aincat Interestirg Gratis Bupplenmeet willbe uneseDW,aleji D s . & U w ' s e e t n .

PYALIENTARY INTELLIGENCE ! HOUSE OF LORDS, TuFSDAY, WAY 12, The LoBD CSIANuCLLon took his seat on the woolsaco! at {i o'clooFr ST. JAMES'S PARK. The Earl of DIAL IESBURY gavo notice that on Friday next ko should call the attention of the Government to tho works now being carried on in St. Jamees' Park. CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH pre-nted a petition from the civil servants employed in the Customs' departrment at Glocester in favour of an alteration and amend. mnent of the Superannuation Act. The comnplaint of the petitionerst observed the noble earl, was that they paid great deal into the superannuation fund and received little from it, and their prayer was that they should #et more and pay nothing. Thbeir lordsbips had really nothing Whateve r to do with the subject. Thty had no pow°er to deal with money matters, and could not m3ae any of the alterations n theSupmerannuation Act rhich the petitioner sugested. He should look- with great interest to the condct orf the House of Commons on thi= aubject, because it would be a test of the sincerity of their desire to establishi economy in the administration of piublio affairs He had no doubt that the report of the gent emen who had been appointed to investigato the matter would suggest an improved system for the Lutur; he had no doubt that the Government woutd pr3pore some measure generally in accordance with the xecommendations of that report; but he had as little doubt that that measure would be defeated in the House of Corn. !mons, becausehis impression was that canvassing and jobbing woudn be infinittly more powerful than Her Mjesty's Dffnisters upon this subject. Petitions to the same effect were presented bv the Marquis of BRE&nAi.sJs.N, the Earl of EGLINoTOr, and other noble lords. THE LAW OF LIBEL. On the motion of Lord CAMIPBELL, two petitions for an leration of the lavr ot libel as regards the reports of wbhlis meetings were referred to the select committee re.appnointed to consider {hat subject. THE DIVORCE BILL. The Bishop of OXFORD appealed to the Lord Chancollor on behal ef his most rev. and right rev. brethren to give a longer time for the consideration of the Divorce BiL The Bill would not be in the hands of their lordships untit Wed3esd3y, and bo thought it exceedingly undesirable to proceed wdth such a degree of haste in so very important a eatter n to take the second reading on the following Tudesday. The LORD CEHANCELLOR said, the subject was discussed at the greatest possible length last year, and was again discussed in the short session this year. The alterations in the Bil, though very important, were very slight, and it was unreasonable to ask 'or further time when the whole session m ight be lo3t by the Bill not going down early enough to the other House. The right rev. prelato had, no doubt, made up his mind upon the principle, and, as to the details, there would be no discussion of them until the Dill went into committee. The Bishop of OXFORD said, there were several right rev. prelates who had had no opportunity of expressing their opinion upont the subject. Before mdking a grave alteration in the ecclesiastical law of England, the English bishops ought to come to some understanding if possible, of the views which they entertained. The noble and learned lord aid supphed another reason for postponement in stating that heh alterations in the Bill wrere both sUght and imporfant. He thought suflicient time ought to he given to the bench of bishops to consider the Bill wnth due deliberation. Lord LYNDBURST reminded their lordships that only fwo of the right rev. prelates had attended a former discussion of the measure. (Hear, hear.) Lord CAMPBELL concurred in deprecating postponemnent. TREATMENTI OF CEINESE PRISONERS. The Earl of CARtNARVON, in pursuance of notice, rose to inquire into the truth of esrtain statements in the Chitna Mail of the 5th of February last respecting the confinement of Chinese prisoners at Hlongkong- and to move for any paers connected with this subject, and with the trial of a baker and others on the charge of poisoning. He begged their lordships to believe that he had no wish whatever to revive any discussion upon the recert unhappy hostilities in vhich we had become involved with the Chtnese, and that he did not ask the question with any unfriendly feeling towards the Government. It was impossible to identify the Government with the facts to which the question referred. No doubt the Government were ignorant of the circumstances, and would be the first to require explanation, About two months after the commencement of hostilities, as their lordships were avware, an atrocious attempt was rmade on the lives of the foreign residents in Hongkong by some Chinese miscreants introducing arsenic into the bread. By a curious coinoidence, tho very morning the attempt 7was discovered by a number of persons eing seized with sickness the baker from whose factory the bread bad bten procured sailed for Mlaso. Supicion fell upon him and he was arrested, but it was only just to say he was on the point of returning to give himself un and that he pretested, so far from being the pioe,Shand p ~~~~~~~poisoner, ae had mnself been poisoned. However, with some 50 other ofite he C?as .arrested, anhd t£he fotlowing was the account '"We yesterday morning were witnesses to a seene such as our readers will have difficulty in creditingone we can scarcely believe would be perpetrated under the most savage and tyrannical Government, and such as no one could have ever dreamt of seeing in a Bri ish colony. We allude to 42 Chinese crammed into a cell 16 feet bng by 15 broad, furnished with only one imall aperture for ventilation, and confined there for 20 days, vnth the bare and damp ground for a bed, and in this space they had to perform all the requirements of nature, Covering they required none, for,ns may easily be supposed the den vas in a perfect stew, the air-hole being only 1i inches high by G feet long, and placed in the extreme upper corner of the room. We assure our readers this is a fast that can be substantiated by several witnesses. And Will it I e believed, too, that the miserable wretches subjected to ths bLutal treatment aro not condemned felons,-no, for them the best of treatment is reserved-but men under no charge, against whom the most active inquiries of our most active Attormey-General, enlisted heart and soul in the cause, have been unable to ferret out even a breath of suspicion. Some of them old men tottering to their graves, soene mere boys yet in their teens. . . . . Better far to bave deported, or banged, or shot them at once than to have exposed them to such frightful snfforings as they must Iave undergone during 20 days' suffocation in this black hole of Hongkong, the MwMalsf -which are newly erected, and the Tl18ster and fleer not even dry." When their lordships remembered the space in which the prisoners were confined and the length of time durin which they were exposed to such horrible physical 'eegradatlon, the account appeared almost incredible. In.Eagland they placed a bardened and condermed ruffian ina ce lOft. long by Sft. broad, with every comfort, so far as ventilation was concerned. But here they read of 42 wretched beings ia China confined in a lace not much larger than twice the size of their lordhips'ptable, although the7were untried, and, as circumstances turned out, were entirely innocent of the offence charged against them. Scarcey 100 years ago, after a gallant but unsuccessful defence, 145 brave Englishmen were thrust into a somewhat similarplace byn Enastern tyrant, and that placehadservedas a simile for extreme misery down to the present time, There were very few Englishmen who had not heard of the Black. haole of Calcutta, and the natural indignation which the recital of that atrocity excited was attended with the satisfaction that Englishmen were the victiaEs, and not the oppressors. But, in this instance, that consolation was denied, for in an English colony, surrounded by English laws, and in the name of English justice, one of the most barbarousacts ever recorded had been committed. It seemed that the case of those unfortunate men was not the only one of the hind which had taken place at Hongkong, in proof of which he would reed to the House another extract from the China Mail of the 12th of Fobruary. It was as followrs:- " We have another case to adduce, if such bo wanting, of that callous indifference to the sufferings of others which msarks the heads of the police and gaol departments. It may be reraembered that A few weeks ago about 150 men were apprehended somewhere in the Taipingshan, but afterwards al liberated, except half-a-dozen. These men were taken up on the Friday and placed within that Dortion of the gaol compound where the treadmill stands, there being no room for them in the prison itself; and there they were left all nlUt, some of them until Sunday evening, if not longer. e say nothing of the inhumamnty of leavinjg men thus exposed to the sun by day and the dews by night without covering of any sort and without even a mat to lie down upon; but on the Sunday the neighbours were alarmed by their cries, and it has since been ascertained that nothing Was given them in the shape of food from Saturday at 18 &m till Sunday at 2 p.m.-28 hours. Yet, on inquLry, we are told no one is responsible for such cruel neglect. Some one surely must be. These men, be it noted, were afterward discharged on finding reourity; they were accused of He (the Earl of Carnarvon) thoogbt no one would deny that rve responsibility attached to the authorities at Hongung for proceedings such as those, and he would say that it that 'was the spirit wvhich animnated our Administration is that part of our eastern dominions ho could not wonder thttes, _ _ _n__is n- ~iewslse weee twskon He bge totemove for all the Papers relating to the trial. othe baker and others on the eharge of poisoning; and in adverting to that subject he felt it his duty to bring under their Lordahips' notice the line of conduct which the Attorney-General for the colony took upon that occasion, and which appeared to him most extraordinary and unparalleled. On the trial of the men in questira the Attorney. General was reported in the Holgkcong journals to have aid, " If tehnbicalities of the British law 'procured their release the Chines asuthorities would be encouraged to repeat their diabolical attempt."w Again, " In a case of polsoning the mercy of the law should he restrainod, not relaxed." In England, on the trial of the most hardened ruff,an, the prisoner was invariably told that he was not bourd to say anything to criminate himself - but at Hongkong, a BrItish colony the Attorney-Generaf, on the trial In queston, deported Aimself in such a manner that Mr. Bowra, one of the jarymen, thought it his duty tocomplain of the learned gentleman's conduct as being barsh and unjust towards the prisoners. (Hear, hear.) The AttorneyGenenl appealed on the occasion, not to the justice of the cane, but to the political contingencies likely to result froee the procedlngs. It was, in truth, one of the most monstrous caie of which he (the Earl of Carnarvon) had ever heard. HIoe trsed the Government would think it their dut to produce all the papers beaing on this subject; and if the statements he read to the House, so lowering and debasing as they weoe to the English name, should be substantiated by official documents, he hoped the Government would not shrink from visiting the parties who were to h " with such an amount of censure as would meet the JUate of the case. (Hear, hear.) ed the rfend ~lepl Poceding atHonkongisadeaingwith the St- Sonora in question went to show, on the whole, that a cL and fair trial had been given to me n- to whom it would ba adiitted on IaU hand8 strong sjpicion attacbed of the comtnkssioD of a heino m criue. (Hear, hear.) So far from thinking that the admini~tration of tho law in. the English colonies wan such as to warrant the strong language which his noble friend had msad, he bolieved, on the contrary, I that it was administered there, as in the mother country, vitha calmness and consideration tovwards the prisoners h7bich had elicited the admiration and astonishment of foreigners of every nation. (EHear, hear.) [Acverting to the statemhants which had been read to the House by the Earl of Carnarvon as to the treatment of the prieoners in whbt was called "the Black Hole at Hongkong,' 'Lori i Rarrowby proceeded to read, but in so low a tone that the purport of it was not audible in the gallery, a counter. statement, made by the superintendent of police at Hongkhong, from which it appeared that the room in which the prisoners had been placed by him was situate on the ground noor of the building, and seemed to him a saitable place. It was, however, the only one at his disposal. This room was dry and lofty, 15 feet square, and was ventilated by a chimney and an opening at the top, as well as bya door which vrasfrequently opened. Theairintheroom wascertatnlyclose, hut not of that oppressive character which had been described in the public prints. None of the priseners were iUl, and none of them died; while, with respect to their ood, the usual prison rations were supplied to them daring jiiheir onfinement. The noble earl added that that was bhe sum of the information which had reached the Govern. ment on thesubleetwhich hisnoblefriend had brought under ths notice of the House, and he submitted that it was not of a charaoter to warrant the assumption that the English naime had been degraded by the authorities at Hongkong. The officers of the Government in distant colonies were in a pettion which involved serious responsibilitv. Indeed, their responsibility could scarcely be appreciated b residents in this country, aed when it was remembered that the British representatives in China had been surrounded by men who were prepared to resort to every refinement of treachery for the destruction of the European residents, it was not surprising that the authorities should have deemed it ntcessary to resort to somewhat extreme measures. An ordinance was passed authorizing the adoption of strong measures, and in consequence seven persons were deported and others were imprisoned. The acoused persons were tried, the trial was conducted with the most perfect fair. ness, and those who were acquitted were set at liberty, with the exception of one individual, who, under a special order, was kept in confinement until Instructions were received from the Rome Government. Those instructions had been sent out, and they directod that if any new circumstances should have come to light since the first trial the person believed to be the chief offender should again be brought-to triaL He (Lord Harrowby) must say he thought that accusations similar to those made by the noble earl ought not to be brought against officers of the British Government unless there was a reasonable presumption that the charges were well founded. There would be no objection to produce all the papers bearing upon this subject which were in the possession of the Government. The Earl of MALMESBURY thought that if his noble friend (the Earl of Carnarvon) had had as much experience as the oldest member of their lordhips' House he could not have guarded himself more carefully than he had done against making attacks upon any persons. Indeed, the noble earl had not said a word which could convey an impression that he himself believed in the correctness of any of the charges to which he had referred. On the contrary, he commenced by stating that he did not blames and that nobodycould blame, Her Majesty's Government for what had occurred in China, and that his object was merely to put a question to them on the subject of these ocourrenoes. The Gvernment were the only persons likely to be correctly informed as to the facts, and the noble earl had only adopted the course which it was his right aud duty-as it was the right and duty of any member of that House-to pursne, In applying to the Government with the object Qf Ascertainmng the truth. Instead oi rebukldnhis noble friend for bringing this subject forward, he (the EDarl of hMalmesbury) thought the noble earl opposite ought to have been thankful to him for doing so, because it was the interest of the Goverament that the truth should be known, in order that the public might not be misled by misstatements contained in newspapers published at a distance of 3,000 miles froin this country. The object of his noble friend was to ascertain. whether the Government had received any authentic inormation, and the noble earl (Harrowby) could not have said more than he had done in reply. Re (the Earl of Malmesbury) was very glad to hear from that noble lord that the Government had written for further information, and he hoped that when such information was obtained it would be laid before Parlitment. He wished to call the attention of the noble earl opposite to one point. A-lum and the persons who were tried with him were acquitted, and that acquittal, after the course which was said to have been takea by the Attorney General, was most honourable to the jury hut it appeared that after the trial A*lum, and nine of the persons accused along with him, were sent back to prison. Re thought it a starting circumstance that men who had been publidy acquitted after a fair trial should be recommitted to prson merely because, according to the newspapers, they vwere considered dancerous characters. Such a proceeding could only be justified in the most turbulent times, and he suposed that was the excuse which would be urged, supposing he statement to be true. Re wan very glad that his noble friend had called attention to this subject. and he hoped the Governmbnt would Institute a real bondj f inquiry, and that the results of tbat inq7 would be laid before Parliament, for It was essential that ocr officials in the colonies should feel that no distance could secure their acts from the most minute and searching investigation. The Earl of HARROWBY was understood to say, in explanation, that 10 individuals had been detained in custody at Hongkong, under special orders, as dangerous persons. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH observed that after the statements which had been made with reference to the conduct of the Attorney-General of Rongkong, the Govor. ment would probably think it right to institutO an inquiry into the proceedings of that officer. The msotion was then agreed to, and Their lordsbips adjourned at 6 o'clock.

Mr. V. SuITH said that all the public and b6nd flde debts of the King of Oade would be referred to the Governmnaut of Indir,, and, though he was not prepamcd to say that any particlur sam would be allotted for the purpose of defraying them, yet any debt which was shown to be public and bon4 fide would no doubt be paid out of the ordinary revenues of the country. CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION. Mr. MAC ARTNEY asked the Chancellor of the Excheuer when the report of the Civil Service Superannuation Commission would be laid upon the tablo, and whether the Government contemplated introducing at an early day a Bill to alter the system under which the superannuation allo w- ances were at present provided ? The CHRANC?ELLOR of the EXCHEQUEsmR said that he had been informed by the secretary to the commissioners that the report would be presented inthe corge of the week, and until they had seen the report the Government could not come to any decision upon the subject._ SHIPPING DUES. Mfr. HTUDSON asked the Vice-President of tho Board of Trade when be intended to propose a Bill for the abolition of the passing tolls; also, whether be proposed to introduce any Bill for the abolition of the charges on shipping at Liverpool and other places, and also for taking away the poirer of the Trinity-house at Newcastle ia the appointment of pilots for the port of Sunderland? Mr. LO E'B said that it was the intention of the Government, when the state of public 'business would allow, to introduce a Bill founded on some of the recommendations of the commissioners for inquiring into the subject of the shipping dues, who repo-ted in 1854, but it would be more convenient if he were to reserve a statement of its details until he asked for leave to introduce the BilL THE ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION. Lord P. CECIL askod the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether it washis intention to bringin a BiU embodying such of the suggestions of the committee of last session upon the Ecclesiastical Commission as required the sanction of Parliament? Sir G. GREY said that he hoped soon to be able to give notice of a Bill founded on the report of the commis. sioners. THE WHIITSUNTIDE HOLYDAYS. The Marquis of BLANDFORD said that, looking at the state of public business and the probable shortness of the session, it would be very convenient if the noble lord at tha head of the Government would state on what day he pro. posed that the House should reAssemble after the Whitsantide holydays. (Laughter.) Lord PALMERSTON said he would rather postpone his answer until the period referred to was nearer. The Marquis of BLANDFORD said he would put the question on a later day. THE UNITED STATES AND CENTRAL AMERICA Mr. WYLD asked whether the Government, in conse quence of the expedition now fitting out in the ports of the Inited States, the destination of which was said to be the coast of Central America and the terrtories of NewGranada, had any intention of stationing a naval forQe upon those shores for the protection of British interests ? Lord PALMERSTON.-In reply to the question of my hon, friend, I have to state that the Government have stationed, or are about to station, on the coasts of America, on both sides, naval forces which they think sufficient for the protection of British interests; but, considering the interest-I may say the anxiety-which has been excited in the puxblic mind by the rumours to which the hon. gentleman has referred, it would be more agreeable probably to the House that I should give a short explanation of this question, and of its present position. (Hear, hear.) The Heouseis aware that some months ago there oqcnrred a very deplorable scene of violence and outrage at the Isthmus of Panama; that a quarrel began-nobody well knows how,some people say that it was a simple dispute between a passenger and a native about a water-melon; but, at all events, it acted like a spark thrown upon a smoulder. ing fire, which burst out into a flame, and the reciprocal dislike which had been long growing up led to acts of great violence and scenes of bloodshed which everybodymust deoply deplore. The United States' Governmentapplied for redress for the pat and security for the futuro, but I am sorry to say that the Govornment of New Granada, which is not particularly celebrated for accurate recollections of duties or performance of obligations, refused compliance with those demands. Thence arose negotiations and commnunications between the United States and New Granada Governments, which have not yet led to any satis. factory termination. It is quite clear, I think, that that which is true in regard to private property is true also in regard to aGovernment-that it has its duties as well as its rights; aud that the Government of New Granada is bound to provide for the security of persons and property passing along the railway throu3h its dominions. The excuse which it gave for refusing compensation to those who suffered by these excesses was, I think, to a certain degree, its own condemnation, because it alleged that the high-handed pro. ceedings of the passengers for a long time before had created great exasperation, and it therefore was not wonderful that a slight cause should produce very considerable resufts. Now, I must think that if they knew that this great exaspe. i ation existed it was their duty to take moasures to prevent thp commission of outrges either by foreigners upon their own subjc¢ts, or by their own subjects upon foreigners. We havo been in communicatlon with the United States' Government upon this matter-a matter which evldently cencerns not merely the interests of the citizens of the United States, but also those of all other nations whose people arein the habit of traversing this isthmus. I am happy to say that the United States' Government profess the most just and honourable intentions. They disclaim any desire to occupy or take possession of any portion of the territory of New Granada, or of the railway. That which they are naturally entitled to expect is security for their citizens in passing and repassing the isthmus by railway; and they naturally also require some redress for the injuries which were sustained upon the occasion to which I have referred. I sln happy to say that their requirements are such as would be made by any Government in a similar position, and that they entirely disclaim any intention of taking advantage of this quarrel for the purpose of putting for. ward any unjust ox aggressive demands against the Governrrent of the State of New Granada.. (Hear, hear.) PARLIAMENTARY OATES. Lord PALMERSTON moved that the Rouse should on Friday resolve itself into a committee on the oaths of fidelity, supremacy, and allegiance, In order that he might pro. pose resolutions on which to found a Bill for the alteratioa of the oaths to be taken by members of this House. The motion was agreed to. AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS UPON WOMENT AND I:HILDREN. Mr. DILLWYN, in moving for leave to introduce a Bill to amend the law with regard to aggravated assaults upon women and children, said that he did not intend his measare to apply to cases in which a man had simply struck a v oman, although that was unmanly enou gh, or had reason. ably chastised a child. The cases with which he wished to detl were those in which a man, infuriated by evil passions or by drink, knocked down, kicked, trampled upon, and dragged by the hair the unfortunate victim of his brutality, or systematically beat a young child. To show that such cases really occurred he quoted two cases from the police reports of the last year. In the first of these cases, which was tried at thQ Westminster Police-court,- "William Eberland, a tinker, living at Maidenhead. coart, St. Ermine's-hill, Westminster, was charged with cruelty toBllen Eberland, hIs child, aged 12 years. "C omplainant, a wretched picture of miseryand neglect, sald,-The defendant is my father. I have a mother, who nved a; nome with us, but is now in prison. My fataer beat me last night with a whip, becauso he had left some money on the shelf, which. got lost, though I knew nothing about it. Mv father was drunk; he never beats me when he is seber. sty mother has been away a long while. My two little sisters and brother were the only persons in. the house. He took me out of bed, and beat me with the whip. IhAnothing on but my chemise. I cried out tiUl a woman came into the room, and then I -qent down stairs, and was taken to the workhouse. " Ferris Carr, 206 B, said,-About half-past 1 this morn. ing I was fetched to the house. I went upsfairs aud found the child naked, exeepting a bit of a sldrt round her body bleeding from the shoulders and back. The prisoner baA got a gutta percha whip in his hand, which he threw away whenL entered. I told nm I should take him to the station; when he said, 'I ll throw you out of the window.' I got asistance and took him into custody. He was drunk, but lkiew well what he was about. "1 Mr. Arnold.-What was the condition of the children ? *" Witness.-Most wretched; never saw anything so bad In my life. "M1s. Elizabeth Perry, the next witness, said,-I was passing and heard sbriek3 and cries. I heard the poor child say, 'Father, father, pray don't beat me auy more, cll try and find the money; Dbut he kept on beating her. A woman told me he had been beating her for two hours. I went to her,she had no skirt on. She wasnaked. Iput the skirt on her and covered her with the shawl she now wears. I noticed her back. Sho had been much beaten about and ill-used. I saw blood from the marks of the wlhip on her back and shoulders. "The child was here examined, and her back appeared one maui of severe lacerations, reaching from the thonlders down to the waist. The gutta percha whip (a stout riding whip with a thin point) was produced in court. "A sergeant said that besides the laceraUtions exhibited on the body and shoulders the child's leg were literay covered with wounds. " A nurse from the wrothoauuo prove Xh tfie elil4'a --baakwas bleeding.very-much. Thero were dmilarsinj' on boththighsandthe calvesofthe legs. Alithe doree were i teomostfiltbystato.

Wit~ never heard cries before, "'Thecase wFasadjourned, I5 orderto procure the cvideuceofs tothXer personsin thesame house to show prisoner's In the second,-. " James M artin, a carpenter, was charged before Mr. D'Eyncourt with cruelty to his wife. "ristow-, N 59, said.-At 2 t'his'mornin, while onx duty in Hoxton, I heard the sobs of a woman in Fo Znder'slaoe, a nd ~Oig alittle further found the prisoner'swi cy ittle child, which was almost naked, in her arms, and six other children in grief clinging to her. She wy her husband had turned them all out. afnd on my asking hy.hehaddonesoheinvitedmein. Irefused, andasthe woman and children came trembling up he exclaimed to his wife, with an oath, that he ' would give it to her,' and dealt akickatbher- with all his force. The woman did not cry out, hut I seied him, sayi'ng I could not see him commit such violence as. tbat, and he instntly exclaimed 'I'll1 d 3 for you.' and struck her with his fist in the face. The blow in my opinion, was struok as hard ashe could hit her, for°se reeled staggerin agan t hpae, and when Isaw her face full half an hour afterwards it was very badly swollen. The man was somewhat the worse for drink while the woman was perfectl sober, and, as she refused-to charge him, I took him to the Robert-atreet station and chiarged him myself. "M Mr. D'Eyncourt.-I find that half the outrages upon women brought bere arise from drunkennow. What'do yott say to thecbarge? "Pfisoner.-Whys I don't recollect much about iL I have not had any work since Christmas. " Mr.-D'Eyncourt.-And yet you can find money enough to get intoxicated, and while in that sate ill-treat your wife and turn her and the whole of your children into the street a 2 in the morning, Thisis really too gross; you vwiU go for two months' hard labour in the House of Corrcttion, where, in spite of your inclination to the contrary, you will be kept sober, and when Jou come out of prison do emem. ber the ties that bind you, and try and kieep sober still, in consideration of your wife and her helpless children. (To the officer of the districL)-You will see if a little asistance is not wanted by his family durng the man's imprison. ment." Casea infinitely worso than these had occurred, but, sa he did not wish to overstate his case, he would not refer to anr other The crime was one of frequent occurrence. In tthe two years 18A And 1855 there were 877 of these assaults, During the course of Last year tho number of convictions in the metropolis under the present Act were 374, and, although the number was smaller than that of the preceding year, the diminution was very small, and there were a great many cases in which men whohad been previouslycont,icted of aggravated asseults were again brought before-the magis. trates charged with the same offence,-a circuanslnoe which clearly proved that the present punishment 'was Inadequate to deter men from the commission of those assaults. In the Bill which he now asked for leave to introduce he proposed to give power to inflict the only punishment which he beheved would tend to chock the offence. He proposed 'to diminish the term of imprisonment and to substituto floging during its continuance. (Hear, hear.) When he had brought forward this subject before, one of the leading prints had entirely mistaken the object he had in view, and 'had spoken of it as an interference between. husbands and wives. Now, it was nothing of the sort; for during the pst year, in the Hunmersknith -Police. court, out of 47 of these asults only 27 were committed upon wives, while there had ieen one upon a sister,. 14 upon strangers, aid five upon children. All that he hadi in. view-was to protect weakness against violence, and many of these assaults wero committed by men upon women who Were not their wives. These offences existed to a great extent, and he hoped that the Government would support his efforts to put an end to the eviL (Hear, -hear.) The hon. gentleman concluded by moving for leave to bring in a Bill to repeal the Acet of the 16th and 17th of Victoria, cap. 20, and to make better profision for the prevention and punishment of aggrvated asnalts upon women and children, and for preventing cielay and expense in the ad. ministrition of certain parts of the criminal Lawr. Sir G. GREY would offer no objection -to the introduc. tion of the Bill; but -he wished to add that in his opinion the bon. gentleman had'incorrectly assumed that the Act at present in force had been inoperative because a great number of cases of assault had been brought before the police-conits. The great object of that Act was to provide a remedy by affording immediate means of punishment. Before that Act it was foand that in cases of aggavatedl asaults it was necessary to send them to sessions, and then in a vast majority of cases the saufferers would not come forward to give evidence ani the culprits escaped. That Act, how. ever, provided that the person committing an asanult could be brought before a 'nagistrate immediately after the injury had been inflicted, and could be sentenced -to six months' imprisonment, with hard labour. 'Under these circumstances, no doubt, agreater numberof cases were brought under the notice, of the public than had been- under the previous system- but still hehad no doubt that that Act had in realit tended to diminish the actual number of these assaults. It had not, nor had any criminal Act, put a complete atop to the crime which it was intended to reach, hut it had produced results decidedlyf benetciaI. If any further remedy, howvever, could be proposed, it wras the duty of the HIouse to takte it into consideration, and he should not therefore oppose the introduction of the BilL. The motion was agreed to, and the Bil1 was subsequently brought in and read a first time acordingly. 'THE SALE OF BEER. Mir. HAPRDY moved that the Act to Regulate the Sale of Beer be read at the table. The motion was agreed to, and the Bill read by the Clerk at the table. The House having then, on the motion of Mr. Hardy, gone into committee to take into consideration its provision- Mr,. HARDY said that the subject of tho sale of beer wag one which required legislation, and, Indeed, the Secretary for the Home Department had admitted that such was the case, without holding out any promise of legislatiox by tho Governmen' in the present or any succeieding session. But even if it were otherwise, he should still feel it to be his duty to persevere with his Bill, in favour of which he had received the strongest assurances of support from iall parts of the country. Now, without referring to thedetails vwhich had been laid before the committee who had sat upon tho subject of the Bill, he should content himself with appeling to the experience of thoee hon. gentlemenir o vere accustomed to act as magistrates and grand jurors whether that subject was not one which demanded the most careful scrutiny? There was an anomaly existing in. connexion with it to which his attention had been particularly directed, and which consisted in the fact that there were two descriptions of houses licensed for the sale of intoxicating iquors-namely those publichouses which had been established for the sale of wines and spirits and those houses known under the name of beershops which had been established since the year 1830. Now, it seemed to himtobe somewhat remarkable that the latter class of houses, which had originally been licensed, for the purpose of meeting the wants of the poorer classcs of societyby sup. plying them with a wholesome beverage, should be permatted to receive their license without. say satisfactory. examination being entered into as to the characters-of 'their proprietors or the general fitness of the establishments themselves, while the higher class of publichonses were liable to a much stricter scrutiny. It ws also, in his opinion, a great anomaly that, while magistrates in the exercise of their jurisdiction frequently deprivedathe owners of publichouses of their licenses in consequence of aome mis. conduct,those very personsasa matterof everydayoccurrence opened beershops for the salo of intoxicating liquors, and gathered around them the very class of people who had previously been their customers, and who had brought their establishments into disrepute. (Hear.) He wishedtherefore to see both descriptions of houses placed upon -the same footing, and the main object of this Bi was that they should be Heensed in the same manner. It had been sald that the question was one with which it was difficult to deal en account of the amount of capital which ws invested in the trade - bat he had also directed his attention to that point, anD he did not propose to interfere with the existng beers opws, which would still continue open, unless by some misconduct upon the part of their proprietors they were brought under the cognizance of themagistrates ' When such an occurrence took place, he proposed -that the person who sought to obtaina mew license houId appeal to the magistrate and not tothe Excise,as.was at present the case,He wished, moreover, to exten4d the operation of the T"ippling Act, and thus to put a stop to that system of giving credit Ln beershops wrhich wFas the cas w.o the ruin of so many families. It constantly happened that men under the influence of intoxication ran up considerable scores at those places, the payment of which they always disputed, zand thel consequence w^a that the County Co"rss were very frequently occupied in trying actions 'for debts of that description, which under the beneficial rule which prevailed m the old Courts of Re nquest could not lawfully be recovered. That was an evil with which the Bill proposed to deal, There wa alaso another matter in reference to which he wished to make a few remarks,- he meant the existence of coffeeshops in which ardent spirits were sold. He desired to plazc those establisbments under the saperintendenco of the polioe, and to regulate them so that if their proprietors happened to lose their licenses for misconduct a certain time should elapse before the lHcense coula be renewed; and his firm conviction was, that by makin! the publichouses more respectable a great benefit would be conterred upon the classes by whom they were frequented (Hear, hear.) He bad heard a great deal said upon the subject of unfair licensing, but he felt assured that anybody who had paid attention to the report of the committee must perceive that the imputation of unfairnes which had been cast upon the magistrates was to be attributed ratherto the colouring vwhich disappointed applicants for license hid given to their acts than to any waut of fairness in those act, them. selves, As the right hon. baronet the Secretary for the Home Department had informed him that he would not Opppose the introduction of themeasure he should not trouble the committee further, but would at once conclude by moving, "¢that the chairmanbodirected to reportthat the committee had awreed to a resolution upon which a Bill was to be founded to aamend the laws relating to the general sale of beer." (Hea, hear.) Nr. KERE-SEYMER regretted that the hon. gentleman had not asked for leave to introduce two separate bills to effect the two distinct objects which ho seemed to have in view-namely, tho licensing, under certain .resriotton; of coffee as well s of beer shops. The'e was no doubt in his (Mr. Seymer's) opinon th eoffeeaops didrequireregulation, and that they ought to hava oderate ense imposed upon therm as a eans of bringingthemfromtimeto time-nder the cognizae ef som pubic authority. If his hon, friend had brought fox. war * Bill to effect that object, he woBild haTq bNa4ii sup ,port. He,.however, not ouly.did& but propoiee to CY to a greater extent the anomalous state of thingp in reference to publichouses and beershope which had already been con. deened by the report of a eommittee'of that House. Thit aomoaly of having two ,ata of li*tutea honum for the sale of wine, spirits, andbeer, the comrittee had e should be got rnd of by granting but one& license, andjjtle jisstitution of a strict investigation into the eLaracter of those establshments. HIis hoe. friend howevter, haa adopted a difforent course, and'bas lMr. Seier) believd tbe question involved in the Bill to e oheof princile, hs should most certainly oppose it when it o ams on for reFding. - I Sir J. PAKINGTON expreued a wish that Her Mjesty J Govermnent should deal with the subject of the Bil instad i of leaving it in tho hands of- a private rnember. The evils conncted with the existence of the present state of .things was so E greSa4 that. he for one felt disposed to support any meaure by which relief tboseo two evils could be obtained., He could not, howeve, hope that his lion. friend neirhim was likel.y to carry his Bill to a successful issue, considering the bnef period which would probably elapse before the close of the se ion, and ho therefore wAsanxious to asoertainfror4theright hon. bironet the Secretary for the Home Department whether he could not give some assurance that in the next session of PFaliament the, Government would be prepared to grapple with the subject by means of a legislative enactment. Sir G. GREY said that the hon. gentleman who asked for leave to introduce the Bill under the notice of the comi mittee had Ist session brought in a similar measure, which had stood for second reading, but which the House had never had an opportunity of diecu.sing at that stage of its progress. He had therefore informed the hon. gentloman thatheshouldotTernoopposition toitsre.introduction. le had not, however, pledged himself to support the Bill, and he might now state to the committee that he had received several communications expressing the strongest desire that it should not pas into a. law. The enormous amount of capital which was invested in the beer trade rendered itnecessary thatthe question should be dealt with with the utmost care.. Coffeeshops might be much more easily regulated than the other establments to which reference had boen made, but he must at tho same time. observe that he did not think it wvould be advisable to, consider the. wo classes of houses separately. In answer to the right hon. baronet- the member for Droitwich, he could only say that the Government had no intention to iatroduce a measure to reguate the sale of beeer during the present session,' nor could he mi;ke any premise with reference to the introductin of- a bil next dear which hoald justify him in askin'gthe hondugentasmin opposite to wyithdraw the Bill which he had submitted to their consideration. The discussion which would take place npon that Bill might clear the wray for the proposal of a more satisfactory measure. Mr. M&RADY, referring to the observations wrhich had fallen from the hon. member for Dorset (Mr. E. Seymer), taid that if that hon. gentleman should introduce a Bill in strict accordance with the suggestions contained in the report of the committee, but, as a conseqxnence-as he (Mbr. ardy should under'ake to show-not mn accordance with the evidence, he should be prepared to offer to it as strenuous an opposition as the hon. gentleman had promised to offer to the measure tunder the notice of the committee The resolution was agreed to and the House resuaned. leave was given to bring in the Bill, which was reada first time. PROPERTY QUALIFICATEON. ifr. L KNG, in moving for leave to bring in a Bill to abolish property. qualification for members of Patliament, saidth,t members, withsome few exceptions, had been so recently compelled-many of them at some trouble'and expense-to hand in a statement of their qualifications that he need not trouble the House at any length with reasons in support of his motion. The present stite of the law was Snrrounded by anomalies. County members were obliged to have a property qualification of 6001. a-year, while borough members were only called upon to show a property qualification of 3001. Gentlemen north of theTweed were elected without anypropertyqualification ataL. Members for the Universities, the eldest sons of peers, and the sons of knights of the shire also took their seats without producing any property qualification. When he compaed those members who produced a property qualification with those who were eiempt from this necessity he could not' see' that the member s for counties, and for England, Wales, and Ireland generally, were, so superior to those from Scotland and the lJniversities as to show the necessity for the distincHion. Among other anomalies which the present stae of the law presented, it would be in the recollection of many members that an hon. gentleman had a seat in that House, and ropnslned a member of it for 14 years. He sat as the eldest ton of a'peer, and when his father died he continued to sit without handing in his qualification. Had it not been for the leniency of the House 'in acceding' to a mo. tion that he might -be-aUoved--to -hand in his qualification,. this gentleman might have been in a seriou3 dilemma. The tcase of the son of a knighi of the shire was another absurd anomaly, for it he continued to sit in the House after his father's death he could not take his place without handiDg -in his qualification. 'But the stronget argusnent of aU was that supplied by the right hon. gentleman in the chair. He bad been 'umanimopsly elected by the House, and the Crown had approved the election; yet when the right hon. gentleman stood upon the step3 of the chair, *nd before he could -take his seat in it, he was obliged to hand in a statement of his qualification.' 'The propert qualification had its erigin at a period when it wva considered desable to shut out the trdig cldmsss from the House, and an actual qualification, in landedpropety -was accordingly insisted upon. But that qulitionhad been abolished, said the traditng d sses were uow allowed t'o sit without landed qualification iftlitey posessed. thenequisi amount of personal property. If mecnberg re elected by universal, suffrage there might be' some rgument in favour of a property qualification, but a there was no appro=ohto such a state of thingsh saw no zea6on for any onger insisting upon a property qualification. He would accordingly move for leave to bring in a BiU to abolish the property qualification for members of Parliament. Lord PALMERSTON.-S, .1 hought it. had been the understanding of the House that 'all questionsconnected with the representation of the people in ParLiament and the organization of this House should be postj,dod until cext session (hear, hear), and should not be brorght into discussion at present. (Hear, hear.) At the samie time, If my hon. friend is desirous, as he ntay well be, of laying before Parliament the ideas that he wishes to see embodiod in a BiL on this subject, I am not going to oppose his intention It will be satisfactory to him, no doubt, to lay before Parliament the arrangemeDt that he prefers to see idopted in the place of that which exists Undqr thesa circumstances, I hope he will not take it amiss if I abstain from entering upon a discussion of the Bill that he pro. poses, and if I say that he has not stated any very conclusive grounds why we should agree to the change the proposes. ([Hear, hear.) It appeas to me that my hon. friend has himslef acted on 'the undersanding that exists, that discussion on theso subjects is not desirable during the present session. I trust, therefore, he will not' complain if I follow his example; and if, while he has not given us any reason in favour of his Bill, Aexopt that there are anomalies at every point in our legislation, I should, on the other hand, abstain from entering into a discussion or froum offering any objection to the BflL I shaU not offer any obstruction to the introduction of the Bill 1hear, hear), bat I hope my hon. friend will be content to le i ille on the oable for consideration betwveen this and the nest session a.

Leave was given 3Mr. to OSBORENl to bring in a Bil for enabling the Commissioners of the Admiralty to purchase certin lands in the parish of Chatham, in the county of Kent, and to stop up, divert, or alter certain ways In the said parish, and or other purposes relating thereto. The Bill was read a first time. PORTLAND HARBOU L;eare was given to Mr. OsBonBZ to bring in a Bill for the better supply of water for the use of veses resortng to the harbour of refuge at Portland, and for enabling the Commissioners of the Admiralty to supply such wrater; fori vestin in the said commssioners certai lands helonlging to.

WHE KAP!B22. TO THIE EDITOR OF TrE TITME. Sir,-In 2Vie 2Tmes of this morning I observe a letber from Sir William Napier, stating that Sir James Outraus published in 1814 letterfnll of the 3nostshaneless aaluaies and insinuations agsinst Sir C. Nipier, "telling the soldiers (78th Highlanders), that the Generat had move them through pestilent marsheoss aid: wilfolly as well s ignorantly caused the frig1stb caluity that had )efail .sr *bem. -Mr. Baist, of theBony Times, reportingtheae _ sation; actually denounoed SirzCharles Napieras-'-the mar-- derer of the soldiers "' I , I Sir Janues Outram at the date referred to was politicaL agent at Hundlassisjin the Inuore dominions. My coxsvictionis that he never publishod any letter whatever on ths subject. I am certain he never employed any words in an3. way reembling those assignedto him. It is with the acustion against myself alone that I am. concerned. I utterly deny the truth of the charge brougTt gainUt me, and challenge Sir William Napier t3 produos the passage he professes to quote. The Highlanders left Krrachee for Sukkur in Aagpst or September, 1844, a, period of the year when Sir Charles Napier confesses that. Scinde ia pre*emiriently siekly from the subsidenoe of thtt 1nundclion. Medicil opinion, still to be fotmd on resord in the-publia archives, was strongly opposed to tho move. ment at that season. Sickness made its appearance before. the ttoops reached B.dnrabad, and! became frightfal ocr their arrival Mt Sukkar. I saw the regiment leave Bombay,under Colonel Twopenny, just before a visisor in my ho_se,, nearly 1,100 strong, and saw it return 18 months-afterwar reduced to less than-400. Istated these factson-Ue athb rity of the official records then in Sir 0. Napier'shandu,7 and stm in existenoe. When, on the 27th of January, 1851, Sir 0. -Napier, in addressing the 78th on his landing at Boambay, accused me of the oonduct now imputed to me, and assertedthat silknesshadfirstmade its appearance in the regi. mont in the hospital at Sukkur in November. 1844, I me. him from the regimental books, which showved that it bad broken out at Hyderabad in October, and cllallengec him to produce tho words he hadW so unwarrantably put in may mouth. The answer was the ordinary' one-a "broomstick' or acourt of law. I was at the time on tho spot, ready to meet him or his friends in any way they desired. Of course, I was never call upon. I am equally on the spot now, equally ready to meet all respondbilities, equally convinced of full immunity from. dinger in any of its forms. Th preent cbarges arequito as true as are about a hun.; dred others inSir William Napiee's book against me-they are not one - whit more so. Two of them may be, given as a sample of the whole. He assert that, in 184 I was lin Paris writing for the French prees"-know'ng that, from 1840 till 1845, I had never for an hour been out of India. He chargesme with having stolen at Bombay A- copy of 2%4 Conquct of &fisde in July, 1845-knowing' that-I had left Bombay in May,-and did- not returm to-ittill the following year. He adds, that his brother.

On looking over Sir William Napier's volumes, just pubv. lished, I find that in the portion relating to -his Bombay eweer, about 800 pages in all, there are on ain average fromx two to three misstatements a page, tho majority of thenx capable of refatation from official documents, a very large number of them bearing his brothezs? signature. Having in February, 1845, convicted Sir William Napler of somethreescore deliberate misstatements knowingly madeP. in about three times as many pages, mny contradictiorsbeins established by quotations from omficial documents, I had of late years given up all idea of noticing his romances, wMhic, laughed at as they are in India, I find in England stll commaand attention.

"PuLIuc RBu= K a" IN cO unr.-Some misuini derstanding has arisen in tho parish of Lochrutton, owing to the revival of the old practioe of public rebuking in church. Two members having left the church on the occadon when the rebukIng was going om were. re(fNw Church privilegesby the Kirk Session, and thoyappeeled t the Prsbytery7of Damfrie. A long discsmion took2lae on the practice, Xr.

On the Sunday hi uestion, when public rebuking wsa going on, upwapvd of 0 of the congmation had left the church, and in doing so had crerted a perfect tumult. Mr. Hope said that, for hi% part; he would soonor eat hls fngers off than Alt and li%text loany rebuking for fornication oradulter. There wa not one minister in a hundred who observed publie rebuking, and he considered the doing so an abuse of their privilege as clergymien. MIr.

LZ(.DOA, WEDZESBDA Y, MA Y 13, 17. Iu the lHouse of Loards Last night, The LORD CHNCELLOR, in reply to an appeal from the Bishop of OxFoRD, declined to postpone Athe second reading of the Divorce Bill, which is fixed for Tuesday next. The Earl of CARNARVON moved for papers connected with the alleged poisonings at Hongkong by the Chinese, and with the treatment of prisoner3 arrested on suspicion. After some discusion, in which Lords Hsxnownry IALMMSBUY, and ELLmijoRoouOH took part, the motion was agreed to. Their Lordshipa then adjourned. In the House of oDmmons, in reply to Mr. WYLD, Lord PAxMEzSTOr etated' that Ern Ajwxvs Government had tationed, or was about to station, on the coast of America such a naval force as they thought necessary for the protection of Britith interests; but he, at the same time, gave an explanation of the state of affair on the Isthmus of Panama, respecting which, he said, HFR MAusrv's Government had been in communication with that of the United States, and he was glad to say that Government professed the most just and honourable intentions, and disclaimed any design of taking possession of territory. Mr. DiLLWYN moved for leave to bring in a Bill to repeal the Act 16th and 17th of Victoria, cap. 30, and to make better provision for the prevention and punishment of Aggravated Asaults UpRon Women and Children, and for preventing delay and expense in the administration of certain parts of the criminal law. He referred to cases before police-courts to show what was meant by " aggxsvated assaults," which the existing law, he considered, was incompetent to repre3s, and he proposed to substitute flogging in lieu of imprisonment, as the only punishment that would, in his opinon, really stop these offences. Sir G. GunY, 'without feeling mueh confidence in the efficiency of the proposed remedy, offered no opposition to the introduction of theBilE Mr. Lw~ had, he said, unjustly assumed that the Act now in force had been inonerative; he believed, on the contrary, that it had a very beneficial effec, and worked welL Leave was then given to bring in the BiLL The House having resolved itself into a Committee on the Beer Acts, Mr. HAnDY moved that the Chairman do move for leave to bring in a Bill to Amend the Laws relating to the general Sale of Beer by Retail, and to regulate certain places of public resort, refresh. ment, and entertainment, the main object of which, he said, was to require that, licenses for beershops should be granted by magistrates in the same way as publichouses. Mr. K. SnysrEn did not object to the introduction of the Bill, but he should, he said, oppose the second reading upon principle, considering it a question of monopoly or free trade. Sir J. PAXWGTON suggested thet this subject s;hould be taken up by the Government. Sir G. GREY did not oppose the motion, but felt that the remedy proposed to be applied would not be an efficient one; the subject should, he observed, be carefully dealt with, and if the Bill was the same as that of the last Parliament he. was bound to oppose it. The motion was agreed to, and leave was given to bring in the BilL Mr. L. Kns moved for leave to bring in a Bill to abolish property qualifications for members of Parliament. Lord PimsToN said he thought it had been the understanding of the House that all questions connected with the representation should be po poned until next sesdon. At the same time, itMr. KixG was deslrous of bringing before the House the ideas he intended to embody inhis Bill, he would not oppose its introduction; but he hoped Mr. Knss would be content to let it lie upon the table for consideration In the interval between this and the ensuing Sesion. Leave was then given to introduce the Bill; and, after some further buiness, the Houe adjourned at a quarter past 6 o'clock.
Mr. BHRDY, who brought in a Beer Bill to the House of Commons last night, must have immense faith in the power of law, and not less blindness to fact. He still believes in the power of law to secue the thirsty publio from bad liquor and bad morals. Such a confidence is all the more remarkable since Mr. ERDY believes law to be necessary for these purposes, the common palate and the common conscience being both so depraved as to offer no resistance to nux vomica or evil communications. Not having ourselves spent all o'ur lives In a "H Happy Valley," but knowing something of London, and some very average rural districts, we are bound to confess that in these delieate matters, questions of taste as they may both be eonsidered, we have not learnt to expect much from the best intended operation of magistrates and licences. In the metropolis, for example, it sometimes raises a smile to remember that the publichouses and all places of amusement and resort are not only under the control of the police, which, of course, they ought to be, and which is not so mnich a matter of legislation as of natural- law a-nd common sense, but under a strict paternal govermnent-a system of arbitrarylicences. Take only half a dozen publichouses, or gin palaces, as they are ambitiously called; note. the sort of people who are going in and out or standing at the bar; note the hour; observe the policeman dropping in every now and then and coming out rather brisker than he went in; if you can, ascertain the nature of the stuff, under whatever name, that flows from the long range of taps, and you will feel it hard to believe, or rather absolutely ridiculous, that this is the fDnished work of legislative wisdom and benevolence. Fer Gracious MJJESTY, her Lorda, and her faithful Commons stand behind the bar to guard the purity of the drink,-to protect the gin from aquafortis and the beer from drugs. With equal care these august personages sift the company, and secure that even if you take the cup of Comus you shall not be made one of a swinish rout. Yes, incredible as it may be, it is even so. These are indeed gin palaces. They are as much created and cherished by the Legislature as Windsor or Buckingham Palace. We see the result. Mr. HRADy is satisfied with it. We are not. There are suffieient reasons why everybody undertaking a place of public resort, and bringing people together, should give some sort of security for his character, whether by sureties or by a money payment, or both. Any auch place has ilportant bearings on society, {or good, may be, or for evil, and imposes additional trouble on those who have the charge of the public peace and order. Those persons, then, who open such places, for whatever special purpose, may fairly expect to be under a close personal supervision, and, if only as a contribution to the cost of public order, to pay for a licence. Accordingly, the Select Committee of 185 recommnends the extension of the system of personal licenses to all persons opening any place of public resort, without, however, any limit to the number of licences or any idea of adjusting the supply to the demand. It recommends that any man who can provide proper sureties may, by the payment of a fee, varying according to. the purpose and the circumstances, open anywbere a publichouse, a beeraliop, a coffeehouse, or a temperance hotel, and that anybody may, with a licence, give a concert or a theatrical performance. The only prorer limit to all these things is the power and the disposition of the public to use them; and of that the public are the best judges. The public themselves know best what they want and where they would rather go for it, just as they know what species of vehicle they require and for what journey. In the matter of personal character [they will be glad of assistance. In this respect the analogy of the cabman sufficiently appi'es. You may know a cab and a horse when you see them, bhut you may not know by the look of the man that he was drunk yesterday and drove his cab against a lamppost; that he charged a French-' man half a sovereign for tkidng him from London-' bridge to Loicester-square, or that he appropriated a parcel left in his cab. Iin like manner youmay In6w wiat merit and drink to expect in a publichouse, but if it should turn out that the publican knowingly harboured thieves or other bad characters, and that while you were taking a meal in the parlour your host's friends were plotting a midnight visit to your pantry or yoir preserzes, youf would justly feel it the duty of the State, if possible, to preserve you and the public generally from such treacherous hospitality. Personal licences, then, are fair enough, and this is the extent to which the Select Committee of 1854 ventures to go; but the principle of licensing particular houses, and affecting to give so many publichouses, like so many churches, to a given area or population, is a violation of the principle [of free trade, and evidently answers no good purpose. I The present licensing system has the double vice of not anBwering a public end, but a private one. It is quite superfluous to enlarge on what is notorious and has been proved over and over again before Parliament till no one can deny it,-that the result is a monopoly in the hands of great brewers, under the hypocritical disguise of public health and morality. The character of the State itself and the respect due to the magistracy are seriously compromised by a system in the hands of a small but powerful class, and administered by them with an unscrupulous regard to their private interest. Such is the system which Mr. HARDY wishes to push to the utmost possible extent. Our own conclusion, forced upon us by what we read, by what we hear, and by what we see, is that ithas been tried, and that it has been found wanting. It certainly does not secure the public from either bad drink or bad company. It is but a small proportion of householders in this metropolis who have mialt liquor direct from the brewers; the great majority have to send to the publichouse, and the chances are that they get their porter drugged, and the servant who goes for it exosed to the contamination or annoyance of bad company. There is not a household of any size that has not had some one or other of the servants, male or female, led into bad associations, or worse, by the neighbouring publichouse. It may be said that this cannot be prevented under any system; but, if so, what becomes of tha system of house-licences ? As things now are, if one gentleman or a dozen wished to set up a trustworthy man in a publichouse to sell really good, unadulterated liquors, they would find the ground already occupied by the brewer's tenants, under terms, it has been proved before committees, often incompatible with honest profit. But it may or may not be possible to mend matters. The public may or may not be competent to select their own malt liquor or spirits, as they certainly are not infallible in the matter of wines. They may or may not prefer the highest music, or the clasaical drama. But, if thoy cannot always take care of themselves, does the system of publichouse licences secure their morals andtheir drink? It certainly does not; and it now remains to be proved whether, after all, the public is not its own best protector in these matters.
No one wil1, we think, be disposed to deny that the Savings-Bank is an institution which deserves the active support of the nation as a community. We are reproached by foreigners with the too great concentration of wealth and the limited number of the people who are raised by the prospect of a competence to appreciate the benefits of forethought and economy; and, indeed, a population dependent on daily wages for its daily bread is a spectacle which gives reason for reflection, if not for alarm. There is something too artificial in a society which is at the mercy of every wind that blows and every frost whieh sets in,-the prospects of which may be marred by every blight or drought, every political disturbance or financial panic. A rise in the price of cotton, a mortality among silkworms, or an increase of one per cent. in the price of money may plunge thousands of our labouring classes into destitution. Such a state of things cannot but be considered as a chronic disease of the State, for which the only remedy is the prevalence of saving habits in the bulk of the people. With prudence and selfdenial most people might insure themselves against being ruined by merely temporary want of work. The surplus of good wages may be laid by, to be received again with interest at a time of bad wages or no wages at all. The xlack season may be tided over without a recourse to the workhouse or the streets, with all the demoralization which follows the brealing up of a home and the passing of weeks or months in idleness or beggary, or worse. But, unfortunately, there are few things harder than to begin to save. The sum to be laid by seems so s3naU as the foundation of a fortune, while the gratification it will give is so palpable and immediate, that we cannot wonder if week after week the workman should make good resolutions every Monday morning and break them every Satrday night. In fact, we might almost say of our uneducated and impulsive labourer, that without some interference and help from without he will never rise to a higher condition morally or socially. The philanthropic individuals who founded the first Savings-Bank felt these things acutely. They knew that there is nothing so hard as to invest a little money; and hoarding is contrary to the instincts, and, perhaps, too continuous a sacrifice for the self-denial of the EDglish poor. It is a most important fact, and one seemingly at variance with the moral laws, which we feel tend in the main to equality and compensation, that the acquisition of wealth is made more easy in proportion to the previous means of the individual. It is easier to turn ten thousand pounds into twenty than one thousand pounds into two, while to operate with tens is most difficult of all. What, then, is it when the saving is only of shillings T Limited liability may do much for small capitalists, but even this will be found to benefit chiefLy a class above those who labour with their own hands. The Savings-Bank must, therefore, be the chief depositary of the workman's store; and, if the country wishestodevelope in thelabouring classes those habits of prudence and morality without which education is merely like the teaching of parrots, and church services the enaction of a dreary farce, it must not be content merely with acquieseence, bnt take an active part in placing on a firm foundation these institutions which are to insure society against the blasts of sudden calamity, at the same time that they elevate and humnize the millions for whose sake they are established. We cannot, therefore, but agree with the principle of the resolutions proposed to thie House of Commons on Monday night by the CHANcELLon of the ExOcEQ&uR. That principle may be stated In a few words,-the securing of a Government guarantee to the depositors, and, as a necessary consequence, the establishment of a Government control over the conduct of the Banks. Of the nagnitude of the interests concerned there can be little doubt. At the close of the year 1856 there werg 1,339,000 depositors, to whom there was owing no less than 34,899,0001. The amount deposited within the year was 7,740,0001.; the amount withdrawn was 8,020,0901. No less thaa 221,000 new acconmts were opened, with a deposit in small sums of 2,153,0007. ; 195,000 accounits were closed, and the sum withdrawn was 3,696,O001. It is evident that, with deposits to the amount of nearly 35,000,OOOt., belonging to thirteen hundred thousand depositors, the SavingsBanks require cautious legisation, and stricter control than has yet been exercised over them. ln-fact, Govermment has always been, and still is, in a false poition especting them. The Banks have in the oyes of the depositors, and of the greater part of tho public, a natioual character ; and this belief, though unfounded, has been sufficient to induce Governmnent to make, in more than one case, compensa tion to those who have suffered by mismanage. ment or fraud. Now, some of these cases have been of the most camdalous kind; and, while the country has suffered by being forced to make good a part of the deposits, the depositors have been still unsatisfied. The Goverament, therefore, proposes to take in reality the responsibility with which the feeling of the people has invested it. At present it is responsible onily for the sums actually remitted by the trutees and Iodged in its hands. By the Bill of the CHoCELOn of the EXOHEQ1J it will beresponsible for all sums deposited in the Banks. As the country will therefore make itself liable for the 'whole of this 35,000,0001., which may be largely increased in a few years, security will be taken against fraud or negigence on the part of the local managers. The appointment and superintendence of the various offlicers will remain as heretofore with the local authorities, but the Savings-Banks Commissioners will have power to make general regulations as to the duties of these officers, and to fix the amount of security to be taken from them. Before a Bank can be admitted to the benefits of this Bill it will be compelled to prove its solvency by the production and examination of the books of the - depositors. Furthermore, no private individnal or company will be allowed to establish any Bank under the title of "Savings-Bank." The use of the term will be prohibited in respect to all Banks not established under Savings-Bank Acts. Such are the principal features of the proposed Bill. The subject is of much importance ana of some complexity, and of course more than one member proposed to refer it to a select committee. But we trust that the Bill will be pro. ceeded with during the present Session. A committee-room is the grave of legislation, and, as the present Bill is but a reproduction of the measure proposed last Session, there can be no reason for postponing the consideration of it from a year when there is likely to be no great political question stirring to another when the representation of the country wil be under discuision, and perhaps half-a-dozen questions connected with Continental and Eastern affair With regard to the fear of certain gentlemen, that the influence of Government or of the subordinates of Government will be excessive under the new Bill, it certainly seems that sufflcient latitude in the administration of the Banks will be left to the local authorities, while the control of the Government will be no more than is justified by the guarantee which is given for the security of the deposts. After all, the question can be reduced to a few words. Under the present system there is a wide and wellfounded distrust. The deposits, though large, do not increase as they might be expected to increase, and the number of Banks is, we are told, stationary. A national guarantee is desired by the depositors, and is offered by the Government. Such a guarantee would restore the whole system to efficiency, and effect a great and lasting improvement in the habits of thepeople. It iafor sensible men to consider whether they wil reject this offer, offered so freely, and on terms so little burdensome.
There was a frightful story in our impre8aion of Monday last of the fall of certain houses in Tottenhan-court-road. Several lives were lost, and, as is usual in such cases, under circumstances calculated to arouse the deepest commiseration: with the fate of the sufferers. We hear of the desolation of a distant country by a pestilence, of the slaughter of thousands upon a battle-field at the other side of the globe, and, although our sympathies are excited and a snomentary horror pervades the mind as we hear the tale, yet we acquiesce in it readily enough. Have not those who are gone suffered the ordinary lot of humanity, to which we in turn must submit? Were we to grieve for the destruction of our kind, every moment might claim its mourners. He who reads the account of the storming at the great breach of Badajoz may be said to grieve, generally for the glorious dead; but in point of fact his real sympathies go rather with Colonel MKaLEoD and Captain HARD miN, whose exact sayings and doings are so recorded that the individualities of the two heroes are brought home to the mind. J1ust so was it with that ghastly story of the ruin in Tottenham-court-road the other day, with this additionalaggravation-that the sufferers were doing precisely just what we and ours might have been doing at the time they came to so tragical an end. The unfortunate man who was mangled by the great beam in so shocking a manner might have been one's-self; any one of the houses which toppled down might have been one's own house; at least, the ruins might have fallen on our own heads. The affair passed under our very eyes, among our own people; -we might have prevented the occurrence, had we exercised due vigilance of police. The account which we published contained certain circumstances of detail which might well excite the imagination, and which, although dealing with familiar objects, strike, us as far from ludicrous. When the walls had fallen down, and nothing remained but a fiat side wall, there was the fire still burning, and the kettle which was to boil the water for the mornisig's meal hiiesing and sputtering away. The luclMes servant who should have " taken it off" .was lying disfigured in death below. There were the dishoovers ranged against the wall-the teapot on the mantlepiece, with its lid open. Against another section of the same wall there was a rack, and upon this rack hung certain articles of clothing. The wearer and owner had been rolled down into the ruin below as he was dozing in his bed, thinking, perhaps, whether he might not expatiate in one more delightful stretch ere he faced the pervading discomforts of the east windL These things happened on the morning of Saturday last. The very familiar and domestic incidents and accompaniments of the tragedy render it all the more shooking, and rightly so. Let us take this additional horror as an incentive to wiser action. Let us put our own matters to rights before dealing with the municipal miseries of Mexico or the porcelain peculiarities of Pekin. The wonder really is that more accidents of the like kind do not occur. Even in our mostcrowded thoroughfares, such as Fleet-street and the Strand, we see houses just kept from toppling about the ears of the passers-by by a judicious system of props and supports. For how long a time were these supports and props needed before they were applied? Look down that narrow street-it turns off from Fleet-street-the great tideway of London life. You will see a great meshwork of beams run across from house to house. - It seems as though some huge portentous spider, whose entrails were of timber, had there spun his web. Were these wooden securities depreciated but for a xiioment, one side of the street would at once bow to the other, which would as readily acwnowledge the compliment by s siimiiar act of courtesy, and the inhabitants of a street would be swept from the roll of the lFing. Such instances are to be met. with everywhere in old London-within and without the city boundaries. There is dangerin thecontinuanooof xuch a state of things-there is danger when improvement is attempted, as improvements are tow carried out. It may be admitted. that considerable difficulty exists, even where every exertion is ued, when we would. ascertain. the condition of rickety tenements actually standing, if the owners are resolved to baffle inquiry. LeT a surveyor or other person charged with the responsibilities of such functions strive to perform his duties never so faithfully, he wil constantly be exposed to delay and defeat. It should, however, be otherwise when the house or row has been absolutely condemned, and when it has been resolved to shore it up or pull it down. From that moment the brick and mortar patient should be in the hands of the surveying M.D. From that moment, if mischief occur which could have been avoided by reasonable diligence orprofessional skill, the surveyor, and the Aurveyor primarily, should be held anwerable for the result. If the surveyors be not enough in number, if theyare not paid at a sufficient rate to insure to the public the full benefit of their time and attention, by all means let their number be increased and their pay too. In -a matter involving the security of to many lives we must not be penny wise and pound foolish. Old London is hobbling about on wooden cratches, with chalkstones protruding through its gouty joints ;-we must pay the surgeons welL This is no subject of interest to the poorer districts alone. We would add a word or two on the miseries of Mayfair. -How is it that the quarter of the toWn on which the stamp of fashion has been most deeply impresed contains sio many wretched streets, with low, darl, wretehed houses,which would appear to be destined for the use of the humbler clamse ? True, the situation goes for much, snd the talismanic word ":Fahion" esplains aLl. But why should Fashion fi her abode in low-ceiled drawing-rooms fourteen feet by twelve? Why should Fashion delight in a pervading snell of roast mutton if the windows be closed, and of dunghills and horsereek if they be open? There can be no doubt that the area which is limited by Oxford-street and Piccadilly on the North and South, and by Park-Iane and Bondstreet on the West and East, is the very best site in London. It is inhabited by the wealthiest and most dist hod people 'in England during the season, and even out of the season. It is, notwithstanding, true that for the most part the houses and streets throughout the district are of the most paltry kind. Enormous rents are paid for habitations which would be dear at one-fourth of the price. The reason of all this is, of course, patent enough. The streets of this favoured cistrict were built for the most part at a time when the English taste for street architecture was at its lowest ebb, and vwhen the price of all building materials was at its flood. The excise on bricks was enormous-so was the Custonms' duty on foreign timber. Air was weighed in a jealous balance, and light meted out with a costive measure to the freeborn Briton, who was aserting the felicities of the unrivalled constituion under which he was living against the attacks of revolutionaTy France. This state of things, however, has passed away. We know how to build very tolerable houses now', even as far as mere sightlines is concerned, and Cua= has worked a perfect revolution in interiors. It Is high time that the great proprietors in whose hands the title to the soil in Mayfair is lodged-they are but few in number-should look a little closer into this matter, not only for the national credit and the comfort of Londoners, but for the sake of their own pockets. We are not much in the habit of standing forward as the advocates of speculation, but we verily believe that there is no other iuch speculation in Europe as that of covering Iondon-proper with rows of stately streets. The people who can afford to pay high prices would be quite willing to pay higher prices for suitable aooommodation there than in Belgravia or the region of Tyburn. Belgravia lies low; Tyburnia is a charning place, but then it is so far from London. The district we speak of is the centre of fashionable London, and we cannot see that before Mr. M&oAuLAr's New Zealander sets out on his travels it can ever be anything else. The Parks, the Palace, the Clubs have taken up a stable position. Why, then, should this chosen epotremain a mere aggregate of tumble-down fifth-rate hous and narrow streetsuncomfortable to adults, a destruction to children, a discredit to Englishmen, to foreigners a dirty surprise, and to housemaids a despair ?

BASRA, XAncH 10. My last to you was dated from Buihire on the 26th ult., and, though there is little to communicate, I nowauend you another line to xay how scatters are going on. The strong north-weeters which prevailed for nearly a fortnigltt provented any reinforcements from coming Aup, and, in fact, precluded aU intercourse even with the shipping in the Busbte roads Some little was done, however, in despatching transports to the estuary of the Shatt-ool Arab, and on the 8th inet. the following vessels were moored at the mouth of the river :-the Ocean MIonarch, with artillery ; the Futty Nooharek, with camp followers; the Avalanche and the Euxine, with Horse Artillery; the Kingston, with two companies of the 78th Highlanders; the dride of the Sea and the Fatty Sultan, with five companies of Her Majesty's 64th ; also the sloop Falkland and two gunboats. On the 6th in*t, moreover, when the weather had become fair, thre steaLmers-viz., theFeroze, Pioneer, and Pottnger, steamed into the harbour of Bushire with- five vessels in tow, bringing the 23d Native Infantry, part of the 3d Cavaly, and more arery. This was a cheering sight to Sir James Outram,- who, as soon as part of the Scinde Wose arrives (expectea at Bushire about the 15th), will bring up the remaining part of the force destined to act against Mohammnerah. This force wfill consist of about 3,500 men of all arms, and an equal garrison w%ill be left with the camp before Bushire. There is little fear, however, of any attempt being made on [the latter by the enemy, and should -they try that game every preparation has been made to give them a warm reception. Four redoubts, armed with heavy guns, have been, constructed, so as to Command every avenue towards our entrenchments, It is rumoured, however, that the Persian Regulam got such a lesson at Kooshab that they have declned making any advance in our direction, and, to meet this feeling, orders have been sent to the Coormander-in-Ohief of the Southern Army to strengthen his position below the pases, but on no accouat to meet the English in the plains. Tho arnival of so many vesels at the mouth of the Shatt-ool Arab has evidently led the Perdans to believe that we shall land somewhere in that vicnity, and accordingly a large body of cavalry has been despatched from Mohammerah to watch our movements. The preparations which the enemy had previously been making to strengthen their position on the banks of the Hafftr, leading to the town, are sufficient proof that they anticipated our attackc thence; whereas there is some reasn to believe that theroute by the Bamisheer would have been ultimately chosen, and that the former ws merely a feint. The Bamisheer is only navigable for boats of light draught, and it would. consequently have necessitated great delay and an infinity of trouble to transport our troops and mrnat~Z by that route, nevertheless the attack from that side had two advantages; first, we should thereby have taken the enemy in the rear, and thus rendered all their forts on the Haflir useless; and secondly, we should have been in what re regarded as indisputably Persian waters. A circumstance which took place the other day, however, will in all probability change the point of attack. The' Comet, a small iron steamer belonging to the Indian navy, which hax been stationed on the river for the last eight yar, and employed exclusively in carrying mails, was fired upon by a body of Persians at a place called Buerdeh, eight miles below Mohammerah. The fire consisted of musketry and jinjallr, and nine balls have been extracted from the paddleboese. The fire was not returned by the steamer, which proceeded on her course towards the mouth of the river uninjured. OX the 9th the Comet returned again to Basrawith despatches, and as she passed Buerdeh the Serbages set up a continuous shout of defiance. It is to be hoped that this glaring infraction of the neutrality of the river will be noticed by the Turkish authorities, who, however, much to their own eventual injury, have allowed the Persims of late to erect very strong forts commanding the river. Had we not been at war with serious this tould not havo been alloweT without serious quewtion on tha pert of ahe Turks consequently, the latter may almost be sad to hav8 countenanced their opposition to us. Letting that pass, it is now clear that we shall be blameles on all hands, if we retort upon the Persians their attack upon us in what are called neutral waters It is sincerely to be hoped that the capture of Mohammerah will induce the Persians to come to terms. Had they not violated the terms of the treaty with regard to Herat I presume the preient war would have been avoided; for, notwithstanding. your srictures on the subect, I feel convinced that our Government would not have proceeded to op enhostilities with the Shah for the minor points of difference. The dismissal of the Prime Minister appears to be one of our demas,-Ademand, perchance, beyond what we ought to ask, considering the alleged 'attitude to the Court assumed by our mission. It would be hardly fair to ourselves to offer such a sacrifice, or even to consent to it. Nevertheless, it is probable that the Shah would give up his Mliuister if we would change our Ambassador. At all events, it is to be hoped that the representative who has done nothing to bring about a good uinderstanding between the two, Powers will not be permitted to interfere in the tems of the treaty, thould one be concluded; and, further, that if it is deemed necessary that- Mr. Muray should hold the post of Ambassador at the Court of Teheran sub3equent to the ratification, the term ill be limited to the shortest periodpossible.

BXHIBITJON OF THE BOYAL AGADEMY. TnTnrn WnTTfRm. We look upon DIMr. Millais as in about the moat dangerous position in which it is possible for a Young artist to be placed. Oontemptuously or vehemently decried by one set of judges, indiscriminately anid outrageously praised by another he cannot, it is to be feared, hope for reliable guidance from public criticism. The judgments usually passed on his pictures this year may irritate him, but from their sweeping censure he will probably take refuge in commendation as sweeping. Unless he be so lucky as to possess friends intimate enough and trusted ehiough to be able to tell him harsh trutbs without incurring suspicion of prejudice, and of whose admiration of his great powers he is so well assured as to accept their censure with respect, we should feel some fear for the future career of this rarely gifted young painter. If he can believe that a professional critic is anxious to take this rank among his friends, our remarks, honestly and kindly meant as they are, may be of some service to him. If not, it is his fault, and; not ours. His picture of " Sir Ysumbras at the Ford " sins so conspicuously and unmistakeably against positive laws both of proportion and light that we can scarcely believe Mr. Millais himself to be blind to the worst of his own mistakes. But, before adverting to the defects of Alie picture, we are anxious to do justice to its merits. The picture irepresents an old knight bareheaded and in gilt armour on his war horse, carrying two childrau,a girl on his saddlebow, aboyon his crupper, across a river. It is evening, and the limpid green light of sunset still lingers above the horizon, upon which the line of hills stands out in deep purple, with a fringe of brown autumnal trees relieved against them, their red leaves strewing the green banks of the river. A broken bridge clothed with ivy, some buildings, and two nuns walking on the further margin of the stream, complete the distance of -the picti're. Nothing can exceed the solemn twilight hush and calm of this background. Bellydeep in the water, which comes down quite to the foreground, the " Grande Destrere" ploughs his way. Except a clump of dry rushes in one corner, there is nothinig between the horse and the spectator. The girl looks up with mingled curiosity and awe in the face of the old knight, and the boy clutches his body, thinking more of his own equilibrium than of anything else. The head of the old knight, taken by itself, is worthy of the background; and, though there is good reason for exception to the size of the girl's eyes and the drawirig of her lower limbs, there is a vivid rendering of the expression intended to be conveyed in her face and action. But the proportions of the horse are impossible, and, even if we grant that extraordinary size which the verses in the catalogue attribute to the " Grande Destrere," the drawing of the animal is throughout fau7ty, and the texture of his coat untrue to nature. The knight himself appears stunted and dwarfish, and his foot, making every allowance for the clumsiness of the solleret, is out of all proportion to the rest of the body. But there is a graver defect in the picture. The sun has set, and the sky, limpid at the horizon, muat necessarily deepen up towards the zenith. The reflection of the sky iu the water must, as a consequence, dar1ken towards the foreground. In the picture the water, down to the extreme edge near the spectator, is as light as, or even lighter than, the horizon itself. WVorse than this, we nust insist upon it that the whole foreground group is represented under a light far more vivid and displaying local colour far more positively than is consistent with the time of day. Granting that the background is true to the solemnity of twilight, and the foreground group strong in colour and forcible in relief, we maintain that the respective merits of the two are incompatible. The picture has thus mimsed being, what it might easily have been made, an impressive and grand work, and Mr. Millais, by inattention to obvious conditions of form and light, has laid himself open to ridicale and acorn from those wrho are only too glad to layhold of theopportunityof overlooking, in the glaring faults, the great merits of his performance. This is not to be wondered at, for Mr. Millsis has not trusted to finish; indeed, much of the picture is carelessly painted, while the composition invites criticism, so daringly does it depart from all received notions of agreeablenesm and grace. Every man is at liberty to throw these over if he can substitute for them deeper and more thoughtful qualities. But the mnistakes of the artist here go far to rob his work of any such redeeming merit, which, if more correctly painted and drawn, itmighthave claimed. Mr. Millas' other picture, " The Escape of a Heretic," has all his peculiar force of action and colour, pushed in the former quality to the very verge of exaggeration. It is easy to read the painter's intention. The story is too well told to leave any doubt as to the impetuous " Hush !" that is bursting from the protruded lips of the lover, or to allow us to misinterpret his fierce clutch at the hood he is drawing over the girl's head. There may be some question as to the drawing of the limbs under the brown Capuchin's frock, especially of the further leg and foot, but the ungraceful turn of the limbs here rather helps the eagerness of the action. There is particular skill, too, and humour in the way in which he has expressed angry surprise and bewilderment in the reverted eye of the gagged monk, while the glimpse of out-door green through the hole in the wicket is painted with surpassing truth. But both these pictures leaveus in anxiety for the future career of the painter, there is so much of daring, so much of shortcoming, so much that looks as if lir. Millais fancied himself no longer a learner, but one who has reached the point at which he cau throw finish on one side, and defy minute criticism. There is the same tendency visible, as it seems to us, in his small picture of a Highland soldier reading a letter from home in the trenches before Sebautopol, where the whole lower part of the figure is laid in in the coarsest and slightest mauner, and the feet, at least, are palpably out of drawing. Was this figure painted from a photograph ? We pass now to the landscapes and portraits of Academnicians. With regard to many of the former praise or dispraise are alike superfluous, What can we say of Mr. Stanfield but that he is what he has been any time these last ten years? There is no work like his " Abandoned" of a few years ago, lifting his familiar merits into a hi-her region by the choice of a subject that appealed powerfully to the imagination. We cannot class his " Port na Spania" of this year among. works of this class. Granting the power with which he has painted the cold green peak, with its underlying strata of crag, and its crowvn of columnar basalt, trendingr offeither way into the horns of its double bay, and the grand swirl of mingled cloud and saspray which he has swept dowrn into the nearer hollow, we yet cannot but feel that his sea is tame, even granting that it is the day after the storm which swept those huge galleons on the rocks, and that it dan(ies rather than dashes the raft and floating wreck. Of his other pictures in this exhibition we can say nothing that has not been said a hundred times, and even Mr. Stanfield must be surfeited of newspaper praise. Of Mr. Witherington we say nothing, but that there doubtless must have been a time when he painted better. He could not otherwise have earned the letters to his name and his place on the line. About Mr. Creswick we feel very much as we do about Mr. Stanfield. Here he is in his own class of subjects, with his old merits and his old and worst defects-uniformity of tone and texture; but we may point out as more than usually deserving of praise the clear autumnal morning sky behind the single figure which crowns the bank in his " Meeting of Brook and River" (219). Mr. Roberts displays his well-known power of arcbitectural drawing, of skilfully indicating details, and of effectually dashing in scenic crowds, in his interiors of Milan Cathedral and the Church of St. Gommaire, and in his PiazzaNavona at Rome. But we miss the awful gloom wvhich broods around the bronze pulpits of Milan, and surely Italian sun never left architecture so clayey-coloured, so blurred, and ouitlines so indistinct as in this Roman picture. Among l\lr. Sidney Cooper's different cattlepieces is,one (513), described by Beattie's lines,- " When in the crimson cloud of even "The lingering light decays," in which the darkling cattle come out very impres- sively against the sky barred with gold and purple. Mr. ltcdgrave htas a real and deep feeling for English landscape, which has found excpression this year in three pictures,-" The Cradle of the Riverx" (189), the "Moorland Child" (238), and the "Har- vest Field" (514). The &-st is beautiful, though so simple that the subject might be found In any Hampshire beechwood. Hlis foreground is a ferny bank, clasped by the rooes of two beech trees, whose lustrous stems. le3n over the quiet pool into which the spring broadens from ita secret runnel, with wood walks stretzhing up from it to the clear blue beyond. A gossiping group of peasants, who have come for water, aud a woman, with her bundle, descending the path behind the beech-trees complete a picture thoroufhly true and familiarly less iskempt than the title would lead one to anticipate, but the sunlight sleeping on the slope behind the gate against which she lean;, and the sky overhead swreetly imagined, are beautifully expressed. His "Hlarvest Field" is an unpretending sweep of Surrey distance, with a foreground of lirvesters at their work. The only value of the thing is in the intense enjoyment with which the painter has felt and transmitted the homely and peaceful beauty of his subject. But it is a great thing to be made to feel that a man has his heart in his work, and with this the homeliest subject acquires a charm which works moxe powerfully imsagined do not possess, if once we feel the paintez was not thoroughly and lovingly absorbed in the picture he gives us. Mr. Cooke is not a man of great imagination, but he is a most conscientious painter and close observer of nature, and never proved it more than in his " Crab and Lobster Shore" (28), " Bit of English Coast" (500), and " Thunder-coud passing over the Dutch Coast-Tide on the Turn" (535). The first two are studies from the beach at Bonchurch, truthful to every nodule in the chalk, and every boulder and mass of clay upon the shorehaving no other charm than that which the intensely faithful rendering of any aspect of nature must always have. But in his large picture, " Morning after a Heavy Gale-Weather Moderating," Mr. Cooke has risen much beyond this. His scene is laid here on the edge of the terrible Goodwin. The rusty lightvessel rides at her moorings, half hidden inflying scud and lurid storm cloud, her crew shouting hoarse response to the hail of a Ramsgate pilotboat, which, with reefed mainsail, half hoisted, wet with the sea-wash and straining against the halyards, is runnig a race against the Foreland lifeboat down to the dismantled bull of an Indiaman ashore upon the sand. The wreck of her boats is still drifting, and one solitary. figure is looking eagerly over the quarter-rail, through the blinding spray that is flying over her gunwale, into the dreary leaden sky beyond, while, like a stormy pall, over lightship, pilotboat, lifeboat, and wreck, the dense dun storm-clouds are rushing up on the Wings of the wind, as if the destruction in their womb had not yet worked its worst. The welter and whirl of the sea, the shouting crew, the gallant giving-way of the hardy fellows inthe lifeboat, and the dreary lookout of that one living man left on board the wreck, are powerfully combined into an effect which you must stand before the picture some time to realize, but which, once realized, raises the artist into a very high rank among painters of the sea. There mighthave beenmoremystery,moreawfni. nessl, about the treatment of the subject in the hands of a more imaginative man, but Mr. Cooke bas givea as much literal horror to the scene as is compatible with his nature, and the result is a very great work of the order next to the higheat. Among the portraits of the year we should unhesitatingly assign the first rank to Sir J. Watson Gordon's manly and kindly head of the Hon. Lord Murray (363). The painting is free from that lividness which often mars the effect of this painter's portraits (particularly noticeable this year in his head of George Combe), the drawing masterly, the relief vigorons, and the attitude eay and natural, with none of the stereotyped superfluities of background; no red curtain, no column, no inkstand, no dashing landscape. How those accepted portrait backgrounds pall upon one I How many a tolerably painted head becomess intolerable by their intruson I Surely, if our portrait painters knew the deadening and distracting effect of such accessories we should see fewer of them. T:his portrait, and that of Sir George Clerk, of Pennycuik, are among the best specimens of this master we remember. If character be the crowning merit of a portralt, perhaps that most characteristic head of Miss Hutton, of' Lanark (302), should bear away the palm even from those we have mentioned. Never was sihrewd, bard Scottish nature, more powerfully written on every lineanment of a face. If th colours of this work wrere equal to its character, Sir J. Watson Gordon need fear no rivalry from poptrait painter, past or present. But how cruel to paint General Sir James Simpson with a back- ground of gabions and camp fires, as trim. as if he had jtust turned out of his lodgings in Pall-mall for a levee I }Have such generals no dust and soil of their trade upon them I Is the " non indecorus pulvis" reserved for sutalterns? One naturally compares Sir J. Watson Gordon's works with Mr. Grant's. A usual, Mr. Grant distinguishes himself by the air of good breeding in his heads and the fidelity of hislikenesses. His " Viscount Galway" is a spirited and manly example of the master. IHis" I Lord Lans downe," though an indifferent picture in colour and texture, gives the shrewd, observant, kindly expression of the Marquis, and the attitude is happily and pleasantly characteristic. His " Lord Rokeby" is another speaking likeness. " General Sir George Pollock" in Mr. Groant's hands looks at least more like work than "Sir James Simpson" on his rivsl's canvass But as good a military portrait as either we have mentioned is Mr. E. Phillips's "Sir John Burgoyne," serious, concentrated, and observant; not padded and buckramed like "Sir James Simpson,' but looking like work, though as unslovenly as a soldier should be. And, while we are upon military portraits and their costume, there is "MIajor L. Goodlake, v.C., Coldstream Guards," who looks like notbing less than a Commandeo-in-Cbief in the hands of Mr. J. E. Collins. Thepainterseemstohalvebeen determined hissubject should be at least dressed up to the mark, so he has appare'led him-a most gallant and hard-working soldier-standing as he is in the very trenches, with a relief party of his own Co'.dstreams a few paces in the rear-in full ball-room trim, gold belt, tassels, and all ! The well-earned Crimean medal and the Cross of Valour would have looked better on a coat with something more of the gloss off it. His pendant-c" theHon. J. B. North, 1st Life Guards"is at least in place in his splendour. He is painted, helmet in hand, stately descending a flight of palatial steps, as he might while engaged on one of the arduous services of his distinguished corps at a Drawfing-room or a State ball. Of Mr. Pickersgill's portraits the less said the better. He is rapidly getting past the age when criticism can be either useful or agreeable, and not even the gorgeous trews of BMjor Mackenzie of the 72d, or 'the more verdant, but equally conspicuons, kilt and sporran of Roderick of the same clan, shall tempt us to dwell on the singular character of that portrait-painting which leave upon the spectator's mind a 'vivid impression of the tartan, without the slightest recollection of the head that looked out over it. The ladies, we venture to hope, will approve Mr. Granfs deviation from established practice in painting " Mrs. Markham" (126), equipped for a winter walk, in her felt hat, with linseywoolsey tucked up, stout leather brodequins-if we may not call them boots-gallantly buttoning her gloves aJ she trips over the snow-a stout hearted, bright-faced, wind and weather defying 3nglishwoman. What a relief the winter landscape is from such mnane conventionalities of rock, and wood, and sky as Mr. Grant has put his charmig "Mrs. Peer' (154) into I Probably the uninitiated cannot conceive the straits portrait painters are put to for backgrounds, for we have observed that even the most intelligent of them plead hard for the old-established wild landscape, or still more time-hallowed curtain, pillar, and window with no sash in it. If it were not very difficult to get rid of thete accompaniments, can it be supposed thab so thoughtful and experienced a painter as Mr. Richmond would have stooped to them in his excelent half-length of " Archdeacon Bentinck" (144), a head and figure so natural that one feels the untruth of the setting aU the more strongly? We are glad to see the great advance which Mr. Richmond is making in oilcolours. The work we have referred to, his "ViceChancellor Kindersley " (224), and his " Sir John Robinson" (623), fully bear us out in saying thatMr. Richmond promises to attain almost, if not quite, as high a distinction in his pictures as in his drawings. Mr. Boxall's theory of portraiture seems to be that the less atention is bestowed upon everything but tbQ he'A te kqtteQr, He, at least, is no salve of e curtain, the pilar, and the inkstand. But his sli;ghtnens of execution is apt to creep from the figure into the head at times. When he avoids this fault, as he has avoided it in his portrait of " David Cos" (499), and in his " Admirl the Hon. George Grey (94),'and does not- fall into clayiness of tone, none of our painters give us more spiritual and character. jBtic likenesses. Why did he mar that charming anonymous sketch-it has no right to the rank of a finisbed work-(116), by cazeless drawing of the oval of the face? So pretty and delicate a chin ought not tohave been pushed on one side so rudely, in any hurry of labour, and Mr. Boxall could not surely have grown tired of so lovely a sitter. Mr. Knight has set his shump of uninistakeable resemblance on his portrait of "Sir Charles Eastlake," -gorgeous i his doctor' gown and presidential chain and medal. Mr. ficksee, a new claimant to the honoura of portrait-painting, has a capital three-quarter length of~ "Mr. Willcox, the Member for Southainpton".... one of the easiest and most life-like works of ita class in the exhibition. But there is no end of this portrait criticism. When we have said that Mfr. O. Smith, an Edinburgh artist, has painted the "Earl of Stair" with so much appreciation of character and such excellent likeness in the head that we only wish he had confned himself to the head, and have protested as energeticallyas words can against such utter abominations of tea-boatdy courtliness as M. Boutibonne's " Queen and Prince Albert," we have given quite as much space as we can, spare to this department of the Exhibition. One general remark we would make in conclusion. After all we have said in praise of this year's works of this class e are still painfully sonsible of the Vast gap Which divides even the best of our painters of portraits from the great bygone masters of the art, even in our own achool, How we must still long for the charm and variety of Reynolds, to say nothing of the marvellous relief and life-like solidity of the best heads of Vandyke, and of all ths heads of Rubens and Rembrandt, or of the high-bred dignity and gorgeous colour of Giorgione and Titian I Every portrait of theirs is a poem, a life written in a face, by all the resources of the most consummate art. Of what face here can we say with sincerity anything like this ? The art of portraiture has, somehow or other, receded into a lower range of achievement altogether. The works of even the beat here belong to a different order of art from the common productions of such masters as we have just mentioned. Is the difference more in the painters, or in the persons they have to paint ? Perhas it is most just, as well as most charitable, to divide, the shortcoming between the sitter and the artist.
ROYAL SURREY GARDEZS. The second season could not have commenced under more ausploious circustances than on Monday night The wetMher being highly favourble, the attctions of the musi-hall and gardens were doubled, and an enormous crowd assemllesd The hail-storm -which fell not long before the hour for commencing had a nost beneficil effect, sinco there ws jus time for the grounds to dry, and the air, which had been sultry and oppressve in the afternoon, assumed a pleaant and salubrious freslhnes Everything seemed to smie upon the undertaldng, and the result was quite as brilliant as at the festival which conferred such6dat noon the opening of the Royal $urrey Gardens iast smson, At an early hour crowds were making their way from all points of the compass to the place which the universally popular M Jullien has now adopted permanently as his summer home, and with unexampled rapidity every corner of the vast muic-hah, whether private boxes, galleries, or area, was filled. A spetacle moro stiring and animated has rarely been witnessed, and ths many hundreds who were unavoidably denied admittanoe lost a treat which it would have been well for them had they arrived early enough to make sure of. But, to those who think seriously and wish well to the community at large, the most grtifying crcumstance of all was that the thousands upon thousands who thronged the hall and gardens had been enticed there y musir,-and not simply by music in the abstract, but musio of the very loftiest description. The attraction of the even}ng was neither more nor less than Mendelssohn's oratorio of Ea. Theincidents that make up the repertory of the Surey Gardens proper were most of them in abeyance. There wera no fireworks, and the grounds were not even illumnted So that the music-hall, and what was advertised to take pluce in it, lured the people without the aid of adventitious temptations M. Jullien had announced a grand perform. ance of Mendelasohn!s immortal work with an orchestra vobsl and instrumentl, 1,000 strong; supported byprinipa singers of the fist rank 3IL Jullien, who Is notorious for redeeming his promises, and as won the great public renntation he enjoys as much by his honesty as byhis ungar energy and tent, as usual kept his word to the letter. Although only as late as Friday night he concluded a flying tour in Holland with a brilliant and successful concert at Rotterdam, he was at his post on Monday night, punctual nd diigent as is hi wont, with an army of musicians under his control of such formidable proportions as none know better than himself how to marshal and conduct. The first sight of Julien set the minds of the audience at ease, and he was welcomed with a roar of plause. When he waved his baton to begin the plaudits were renewed; and after -Mr. Weiss bad pronounced the terrible denunciation of the prophet, a magnificent peform ance of the overtur. whfch so graphically desenbes the misery and sufferings of the drought-afflicted people, at once declared that Mi. Jullien had summoned as fine a band together as London could afford. The first chorus-." Help, Lord,"-into which the overture leads, proved beyond further question that the multitude of ingers was formed of not less efficient materials; and from this point on ard the oratorio proceeded with always augmenting succes. It is unnecessary to describe, step by step, the performance of a work so well known. Suffice it that the general effect was imposing to the last degree, and the execution admirable both for attention to detail and the combinaton of Dasses. The choruses of the Baslite priests, and the overpowering "Thanks be to God" (which was followed by vociterous and long-continmed plaudits), were the most strinlDg features ef the firstput. In the second, as examples of splendid choral singing, may be mentioned "Be not afraid 3" "Woe to him, he shall perish" (which ends with terrmible earnestness the scene where Jezabel excites the infuriated mob against Elijah); "Behold the Lord God assed by -` the sublime and simple aanctus-"Holy, holy, eoly is God the Lord, the Lord of sabsoth " rnd last, not least, one of the most difficult and rarely successful of the whole-" Then did Elijah the prophet break forth like a fire," which concludes with the trnslation of the prophet to heaven, in a "fiery chariot drawn by fiery hores." Every one of these was worthy of unqualified commendation, and did equal credit to Xi. Jullien and the vocal and instrumental forces under his direction. The solo singers-Miss Lousa Vinning, Madamo Weiss, Mrs Lockey (who appeared in consequence of the indisposition of Miss Dolby, and was a worthy substitute for that eminent sacred singer), Mr. Weiss (Elijah), and Mr. Sims Reeves-all sang their very best, and tended in no small measure to produce the satisfactory isue we have recorded. Itis unnecessry for us to particularize their various merits after this general commendation, more especially sinoe at Exeter-hall the successes of the same artists in the same oratorio have so frequently been stated and commented on. Unanimous encores were awarded to the unaccom. p tniedtrio, "Lift thino eye@7 (Miss Vinning, Madame weirs, and Mrs Locke); to the tranquil air, -0, rest in the Lord (Mrs Lockeyu; and to the second song for the tenor, "Then shall the righteoVB shine forth" (3r. Sims Reeves). It was also the general wish to hear Miss Vmning reLeat the alr, " Hear ye, Israel," at the beginning of Part IL; but as thatpiiee, instead of terminating upon a full close, passes by a striking transition of harmony into the chorus, "'Be not afraid," M Jullien properly and judiciouily went on with the performance, aD declined to frustrate the intention of the composer by interrupting one of the finest points in the oratorio. Other conductors (at our great provicial festivals, for instance) might imitate his example with advantage. The oratorio was listened to throughout by the immense multitude with undeviating attention, and the applause was not less discriminating than it was frequent and enthusiuatic. At the conclusion hi Jullien was again loudly cbeered. Such an opening of so popular a place of amusement was nothing less than a triumph for the cause of good muic, and for this reasonwe have more thanordinarygratification in reporting it. It-wasstated that nearly 1,000 persona obtained admission into the gardens without payment. We can scarcely credit tbis; but if it be trne, we oonlysay that there must be some very defective management in certain departments.
A MUx SHoT BY . CI,RGymAN.-At. an early bour on Wednesday morning. the 6th inst. the Rev. J. E. Green, of Erdington, was arouned from his sleep by hearing a noise beneath bis bedroom window. He immediately arose, and, on looking out of the window, observed a man moving about in the garden. Mr. Green awoke his servant man and returned to his own room armed with a loaded gun. At this moment he heard a noise at the front door, and again seeing the man in the garden he thrust the muzzle of the gun through the glass and fired. On pro. ceeding to the spot with his servant Mr. Green found that the man had decampe2. The next morning the grounds were examined, when footmarks were traced about the house and garden, and several spots of blood being found it is b-lieved that the shot took effect.

Lord John Russell devoted tbe greater part of the day to a careful inspection of the saloons, containing the works of the ancient masters and did not quit the building till late in the afternoon.

The Exhibition is now getting into thoroughly good worldng order, andthe-internal arrangements connected with the orchestra,. refreshment departmnent, sale of catalogues, and all the little sundries which so much contribute to the comfort of the visitor, are admirably organized, and give the greatest satisfaction. The new catalogue is progressing fast towards completion, and the copies of tie old one are nearly all sold of, so that the visitors of next week will in this respect possess considerable advantage over the early comers. Several imnportant contri. butlons to the works of art have also been reoeived, whilethe applications for permissionto exhibitpour In from every quarter.

Up to the present no day has been fixed for the visit of Her Majesty, but the belief is still that it will take place towards the close of July. We believe we are correct in stating that during the Royal visit Her Majesty will not remain at Trentharm, but at Woraley, the seat of the Earl of Ellesmere. From this fine mansion easy access is gained by the Bridgewater Canal, which pases through the park, to the Patricroft station on the Liverpoot and Manchester Rallway_distant about six miles from the Art Treasures Exhibition. The preParations are already maldng at the Hall to receive Her Majesty. The visit wil be quite of a private character.

LORD NAPiER'S SPrEOH DT NEW YoRu.-The speech of the new British Minister at the St. George's dinner seems to have created a generally favourable Lmpression. It is regarded as a frankand satisfactory exposi ieon of the policy which is for the future to gtide the Government of Great Britain in its rela:ions with this oountr' and it is remarkable for the care which is taken to avoid wounding even by a phraEs the susceptibilities of the Anerican people. Both in matter andmanneritisjust such a speech as was to be expected froma Ministerof Lord Napier's popular tendencies, backed by the liberal character of his instructions. Or these it may be said that no envoy ha ever before been accredited by Great Britain to another Government to whose discretion and Prudence more has been confided than to Lord Napier. EE is indebted for this latitude of powers of oourse more to the political neoessities of his mission than to his own merits, but the fact of a diplomatist as yonDg ashe is being selecte to exercise it is in itself the highest compliment vwhich could be paid him. Thus far his conduct sinoe his arrival in this country hu folly justified the choice that has been made. In his personal relations with al classes Lord Wapier has won general esteem by the simplicity and affability of his manners. Until this dinner, however, we have ha4 no fair opportunity of judging of his political abilities, or of the full measure of his instructions. ntis gratifying to find that neither disappoint the just expectations of the American people, and that we have(among us a British Minister whose want of judgment or temper 1s not likely to throw obetacles in the way of the newr and enlightened policy which Great Britain appea determined to carry out towards this country. The two principal points made by Lord Napier in his eech cover all the grounds on which apprehension existed s to the character of the new relations which it is the object of Lord Palmerston to establish between the two countries. In the face Gf the repugnance which the American people entertain to entangling alliances it became necery for the new Minister to find some phrase which would deserbe accurately the intimate friendship which it is his mision to promote without involving ties of a mole formal and emb sSin nature. The word "1 co-operation," which he so haP il7 hit upon, conveys a meaning which, while it dmpics omething more than a mere cordial underanding yet leaves fuU liberty of action to those between whom it exists. Such co-operation it all that s really great anel noble-in all that is calculated opromoteSne liberties and happiness of mankind-the American people wrill be glad to give. In such a bond of mutual good feeling and support the two grestrepresentative nations of the Auglo-Saxonsrace can pursue easily the same path. The aims which they will have in oommon will exclude all grounds for selfish vrews and jealousies. If this be the meaning which Lord Napier and his Government attach to the<word " co-operation," then we can promise them, on the part of the American people, that they shall have no cause to reget seeking our aid for such objects and in such A spirit. Thefeature, hoever, in this speech which will afford the moat nnqualifled gratification both here and in England is the recognition which it makes of the poicy of the p'inciple first enunciated in Parliament by Mr. Dis. ael-that it is for the interest of Great Britain that the people of this oountry should extend their dominion as far as possible over this continent. The expansion of the United States is one of the most powerful agents of the developement of British eommerce, and Lor Napier only speaks the sentiniets of his counttrymen generally whnen he expressesin another form this ap'horism. The conviction of its truth has, it must be admitted, forced itself rather late on the minds of British satesmen; but, tardy as is its recognition, it cannot fail to be attended with the happiest results to the peace and well-being of the world. In the face of such a conviction and recognaled poliey there is no longer any fear th4t questions of mere ternitorial misunderstanding or ihat bugbear, the political equilibrium of States, will lead to any serious difficulty between the two countries. While Great Britain feels that ber own interests lie iix the extension of her conquests in Asi, she now virtually acknowledges by the mouth of ber representative that to us belongs the futuro supremacy of this continent. *With such bates.for an understnding Ahep is butlittledoubt thqtthe;missionof Lord Napier i be an emeiently l'Qntstul one,-if riork Hora

ADSLPRI T",ATRB The new drama entitled Joeph Chavig7ny preehts one of those are cases in which the critic may conscientiosly take part with the author against the public. Generally the public is diatinguished by the vast capacity of its swallow1, and its buct conueors would advise it not to gulp do&too much. In this paticular case, however, the amophagi is unuually a unreasonably contracted, and the audienoe of the Adelphi Theatre may fairly be reproached by the dramatist for - testifying so little gratifeation, wrhen lie }as laboured much and displayed a degree of talent seldom to befoundcinthedrmasofthepresentday. The drama in question is the work of Mr. Watts Philipe a novice to the stge, and ir,'we believe, original quovs4 it. dranatic form, although a suggestive tale to which it owee Its exitenoe is to be found, no doubt, in the French 1anguage Whatever may be the souree of the plot, the diaogue sperkles throughout with original writing, ana in2; the development of his prinoipal charackr trte author he gone towork lwith singularcare and concientiousneea He lia selected a sort of B1obert Macair-a man driven to crime by the temptations of poverty, and has endowed this personag with a reflective faculty that makes of him a sort of wim Mephistopheles in addition to his vocation of unredeemed rascality. It is hard to say whether honest Joseph is msid; instructive when he commits a villany himslf, or when he,' gbel de-ants on the villanies that prosper around him. Thathemeinybethoroughlyuderstooasndappre~dated,evera. ide of his character is presented tothe audience, audhe is even sbjectId to a species of vivisection, that his pecu- liarities may be fully exposed. -- Nineteen years before the play begins Joseph Chadgnyhas, in the opinion of the world, committed smicideto escap* confinement in the galleys. An old s2hoolfelloW, Who bar had the care of his daughter, andas lost his own child, -ae - substituted the living for the dead, and bh aquired a spendid position on the ground of the supposed patermity.. ho so great a man at Fontensy as hI. de Varennes (Mr. Garden)? In youth, when his -name was -simply Lgn and he was a humble banker's clerk, he greatly offendod the family, of the -De Varennes by marrving a female scion of that illustrious hou;- bhut then, when the head of the house saw the lovelr httle daughter, his heart was touched; he mado her his sole legatee; and sice that time allhasbeen happy anl proserous. - Ligny has adiopted the name of hisi wife'a famiiy, and Madeline (Madaine Celeste), his supoed daughter, now grown up, is about to mey Count=a de GrandmesnUil(r Bi.ington), oneofthemost istocrast personages in France. Notbing can look more felicitoust, when a grim-looking individual makes his appesrano., and wants to talk "on particular. busine" with, x deVarennes. He is dressed as a chasseur, the hair of his beard is long, the hair of his head is short, and it im difficult to recognize Mr. Benjamin Webster through the villanous -exwtrnals, As the reader may have guessed Joseph Chavigny has come back again, not drowned at ILl but fully prepared to denounce the banker as guilty of criminalfraud, unle he is silenced with a good -rouncd sum. The second title of the pieoe is Unnder the Tiumb, and the respectble De Varennes is completely under the thumb of the vagabond Chavigny. But when we follow Joseph to his haunt in the " Glen of -Loup-nolr," we find' that be, in his turn, is under the thumb of a burly,unintellectualscoundrel,namedRequin (Mr. Paul Bedford), whocindeliver him up to justice at a moment's notioe. Under thes circumstances Joseph reflects and scoff;, but we have resently a gentle hint that there is a spark of ood in his uncomely nature, His daughter Madeline brings him 5,0001. rom her suppositious father &a the price of his taciturnity, and though he is at first inclined to pocket the money without handing over a certain compromiun documnent, lie soon relents, observes that his daughter is like her mother, and is even anxious 'that she should pray for him. When the young lady ha departed every feel. ing is extingihed but that of exultation at thec - new acquisition of property, Requin must be got rid of, so an anonymous letter is written to the Mayor, pointing out the haunt of certain maauders who have alarmed the neighbourhood, and by the tima the gens d'arme have retched the designated spot Joseph -has escaped, leaving Requinto bear tle brunt of theattack. However, Requin, thick-headed asse lock% is much sharper than Joseph supposes. e has seen his 'cute friend counting his bknotes, and has quietly abstracted them, so that when Joseph imaginis he has reached the enlhinating point of prosperit he suddenly discovers that an empty pocket-book oonsatttes hisolo wealth. Under the renewed pressure of poverty he agsn iuvades the home of De Varennes, but euin has gone thither, too, and the two scoundrels benefit society by assassinating esch other. As we xave sid already, the character of Joseph Chavigny is made a velhiclo for a sort of eynical wit, to which his adventures furnish the occasion. As we bave not said, this character is the vehicle of some -very fine acting on the part of Mr. Webster, who, utterly demolishlng his own. 2dentity, goes through all the varieties of cynicism, ferocity, cupidity, remorse, anid despair with surprisilg truthfulness. The manner in which he snatches the banknotes from the hand of his daughter, theb hungry look with which he survues them, the animal covetousness with which he throws his whole body on one that has dropped, lest it should be snatched away, is in. itself a little episode ibat will probably be remembeed lon after the "run" of the piece ba reahed it tesmination Madame Celeste, though her character is decidedly abordinate to that of Chavigny, grestly exerts herelf to su- taIn the interest of the story, taming down the viciou pro-.- rersities of the hopeless- father, and generally rulingas a benign spirit over t'he rt of the s'matu pevoxr.

The lYord, of Bruszels, contains the following CtWiQus letter from Paris:- "At the vist of the Emperor, the Einpres and the Grand Duke Constantine to Vileneave PEtang t.he amuseZuentswero various. First, thero were promenades on laud and water, a military concert, and the performsacsa of the leamod dop and monkeys from the Cirque Napoleon. After this, their aeties d their guests laying aside etiquette, began platin ke chlden on a hoyday. A steep mound 6as taken 3,Oscssior of by the ladies, and they undertook -o defend it as a fortress agaminst the gentlemen, the Em- saoting a Commander-a.Chief of the fair varriors. noegentlomen, on their side, in order to make the coddiot somewhat equal, mae their attack -whilo hopping on one leg. The atfenca was very determined, and in the course of it the strategical dispositions and bravery of the Countesm Prezdzewka, a oltarming Pole, who acted as aide-de-camp to theEmpreas, were greatly admired. The Graud Duke Constantine attacked the euemy boldly in front, but was repulsed - he repeated bis attempt with impetuosit, but still without succeses The Emperor manwzuvred kilfull, and actualy succeeded in penetrating into tho very midst of the enemy, bat unfortunately was then made rxsoner. At last the imic contestterminated, a1 parties being wearied as much by laughter as by their exploit. Foort races followed, aud then came a game at pIson-bam In the course of this last-named game the Impress wan taken prisoner, and all tho Russians of her camp vere, with one exception, successively captured and sbared her captivity. The exception was Prince Oathtomaki, and be, after a while, succeeded in delivering Her Majesty. Gratitude, it must be stated, increased his energy, he aving previously been taken prisoner, and the Empress having rescued him from bondage. T}as charming Mte was maried throughout with the greatest gaiety and cordiality. The Grand Duke Constantine appeared delighted with its crv and laisser-aller, which were sopecularly French." The Nord has probably been mystified by come wag, who wished to amuse the public at the expenze of the Imperial Court, or the Nord is angry that the Russian alliance is a failure. Some supct the letter to be a satire and the pamage where the Emperor is aid to have " manceuvred skilfully, and actually succeeded In penetrating into the very midst of the enemy, but unfortunaely was there made prisoner," is thought to refer to the alleged tackings between England and Rus3ia; and as shadowing forth the usual consequencesof awaveringpolicy. Who the "learned dogs of the Cbque Napoleon" are it is difficult to guess, unless from their known docility we may suppose it to be a hit at the Legislative hambers. No doubt, it is a rehef to throw off etiquette and courtly state, but between the easy relaxation of unceremonious intercourse and the curious sports mentioned by the Nord there is much difference. None oftheparty whomtheNord maliciously holdaup to derision as of an age which such exercises would become. Fancy the Emperor, accompanied by such liigh and dignifiedfunctionaries asthePresidentof the Senate and Court of Cassation, and the President of the Council of State or grave Marshals, each with his 60 odd years and his 20 stone, onahot day, 6"hopping on one leg" up the mamelon of Villeneuve 'Etang to attack the position occupied by the ladies, who, it is to be presumed, were allowved the use of two I There is a:characterof rusticity in these successivo attacks and defence, this dislodging and retaking, and this capture and release of the Empress and her Russians, which is anything but courtly. We have allheard of the rural amusements of Marie Antoinette, of the cdlets and the bergeries, and the devices of the Trianon. They were, perhaps, childish enough, but there was nothing coarse or teding to excite ridicule in them. We have also read of a Spanish Ambassador discovering Henry IV. walking on all fours in his apartment, with one of his children on his back; but ridicule was disarmed by the simple question as to whether his Excellency was a father ? The object of the Nord is evident. It hoped to rase a laugh at the French Court by representing its private amusements aa of a-very undignified character, and probably to excite an ill-feeling among the destitute classes of Paris at the too great disregard to apRearances implied in all this " hoppilg on one leg, &c. When the Nord gives such a description of the amusements of the cream of the French Court, in presence of the Grand Duke Constantine and his uiite, it may be certain either that it has been imposed upon, or that it has knowingly libelled the Imperial party at Villeneuve rEtang. The Nord d6eerves to be put on half-rations (at least) by its friends of the Tuileries, for its inventions about rompers, Imperial Princes, great Miniters, and military chiefs hopping on one leg like mountsbank3 at a fair. The Grand Duke may hop, but he minds the main point. He will not neglect to take home with him complete information of the state of France, military and politicaL The Nord was seized at the post-office yesterday for the "libel " about the Emiperor, Empress, and Court just alluded to, A letter from Palermo announces that the Duke and Duchess d'Aumale gave on the 7th a farewell ball to the glite of the citizens. Nothing could be more exemplary, more unassuming, more friendly, and yet more dignified, than the demeanour of the Duke and Duchess during their stay there. The private letters are eloquent in their praises of them. Father Ventura, brother of the priest of the aame name, who scourged magniflcent sinners here during Lent, preached the Lent sermons at Palermo also. The coincidence is curious. The Father Ventura of Palermo had apparently no high scandals to thunder against, as his exhortations were of quite an opposite dec ription. The Emperor and Empress, accompanied by the Grand Duke Constantine and a numerous suite, left Paris for Fontainebleau at 1 o'clock this afternoon. They travelled by a special train, prepared for them by the Paris and Lyons Railway Company. The Grand Duke will return to Paris on the 14th, and the next day will assist at a dinner to be given by the Russian Ambassador, to which the Ministers and the Corps Diplomatique are invited. The departure of the Grand Duke from Paris is fixed for Saturday the 16th. He will arrive at Creuzot on the 17th, and return to Paris the 18th, when he will leave auain directly for Bordeaux. He will arrive at Roche&rt on the 20th, and on the 21st he will visit Indret, on the 23d L'Orient, on the 24th Brest, on the 28th Cherbourg, and Osborne, in the Isle of Wight, on the 80th. Two delegates from Newfoundland, who were sent to London on the subject of the convention concluded with the French Government regulating the right to fish on the banks of Newfoundland, have arrived in Paris and are to be presented by Lord Cowley to Count Walewki.b It is said that a number of promotions in the Legion of Honour are to be made in favour of the Russlnu Generals and officers in Paris and the suita of the Grand Duke. General Todtleben will, it is said, be named a Grand OffMcer. It is proposed by the French Government to send a certain number of military attac7Ms to their various embassies, as is the practice of Eeveral other European Powers. General de Goyon, who commands the French troops at Rome, had been requested by the Pope to inspect the Pontifical troops. The General has executed his mission, and Was presented a long re- port to His Holiness on the subject. General de oyon has sent a copy of his report to the French Government, from which it would appear that the organzation of the Papal troops is in every respect excellent. The Spanish Government has announced its intention to despatch two ships of war to the China Seas, with an agent specially charged to conclude a treaty of commerce with the Celestal Empire as soon as the situation of the eountry will permit it. Ilad week was more favourable for trade in Paris than any of the preceding weeks of this year. Some foreign commission agents apDcared in the niarket and made purchases of Paris manufactures at prices higher than had previously been realized. The Last accounts fromNewyork and Rio deJaneiro announce thatthose markets, which had for a long time been oventocked with French and European produce, are now free to reeive a fresh stock, for which a good dernd has sprung up. The writers oy these communications recommend strongly that no goods shall be shipped from France for those countries unless they are of the best ality. The exportation from France of low-priced and indifferent articles had thrown discredit on French produce in generaL The return of fine weather has dispelled the feeling of uneasiness caused by the late cold winds. Numerous tradesmen have experienced the good effect produced by the change of temperature. The sale of light stuffs and summer clothing has within a few ys become extremely active, and, pxptijoDs being already made by many families X le Paris for the country, increases the demand for Pfliese ~tid. The anufactries most favoured in Xh d;fiaSmneto are those of Boubai, Turcoing, lwbeuf, and in general thosie in which light woollen cu are s~auEacturedX tJio Righk pri@ Qf mlks dresses placing them beyond the reach of the middleclases, The Lyons manufacturers, nevertheless, do not complain. They still rely on their American customers to raeeve them of their stock on hand. All the accounts received from the agricultural. districts awe calculated to remove an S- prehensions as to the safety of the growing crops, somewhat endangered by the excessive cold of the last dayc of April. Appearances lead us to antitipate an abundant harvest both of corn and wine. Zen the mulberry leaves, of such importance in the southern departments, which were becoming yellow under the influence of the cold wind, have now recovered their natural freshness. These aCcounts are the more cheering, as it is universaUy believed that a productive harvest of corn, wine, and silk will have more effect in relieving the existing monetary crisis than all the economical measures which could be suggested. The rise which was noticed in the flour market 15 days since has not been maintained. Flour of the best quality. which had risen to 75f. the sack of 357 kilo. grammues, wm sold last week at 73f. 50oc., and subsequently at 72 francs. The bakers imit their purchases, and the millers are force4 to abate their pretensions in order to make sales. Wheat has maintained its price better than flour. Good quality, of the weight of 120 kilogrammes, was firm at the last Paris marlket at 42f. and 43f. Some very fine samples of wheat from the Sarthe were offered at 45f., but could not find buyers. Accounts from the corn markets in the, departments announce great firmness in the price of wheat at the beginnTing of last week, but a decline at the end. Letters from Marseiles state that the corn-marketis particularlyactiveincousequenceiofthe demand for Spain, to which 60,000 hectolitres were exported last week. 10,000 hectolitresof Azoff weNe sold at Marseilles for delivery at 27f. 50c. the hectolitre, and 16,000 hectolitres from the Danube at 26f. Fine wheat it is said is rapidly dimppearing in that market to supply the home consumption, the bakers having but a small stock of flour on hand.I The price of wheat had likewi&e risen at Algiers, in consequence of the accounts from France. At Bayonne the stock of wheat is so great that. the public and private stores are not sufficient to hold it. The Prefect, having been apprised of this fact, had, by a telegraphic despatch, autho;1zed the merchants to store the remainder in the buiidings of the ancient Lazaretto. A letter from Alais, in theGard, mentions that silkworms of the Chinese breed are being now bred in that town. Ono peculiarity of this race is that they cast their skin in half the time of the French or Italian ilkworm. As it is during this pertod the silk.worm Is generally attacked withdisease, there is a manifest advantage in ropagating the Chinese silkworm. The Yiinister of War has on account of the Govermnent purchased a considerable quantity of Chinese eggs on paper to send to Aiers, to be placed at the disposal Df the Governor-General for distribution. The Society of Acclimatization in Paris has made a oonailerable purchase of the Chinese eggs. Great anxiety prevails in the wine-growing districts to ascertain the amount of injury causedby thelate frosts. The lamage yet done is insignificant, but another month must elapse before a corret judgment can be formed an the forthcoming vintage. The unfavourable reports current, though unfounded, were sufficient to raise the p rice of wine at BerfGy, although vast ujuantitiea have arrved there by the O)rleans and Lyons Railwrays. There is but little doing in spirits. Languedoc is quoted at 230f,, and beetroot at 1251, the hectolitre. The following is the text of the bil for prolonging the privilege of the Bank of France- " Art. 1.

(FrxM O1JR OWN CORRtOrND lT.) VIENNA, MAY 9. On the 3d instant the Emperor sanctioned the revised statutes of the Hungarian CcAcademy of Sciences," and at the same tiime took the institution under his especial protection. " It will be the task of the Academy," says the Imperial rescript, " to cultivate and disseminate learning and literature, and at the same time to develope and enrich the Hungarian language." The society, which is to consist of a president, vice-president, 24 members of the council, 42 ordinary members and an unlimited number of corresponding members, will not be ,ermitted to occupy itself with theological matters. The mention of their language will produce an agreeable impression on the Hungarians, but they probably expect to receive some more subtantia benefit from their Sovertitn the apr- ission to cultivate their moev tongue. -Hungarin -language is now so generaUy spoken at Pesth that there must be k tacit agreement be. tween the Mgyaxe neter to converse withl each other in German. During the last day or two meve. ral persons of my acquannce have retuned from the Hungaran capita nd they are one.and ai of opinion that their Majesties were somewhat 'coolly received on their arrival. As has been said; consderable enthusiasm 17as meaifested when the Emperor and Empress drove to the National Theatre; but it was exclusively confined to the lower classe When their Majesties went to see the two steamers launched they paesed through a double row, formed by the 2,600 men who ae employed ia the docks of the Danubian Steam Navigation Company. Instead of the vessela being named by the Empress, as would probably have beea the case in any other country, " the holy ceremony of baptism was performed by his Eminence the Cardinal Primate of Hungary, who was assised by several bishops." At the theatrical representation on the 7th the Hungarians thus man*aged to display their national colours by placing in front of the seats occupied by the Emperor, Empress, and Archduchess Hildegarde (the wife of the Governor-General), three immense bills of the play, of red, white, and. green silk. After the official reception given to their Majesties on their entrance into the theatre not a hand was moved until towards the end of the opera, when a passage in which the King is described, as the father of his people led to loud and prolonged cheering. After the theatre there was a Court ball, to which all the notables of Pesth were invited. During yesterday morning many audiences were granted, and in the course of the day their Majesties visited several of the public institutions of the city. Several of ,the Hungarian nobles have quitted PeBth, and are .gone to their estates, to make the necessary preuarations for the reception of the illustrious travellers. Baron B.-, a member of the "Arciere Guard,' wrho appeared to be in excellent health and spirits .when -r saw him at Peah four days ago, drowned hinself in the Danube on the 6th )During the manceuvres on the RakoschField thehorse of the Colonel of a cavalry regiment fell with him, and broke his arm. A Paris correspondent of the Augs&urg GazeUe states that Baron Huibner "is add" to have specified to Count Walewski the demands which his Government is inclined to make on Sardinia. The Imperial Cabinet is content to leave Count Cavour entirely out of the question, but it is of opinion that the Minister of ths Interior (Ratazzi) and the Minister of Public Education (Lknza) must be dismissed, "'as it is those two statesmen who permit, if they do not encourage, that part of the pres-which iq in the hands of the refugees to commit such excesses." No information has reached me which could justifymygiving a positive contradiction to the foregoing, but xay common hense tel] me that the 4ustrian Government is not -likely to make de,ads on Sardinia which that Power would be sure to reject. On the 18th of March an "a dditional conventioun to the treaty of July 18, 1853, which relates to the mutual surrender of criminals, was concluded between Austria and Belgium. I;. is now agreed between the high contracting Powers that " the attempt to aswainate, murder, or poison a foreign Sovereign, or any of the members of his f4mily, ~hsll not be considered a political offence.". AS such an attempt would be felony, the person guilty of it will be surrendered to the authorities of the country in which the crime has been committed It is rumoured that the King of Prussia intends to go tolome in the autumn, " aa he is desirous of having some private and confidential conversation viith a His:oliness the Pope." His Majesty is said tb have scruples of conscience on matters of religion, and his enemies insinuate that he fancies no one can so effectually remove them aa the head of the Romma. Catholic Church. A learned German, when speaking inEnglishoffisPnisajMaj.sty, observed t at a manii of such a romantic character, andiwith such " medhieval" tendencies, was even cap able of abdicating and embracing the Roman Catholic faith. The last number of the official Rusia Morsia vornik contsins three long articles on the river Asnoor and the countries through which it lows, a a very good; map of the river and west coast of the Gulf of Tartary. Three degrees lower than Castries Bay, which is in 51 32 north latitude, there is a Russian military station,ca1led XonstantinoffE3, at a port bearing the name of Emperor's Harbour. AL hour or two before their Majesties went on board the steamer which took tbem to Pestb, Mr. Murphy the Irish giant, had the honour of Sbing admitted to their premence. The Empress conversed in English with Murphy, and acted as interpretress for the Emperor, wrho understands but little of the language. The giant, who was born in the countyof Down, stands 7 feet 10J inches in his stoclkings, and probably produces the same effect on the persons who visit him a the Patagonians did on Magellan's sailors when they first got sight of them. A middle-sized man can stand with his hat on under Murphy's extnded arm. . It is probable that the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian will meet the Pope at Ancona or Ferrara towgards the middle of the month. RUSSIA. (nRO ann OUR ui B onRUPoNDXqT.) BERLIN, M&Y 10. The birthday of the Emperor (April 29), in putting a. stop as it did to all business, prevented the remainder of the Rusian railway shares from being subscribed for; the subcriptions of the previous day had, as we are informed, bespoken at least 50,000, or a third of the whole number allotted to Russia. One statement says that 100,000 were taken the first day, but this amount seems to have been arrived at by a species of free and easy arithmetic which adds together all the orders that possibly were sent up to the capital from the pro. vinces and all the subscriptions that are reported to have been made on the spot. It is mentioned that several subscriptions for smaller amounts had been made, but no great expectations were entertained hat any largetotal would be thus attained, seeing that the middle Cla&ses possessed of the means of speculating in railroads are not very numerous. there is no doubt, however, that, sooner or later, by hook or by crook, these 150,000 shares reserved for Russia will all find purchasers The Court removed to Tzarskoe-selo at the begin. Ding of this month, and will remain there during the confinement of the Empress; when this period is happily over the Empress will travel for a short time abroad, but the Imperial children. will stay, as usual, at Hapsal for the benefit of se-bathing. The Grand Duke Nicholas, who is General Ih. spector of Engineering Works and Fortifications, has taken up his residence for the present at the Belvedere Palace at Warsaw. His Assistan General Daehn, by whom the citadel at Warsawr and the fortress at Ivangorod were built, preceded him to the Polish capital by a few days. Advices from the Caucasus mention that five gunboats for the Azoff Cossack, have been launched on the river Kwiril, in Wardzichoe, and, after being conveyed in safety past the falls of the Raiom, were navigated to the mouth of the river Toheni Tchale. They have beenl built after the designs of Vice-Admiral von Schauz, wFhich have already farmed the pattern for vessls which have given every satisfaction in the Baltio. Thegnuns which they casry at pesent are in conformity with the pacific services they aro to be called upon to fulfil, and consist only of three-poiuders (falconets) ; but in case of their being concentrated for war purposes they can be mounted with guns of larger calibre. Their service at present is to be confined to protecting the military posts stationed along the river and the passenger and goodcs trafEc on it. ThE POPE. The G6iorwle di Romas of the 6th states that the Pope arrived at Civita Castellana on the 4th, and on the following morning went to the cathedral on foot to say mass before his departure. During the ceremony he distributed the Eucharist to all the municipal authorities and to many of the other inhabitants. At Magliano, Otricohl, and Nani he alsovisited the cathedrals,and gave hisbenedictionto the people. At Terni he visited the lage foundry of that place, where several medals with the effigies of the Saviour, the Virgin, and the Apostles Peter and Paul were cast in his presene. When abeut to leave tbat place, some young men of the best families offered to take the horses off his carriage and to drawit, but t}ishe would notallowv. The streets through which he passed were every- where strewn with flowers. At Spoleto ftiumphal arches had been erected, and before the cathedral stood a large wooden column surmouned bythe statue of the Immaculate Virgin. The town as illuminated when he arrived. 'On. alighthig heproceeded on foot to the caheal, and thenee to the episcopal palace, where he admitted all the authori- ties to. the honour of kisoing his. ipW OnthV.. following morning the Pope said 3mas in the cathedral, and then set out for E uligno, wh9 he was reIceived 'with similar honours. This Pontifical journey, ostensibly undertaken more aa a pilgrimage to certain shrines than from any political or personal motive, naturaly gives ris to many conflicting aspirations-the hopes of some, the fears of others Those who bave been able to hold His Holinews in leading-strings for the lIat eight years are alarmed lest his sensitive disposition and amiable feelings shoTld be so strongly excited by what he may see and hear in his progress as to weaken their own power over him, while the people of the provinces through which he is to nPass cherish a hope that their Sovereign may be stimulated to energy on their behalf by a personal observation of the oorruptions of his Government. At Bologna and at other towns in the Romagna the municipalities have resolved on addressing the Sovereign m the same manly tone adopted by them in their petitions last summer, but which possibly never -eached his hand. Very much good might be anticipated from such frank expositions of the state of the country if one did not know, from repeated experience, that the Pope, who. ever he may be, must be utterly powrerless to redress the evils complained, of, anda that whatever good intentions his present Holiness may form While away from the Sacred Council will be effectually nullified as soon as he returns to the Vatican. The people of the Romagna, however, have resolved on doing their duty, by seizing every opportunity for making legal remondtrances against the injUstiCe of their Government; and the Euroean public -will thus be enabled to judge whether it is the Government or the people of the Roman States that is incorrigible. SAIWDNlA. (nox oun oWNr COBRmoDMXT.) TURDQ, M&Y S. The Chamber of Deputies at length divided today on the Bil for the removal of the naval arsenal from Genoa to Spezzis, after 11 days' debating on the subject, and ended by voting it by a majority of 42, the numbers bemg 94 in favour and 52 gasnst it. This min6rity was considerably greater than had been anticipated, and cannot be attributed to the members of the Right and Left only, asmanr of the Left are known tohave voted favourably on the separate clauses, and the Right does not muster more than about 15 votes altogether. Some 15 or 20 votes must have been given, therefore, by those who are usually reckoned as supporters of the Government, but who were probably alarmed at the prospect'of incurring a heavy extra expenditure at this moment, when the agricultural reports are by no means satisfactory. Some depaties of Genoa proposed yesterday an additional article to the Bill, to the effect that in the law-itself provision shouia be made for the construction of a commercial dock at Genoa. Count Cavour accepted the principle of the proposition, but suggested its being referred to the Commission on the Bi, sO that the question might not be prejudiced by it in any way, and, this having been agreed to by al parties, the Commision to-day proposed that the Government should promise to introdut-e at the commaencement of next sesion a measure for the 'const,ruction of commercial docks, graving docks,' warehousea, &rc., on the site of the present Darsena at Genoa, for the use of the mercantile navy Count Cavour also announced to-day, that in the course of next week the Bil for the tannelling of ,Mont Cenis would be presented to the Chamber, and that the Government would at the same time ask the House to renew the permission to contribate 10,000,OOf. to the Luckmanier Railway. This railway is of the greatest importance for the trade ,of Genoa, because it would facilitate a great commerce with the Lake of Constance and Central Germany, and enable Genoa to competo-with Trieste. Count Cavour added, that he had the more hope niow of the completion of this undertaking, since the Swiss railway from the Lake of Constauce was patronized by the house of Rothschild. The Austrian Government haa been particularly accommodating ab,ut p ports this yea for Lombardst coming to the festival of the "Statuto" at Turiu -and thie consequence is that we are likely to have a better attendance than usual, even at this annual demonstration, for, besidesfLombrds, itis said that many are coning from otherpartsof Italy, and there is already a goodly number of foreigners in the hotels, who have, no dbubt, bee arested their progress northward by the chance offering itself of witnesmig this'celebtlon. Letters from Milan concur in giving very amusing descriptions of the lavish expenditure and mavellous taste of the new Governor-GeneraL Since his Imperial Highnesss arrival in the Lombard capital he appears to have devoted much attention to domestic arrangements, which manifests itself to the public in grotesque liveries and extraordiinary equipa, and those who either willingly or unwillingly have been to his little Court relate stories of his prodigal hospitality that ought to make the mouths of outer barbarins water with envy, whiler they certainly open tbem with laughter by the accounts they give of the ultrasublime inagnificence in the interior of -the Palace. The Archduke was most probably well advised -that his principal duties as Governor-General would bos to amuse and keep in good humout the people over whom he was appointed tioinal ruler, and he seems to have even gone beyond his instruotion, for he has excited universal mirth ever since he has been in Milan. The Duchess of Orleans, with her sons, the Comte de Paris and the Due de Chartres, is expected in Turin to-day. She is on her way from Genoa to England, and has come here expressly to thank King Victor Emmanauel, it is said, for the hospitality received by her in his dominions. There was an unfounded rumour 'afloat that the Dachess had been obliged to leave the Sardinln States in consequence 1 of a demand made by the French Government on the Government here, and probably her Royal Highness thought this the most effective way of giving a distinct contradiction to subh reports For 1 the rest, the French Government has never made any difficulty about the Orieans family coming to Piedmont, and certainly the Sardinian Government never thought of requiring the Duchess to leave its territories.- SPAIN. (FROMs on OWN coRnowNDMrr.) EADRID, MAv 7. With reference to the account I yesterday gave you of the intrigue discovered by Queen Christina for the fusion of the two lines of Spanish Bourbons, I have a few words to add. The affair is a curious illustration of " things in Spain," and at first may appear almost incredible to foreigners, but there can be no doubt of the correctness of the main facts I commumicated to you. The participation of the King in a plan to make his own wife abdicate will doubtless seem the most inconceivable part of the business, but it is perfectly explicable. His mother, the Princess Carota, was the chief mover of Ferdinand VLL to annul the Salie law. It was she who, 'when he repented of having done so, burnt the new will he made, and prevailed on him to resume his former intention. Seized with remorsb before her death, she left a letter to her children, adjuring them in the most solemn and im- pressive terms, and as they regarded the repose of her soul, to do all in their pzower to re- pair the. evil she had done. This letter and other documents were delivered to the present Kinou Consort in the year 18S6 by the Cardinal Arohbbshop of Toledo, lately deceased. The impression it made on the feeble and bigoted mind of Don Francisco de Ais was strong and Lasting, and to it may be traced his participation in the recent plot. The intenton of the plotters was, 1st, to bring about the union of the two branches of the family; 2, to get the Queen to abdicate; and, 3, to ma tty the Princess of thtArias to a son of Don Juan, the brother of the Count de Montemolin. The means referred to in the Sing's letters, by the employment of which he confidently expected to make the Queen abdicate, are certain letters relating to the birth of the Princess of the Asturias, which he is said, and generally believed, to have in his possession, and to have employed more than once as an instranment of intimidation to obtain his wife's consent to objects of his own. Although the particulars of the plot discovered, and of the circumnstances to which its discovery gave rise in Madrid, have not yet transpired, rumour begins to busy herself with them, and it was reported here two or three days ago that the King was under arrest. This is not true; that step was not taken, and it was thought advisable to intriidate, not to puniih, the Royal conspirator. It Is well known here that this is not the first time he has mixed himself up in dangerous Carlist plotr. The Three per Cents. were donO at 40.3X; ditto, PcTerred, 26.
MdONEY-MARTaWITYD?TBLrrGRafOZ. Tuesday Evning. The quotation of gold at Psris is about 6 per mile premium, and the short exchange on Lodon .2pDer1l. sterling. StaOndcomparinglthes rates with the n Mint prieo of ab . 170 10hd. per ounce for stndard gold, it appear that gold is nearly 2-lOths per cont. dearer in Paris thli in London. - By advices from Eamburg the prop c of gold is 424 per mark anitheshort exchange on isdon ix a a per 1A, dfterling. Standardgold at the E onglfh MintPprice as therefore about 1-lOth per es nt. dearer in eamburg than in London The courns of exchnge at NewrYork on Londonfor bills at 60 days? sight is 109k per cent., which, whoen compared with the Mint proportions between the two countries, shows that theaexchange is about at par. And, after making allowasnce for charges of transport atn diference of interest, the present ratel leave atriflingaprofit on the importation of gold from the United States. The funds opened this morning with a tendencu to recovery frofo the light reatilon of yetebrdy afternoon, and the market wyas afterwards well sus tained, prices at the close presenting at general appearance of firmness The satislfactory state of tho foreign exchanges, the flatness of the silver marke, nth Ofavourable turn in the weathere the absence of bad accounts of the silkt crop, coninued purchases of :E:xchequer-bilLs for the savings-banks, and the delivery for the first time for many months of s considerable quantity of American specie at the Bank all tended to inspire confidence.

In - the dircount-market and at the Bank to-day there wras aw steady but not a pressing demand. -. DForeign securities were steady, wsith a. moderate alnoiint of business Turldish Six per Cents, for money were negotiated at 93i; ani the Four per Cents. Guaranteed for money at 100k and {. T!he other operations comprisd ,:-Bueno Ayres Six per Cents., 86; MIoxican, for money, 221; Peruvia Four-and-a-Half per Cents., '77; the Three per Cents., 53_; Spanish Three per Cents. New De. ferred, 25; and Spanish Certificates of Coupon, 61 percent. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally were firm, and three months' paper on Paris was sold at higher rates. The fian price of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 69f. 40c. for money, showing another improvement of an eighth. The Paris advices state that the stock of bullion inthe Bank of France has not experienced any very material variation since the publication of the last return on the 9th of April The total was then 9,400,0001., and two or three days back it was about 9,200,000L About 72,0001. of the gold brought by the steamer yesterday from New York has been sold to-day to the Bank of Englandc The reports regarding the silk crop continue to be anxiously watched, but it is stilt too early to form any conclusive opinion of its general prospects. In Spain, which is one of the countries where it is always most forward,. everything has gone well to the present time, and the impresion is that there will be an average supply. This statement is encouraging, since it has been in Spain during the past twvo Ol three years that the disease has first manifested itself. From Naples, where also the, season Is early, there is likewise an absenco of bad tidings and the same maybe sad with regard to tho Levaiit. ]liFrance and lombardy.there are as yetvery few means of judging, and, indeed, in any quarter it Will be at least 10 days or a fortnight before the prevailing uncertainty can be removed. Meanwhile, the silk-market remains stagnant, sellers being URMilling to accept lower prices, and buyers being disosed to place confidence in the afe progress of the crop, while they also attach importance to the more fihan usual extent of preparation that was made this season to insure an increased production. I The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce-markets state that, although business was less active, there was stiU a tendency to improvement. Higher prices had been paid for the best descriptions of coffee, and the operations in , ugar, especially refined, were at a slight advance. ore was great firmness in the quotations for tea nd tobacco, but the transactions were limited. The letters from Rouen mention that the market for manufacturas was quiet, but that it was hoped the lavourable change in the weather would shortly jtimulate purchases. - Mr. Tite, M.P., and Mr. Philip Anstruther havo been appointed chairman and deputy-chairman of She Bank of Egypt. The following letter relates to the influenco likely to be- exercised on our importations of fruit from the East under our present scale of duties, as compared with the rates in the United States' tariff, which will come into operationin July next :- " Sir,-The redaction of the import duty in Ameriea on dried frints from 40 per cent. to 8 per cent. is likely to affect very serionsly our own trade in currants, raisins, and figs, but more especially the latter and mnscatel ralsins, the growers of which are reckoning upon extremely high prices iconsequence of this rediction. - Had thelast Parliament not been dissolved in March, there is no doubt the Chancellor of the Exchequer rould have reduced the duty on currants and figs from 15s. 9d. to lOs, per cwt. nowcharged on raisins. Oathe 16th of March, Inreply to Mr. Ewart, P., hepledgedhimself to reduce tho dtY 'at a more opporitne moment.' At that time there was no knowledge here of the reduction of duty in Americ BEat even a reduction to lOs per cowt. would be insufficient to counteract the effects of the 8 per cent, duty in the United States. The direct trade between Smyrna and America ia figs alono has alreadyexoeeded that between Smya and Great Britain. A movement is being again madein this country to obtain a reduction in duty, and those interested in this important trade are hoping for success if anotber application be made to the Chan ore o e Exchequer." Annexed is a petition to the House of Commons for a reform of the existing superannuation system in the civil service, which is in course of signature among the principal London merchants. A similar document has proceeded from Liverpool, signed by almost every leading merchant, broker, ana shipowner:- "The Humble Petition of the Undersigned, the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, the Bakers, Mterchants, and Traders of the City of London, "Showeth,-That your petitioners have recently had their attention called to the subject of the civil service tuperannuation, with reference to which numerous petitions have been laid before your hon. House irom the civil servants of the Crown, prayg reliet from the operation of the existing law. " That your putitioners, having regard to the evidence before a select committee of your hon. House in 185 on the civil service superannuation question, areof opinion that ihe civil servants of the Crown, as a body, re not so well taidfor their servioes as emploVs of the same grade in commercial and other walks of life, and have not the same Zpportnnitiesof adrancement in society as persona of a simiar standirng in independent situations; thatnone of the prizes of mercantilelife areopen to them; that their limited powrer of ma1ing provisiontfor their support, when worn out in the public service, is ;greatly impaired by the heavy tax ipe on their salaries for providing superannuation penlions; and thai the tas otherwvise entails on the civil sert'ants who have to pay 'iT musch domestic distress. That Snro petitioners believe that the present superannuation tax ,s not only unjustifiable in principle but depressing in its operation, and tends to produce dissatisfaction in the minds of those who pay it, and irapair their ueefulness by d1stratig their attention from their official duties. " That yonr petitioners, in expressng their concurrenoo bith the following resolutions of the seeoct committoe of your bon. House in 1856, ' Tba it is desirable to do away with tbe system by which a portion of the salaries of the civil servants is deducted on account of superannuation allowances ;' and I That the practice of providing supera- iuation pensions for the members of the permanent civil services is based on sound principles of po11cy,' are resetfully of opinion that the time his arrived then it; is desir. able those resolutions should take effect; and with that view your petitioners rspectfully represent to yoar hon. House, that while the cost to tlie country Qf carry ing out those resolutions will be, in a national pont of view, almost inappreciable, speedy legislation on this subject is of the highest importance to put an end to the great excitement which has tor feveral years prevailed throughout the eivilservice on this question, to the prejudice of the proper discharge of the pablic business of this country, whose daily increasing commerce de. mands the best energies of its civil servants, while common justice suggests that men whom lives are maden p of roatine labocar, with limited means and prospect4, should be fairly provided for when no longer able to pursue that rouine. Your petitioners -therefore ray your hon. House to entertain favourably the prayer of the civil servants of tho Crown, as set forth in the numerous petitions presented by thcmn to your hon. Hlouse."

SA VINGS-BANES. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The question whether or not a depositor in a savingsbank should deposit only 1001., 200l., or any other sum, might be well settled by a now provision which would be productive of many advantages. It might be provided that whenever the deposit reached a given sum (say 501.) above a given sum (say 1001.), the oe. cess should be invested in Consols in the depositor's nsme; the savings-bank acting from him in maldng the investment and drawing for him the dividends. There would thus be added to the existing fandholders a lIage cLass interested in upholding national faith and national credit, and a new qualilication for the electoral franchise might thus be estbllhed. Yours obediently, IT. R.

&AILWAY INTELLIGENCE. _ . . SAMBAE D MEIJSE. -ne nalr-yearly meeting of this company *as hold Yedterday at the ofces, Moorgate.street; Mr. W. P. Richards in the chains Mr. CHUm, the secretary, reAd the report, an abstract Of which appeared in The limes of Monday. The CHAIRmAN, in moving the adoption of the report, regetted that there was to subject for congratulation m it. The difficulties in respect to the development of the traffio were not exaggerated on a former occasion, but the measures taken had secured their position. Although they were not doing so well as they could-wish, they were at al events, in a safe position. There was a time when he al=ost despaired of attaining that position* their Eue was then forfeited and their funds were exhausted. They were now in a position of security, and were enabled to pay their p reference charges. Many railways in a worse stae had oen brought into a good position by patience and perseverance. He took some credit to himself for having defehded their resident direct-or in Belgium from some anonymous attacks upon him, because he felt assuwed that Mr. Sheward was well worthy of their confidenco.(Hear.) He(the chairman) had no particular inducement to defend Mr. Sheward from those unjust attacks, for his companionship had been forced upon the board by the shareholders who had eleced hima to. a seat at the board uider circumstancas not complineiitary to the then directors; and he (the chairman), after years of experience of Mr. Sheward's devotion to their interests, congratulated them on the selection they had made.- He had performed his duties in a trustwotrthy, straightforwardi and manly manner, and had exerted considerabIa administrative talents in their behalf. When the al1 leged offer of a guarantee f*om the lNorthern of France Railway had been reported, he proceeded to Paris) and satisfactorily ascertained that there was no intention to offier them any guarantee. Mr. Sheward, while in Paris, was told by Baron de Rothschid, the president of the Northern of France, that they had not offered a guarntee, and that he never would guarantee any other line. So the reports tespecting the directors baving refused to accept a guarantee from the Northern of France Railway were without foundation. None of the directors had anything to do with these reports; they had never bought nor sold a share. With regard totheArdennesoffer of a guanntee, he considered it a mockery from beginning to end. No guarantee had been offered, and of course none could have been refused. It was impossible to deal with such reports, which were evidently circulated for some object. His own opinion was, with respect to the company's affairs, that they would improve, and that it only requ3red patience and unanimiton the part of the shareholders to bring about a satisfactory Mr. EARThIDGE intimated that he would move an amendment. He complained that the anticipations held out by their resident director had not beenrealized, aua contended that the company was now in a worse position than at the last meeting. Be objected to the funds of the com. Cany beng employed in the coal trade, and demanded to ow by what authority the funds had been so applied. The revenue account showed a surplus of 16,0001., after paving the preference charges, but 12,000 . of it was employed in the coal trade. He concluded by moving an amendment to the effect that the report be received, and that three share. holders be appointed a committee to ascertain the nature duties, and emoluments of the resident director in Belgium the position of the coal trade, and to report thereon to the shareholders at a special meeting to be convened for the purpose. His object waA to ascertain in a friendly way whether their affairs could be improved. Many evils that had arisen to railway property were caused by the supineness of ahareholders. With regard to other lines, he would rather go without dividend than supply any further capital'. The CHAu ss explained that the employment of funds in the coal trade had been sanctioned by resolutions of the shareholders, with a vieowto proteettheirinterests from the combination formed against them by the boatowners and coaldealers. By the purchase of the coal at the pit the conveyance of it over the line'and sale of it, they hadearned 7 000. during the past half-year. The profit on the sale of die coal was very small, the chief object was to bring the coal traffic over their line, which would otherwise go by the boats. The sale of coal bad amounted to 40,0001. in 1856, and they had uot made a bad debt, which was very credit able to the managementin Belgium. After soime observations from Mr. Wsi..tsoN, Mr. BELL, Mr. Sco¶TT, and other proprietors, Mr. SHEWvAaD stated that ever since he had been their resident director he had endeavoured to give them the fullestinformation; he had on all occasions stated the trutb the whole truth, and nothing but the trath. He never had' anything to conceal from thue shareholders. He would be de lghted to see the proposed three gentlemen in Belgium and would show them everything in his power. He hA done the best he could for the company, and would be glad to be relieved from the anxiety of the coal trade. It involved him in avast amount of responsibility, without any personal benefit. He could not prevent the furnaces going out of blast, or a falling off in trade. His emolumentg were 600 a-Tyear and a house to reside in, for which he gave the whole of his time and exertions for the benefit of the company. The coal trade had enabled them to earn 7,0001. in the past half-year, which they could not otherwise have ob. tainea. The CEAummR& explained that the meeting could not legally appoint a committee, as the proper notice had not been given; but the directors had no wish to interpose any difficulty, although they considered it an useless. measure. Mr. Scom7 hoped that every facility would be afforded to the committee to enable them to make the necessary inves. ti gtion. The amendment was then put and carried, there being seven for and five against it. Messrs. Marrott, Roemar, andaartridge werg appointe, to act as a committee. Mr. TP.AmmG objected to the expenses of the committa being paid out of the funds of the company, and moved a. resolution to the effect that the expenses of the committee be not paid out of the funds of the company. Mr. UARTRsmGE said he would pay his own expenses. On the motion being put nine were in favour of it^and three against it; the motion was consequently carried. On the motion of Mr. HARTPiDGE, a vote of thanks was passed to the chairmau and directors, and the meeting separated. WEST FL4NDERS. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Monday at the offices, Moorgate-street; Mr. W. P. Richaids in the chair. hr. M. CnAnB, the secretary, read the notice conven the meeting. The report, an abstract of which has -ppeaed in T1e Times, was taken as read. The CzAiRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said that during the past two or three half-year their affairs hbd improved ; they had avoided extravagance in every way, and now they were laced in a satisfactory posi hon. Trade had improved in Belgium since their line had been constructed, ana houses and factories were being built in the distrct through whichit passed. The trafflo had in. creased gradually since 1848, and he could see no reason why it snould not continue to increase for years to come. As the business of the country increased, so must their traffic also increase, and he hoped in the course of a reasonable tmea prosperous state of things wouldexist in West Flanders. The works on the line from Dixmude to Furnes were now going on under a guarantee from the Government, and,as the line would form a junction with their railway, he thought that when it was completed it would tend to inerease the traffic on their line. Tbe mode of charging the working expenses on the guaranteed lines was now under consideration, and he hoped it would be modified, as at present it operated against the interests of the old line and in favonr ot the Goverrment. Mr. HsRAPATH said be was glad to perceive that the traffio had increased considerably since 1848, and in some of the items the receipts had been nearly doubled. On the whole, he considered that their progress had been satisfactory, but, at the same time, they would require a larger dividend to compensate them for their outlay. The report anM statement of accounts were then unanimously adopted, and tho dividend of 3s. 6d. per share for; the half -year was approved. Mr. E. J. HERPATH understood that the 5I per cent. preference sbares would participate in the surplus profits over 5 per cent. on the old shares, and he wished to know what portion of the surplus profits they would be entitled to receive. The CHaiiRa?e explained that, after the old shares had received G per cent., the surplus would be divided rateably between them and the prefcrenco shares. When the old shares were entitled to 56 per cent., the preference shares wouldhave 6 per cent., and so on,inthe proportion of a half per cent. more than the old ones. On the motion of Mr. HIERAPATH, a vote of thanke was passed to the chairman and directors, including Mr. Chubb, the secretary, for their attention to the interests of the company. MANCHESTE1, SHEFFIELD, AND LINCOLNSHIRE. The working expenses and other outgoings of this company's railrways (exclusive of the Manchester, South Junction, and Altrincham, stated below) have amounted in the fortnight ending May 3 to 9,545& 19s. 2d., while the corresponding period of 1856 amounted to 8,9061. lOs. 1d.

Tho defendant Brewsterwas the landlord of the house; and the other defendants were peroson who were present at the ejectinent, but who, as afterwards appeared, took no part in the proceed. ing. It apjeared that in the month of Jnne last the plaintiff wenttoorepade atthehoaein question Plongwvithherda uplter. a M Eades, who had two or three young children. Goods were supplied by various- parties, and Mrs. Eades got considerably ndeb in lthe nueignbourihood. Among other oredi. tors thero was one to whom she owed from 301. to 401. for a brougham ixn which sheand the old lady used to ride. This went on for some time, but eventually Mrs. Eades got into Whitecross-street prison for debt. On the 26th of Se ten. ber tne defendant Brewster went to the honso and toid the parties he meant to remain thee, and that they were to go. He took the locks off the doors and put on new ones, and on the following day he gently handed Mrs Biller ont of the house. On this occasion the various tradesmen who had given credit to Mrs. Eades had aseembled at the house; huetit did not appear that they took any part in the ejectment. When Mis. Eades left for Vhitecross.street, she took her baby along with her, bat, the two other children being left in the house, they were taken care of for several days out of charity, and he then handed them over to an omnibus man named Milsom, who hard acted as agent for the parties ia takilng the housL The defendant remained in posesslon; and as soon as quarter day arrlved he putin a distrems for a quartes rent in arrear. Mr. SereantBA A7 for the ddence said, a gross fraud had been com fitted upon the defendant, Mrs. Eades had been represenk& to himn as a lady of lage pro. perty, and the had pa sed herself off in the neighbourhood as the lIrs. iller who hadtaken the house of the defendant. She had thus been enabled to get credit to a considerable amount, and, not satidfied with leaving her children on the defendant's hande, she had been made use of by some Tar; ties to vex the defendant with several actions, which ut for the verdict of the jury might be his ruin, The learned sereant then called several witnesses, from whose evidenco itappearedthat the old lady and the children had been gently and even kindly dealt with. LOrd CAMPBELL Was about to sum up the evidence, but was stopped by the jury, who said it was unnecessary, as they were of opinion the defendant had not assaulted the plaintiff. Lord CAmPsxLL.--So!far as she is concerned, yon think the defendant treated her with great kindness of heart? The jury mid that was their opinion. They added that the house was taken by fraud. Lord COsAxnLL.-You think it was not the hounse of the plaintiff? The jury said they thought it was not her house, nor her goods. A verdict was then takQn for the defendant. VA,N TOLL V. CHAPIA. Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Doyle appeared for the plain. tiff, and Mr. Hawkins for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action was a young widowv lady, who sued the defec.dant, William Chapman, an attorney at Rilch mond, to recover damages for the loss which she had sustaxnedby%ls negligence whenacting as herattorney. The facts of this case appeared in T4e Times on Monday last, in thereporto f a trial in which the defendant sued the laintiff for the amouiit of his biU of costs, in which it will be remembered the plaintiff failed, upon the grour4id as found by the jur, that his servic were wholly useless, The present was a cross ion inst the attorney, founded OIn the same fact. It appeared that the plaintiff when very young had been mnaried to a Mr. Van ToU in 185L Ber husband had a considerable fortune, but his habits were very extravagant, and in order to protect her interest he was induced to pay a s-um of 1,0001. into the London and Westmiaster Bank to her credit. Ca tai Julius Roberts, of the Royal Marine Artiler, professed to be the plaintiff's friend, and undertook to invest this money for her benefit. The plaintiff accordingly sgned a check in his favour for the 1,000 , bat instead of investing this money Roberts kept the mouey himself, nd to secure the amount he sent her his bond for 2,0001., dtedthe 24th ofXovember, 1852 A portion of the money was repaid, but as the plaintiflost her husband in 1854 she was anxious to recover the balan remaining due. She accordingly in the early part of July, 18655 lsced the matter in the defendant's hands, with inatructions to sue Roberts and get the money. The defendant issued a writ, and when Roberts Wms served therewith he sent the following letter to the plaintiff:- "July1 1555m *-amai,-your proceedngs have rather aetonibed e. iniw ereou f £,050,vr 1at < be So handoovertoso thro.'" Eto,£570. Thi lr.. eeptor the lOul amount, I aln prepared to rhevU th r smhha been received by eymmou.;Rr *-I am, Madm, truly yOurs. Mr Van Toll, The Green, Richmond.' ROB"RTS. This letter was immediately forwarded to the defendant; and the plaintiff's contention now was that as soon as' the defendant was made aware by thit letter that Roberts acknowledged his liability he ought to have 3pplied to a judge underrthe 3d section of the Common Law Procedure Act, 184, and had the iaatter of account at once feferred to the Master. Had that course been taken there were reasonable grounds for believing that the plaintiff might have obtained judgment and execution in a fow weeks, and Eo have got the debt paid. Instead of this the plaintiff's London agent, Mr. George Bildyard, who had charge of the suit, proceeded in the regular course, and delivered a declaration, &c. It was some time before the parties came to issue, for it appeared by the defendant's ball of costs that was put. in evidence that the defendant had on ten several occasions obtained " time to plead." Matters thus went on through the long vacation, till the 14th of December, when the cause was in the paper for trial at GuildhalL After briefs had been delivered to counselit was agreed that the record should be withdrawn, and that it should be referred to the Master to state the accont. The Master, on the 10th of January, 1855, certified that 744/. 2s. 6d. was due to the plaintiff; and ordered that that sum should be paid on the 24th. Roberts, however, paid nothing, and soon after was made a bankrupt, but he had no assets whatever. Evidencewas giventoshowtLt if judgment had been obtained against Roberts inAugust thewhole orae least a portio4 of the defendant's claim might have been satisfied. A person named Tate had brought an action against him on the 25th of June, and Roberts on the 2d of Angust had agreed to a judge's order for the payment of 3941. odd on the 12th of August. Be was marricd on the 15th of August, and being arrested that morning for another debt of 3781. odd his father-in-law paid the amount. It also appeared that he had drawn a sum of 1501. out from se insurance society. I AMr. BAwKn;s called the defendant and his agent, and they both stated that they were not at the time aware of the provsion In the Common Law Procedure Act which had Deen referred to. Captain Roberts also was put into the box, and stated that if he had been pressed for money at the period in question he could not have paid; and that the only chance he had of being able to meet his liabilities was by having time given to him. Be stated that he had been employed by the Government in fitting up gunboats, but, being ordered abroad, he had given up his commission and been allowed to retire on half pay. Lord CAMPBZLL, in summing up the evidence, repeated what he had said on the previous trial that when the deo fendant's liability was admitted, and tihe only matter to be -decidedwaswone of mere account, it was the duty of an attorney to proceed under the third section of the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854 It would therefore be for the *ury to say what damage, if any, tho plaintiff had sustained Iy reason of the defendant's negligence in not adoptingthat Course. The jury retired to consider their verdict, and on their return into court found for the plaintiff damages, 6441. This was the last day of the present sittings in Middlesex. The Court will sit to-morrow (Wednesday) at Guildhall.

A sam of about 1604 was passed into his hands, 1. being in bils drawn upon customers, and the remainder in cash. The officia' assignee having only to pass the bills through tho Bank of Enland, to whom they were paid on presentation, hesBbmitte that they ought not to be classed as debts. There was another item of about tho same amount, which was in this position :-Prior to the bankruptcy the bankrupt had agreed to sel certain stock; that sale had since been completed, and he thought the tranusaction ought to be regarded as a cash transaction. His HoNouyt held that -the cash (304.) was a different thing from the bills. The bils maight or might mot have been paid on presentation. Tho official assignee had some. times much trouble in such cases and no remdneration, and he was not to be deprived of the full percentage, because the bills in this case were paid on presontation. The bills must beoregareda a debt. Molegal sale of the stock having been compltedathe official assignee wotid be entitled to his percentage upon that trantcti6oa as one of property. Rx B J. BISOP.

The prisoner entered his servioe in the niame of Sarah Knowles, and gave a reference to a Greek lady aimed Mavrocordato, with whom she lived a month, but had no. tice to quit. Francis Devenish stated, that on the 3d of February he was butler to Mr. Tulloh,and he hid tome from Scotland to give his evidence.

POLICE. MANSION-.OUSE.-Samuel Wright, Mary Donovan, John l3radley, and Samuel Thorn, charged, the two former with taaving stolen a large number of sacks, the property of their employer, Mr. Jamieson, sailcloth factor and sack inerchant, the two latter with having received the property knowing that it had been stolen, were brought before the LORD MAYOR for further examination. His Lordship was for a considerable time eDgaged in hearing evidence from new -witnesses, as well as in hearing additional evidence from the witnesses previously examined, brought forward to connect the various details of this remarkable and extensive 8ystem of plunder, which was alleged to have been carried on in the premises of the prosecutor. Upon the application of Mr. leois, jun., the solicitor for the prosecution, James Down. ing, who had been examined as a witness at a former stage of the proceedings, was placed at the bar and charged as an nccomnplice, and the case waS adjourned to Wednesday, the 20th inst. MARLEOROsUOH-STRmET-Charles Thorpe, the proprietor of a well-known betting office, No. 124, Jermyn-street, was saummoned before Mr. BEADON, charged with keeping a betting-office for the purpose of betting with persons resoirtg thereto. The defendant has already been convicted, and a penalty et oOf. inflicted for a similar ofience. Since the conviotion the office has been turned into a wine room, which wa-t used az a betting-office, and was entered last week by the polioe, when several personBwere takeninto custody, butdischarged, ;as the proof was insufficient. The defeadant, who was present, 'contrived to elude the police, and, as the mnagiatmte has no 3power to issue a warrant in such cases, other proceedinga -were resorted to, which had the effect of producing the defendant in court yesterday. Mr. Abrahams appeared for the defendant. Inspector Webb proved that he watched the defendant's house on Itonday, the 4th inst., and from 10 .o'clock in the morning to 3 in the afternoon he saw 258 persons egO in and out of the house. Several of these persons -were well-known betting men and had betting books with them. Whi]e on the watch he saw the defendant Thorpe at a window entering something in a book. About 7 o'clook Snperintendent Hannant, with assistance, entered the house un er a warrant from the commissioners, and took in custody all persons found on the premises. Thorpe was there, but as socn as he understood what business the superiantendent had there he left the place and got away. A number of books, racing cards, and betting materials were found in the vwine room and other parts of the house. An unstamped greement was also found, purporting to be between Charles Thorpe, of Barnes-lodge, Ki.gsland (the defendant), and Emanuel Castelleno, free vintuier, for the latter to take the premises i JerDnyn street. The inspector further added that his attention had been directed to the house for the lnst nonth or six weeks, and had seen the defendant there constantly. Cross-examined.--Had seen the defendant acting as the occupier of the house, opening the door and receiving persons. Did not know that the defendant was the proprietor of racehorses. Could not swear that the person who went into the place went there for the purpose of betting. Police-constable Draper said he went into the office, having been told to watch the office hy Superintendent Iannant, and he heard a person named Williauis ask what odds, or vrhat price would he given on a particular borse. The defendant Thorpe named the odds, the person put down some money, a sovereign, which was taken up by Thorpe, -who wrote something in a book. Cross-examined. - Had been told by the superintendent to go to the office and sea if anything was going on besides selling wine and cigars. Was not told to get evidence so as to accoinpjiah a serone convi:tion against the defendant Thorpe. Was to report what he seav at the defendant's to the super. intendent, sad did as. Did not write down his evidence, nor could he siay if iho superintendent wrote it down.

Saw money paid by a person who entered the house Cross-examined.-Could not swear that monoy passed for a bet. Mr. Abrahams wished to know on what section the defendant was called before the Courb. Mr. BEADoN waid on the third section. Mr. Abrahams said under that section the poliee had no authority to go intothe house and seize all persons and Mhproduction of the police -warrant was not necessary iD the case of a summons. The charge was of a different character on the former oeasion, when it was noessary to produce the authority for enteringthehouse. Mr. Abrahams entered into a farther argunt, er which, at his request, Mr. BEADON agreed to adjourn the case for a week, the defendant to enter mto his own recog. nizances to appear on that day. MsAsRrLEnoNE.-Yesterday Alfred Brown was chagedi with having stoleis a gold watch, chain, seals, andi key, the property of the Lord Bishop of LiB=field. tharles Wood, chief waiter at Thomson's Hotel, Caven. dish-square, at which the right rev. prelate is staying, deposed that on the same morning he saw the prisoner run out of thesittig-room of the bishop intothe street. He pursued him and brought him back into the hotel, when he stated that his object in comiig to the place was to offer himself for the situation of under-porter, and he produced a pprwihhe had obtained from a registry.office ina High Mr. BROuGaTON.-Were you in want of an underporter? Witness.-Yes, Sir, and application had been made at the office for one. Witness added that while prisoner was kept securely by him in the hotel, the door being closed upon him so as to prevent the possibility of his egress, he said, "Well, I suppose I had better give it up ;" and he handed witness the watch and appendaga. at the same time beggin forgiveness, alleging as an excuse for what he had do:e that he had been some time out of place. Obey, 68 D. produced the watch, &c. The bishop identified the property. He haa not left the room more than threeminutes when hewasmade acquainted with the robbery. Mr. BROuGHTON (to tho oonstable).-Did the prisoner say anything more to you than what you have stated? Witness.-Yes, Sir- on the way to the station, when told byme that the watch belongedto a bishop, he said, "WelU, if he is a bishop he could wel afford to lose it." He stated that he was sorry he had seen the watch, for if he had not done so he should not have got into any trouble. On the way from the station to the police-court the prisoner said to witness, "Do you think the old bishop wil attend? I hope I shan't be sent for trial, but if I go down for three months I don't mind." The prisoner had no defence to offer. Mlr. BRouGEToN remanded the prisoner for a week, in order to give an opportunity for officers of different divi. sions of police to see him, as it is believed that he Is an old hand, and that proof of former convictions may be brought forward. Wons P-s TRzT.-Martha King, the daughter of a rewctable tradesman at Homerton, was charged on remand be rore Mr. D'EyNcouT with the murder of her male infant. The offence was committed so long back as the 27th of last March, when the prisoner, who was in the habit of visiting at the house of a Mr. Mitchell, in the same neighbourhood, called there, and, as she complained of being ill, and it was late, she slept there with Miss Mitchell. In the course of the night t e prisoner got worse, but, no suspicion being entertained of her condition, she was supplied with restoratives, and apparently got better, but still retained her bed till 3 the next afternoon, when Miss Mitchell, to her astonishmont, met her going into the back gardenwith something in her hand, and, this and other circumstances giving rise to inquiry and examinaion, the police were communicated with, and the result was the discovery of the body of an infant in the watercloset. This was nearly all the evidence given at the first examination, the prisoner, who was brought to the court in a cab and taken away from it in one, being in too hysterical and exhausted a state to admit of further detention, and the case was remanded from time to time tiU yesterday when she was again brought up. She now scarcely appeared any better. She is an extremely delicate girl of about 19, seemed reduced almost to a shadow, was so debilitated and nervouslyaffected that she was obliged to be seated throughout the examination, and wept almost continuously. Sergeant Fiveash, of the N division, stated that since the last examination he believed it had been discovered by Mr. Stone, a surgeon of Homerton, who was now in attendance upon the accused, and had seen the body directly after its recovery, that a string was firmly secured round the infant's neck, Mr. Stone now said that that was the fact. It was a narrow piece of black tape, resembling a woman's bootlace, and was tied tightly round the child's throat, sufficiently so to cause death itheinfanthadbeen bornalive. He had attended the prisoner after thisl discovery, but had not questioned her thig *ast a she had remained in too delicate a state to On cross-examination by Mr. Heritage the witness added that he could not say positively whether the child had been born alive or not, but, allowing that there had been one inspiration, hescarcely conceivedthat would have been sufficient to thoroughly inflate the lungs. The ligature might have been secured to the infant's throat by its mother to assist her while in her pintful position, Dudley Kin ord, doctor of mnedicine, of Clapton-square, stated that he first saw the ohild on its removal to the workhouse, the day after that on which it had been discovered. It was lying with its knees drawn up, its hands clinched and the umbilical cord not secured. The countenance ant bead displayed considerable lividity, though no positive indicationa o extenal violence. There was also a pieoe of thin black stringfastenedtightly round its neck, and, on the suositon that the iant was born alive, this was amply sun ient to account for its death. He was present at the post mortem examination, and feund the lungs to be fully inflated, but he also could not decisivel state that it had been born alve, though it was a full-growin child. Mr. D'EyyCounr said that under the circumstances now detailedd he must send the prisoner for trial on the charge Mr.Heritage said, that as such wan the case, he thought it most expedient to reserve his client's defence. Mlr. DEyeNcosjRT asked Mr. Stone whether, in his opinion, the prisoner was in a condition to be removed to prison with safety, and that gentleman having answered in the afflrmative, as the suspense the prisoner endured was greatly calculated to increase her sufferings, the depositions were at once taken, and the prisoner wras transferred to CLERKENWELL.-James Cahill, aged 39, a respectably dressed man, described as a messengerat the Admiralty-office, Someret-house, residing at No. 3, Grafton-street East, Tottenham.court.road, and Mary Josephine Cahill, of 1, Fitzroy-place, Kentish Town, who stated herself to ba the wife of the male prisoner were brought up in the custody of Inspector D*an and Hassell, 167E, chargedwith obtaining by false and fraudulent pretences the sum of 2501. from Alexander Duncan, of 6, Charlwood-street, Tachbrook. street, Pimlico, a gentleman, under the plea of obtaining him a situation in the Admiralty. A gentleman, who attended from the Admiralty to prosecute, stated that the case was one of the greatest importance, and was laid under the 49th of George IIL, chap. 126, which enacts " that if any person shall seLl or bargain for the sale of any Government office, or receive, have, or take any money, fee, gratuity, loan of money, reward, or profit, directly or indirectly, or make any promise, agreement, covenant, contract, &c., for any appointment, or nomination to any office, in every such case, every such person, and also every person who shall wilfully and knowingly, aid, abet, or assist such person therein, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanour." From the facts he should be able to produce he had not the slightest donbt he should be able to show that both prisoners were concerned in this offence. Alexander Duncan was then caled, and stated,-I formerly resided in Hunter-street, but am at present living at No. 6, Charlwood-street, Pimlico. In the month of Febrmary last I placed an advertisement in the Morning Post newspaper offering from 2001. to 6001. if a good situation could be obtained in a proper way for me. The next day I received a letter without name or address, in a vwoman's handwriting, which stated that the person writing had an appointment which would, perhaps, suit me, and I should be written to again. After I bad received a num. ber of letters, one was sent to me, which stated thatthe writer bad an appointment at her disposal in the civil service, at a salary of 300., rising 151. per annum. For the appointment to that situation the writer would expect a douceur of 5001. I answered that letter. I never saw anyone, but I was told that upon receiving my appointment I should be expected to pay 2501. at the place where the letters were addressed to-viz., in Perk-street, Regent's PaLrk.

Admiral Sir George Seymour, Commanderin.Chief at Portsmouth, strack his flag last evening at sunset, and went on leave to rocrait his health. The Agamemunon, screw, 91, Master-Commander Noddal, was undocked at Portsmouth yesterday, and placea in the steam basin to complete her outfit. The Volcano steamvessel (floating smithery for the China fleet), Master-Commander Hockley, bent sails at Portsmouth yesterdany, and is ready to go to Spithead. The Adventure and Assistance, line steam troopshipe, are ready to embark their troops at Portsmouth, but no day is yet fixed. An Admiralty order has been received at Ports. mouth Dockyard enjoining that all troopships fitting at that Fort shall have two quarter-boats fitted with Mr. C]ifford's pabtnt lowering apparatus. Besides the Adventure and Assistauce, the Agamemnon, melville, and Hastings are being also supplied with this means of readily and safely lowering their boats inany emergency. The Fox steam yacht, fitting out at Aberdeen for Iady Fraklin's final search, under the command of Captain ll'Clintock, R-N., is rapidly progressing in her equipment. She will be a "model Arctic. 100 maen are now at work upon her, besides others employed about her machinery. The Fox Will carry with her a speaking reminiscence of former expeditions to the same regions. When Lady Franklin fitted out the Prince Albert, in 1851, Prince Alber; presented an organ to the expedition, which went out in the vessel named after his Royal Highness, wintered at Batty Bay, and in 1852, before returning to England, the organ was lent to the North Star, at Beechey Island, where it spent two years, and was always played at church service. In 1854, after having spent three yeaz and &half in the Arctic regions, it was brought safely home. Lady Franklin naturally prized it the more highly, and had it repaired at considerable expense, and now the same Royal souvenir is about to be shipped once more to the Arctic glions. The fo31owing officers have taken uptheir commissions and joined their ships at Sheerness :-Captain Frederick Hutton, 3d of July, 1844, late in comma nd of the Royal Willani, 120 gans, guardship of ordinary at Devonport, to the Terror floating battery; Captan Hutton commissioned her yesterday before noon; the lon.

Marryat, is ordered to be paid offin the baia at Sheerness on Saturday next. An Admiralty order has been reoeived at Sheerness that all seamen pensioners are to be discharged from ships destined for foreign service. The newly-eretod battery, built by -essrs. Kirk and Parry on the spit of the Island of Grain, for the protection of the entrances to the rivers Medway and Thames, is being armed. The paddlewheol steam-sloop Spiteful, 6, Commander Francis H. Shortt, fitted out at Woolwich in June, 1854, for service in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, returned yesterday morning to be paid otE On her arrival at the dockyard an officer of the Engineer Department pro. ceeded on board, and accompanied the vessel down the river, on trial of her machinery.

Her Majesty's steam troopship Dee, Mazter-Commandr Pullen, steamed out of basin yesterday, at Woolwich, and proceeded to Devonport, laden with 100 tons of boilers and stsam gear on deck. The dockyard sailing transport Ant, havin been condemned by the Shipwright Department at Woolwich, is ordered to be broken up, and will be replaced by the Ann. The superintending officers of the East India Company's service being about to purchase a number of screw steam sloop, has solicited the attendance of an inspector of machinery from Woolwich Dockyard, to make a survey on its behalf of the vessels selected. The Admiralty has accordingly despatched Mr. David Patridge, A88istant Chief Engineer, &c., at Woolwich, to Glasgow and Liveir pool, in order to render the assistance reqaired.

ErrEarPE EXTAORDINARY.-At about 3 o'clock on Sunday morning, as the mailman was entering Canter. bury by the New-road, he observed a donkey standing by the side of the path, inmnediately-opposite the end house pfBatton-terrace, on the opposite side of 'the rowr. There was something on the path, but it was not sufficiently light at the time to enable him to see what it was, as he quickly drove past. He told the 'police of the circumstance, and Inspector Spratt and Dodd went to the spot indicated. There they found a donkey side-saddled, and under the hedge were two young ladies, wrapped up in foreign travelling dresses, with the hoods over their heads, and by their side stood a large home-made loaf, a carpet-bag, and a Skye terrier dog. There were also twvo gentlemen's hats, but no s2gns of any male companions could be seen. In answer to the police the young lades said they had arrived from the Continent, and were going to 'visit a brother at Tonbridge, hut reachiDg Canterbury too late on the previous evening to obtain accomnuodation at an hotel tbey had resolved to remain at the outskirts of the city all night. On the previous day they stopped at EweJI, near Dover. The police at first left the fair travellers to their own reflections, but having talked over the matter, and found an advertisement in The Times, in which the young fugitives were exactly described the description corresponding in every particular with the parties encamped In the New-road, the police immediately had them removed to a place of safety, while they commir. nicated with the frm mentioned in the advertisement. A telegraphic message was received in reply, stating that they were in the country, but would be in Canter bury by the first train on Monday morning. Since tbeir detention the young ladies have Eecluded themstlves in their bedroon.

,SPORBTYG flTBZUGCB. GRFAT BOAT RACe FOR THB CHAIPIoxBHIP OF THE TEumP Never within the experience of the oldest aquatic man has there been seen so vast an assemblage as that gathered together yesterday to view the boat race for the champion. ship, and never was moredisappointment experienced. The assemblage reminded one only of a Derby, while the raca itself was one of the most hollow affairs on record-s) holovw that it would be difioult to coaceive anything more', one way, and the more provoking because something very grcat had been generally speculated upon. Bat results of this description are of too common occurrence in sporting matters to create any great amount of surprise. The championship was won three years ago from Thomas Cole by James Messenger, of Teddington, whose style as a rowing m-n is unequivocaUy the finest ever seen in a- boat. He held that proud distinctior. until yesterday, when it wil form no matter of sarprise that a man who could pull 34 effective strokes in a minute should have vanquished him. Messenger gained the championship with less trouble and enjoyed it with more ease thim any man who has preoeded him within the last quarter of a centary; from the day he won it until yesterday his claim to supremacy was undisp~uted. Henry Kely, his opponent, five years his junior, but very evenly matched with him in size and weight, has only recently acquired aquatic celebrity; he was unheard of until two or three years ago, and first distingtushed himself in a close race at the Thames National Regatta. Although he exhibited great pluck and power then, more could hardly be said than that he scrambled a boat along. He has sinconuch improved, although his rowing of yesterds7 did not reach that perfection of art which his opponent illus- The stakes were 400t. The betting at first had been at even, but as the day approached 5 and 6 to 4 were freely betted on Kelly, which were increased to 2 to 1 before the start, and three minutes after it to 6 to I. The course was from Patney to Mortlake, with tide, and from the hour of noon to the time of the start multitudes in small boats of every description wvre seen wending their way towards the scene of action. To these were added no les than 12 or 14 steamers literally crammed with company. The Leander, theGuards, the Palmerstons, and other crack clubs were afloat in their cutters, and as the eye dilated it fell, throughout the whole course of 41 miles, upon myriads of human beings closely packed together, anxious to ee any part of the race. Mr. T. S. Egan, of the Univerdty of Cambridge, kindly onciated as referee, as it is termed, which in effect means sole umpire, and took his station on board Citizen D, to perform what are too often the onerous duties of his office - and it may be as 'well here to observe that, although from the number of steamers present, the Thames appeared to have one huge furnace upon it, the care and attention of Mr. Burney, Superintendent of the Citizen steamboats, and of Mr. Sawyer, Superintendent of the iron boats, prevented any collisio,a or confusion. Directly after' 4 o'clock both men appeared at their stations, Kelly'on the Fulham side, and the most breathless anxietyipervaded the vast assemblage. Kelly's steerage was directed by the celebrated John Phelps, Messenger's by Thomas Mwaclnney. The men started themselves, and were even at the moment thoy mutually agreed to go, but Kelly went away fromMessengerw ithamazing rapidity. So rapid -was his performance that he took foar strokes to his opponent's three, and on their arrival at Finch's Cricket-ground RKelly had drawn his boat clear. From first to last, without the slightest variation, save Kelly's increasing his lead as much as he pleased, Messenger never stood a shadow of a chancoe, ana there were hilf-a-dozen clear lengths between the boats at the Crab Tree, which were increased to 16 or 18 at the finish. Throt hout the whole of this race however, Messenger rowe with his usual unwearied care and attention, but his boat seemed too lean forward, and, finUshed as his style is, was pressed into the water. Towards the conclusion of the race Messenger encountered two trifing hindrances, but his opponent, who was within 100 yards of him at the time, waited for him. Indeed, the speed of the wrinner during the last half mile was so relaxed that he occupied 24 mainutes and a-half in doing the distance.
DMIBAL SIR CH4BLBS WOOD AT FAVLT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TTh[ES. Sir,-The foUowing comments on Sir O. Wood's defence of the notorious troopshipa would have been forwarded this morning had I not, with a view to being rather more sure of my facts than it appears necessary for a First Lord to be, required the intervening time to verify certain tatements I now make. The gallant gentleman has, on the min points, been so pleantly handled in your leader that I desire to confine myself to showing the public how very badlyafirst-claswofficialmaybe "crammed" fora Parliamentary reply by his underAtrappers. The head of the Admiralty teUl us his amusement has beenvery great at discovering that " a fine merchant ship which left at the same time as the Urgent was driven back dimnantled" by the identica gale which only slightly teased and delayed their Lordahipe steamer. In other ;ords, he cries-" Cock-a-doodle.doo I Our big screw transport has beat a merchantman into fits 1" In the Ministr orgat of this evening tne very nabne of the vessel thus humiliated is given, and a further "circumstsnce" that she "only reached the coast of Portugal a month afterwards under jury mast." Will it be credited, after this, that, so far as the " Urgent" was concerned, the gale is purely imaginary? -that from the hour she left Spithead, on the last day of February, to the time of the occurrence of the disaster of the 3d of March, the sea was like a millpond-that there was barely enough wind to have blown a lady's curl adde I -and that no "fine merchantman" anywhere near her latitude and longitude at any one time would have fownd it neoesary to have taken in topgallant sails ? Had the sap. posed storm really existed, the fires would to a certainty have been put oat-the engine pump could not of course, have been worked, the others were found insufficdent, and tae vessel would have become waterlogged and at the mercy of the waves. Bet, Sir, setting aside these simple facts, may I ask whether it was legitimate cause for satisfaction that a powerful steamer should have carried on in a gale which had driven back a esiling -vessel ? For the benefit of your inland readers allow me to state what every sea-muff knows, that when a steamer of the class of the Urgent meets a gale which would oblige an ordinary merchant vessel to " heave Wt she ought to drive through it with as much ease as an albatros. However, as Sir Charles likes comparisons of this kind, I will help him to another which shall have a better bais than the ideal;one he supplied to the House of Commons yesterday. The comparatively speaking small sailing vessel of the merchant navy William Hammond sailed from Portsmouth on the 24th of January last, with troops for two, of the West India Islands, Barbadoes and St. Lucia; she landed them there, took in otherg, and sailed into Plymouth Sound on the 17th of March, withbut a casualty of any kind; total absence, 52 days. The Iabella Hircus left at the same time as the Wiliam Hlammond, and came back to Plymouth with the head-quarters of the 67th Regiment on the 28th of Marh, having made th longer pamage to Trinidad in the additional time ; total absence, 63 days. These are the doings of sailing vessels of the merchant navy. Her 3ajesty's fine, powerful, new steam-troopship Urgent had to go to one island-Barbadoes. She has been at work 70 days already i How muchWmore is to be added renmains to be sen. Again, she left Barbadoes on the 8th of April, bound direct for Spithead, three days before the mall steamer started; the latter had to call at Grenada, St. Lucia, Ms rtinique, Dominiqae, Guadaloupe, Antigus, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, Tortola, and, finAly, leaving the Danish West India Islad, St. Thomas, on the 15th of April, arrived here 10 days ago. One more word in reply to Sir Charles's statement that the Urgent had been all right hitherto, except in regard to her engines when first launched .-Here are some details of the previous return to this country at the close of last and begijning of this year. Left Malta for England on the 16th of December last, was obliged to put into Cagliari to stop a bad leak (which, it is understood, was quite uncon. nected with the engines), and, eventually reachingPlymouth on the 6th of January, went into dock on the 14th, where she was six weeks undergoing repairs for this defect, and during which the whole yard was in commotion in oonsequence of a fire which broke out on board of her. It is not, perhaps, worth while that I should call attention to the discrepancy occurring in Commander Phillips's letter relative to his intention of coaling at COrunna in order to avoid going into Mdadeira, and the vessel putting iLto the latter port afterwards notwithstanding; or to the suppression of aL mention of the serious stoppage of the steam pump-valves. I content myself with asking, is it not a fact that an aEsistant-engineer has been recommended for promotion for unstopping them in the way described? and Reman. .ir. vour obedient so-"t -,A INFORMANT. may v.
REPORT ON PlusoNs.-The report of Mr. J. G. Perry on the prisons of the southern and westera district of England has just been issued to the public. The inspector cannot as yet pronounce any opinion on the results of the discipline pursued in the reformatories, as the effects cannot be safely judged of while -the children are still under restraint. The prisons generally continue to be improved with a view to separate confnement, and there remain only two county gaols in which it has not been'adopted. The inspector, however, complains that there isatendency-to divest prson labour of all bat its (purely) punitive element, and that sufficient care is not always taken to institate suchZ a course of productive industry as shall practically demonstrate the truth of the principle, and thus tend to indaoe a taste for labour. "The hard-labour cranks," however, and other, barbarous and ineffectual inventions, foanaed on the notion of repressing crime by mere severity of punish. ment, are now altogether abandoned, while in other gaols tbeir abandonment is meditated. Mr. Perry is highly in favour oftheproductive system of labour, which hebelieves might be made to go far to pa9 the expenses of prison eshablishnments. The urgent want of as)llims for discharged prisoners us pointed out very forcibly, and attenwtion is dlrected to somne ex,oeriments recently made on a less co06l scale than in some of the establihshd charities of this kind, the chief value of which ex,cerimeube arises from the 'cirCumStanCe *hat reasonable expectations may be formed of the inrtitutioiis becomning sell-supporting.
ftIIJYV TY INrELLIGBXCZ. OXFORD, MAY 12. The new Examination Statute came to-day before Congre. gation for the second time, having been amended by the council in several very important points since its promul gation in Lent Term. The form of statute having beena read by the Rgistrar, and the usual question asked by the Vice-Chancellor, Mr. Freeman, of Trinity, opened the de. bate by an attack on the existing Modern History School which the statute proposed to continue unchanged. He strongly urged the desirability of uniting -ancient and modern history into a single school, quoting the authority of Dr. Arnold, and maintaining the iwpomsbility of separating the two subjects. He met the objection of a want of good textbooks on the subject of modern history by caling on the University to compose them, and omplained of the way in which even ancient hhtory was studied, as too narrow. The Junior Proctor (Mr. Meyrick, of Trinity) then rose, -and after slightly comn menting upon Mr. Freeman's speech proceeded to object to the Statute on broader grounds. He referred to an objection made in the former debate, that the proposed changes went too far; and maintained that the scheme now- -before the House went further. The only good point in the new plan,was the restoration of Scholarship aad the Poets to the FinalClassical SchooL Its evils were great and many. It would destroy our clasical education, since, after the small modicum of classics requirod at Moderations, almost all our pasamen would-turn to one of the other school. The,same would in time occur with our classmen, since the existing prestige of our classical studies could not be expected to be maintained, being threatened in so many ways. Probabiv, after a 'while, even the "M X6derafion" clasics woUld .be given up, sinee it would be -said that men ought to be sllowedto enter at once on their special lne. He thonght all the real evils of our presint practice might be met by two changes-viz, first, the- repression of Modeirtion honours, in which he would have those who passed well and those who passed ill siuply divided by a linesecondly, the compulsory throwing back of the first anl second examination, and the allowance to men of an early period of passing the first of their two final schools. Se waa much oppcsed to the proviso for creating a Delegacy of Studies. r. Rogers, of Magdalen-hall, requested to be told by some memer of the council why no attention had been pId to the aU but unanimous recommendation of those who had given evidence before the Commissiori in favour of a matriculation examination. Mr. ImncterF ef Queen's. spoke in approval of: the'Delegacy of studies, but obj-t:I strongly to the concentration of attention on secular studies, and the want of any encouragement to theology. He theught the examinatlons thould not be public on account of the nervousness of candidates, and would have the age of men attached to their names in the . lass list He Also objected to the clause in the statute re- iring Dissenters to present a larger amount of secular xnowlcdge than others. The Warden of Mrerton (Dr. Milarsam) was against a matriculation exanciination, and aso against the SyStemn of Moderations lhonours. Eie agreed in the main with the Junior Proctoi, and theuglt the rivilege now enjoyed by noblemen of going up eay for their examinations ought to -be extended to al students. The Provost of Oriel (Dr Ha,wkins) agred gener alwthteJunior PrOctor. He would' begl)ad to see the honouns at hoderations abolished, as they had worked badly for the fina schools. He was in favour of retaining two final schools, which had, he thought, worked well4 He sup. ported his views on these points by statistics. He had an amendment to ropose on the subject of the separation of the Divinity x ination recommended in the statute, Which hle considered very undesirable. Mr. Litton, of Oriel could not see whypassmen should not be allowed to take np Ecclesiastical History and the Apostolic Epistles as well as classmen, and would put in an amendment to that effect. The Master of UIniversity (Dr. Plumptre) was opposed to Moderat5on honours, and to the requisition of a second final schooL He was also opposed to the free choice among the final schools which the statute would enact, and would have a final classical examination for all. - The other studies gave useful information, but did not serve as a trannK to the mind. The rectorof Exeter (Dr. Light. foot) replieu to the question asked by Mr. Ragers, that the subject of a matriculation examination had been frequently discussed in counciL but a majority were against its requirement He hielf was opposed to it, as unfair towards many persons who had been under disadvantages in early life-e. g., young rren from the colonies. Such persons often succeeded better than those who came up far more ad. vaOcd. Professor Daubeny rose inconsequence of a remark made by the Master of University, that physical studieswere not a gooid train to the mind. He maintained the contrar. Professor Jowett had waited to hear aome account of the reasons for bringing forward the present statute. It ws an exact reversal of the last. As the Council did not seem to know its own uind, the best thing to do wo:ld be to pause awhile. He would briefly express his opinion on a few points in the present form of statute. Be *as in favour of a free choice among the four final schools, but against the aPPointment of a Delegaay of stadies, against te distinction of those who passed creditahly in divinity by an asterisl;, and against the restoration of the Poets to theFinAl Shool. He believed this would clash with Mode. rations, end so lead to their abolition, which he should be sorry to see, at lModerations had been productive of much tgoo. Professor Conington replied to Professor Jowett, that le thought the reasons 'or bringin forward the present statute were obvious. Certain evils existed, n were generally acknowledged. There were two wvys of meeting tbem. The Council had tried one way, and it had met with general dpproval; they now proposed the other. For his own partb te preferred the former statute, ut he was willingto aoept the present one. with a few alterttiors, He did not think that Moderations and the fial examination need clash-the examinations might be made very different. He would like to see the Poets brought into the minal School, not ax a necessity, but as an aIternative. For = en he would wish a "poll" examination, chieflY in c'eics, but would giveafree choiceto the Honour cadidates. HIe oommented on the clause respecting attendance upon Professors, lecturme, which he thouht ambiguous, and ia its most obvious sense undesirable. He proposed two amendments. The ViceChancellor did not intend to offer any remarks on the statute, npon which those whose lives ha been, in the University were more qualifed to judge than SC! self. He rose to notice the remark of Professor Jowett. He thought it was not fair on the Council to blame them for changing a sttute in accordance with what Eeemed the genera[ wih of Congregation, since, had they not changed it, th ,r would certainly have laid themselves open to tho charge o disregarding the wishes of Congregation and obstinately maintaining their owni -ews against the gneral opinion. Pro.essor Jowett briefly explained. Mr. Xawlnson, of Exeter, thought it would be very ungracious on the Part of Congregation to make it a reproach to the Council that they had bowed to its expressed opinion. As one whose amendments had been in rt ac cepted, he was grateful to the Council for the modiaocations now proposed. He only thought that the change had not been carried far enough, and that the present scheme was not only a compromise, but a contradiction. He thought such a plan would not be final-either Moderation honours mnustbe abolished, orthe Poeta kept out of the FinalClasical SchooL He was in favour of the abolition of Moderation honours, or their reduction to a minimumt, as roposed by the Junior Proctor, with whose views gener;ly le concurred. The abolition of Moderation honours need not affect tho oontinuance of the examinations, which might still be required, ike respondons, of all. He noticed three pLans with respect to the Final School, all retaining a classical examinationl As necesary, and observed that it was for Con. gregation to nake up its mind between them. Heobjected to the establishmnent of a separate Divity examination. Mr. Mansel, of St. Johns, had a few amendments to proo vwhich he would simply read. They embodied (we believe) a s^heme with respect to the timesat which the examinations should be fixed, supposing the present system of four examinations to be retained. No other member rising, the Vice-Chancellor declared the discussion closed, at abot 10 milnutes to 5 p.m. The Regins Professor of Ecclesiastical History (Mr. Stan. leg) proposes to give two public lectures, at 2 p.m. on Friday, te 16th, and Monday, the 18th of May, on the his- ry of Jacob, and on Irael in Egypt. Heproposes to commence his course of private lectures on the early history2 of the Christian Chrh at 2 p.m. on Friday, the 22d of Bay, in the Clarendon. . .~~~hs
1CTSM OP FnMEE IlPoTs nr AmiCA.- During the tariff discussions of the last Congress it was constantly affirmed by those who opposed tho reduction of the duty on imported wool that free wool would rnin the American woolgrower, and that, should the proposed tariff he ena;cted, we mght expect not only that domestic wool ould he sold this spring at prices lower than ever before, t that the ompetition of foreign wool inour markets would compel our farmers to sacifice their flockrs for the benefit of tne woollen manufacturers, who, it was id, were tho only parties to be benefited by a free trade in wooL This niow of the subjeet was shotwn by us to be not only contrary to the experience of those countries in which foreign wool has long been imported free he duty-, but to be unnatural, since an unrestricted trade in the raw material has always tended to increa it& consumption by the manufacturer, and thus to create a steady and profitable demaund for its production. We are much gratified to observe that our opinions are now corroboraZed by facts. Thbugh the new tariff, which admits all foreign wool oDsting less than20cents perrund. free of duty, does not come into eperation until the 1st of July next, our wool-market already begins to feel its beneficial effects, and prices are now more steady than they have been for some tiime past. We noticed in the report of wool sales a day or two since, 30,00011. of fleece at 60 to 60 oents, and 30,0001b. of puUed at 42 to 47 oents, which are remunerative prices to the farmer, and afford him good encouragement to increasebis flocks. But, notwithstanding these encouraging signs in the market, we observe that the "'protection" speculators are continuftl their prophetic lamentations over the prospective ruins of the woolgrower. While bartering for the incoming clip of wool, they are busily endeavouring to make our farmers believe that the new tariff will certainly reduce the price of domestic wool far below the present market rates. We caution our country friends against the plausible representa. tions of these speculators. Their prophecies are not reLble, for there is every reason to believe that the prices of domestic wool will increase rather than diminish under the stimulus which the new tariff will impart to the manufacthring industry of the country. The latest advices from Europe are favourable to high pricesfor wool. The Iondon auction sales of colonial wool which commenced on the 2M of Pebruary last, have been firmly sustained at an Advance upon the sales in November last of 2,d. to 3d. per pound in Australia, and 2d. to2id. per pound-in Cape wools. As the stock of wool in the principal European markets is unusually light at the present time, a farther Sdvanoe in prices may liiexpeeted, which wvil of cotrse benefit the woolgrowers of this country. These facts, how. ever, should not induce our farmers to hold back their wool crops in the expectation of realizing exorbitant prices. They should only makre them cautious about yielding to the persuaions of speculators and granting concessons which are unnecessary.
