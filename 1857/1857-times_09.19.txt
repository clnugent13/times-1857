Prices then ranged between 89 and 90k, and the final operations were, at 90 to X for money, and 90i toi for the 14th of October. The Indian news reoeived yesterday oontinued to exercise an uufavourable influencet From China; however, a very satisfactory movement irL tl;e rates of exchange is reported, a fall having taken place of 1 to 1l per oent. at. Hongkoxng, and 2i r cent. at Shanghai. In the StockExchange to-4y there was no paticularpressure, for money, advances on Government securities being obtainable at 5 per ceat., but the large revenue and other payments usual at the end of the qurrter ame causing scarcity in the discount.market, arnd the ap. plications at the Bank are proportionably numerous. Traa'mactions in Bank Stock took place at 218i with dividend. India Stock left off at 210 to 212; Ind1w Bonds, 23s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills5 Bs. to 4s. discount. The foreign stock-market continues inanimate, but without any sensible reduction. Portuguese have been negotiated for the account at 456; Spanish Deferred, 25k; Turkish Six per Cents., 95; for the account 94 and i; di-tt Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99i and {; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 100. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate. upon Amsterdam, Hamburg, and Frankfort were slightly lower; onVienna, Trieste, and Leghorm they were higher than last post. The corn-market was heavy this morning, and eales could lot have been presed except at t decline of 29. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the, week shows a steady business and a further advance of id per lb. on Amerlcain descriptions. The final quotations of the French Three pet Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were67f. for money and 67f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of a half per cent. At Viennn and Amsterdam there has likewise been more firm- nesas. The advices from New York to-day by the Northl Star exhibit an average rebound of about 8 per cent. from the lowest point of depression. Erie Railway had advanced from 19i to 21, New York Central from 72 to 77i, Panama from 79 ta 85, Michigan Southern from 17 to 24, and Illinois Central from 91 to 99. Reading was the only important stock that had experienced a further decline, the price, which was 53, being now 51k. The banks had been strengthened by considerable receipts of specie from the interior, as well as by & large arrival from California, and the general feeling was that, although some violent fluctuations might still occnr, the period of greatest danger had beem surmounted. The speculators, however, were sfil bold in their predictions that much worse events would yet be witnessed. There had been no farthero important failures either of banuk or of mercantile firms, and it is satisfactory that transactions have talken place in the stock of the reoently suspended Ohio Life and Trust Company at 13, since from this it may at least be assumed that, according to some opinions, there will be a. surplus, even after all the creditors shall have been paid in full. Credit, however, had as yet revived only in &. very partial degree, and the rates of discount ranged between 16 and 30 per cent. Shipments of gold were consequently still withheld as much as possible, aud. the amount brought on this occasion is onl 10,0001. The Railroad Convention, which assembled on the 1st inst., had been permanently organized under the title of the American Association for the Improvement of Railway Machinery. The failure of Mr. William Sunmmerskdll, a silk manufacturer at Manchester, was announced to-day, but his liabilities are not supposed to be very heavy. The India-house have declined the offer of the fleet of the European and American Steam Coma pany for transporting reinforcements to India i1 connexion with the overland route, " as it is not at present the intention of Her Majesty's Government to aend any considerable body of troops througlh Egypt." In the colonial produce-markets during the week there has been an increased business, and prices oE mostarticles are maintained. For sugar on Tuesday and Wednesday there was an active demand, prnDcipally fromn the refiners; the grocers also purchased more readily, numerous transactions bemng concluded at full and occasionally advanced rates.. Subsequently, however, the movement subsided, andthe market has closed without animation. A decine of about Is. per cwt. has been submitted to. on plantation Ceylon coffee, at whichthere was more activity, while for Costa Rica extreme rates have been obtained; the declaration made by the Dutch Trading Company that they will not sell below the late bought in rates until the spring sales has given a firm tone to the market here. A speculative inquiry has again been experienced for tea, and there have been numerous transactions at improved price. T'he trade have also purchased to some extent. Common congou is firm at is. 2id. per lb. Public sales are advertised for Tuesday. Several floating cargoes of rice have changed hands at full terms, but on the spot there is not much doing. Saltpetre has recovered the decline quoted last eek, and for floating parcels there have been buyers at ls. to 1s. 6d. per cwt. advance, with limited quantities offering. The sales of spice in Holland on the lGth went off at lower quotations, except for black pepper, which was rather dearer. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day Colonel Petrie Waugh again failed to attend to pass his examination, and a further adjournment was ordered to the 19th of November.

IA ILWA Y INTEXL3lGBVCZ. RAILWAY REROPT- Th traffic returns of railways in the united kingdom published for the week ending September 12 amounted to 607,1681., and for the corresponding week of 1856 to S00,1881., showing an increase of 6,980.' The grom re. ceipts of the eight railways having their termini in the metropolis amounted for the week ending as above to 211,3281., and for the corresponding week of last year to 211,1381., showing an increase of 1901. The increase on the Eastern Counties Railwayamountedto 2,1801.; on the Great Northern to 298I.; on the Great Western to 361.; on the London and North-Western to 1,7611.;-totl, 4,275L But from this must be deducted 1711., the decrease on the London and Blackwall; 1,5271. on the London, Brighton, andSouth Coat; 1,8711.on the London and South-Western, and 5161. on the South-Eastern-together, 4,0851. ; leaving the increase as above 1901. The receipts on the other lines in the united kingdom amounted to 295,8401., and for the corresponding period of 1856 to 289,0501., showing anx increase of 6,7901. in the receipts of those lines, which, added to the increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the otal increase 6,9801. as compared with the oorresponding week of 1856. The following are the receipts of railways for the past week:- CHESTER A]-D HOLYHEAD. The balf-yearly meeting of this comzpany was held yesterday at the Euston station, Sir Morton Peto in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in Thc Times, was taken asread. The CHAIRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report and accounts, said, ho believed they contained everything so fuLy that It was not necessary to trouble them with any observations; at the same time hewould be happy to answer any questions that might be considered requisite. There vwas, however, one sabject of importance to which he would refer. It was with regard to the improved commnunication with Ireland under the mail contrac., which involved no fresb liability. Tho subject was of considerable importance to them, and as thonecessary arrangements with the London and North-Western and the Dublin Steam Company would in all probability materially affect the interests of the Cbester and Holyhead Company, a special meeting would be called to enable the shareholders to express their opinion upon the proposed arrangements. The mail contract with the Governmeot would extend the allowance of 30.0001. per annum for 14 years after the new arrangement came into operation. He felt it was due to them and to himself to inform them of his intention to retire in March next from the position he then held in the company; and he believed that one of bis colleagues (Mr. Jackson) also intended to retire at the same time. Tvwo vacancies would be thus created which the shareholders would have to fil up. Mr. W. JACKsoN, M.P., a director, said, there would be four vacancies to fill up, as two other directors would retire by rotation. He (Mfr. Jackson) had long wished to retire | from the board, and he thought he could do so next March without any injury to the concern. It had improved so much that it was in a safe position. In reply to a questior. It was stated that the acsets of the company were more than sufficient to pay off all the liabilities. The revenue of the current half-year would enable them to clear off the 16,0001. of arrears due on the second preference Es'ares, and it was then expected that the net earnings, would be sufficient toj pay all the preference chbrges and probably leave something for dividend on the old sasres. A SHARE}}OLDER thought thero would be no difficulty in filing up the vacancy which might be caused by the retirement of the chairman, presuming that his numerous engagements left him but little time to attend to their afairs. (Cries of "No, no . ) The Hon. O. STAsnEy, xP., said, it was a matter of surprise to him biow the chairman could devote so much time as he did to the affairs of the company. He felt certain that it would be no easy matter to supply his place. Mr. JACKSON remarked that it would be impossible for any one to do more for the concern than Sir M. Peto had done to benefit the company. There could be no doubt that his successor would have a much easier post. The company was involved In difficulties when he joined the board; those difficulties were graduaUy overcome by great labour, and they would soon be in the position of paying off all their arrears on account of preference charges. The road was worked by the London and North-Western Company. There were some differences of opinion as to the mode of working the traffic, but nothing of any importance. Mr. Lxwrs was sure the sharebolders mnust feel greatly indebted to Sir Morton Peto for his great exertions in promnoting the interests of the compDany. He regretted to hear that it was his intention to retire, and hoped he would reconsider it, and remain a little longer at the head of their affairs, which he had so much improved. (Hear, hear.) Other shareholders expressed regret at the proposed retirement of tho chairman, and, in reply to questions. it was stated that the debt due to tbe London and North-Western Company amounted to 221,0001. They were endeavouring to sell the surplus land belonging to the company at Britannia-park and other p laces. When they could dispose of the second preference shares and their surplus land they would have more than enough to pay off alU debts and liabilities, a nd return the 34,000h borrowed or taken from revenue. Mr. R. Bzxsoy explained that the interests of the Chester and Holyhead and those of the London and NorthWeatern Company were identicaL The latter held half the ordinary capital of the former company, and were otherwise interested in the unccess of the railway. There was no adverse interest, and they were determined to carry out the agreement in every respect The Hon. 0. STALXy coneiderod that the interests o the two lines were not identical. The report was then unanimously adopted, and the dividend at the rate of 5o per cent. per annum was declared on the first preference stock, and payment of arrears of dividend at 5 per cent. per annum for six months on the second preference shares was agreed to. On the motion of Mr. LEIsws a resolution was passed expressing extreme regret at the intimation of Sir M. Peto and Mr. Jackson that tliey intended to retire from the board in Mazoh next, and requesting them to reconsider the matter, and continue their valuable services for some time longer. The CHAIRM.zc bad for a long time entertainedan anxious desire to leave the board, but he felt he could not do so satisfacDorily until their affairs were in agoodposition. Their assets no x exc.teded their liabilities ; it was probable that all matters of any difficulty would be settled before March next, and that his snoceimor would have no difficulty in conducting theiraffirn. When he first joined the oo01. pany they were several hundred thousand pounds in debt, and there were 300,0001. worth of overdue debentures at various banks; the company was in pgeat peril, and, he gave his personal ecurity to tbe extent of a quarter of a million to get the debenturs renewed. (BIear, hear.) It ws not a very agreeble position, but he worked hard, and, with the assistnce of his colleagues, had brought the oonoern not (nly out of its difflculties but into a condition to pay all its Ireference charges. The time he thought bad arrived when he should retire aDd could leave them in a safe position, He would be glad to give the board an} isstanoe in hi powver, bat wonld retire at the timo mentioned. Mr. JAcKnON would not leave the company in any diffleulty. but he would be gladi to retire, unless his colleagves considered that it was necessary he should remain some timse to assist them. A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings. MIDLAND GREAT WESTERN. The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts for the past half-year amounted on the lina from Dublin to Athione, andl on the Longford and Cavan branches, to 73,2260, against 64,0041. at tohe cor' ndin od of 1856, showing an increase of 9,2221., incl%mg 2,95 i'from the working of the Cavan branch, which ws not open in tbe corresponding half-year. The total inoome from the raiway and canal amotnted to 84,563L.; and the dishurse. menteto 537371. leaving the net profit 30,8261. To this was atdec 2,6781. the balance from last half-year, making a dlsposable sum of 33,504L Out of this sum the directors propose that a dEvidend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, free of income-tax, amounting to 29,7511., shal he paid on the canital of the company, and the surplus of 3,7561 be carried to the credit of the next half-year's account. The accounts for the eztenidon from Atilone to Galway have been examined bythe auditor appointed by the Treasury, and certificates issued in conformity with the Act of Parliament for the sum payable by the haronies, which the directors are happ to add amounts only to 315., while in the correspomdg period of last year the charge was 1,5231. The con. tinued improvement of the trafic on this section of the line is viewed with greet satisfaction by the directors, and gives them oonfidence in hoping that in a short period the receipts wiU be more than sufficient to meet the.expenses and interest chargeable on it. The working of the Grand Caual has been effectively carried on during the past half-year, and, notwithstanding the severe oompetition in rates wbich has been adopted by the Great Southern and Western Company, this board look forward with undiminished conlidence to its beneficial effecs on future operations. The extensions from Longford to Sligo, and from Streamstown to Clara having received the sanction of Parliament, It is the intention of the directors to proceed in the construction of these lines so soon as the neoesary arrangements are made to enable them to do so. The Bill of the Great Northern and Western Railway for making a line from Athlone to Castlera ha also passed the egiature. The Great Southern and Western Company have ruceeeded in obtaining an Act for their extension to Asthlone, but with restrictive clauses to prevent undue competition for the traffic, which properly belongs to this compMy,

LONDON, SATUZRDAY, SPTE&fBBS& 19, 185i7. in one eonspicuous feature this lamentable Indian atory is true to all the military predent, of this country. As fast as the spread of the Mutiny has brought station after station unader notice there presents itself the invariable image of uOW;8 " old English gentleman," who would, to say -the east, be very much more in his place where iwe\ususlly imagine that character. He is generally found passing about in a state of distracted helpless. mae, listening first to one rumour, then to another; accepting dilatory ple4a from the Commisariat, the doctors, the engineers, the regimental officers, Native as well as European. He has to protect a nIumber of women and children-to guard a treasury or a gaol-to relieve some outlying station or fort-to ascertain in time, yet not precipitately, the intention of the wavering Sepoys-to hold his poaition or to march-to lose no time, yet not stake his all on one desperate chance. What he has to do and the choice he has to make between objects each paramount, yet incompatible, require not only all the wisdom and courage, but the concentration and decision, of youthful manhood. There is not' a man in this country who may not be very thankful to be spared such a trial. One wonders to hear that men can sleep, sit down to dinner, and write gossiping letters with such a weight of responsibility and in such an atmospherG of treason. We had omitted that there are instructions to be obeyed,and disregarded, if necessary. Some will add " public, opinion " to these difficulties. True, there is, and always has been, public opinion, in one shape or another. But this res drac' and regni noritas which the poet places on the; shoulders of an enterpri6ing young Queen, and on' which she excused herself for her vigorous precautionary measures, in the present instance! falls to the lot of elderly gentlemen in cormand of stations, who never yet had an independent command under circumstances of the least difficulty. They are most respeotable men, with much quiet experience, and much inert weight. So long as everybody is true to them they are true to themselves. They are not devoid of a passive sort of courags and a leisurely mode of action. Indeed, speaking from private accounts, these old gentlemen take things more cooly than their juniors; and can temporize, adopt half or; quarter measures, and ove-n emuse themselves, when younger men are ftc. : and finning, and anxiousto cutthe knot and be doing one thing or another. By and by there is a rush; there is firing; there are confusion and darkness; there is a fearful conflict, or a hideous massacre; a long desultory escape; a burning march at the head of an ill packed army; a desperate siege; a sudden combination of the greatest trials that can assail this poor body, brain, heart, and soul. In a few days, or a few hour-s, as the case may be, the elderly gentleman has disappeared. A merciful shot, a general sinking of nature, or, still more frequently, the Commander-in-Chief, puts him out of his misery. There have been, we think, at least three instances in which this latter mode of extinction has become necessary. But why was not the necessity acted upon before it had been proved at the cost of a lost fort or garrison and hundreds of lives? The complaWit has often been made; for the truth is, England does not like the invariable custom of beginning war with one compaign at least of old men and old blunders. The usual answer has been, that it is necessary to fight our way down the Army List, and at some point or other PRoviDnEc will raise up a General. Even in ordinary war it is not pleasant to throw thousands of lives and miClons of treasure into the first year, just as we should so much concrete or so much rabbish into the foundation of an edifice. But the national custom has cost us something more in India. In this case there hung upon the issue, and there called for immediate action, the lives of thousands not only of soldiers, but of men of peace; of women and cbildren; of those who but last year were at our own firesides; of faithful native servants and pious Christian converts-thousands of lives as precious as could anywhere be found in one cause and one name. It was rather hard that all these should be staked on the national usage. They had not reckoned upon it. War is unfortunately a regular condition of human affairs. We have our Armies and Navies, our War-office, and our Admiralty. But a massacre, and such a massacre, to us Englih people, is a prodigy, a horror, a thing we cannot bear to think of, and would even now shut our eyes to, if it had not taken firm possession of our innermost senses, and written its fearful legend on the heart itself. How much of England is to be at the mercy of old men? Old men in the Senate, old men in quiet offices ten thousand miles from blood and fire, are another affair. But how long is it necessary that the cause of England and all she holds dear shall depend on the vigour, promptitude, and sagacity of old men, in presence of armed foes or treacherous friends? Now, it seems to us that on this point the history of the Indian Mutiny so far tallies with that of aU our recent wars, in prescribing at least one lesson upon us. Whatever system of promotion we choose to adopt, whatever principle, or combination of principles, it must not be such that on the outbreak of war, or other more fearful disasters, we find ourselves tied and bound to a sort of easy, comfortable, vacillating old gentleman with much experience of peace, but not so well practised in the fell work of war. We are told, indeed, that any principle ever likely to be adopted in this country will give us old gentlemen ;-the traditional old gentlemen of the dramatist, the artist, and the historian, who haunt courts, frequent the ante-rooms of Mlinisters, and the levees of Commanders-in-Chief. We shall have them by seniority; we shall have them by purchase ; we shall have them by favour ; we shall have them by merit. They have money and can buy; they are connected with noble families; they will get into the House of Commons; theyI talk themselves into distinction; they are favourites in society ; of course, they have expe- rience ; they can tell stories without end of! the last war and the heroes of a gone-by age; they are more genial than the children of this iron, doctrinal, experimental generation. On any rule whatever, it is said we must have old gentlemen, and those old gentlemen will be jolly old fellows, rather pursy, perhaps, not qulite so active as they were once, and taking their time about things. It is added that, taking them all in all, they are as good as young men; perhaps more to be depended upon; at least more likely to die, and so to get us out of the difficulty if they are unequal to their position. We do, however, humbly submit that it is something to establish a negative rule, and so do some- thing towards " exhausting" the problem. As we' would be preserved frora a repetition of this, and even greater calamities, we must not have positions of command occupied by men manifestly too old' for decision and enterprije,-for those mental anxieties and ph-yical hardships certain to arrive in the event of war. If there is no war, it is argued that anybody will do; and it is impossible not to Ruspect that there are septuagenarian soldiers and sailors who do not reckon on war when they ask for employment. But, if we are to have soldiers and sailors at aD, it maust be for war, and accordingly it is to war, and not to peace, that they must be adapted. Now, w e canlot se how the simple rule of seniority can do anything else than fill the higher rankm of the service with old i or elderly men, and so leave Government nothing hut antiquated material to choose from. No doubt, fhe rule of purchame has a tendency to keep merit out of notice and opportunity; but it cannot have so uniformly kept down youth and youthful qualities as the rule of seniority itelf. As for the rule of merit, till some new test be discovered, or a race of statesmen can be found capable of telling a gentleman to his face that he is a fool or a sot, or, worse still, that he is too old for work, and Bufficiently respected to do so with impunity, we feel it is only a platitude to urge it as the rule of prornotio:a At all events, we revert to the negative caution justly inspired by what we zee in India. Beware of old men in your Meeruts and Dinapores aLd Allahabadc; and it stands to reason that, whatever the evils of the purchase system, it cannot do so much to clog the Army Ist with old men as the rule of seniority.
A letter which we yesterday published from a very competent writer opened two of the most important questions with which, after the sauppression of the present mutinies, the Government of India will be engaged. It will devolve upon oar Administration first to organize on some innocuous model the Native auxiliaries, with which it is impossible that we should altogether dispense; and next to establish and proclaim some decided policy as respects the relations to be maintained between the supreme power and the religious institution in our Eastern Empire. The first of these inquirie3 we reaerve for a separate discussion; to the second we now earnestly invite the attention of our readers, for it is hardly possible that any question should concern us, either as conquerors or Christians, more nearly than this. When the Mahomedans subjugated Indif thley exemplified the known genius of their creed by establishing their own religion in open and actir' predominance. It was only the other day i. we printed a species of political circular.,C to have been current in some parta of q-utht India, which representd Queer. .' uomA as taking blame to herself for not having made as many cmverts in a century asTiPpoo SulXTA would haye roade in a month. We do not concern ourselves about the authenticity of this document, but it was evidence, at any rato, that Rindoos remember how Mahomedanism was propagated by, the strong arm of the Government and by the aword of power. Our own policy, based, perhaps, less on any deliberate resolutions than on the dictates of actual circumstances, has hitherto assumed an entirely different com-a plexion. Not only has proselytism been never attempted by authority, but a kind of deference has been shown to the Eindoo creed, and sentiments somewhat more favourable than those of simple neutrality were almost industriously obtruded on the attention of the natives as embodying the views of (lovernment. We embraced every opportunity of disclaiming anything like intervention in such matters; we abstained for a long time from exerting our paramount authority in the suppression even of cruel and abominable usages; and we went so far as to contribute the actual support of the State to institutions promoting false doctrines and idolatry. Our adoption of this course, too, was hardly susceptible of more than one interpretation. We appeared to be bartering our convictions for the convenience of Government. What we could do if we chose to put out our strength might be another thing, butit seemed evident that for the sake of an easy tenure of dominion and economical facilities of administration we were willing to waive some of our prerogatives as Christian governors. Since the late insurrection, however, it has been questioned whether this policy was either so becoming as it should have been, or even so worldlywise as it was thought; and arguments hbve been advanced to prove that it would be better to conduct ourselves for the future in matters of religion with less indifference and more dignity. This expression of opinion has alarmed our intelligent correspondent, and he addresses us, under the signature of " P.," in deprecation of a policy which, according to his views, would alienate the population as well as the Sepoys of India from our rule, and render impracticable that Native ce-operation to which the conditions of our dominion, even after the entire reestablishment of our supremacy, will compel us to look forward. If we adopt these ideas, he says, we shall infallibly be exposing our countrymen anew to the risks of conspiracy and revolt. Englishmen must necessarily live isolated among the Natives, and unless the good will of the Natives can be effectually conciliated by a firm assurance on these points our position will never be secure. The first reflection suggesting itself on these remarks is, that upon the essential principles and general bearings of the question all par,ties are at one. We all desire that our rule in the East should be characterized by tranquiUity and security, and, what is more, all would promptly concur in repudiating anything like an idea of compulsory conversion. Proselytism by violence is utterly oppo-ed not only to the notions of Englishmen but the genius of Christianity. There cannot be. in these islands any single preacher or teacher, however enthusiastic, who would desire to see either menace or seduction employed by the Government of India for the sake of turning Mussulmans or Hindoos into Christians. The only question at issue is what attitude on our part would be most beseeming our position as Christian rulers, and rmost conducive in the long run to the welfare of our dependency. Now, if to this inquiry it is replied that we had better go on as before, it is impossible to escape the retort that such a course has not answered its end. Nobody can maintain that our policy has been successful in tranquillizing the alarm of the Natives on this head, when at this very moment they are in open insurrection against us. If we had carried the Bible with fire and sword from Calcutta to Peshawur we could hardly have been exposed to greater perils than we have experienced as it is. It is difficult to affirm the absolute wisdom of our system in the face of the fact that an entire army has actually risen against us out of alarm for religion, and has endeavoured to re-establish to our prejudice that very dynasty which never scrupled to advance its creed by force of arms. These reflections are so natural that it is impossible to omit them; but at the same time we think the expressions of our correspondent are rather too strong as characterizing the new views to which he adverts. We do not imagine that any party in this country, political or religiou3, wishes the Indian Government to " take a more "decidedly hostile part against the creeds, the, "castes, and the sluperstitions of India ;" to infringe upon " the principle of complete tolera"tion ;" or to devise any measu against caste or creed " with the special aim of destroying " them." We do not think such opinions are at all rife among us, and ia ire cehtain they would never prevail. No Christian speaker could appear, either in pulpit or on platformr, and advocate &saything approaching to forcible proselytism in India. Hindoos and Mahomedans must worship after their own fashiopi in times to come as they have done in times past, but this acknowledgment is perfectly compatible with a doubt whether our policy has been a Msgacious as it appeared to be on these particulr points. It may not unreasonably be thought open to question whether a greater assumption of self-respect might not have procued us a greater amount of confidence. Every conceivable aussrance should be given that the power of Government would never, directly or indirectly, be exercised in controlling, disturbing, or in aby way affecting the religious penuasions of its subjects; but if we showed as much faith in our own religion as we allow the natives to display in theirs,-if while diÂ¢laiming any compulwry propagation of Christianity we plainly avowed ourselves Christiain and aowa ,Vp. tu the avowal, 'we rght not find, the strength of our position impaired by our sincerity. Nobody need wish the Indian' Government to be more " hostile"' to the native superstitions, but it might well be less deferential. We need not " interfere" with castes, but we night pay them less homage. We do not forge; that after what has now occurred a greater viglanc than eyer may be required in dealing with prejudices which for a time may be more sensitive than before, but we borrow in conclusion of our present remarks some observations on this subject of which no reader will dispute the pertinence or impeach the authoriVy Thus writes one of the best and most (perienced officers in the Indian Army, CoIonel Joux JACOB :-" The fact is that when, without " giving offence, the English officer shows by his " habitual conduct towards the Sepoys that he "feels their caste prejudices, &c., to be marks of *inferiority which excite only his pity and regret, "the Sepoys endeavour to keep all such caste preju"dicea, AT., as much as possible out of sight, wil "never allow them to interfere with duty, and *vill never willingly obtrude therm on notice at " RIl" 3Do not these words point to a line of po1ie .vhich might be more becoming to a Chrisiian w'ithout being more alarming to a Hindoo l
We have 1'v beenhelping,in our literarycolumng, -to revive a mabject almost out of mind. Though it is bsrely 20 years since railway travelling was 9r1 generally introduced into this country, and c3iy half that time since it was finally accepted a safe and becoming method of locomotion, people have probably forgotten altogether that this marvellous invention was actually encountered with all the opposition that wealth. rank, and bigotry could contrive to create. Progress, however, in this part of the wotld, at any rate, is certain and irreistible, and its advocates can easily afford, in thO security of their succes, to dismiss from their minds the obstacles they have left behind them. If we revert to the point, it is simply by way of inculcating confidence on those who desire to advance, and, if possible, a little modesty on those who discharge the opposite mission. Of all the discoveries ever made there is none wvhich has produced such universal and unalloyed good as that of the locomotive engine. "Rail" ways," said Mr. DBSBAM prophetically sorae years ago, " wiU do more than ever monasteries " did," and, though the comparison may strike some readers as siDgular, it gives honourable evidence of discernment and candour. The time arrived, indeed, when monasteries, instead of being an advantage, became a disadvantage, when they encouraged idleness instead of relieving destitution, and when, through their intimate connexion with the Papal See, they gave a substantial expresion to a foreign authority within this realm of England. But, if Railways are ever to do harm, the contingency is utterly invisible at present. They may possibly be superseded by inventions stiU more beneficial, but it seems inconceivable that they should operate to the positive injury of any class whatever. In this respect the new institution differs strikingly from other great discoveries. When the keen ecclesiastic, on looking at a printing press, observed that it would kill the Church, he spoke truly enough according to his apprehension of things. In so far as the Church was represented by tradition and authority the art of printing was destined to destroy it by opening the approaches to truth, and the Reformer followed close on the heel of the typefounder. Bait Railways destroyed literally nothing. The great lords and landowners who shuddered at the uncouth machinery and audacious propositions to which they were introduced had not the slightest justification for their. terrors. Their ominous forebodings were not justified on a single point. Although the mass of the popuation gained prodigiously by the discovery, their gains were greater still. Railways have scarcely improved even the condition of the people so vastly as they have improved the value of land. In advertising an estate now-a-days mention is always made of the adjacent stations, and there are probably few customers for such bargains now to be found in the kingdom who would not require satisfaction on this head before opening negotiations. As to the influence exercised upon the national wealth, ADAM SaTnn could hardly have imagined such results as have been actually brought to pass. It has been calculated, as we have elsewhere remarked, that on the MIanchester and Liverpool Line alone the reduction upon the old rate of traffic represented a saving of 250,0001. a-year in actual money, without reference to the enqally important economy achieved in the matter of time. Even in the particular lines of business where there seemed most reason for apprehension, it was found that these apprehensions were vain. The demand for carriages and horses is even greater than before, and, as there are many more travellers, there must inevitably be much more hotel-keeping, though the profession may take a different form. If there is less call for one class of inns, there is more for others. The old-fashioned stately hostel by the roadside, with its dozen musty drawingrooms and its thirty pair of posters, may have passed away, but the new hotel at the terminus is far more capacious and splendid, not to mention that the immense increase of visitors poured into the several towns of the kingdom yields a proportionate extension of the trade at a thousand different centres. A man desirous of getting his living by providing accommodation for travellers can certainly find many more opportunities of doing so now than he would have met with 50 years ago. NeverthLdess, in elaborating this wonderftl discovery GEORGE STEPaENSON, as our review explained, encountered as desperate a resistance as if he had proposed to enslave the kdngdom. There was no catastrophe which was not predicted as an infallible result if his maniacal proposals should be countenanced by Parliament. It required, indeed, some intrepidity to proceed in the face of such terrible prognostics; but the resolution was taken, and in a few years' time the tide had set so strongly the other way that the only danger which could attend the introduction of Railwaysa frenzied speculation-was actually incurred. If we attempt to analyze the opposition which we have described, we shall discover a mixture of motives, but none particularly laudable. Here and there might exist, perhaps, an honest though irrational horror of a new-fangled monstrosity, 'with a genuine reluctance to see old agencies superseded, and a highly natural unwillingness to sink money in a speLulation so strange; but in the main, and substantially, the resistance was probablvi selfish, embodying a desire to save private privileges rather than prevent publio error. It is only surprising that a spirit usully thus constituted should so regularly claim the homage due to profound political wisdom. Upon the whole, however, it is probable that even this species of opposition represents a serviceable element in the great current of the world's affairs, and indeed, if whatever is is right, we must needs adopt somne such persuasion respeting a phenomenon which is never likely to cose. Certainly it is rather difficult to see what good was done by hustling and bullying GEOGox SrTZ1N8?sor after a fashion which might have scared, from his purpcse any less resolute m-n ; but, it there must always be two parties in a StA.*, and only c-ne of these can embrace the doccrine of progress, the policy of satgnation poaswe attributes of L uecessity1 if rkeAeandeur, If truth is to gain by discussion there must be an antagonist, just as on a question of canonization the Romish Church sppoints an advocate to represent the DeviL The remarkable circumstance in the cae is, that those who select these particular functions should so inrariably assume and so very frequently obtain the credit of the highest statecraft and most exalted sagacity. Resistance to reform is almost infallibly invested with the distinctions of prudence, foresight, and patriotism; nor does it appear that an unchecketed series of failures produces the least effect on such pretensions. The apprehensions expressed the other day about the Divorce Bill scarcely exceeded those which were placed on record at the discussion of the Mlarriage Law in the last century, and pretty nearly all the consequences with which we are threatened if we emancipate the Jewa were ihreatened with as much earnestness when we emancipated the Quakers. The repeal of the Corn Laws has not only filled our markets and extiDguished sedition, but has left anners better off than ever. The repeal of tho Navigation Laws is found to be compatible with the unprecedented prosperity of the nercantile navy, and it may be said with truth of every one of the reforms recently contested with so much eagerness, that they have falsified the predictions of their opponents as completely as they have justified the arguments of their- promoters. It is certain, howev&, that improvements equally promising will, notwithstanding such precadents, be encountered with equal tenacity in times to come; but when nex-t any projected reform is coupled in public discussion with the ruin of the country, the destruction of important interests, anad the decay of England's most valuable characteristics, it may conduce to the assurance of the nation, and perhaps to the facilitation of progress, if we remember the reception given to Railways, and the history of GEoRGE STEPsXsox.

BoILER EXPLOSION AT MANcHEsT.-Yesterday morning, about squarter to 10 o'clock, a large bciler, of 50horse power, bunt at the ironworks of Messrs. Johnson and Co., Bradford, nexr Manchester, severely scalding and otherwise injuring four of the workpeople, and less aeverely injuring three other persons. There were 16 boilers on the premises and four steam-engines, and they were all fitted ith safety-valves, steam-gauge;, and other appliances to insure safety, and the boiler that has burst was supposed to be in good working order, having been inspected and reported upon monthly by one of the inspectors of the Steam-boiler Association, of wvhich association Mtessrs. Johnson and Co. are members. The boiler was a circular one, 22 feet long and 5 feet in diameter, and the plates over the fire-place and those at front, under the fire-place, Lad given way, so that the steam and water escaped both at back and front. John Cash, the engine-driver was in front of the fire-place throwing on coal, and was blown to a distauce of 20 yards. He was taken up severely scalded and bruised about the bead, and was afterwrards carried to 'lhe infirmary where he lies in a precarious state. David Gregson, Richara Sellers, and a boy named Joeeph Hayes, working in a large shed near the boiler, were also mnch'scalded, particularly Gregson, and were carried to tho infirmary. The three other pesons injured, who were engaged at the time in piling scrap iron (one of them a woman), thongh much scalded, were removed to their homes. There Is said to have been a good supply of water in the boiler, and the cause of the explosion is not known. The pressure at the time is said to have been 451b. to the square inoh. Cash is reported to have been a steady, experienced, and attentive engise-driver, and no suspioion of mismanagement attaches to him. There is but little hope that Cash and Gregson will recover.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMRS-OPRIUZ, Saturday Morrnmig. THE MUTINIES frN INDIA. We have received files of Calcutta papers to ti8 8th August inclusive, also the letter of our Bombq correspondent of the 15th August. By this arrival we havo also rowived flies of papers and our private correspondence from ChitnS to the 25th July. We take the following frorn the Jalcutta BnglihAman of the 8th August:- " We fear that when this paper reaches our English readers they will tltQw it away in disgu, exclaiming, " Oat on you, ;owls, nothing but songs of death." It is with the deepest sorrow that we say we have nothing elsfe to record One calamity follows another, and notdiing cheering can be related save the indomitable spirit everywhere displayed by British soldiers, whch carries them through difflicultiesotherwiseoverwhlmning Oneaeriousmisfortune, and one alone, has oocurredto them, whichwasinpursningthe mutineerfromDinapore. It is a month at least since a deputation of merchants interested in property in theneighboarhood of Dinapore waitedon the Governor-General to entreat thbt the three native reginents at that station might be disarmed. The reply wag an expresuion of confidence in their fidelity. At last the symptomx of mutiny became unmist8keable even. to the obtuse senses of the militcry authorities, and then the attempt to disarm was so clumsily made u to fail, and to cause the loss of about 200 lives, and probably from 10 to 20 lacs worth of property. But after such tragedies as those of Jhanai and CaTp7rel othera sink ihto insignificance. We have not yet all the details of this last terrible massacre, but it is computed' that nearly a thousand Christians lost their lives in it. " Cawnpore was formerly an important military station, but hax of late years been but slightly garrisoned. Is convenient position for connecting the trade of the upper and lower provinoes made it the site of several thriving commercial establishments, and it was also inhabited by a number of East Indian families, who had property there or in the neighbourhood; and also by pensioners, who found it an agreeable residence. On, the breaking out of the mutinylthere all these unfortunate people, except a few who were able to take shelter wit,h General Wheeler in the cantonments, were ruth. lessly massacred, withl every possible aggravation of cruelty and insult. General Wheeler, with his bandful of European soldiers, intrenched himself, an4 maintained his position so long that the most sanguine hopes were entertained of his deliveranoe but intercourse was So completely cut off that nothing was po3itively known till. the arrival of General Havelock's force at Cawnpore, when the dreadful fate of the little garrison was ascertained. Two or three only have escaped, enough to tell the dreadful tale of unprovoked barbarity and faithlessness. Among the sufferers were the women and children, nearly 200 in number, of Her Majeswt 32d Foot, whose depOt it was. The feelings of every British soldier in India may therefore be imagined, and, if they should in future be accused of cruelty in their vengeance, it need only be re. plied,-Remember Cawnpore! " The most painful reflection in this matter is that all the valuable lives thus sacrificed at Cawn. pore and at Lucknow, all the loss of property throughout the adjoining provinces, and -all the murders at Allalabad, might have been easily pre. vented. Jung Bahadoor, the ruler of Nepaul, has virtten to a friend here that at an early period of the mutiny he offered to send 10,000 men to the assistance of Government, and, if desired, to take the command of them himself. Thinking, as every rational man did, the occasion urgent, he pushed on 3,000 at once into the British territories. He received a civil answer, declining his offer, and requesting that the 3,000 muen might be withdrawn. Before they could reach the frontier another message came, requesting they might once more advance on Lucknow; which was complied with, but too late, it is to be feared, to be of much service. 'Now,' remarks this sagacious ruler, in the letter above-mentioned, 'if this is the way you treat your aUies, you need not be surprised if they lose all confidence in you.' " Those who have lost dear friends and relations, those who from affluence are reduced to want, may be expected to expreus thenmselves bitterly, but we think the calmest reflection will justly fix a heavy load of cenaure upon Indian mahdminiatratioe. We said on a former occasion that Lord Canning, as a stranger, unavoidably trusted to those about him, and has laudably exerted himself to the utmost, but men in office here, clinging to the system by wich they have their gains, could not or would not see that it vwas crumbling under their feet, and resemble those who, seeing house after house swallowed up by an inundation, flatter themselves it will never reach that which they inhabit. " It will be asked what are our present hopes aud prospects ; In the Pubjab mutiny has been quelled and punished with a strong hand, but from its frontier throughout the North-WNestern Provinces lar and government do not exist, and, except here and tnere an isolated garrison, the British power is for the timne extinct. Delhi has not fallen, nor is it believed that the little army which hs dared to besiege the numbers collected there can take it without reinforcements. Agra is believed, for we have no certain information, to have been plundered, and the garrison to have retired into the fort. Desunnding the Ganges, -we hold nothing but Capore, which is re-occupied and held by General Neill. General Havelock adanced from that point to the relief of Lucknow, but has been appo-ed by a> large a force that it is understood that he will have, toewait for reinforcements, of whic&, acoording to the latest aceounts, a small detacIhmInt has reachd 'him. It is supposed that on his reching Lucknow the garrison will be withdrawn, and Oude abandonedi for the time, and that a force will be concentutea at some convenient point, to a&vance so soon. as. the season permits.

OUR BOMB XY CORRESPONDENCE. The subjoined letter from our Bombay correspondent contains ample details of the siege of Delhi and other important matter. It wil be read with unusual interest:- " BOMBAY, AuOusT 15. "ln the single aunouncement that Delhi was Atill at the date of our latest accounts from Lahore in the hands of the enemy is contained all, or very nearly all, the intelligence of an unsatisfactory character that I have to communicate to you from the Presidency of Bengal; and this one announcement, while ascribing to it its due, though no more than its due, meed. of importance, you will not, I think, be unprepared to receive. You are aware that, in spite of the considerable accession of strength gained by our forces in the arrival of Europeans and Sikhs from the Punjab during the last days of June aud on the 1st of July, it was not thought pradent to attempt the proposed assault ; and while you have gathered from my last letter that some little time must elapse before the arrival of further reinoreements to any large amount, you have also read that severe, tbough victorious actions, were fought on the 9th and 14th of July, by the losses sutained in wbich our already insufficient numbers were rendered yet more unequal to the service required. Yo'i will, then, I think, be prepared to hear, as I have always been prepared to write, that the army before Delhi dur:g the interval between the 14th and the 2Tth of July acted continuoudy on the defensive only. Two skirmishes took placeone on the 18th, the other on the 23d; but before making further allusion to these later engagements, Iwill go beck to the first fortnight of the mouth a1 the Qpl%tk* by wboh it was a kig , and of which details fuller than tHose that I was Ibe tlo give you in my Iast have reachea 4i "The affair of the 4th, when the recentlyafriled Rohilcund mutineers came out and menaoed-our, rear at AHipore and our communications with turnaul, hardly amounte4 to an x g_genent The enemy's attempt was but a feele. one, considering their great strength, and on their rekn to th ciity they took a wide sweep round the rIht of our position, showing no disposition to bring on a combat, which, on the other hand, the f0160 sent from the camp to observe them had, as I am informed, orders to avoid. The action of the 9th, however, waa very 5evere,' resulting, as I have before written, in theasupposed los to the mutieers of 1,000 killed and wounded, and of 211 tb ourselves. The fighting waA mostly on the right fank ancd rear of our poRI.- tion, among the enclosuree at and about the Subzee. Mundee. As you are aware, this is the only kind of locality in which the, mutineers show as sol-- diers to advantage. " Their fighting in the open," writes an officer from the camp, "4is contemptible: They hold walls, &Lc, well" On this day the struggle lasted. from '7 clock in the morning till. nearly 4 ia the afternoon, the great guns on the, walls of the eity firing incessantly tiTl the enemy were driven in. At one period of the day a party of t4iwr cavalry, wbic6h- belonged forxilAy to an Irregular Regiment, made an irruption into the rear of the camp (possibly, it was feared with the connivance of a picket of Irregulars), and rode nearly through it, not doingmuchmischief, fortunately, but causing considerable alarma among the followers, till attacked either by a picket of the 9th Lancers or by a party of Arillery recruits, and driven out with the loss of their leader and several men. The regiments principally engaged were the newly arrived 8th and 61st, and the Sikhs. Nine officers were wounded, one, Ensign Stephens, of the Ridfles, mortally, and the whole loEs is stated at 42 killed and 169 wounded. For four days after this combat none of the enemy ahowed. themselves outside the walls of the city. But on the 14th occurred the action to which I was able briefly to alude at the end of my last letter. A body of the mutineers estimated at 9,000 attacked the British position, as usual, on the right flank, and a smart skirmishing was kept up among the enclosures for three hours, when the enemy, fairly beaten out into the open, made for the wells in hasty and disorganized flight. tIp to this time our people are said to have had only sit, men hit, but now, in their eagerness to punish the fugitives, they followed them up so far as to get within range of grape, and even of musketry, frora the city, and suffered accordingly to the extent of 171 killed and wounded. No offlcer appears among the killed, but Brigadier Chamberlain was wounded, though not severely, and seven officers more. The next affair took place on the 18th, but was short and uneventful, though on our side one officer fell, Lieutenant Crozier, of the)75th. On the following day Lieutenant Rivers, of the same corps, died of cholera. The skirmish of the 23d, which was the next to follow, and is the list of which we have heard, was distinguished from its immediate predecessors by the circumstance that the enemy's attack weA directed against the left .nstead of the right of our posmtion. They camne out 'n force by the Cashmete-gate, with several field guis, and moved straight upon our batterv at Metcalfe-house, under cover of a heavy fire from the walls. But here the ground is les cut up by enclosures than on our night, and consequently is less suited for the operations of the mutineers. Attacked in flank by Brigadier Showers they fled with a precipitation that aved their guns and preserved themselves from any serious losw On our side Lieutenant Law, of the late 10th Native Infantry, was klPled, and four (fficers were wounded. All of the latter, together with the officers andmen hit onthe previous occasion, were at the date of the latest accounts doing well. Up to the evening of the 27th no more fighting had taken place. The force is now commanded by Brigadier Wilson, of the Bengal Artillery, illhealth having, as was anticipated, compelled General Resd to relinquish his post. "It having been decided, as I hear from the camp, that nothing can be attempted against the city till the attacking army is largely reinforced, you will be anxious to know from what quarters and to what amount reinforcements are procarable, and how soon they are likely to be united before or a -ound Delhi. From the Punjab on the one hand. and from the valley of the Ganges on the other accessions of strength are to be looked for. Sir John Lawrence, the indefatigable Chief Commissioner of the Punjao, is at Lahore, bent upon directing on the revolted capital every European and every Sikh, whether of the old regiments or the new levies, who can be spared from his loyal and now tranquil province. I say tranquil, because every regular infantry corps of the Bengal army 8erving in the Punjab has either been disarmed, or, having mutinied, has been de stroyed or driven beyond the frontiers. " The vengeance taken on the latest mutineersthe 9thi Cavalry and 46th Native Infantry, whose misdeeds at Sealkote I recorded in my last, has been signal. Not only, as I bave before written, was tbeir main body twice attacked and well nigh annihilated by Brigadier Nicholson with his flying coluran, but their fugitives and stragglers who had escaped into Cashmere were sent back by Gholab Singh to the British authorities to the number, including camp followers, of 572. Of this number 78 troopers and men of the 46th were made over to Lieutenant MI'Mabon, an assistant-commissioner, at the head of 3t 0 of the new levies. That officer at once executed 68 of his prisoners, reserving the remaining 10, chiefly commissioned and non-commissioned officers, in order that a more formal and public example might be made of them. So again with the 55th, who long ago mutinied at Mfurdan, in the Hill country, and of whom many escaped across the frontier, and sought shelter with the mountain tribes. A strong party of these fugitives, attempting to cross into Cashmere, were attacked and beaten by the Hill men. 32 of their number were taken and sent ia as prisonerstoMajor Beoher,commandingin tbeHa&arah country, by whom they were tried by court-martial, sentenced, and executed. At mooltan, disaffection having shown itself in the disarmed 69th, the Subah-. dar-Major of the regiment was tried by court-nmar. tial under the presidency of the commanding offlcer of the Bombay Fusileers, and, being - convicted on the clearest evidence, was blown from a 9-pounder gun on the 24th of July in presence of the whole brigade. The Bombay Fusileers may probably be pushed onto Delhi. One wing reached Ferozepore towards the end of last mouth, and would either be -moved on itself or would set free the iremainiuag wing of the 61st. A portion of the Great Pesawr brigade will, I believe, be brought aown. There are three fine English regiments ther, tbe 70th, 87th, and 27th, two troops of Horse Artiley, five companies of Foot Artillery, and two field batteries. Then Wicholson7s flying column, having puirged tho country of the Sealkote mutineers, is available for service before Delhi, where bF thiFt time it has, beyond a doubt, arrived. It 'aings to General Wilson the assistauce of the 62d. lijh Tnfantry, Colonel DawSees troop of Horse Artillsy, Captain Bourchier's fiela battery, the rth Punjab Infantry, and probably newr levies to a considerable amount. The 2d PunjAb IDEantry and. the Kunmaon lbattalion of Ghoorkas have also reached the camp. The newly, raised ,ikh levies under General Van Cortlandt should also~ be -with the army by thi- time.' The General has 4one excellent ser'i, iu the Eurrianah district, to the north-west 9f Debi, x 'u, in conjunction with Lieuteu5t Pearse and bis Bikaneer and other Irregulars, he bas completely Pacified. At Hisr, whera the General joined Pearze on the 1dth of Jaly, the, Englith officers, found- pMany nRelan6holy traces of I the massacre that the befelL The survirors who., bad returned w rith the forece wre ablo to point ou6 leveral localities where they had seen men and women of their acqiaintance 'shot or hacked to * pieces;-hic cecidise legato5; illc rapt aquila7. Thus the skull of Mr. Wedderburn, the collector, was identified and decently interred. With it were laid such Dortions of the remains of his wife and child, of &rs.

Mrs. Smith, wife of an asistant in.the Mi.tcherry, took refuge with her live eb;idren among ame thick bushes in the garden of lihr iounse. Thbe'gardener knew her retreat} but did not dciloae it, assuring the mutineers who ttactj4d and iacked the house that bis mistress and: her famly had escaped to the fort; biit s c7aohkedar, or policeman, who was under deep obligations to Mr. Smith for recent kindness, found out the place where the wife and children of his benefa'tr Were conce,led? and with his own hand4 laughtered -very one. Portio4s of bloodatained attire were itill clinging to 'the bushes when the -bones of the victims were collected and interred, Of Lieutenant Barwell's bcdy no traces were found. - Such of the prisoners taken by the General's force as were proved to have been concerned in the massa were summarily dealt with. Mrs. Smaith's murderer had escaped, as also bad the man who shot Mr. Thompson, of thle police; but both were known, and at the date of the letter from which I have gathered these details their speedy apprehension was hopefuly anticipated. The new levies4 were then (July 19) coming in fast. 'When joined& by a party of 500 Irregulars of the Dogra t'ibM snd 60 Artillerymen vith -two field pieces from Ferozepore, Van Cortlandt would move to the camp at Delhi, distant very little more than 100 miles, and there, as I have said, he has doubtless ere this arrived. " There Is, then, reason to hope that within the first fdrtnight orthree weeks of the present month the .foice under General Wilson would find itself very greatly strengthened from the Punjab and the North-west. I do not like to venture even approximately upon the amount of the assistance thus to be rendered; but I may mention that the Punjab Infantry Regiments at their faLll complement are 900 strousg, and that the Kumaon Battalion should muster G50 bayonets; for the Queen's Regiments, 'we know how strong they ought to be, but not how strong they at this moment actually are; and of the newleviesit isobviously impossibleto arrive at the numberlikely to beemployed. I sball, however, not be surprised to learn that the aggregate amount of these reinforcements-is at least one-half of the present effective strength of the Infantry of the army. But the North is not the only quarter to which General Wilson is looking for aid. Advancing from Allahabad, the little force under General Havelock has steadily crusbed all the vitality out of the r,,bellion as far as Cawnpore, and now, Lucknow once relieved, it will be pushed on to Delhi with all the speed possible. From Cawnpore to the capital of revolt is 266 miles. This distance, if carts can be got in sufficient quantity, and if the pace is as good as that of Colonel Neill in his late advance from Allahabad to join Havelock at Caw-pore, may be got over in 10 or 11 days. But when we last heard of this band of heroes there was yet work for them to do 'before they could marchNorthward; there was aiU Lucknow to relieve. Between Allahabad and Cawnpore they eugaged the enemy under Nena Sahib no fewer than four times in the course of five days, beating them alhke in the open field, or when posted in strongly fortified positions, capturing all their guns, and finally entering and re-occupying Cawnpore. From his camp at that city Eiavelock writes on the 17th of July, ' By the blessing of God, I recaptured this place yesterday, and totally defeated Nena Sahib.' Then, after describing the position of the enemy, behind a succession of villages, and the obstinacy of the engagement for 140 minutes, till a flank movement gave him the victory, he adds, 'N ena Sahib. had barbarously murdered all the women and children before the engagement.' So the tale of the dreadful massacre was discovered to be only too true. The men of Havelock's force found their way into the building where these poor creatures had been confined, and were horror-struck at the ghastly spectacle of a paved court deep in blood, and strewn with crin soned fragments of dresses, and of a well in the com pound choked with the stripped corpses of the slain. The number of those that here fell is stated at 32 women, with several children. All the rest of the party that surrendered to Nena Sahib were fired upon and destroyed in their passage down the river, except some 20 men, who having swum on shore from a swamped boat were taken and blown away from guns. How many were the suflerers in all I do not know, but there were, I fear, two companies of the 84th there, a com pany of Artillery, aUl the officers of the regiments that had mutinied at the station, and many others who had been detained there on their way to join their corps in the North-west. On the 20th Colonel Neill, with three more companies of the 84th, and some more of his own Fusileers, joined Havelock; and the same day Bithoor, the stronghold of Nena Sahib, was occupied without opposition, and 13 guns were taten, though the miscreant himself escaped. When last heard of he was in Oude. We hear that a price of 5,000 rupees is set upon his head. Leaving Neill, ;now a Brigadier-General, at Cawnpore, Havelock crossed the Ganges, and moved towards Lucknow, distant 53 miles. On the 29th he reached Oonao, about a third of the distance. The town was strongly protected by nature, and by the enemy, but he stormned it at the point of the bayonet, capturing all the gans, 15 in number. Haltng for four hours, he advanced to a village called Bupeerulgunge, also strongly fortified. Thi& position he likewise carried, with its four guns. Ilis owl low was severe, amounting to 88 killed aud wounded. The troops, as in his former actions, consisted of the 78th, 64th, and Madras FusHeer. Alt behaved splendidly. Dangerfield, of the Fusfleers, was the first over the; barricade. Lieutenant Bogle, of the 78tb, was badly wounded wvHe greatly distingaishing himself, and is recommended by the General to the notice of the Duke Of Cambridge. A private of the 64th, named oavanagh, would have been re. commanded for the Victoria Crons bad hesnrviveda lieutenant Seton, of the Fusileers, was severely wounded. In truth, this series oÂ£ engagements, fought under the tremendous July sun by wome ],500 Europeans against bodies of tho enery pi bably five or six times their numiberz must be regarded as not the last among the achieve,e,nts of the matchl'ms British Iniantry. Considerig the strength of the enemy's positions and tbeir own daring, their lombha bem r comparativeY slight, and only one officer hu as yet been, to our knowledge mortaly wounied-Major Reuaud, of the hSadras Puaileers.

They were reported to be wanting percussion caps, and trying it vain tomake them. Of powder, however, they had abundanoe, the heroism of poor Willoughby adl his con- panions having, as I have before mentioned, availed - only to destroy the small-arm magazine. DiAsensions were growing among them; the Commanderin-Chief, an artilleryman from Bareilly, by name Buktahir Khan, had been deposed, and the Prince Mirza Was again commanding.

Ajmeer, Nusseerabad, and Neemuch are garrisoned by the column from Deesa, the 83d Foot, 12th Bombay Native Infantry, and Artillery. The Bombay column from Poonab, under Brigadier Steuart, entered Mhow on the 30th of July, and was welcomed by Hungerford's battery in the fort with a right Royal salute. Of Scindia we still hear nothing. Holkaes dominions are quiet, and so are those of the Ranee of Bhopal. The Saugor and Nerbudda territories are safe. That queer regiment, the 31st, at Saugor, whicb, after frightening its officers into the fort by its mutinous appearance, to6k up arms under its native officers and drove the matinous 41st out of the cantonment, remains stationary and quiet, while a detachment of the same 41st thus expelled for mutiny distinguished itself a few days afterwards by beating off a body of Bundelaa who attaeked their station at Dumoh 1,000 strong. The 5f2d at Jubbulpore have never wavered, and will, it may be hoped, agree well with the column from Kamptee which has now arrived at the station, and which consists entirely of Madras troops, six or eight companies -of infantry, a squadron of cavalry, and three guns of the Nagpore. Irregulars, though worked, by the by, by Europeans. In the Madras Presidency neither Nagpore nor Hyderabad has hitherto given any cause foralarm. The columufrom Bangalore sent on Kurnaul, to watch the southern frontier of the Nizam's country, is now in motion. It consists of the head-quarter, and right wing of the 12th Lancers from BaDgalore, a squadron of the 3d Light Cavalry from Arcot, and one of the 6th from Bellary, the head-quarters and right wing 74th Highlanders, and 60th Madras Native Infantry from Bangalore, two horse artillery guns, and two guns of a field battery. Brigadier Whitloek is in command. The Hyderabad Contingent has a force ont at Edlabad, in Northern Berar, under Major Orr, a regiment of infantry and a wing each from two others, a regiment and a-half of cavalry, three companies of artillery, with 14 guns. Moreover, of its regular troops, Madras has sent a complete brigade to Calcutta-the 17th and 27th Native Infantry, the 8th Light Cavalry, and a troop and a company of Native Artillery. To make up in some degree for this drain upon his army, Lord Harris in Council has ordered three additional infantry corps to be raised with all speed. " I come to our own Presidency, and greatly I regret to have at last to tell you of an outbreak in a regiment of the Bombay army. I trust that the mutiny has been crushed. I wiU even venture to say that I think that it has. I by no means despair of the Bombay army, the circumstances of tiiis particular outbreak being, I think, sufficiently exceptional to warrant the entertaining a great, if not a perfectly unshaken, confidence in ita loyalty as a body. The 27th Bombay Native Infantry vas raised iu 184G, mainly from the turbulent native State of Sawunt WVaree. In 1857 it happens to be quartered at Kolapore, in the immediate neighbourhood of its original birthplace. I think it highly probable that this proximity was partly the cause of the event which I am about to narrate. Before daylight on the morning of Saturday, the 1st, this day fortnight (it is one comfort to reflect that in 14 days no second explosion has taken place), about 150 men of the 27th turned. out of their lines with loaded firelock4 attacked and plundered the house of their commanding officer, Major Rolland, who had escaped with his wife to, the house of Colonel Maughan, the Resident, (for Kolapore is a Mahratta State, and has a Rajah,> sack-ed the treasury of about 40,000 rupees (4,0001.), robbed the shroffs or native bankers in the bazaar of all the money and jewels in their possession, and then betook themselves to a high-walled enclosure. When day brok-, Coloinel Maughan took a party of the Kolapore Local Infantry jCorps, distrusting the 27,tb, to attack the mutineers, but failed to make any irmpression upon themn (l s.m not sufficiently in.. formed to know why), aad withdrew; thereupon, the mutineers moved out of the enclosure and marched to a town called Kagul, on the Belgaum road. But tbere, wheaher they had beer in previous concert with the regiments at Belgam, and, found their expectationsof a.rising at that sation, disappointed, or wlhether, as is mezo probable, because they were a mere aimlssalot of plunderers, they abandoned the Belgaum road and struck across country to the point where the, Kol&poFra road. to the a coat descends the Western Ghaats at Phoonda. ere, unfortahtel.y they. fell in with three young officers of the, regidient, Heathfeld btubbs, and Norris, who had fled from Rolapore ancd wer, maling their way to the sea coast, when they wee seized and sklin by the mutineera. The murderers then appear to have dispersed. Sone 20 went back to the old enclosure at Kobipora,and were attacked by some of their own regiment and of the Southeru Mahratta Horse and captured, with the los of five klled. A large number of others wer taken in the Sawunt Ware State, having thrown away their artns,but stfllwr. lug their great-coats, and laden with rupee. Othet stragglers are constantly being brought lnu by the villagers, to win the large, xv
CHINA. (FROM OUR OWN COPu ON-)- HONG1KONG, JULY 20. The steamer Ganges arrived here on the 22d Inst., bringing the 10th of June mail fromEngland. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's agent has made arrangements for the steamer Shanghai to take the semi-monthly mail, and the steamer leaves this morning. By the Ganges we heard of the loss of the Transit in the Straits of Banca. On receipt of the intelligence Sir Michael Seymour despatched the steamer Inflexible to Singapore, to be available for the conveyance of the troops. We may here mention that iire of Her Majesty's vessels, bound from England to China, have, within the past few months, been on shore in the Straits of Banca. In consequence of the unsatisfactory news from India, Lord Elgin considered it advisable to leave for Calcutta, and he embarked, with his suite, on board Her Majcsty's stearmer Shannon on the 16th inst., and left the same day, accompanied by Her Mlajestv's steamer PearL The body of marines (about 350) whieh arrived here in Her Majesty's steamer Sanspareil on the 12th inst. have been seut rouid to Calcutta in the Pearl. It is understood that his Lordship's visit to India will not be a protracted one, and that his object is to endeavour to make arrangements for a force to come round to China. The impression here is that some MIadras Regiments may be ordered on. The cause of the digression of the force intended for China is to be much regretted, but it is satisfactory to consider that the delay it occasions in the settlement of the ' Canton question' does not appear likely to create nmore extended differences between ourselves and the Chinese. Our intercourse with the Chinese in the north continues on the same friendly footing as previotus to the disturbances in the South, and the prospect of a most flourishing trade being carried on at Shanghai in exports and imports is favourable. Late accounts irom the Canton River do not mention anything particular occurring there. Her Majesty's steamer Nimrod, Captain Dew, arrived here on the 17th inst. She has since proceeded, in company with Her Majesty's steamer Hornet, to the north. Hls Excellency Admiral Guerin left this for France or the 15th inst., in His Imperial Majesty's ship Virginie. Pekin (azetb-s come down to the 15th June, but do not contain anythingofinterest. His Imperial Majesty's ship Capricieuse was at Ningpo. The Portuguese Consul had removed for safety on board. In the late affray 45 Portuguese are said to have been killed, and of the opposite side six Canton men and one Englishman. The notorious pirate Apak had anchored his fleet off Ningpo, and threatened to take the place if he was attacked by the French steamer.

IBBLAND. (FROM OUR OWN CORTLO.mmrA DJEBLI, FmAuy MORNTiG. THE PIOCLAIDNG OF BFAST. The special reporter of the Freeman, writing last night from Belfast, thus describes the state of feeling confsequent upon the disgrace of the capital of Ulster being placed for its misdeeds under the stringent provisione of the Orime and Outrage Act The proclamation by the Lord-Lieutenant in Council of Belfast, although it was to some extent anticipated here, has caused no small amount of sensation, followed by a feeling of shame and sorrow at the degradation that has thus been brought down upon so important and prosperous a eonanunity. It seems to be generally admitted that this strong proceeding on the part of the Executive was urgently demanded by the disorganization of society, the interference with industry, and the outrages upon person and property which have been going on here since the ast July anniversary, whose recurrence has, for years and years past, been the recognized period for the revival of discord and tile perpetration of se.ious crimes against law and order' in Ireland, The Government are making extendve preparations to carry into effect the proclamation of the Privy CounciL There will be a general rearching for arms after Friday, the 18th, from which day tho proolainaon will take effect, but already as the pelioe are Informed) arms are being sent out to the country disticts, and buried and otherwise concealed in the town. 600 men and officers of the 30th Begiment arrived here yesterday evening. 50 constabulary have come from Wetmneath and Kildare counties under Subinspectors Fleming and Falloon, making that force now In Belfast more than 410 strong. The military have been also reinforced by three officers and 46 men of the 3d Dragoons. Both braaches of the servioe, it is understood, will be further strwngthened, so that there is ample guarantee for the preservation of the peace, and the additions may not be unnecessary, for it is not improbable that resistance would be offered to the expeoted disarming of the disturbed dlstricts, if tbe persons were not deterred by a large array of troops and constabuary. The Privy Council proclamation is posted all orer the town, and there is appended to it, for the information of the inhabitants, an abstract of the Act aboutto be put in operation. A constabulary officer informed we last night that he heard there were men collectiug in the Pound district for the purchase of powder. Peace is restored. Both psrties are afraid to come into collision with the strong bodes of constabulary who are patrolling, and who, itis known, will nzre upon comparatively less pro. vocation or rioting than wvould be tolerated under different circurustances." The reporter of Saunders's Newsletter writes under the same date as follows v- ".The proceedings before the Government Commissioners contiaue to attract the greatest amount of attention from the public at large. The court-house is daly crowded with iost attenive lsteners, and in the streets the points broight out in evidence are earnestly discussed. 'The proclamntion of the Lord-Lieutenant and Privy Councilp A igBelfast andthesubarb ofBallymacourtunder theprovisions of the Peace Preservation (Ireland)Act of 1816, was only posted this inorning, but its nature was pablicly knowr since Tuesday morning. To-morrow it comes into operation, r nd the belligerents who had so long held the town in terror are now busily engaeed either in burying their guns according to John Mitchel's receipt, ' nicely wrapped up in oiled flannel,' or sending them to their friends beyond the boundarieg of the proclaimed district, or returning them to the warehouse fromv which they hired them or bought themr; whilo in many other intauces they 'pop'them rnider the safe keepig of their male relatives up that repository popularly called 'the spout.' AU is commotion in the ranks of the rioters on both sides. But a few daring spirits are determined, I hear, to have their weapons at hand in somne cunning place of concealment, to brave the rigour of the search which is to bh instituted, with the penalty of two years' imprisonment that follows upon conviction. Shots continue to be fired even yet, but they are few and far between as compared with the fusUlades of Saturday and Sunday nights last. The cannon are silent in Sandy-row, and in the now notorious locality called the Pound ; but the animosity-the odium thcologi-um-is as intense as ever, The town is filled with constabulary and soldiers, infantry and cavalry, but the latter have not been called from their barracks this week. Never, since the disastrous period of 1798, did the town present the same deplorable signs of internecine strife, and it is sincerely to be hoped it never wlIL" A temperate Protestant journal, commenting upon the Belfast orgies, and the Government measures for their repressiou, justly remarks:- "It was qite right tha,t this unholy warfare should be suppressed, a;nd that all parties should learn that the law must be obeyed. The pastime of murder for the love of God will not be longer borne with. We will not, so far from the scene of riotingg, hazard any opinion as to who were the original transgressors. The organs of each party defend their lambs, and proclaim loudly and boldly tbht the Protestants or Cathorlcs, as the caae may be, were not the transgressors, and that the other party fired the first shot or threw the first stone. That wi be breugbt to light hereafter, but both parties now see pretty clearly that the amusement will nok be tolerated any longer, and that they must all resume their honest labour, i: they have an;; but whether or not they must contri,e to live peaceably together, and respect the law of the laud.

TEB INDIAN MUTINIES. THlE MASSACRE AT CAWNPORBE TO THE BDITOR OF TE TIMES. Sir,-A8 the accompanying is the firat authentic acoount that I have read of the horrible tragedy at Cawnpore, I send it to you for publication if you think fit, and I hope that the horrors it depicts will awaken the minds of the most mawkish to the necessity and justice of deep vengeance. Vniirst fqitl.fn1ll L B,th, Sept. 17. se Ca-upore, July 18. "My own dearest Brother,-God Almighty has been graiousy pleaed to Bpre my poor life. I am the only individual saved among al the European and Christian community that inhabited this sttion. Mypoor dear wife. my darling sweet child Polly, poor dear Rebec and her childron, and poor innocent children Emnielina and Martha, as also old Mm Frost and poor Mr Osborne, were 1l most inhumanly butchered by the cruel insmagents on the day before yesterday, and thrown into a-vell4 together with a great number of other ladies and children, reported to be about 150 in number. I am distracted. I am most miserble and wretohed. I am like one in a dream. Yoa could not recognize me if you saw me. My life ha been spared by a miracle. The Will of the Lord be done. He alo0ne ean give mecomfort, or I am in a terrblse sate of disre of mind. "I will vrite you a detailed account of aU our sufferings nd di3rses, such ditres as has never before been experienced or heard of on the face of this earth. At present I cannot write, I cannot eat or drink-I am perfectly wrtchhe "I escaped only yeaterday from my miserable prlion where I had been confined with heavy fetters on my legs for 24 days by the rebels, who nearly iook aWay my life, buGod alone prevented them and spared me. They gave m, only parched pain to eat daily, and that in very small quantities. "he EAglish troops have come In and rstored pce. They have retaken Cawnpore. Their arrival here yeter. day was the means of my releae, as my term of imprison. ment was threeyears withhardlabour. The enemy hadfrom 10,000 to 15,000 troops, and have done great destruction; but the British, with 2,400 2Eropeans and 700 Silkhs have driven them away, and not a soul of them is to be seen now anywhere. "I know not whether those few lines will reach you, nor do I know if you and your dear children at Agra are still In the land of the living. But I have made this effort to send this letter in the earnest hope that it will reach yJO I it ,do I beg you will send me a reply per bearer, and also write by post, if such Is establshed by that time. " Every office and soldier and every merchant, writer, or Christian drummer, &o., that had gone into the intrench. ments here under General Wheeler on the 4th of June, has been killed. The cannonading of the enemywas very, very severe. Twelve guns, taken from our magazine, were brought to play upon us. They had a very g quantity of powder at their disposal, for the magazine was no; blown up, and S0 boats' of ammunition reached the enemy bytheGanges C0nal just in time for them to annoy us. The artillery barracks, where we were intreuched, have been scattered to atoms by the 24-pounder bails that were inoes. santly fired by the eneray, and many died under the walls. Day and night the guns were kept playing upon us without ceasing for a moment, and the musketry of the enemy poured rillions of blUs upon us up to the 25th of Junethat is for 20 days. The enemy made several attempts to chaRrge upon us; three times they surrounded us on all sides under cover of the compound walls of bungalows in our vicinity, and sounded their bugles to charge, but were driven beck by our artillory firing canister upon them. We had only six ema gUns with us, and not a eingle howitzer. " Had we even had one 24-pounder a great deal could have been done, or had our General taken up his positioa in tEa magazine we might all have escaped the very severe calamity that has befallen upon this station, for without guns the enemy could not have done anything. On the 24th of June I was sent out as a spy" on oer. tain conditions, and as I was ressed like a common Chinaman I was not kiled; for I was taken prisoner almos. as soon as I came out of the intrenchment, particulars o' which I shall give you in my next, but kept in confinement until the day of my trial, when fetters were put oa me as stted above. After I camo out on the 24th it appears the rebel Rajah sent a letter to our General the day after, offeriDng to let him and all his people go to Allahabhd, on oondition that he would give up all his tsre, ammmun tion, &o., and vacate Cawupore within three days. Thls was accepted by the General, and the usual oaths were taken that no treachery would be used. The IRajah supplied 24 boats and gave carriage to the river side. On the morning of the 27th our people went on board the boats-Oh ! how I felt, when in confinement I heard that the English were going in safety. I could not keep my secret, and told the Subadar of the prison guard that I was a Christian, and nearly lost my life by this exposure, of which more hereafter ;)-but had not time to let the boats go, when the enemy fired cannon upon them, and upset some; others they set fire to. Only one boat I am told managed to get away, but was afterwards picked up at a short distance and brought baok. About 160 women and children, and about 100 Europeau soldiers and officers and men of all classes were taken aliv The former were kept as prisoners up to the 16th of July, but the men (among whom was our poor Danild) had their hands tied behind them, were kiUed with swords and muskets, and thrown into a ditch. The women received parched grainfor afew days, but afterwards they got daU and chit patios in small quantities. The ralsess have bad motives for sparing them so long. II At the time of their being murdered (on the 16th inst.) I am told that a number jumped alive into the well thaS was intended to receive their corpses rather than be butchered and insulted so unmercifully as the hard-hearted brutes were using them. " Oh J when I think of it how my heart breaks. I get beside myself, and wish I had not been spared to hear of such dreadful accounts. Oh! my poor dear Polly! how must they have killed you. So sweet a child never existed. How will I ever forget you! The faces of all I have lost are ever before me. Oh ! how dreadful is my state of mind. God Almighty have mercy on me ! Oh, God, help Thou me, whom Thou hast spared. "Thine affectionate, but miserable, " H. J. SHEPHERD. "P.S.-My infant vas shotin the head by a spent musket. ball on the 12th of June, while we were in the intrench. ments, and died in great agony after 48 hours. I was also wounded on the 7th of June with a spent musket-ball in the back, and very nearly lost my life, but I soon got over it. The wound is now nearly healed. "H . J. S." "Thaccooraneet is alive. She was all the time with us in the intrenchment, bat got off on the day the boats were supplied by the Rajah. Every house in the station has been destroyed by fire. I had not a fraction left. I am taken care of at present by my office treasurer, who also is very kind to me." DELII. The following is an extract from a letter of an officer in the Bengal Engineers:- " Camp before Delhi, July 15. "Things are going on very slowly here. It is now more than five weeks since our arrival, aud we are stilU as far ohf taking the place as ever. Our nearest works are nearly a mile off the town, and there seems to be no chance of any advance being made. The Pandies (as the mutineers ara called) come out every third or fourth day and attack us in force,when all our men are turned out, and a fight of several hours' duration takes place, in which a great deal of ammunition is expended, from 50 to 100 of our men killed and wounded, and 300 or 400 of the Pandles. In one of these affairs yesterday three Engineer officers were wounded, among whom was Carnegie, who was grazed by a bullet in the am. We arc, however, suffering a great deal more from oholera than from the enemy's fire. In one regiment (the 61st Qaeen's) seven men died in one day from it. It Is now the rainy sesson, and t'he mnen ont on duty get vet, have to remain in their wet clothes for several hours, come home, and are cartied off in a few hours. An Engineer officer named Walker died a day or two ago in less than 24 hours after he was taken ill. You' will have heard that General BarnarI died of cholera on the 5th inst General Reed now con- mnands the force; he is, however, an old man, and very sickly, so that most of the duty devolves upon Brigadier Chamberlain, who is considered a very good officor. Oar strength at present cousists of about 5,000 effective men, of whom 2600 are English infantry, 1,000 native infantry (Sikhs and Ghoorkas), and 1,500 cavalry3nd rtillery. The enemy is about 20,000 strong. It Is reported that there are 4,000 Europeans at Allyghur (60 miles from Delhi) under General Wheeler, on their way to reinforce us. Sir Patrick Grant is also on his way up to take the coipmand. As soon * The writer, Mr. Shepberd, is supposed, from the tenor of his letter, and his having gone oat as a " Chinaman" spy, to be an Enrasian clerk in Government employ, most lilcely in the treasuy. The rebel ILsjah he speaks of 1- " Neu," the adopted son of the late Peishfa, but not acknowledged by the British Government as his heir. The writer seems not to have b~een aware that General Sir H. Whecler waas mortally wounded (if not dead) before the 8urrender, else most probably such amender would never have been allowed by him. t An Ay sh, it is tonjectured, as reinforcements arrive I fancy we shall go In And take DelhL "July 16. "I had to go off on duty yesterday, So could not finish this letter. I was at work with 200 pioneers at our Inost advanced post, called the 'Ram Summy House,' About 700 yards from the walls of Delhi We could plainly distinguish the Pandies at work on their batteries, ad also watching us. They sent In severd shot very near us, but happily no one was wounded. Whenever we are work- ing inder fire a man Is stationed on the look-out, who, as| soor. as he sees the smoke of a gun from the city, calls out, ' Look out P when everybody immediately duckg down behind the nearest cover, and as soon as she shot has gone past up they get again and go on with their work. The most I disagreeable things are the shells, as after the smoke is seen it takes a minute or two before they reaoh the ground, and, as they come down vertically, it is impossible to get out of their way. Y You will see by the papers better than I can tel you the progress of the rebellion over all this part of India. Almost every native regiment that could has mutinied, in many cases murdering their officers. Daily accounts of some more regiments revolting come in, and, as they make for Delhi at once, the number of Pandies in the town is increasing every day. The only natlve regiments in which we put any faith are the Sikhs and tha Ghoorkas. Theee, how. ever, are famous fellows, fighting splendidly, sad even in some ces outdoing the Europeans. We had a very hrd fight on the 9thinst., lading almostthewholeday. We lost 258 killed and wounded. On the 14th our los wasu212, chiefly wounded. I have only just heard these retns; they are greater than I expeced. " Colonel Baird Smith is ourChief Engineer; he was sent for from Roorkee. Our streagth is upwards of 20 officers. We all live and mess together, in one of the unburnt bun. galowv, in cantonments. We are very fortunate in tis reapoct,aa everybody else in camp is under cmanvs, whi must be-rather unpleasant now that the raina have st in. Lately I have been out blowing up a good many bridges in the neighbourhood of the camp to prevent the Pandies getting into our rear. " On these expeditions a party of Sappers, eosortd by about 100 Sikbs and 60 nativ cavalry, go out to the bridge (generally from three to eight miles distant from the camp). a mnine is then dug In the pier of the bridge, two or thre barrels of powder put in, and then exploded, Thene eXPe. clitions are very pleasant, as the oountry about the anab is beautifully wooded, and It is a great relief to get out of camp for a short time. This, however, is provided it does not rain. Aboat a week ago I went out with a p1ty to blow up an aqueduct three miles distant. We started about 2 p.m., and returned about 12 at night drenched thrgh and thoroughly miserable, it having rained the whole time. Our tutn of duty comes on every 24 hours. We have 10 hours on duty and then 22 off The night duty Is tihe worst, It is so difficult to keep awake. At times your eyellds will close, however you yeay try to keep them open; and it is absolutely neessary to look after the men the whole time, as otherwise they ae certain to go off to aleep, avd then nothing is done. "We ae by no mens badly off in the living vmsy. having a very comfortable mee I don't dislike our mannor of life,-the only grief is being kept here by a lo o villainous mutineers. As soon, however, as reinforcements come up we sball pay them out in fine style. " P.8-The other day C-, of the 2dFuslleers, with his men, burst open the door of a house in which were a lot of Pandiea. C- 'as In fronit when the door gave way, and down he fell into the house with It. Lucky for him, Asa Pandy blazed away at him from the inside, bit the ball went over his head. G- then tried bis revolver at the mutineer, but it would not go off so he ran him through with his sword. His men then weat in and finished off the rest of the Pandies in the house. " The general opinion in camp is that we coul take Delhi by asault any day we like, but as it Is so lage oar al torce would not bq able to hold it. We are snug enough here, and are making our position stronger every day by COn* atructing new batterles." The following is from an Artillery officer:- "Camp, Delhi, July 25. "There is not much difference in the atate of affairs here since I ast wrote, and I wish I could siy the serne of other parts of the country-Oude and about there. We have heard but lame accounts, but In maxy places all the Europeans have been murdered indiscriminately. We have had eight or ten small engagements with the Pandies, but moet of them very unsatisfactory ones. It generally ends in our troops fnding themselves under the walls of the city and coming under the grape of their heavy guns. Oa the whole, I think at present we have lost 32 oficers eithekilled or died of cholera, whiLch ha carried off several lately-o_. -or-two -friends of mine, poor fellows-(it b a wretched graveyard to lie in) the yictims of these accursed traitors. Before long I hope Providence will aveuge the loes of some of our bravest and our best. The men I think look well, much more so than I have often seenthem look at this season of the year in cantonments, and I hope they wiU continue so; the excitement, of course, k-eeps them up, but they get very tired of this bush-fight. ing, the jungle Is so very thick that it Is most unsatis. factory- work, and they dread so being left behind, poor fellows; one or two have been unfortunately, and their heads are cut off and paraded through the city. We have got large reinforcements coming both from the north and south, and It is but a matter of time. They are falULg very short of caps, and thelr powder, which they are making themselves, is very inferior. We tooka lot of saltpetre, too, the other day, which will limit the quantity they used to make-viz., eight barrels per diem. I have not received your letters for the last three mails and am very anxiously looking out for them. I gave very particular instraction5 about forwarding them. I continue very well and jolly. Ihave left the heavy batteries, which was reaUy very heavy work, and am now with Tumner's troop of Horse Artillery. Wg take the picket duties, and I am on every third day nov., and ge' two in camp; but when here you cannot move about far-the alarm is constantly sounding, and we have to go out to our respoctive posts. We have the rains now, which makes it very pleasant, as the heat is very great in the day, and I don't know how often my hands and fa have beer. peeled. What a glorious campaign it wM be for those who live to fight it this next cold season, hunting down these wretches and exterminating them. At helum, Sealkote, and other places where they have bht lately mutinied the Sepoys have been nearly aU Cut up, and those that have escaped are gradnaUy being sent in from diffarent places to be hung. How weU this state of things has been foretold by Lord E1Uenborough and others; but how little we thought we should see it in our time ! In Oude a great many have been cut up, principally in the smaU out stations. But the communications are stil cut off; all our news from below comes through Bombay and Lahore, except now and then a cossed (or messenger) finds his way disguised as a fakeer from Agra, but their reports are very exaggerated. We ought to be allowed a year at home after this is over, but I fear we shan'tget it. We know of the China troops being on their way up, bat we can't ascertain where. I don't think anything decisive can be done for the next month. We could go into the city any time we liked with but little more loss than we have every time weget underthewaUs, but then what are we to do when we are there? We have not men enough to hold it and defend our camp here. They have latterly been trying hard to get at us again in the rear, but we have blown up aU their bridges, and effectually stopped them. My things have not come down here yet, but we are pretty comfortable. We all wear as much flannel as we can. I often amuse mysetE with sketching, but was stupid enough to leave my colours at Lahore. Gholab Singh is going to send us a lot of his rabble. I would much sooner be without them. However, they hate the Pandies. All our wounded are doing well. The greater part who can have gona t. Simlah, where I hope they will soon pick up. We are act. Ing now merely on the defensive, and fire as little as possible only now and then, to inducoe them to waste their ammu nition." The foUowing is an ent from a letter from a| Staff officer of rank in the Camp before Delhi, dated Jtily 26 - " Here, you see, we are still before Delhi, and no immediate prospect of our fiding ourselves inside the waill oi the city. Since I last wrote just the same kind of thing hba been going on as before; attacks on our position evezy third or fourtrt day or so, always terminating in the same result-the entire repulse and discomfiture of the enemy, and often with great loss, but never vithout a greater number of casualties on our side than with our small force we can well afford. The newsletters from the city describe the mutineers to be much disheartened at their constant want of success; and no doubt it maust be so, for their attacks of late have become mnuch more feeble, and a3 each day is adding to the strength of our defenoes, no fear whatever is felt of their being able to rnake any impreusion otn then. You will hardly be prepared, I dare say, at home to hear of our still remaining on the defensive, the besieged, in fact, instead of the besiegers; but so it has been I may say, from the day of our arrival here, and when the etrength of our little army is known people will be the less surprized to find such to be the case, It looks mighty well on paper-six regiments of Europeans, and four of native infantry (Sikbs and Ghoorkas), and I have no doubt the number is set down at 10,000 men, but the real etrength is probably inder 4,000-ay, 2,400 Europeans, and the remainder natives. I have not seen the returns lately, but I think I must be above the mark in saying we have 4,000 infantry. In artillery we are fortun t 1y tolerably well off, but in cavalry the enemy perhap; outnumber us by fire to one. It is as well tbat they are a most unenterprising set of sooundrels, the cavalry, or they might do us infinite damage in cutting of r our supplies, As it is, our rear is perfectly open, and sup_ plies are as plentiful and cheap as they would be in the best i iepulated cantonment4. You Vill ask impatiently wbat we &re going to do, and how long we are to remain in our pro. Feut position. I am not in the General's secret4, bat I fancy there is no doubt that we shall do nothing towards attaokiug the place until we receive considerable reinforoementg Matters aro in smch a distracted state below that though troops are known to have marched from AllAhabad on tke 4th of this month they may have so much to do at Cawupore, Luoknow, and elsewhere that we Ilmost give up the hope of their reaching us in reasonable tirne, and ve therefore look forward to the large foroe now on its way from tho Panjab to join u. All ought to be here about the 32th or 15th proximo, and then we sall bestrong enoug& to set to work in earnest with the wretched city, The troops coming down amount altogether to some 4,000 infautry, of whom about 1,400. are European and the rest Ghoorks and Sikha. There are also artillery and cavalry, and another siege train with icavier guns 'han we now have, ancl oar force wil on the whole very nearly be doubled, certainly so in infantry, in which we are now comparatively weakest. We have only to pray that siokness may not overtake us here before thene fresh troops arrive, and there Is every hope that it nray not be so, s the sickly eason seldom commonos here before the middle of September or later, -when the rains eave off At present there does notappear to be more ick. ness thnuthere wloold be wre the men quietly located in 'heir barracks, and several of the regiments, the com. manding officers idli me, are positively healthler than they probibly would be in cAntonments When once our fresh troops are here I should think a week ought to put US in posDasion Of tho city, and onoe iA t the Pal and Old Fort could not hold out a day. itt wib a great advantage oertinly if three or four European 2V raents joinus from below, but this I think is hardly to be expected, unless it is determined to abandon Luoknow aZA all the Country on the left bank of the Ganges-that Is, Bohn. cund and Oude. We should then have only Cawupore and Futtyghur to hold in any force, and all the troops not required for tho defenoe of thLese places might move up to us. By the latest accounts from Lucknow, but which are only up to the 2d July, all was right there, and Sir I. LAwrence had some 700 Europeans of Her MA. jests 32d, and part of the 84th, but he was "aost confined to the intrencbments he had made, and I should doubt, when all the mUtinous regiments of Oude gathered round him, his belng able to hold his own for many wedks Havelock, however, ought to be with him in good thni. The letest intelligence from him is of the 1lth, and he was then said to be on his march, and within 40 miles of Cawn. pore. The strength of his force is not mentioned, but I should doubt its being more than 2,000 infantry with perhaps nine guns and a very small party of cavalryquite sufficient, however, to thrash any force he u likely to mneet of the enemy. More European regiments mus, however, be on their way from Allahbad to join Ub6 The acounts we have from Cawnpore, Also, I am sorry to sky, from Futtyghur, re very bad; but they are merely the reports of natives, and we stil cling to the hope that they may not be true. They are to the effect thatat both places after holding out a very long time Against enormous odds, our small garrisons took to the river in boats, but were at. tacked there, overpowered, and nearly all killed. This new about Futtyghur only came in this morning, that about Cawnpore about a week ago; but you may imagine how defetive our communioation is when you heaf tht ft was upward& of three weeles before the intelligence of the Cawvpore catastrophe reached us.

There seems no end of the shot and shell they have in Delhi, and of guns, too, they have au unlimited number, but their powder is said to be expended. They make it, of course, but it is not so good as ours, and their stock of pereussion caps is reported as coming to a close. It is to he hoped that it is so, for these theynever ean manufacture, and their only plan will be to alter the locks for flints" THIE BATTLE AT JHELUML The following is a letter from an officer serving in the Punjab, " Camp Goojerat, July 15. "There has been a sad affair at Jhelum. Three companies of my regiment were sent down from Raoul Pindee, under Colonel Eflieo, with some Horse Artillery, to dis arm the 14th Native Infantry. " This regiment was drawn up on its owvn parade ground when our force arrived, and, seeing them approach, loaded, fired at their officers (luckily withoat effect), and bolted off to their barracks, guardhouses, &e Colone Ellice immediately gave the word to charge, which was done in gallant style, but our poor men were shot down right and left by the murderous fire of the Sepoys, who took advantage of their wover to fire without being themselves exposed; they were, bowvever, after some hard fighting, driven out of their position, and then made for a neighbouring village, where the coverwas equally advautageous for them. ThispositRon our men, asiisted by three guns, also drove them from, bnt with fearful sacrifice to our side, the Sepoys fightiag like fiends and disputing every inch of ground. They were at Ast put to flight, bat, having very fevr eavalry, and those bardly to bo trusted, they could not be pursued, and so those who were not killed eseaped into tbe jungle. Iregret to say that we lost one officer iu this affair, Captain Spring. Colonel EUice was dangerously wounded through the chest while gallantly leading the charge. Poor young Streathfield. the bravest of tho brave, got a baullet through both knees, smashing the right one to atoms and going through the other, The right leg was amputated at the thigh, and he is now pro. gresang, I hopo and trust, satisfactorily. Chiebester was shot through the left arm, but is doing well De Montmorency got off with a bullet through his trowsers, another shooting away his soabbard; but he was not hurt himself. Sam BUrnS ha3 his cheek grazed by a ball. The other officer, Captain Macpherson, got off scot free. The officers here named were the only ones present &hJhelnun at the time; I wasat Raoul Pindee, but as soon as thoenews arrived by telegraph reinforcements were sent down immediately, I among the number, but when we had gone half way to Jhelum an order camne recalling us, as the action ws all over; I however got leave to como on, and arrived the morning after.

The Government at home Would confer a great benefit and a great boon upon those who have not revolven if they were to sanction an ise of them." BENARES. The following are extracts from a letter wrtten by a staff officor reoently at Dinapore. The dates ae as recent as the 3d of August- Bena"es, July 22. "As for news, it is no use mentioning what the papers will hbave, viz., that Havelock hus just destroyed Bitthoe;r and taken 13 more guns there, and Is en route to Lucnow, erdAeng the Ganges to-day. AUl the women were kldled by the Nena in batches, so many a-day. He violated all be eould first, and Dent the rest naked into his eamp for the men; at Jhanai they tied the husbands to trees while the usme atrocities were in proces, and tore the children 11mb by limb. They've made mothers ldl their owni chUdren, and tbat sort of thing. Poor old - (a civilian) was daintily stabbed on six bayonets, and carried round kicdking, and then killeL It Is as well to tell these thing, Which don't half come up to the untelable atrocities of the way in which ladies were tortured and exposed, because the more you all know in England the better, as for want of cavalry these wretches get very little cut:up now, and they must be puoashed afterwards in cold blood. They had stiff fighting at Cawanpore, the 78th mena howling in the most appalling manner on account of the women and children as they closed with the enemy. The Nena has gone to Humeerpore. Loyd, the collector there, was murdered. Clarke (J. T., the assistant surgeon) Is here; CockereU was kiled at Bands. They've discovered an attempt at a rising here, and got a 'nmahajun,' out oE whose house came 150 'tulwars,' &c., and also 'boned' four of the head 'budmashes.' We're clearing a spot at Raj Ghat, which is a natural fortification, and whence we shall get howitzers to command the eity. We shall have it all our own way now if Bombay keeps quiet, as the 5th Fusiloers and 37th are on the river, and will make Havelock strong enough for anything. He drives them like sheep as It is, but the punishment of these fiends is the thing that will take time; the Government is too mild, the authorities in Caloutt still potter and humbug. " The rising was a Mussulann plot, aided by the Brahmins; religion had nothing to do with it beyond their hatred for us Kaffi. The Nena was anlmated by personal pique. Government orders spoiled our regiments in making officers fools and men insolent. Government actually the last few yeas have been oonstautly asking the Sepoys to dictate to them, forbidding 'havildan' or 'naicks' being punished, allowing appeals against commauding officers' slightest punishments, and asldng the men. whose hair has been cut for 20 years, if seeing the Sikhb with long hair isn't likely to raie mutiny in their elegat boeems." " Auguti. " You'll see by tho papers that the Dlnapore brigade have mutinied; they are on the road at Sasseram. The whole thing was disgrcefully mismanaged, and - ought to be hung. After themen had shown a mutinous spirit be sentamessage thathewanted thoirpercusion caps, instead of sending the 10th Foot to disarm them. Penwick, commanding the 10th, pointed out the necessity, but the stupid incapable wouldn't sae The evil of it is, besides a few more murders in the district (that we're used to), that the troops that thould be reinforcing Havelock are now warted to clear the Grand Traunk Road and punish t;hee fellovs Havelock carries all before him, and has taken 64 guns already. Having only 1,500 with him. there will be a narrow thing of it to reinforce him iu time Humanly speaking, it he gets reinforced by the 5th and 90th soon, all will go well enough till you comf ortablo people at home send some 20,000; but if things go wrong in these parts and delay his reinforcements Agra will go yet. We disarmed the remnant of the 12th Irregulars here last night, and the wing of the 2r5th Native Infantry, just arrived, Is to be disarmed. The district here Is quiet, buS there are so maun mutineers between us and Calcutta and Oude-wards, that some sort of scrimmage in the neighbourhood is likely. Holues's corps of Irregulars mutinied and cut him and the doctor and their wives into bits This shows what bosh it is talking of paucity of officers, or want of soldierly knowledge on their part. Holmes's corps was acknowledged by all hands to have been the most perfect body of light horse in the world, and Holmes, like Poor Fisher, only lived for his men, and loved them-seo the result ! " It is an implacable hatred to us as a nation, the timid policy of a Government who tolerate and cherish idolatry and Miahomodaniem, and rather persecute their own religion, invariably disclaiming having any religion themselves, asking (by their aots) the natives to advance prejudices ani find grievances, degrading their officers, and talking of Black Acts and sending natives to Parliament and making civilians of them, the Commander-in-Chief taking 20 petitions a-day agalist commanding officers, begging the Jacks to find out that they ought to mutiny because their boards, shaved without a murmur for 40 years, are sllaved still. These things, pampering the Sopoys, and above all the breaking out of a long-ckerished Muesulman plot, are the real causes of this row, and if you'd hint the same to the editor of The Timns you'd be an useful member of society. Just heard that the loyal (!) brigade of Sepoys are making along the Ganges, leaving the roads open. If Lloyd does not mismanage and Havelock gets more men we shall go on swimmingly; nothing will prevent our final success, but thlings are very critical just Dnw. This station is the safest hi Lower India, I think; some rows may happen, but we are oue ot the safest positions in the country. We are masking no eid of fine entrenchments at Raj Ghat-it's the strongest natural position I ever sawr." " August 3. " Just come back- from Raj Ghat. Three 18-pounders and two 24-pounders just arriving from Chunar, and ditto and some mortars to come from Allahabad Wo have just heard very bad news. Havelock is obliged to suspend his advance. He say he has only 700 effective men left As it is impossible that he can be reinforeod from this side for a. fortnight it is a regular fix. Both his force and Lucknow look very fishy. It is the worst news we've had yet. If it had not been for General -'s fatuous idiotoy strong reinforcements wonld have been past Allahabad already. I really should not wonder if that Dinapore folly does not end by losing Lucknow, HIavelock, and Agra. Five or ix of the mutineers ct the Sikh corps here (the dril men) were discovered,"through the evidence of the Sikhs who remained faithful, to be in the Benares RajaW's service. A. oouxrt-martal is sitting now, and they will all hanged, no doubt. The R ajah has been intriguing, and is under surveillance. We reinforced Chunar last night; the fellows passed onr bungalow singing one of the most ringing English-soundlug choruses you could imagine. It drives one savage to think of -'s periUing Haveloek by his ldiotic belief in the three Sepoy corps ; they are now hemmed in by the detachment of the 5th Fusileersand two gUns who went to Baxar by steamer, landed and went down the road, and the 10th from Dinapore coming up; but whether they will not get away by a cross road which exista is, I fear, a probable contingency. They kiUed the collector of Arrab, and 50 SLkha who were his guard, Hero we shall be impregnable, worst come to the worst, but I am very anxious to know aboaS higher up. If they could only i kt Delhi Havelock might be relieved. More news just in. ThL detachment from Diapore came ontherbels.

T'H FORT OF AGBA. TO TEE EDITOR OF THEI TIMES. Sir,-As tho rumonrsrespecting tho safety of our country. men in Agra are of a gloomy character, and calculated to cause unnecessary and unfounded alarm to their relAtives and friends, 1 beg to place at your disposal positive information from that fort up to the 22d of July, received by the Marseilles portion of the mail yesterday, and contained in a letter from an officer of the Civil Service, holding a a high position at Agra. At that date the garrison were in good spirits and health, provisons and ammunition abundant. There wer6 no rumours of attacks from any quarters, nor the presence in the vicinity of Agra of any hostile force; but they were anxiously looking out for the arrival of reinforcementha As regards the strength of the fort and its capabilities of defence a lengthened residence and a thorough acquaintance with Agra enable me to add that there is no chance of their being overpowered, for the fort has guns of the heaviest calibre which completely command the city of Agra and all approaches by which assailants could attempt an attaek. The quarrels of the Sheeans and Sunnees during the Mohurrum Festival are far more likely to tend towards the peace of the garrison than to create alarm, for the towns. people of those persuasions will have enough to do to settle their own religious broils, without attempting an ineffectual attack against a force prepared on all sides to resist them. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. C NTUiION. Y crsaiUes, Sept. 17.
CHOLERA AND FAMUE AT SONSONALTE.-The following letterfrom the agent to Lloyd's at Sonsonate, Re. public of' Guatemala, has produced a very painful feeling in the city, and the suggestion contained therein will, it is to be hoped, be promptly carried out:-- Sonsonate, July 28, 1857.-Cholera is now raging throughout San Salvador. Already, a tenth of the population of the capital have fallen victims wbile inSonsonateup to this day some 650 have died. It was brought to this republic by the troops just returned from Nicaragua, first breaking ont on their extending through this unfortunate country. What is the more distressing Is the want of medical men, several cittes containing a poDulation of from 8,000 to 10,000 Indians and others bsingwithout medical men or even medicines. It is stated that the cholera is sutbiding bhut we dread a famine, which in these countries is a fearul visitation. Could not a subecription be gathered under the patronage of Lloyd's for the relief of the unfortunates ? [ am sure the merohants of London would contribate. I am dispensing medicines a, my own expense and bread every Saturday to a hoat of recipients, but I am obliged to send many away hungry and starving from want of the means of assisting them. In San Salvador (the capital) the dead bodies were placed in piles and burnt, the authorities not having had time to dig pits for their interment, while in other towns instances bave occurred where the bodies have been left in the cemeteries uncovered, to be devoured by the vultures, which are hovering over our heads from morning till night. Business, as a m#ter of course, is entirely suspended, and on passing through the streets one only encounters pale panic-stricken faces peering from the doors and windo ws, while the occasional ories from such families as have lost a relative are positively heartrending. That a famine will follow is certain; for, it being the rainy season, such is the dread of exposure dmringthe epidemic that the maize crop is rotting in the fields. The principal sufferers also are the Indians, who form the only field labourers; consequently the crops will not be gathered. I therefore knov of no occasion more worthy of the commiseration of tho Britislh public, and trust that steps will be taken to raise a subscription on behalf of these poor people. Tbe locusts in 1854 and 1855 and the Fhilbuster war of 1856 and 1857 have tended to accelerate the general misery. which the cholera Is now consunmmating in a most fearful manner.

M3UTTNY IN INDIA .-THfE RELIEF FUND. ETRI NOITTA %f A public meeting of the inhabitants, called by the Mayor, was held inthe committee.roomn of the Town-hallyesterday, to commence a subscription for the relief of those made destituto by the Indian revolt. There was a large and influential attendance. The Mayor, Mr. Ratcliff, presided; and among those present were Mr. Scholefleld, M.P., Mr. Spooner, MsfP., and thno Hon. and Rev. GP. 1A Yorke. After the Town Clerk had read several letters enclosing donations, The Hon. and Rev. G. M. YORKE said he felt that words were powerless to express the deep feelings which all must entertain at the present crisis regarding the horrible suffer. ings entailod upon onr felowr conntrymen in India. He ditd not believe that in the annals ot this or any otber country such miseries or snch cruelties could be traced. The resolntion he had to move contained an eexpression of their rympathy with their suffering fellow-countrymen, and no doubt this would afford some alleviation of their miseries - but he thought their motto on that occasion should be "Deeds, not words." (Hear.) Mr. SCHOLEMFULD, M. P., said he agreed with his hon. and rev. friend that that was not a time for words, but a time for deeds, and he owned that in touching on the sub. ject at all It was so oppressive that he knew not iri what words to describe the feeiings which he shared in common, he was sure, with every gentleman in the room. The Ac. counts which they read in the daily papers, frightful s they were, did not approach the trath. (Elear.) The authentio statements he had seen of the crimes committed by these in. furiated Sepoys, and the miseries endured by officers and civilians, their wives, and children, were something incredi. ble, something which was unparalleled in the annals of history. He did not believe that at any period of time, however uneivilized, or in any country, however barbarous, such atrocities had even been conceived, much less put in practice, as those which had marked the recent few months in India. (Hear.) He had seen letters describing the arrival in Calcutta of women and children deprived not only of every vestige of property, but of every friend and relative, and left so utterly destitute as to have to rely solely upon the bounty of those in CalcuttA and the prospective assistance of their countrymen at home. The one bright spot in all the accounts which had come home was the heroic courage, the patience in suffering, exhibited by our countryman. It was something to make one proud of the name of Englishman when they read letters from officers, subalterns, private soldiers, and even from ladies (who were among the bravest of the lot, as they were unquestionably the deepest and heaviest sufferers), ali bearing testimony to the fortitude and the courage with which they bore up against every disaste. There was no one who conld not limit his personal or home expenditure in somne way when so pressing a demand for aid came, and he (lMr. Scholefleld) hoped Birmingham would do its duty orn The reeolution was passed unanimously. The Rev. J. C. BA.Rtsvrr, in moving that a subscription be entered into, said he had no sympathy with those cold. hearted people who. before they could feel any emotion of benevolence and charity, must first sit down to canvass minutely the causes that might have led to this outbreak, or to discuss the propriety of the Government or the East India Company taking care of the sufferers, The very fact that these men, women, and children had been shedding their blood on our behalf ought to speak so eloquently that If EnfUshmen had any money in their purses they ooght as c heer aDy to pour it out as the blood of the rufferers and their relatives had been poured out for them. (Hear.) Would it not be well to have a meeting in the Town-hall, in order that the working classes might join in thin great movement? He was sure that, as in the case of the Patriotic Fund, it would have the hearty and earnest sup. port of those lases, lHe also hoped that within 48 hours the clergy woald make an unanimous appeal to their con. gregations. Mr. SPooNER, XLP., seconded the motion, but agreed with Mr. Barrett that a town's meeting ought to beheld and that the subscription should be postponed til this was done. If the subject was put fairly before a general meeting of the inhabitants the appeal would be more likely to command universal attention. A resolation was then adopted, appointing those present a committee io carry out the means of raising funds. The subscriptions handed in during the proceedings exoeeded 600 GREAT YARMOUTE. Yest y a meeting, convened by the Maycr (Mr. C. C. Aldred), who presided, was held in the Town-hall, for the prpose of considering the propriety of raising a fund for the relief of the sufferers in Iadia. The CHAnItiA read letters from the following persons, expressing regret at their being unable to attend the meetsng, and enclosing subscriptions towvards the fund :-Sir E. HLK Lacon, 201.; Gurney and Co., hankers, 251.; Mr. B. Doend 50. Mrs Vor3hiB.Dowovsoon, 261.; W. P. Doweon, 251. v T'he Rev. G.

SHEFFIELD. The Mayor of Sheffield (Mr. J. W. Pye Smith) has called a speCal meeting of the Town CouncU for Mlonday next, to consider, among other tbings, " the propriety of setting on foot a town subscription in aid of the fund for relieving our suffering fellows-ubjects in the mutinous provinces of India." TAUNTON. The bailiffs of the borough (x. .

KS EWURY. The sufferings of the British people in India consequent upon the crnelties and atrocities perpetrated by the mutinous Sepoys have excited deep commisseration in this town. A private subscription was commenced a few days ago towards the Relief Fund which originated with the Lord Mayor of London, but it is now Intended that the town and neighbourhood should unite in an effort to obtain subscriptions for the relief of our suffering fellow-creatures. The Mayor (ir. Edward Wilson) has given notice of a publoimeeting, to be held in the Town-hall, in the afternoon of Thursday, the 24th inst., so that an opportunity might be afforded the farmers attending the market of being present to take p art in the proceedings, Already some liberal subscriptions have been promised, and tere is reason for behevingethat a sum wrill be raised here, fully equal, if not exceeding that forwvarded to the Patriotic Fund a few years ago.
OUR INDIrA1 ABRY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Since my communication to you of the 19th of August last relative to the employment of African troop: n India (which I believe was the firct suggestion made in your columns on that sabject), many letters have ppeared dvocating a plan for which there is a precedent in the case of Caffre soldiers having been once advantageously employed at Ceylon. The difficulty would be to obtain such soldiers n sufficient numbers to supply the required demand. In your number of the 15th of September, under the signature of " H. J. 31.," there is what appears to be an exoeLlent suggestion as to the feasibility of attaching a company of English soldiers to every native regiment in India. But would 100 Europeans be sufficient to control 900 Maho. medans and Hindoos, supposing the regiment to be 1,000 strong? and could not the two plans be combined, by having the flank companies of each native regiment composed-the Grenadiers of stout Englishmen, and the Light Company of stalwart and rcive Caffres, who, with proper training, would make the best light infantry in the world ? Should you deem this suggestion wortay of a pLac In your columns, it is perfectly at your serviOe. I have the honour to be. kA. BN W. j B1 kYin,Isle of Wight, Sept. 17.

SIR HENBR LA WRENCE. (From the Friend of Jrdia.) Vivid, after the lapse of many years, will be the recollection of tha throng of emotions which have during the last few months suxceeded each other so rapidly. Long 'will the massacre at Meerut and the gallant defence of Lucknow live In the hearts of the Eulghsh people, when their power shall onoe gain havebecomeconsolidated, andafresh policy shall have led to far different results. Keenly will the memorialist of the second centenary of Plassey, when he sees himself surrounded by the tokens of western civilization, regret and yet admire the untimely death of Sir Henry Law. rence. Gladly will he pay a tribute to the memory of the brave man whose administration and by whose iniluence so much has been done for India. For msuny aear will his name be assoCated with Lucknow, ind-long wilitbe before the natives of India wipe from their race the stain of the blood of the Padificator of (the Punjab, the large-hearted, milbty-energied Lawrence. Rarely has it fallento the lot of any man to lead so eventful a life, and still rarer has a life been spent so entirely unselfishly in the service of the State. In 1842 Political Agent in Affghanistan, and in18l57 resident in Onde, his career has been glorious throughout. It is seldom that the anme man pomes abilites fitted both for tho forum and the camp; the calm gravity of the one is thought to be opposed to the dashing boldness of the other; but Sir Henry Law. rence sessed these opposite qualifications, and shone a brightly in the Sutlej campaign, in the battle of Bobraon, In the action of Chillianwalla, and in the military deence of Lucknow, as in Affghianstam or the Punjab. The news of his death has been a blow to the heart at a11. who have been long resident in India, and -the mews of his fall has ever been told with bated breath and moistened eye. The Englhh love- a brave man, and though they admire administrative capac genius or zuccessful dating heltt treble plauditaL Bltterly, then, will they lament the loss of a man who united in his own person these opposit qufications, and gret will be their anger that two &uch mnen as Sir H. Wheder and Sir Hfenry Lawrence ahould,ahee beeusacrifioed to that dulness which hfiled to, observe that as all the horizon was overcast ao the storm would be generaL And what have we received in exchange The lives of a few reprobate Hindoos and Mussulnans. ut we have no wish to increase that sorrow which must be felt among those who rule as well as among those who are bond to obey. If whole hecatombs of rebels could restore to life the brave men, the fair women, and the tender irnants who have been ruthleWiy slaughtered, gladly would our brave countrymen at Cawnpore 'and Delhi offer the sacrifice; bat when, weary with illmng, and satiated with a just retribn tion unsullied by cruelty, the melancholy truth is foroed on their recollections that all their efforts aro unable to efface the past, they re almost inclined to give npin despair. Bnt the like occurrences may be prevented for the future, and the Englsh empire in the East, which has ever prospered by resistance, wil, when watered by the blood of miscreants who have broken every tie of humanity, grow until its branches overshadow the continent of Asia, Sir Henry Lawrence first acquired distinction In the Affghan war, which, though disastrous in its crisis, was not fruitless in its issue, for it served to develope the talents of many of our officer The experience he then gained at the Court of RunjeetSinghenabledhin to write2lAie Adv-nturer in the Punjab, and thus he proved nother example of men of action being also men of thought for the work still remains the only anthentic account of he state of the Punab during the reign of that astute ruler Runjet SinMh. Sir tenry Uwrenoe, in oommon with all the other PoZiticals who nad been employed in Lord Aucland's fatuouar, for somne time neglected. But at length he was appointed by Lord Hardinge Resident at Nepaul During tis tine h wrote several articles for theicuu Rcvjo In one of them he traced by anticipation the subsequent course of events In the Puniab, and more particularly the then future policy of Gholab Singh, with the precision of a man who has learnt to use past events as the right clue to future oerences, Then in appearace he drew only froi his prejudices or imagnat(on; he in reality proceeded upon afirm basis. After Major Broadfoot was killed at erosesb Lawrenoe was sent to be Political Agent with the Governor-General, and in that capacity he rendered essential service to Lord Hardinge. When the regency was eata. blished in the PIanjab he was appointed Resident - and he executed that arduous office, under all the difficulties of the transition period, with remarkable ability and wisdom. Bnt ill-health compelled him in 1847to return to England for a year, andin tat peiod the troubles which resulted in an. other warcommenced. He returned by the Indus towitnes the assault on Mooltan, to behold the force extemporized by Edwardes, and then to hasten forward to the scene of action in the further valleys of the Punjab. When victory at Guzerat seoored us the country, be, on the 31st of March, 1849, was appoinred president of the Board of Administration for the P'nujab, and it was as the able administrator of the newly-annexed province that his talents shone conspicuous At the time when he, with his ooadjutors r. 0. G. Manse ,&ud Mr. John Lawrenco, entered nun the difficult task of "overnment, the different e Punjab, from the Beas to the Indus, bated every dynasty except their own, and regarded " the British as the worst because the most powerful of uTrper" And the British could hope to secure no love to their rule by the reduction of taxation, for, though the exactions of Runjeet Singh were smetimes severe, yet what he took with one hand he not unfrequently gave back with the other. Besides his rule was suited to tho people, and martl trimpils and annexed territories more than oothed them for the loss of sonse few comforts or the endurance of some harsh tyrannieg. The elements of future disturbances in addition *ere not wanting; there were the Afreedees and the Wuzerees, the Boedars and the UIsfzyes, whom an appearaneo of weakness or an impost unsuited to the character of the half subject race would have at once called to arms, No less than 100,000 men might have been arrayed by any false move aginst us, and their passions would have been inflamed by' prie'tridden fanatics and bigoted priests." Butowingtothegenius of Sir Henry Lawrenoe and the carefulsupervision of Lord Dalhousie no such outbreak occurred, and in the words of their first report,-" The frontier was guarded, State establishments were orgnnired, violent crimes were repressed, and prisons disci p lne enforced; cdvil jusce was equitably administered, taxation fixed, the revenue collected, commerce set free, *crnclture fostered, the national resources developed, and plans for future improvement projected." After some time nconsequence of diversities of opinion between himself Lord Daihusle, and Sir John Lawrence, he was removed from the Punjab and placed in Rajpootana. He left his favourite and honourable post without the slightest attempt to excit popular prejudice against those with whom he differed, and he departed amid the sorrow of a1 cluases of the public servants in his province. For it was Sir Henr Lawrence's happy talent to be able to stimulate to exertion by love and example rather than by fear, and to win the sympathy ad the personal regard of all who served under him. In Rajpootana, though out of sight, he was active and labonions,fulfillinghis dutiesnot for the sake of applause but unostentatiouly as a man bent on doing while he lived all the good in his power. He identified himself with the chiefs, and we doubt not that his memory will long be preserved by them with honour and veneration. A fewrmorths ago he was summoned to Oude, and there the critical and extraordinary circumstances of his position soon caUed into action hishighest powers; and his consummateskill, courage and fortitude attracted the notice of all India, and marked him out as the foremost man of this country. Had he been spared be would have doubtless lived to see other men again supersede him, and again the reign of routine in England would have so ught out for the chief rulers of this land noblemen of high poitical connexions, while he, the worthy successor of Clive, remained neglected. It is at all time pleIg to have aelimpac of the private relations of a man ahoinhis public character has achieved an eminent position. We love to know all about such men, and what would in other cases be unwarrantable prying becomes a tribute of respect The charities of Sir Henry Lawrence were probably more extensive than those of ny man in the countr and they were as judicious s un ostentatious. He dcd not shrink from publicty whenit was useful for the sake of example, and by this means he suceeded in establishing theLawrence Aylui for the children of European soldieras The late Lady Lawrence shared all his benevolence aud all his genius. Mis article in the Calcutta Review on 1" Woman in India" is descriptive of her character, and the large subscription that was raised for the Lawrence Asylum after her death was tho best tribute to her worth. We might go on to speak of his warm and generous temper, his candid and tender consideration for others, his mingled gentleness and resolution, and the loss his death ill be to India But it is needless. Doabtless the Lawrience Asylum will lose by the death of Its founder, but a generous publi will ta care that this noble institution shall ever reman a testimonial to the munificence of Sir Henry Lawrence. Bat we hope that in the capital of India, in Calcutta, some monument will be erected to his worth, and that England herself will do justice to his heroic services and his unspotted fame, The man who effected all this, the philanthropist and the warrior who secured to us the frnits of conquests, has passed away, mortally wounded ina a sortie aSainet cowards, the slaughterers of helpless women and children, and now fugitives from the avenging sword of Generals Havelook and NeUL The Commiseioner of Onde died, not before he hadbreathed into his little garrison somewhat of his own heroic spirit. Great actions are contagious, and gladly would they have died for him; but it was not so to be; henceforth they will live only for vengeance. A wound in the face, which in a state of mere perfect health might pro- bby have been treated with success, had proved fatal, and this noble and generous soldier has been taken away amid Unsverai 3amentation-taken away, we hope, before the news could have reached him that the Coutr of Directors had again passed him over in nominating a miiEtary member o the Supreme Council. Thus has a brave man, one who has ever striven to effect good in his day and generation, ana whose life wil be a bright example to future ages, gone to his rest. Probably he was slaughtered by the hands of those very men with whom he so touchingly expostulated on the 12th of lay. Who cannot hear himn addressing the traitors who failed him in his hour of need ! Who cannot picture him calling to the remembrance of the incipient mutineers their former gallant deeds! As his hezirt was without guile, so he suspected none. Appealing to their better natures, he said, 1any like myself have grown gray i your company, have been asocited with you from our boyhood, have shared in your compaigns, have participated in all your dangers, privations, and triumphs, in compound, in quarters, from the swamps of Burmah to the snows of BamoanWe axe all your frienas; our interests are inseparable; if your fac are blackened, so are ours; if any dishonour befalls you, do we not suffer 2" To the last he believed that the Sepoys had been misled by designing men, and it wa not until the lat sortie that he could, when he saw his soldiers traitorously joining the ranks of the insurgents, uge the depravity of the Asiatic. If the Sepoys of the Bth, 48th, and 71st Possessed one spark of military honour, they would now lay aown their arms, and by submitting to the death that awaits them in some measure atone for the heinousness of their guilt. Full of noble and affectionate feeling, heroic and enthurltastic as a soldier, ardent in his benevolence, unbiassedinhist liberality, a zealous etozdial friend, a man of stoLid learning, and Igreat experiene, writh the wisdom ot a powrerful bct siple mind, hashistory is more c rotjy of record thatha of ffrT. unxoOerSir JohnJfltnm. Theteyebohia rested upon the lustre of the fame of the stateisni or *he warrior, which has watched its growing progrew and bscanusi it at its meridian beight amid the honours and applaue of contemporary devotion, seldom becomes dazzled with its posthumous brightness. But the loss of Sir Henry Lawrence has left us to discover at leat what inferior enea have posts of higher influence, and how our country suffers from its neglect, under its despicable seniority system of its noblest, its loftiest Lnd its most illastrious song; thus his after fane will evon be 2reater than his living renown.

OFFICZBRS SA VED. TO THE EDITOR OF THE, TIMES. Sir,-Permitme to add the following information, In which three families are interested, to that furnished by Colonel3faitland in your paper of to-day, the more partlcu. hlAy a you have re-published from the Homeward Mail a At of those who have " perished," which includes the names of lnsign William Blunt Barwell, Lieutenant Montgomxery Hunter, and Surgeon Richard Henry Oakley. I rejoloe in the conviction that this information Is erroneous Both your little tabular statement and tho list in the Homeward Mail are derived from the Bombay Gazette Overland SuDecmar1, from which you have cortly trnsferred the table. The error Is at Bombay, and I think esily explained. In the same Gazete there is an account of the outbreak at Bareilly-which occurred on the 31st of May-in a letter from Allabad, in which letter the following psage occurs:. " On Sunday tho 31st (May) the troops at Bareilly broke out. Most of the officers of the 18th escaped. Lieutenant Hunter, Ensign Barwehl, and Dr. Oakeley, we believe, were killed." This 14 of course, erroneous, for we know that these three ofiers aped to Nyneo Tal, but the erroneous passage accounts for the erroneous tabular statement. But it may be urged the tabular shtement is headed "KFlled, &c., since July S0." This date, too, Is obviously an error; for, to say notning of some whose fAte Is uncertan, the death of Brigadier Brind occured on the 10th of July. I have very carully gone through every pargraph of the two ammasries of the Bombay T,mes and the Bombay Gazette, and in neither can be found any notice of any out bresk at Nynee Tal, nor of any action fought anywhere in which, by any posdbility, any one of the three parties n med can have been engaged and killed. We are therefore left to the alternative of concluding either that the statement Is erroneous, or that without any other intelligence than the tabular statement supplies,.these three offioers who esoaped together from Bareltly, have left Nynee Tal togther, fought together, and been killed together, without any reoord of any of the circumtances. The concludon Is obvious, that the report of these officers having perished must rest on no better foundation than the Allahbad letter, known to be the reverse of the fAct. I know that there Is a letter from Ensign Barwell, dated July 9, and bearing the; pot mark of the 10th, received by last mail. Your obedient servant. W.

YOLUNTBBRS FOB tyDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMIES. S}r,-I beliove I am representing a large clasm of the fighting power of England in calling your attention to the fact that there are thousands and thousands of young Britons who, stut of heart and strong of arm, are burning with desire to be led to fight their oountry's battles and be placed face to face with those insulters and destroyers of our lades and little children in Bengal, but who, slas I having been born ud educated as gentlemen, cannot enter the ranks; and, not being in possession of those mighty levers, interest and Influence, are too " poor" to procure commslsions, an are thus prevented from serving their coutry. Can no moasure be adopted by the country to avail itself of these dormant energies ? Are there no means 1 Might not a leglon of Englishmen be formed on the same tenms as the Foreign Legions during the last war-viz., for a stipulated period, with-promotion from the ranks and as handsome treatment as the German and Swiss Legions received at their dismissal. Surely, this petiton is a very modest one, proceeding as It does from Englishmen offering themselves to their ocnntry, to figh' for it and die for it, and begging to be aocepted on the rme term as were extended to foreigners. Niay, I will even go further, and venture to aasert that there are hundreds-I, for one-who are wllUing to place themselves at the disposal of Government, without bounty beforehand or the promise of a gratification afterwards, if it will only give us plenty of active service, a fair chance of distingniahing ourelves, and promotion acoording to maerit. It would be a great favour to many if yon give this a place in your columns. I was at Paris a week ago, and met there a party of three young countrymen who wero hurrying home to endeovour to procure employment in India, and who were as much at a loss as myself as to the means to attain their desire. An Austrian paper taunts ts with the want of that spirit which we have been woont so nobly to show forth on former occasions, and several other foreign publications have given utteranco to the liko reproaches.

THE PURCHASB SYSTBM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMS. Sfr,-As you yourself and several others of your octem.. porarles have done me the honour of referrlng to me by name-some in approbation-others, I am sorry to see, in contempt-in the various observations which they have made on the report of the Conmissioners on Purchase, and on the evidenoe which Is appended to that report,-I beg you will find space for a few remarks which I desire to make in answer to the strictumas which have been passd upon the views which I advocate. It iD objected that I desire men to be selected for promotion in peace time on account of mere certificates of honour gained by them for high acoomplishments. As one writer facetiously observed,-I would promote Major Brains to the detriment of Aljor Biceps. Unless we adhere to a seniority system there must be some mode of promotion by selection. We now promote by selection, we select men who have money in preference to men who have none-the possession of money being a tangible fact; whereas the possession of merit, it is said, must remain a mere matter of opinion, in deciding upon which a commander-in-chief might err. The present Com. mender-in-Chief and the present Minister of War have indeed both told the eommissioners that they would not venture to incur the responsibility of promotion by selection. Now, It appears to me that the possession of the various qualities which go to the composition of a good officer needs not remain a mere matter of opinion to the heads of the profession, if they will take the trouble which is taken in other countries to ascerain the reality of It. A regulated system of selection-promoting say 1-3d by selection, while the remainder of the army progress by seniority-obtains In other European armies, and there is no conceivable reason why it should aot succeed with us. Wbat we seek is a happy and perhaps rare combination of Brains and Blceps-a combination which may be ascertained by the examinations carried on at many military schools abroad, in which the physical qualities and accomplishments of a young offioer are weighed as carefully as his intellectual acquirements. To the persons who objeot to the opponents of purchase as mere theorists I would reply, that every improvement must be a theory until ik has been put into practioe. A man who has dined late all his life may tell the doctor, who advises him to dine at midday, that he dare not venture on the mere theory of being able to digest his food at an earlier hour. The fact that every other army in the world except our own mmrages to get on without purchase, and that the best portions of our army-the Engineers, the Artillery, and the Marines are perfectly effective without it-is surely a stroDg oorroboration of the theory which we seek to establish. That there are no advantages in the purchase system I donot asert. It would be difficult to conceive any system of promotion which would not have some. Promotion by cards, or dice, or lot, promotion by foot races, or wrestling, or pugilism, would all have some incontrovertible argumentg In their favour, and I verily believe they would have more than promotion by purchase has. Two witnesses of great weight, Colonel Claremont and the late General Sir Henry Barnard, have stated in their evidence that many French offioers of the highest, the very highest, rank, declared to them that they oonsidered our punrchase systet an excellent system; that to it we owed the superiority of our officers over the officers of the oontl. nental armies, and that we should be very wrong to abolish it. Evidence of this kind is very vague. The French are a very polite people; and it is probable that few French offlicers have ever atudied, or understand, the workidng of our purchase system. The names of the offioers who hAve given these opinions are withheld. And no French nrilitary writer that I have ever heard of has written a single word on the advantages of the purchase system As practised by the English, although, according to General Barnard aDd Colonel Claremont, their highest military authoritios admire it extremely in private. The main reason why I think that the purchase gyten ought to be abolished is that it deprives the nation of the services of so large a portion of the ablest and most ener getic classes of the oommunity. All the educated middle classes, all the lower clases above the lowest, avoid the army as a profesion, with very rare exceptions, or, at most, to contribute to it their dregs. Yet, in the military history of this oountry the middle clases have shown that they oontain as much oDurage, eonduct, and talent as any of tho other classes of society. Aooording to the admission of ll the chronicles, Bnglish and French, the Englfsh wchbrs won the battles of Crecy, Poictiers, and Agincourt. The French armies were then compo6ed of knight and serfs; the English oontFined a third elementthe middle class, before which everything went down. The case is reversed now. The French have a large-- perhaps, too large-middle class in their army, whie we have only gentlemen and labourers, answering to tLe knights and serfs of the French armiee in the olden time. Guizot used to say thbt if we ever again engaged ia a war with France we should be under a great disadvantage, because France could obtai an unlimited supply of educated offioers from her military bourgeoisie, while tho class from which we drav our officers would soon be exhausted; and his prediction was fully verified during the Crimean war. Witness the batches of ignorant schoolboYs we ent out, utterly unfit for anymilitary duty, yek necesarily exhausted immediately on landing with importaut military duties, involving the honour of their countrY and the lives of their countrymen. If the young yeomen who beat the French at Crecy, and the mercantile clerls who established our Indian empire, had been present in the rauks of our army, and eligible for promotion, the results would have been more satisfactoryz Itis chiefly to and through the ranks that the middle clas infuson is required. This will be the reel lever to raise the chater and efficiency of the army throughout all its grades, and the abolition of the purcha syatem sad the establishment of a system of promotion, according to professional qualifications and good service, I believe to be iadispensable for this purpose. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant. M. J. HIQGINS. 71, FAton-squ&rM SepL 17.

HER MAJESTY'S THEATRE. The idea of opening the Opera-house for two nights long after the close of the musical season was, in the first instanoe, a bold one, but, as it was attended with success last year, there was no reason why an appealeshould not again be made to the stragglers who remain in London during this present September. Mademoiselle Piccolomini, Signor Giuglini, and the rest of the company having ahieved a triumphauttour throughtheprovinces, andbeing ontheirway to the continent vid this metropolis, were at hand for an experiment of the sort, and accordingly the great lyrical theatre was opened last night, and will be opened again to. night, for the redidue of musical connoisseurs. Last night Don Giovacnni was the opera; the house was literally crammed in every part, and narratives are current about the rejection of numerous perwons who essayed to obtain an entrance when space was no longer at oommand. The reduotion of prices adopted on these extra ocCasions brings to the establishment a multi. tude that has not listened to the exquisite voice of Giuglini or been fascinated by the vivacity of Picoolomini during the fashionable months, and consequently there was a freshness last night in the oft-repeated applause that must have been highly gratifying to the ears of the artists.
HAYMAKBET THEATRE. The performance of Lady Teazle by mrs. Cstherine Sinclair will doubtless enhance that lady in the estimation of the London public. For Beatrice, and indeed for Shakspearian h,Araoters generally, a oertain degree of force is required, for whioh no amount of intelligence can fully compensate, and hence we may question the soundness of the judgment by which a part so arduous was seleoted for the arst appearance of our Transatlantio guest. Eler Lady Teazle is a very satisfactozy impersonation. Not only does she evidently appreciate, but she gives due effect to the sparkcling points of the dialogne, wbich, representing a lighter social atmosphere than the pleasantries of the Elizabethan period, are more within the grasp of an artist who has b^en rather trained in high society than in the traditional usages of the stage. H1er manner is easy, her gaiety unaffected, and, what is a most important consideration) her face exactly suits the powdered hair with which Lady Teazle is now endowed, in conformity with the fashion of 1777. To look the character better would be impossible. Altogether the School for Scandal is very pleasantly acted by the Hayrarket company, and is, moreover, exceedlngly well put upon the stage, the precedent established by Madame Vestris when she produced the piece, with appro. priate costume, at Covent-garden being followed in the dresses and the arrangement of the groups. Twenty years ago the smart drawing-room, with the whiet-players as a back-ground to the scandalmongers in front, was utterly unknown. It is now an established soene.

May I be permitted to state that the officer in command at Bushiro is Brigadier-General John Jacob, the late Commandant of the Scinde Horse; and that George Le Grand Jacob has tho rank of Lieutenant.

The Chancellor of the Exchequeracknowledges the receipt of bank-notes value 1,3501. from a large public company in payment of the amount deficient in income-tax returned. THrE CORPORATION OF NonTrT SIIELDS.-Ol Wednesday afternoon the collectors of the income-tax for this district proceeded to a public sale of the fnrniture of the baths and washhouses belonging to the corporation. The seizure, as has been previously stated in Tlhe Times, was made on account of a reassessment of income-tax to make good the defalcations of a former colleotor. At the commencement of the sale a large concourse had assemibled in the auction-room; and the aactioneer was greeted with a storm of yells, hootings, and cries of " Shame !" The town-clerk attended and, on the part of the corporation, entered a protest against the proceedings. The fznctionary of the hammer, however, persisted in putting up several articles to competition, but only one bidder against the corporation appeared, in the person of one of the bailiffs. A perfect tumult ensued, and all further attenints to bid against the corporation were speedily abandoned. Tables, chairs, carpets, &o., were knocked down at Id. each; patent mangle at 6d.-the entire tum realized upon above 1001. worth of goods being only 12. Os. 8d. ! The auctioneer and his assistants were yelled off the premises. Fortunately this extraordinary scene closed without any personal violence.-N2Vicastde Chronicle. FEARFUL CATASTROPHE IN A FARMYABD.-On Wednesday morning a steam-thrmshing machine was at work in the middle of the stackyard of Mr. David Goundrill, of Metba,n, near Howden, Yorkshire, when the bailer attached to the machine suddenly burst. The engineer was killed on the spot, and three other men were very severely scaldedcandbruised. A portion of the machine,weighinl 12 cwt., was throwvn a distance of 80 yards, and the 'dywheel alighted on the top of a high stack of wheat. The botcinde.s were sent flying in all directions, so that five co-n stacks andsore straw stacks wore on fi s in a fewn minutes, and wereafterwards entirely destroyed. A fire engine, belonging to the Leeds and Yorkshire Insurance Company, was despatched from HIowden immediately un an alarm being given, and by energetic exertions on the part of the fire brigad'e a haystack and two wheat etscks, containing 20 1quarters each, were saved, and also th thrashing machine sbed, ad joining She barn, whbichhad taken fire. Mr. Gound- ill is insured in the Leeds and Yorkshire-offlce. The damlage has been estimated at 500l. BRISTOL SMG R-MARKET, Friday, Sept. 18.- There is a better demand fromn the arooers, which hen been met by importers at very reasonable prices.

COURBT of BANKRUPTCY, B aUw & 1S. IN RE COLONE!L WILLIAM PET= WA(.L (Before Mr. Coinmissiontr HOLROYD. The bankrupt was a director of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation. This waz an adjourned examination meeting. Mr. LUwsR ox (for the bankrupt) said he was atif anffering from illness and wable to attend in London for the purpoeo of surrndering to his bankruptcy, and put in the iubjoined documents in confirmation of his sttement- "I, Wtlmam 1etre Waugh, iake at, and see that I a. stil suffer.

I beg to remain M., " A-Y MURZ&Y WAITGI" The only course under the clrcumstnces was an adjoturn znent, and whether that adjonrnment should be to a fixed day or sine die was for the decaioor of the CoQurt. It seemed to him (M.r Lawrance) that an adjournment sine dic would be the best course, as avoiding expense, becatlso no time was specified in the docuLments put in at which It was likelr that the bankrupt could appear. Protection would, of couxse, be granted for a limited period on the understaunding that it would not be further allowed. Mr. LINKLAT RM-I appear on behalf of the assignees. Imust really, on their behalf, object to a further contin. ancc of these adjournment5. The bankruptcy took place in April last, and Colonel Wauglx hae not yet surrenderid Ii appears that the bankrupt is now at San Lucar, and even if he be in the state of health alleged it does not follow at all from the physician's certificate that the bankrupt's state of headth has been such as to precltxde him undertaking the ourney by easy stages, and I reallytbink very little effort has been shown on the bankrupt's part to conform himself asthebankruptlawrequires. If, however, your Honour thinks it reasonable that a further adjournment ehould be accorded to the bankrupt, the aignees will be content, buti I must, on their bel, object to snch adjournment boing of longer duration than one month from this tfme, ana I should wish the Court to intimate its opinion that it would then refuse to adjourn the matter any further unless it were then satisfied that the bankrupt had made much more energetic efforts than he yet appears to have done to appear before the Court and surrender to his bankruptcy. I may mention that we are on behalf of the assignees investi. sating the accounts of Colonel Waugh with the London and aster Bank, and the bankrupt's attendance here is manifestly most important. Mr. L,waisAAx said his friend laboured nuder a misapprehension with respect to evidence. Mr. Commissioner Evans had dedded that the evidence wras sificent. The CO03sSSIONEL-If the aignees desire an adjourn. ment to a day certain, I cannot refuse that order. There mugt be an understanding, howveer, that a very strong affidavit will have to be produced upon another application, -not an affidavit merely stating thatexcitement would be dangerous, but that the bankrupt's illness is such as would prevent him from coming to this country. Mr. LkwiRtACE said he was confident that Mr. Linklater would, in the case of an examination, pursue the investigation with feelivgs of consideration for the bankrupt's past position, altheugh he was now a fallen man. Ris client wras at the mercy of the Court a;nd his creditors, and he could not complain of any conditon thati might be imposed npon him. tr. LINRLAWis suggested the naming of a day certain, with an intimation that no further time would be given or further protection granted. An ajourent for a month would meeb the wishes of the aignecs Mr. L4WRA.YcE.-Ten days will be consumed in communication. The adjournment should be for a longer period to be of any Use. The CoMBissiol'xER.-Make It two months. Mr. L&wRsA;SCE asked whether the assinees would think it proper to send out interoatoee in case they should require any particular information. The banktupt could be examined before the British OonsAL MIr. LlxATER.-Such a course would not be a very convenient one, and it would occulon considerable expense. If any pressing question should oour to him he would convev i't by letter. lr LA1vtAicCX said he should be happy to forward any letters of the kind referred to. A proof was then tendered by Mr. Linklater on behalf of Miss Jane Clarke, of 170, Regent-street, for 1,8541., the balance of a millinery account. o renderthis claim fully intelligible to the general reader it must be stAted that in July, 180, the bankupt married Mrs. Carew. That lady had a settlemeatof 600. a-year oat of thelBeddingtox estate, and she has a daughter by her first hesbaAnd, who in the year 18S5 married Sir Charles Robert Plgot. The millinery bill of Miss Clarke arises thuls -The account commences in Febreary, 1850, a few months onl? before Mrs. Carew becameMrs. Waugh.

The dress was for herself and daughter, Miss Carew. The wedding trouweau, he wa3 informed, was chrged at somewhere about 1,2001., and it would have to be decided whether-the bankrupt's estate was liable for the amount, The best course would be to allow the amount to be entered at present as a claim only. The CouRT concurred. Among the proofe allowed is one of 1,607L for jewelry. There is also a claim against the estate of 45 guineas for only one month's boxes (July 1856), at Her Majesty's and the Baymarket, Adelpbi, *ndi Olynpic Theatres, Some of the tems In the 1,5071. bill for jewelry are as remarkable an those contained in the bill for millinery. HiS RONOtuR named the l19th of November, at 1, for the adjourned sittbng.
BAILWAY MIS&AAyG_MBVT. TO THE RDITOR OF THB TIMES. Sir,-Whea a man has a grievance for which he cannot otherwise obtain redress he writes to T7e Timm, and by the publicity given to his complaint in that widely-diseeminated journal be is enabled very frequently to reach offenders and remedy offeuces which are not to be got at in any other way. Railway directorg are of this class; they set the individnal at defiAnce, but are obliged to bow to the power of the pres. I bave a railway grievance to complain of-another item to add to the catalogue of delays and dis. agreeables to which paengers are exposed on our iron. ways. I and two friends yeserday booked ourselves at Leominster, on the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway, throughout to Cheltenham, to arrive there at 6 30 p.m., having an engagement there at 7 o'clock. The train was due at Leominster at 4 p.m., but we were detained there for 20 minutes after that time. On our arrival at Hereford we changed for the Great Western line, but in consequence of our being considerably behind our time the Great Western train to Chdtenham had started, and we were informed that the next train was at 8 15, giving us an interval of three tours to wait aboRt the station and " chew the cud of bitter fancy." We complained, of course to the officials, but were told that delays on that line (the Shrewsbury nd Hereford) were not unoommon, they were rather the rule than the exception (to myself it has happened twice within a short period), and that the only train to be depended on to keep Its time is the express But our troubles did not end bere, for when we appeared at the Hereford station at 815 we found something was wrong, and that we were doomed to a further delay. It came ont that the engine of a goods train had broken down somewhere on the line, our passenger engine (the only one at the station) had been sent to help the train in, and that we could not move until the engine retuarned. To conclude, we left Hereford at 9 o'clock and arrived at Cheltenham at half-past 10-four hours beyond our tffs, and, of course, too late to tneot the engagement we had made. Nlow, Sir, I understand that this Shrewsbhry and Here ford line Is worked under contract or agreement of some kind or other by Messr Brassey and Co. It is the purpose and interestn2 these gentlmen to make all they can out of it-the public convenience is but a secondary consideration, and in consequence those who travel on this line must be prepared to do so at a slow pace, and to submit to Iinumerable delays; but they must not calculate on reaching their destination at the time set down for them, or they will assuredly in a majority of oass be disappointed. The " cheap and nasty" principle seems to role in the magement of the line. Common coal is burned in the engines, and at times wee bad the choice of closing every opening into the - carriage or sitting as in the smoke of a chimney flue, to the disgust of one's senses and the destruction of one's clothes, Public attention should be called to these matters, as it will not do that public convenience or public safety sbould be sacrifed to rail vay managers, be they a committee of directors or a party of speculators If these gentlemen undertake duties they should be rigidly performed, and faith kept with the public. If you can spare space in your columns for this somewhat lengthy epistle you will do service, and Alih A R ATT.WA ATf, bo . Cheltenham, Sept. 16.
TaE LATE CROwN PROsEcuTIrON A'T LIvERPOOL.- Cases of brutal treatment at sea have become so nume. rons of late, that to the Liverpool hosDitals a.lone a hundred sufferers have been furnished from the Tessels arriving at that port, and the Government have become alive to the necessity of taking decisive measures to put a stop to such offences. The Board of Trade, which is now a species of public protector to the mercautile marine, having, throngh their official machinery, an opportunity of reviewing these cases, thought fat in that of Captain Rogers and the mates Miles and Seymour to take it up with the view of securing amle justice, and the President, Lord Stanley, requested Mlamill, the solbitor of Her lajesty's Customs, to undertaketbEaon duct of it. That gentleman was deputed to act as solicitor to the Treasury in this case, and he conducted it in person at Liverpool with the results wvhich are co weU knoinCicii Se-vcre Gmcue. THE SOUTH YORBS}IIBE COAL TR.ADE.-Increaied activity has prevaled in the coal trade of this district since oar last report, and a brisk winter's trade at improved prices is expected, as much less coal than usual has been stocked. The trsde will also shortly be greatly benefited by the introduction of the manufacture of coke for the railways; this trade, which Is very large, amounting to many thousaAds of tons weekly, has been monopolized by the north. It has recently bee4 ascertained, however, by Mr. Samuel Plimsoll, of London (who has had the use of ovens vroided for experiment by the Great Northern Railway Company at their plaoe at Doncaster), that locomotive coke of the best quality can be made from the smudge, which is now for the most part left in the pits in this district as worthless, and several of the principal coalmasters are joining for the purpose of erecting ovens and making coke on a large scale under hr. Plimsoll's superintendence. Considering the high price of railway coke and the small cost of the material, considefable profit will attend its manufacture, which wil so cheapen to the railway companies their most coatly article of consumption. fAdverttisment.4-Wyld's New Maps of Ind4t-Indla and Delh.- Wild's Now Map Of India, with a'I the Civil and tl Szationa~ I'bles of Distaucs,,ko.
