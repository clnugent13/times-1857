Nobody more than myself esteemed tiht worthy. .aan-so intelligent, so talented, and so good-rearted, I have not forgotten that it was he who first came to seei me 'w.thyou at Wiesbaden, and who, while he brought me:tbe frank and noble assurance of his entire devotedbess, eff4red ane the assistance of his zeal and of his -constant efforts to -prepare the way for that desired reconoiliation.whioh ihas since been so fortuna tely accomplished, and -which France has a' right to look upon at present as- one of the firisaest guarantees'dfor thefutuie. llhose are good sid loyal services which, united with other recollections of his life solhononrable and his death so, Christian, will. render his memory ever precions and dear. Say so on ny part td his family and to his numerous.friends. May they'find in thit reflecftion some relief to theirjust affliction ! "I am always in the -hopes tA#t.I shall ssel Ihavete pleasure of seeing you.' I am anxiotts to be able to renew verbally the expressions of my entire esteem and -my very 'sincere affec!ion. . - -" HENEL' Notwithstanding the cold, the crawd of persons -anxious to view the body of£.the Archbishop lying in' state was yestexday and. to-day even greater than the preceding days. As early as 8 in the 'norning a 'considetab]& number were: collected ' outside the .palace, waiting for admission. - Many among them' brought medals and rings, whioh they handed toone of the ecclesiastics to touch the body with, they then becoming in the eyes of their owners sacred relice. The funeral of the Archbishop, which- was .at first fixed for the lath, will take place to-morrow -(Saturday) at half-past 8 in the morning. The vicars-general and the titulary canons of the church -of Paris will assemble at the Archiepiscopal Palace *at 8 o'clock, and after the body has been placed on the funeral carthe cort,gt will commence its march, -fohowed by an immense body 'of the clergy, all in -their full clerical costtme- On the cortege reaching thePlaceduParvis Notre Dame the prebendary *canons and the clergy of the cathedral, preceded by the crosier of the chaptei, will come out to receive the body, which, on being conveyed intothe dhu'ch,: -will be placed on a lofty catafalque, and the funeral service will immediately comiaence. The body will remain exposed until 3 o'clock, when the chapter 'will chant the vespers for -the dead. After that 'ceremony the body will be conveyed to 'the vnilt appropriated for the Archbishops of Paris. The. treat bell of the cathedral and all the bells of the -churches of Paris will be - tolled -at 7 o'clock this -evening, and at 7 to-morrow morning, the day of' the funeral, and at differehit times thtoughout the -day. The entrance to the church will be perfectly free to the public, but seats will be reserved for the. 3nembers of the family of the deceased prelate and for the' different constituted bodies. The purifica'tion of the church of St. Etienue du Mont ill takeo place on Monday,. at 10 in the morning, with the seremonial customary on such occasionas. . It is believed that the preliminary proceedings are -so far- advanced that the assassin will be put o'n his -trial about the 20th or 25th of the preseht month. A! -the prisoner 'confesses -his ' crime the trial probably will not last long4 The defence 'made by 'is advocate will, no doubt, be that the crime Was the act of a madman. The principal, motive now ulleged by the crimainal himself was to ayenge the oppression of the inferior c'asses of the clergy. by the great dignitaries of the church. Having been 'more than once reproved by his superiors,;and par'ticullarly the Cur' of St. Germain de 1'Auceirotll he first meant, he says,'to have kiMled the last na'med, 'but on reflection he preferred a still higher victiin. fEe wished as a member' of the. -ecclesiastical ,democracy to give a terrible warning to the aristcrac' of the church. No!trace'of nladness, inthe ordinary acceptance of the word, has, I believe, been detected, further thai the excitemient of hirTld 'which accompanies the commission of£such an aet. The only instance in the French Church -of- gn isimoet identical act oecured in the 6th centdtry. Pietextal, Bishop of Rouen, whose name is found ,' the.

England and F3rance have propoed terms to the Federal Council which this body conBiders accept. able. The E3nvoys of Switzerland. have also corme to an understanding with the French Government. Switzerland will set at liberty the prisoners, on the assurance of the two mediating Powers that Prussia will ac-knowledge the independence of Neuchitel, and at once put a atop to all military preparations. Thus ends this dispute, which, arising from the moat pitiful of causes, threatened Europe with a bitter and detennined contest. What the King of PiUssrA has gained it is difficult to see. His military power has been braved by the hasty levies of a small republic; his political reputation has been still frther tarnished by the fact that he has been ready to shed the blood of thousands for an empty title; and as for the point of honour, he certainiy has not much to boast of, since he has had to promise to aeknowledge the independence of Neuchlttel and to withdraw his military demonstrations before the Swiss would release the prisoners of September. However, we may rejoice at the bloodlem termiunation of the dispute; and, if King FannznRoI WruTA conceives himself to have ended the affair with credit to hiraself and his regal dignity, the world will not care to interfere with his ilusion. But this affair of Neuchatel may teach us something. What is the meaning of so seemingly absurd and paltry an episode in the history of Europe? Surely the close of a gigantic struggle between the greatest empires of the world was no time for so puerile a display as that of the Neuchbtel Royalists. The old comparison of a tempest in gla of water would be sure to arise in the mind of everybody. The King of PRussrk would* not take part for or against us in the great war which has lately ended; but as sOon as it was over he hag his own demonstration against the castle of a little Swiss town. The King of PRussLi had allowed four years to elaPse after 1848 before he obtained diplomatic sanction for his supposed rights by the protocol of London, and four more before he took any active steps to regain them. Why, then, did he choose such a moment for his little coup dr?tt ? What could he expect but that it would be looked upon merely as the farce after a tragedy, and that the disrespect Iwith which he himself is regarded in Europe would. deepen into something very like contempt? The solution of this question is found, we think, in the security felt by the absolute Governments of the continent, in their confidence in their own strength, their reliance on one another, and their common hatred of the few remaining free States of Europe. An absolute Monarch might think he could hardly choose a better time for a quarrel with a republic. Within a twelvemonth Belgium had been threatened, Spain subjected to uncontrolled Royal authority, and Naples brought into I more complete servitude. Throughout Europe monarchical and military authority was supreme. Either by deliberate choice, as in Fraunce, or by acquiescence, as in other continental countries, the principle of absolute govermnent had been almost universally accepted. But Switzerland forms an irritating contraRt to this uniformity of submission. There, somewhat in the fashion of ancient Greece, a number of little communities are bound together by a league sufficient for the purposes of defence and for developing a feeling of nationality, but with rivalries and often animosities among themselves. Such as they are, the Swiss have always been the objects of dislike to the neighbouring autocrats, and now the feeling is stronger than ever. Free Governments, with assemblies debating in French and German; revolutions in 'Which the artisans living in one part of the towu take the power from the aristocracy -living in another part of it; neTvspapers expressing freely opinions which cannot be uttered in the great empires across the frontier; the absence of passports; the harbouring of refugees; boIyday:set apart to celebrate independence; orations full of allusions to liberty and the people, arethings looked upon with a very evileyein the centre of Euriope. I fac5, -Swiss notions-- are a thorn in the: xide of thie conitinental MIonarchs. T5Dhe country is- too striking; a cox at to t~heir oil. li;ngland is S ~atio -o apart, both geOgraphically and rndrji wintzerland is inhabited by a race aufficiently resembling-the people of the surrounding States, its languages ae their languages, and its . osition allows, and, indeed, necessitates, coustant co.- maunication with them. That the subversion of Swis freedom would be gratifying to the chief continentalPowers there can be little doubt. We do not mean to Jay that the country would be conquered or partitioned, or even the form of the government changed; but the U&cHuvzs of the continent know well how to reduce a free constitution to a pracMcal nullity, and with a fettered pres, a new passport system, and an enforced extradition of political fugitives, the Swiss Republin might cease to be unpleasing to the most delicate monarchical nerves. That the King of PRUSSuA had formed any definite plan we do not think, simply because he ins a man much more likely to act without any plan at all; but that the men wrho raisedthe riot and who counselled the KnoG to protect the rioters are the men who persistently hate and work against Swiss freedom in beyond a doubt. In no part of Europe does there exist a class more violently and ridiculously prejudiced agains free government than that which now rules in Prussia. A nobility without character, talents, or patriotism, puffed up with an insane pride of birth, and devoted to that Russan alliance which will one day be the ruin of their country, surrounds the feeble Monarch, and in this crusade we see the result of their counsels. The time chosen for the outbreak was September last, when all the world was flocldkig to the Moscow coronation, when the Ministers of France were warmlv responding to Russian overtures, and when Austria was supposed to be irreconcileably hostile to this country, and ready to join in any scheme for putting down the insolent independence of a free neighbour. But, happily, England is sufficiently powerful to forbid any scandalous violation of national independence. We do not pretend to more than is in our power; we even own that in many things we have overrated our own influence and the influence of our institutions. We cannot prevent Kings from destroying the constitutions they granted, or nations from bowing down anew to the power they had overthrown. But we can and will prevent the subversion of one of the oldest and most excellent polities which exist in Europe. There is, indeed, little space left to liberty on the continent; there is therefore the greater reason why we should defend it in the few strongholds to which it has retired. Before the house of BR"Diuts:aG was known beyond the petty limits of a province the Swiss people had upheld their liberty against Burgundy and Austria, had established the principles of the Reformation, and during a century and a half of evU times in England had protected English Reformers, English Pulritans, and English Republicans from a succession of enemies. We rejoice, then, that the English Cabinet has had an opportunity of supporting the independence of Switzerland, and that it has recalled the French Government to the duty of joining it in so just a cause.
We do not require the exPostulations of " A CC LANCASHUM IsCUXv," "A ColuJly RIc"t, Tor," and " A CsHnrn nMjrw," to remind us that there is a large class of clergy iu the country who do their duty, who work hard, and who would have nothing to lose from an examination of the way in which they had spent their time. Our remarks were not intended to apply to the diligent, but to the idle, but the diligent come forward and take the lesson as if it were meant for them. What the clerical profession suffers from is the indefiniteness of its duties. Throw a man into the middle of a population of 500, or 1,000, or 1,800, with the general direction that he is to do them good, and no other instructions whatever to guide him, and everybody knows what the result in a great many instances must be. Ardent zeal takes a plunge immediately into the thick of this indefinitaaik, but many a well-meaning -man is in considerable perplexity, at any rate for some time, what in the world he must do, and how he muBt begin. You mast allow him a little time for staring about him and rubbing his eyes. Set a wel-intentioned man to work upon any given number of yards of Oxford-street, or Fleet_street, or ilolborn, containing so many grocers, bakers, porkdealers, and other sabstantial tradesmen. with the direction that he is to do them good. lie will tell you these people are too respectable to be done good to, and he really does not know how to operate upon them. That is to say, these gentlemen have wills of their own, which do not bend to influence. But the poor have wills of their own too, and it is only our fictitious ideas of them which represent them as easy subjects of influence, to be done good to on mechanical principles. But, suppose the first perplexity of our pariah priest is over; he still feels the disadvantage of the necessary indefiniteness of a clergyman's work. A man in a Government office has his routine of work prescribed for him, a schoolmaster has his school hours, a medical Man has to go to those who send for him, and the work is laid out for the day in the shape of a certain sucCessiOn of calls. All these men work more or less in grooves, and their labour is in answer to X definite set of obligations; whereas a clezgyman in a parish has, with the single exception of the *Sunday, no definite routine carved out for himtn. Ee nnst see this and that person, must visit the sick, must make fiiendly calls on the poor; but the how often and the how long are left perfectly open and vague. Bverybody knows the disadvantage with which average men worlk under such circumstances. Give an ordinary man a particular thing to do at a particular time, ad if it is the work of his profesuion he wi do it as a matter of course; he will not feel much difficulty in his task; the defiiteness of it is itself the greatest assistance to him. Definiteneu o time and purpose puts work Into that compact, manageable shape, in -which it is mastered and grasped by the mind in the first instance; the man knows what he has to do, and se through his task to its conclusion. Defniteness is, indeed, the great prop of our indolent natere,-that which helps it to get through its daily work ; the business of the world is carried on by its assistance. Deprivea man, then, of the benefit of this prop, and throw him entirely on himself for his rule of work, and unless he is an extraordinary man he will feel at a considerable disadvantage. Under these circumstances it is no naatter of surprise if the Church exhibits a coiderable diffie encer in the quantity of work -which she gets out of her elergy. There is, first, that class - of clergy I which takes advantage of the indefiniteness of its - work for doing absolutely no work at all but this ig at the present not a large class. There is a Iecond and a middle class again, which cannot by- any means be identified with the first one, though 1 it ranks below the class of thoroug-il good -workers. This middle class, which is a tolerably large one, takes a conscientiou@ view of the duties of its position, tnd does work which, in point of quantity, is not- to be despised. bonscience and a sense of duty -may have all kds Eof obstacles to contend witli in the shapeof natural indolence, procrastixation, the invitations ofI I-society, the teitati6ne of literaNure gt easy( a~~~~nle,nss 'a.man rids himself altogetherofthcm,theygetsomowork out of-him. It is surprising what a number of calls upon a man's time even apopulation of 500 or 600 willereate. It is true they do not involve much difficulty or wear and tear; sill they take up time, and they bring him into contact with his parishioners. Everybody who knows anything of the clerical life knows what a number of visitors at the parsonage a morning oftenbrings. Old frs. CAuDm wants some flannel, and when she has been answered Mrs. TnsniN wants some brandy, having had dizemess inthe head for some days past; and then Mrs. Tsmupr wants to speak about her boy. A clergyman has to attend to all the naughty children, the weak stomachs, the asthmas, the rheumatisms, and the bad. legs in the parish; he is, besides his spiritual calls, expected to sympathize with all the bodily infnrmities in the village, and to listen to their history in its fullest details, from their earliest dawn to their present maturity. This is the sort oa work which visits the passon in his own study, and which mneets him in his own visits to the poor. It is true this middle class of clergy suffer in their exertions from the indefiniteness of their work. The afternoon is come, and old Widow JONEs has not been visited, simply because any time of the day would be the same to her; the parson opens the door, walking-stick in hand, determined that this duty shall remain no longer unfulled, but that this very next hour shall see its performance inscribed on the register of conscience and mercy. But, unfortunately, just at that moment a friend drives up. Now, if he were a Government official or a medical man he must go to his office or his patient, whoever drives up, and the friend must give way to work, but one time suits Widow Jozizs as well as another, so the friend is admitted and the widow is postponed. In this way a large class of clergy accomplish their clerical task, doing a good deal and omitting a good deal, alowing the indefinitenessof theiremployment to relax to a certain extent the execution of it, but still conscious of their deficiency, and always promising themselves an increase of vigour, resolution, andperseverance. With a31 these shortcomings, however, it may be admitted that the Church possesses even in this middle class of clergy a serviceable body that feels the call of conscience, and keeps up a more or -less active relation to and communion with the lower classes of the country, and teaches, consoles, and relieves them. A higher class of clergy, however, than this has been on the increase of late years,-a clas which makes the indefiniteness of the elerical task only a stimulus to its more zealous and minute pe-formance. It is not for us to say in what proportion this class stands to the main body. Of course, the number of the very highest order of minds in any profession is not large compared with the mass. It is gratifying, however, to know that the number has been growing, and that with all its bad consequences in the shape of relgious strife aud division the enthusiasm of later years has told practically upon parish work. The services of the clergy in the cause of national education especiaUy deserve acknowledgment-services in which they are too often very inadequately aided by the laity. Even the rich layman, or the country squire, with his thousands of acres, often thinks it quite enough if he gives his two or three guineas subscription, while the clergyman has to bear the main expense of the school. The clergyman is thus xaddled with the cost of even the secular education of his juvenile parishioners-an expense with which he is no more justly chargeable than he would be with that of providing them with shoes or stoclings. It is a secular advantage for the communication of which the clergyman is no more really responsible than the squire, and he ought to have much more assistance given by the laity in this work than he has.
While we are boasting pf our model prisons, and silent systems, and separate systems, what is the rtate of Newgate? Thix, which is the great metropolitan gaol, should surely be a pattern of good arrangement. If it is not the most roomy of our prisons, atleast it is the most important of them all, inasmuchasa very largeproportionof theLondonpriboners are passed through it at one or other stage of the proceedings which are taken against them. There we find men awaiting> their trial; convicts just condemned and temporarily detained until they can be remitted either to the hulks or to some other place of confinement; and, finally, the wretched culprits who are looking for the execution of their doom. Newgate Prison should emphatically be the best kept prison in the land. If we ate to judge from a letter with which an ex-lUnder-Sheriff has favoured us, and which we printed in this journal on Saturday Lmt, the arrangements for the prisoners are as bad as they well can be. The most desperate ruffians are abut up together within those gloomy walls to utter as much blasphemy and obscenity as they choose, to recount to each other the most stirring incidents of their past careers, to consolidate old friendships, and to plan fresh crimes. Bad as this is, it is not aLl Into the same room or cell with these miseants are thrust the novices of iniquity, and it may be men entiely innocent of offence. The result is just what might be anticipated. In a few exceptional cases the unfortunates who may have been thrown into such foul fellowship endeavour to resist the contagion, and do resist, but at what a cost I They are put to the bar of their guilty companions. They are jeered at, insulted, abused, mailtreated. They must take kdndly to wickedness, or pay the penalty. It must, however, be a rare case-although it sometimes occurs, as we shall presently showthat a really innocent person is immured in the walls of Newgate. Our police magistrates do their duty too well. The instances, however, in which young thieves and pickpacketsthe freshmen of crime-ard thrust in among the*-More hardened reprobates, must be far more frequent, if the sstem depieted by Mr. :Rosm is the usual one within the walls of the metropolitan prison. In remarking upon this gentleman's statements we are compelled to do that which we always endeavour to avoid-namely, mix up two subjects in one comment. In the present case, however, we must submit to the inconvenience, for the two points are so entirely connected that one cannot be discussed without bringing the other prominently forward. Mr. RosE's letter, which is written withLa feeling which does great honour to the writer, mainly refers to the scandalous anomaly which exists in the administation of the law towards prisoners wrongfully condemned. It is while describing the hardships undergone by an unfortunate of this class that Mr. Ross gives us a glimpse of the interior of Newgate. We wo endeavour as far AS pomible, to keep the two subjects apart. One day last week the Rev. Mr. DAVRs, the Ordinary of Newgate, addressed a letter to this journil, which we printed, in which he described the sufferings of a poor man named JoHN bst&zm&, who was wrongfully sentenced to penal servitude for four years, having been convictedl on a charge. of "aiding in uttering v-forged "checki.'; The man was entirely innocent, as it turicd out,-it was a case of mistaken identity. ThrouAh the huiman exertion of Air. Iloss Td M. J)vIs the man's innocence was finally established, and he 'was pardonedi - 3ir. Rosv n&wgive-u aniple -grounds for enitvjing our assition, that if-theie w-ere question of pardon it.. v *.e-:pardon. sho'Whave been asledk1oni :' . re ,!_ .. on .o r JoN MA.REMM ; it was not for him to receive *the -mockerrof-forgiveness for the -mlege .perpetration of a crime with w*hich Lae had never been concerned. This poor man was walking one Saturday in Oxford-street, *when a policemn= tapped him on. the shoulder4and took him off to the station-house. He was remandod from time to time for six weeks; for one month of the time ho was detained in the House of Correction,-for a fortnight in Newgate. Well, his trial came on, and Jonx M uAsr was unjustly condemned. The execution of his sentence began, and this was the manner of it. Did any of our readers imagine that such doings were afoot in tho principal metropolitan prison in these pabny days of high philanthropy t Thus write- Mfr. Rosz:" JoTx MARKHAMr was two months in Newgate picking oakum with tho convicts there, who in "this prison are all in one room together-three "murderers at one time, pirates who had delibe5rately plaimed wholesale masacres, to be accom- "panied by indescribable atrocities, burglars, g garotters, thieves from their birth, receivers, putters up of robberies, and the perpetrators of *unmentionable crimes. The amtutsemt of this "den of devilry is to narrate their crnmes, and to '.Pzan fre:sh ones." Why this is to take us back at one leap to the days of JosNAsHA WID the Great; this is the Newgate with which FaMDIra was familiar, surely not the pet prison of this century of experimental pbllantbropy ! Poor JO}N MARKHMS, who has just rteeived the QurEW's gracious pardon, was but a cheerless guest amid this fiendish crew. He was not of them, and would not be of them. Rascaldom, of course, rose in its dirty majesty to avenge itself upon the stranger who defied it, and shrank back from the pollution of its very breath. "JoHN aLu x:aEr," writes Mr. Ross, "was perse"cuted and tormented by his associates in Newgate "with the most virulent and relentless malignity." What a position for an innocent man ! But in course of time the torture of infamous society was exchanged for the torture of absolute seclusion. It was to nlillbank that uAw-.vas removed, and there the system is that of "s eparate confinement,"" a dlreadful system," as Mr. Rosz adds in his own name. he was locked up in his cell from halfpast 5 at night until 6 o'clock in the morning, without hearing the sound of a human voice. Mr. Rosy then teLs us how JonN 3M&RxHA, was affected during this period. " He had parted "with all his ready money and many of his things "for his defence; he had a wife and child; they' were utterly destitute; she parted with every "stick of furniture and every rag of clothing during his imprisonment, and many a day "was without a meal of victuals, and now, in " agony unutterable, he often thought of her, aud i' how she was existing." Such was the case of the innocent man to whom society has graciously extended its pardon. This, however, was not all. From M1illbank, MUrAr was removed to Pentonville; for he was to have a taste of every expedient which the ingenuity of modern philanthropists has devised for the reformation of prisoners, as well as of the primitive anarchy which reigns in the walls of old Newgate. For three months he was immured at Pentonvyle-kept all the time in solita-'y confinemernt. The seclusion in this prison iB so strictly maintained, that even in the chapel each prisoner is enclosed in a wooden box, where he can neither see others nor be seen himself. By M u 3e?s account, the suffering is verygreat under the system. "' In the " Ichpel at tho sound of a human voice the convicts "are often affected, faint away, or shriek out. " Why r I asked MARuxmx -"-it is, of course, 3Ir. Ross who writes ;-" 'Oh ! they think of home " ' or something of that, " he replied. It is not, however, our object here to discuss the merits or drawbacks of our variouis systems of pri-on discipline. We are speaking first of JoHn MA 'e case, and of the cases of all persons wrongfully convicted ; and, secondly, of the horrors in the interior of Newgate. After sxr months had elapsed-si r months spent in the terrible situation we have describedMA3nxar was pardoned. He is now without work, without means of getting a living, and his character is gone. People won!t believe in the innocence of the pardoned man. Nor is his case a singular one. Mr. Ross gives us briefly the heads of another dismal history of the lik-e kdnd. A man named ARfTr was found guilty upon a charge of highway robbery and sentenced to four years of penal servitude. It was all a mistake, and the mistake was discovered, but not in time. "Not long since," writes Mr. Rosa, " he stood "in my office an emaciated wreck of his former "self. Before he went to Millbank he said "he didn't know his own strength, and "could work without fatigue t'hie longest " day." It is not matter for charge against| our criminal system that such mistakes do occur from time to time, for a certain amount of error is inseparable from any syst^m that can be devised by man; but at least society is bound to give ample compensation to the unfortunate persons who have been unwittingly sacrifioed to the security of all. Mloro than this, and independently of this, we trust that immediate inquiry of the most searching kind will take plcoe with respect to Newgate Prison. Whether a man be innocent as JoHn MsuR, or foul with guilt as the foulest wretch in the " den of devilry" which Mr. Rosi has described, what can be expected if he is thrown for weeks and months among such associates as the members of the Newgate Club t

LoiD PA iUR Ox TIIX RETRsLATIOrx Or Tim BnLz.-Lord Panmnre, in presiding at the annual meeting of tho Edinburgh Bible Society on Friday last, made the following remarks on the subject of a new version of the English Bible:-" We have the Church of Rome atticking Protest3ntism fairly and openly in front; but I am sorry to say that we have in the ranks of Pzotestantism itself many whose hearts are Popish, but who cover thoe hearts with a mantle of apurious Protestantism. Amid all these dangers and all these attacks, I know of nothing so likely to be successful in resisting them as the dissemination of the Word of God in our good old Saxon tongue, as wo have had it for the last 300 years; and this brings me to make an observation which perhaps is not out of place on the present occasion. We lave 7eard a talk in the country, and we have seen absolutely put into practice in the United States of America, a scheme for what is called a new version of the Bible. Now, feeling very strongly on that subject, I take this opportunity of publicly stating my opinion that any such scheme is fraught with the utmost danger to the Protestant liberties of this country-nay, it is fraught with danger to the Protestant reli,gon itself. I look to Americ I am happy to find that the schemo there has been, I might almost say, utterly abortive. It is quite true, and every man must admit, thatthere are perbaps some slight thingssomenmistrauslations, slight in themselves, and not affecting any great principle-which might be corrected in a new translation of the Holy Scriptures, but they are so slight ist comparison with the danger of letting in those who would make alteations, partly from the criticism of erudition, partly for the purpose of getting in dogmas of their own, that I thinkit would be the most dangerous and most disastrous thing that could occur to this country if we were to permit those words to be tampered with, which have been household words in many a pious faily for upwards of 300 years, and I hope wi be the household words of all the families of the world before 300 years moro elapse. If we were to aUow those holy words to be tampered with, wo should be In the greatest danger of shaking our Protestant inatitutions to the foundation. We havo some old landmarks, and the Bible is the greatest of these,and, rather than risk the removal of these great landmarks of our Protestant institutions, I would submit to those little imperfections which rAy exist in our present version leavin it as part of the calling of our mimsters to study the Iolg°Srip. tures in the original tongues, to fit them to explainto thois wlho sit under them wherein those little differences exist. I am. quite certain of this, that if we had not an authorized and confirmed version of the Holy Scriptures we should never have arrived at this day with Protestantism so thorougbly and stanebly established as it is in this country at present. Therefore, I do hope that if any agittion is made in this country forthe purpos of disturbing the present authorized version of the Bible, thei Christian comunlity dwll rise up as one man in its defence, andwillmain it intact, seeing it is so dangerous to touch it. Itn. EhmLam AT 1 vTOrT.-I&. A. W. Kinglake, the author of Eet.en, has addressed a numerous body of the electors of lNewport as a candidate fortheir suffrages. In the course of his speech, after argmng for the extension of the franchise, the balot, the abolition of church-rates, a mationalsystemrof secular education, &c., he observed " I am strong of opinion that the high offices of this eountry are unduly distdbuted among persons of particular families, and belonging to a particular class in society, with- out due rgard to their qualifications for holding them. Ad whatis the reslt? Why,that in acountry abounding in intelligence and businem like power there is always one firm which is breaking down, and that is the firm of the Government. Here is a cdantry where there are men vho at a few months' notice will throw a railvwy from one city to another-who will -carry the electric wire along the depths of the ocean from one oontinent to another, and perform all those marvels of that decription which has made this age a wonder to all.

The cause is that tho Ministers and persons high in office re selected fron too small a number. (Hear.) If any of you, in conducting your business, were to make to yourmelves a law that you would only take persons whose names began with the letter A, or persons iin a particlar street or passage, how would your business go on ? Yet this iR the kind of restriction which is practically going on in the sleoction of men chosen to fill the high offices of the State. If you will bear with me, I will go for a few moments into this important question. As you know, all the high officers of State are taken either from the House of Peers or the House of Commons. The House of Peers consists of, I believe, 346 men, and the House of Commons consists of 5, so that, in round numbers, you have 1,00 people from whom the Mlinisters of State have to be selected. Vey wel. Now, of the 346 peers almost all, except our right rev, friends the bishops, and two or three law Lords, are selected by the mere ccident of birth. There remains then the House of Commons from 'hich to find tbe selected talent of the country. Now, I am going to venture upon telling you a home truth-an unpalateable truth. I do say that the constituencies have been wanting in their duty with regard to the selection of those whom they send to the House of Commons, and I do say that it is from this failure of duty on the part of the constituencies that there has been so much difficulty in finding men to fill the high offices of State. Why really, gentlemen, wo must confess, even though it may be an unpalatooble thing to know, that the sprinklint of able mnen which you have in the House of Commons, although it is slected by the people, is not very much groater than the sprinkldiutol abler men in the House of Lords, where the only test isthe mere accidert of birth. bare told7ot one caoIeadinS to tbeSnpAeqnacyof public nmen. Ithinkther Is another. think there 1 n nndue laxity in the members of the House of Commons. The duty of a member of the House of Commons is of a doublo charaoter. One of his duties, and that is the one which, rrhaps, you are most ccustomed to oonAider,is that of ma' =glaws, orrefus to make laws, and taling part in legislative disoussion. But another and moat important duty of every member of the House of Commons is that of watching the formation of the successive Governments who are'frm time to time selected. I do ay that in the performance or th duty the Houso of Commons has been too lax. There exists the irtctlee ot asldng men to give what is called confidence to te G^rern aent5 and the effoct of that is that aGovermeitthog not consisting of men sufficiently able to ghvea.raove ment which would not bear criticism whenyoucameto inquire whether one man or another is fit for the office h holds-is enabled to secure a c of tolerion1 becaus there is a feeling that tbere w-l be an inionvenienco in a change of Government. That is the threat lys iel&out to induce rmen to avoid a vote renderng xecesmarr -change of Government. Many men have a greAtdread -otC*an of Government. If they change so fequettlyit a, the time will come when England wIll be withot,aGover mcnt. Now,what tbey reay mean when thoysathat is, that England will be without a Government aelecedkom the accustomed class (hear); and when the day co England is to bo without a Government of that kin be a fortunnte day, asd not a dayof danger; for, depend upon it, you can never have good government or etouooay aX home, you never can havo that foresight and management whieh will bring uccess in war, until yVU withdr%*tho exclusive -ri;ht of Government from a few familie;,.ant seek for ablity, combined with high cha tracer, tbersve you can find it-from all ran1s, from all classes, thd fromx all conditions of men." £r.

BE FUNERAL OF THE ARCBIBISHOP OF PARBI . (Cro 0ou OWNi ' COR;PoNDENT.) PARIS, SATURDAY, JA1T. 10, 8 P.M. The obsequies of the Archbishop of Paris were celebrated this morning in the presence of an imXnense crowd of people, who evidently wished to testify their respect for the venerable prelate who has been so suddenly taken from among them. The morning wa, gioomy and intensely cold, and the ground still covered with the hail and melted snow which had faUen during the night; yet the bitterness and gloom of the weather did not prevent -he approaches to the Archiepiscopal Palace and -the Cathedral of Notre Dame from being tbronged vith a multitude. At 8 o'clock the Metropolitan {Chapter proceeded from the church to the resi-dence of the Archbishop to receive the body, 'Which had been placed on a catafalque, raised -under the principal entrance. The clergy and at-. itendants knelt around it, and, after some time spent in prayer, the cort6ge formed in the following detachment of Municipal Guards; the the Guaides; a detachment of the Regiment -of nides; a battalion of the Gendarmes of the Imperial Guard, with the band at their hecad; a bat-talion of the Line, with the drums muffled, and beating at intervals; six mourning coaches, in which were the members of the Metropolitan -Chapter, and attendants bearing the archiepiscopal iusignia-the crozier, the pectoral cross, the mitre, snd the pastoral ring, covered with crape; the hearse ,drawn by six black horses, led by footmen, and -surmounted by a silver cross. On it was placed the coffin, covered with black velvet, with gold inouldings, but without any other ornaments. Im-mediately in advance of the hearse walked a dosmestic in livery, bearing the star and riband of St. Maurice and St. Lazare, the riband of the Legion of Honour, and other decorations of the Archbishop; he was followed by the household. Then came the members of the Archbishop's family, accompanied and followed by a crowd of people Mblonging to every class of society, among whom were mingled officers of the army and navy, simple -seamen, and soldiers of the army of the Crimea, operatives in blouses, women, sisters of charity, and the brethren of the Christian schools; a battalion -of the Line, with its band of music and muffled drums; the carriage of the Archbishop; the Emperor's carriage, with the Grand Chamberlain, the Duke of Bassano, representing the Emperor; -and Prince Jerome's, followed by a long 4train of private carriages. The ground was -occupied by a double line of troops of the 20th, 11th, and 40th Regiments. The cort6ge -was closed by a squadron of Dragoons. The cords -of the pall were held by M. Molineri, canon of Paris; M. Faudet, cur6 of St. Roch and senior of -the parish priests of Paris; M. de Bories, curate of "St. Etienne du Mont; and M. Hugues, curate of the parish of Notre Dame. The grand entrance of -the church of Notre Dame was hung with black from the gallery known by the name of the Gakerie -desBis deFra4wetotheground. The walls ofthe interior were covered with the same sable tapestry. The Ministers, a numerous deputation of the 'Senate, with Marshal Pelissier at their head; depu - tations of the Council of State, of the Legislative -Corps, of the Municipal Council of Paris, of the mnagistracy, the clergy of all the parishes of the -diocess, the ecclesiastical colleges, and the other reliious institutions were present. In the choir of ihe church were seated the Nuncio, the Bishops of Wancy, Beauvais, Amiens, Orleans, Chartres, -Gu.idaloupe, Evreux, Toronto (Canada), Adras, Prassa inb partibhs, and Dardania in partbus. The Bishop of Blois, sufra-gan of the Archdiocess of Paris, was prevented by ilness from attending. Among the higher lay functionaries were Marshal Magnan and General 'Mahon, the superior members of the magistracy, and the members of the Institute. The Archbishop's throne was covered with black cloth, over which stood a gigantic crucifix in white. The catafalque was placed between the nave and the -choir, nearly in the centre of the church, with statues at the corners, and encircled by countless tapers, and above it rose a canopy of black cloth and ermine. The cortege, which had passed along the :Rue de Grenelle, the Rue de Bourgogne, the Place du Palais Bourbon, the Quays, the Pont Neuf, the Quai des Orfevres, and the -ue Notre Dame, reached the Cathedral about 10 o'clock. Crowds lined the streets, and the remains, '.borne slowly along, received marks of profound and, I believe, the most sincere veneration; esvery man bared his head, and beowed; several knelt on -the ground, all mud and melted snow as it was; and the women, some of them weeping, made, with every mark of devotion and sorrow, the sign of the --cross, beat their breasts, and repeated aloud prayers for the repose of the departed. On its arrival at -the entrance of the church the prebends and honorary canons, and the parish priests of the diocess, precededby the cross-bearer,went to thedoor -to receive the remains of theirlate Archbishop, and, -with the canons who had brought it from the Palace, bore them to the catafalque before the high altar. 'Ehen rose from the choir the solemn music of the --dead, and, after the mitre,'cracifix, and crozier of the prelate were deposited on the coffin, the funeral vservice began. The solemn dirge of the Dies Irce, which more than any other, excepting perhaps the MLiserere, awakes with the thoughts of the grave -those of atonement and redemption; the gloom of -the old building, made darker stiUl by the sombre -atmosphere and the melted snow, which pattered against the high windows; the black tapestry, varied by the armorial bearings of the prelate; the funeral costume of the attendant bishops and clergy; the body beneath the altar before which the departed biad so lately ministered; the pealing notes swel-ling through the lofty aisles, and floating along the -vaulted temple; the consciousness that the man -whose remains all were sorrowing over had not been -removed from among them by mortal decay, but had beenfoully murdered while in the performance of his -sacred office-all this seemed to make an appeal to -the heart which it would be difficult to express, but vvhich was told in many a moist eye. The Bishop of Meaux was the officiating prelate; -the service was performed with all the pomp of the -church, aud, from the number of priests who joined in it, was most impressive. During the mass salvoes -of artillery were fired, the bells tolled mournfully, a-nd at the elevation of the host the troops in the body of the cathedral knelt on one knee and pre- sented arms. At the close of the mass the five absolutions ordained by the church for an archbishop were slowly and solemnly pronounced. The bishops and clergy and all the personages present advanced towards the centre, and sprinkled the coffin with holy water. The crowd then gradually dispersed. The coffin waj%$j'k:Irposed on the catafalque. At 3 o'clock mumbirs returned to attend the vespers for the -dead; and at 4 o'clock the coffin was deposited in -thevaiult near the entrance of the choir, which is destined to receive the remains of. the Archbishop of Paris. This vault only contains five coffins; tho of Monseigneur do Juignd, who died since the firsb revolution; of Monseigneur du Belloy, who gave his resignation at the period of the Concordat in 1808, but didnot die until 1811; of Monseignear do P&rigo4, who died in 1821;. of Monseigneur de Qualenjwho, died at te close of 1839; and of Monneigaeur Afiw-eho was killed in 1848. -In 14s days5. iaccording to Usag9, the funeral oration of the-Arohbishop,ivill be preached by oao the canons of t vhe *trop.itXh Chapter. )tz45 been stated thatthe.heartof the-late,prelate,wrhicb Ad been embalmed separately, was to be deposited in the church of the Carmes. It is now positively maid that, at the request of {he cure of St. Etiennedu-Mont, it will be placed in the latter churfi, after the ceremonyof its puriBcation. A will written by the late Archbi3hop about two months ago at his country house of Belle-Eau, some shorttime before his return to Paris, has been found In his writing-dek. The document begins in these words:- " I die in the faith and love of the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Church, for the advancement of which I have never ceased to laboar in the different ranks of the sacred hierarchy; and these are my last wisbes." After dividing among the members of his family his private property, which is not considerable, and leaving to the Bishop of Tripoli a life annuity of 3,OOOf., and bequeathing some sums tohisdomestics, he leaves- " 1. To his metropolitan church his mitre, gothic stole, and other canonicals, with his ring of rabies and emeralds; the richly-bound missal offered to him by Monscigneur de Dreux Breze on the occasion of his consecration, and the collection of medals relative to the principal acts of his episcopacy, with the box which contains them. 2. To the seminary of Paris 400f. for an annual grand mass for ever. 3. To the titalary canons of Digne 400f. for 200masses. 4. To the parish of St. Paul Trois ChAteaux, his native town, the episcopal chapel which he purchased at Lyons at the time of his promotion to the see of Paris. 5. To the cure's residence at Rai, parish of Belle-Eau, his books at that place. 6. To the poor of Digne a sum of 1,OOOf. 7. To the orphan establishment of the same place a sum of 500f. 8. A sum of 10,000f. to be distributed to the poor of Paris by the members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Sisters of Charity, the Petites Scours des Pauvres, and the cur6s of all the parishes of the capital." The Bishop of Tripoli, the Abbh Darboy, and the AbbW Dedoue, are among his executors.
SARDINIA. OPENING OF THE COAMRIRK We have already published a brief aummary of the Speech of the King of Sardinia on the opening of the Piedmontese Chambers on the 7thinst. We now give the text of the speech:- " Gentlemen, Senators and Deputies,-The last time I came among you to open the past session a great war was beingwagedin the East. Sardinia took a vigorous and disinterested part in it. Our army as well as navy, competing in all military qualities with the most celebrated armiea of the world, contributed to the pacification of Europe, and increased the reputation of their country. (Cheers.) " The Parliament, interpreting the sentiments of the nation, has already fulfilled a duty of gratitude and affea. tion by paying a tribute of well-deserved praise to those brave men. Associating myself with you on this solemn occasion, I repeat with pleasure that 'they have deserved well of their country.' (Loud applause.) " The Congress of Paris has put an end to the war; it has strengthened the bonds of allianco which unite us to France and England, and has re-established our former friendly relations with the Emperor of Russia. " Sardinia has acquired the reputation of having ae. quitted herself vith political prudence and with civil courage. For the first time in a European congress the interests of Italy have been advocated by an Italian Power (immense applause), and it has been proved beyond evidence that it has become a necessity toimprove her condition for the general welfare. "My Government, confident of your support, seconded by the sentiments of the nation, which incessantly are manifested by grand and spontaneous demonstrations, wll adhere firmly to the line of policy which we have entered upon. (Renewed cheoring.) " T'he return of peace, more favourable harvests, the gradual development of the national prosperity having improved the condition of the public finances, you will for the first time have to discuss a budget in which the expenditure will be f airly balanced by the receipts. " Less occupied by fiaancial measures, you will be enabled, gentlemen, to complete theleforms in the provhwcial administration and judicial organization, public instruction, and other branches of the service which have occupied you before. " Gentlemen, Senators and Deputies, "The severe trials which, with the aid of Providence, we have surmounted, the great works completedin the maidst of extraordinary financiai diffliculties, the part we have played in European politics have proved the power and the efficacy of the institutions granted to his people bynrymaganim4us father. Those institutions, rendered still firmer by the Entimate union which exists between the Throne and the nation, will assure to our country a possperous and a glorious future." His Majesty concluded his speech amid the most enthusiastic cheering. Sir James Hudson, the EngLth Minister and the Ministers of France, Russia, 1Prussia, and 13elgium, and all the members of the dlplomatic corps, were present.
TESTIMONIAL TO DA. rIVILGSTOf. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As I see there is a movement in London to recognize in a substantial manner the self-denying, indefatigable, and truly heroic conduct of Dr. Livingston, and as the move ment may not extend to the provinces (although the object is truly national), I beg to enclose a contribution of 5R. I have long watched the Dootor's career with intense interest, as glimpses of intelligence have arrived during his 16 years of heroic self-devoted travel for the good of Africa, science, and the world. It Is only my other numerous claims that prevent me sending a much larger donation. I send this to you in the hope that some of the friends who have so liberally aided me in my efforts for the welfare of Africa may also assist this worthy and devoted philanthropist in bis future labours for the good of mauldnd.

SHOC=G DnATH.-On Saturday a coroner's inqest was held at Reading on the body of a man niamed lsaac Clifford, who met with his death in an awful manner. From the evidence adduced it appeared that the deceased was in the employ of Messrs. Russell and Mlrtin, brewers in the town, and on Thursday last was chiefly engaged in the brewhouse. About 5 o'clock on the afternoon of the day in question, when a quantity of boiling liquor had-been. drawn off from the copper into tbe hop-baek, he ascended a step-ladder in order to-turn a tip to let iome cold liquor into the CODper. To accomplish this it was necessay for him on )eaThing the top of the stepe to seize a cord hanging from a beam above ; he reached out bis hand to do so, but unfortunately missed it, which caused him to swerve, and, losing his footing, he fell into the hop-back, which was filled with boiling liquor. Two fellow workmen and Mr. Martin, one of the firm, were close at band at the time, and they instantly drew the unfoatunate man (who wax resting on his head and covered uearly to his knees) from the boilng liquid. His head, face, and ehest were fearfully scalded, and to obtain every requisite attention he was removed to the. hospital immediately upron being 6trippediand wvrapp?edin 'flannel. 1'he poor fellow's system, ho'wever, proved to have received FO severe a shock that be never rallied, and death took place the same night The jury returned a verdict of " Accidental death."

It is the first thing in the nature of aftte that the executive body has provided for the yenr on which we have just entered, and may be regaraed as the beginning Of aseries of populargatherings,full of thepromise ofjterest and rational enjoyment, which all classes of the. inhabitants of the metropolis and the whole an. rounding neighbourhood, with thousands of visitors from all parts of the country, may fairly anticipate during the coming season in tho Palaco at Sydenham, which has opened up to Us new and almot inexhaustible sources of agreeable recreation to diversify the ordinay current of our dailylives.. Besides the noveltylof an exhibition of this kind in the Palace, and its interest to a great urban community like that of London, suggestive, as it is, of rural life and its associations and pursuits, it has the unquestionable merit of utility, as tending, with others of a kindred nature now being held at intervals i4 other parts of the kingdom, directly to refine the various 'breeds and to enhance the aggregate productiveness of a class of animals used in furnishing odible articles for the table, the raritY of which, as compared with the general abundance of the ordinary necessaries of life, has always made them more or less of a luxury within the reach only of the wealthier orders. The growing interest now taken in the rearing of poultry, and the expenditure of time and money in the pursuit, are fresh exemplifications of that inteDin ligence and patriotism operating in a subsidiary direction which have of late years, and now more than ever, prompted men engaged in the cultivation of the eoil to devise and apply new means of stimulating its latent energies and of 'mproving the breed o. cattle, on which the staple food of the whole population so essentially depends. It is also a pursuit which is no longer confined to the wives and daughters of the farmer, with whom we have been Aceustomed almost exclusively to connect it, but one which is novW diffusing itself among more wealthy and refined classes of the community, especially among the female members of the families of the gentry and clergy in the country, and even of the nobility and aristocratic orders. For example, we find among the contributors at this exhibition the names of Lady Eleanor Cathoart, Miss Florence Cathcart, Lady Dacre, Lady Margaret Macdonald, Lord Robert Grosvenor, Sir Joseph Paxion, Baron Rothschild, the Hon. Amss Dillon, and Miss Ethelred Dillon, Mrs. Ellis, Sudbury-park, Richmond, aud an incredibly large number of others of high station in the country. The number of clergymen and their daughters contained in it is remarkably great, and that this is not a proof that the former belong to the too numerous class of " Poor curates," as might at first be supposd, may be inferred from the fact that under the rule of the exhibition which compels all contributors to affi, a price to the specimens they send some of them have put down inordinately large sums, one of their number especially, the Rev. Lyon Pellowes, Beighton PRectory, lNorfolk, who is an ex. hibitor toa large extent, having stated 1,0004. in almost every instance as the ptice of each of his pens, consisting in oach case of the customary number of three fowls. The present exhibition has been entirely carried out under the personal superintendence of lMr. William Houghton-a gentleman of great practical experience in the rearing of poultry and its general arrangement; and the brief space of time in which so large a coilcation of specimntens has been brought together reflects credit upon his energy and taste. The exhibition occupies the south wing of the building, which the visitor traverses on his wya from the railway terminus to the interior of the palace; and the pens are conveniently arranged for inspection in four tiers along the whole extent of the wing. On two occasions, a few years ago, a similar exhibition was attempted in the metropolis, but, principdly from the want of a suitable building in which to hold it, theresultwasnotsuch as to-warrant its furtherrepeti.' tion. For this, s for so many other interesting spectacles, it ias reserved for the Cryst PAlace to afford a fitting abode. There the vistors see it under the advantage of an abundance of light, and freed from the inconveniences of a eapriclous climate. The exhibitiot contains no fewer than 1,270 separate pens of animals, including poultry, pigoons, and rabbits in all their several varieties, each pen generally containing three specimens. There are about 100 pens less tliin at the recent exhibition at. Birmingham, but as respects the quality and excellence of 'he birds it is. said by those best able to form an accurate opinion to be in every way equal. Not only have the principal exhibitofs at Birmingham sent birds to the present exhibition, but also many of those who took prizes at previous shows in the metropolis, and at that helM at Anerley lst year. It is admitted, indeed, that the collection includes some inferior specimeus, but perhaps this is unavoidable. The pens in which the speci. mens are shown are superior to those used on any former occasion. They are painted in the interior with the pale blue which characterizes the wholeof the Cryst Palace, the effect of which has been to bring into stronger light both the good and bad qualities of the birds than has ever before been attained. This has been the general result, but in many cases, especially wiLh birds of light plumage, it bas been otherwise, operating, as it does, to disturb the harmony of colour. That so large a number of specimens should have been collected at so short a notice is regarded as a signiicant proof of the extent to which the taste for breeding poultry prevails at the present time. One of the main objects of this, as of all other similr exhibitions, being to afford an opportunity to breeders to improve their collections, the considerations which govern the decisions of the judges In all cases are high condition, quality, beauty of plumage, purity of race, and uniformity in the markings, combs, and other characteristics, in the several classes of fowls, in a greater degree than mere weight without these distinctions, if the more perfect sped. mens re at tho same time of a fair average size. The udgvs of poultry aro Messrs. Andrews, Baily, and Ieswitt; of pigeons, Messrs. Bellamy and Cottle; and of rabbitsg Messrs. Baneks, Fox, and Housden. Space does not admit of the names being given of those to whom prizes have been awarded-nearly 300 persons in the aggregate ; and it would be invidious to make a selection. Some dis. atisfaction exists at the rule, though madp in the interest Of the public, 'which obtins at this and all kindred exhibi. t'ions, of compelling the exhibitors in all eased to affix a price to each specimen at which he is willing to sell it, al providing for all sales being transacted through the medium of the managing body rather than by individual exhibitors, Be this as it may, it is cain that one part of the rule is openlY evaded by several of the contributors, of whom tho Rer, Lyon Fellowes, of Beighton Recto,y, NTorfolk, is an eminent exmPIe, attahing a prohibitory price to their birds, amounting in many cases to 3,0004 Theclasses distinguishedbythejudgesformarked saprior ity re two of Spanish poultry, consisting in one case of a cock and two pullets (chickens of 1856), and in the other of a Spanish cock of any age, the first prizes in which were carried off by liss M.

This officer entered the navy in the spring of 1796 as first-class volunteer on board the ConQorde, 36, Captain Anthony Hunt, whom he followod, in August of the same year, into Lsa Virgnie, 38. After cruising on -the Irish and Baltic stations he ailed for the East lndies, where from September 1798, unUtl his return to England in April, 1803, he served on board the Saffolk and Victorious, 74's, flagships of Viee-Admiral Peter Rainier, and the Orphous, 3Z, commanded by the late Hon.

During that period, besides vWisiting the West Indies and the Baltic, he accompanied the expedition against New Orleans, where he served on shore in the breaching batteries and in command of a body of seamen, and was particularly noticed for his exertions by Sir E. T. Troubridge. He attained the rank of captain on the2d of-September, 1816, and accepted the retirement on tWe 1lt of October, 1846. On the l1th of June, 1851, he was placed on the list of retired rearadmirals. Several extensive improvements and alterations are being carried out at Chatham Dockyard, which, when completed, will make that establishment the most commodious Government dockyard in the kingdom. One of the principal improvements now in progress is at No. 7 granite slip, which is to be lengthened 60 feet, giving a length of 330 feet. In order to give a solid foundation to sustain the immense weights which will be laid on this slip, an immense number of pileshavej,een driven, on which is laid a bed of concrete 15 feet in depth to receive the granite floor. The width of this sUlpwill be 80feet. The roof is of galvanized iron sapported onfiron colums. No. 2 dock is aso in course of being lengthened to 360 feet, and will be the largest dock of any belonging to the naval establishments. Considerable difficalties have been experienced during the progress of this work by the constant brealdng in of. the water, to remedy which two powerful steam pumps have been erected, which discharge four tons of water per minute day and night. A new workshop for the convicts has been erected at the eastern end of the dockyard, 240 feet in length and 30 feet in width, contiguous to which i a double range of buildings for cement mills, the machinery for whichwill be erected this week. The whole of the above works are being carried out by Mesrs J. and C. Rigby, of Westminster. A new polce-station is also being built by Messrs. Foord and Sons, who have just completed a xuppling kiln, in which the timber used in. the dockyard willbesteeped. The station formerlyused bylhe dockyardforce has been removed to miakeroomfortheimprovements in progress. A new 36-guan frigate, to be called the Mersey, has beets commenced at Chatham Dockyard. She is laid down in the new Ulip.from which the Etna floating battery was launched some time since. The Hersey will be one ofthe longest frigates in the service, it being intended to construct her upwkards of 300 feet in length. The Racoon, 21, one of the new description of ewrw corvettes now being built at Chatham, is progressing very fast, and Is expected to be ready for launching in the ensuing spring. This vessel and her sister ship the Charybdis, 21, wMl be fitted with machinery of 400-horse power. Her Majesty's steamvessel Antelope arrived at Portsmouth yesterday from Woolwich. Her Mfajosty's steam troopship Simoom, 18, Commander Cokce, had her compasses adjusted in Portsmouth harbour on Saturday. Her Majesty's pddle frigate Furious, 12, was taken out of dock at Portsmouth after repairs on Saturday, and into the steam-basin, to completo her refit.

Thedeceased was a very steady woman, hut the prisoner was Occasienally addicted to drunkenness. Mr. Dyke, surgeon, having restated the inturies found upon the person of the deceased, described the condition in which she premises were found by him when he was called in. Begcle a(jun -tyof recent bloc;a staeilnls observed on the kice thn n wall, witness noticed that a quantitY of lime from tho wall at the side of the stairs had boen ki.ocked o, as though by the tse or heel of a boot.

The prisoner sked whether thero were any injuries on the legs of his wife, and, on being answered in the negative, he made a statement that the deceased had some time previosly fallen down stairs b acident. r. Superintendent Wrenn having given a anni 1:r account to that of Mr. Dyke of the appearance presented by the premises on being called in, added that, on asking the prisoner if he knew whether anyone had been in the house, he said, 'A man named Ezekiel was here in the morning, and he went out with me to the Riners' Arms about 12 o'clock We had some beer together, and I eame home about half-past2. Ilbad some dinner, butdid not eat it all. My wifo told me she had been to the Post-officewith some letters. I asked her for a shilling, but she was not very wlling to give it, and scolded me forhaving been drinking; but at hlst she gave me a halfsovereign, and made me pro. mize to bring back the change. I then went out and changed the halfsovereign, and had two quarts of beer. I then went to the Plymouth Arms, where I spent 6d." He stated further that he came home at about 7 o'clock, and fincing he could not gain admission he sayed about for some time, and then forced the door, when he found his wife lying at the foot of the airs all over blood. He then moved her into the kitchen, and called to ir. Morgan as soon as he came in. No money being found on the person of the prisoner, he explained this L,icutsitance by saying that as he was knocking at the door a girl came ap to him and took it out of his pocket. Ezekiel Jones, the rnan refer-ed to in the statement made by the prisoner, contradicted his assertion as to nis wife having given him a halfeovereign; and other witnesses were also examined, whose testimony was in direct oppoition to the account given by Iewis of the manner in which he occupied himself on the day in question. At the close of the evidence the prisoner made a rambling statement, after which the coroner summed up, *nd the jury, after a deliberation of about a quarter of an hour, returned a verdict of "Wilful Murder ainst John Lewis," who was thereupon committed fvr
TRADE WITH A USTRAL TA TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Aait appears to me that those trading with Auz. trlia runa *great risk of having to pass ithrotgh an oraeal s ar to that which tried so many of our merchants two or throe years ago, I havo taken the liberty of jotting down some of the daton vhich my opinion is founded, allowing you to give pXabUcity to these facts if you think proper. The letters which have been reoeived from Melbourne for some months back have been evidently written under the impression that shippers in this country wera likely to overstock the market. Those brought by the Montmorcacy rmention the opening of a brisk spring trado, but state that prices have not as yet advanced; nor, with the very Lrge import our markets have latterly groaned under, can increased rates at present be looked for." The imports into Melbourne are stated to amount, from the1st of January to the 13th of September, 1856, to 8,752,6011., whereas, for tho same perIod of 1855, they were only 6,951,328. Bnt when the inports of the last tro months of each of tbese periods are compared they show that 1856 bad excoeded 1855 by at least 37 per cent. Will it be believed, then, Sir, that the exports from this country to Victoria have been increasing ever since the last datereferredto? Yet, such isthe case. Thetotalexportsfrom London, Liverpool, and the Clyde duringtheyear 81s were 2,694463.in amount; whereas, for18i6theyare 5,076,801L veryartiele ofexport, soft gods, boots and shoes, brandyc Britishsplrits,maltliquors, driedfruit,cheose,bntter,appear tohave been shippedin excessivaquantitieslatterly. But not to trouble JoU with details I may givo one or two facts (illustrating this statement) with reference to butter, which continued to pay exporters f'n a long time. In Septembor ast It became wretchedly dull of sale in Melbourne, for they were then beginning to receive the shipments made fcra this country in Jue last, which were no less than 9,461 cwt. The legitimate export of it appoars to bo 3,000 or 4,000 cwt. per month. Considerably abovo this quantity has been exported sinoe Iast June; but what may be expected to be the value of the article abroad when they receive the hipments of December, 1856, which reached the enormous quantity of 8,70S cwt. 7 Dhring the first quarter of 1856 the exports from Lordon Liverpool, and Clyde to Victoria averaged under 300,0001. of value per month. But they have in the subsequent months of the year varied betweoen 414,0001. and 53,000L4 per month. In December they were 527,7241. This excess of shipments appears to arise froma the fact that too many people are engaged in exporting taAustralia. If every person who has adopted this busiuess sips to sove extent the markets must bo overstocked; but, addition, a great many occasional shippers are still tempted to make an adventuro whenever they see an articlo reported in the prices current at 25 or 30 per cent. advane. on invoice cost, forgetful that a deduction of 15 to 20 per ce=t. has to be made from tXhe amount solU, in the shape of paoibaee, fickght, insurance, interest, commissions, d; Thi1s process aves nothing but a moderate profit in a market where anchl riss have to be ran, and whence remittances are so long coming.

We have, -of oourse, thisstatement: 1,000 -.1,030 : 25'15 francs the fourth term=25-90 francs Also, since 26150 franca = £1, 1 therefore 1 franc =-2 2615 and this extprice of £l. = 6 fr. = 6-£; 26-5 and iherefore of £100 it = 100 -0 - £ 265 60 12 - -£ = - £2262615 513 or 2JI. nearly That is, the price of gold in London is 2 per cent, greater than in Paris;or a bill which would Emile a; person to, receive 1001. in old in London would cost 102*1. in Paris."

THE FrENC C g-lREDIT MOnIIEL-The fact is that, disgaise it as yoa will, the Cr6dit Mobilier is nothing more and nothing less than a joint-stook company with limited RiabiliW, and possesing a large capital, spoculatinc ares. If it does, in fact, promote industry and public works, it does so i' precisely the same manner as any other delier in tbe shares of publio compenies. It it able, no doubt, by investing in the saes of one conoemrto rai8e them in the markot, and to give the undertaling a, prestige to which its merits may or may not rightfnlly exttitle it, and it may by selling at very low pYia-hixudro the reputation of another; but it is perfectly absurd to, supposo that its operations have anything else in view than the profit of its shareholders and mniagers. No fault, however, can be found with the CreUit Mobilier merely because it steadily pursues its own interests, and baa no regard for those of other people. A purely commercial asociation is not expected to be generous; if it be merely jinst, that is all we can fairly require at its hands. But, on the other hand, we may well question the policy of the Imperial Government, which has called into exlstenoe a great stock-jobbing company, with limited liabilty, has nrirtualy given it the monopoly of the Bourse, and has invested it with extraordinary powers of rasing money. What ehanco bas the private speculator, with hisl Million of rone and his unlimited responsibility, against the Cr6dit Miobi1ier, which wields six milions under the shield of limited liability, and has the power of creating twenty-four willions more by the issue of obligationst Tleformer is completely in the hands of tbe latter, and exists only by sUfi%rasrc picking Up the crunb which fall from tbe table of his more fortunate rival. Again, there ean be little doubt that the appearance in the field of a speculator who possesses such a capital and such peoL. bil:ties as the Credit Molilier must act as a powerful stimulus to all manner of new schmkes.

The fluctuations uprin 'the. day were consequent almost entirely apon-the pressure for accommodation, neither the announcement of the proximate solution of the Neuchatel question on the one hand, nor the report from Constantinople of Persia having called upon Russia for assistance on the other, having produced any noticeable variation.

Although the market has been assisted by the fact that the 1,000,0001. of Exchequer-biLn latefr created under -the wnthoHity of the act of last session have been taken by the Bank, instead of- being presed for sale, the external demand upon the part iof holders has been increasingly active, and would :evidently, if alloted to proceed, have operated to the inconvenience of the commercial public.

A variety of vonfused statements appear to bePi *erqulation on the Continent regardlng'the coneemion just granted for the formation of an Imperial National Bank at Constantinople. The raising of a loan and a number of other' objectionable features are reported to be among the conditions, and, adcording to one announcement, v;W Marseilles, the amouat to be thus provlded is 12,000,0001., at percent. interest., These rumours are believed to be altogether without foundation. Beyond the fact that -the concession has been granted to Mr. Wilkid, as the repreaentative of certain London capitalist who are to pply'sadeposit of 200,0001., that i duration is to be for SO years, that the bank is tp have an exclusive right of issuing convertiblb notes, which are to be a legal tender, an that- the Turkish Govdrnment are to alloir 6 per cent. for suoh advances as may be r- -'quired for redeeming the existing currency, littl -is knowvn ith regard to it.

The prospectus has been issued of the Ceylon Coolie Transport and Steam Navigation Company, with a oapital of 50,0001., in 101. shares. The object is to introduce a rapid and inexpensive meaus of transit for the large number of Cooie laboarers -constantly passing to and fro between Ceylon and the Madras Presidency, as well as the neighbouringislands. A large and profitable coasting trade is likewise capable of being opened up. at present * the cooaes perform their passage mostly in native boats to a port on the north-west side of the island, wvhence they have an unhealthy inland journey of five days to the coffee districts. By being conveyed -!direct to Colombo they will almost entirely escape -fatigue and delay. The want of the proposed mean;s of comiunication has long been admitted, and the local Governet have contemplated its establishmnent even at their own cost. It. is strictly, however, within the sphere of regular enterprise, and -with the general support of the commercial body it has the prospect, under good management, although' started in an unpretending manner, of realizing full profits and of carrying out a reform which will aid greatly in developing the resources of Ceylon.

FEMAlE CONYXICT TO THE EDITQR OF THE TIES. Sir,-I have juzst obaerved a paragraph ill ah' Edinb.rh newspaper, headed "Enlargement of the General Prison at Perth," from whioh it would appear that Government h4s accepted tenders for the erection, at a cost of nearly 30,0001D of a new wing to that prison, to contain 204 cels, with suit' -able association-rooms for the confitnement of female convicts upon the principle of association. * . Assuming that the above statement is cotreet, the onl inference that I can draw from it is that Govermixent is aetermined to persevere in the system whvich has for some years past been followed in the treatment of' convicts, andwhich has been so generally condemned by judges, governors of prisons, and others best quaified to express an opinion on the subject. uu a When the general prison at Perth was opened in 1842 females under sentence for 12 months and upwards were received into it from the different eounties in Scotland, and during their impisonment were strictly predeuded frotnassociation ; biut, iotwvitl~anaig thig the most effcie4t means were bsed.for trjning them,tD. it abits of indistr a'id instilling into,them sound moral:priseiples, the nm l bers who relapsed i4toorbue. were so great that in 'May 1849, the female establishment was broken up, and onl male prisQners received, Ater that time. i That the experiment had proved .a complete. failure is sbown b7 the Beports of the Geeneral Board of.

Thoironnasterse quarterly meeting concluded at Dudley thisnevning, and was moderately well attended. Prices remained'extremely firm and it was stated that during the week-extensive sales haA been effected, chiefly for the sup. ply of North American demand. The high rate of disceuntfsoX ilU checks operations, but notwithstanding the millsind, forges of the district are well employed. AttStoutbridge yesterday the price of coal and stone was well supported, and no further attempts were made to reduce-the vi,es of the thin coal colliers. Although best descipts, houem coal from the new pits on Cannock. chas¢i-r' vanced a few weeks ago, the consumption has gceauyinr*eased, and a ready mnarket is obtained for all the rmines art present capable of producing. Threironfounders of Dudley, Westbromwicb, Wednesbury Stourbridge, and the adjoining manufacturing neigh- bourl 6j4sj contribute by their demands greatly to the presen.prosperousAtate of the iron trade. Many railway orderswe inisand, and several companies have within the present week advertised for new tenders for the supply of all desriyions of ironwork. Work has generally been resumed the- manufactories- of the district, and the season hasp,ssed off ipparently tothe satisfaction of'both masters and nihi . Tlere is little new to-report with regard to the trades of Birming'am. They continue to be generally well employed, sad ome of them are extremely basy. The factors of Birmingham who have concluded stock-taking are preparing for t4efirst journey of the year, and speak hopefuy of the future. During Christmas, when travellers are at home, littleJbasiness is Busualy transacted, but this season a fair sprinklng of orders have been received by most of the principalPhoses engaged in the general ironmongery trades. Both canaa and railway traffics have greatly increased, so mauch so that many leading firms have complained of the difficulty experienced in obtaining prompt transit of their goods. It isitated that an atempt will be made to annul the fiat of banktruptcy issuedagainst Messrs. Rice, Harris, and Son, glass iannufacturers. A body of the creditors are desirous that business should be carried on under inspection ; but, on the other hand, new creditors, who have little hope that the estate will be benefited by such a course, insist that the bank4iptcy should proceed. The meeting'for the choice of as gees is fixed for Friday newt, when this point will be setied. Mlr. Lane, long a well-known papier-mach6 xmanufacturer of this town, and who had also an extensive establbment in London, is now also before the Birmingham District Court of Bankruptcy. NOTTINGaAMf, JAN. 10. The Iace-market has been visited by a few German buyers, but it, 3yAt too early to expect, much to be done either for the home or the American trades. All, however, is cheerfulness and activity, prospects for the future being exceed' ingly bright, if not interfered with by the furtber rises which continua to be made in the value of silk-. This causes corresponding advances in the price of goods. The plain bobbin,-net trade is in a flourishing condition. Therei's a good demand from al quarters for every description of cotton hosiery. The large increase which has taken-place in theprice of cotton yarns has a tendency to reduce stocks, and many of the 'warehouses have been com. pletely cleared of nearly all kinds of cotton goods. Cotton yarns are 50 per cent. dearer than they were at this period last year, and cotton forming a main item in the cost of ocal productions the difference in the price of goods is something serious. Notwithstanding there is a good trade doing:manufacturers who have any stocks have a decided advantage, over those 'who have not made this preparation, and can sell their goods freely. Cotton yarns have again advanced It. a bundle, and are expected t6go np.farther. Even at the increased rates spinnaers are umnwlling to take contracts. LEICESTE1R, JTA, y 0. 1 The-hosierytrade has improved a shade. Through the caution with which mianufactares have acted for a long time pais the stocks in hand are light, and the high price of cutto`'.n`y has prevented them msaking their usual purchases However, as there seems no possibility of a reduction, hosiers will be obliged to submit; and goods will be disp2ed of at; prices under a fairly remunerative profit, We dyashave risen a halfpenny per lb., and wools continue at an enormions quotation. 'lrade geaera33y has a cheering appearance, and every prospect exsts of a busy LEEDS, JAR. 10. The *oollen cloth trade maintains a steady activity, and the demand keeps pace with the supply. The prospect for the spring trado is gradually opening out in a satisfactory manner, and both manufacturers and merchants are pre. paring.to do a good business, both the home and the foreign trade promising welL One large house in Leeds has lately received an East India order for 30,000 ends of striped goods siitable for the India and Chinese markets, and this extensive de'mand has caused considerable activity in some of the nesghbouring villages. The latest accounts from Canada, the United States, and the Australian colonies are all of i favourable character, and an increased business with those parts is anticipated. Some Government contracts Areaso giving a fair share of employisent to the manufaufthrers, and the operatives in the different branches of the 0oolen trade have entered upon the year with good prospets, having full employment at fair wages, accompalnied by bread at lower prices than provailed the greater part of the past year. In the cloth halls this mornink there was a fair attendance of buyers, who bought freely of such goods as suited them; but stocks are low, and hence a good deal of business is done by order or purchase out of the market. Prices are firm, with an upward tendency, as those of wools and dye-wares continue to advance. As to wools, the supply is small, and brokers or dealers, or 'whoever have this raw material in their possession, show no inclination to sell bht at rates higher than they aMked a month ago. The quantity to be offered at the forthcoming colonial sales in London is expectedto be small but, as a counterbalancing drcumstance, It may be mentioned that there is reason to believe that this yeafs arrivals from Australia will be earlier than last. The flax trade here is active, but trindoially for low yarns. The demand for the fier kdnds is not^brisk There is some improvement in the different branches of the iron trade, but the locomotive department has not recovered from its late depression. There hass been a slight improvement in te demand for worsted Xnd yarn to-day, and the wvorsted trade generally is looking usp, as the ortlera for spring are'comingmi. Wool rules high, even higher than last week, hut' not much business has been done to-day. e BADFORD, TA. 10. The worsted trade during the past week has beenin a healthy condition. The holydaysover andChristmas stocktaking generaUy completed business resumed its usual course. The gradual improvement in wool, which has continued frpm market to market in qualities suited to comb. ingpurposes, was steadily maintained. The demand was particurarly brisk for fine brioht-aired wools, prices of which were very stif as stocks m staplersb bands are small - and in the transactions that took place the tendency upwards was still observed. The business done in all combing desriptions was principally for positive immediate requirements. As the supplies offerng, however, are comparatively limited, in coaatrast to their usual proportion to the consumption, there caan e no doabt that present prices Will be mairntainkd; indeed, an opinion prevails in the trade that a farther advance Will be realized. Short wools met a oddemlud, the production in this district being more miedthvs formerly, and prices were steady. The supply of noils, as brought to market, found buyers at faU rates The stateof the yarn-market has been tight. Spinners being well employed in the completion of orders received prior to, lhe close of the year were indisposed to renew them exCept at enhanced figures, hence few new contracts were accepted by them during the week. The demand, however, is good, and it will steadily improve as manufacturers exhaust their present limited stocks. Cotton warps, although there was not much business in themn, were fim, as the impression is that a further advauce will be obtained in the cotton-market. In the piece trade there has been quite an average business for the season. Manufacturers are now busily employed with orders; extensive contracts entered into at the termination ofthe year, in anticipation of the further rise VrognOsticated in the raw material, keep their looms well engaged. Milerchants had to submit to the rising tendency in odertha. te mnufctuersmaycover the gradually increased 'ot of production. ustres and Orleans mostly partke ~tbeenhncemnt,and obugs~inll do to as the sasaon aavxaices sad the inquiry becomes more extensive.

PnTn.Tql lThis insolvent, who described himself as in architect% petitioned under the protection acts as a non-trader. hlr. Sa-rgood opposed for a W. Billing; and Mr. Reed supported. Some prelinary sldrmishing took place, the insolvonVs counsel Irst requiring proof of the authority of tho attorney to oppose, whicn the Court declined-to order, and then in. sistiDg upon the opposing creditor's debt being provedin the first instance, Ths demand was refused by Mr. Sargood, who contended that, as there waw a judgment, and,the insolvent had inserted the debt in his schedule, 'which he had sworn to, there was no ground to require further proof at that stage. Mr. Commissioner Pm}Ps at first thought the debt ought to be p roved, hut, after consulting the Chief Commnissioner, who neld a different opinion, permitted the opposition to proceed, and announced his determination to pursue that course in future. M1r. SARGOOD then examinedtheinsolvent, and elicited the fact that at the date of the contraction -of Mr. Biling's debt he (insolvent) was a builder and undertaker, and conxeqgently A trader. Thse learned Corsdr. ox said that dispokedl of the present petition, as the insolvent's debts exceeded 300h Petition dismissed.
POLIMCE...-n - 1$ANSION-ROUSE.-Edward Horace Montefiore, who was charged with forging to the amount of 5,3001., and.with having committed frauds, was again brought before the. Lon M"AYOR for examination. Mr. Ribton, instructed by. Mr. Roy, solicitor to the LBodon and Westminster Bank, attended for the proa6cation, and, Mr. Lewis for the defenco. lhr. Ribton said he sbould be able to prove that a lettet bad, been received from the prisoner, dated May, 1855, in the name of Langfelt, when he was im treaty for the ?urchaie of a schooner for the sum of 6001. He was then traced to London, In reference to the document signed' "Silvery" the learned counsel would be able to prove that to he in the prisoner's handwriting. The prisoner was then traded from loudon to Leith, and the captain of thehip in which he sailed, as well as the waiter at an hotel* in Bdinburgh, would prove that in Julv of the same year he was passing by the name of Lyon. He afterwards pased by the nar4e of Monteflore. This was the whole 9f the evidence in addition to that already adduced in respect to the first chazge. The bills which bad been proved to be forgeries were written in London, although uttered at the Cape of Ge d Hope, and therefore there could be no doubt as to the tiuriadction of the Lord Mayor in the case. The bank aet tgeCape bad ben cdefrauded by the prisoner, by means of hredittrs f redt,of 8001. Withreference to the second case, the prisoner hadnbeen proved, if Zot absolutelv '.o hlve pres4inted the letters of credit, yet to havemsade suc allus9ion to them in the presence-of one of the direc'ors of the hank as to have identified himself wiith them. The document signed " Silvery" pointed especially to this case. On the 5th or 6th of June the prisoner went to the London asdrwestminster Bank and applied for a letter of credit for 10 He filled up the usual form, paid the 101., and obtained the letter of credit. This was a forgery of a name, and he (Mr. Ribton) submitted that it was evidence for a jury whether, when the scheme was commenced in Lon. donJ they were not satisfied that the documents were forgedinLondon? Thelearnedcounselsaid he hadathird ch e to mnake against the prisoner of havig defrauded M~~~s. Guthofrondn,of 811. When the prs. sonc,t reached Cape Town he was received by the Erst oflies thereo gaccournatndof his negotiating the forged letters of cedit He avegrand dinner patAies, and issued cainis of ititation, writh a coat of arms on them, and was there consdere on of he ost celebrated and illustrious peraonsin the tovn. Ln fact, for the purpose of carryingout his schmeshe ad orgd the name of Baring, Brothers as weill asthoseof the directors of theLondonand WestminsterBank, to various documents. Under all these circumstancez, the learned counsel sabmitted that the fact of jurisdiction was clea$ly made out. Mr. H. James of the fsm of Bower and James, Ehipbrokers at Bristol, said,-I knew the prisoner from April to theo nd ofMasy, 1855.He }was then passing by the name of Langfelt. I negotiated for the sale of a schooner for him. The etter and receipt produced, signed " W. Langfelt," are in his -handwriting. In my opmion, the letter signed Sve' a iso in his handwotipng. The witness added thatc ebelieved all the letters shown to him it the counsel for tpe prosecution were Als in thc pisonsr's handwritng. Ja4nes Henry Ferguson, captain-of the ahi Leith, said,Ie recoll-ect the prisoner perfectly. --sawihinr on board the Lt,it4~ on a passage between London and *Edinburgyh,- about the middle Of JUne, 185D.

The signature to one of the letters produced is some. tlung hikomy signature. It is a sort of imitation. A¶. ong argument theo took place between Mr. Ribton and Mr. Lewis, the former contending that quite enough evidence had been saduced to show that the prisoner on itnot only to-be committed, but to be convicted, and the latter -insisti; -that there was not the shadow of a case within his IThe Lo YO o aid, he considered the case to be one of such oDmmercial importance as required to be treted with tnuch more than ordinary attention and care. It was evident that an atrocious system of forgery and fraud had been acted upon, and that it had been camrred out with the most datngerous ingenuity. 'Under-such circumstances, be should deem it to be his duty to take till Thursday to decide upon the course he should pursue as to the committal or discharge of the prisoner. The case waslf, a ater av occupied more than three hours and whalf, adourned till' Thursday. The LonD MAYOR requested that the press would acknowledge his receint of 211I. from the Drapers' Company; *10s. from the Clothworkera' Company; and l0s .from J. Ferkins, for the poor-box. GUnDnij.-William Matthews, who was stated to be a returned transport, was placed atbthe bar on remand, charged with the followin aing robbery - appeared that WMiiam Vickers, a lame youg man, o dwitthe aistance of a-erutch, was accosted y the peisoner and another manl early. in the evening, who wantqd to know the way to the Strand. Afterbeing direct,ea by the prosecutor, the prisoner- repeatedly renewed the same inquiry, until at length witness felt atug at his popkel, and immediately afterwards taw his wAtch in the ,pris ers hand. A severe struggle ensued, during which the prosecutor was thrown down, and the prisoner and his acconlplice 3made their escape.

To compel the wretched animal to drag the cab the defendant beat it'most severely with a whip, the end off which was formed into a knot, in which was plaed a shaA, nail, so that blood wa drawn at every blow inflicted. With this instrament of torture the defendant flogged the horse across the back and under the flanks, frim which blood was flowing pro. fusely. The MAGISTRATF7 after commenting 'teverely on the cruelty of the defendant's conduct, finedhim 40s., or two months' imprisonment. Notbeing able to pay the flue, the defend nt was lochoed up, and subsequentlg, on his agreeing to have the horse slaughtered (1thich Was done in the Dresence of the society's constable), the magistrate mitigatea the imprisonment to one month, but made no alteration in the amoant of fine.

The Baltic had arrived at New York. Owing to the 25th being Christmas-day no com'nercial business was tranacted at New York. A law substituting confnement to the ships of free coleured seamen, instead of imprisonment, had passed both Houses of the South Carolina Legislature. At New York on the evening of the 26th stocks were firm, but quiet. Money active and firm. Sterling exchange dull and nominal. Cotton stiffer and iiair demand. Freighteirregular. Flour was easier. Wheat steady. Corn easier. Pork, beef, and lard better. Bacon finn. Hams heavy, and butter difd. Iron steady. Tobacco firm. At Now Orleans, onx the 24th, cotton was unchanged.

LAW REPORT. VICE CBANCEILOR KINDERSLEY'S CRAMBERS, JAN. 10. -TH TIM ATER OF THE ROYAL BlRUIY ZANX. A meeting was held in this matter for the purpose of snaking a call. Upon reading the affidavit of the offficial manager it ap. pesred that the debts of the company were 554,OOO., and that the assets were compated to realize 280,00W., with a doubtful item of 40,000. in respect of the Cefa Iron Works in South Wales, but it was expected that ad. vantage would be taken of the bankraptcy to cause a forf eiture of the lease of these works, and therefore no value could hb put upor this item. The offidal manager pro. posed to make a call of 75g. per share upon the shareholders already settled upoa the list, and representing 1,507 shares, which call it was estimated would produce *bout l0O,003. Mr. RlED attended for several shareholders, and objected to the call being made for so large an amount as 75. per share, as he understood that the assignees were insidting upon the payment by the shareholders of a call of 501. per ghare alleged to have been made by the directors three days before the bank was dissolved. Mr. BUsToN, solicitor for the official manager, stated that the call referred to by mr. Reed was being disputed by the sbareholders, and that the offlcial manager was advised that only a small sum would be realised under it. Mer. Burton called attention also to the fact that in the re,cent argunment before the Lords Justices a strong opinion was expressed by Lord Justice Knight Bruce that the call -was void. For these reasons the official manager had not thought it right to make any considerable allowance on account of this calL Several other shareholders having addressed the Chief Clerk upon the same subject a call of 751. per share was mnade.
1XOOZ A2' T'HE HALL-MrARK IF.I 0X2:. IS ON-P. * TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have read the sensible letter signed " One of the Trade," and perfectly agreo in thinking that something ought to be done to prevent the imposition praotised on the public by, I fear, rnany je welers. The pther uight at the shop of£one of the greatest, and, Ibe lieve, most honest of them, I asked to seesome gold bracelets, and observing some small figures written on the ticket (undorneath the pice) of two inquired the reason, and lhy the said two were so much dearer in proportion than any of the others. The shopmau immediately replied, " Oh! those, Sir, are of 15 carat gold, the rest are onDly 16." Upor my expressing rny asionishment, and telling him I had always been iWrormed by first-class jewellers that they never sold anything of less than 18 carats, he only smiled, and said, " They may say so, Sir, and I only hope it is trme." Nfow, surely there should be a hall-mark (as in France) on all gold of a certain alloy above a fixed but small valae, and this -would in some measure prevent the public buying per. petuaDy in the dark articles in gold of five dilierenb standards, and frorD ever being at the mercy of the tradesman's word, who has most likely only tbatmorring received the orticle he is selling from av working man in aremote street, who has furnished both the labour and material.

ACCIDENT ON CORNHILr. TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES. Sir,-Will you be good enough to insert the foliowin, informationi with xegard to the scaffolding where this accident occurred? The Conaisasioners of City Sewers license the erection of scaffolds, subject to regulations which hai'e beea framcd with the express view of guardino the public frora injury, and giving it as much convenience as the circujstances of the case will admit of, the interest or convenience of those erecting scaffolds for their building being made quite secondary, even if it is considered at alL Thce esaffola in question haas been erected as it now exists ainder the~ supervision of the inspector of pavements for that district, so as to give the public protection and accommodation; the altomative mode would have been that (which is unnavoidable in narrow streets) of closing the scaffold below, and placing outside it a wooden platform for the public to pats over. The building works of Messrs. Sarl are very extensive. Probably, for the next three or four months, not one hour of the day will pass -without carts standing in front of the scaffold, unloading material of every description, size, and woight. By the present scaffold all this material will be placed uapon the building site without the public being stopped or annoyed; by the alternative mode of structure whole files of pedestrians would be cooped up in a narrow gangway close under the edge of the scaffold, waiting until some bulky material has been delivered or a body of labourers have moved off, or if impatient they would escape and nanceuvre their way across the road or round the carts at the imminent risk of injury amid a large and quick carriagotraflic. I do not see therefore that tbe public safety would be iacreased by stopping up the passageway beneath the soaffold, but I must remark that there is alrwys some chance of accident near scaffolds, and especially at the edges of them, and persons should not be encouraged to loiter beneath tbem; keeping open therefore an attractive shop is anisivitationto danger, andismostobjectionable. Ialso beg to inform you that the, cause of the accident, as it has been explained to me, isattributable to one of those incautious acts from which it:appears impossible to restrain workmen, and the poor fellow who thus acted is one of the sufferers; the other was standing beneath the edge of the scaffold over which the Atone thab feil rolled; and had the scaffold been constructed itkh i platform on the ontside the stono woald have fallen inoVtepassengers who might have been passing. I relain, Sir. Yowr be1dient WIL[aAl HAY'WOOD. 1i13giiiepr tote CommiEsion. £ngine,er =d Suzvoioes Offive, GuildhaU, Jan, 10.

PR.ESCOT,S PlztLip II.* - As the Americanpeople have jpontea t'hirworcs| to Spanish possessionS2 thie Amerian authors have directed their pens to Spanish history-Wasbin<,*o Irving hia delicate crowqul, Ticknor his roigh and ready steel pen, Prescott his brillisst gold. one. We ought to state the truth, however} maore broadly, for this tendency is not peculiar to the American author; it is derived from is English ancestor. The fact is, that as Spain is the eontinental Power with 'Which England has from generation to generation been on terms of the closest amity, and as with Spain the hes in a maner almost divided the Noew World, so, of al foreign themes, writers in the Rnglish language have taken the greatest interest in the events of Spauish history. There is not a I eountry out of England that has attracted so miuch of our attention as Spain-its life, legends, and language-its ballads and bullfights -its pictures, palaces, and posadas-its Gypsies, guerillas, and d-on. How many of our ablest writers have been enticed to that magnifficent emlp ire of adventure and poetry, of proud kings and gorgeous pageants, on which the sun was first sid never to set, and of which the rivers were said to run gold and diamonds I How brightly and intimately does its marvellous history-the wars of Moor and Christian, the glories of the AlTambra, the Cid and all his bravery, Don Quixote and all his errantry, Gil 131as and all his devilry, t}he story of Columbus, the story of Loyola, tortures of the Eloly Inquisition, and merrymakings of the ligghthearted Zingari,~-mingle with aUl our boyish dreams and memories, as probably it never will ag-ain with those of another generation of English readers ! The Spaniard has rather sunk in our esteem. Dramatists borrow their plots from French instead of Castilian plays; of Andalusian genets and the blades of Toledo we hear no more; Spanish Armadas, Spanish galleons, Spanish proverbs, Spanish dollars, are out of date. ThLe dollar, that was once as well known throughout the world as the English sovereign is now, is every year becoming of less account, and soon will vanish as completely as shekels of silver and talents of gold. But the history which tb% English are beginning to forget our American k' en are studying more wistfully than ever, and it would seem that for reasons beyond that which inherently belongs to S pain itself, its history, its literature, and its art, are Rely to occupy much of their regard. Of those Transatlantic 5 -iters who have turned their attention this way, William Eickling Prescott is entitled to the foremost place, as indeed he is the ablest of all American historians. He resembles Mr. Macaulay in that fondness for picturesque details, pointed anecdote, and biograp*ic threads of interest which give to the histories of both such vividness of outline and warmth of interest. But, while fond of dwelling on the same particulars, the two historians are widely different in their modes of working these up into a connected story, aud we need scarcely say that Mr. Prescott has no chance beside his English contemporary. There is a want of cohesion in his narrative, wrhich is all the more apparent after reading Mr. Macaulay's, where one paragraph necessitates the next; an anecdote is broug,ht in allusively to strengthen the advancing argument; a picture is hurriedly dashed in for a background to heighten the interest of the thickening plot, and al the chapters hold together like the arches of a mighty bridge. Mr. Macaulay's narrative, in short, exhibits the sequence of cause and effect in the events which he relates; Mr. Prescott is more content with a purely chronological sequence of day succeeding day, and in this way his history partakes a little of the irregular andi digressive character of the ancient chronicles, while at the same time it is not less graphie in its descriptions than they are, not less personal in its interest, far less garrulous in its relations, and far more finished in style. In the Reign of Pl&d4p II. Mr. Prescott has found a theme different from any which he has yet handled. The History of Fiedi?muad and Isabela, his earliest work, reads like a romance-like one of those tales of the golden prime of Haroun - al Racehid, its marvellous discoveries, and tunparaUeled, although peaceful, adventures. The Con6uest of Mexico and of Pcn, on the other hand, is no such tale of civic triumphs and intestine broils, the pomp of kings, and the enterprise of subjects-it is war and rapine, consecrated massacre and piratical solemnities, the bravely of 0gods, and the cruelty of demons. Rarely have historians had the goodfortane to obtainsuelithemes,andnotoftenhave noble themes been treated with so much power. In the reign of Philip II. Mr. Prescott has found a mnore ordinary, but per-haps on that very account a more difficult, subject. It is more ordinary, inasmuch as the familiar brawls of European States are not to be compared with the discovery and subjugation of a new hemisphere-an event that happens once for all in the duration of the world. But the history of a reign, which is in effect the history of Europe, and that too at a time when our modem life was beginning to put forth its strength, and the brilliant shows of chivalry had not yet passed away, must always have an epic grandeur about it. By blood or marriage, Philip was related to almost every crowned head in Europe. The son of an Emperor, he was himself King of Spain, King of Naples, King of Sicily, Duke of Milan, Duke of both the Burgandies and Count of Flanders. Married four times, his first wife was a Portuguese infauta-his cousin; his second, an English queen-his cousin; his third, a daughter of France; and his fourth, an Austrian arehduehess-his cousin, like the first two. The contest was not yet decided between Rome and the Reformation. The chureh, that had bitherto been united, was not content that her seamless robe should be rent in twain and a grand effort was to be made either t; winback or to annihilate the schismaties. sa true son of the chureh, and as the most powerful and fanatical asserter of its claims, Philip had spiritual abettors in every country of Europe and hearts that pgayed to Heaven for iis Most datholic Mjesty. Thus at once the most widely and powerfully connected of existing Sovereigns, Prince of the foremost peoples of Europ, in command of an amy the most formidable in the world, of a navy the mistress of the sea, and of an exchequer that drew without limit from the mines of Zacatecas and Potosi, Philip was, in truth, the Grand hlonarque of histime. And the time was one that affords great opporbunities to the historian, from the magnitude of the issues at stake and from the splendour of the customs in vogue. The philosophic historian could scarcely pitch upon a fner topic than the contest which decided the fate of the Reformation in the 16th eitury, and which, after a bloody struggle- that called forth the energies of Alva and Don John of Austria on the one side, and Egmont and the Prince of Orange on the othei ended in the civil and religious liberty of the i;etherlands. The desecriptive historian could scacelv hit upon a period more alluring to his pencil than that which produced the greatest masters of colouring that the world has seen-Titian, Veronese, and Correggio. Just then the wealth of a new world had been poured upon Europe bounteously as suanneasna, and realized the fading dreams of the alchymist by transmuting all it touched into gold. The mules wfhich bore the Duke of Medina Sidonia to meet the firat bride of Philip were shod with gold ; and the Duke of Albuquerq'ue, -w-ho -d`ied ab"o'it' a century afterwards, had a sideboard that was mounted by 40 silver ladders, aad whlen he died six weeks were occupied in making out the inventory of his gold and silver vessel. No doubt, this was chiefly ostentation, and with less show Europe is far more wealthy now. We do not dispute the point; we only say that the osthutation was Dicturesque. By a few bills of exchange a million of money can at the present day be far more easily transmitted from one European capital to another than by carting bullion to the Tower of London, as Philip did, in waggons drawn by a hundred horses; but twrenty bills of exchange are not so brilliant to theeye as twenty carts of gold. 'When our Queen makes a progress the Mayors of e'very town present her with an address. T.hese towns contribute more to her revenues than tie continental cities to the reveniues of Pilipip; but it is not so leasanit to listen to their addresses as it would Eave been to see the magistrates.of old come forth with.silver goblets, filled withgolden ducats; to present tothe Sovereign. These aire the usages that give scope to. the narrator - who has an teve -for colour, and. wldi 'w needsarcely add -that MI' Prscott ha1iur nedteOthe bcst==ount. A CA'. miderable portion of Philip's reign neces5&:e1y coincides with the life of his father, thee Emperor Obhrles V., who was ending his career in the momitic seclusion of St. Yuste, and both in tb.~s volumes, acd by way of supplement to a reia-sue of Roberton7s Hi-storj of CMare 'F, Mr, preecott has given a brilliant sketch oi that r ,alm ble map, and a minute account of his lattfr days. Although his description of the Emparoi?s retirement is based on original researches, it has very narrowly misted the merit of noveltv-the principal facts re Ia' t to "the cloister life of Charles p." having but lately been laid before the public for the first time by Mr. Stirling. But, if he has been thus behindhand in point of time, his narrative is anything but deficient in point of interest. Living inmonasti~,xeclnuion, the Emperor could not altogether lead the life of a recluse. He xight resign the honours, but he could not resign the cares of empire; and this wm but aspecimen of the strange contradiction of his life and character. The truth is, there was anAness in Charles's family. His mother died insane. On no plea save that of an hereditary craze can the ferocious bigotry of his son Philip be excused; his gradson, the celebrated Don Carios, died in confinement; Charles himself was subject to melancholy. Manhood came late to him, and old age came early; he was inbearded at 20, and he was gray at 36. "At 40," says 3fr. Prescott, " The gout had made serious inroads on a constitution originaly strong, and before he was 50 the nan'who coula keep the saddle day and night in his campaigns, who seesued to be insensible to fatigue as he foUlwed the chaso among the wild passes of tho Alpuxarras was obliged to be carried on a litter, like a poor cripple, at the head of his armies." These physical incongruities, however, were bat a type of the sinaularities of his character which he bequeathed to his descendants. He was brave, and yet he was not chivalrous; he combined the valour of a Red Cross knight with the treachery of a Redfoot ehief. Plain in his own dress, he loved display around him; and, splendid in all his expectations, he combined splendour with avarice. Although a zealot in religion,he warred against the Pope; and when he had taken the Pope prisoner, and sacked Rlome, he finished by going into mourning for the victory. In like manner, it was while in aU the vigour of youth, crossing and recrossing Europe and the seas with the swfftness of a shuttle, that he conceived the extraordinary idea of abdicating his power, and descending, like Diocletian, from the throne of. the 'world to the empire of a cabbage garden. He fulfilled his design with the same eccentricity. To a Jeronymnite convent of the strictest order he carried the saplendous and luxuries of a court. Above all, he carried with him to this penitential retreat the luxuries of a Rloyal kitchen, antd, while he was scourging himnself with cords till he drew blood, he was gorging himself with frog's legs and anchovies, eel pasties and 1stremadura sausages, till he grew sick, and, complaining that the dishes of the cook were not savoury enough, drew from the perplexed functionary the celebrated witticism that "he did not know what h3 could do, unless to serve His Majesty a ragout of watches." In his passion for clocklmaking he exhibited another strange contradiction. He had a nmnber of clocks and watches ticking together in his apartments, and, finding it difficult to make any two of them keep the same time, he is said to have exclaimed on the folly of attempting to bring a numiber of men to think alike on religious matters, when he wuld not regulate a couple of timepieces so as to make them perfectly agree. Yet he who could think so truly pressed on his son Philip with his dying breath the duty of cherishing the Inquisition and bringing every heretic to justice without favour and withoutmercy. " So shall you have my blessing, and the Lord shall prosper all your undertakings." His dying was as eccentric as his life. All along, in his retirement, he had shown a tendency to dally with the horrors of the sepulchre. A funeral was hiz ielight, and never a monk in the district died but Charles was his undertaker. At last he got his own coffin ready, performed his own funeral, and was his own chief mourner. It is necessary to bear in mind these extravagancies in order fully to explain and partly to justify the excesses of his son; while at the same time we remember, to the hon,our of Charles, that, although he was the most singular being of his time, he was also the most free from local peculiarities, and had a wider range of sympathies than any man then living. His tastes were all Flemish; his zeal was all Spanish; he had the bravery and the bulldog lips of his Burgundian ancestors; he had the blue and penetrating eye of Teutonic origin; and without constraint he could accommodate himself to the manners of every nation in Europe. The worst which can be said of Philip is that he was an utter Spaniard, little pleasing to the Italians, positively displeasing to the Flemings, and hateful to the Germaus. Thereis something amusing in the gusto with which Pope Paul IV. denounced the Spaniards of that period, the principal defenders of the church, as the scumn of the earth, the spawn of Jews and Moors, a race accursed of God and man; and in regarding the atrocities of which Philip was the author charity requires that we should take into account both his birth and his breeding. lr. Prescott is too lenient to this infatuatedPrince ; but it is possible for the historian to be too severe, and those who would view the character of Philip in all its darkness must read the brilliant volumes which have lately been published on the Rise of the Dutch Republic by Mr. Motley. Here is another American, a friend of Mr. Prescott, who applies his energies to the same subjects, and produces a history which is in every way creditable to his powers. But how different are the results in the pictures preseted of the same individual ! Mr. Motley is a historian of the passionate school, who hates wrong and would blast the wrongdoer. Mr. Prescott is a historian of the picturesque school, who sees Philip as an actor in a stately tragedy, and who lays greater stress on the exigencies of dramatic plot than on the obligations of moral law. Perhaps it is more just to take this latter view ; at all events, it is but fair to consider circumstances of time and place; and in saying that Philip was a Spaniard, that he associated only with Spaniards, spoke only Spanish, wore the Spanish dress, and adopted a policy which might be a very pretty chateau em Espagne, but was intolerable as a programme for Europe, we afford au* explanation, if not an excuse, for his conduct. So far from being an excuse, what can be more condemnatory than to announce that the most potent prince of that age, lord of the broadest empire in the world, ruler of the most diverse and most advancedraces of Europe, spokebu' a solitary languase, hugged himself in provincial habits, enjoyed the society only of provincials like himself, and was a foreier in the most civiized portion of his own dominions? Nothing can more clearly show the mllness of his nature, and it would be curious to point out how, as he sojourned in England and passed over the Continent, his father, his aunt, his wife and his other advisers were continuallypressing Lim to throw off his Spanish reserve, and mingle mnore freely 'with the native nlobles. All to no purpose, for his mind was narrow beyond cure. A silent, thin, little muan, addicted to pastry and troubled with cholic, atoning for a scandalous devotion to the sez by a fanatical devotion to the church -s rtLthat fie ne'vercodseedt dance-so tyrnnical that he ordered from his presence a lady 'who mled when he blew his nose-so inhliman that he neverlaughed but once in his life, and that was whenhe received the news of the mausacre of St. Bartholomew,-we coneiivehiMl, with his fair hiair blue eyes, and protruding jaws, ai-oneof those meen whom 'we so imes meset with, to whom crotchets seem to be natural, and who are buried mpetty prendice and pride as a porcupine in quills. c (To be continued.)

Sir,-As a man of Kent I rejoice greatly at the rzadinee with. which you opened your colimnns to perpetuste the bravery of the Broadstairs boatmen who Eo nobly riskod their lives to save those of the perishing crew of the Northern Belle. They are noble fellows and deserve not only ongr raises but our active holp ; but let us not forget {ha:t w i eGod preserved their lives there perished on the -same spot nine of their fellow brave men theluger Victory, of Margate, which was struck by X huge sea while on the same nobl'i missiorn of rescue, and sank to rise no more. AR1 ithese poor fellows were drowned, and does not their bravery and sad fate call loudly for oar hel to their bereaved widows and children? Most of them £ave left both. I do hope, Sir, the bonour we do the livi4g will not be refused the dead ia the persons of their now destitute wives and families. A. local subscription, doubtless, is alresdz opened, and should you, Sir, as I sincerely trust youwli <1, publish this letter, I have no doubt Miessrs.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE T13MS. Sir,-I should be sorry indeed to check the laudable sympathy which is being displayed an all sides towards those braeo fellows who succeeded in saving the crew of the American ship Northern Belle, now a wreck on the Ness Rock;near Margate. But, Sir, I fear without your kidn assistince the most melancholy part of the affair will be entirely overlooked. The Victory lu ger, belonging to Margate, 'vith a crew of nine men, on the first a pearance of dangertotheinl fated ship put to sea, regar ess alike of the bonlon surf as of their own lives and property, on their mission of mercy when, on neaing the object of their perilous attempt, and in signt of hundreds of persons on the ctiff, she was struck by a tremendous sea, and every soul peTished. Now, Sir, these poor men have all left wives and families entirely unprovided for. I trust I naeed not say more to place them side bv side in the public sympathies with their noble compeer of tho Broadstairs lifeboats. The Victory, a 'well-knownL beat to inasny Ilargate visitors, was worth from 3001. to 4001., Encloeed is a list of the names of the crew as forwarded to mne to-day --Isaac Solly, aged 46 ; J'ohn Smith, aged 63; George Smithi, aged 29 (father and son) - Williasui Emptage, sen., aged 52; Sohn Emptage, aged 2N (father and son);- Charles Fuller, aged 34; flenry Paramer, agedi 27; rrederick Batt, aged ~2; A braham I usbridge, aged W5. I have no doubt that fessrs. Cobb and Co., the Margate bankers, would gladly receive subscriptions in aid of these poor men's widows and orphans.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-1 begZyou to allow m, through your great paper, to acknowledge publicly ny thankfulness for the rescue of myeelf and my crew zrom the ill-fated Northerm Belle. The sp and the cargo under my charge are the property of others, and, at the expense of my better feelings, it is for them first I have been anxious, audit is my duty to do all I can. This feeling, which also actuated me to stick by my unfortunate ship to the last, and until al hope of doing any good 'vas gone, has kept re haok from sooner expressing that gratitude which has never for one moment escaped my mind, and it mnst not be inferred from my silence that I am not mindful of the great and noble services which have been rendered to me in the distressing situation in which I was placed. No onecan more completely appreciate-and I ua sureno one can more admire-the noble bravery and the hggh huamanity of those men who came out in that terrific gale to rescue me and my crew from a watery grave at the tremendous risk of that fate to themselves. I am, and wo all sre, most thankful to them, and it was with heartfelt xstisfaction I heard immediately from my agents, Messrs. Windsor, Brothers, that they would take all care in their power ihat they should nkot go umnrewarded, so far as this world's good feeling towards such eonduct as theirs could he stranedL I rejoice to see that other kind persons, as dso our consul, have taken their cause in hand; and I feel quite sure, from the kindness and sympathy I have myself received at all bands, that these brave men will not be neglected in this country, az I know they will not be in my own, America. I have requested my agents (Messrs. Windsor, Brothers, 115, Leadenhall-street) to place 201& for me to the fund which they hope to raise. I trust you will assist to call attentiQu to it, and I would ask every one who can spare a mite to add it for the benefit of those menwho, under God's blessing and nlder such perilons and trying circumstances, bave saved the lives of the captain and crew of the Northern Me]e.

K}G LOUIs AtPP'S M scRM The affair relative to the autograph manusscript of the late King Louis Philippe, entitled Coninuatijon de l'Histcirc fThijaIog,que CZ O2ironolog-uc de laAyifson Aoyaie de Francc, &e Aaire, &c., which ex:ited so much attention last summer, caame on Again yesterday before the Civil TribunaL It may be remembered thiat the late Kinoe whenDuked`Oz e*teanpied his leisure hours in writing the oon.inuation of the history ir queston, which, having been comnienced by a monk Damed Father Anselnie, was only brought down to some yearTspreceding thegreat revolution. After his auceson to the throne the King had little or no timse to devote to the continuation of the work, hut he c-kefuiiy i3reserved the msnuscript which he had prepared, an lied it bound into three volumes. In the revolation of February, 1848, the volumes disappeared from the Palace of the Tnileries, aud nothing vris neard of them until last usumruer, 'when aperson named Valiette offered on certain conditions three voluMes of the Kinesmanuscripts to the Royal family of Orleans. He was called on to produce one of the volanes, and to sayhow they came into bispossession, buthe refusedto do either. On tbe 7th of Augutt, on the application of all the sons, grand. children, sons-in-law, and daughters-in-law of the late ing, Authority to seimz the volumes was granted by the President of tho Civil Tribunal. The seiz-ure was effected on the 9th in the residence of Vallette. On the 21st, on the application of the advocate of the Orleans family, the volames which were in the custody of an officer of the Tribunal, were ordered to be given up to them. To this application at the moment X Vallette made no opposition, but he subsequently put in an opposition, and it was to obtain a decison thereon that te moiatter came yesterday before the Civil Tribunal. Xf. Scribe, Advocate of the Orleans family, after detailing tho preceding circumstauces, contended t1at the manuscripts must be gdven ip, for 4hree reasons :.-First, they were the undoubted property of the late King, the first two volumes, hsving been entirely written by himn- and the third, though transcribed by ont Sta..as de Girardin, a friend of his, was corrected by hima, and bad always been kept by His r.jesty, with the two others, under lock and key; also, that the volumes must havebeen taken in the pillage of the Ttuileries, and, consequently, without the Kings consent. Sec3nmy, the manuscripts had not come inte the hands of AL Vallette by honest purchase. It was tre that thatiperson pretended that he was a colector of manuscripts, and that he had purchased those in question at the site by auction of the effects of the late Dr. Blanc de Varsnnes; but it was impossible to believe that the lot of old papers bought by him on that occasion,for wbich he bad onlygiven 9f. WOC., could have comprised the manuscripts of the King, which hoehimIelf estimated to be worth 6,000f. Another circumstance which proved that the manuscripts were not honestly his property was that he had given oontradictory accounts with respect to the nanner in which he had become possessed of thern; thus, not content with saying that he had purchased them, be alleged that he had collected them sheet by sheet; but, supposing tho voltumes had been torn to pieces and dispersed, was It likely that he could have found every sheet without the omission of a single one? That version, therefore, was false, and, as it was in contraditl on with tho other, it led to the sapposition thst the other was false also. IL S6nard, the advocate of 3t. Vallette, after complining of the mnanner in which t'he Orleans faunily had acted towards that gentleman when he hd off erdto ede the manuscripts to them for a reasonable sum, said that the volumes which had been stolen froma the Tuileries were fair copies of rough notes which had been made by the King; but it was not these volumes, but the note, full of erasures, irterlneations, and corrections, which AL Valette posseszed, and which, after two years' arranging and classifying, he had formed into three volumes. NowT; M. Vatoet, one of the intimate friends of the late King, was a friend of the late Dr. Blanc de Varenncs, and was it improbable that the notes had been given to hinm to copy. or have copied, and that he had afterwards let his friend take them as things of no use? Il. Vallette's account, therefore, of having purehased them at the sale of the effects of Dr. Blanc de Varennese was treo. At this point of the pleadings the President, stopping the advocate, stated that the manuscripts sealed up in a port folio were lying on the table, and that it would perhaps be desirable to break the seals in order to have them examtned AL Senard remarked that the seals had been ptut on at the request of his client, and that he saw no obiec. ffon to having the manuscripts examinedt The judges then retired, accompanied by the advocAtes of the fes, to exaLmine the papers On their return AL nar resumitg his pleading, contended that the result of the examination must satis3y the tribanal that the papers were what he had represented, rough notes, not the volumes e Orleans famly suppoSedp and that M. VaUette's account of the nianner in which they had come Into hi: posession was undoubtedly correct. Ho then stated that 2L. VaUetto was and bad been for many years an employc of the Ministry of the Interior, that he was highly ceteenied by his colleagues and superiors, aud that he had never made any mystery as to his possession of tbe masmuacrits or as to the way in which be had got them. He therekore contentde that the Orleans faamily had no legal or moral right to claim the manuscripts. The trihunaI postponed the case for a week- to hear tho reply of the Orleans party and to give iudgment.-Gaiqtani',s Jlessenger. DEATH OT om.R PELHAM, TRE SoTarort.-On Saturday morning, at 6 o'clock, Mr. labez Pelham, solicitor, died at his residence in Arbour-alqure, Stepney. The dec'erd gentleman was in his 56tMh ear and praeised at the various police-courts for a period of 27 year, though in the early period of his professional cateer he atthnded to the comnIon lAw practice in the cortis at West. uinster only. His extensive knowledge of malrtime law, and his superior talent as an Advocate, cusedhim tobe retained in almost every shipping and mercantilemcae of inporta.ce at the Whitechaper and Bow County Couarts, the haumes Police-court, and the Mansionbhonse. He was consulted by the Lords of the Admiralty and their solicitor in 1860, when the Iercantile rtine Act was introduetd, and ke framed the p cucpal discipline c?ause6, which were subsequently embodied in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854. The late Mr. Pel?an was a?so e for a period of 25 years in criminal proseoutions and the defence of prisoners at the Central Criminal Court, the Clerkenwell Swaesons, and the assies. Mr. Pelham conducted the defence of the notorious Noah Pease Foulger, master mariner, who shot Irr. Mellish, the eminent contractor, on the Royal Exchange, and the defence of Oxford who shot at the Queen. It will be recollected that in olh cases plca of inunity was established. Mr. Pelhata was much respected bythbe profession andbythe judges and magistates3before whom he so frequently appeare&.u.
