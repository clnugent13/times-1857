Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MONEY-MABKBTa7W O_ITYIyTvLLIGENEB.
Wednesday Evening.
There has again been considerable agitation in the Stock Exchange to-day, and in consequence of a severe renewal of the demand for money prices have touched a low point, although there was a partial recovery before the termination of business. The first transactions in Consols were at the closing quotation of last evening, 921 to s for money, but a fal soon took place to 92 , and subsequently, under the influence of a large sale of Reduced for delivery, they touched 924, the demand for loaus meanwhile being urgent at from 6J to 7 per cent. Some capital, however, was drawn into the market by these terms. A purchase of Consols also laving been made for the account the tone became less unsteady, and there was a return to 924 to i, which was maiutained to the close, support being afforded by the fact of an almost unprecedented amount of Australiangold having been takento the Bank. For the 7th of May the last price was 93 to J. Not-
rithstandmg the partial rally in the afternoon thU
market up to the last moment was without any appearance of strength, the general pressure having led to an apprehension the Bank may tomorrow refuse to make advances on stock, even for the period of seven days, to which this accommodation is already restricted. There were some circumstances, however, to lead to the belief that the sudden augmentation of demand may prove only temporary. Heavy payments to be made to-morrow for recent silver purchases, and the faUing due to-day of more than a million sterling of railway debentmues, together with the occurrence of the half-monthly share settlement, serve to account for part of the requirements. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 215; Reduced, 911 to i; New Three per Cents., 914 to i; India Stock, 222 to 221; and Exchequer-bond;, 98i to -i; India-bonds and Exchequer-bils could not have beeu sold in any large quantities, except at a heavy decline, but the prices nominally were 8s. to 4s. discount for the former, and 3s. discount to is. premium for the March descriptions of the latter.
The expectation that the Bank return for the week ending S3aturday last will ag'ain be a very unfavourable one contributed to the prevailing weakness; and there were also continued attemptsto cteate an impression that the Indian Government will endeavour to raise a direct loan in the London market. This, however, ia wholly improbable, although perhaps the wants in that quarter may accelerate the granting of guarantees on such of the new railway projects as are favourably regarded by the India-house.
Foreign stocks were heavy, aud the transactions show a general decline. Brazilian Five per Cents. were at 1004; Danish Three per Cents., 80; Mexican, for account, 23i; Peruvian Three per Cents., 544, i; RussianFour-and-a-Half per Cents., 954; Sardinian, 904; Turkish Six per Cents., for account, 944, i, 4, %3 ; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 100I, 100; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65; and the Four per Cents., 974, 64, 7.
In the corn-market this morning there was a slight tendency to recovery.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. for money, and 70f. 25c. for the end of the month, showing an improvement of an eighth.
About 450,0001. out of the late gold arrivals from Australia was sold to the Bank to-day, making the total taken there during the present week 670,0001. This, however, still fals short of the amount necessary to repair the extraordinary drain of the past fortnight.
At the half-yearly meeting of the Agra and 'United Service Bank, held at Calcutta on the 14th of February, the profits for the six months were stated at 49,3601., which, after payment of a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum, leaves 11,8601. to be carried to the reserve fund, making the total of that fund 149,2501. The premises recently purchased for the agency at Canton have been burnt by the Chinese, but the books and documents were saved, anad the necessary steps have been taken to substantiate a claim for full indemnity. This bank is henceforth to be a London establishment, and the directors are to be the Lord Mayor, C. G. Manse], Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Macdonald, G. G. Macpherson, Major-General Sim, Colonel James Holland, W. Newmarch, A. Rimington, J. C. Palmer, J. S. Stopford, and Ideutenant-Colonel Doveton.
The Report of theNorth BritishAustralasian Company, to be submitted at the meeting on the 21st inst., shows a profit of 14,1921., chiefly derived from the sheep station of Rosenthal. The Kawau mines in New Zealand have been abandoned, and the expenditure closed after a total loss of 78,4731. The Bon Accord rmine in South Australia is to be made over to a new company. Vor the present a dividend is to be deferred to enable sufficient working capital to be retained. Proceedings are proposed for placing the company under limited liability.
An adjudication of bankruptcy has been made today against Colonel Waugh, one of the directors of the London and Eastern Bank. He is described as of Branksea Island, Dorset, and of Little Abingdonstreet, brick and tile manufacturer. MIr. Hughes, of Worcester, is the petitioning creditor, and Messrs. Linklaters and Hackwood are the solicitors in the case. The petition has been allotted to Mr. Commissioner Evans.
Tele,graphic advices from St. Petersburg state that the ice in the Neva broke up on the night of the 13th inst., and that the navigation at Cronstadt is likely to open in about 16 days. The weather was warm with heavy rain.
The Columbian steamer, belonging to the European and Australian Mail Packet Company, was spoken on the 16th of February, in latitude 330 09' S., and longitude 14Â° 30' E. (off the Cape of Good Hope), 33 days out from Southampton. She had, therefore, made good progress up to that date.
At a meeting of the Submarine Telegraph Conipany to-day it was resolved to dispose of the conicession for laying down telegraphic wires through Hanover to the North of Europe to an independent company, to be formed under the Hanoverian law, on condition of the caution money and preliminary expenses being repaid and certain conditions being' entered into regarding a future participation ia dividends.
The following letter relates to anew attempt likely to be made to obtain the introduction on the London market of those portions of the home debt of Peru which have long been celebrated for their questionable origin. The temptation to be offered is said to be an increase of 2 per cent. on the sinking fund of the English debt; but the precedent would be bad, and should be resisted. If the existing Peruvian Government notwithstanding their former determination to the contrary, choose now, for reasons known to themselves, to recognize these liabilities, they can do so, and pay the proper rate of interest upon them at home. The fact of their having them represented by sterling bonds shows that the object is to get rid of them here-a result which would operate on our market just as if the amount were raised by a new loan *.-
*Sir,-The last advicea from Lima state that General Castilla had signed a decree acknowledging the iniquitous increase of the intermal debt under Echenique, and the conversion of $11,000,000 of that debt into 2,200,0001. of sterliDg bonds.
"It was to oppose the introduction of these bonds, which the Government and agents of Pera had so treacherously converted, and were endeavouring to put on this market, to our great injury, and to take such other measures as might be deemed necessary, that a committee was appointed on the 11th of January, 1854, of which Mr. Richard Thornton is chairman. To the vigilance and strenuous exertious of that committee we owe the defeat of the various attempts first made with those internal bonds, as well as the increased sinking fund we have on our own,w and if the committee had been properly supported by us no doubt our legal right of five-eighths of the proceeds of guano sold in this kingdom (which by this time would have liquidated more than half the debt owing us) could have been obtained; and the payment of the interest and prrohases for the sinking fund, as also some minor points, placed on a more satisfactory footing than they now appear to be to the general body of the bondholders. But instead of giving those representatives the support they deserved, we suffered them to be insulted at a meeting notoriously packed by parties well known to have for their sole object the circulation of the intrusive bonds, and who, after the adjournment of that meeting constituted a committee of their number, which obtained the name of the ' New Committee.'
" Annoyed as the Old Committee must have been at oar culpable neglect in not supporting them against the machinations of a cabal opposed to our interests, they deserve much praise for not having thrown up our cause, and for resisting the two attempts which the New Committee made to obtain an official quotation of the obnoxious bonds. Nor among our obligations to them can be forgotten their opportune protest in our behalf against the acts of the New Comm#,tee, thus maintaining our right to five-eighth of the uano proceeds, which would otherwise have been lost taro -the suicidal resolution paasedl at a meeting held by tihneat Ne Committee, accepting the Present sinking fund as
"Our'actual position is most unsatisfactory, as well as dangerotm, No one can doubt that renewed efforts awilnow
be made to circulate the spurious bonds in this market, and | it is eserntial to our interests And to that of the BzitihlI
public that such attempts be opposed, no matter by whom made or however plausible the pretext or bait offered; for we need no new lessons in Spanish.Ameriean faith. Nor should we forget that ouLr present sinking fund has not yet received~ the sanction of any Peruvian Congress.
" Our old friends have evidently continued 'o watch over our interests; but I understand that, tired of thelunthank. ful task they accepted, as well sa of the expenditure of their timo and money, they have long wished to [resign, and it is not to be wondered at.
I" As we have no right to expect the Old Committee to persevere in our behalf after the treatment they have received it behoves us to lose no time in appoinoing men of efficiency, knowledge, and fidelity to enforce our legal rights and confront the imminent danger we are exposed to. An internal debt of ssme 27 or 28 millions of dollars, an external one of about 4.i millons of dollars, and our own debt of nearly 4,000,G001. sterling (no trifling total for a population of less than two millions, two-thirds Indians), a rostly naval force, without native seamen to man it, and of bat little utility, a staff of military officers sufficient for an army of 150,00 men, the chief industry of the country (mining) in decadence, an inlernecine warfare wasting its resources, and which, if now put down, may again soon spring up when there are so many greedy of the spoils of the State, and a rapid diminution of the deposits of gnano, -which are in the hands of an inaurgent force,-sacuh is a sketch of the actual psrtion of Pern, and let us old bondholders beware lest, beforg onr debt is extinguished, we learn that a few bare rocks alone remain to show where oUr principal, and probably only security wasD

Memoirs Of Sir Robert Peel.*
MRfZMOIRS OF SIR ROBERT PEEL.*
(Concluded from .T7e Times of April 14.)
The second memoir in this volume relates, as we
stated, to the Repeal of the Corn Laws in '45-6 I This measure has been very naturally looked upon as the principal test of Sir Robert Peel's statesman. sbip. It was at least a crucible in which his fame vwas tried, and a final ordeal of his strength and of his weakness. It is late in the day to discuss the corn Laws as a comprehensive measure of public policy. Their enactment may or may nothave been WHise. Their repeal was wise, just, and inevitable. Happily, the issue is no longer a vast auestion dividing a Legislature, convulsing a nation; it subsides here into narrower limits. It has become a tradition of national history that the Corn Laws were rightly and prudently repealed. It remains only a moral problem-were they rightly abrogated by Sir Robert Peel ?
This problem, nevertheless, is still of some importance. An entire and complete change in his convictions has here to be accounted for, not merely as in the cases of Catholic emancipation and the Reform Bill an acquiescence in the reversal of a policy of which he had been the mainstay. And more than a change in his convictions has to be justified, for there was a corresponding contradiction in his course of action and conduct. The opinions of an individual on questions of public economy may be fairly reversed by the wants of a growing society, and his acts may correspond, with. out impeacbment, provided he is free from counter obligations of his own acceptance or his own creation; in short, if he has not engaged away his liberty to others. But, apart from the right -which all possess originally, there is here the personal question-the case of conscience how far such a man, if he is encumbered by pledges to great parties or great interests-if he is more deeply and responsibly engaged than any other individual in the community to a particular course, may violate those pledges to do a public service, and may sacrifice personal engagements to an abstract sense of duty. We are to consider the proper conduct for such a man when the engagements themselves are of a public nature, when they practically involve large consequences; and we have to consider whether the necessity for their infringement was insuperable, whether the same object might not have been accomplished by other agencies; and even if -we can answer these questions satisfactorily we have to consider whether the conduct of the immolating -personage was, from first to last, unexceptionably ttraightforward, and whether his motives were uneciuivocally clear.
We are dealing with the apology of such a person, and therefore we are not answerable for thus narrowing the issue. On the personal question Peel himself invokes the judgment of posterity. His reputation is disquieted; it " walks" in the guise of these memoirs, and tears away its historic shroud in the ngitation of its unrest. A memorable change in the policy of a wvhole life has to be justified, and he lays primary stress on the failure of the potato crop ! Tlhis calamity, we may say, is forced into undue prominence. It is the foremost topic of his first sentenco, and its history occupies at the least 50 pages. Yet how does the potato rot dispose of a question to which,at the worst, its importance was but temporary? The issue is his permanent and final abolition of the Corn Laws, to maintain which he was pledged under every variety of circumstance, and his abolition of those laws, not as a matter of convenience, but as a principle on which his convictions had been entirely reversed. In 1846 he had discovered that bread protected by the Corn Laws was leavened &Iy injustice. In 1841, on the motion of want of confidence in the Whig Ministry, he had thrown in the testimony of his life to the contrary.
" I should like to know who has stood forward more than I have done in defence of the existing Corn Laws. I should like to know whether any man, looking at these debates, can really have a doubt that my desire is to maintain a just and adequate protection to the agricultural interest."
Here is not only a pledge, but a protest against auspicion, made to the country and the party of which he was the leader, and this pledge was made shortly previous to the elections of 1841,-the elections which constituted the Parliament in which he renounced Protection for ever. For his answer to the considerations raised by such equivocal conduct, even as to his personal rectitude, we have now this apology.
In the first place the potato rot, quantum valeat, is, as we said, pushed into prominence, and more material circumstances are kept in the background. Peel had not pledged himself as to details, though he had pledged himself to Protection generally as a principle, and he had modified the conditions oE Protection by his Corn Bill of '42. But to Protection he still unequivocally adhered, though he declined to give any guarantee as to its anountt. :3etween, however, the passing of the Corn Bill in 1842 and the close of the session of 1845 "the opinions he had previously entertained on the subject of protection to agriculture had undergone a great change." Of this Lyreat change, continuously developed, he subsequently gave in 1847 a history (which he quotes here) to the electors of Tamworth; but the closing stage of this change is that at which he commences, with the letter of Mr. Parker, a potato-dealer, to Sir James Graham. Other letters -of a similar kind are referred to, and through September Peel and Graham correspond on the subject of the harvest, potatoes included; they consult the 'weather-glass and interchange reports, and it is remarkable that on evidence so scanty as that given up to this point, so early, that is to say, as October 13, Peel proffers this searching question to Sir James-
"Whether there is not that well grounded apprehension of actual scarcity that justifies or compels the adoption of -ervcri means of relief which the exercise of the prerogative or legislation might afford ?"
A letter from Graham crosses to the same effect, but is a little more explicit:-
" Could we with propriety remit duties by order in Council when Parliament might be so easily called together? Cait fhese dutei, once remitted by Act of Parliameat, bc crcr again re-imposed I"
HTere is the first plain anticipation of abolition total and final, and before we have learnt much of the fate of the potatoes. It is to be observed, too, how Peel answers it:-
" Interference with the due course of the laws respecting the supply of food is so momentous and so lasting in its consequences that we must not act withr,ut the most accurate information. I fear the worst. I have uritten to he Duke also."
In fact, if we may speculate on the import of this oracular paragraph, it seems to say, " I take you, Graham, but we mus' wait to know what the Duke says." By the same post Peel wtites to Lord Heytesbury, from whom he requires authentic informa-tion, in commendation of " total and absolute repeal :" and Lord Heytesbury is impressed, as becomes him, by the letter,which he communicates to ~Sir Thomas Freemantle " most confidentially."
Tn the meantime Graham replies that " we shaU be drivren to suspension," but he does not repeat his inference as to the consequences, for it was unnecessary. Peel sends Dr. Playfair and Professor Lindley to Dublin to inquire and report-to blow bubbles, as it might be; and Lindley and Playfair fulfil their commission seriously. Other communications are made to him with respect to the potatoes, and Sir James Graham points a letter on the subject on the 27th of October thus:-
" The Anti-Corn Law pressare is about to commence, -and it will be the most formidable movement in modern times. Everything depends on the skill, promptitude, and decision with which it is met.d
Peel does meet it with skill and promptitude, but the decision on the other hand is not so obvious. The Cabinet meets at his house on the 31st of October, and he prepares thera for his Cabinet memorandum of November 1, in which he proposes to make pecuniary advances to distressed districts, which " will compel the assembling of Parliament before Christmas," which further " compels an immediate decision on these questions"
"Shall wo maintain unaltered"Shall we modify-
'Shall we suspend-the operation of the Corn Laws ?"
These " three courses" are thereupon discussed by him without that ingenuous reference to the conse*quences contemplated as " lasting" by Sir James -Graham and himself, and to which we have already odverted. Without a hint of the graver questions telegraphed to and fro, without any disclosure of the proposals which we infer to be ready in the event of an approving dictum from the Dcke, the pernive Cabinet already exhibited " serious differences of opinion," and separated to meet again so ,early as the 6th of November.
In the meantime other communications are made wto Sir Robert on the progress of the potato disease, and among them two letters from the Duke of
- mfnoirs by ihe Right Hon. Sir Robert Peel, BDrt., tP.2.&o., pubbi3hed by the trustoee of his papers, Lord Mahon rd o'w My.- Stanhopel and the tight Hon. Edward Cardwell, Ip rVoL IL Murray, 1851.
Portland and Lord Kenyon, on which Sir Robert interposes to comment. Lord Kenyon proposes thata bounty shall be offered to encourage our fisheries, with premiums for dibbling wheat, and Lord Kenyon further " takes the liberty of suggesting a special public acknowledgment of our dependence on God's mercy in our preseut distressed
state." The Duke of Portland simply proposes a I public subscription, to which he himself offers 1 1,0001. It is observable that Sir Robert neither discusses the latter proposal in his reply to the Duke of Portland, nor refers to it in his commentary, though he is almost satirical at the expense of his other correspondent, contending that " he might think it hardly consistent with reason to adopt the advice of Lord Kenyen, and offer a bounty on catching fish, or make a public acknowledgment of our dependence on God's mercy, and at the same time leave in ful operation the restraints which man had imposed upon the import of provisions." The silence as regards the Duke of Portland's offer will appear more significant if we look back to the chain of reasoning in thej cabinet memorandum, which was this:-
"1 We must decide what we will do with the Corn Laws, because we must call Parliament together, and we must call Parliamenb together because we must make advances of public money to provide food or employ labour."
Advances of public money were the key of his position on Sir Robert's own showing, and he was not prepared to let it slip in the spontaneous overflow of private opulence. He may have had excellent reasons for declining the proffered substitute,* but his omission to acknowledge it is nevertheless remarkable.
On the 6th of November the Cabinet came together, and Peel submitted to them certain proposals, which were a development of his former ones. An Order in Council was substantially to remit the duties on grain until a day named in the Order, and Parliament, which was to be called together to sanction the Order, was to be informed of his intention of submitting to it a wdification of the existing law immediately after the recess. But the Cabinet, by a very considerable majority, declined giving its assent to these proposals, which were supported only by the Earl of Aberdeen, Sir James Graham, and Mr. Sidney Herbert. It was "most painful to Peel to differ from his colleagues," but he determined to retain office for the present, and " not to recedefromthe position hehad taken." Of his determination not to advance we have no such assurance. His position had already been interpreted more clearly by others than it had been candidly and ingenuously avowed by himself; for Lord Stanley had written to him on November the second, declaring how widely he differed " as to the necessity for proposing to Parliament a repeal of the Comn Laws." Peel replied to this letter on November 6, in a sentence worthy the analysis of Pascal -
' I must, however, observe that I have not proDosed to the Cabinet that we should recomnmend to Parliamont the repeal of the Corn Laws, still less that we should offer our advice to the Queen that the Corn Laws ought to be abandoned."
He and Graham, as we conceive, had telegraphed to each other that suspension and repeal were substantially identical, he had disclosed his design "most confidentially" to Lord Heytesbury, and Lord Stanley somehow had surprised their secret. Peel, found with lantern, centrebit, and " Jemmy," demurely affects to have no design upon the premises.
The Cabinet separated on the 6th of November, with the understanding that it was to be summoned towards the latter end of the month to consider additional information and conclude upon its course. Peel in the interval authorized large purchases of corn in the United States on account di the Government, though he would have preferred, as he says, its introduction by ordinary agencies, encouraged " by the suspension of the import duty." On the 22d of November Lord John Russell addressed that letter to the electors of the city of London which "j ustified the conclusion that the Whig party was prepared to unite with the Anti-Corn Lawt League in demanding the total repeal of the Corn Laws ;" and this letter, says Peel, " could not fail to exercise a very material influence on the public mind and on the subject matter of our deliberations in the Cabinet." Yet the assertion that Peel himself was influenced by the appearance of this letter " in the advice which he offered to the Cabinet" is stoutly disclaimed, though " he felt it to be his duty to state his opinion witlh regard to the consequences that ought naturally to follow the issue of such a letter." In his memorandum of November 26 he accordingly proposes to suspend the operation of the Corn Law, and to " review the whole question of agricultural protection." Under ordinary circtunstances he would advise that this " review should be undertaken by others," " review" meaning in the contemplation of those others total repeal. But the emergency imposes duties, and he is willing to take the responsibility of meeting it if his colleagues concur, and to " review" on his own account. Two or three days afterwards he sounds the Duke on the propriety of an immediate suspension of the Corn Law, admitting that itinvolves permanent " alterations," to
take effect after the period of suspension. The same I day Lord Ripon, who has interpreted " review," "alterations," "modifications," &c., as an abandonment of protection, writes a pressing letter to know what " equivalent or compensation for protection," respecting which Peel had been throwing out mysterious hints at the last meedng of the Cabinet, was contemplated or possible. Peel returns the unsatisfactory answer that suspension is or was the main question, and that "it would be very unfortunate to differ about minor details." Actually Lord Ripon is put off with this, and "Ever, &c., Robert Peel." Among other communications from his colleagues, Peel, however, gets one from the Duke of Wellington the day after, which states that " his own judgment would lead him to maintain the Corn Laws," but " his only object in public life is to support Sir Robert Peel's administration of the Government for the Queen." Goulburn and Whamcliffe may now intimate that suspension comes too late for its alleged object; the former may apprehend that there will be " few dissentient voices" to the charge of " treachery and deception ;" and the latter may express his desire to "die honourably ;" for Peers resolution is now taken. He knows the Duke's " object in life" by a letter which he must have received on December the 1st, and on December the 2d he is reading to the Cabinet a memorandum which, to say the least, is tolerably explicit at length. The legerdemain, in short, has come to a close ; or rather the well-fitting mask is thrown aside.
How neatly and glibly he nowruns down the chain of consecutive inference from his refusals to pledge himself against altering the Corn Laws to the preference for that " final adjustment which can only ensue from total repeal." And this preference is qtuite independent of the potato rot of which we have beard and read so much recently. " I think, guite independently of present circumstances, that it would be true policy gradually to relax protective duties, and that the experience of the last four Vears is decisively in favour of that policy." The conclusion of the whole is that he now proposes what less than a month since he disclaimed to Lord Stanley, that in one way or other " all duties on the import of grain, meal, and flour should be abolished." The experience of four years has determined the
conclusion, but till the last four days, or the Last
few hours, he has abstained in his innocence from acknowledging its cogency.
The Cabinet was of course deeply moved by this proposal, and its discussions continued till the 5th of December. Though there was a period in the course of them wben Peel says ho hopedthatsome such measure might receive the assent of all his colleagues, this
hope was disappointed, and Lord Stanley and the Duke of Buccleuch proposing to retire from office, and others of the Cabinet giving their consent reluctantly, on the 5tb of December Peel "repaired" to Osborne, and went through the " very painful " ceremony of tendering his resignation. Two or three days afterwards, " anticipating," as he says, " the difficulty which Her Majesty wvould have in forming a Government," he addressed to her a letter, to be communicated to his successor, with the professed desire of facilitating his arrangements. It
had not that effect, however, as the world is aware, for he thought "it would be embarrassing were he to suggest the details of any
measure for the adjustment of the great question which presses for a settlement;" and Lord John Russell and the Marquis of Lansdowne were not prepared to 'cake office " without further explanations or assurances from Sir Robert Peel and other members of his Cabinet." Sir Robert, in his letter to the Queen, professed a " general accordance" with the concluding paragraph of Lord John
Russell's letter to the electors of the city of London, this paragraph being itself as general an intimation of a statesman's policy as he could confide beforehand to that distinguished, but not very select, auditory. A letter, signed-" J. R. G. Graham," in reply to applications of Lord John for greater explicitnezs, we have quoted above, but we must not lose the further committal of his candid chief contained in this highly characteristic docunient:-
e4 "Re (Sir Robert) was prepared some time before your letter of the 22d of November had appeared to advise measures which, in their general outline, did not materially vary from those which that lettei suggested.
11 lHe would have thought it good policy to conciliate aequiescence in the certain attainment, at no remote period, of the main object by very liberal dealing as to pecuniary burdens, and at the same time to prevent alarm and the risk of disturbance by such provisions as caution and forbearance might suggest."
This beautiful jujube betrays its authorship without the intimation which we obtain from the editors that the original draught of these paragraphs, though signed by Sir James Graham, is in Sir Robert Peel's handwrithng. The " sweet Roman hand" is not to be mistaken, nor the effect of this jujube on Lord John Russell's constitution. Some further interviews took place and letters passed, but Sir Robert Peel now protested against the communication to him of " the outlines" even of a plan of adjustment, and Lord John Russell concurred, for even this course would not have helped him to surmount impediments which he shortly encountered among his own supporters. Lord John Russell also required, but Peel would not give his pledge to support immediate repeal, for " a pledge on a particular point is open to aU the objections to which a pledge to a series of measures is liable." In short, Peers facilities were like fairy gold, which turns into fint stones and other things as valueles. Accordingly, though Lord John is ready to admit that Peel has been willing to diminish his difficulties, he does not admit his readiness to remove them, while he resigns his task upon other grounds. Peel again " repairs" to Windsor Castle, and is requtired very graciously to withdraw his resignation. He states that he desired no time for reflection, though time was offered him; his mind was made up, and on the 20th of December he returned from Windsor to London again First Minister of the Crown. M. Guizot, a commentator partial to Sir Robert, has expressed his opinion on this singular episode:-
" In great conjunctures this conflict of subtle and always rather obscure manceuvres, under an outward show of perfect sincerity, is one of the weak points in represeDtative government; and men of lofty character can alone surmount its emnbarrassments by sinple, prompt, and bold resolutions and words. I do not find that in their negotiations at this period either Sir Robert Peel or the Whigs displayed this greatness of souL The Whigs aimned at too much security, and Sir Robert at too much liberty. When men talk of saving a nation they must be ready to accept more doubtful chances and to make heavier sacrifices."*
It is ;emarkable that the sacrifice which Peel put foremost, as a reason for refusing the pledge which Lord John asked him for was the detriment to his party position-in other words, "because the giving of it would impair my influence in the House of Commons ;" and yet this sacrifice was afterwards exacted from him by the course which he took,without the salvo to his dignity of its free and voluntary concession. For the present, however, he was Minister, and he returned to town exultingly. He felt, as he says in a letter to the Princess Lieven, vritten at the close of the crisis, " like a man restored to life after his funeral service had been preached," and he lost no time in throwing off his grave clothes and electrifying his colleagues.
It is observable that he had no suave arguments to throw away upon any of them now that theRubicon had been crossed. They met at his house in Downing-street, but there were no " three courses" there. On the contrary, "Sir Robert Peel informed them that he had not summoned them for the pturpose of deliberating upon what was to be done but for the purpose of announcing to them that he was Her Majesty's Minister, and, whether supported or not, was firmly resolved to meet Parlianient as Her Majesty's Minister, and to propose such measures as the public exigencies required." Of one thing he was certain-had he proposed to abolish the multiplication table, or the law of gravity, he was certain of the Duke's sanction, for the Duke "was of opinion that the formation of a Government in which Her Majesty woulcd have confidence was of much greater importance than the opinions of any individual on the Corn Law, or on any other law." The Duke took as simple a view of the question as if Lord John Russell had been the first Napoleon and the door of the Cabinet was the high road to Brussels. His statesmanship was of a simple, obstructive order, which we miss in these days as we might miss a turnpike gate at which we once paid due and familiar tribute. The rest of the Cabinet made their several " sacrifices" in imitation of their chief, and the Duke of Buccleuch consummated his in very abominable grammar. Lord Stanley alone persisted in resigning, and adhered to his resolution to resist the repeal of the Corn Laws.
From this point there is little more of interest in the narrative. Discussions as to movers and seconders and the management of the Corn Law debate 10 orll pages on the employment of proxies in the iiouse of Lords aud preparations for retiring when the Lrish Bill was rejected, are almost the only remaining contributions to history. The circumstances of the Repeal are otherwise so recent and familiar that we see no reason for reproducing them here from external sources. But, for the personal justification of Sir Robert Peel, which is now the only question, we find at the close of the memoir, before he drops his mantle on Sir James Graham as his alter ego, a statement and a letter, in both of which he professes to discuss the charges brought against him. To both of these it is indispensable that we should refer, though we shall consider them concurrently with other imputations to which they do not so much as seem to give an answer.
In the first place, the fact of " reserve" or deception (call it by a pretty or an ugly name) is deliberately admitted. His " views with regard to the policy of maintaining the Corn Law" had undergone a change, irrespective of the potato rot, and but for this unforeseen calamity " it was his intention" to have apprized the Conservative party that he could no longer resist a motion for the consideration of the whole question. We assume, that is, anld we may fairly assume, that he could no longer resist a motion for that total, though graduated, repeal v;hich he approved, as he stated, for independent reasons.
One excuse for omitting this communication we may put aside, then, at once, and as it is the most weighty we shall have lighter employment with the rest. "Explanation," he says, " could not have been given on the precise mo>de in which the duties on corn were to be dealt with without disturbing all commercial operations connected with the corn trade, and incurring the risk of giving to somle parties an u.nfair advantage over others." Explanations as to the principle of the measure contemplated, as to the change in Peel's views from the resolution to maintain Protection to his acquiescence in the necessity for its graduated abolition, could, however, have been given, as we may reasonably assume, without any such risk as that contemplated. But whether this assumnption is right or not is quite immaterial to Peel's confutation. If theseox-
planations were really not without risk, yet, as he would justify his intention of affording them to his party at an earlier date, he eould not plead the risk as a reason for withholding them subsequently. If, on the contrary, there was no more risk in the one case than the other, the whole argument is an afterthought and a pretence. To render it really available for his justification it must be shown that the same explanation, or an explanation to the same extent, would have had different effects at two different periods. But to employ any inference from the potato rot to this effect is simply to sustain an argument as rotten as the bad pota.oes.
The differences in the Government which led to their resignation on the 9th of December are made a further plea for maintaining this long reserve to-I wards his party. But this plea will not apply toI the interval before differences had arisen in consequence of the communication of his views to the Cabinet. He fairly contends that he could not, if he had had leisure for the purpose, have made such om-
munications separately to a selected few. "Times are changed," he says, "ince a Prime Minister, after ascertaining the sentiments of the Marquis of Hertford, and the Duke of Rutland, and the Earl of Ljonadale, ould form a pretty good guess of the in. clinations and probable onduct of a whole party." But that such ommunications were no longer cogent neessitated a more open dealing with his followers of the House of Commons. Nobody had
enforced the obligations of party connexion more rigorously than he had. He had claimned the most implicit confidence from his followers, had obliaoed them to rescind their votes at his bidding, and Rad sacrificed their self-respect in the eyes of their ad*versaries to maintain his own authority unques. tioned. Yet he declined to requite them with the slightest consideration, because he was unable to influence them through the chiefs of the great familes. This may truly have been a personal difficulty or inconvenience; but it affords no excuse that a whole party was kept in ignorance and permitted to pledge themselves with unshaken confidence, in the face of a most determined opposition, to a policy which he, their leader, had secretly condemned. On the point where a j ustification is really required it is simply, hke his other plea-not to the purpose.
Grant that it was hopeless that by communicating his altered views to his rank and file he could carry them with him, as he carried with him so many of
his staff, the question stiU remains, to which he I volunteers no answer, how could he deal so insidiously with his Cabinet? His colleagues there had been chosen by himself to participate in his counsels - they were in constant communication with him, and many of them were his intimate friends; not only as friends had they claims to his confidence, but, as Ministers, their responsibility was only inferior to his own. Their prospects and their reputations were, nevertheless, sacrificed to the maintenance of a secret, kept a secret from a notion of duty so transcendental that it suits a Jesuit's measure of relative obligations. The incontestable claim3 and duties of public life were set aside for a loose conception of public policy-a conception nevertheless so limited that it is contracted to the presumption that one individual only could carxy a measure of public neoessity; in short, that if conscience had compelled to open dealing, " I should have failed in carrying the repeal of the born Laws."
Now, we have no profound deference for this everlasting pronoun, which used to drain the compositor's box and exhaust the critic's patience. But to sustain it here as the pivot of the entire argument we must hold that, without Peel, free trade in corn was impossible. Again and again on former occasions we have admitted his talents, his experience, his discernment, and his personal weight and influence with the country; but it involves too large a demand on our common sense and our patienoe to allow that without Peel Protection was invincible. On the contrary, the total repeal of the Corn Laws was inevitable. As MÂ£r. Jelinger Symons truly remarks, "Tnstead of being a consummation which Sir Robert Peel could alone achieve, it was a destiny which Sir Robert Peel was powerless to avert."+ As respects the Corn Laws, it was not of the last necessity that they should be repealed at a certain dat> or by a particular Minister; stiUl less was it essential or desirable that this Minister should have the credit of forestalling those who had laboured zealously in the cause while he, who, as he tells us (p. 98), adopted contrary opinions, "without mitch serious reJlection" was steadily resisting and decrying their efforts. It was not for the vanquished to filch the honour of the victors or for the labourer of the eleventh hour to appropriate the harvest.
As respects his personal desires, apart from public grounds, the case is different. It was so great a glory to the name of Peel that we can understand, though we cannot justify, his determination to grasp it at any cost to himself or his supporters. It iS not, indeed, absolutely clear that he estimated at its full amount the penalty to himself. In this very memoir he says,-" I felt that the injury to the character of public men, the admitted evil of shaking confidence in their integrity and honour, would be only temporary." He may then have calcu]lated on a speedier reparation of the detrimnent, to himnself included, than the 5equel afforded. It is observable that it ws not till 247 that he remarked that the times were changed since a Prime Minister, if he carried with him the heads of his party, could pretty well calculate on the conduct of the rest; and the distinguished biographer of Lord George Bentinck has interpreted that significant protrusion of his chin when 200 sturdy'squires al-d lords of acres walked out of the House to record their votes against his Irish BilL There were symptoms just before his career was jut short by the melancholy accident which terminated his life that his professed abdication of influence as a public leader was not considered altogether obligatory. " Never, since his retirement from office," says Me Guizot, referring to his attitude on the Pacifico debate, " had Sir Robert Peel spoken on foreign policy with so much development and precision." Whither the development would have led him it is vain now to conjecture. But we may infer that he would have remained the same man, that he would never have been indifferent to the realities of power, or have become insensible to the charms of office.
At the close of his apology for similar conduct on the Catholic Relief Bill he says, " It may be that I was unconsciously influenced by motives less perfectly pure and disinterested" than those he has particularized; then, why should he not have been infuenced by similar motives of "personal ambition" in his conduct on the Corn Laws? That he was not a trustworthy judge of his own motivos is perfectly evident from many passages of his career. We must not judge him solely by his solemn public litanies, by the asseverations of self-sacrifEce sworn upon his white waistcoats, but by the acts with which they corresponded or rather did not correspond. There is a frequent and compromising inconsistency inthis respect. For example, in moving the repeal of the Corn Laws, on the 22d of January, when such a declaration was appropriate, he protested that " to be relieved from offce witn perfect honour vould be the greatest n avour that could be conferred on him." But we must compare with this his declaration to the Princess Lieven, not a month before, on resuming office, that he felt "like a man restored to life after his funeral service had been preached." Again, in his former volume we have a contradiction as patent. When about to lose his seat for Oxford he speaks as usual of " the painful sacrifice," the forfeiture of that high distinction which he has prihed much more than any other object of ambition ," yet seven days later he writes to Bishop Iloyd on the prospect of his re-election and retention of this high distinction -" In very homely phrase I say to you (what I would not say to any one else) I care very little abolut the matter." When he was thus inconsistent himself as respects his motives, it is not too much for others to say that, at least, they were equivocal.
" If," as we ourselves said in reviewing the first volume of these 7emeirs, " his ambition neither distorted his views nor compromised his principles, he is exempt from blame." But who shaUl resolve this " if ?" It is not for us to affect a knowledge of the secrets to which the most public life is anl impenetrable screen. But there is one dark doubt never yet resolved, to which we should not do our dutyif we suppressed a reference here. " The Canning Episode," as it has been termed, coneluded amid the condoning cheers of the House of Commons; but we agree with Mr. Symons, who has analyzed its incidents, that the evidence for the
defe ce was neither complete nor satisfactory. And we add to his observations the forgotten passage from the famous article in the Edinburgh Review :-
" Mr. Peel is well aware that it is not the year 1829 which he has to explain and justify. It is not when private opinions and publio conduct are coincident that a man has anything to repent of, or the country any reason to complain. Could Mr. Canning have answered to his wish, I Were our honoured Banquo here !' that princely and forgiving eye would have beamed with even unusual brightness in wecoming the new convert to his cause. He might have shbunk at the recital of the inward change of 1825,-at the thought of tho eventful interval and the continued resist. ance; above all, he must have felt the dif6culty of reconciliog with these communications, so long and so myste. niously concealed, the disqualification publicly pronounced on him in 1827, by reason of opinions which, it now appears, were held at that very time by at least one of his seceding colleagues."
This imputation was not only notorious at the time, but the article which contains it is one of those included in the Selections from tle Bdinburght Reviw, published in 1833. It is aUl but impossible that it should not have been brought to Peers notice; yet how can we account for his protracted silence in connexion with his late and imperfect vindication ?
We refer to this topic as an earlier evidence of the ambiguity even of his motives and objects. As to his conduct, regarded as a whole, his case, in our opinion, is not bettered by the publication of these Memoirs. A statesman may accept the policy of his opponents on rare occasions without impeachment; but this was the course of Sir Robert Peel not once nor twice only, but at every crisis of his public life. As Mr. Macaulay comn-
* As an element to be taken into consideration it will be, however, found in p. 193 that Peel's calculation on the 29th of November only amounted to half a mitIen, or Ca quarkr of a mWMon, for supporting ribhmen with food.

plained in a memorable speech, this conduct was pursued byhim "on something like a systen ;" and such a ystem deserves -neither respect nor tenderness, though it was that of the foremost statesman of our time. It is simply a very sorTy spectacle to find the most eminent passages of aLife made up of long and tedious recantations. It is a spectacle damaging to public morality, and ftom the conse. quences of which we have not yet recovered; and it must necessarily Qloud the fame of its author when history comes to regard him. calmly, unbiassed by the predilections of his friends and contemporaries. Admit all the benefits he was tlie medium of conferring,-admit his talents, virtues, atthority, the sum of his life amounts to this,he exercised a personal influence with the public, but without creating or guiding public opinion; he played a great part without those elements of great. ness, a comprehensive foresight and a firm purposo; he was true to no policy or party connexion, though he eminently served his country more thnn once by his supple deference to the will of the majority. His course was thus adorned by splendid trophies, but it was thickly strewn with discarded opinionsopinions adopted, perhaps, as in the case of the Corn Laws, "without much serious reflection," but defended with remarkable talent and vigour, and always from an obtruseve consciousness of duty,'up to the stage at which they involved him in "f painful sacrifices" and pitiful shuffles, preparatory to their sirrender.
Great Exhibition Of Art Treasures.
GREA T X OF ART TREASUBES.
(FwkOx OURI OWN ODRPAPODzNT.)
MANOHESTER, rARn 14.
The gallery of modern paintings, which is on the north side of the building, will be & source of great attraction to visitors. It is divided into three saloons, separated by two bays or chapels, and has been placed uader the charge of Mr. AugustusEgg, R.A., who, aided by numerous assistants, is now actively engaged in hanging the pictures-a 'work of no small labour and difficulty. A large number of the contributions have already arrived, but many have still to come, and probably the gallery will not be completed until the last moment. The period embraced in the collection is that which extends from the year 1700, the date at which the gallery of ancient pictures ends, to the present time. It will be observed that the division iz in some respects a little arbitrary; but it would be difficult to draw any distinction against which the same charge might not be brought. Under any arrangement wbich could be made it would be imposible to avoid admitting some pictures which ought to be excluded, and perhaps excluding others which ought to be admitted. In two of the saloons which are devoted to the exhibition of works of dead masters the pictures are hung as far as possible in chronological order; while in the third, which is occupied by specimens of living artists, they are arranged with a view to show the peeuliar effects of each painting, and to produce a lharmony of colour inconsistent with strict attention to chronology. The productions of each painter are, wherever practicable, placed together.
At the close of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries the state of art in England was such that portraiture alone was encouraged, and, with almost the single exception of Sir James Thornhill, who was employed to paint the dome of St. Paul's and the ceilings at Greenwich and Chelsea Hospitals, the artists of those days devoted themselves exclusively to portrait painting. Accordingly, the visitor will find a considerable portion of the first saloon occupied by portraits. Here are specimens of Wootton, the Landseer of his day, and of Hoare, the portrait painter of Bath, a city then in the full blaze of its fame, to which people went to drink the waters and to have their portraits taken. They do not evince great artistic ability, but they are highly interestin
as illustrations of the state of art in England at the time, and are of great importance with reference to that chronological arrangement which forms so prominent and so valuable a feature in the Exhibition. Hogarth is the first great name which occurs in the annals of English art previous to the establishment of the Royal Academy. The first saloon contains some of the finest specimens of that master which are not already in the national collections. The visitor will here find the "M arch to Finebley," " Southwvark Fair," " Garrick as Richard i.," the "Scene from the Beggars' Opera," the " Lady's Last Stake," and other works rarely seen even by the most ardent and ins duatrious connoisseurs. Here also are some of the earliest examples of the foundation membera of the Royal Academy, including their diploma picturesa remarkably interesting series of paintings-now publicly exhibited for the iirst time. They are ontributed by the Royal Academy, which with great iiberality, before sending them.down to Man-
hester, re,giAt and varnished them at its own expense. On one aide will be seen the state of portrait painting in the time of Hudson, the master of Reynolds; and the observant visitor will detect in the earlier pictures of Sir Joshua traces of the school in which he was taught. But so great and original a genius could not long remain bound by the trammels of a master, and the walls of the saloon afford abundant evidence that, abandoning the stiff style of Hudson, he speedily became what he is still-the greatest portrait painter of the English school. Among the contributors of Sir Joshuas are - the Duke of Bucclench, the Duke of Portland, Earl Spencer, Lord Lyttelton, Miss Coutts, Mr. Vernon Smith, and the Royal Academy. On the other side are hung several admirable examples of the great rival of Reynolds in portrait painting-Gainsborough, whose style is so masculine and so thoroughlyEnglish. His specimens include both portraits and landscapes, and among the foimer is the famous " Blue Boy," painted to disprove the opinion of Reynolds that the predomninence of blue in a picture is incompatible with a good effect of colour.
The firat chapel or bay is devoted to the exhibition of pictures by continental artists, of whom some very fine specimens are possessed by the owners of private galleries in England. Here Greuze, Canaletti, and others will be seen to great advantage. The principal examples of Canaletti are those which he painted during his brief residence in England. They are contributed by the Duke of Buccleuch and the Duke of Richmond, and in point of architectuiral detail and exquisite finish are equal to any of his Venetian masterpieces.
In the central saloon, which is about double the size of the famous large room of the Royal Academy in Somerset-house, while the light is infinitely superior, will be seen the foundation of what has become so celebrated as the English school of landscape painting. On one side Richard Wilson, on the other his contemporary, Gainsborough, are represented by the finest specimens. Here is exhibited, by the most exquisite examples, the state of art in England during the early history of the Royal Academy-a period embracing the presidencies of Reynolds, West, and Lawrence. T'he genius of Wilkie, of Etty, of Stothard, of Zoffany, and many others is displayed in those splendid productions which have rendered their names immortal, and which are among the glories of English art. Her Majesty contributes the famous picture of " Blindman's Buff," by Wilkie; and the " Rent Day" andthe
Card Piayers" are exhibited by Mr. Chapman and Miss Bredel. The admirers of President West wil rejoice to fLndthat someof his best pictures are included in the collection. His " Death of General Wolfe," of which there is a duplicate in the Grosvenor Gallery, and " The Departure of Regulus," have been lent to the Exhibition by the Queen; his " Cupid and Psyche" by Mr. Eick; " The Battle on the Boyne" by the Marquis of Westminster ; and "Death on the Pale Horse " by the Royal Academy. Not far from the pictures of West the eye is arrested by the vigorous productions of Constable, among which the
"Landscape and Cattle," contributed by the Royal Academy, and the " Lock," furnished by Mr.Foster, are magnificent ex;amples of English art, Of Etty the specimens are numerous and splendid. Mr. Labouchere exhibits "Cleopatra on the Cgdnus ;" Mtr. Young, " Venus descending ;" Mr. Gilott, the " Bivouac of Cupids ;" Mr. Tenuant, "the Homeric Dance ;" Mr. Todd, " Joan of Arc at the Stake ;" and the Rev. Isaao Spencer, " St. JohnPreachig in the Wilderness." The Royal Academy fuumishes the " Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs" and the Manchester Royal Institution the" Sirens," and Mr. EUis "The Idle Lake." Sir Thomas Lawrence is represented by his celebrated portraits of the Kemble family, contributed bv tho 3arl of Chesterfield, and by those of the late Duke of Neweastle, Sir Robert Peel, Mr. Croker, Sir Humphrey Davy, Sir Sidney Smith, and rany other distinguished personages. The visitor will have an opportunity of studying Turner in all the stages of his progress, through all the changes of his great, but erratic genius,
from his diploma picture to the latst erxample of his Venetian eccerntricities. ' Tiie Eri i Yarborough, wh'oe grandfather, with two ,oth noblemen, subcriabed: a xum-of money to'en .

The second -chapel is occupied by examples of some of.the more recent continental artists.' Ary Seleffer, Delaroche, and Vernet ate the leading cohtributco* to this division. Ihe visitor will be astonished at the number and excellence of the modem continental paintings posesd by private English gen4tlemen.
We now enter the saloon devoted to -the produc-. tions of living artists. Here, of course, the chronological arrangemett ends,' for it would be absurd to attempt toclasifypictures according to therespective ages of' men still living-to put Mulready against Millain Eastlake againt Hunt,' or Iandaeer against Ansdeli Judging from $rhat he has already done, Mr. Egg appears tohave no other. desire than to p). the best pictures in, the best places, if, izdeed, selection be posible in a gallery where, from the distribution of the light, SUl place are equally good. To thiB saloon Iancashire is a munificent contributor, the men of-Manchezter, Iverpool, Prestonj and other townsinthecountybeing, asiswellknowwn, among the most liberal patrons of modem artista. Here are exhibited many of the best pictures whiclL have graced the galleries of the Royal Acade&mfor a
number of yeao past, and the various beauties of, which are consequently fMiliar to all who 'have a taste for art. The visitor will not fail to recognla as old favourites the "Dignity and Impudence," the " Rat Catching," the "Life in the Old Dog,"
the. " Carrying Home the Deer," the "Stag at' B3ay," the " :Alexander and Diogenes," of Ladoeer; the "Battle of Rovoredo," .the "Wrzeck," the "Ridaasoa,"the "St.Miehael's Mount," of Stanfieldthe "Heloise," the 'Pilgrinms in Sightof Itome." th

Some have been inprovedt some injured by Age; but the whole exhibition is most honourable to the industry and geniua of our artists, and presents a gratifying contrast to the earlier apcmnens in the firat saloon. Every noted private gallery in the kingdom hu contributed its one, two, three, or more pictures, and every variety and shade of excellence receive Ample, even profuse, illustration. The collection is catholic in the truest sense, and depicts with unsurpassable fidelity the condition of English art at the present time.

Sir,-Disagreeing as I do with your reverend correspondeat "aAst Efindcl Incutmbent" in the application morm practically~ of the idea, that the "1beat means of obtainhig an equitable valuation ix by means of the ProDerty-tax valuation," I content mrself by remarking that the Property-tax Is only the vehicle by which returns are eol lected, and these infact-analyze them as you rmay-eupply no real valuation of property at all; they are, in fact, nUre sub8titutes for a Taluation.
But to the insance more particularly alluded to-viz.,St George,. lanover-square. TheProperty-tax returns (q'ed value) amount to 1,097,580 per annum, while the poor-rate ssessment is upon a total annual rateable value of onlr 694,3801. I now remark that upon thi sm1er sum is ollected for the poor 7id; in the pound, while in some w in tho neighbourhood of Thames-street in the city the same poor-rates amount tos. 6d in the pound.
The assessment of the parish of St George, Eanoversquare, and its discrepancy with the Property-tax rettia=
can readily be acconted for when it i borne in mind (and it is fresh in my reoollection) that, -upon an appel of his Grace the Duke of Devonshire as to the assessment of Devonshire-houso against the rating of this parish, Mr. Paine, the Duke's snuveyor, through the late Mr. Cilrksoo
elicited upon the appeal the fact that the assessment ot St. George's was no luation at all, and that the vestry in the first istance agreed upon a grosssum which should ropreent the total rateablo valuation of the entire parish, and then that this said sum should be apportioned throughout among the several ratepayers (being about 20,000).
Nevertheless, from this valuation (or rather quaai valuation) has been eliminated the very ausessment upon which basis or standard the entire poor-rates of the imortant pEainh of St. George, Ilanorer-square (Belgravia and Pin.
ico inclusive), are nowv collected.
The result of the appeal of the Duke of Devonshire wA (of course with these facts before the conrt) a reduction of 5001. a-year (within 401. of Mr. Paine's valuation), and so matters have stood even to the present day. Such practices as these wil fully account for the discrepancy of thi ea
snm of 403,2004 between the Poor-rate and the Property. tas returns. Let these essential differences be at least adjusted, and the equalization of the poor-rates at the west end of London, even with those of the east, may be anticipated; and then, in however philanthropic senseyour corre spondent, "Es End Incumbent," may ,egard the subject in relation to casnal poor, to him will be the credit due of daring to attempt the realization of a principle which parochial authorities dare not attempt, still less

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Having paid some attention to the subjects em. braced in the significant phrase "local self-government,n I hope you will permit me to say one word on the important question which has been vised into such prominent notice by your insertion of the letters from "An East End Incumbent."
The basis on which all parochial rating restS at the pre sent time is the 6th and 7th of William IV., chap. 96, ' An Act to RegulateParochial Assements." The DrSt sentence of this Act declares it to be desirable "to establish one uniform mode of rating for the relief of the poor throughout England and Wales ;" and the preamble goes on to dedare that after the 21st of March, 137, no rate for the relief of the poor shall be allowed " which shal not be made upon an estimate of the net annual value;" that is to say ofrrent, less rates, taxes, tithe commutation, rentcharg% repairs, insurance, and other expenses necessary to command such rent.
Now, Sir, you have shown, in your most excellent re. narks on this subject, that the actual value of house pro. perty in the different quarters of London is influenced to a very great extent by the amount of poor-rate paid by such
If the poor-rates in Paddington were 5s. in the pound, would the assessment either to the poor-rate or to the Pro. perty-tax, be anything like the sums they are? Would they not more nearly resemble those of the Easts
I know that I should not have given so much for the house I now live in, by 300. or 400? if the rates had been the same us paid by "A An Bast End Incubei*t;n and I am convinced that so equitable a man would not wish to raise thevalue of property in the East and detract from the Talue of that in the West, si ply to secure one uniform 1s -poor. rate from all portions of the metropolis.
If we are to have " equalization of poor rates" in this "village,"-and I see many advantages which would be obtained by such equalization-I contend that we must take an entirely nerw basis for our assessment. It will not do to quietly pick up the Property-ta collector's book, and say, "Thus shall bc our basis;" for by so doing we should have no equaization. An alberation in the rela tive salue of property we most assuredly should have; but no even, uniform, jUst proportion in the rating, save only in the nominal sum assessed.
But why ahould not the same description of house be first asseEsed at the ss e sum, whether it be situated east, west, north, or south, and then the uniform rate applied? I know that difficulties would accompany this arraugement, but I am convinced that no greater discrepancy would occur under such a systemthan t nder that which would adopt the Property-tax return as a basis of assessment; and where, as occurs very often, two houses exactly alike in size and in rdmost every other particular, pay different rentg, and are therefore assessed differentl. " Equalization ofprrates" therefore cannot be brougt about v;ithout n aoteration of the basis of assessment. ~So at least is the firm conviction of Your obedivrit aerm,

LO&DON, THURSDAY, A.PRIL 16, 187.
An extraordinary panic has seized the crowd of gentlemen who were members of the last Parliament, but are not of tho new one. They are in consUternation at the mediocrity of their successors and the period of legislative inefficiency with which EDgland is threatened. They have been beaten, not by bad men, but, what is worse, by nmen of straw-the merest lay figures of faction; anid, though they can easily reconcile themselves to their own defeat, they are concorned for the country that suffers this plague of nobodies. Hardly a nan of them can make a good speech, or has any politics. The panic ie extraordinary, not so much for those who feel it or for those about whom it is felt, but for the matter of it. This inefficiency, now so much apprehended, wa3 the chief characteristic of the last Parliament, and the very boast of all the three sections routed at the election. What vas called " the Manchester School," though Manchester has now rwaued itself from the igno-
nminy of schooldom, the Peelite coterie, and the I Conservatives, have all plumed themselves for some
time, not on what they have done, but what they stopped. The last are professedly worshippers of the god Tsumius, but the other two Sections I have done his obstinate Majesty not less
rservice for some time by their constant hostility to every practical and actual suggestion. For one thing they have proposed-generaly zomething as safe to propose as a railway to the Moon-they can enumerate with pride a dozen measures which they have opposed with more or less success. When the Conservatives, indeed, got in for a few months they snatched a rognish triumph by passing some measures made to their hand, and which they would not have allowed anaybodyelse to pass. Experience shows, indeed,that theConservatives ought to be in once in a Parliament. At intervals of five years or so the Sir Ron:nT PxEL for the time being-that is, the man in that political place and succession-ought to have his brief Saturnalia, just to pass what he will no longer oppose now that it answers his purpose, and what the other side will not oppose, because it is stolen from their own budget. But, if doing nothing has been hitherto the essence of patriotism, why is it all at once to be a national calamity'? Patting aside those twopenny questions of finance which have been lately elevated into the sublimest of human struggles, it is evident that, in the opinion of the ousted factions, neither the Church, nor the Law, nor Education, nor our great Cities, nor some half-dozen other likely subjects of leg s- lation, will be much the worse for being let alone a little longer.
As one runs through the names of the departed, one is struck by the preponderance of respectable Conservatives, who seem to surround one as the Grecian ghosts did BAurs in the infernal regions, and open their mouths in vain. Here are old county members, who have been returned to several Parliaments as the supposed advocates of interests which can no longer be disengaged from the interests of the people at large. It would be quite cruel to name them, though some of them are intolerable tyrants in their own little spheres, and have just so much of conscience as leads them to crush the conscience of everybody about them -tenalnts, clergy, little squires, and even their own sons. But in the whole 91 set down as Conservatives there are not half-a-dozen that by any stretch of fancy or favour could be set down as losses to the country. Persons of this class, who rest so much on their right of possession, and presume on the vi5 inerti* of the country, may be found to be in the way, aud cannot expect to be much missed when they are got rid of at last. As the Conservatives are more easily numbered than named, the Peelitea must be named to make a show, for their number is insignificant. But when we have named Mr. R. PArar., Mr. CAnDWEL, Sir S. NORTuCoTE, Mr. R. PHiuLxonE, and even if we should go through the whole dozen, we should only serve to show that the House has not lost in them what it most wants-a broad, simple, intelligible, and patriotic class of politicians. It has lost a class more ready to raise difficulties than to get over them, and aiming rather to be wiser and better than the rest of mankind than to appeal to the common sense of the good and the wise. Honestly, we do not see how any one practical discussion is likely to suffer by their absence. Then come those most dogmatical, most opinionated, most conceited men, hitherto classed as the Manchester SchooL We have ever done justice to their ability, and hope still to do so; but, in the computation of Parliamentary gains and losses, it is to be observed that the genuine influence of these men is rather extraParliamentary. No doubt, Mr. CoBDmr and Mr. BRIGHT, should he happily reeover, Mr. M. GiBsoN, Mr. W. J. Fox, and the rest, will find abundant opportunities for expressing themselves, perhaps even more freely than in the House of Commons. Some of their opinions, such as those about peace and arbitration, are so little adapted to the actual state of things that they simply interfere with the business of Parliament as much as if a Vegetarian or a Latter-Day Saint should insist on an annual night for the exposition of his fancies. In the case of this school, and the very similar sect of the Peelites, their almost complete massacre in the election will tend to the greater silence, possibly sometimes to the dulness, of our debates; but we shall not be sorry to miss speeches that can lead to no practical result, and are little more than ostentatious egotisms.
And now for the much maligned hundred and seventy odd whom the British publio-no such bad judges of mnen-have given us instead. It is true that many are but little known, and that many are young-some very young. But, even to take the most superficial estimate, there are qv ce as many Lords, and Honourables, and Baronit:, and great country names in the new as in the old House. The new names of this class cannot be a worse pick of the aristocracy than the old, and there is at least hope on the side of the young and the unknown. Some of the names are sufficiently well known to give a definite promise of novelty; there are enough Radicals, and Humorists, and Literary Men, and men said to be odd, to be some compensation for the less regular sort of talents thrown out in the general election. There are, too, many men of business, such as the new members for Manchester and for some other boroughs. Then there are old friends come back again, such as the member for South Durham. Otherwise the new list offers large scope for conjecture, and it is quite impossible to say what we may and what we may not expect in the new House. But the British House of Commons, as it was always supposed, does not depend chiefly on tbat sort of talent which a man brings from public meetings, from debating societies, from book-writing, or from any other special use of the mental or oratorical powers. It is a peculiar sphere, and has special requirements of its own. What it demands chiefly is common seuse; and a
man of common sense, good temper, and a clear and simple style of expression, is a far more useful man there than a declaimer, however fast and furious. We have that faith in the country, and especially in those feelings which have influenced the election, that we are sure the 170 now members comprise a respectable amount of character, good sense, and good manners. In such a lottery there must be more blanks than prizes, but they will not be all blanks, They will naturally start with more courage than the crowd which has submitted for years to the claims of louder and more forward speakers, and who are no longer able to break the spell of silence. One will encourage another, and before long we shall have to congratulate the country on the fact that the political soil is not wholly exhausted. In the general readiness to decry the new House we recognize little more than the uniform disparagement of a new generation by the old. What boy i leaving a school ever thinks that the new comers can rise to the stature of the giauts he can remember? Who, on revisiting his old school, does not think it lamentably fallen off ? Who does not deplore the decay of his town, the falling off of his neighbourhood, and the general degeneracy of society ? Of course, the old members think small of the new ones. We can remember these old ones thought quite as small by the " old " fogies" of their younger days. So it always has been, and always will be. We, however, beg
to retain fresher views and hopes, and to believe that the new members will tuim out at least as good as the old ones.
The Newfoundland Legislature is up in arms
The Neofoundland Legiature is up in arms against a Convention just agreed on between the English and French Governments on the subject of the Fisieries. A Rcport of the Committee of the Legislative Council is half pathetic, half rebeious. The mother country is charged with the deliberate abandonment of the rights and interests of the colony, and a preference of the foreigner to her own offspring. She is almost, in terms, called injusta noearca. "We should be either more or "less than men if bitterness were not added to "our disappointment, when we now find that the "parent which would not stretch out her hand to "help will do Po to despoil her own household, "and would fain take her children'c bread to give "it unto strangers." Their politeness stops short of the exact quotation.
The state of the case appears to be this .-The Fisheries of Newfoundland have been from the first discovery of the island mainly in the hands of the French. Before an English colony had settled in the place a French establishment at Placentia was already working the Newfoundland coast, and, on the principle of tha right of the first comer, was already in rightful possession of the Fisheries of Newfoundland. The two great wars between this country and France which terminated in the Peace of Utrecht deprived the French of all right to the territory of the island, but they still clung to their Fisheries, and that peace guaranteed them the exclusive privilege over the larger part of the coast. The Peace of 1763 continued the same privilege. By the Peace of 1783 the French exclusive right of fishing on the coast of Newfoundland was to commence on the east coast at Cape St. John, and thence to extend round the Strait of Bolle Isle, including all the western shore as far as Cape Ray. That is to say, the exclusive fishing over more than one-half of the Newfoundland coast was secured to them. The revolutionary war, of course, deprived them for the time of the privilege, but it was regained at the Peace of 1814. The sovereignty, howover, over the Newfoundland waters had not been enjoyed all this time by the English colonist without producing some feelings of proprietorship, and from the Peace of 1814 to the present time the exclusive rights of the French fishermen have been a constant grievance to the English coloniat and a subject of dispute. He has never acquiesced in them, and, if we are to trust the statement in this Report, his arguments have at times influenced the Colonial-office, and obtained language from it discrediting the French right. However, the French right has never been formally disallowed, but has, with this underprotest and murmur against it, gone on to the present time. Inasmuch, however, as any permanent dispute on such a subject, whatever might be the rights of it, was disadvantageous, and led to collisions between fishing parties, and angry feeling generaUy, it was thought beat a short time ago to review the whole question, and the result of this discussion between the French and English Governments was the Convention which is exciting, just now, so much indignation in Newfoundland.
This Convention confirms the French privilege of exclusive fishing secured by the Peace of 1814, andto the extent laid down in the Treaty of 1783, which the Peace of 1814 recognized,-that is to say, from Cape St. John, on the east coast, to Cape Bay, on the extreme south-west corner, i. e., half the east and the whole of the west coast of Newfoundland. But, this being the general prin. ciple of the Convention, a modification is made, by which the French give up a certain part of the west coast, i. e. the part between the Humber and Cape Ray, about 150 miles, to English fishing exclusively, in exchange for 80 miles' fishing on the coast of Labrador, to be enjoyed by them in common with the English. It must be added, however, that from the line of coast given up to exclusive English fishing, five fishing ports, with a neighbourhood of three miles, coast attaching to each, is excepted, and retained exclusively by the French.
Now, this being the arrangement, our first impression certainly would be that the English side had the best of thelbargain. The confirmation of the French privilege will, of course, disgust those who have dispuxted its right, but if that privilege is matter of treaty this part of the present Convention cannot be helped. We have no alternative but to confirm it. The only part of the Convention which was optional is the matter of exchange, and here, as we say, we seem at first sight to have the best of the bargain. A hundred and fifty miles of coast, with the exception of five fishing ports and tbree miles atbaching to each, are transferred from the exclusive use of the French to the exclusive use of the English fishermen, while, in exchange for this total transfer, the French are only admitted to an equal share with the English of 80 miles of the coast of Labrador. This transfer is indeed caUed by the Legislative Council of Newfoundland, " the retention by the British of the " exclusive use of our own coast," which being considered the orthodox aspect of it, of course the Council " thanks you for nothing." But what does the Council mean by " our own coast T" If they mean our own for ordinary inland purposes, nobody denies that, because the coast for such purposes of course goes along with the possession of the territory of the island; but such a proprietorship of the coast as this is wholly irrelevant to the present question. If they mean by " our own coast" our own coast for fishing, that is not true. The Couincil of Newfoundland proceeds upon ths tacit assumption that, as lords of the territory of Newfoundland, the coast of Newfoundland naturally belongs to them, with its Fisheries and everything appertaining to it. But that is the very distinction which those successive treaties acknowledged at the Peace of 1814 made. They separated the Fisheries of Newfoundland from the territory. It must be confessed that such an arrangement is an awkward one. Every 'squire likes to have the fishing of the river which runs by his estate. The land and the water go together in our natural ideas. But arrangements by treaty, however artificial they may be, must be observed.
It is no wonder that, assuming so high a ground of proprietorship, the Council of Newfoundland grumbles at this Convention. But independently of this fundamental blot upon the Convention, that it recognizes French rights, the Council also finds fault with the particular bargain made, and pronounces itself much the loser in the exchange of a share of the Labrador Fisheries for the exclusive use of half the west coast of Newfoundland. The exception of the five filUiing ports from this latter transfer is pronounced to depreciate the value of the concession sr much that it is hardly worth accepting. These five fishing ports, they say, " are the only ports along that shore to " and in which a vessel of any size can approach " or lie," while "the concurrent rights" in Labrador will " operate to the prejudice if not " the extinction of British interests" They draw an alarming picture of "codfish diverted from I "migration" by the enormous "& &ines H and IBulows " of French fishing; they complain of the permission given in the Convention to" take " "herring" and " caplin" as bait; they appeal to the bounty given by the French* Government, 50f. for each mau of the crew when the fish are dried at Newfoundland, and 30f. when the fish are taken to France undried, as giving the French
fisherman an unfair advantage against which the English cannot compete.
We are unable, of course, in the absence of proper local information to decide upon the details involved in such a Convention as this. The exception of the five fishing ports from the line of coast given up to the English may be a great drawback from that concesion for anything we know to the contrary; and we are aware that in such arrangements French diplomacy has before now shown itself more skilful than our own. But the first impre2sions which these complaints from Newfoundland certainly raise is, that what they are reaUy angry with is the fact that the Convention has recognized at all, or to any extent, the French exclusive privilege of fishing on the coast of Newfoundland.
In commenting the other day upon the mur-
In commenting the other day upon the murderous affray on board an American merchant vessel, which was brought before the publio at the Chester Assizes, we felt constrained to admit that the records of our own Merchant Service contained evidence of atrocities almost as shocking as those which had been so repeatedly charged to the account of Transatlantic packet-ships. Our remarks on this occasion called forth a letter from Captain Ronunr M.TuvER, 'which -we published in our impreusion of the 9th inst., and we now give insertion to another communication on the same subject from a correspondent who is content to be knownundertheunassumingtitle of "ASapowNs.7' Captain MEmivrm considered that our aninadversions on the British Merchant Service were more severe than facts would warrant; but his own observations on the general stamp of the seamen engaged and on the insufficient support given to the authority of their officers by law or custom would lead infallibly to the conclusion that such excesses as those complained of must be of probable occurrence. "A SHn'owwER," it will be seen, though not in terms admitting the truth of the charges alleged, abstains from offering any direct contradiction, and implies plainly enough that there is nothing in the general conditions of the service which should render such accusations incredible. On this point, however, we are not concerned to enlarge. We should be but too wel pleased to find that our merchant vessels could be relieved from the imputations advanced; but we spoke upon evidence admitting no question or doubt-the actual records of courts of justice year after year. On this matter our readers are just as well informed as we are, and there cannot, in fact, be any more uncertainty about the perpetration of these crtielties than about the existence of. garotting, or housebrealing, or any other crime. Of course, nobody attaches any such censure to the service as conducted on board the fleets of our great, companies, or the vessels of our largest shipowners, any more than we suppose that ihe scenes exhibited on board the James L. Bogart are paraleled upon the CoLms' line of steamers. The charge is not that all merchant ships are ill-regulated,but that inmanyvessels abominable misrule, and in some the most barbarous tyranny, must be exercised, almost in regular system. We abstain, however, at present from insisting on this branch of the subject, and turn with greater satisfaction to the question of remedy as discussed by our two correspondents.
Both these authorities will be found to concur in opinion that merchant seamen, aa a body, represent a very indifferent class of men, and " A " SmPOw?NE}2 says enough of the treatment they often experience to furnish a conmiderable explanation of the result. Both, again, describe the officers of the service as receiving inadequate recognition in all respects except that of salary. The commander of a foreign-going vessel receives, at a low esimate of the average terms prevailing, 2001. a-year, and in many cases much more, while he has opportunities occasionally, as part-owner. of founding a solid competency. Nor are these advantages to be reached only through tedious or protracted service, for command may be obtained at a comparatively early period of life; and, as a climax to the general contrast instituted between this and other employmets in the mere matter of remuneration, it is stated that the pay of an able seaman, allowing for his berth and rations, is eaual to the salary of a curate. But at this point the advantages of the service appear to end. The officers have no corporate or professional rank, position, or costume; they are not efficiently supported by law, and they are left, under difficult circumstances, and with an intractable class of seamen, to maintain authority, enforce discipline, and preserve the lives and property under their charge by mere personal influence alone.
Towards the reform desirable in these conditions our correspondents offer suggestions which, though apparently distinct, will be found based on the same assumptions and proceeding on the same convictions. Captain MXTHvEb- recommended the adoption of a national uniform for the whole Merchant Service, and the establishment of a general recognized authority on the quarterdeck ofI;esNy vessel, large or small. "A SniPowNEien asks for an increased amount of social consideration, and for the elevation of the officer's calling to the dignity of a regular profession, " carrying "with it the distinctive appeUation of 'gentlemau."'
Surely," says he, " the duties a commander of "a passenger sbip is caUed upon to perform are "of as high an order as those of the solicitor or "apothecary." Now, upon this suggestion we can only remark that gentlemen are not to be manufactured by arbitrary ordinance. It does not depend upon statute law whether a particular individual is or is not received in that capacity to which at the present day all educated persons very properly aspire. If an officer in the Merchant Service is in the enjoyment of a respectable income, if he is a man of good information, good manners, and even half those general qualifications which " A Sarrowmmn" thinks he should possess, there is certainly nothing in his avocation which will deprive him of the reception due to a gentleman in any society he may find. Professions do not take precedence by patent. An attorney, it is true, is legally a " gentleman," but his title on this score will do him little good if his intrinsic deserts be not found to correspond. Apothecaries and surgeons were originally simple tradesmen, and the latter, indeed, were incorporated as barbers. If they enjoy a higher consideration than the followers of other pursuits it is because their general education and manners have combined to command it. In all questions of this sort the result rests with the man himself. Give any person money enough to place him above need, add the accessories of education and address, and there is no need of any fiat from fashion or statute to dub him a gentleman. If with these qualifications he reallycombines those habits of thought and carriage which are generated by the practice of responsibility, selfconfidence, and command, it must be hard indeed if he cannot hold his own in any company the kingdom can furnish.
At the same time, however, that we unhesitatingly make these assertions, we are not insensible to the effects producible by the collective influences Of a profession. The feeling known as esp-it de corp will often place restraints upon a man's personal disposition, and it is not to be denied that the distinction attaching to any service universally recognized as honourablo facilitates the acquirement of social position even though it may not be indispeoiable to such an end. For ourselves, we are inclined to attach weight to the suggestion of Captain
MrrHvxr, that the adoption of some general uniform would carry consequence to the profeseon it denoted. Costume always aidc at least the formation of first impressions, and it hu actully been found in more than one instance that the introduction of a distinguishing uniform has conduced to the general elevation o-' the class to which it wax assigned. If the coat is an honourable one a man is careful not to disgrace it, and a respect for his profession becomes added to his respect for himself. The object aimed at both in this and "A " SnrPowVNERS" suggestions is the same-that is to say, the consolidation of the Merchant Service into a more visible and accepted profemion, receiving a greater share of general consideration, and carrying with it at the same time a greater amount of general responsibility.
Nobody can doubt the e.xpediency of such a reform, and the further recommendations of "A 64 SEmPOwVRB on behalf of the eamen are very analogous to those offered on behalf of the offices. As the latter should be elevated in their own and others' opinions, so the former should be attached to the serice not merely by pay, but by good and inndly treatment; and it is urged that the adequacy of the material provisions in this respect might be fairly insured by legislative supervision. We can only trust that some steps may be taken to promote these results in a service so important. The lives and treasure now constantly intrusted to merchant ships constitute a charge of almost incredible magnitude. Our emigration, even on its present reduced scale, is proceeding at the rate of nearly 500 a-day, while, as to treasure, it was only the other morning that we reported the arrival of three vessels bringing between them the value of 525,0001. in gold and 400,0001. in tea and l}k That the conductors of such a commerc should both possess due qualifications and be rewarded with due acknowledgments is too obvious a proposition to need argiument, and if the attention now drawn to the subject should lead to the attainment of these ends the discussion will have borne ample fruit.

New Reading-Room At The British Museum.-
NYW READING-1ROOM AT THE BRITLSHI MUgEumLWe understand from good authority that the present reading-rooms of the British Museum will not be used for the purposes of study after the 30th inst. During the first week in May, when the Museum will be closed as usual, the library of reference will be removed from ita present locality to the new reading-room; and, in order to avoid unnecessary interruption while this operation is being carried on, no strangers wiU be admitted to the libraries for any purpose whatever, On the 8th of May the new reading-room will be thrown open to the public generally, who wil be allowed to visit it freelyuntil the 16th, after which day it will be devoted exclusively to the use of the readers. This arrangement will involve the loss of a few days to students, but it is anticipated that it wiU afford much gratification to multitudes who would etherwise have little chance of seeing a building, of which competent judges say the nation ought to be proud. As the entrance to the new reading-room is through the front hall, it will be necessary that readers should bring their tickets of admission with them until tAey have become known to the doorkeepers.
DREADFtIL RAIWAY AccmzwTr.-On Monday evening, shortly after the 5.50 expresa train from the north arrived at Stafford, a melancholy accident happened to one of the men in the service of the London And North.Western Railway Company, whereby his head was completely severed from his body. The unfortunate mans name Was William M'Cabe, a person of considerable engineering skill, and who, in consequence of his ability, and the loss, through au accident on the line 16 years aRD, of one of his legs, had for many years been intrasted with the management of the engine-shed at the station. On Monday evening, immediately after the north express had passed the bridge where the Shropshire Union Railway runs into the main line, an engine drawing a number of empty ballast waggons arrived at the spot and, after passing the junction of the lines, stopped to put down a mau who had had his hand smashed near Norton Bridge Station, and who was conveyed through New Town to the infirmary at Stafford. Just at this moment MI'Cabe, who had but a few minutes previouly left his home, was standing on the line noticing a trainshunting into a siding, and about 10 yards in front of the ballast train, when the engine of the latter train was again put in motion for the purpose of proceeding towards the station, which M'Cabe observed iust before it reached him; but in attempting to make his escape the outside of the huffer of the engine caught him, and knocked him back
again into the "four-foot" space between the rails, when he fe)l with his head across the rail. The wheel of the engine pushed him before it a snort distanoe, and then pasing over his neck, decapitated him. His son, a very steady young man, also employed by the company, witnessed the sickening spectacle, and pulling oft his coat, threw it over the lifeless head of his parent, which was carried forward a distance of five or six yards As speedily as possible the mangled body of the deceased wus conveyed to an adjoining pabliohonse, where it awaits the isse of a coroner's inquisition. 31'Cabe was well k-nown and respected by all the authorities and officials on the line. He leaves a widow and sixc children.-hfan4cr Guardian1.
Grrxza ouT oF RAILWAY CAiuTrAGS-At the county sessions at Ashton, on Saturday, Alfred Swann, of Preston, overlooker, was charged with this offence on the Londou and North.Western Railway, at Denton. It seems that when the train arrived at Denton on Thursday night -week the defendant was told thar the next station Aas Stockport, but, being intexi cated, he believed be had arrived at Stockport, and, though the train was in motion and a porter endeavoured to prevent his alghting, he got out of the carriage and endeavoured to pull a companion with him, during which he and the porter fell on the floor. Fortunately, the stationmaster raw the whole transaction, and prevented the train going at ste usual speed, and ultimately stopped it, or the porter and the defendant might have been seriously hurt or kiUled. The defendant was fined lOs. and costs. A similar case is reported at Wolveriatupton, where, at the borough policecourt, on Monday, John Donald, a shingler from Westbromwich, was charged by the Great Western stationmaster with attempting to defraud the company, and also with endangering his life by getting out of one of the carriages when in motion. It appeared that on Sunday evening the defendant had taken a third-class ticket at Birmingham for Westbromwich; he was drunk, and, instead of getting into a third-class carriage, he got into a first and fell asleep. He did not leave the train at Weatbromwicb, as he should have done, and, on collecting the tickets at Priestfields, the guard found him still asleep in the carriage. The guard bad great difficulty in awaking him and getting his ticket from him, and, having at length managed to do so, he locked him in the carriagefor safecustodytoVolverhampton.When the train arrived there he was astonished to find tbe carriage empty, and on inquiry it turned out that the defendant, although drank, bad got out at the window of the carrie, and was attempting to pass along the steps of the coches, when he was perceived and forcibly pulled in by the occupants of the next compartment. There were several bridges and a tunnel between Priestfields and Wolverhampton, and it is almost miraculous that the man was not killed. The magistrates ordered him to pay 40s and costs, and, not having the means of doing so, he was removed in custody.

Election of Scottish Representative Peers.
ELECTION of SCOTTISH PRBPRBSENTA TIVE
PEERS.
The election of 16 Peers to represent Scotland in the ensu. ing Parliament took place on Tuesdaywithin the Picture Gallery of Holyrood-house. There ws an Immense and brilliant aem blage of spectators, the whole of the long and antique saloon being crowded and temporary galeries being erected at either end to make the ceremony at least Tisible from the extremes of the hall. In accordance with eustom the Lord Provost and Magistrates of Edinburgh attended in their robes of offlce and occupied sats near the Peers' table. They were attended by their usual clvil
retinue. The Deans of the Chapel Royal, Principal Lee, and Professor R. Lee, of Edinburgh University, attended to officiats. There were present to conduct the proceedingsin the absenoe of the Marquis of Dalhousie, Lord Clerk Register, Messrs. John Russell and John X Lindsay, Principal Clerks of Session; also George Brown Robertson, Deputy Keeper of the Records of Scotland.
Principal Lee opened the proceedings with prayer.
Mr. John Rusell read the Royal proclamation appointing the election, as also a certificate that the proclamation had been read at the Cross of Edinburgh. A commission was also read from the Marquis of Dalhousie, nominating the four principal clerks of session, or any two of them, to officiate in his stead as returning officers at the election.
Mr. J. M. Lindsay read the roll of the peerage of Scotland as it existed at the period of the Union, commencing with the Prince of Wales, as Duke of Rothesay, and in. eluding numerous dormant, extinct, and merged peer. ages.
The following 18 peers answered to their names :-The Duke of Atholl, the Duke of Montrose, the Marquis of Tweeddale, the Marquis of Lothian, the Earl of Morton, the Earl of Perth, the Earl of Lauderdale, the Earl of Wemyss and March, the Earl of Airlie, the Ea-l of Leven and Melville, the Earl of Elintore, the Earl of Seafield, Viscount Strathallan, Lord Blantyre, Lord ColviUe of Culross, Lord Belhaven and Stenton, Lord RobO, and Lord Polwarth. The oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration were administered to and subscribed by these peers.
Their votes were then called for by signed lists, which each peer first read and then handed in to the clerks. All of the lists contained the names of the 16 peers who representedScotland intheHouseof Lords inthe lastParliamentnamely, the Marquis of Tweeddale, the Earl of Morton, the Eatl of Home, the Earl of StratSm ore, the Earl of Airlie, the Earl of Leven and Melville, the Earl of Selkirk, the Earl of Orkney, the Earl of Seafield, Viscount Strathallan, Lord Gray, Lord Sinclair, Lord Elphinstone, Lord ColviUe of Culross, Lord Blantyre, and Lord Polwarth.
Signed lists were handed in duly attested by subscription to the usual oaths from the folowing 1a peers:-The Dluke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, the Duke of Lennox (Ricnmond), the Earl of Crawford, the Earl of Eglinton, the Earl of Cassillis (Marquis of Ailsa), the Earl of Home, the Earl of Haddington, the Earl of Galloway, the Earl of Aberdeen, Lord Saltoun, Lord Gray, Lord (Earl of) Cath. cart, Lord Sinclair, Lord Cranstoun, and Lord Forrester. All these noblemen voted for the same 16 Peers.
The Earl oi Buchan sent a proxy, which was invalid, being unaccompLnied by the usual oaths; and the Earl (larquis) of Abercorn, the Earl of Orkney, the Earl of Stsir, and Lord Somerville also sent signed lists in favour of the former 16 Peers, which were rejected, owing to the same informality. A claim to vote in the election had been lodged with the Lord Clerk Register by a person named Dr. Thomas Drummond, under the title of Earl of Perth, but in terms of the late Act of Parliament, which restored the title in the person of another clmant, the clerks refused to receive his vote.
MIr. Russell then declared the 16 Peers already named dulY returned to serve in the ensuing Parliament, and signed and sealed the return in the customary form.
Dr. R. Lee then closed the meeting with prayer. The assemblage then dispersed.
During the forenoon the band of the 34th Regiment performed within the inner quadrangle of the Palace, and a guard of honour of the same regiment was drawn up out. aide the gate.

Tim LATE Sroir.-During the storm which broke over the West Riding of Yorkshire on Friday last, as already reported in The Timm, the house of Mr. T. P. Rain-den, of Pontefract, was struck by the electri fluid, which divided into two currents, one passing down the chinmey and striking Mr. Raamsden, who was standing near the fire, and also his daughter, *ho was seated a short distnce from him. Mr. Raunsden was not much injured, but his daughter was rostrxted with great violence, rendered blind and insensiblo, and lost the nse of her lower extremities. She is now slowly recovering from the effects pf the shook. Another person and a child who were sitting Ln the maine room escaped uninjured. The second current of electricity pased down one side of the house, entering one of the rooms and passing ouit of the wmdow down a fallpipe, the bottom of which was sbattered to pieees, near an iron holdfast At this point the electric fluid re-entered the house, struck a cheffonier in one of the lower roomn, tore one of the doors from its hinge., and broke it, togeiher with a quantity of glAEs and other articles. The storm took a south-eauterly direction, and burst with eorn. siderable violence between Bawtry and Retford ins the afternoon of the day above-mentioned. D -i the

The clumsy coalition between Major Masy, the sham Liberal, and the O'Donoghue having been clawed to pieces, and as the two kings of Brentford are no longer smelling at the same rose, Tipperary was spared tho perils of a contest which promised weeks ago to be carried oat on the old priniple of the bludgeon and brickbat. Mr. Waldron, the new member, is a moderate Roman Catholic, and reported to be a man of good common sense, and, as a barrister, he enters Parliament free from all suspicion of self-aggrandisement by being the inheritor of extensve estates in more than one Irish county. Of the capacity of the O'Donoghue for the business of the House of Commons but little is known, his remarkably brief career in the old Parliament affording no scope for the display of whatever amount of ability he may be possessed of. He is, howover. a Tery youMg man, and has plent;v of time before him. This election makes no alteration in the balance of parties. After the declration of the High Sheriff Mr. Waidron took occasion to state, in a rather marked manner, that he would follow no leader, but would maintain his own independence. lis colleague might submit to the leadership of Mr. George Moore, but he (Mr. Waldron) would not. Whereupon, the O'Don hue begged to ask Mr. Waldron if he meant by his concluding remarks that it was his (the O'Donoghue's) intention to submit blindly to the leadership of Mr. Moore or any other man?
Mr. Waldron.-I refer the hon. gentleman to his organ, the Nation, which stated that I should not sit for Tipperary unless I agreed to follow Mr. Moore. (Applause.)
The O'Donoghue.-Then the hon. gentleman only refera mi to the Nation. What bave I to say to the NatIon? (Cheering.)
The veteran Liberal Colonel Henry White, after a long absence from public life, and Colonel Grsville have succeeded in Longtord, the Hon. Captain Forbes, although late in the field, making a fair fight for oue of the seats. There, as in Galway and KEkenny, the choice of the electors fell upon the Protestant candidates, to the prejudice even of so respectable a Roman Catholc as Mr. Henry George Hughes, the Irish Solicitor-General of the last Russell Ministry, who appears to have been rather shabbily treated by the local Liberal club and some of the Roman Catholic clergy.
The struggle in Clare ha3 resulted in ths return of Lord Francis Conynghiam and Mr. Macnamara Calcutt. General Sir John F. Fitzgerald, the late member, ran the latter gentleman a close race for the seat. Why the gallant General!s claims were rejected on the present occason is a mystery wholly inexphcable to all uninitiated in the* masonry of independent opposition.

My dear Sir,-I cannot forego this opportunity of expressing to you my thanks for the manner in which, by your letter in The Tires of April 8, you have defeated the attempt which has been made to connect my name 'with the late election at Huddersfield.
It gives me great pleasure to receive the testimony of a gentleman taking so prominent a part as you have done on Mr. Cobden's behalf, to the satisfactory manner in which my agents have carried out'the instructions which I gave them, to abstain from aU interference whatever in matters connected with the Huddersfield election.
I am, my dear Sir, yours faithfully,

MR. COBDEN A.I D THE HuDDERsFrsLD ELECTION. -The following letter from Mr. Cobden to the chairman of his committee in Huddersfield appears in the Led,3eJe-- cury :-" Midhurst, April 2, 1857.-My dear Sir,-I seize the first moment after my return home to fulfil the agreeable duty of tendering to you, and through you to my committee and a large body of the electors, my warmest thanks for the support with which I was honoured during the late contested election. The circumstances which preceded the dissolution of Parliament, and which imparted to it somewhat of the character of a surprise, precluded the possibility of your making an accurate estimate of the probable issue of a coutest for Huddersfield, and my first step was unavoidably, to a great extent, a leap in the dark. No one can, therefore, be fairly held responsible for a miscalculation of the chanoes of success, nor does the result of the election afford Any criterion of the strength of parties for the future. I bave only to assure my frieeds that I have appreciated their kind and courageous efforts all the more highiy s I have known that they were, from the first, embarked in an adverse struggle. To the non-electors, who afforded me all the support which the constitation allows them to give, I beg to offer my warmest acknowledgments. And with my best wishes for the prosperity and happiness of all classes and parties in your borough, I remain, my dear Sir, faithfully yours, RICIUtBD COBDDE. - W. Willans, Esq., Chairman of Committee."
MU1tDER AT COLLIieGHA}af.-It was stated in The Tinwes a few days ago that a retired farmer named Joseph Hodson, living at South Collingham, near Newark, had en found dead in a chair in his house on the preceding Sunday under circumstances which left little doubt that he had been poisoned. Since then two lengthened inquiries into the facts of the case have been made by Mr. W. Newton, coroner, and a respectable jury. It wiUlbe remembered that on the Wednesday prior to the death of the deceased a boy left a parcel contininga mincepie at the Queen's Head Inn, Newarl, to be taken to the deceased by the Collingham carrier, but that, in consequence of this man having left before the package arrived, it was detained till the following Saturday, and then placed in the hands of the carrier, who took it to South CollinCham, but, it now appears, did not himself deliver it, but give it to a lad whom he was in the habit of employing to carry small parcels, and by whom it was conveyed to the house of the deceased, but he not being at home, it was left at the house of Hodson's nephew Richard, who lives a short distance off. The wife of the latter took it to the old man's house on Saturday night and left it in his possession. Oa the following morning he was found sitting near the table quite dead, a portion of the pie being left on the table, and the room bearing unmistakeable proofs of the deceased having suffered .severely from vomiting and diarrhbsa shortly before death. The contents of the stomach and the romains of the pie were analyzed by Dr. Ransome, of Nottingham, and both were found to contain arsenic. Sophia, the wife of Richard Hodson, was proved to have bought an onnce of arsenio at the shop of Mr. W. Postill, at Newark, on the 27th of December last. Hannah loUis, tha motherof Richardl Bodson'swife, hasseveral children, and among them a boy, Henry, whom some of the witnessea declared to be like the boy they saw gototheQueen'saHead with theabove-named parcel,and It wasp roved that his mother had told this boy that if any inquiries were made about his taking a parcel to the Queen's Head he was to say he Inew nothing about it. When the Saperintendent of Police apprehended Richard Eodson on the charge of murdering his nucle the prisoner said, " The reason you .uspicloned me is because I looked so sharp after the WMll. I shold not have gone so soon to Mr. Smith, but I was advised to do so. I baTe not roisoned him, and if my wife has I know nothin aZt it. I have known her so long I do not think she wolddo a iob of that sort." A witness named Thomas Beet dopowed tat on the Tuesday after the deceased's doath he had some conversation with Richard Hodson, wbo told him that Mr. Torton bad advised him to take the minoepie found in the deccsed's house and give it to kis children, but that a. thought had croswed his mind th3.t he would have nothin to do with it.

PARIS, As'anL i4, 6 zp.
Private letters from Madrid of the 10th inst. state that Lord Evowden, in concert 'with the Marquis de Turgot, is doing all that mortal can do to prevent hostilities from breaking out between Spain and Mexico, as, from the latest and surest information, it is ascertained that there is a plan of the United States to make a diversion on Cuba in the event of a war. It is right to state that M. Pidal, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, evinces great anxiety to come to an arrangement, and that he is perfeedy moderate in his views aud language. The difficulty, however, which the English and French Ministers atMadrid havetocontendwith is,that Senor Lafragua,nowinParir,,wMnotproceedtoMadridwith- out the asaurance of being received officially, and presented to the Queen as formal representative of a country where her subjects have been murdered en masse, without any real punishment being yet inf'icted for these sanguinary acts. The official reception of the Mexican Envoy appears, under such circumstances, impossible; and if his instructions allow him any latitude or discretion on the subject, it is on him that all Europe will fix the terrible responsibility of the blood that may be shed, as well as of the political complications that may occur hereafter. I have good reason to believe that the Spanish Government would have received hin at Madrid kindlv, listened to him patiently, and, if any satisfaction sufficient in the judgment of moderate and impartial men were offered, it is very probable he would at a later period be acknowledged m his official capacity. No Government that has the smallest pretension to civilization, or sets anyvalueon its relations with foreign States, could for a moment refuse to accede to the demands of Spain. The Government that will not do so makes common cause with the murderers it protects. Its participation in their guilt ought to place it under the ban of every State, for if such deeds were allowed to pass with impunity no stranger could trust his life or property in Mexico. 'What has happened to the subjects of Queen Isabella to-day may, be the fate of the English er French to-morrow, and the sooner all intercourse is broken off between the Mexican Government and the States of Europe the better. Some people suspect that these murders were not perpetrated merely from wanton cruelty, but that they were meant to aggravate the differences betwveen Spain and Mexico, and facilitate another invasion of Cuba. The affair is one of the utmost Importance.
The Conference on the question of Neuchbtel did not sit to-day, but will probably do so in a day or two. Moreover, it is expected that the affair will be brought to a conclusion in the course of the present week. I fear I cannot go the length of saying that the conclusion will be satisfactory, at least so far as!Switzerland is concerned. The Swiss and Prumsian Pienipotentiaries have received all the instructions they are likely to receive, and the delay which has elapsed since the Conference met last is not owing to their waiting for further orders, as has been erroneously asserted. At the last sitting it was evident that there was but little chance of Dr. Kern and M. de Hatzfeldt agreeing. The latter would accept nothing less than he then demanded, and the former would concede nothing more. Each said his last word, and the proceedings came to a dead lock. In this emergency the other representatives resolved that it was useless to confer with either the Swiss or the Prussian, and they tried to arrange the matter among themselves. They have accordingly met several times during the interval, without, of course, M. de Ratzfeldt or Dr. Kern, to prepare the draught of a convention, which they will oblige the contending parties to accept. The draught is, I believe, prepared, or very nearly 6o, and will be proposed to them at the next meeting, which will be ab grad complet. The draught may undergo some verbal modification before it is reduced to the form of a convention, but in substance it will not, I believe, be materially altered. If the Swiss and Prussian Plenipotentiaries accept It, well and good; if not, why they must do the beat they can.
It is impossible to deny that this affair has been very badly managed. What has become of Dr. Kern's assurance to the Federal Government that he should settle it to the complete satisfaction of the country, by obtaining the " pure and simple" renunciation of the King of Prussia's sovereignty in three weeks? Bofore that assurance was given a money indemnity would perhaps have been acceded to by the Swiss. The case is now different; instead of its being merely a secondary point, it is one of the great difficulties of Switzerland. The mass of the NIeuchatelois will not for a long time shake off the uneasy feeling that " Prince of Neuchitel " means more than a shadowy title; and that so long as the King of Prussia keeps it there will be always some mental reservation in respect of eventualities. We have bishops isa partib6s who, we may be certain, will never dream of visiting their dioceses, from the certainty that they would be exposed to a speedy alnd unprofitable martyrdom at the hands of their beloved but savage flocks; and they content themselves with doing what St. Patrick is said to have done with the " kingdom" of Kerry, when viewing it from the top of the <'Priest's Leap"-bless them from a distance. But the NeuchAtelois will feel never sure of their independence so long as the King retains a title derived from their canton., and this very fact would be an encouragement to the Royalist faction. Before dropping the subject I may observe, that the statenaents which lately appeared on this matter in the Jrnal des D6bats are, I am assured, very incorrect. There is perbaps but one exception to be made, and that is with reference to the fact of a memoir being prepared by Dr. Kern, and presented to the Plenipotentiaries. According to the Debats the memoir was most ably drawn up, and was so considered by the Plenipotentiaries. Now, I have somue reason for believing that the contrary is the case, and that the paper in question is considered as a poor production, and one that a tyro in diplomacy would hardly have put together. Such, at all events, is the opinion of persons who are competent to judge. Be t as it may, the Neuch.atel question, so far as the Paris Conference is concerned, is drawing to a close. It remains to be seen what they will think of it in Svitzerland. The Swiss may be right or wrong, but I doubt much whether they will be satisfied with the result of the Paris Conferences.
The Moniteur de la Flotte publishes some further details relative to the war in China. The Chinese, it is said, are at present making formidable military preparations, which are not to be despised. Since the attack on Canton the Chinese have executed enormous works on the Peiho, a river which falls into the Yellow Sea, and by which a communication is maintained with Pekin. That river is now barred in 22 different places by dams built of stone, which completely intercept the navigation. These works are regarded as a curiosity. Moreover, the three branches of the Peiho canalized by the Emperor Kia-Kang in 1817 are cut, and the course of one of them, the Hu-ho, has been turned off into the lake of Koho-tohi. When an army invades the Chinese Empire, the principal means of defence is to let the waters of this lake overflow the country. This system of defence, efficacious against an enemy, but most disastrous for the country, was first used against the insurgents in 1852. The city of Pekin is consequently perfectly safe from an attack either by land or sea, and
the Emperor wiLl in any desperate circumnstan ce be protected by the fanaticism of the people, who will stop at no means to destroy the foreigners. A eircum-
stance has lately demonstrated the truth of this fact. The British ships proceeding to Canton have been in the habit of taking fresh water at Whampoa from a small river which falls into the Tchnkiang. It was remarked that the sailors using this water lately have been attacked with colie, and after. a careful investigation it was discovered that the water had been poisoned by the Chinese. They employed for this purpose the trunks of certain trees, which, after being prepared for the oceasion. impart a deadly poison to the water. The Chinese arc naturally malignant, and their waickedness is increased by their fanaticism, which is beyond description. There is but one way to subdue them, and that is to act on their senses, and to terrify them by a display of force and by a maritime de
monstration on a grand cale, such as is about to be accomplished by the British Government. It app , moreover, that some of the wealthiest
mduidaS in the empire propose to revive the great commercial company founded in 1759 by Tsong-Too. These great dignitaries, through peronal interest, are highly favourable to an arrangement with the English, notwithstanding
heir warlike m ifeatiou an, a8 they wre
direct communication with the members of the NuyEo, or Cabinet Council at Pekin,they can bring their influence to bear directly on the Emperor's advisers. The revival of the compan;y founded in 1759 will render it impossible in future for the Chinese Government to violate at vill its treaties with foreigners. The Mfonjteui de lO Flote concludes that an arrangement of the difficulties at present existing between the Chinese and English is perfectly possible. For this purpose the British Government have merely to adopt the only means efflcacious with the Chinese character, which is to make a formidable demonstration on the coast of the C7hinese Empire.
Marshal Randon, Governor-General of Algeria, has just quitted Paris; he embarks on the 20th at Marseilles, on board of the Cacique, for Algiers. Military operations commence next month. Marshal Randon has already received his orders for the concentration of the African troops who are to take part in the expedition. The 2d Foreign Regiment quitted its garrison, Sidi-bel-Abbis, on the 8th for the province of Algiers, and to approach Kabylia. The expeditionary corps under Marshal Randon will be composed of three divisions of infantry, under Generals Renault, M'Mahon, and Youssouf
Cardinal Morlot, Archbishop of Paris, who remained at Tours for the solemnities of Easter, will take possession officially of his new diocese on Thursday next.
It is said that the commission appointed by the Minister of Marine, and of which Vice-Admiral Cecile is President, has reported that the evacuation of the settlement at Cayenne is indispensable, and that the convicts should -be removed to New Caledonia, where a penal settlement is to be founded.
The Minister of the Interior has authorized the city of Colmar to erect a monument to Admiral Bruat, who was born in that town. Marshal Pelissier was likewise bomn at Colmar.
The Minister of Marine has despatched the steam sloop Meteore to the coast of Italy to complete the hydrographic plans undertaken by the French Government some months since. The Meteore will during the present year make plans of the entire coast of the Twro Sicilies.
The Moniteur de la Flotte gives some particulars relating to the British and French possessions on the Western Coast of Africa, which show that the late arrangements concluded between the British and French Governments with respect to those settlements are highly advantageous to both countries. The French possess at Albreda, on the Western Coast of Africa, to the Eouth of Senegal, a small space of ground, about 200 yards square, on the banks of the Gamabia. This little corner, surrounded on all sides by water or by the British possessions, is of no value to France in a commorcial point of view, the British, by virtue of their right of sovereignty preventing all communication between Albreda ana the upper portion of the river, whence arrives the produce of the country. On the other hand, at the same time that the treaty of 1783 secured to France the coast to the north of St. Louis, it reserved to England a right to barter exclusively in the small bay of Portendic. The latter is a desert spot on an arid coast, but when the Moors are at war with the French, as the latter do not purchase their gum, they endeavour to sell it to the English at Portendic. During the last few years the Governor of Senegal has so warmly hunted these Moorish robbers, that they have no other resource but to take refuge in the British possessions. The result wuas, that the French were an impediment to the English at Albreda, and the 3nglish were an impediment to the French at Portendic. By abandoning reciprocally those possessionsothat is, Great Britain renouncing what was reserved to her by the treaty of 1783, and France withdrawing from Albreda-they have accomplished a friendly act, and at the same time one of good policy. The result has been beneficial to the two countries.
A letter from Venice of the 9th inst. informs us that Signor Pisani, who sold the splendid painting by Paul Veronese called " La Tenda di Dario" to the British Government, has been fined 700 000 livres, double the price of the painting, by the civil Lieutenant, the sale having been made without the consent of the Venetian Government. The inhabitants of Venice are by no means displeased at this act of severity, or at the pecuniary loss imposed upon Signor Pisani He had been greatly blamed for having, without any necessity, but merely through cupidity, deprived Venice and his own family of a mnasterpiece.
A letter from Fiorence of the 7th inst. gives the followfing biographical sketeh of Signor Baldasseroni1, Prime Minister of the Grand Duke of Tuscany .
"Si,nor Baldasseroni became minister in the wear 1847, and his first acts were of a reactionary tendency. He next declared himself a reformer aud signed all the liberal decrees of the same year, and likewise the patriotic and anti. Austrian proclamations of the year 1848, until he fell with the Ridoli Ministry, and made way for the Capponi Ministry. After the spontaneous restoration of the constitutional throne by the Grand Duke LeopoldIL, Signor Baldaeseroni resumied his functions, and signed a circular to the Government officers, announoin that the Ministers were determined to defend and preserve against all attacks the constitution based on civil liberty. This circular was dated the 4th of June, 1849, and when the Austrian occupation was blamed by the Constitutionalists he said it would be but tempornry, and that it should not prevent the development of constitutional institutions. When the Grand Duke determined to violate the constitution Signors Mazzeia and Capoquadri resigned their seats in the Cabinet. Signor Baidasseroni reimained, signed the arbitrary decrees of 1852, and tho abolition of the constitution."

VIENNA, APPnL 12.
The Hungarians stdll flatter themselves that im-
portant political concessions will be made while their Majesties are at Pesth, but such will not be the ease, as the Imperial Cabinet is resolved to maintain the present system. Very soon after his armival in Hungary theEmperor will grant a general amnesty to political offenders, and he will also remit certain taxes, as he did while in Italy, but he will not endow the Hungarian Diet with greater powers tha.n those possessed by the LombardoVenetian Congregations. Although Pesth is but 180 English miles from Vienna it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable intelligence relative to what is passing there, but yesterday an opportunity of conversing with persons residing in Hungary presented itself. The information received from my inter_
locutors who are neither Austriasu nor Hungarians, was in substance as follows :-Such vast preparations are being made by the authorities that their Majesties will meet with a very brilliant reception, "if not with a very cordial one." Many of the high nobles are sullen and would fain keep aloof, but they have received such pressing invitations to be present during the various solemnities "that they have no eboice but to accept them." The lower classes of nobles decline to ride n the " banderia," but still their Majesties will have mounted escorts between the different towns, as the different parishes have received orders to clothe and mount a certain number of peasants. The Hungarians are " born riders," and when a Magyar is on a horse's back he has such a chivalrous bearing, that the Imperial visitors will hardly know whether they are sur-
rounded by nobles or by plebeians. The great majority of the communities have been obliged to borrow money at a very high rate of interest in order to defray the expenses of the preparations ordered by the empoloy6s. The peasants are well pleased that they are emancipated, but they complain bitterly of the heavy taxes, which very many of them are unable to pay. " The official world professes to be astonished that the plan for the colonization of Hungary is not carried out ; but it knows, or ought to know, that the onerous tax on real property (the tax is about 33 per cent.) prevents foreigners settling in Austria. Many German peasats who owned land in Hungary have recently sold it, and emigrated to Servia, as they were unable to pay the taxes," When the conversation was at an end the impression left on my mind was, that
Hungary is in a much less thiving conditionthan is here believed. That there cannot, under present circunstances, be any important reduction oI the taxes in this country need hardly be said. The captains of the districts of the " Jazygier" and "OCumanier" have promised to raise their " banderia," which are said to consist of nearly 1,000 horsemen. The Elmperorhaspromised to lay the foundation-stone of the Grosswardein terminus of the Theiss Railroad, and after the ceremony the Directors of the company intend to offer to their Majesties some appropriate souvenir. The Emperor was less satisfied with his reception in Italy than is generally believed. His Majesty, who has a very sharp eye, saw what was popular and what was official enthusiasm, and he did not fail to observe that the latter generally predominated. It has attracted very general observation that the Minister of the Interior has not received the Grand Cross of St. Stephen.
Those persons who have resolved not to speculate in Russiaen railroads will applaud their own judgment when they read the subjoined extract from a letter addressed by the late Count Ficquelmont, -who for many years was Austrian hMinister at St. Petersburg, to the late Marshal Marmont, Duke de Ragusa .-
"There are persons who believe that the construction of railroads would change the face of this country (Russia). by hlinging the places of production and those of exportation nearer to each other. Doubtless railroads wouldlbe hene. ficial for the landed proprietors, but would the profit be in proportion to the expense of constructingand of keepingin repair such railroads? General Destrem, asldlful engineer, and aman who is more competent than any other to give an opinion on everything that concerns Rusia, has clearly proved that the keeping in repair of Rusn railroads will always he too expensive. as the aoiL even in the socalled south, freezes to a depeth of four feet, wvould not the thawv continually throw the rails out of their horizontal position ? Besides, whatlabour and how much noney would be required for repairs that would have to be made at such enormous distances!
T1 can well =nderstand thab sUc. roads %re nmade in countries which are so rich that private companies can undertake to construct them. It is a good method of investing capital, and it besides enables people to travel more economincaly; but is such the case when States must borrow money in order to make them? As the interest on loans necessitates an augmentation of the tases, those who do not travel are obliged to py a part of the expenses of those persons who make use of the railroads. This would be more especially the case in Russa, where the State can alone construct railways. The time which elapsed before the St. Petersburg line was complated proved that bogs are even greater impediments to the construction of railroads than mountain&'
The letter from which the foregoing passages are taken is dated February 14, 1851, and is contained in the ninth volume of the Memoirs of the Duke de Bagusa.
In a pastoral letter which he published a few days sincae the new Prince-Archbishop of Brixen says:--" My beloved, I grasp the crosier at a critical moment. I do not deceire myself-not peace, but war (kampf) Is my lot. The present is the moment for the separation of good from evil. Christianity and anti-Christanity are standing face to face, and the breach between them is daily becoming wider." As in the next sentence the zealous prelate implores his flock to remain "C true Tyrolese and faithful sons of holy Mother Church," itmust be supposed he is of opinion that all nonCatholics are hostile to Christianity !
The Cracow Ozas, which is a very good authority on Russian matters, states that the St. Petersburg Government is rapidly increasing its forces on the Caspian, Aral, and Baikal Seas and on the Amoor. The Polish correspondent of the Augsburg Gazette says in his letter of the 5th inst., " The approaching ccncentration of the corps now in the Governments of Woronesch, Tamboff, Pensa, &c., on the Caspian, is in connexion with events which are gradually developing themselves in Adia."
At 11 o'clock in the night of the 8th the convention between Wurtemberg and the Papal Government was signed at Rome.

TURIN, APRIL ]
The Empress Dowager of Rusia and the Grand Duke Constantine were to leave Nice this evening for Rome, and so wffil end this famous Council, which appears to have caused so much tribulation in different parts of Christendom. I am not at liberty, unfortunately, to make public the resolutions adopted by this celebrated Council, but it may be safely affirmed, I think, that the consciences of those who expected to be denounced by it have greatly exaggerated both the language used and the measures discussed, and that they have sought in consequence to communicate their own fears to other seetarians by ascribing a far greater importance to thiassebly than it really desrved.
Piedmontese statesmen and legislators are enjoying their usual week's holydays at Easter, Parlianent having adjourned to Thursday, the 16th. The last Bill passedby the Chamberof Deputies was one for regulating prison discipline, whereby some relaxation was allowed in favour of prisoners under trisl. This modiication of the law was the more necessary as bail is not received here, and prisoners under trial were treated very much the same as prisoners under sentence. This abuse wil now be corrected, and, though no disposition is shown to introduce anything like our law of haabeas corpus as yet, it may be hoped that this instalment towards personal freedom may be accepted as a good earnest of a more perfect measure at some not distant period.
One of the first measures which wil be brought before the Chamber of Deputies after the holydays will be the Bill for removing the head-quarters of the Sardinian navy from Genoa to Spezzia. The commission named by the Chamber is reported to be favourable to the scheme in the majority, but much opposition is anticipated in both Houses, because the presumed personal interests of Genoese proprietors and the prejudices of the clerical party will be united to oppose what all scientific men, military and civil, have recommended, and what aU the merchants of Genoa must most ardently desire in order to make their port a first-rate commercial harbour.
It is said that the Governmnent intends proposi
a reform of the National Guard, so as to organize it somewhat on the principle of the Prussian Landwehr and Landsturm. Such a plan would be agreeable to the Radical party, most likely, as M. Valerio, one of its leading members, strongly urged some such measure on Government during the debate on the Alessandria fortifications, and it would probably be supported by the clerical party, as they regard the National Guard, as atpresent constituted, with a most unfavourable eye. A change of this sort would be attended with very great, if not insurmountable, difficulties in any other country, where the vote of the people's representatives is the primary essential to the act; but 8o engrafted in all classes in Piedmont and Savoy is the military spirit, that I really believe a change which gave the force a more workinga military character would tend to make the service more popular than it is. The jeralousy that would prompt men elsewhere to resist any measure tending to place the defenders of the country's liberties under more direct influence of the Crown is not felt here, so unbounded is the confidence of the people in the good faith of the Sovereign.
Accounts from Parma state that it was believed the Austrian Government had failed altogether in its attempt to re-entangle the Government of the Duchy in a Custom-house league, and that the latter was likely to decree a Customs tariff on moat liberal principles of unrestricted commerce. On another head, however, the protecting empire had been more successful in its obstructive policy, and the concession for a railway from Piaconza to the Piedmontese frontier at StradeDa-to meet the railways from Turin and Genoa and the ILago Maggiore-was still refused by the Parmesan Government on one frivolous plea or another. Among other excuses adduced, it is said that it would not be courteous on the part of the Parmesan Government to sanction a railway towards Piedmont from a town where there is an Austrian garrison, so long as the present diplomatic rapture between Austria and Sardinia continues. If reasons of this kind are allowed to prevail in impeding a work of almost European importance it is quite time that an appeal should be made to the tribunal of public opinion, and that those Governments which have only an indirect interest in this undertaking should interfere to put a stop to such childish objections. The Duke de Galliera, asPresident of the Central Italian Railway Company,has addressed the International Commission on behalf of the company he repreeents, I understand, on this subject, and his connexion with the company which purchased the Lombardo-Venetiah railways and with some great capitalists may posibly give a weight to his arguments which it Is to be hope the act o his einga Sardinian xub-
ject may not more than counterbalance.
The Eco del Borsa of Milan thu;s laments the
want of activity in railway matters in Lnombaxdy:-
"A year has now passed since the Sovereign s3nction Wus given to the general concession of the Lombardo-Venetira Railways. Once on a time very severe observations were made on the former Administration, which in 20 years had not succeeded in finishing the trunk from Milan to Venice, and which confined itself to taking from a Private comrany therailway from Milan to Como. But,in tratTh.tbe miracles of activity and energy which Wvere atnouneed -ith the nevvsvstem, and the high credit which the shares of this undertahing enjoy on 'Change, havo not yet been verified. We do not speak of the short lin3 from Cawsano to Bergamo, which has been imposed and cannot be allowed to langaish. We shall have it, please God, by the end of the year; but, e.xcept this, there is nothing to be seen of serious works in commencing new lines, and not even a contract heard of with any of our able engineering contractors. It is even commonly reported thatthe surveys of details in Progress on that most interesting line from Milan to Buffa rora (on the Piedmonteso frontier. near Novara) have been suspended, and that the techaical staff employed there have been withdrawn elsewhere. We beheve that the line which hr.3 most chance of being carried on is that called the CasarzaUdine-Nebrezina Iine. But do you know where it goes to? To the lllyrian frontier."

THE STATE OF NAPLES.
(XROX OUR OWN ooanvSoPODmT.)
NAPLES, ARMI 9.
A suspension for the moment of aU speculations as to diplomatic arrangements permits me to say one word on that gigantic iniquity-the police of Naples. .1 advert to it the more willingly now, because two or three other instances of its crimes have just been added to my experience. According to the statement of the latest budget which I have, said to be of 1856, the Director of Police receives 3,600 ducats a-year the prefect 3,000 ducats; to secret expenses are devoted 14,400 ducats, and the sum total of the expenditure for the maintenance of the Ministry and the Prefecture of Police amounts to 197,662 ducats.
Such is the very inadequate sum which is devoted to the maintenance of a force which is omnipresent. I am treading on rather uncertain ground when I speak of the pay which the 'underlings, that is, which policemen receive; but there are gradations in ra;nk and in pay, beginning with the aspirant or supernumerary, who, Â£ am told, rec:eives a ducat or 3s. 64. a-month, up to the man who receives six or seven ducats a-month, or about 8d. or 10d. a-day. A policeman must live as well as any other Neapolitan employe, and he will, and he does so, by the same means-plunder, under the name of lueri, treachery and oppression. It is useless to deny the assertion; a cloud of witnesses and of facts might be brought forward in proof of its truth, and so well known and universally admitted are they that men of all parties would agree in lamenting their existence. I cite one or two as specimens. Within the last fortnight, a " suspect," one of the many thousands who are under the surveillance of the police, consulted a friend almost in these words, " I am watched by such a policeman; every now and then he comes to me and menaces me with some denunciation if I do not give him two or three piastres. I have already given him 40 piastres, but I cannot continue it, for I am poor. What must I do?" "I do not know what to advise," was the reply, "for you are threatened with one of two evilsimprisonment, or continual plunder."
The case of Baron -is another in point who in this way was robbed of 2,000 ducats. I cite these two instances as illustrations only; and, so far from being individual cases, they form part of a system, a gigantic system of corruption, cruelty,and plunder. It acts in two ways, not only on those who have bad the misfortune to fall under suspicion, or under the action, of the law, but on those who are innocent of all offence provided theyhavemoney. Theseareatreasury for the police, and a treasury which is sure to be weU drawn upon. Calumnies are invented, and secret denunciations made, and, what is more, encouraged and received, and then begins the work of insinuated compromises and of ruin. These things, it is fearlessly asserted, are of continual occurrence. Not a man in the streets who has not some case of the kind to narrate, and very few are they, perhaps, who have not in some way or ether been muloted by the guardians of order-the upholders of things as they are. The Government, too, is much mistaken if it imagines that it is at all times weU served. The poor man vill not smell his money any more than did Vespasian, and will take it from any hand that offers it. Thus I cannot doubt of many instances in which a piastre has been enough to buy one of these informers, and to save some poor fellow from persecution. Row is it, too, that almost every week placards are affixed to the walls, and tricoloured cards scattered about by thousands in the streets, the churches, and theatres? While, therefore, the Government is il-served by its own officers when interest prompts it society is oppressed and plundered. Such being the facts, what are the causes of them? First, the starvation pay of every member of tho police, from the highest to the lowest ' speaking after the manner of the world, the employds in any one public office in Naples cannot afford to be honest. They must eat and drink, and be clothed; and the plunder which was first entered upon to supply necessities is continued to feed luxuries. Secondly, another great cause of the evils of the police system is the making the test for service a political test. This great mistake is committed in every branch of the public administration. The man who has the stain of Liberalism upon him is cashiered, however moderate, however wel instructed or fitted for office, while the hypocrite or the ruffian, who wiU shout with a loud voice Viva Ferdi7m&do II.. whatever or whoever hs may be, is patronized and protected. Numerous and most luminous instances of eadA class might be presented. The Government, therefore, which purchases its supporters becomes the slave of its slaves, it dares not institute too strict an inquiry into abuses; it must allow a certain license, it is in the position of a general who has entered a besieged town, who, in order to keep his soldiery in order, must not see their excesses. There are many honest Royalists with whom I have spoken on these subjects who invariably reply " But the King knows nothing of all this." Will that thought maKe extortion or oppression more tolerable to the sufferer? And does not that admitted ignorance constitute the strongest argument against a system of government which can permit such abuses ? Others tell me that a change in the personle of the police is meditated. So I have been told for some months. In the same way promises have been made enough to part the whole kingdom. Still the same wretchedlook-ing, ill-paid ruffians wander through our streets under the name of policemen, little distinguishable from the hosts of disgusting beggars who literallyblock up your path and prevent your egress from any shop in the Toledo. I have dwelt at some length on this subject, for the government of this country is now entirely in the hands of the police. The causes of its abuses I have pointed out are, after all, only effects. All the servants of the State must be iU paid so long as an army of 100,000 men is kept up, and a large army is a necessity of bad, illegal, and unpopular government. So is it with a political test; it is the necessity of a Government which oppresses and alienates the great proportion of its subjects. Party men may boast of the finan-
cia prosperity of the country, but that pro-
sperity is only seeming, and the semblance of it is purchased by corrupt administration and public robbery. There is but one remedy for al the evils of the country, and that is a change in the Government itself, by introducing the popular element ancd permitting a free press with a stringent law.
Official despatches from Sicily confirm what I have already told you of a work hostle to England having been distributed by this Government in Sicily. They announce that it was distributed aU over the island, except at Messina and Palermo, by order of the Neapolitan Government. I think this shows bad feeling towards England. The British anad French Consuls communicated the same to their Ministers at Rome. The whole of the Provincial Commission hasnot left Naples yet ; but, to use the words of one of the members, " Why are we sent ? The Government knows everything before we start," The ex-King of Bavaria has left for Palermo.
The Duo d'lAumale, on his recent visit, drew consideraIble sums of money from Rothschild for the purchase of property in Palermo.
The Centaur, Captain Clifford, has just come in from Malta, and Captain Farquhar, with the Malacca, has been ordered home, to be paid off. I feel it due to Captain Farqnhar to state that in the very delicate circumstances in which he has been placed he has acted with so much prudence, mainess, and temper as to conciliate universal esteem and respect, and give rise to
. very general regret at hi5 recall.

Escape From The Colchester Borough Gaol.-
ESCAPE FROm TnE CoLcHEsm u BonOuct GAoTL.- On Sunday morning considerable bustle and consternation took place in the town in consequence of the extraordinary ewcape from the borough gaol of the prisoners George Partridge and James Greengrass, two members of the London swell mob, who were romanded on a charge of being concerned instealing a canvass purse, containing between 51. and 61., from the tiU in the shop of Mr. George Cant, fruiterer, Wyre-street, on Thursday week. The Mayor gave strict orders to the gaoler to keep the prisoners separately, and not allow them to hold any communication with each other. They were accordingly kept in different cells, but, complaining of want of airing, Mr. Harvey, the gaoler, released them both from the ceUs for that purpose about l0 ininutes past 6 o'clock on Sanday evening, and allowed them to walk in the large yard together. Shortly afterwards Mr. Harvey, hearing a noise, found it to proceed from a deserter and a boy, prisoners in the cells, who exclaimed, " Them two feUows are off!" meaning Partridge and Greengrass, whom they heard scaling the high waaUs of the gaol. Information was given to the police, who, upon going round to St. Ranwald's churchyard, in Angel-lane, behind the Borough Gaol, discovered Partridge resting behind a tombstone. He appeared to be sufferling as if stunned from a fall, and was immediately conveyed back to the gaol. His companion, Greengrass, had efiectually made his escape, for, although the borough police were despatched in all directions, and mnany of the inhabitants were actively searching here and there, he has not since been seen or heard of. Mr. Turner, assistant to Mfr. Nnnn, surgeon to the Borough Gaol, was called in to Partridge, whose head and face were bruised, and arm much swoUen from his fall. On examination it was discovered that tbe prisoners had made their escape from the gaol in a most daring and extraordinary manner. Partridge, a rather tall and muscular young man, had, it appears, pushed Greengrass, a smaU but very active young feUow, up the high perpendicular door of a dustbin, over which hung a revolving chevanx de frise, on to which he somehow suspended himself, From this height of at least 12 feet he was enabled to pnU up his companion Partridge, and they both got over some lattice brickwork on the top of a high wall. which cleared tbem of the gaol by admitting them to the roof of the adjacent Blue Boar publiehouse, Angel-lane, whence they slid down the tiles and feU about 12 feet into St. Runwald's churchyard. Greengrass, being light and active, escaped, it is supposod, without-injury, but Partridge, who was a taller and much heavier man. injured himself in the manner described,which preventedfurther emcape, otherwise, asheafterwards said, ' he shonld have been off." Superintendent Dunn, by desire of the Mayor, was in London on Thursdlay and Friday, and succeeded in ascertaining that the prisoners belonged to a gang of the most expert swellmobsmcen in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, Kingsland, and Haggerstone. The superintendent also discovered that the woman to whom Greenerass directed a letter since his incarceration in the Borough Gaol was a notorious prostitute. Mr. Dunn put himself in communication with the police of the metropolis of that locality, and has no doubt that daring this week he shall be able to gain the whole of prisoners' antecedents. Although their escape from gaol undoubtedly detracts from the merit of their original capture, it is fully expected that Greengrass will soon be retaken, as his escape has been telegraphed to London, and every nook and corner of tais town and ne;ghbourbood is under strict police surveilance. Yesterday (Monday) tho prisoner Partridge was placed at the bar before the Mayor and Mr. J. Mann, at the Townball, when he apuesred extremely crestfallen at his capture, 3uperintendent Dunn handed to the Mayor a letter he had
-eceived from the police authorities at Cardiff, who denied ali knowledge of the prisoner, who had previously stated that he came from th:t town. The evidence of the pro. secutor and witnesses was now read over to the prisoner, who was committed for trial at the ncext borough sessions The prisoner denied all knowledge of Greengrass, and asked to be permitted an interview with his wife in attendance, which was granted him. He was afterwards removed by the 2 o'clock train to Springfield gaol for safe custody to await his trisL-Esae Herald.

ELLIOTT V. INCE .
This suit, relating to the validity of certain disentailing deeds executed by the late Mrs Couming albo,tt one year subsequent to an inquisition of lunacy, declaring her to be of unsound miiind, was disposed of bv hit l orOsnip during the sittings after last term, butt his Lordshipi gave the plaintiffs leave to move for an issue to try whetber Mrs. C lnning vas of unsound mnind at the tillo that bhe executed the deeds in question.
hr. W. MoRis, in the absence of MIr. Bacon, was proceeding to open the motion, when
Mr. CAIRN' iznterposed, and stated that one of the affidavits In support of the motion bad only been filed that morning, and he therefore asked that the motion might stand over to give his client an opportunity of answer-
''he LORD CHANCELLOR, after reprobating in strong ferms the reckless expenditure throughout the suit, and stting that there appeaTed to be an attempt to spend the last shilling of the property in law, ordered the motion to atand over until Saturday next.
BRYAN V. ANSSION.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Hanson -with him) opened this petition on behalf of the Crown to compel the SEropeaa Assurance Company to pay legacy-duty upon a reversionary interest belonging to the late Sir J. M. Doyle on the death of his; wife, and which interest had been assigned by him to tho assurance office in question. It appeared that the fund had been brought into the Court of Chancery and afterwards paid out to the respondents without any dedue. tion by the Accountant-General of the legacy-duty (10 per cent.) pavable on behalf of Sir J. Md. Do,yle.
Mr. Cairns and Mr. Busk were for the office. The case was not concluded.

BROWN V. TIIE STOCKTON AND DARLINGTON RAILWAY
COMIPANY.
Mr. HOLT (with whom was; Mr. Amphlett) moved in this case for an injunction restraining the Stockton and Darlington Railway Company from taking or interfering with any part of the plaintiff's estate, situate on the banks of the Tee, in Durham, until a valid and complete agreement has been executed by the plaintiff and themselves. The Plaintiff is a lunatic, but is represented by his committees, who deny that the land can be wanted by the company for railway purposes. The defendants' case rests upon the compulsory powers of their Act of Parliament, and also upon an agreemaent, which the Master in Lunaoy has declared to he fit and proper, although it has not yet been confirmed by the Court.
Mr. Daniel and Mr. Greene appeared for the company.
The case is at present only partly heard, but will bo resumed at Lincoln's-mn to-raorrow.

CURTO} V. PEIscSOrN.
Mr. MELLOR, Q.C., moved for a rule to show cause why tbere should not be a new trial in this case, on the ground that the damages were excessive. The action was bronuht for a breach of promise of marriage, and was tried before Lord Campbell at Lincoln at the last assizes, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 1001. damages. Itap. peared the plaintiff, a young woman, aged27,Nwasa housemaid, and the defendant was a baker, aged 60. The defendant had courted the plaintiff for some months, but she did not appear to have made up her mind for some timne to have the defendant. At length the cook in the same service got married, and the plaintiff and defendant were invited. The plaintiffendeavoured to avoid the defendant at that meeting, and went so far as to allow a young man to sit on her knee, which in course ended in his kissing her. The plaintiff allowed tLese liberties, as she herself said, " to get shot of the old man." However, the offence was condoned, and the defendant advanced 101. to enable the plaintiff to buy the wedding ring and wedding clothes. The plAintiff subsequently left her place, and when the defendant went over one day to where she was staying he found her out. He took offence at this, and broke off the match. A meeting subsequently took place between the parties, in the presence of one Salmon, and it vas then agreed that the damages which the plaintiff had sustained by the defendant's breach of contracc should be assessed at 25f. The parties having made this agreement, shook hands ; but a brother interfered, and afterwards a lawyer. This action was then brought, and the jury aseessed the damages at 100Z. The learned counsel contended that this amount, under the circumstances, was excessive.
Lord CAMPBIELL said there was no ground whatever for the application. The Court always reluctantly interfered, even where they thought the damages excessive * but in this case, the damages were moderate, considering the conduct of the defendant. The plaintiff was at one time willing to have taken a smaller sum; hut, as she had appealed to the law, the jury had done her no nore than justice in giving her I0?
Rule refused.
TIE QUEEN V. LLOYD.
Mr. WELSBY said that in the absence of the SolicitorGeneral, who was detained by illness, he was instructed, on the partof the Poorl.w Board, to move forarule calling upon William Pritehard Lloyd to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against him for offering to bribe a person to vote in favour of his election as Poor Law auditor of a district in North Wales. Lloyd had filled the office of auditor, but in July, 1856, he had been required to resign. He was re-elected, and again removed. A new election then took place. Ie applied to a Mr. Thomas b
letter, and told him he tliought he could make it worth his while to give him his vote. He subsequently saw him personally, and said if he would name any stliml of money it should be placed in the bands of a third party, and paid over after the election. The facts of the caso having come to the knowledge of the Poor Law Board in January last, the Board directed further inquiries to be made, and on the report of their inspector they had determined that the attempt to procure an office of such importance as thxt of Poor Law auditor by ameans of bribes was so serious an offence as to call for the interposition of this Court.
Lord CAMPBELL said an attempt to bribe was a commoni law misdemeanour, and the learned counsel nmight take a rule~
Rule nisi granted.
PARKEn V. WINLONY.
Mr. UDALL moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant. The action was brought, by a shipowner, for the amount of demurrage due upon a charterparty, dated June 7, 1855, whereby the plain. tiff was bound to take a cargo of coals at Newcastle, and to proceed to Plymouth, but not higher than Tor Point as near as she could safely go, and deliver the goods to the freightor or his pssigns. The vessel arrived on the 21st of June, and reported that she was ready to deliver the cargo the next day. T'he vessel was then ordered to go to Brunswick Wharf at Stonehouse, which was a common wharf for loading colliers, and did so ; but in consequence of the state of the tides it could not get a berth till the 2d of July. The learned judge directed the jury to fiud a verdict for the plaintiff for the nine days' demurrage, but reserved to this Court the decision of the question whether it was bound to go to Brunswick Wharf. 'Ihe learned counsel also contended that the defendant was not at all liable, inasmuch as the charterparty was expressed in the body of it to have been entered into by him as "agent for E. Winlow and Son," though it was signed by him with his own name only, " Willianr Winlow,"
Lord CAMI'IBELL said the learned counsel might take a rule generally.
IRVING 1'. TliE SOUTHI-EASTERN RAILWAY CONIPANY.
Mr. H. HILI, Q.C., moved for a rule to show cause why the verdict found for the defendants in this case should not Ae set aside, and a new trial granted. The action was tried '9efore Mr. Justice Crompton at the last assizes. The learned
judge asked the jury whether the plaintiffha.I executed a certain deed, and they answered in the affinnative. The learned counsel now contended that the finding of that question was not conclusive of tho action. It appeared the action was brought for not paying dividends to tbe plaintiff, a shareholder in the company. She held stock to the amount of 1,20014, and the dividends hadl been duly paid down to the year 1854. In that year sho was induced by a sharebroker at Manchester, named Faulkner, to lend him her s3hares, and an agreement was signed by which the shares were to be retued at one month's notice. Faulkner was to pay her the dividends- and 51. per ecent. Faulkner was called as a witness, and swore that the plaintiff executed a transfer of the shares, but this the plaintiff denied.UThe jury, however, found that she had done so. It appeared that sbe had signed a deed which contained blanks for the name of the transferee, the consideration, the date, &eL and ultimuately those blanks were filled up, with the nae of the party into whose handd it ultimately came previous to its being registered by the company. The learned counsel now contended that nothing passed by such a deed.
MIr. Justice CscoztnToN.-That point was not made at the trial. Had it been so I should have asked the jury wihether the plaintiff had not acted in such a way as to lead tbe company to think it was a good deed
Mr. Justice PRLE said he believed it wvas the common way of passing shares, and asked whether it was quite clear that the deed was not a good deed.
Lord CAMPBELL said that if the plaintiffcould now make the objection it would be a rather formidable one, but she was not now in a position to make it, and the verdict ought not to be disturbed.
The otber Judges concurred. Rule refused.
WVOODCOCK V. TOULMIN AND ANOTHER.
Mr. SA.wyiEi moved for a rule to show cause why the verdict found for the defendant in this case should not be set aside and a new trial granted, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. The defendants were cued as the executors of a Mr. Hone, an attorney, wvho had employed the plaintiff to look over a builder's account for some repars done at the house of a Mrs. Robinson, in EBarley-street. A suggestion wras thrown out at the trial that htr. Hone aced merely as MIrs. Robinson's agent, and this induced the jery to fiad for the defendants.
Mr. Justice ERLE said that was so, but there was evidence to showv that Ho0ne said he wvould pay the bilL
h-. SATWYE, stid the plaintiff had seea 3ir. Hose aat bi
ffice, in tbe presence of Mrs. Robinson, when Hone said he would pay the bill.
The Court granted a rule to show cause.
WOOTTON V. DAWKiNS.
Mr. MELtOr, Q.C., moved for a rule to show cause why the nonsuit entered in this ca8e should not be set aside, and a verdict entered for the plaintiff, with sucb an amount of damages as should be settled by Mr. Justice Williams, who tried the cause, at Leicester, at the last assiz-:. The declaJation contained two counts,one of which was framed on the statute the 7th and 8th of George IV., c. 18, s. 1, which enacts, that if any person should set " any springgun, Inantrap, or other engino calculated to destroy human life or inflict giievous bodily harm, with intent that the same, or whereby the same may destroy, or inflict grievous bodily harm upon a trespasser coming in contact therewith," he should be guilty of a misdemeanoar. It appeared that the plaintiff had lost a valuable bantam fowl, and, having heard that it was in the defendant's premises, he went one day and searched for it there, but, though he saw it, he could not catch it. At 9 o'clock in the evening he got a ladder, and then climbed over the waU into his neighbour's garden; and, as he was stooping his head among some bushes in search of his fowl, his head came in contact with a wire. Immediately there was a loud explosion, the plaintiff was knocked down, and when he came to his senses he saw the defendant coming down the garden with a pistol in his hand. The. defendant had as great a fancy for peaches as the plaintiff had for fowls, and he threatened to shoot the plaintiff. The plaintiff, however, escaped without injury, saving his fright and a little damage to his eyes and hair. No further evidence was given on either side as to the nature of the engine set in the defendant's garden, and the learned judge reserved the question for the Court whether it came within the statute. The learned counsel contended that it did, and cited" Bird v. Holbeck" (4 Bing.), and "Jordan v. Trump' (8 M. and W., 782), and " Barnes v. Ward" (9 C. B., 420).
Lord CA.1PBELL said he thought the learned judge was quite right in nonsuiting the plaintiff, The plaintiffhad no case at common law, and, according to the statute, he had not shown that it was an engine calculated to destroy life, or whereby grievous bodily harm could be done. It was clear that it was an explosive substance put there to frighten and not to hurt, so that the case did not come within the statute. The plaintiff had no action on the statute any more than at common law.
Mr. Justice ERLE observed that by the common law the right of a man to protect his property was almost uncu-li. fled, but the statute had properly introduced the qualifieation that he must not use istruments dangerous to life or limb.
The other judges were of the same opinion. Rule refused.
THE QUEEN V. THE MEETROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORMS.
This was a rule for a certiorari to bring up an order made by the Metropolitan Board of Works awarding compensatton to Mr. Dapres, formerly clerk to the Paving Commissioners of St. Olave's, Southwark, for the loss of his office. The only question now was whether a certiorari would lie.
Mr. MACxAMIARA showed cause against the rule, and contended that the Commissioners had jurisdiction, and that the Court could not interfere. The question was, whether Mr. Dupres was "an officer"at the time when the Act camue into force on the Ist- of May, 1856. In the course of the argument it appeared that in June, 1855, Mr. Dupres had received three months' notice of his removal, in which he had acquiesced.
The COURT held that, under these circumstances, he was not an officer, and made the rule absolute, as in such cases the Commissioners had no jurisdiction to make the order awardiRg him compensation.
Rule absolute for a certiorari.
Court Of Common Pleas, Westminster, April 15.

(SWiUngs in Banco.-Easter Teim, before LorvX Chief Justice

This being the first day of Eastef Ternn, their Lordships, after breakfasting with the Lord Chancellor, took their seats at 2 o'clock.
SI.2ONS V. TAYLOR.
This was an action tried before the Lord Chief Justice at the last sittings for London, when a verdict was found for the defendant.
Mr. Serjeant BYLES now moved by leave reserved for a rule to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside, and entered for the plaintiff for 126. The action was for money lent, to wlich there was a plea of payment. The circumstances of the case arose on the payment of a crossed check, crossed with the words " and Co.," the crossiDg having been obliterated. The check having been crossed the defendant ought to have refused to pay it except through a banker. The plaintiff kept his account with the London Joint-Stock Bank, and on the 28th of August he drew a hoeek on that bank for 1261., crossed " and Co.," in favour of a gentleman named Masters, which was posted and directed to Mr. Masters, 22, Duke-street, Manchesterequare. The check was presented on the 1st of September, and was not then crossed. On the 3d the envelope which had enclosed it was put under Mir, Master's door with the words written upon it, "The finder is very much obliged." On the part of the plaintiff it was said, " You ought to have looked at the check and examined it, and if vou had done so you would have seen that it was croeseZ" The defendant contended that the crossing had not been efficiently or properly done. It was left to the jury to say whether there had been negligence on one side or the other. The jury found that there was negligence on neither side, and it was agreed that the verdict on this finding should be entered for the defendant the plaintiff having leave to move. Tho quebtion of liabiity mainly turned on the construction of the Act of Parliament, the 19th and 20th of Victoria, chap. 25, sec. 1, which provides that "in every case where a draught on any banker made payable to bearer or to order on demand bears across its face an addition, in written or stamped letters, of the name of any banker, or ofthe words ' and company,' in full or abbreviated, either of such additions shall have the force of a direction to the bankers upon whom such draught is made, that the same is to be paid only to or through some banker, and the same shall be payable only to or through some banker." The learned counsel also referzed to the case of "Bellamy v. Marchbanls" (7 Erch., p.404), as deciding that the paymen of a crossed check, except through a bank, would he strong evidence of negligence.
Mr. Justice CRESSWELL.-Would the erasure make it a forged check ?
Mr. Serjeant BYLES submitted it would.
The CIIIEF JusTCE.-You say, suppose you put on a check, " Not to be paid except through a banker," and that was erased, that would be forgery; and you contend that by erasing the crossing it is the same in effect. It is plain that this question must be discussed, and therefore yoe may take a rule.
Rule nisi granted.
LTNG V. CROM .
This was an action tried before Mr. Justice Willes, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff-damages, 1,0001.
Mr. EDWIic JAMIES, Q.C., now moved for a rule to set aside the verdict and for a new trial on facts disclosed in affidavits. The action was brought for crim. con., and the question turned on the genuineness of some letters. If the letters were genuine this was a case for the smallest possible amount of damages; and, although no plea of leave and license was on the record, there ought to be a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff was Captain Ling, and he bad married Miss Littler, the lady the subject of this action. Major Croker, the defendant, was Adjutant on Sir John Littler's staff, and an aoquaintance thus arose between him and Miss Littler. The adultery was admitted, but it was alleged to be with the connivance of the husband, and that question turned on the genuineness of certain letters. The first letter in question was a letter written by the plaintiff to Mrs. Ling, and in an affi. davit by her was distinctly sworn to as having been written by the plaintiff to her, which was dated from the " Army and Navy Club," and contained a parpe"aph stating " You had better, when yon write to Croker, direct under cover to the agents. For God's sake take care that Lady Littler does not see your letters." This letter sanctioned a correspondence between the defendant and the plaintiff's wife and instructed her how to address his letters. The other letters were anterior to this, and were written from Shumla, and heneed not disgust their Lordships or the public by reading them, as they were before their Lordships.
The CLIEP JusTICE.-There is no doubt ground for your application if the letters be genuine.
Mr. JAMES,-Certaily, my lord; and it does appear a little anomialous in our law that the only three parties who could say whether these letters are genuine or not cannot be examined at the trial. The affidavibs of Mrs. Ling and also of Major Croker most distinctly state their belief that the letters aro genuine, and not a concoction.
Mr. Justice WILLEs.-Is there any affidavit of surprise at the handwriting of the letters being disputed?
Mr. JAMIES.-No, my lordc; but we were surprised at the letters being disputed, and if that should be necessary an affidavit to that effect could be furnished.
The CissEP JusTIcE.-What evidence have you that the letters are genuine?
Mr. Justice WILLES.-At the trial you called a sergeant, who stated he was acquainted with the plaintiff's handwriting, having brought home some troops under him. That was the principal evidence, and it was said he had been dismissed from bis position by the plaintiff.
Mr. JMIEs.-This lady handed the letters to her solicitor as the genuine letters of her husband. We did not come down prepared to try this case as a qnestion of handwriting Mrs. Ling now repeats in the most distinct terms that they are her husband's handwriting.
Mr. Justice CRE.sWELL.-There is a great difficulty as to receiving the affidavit of the wife of the plaintiff.
Mr. Justice WILLEs.-There are first affidavits of experts comparing handwriting, and stating their belief that the han writing is the same as other writing of the plaintiffs - also affidavnts that the clerks of the army agents were not called, though at the trial, to disprove the handwriting; but no affidavit of surprise that the letters were disputed.
I Mr. JAM E-s again referred to the impediments in the way
of such an investigation as this if the affidavits were not received.
Mr. Justice CRESSWELL.-If it were so thought by the Legislature it would probably beat sOme time altered.
Mr. J.eMES~.-I am not asidag your Lordahips to supersee he Legislature, but here are three parties who alone can iveany vidnce s t thegenineess of ths letters
e x c l u d e a t w th e t r i a l ; a n d i f t h e y a r e e x c l u d e d n o w t h e y are he nlyparies ho an nowanything about the
m atter.
The CHITF JUSTICE.-TheSy were excluded by the Legis-
lature on the notion that mnuch public scandal would arise
ifte examination of the parties in such causes were per. mitted. Whether they were right or wronig it is not for ! me to say here. But when considering the question of the
expediency of granting a new trial, and we know that the persons making these affidavits could not themselves be examined, it really co3nes to this-what evidence haTe you to offer independent of these parties?
Mr. J,AES said, in addition to these affidavits, they had a MS. newspaper written on board ship on the voyage out to India. It was customary for the passengers to write little articles for their amusement on the voyage in a kind of newspaper, and Captain Ling had taken an wtive part in so doing, and had written many little articles in this MS. newspaper. It had been obtained from the captain of the fhip, and they wished to bring this document before the jury, as it showed a most o7tLElix&Dary similarity bstsvsen
the bandwriting of Captain Ling in it and tho letters in
a estioD, ParticularIy in the turn of the letter " d" from eevantol 'which the experts called had stated theirbelief that the letters were not Captairn LAngs.
Mrr.eJuspace rOl inVDCRapanow does it appear that this MS. newspaper is in Captain Ling's handwriting?
. Mr. JA3MS.-It is sworn to on affidavit by MmIs Ling. If it and the letters are forgeries they are the most skilful ever brought before a court of justice.
Mr. Justice CEROWDER.-Was there any suggestion of the letters being forged by the defendant?
M3r. JAMEzS.-No, none, my Lord.
Sr. Justice WILLEs.-Oh yes, t;here was. Mr. Bremridge was proceeding to say they were very much like Ms Ling's handwriting, when there was a sort of desire shown not to bring that forward, and it was suppressed, as it seemed to me, because if a forgery by Mrs. AiDg, what damages could be obtained for the loss of such a woman ?
Mr. JA2Es.-When the forgery was imputed to her she most solemnly denied it in this affidavit.
The CsiFn JVsTice.-We will grant a rule, but the materials are not now sufficient. There must be oa affidavit of surprise furnished; and with regard to the admissibility of the wife's affidavit, it must be discussed when the rule comes on. But, supposing we think the affidavits admissible, that would not warrant us in granting a new trial, unless you have some evidence beyond them.
Rule nisi granted.
SI13PSON V. THE ACCOENTAY. DEATH COMPANY.
In this case, in which a verdict was obtained for the plaintiffs on a pohcy of the defendants' company for 1,9881.,
MIr. HAxtvKniS moved for a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant, or in arrest of judgment. The action was brougnt by the executors of a gentleman namned Simpson on a golicy in the defendants' office, dated January, 1851, for ,0001. The policy had been yearly renewed. In January last Mr. Simpson met with a severe accident in a fall from his house, from the consequences of which he died on the 1st of February. The defendants pleaded that before his death the premium was payable and due, and remained due 21 days and was not paid. Tho plaintiffs replied that the premium became due on the 22d of January, and that between that timo and the date of the death of the deceased they were in correspondence with the defendants, and that the defendants by their conduct induced the plaintiffs to believe that the policy was of full effect. At the time of the death of the deceased his relatives and the defendants were under the impression that the premium had been paid.
The CmrF Jusmo.-The jury found that the defendants intentionally withheld the fact of the non-paymaent of the premium from the plaintiff, otherwise it would have been paid.
Mr. HAwin;s contended that there was no obligation cast on the defendants to give any intimation that tho premimin was due and not paid, and there were conditions in the policy that if the premium as unpaLid for 21 days after it became due the polcy should be void, and also that it should be optional with the directors yearly whether to renew the policy or not without further information.
Lule ni3i granted.

REODO:ES V. BULL.
Mr. HumDDISTroNmoved thattbe defendant, who hadbeen arrested on a writ of c&. sa., should be discharged from custody, on the ground that his arrest had been illegaly effected. It appeared from the statement of the learned counsel that the writ was directed to the governor of Reading gaol, and that it had been given to two follower, named Blackett and Turner for execution. They accord. ingly proceeded to the residence of the defendant, about 25 miles lromReading, and,findin the doorsclosed, they resorted to the following device :-Blackett procured a ladder, by which he effected his entrance through the windor of the bedroom occupied by the son of the defendant. As four panes of this window were afterwards found broken, it was presumed that be had entered by force. When in the room he threw himself on the bed and roared out I Murder I" at the top of bis voice, which brought the defendant and his son into the room just at the time that Turner made his appearance at the top of the ladder with the writ. A scuffle ensued, during which the defendant was nearly strangled, but he was arrested. it further appeared that Tarner excused his entry by assigping is extreme anxiety to render assistance to the party whom he heard crying out, but it was suggested that the whole affair was a concocted plan with Blackett, and that the arrest was illegal altogether by reason of the forcible entry, and further by the fact that the party authorized by the writ to execute it was not present, which would itself vitiate the proceedings.
The Court granted a rule nisi at once.
SMITH V. R30-DER.
Mr. T. JONES moved, by leave of Mr. Baron Martin, to enter a verdict for the defendant, in lHen of one which
ssed at the trial at York for the plaintiff for 81. The derendant was the tenant of a person who had sold his interest to the plaintiff. Before the transfer the defendant commnenced to erect a shed, but when he heard of the change of proprietorship he desisted from the completion of the shod and pulled down as much of it as he had erected. The now landlord thereupon brought this actioa.inst him treat. ing the shed, or so much of it as ad been pued 'down rather, as a fixture which it was not competent to the de. fendant as a tenant, to remove.
The CojURT thought, the point being quite new, that the defendant was entitled to hbsrule.

XLVA2S V. EVANS.
This was a suit for divorce by reason of adultery, pro. .moted by Mr. Omwell Lloyd Evans, of Cheltenham, against his wife, Mrs. Mary Sophia Evans. The case was brought tothis court by letters of request from the diocess of Glocester and Bristol. Severa1 pleas were put in by the respective parties, and the evidence was very voluminous
The libel given in by Mr. Evans pleaded that the marriage took place on the 14th of November, 150, at St. George's Church, Hanover-square; that the parties immediately proceeded to Paris, thence to Leicester, and after remaining there a few weeks returned to Cheltenham; that shortly afterwards Mrs. Evans began to show great indif. ference to her husband, and positively refused to reside with him at his house, by reason, as she stated, that his mother also resided with him; that she insisted upon living entirely at the house of her father, to which Mr. Evans objected, whereupon sho refused to cohabit with him and the final separation took place on the 10th of Mav, i851, when Mr. Evans made her a suitable alowance; that, with the exception of occasional visits to London and elsewhere, Mrs. Evans continued to live with her father; that in July, 1853, accompanied by her maidservant, she proceeded to London, and took up her abode in furnmshed apartments at 15, Edgware-road, which had been engaged for her by Mr. Robinson, a magstrate and Deputy-Lieutenant for the county of Glocester, a married man (then on a visit to his mother), and that frs. Evans had been on terms of intimacy with Mr. Robinson as well before as after her marriage; that she remained in such apartments for a fortnight and a day, and during such time was visited daily, and sometimes three times a-day, by Mr. Robinson, who procured from the landlady a latchkey to the outer door, with which he used to let himself into the house without summoning the servant; that Mrs. Evans frequently accompanied him to the theatre and other places of public resort, and did not return home on such occasions until a late bour of the night; that on Mr. Robinson so visiting her the blind of the window opposite to where M.rs Evans usually sat was-whetber the sun was or was not shining-lled down by Mr. Robinson or Mrs. Evans, and that at ese visits adultery was committed; that Mrs. Evans then returned to her father's house, where she re. mained until the snmmer of 1854; that in January, Febu, and March of that year Mr. Robinson was daily in e abit of visiting her during the absence of her parents and the other members of the family; that Mr. Robinson and Mrs. Evans were in the constant habit of walking and riding out together on horseback in secluded spots in the neighbourhood of Cheltenham, on which occasions adultery was committed; that on the 16th of June, 1854, MIr. Robinson engaged apartments for Mirs. Evans at 2, Bryanston-street, and on the 19th M Evans, accompanied by a cousin and her maid, arrived and took possession of them, where they remained until the 8th of August following; that the cousin was seldom at home at meals; that Mr. Robinson visited Mrs. Evans several times on each day, and that on the 4th and 6th of July adultery had been committed there; that an action had been brought by Mr. Evans against Mr. Robinson, and a verdict obtained for 500l. damages. Additional articles were afterwards given in, charging adultery betweentthe parties in the open air at Cheltenlam on the evening of the 22d of July, 1153.
An allegation was then brought in on the part of Mrs. Evans, in which it was pleaded that previously to the marriage she required as one of the conditions thereof, to which Mr. Evans expressly agreed, that when married she should not Eve with Mr. Evans's mother, but they should have a separate residence and establishment; that Mr. Evans never suggested any departure from such agreement until they reached Loicester; that Mrs. Evans never showed great indifference to her husband, but did strongly object to keep house for his mother contrary to the agreement, although she offered to go and live with her as a visitor for any length of time; that she never insisted on residing entirely at the house of her father, and never, in fact, refused to cohabit with her husband; that in a conversation with him on the subject of hving with his mother, which took place at the house of her father on the 21st of March, 1851, Mr. Evans became much incensed, and left the house,expressly stating his determination not to return; that on the following day she wrote him a letter wherein she offered an unconditional submission to his wishes, and desired that the past should be forgotten, which letter was delivered into his hands by her father, but in his reply Mr. Evans refused to be reconciled to her; that her father took up his residence at Cheltenham in 1842, and Mr. Robinson having formed an acquaiitance with him in that year became intimate with the whole family, and very frequently visited at the house; that Mr. Robinson's mother lived in London, and he was in the habit of proceeding to her house in the spring and sutmmar of each year, and went there in the spring of 1853; that he frequently when in town executed various commissions for dmerent members of Mrs. Evans's family, and on .many occasions took apartments for her father and his
fau;that Mm.s Evans, being desirous of proceeding to Lndon in June, 1853, wrote wvith the full knowvledge of* er fater to Air. Robini'on to procure apartments for herI which he did; that he vis *D'(l ir, Svans frequently dluringI
her stay in those apartments, but not every day, nor ever three times in one day; that he never as4ed for or procured a latchkey. And that she did not frequently accom pany him to theatres and other places of public resort in the evening, although she sometimes did to the latter in the daytime; that on two occasions only she went to the theatre, and then returned home immediatelv on the con. clusion of the performances; that M1r. Ro6inson accompanied her to the street door, but did not on either occasion enter the apartments; that the blinds were not always pulled down when Mr. Robinson visited her, but the sun shone very strongly on aU the honses on that side of the Edgware-road on which No. 15 was situated from n a.m. umtil late in the evening, and that the blinds of most of them, if not all, were drawn completely down almost daily during the summer months. The allegation then denied that adultery had been committed between the parties during Mrs. Evans's say at that bouse, and also that they were in the constant habit of walking and riding out on horseback alone in secluded spots in the neighbourhood of Cheltenham. On the contrary, it averred that they never walked out except in places of public resort, and were on most occasions accompanied by a third person. After negativing the charge that adultery had taken place during these rides and walks, the allegation went on to plead that the apartments in Bryanston-street had been taken with the full knowledge of Mrs. Evans's father, who intended with his wife and family to oocupy them, after a fortnight, provided they were found suitable ; that the cousin of rs Evans who accompanied her, and who was prepairing to take holy orders, was at home during the rreater part of the day, enZaged in reading either in the sitting-room or in the room adjoining; that on the 4th and 5th of July, the days on which adultery 'Was charged, Mr. Robinson was at the house only once on each day, and that on both occasions other persons were present at the interviews which he had with Mrs. Evans ; that Mr. Evans had brought an action prior to the one in which he obtained 5001. damages, when a verdict was given for the defendant, but which was not entered on the record, in consequence of Mr. Evans obtaining a rule for a new trial In reply to the charge contained in the additional articles it was averred that Mr. Robinson was not in Cheltenlham on the day named, but in London.
Dr. JENIER (with whom was Dr. Bayford), on the part of Mr. Evans,admitted that the alibi which had been set up astothe 22d of July, 1853, had been proved; there was therefore no stigma resting on the patties as to that day; but he contended that unless the Court disbelieved the witnesses who deposed to adultery taking place in the Edgwareroad and in Bryanston-street, Mlr. Evans was entitled to the decision of the Court in his favour. Mr. Robinson was a gentleman of independent property, and vas separated from his vife in December, 185L After the deed of separation had been sdgned between Mr. and Mrs. Evans she was in the habit of seeing Mr. Robinson frequently, as she had done previously. He (Dr. Jenner) admitted that there was great ntimacy between Mr. Robinson and the family of Evans generally, but his attentions were particularly directed to her, and he submitted that advantage was taken of the familiarity with the family to commit the adultery charged.
The Quxxs AnvociTz (with whom was Dr. Deane), on behalf of Mar Evans, contended that the whole case had been got up by those who had been hired to do it, and who had been paid for it. The dorminus litis was mr. zield, a detective officer, and the person pulling the strings from behind and hiring the detective was Mr. Evans. After the decision in that court in " aunt v. Hunt," in which case a verdict was obtained at common law against the alleged paramour, and the damages assessed at 501., it being subsequently proved that the ldy was -irgo intacta, Courts would look more closely than ever to such verdicts. There had been great intimacy between Mr. Robinson and M Evans, and all the members of her family, frequent visits had been paid, but there was no proof whatever of any indecent familiarities having taken place. When Mr. Robinson called at the house of her father, and saw her alone, it was proved by a servant that the door of the room never was barred or bolted, and when she suddenly entered it, without knocking, she found the parties sitting just as other persons would do. The chages relative to the Edgeroad, so far from being substantiated, had completely failed. Mrs. Evans had been watched daily at her father's house from January to Mrch. and not one single fact had been proved against her. With respect to Bryanston-street, the witnesses adduced by M-. Evans deposed that the offences occurred at a particulr time of the day, but testimony had been given on the oQ er side, omni czeftione mnajor, tending to prove a complete acibi for Mr. Robmson, and to account for Mrs. Evans's time. Mr. Evans had withheld from the Court all information as to what first induoed him to suspect his wife's guilt. Mr. Robinson had been produced as a witness; he had denied the truth of all the charges made against Mrs. Evans, he had been corroborated on every point, and no excecption had been taken to his evidence. UJnder these circumstances he (the Queen's Advocate) prayed the Court to dismiss the suit.
Or. J xN] R and Dr. BAYFORD were heard in reply. the COURT reserved its judgment.
*TAOKR V. TAKXR.
This was asuit promoted by the wife against the husband for a divorce by reason of adultery and cruelty.
Dr. BAJYFonD appeared on behalf of Mrs. Thacker, and was about to open the case, when
Dr. ADDAM (with whom w;as Dr. SpEnks) interposed on the part of the husband, and said hewas not prepared to deny the adultery, but he submitted the cruelty wvas not proved.
Dr. EAYETORD said that that part of the case rested on the testimony of the wife alone; he would therefore with-

POLICB.
MASIO-WOusSu.-suan Sulvan and ilarglaret Cook were brought before Mr.Alderman Rosn charged with being concerned with six male prisoners at present under remand in a most extensive robbery of boots and shoes belonging to Mr. Louis Isenburg, of Leadenhall-street.
Mr. Lewis appeared in support of the prosecation.
Thomas Hayton, constable No. 588, said,-Frominformation I receiven, I last night apprehended the prisoner Sullivan at the house of a man named Boyce, who is now under remand on a charge of stealing a large quantity of boots and sboes, the property of Mr. IsenburF. I told her I was an officer, and had come to take her m charge for being concerned with others in the robbery. She said she know nothing at all about it. I took the prisoner Cook into custody this morning on the charge of having assisted to fill the boxes from which the boots and shoes had been abstracted with cinders, stones, and rubbish.
Sarah CampbelL-The prisoner Sullivan is my sister-inlaw. On Sunday last my husband and I went to the house of a man named Desmond to dinner. The prisoner Sullivan, who was there, said that some of the boots and shoes belonging to Mr. Isenburg had been taken to the prisoner Cook's house, and afterwards removed by Maybery (who is under remand) to the house of a man named Pickering. Sollvan has been living with Pickering as his wife. She told me that after the boots and shoes had been taken from the boxes the latter were filled with mud, stones, and ashes by three women, who were paid 1. each for their trouble out of the proceeds of the robbery. She also told me that she had pledged some of the boots at the shop of a pawnbroker in the Minories.
Timothy Desmond.-I know the prisoner Snllivan. At the time of Mr. Isenburg's robbery she lived with Pickering. Her sster is lhing with me as my wife, Although I am a married man. I conveyed a portion of the goods that have been stolen from Mr. Isenburg's to Pickerings house. A few days ago Sullivan told me how Boyce and Pickering had robbed me of 151. which was due to me as my share of the produce of the robbery. She told me that the goods were taken in trunks to a court in Lambeth-street, where they were unpacked and taken into her house, and that they formed a pile which extended from the floor to the ceiling, She said she had pledged two pairs of the boots at a shop in the Minones, and had afterwards destroyed the ticket. Cook was intimate with Pickering and Boyce. In spealdng of Mr. Isenburg's robbery, she said she took some of the goods to Pickering's house, and helped to fill the boxes with
ricks and rubbish. At first she offered to come forward as a witness against the prisoners under remand, and as she afterwards refused to do so she wes given into custody.
The prisoners were remanded till Iriday next.
Richard Steer, a shoemaker, was next placed at the bar, charged with having received some boots and shoes which Desmond, the witness in the last case, had stolen from Messrs. Moses of Tower-hill, while in the employment of that firm.
T'imothy Desmond was sworn, and said,-I was in the employment of Messrs. Moses for 13 years, up to the 4th of November last, when I was discharged. During three years of that period the prisoner was occasionally employed in the prosecutors' tin-shop making packing-cases. I was in the habit of stealing boots and shoes belonging to my employers during the last 18 months I was in their service. Portions of what I stole I uned to sell to the prisoner. I received from hina altogether about 5. for stolen property that I sold him. Nobody was present but his wife when I received the money of him.
Mr. Alderman RoSE.-Is there any other witness besides Desmond?
Hayton (the offlicer) replied that there was not.
Mr. Alderman Rosx.-I do not think the unsupported evidence of a man like this sufficient to justify me in detain,ng the prisoner. He must, however, enter into his own recognisance in the sun of 201. to attend here on Friday
next, when the prisoners already under 1emand will be again brought up.
The prisoner entered into his recognizance aad was discharged.
Mr. William Bray, a respectable-looking rman, was charged before the LoRD L.OR, by Police.constable Thomas Stevens, No. 17, with ssanlting and obstrueting him in the due exewution of his duty.
The officer, having been sworn, said,-About half-past 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon I was on duty in Cornhill, when the defendant and three or four women surrounded me, one of whom accused me of detaining her daughter. I told her I knew nothing of her, and desired them to go away. The defendant followed me, and celled me a - scoundrel and
a vagabond. He also struck me several timer, upon whisk I took hin into custody.
The LORD MAYOR (to the defendsat.).-What have you to sy in answer to this charge ?
Defendant.-My Lord, he has broken up my home three times. He is now living with my wife. Wlhile I was travelling with goods in Yorkshire my errand-boy found him in my house, and sawr his hat and coat hanging up in the passage.

Officer.-The young woman has been keeping this man by Prostitution for years past. I have known her mysel.f more than five years.
The LonRD MAYOR.-Do you mean to say that she is not his wife?
Offlicer.-She is not.
Defendant,-She is, my Lord. When I aked him for my wife he seized mne by the collar, and struck me in the face. I deny that I struck him fir
Susan Clark was then caled as a witness for the defendant, and sid,-I never saw the defendant tiUl esterda, when the policeman collared him and struck him, after which he pulled his nose, and said to him,-"You -a I want you; rll lock you up." I saw the whole tranction, and went to the station-house, and the policeman turned me out three times. A person named Emma Burgess was present when the policeman seized the defendant, and she produced from her poeket the likenes of her daughter (de. fendant's wife), as well as that of the nolienian.
Ms. Emma BorRess.-I am the mother of the defendants wife, whom I have seen with the polioeman a great many times. He tookher from her home, and she hasbeen living with him He has tsken lodgings for her at two

Isacceeded in getting her away from this brothel, but he has since got hold of her. The polhoeman's wife is aprostitute. A few days ago the polioeman took my daughter to a house over the water and passed the night with her. I produce a daguerreotype likeness of the policeman, which I took from my daughter.
The LORD MAron said be had heard quite sufficient to Justify himin sending the matter, as regarded the conduct of the policeman, to be inqtt5red into by the Commissioner of Police? and in the meantim e the further hearing of the present charge would be uostponed. The Lord Mayor then directed Mdr. Inspector Mitchell, who ws in court, to report the proceeding to the Commissioner of Po]ice.
The LORD MAYOR requested that the tress would acknowledge the receipt of M2. from "Lucincha" as a donation to the poor-box.
GurInAT.T -Thomas Wilks and ThomasJames, two respectable looking men, appeared on remand before Aldermin HAL, charged with having caused the death of a lad namned Thomm Hinckston, by laying him upon his back and roling a firkhin of butter upon his stomach and chest while I inta position.
The medical testimony went to show that the inflammation might have been produced by external violence, but that it might also arise from natural caUses.
Alderman HALS said there wa a doubt in the case of which the prisoners would have the benefit, and he trusted the_ would never repeat such practical jokes.
They were then disoharged.
Christian Giuseppi Carlotte, an Italian, was placed at the bar before Aldermam CoPXrD, chargedwith obtaining money under false pretences,
Alderman COPELAD committed the prisoner for one month, with hard-labour, as a rogue and vagabond.

George's-buildings, Albion-buildings, Goswell-street, where I found the prisoner and four young women.
Alderman COPBLAND.-What were those young women doing there?

Alderman COPELAD.-What kind of persons were the women who were with her?

BulL-Yes, Sir, I have taken them alL I told the prisoner we were two police officers, and that she was concerned with persons in sending tkreatening letters to various merchants and gentlemen. She said she knew nothing about it; and when I said we must searchher room she said that everything that was in it belonged to her. I looked into a capboard and found two letters written upon brown paper, similar to those produced. One of these was addressd to Mr. Hitchcock, of St. Paul's Churchyard, and the other to Jarvis, the detective, at Bow-lane tation. I asked her to account for the possession of those letters, and she said she knew nothing about them. I then took her into custody
Reference was then made to other matters upposed to be connected with this case, but which we omit to mention, as it might tend to frustrate the ends of justice.
Alderman COPELAwD.-Have you any questions to aSk the witnesses?
Prisoner. -What am I to say ? *Wnat anm I accused of ? Alderman CoPELAMN.-The charge against you is for sending letters threatening to acwuse gentlemen of the most diTusting offences unless they complied withyour demands.
Â±`risoner.-No, Sir. All I know is that I have written letters for a tall, dark woman, who could not write, and when I saw what she wanted me to write I obiectod, and she said it was all right; it was only nonsense ; but I ever wrote any on brown paper.

in all my experienoe (28 years) as a magistrate, and I have made up my mind, upon the evidence as it stands, to send this case ultimately for trial, and I shall direct the City Solicitor to prosecute.
The prisoner was then remanded.
Bow-sTnrna.-Geraldine Longley, a constable of the A division, combining the fanctions of a police officer with the vocation of assistant-groom of the stables at Scotland-yard, was charged with having absconded from his employment with the livery and uniform intrusted to him by the Commissioners of Police.
From the statement of Mr. Walker, the superintendent of the A division, it appeared that the defendant had been in the force about four yeam A short time ago he applied for leave of absence with the view of getting married * but he never returned to his employ, and, it having beon found on inquiry that he had absconded both from his situation and from the girl whom he had promised to inarry, ho was pursued and apprehended. It having been suggested that a more serious c arge might be preferred against the defendant for having obtained money by false pretences from the young woman in question,
Mr. HsXRy directed her to be placed in the witness-box. Abigail Cook de,posed that she was a servant, at present resding at D)orking. She first made the acquaintance of the defendant more than four yeas age, at Godalming Vicarage, in Surrey, where they were fellow-servants. They had kept company ever since. The defendant leftthevicarage to take a situation in the London police. A time was fixed for their marriage, and defendant promised to get leave of absence. Ho represented to her that he had some money invested in a building society which he was loath to disturb, as it was "earDningmore money,"so she lenthim 11l, besides purchasing a great many things and sending them to him by his order-amounting to &. or 61. more. A Sunday or two ago he borrowed her Bible and Church Service and a lawn handkerchief, and he induced her to let him have her watch and gold chain, with a sovereign, under' the pretence that he would exchange the watch, &c., for a very handsome one. He had given the watch to her four years ago, but the gold chain was purchased by herself. He had now deserted her altogether.
It was understood that the defendant had formed another connexion.
The defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of absconding. He said he forgot to deliver up the uniform, and had since lost it. The suit of livery was still on his back. With respect to the girl, the watch was formerly his own, and he meant to pay back her money.
Mr. HENRY regiretted th;at his conduct to the girl, although very heartless, couldI not be treated as a crimrinal ofence; butforabscondingwith theuniform he must be comlmtted for one month.
MAnYLEBONhX.-Henry John Watts was again placed at the bar before hr. BnoUGoH?r on tho chargo of having, on the morning of the 7th inst.,stolcaa quantity of silver plate from the residence of Mr. W.Grieve, 1, Queen's-road, Glocester-gate, Rlegent's Park.
The depositions were read over by Mlr. Phillips, the chief clerk, ndiathis case the prisoner stands committed for
Inspector Leigh, of the T divisioa, now brought forward a second charge against the prisoner, for having on the 20th ult. stolen a gold watch, a gold chain, a gold eyeglass and other articles of the value of 40L, the property of Mh iiza Woodall, a widow lady, residing at 53, Norland-square, Kensington.
Mary Ann Exall, the housemaid, deposed that at noon on Sunday, the 29th ult., as she wa gomg downstairs she saw the prisoner (she was quite sure he was the man) come out of her mistress's dressing-room. She asked him what he wanted, to which he made no reply, and he jumped out of the staircase window into the square. She called out
'Thieves PI and ' Stop him 1" but he effected his ecape.
3Mrs. Woodall said that she aso saw the prisoner jump out of the widow, and that almost immediately afterwards she missed the stolen .property from her dreesing-table drawer, on the second floor.
Brown, 299 D, proved that the prisoner had been preonusly tried and convicted. He was a ticket of-leave man, and had had sentenca passed upon him of transpertation for ten years; his aZiases wFere those of Miundy and Watson.
upen this charge. the prisoner, wtho had nothing to say, wsremanded till Wednesday next.
Mr. Nortb, a retired surgeon,w hose benevolenco has upon many occasions been exercised at this court, handed on Tuesday last to Mr. TLONG R for the poor-box.

The Liverpool Free Public Library And Museum.
Â¢'TH LIFIUPOOL FBEE PUBLIC LIBRARY
AND MUBSEBM.
LIVERPOOL, ApR1L 15.
The proceedings in connexion with laying the foundation atone of the New Free Library and fuseunu, which, as stated in 7lc T~i of to-day, is being built at the sole cost of Mr. Winijzn Brown, ALP. for Bouth Las=hire, took place to-day. The weather was propitious, ond the care. raony bas passed off extremely welL
The business of the day was Connnenced at half-pest 10 this mor-ig, by te prestationof an-sMressto Mr. Brown at the Town-hall by the Hisio Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, the Nonconformist ninisters of various denominationt(represented by Dr. Rafflee), the Liverpool Sunday School Institute (represented by Mr. C. R. Hall), the Liver. poo Queen's C oegeorepresonied by Mr. Thornely, M.P.), the Livrpool LIMy Institute and School of Art (repre. eented by Mr. W. RasthMon), the Liverpool Literary and Dramtic Society (represented by Mr. Lowton), and the Liverpool Medical I-stitute (epresented by Dr. Voce).
The address of the }storic and the reply were emblazoued in the highest stile of the art, from examples in -nsoent MSS., and were framed appropriately. The afi
dress, which was read by the President, Major-General the HIon. Sir Edwrd Cust, was as follows:-
"Sir,-You this day lay the foundation stone of a building to be devoted to a Free Public Library and Mueum; and you hav dAso, with a spirit worthy of so good a cause, signfied your intention to erect it exclusively at your ewn cost.
If We might on general grounds congratulate the publio and ourselves as the recipients of such a noble gift; and any body of men might with much propriety tender to you their grateful acknowledgments. But the members of the Historic Society of Lasashire and Cheshire feel that they bave a peouliar riht to do so. It is their pleasing duty to record facts of interest respecting this part of the country, and to cultivate an extended intellectual spirit. Their meetings are held within the walls of St. George's HalL The society has itself collected a library and museum for the use of its own members; and a piace of deposit has been promised for this oollection, as soon as sufficient space can be spared, in the public museum of the town.
" It affords ttE highest gratification to every person in this great community to see one of its members spontaneously producing from his abundance such a valuable and suitable offering for tho benefit of the public at large. lb is particularly gratifying to this society that one who who has been enrolled among its members from the first, and who occupies a prominent official place within the area of Its operations, should afford such material aid to the intellectual objects which it laours to promote. Nor can it be less satisfactory to yourself to witness the high appreciation of your generous conduct, as evidenced by the enthusiastic and grateful recognition of all sections and grades of Wsoiety.
" We regard the principal ceremony of this day as snitiatory in more senses than one. We trust that it will induce many others of our ' merchant princes' to emulate so good an example, and we rejoice to see facilities for completing the education of our ordinary schools, as weU as for carrying general intelligence to lower grades of the community. We foresee in the new erection the appropriate home of some of our societies and institutions for literature, science, and the arts, and we look forward with hope to its affording valuable aid towards a higher class of education than any that Liverpool possesses.
"M May you be spared to witness length of years and years of happiness, and to see, amid the praise and honour of young and old, the valued fruits of the beautiful tree which you this day plant among us.
' Liverpool, April 15.'
Mr. BROwN read the following reply
" Gentlemen,-So totally unexpected are the honours which my feUow-townsmen are conferring on mne,-for my desire in some slight degree to aid and promote their onward progress in acquiring knowledge of the useful arts of life,that it exceedingly embarrasses me to find suitable language to express my feelings, particularly to the Historic Society, of which I have been, I fear, an unworthy member.
"1 My only apology is, that I have not time at my command, or that knowledge which would enable me to make myself useful in fishing the inexhaustible preserves of antiquarian lore, which is so extremely ueeful in verifying and correoting many important parts of history. Therefore, all I can do is to try to mend, and extend the net in some slight degree. that you may have a greater power of withdrawing more and more from those preserves the treasures which they yet contain. In this duty I consider that we are all called upon to assist.
" No one can appreciate more than I do your useful labours-in al your three chosen lines of inquiry, archmeology, literature, and science-and I can assure you that I am much gratified at your desiring to present to me such an address, couched as it is in language most flattering.
" To be considered the associate of such a society gives -me position and rank among my fellow men, and this is a great stimulus to make myself worthy of such a position.
" Gentlemen, permit me, in conclusion, to thank you sincerely for the honour von have conferred upon me.
" Iverpool, April 15."
After the presentation of the addresses a procession was formed to the site of the new building. Among the distinguished persons. present in the vicinity of the stone were Lord Stanley, M.P., Sir John Paldngton, LieutenantGeneral Sir Harry Smith, the Bishop of the diocess, MajorGeneral Sir Edward Cust, Mr. Monckton Milnes, M.P, .r. W. Ewart, M.P., Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mr. J. Cheetham, M.P., Mr. T. B. Horsfall, MLY. ; Mr. Joseph Christopher Ewart, M.P., &c.
Mr. Alderman S. HoLMs3, -who officiated for the Mayor, who wAS prevented by iblness from being present, addressing fMr. Brown, said,-During the continued indisposition of his Worship the mayor, which confines him to his chamber, he is prevented from having the gratification of presenting you with this trowel, with which you will lay the first stone of a building that will show to future ages your public spirit and liberality, which have rendered your name familiar and popular to thousands. Sir, it is a source of regret to me personally that his Worshipis not able to take part in the interesting proceedings of the day, because the occasion is deprived of that discrimination which characterizes his public addresses; but I venture, on his behalf, and on behalf of every individual of this community, to tender their best thanks for your splendid gift, by which your name will be enrolled among the most distinguished of the public benefactors of LiverpooL (Cheers.) Sir, I had the happiness of inaugurating another magnificent gift of a nobleman (Lord Derby) whose son (Lord Stanley) has done ls the honpur of attending hero to-day. (Cheers.) The gift to whi# I refer was the most noble one by Lord Derby -when he pr'esented the magnificent historical and ornithological collection which is nowv in Duke-street. It soon became evident, in consequence of the increase in the number of readers at the library and of visitors to the museum, that the present building was greatly inadequate to the purposes of the Free Library and Museum. Sir, you did me th
honour, during the period when I filled the office of chief magistrate of this town, to authorize me, when we were reflecting what was best to be done, to state to the towncouncil on your behalf your intention to present 6,0001. towards the fund for building the proposed new Free Library. Sir, your munificence stopped not there. You subsequently proposed to double that amount, and recently you went still further in the path of generous munificence, and signified your intention of taking the entire cost. (Applause.) And, Sir, I well re member the words which you uttered on that occasion, as you did not place me in a position which renders it necessary that I should keep them secret. You stated, Sir, that Providence having blessed your exertions in giving to you considerable property you felt it your duty, while life was yet spared to you, to devote a portion of that property for the present and future benefit of those among whom that property had been earned. (Cheers, and cries of " Bravo.") Sir, it is a noble thought, a noblo idea, and one well worthy imitation. (Hear, hear.) You have learned a lesson which a position of immense of wealth, however anomalous it may appear, very rarely teaches. (Hear, hear.) Your career, Sir, has been an important one, for you have lived in very eventful times. You have seen this great port extend beyond any. tbing this worldlhas ever seen before for the accommodation of commerce. In the commen cement of your career in the year 1810 our dock space was only 36 acres, and it is now 209 acres; while, in addition to the provision made on the opposite shore, 15 acres more are in the course of con.
structIon. Your tonnage in 1810 was 734,000 tons, and last year it was 4,320,000 tons, and notwithstanding there have been two large reductions in our dock-rates, the receipts last year were 32.2,8501. against 65,7821. in 1810. (Cheers.) He referred also to the growth of the colonies ; the spread of civilization; to the recent preservation of peace between England and the United States, which he attributed mainly to thecommnercial influenoe and example of Mr.Brown (hear); and to the necessity for the spread and extension of progress. In conclusion he said,-I will not detain you longer, boyond the expression of a fervent hope, which I am sure will b3 shared by every person in thie large assembly, that your life may be of long continuance; that you may live to see the top stone of this building. (Cheers.) It will not be unbecoming the solemnity of an occasion like this to add that I trust that when your earthly career may terminate you will have gained a position in a mansion not made with hands, a building which is eternal in the Heavens, and whose builder and whose maker is God. (Cheers.) I have now, Sir, on behalf of the inhabitants of Liverpool, the greatest gratification in presenting you with this trowel.
The trowel was elegantly embossed and contained an ap. propriate emblematioal design, representing a classic fignur presenting the drawing of the new building to Education, with Fame overhead, crowning the donor with a wreath of laurels.
Tne stone having been lowered in its bed, the Dxruri NAYDI2 read the inscr-ption, which was as follows:-
"Tbia dnt stone of a buwldlng f)r tte Free Publ:c Libray and 3f lewum of tuo 1oraugh of Liverpool wa set en the 16th of Apr% J5I, by Bsown, Ilsq, MItP, for oath Lancmulre, at whos#)

"WILLIAM SHUTTLE WORTH, Town-clerk."
After an eloquent and impressive prayer by the Right Rev. the Bishop of CEisrmT,
Mr. BROWN stepped on to the dais, and was received With enthusiastic cheering. He said,-Mr. Mayor, ILadies, my Lords, and Gentlemen,- I feel myself personally so much mixed up with the proceedings; of the day, so deeply interested in them, and so much carried away by reflection on the past, the present, and the future, that I cannot trudt myself to speak without notes, I therefore beg your indul. gence if I freely refer to those I hold in my haud. Since I had the honour of addressing you, Mr. Mayor, in December last, on the subject of the Free Library, the opinion of all classes has been so universal in approbation of my conduct, it is to me most satisfactory; and the manner in which the corporation has deemed it right to associate my name with the Library, and to be honoured by a resolu, tion of the Council, that I should be requested to lay the foundation stone, could not be otherwise than particularly gratifying. The trowel and mallet, the necessary imple. ments to lay the foundation stone of this new Library, which you, Mr. Mayor, have presented to me, are extirmely beautiful, and mark, in the atrongest manner, the readers' appreciation of my desire to aid the increasing intelligence of my fellow-townsmen. The trowel shows the classic taste of the artist who designed it. It will descend as an heirloom to my family, and will, I hope, afford them many pleasing reflections. When I intimated my desire that my name in some way or other should be associated with it I was far from expecting or dreaming of the highly complimentary manner in which yon propose to carry out my wishes. I should be wanting in respect to the corporation, and not do justice to my own feelings, if I did not avail myself of this pubic oppor tunity of sincerely thanking it for the resolutions it has passed. They are the highest honour it can confer on me, although I feel it far overrates my deserts. It has long been the conviction of my mind that to place within the reach of our fellow-townsmen a Free Library-nd Museum, where they will have sufficient space, and comfortably-warmed and ventilated airtments to resort to, to read and pursue their studies, will be a great inducement for many to como bere and spend their time profitably, in place of wasting hours in listlessness, or possibly something worse. It is evident that there is a growing taste and anxiety on the part of the public to avail themselves of opportunities to aequire knowledge and cultivate their minds, at which I sincerely rejoice. (Cheers.) And it is the duty of us all to promote this geod-feeling as much as lies in our power. (Hear, hear.) Hereothey will meet with the aocnmulated itelligence of ages, and which, I hope, will be eagerly sought after by many. And no one can doubt this who visits the library in Duke-street, and sees its crowcded state, the parties who attend there, and the class of books that are asked for. (Hear, hear.) It is hardly necessary to say that knowledge aids us in providing with greater ease for our physical wants, improves our social position in this world, and, I trust, moraUy and mentally, wiU fit us for a better. Books at one period were too costly to be witbin the reach of any but the great and the wealthy. Happily that period has passed away, and cheap editions of standard works enable us to have a much more extended circulation of them, even to the poor man's cottage, which contributes to the happiness of thousands, I may say of millions, who cannot afford to have a private library of their own, and I am not without hop that at no distant period the finances of the country willenable the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take off the paper duty altogether, and further aid in reducing the price of cooks. (Cheers.) Assoon as this buildingisreadyit will afford a safe depository for that valuable colection of subjects of natural history for which we are alldeeplyindebted to Lord Derby. Ihope by giving every encouragement to masters of vessels and others to come here and inspect those treasures it wil induce them, when opportunity serves, to make the museum stiU more valuable by colleting, when abroad, such specimens and articles as will continue to enrich it. (Hear.) Many valuable collections are now lost for want of a suitable place to receive them, where they would be taken care of. This difficulty will now be removed. There is a subject in which the town has taken much interest as the means of saving labour, not only in our commercial, mechanical, and scientific pursuits, but in the education of the people, as it would relieve the schoolmaster from much drudgery in teaching, save the scholar much time in learning accounts, and allow more leisure to acquire knowledge on other subjects. If, in place of continuing our barbarous system of currency, weights, and measures, we would adopt a simple decimal notation, it would give us equal advantages with other nations who use it. Bringig t e subject prominently forward now is in unison with the business we have in hand. (Hear, hear.) In December, 1852, the Liverpool and the American Chambers of Commerce took this question up, and were supported by a public meeting of the mhabitants, presided over by the mayor. They memorialized Governuent on the subject, but no action was taken on it until Parliament met in 1854, when I obtained a committee to inquire into the merits of the system, and which made a unanimous report of its importance and in its favour. (Cheers.) Stil, Government could not be moved to advance. In 1855 1 deemed it advisable to bring the subject before the House of Commons, and was most ably seconded and supported by a speech from the noble lord (Stanley), who I am pleased is now present. (Cheers.) We carried our point by a large majority, whioh forced on the Government the appointment of a Royal commission which is now examining evidence on the subject. I am afraid that neither the Prime Minister nor the ChanceUor of the Exchequer sufficiently appreciate the aptitude of the industrious classes readily to conform to any change, and their great desire to avail themselves of the best and quickest means of getting their children educated. I view this decimal question a4 exceedingly important in facilitating education (hear, hear), and the more we forward it the more we shall be in a position to avail ourselves of the advantages of libraries. It is only the want of time and of opportunity in having access to those silent friends-well chosen books and museums-which prevent, in many cases, valuable talent being developed that lies dormant and lost for ever to the world. We owe a debt of gratitude to men of soienceand of letters, whenwe consider thetime and treasure they have spent in solving problemg, trying experiments, making!discoveries, and perfecting machinery. (Cheep ) We ought to hold them in the highest estsmiation as the benefactors of mankind, and must regret that for want of access to public libraries to ascertain what was done by others they had sometimes to go over the same ground to arrive at the same result, and lost both their time and their labour, which was a great discouragement to further advances. Hence the more we can facilitate the researches of such men, the more we contribute toA the general good in Great Britain and throughout the world. (Cheers.) Look at the history of many of our great and distinguished men who have become so in spite of the difficulties they had to encounter. Let us remove those difficulties as far as we possibly can, and aid the work of progress. It will not be questioned that knowledge makes us more reflecting beings-enables us better to appreciate the value of the constitution under which we live, and the many advantages that we enjoy, and be less liable to those unfortunate and il-judged ebullitions of public opinion which generally add to that distress which it was intended to alleviate. I have great faith in free libraries, freedom of discussion, and a Free press-which we pre-eminently enjoy-being the best guarantees for our liberty, and for our onward progress as a nation in virtue and in knowledge. So long as we maintain those elements of instruction we add to the happiness of the people, the power of the State, the permaneucy of the constitution, andsecurethestability of theThrone. Andletme addthe wqh-in which I am!sure all here presentwill heartily join me-that our present n~rtuous Queen, who sets an excellent example to all the Sovereigns of the earth, may long reign over her loyal and faithful subjects. Mr. Brown concluded his speech by announcing that he had just learnt that Her Majesty had been confined of a daughter, and was doing welL (Cheers.)
Mr. HOIrE.-After that announcement we cannot do less than give three cheers for the Queen, with a hope for her speedyrecovery. (Cheers.)
A salute of 21 guns was fired by the Militia Axrtilerv from the North Fort.
Lord STA.A-EY, being warmly called for, stepped forward ani said,-Ladies and Gentlemen, pray whatever you do, don't expect a speech from me. (Laughter.) I can say nothing upon this occasion that has not been much better said by your mayor, or rather by a gentleman representing your mayor to-day. I might congratulate you, ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion, on having added to your town a building which wil be among the chief ornaments of this town of Liverpool; I might congratulate you on having increased your educational appliances and your means of instruction by the creation of an institution which wil go far to place Liverpool as high intellec-
tauy as it stands commerciaUy. (Cheers.) I prefer congratulatingyou upon something which is higher and better still -the having among the first and most respected of your citizens a genileman who has displayed rare perse verance, with skill and success, in accumulating wealth,
while has displayed the not less rare and distinguished munificence in appropriating that wealth to public purposes. (Applause.)
Sir JoeN JAKINGTON, being also called for, briefly addressed the assemblage, observing, though personally a stranger among them, he was stil one who took a heartfelt interest in the education of the masses in England (cheers), and he had therefore gratification in comin
here to-day to testify, so far as his humble presence could testify, the admiration which he felt for one of the noblest acts that had ever done honour to the character of Englishmen. (Cheers.)
Mr. WiLLimA EWART, being called for by name, expressed the gratification which he felt at this munifiocent act of a townsman, in his native town, which he trusted would be largely imitated in other towvns.
Lieutenant-General Sir HARRY SMITH was also loudly called for. He said,-Ladies and Gentlemen,-My profession is that of war, the resulb of which is peace. (Cheers.) Thatglorious battle of Waterloo obtained a peace for 40 years,-a peace which contributed to the formation of institutions of this sort by the gradual progression of art, and science, and education. If I, as a soldier, have individually contributed to such great thingg, proud am I to stnd among you loyal citizens of LiverpooL Be assured, my countrymer, there is nothing so gratifying to a solhier as to live in the hearts of the people for whomp he has endangered his life in variouscountries, and whose?rideever will be to see England free and triumphant. (Cheers.) Bat while war, cruel war, tends to peace, so it is tru' that it tends to the harmony of nations genorally, and indures to England that liberty, the great object of which subsists in obediebco to the laws, and in greatness throughod the -eorld.

The steam troopship Himalaya, Commander Haswell, embarked the head-quarters of the 90th Regiment alongside Portsmouth dockyard yesterday amounting to about 900, making, with her ship's company, about 1,100 persons, and dropped out to Spithead, which she will leave this morning for Chinn. The troops seemed most comfortably berthed, and supplied with comforts not known to troops employed in the former China war.
The Boscawen, 70, Captain Glanville, struck the flag of Rear-Admiral Fanshawe, C B., last evening at sunset, and left Spithead since for Plymouth, to he paid off and re-commissioned to carry the flag of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Sir F. W. Grey, KL C.B., on the Cape of Good Hope suation. The Boscawen sailed from Bermuda on the 26th ult., ex. perienced strong N.W. and W. winds the whole pasage. The Indus, 78, Captain Stewart, C.B., dlag of Rear-Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, K.C.B., arrived out on the 23d of March. The steamaloop Basilisk towed the Boscawen out through the Narrows and proceeded on for St. Thomas's and the West Indies. The Boscawen lost two men on the voyage home; one fell from aloft on deck, and one fell overboard; the ship is healthy, with the exception of Captain Glanville, who left her at Portsmouth, and in. valided to Haslar.
The dep6t of the 37th Regiment, consisting of 8 sergeants and 60 rank and file, with Brevet-Major J. Ii. Heaton, Ensign L J. Bell, Ensign S. Hawkes, Ensign F. C. korbes, ad Ensign M. A. Borthwick, will proceed from the Provi. sional Battalion, Chathain, this morning to Chichester, for the purpose of joining the Dep6t Battalion under the command of Colonel 0. Elmhirst.
The Duke of Cambridge has awarded a silver medal, with a gratuity of 51., to James Byrne, a private in the 81st Regiment, at Chatham, for long service and meritorious conduct.
The Turkish frigate Geyvan Bahri sailed from Liverpool for Constantinople on Tuesday, having been prevented by the weather from takdng her departure on Monday. She fired a Royal salute, as she passed the Rock Light, in honour of the British flag, a compliment which was returned by the Artillery Militia stationed at the North Fort. Since the vessel has remained at Liverpool she has lost four of her complement of men, who were all buried in the Necropolis, a Dissenting burialground.
A numerous body of the unemployed assembled yesterday evening in the paper-factory of the Arsenal at Woolwich, in order to devise the means (if possible, by soliciting contri. butions from their comrades, who are in the receipt of wages) to reduce the long list which has been presented to Lord Panmure, containing the names of those who have petitioned Government for the grant of a free passage to Canada. A reply was received on Taesday, in whikh his Lordship stated, with much commiseration for the distress of the men, that his department has not the means of complying with their request. A deputation immediately went to the residence in London of General Codrington, one of the members for the borough, but unfortunately the General was absent from home. With a little hesitation they then proceeded to lay their petition before Sir Benjamin Hawes, who received them most cordially, sympathixing with their distressed position, and advising them to return to Woolwich and endeavour to reduce their number. This was the ob. ject of the meeting last evening in the Royal ArsenaL The assistance however, which their fellow-labourers were enabled to render them was very trifling. An additional 100 are under orders of dismissal from the carriage department of the Royal Arsenal, who it is probable may yet be retained through the humane interference of Colonel Tulloh, superintendent of that branch of the establishment, who has considerately represented to Government the feasibility of employing the services of the entire number now engaged throughout the ensuing year, and also of redueg the hours of labour. The Colonel considers that in place of granting the after part of Saturday as a holyday to the men, if the whole day were ceded to them a great portion of them, who are industriously inclined mechanics, would be induced to turn the day to the advantage of their families. Since the termination of the Russian war upwards of 7,000 men andboysemployed in various capacities havebeen discharged from the A rsenal alone. MIany of their families are consequently in a state of utter ssarvation, and thousands are reduced to an inconceivable state of distress. To-morrow a public meeting (as announced by placards through the streets of Woolwich) of the ratepayers and the discharged workmen from the Royal Arsenal and dockyard will be held at the Ratepayers'-hall, to consider and adopt such resolutions as maybe deemed expedient to releve the painful distress caused by the late discharge of artusans from the public establishments in the town. Mr. J. Townsend, the newly-elected member for Greenwich, will occupy the chair.
Her lajesty's screw steam corvette Scout, lately constructed in WGolwich dockyard, is now ready to be placed under the hands of the riggers, and was yesterday removed from the fitting basin for that purpose.
The screw steam storeship Hesper, under fitment for Chins, was hauled out of basin at Woolwich yesterday, and proceeded down the river to try her machinerv at the measured mile. She has been supplied with one of Grifliths's patent screw propellers, which admit of plaeing the blades in line with the keel when not steaming, thereby obviating the necessity of unshipping the screw, and giving the vessel the full advantage of sail.
The storeship nffalo, along the wharf at Woolwich, has cleared out her cargo, and prepared for survey preparatory to being paid off, and laid up in ordinary.
The Lords of the Admiralty have sanctioned an exchange of divisions between Captain John B. Prynne, of the Woolwich division Royal Marines, and Captain Richard C. Spalding, Plymouth division.
MIessm. Lucas Brotherm having completed the erection of the gun factory boring-mills, and gasworks, in Woolwich Arsenal, have handed them over to the charge of the Government officials. The clock tower, destined to be carried 120 feet in height, and to contain a peal of chime beols, is stayed at the height of 90 feet, and is to be converted to the use of a water tower.

Sir,-I am sorry to again trespass on your valuable space, but must beg leave to refute some of " H. C." 's statements, which are quite as erroneous as those of " P.," whose cause he endeavours to sustain.
The N ew York journals of the latest dates reDort the Niagara as about to start on her first trial trip previous to leaving for this country. "H. C." is in error in supposng her to have been tried before. He has evidently some other vessel in his mind.
The United States' Government have at present eight ships on the stocks, all on a similar plan, but mostly on a smaller scale, to the Niagara and Merrimac, therefore "H. C."C w ill rceive that he is in error in supposing they intend to "buud no more rNiagaras."
I subjoin a statement of the comparative size, &o., of the Merrimac and Diadem, from which you zan see that " H. C." is wrong in stating the latter to have the heaviest armament.

The New Bishops And Preaching.
THE NEW' BISHOPS AND PPEdACHING.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIIIES.
Sir,-The public mind hns been not a little occupied on both the above topics lately. Many persons have complained that the new bishops are unknown as theologians or divines, and many have declared that their religious apr,etite has failed to be satisfied, or at any rate to be excited, bV the food provided ih the sermons they hear.
Nov, it would be a cause of great regret if we had no bishops whose opinions on delicate points of systematic theology would command attention and respect; but are those most skilled in dogmatic and systematic divinity the men whose preaching is most attractive and effective with the mass of hearers. It may possibly be true that the new bishops have devoted greater attention to pastoral than to scholastic theology: but at any rate they are acknowledged to be popular preachers; and in Thte Times of Monday we have a paragraph from a northern newspaper from which we learn that the bishop whose appointment has given the least satisfaction of all the recent appointments (the Bishop of Ripbn), unexpectedly addressed in the open air, on a chance occasion (the consecration of Keighley Cemetery), "the assembled multitude, with great earnestness and effect," so that " the crowd listened with rivetted attention, and with almost the silenco of the dead," afterwards " quietly going their way under a deep and, we trust, last. ing impression of the solemnnity of the occasion."
Is not this a preacher such as, in a leading artiole in the same impression of your paper, you plead for so strongly? And has not Lord Palmerston by his " un-scholastic" appointments given us ahope of higher models of preachinz in thee high placea of the church? "HaIbitann:in Sicco' .oan hardly object to the new bishops, whatever 'jc protes-
s 'onal friends may urge against them.I

The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Tagns, Captain Edward Christian, from Gibraltar for Southampton, arrived here thix morning, having ia tow the dismnasted ship Martin Luther, Captain Gordon, of and from Liverpool. with 498 passengers for Quebeo. The Tagus left Gibraltar on the 6th of April, Cadiz on the 7th, Lisbon on the 9th. and Vigo on the 11th. Her cargo consists of 10 packges of specie value 4,1321., 117 boxes of eggs, 11 quarter-casks of wine, 6091 chests of oranges, three half-boxes of tangerines, 143 boxes of datem, 61 bags of coffee, and 23 packages of sundries.

The Martin Luther, 1,241 tons register, left Liverpool on the 9th inst. with 498 passengers and 1,200 tons general cargo for Quebec. On Sunday, the 12th, in lat. 50 W., long. 8 W., she experienced very heavy weather from the nerth-west. At 8 p,nm., when under double-reefed topsailg gad reefed foresail, the main-top-gallant mast was canied away. At 5 a.m. on Monday, when under close. reefed maintopsail only, the fore and maintopmasts were carried away close to the caps, taking with them the boat swain, John Westwood, of Dcnfermline, Peter Branagan, and three other seamen, who were on the weather yardarm endeavouring to secure the foresail, which had broken adrift. They were all unfortunately drowned. In order to clear the wreck the officers and crew cut away the mainmast, which dragged the mizenmast with it, and she thus became completely unmanageable. On TuesdaT morning she was fas$ drifting to leeward before a heavy sea and north-west wind, and was only 18 miles from Ushant, when she was providentiaLly sighted by the Tagus, which, after considerable danger to herself and damage to the lifeboat, succeeded about noon inrescuingher. The hull of the
fartin Luther is in good condition, hut in consequence of the heavy weather most of the berths were broken and knocked down, and the possengers have suffered severely.
Singular Case Of Mesmerism.-The young
SINGIAR COASE OF MMESMERIS3f.-The young woman in this town (Galashiels) whose extraordinary case has excited the liveliest attention in the medical world and throughout the country is now quito recovered, and restored to the use of her faculties, mental as well as physicaL In tho beginning of June last the girl, whose age was 17, was seized with a severe gastric fever, which left her in a very prostrate condition, durng which she was attacked witli a violent spasmodic cough, which lasted without intermission for 24 hour Dr. Tweedie, seeing that she would die from sheer weakness-after he had exhausted all the remedies in the pbuacopceia resolvedupon trying mesmerism. After much perseverance he succeeded in putting the patient into a sound sleep, which controlled the spasms. The character of the dse was then changed. The patient fell into a trance, in which she remained for five weeks, dung which time she was unoonsciously fed vith beef tea, being mechanically roused to this exertion throughmesmericpasses. For eight weeks more she remained under the magnetic influence, any attempt to remove it evenfor the briefest time being instantly followed by strong convulsions. Gradually, however, she was able to be demesmerised for the space of a few minutes, till, by degrees, the natural period extended from five to 10 minutes, and from a half-hour to two or three hours. The intervals in the end rapidly lengthened, till she at last completely recovered. The first nightshe sleptin a natural state was on the 15th of March, and her recovery since that has been rapidly progressive. Altogether, the procesd of ctre extended over nine months, and during that time-her hearing, speech, and ability to walk having been lostthese were restored sei-tim by the magnetic nrocess, and in the same gradual way. Full power of hearing was preceded by noises in the ears of various kinds, and at longer or shorter intervals. In like manner speech was preceded by moaning sounds and indistinct monosyllabic utterances, until, in both instances, the full action of the organs was restored-the recovery taking many weeks to be accomplished. We do not advert to the extraordinary developements of clairvoyance and other magnetic effects which the patient exhibited in a way probably never seen before, and which she Xg still capable of showing. A rather remarkable and even ludicrous circumstance attending her recovery is that on meeting Dr. Tweedie in the street after she began to walk abroad she immediately fell into the magnetic sleep, and it was not till the had fairly been brought to dispense alto-ether with mesmerism to induce sleep at night that this influence of the operator ceased Of course she is estllhighly susceptiblo of tbe power when applied in the usual way, but in every respect she is well and healthy, and has even grown during her illUness. We may remark that during her protracted attack she always appeared to be free from organic disease ; the skin was clear, the lips full and red, and the oomplexion healtby, notwithstanding the terrible severity of the convulsive sasms.-Border Advertiser.

PROGRES3 OF'1FREE; TstDnE ra RIJssrI-Free trade makestprogress alike in free and despotic2countries, Russia recently published a new tariff, in which considerable eucthions are made on the duties formerly levied on numerous articles of import, and the Government of the rope has lowered its tariffrby 0 to 70 per cent, on cotton aRnd woolen fabrics, clothes, soap, oil, and other commnodities. The IJnited States have also taken another stride towards free trade. An Act was passed at Washington list month which reduces the import duties on no fewver than eight schedules of articles of trade. The duty on spirots is redced from 100 to 30 per cent.; on cut glass

CRE OF WrrD MN rw Msssouar.-A St. Joseph's correspondent of the St. LSouis Rep rdiean teils the following story :-" A wild man was caught last week and brought to town. He was surrounded in a sort of lair beneath a dense cluster of undergrowth, Dike the habitation of a wild beast, and filed with the bones and skins of cats, which seemed to haveconstituted his principal article of food. Forthis strange diet he has apeculiar penchant,*and ebctewed almost every other. He hnted cath s with an avidity prompted by an extreme voracity, and it was in the pursuit and l aughter of these animals that he was irst discovered. Frequent attempts were made to capture him, but his agilty and speed were such that he apneared to run upon the tops of the Dshes, and fences offered no impediment to hfs headlong course. At clngth a great number surrounded and secured him. He attempted battle, but was overcome. When brought to the Court-houise he presented the stransest appearance conceivable. His height aas about five and a-half feet; hishair long, reddish brown, and matted; his eyes large, gray, and restless; his fingernails as long as thr cag ws of a tiger; his deportment crouching, half timid, half threatening; and his garments consisted of a thousand tatters of cloths, barks, catskins, ac., bound together by catgnts. He said he was from the state of New York, and had been in the woods 36 yedrs. While he was being examined, snd was permitted to stand unbound, he made a sudden spring over the heads of thor s who surrounded him, and darted away with the speed of the reindeer. The crowd pursued hime, but i vain. Over the hills he fairly flew, before both footmen and horsemen, until .he was failb lost to them. Nothing has since been heard of him." He is certainly a strange being, and is literally a wild man. His age can hardly exceed 40, andgyet he has lived so mach away fror the society of man that he has nearly forgotten his language, and has the most vague recollection of things. He remembered New York, bat did not know where he was, nor the form of governmnent under which he lived.

Sir,-I believe that the majority of great morements or reforms in this country would be found to have originated in a letter to Thk Tima, and if any subject worthyof agiation ix fortunate enough to obtain your advocacy, ad by its merits and interes to rae a disussion through the medium of your columns, we maybe quite sure thata judgment will be arrived at more conclusive than if pronounoed by wig and ermine.
A great-I believe, a witally important-subject to the welfare of this nAtion has recently been brought before the public, but unfo.tunately it is one in which the public at lar take no interest whatever, and it is to the pecuniary intet of thoe who are conoerned in its agittion tostili inquiry, or at all events "to pas bv on the other sid#."
It ix the oondition of our mercantile marine as regardx the charcter, eskftn, and education of its officers, and the character and treatment of its eamen, to which I allude. A meeting, of which your paper pve a report, was reenty held at Southampton, to protest against the unjut inter ferenoe of the Govermment in courts of inquiry held upon commanders of the mercantile maine, and a letter from Captin Robert Methven (the author of a practical work entitled l7c Log of a Merchant Offcer), with so very jut remarks, appead in your paper of the 9th inst.
I am not sue that the gentlemen who oonstituted the meeting at Southampton, although supported by the opinion of the .cononi, have so vlid a ground of complaint as they seem to suppose. Any impartial person who looks back upon the diatrous and disgraceful shipwrecks of the past five yearS only, accompanied by a loss of life which is quite appalling (and in its aRRregate would nearly approach the slaughter of Waterloo), mnst admit that it is bigh time that some tribunl should exist before which an impartial inquiry should be not only posdble, but imperstive The present constitution of the merchant service does not admit of a courtmartial analogous to that of the Royal navy or the army. Masters of merchant ships, generally, would be most unwilling to'give up the needful time to the investigation of a court, and unquestionably their sympathies would be enlisted on behalf of their brother in misfortune, to say nothing of the fact that the most disastrous shipwrecks and their consequences are frequently owing to neglect of pre. cautions for which the "system" of the merchant service is responsible. If there be any just grounds of oro. plaint against the constution of the present courts of inquiry, it would surely have been desirable to adduce instnces of supposed injustice, It is a fact which tells rather against such an inference, that in a recent case the justioes and Royal Naval Prosecutor acquitted the commander of the Kadrid, while his employers (so the newspapers report) have dismissed him from their servioe.
Oulr naval supremacy is pretty well established asa fact. The seas swarm with our merchant ships. Not a day pes but a new leviathsa is launched into the deep. Thousands of sturdy Arms at tbis moment are driving bolts or clinching rivets. Every harbour is sending forth one or two, or 10 or 20, sometimes from one port 3M0 "winged messengerst" And every ship that sails needs a head (a commander), officers and crew. This is our great mercantile marine, the nursery of our seamen, upon whose skill, bravery, and numbers depend the liberty and the standingofEngland among nations.
Surely, then, this is a subject which should excite some interest. Is it too much, or is it impolitic, as smacking of protection, to say that the Legislature should have a jealous regard for the welfare, moral and physical, of seamen as a class? The general argument now-a-days is, "Yon must not look to Government, you must govern yourselves; let abues alono, and-somehow or other-they will correct themselves." Extend the argument ad infinitum, and the functions of Government cease altogether.
What is the present condition of our mercantile marine t Our carrying ships, as a whole, I believe to be the best in the world; not always the most sightly-although among them are to be found the handsomest and most perfect models that swim the seas; not generaUy in good orderalthough we have merchant ships, and a goodly number, as clean and smart as frigates The ordinary run of English merchantmen have a dirty, slovenly, untidy appearance, andin foreign ports may generaUy be distingui6hed by these characteristics. But almost all English-built vessels ar faithfuLUy built, carry larg cargoes without damaging them and, at all events, in these htter days sail fast enough. It has been said that the masters of English vensels are " the most ignorant, and frequently intemperate, as a class of aU nations." If I remember rightly, some years ago 27w Times was the vehicle of complaint on this head from our Consuls abroad. It is a very sweeping and disgraceful charge, and I wish that I were competent to disprove it, or to treat it upon its merits It is too large a question, however, for any individual to venture to-dogmatize upon.
I have had many opportunities in " foreign parts," when serving as a magistrate, of forming an opinion upon it, and I regret to add that there is too broad a foundation for the assertion, although I believe the converse holds good, that in the English merchant servioe are to be found men of character, inteligence, and gentlemanly deportment, only to be equaUed by their consummate skill Ua samen. Probably, as a class, the English merchant naval officer, seeing the very responsible office which he fills, is very much below the standard in qualification and character which should be requiredof him.
Without converting the hard-working, practical merchant officer into a dandified gentleman, with or without a " national uniform," much might be done to raise his socia stus, and until that is done I don't think we can look for any material improvement. The sum of attainments which a commanding officer in the merchant service ought to possess, and before long must posse6s to keep pace with the times Is not a smaU one. To an accomplished merchanb officer a competout knowledge of three or four sdonces is essential, and no learning Will be without its use; and, to fit him for his post, not only should he be acquainted with all that relates to his owrn particular profession, but he must be a man of business, and ought to possess the highest attributes of moral character. No man is plaoed in a position of higher personal responsibility than the commander of a passenger ship. Surely, the qualifications of such a man should entitle him to tho recognition of a professional social 8tatu. The duties he is called upon to perform are surly of as high an order as those of the solicitor or apothecary; are they not higher ? Elevate the noble calling of the seaman ta the dignity of a profesdon, carrying with it the distino tive appellation of " gentleman," and you will import into it at once the same class of intelligent educated men that now starve as lawyers, doctors, &c, rather than " lose position." The pay of an able seaman, taking his food And lodgment into account, is equal to that of a curate. A man may be in command before he would have passed the col. lego and commenced his uphill career. The pay of a commander in the merchant service is sometimes very poor, but seldom under that of a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, while in respectable employs it is frequentlY beyond that of an admiraL Probably 2001. per annum would be a low average for a foreign-going ship, from which up. wards there are all gradations. A large class of commanders are also part-owners, and lay the foundation in early life of fortunes as extensive shipowners. We now turn to the seaman (Jack Tar), his character and condition, embalmed in novels as the soul of fun and frolic, generosity, thoughtlessness, and daring; neat in his dress, devote to his Queen aud country. Some say that such a description may hold good of a man-of-wars man, under light discipline, but that the merchant seaman of these degenerate days is generally no seaman at alL Dirty, drunken, disrespectful, insubordinate, are the adjectives generaUly ooupled with his name. From a long experience and a very deep interest I have taken in the subject, I am afraid it nmust be admitted that such, more or less, are the characteristics of merchant crews generaUy, and the fault lies mainly with the officers and owners, Although doubtless, the early training of the men is generaUy of thv worst, and there is a large leaven of those desperate characters who take to the sea as a last resource.
In an Indian port I have known the entire crew of almost every ship strike work and go to gaol rather than remain on board to deliver the cargo; some on the plea of
bad provisions, others of ill-treatment. It cannot be denied thlat, as a rule, the seamen are infamously
lodged in a small stifling forecastle, ill-ventilated, and filthily dirty. Here the men are crowded together for months in a state of wretchedness which would occupy too much space to describe more in detaiL Frequently the
provisions put on board are inferior in quality and badly cooked, and, grog not being allowed, Jack's creature com-
forts, it must be admitted are considerably below par. Add to this the real bard worl and exposure of a sailor's life, and the abuse and ill-treatment which he too frequently meets with from his officers, and it is not to be wondered at that he does grow], and that so little care being taken of his interests he neglects those of his employers.
There are, of course, ships in which the seamen are well
lodged and wel fed, with good offioers over them, and in such ships the men are, as a rule, all that conld be desired.
Seeing the wonderful improvement that has taken place in the condition and the conduct of the seamen in the Royal Navy, I venture to hope that shipowners generaUy may be induced to pay more attention to the interests of the seamen who toil for them, with which, even in an economic point of view, they may rest assured their own are inextricably involved. t does not appear to me altogether Utopian to hope that the day may come when a seaman, who is to spend 12 months on board a ship, sball hxve his " home" roomy, well ventilated, and well Lghted; his provisions, including pure water, of good quality; and if these conditions were rendered imperative by law, under the certificate of a surveygor, I do not think there would be any undue interference
T he remarks in this letter have reference to the foreign
trade only; they would obviously be inapplicable to the coastmg trade, which employs quite a distinct clas of
If there he any justice in the views I have ventrecd to propound they may possibly recive the support of others; many case I must apologiae for venturing to tronuble von at
