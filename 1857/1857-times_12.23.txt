RAILWAY AND MINING SH BVS Tuesday Evening. In the railway-market there has been a general reaction, especially In Midland, from sales for realization by operators for the rise. Towards the close there was a partial recovery in sympathy with the funds, but the final quotations were in most cases i to i per cent. lower than yesterday. Great Western exceptionally improved, being repurchased to some extent to close speculative accounts. Indian shares continue in active demand for investment; Canadian 'were flat, Grand Trunk declining I per cent.; the debentures however, again advanced. French descriptions were heavy, except Northern of France, which left off 5s. higher; Pernambuco and West Flanders improved, while the other small foreign lines showed a slight reduction. American securities and mines were dull, and without change of importance. Canada Government Bonds were firm at the late advance. Joint-stock banls were steady, and a fractional rise occurred in Bank of Egypt and Ottoman. In rmiscellaneous securities AuLstalian Agricultural improved 11., and National Discount were slightly better.

STATE OF TRADB. MANCHESTER, DEC. 22. People are complainng that the market reports of the newspapers generaly are drawing too gloomy a picture of the state of affairs. " Thi;ngs are better," has been a cry not unfrequently heard from time to time for several weeks past, but we hear no confirmation of this assertion among men really acquainted with the market and in a position to speak with some authority on the subject. The rise in the cotton-market since Friday has been fuly id. per lb., and spinners have asked a corresponding advance here this morning, but it has been unattended with success. There has been a limited business in 30Ms to, 50's mule yarn for India, but at prices fully as low as any accepted lat week, and in some few instances eveu lower rates have been accepted. IRather more business has been done in warps and cops, but at very low prices. For the Mediterranean and Germans markets somne small orders have been placed where goods have been pressingly required. Not only is there no present prospect of improve. ment, say sellers, but trade is quite As bad as on any pre. vions day during the present crisis. In cloths also prices are quite as low va tthey 'were last week, and there is more difficulty in seUing. In this branch the market has evidently not responded to the rise in the raw naaterial at LiverpooL Sellers report that they could do more business, but it could only be done by a more ruinous sacrifice in prices. We hear of the failure of six or seven manufacturers today in the neighbourhood of Burnley, Edenfield, and! Blackburn, but they are mostly small concerns. This was to be expected. So soon as the great storm had passed over us, overwhelming some of the greatest mercantile firms in the country, it might reasonably be expected we shonld have a backward wave sweeping away some of the weaker manufacturers, who had only just survived the first shock, and had been workinag to the full extent of their capital. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report:- " Oving to the easier condltion of the money-market, and the core sequent advance in the pries of Cotton, there has been less anxiety to eeU than has been the csae for the last week or two, indeed, l --ome fev instances, wvhere nanufacturers asse nuder contract, a sU2ht advanoe has been askced. 8o far. howve, we do not ind tbe slghtest msm,ovemeni in the demand for goods, a nd the othe buezuea of lhe day has consequentl been but small. To effect sales to an moderate ex. teot a coonctlon on tile pricee ot Tuesday last wvould have to bs ssb. muted to." ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~bvet b sb Messrs. George Fraser, Son, and Co. report:- " Our marwet to-day has again been dull, and the improveenit in yesterday's cotton-martet is not In anv degree Iresponded to. Yars continue relatirely mere depressed than piec goods, but all rem'la dull of sale." LEEDS, DEC. 22. The general features of the cloth-markets here to-day have been the same as those of Saturday last. Purchases are confined to small parcels of goods that are wanted for itnmediate use or to make up stocks, and to lots that can be bought below the regular market price through the necessities of the holders. Altogether more goods have been sold than on this day week, but the same degree oE caution is usead on al sides. The weather is still open, and the temperature much higher than usual at this period of the year. Hence winter goods hang heavy on the hauds of the retaildealers, and Little disposition is manifested by eithdermanufacturers or merchants to enter upon the sprng EUDDERSFIELD, DEC. 22. There has been a fair attendance of buyers in the market this morning, and, considering the character of the season and the prevalent depression in the manufacturing districts as much business has been done as conld be expected. Lo;; woollen cloths and cheap trouserings have been purchased to a fair extent, and there have been inquiries about new goods for the spring trade. Altogether the market has presented an Improving aspect. Both the advices from the United States and those from Hamburg are of a more cheering character, as is also the position of the money-market at home; and hence it is anticipated that there will soon be an increase of demand for the manu. factures of this district. Wools are without chasue hi price, and not mueh is doing in them. If the recent`stops pages of wool and worsted houses at Bradford and Halifax should be followed by windings up, a good deal of wool will probably be throw n on to the market, and some declension in price will probably fellow. In consequence of their, accounts requiring for examination more time than was anticipated, Messrs. S. C. Lister and Co. have postponed the meetingof their credits from the 23d to the 29th inst.
FORBIGy INTELLIcGBACE. FRANCE. klf"UM UR OW o COMMPONqiM) [A portiozi of the following appeared in our second edition FARIS, MO'DAY, Dso. 21, 6 .r. The Frencs hips of war intended for China, the departure of which has been delayed for some days, will ilfromToulonbetweenthe2othand 25th inst. They 'will proceed direct to Hongkong with 550 troops on board. This force, it is said, will not be increased for the present, and the projected expedition to Ccchin China appears to be adjourned. Some of the papers have announced that the affair of the Suez Canal was to be submitted to the Paris Congres,. It is hardly necessary to say that there is no truth in such a statement, and there is every reason to believe that Lord Palmerston is as much opposed as ever to the project, and that the Charge d'Affaires at Constantinople will not be more in favour of granting the firman. than his chief. The elections to fill up the vacancies in the Legislative Body are very likely to be postponed till the month of March next. It is not said whether any new electoral circulars will be issued by the Minister of the Iuterior. The Council of State meets on Thursday next at the Tiileries, under the presidency of the Emperor, -to discuss the proposed measure of the assurance agriole. On Wednesday the Institttt, in virtue of the gracious permission granted to that body to name its own officers, meets for the purpose of .appointing a librarian. An engineer of the Royal Neapolitan navy is at present visiting the ports of France with the view of studying the various systems of screw propellers. The Pope, it is said, has addressed a letter to the Minister at War, thanking him for having, taken the trouble to examine and correct the plan for fortifying Civita Vecchia. The third volume of M. Capefigue's work, the .sstoriv of the Great Financial Operatios in Burope has just appeared. It gives many particulars relative to the public loans which have been made in European States from 1815 to 1852. England occupies a considerable space, and various details are given about the origin of the houses of Baring, Hope, Thellusson, and Rothschild. hIhe commercial situation of Paris is not wor8e since I wvrote last on the subject; indeed, matter3 are rather improved since it has been ascertained that the bills due on the 15th inst. have been paid. The " feeling of absolute delight" expressed by the Pays at the state of commercial and financial aflairs in France is simply absurd. The Ministerial organs are always in extremes; they no sooner get the order to say sornething to tranquilize the public than they fly off into transports. It is true that no failures of a serious description have occurred, btit this is attributable, as I have already observed, to the comparative timidity of speculators, who are to the English and Americans what the ancient navigators, creeping along the shores of the Mediterranean, were to the bold rnariners of later times. An uneasy remembrance of 1848 still clings to them, and, though tranquillity and order now prevail throughout France, yet it is but one firm hand that maintains it. The crisis is not felt with much severity, because men are not venturous, and they have ever in their thoughts the uncertainty of human life. Be this as it may, the engagements for the end of the year are said to be comparatively light, as the Paris bankers arrange that the payments shall be made either before or after that period, with a view to avoid difficulties in closinlg their accounts on the last day of the year. Vith respect to the commercial bills falling due on the 15th of January, it is evident from the last monthly return of the Baok thatthey are light as compared with those that fall due in December. It is expected-indeed, it is aflirmed-that the Bank will give facilities for the renewal of such bills as the acceptors may be unable to meet. The returns show that money is not scarce in Paris, but clearly it is not in the hands of the trading classes of the community, for the warehouses are overstocked with merchandise, for which there is but little demand. Etitherto there has been tightness in the money-market and embarrassment; the tightness is relaxed, but the embarrassment following the difficulty of realizing sales still continues. Itwill require some time yet before trade is restored to its former condition. Several persons are of opinion that trade has suffered quite as much from the measures adopted tokeep goldinthecountry as anything else, and that the caution exercised by the Bank was carried too far. They refer, in support of their views, to the fact that while the Bank of England maintains the rate of discount at 10 per cent., that of France has gradually reduced its own rate to six, without inconvenience or diminution in its stock of bullion. Some remarkable variations are observable during the past week in the price of many articles of produce. Cotton, sugar, and rape oil have faUen. Spirits have risen since the publication of the Imperial decree imposing an additional duty of 25f. the hectolitre on foreiga brandies. TaUow has also risen. Wheat and flour have declined. The factors at the Paris market entered on Saturday 3,GS3 sacks of first quality for delivery within 30 days, at prices varying from 4Gf. to 55f. the sack of 156 kilogrammes, and 3,024 sacks for bakers' use. Flour of the four marks was offered on Saturday at 51f. 50c. the sack, but there were no buyers. There was no variation in the price of wheat. Rye was offered at a reduction of 60c. the hectolitre. The rates are 18f. and 18f. S0c. for superior quality. Barley was likewise offered at a reduction. Barley from Nogentsur-Seine is quoted at 17f. 50c., and from Chamnpagne at 17f. the 100 kilogrammes. There is a better demand for good oats, but inferior are unsaleable. Oats from the Beauce and Brie are quoted at 31f. the 150 kilogrammes. The War Department on Thursday adjudicated on tenders for the supply of corn and forage required for the supply of the garrison of Paris, to be delivered between the present time and the end of January. The quantity of wvheat amounted to 34,980 quintals. The highest price was 23f. 90c., and the lowest 23f. 47c., the average being 23f. 76c. The quautity of oats was 3,600 quintals, at an average price of 21f. 42c. The quantity of hay was 2,500 (quintals, at prices varying from I of. 60c. to 10f. S8c. the 100 kilogrammes; lucerne, 1,000 quintals, at from 9f. 74c. to 9f. 90c. the 100 kilogrammes; straw 5,800 quintals, at from 4f. 70c. to 4f. Sc. the 10L kilogrammes; barleymeal for the cavalry, 500 quintals, at 18f. 80c. the 100 k-ilogrammes. An adjudication for the supply of oats, hay, and straw for the barracks at Versailles and St. Germain took place at Versailles on Friday. A tender for S,500 quintals of travw, to be delivered at Versailles at 4f. 46c. the 100 kilogrammes, was accepted, together with the following :-3,000 quintals of hay, at 9f. 30c. ditto; 1,500 quintals of lucerne, at8f.80c.; 4,000 quintals of oats at22f. thelOOkilogrammes. The supplyfor the barracks at St.Germain wasadjudicated at nearly the same rates. Accounts from MarseilUes state that the corn-market was dull during the last week, and sales difficult, notwithstanding7the low prices. 4,000 hectolitres of hard African, wheat were disposed of at 21f. 25c.; 5,600 hectolitres from the Sea of Azoff, at 19f. 50c. ; and 800 hectolitres of Polish, at 17f. 25c. The sugar-market was more animated, and crushed lump sold freely at 40f. Silks and cotton were unsaleable, and prices nominal. Spirits, which had fallen at the beginning of the 7feek, rose on the publication of the decree imposing an increased duty. Languedoc is quoted at 11Sf. the hectolitre; beetroot, 95; American, SO. Advices from Bordeaux state that the good wines of the present year are firm, but inferior are unsaleable. Ordinary wines of the present year are quoted at from 400f. to 600f. the hogshead. At Narbonne buyers refrain from purchasing in expectation of a fall in prices. The wine-growers in general maintain their pretensions, but some have yielded, and purchases have been made at 30f. the bectolitre. I Arge orders have been received at Langlade from Germany and flolland for the wine of that country at 40f. the bectolitre. At Nantes the wines of 1856 are becoming scarce, and are worth 52f. the hectolitre.

In official circles it is stated that, in obedience to orders received from St. Petersburg, the Russian Minister at Naples has again advised the Neapolitan Government to mnake its peace with the WVestern Powers. The well-meant counsel was, however, completely thrown away, for M. Caraffa remarked, that as Naples had given no offence to the great maritime Powers there was no reason why she should humble herself before them. As a matter of course, the stereotyped phrases of "unjustifiable meddling" " violatiou of sovereign rights," &c., vwere freely employed by the Neapolitan Minister for Foreiga Affairs. The monetary and financial crisis is far from being at an end in Austria, and during the last day or two very many applications for assistance have been made to the Credit Bank. Among other persons who asked for help were a respectable Trieste merchant and a great manufacturer in the Southern Tyrol, and tbhre is reason to believe that both of them received the required accommodation. Some Berlin correspondents have stated that the Vienna Credit Bank has Hamburg bills in its possession of the nominal value of 40,000,000 marks banco, but they are in error. That the institution in question was in connexion with several Hamburg firms is a fact, but it is not likely to suffer serious loss by any of them. The port of Malamocco, which not long since had but 14 French feet of water, has now above 22, and for this improvement the Venetlans have to thank the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian. When the counter-dike or dam is completed the depth of water will be such that the largest merchantmen will have no difficulty in getting the port. Efforts are being made by Government to break the force of the " Bora," and there is little doubt that they will eventually be crowned with success. The mountain " Nanas," which is called " the father of the ' Bora,"' is nearAdelsberg, in Carniola, and the violence of the wind is to be diminished by means of the trees that have been planted on the Karst Mountains, which lie between the Nlanas and the sea. Walls have been built for the protection of the young trees, which are growing apace. It would appear that Lord Stratford was somewhat fatigued by his passage from Constantinople to Trieste, for he does not intend to leave for Vienna until the day after to-morrow. There was a marked improvement on Change today. RUSSIA. (FROM OUlr BRLTN- COiImESPoNDExTr.) BERLLN, DEC. 20. In the first half of November General Mouravieff, Governor-General of Eastern Siberia, arrived in St. Petersburg; he had only in the previous September returned to Irkutsk from a long journey of inspection in th* district beyond the Baikal Lake; and lette.. i,nm Irkutsk state distinctly that his visit to St. Petersburg concerned important official matters connected with his post of Governor-General of East Siberia. The civil and military arrangements of that district had formed the main subject of the General's conferences at the Rome-office during his visit to St. Petersburg last year, and if, therefore, the further development of a military organization along the lately annexed territory of the Amoor were among the subjects of his consultations this year also, as we are told it was, we may safely conclude that commercial and frontier arrangements nevertheless occupied a prominent position in them. We can hardly go far wvrong in assuming that the two main objects of the recent journey of inspection in the Amoor territory and the subject of the subsequent conferences in St. Petersburg were the opening up of commercial intercourse with America by means of the Amoor, and the fixing definitively the course of action to be observed in the approaching annexation of a large portion of the Mongol territory as soon as hostilities shall break out with China. What great facilities there are for such an annexation I showed in my yesterday's letter. A few weeks after General Mouravieff's arrival in St. Petersburg we read of his having obtained a short leave of absence for a journey abroad; and since then, I think, we heard of his arrival in Paris, which, if correct, will be highly noteworthy, when taken in connexion with the aspirations we hear and read of in the press of French co-operation in a general attack upon the Chinese empire. Towards the close of the month of November there also arrived in St. Petersburg General Korsakoff, the Feldabaman of the Transbaikal Cossack force, and this visit, likethat of the above-mentioned General Mouravieff, was understood also to have reference to the coming eventualities on the Southern frontier of the Transbaikal district. Taking the above in connexion with the contents of my yesterday's letter and the line of argument adopted in the very frequent articles on Chinese and East Indian matters to be found now in the Russian press, there can be but little doubt that Russia is meditatincg a stroke against China,-either an armed one in cooperation with one or more of the great Powers, or a quiet piece of annexation all by herself. In a further article which the St. Petersburqer Zeitunli has published in reply to your recent remarks about the inevitable antagonism of England and Russia in Asia, it is said:- " While we readily and wUllingly recognize England's rightful calea to work out her historical mission in Southern Asia, we maintain equally firmly that Northern Asia has been made over to Russia's hands. Russia has, however, in Northern Asia an incomparably more difficult task to accomplish than England in Southern Asia. Siberia is a giant that lies musole-bound in A trance, whose pulse hardly beats, whose breath is hardly drawn, but whose enormous vital powers are awaiting only the moment of waking. The time is now come for us to proceed energetically to work, and call into existence the life that everything is yearning for. On the whole long frontier of South Siberia, from the Ural to the Paoific Ocean, we must have good, safe roads of communication that shall open up intercourso with Southern Asia. The warm blood and the genial breath of the South, the exchange of the ample products of the North for the treasures of the South, the cheerful activity of commerce and industry must Impart to the cold, stiff life of the North motion and increase of population, so that this part of the world may also become the seas of prosperity and civilization." This vision of prosperity and civilization to be conferred on Siberia is justified, to a very considerable extent, bv the progress already made. At the close of last year postal stations had been erected all along the whole line of the Amoor, from Strelotschnaia to Nicholaieff, in which latter place the tinkling of the bell on the post telega was heard for the first time in November of last year, when General Kagakewitsch passed through there with certain officers of his staff to an inspection of troops at Marinisk. In that same month an American ship,lthe Europa, arrived at.Nicholaieff (the military station at the mouth of the A moor, not to be confounded with the Nicholaieff, or ship-building arsenal on the river Bog), having on board tvo iron steamers in pieces, which were put together in that town during the winter, and were named after two rivers in Siberia, Amoor and Lena. The former has 66-horsepower, the latter 35, and draws only 3@ feet water, so that she can ascend the Amoor as far as Ust-Strelotschnala. To these two have been added two other steamers from a buildingyard at Schilka. On its first trip up the stream in July last the Lena conveyed passengers and goods in 30 days up as far as Ust-Strelotschnaia, the point of confluence of the two rivers which subsequently bear the name of Anoor; but it was confidently trusted that when they were more familiar with the navigation of the stream they would accomplish the trip in considerably less time. We hear of the Amoor steamer being, September 2, at the mouth of the Zeja, a tributary of the Amoor, unable to proceed further up for want of water, and having on board 4,350 sable skins varying in value from 6 to 9 silver roubles (a real sable for 18s. to 27s.), and 14 gray fox skins at 16 silver roubles a-piece. In Nicholaieff there had arrived up to July 18 two vessels from Boston, two from Hongkong, and two from San Fiancisco, with goods to thevalueof 382,090silverroubles; some Japanesevesselswerealso expected. In Ajanthere had entered five vessels, and six had cleared out. The jprices of all sorts of goods, which formerly had been excessively high in Nicholaieff, had sunk very much in consequence of the ample supplies brought by these vessels; for instance, sugar fetched only nine silver roubles per pood of 401b., while in Irkutak the same quantity cost 24 silver roubles. The imn porters had, therefore, lost bat little time in sendling their goods up the river, and making a harvest of of the high prices there. A letter from Irkutsk, August 27, states that two new towns in that district, Werchnolensk and Balaganak, had been inaugurated this year. Irkutsk itself was expanding rapidly, and gaining in life and wealthfrom the constant passage through of large numbers of military to join the army in the Trawsbaikal territory and on the Amoor; inns and cafes, with strongly developed Western comforts, were described as having beon thus brought into existence. It is remarkable 'chat no letter or other source of information from Irkutsk gives one any intelligence of what has become of the ecclesiastical mission that arrived there July last on its way to Pekin to relieve the members of the niission that had served their time there; it would seem most probable that the same difficulties thst prevented A dmfiral Putiatin from approachina Pekin from the land side have interfered with the project of the so-called "ecclesiastics." The commercial reports from Kiachta show that the unsettled state of things in China has exercised no unfavourable action on the amount of trade done there in tea this year; the quantities that' have changed hands there amount to 130,000 chests, a larger number than was sold last year. It is possible that the apprehension of a still worse state of things may have driven some stocks into this market which would otherwise have been withheld or offered elsewhere. In Nishni-Novgorod an extensive conflagration had destroyed all the buildings in which thc well-known fair is always held; it was impossible for the inbabitants of the town to make the smallest attempt at saving anything, inasmuch as the river Oka, which separates the town from the site of the fair, was so covered with ice floating down the streama that all crossing was impossible. A report which has been sent in to the Governmeni from Gurien, the last of the military posts on the UIral, dilates at some length on the numerous mines of gold, silver, copper, lead, and coal that are a'ready opened in the Siberian districts occupied by the Rirghises, a portion of which, 600 square versts, is being es'ploitfi by the Russian house POPOW, and according to the statements made in thnis report, if all or if only a portion be true, there is a large source of wealth contained in the bowels of the earth and waiting to be brought to the light of day in that part of Russia. One of the best proofs of the reality of the riches of Siberia is to be fo-tmd in the fact that among the numerous political exiles transported to that part of the world, and t"ho by the recent amnesties were permitted to retnura to their own country, many preferred to remain inthat inhospitable land, not only be:ause it had in the long term of their banishment become a second home to them, while their original home was become strange to them, but because they found themselves there in the best way to acquire riches, &c, Numerous instances were adduced of exiles alreaPy in possession of 5,000 silver roubles, saved frr e profits of their agriculture, hunting, fishing . merce, or mechanical skill. One name lewski was even a large shareholder in works on the Altai, had establish - t.e steam nL. gation on the Ob and the * :, and was a part proprietor of several steamers. To each exile who was desirous o. availing himself of the amnesty to r(,turn home 150 silver roubles were allowed as travelling expenses. ITALY. (FROM OUR OWN COORESPONDENT.) TURIN, DEc. 19. A private letter from Milan takes a very gloomy view of the prospects of cormmercial affairs in that city. It says that the economical crisis continues to rsge there, and that great disasters are expected for the end of the year. The attempt to establish a silk bank is a measure tardily taken, and which, moreover, is very difficult to carry out, under the pressure of a crisis which renders capital hard to obtain. As to the Bank of Discount (Caisse cVBscompte), of which so much has been said, this will be of no avail under the restrictions imposed upon it. In the first place, it cannot be considered a regular bank, because it is not allowed to issue ordinary bank-notes, having constant currency, but only bills or promissory notes at short dates, subject to the stamp, and of these it is not permitted to issue more than are equal to the amount of cash in the coffers of the Bank. The Milanese capitalists and bankers are represented as indisposed to assist in the foundation of an establishment thus restricted and limited, and the very persons who signed the request for the concession declare that unless fundamental changes are made in the institution they themselves will abstain. The plan adopted seems to have been a sort of middle term, intended to preserve untouched the privileges of the NationalBankof Vicnna, and at the same time to appear to comply with the urgent demands of the Lombardo-Venetians. But the expedient results in a delusion, unless (which does not seem by any means confidently anticlpated) the Austrian Government makes such concessions as shall render possible the existence of this ardently desired institution. The following letter, dated Milan, December 15, which appears in to-day's Opinione, is not of a less gloomv tenour than the private one above noticed:- " The difficulties of the present time are very, very great; failures are occurring on a frightful scale, and after those of PaUeari, of Ballablo and Co., of Cighera, of RedaeUi, of Wechler and Msazzola, after the contrecoup of foreign cities, after the suspension of payments by tne best houses of Verona, Venice, Udino, andBergamo, our strongest firms also begin to waver, and to make up their accounts. And the accounts are very sad. Let it suffice to remark that among our great silk houses there is not one that has in warehouse a less quantity than 50,000 pounds of silk, whence it Is easy to calculate that at present prices every one of them must lose from half a milllon to two milions of francs-the stock of some of them exceeding 150,000 lb. The firm of BrambiUa, Brothers, was supported by a loan of one milion and a half of francs; Battista Gavazzl is liquidating, and others are doing the same. Every man asks himself what we have to look forward to ; so many fortunes vanished, so many reduced by one-half: so many families, lately in easy circumstances, now at their last shift; so many workmen without work or bread, or means of subsistence of any kind." The letter concludes with complaints of the heavy taxation and high rate of interest. Here and at Genoa no apprehensions are felt at the approach of the end of the year. The banking and commercial world appears to have acted with much prudence. It is thought not improbable t'nat at the weekly meeting of the Bank of Genoa on Monday next the rate of discount, now at 10 per cent., will be lowered to 9-some say even to S per cent. The Turin papers publish some statistics respecting the late elections, which are not without interest, and which certainly appear to prove the supineness imputed to the Liberal party. In round numbers, the electors inscribed on the rolls of the colleges are 112,500. Of these, in the first elections, only 70,700 voted; 30,300 for Liberal candidates, 27,300 for Retrogrades, while 4,000 votes were null or lost. At the second elections, which were for considerably less than half the number of the colleges, both parties seem to have increased their efforts (although the Liberals had roused themselves too late from their dangerous security), and 14,100 voted for the Right and 21,600 for the Ministerialists and Left. It is worthy of note that the number of electors inscribed has increased by 22,000 since the last elections, in 1853. This is a good Bymptom, as showing an augmentation of zeal for the exercise of the rights conferred by the Constitution, but, on the other hand, there seem grounds for suspicion that not a few persons are inscribed as voters who either never possessed, or have ceased topossess, the proper qualification. The Liberal papers declare that the clerical party has been largely indebted to such unqualified electors, and demand a severe revision of the electoral lists. The Opinione estimates parties in the present Chamber to be thus divided-129 Liberals of all shades, but including very few nltras, and 76 Conservatives, consisting of the extreme Right or clerical party, and of the Moderate Right. It is, however, rather too early to make an estimate, since there are to be, in all probability, 30 or 40 newelections-some persons say more. In anticipation of these, the clericals, as I learn, are already working nard. The Chamber did not sit yesterday. To-day will probably be discussed some of the elections against which there are protests, possibly also the question whether canons can be Deputies. Canons, when elected, have in former Chambers been allowed to sit, but it has always been considered an open question whether they were entitled to do so. To-morrow, being Sunday, there will be no Chamber, and on Wednesday and Thursday the Deputies will separate for the recess. It seems more than doubtful whether the verification of the elections can be concluded before Christmas. Some persons think it possible, but the Chamber sits only four hours a-day, and some of the disputed elections will probably give rise to long discussions.
TRE MEDITTRRABNAN. The Peninsuar and Oriental Company's screw steamship Sultau, Captain Neil Cook, arrived at Southampton yesterday, at 3 p.m., on her return from Alexandria, whither she had taLson out a number of troops for conveyance to IndiaSbe left Alexandria on the 6th inst., Malta the 10th, and Gibraltar the 15ib. On the outward voyage the Sultan mot ilith light winds and fair weather; Homewards, in the Medaiterranean, sbe experienced moderate easterly breezes and fine weather. From Gibraltar io Caps Finisterre, light winds and fair weather; across the Bay and up Channel, fresh north-westerly and westerly breezes, with squally weather. Sbortly after leaving Gibraltar some portion of the Sultan's machinery gave way, and she had to perform tha remainder of the voyage under canvas. She has brough' home seven stewards from the Simla steamship, 2,360 bales and 100 cases of silk, and 45 packages of sundries, but no specie. The fleet of Admiral Lord Lyons was at Malta on the 10th inst. The screw-steamer Abeona, with the 94th Regiment on board for India, passed Gibraltar Garrison on the afternoon of the 14th, the wind at the time blowing strong from the eastward. The Lady M'Naughten, hired ship, which took out con. victs to Gibraltar, was loading Government stores on the 15th, and would take in a number of ticket-of-leave men from the establishment there and convey them to Deptford. The Dutch steam-frigate, Admiral Von Wasfenner, CaptainT. de Vaynis Von Brahil, which arrived at Algeciras on the 12th, in one day frotn Cadiz, left the same night for the eastward, but the wind being too strong she was obliged to anchor off the Orange-grove on the morning of tho 14th, , id still remained on the 15th waiting for the wind to abate to prooeed to Barcelona and Malta. The French steamer Villa de Cadiz, bound for Malaga, was also detained by the same cause. Her Majesty's ship Curlew and the Prussian frigate Thetis were also at Gibraltar. The British bark Fleetwood, Captain H. Allan, from Almerla, bound to Cuba, anchored on the Spanish coast on the 13th. Off Caps St. Vincent, on the 16th, the Sultan exchanged signals with the screw steamer Gibraltar, steering to the south-east.
A PLEA FOR THE POOR. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIBES. Sir,-You bave reminded us that Christmas-day Is at hand, and you have " improved the occasion" with a word jo Paterfamilias. In so doing you havs, with your wonted ability, awakened thoughts which cannot be other than proQitable to their owners; and before these have wholly sub. sded, wili you permit me to trespass so far upon the atten'ion of te publi3 as to invoke its' sympathy in favour of a very conslderable portion of the community, one not men. tioned ir y - varicle, and not likely to oe thought of at this ft;tive: Zn unless some special reference be made to it thro-ugh a medium like i7ie Times? Yt- have aUuded to Christmas "with its good cheer, its family gatherings, and its brlght fires," adding that " in rn.,y a house there will be ample compensation for the gloom without in the brightness within." You havo drawn a plture that wil be recogn ized by many of your readers, e 7en to " the baok-ground of the family pantomime." Yon have likewise thus expressed yourself in reference to those fir whom you were not exercising your powerfal pen, as w el as others in whose behalf you were wielding It:- As Merchant princes and lords of half-counties stand aside. Or words are not for you, who never knew the meaning of petty embarrassments and humiliating cares. Nor do we write for the many millions of industrious artisans and labourers who take life and its obligations by the week. With rogues and swindlers of every degree we have nothing to do, but now address ourselves entirely to the men of small fixed incomes. We are speaking of upright and honourable mnen who have decent exteriors to maintain, and who would zather die than let their little embarrassments be knownnot of the pests who infest society." Yet have you made no allusion to those for whom I would hurmbly intercede, and wiU presently endeavour to point out as worthy a special word. Christmas-day, when it comes, wlll havo in you an eloquent reminder of its duties and its obligations. You will, as you have hitherto done, awaken a thousand memories, and suggest consolation where it will be most wanted. Without pandering to that "hoary impostor," Old Father Christmas, you will give him his due, congratulating those who can welcome him in a time-honoured f ashion, condoling with those to whom his presence wlU be a mockery (for how nany vacant places wiU there be at the firesides of all classes!), and recommending the poor to the Christian charity of the rich. But it is now, before Chrlstmas-day is upon us, before it Is too late to make certain provision for our own happiness and the wants of others on that day, that I would offer a word in season. If Christianity be a great fact, Christmas-day is neither appreciated nor understood among uns. One moment's re - flection will convince any rational being of the truth of this remark. The subject needs no discussion. If Chrlstianity be a fiction, It is not the humblest classes who perpetuate the delusion. The wealthy and well-to-do show most respect for the day-and how? Let them ask themselves where the Saviour was born and for whom he came. For the sake, then, of a common cause, for the sake of associations that are dear to us, and consistently with what we profess as a nation and so many believe in, let there be something more than the selfish sociality and exclusive hospitality that are too peculiar to the day, and let us act more in compliance than we do with the injunctions of One who was in Eimself the greatest and the best example that ever drew the breath of life. Let there be something like an admission, for once in the year, that our faith knows no distinctions and inculcates practical benevolence, "peace and goodwill." The " condescension" would become the highest and the best of us, and it would not be lost upon the humblest and the worst. The prisoner is " provided for"-the pauper wiUbe " taken care o{"-the poverty-strickeo wretch whose very rags plead for him, willnot go sapperless to bed. There will bh eloquent sermons, eloquent petitions, eloquent appeals. Thero will be the beseeching eye, and purple lip, and bloodless cheeks-the clamorous beggar and the street singerParochial boards will be rmoved, and many an individual will fling his gifts broadcast. But what of the poor gentleman and lady? What of the necessitous whose wants are not paraded, and the obscure indigent-hugging their misery as the Spartan boy concealed the animal that devoured his vitals? "The flush and the fair" will provide liberally for themselves and one another. People who have no need of Christmas bounty wiUl get plenty of iS. Presents wil come in hampers to the affluent; tables will ba spread for vitiated appetites; even children will loathe dainties, and pampered menials wiU turn up their noses at choicest luxuries. What a waste there will be ! Poor relations wil be fed to admiration in many instances, and there wil be craving stomachs supplied with good dinners. But to where reverses have fallen, to where pining gentility, particularly of the gerntler sex, economises and starves-to where those who " have seen better days" are dreading the dawning of a day which is to bring them, independently of the bitter realities of the present, saddest recollections of the past, and but little hope for the future, how few will find their way with Christian sympathy and secret aid ! It does not take much to make some people contented and others happy. Tears are often dried and hearts are often lightened at no great cost, and the assurance of having] comforted a feUow-creature will smrely prove a satisfaction to one in whose soul humanity has an abidlng place, whatever be its religious sentimentsIt is the pleasure that " grows upon reflection," and there is tlme for securing it between now and the day whereon everybody is supposed to rejoice. Let but aU who can contribute to the wants of others make but an effort to do so for only one day In the year, and next Christmas-day will see no hunger, and less misery than many of its predecessors have witnessed. "It is much better to give than to receive." "Give freely," says Fuller, " to him that deserveth well and asketh nothing, and that is the way of giving to thyself." And stay not your hand there, for He whom we profess to honour knew no nice distinctions. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. G. M. Vutney.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your article " Mortars and MIortairs," in yesterday's Ti7nes, Is calculated to conveyr an erroneous, and, to me, injurious impression, with reference to the 36-inch mortars. Justice will induce you possibly to permit me to state what A single wrought iron external ring of 9 inches by 3 miches thick, forming part of the ohase of one of these mortars, was discovered to be fractured, after the sixth round with 1OIb. of powder, on the 15th inst., the fracture being through an unsound welding equal in area to about one-half the ring. In no other respect is there anything wrong with either mortar, and this triling aceident will not occupy a week to repair. The Select Committee decided on the moment, that if firing at an enemy they would have continued, as the mortar is not in any way disabled; butthere being no object in running the posstbility of risk to a valuable weapon for mere experimet, they resolved to cease firing the three remaining rounds intended for that day's trials; and however personally desirous to have continued, I quite concurred in the good sense of that determination. If this constitutes the failure of these mortars then you are quite right. Your obedient servant. R. MAALT.TT 11, Bridge street, We8tminster, Dec. 22.

"And in a note delivered to Mr. Plowden by Mrx. Alan on the 5th inst. on the same subject, it was stated that no direct communication had taken place between the Board of Control and the Peninsular and Oriental Company. "- Mr. Anderson, in a letter of the 12th inserted in Vic Times of to-day, admits that there was no such letter, but aserts that ' after al had been finished and the instretions despatched '-that is, the instructions sent by your company to India, founded on an arrangement for the conveyance of troops through Egypt-' a messengercame down from the President of the Board of Control to inquire wbether such an arrangement could be made.' "Mr. Anderson proceeds to say, 'This incident strack us with some surprise;' and the context would seem to imply that the 'us' means MIr. Anderson himself, Mr. Allan, and Mr. Howell, and perhaps others. " In consequence of this statement on the part of Mr. Anderson, I am desired to request that you will inform the President of the India Board what is ronmembered at the office of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company respecting the 'messenger from the President;' whether he gave any name, or in what way it was known, or why It was presumed that he had been sent from this department, what was the precise message he delivered, and on what day he delivered it.

THE WESI INDrES. do-- - TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your Satarday's article on slavery "the philin. tbropists" are assumed to have rained the WestIndles. "Their falsified prediotions and baffled hopes" are dwelt upon, our islands are stated to be "going out of caltivation," and ridicule is cast upon the tales that used to be told of the free use of the whip. Your generous willingness to allow those who differ from you to state their reaeons in your columns emboldens me to place the following bare faots before you. They speak for themselves:- 1. As to the use of the whip. In the four Crown colonles-Demerara, Berbice, Trinidad, and St. Lucia-returnas were made of the number of slaves flogged by the magistrates in the years 1828 adu 1829. That number was 68,92L Taking 20 as tho average number of stripes, this gives 1,380,000 stripes. 25,094 of the persons flogged were females. Had we returns of the flozgings inflicted by overseers or masters-had we returns from the 14 other slave colonies (including the Manritius and Jamaica), God only knows what the amount would have been. Again, in 1829, a motion in the Jamaloa House of Assembly, that "the indecent flogging of females should be discontinued," was rejected by a large majority !t 2. As to the policy of emancipation. The deathblow to slavery was dealt' by the census, which showed that, although the sexes were in due proportion, the slaves were dying off, as it was said, " like rotten sheep." Instead of increasing, they had decreased by 45,800 in 10 years. Emancipation at once turned rapid decrease into more rapid increase.§ 3. Was emancipation too hasty 2 If so, "the phUanthropists" were not to blame. For many years their aim was " not the sudden emancipation of the negro, but sach preparatory steps as, by slow degrees, and in a course of years, first fitting and qualifying the slaves for the enjoyment of freedom, shall gently conduct usto the annihilation of lsvery."1I But when l0 years bad passed and the planters still refused to move one finger to fit their slaves for freedom, then indeed the nation rose as one man, and put down slavery at a blow. 4. Are the West Indian islands "going out of cultivation 9" Far more land is cultivated by the negroes for their own use, though less with a view to export. Yet (though Caban compatition has been let in) their exports were in 1832 6,224,0131. ;** 1854, 4,64,6681l.tt Their imports were in 1832, 3,591,6261. ; 18.54, 3,841,2424 The tonnage of ships from the united kingdom was in 1832, 229,117, 1854, 214,689; besides 351,057 tons of other shipping. That absenteeism, slavery, protection have made the West Indian social system rotten to the coro-that it3 collapse caueed fearful misery, I firmly bel1ive, That a sound prosperity, that Infinitely more happinss, will be the result of the change I also believe. Nor ean any one mora earnestly wish that we should aid the planters by importing labour; but God forbid that we should do so by renewing the slave trade. I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

RAILWAY ACCIDENTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE, TIMES. Sir,-I wrote soon after that dreadful railway accident in Ireland to caU attention to the manner in which life i3 endangered, I might without impropriety almost say sacrificed, by the rule, when a stoppage ococrs, of perversely keeping passengers shut up in the carriages instead of maldng exertions to get them out and free from danger. Sinea that fatal accident In Ireland there has been one nearly as f,tal at Lewisham, and now this at Moreton; in both which cases it was a matter of absolute certainty that the stopping train would be run into by the one that was knImow to be folloviing, and yet no attempt was made to get the passengers into safety; by one of them, at Moreton, getting out of the wlndow, I conclude the doors were locked, which by law they ought not to have been. All railway enperience shows, without I believe one single exception, that if it be required unexpectedly to stop a train by signal in the dark, as at Lewisham and Moreton, It cannot be done. It never has been done in one single instance, The railway authorities prosecute the drlver of the train for no t attending to the signals and often punish him when he Is not a bit to blame, and so throw dust into the eyes of the public. Wben I before endeavoured to call attention to this matter I then said that the unexpected stopping of a train in the dark woulId inevitably lead to its being run into if another should happen to be following it. My words have now been twice verified, and will be Eo again and again. If people under such circumstances wil remain in the carriages they may be pretty certain of being crushed. At Moreton it was dark and foggy. I say again that it was impossible to stop the following train, and that a collision was Inevitable. Not ono person ought to have been hurt either at LewishamoratMoreton. There was, avowedly, plenty of time to have got the passengers out of the oarriages at Lewisham, and a person having got out by the window at Moreton shows that there was time there. I remain your obedient servant. JOHN T. AUSTEN. Do.l. 21. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Might not the frightful collision which took place oa the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway, on Friday night last, have been avoided if the guard had been furnished with blte lights ? As these lights rnay be seen for miles they could not have been overlooked by the driver of the ordinary train if they had been shown by the guard of the speoial train. I hope that you will think this recommendation worthy of notice, Your obedient servant, CRIARLES!E. MArTPc Royal Sail Steam Packet Company, 55, Moorgate-street, Dec. 2L TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-In your account of the accident nearCharlbury the following observations occur- "It is stated that on the starting of the enginefrom Handborough some defect in its working was noticed, and that sometliiig was done to it before it left for Moreton." We do not find that any fog signals were placed on the line by the guard as he advanced, which would have given tbe alarm to the driver of the ordinary train had he not seen the guard's lamp." Allow nme to state that the engine vwas thoroughly examined before starting from Oxford, that nothing was observed amiss at Handborough, and that nothing whatever was done to it at that station before starting for Mloreton. The guard of the train ran back with the necessary lamp and fog signals; at the dlstance of 300 yards from his train he placed a fog signal on the line, and then proceeded forward, but had only advanced about 30 yards when the approaching train passed him. The explosion of the fog signal was heard by the driver, who had previously seen the train lights; he reversed his engine and applied his breaks, but unhappily the slippery state of the rails prevented the train being stopped in time to avoid a collision. Had a furtber space of 100 yards intervened, in all proba. bUity the train wouldhave been brought up. I am happy to say the sufferers are going on favourably. Your fair and temperate account of the accident em. boldens me to hope that this explanation will find a place in your neit publication. I have the hononr to be, Sir, yonr obedient servaut- A. V. 5kiESRRIFF. I - - - General Manaeor ,- .. ws_:;w u VY QMlvMIampton laUway, General Manager's.office, Worcester, Dec. 2L TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-With reference to your account of the so-caUed accident near Charlbuiry station, on the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway, on the evening of Friday lBst, justice to the guard of the train compels me to state at once that, on making my escape through the window of the carriage In which I was sitting, I distinctly heard a fog signal explode, and before the danger vhistle was sounded by the engine-driver of the train that ran into Us.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1857. I'lain men will probably find a good deal of difficulty in getting at anything like a clear understanding about what is termed " commercial "' unsoundness." Of course, trade is umsound when it is carried on without money, on fictitious credit, and by extravagant speculations; but to this kind of disorder there is a very natural tendency. There will always in every country be men who will be only too glad to buy and sell on the condition that either they win or somebody else loses. The question is, not how such bargains become popular, but how they become possible? What ham enabled persons to trade unsoundly? No man, whatever may be his natural temerity or desperation, can " speculate" or " over-trade" without abase of some sort for his operations. If he sends 100,0001.worth of goods to America in the hope of doubling the stake, he must have either manufactured the goods or got them from the manufacturer. If he has neither capital nor credit of his own, he must trade with the capital or credit of other people. If his own means are below his own dealings somebodysa means must make up the difference. Where, then, in all the recent overtrading did the money come from ? That seems about the first question in the business. The money, says common report, backed by general belief, came from certain Joint-stock Banks. Very good; but how came these establishments to deal' so recklessly? The ultimate source of their funds, over and above ordinary trading capital, was the system of deposits. Persons possessed of a few pounds carried them to an institution which offered a high rate of interest and a return of the money upon call, and the accumulation formed by these little streams was enormous. In Scotland, especially, the savings of the -whole community appear to have been poured into Joint-stock Banks, to be issued again as the means of trading. Among the depo3itors in the Western Bank. of Scotland were no fewer than 26,000 whose deposits averaged lesx than 201. each. Capital, in fact, was formed by universal contributions received in Joint-stock Banks, and distributed from these reservoirs among applicants demanding it for the purposes of trade. But in sueh a system there ought to be little harm. Nothing can be more desirable than that the small earnings of the tradesman or artsan should be permitted to fructify as well as the possessions of the capitalist. Trade is a process for multiplying moniey, and if a trader can perform this process for the money of another person the profit is fairly divisible between them, and advantage accrues to both alike. Capital and enterprise are made available together, instead of remaining stagnant and useless each for want of the other. It has been over and over again a subject of lamentation that investments for small savings should be so few and so unattractive, and that they should so often lie unemployed when they might, if collected, be turned to excellent purpose. A machinery which gives a man 6 per cent. for his little hoard instead of 3, and at the same time facilitates commercial enterprise by providing increased supplies of capital, ought surely to be rather a benefit than a disadvantage to the community. How, then, came the contrary result to pass? At this point we are told that Joint-stock Banks offered a very large interest to depositors by way of attracting deposits, and that, as the profits of the shareholders had ntill to be realized after this interest was paid, a larger rate was necessarily exacted from the trader who borrowed the money for his business. But, exactly as high interest attaches to great risks, so great risks attach to high interest, and the adventures on which money was advanced upon these t.rmzs were naturally speculative, precarioux, and, In point of fact, "unsound." A sound traier would not want to borrow money at such rates as would pay heavy interest to the depositors of a bank first and to the shareholders afterwards. The consequence was that umsound traders became encouraged, and men played for prodigious stakes with the capital of others upon the chances of general enrichment or general ruin. Such is the explanation recently given and commonly accepted of these unfortunate transactions. Put the assertions together, and what do they come to ? Simply to this,-that money has been provided under the temptation of high interest to an extent sufficient to supply unsound as well as sound commerce with the material for its operations. In the whole case, however, as hitherto explained, there is only one feature which is either unnatural or obscure. Men will always be found to lend money at high interest, and also to borrow money at hi,,h interest; the thing which keeps these dealings at their proper level is tiw security. A lender would be very glad of 20 per cent. instead of 5, but if he gets it he must forego his security in proportion; if the borrower can produce adequate security he can get his accommodation at 5 per cent. instead of 20. Generally speaking, prudence carries the day, and the market value of money rules low. How was it, then, in all this business, that so much capital could be found for dealings of a speculative description, and how came it about that in so many instances and to such a great extent the ordinary terms of money-lending were altered, and high interest with large risks made rather the rule than the exception? The answer can be given in half-a-dozen words. Joint-stock Banks are conaucted on the prinI ciple of unlimited liability. Every shareholder is liable to every creditor of the bank to his last acre and his last shilling; and, as the list of sharebolders usually contains many wealthy persons, the security given by the concern is conceived to be all but perfect. When, therefore, a Joint-stock; Bank offers to receive money upon high terms the bargain presented to the eyes of the public is extraordinarily advantageous, for there is large interest without large risk, a plentiful return, and yet undoubted Bafety. Instead of lending 1001. at 3} or 4 per cent. upon a cumbrous mortgage the little capitalist can carry his savings to a bank, deposit the amount there at 6 or 8 percent., and have it returnable at a minu.te's notice. For him, no doubt, thebargain is averygood one, and, a a matter of fact, depositors in Joint-stock Banks, though they may have been afflicted with the miseries of suspense and delay, have very seldom lost their money. But, the ordinary conditions of a money-market having been so far rsuperseded as to connect heavy interest and light risks together, how is the transaction to be squared at last? The bank obtains funds from its depositors on its own good security and at a high rate. In order to make its own profit it must, when employing these funds, ask a rate higher still, and then where is the security to come from ? It is not forthcoming at all. Here the bargain resumes its customary complexion; the high interest charged by the bank is attended with proportionate risks, and the end, according to natural calculations, is a crash. These conrsiderations will indicate clearly enough the particular condition in which " commercial un"Isoundness" has originated. It is in no degree extraordinary that money rshould be provided on good security; it is perfectly natural that it should be accepted on bad security. On ordinary occasions these two facilities could not be easily dovetailed, as the bad security would not attract the money; but here are institutions which step in between borrower and lender, and provide, at their own risk, security for the latter and funds for the former. The proceeding appears advantageous, but the result is ruinous. In reality, it cormes to this,-that there has been a competition between certain Joint-stock Banks for disposable capital, and that capital has thus been pushed on the market in order to make it remunerative to the first borrowers. The persons originallyfinding the money which fed all these speculative adventures were relieved by the intervention of the banks from looking to the ultimate nature of the transaction; the banks being invested with such an unlimited hold on every scrap of their shareholdera' property could find abundance of contributors, and traders willing to promise any rate of interest could thus obtain capital for any kid of trade. The " overtrading," in sbort, has been in money itself. The first question in the business is also the last. The Liverpool Chamber of Commerce discerned the truth some time ago, when it represented the remedy as lying in the hands of those who provided funds; and as the CHAixrcnx1on of the ExeHEQuER!s Committee is to inquire into the law of unlimited liability, by the operation of which Joint-stock Banks are fed, we trust that the true sources of "commercial " unsoundness" may be detected and removed.
The regulations of the Staff College at Sandhurst inaugurate a new military era. Whatever may be thought of the details of the new system, there is an end of the dynasty of Generals' nephews. The Duke of CAmBRIDGE has but reccrded a decision at which the country arrived at an early period of the Crimean campaign. The Peninsular heroes belonged to a tolerant age. With universal jobbery at home and abroad, there seemed no reason why merit should enjoy any special privileges in the army. If the Commander-in-Chie. chose to rely on the services of assistants selected for family reasons, it was thought that he must be the most immediate sufferer by their possible incapacity. The army and the public were compelled to acquiesce in the choice of the General; and the evil was more tolerable, as the Duke of WE=IXcToT was one of those chiefs who are comparatively independent of their subordinatea. During the long peace which followed, connexion offered the only channel of introduction to Staff appointment. If a General Officer was appointed to a command, any possessor of a Peerage and an Army ;ist could name the Aides-de-Camp who would accompany him in default of sonx and nephews. When any active service occurred, the favoured nominees were celebrated in despatches and general orders. At the worst they received extra pay for carving at dinner and judiciously poldng the fire. It is true that some of the number were able and useful, and the same reBult would have followed if the Staff had been chosen by lot. It may also be admitted that the influence of patronage on promotion is not an unmixed evil. A friendly superior sometimes discerns merit which might be passed over by indifferent eyes, but to make asystem of nomination tolerable the patrons ought to possess some degree of conscience. The Horse Guards and the Generals who held high commands were as scandalous in their nepotism as the Bishops of the 18th or the Popes of the 17th century. The Cardinal Minister of the Holy See in former times might possibly be a learned prelate or an able statesman, but it was more certain that his surname, whether it was CnrGi, PANFiL, or BARBEnINI, was the same which the reigning URBAN or INNOcE?T had laid aside on assuming the tiara. In the same manner different opinions may prevail as to the merits of Lord RAGAw's Staff; but it was at least a singular circumstance that the five ablest officers in the army should aU be related in the same degree to the Commander of the Forces. The effect of the system on aspirants for Staff employment was precisely what might have been expected. Young officers who repudiated the character of bookworms were nevertheless distinguished by a certain kind of Ingenuous logic. If one of the class was troubled with remonstrances against his wilful ignorance of all subjects, and especially of his own profession, he naturally replied that he could under no circumstances be benefited by the result of painful studies. " My uncle Sir . A B.," he woild xay, " will or wil not be sent in "due time to Malta, to Madras, or to Bombay. "If he goes as General I shall go as Aide-de-Camp; "if not I shall not go at all, The Horse Gu'rds "will look to his interest or merit, and certainly "not to any attainments of mine." The contingency of incompetence first discovered on active service was too remote to affect the calculation. As a veteran Scotch official remarked, every man is competent to discharge the duties of any office which he has interest to obtain. All this is now to be changed. From the year 1860 the whole system of nomination will be swept away. Vested interests are, as usual, protected in the case of those favourites of fortune who may have obtained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel before the appointed day. A more important reservation is also made in the case of officers who display proved ability in the field. With these exceptions, the Staff will henecforth be supplied from those who have paesed the Staff College examination. Twenty-five students are in the first instance to be admitted from the Cavalry, the Guards, and the Line, and five from the Artillery and Engineers. The exclusion of the Marines is probably an official oversight. The admnissions will be determined by a competitive examination in the rudiments of mathematical science and in various useful branches of knowledge. Arrangements will be made for forwarding the examination-papers to foreign stations, where the necessary superilsion vviU be exercised by a board of officers. Candidates must in aU cases have served for three years in the army, exclusive of leave of absence, aud they must also have either attained the rank of Captain or pased the examination for a troop or company. The successful students 'Wi pass through a two year"' course of instruction in the various depart. ments of knowledge proper for a moldier. Mathematics to a certain extent, topographical drawing and military history, fortification, the use of artillery and modem languages, properly find a place in the programme. The resut of a finsal examination, not confined to the students of the College, will be recorded in a classification, according to merit, in three divisions. Those who have pursed the examination wil afterwards be attached, in succession, to the different arms of the service; and, having fulfilled the prescribed conditions, they will even' ually be entitled to aU but exclusive employment on the Staff. There can be little doubt that the new system wil greatly tend to promote the efficiency of the army. Competition, like all other tests of merit, is uncertain; but the future members of the Staff, even if they are not the best offlicers in the army, wiU not be a set of ignorant blockheads. There are qualities which cannot be displayed in an examination-roomn. It might be desirable, as Mr. SWNnY HxRBSR.T observed, to see how a candidate would find his way out if he were pounded in a smaU enclosure. The Staff College properly supplies instruction in the art of riding, but the regulations fail to notice the only competitive exaraination which in the form of a steeplechase has hitherto been popular with the army. The difficulty of assigning to the horse and to the rider their respective shares of merit may posibly have led to the apparent anomaly. The restriction of the competition to officers of a certain standing in the army is preferable to the French system of an open examination for admission to the Military College. Regimental experience will be useful to the future Staff officer, and the prospect of a more ambitious career -wil tend to check the frivolity which too often characterizes the junior ranks of the army. Reprobates and idlers, even if they have no aspirations to Staff employment, will feel it a stigma to be excluded from competition by the impossibility of obtaining the requisite certificates. Sir GEORGB BROWN, in his evidenoe before the Army Purchase Commission, declared that he had found no difficulty in obtaining the aid of competent officers for any duty which might be required. But, although the army might contain skilful draughtsmen and tacticians, there was no reason to expect that they would be found on the Staff. The new system will provide for the presence at head-quarters of men Who can survey, reconnoitre, and plan as well as fight. The merits of the project will be measured by the panic which it v'ill create among the privileged orders in the lower ranks of the army. Meanwhile, the happy Lieutenant-Colonels will look back with a complacent shudder on the accident which saved them from sharing the fate of thelr friends and relatives. The country is fortunately supplied with a batch of ready-made Adjutants and Quartermasters-General, who will serve for some years as a safeguard against any precipitate improvements. Merit, as Sir GEoRo( BROWN said, is another word for family or Parliamentary influence, and the established ornaments of the Staff are in this sense without exception highly meritorious. Experience Will suggest improvements in the details of the scheme. Even at the outset the subjects of the primary examination will, perhaps, be found too limited to admit o0 an effective competition. They wil at least be ill adapted to test the merits of Engineers who have attained their commissions by passing an examination infinitely more severe. The proportions respectively allotted to the Ordnance Corps and to the Line seem to be arbitrarily fixed. As Staff officers are to be eligible for employment in trigonometrical surveys, the Engineers seem fairly entitled to a reciprocal advantage. At the termination of the course a division into classes would be sufficient without the invidious distinctidn of an arrangement according to individual merit. The authorities may be trusted to make a safe choice among qualified candidates, and the highest place in the class-list would not neeessarily belong to the most efficient Brigade-Major. In the meantime, there can ba no doubt that the certificate of an examiner offers a better security for fitne3s than the nomination of an uncle.
Ladies about to marry distinguished foreigners without too much knowledge of their character and previous history would do well to read aU about the Count DrS WAs7xowsizi and the Hon. MARY JoxNs in our impressioL of yesterday. The mania for interesting ref-agees with melancholy faces and luxuriant mustachios is somewhat oa the decline. Time was when it was sufficient for a refugee-every penniless foreigner was a refugeeto proclaim to the world that he was a Count, a Duke, or a Princea, and straightway the hearts of all the young ladies for ten miles round glowed with a noble ardour to pour balm upon the wouvnded spirit o' that banished lord. The ostensible sorrow requiring relief was, of course, the patriot's deferred hope. " Had it gone well with thee, "oh, my country! but on JARNosBoFFKYs's "fatal day Humanity's sacred self w7s stabbed "through thy noble side !" The end of these t;rades generally was, that the CORIOLANUS of Leicester-square ran off with a great-coat or the daughter of the house, or borrowed a small sum, which it would have been monstrous to ask him to return when the money-market was so tight. Upon such a very probable contingency as the suicide of the Ermperor of AuSTRIA and the Russian CzaR upon the same day, or supposing that some of the great " Nationalities " threw off their fetters, your dirty friend of Castle-street would recover possession of 270,0001. a-year. He would then not only repay his debt, but would entertain you in his own country in such a manner as would evince his gratitude for your sympathy with him in the hour of his calamity. This kind of thing, however, told more among women than men. Misfortune and a title constituted irresistible claims to tbe favour and good will of the fair sex, and, as distinguished foreigners such as those of whom we are speaking could draw upon their imaginations for their misfortunes and their titles, it was their own fault if they were not en regIZ with romantic young ladies of every degree. We are about to quote an instance of this kind, although we must do the lady the justice to say that when she discovered her error she acted with the most exemplary courage and good sense. She had been duped and deceived; that was a misfortune, it was no disgrace; but when she discovered her error MIiss JoNEs appears to have had the discretion to put herself at once in the hauds of her solicitor, and, as the natural consequence, WAsZEOWSRi was instantly annihilated. Before proceeding with our brief abstract of the tale we would however say, that in helping to give publicity to such facts we do not intend to cast the slightest slur upon the many hundreds of honourable aud respcctab'e men who, having been driven by political events from their own country, are living quietly armong us and earning their subsistence by honest industry. These men's misforttines are never heard of at all ; they do not seek to iuveigle any woman into marriage, or to thrust themnselvei forward as the representatives of a fallen nation, buit bear their sad lot with a cheerful fortitude which is above all praise. The Hon. Miss MATRY JONPS, a lady 42 years of agc, occupied apartments at 74, Ebury- strest, Pimlico. In the same house there resided a noble Pole, who styled himself the Count DB WASZKOWSEI, and gave himsef out as the son of Prince WITTGEN5TEIN. He was 28 years old. This Polish nobleman calls himielf a professor of science and languages, but in reality he lives by "taking on with "ladies. When he has done with one lady he "takes on with another." The Count i" the most terrible epouseur of the day. He was engaged to be married to the plaintiff in " SwYNFN v. SwVYNFE "`-that was broken off. Then he was engaged for four yeari to a Mis C.qADwrcu, but that engagement also was brought to a premature conclusion by the father upon the occaion of the Count's wishing to borrow 501. Then he proposed for Miss RomsnY, then for her siter, and it would appear for many ladies besides. In fact, the Count got his living by this sort of thing. The manner in which he opened the trenches upon Miss Jo.ns was as follows. -He attacked her maid with bouquets and letters, which were to be delivered to her mistress. AsIlsa JONMS resolved, if poesible, to put an end to the armoyance-so the point was astutely enough put by her coumel-by seeing the defendant, and remonstrating with him upon hIs conduct. This was just. what WAszKowsKi wanted; once admitted, he was sure of victory; he had only to come on in the old style, to rave about his misfortunes-his exile-his noble father-his succession to 40,0001. a-year when that noble father was gathered to his ancestors. Which of the points told most with Miss JoNEs it is impossible for us to say40,0001. a-year is a good round sum,-the lady was 42 years of age, the noble Count but 28,-& result followed. The lady, who had sought the interview to chide, remained to console the defendant. WAszEowsEI, the exile, the noble heir to 40,0001. per annum, was to find rest upon her bosom against the unkindly shafts of fate. As soon as the engagement was entered into, or shortly after,-it was very strange,-the Count's remittances ceased to arrive -with their foreaccustomed regularity. His watch and chain dizapp3ared, and in point of fact he was under the necessity of borrowing 1001. from Miss JoNEs. In return for this he gave her his note of hand; but, ignorant as he was of our laws and customs, he drewr it upon a penny stamp. 'When the question of settlements came to be discussed the lady insisted that aU her money should be settlcd upon herself, to which the defendant objected. His system was, that " Where honour and affection I" subsisted marriage settlements were notrequired." To this maxim in her turn the lady objeeted, and so the marriage was broken off. When the rupture was final and complete the lady wished that the sum of money which she had lent to the plaintiff should be returned to her; but this he was unable or unwilling to do, and so the action arose. The defendant pleaded a set off, the particulars of which included some curious items. In the first place, we fiud that the Count DE WAszKowsKI was not attired in such a marner as gave satisfaction to the lady. Above aU tbiugs, on that day which was to be the happiest of their lives she wished him to look welL Accordingly, by her direction, and at her request, he proceeded to Messrs. Nroor.'s establishment and provided himself with a nuptial equipment at the cost of 101. Again, and before the transaction connected with the wedding suit, the Count had-equaUy at the plaintiff's request-provided himself with clothes from Messrs. DAVrEs to the value of 2 T L Again, there was a charge of 1 51. 1Os. for a guitar bought by the Count for Miss JoNEs, at her request. This guitar, as he himself stated, he had bought in Clerkenwell. "I did away " with the guitar. I refuse to say what I "chave done with it, and I don't mean to tell." This was not enough. A little lower down in the particulars of set-off there is a charge which is somewhat remarkable. "To amount paid t) "pawnbroker by defendant at request of plaintiff "to redeem a watch and chain, the property of the defendant, 211." The defendant, in fact, up to this point takes the charges for money disbursed upon himself and his pleasures or necessities, and coolly carries them to the plaintiff's account. Then an item of a diamond ringforhimself, 151. iSs., follows, and then items of another character. This noble Pole, the son of Prince WrrmENsTEn-, this heir to 40,0001. a-year, for example, coolly charges Miss JONES with the cost of a wedding-ring bought " at her request," 14s. ; with a wedding cake at 21. 2s., with a photograph of his oNvn noble features at five shillings. Suich were the particulars of the set-off pleaded by this dear chivalrous creature in answer to MViss JoN-i's demand for a return of her 1001. NVhen he was put into the witness-box and examined, it appeared by his own confession that he made a trade of this kind of pursuit. His own statement was, that in the Swmynxmatter he got 3001. for the return of the lady's letters. "I have got money from many people; I have had money from a great many ladies," said WAszIowsiEI to the CuTF BA"o.N on Monday Last. "W When I have done with one lady I take " on with another." Will people ever take waining by exposures of this description ? Is it possible that ladies of a certain position in the world, and vho may therefore be supposed to have seen something of its ways, should suffer themselves to become the laughing-stocks and. dupes of men who were probably cooks or couriers-if anything so honest-in their owu countries? It might have been hoped that the increasing habit of foreign travel would have done something in amendment of this form of folly. A very short run upon the Continent, or a mere smattering sort of acquaintance with Continental life, might teach our English ladies that foreign titles-even when genuine-are a very insufficient proof of respectability. The best advice we can give our fair countrywomen for the future, when they come across one of these interesti'lg refugees, is to keep him at arm's length until they have ascertained from one of his own countrymnen of ack-nowledged respectability the history of their new friend and his character.

The appointnient of au Ambas3ador to this Cour' from the Emperor of Rlussia in the person of Baron Brunow may be regarded as a political fact of some significance. The rank of anbassadorhasnotbeen conferred on a Russian Envoy since 1839, when Couat Pozzo di Borgo was succeeded by Baron Brunow. No public man was, perhaps, more anxious to preserve tho long continued amity between England and Russia than Barou B1runow, whose lot it was to be compelled to return from his post on the eve of hostilities. The return of Baron Brunow with the highest rank that can be held by the envoy of one country to another may be regarded as strong evidence of the friendly disposi[ tion of the present Emnperor, and of his just appre[ ciation of the interests of the two oqqutrjes.
AMERICA. LIVERLPOOL, TUESDAY. The screw steamship Kangaroo, Jeffrey comman,der, has arrived from New York, with one day's later advices thau those brought by the Africa, 1250,000 in specie on freight, and 300 passengers. The Now York mails of the 19th, vvhich were to 'have been despatched by the Baltic, would be detamed for the Adxiatic; she would coal immediately -on her arrival out, and leave about the 22d. In the Senate MIr. Douglas hsd expressed his -aseat to the general views of the Mlessage; but as regarded its endorsement of the action of the lecompton Convention he differed in toto. He congratulated the President on the course he had pursued in the matter, and proceeded to show that oJongress could not properly receive Kansas into the Union under the Lecompton Constitution. Not only the slavery question, he said, but all otheramuat be submitted to the whole people of Kansas, as they -are guaranteed to establish all their dome,tic institutions for themselves; and on that principle the 'vhole Constitution must be submitted to ascertain 'whether it meets with their approbation. He also -compared it to the freedom of election in Paris, when Louia Napoleon was chosen, and said that the reaoon assigned why the people should not be allowed to vote on its acceptance was that if they 'lad the chance they would vote it down by an -overwhelming majority. He believed that they 'would ; therefore his objection to force an .obnoxious Constitution upon them. Upon -concluding his remarks there was applause from the galleries, upon which it was moved, but ineffectually, that they be cleared. 1r. Biglee '(Pennsylvania) supported the Conventlon, and ;argued that to keep them out of the Union simply *becauae the whole Constitution had not been subaitted to them would be inconsistent with the doctrine of non-iatervention. The people of Kanaas, he said, had now an opportunity of deciding ,whether they would have a free or a slave State Until they mnade that decision he could not deter-mine his course. These gentlemen continued the -discussion, the former referring to a fipeech the Bresident had made 20 years ago, and the latter .protesting againat its introduction, under the statute 4of limitation plea. Ultimately the furtber consideration of the Message was postponed, and the Senate -adjourned. The House of Representatives having adopted a .propouition of Mir. Houston, of Alabama, that it pro-ceed to the re-election of a printer, with a proviso, selected Mr. Steadmaan by a majority of 32. The members having selected their seats by lottery, then adjourned. According to the Washington correspondent of the New York Herald the Treasury Departnient had suspended payment. Requisitions to the amount of nearly half a million dollars were held in the Department. " This," says the 'etratd, " will doubtless lead to the immediate passage of an Act -authorizing an issue of Treasury notes, in accord- I ance with the suggestion of Secretary Cobb." The same correspondent states that the Government had received accounts of the capture of a slaver by one of Her Majesty's ships; out of 600 slaves 200 were drowned. Advices from Kaneas report that Gencral Calhoun, Provisional Governor, had issued two proclamations-one specifying the mannier of holdiag the electio-n on the 21st inst., for submitting tLe Slavery clause of the Constitution to the people, .and the other providing for the election of State officers on the first Monday in January. It was --understood that Secretary Stanton bad issued a proclamation calling a special session of the Legis4ature, which was to meet on the 7th inst. At a mass convention of the Free State men, at Leaven-worth, on the 27th nlt., it was unanimously resolved -to put the Topeka Government in miotion,and stand .,or fall by it, in case Secretary Stanton shonld decline to convene the Legislature. Affairs in Kansaa 'were assuming a more complicated sbape than ever. It is stated that the President has peremptorily dismissed Robert J. Walker and Frederick P. Sta&nton from the Governorship and Secretaryship -of Kansas. Colonel Richardson, of Illinois, wbo ,piloted the Kansas INebraska BiU through the last -House of Representatives, had been appointed to - succeed Governor Walker, and General Denver, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, would supersede Mr. Stanton. General Denver was in Kansas, and would enter upon the duties of his new office as soon as the special messenger despatched from Washington reached the territory. The cause of the dismissal of Mr. Stanton was the fact of his having issued a proclamation calling a special session of the Lecompton Legislature to meet on the 7th inst. It is stated that various Indian tribes had offered 'their services to the Federal Government in the -suppression of the Mormon rebeUion. Of the movements of Walker the WVashington correspondent of the Rerald says:- -The steamer from Aspinwall, due in New York next Wednesday or Thursday, wvU bring the news that he has -'entered tho San Juan river by the Colorado mouth, and that in conjunction with General Martinez he has attackcd the Costa Ricans at Castillo and San Carlos. Itws stated on good authority that Walker had a perlect understanding, before leaving, with Presidenat MartineaZ of Nicarages, and that the latter invited him back. Also that Senor Yrissarrl, the Nicaraguan minister, was in ,communication with bhim indirectly, and niade the new -treaty vrith our Government, with his knowledge of its pur-port. His forces will be larger than has been suoposed, as other parties have left this country to join himinNicaragus, wherehe will probably muster at once about 1,000 men. 'Besides this a clipper, loaded vrith arms and munitions of wer, left New York some time ago to meet him at an appointed rendezvous. Senors Molina and Escalante are also waiting with axiety to hear from Walker, as tiiey can do nothing here under the present state of things. They think that Yriesarri has teen in communication with Walker for -along time, and that the Administration, as welU as Costa P,ica, has been deceived as to the true position of the .;arties," The New York Times of the 10th inst. says " The meagre list of stock sales at the early board this forenoon denotes the dulness with which the business of the dLay opened. The same feeling-corresponding very nearly with the dissgreeble character of the weather-continued throughout the dealings. Prices yielded ; to I per cent. 'from the sales of Tnesday on the list generaUy, and as much -as 2 to 3 per cent, on IlUinois Central shares, which went down to 86 per cent. After the close of the printed list tho disposition of the general nmnrket was to rather better rates, particularly on New York Central, which, after selling down to 73i, seller 10 days. closed 741 to ' cash; Erie. 1&.6 per cent.; Panama, 92 per cent.; and Reading, 52. At the annual election of directors for the New York Central at Albany to-day MIr. John David Wolfe, of this city, was substituted for Mr. E. G. FaUia, -who decllned serving another term. The selection is one that will prove satisfactory to the great body of the stock''holders. Mlr. Isaac Townsend, the other city director last year, is retained. Several changes are made in the country directors. in the money-market the demand for bullion continues active, and some considerable parcels have been ut p for the Kangarco, for Liverpool, to-morrow, and the ruton, for Southampton and Hlavre, on Saturday. The two -vessels will take out somefhing like $750,000. The shipment by the Africa to-day is $1,691,389. The whole movement from Now York direct for December, as intimated a few days ago, will probably reach $8,000,000, or about §6,000O000 .-at erthe Atlantic shipmentson Saturday last. That shipment about squared the late rcoeipts at this port from Eng3and, and we are now in a fair way of sending as much smore. The shipments may wellbe spared at the present time from this side, and will afford an acceptable proof on -the other side that the debt-paying disposition and ability of .the country are rapidly recovering from the recent blow to -commercW confidence. A few packets more, it is be- lieved, will set the exoebanges all right, and add to the export movement of the great staples of grain and cotton, bills against which are now suffering from the uncertainty of tbe English mariets, and the conse*quent distrust in prices and credlts. The discouut brokers are Savuig a little more to do. There is some new paper akintg outside the dates usually taken at Bank. The term s xaage from 7 to 12 per cent. st Bank there is still a scarcity of prie ahore paper. A number of the banks passed up their Country Currency Six per Cent. Certificates to their disount line astweek, which was the principal cause of -the moderate inorease in the aggregate return. But even those certificates are rapidly melting away, When the country circulation wras assorted at the close of :November the amount represented was $7,940,000. 'This sum total fell to $6,500,000 before the 6 per cent. interest attached, and it is now below $5,000,00. 'The Metropolitan Bank Directors have called in the remaining instalment on their new stock. The Bank of Ne w York Will enake no further call at present. The receiver of the Mfechanics Banking Association will in a few; days pay off the rem aining 50 per cent. due to the creditors of ;the concern." The Harlem Railroad had Issued proposals for a new loan of $750,000. At a meeting of the Associated Banks held on the ,evening of the 9th a resolution was offeredc "that after the 12th inst. all balances at the clearing-house should be paid in specie," which resolution, if adopted, would essentially have been a resumpp tion of specie payments. The banks voting in favour of the resolution were :-Conimerce, Ame- rica l Manhattan, Merchants', eican Exchange, Phcbnix, National, Ftlto, Chemical, G reenwich, Leather M lanufacturer'r , Broadway, Mercantile, lrring-14-.

The Neuw York Cov-er and Ervpuirer says,- " The rates of exchange on England are such as to forbid the sbipment of coin if confidence were reinstated as to the chatacter of bill drawers, butthereis a temporary suspension of confadence to such an extent that coin and bullon are preferred by some as remittances.

IRELAND. THE VACANT SEAT ON .THE BENCH. (FROM O1J: OWN CORESPONDENT.) DUBLIN. TUESDAY M?VrTnOfn Ut course nothing reliable has transpired with regard to the successor in the Common Pleas of the late lAmented Jud,e Jackson. According to gossip, at its head-quarters in the hall of the Four Courts, Mr. J. D. Fitzgerald wiU accept the puisne judgeship and be succeeded in the office of AttorneyGeneral by RMr. Christian, one of the first equity lawyers in Ireland, and in the earlier stages of his professional career an able practitioner at common law. His appointment would be universally popular. With regard to the post of Solicitor-General gossip itself is somewhat at fault. it is necesary that one of the law officers sbould have a seat in the House of Commons, and as Mr. Christian is known to bave an aversion to Parlipmentary life, rumour points to the hon. member for the borough of Youghal, as being one of a lot likely to be advanced to the office vacated by Mr. Christian. For some time past Mr. Butt has given a steady support to the Govermment of Lord Palmerston. Sa&cuders's News Letter of this morning has the following speculations in reference to the probable promotions:- " The vacancy upon the bench in the Court of Common Pleas, caused by the lamented death of Mr. JusticeJaokson, 'will, it is generally supposed, be filled up by the appoint. n,ent of Mr. J. D. Fitzgerald MP. for Enis, the Attorney-General, in which event t1e present Solicitor-General, Mlr. Jonathan Christian, will succeed him as first law officer. There are various rumours as to whonm the vacant Solicitor-Generalship will be given, and among those named in legal oirclcs are Serjeant O'Brien, MP. for Limerick; Mr. Deasy. Q.C., and M.P. for Cork; Mr. Butt, Q.C., and DI. P. for Youghal; and Mr. Lawson, Q.C., lately anpointed law adviser, on the elevation of M:-. Corballis, Q.C;, to the Assistant-Barristership of Kilceuuy. Some doubts appear to be entertained as to wvhether Mr. Fitzt,erald will accept a puisne judgeship, but the general feeling is that he will not let the present opportunity pass, inasmuch as there is no immediate likelihood of a higher vacancy on the bench." Tnll GREAT SLAiDE CASE. The cross-examination of the defendant closed yesterday, so that there is now a faint probability of the release of the jury before Christmas-day.

Tii SBBPFs IN RUSSIA.-The Nord of Saturday publishes the official docunents relative to the regulation of the relations between the Russian landed proprietors and the peasantry. From the Imperial decree, addressed to the Military Governor of Wilna and the Governor-General of Grodno and Kowno, we make the following extracts " To this effect. I ordain to establish from this day a com. mittee of elaboration in each of the before-mentioned governments, and hereafter a generl oommission for the three povernments united. Immediately after tne formnation of the provincial committees each of them will draw up a detailed pln for the amelioration of the existence of the peasantry, taklng for a basis of thelr plans the following conditions:-1. The proprietor preserves his right of property in the old landed estat% but the peasants preserve the plots around their habitations, whioh they have the right of acquiring In complete ownership by purchase, the mnoney payable at a fixed term; they have also the use of a certain portion of land according to local conditions which may be necessary to assure their existence, and to give them the means of satidlng their obligations towards the State and the proprietor. In return for this use the peasants are bound either to pay a rent to the propric ior or to labour on his account. 2. The domestlo relations hetween peasnts and proprietors m-st be so regulated as to guarantee the regular servioe of taxes due to the State, and of servitudes and provincial imposts." The remainder of the decree refezs to general instructions to the various officials engaged in carrying out the directions of the Government on this subieot. The decree, signed by the Emperor Alexander, is dated Tsarskoe-Selo, December 2, 1857. The IVord states that this and other dcouments relating to the same question. and published by our contemporary, were to appear officially in Russia yesterday. INTERESTING SURGICAL OPER&TION.-Dr. Langworthy of this city extracted on Taesday last an arrow from the back of a soldier, lately In the United States' service in New 3exico. This instrament we have examsined. It is of tbin iron, about an inch and a half long and three-fourths of an inch wide at the head, with a tenon less than onefourth of an inch wide, The blade is tapered to a point and the edges made sbarp. The tenon is driven into the head of the shaft of the arrow and bound with sinews. When this instrument is propelled from a bow sprang by a powerful arm it is capable of doing greot mischief. This soldier is a youmg man named I)angerfield, who was stationed at Fort Defiance. Early in September last ho was sent out from the fort with a smaU party to bring In a train which was being harassed by the Apache Indians. While on this duty the Indians made an attack, approaching the soldiers on horseback. at either side in a circuitous way. As Dangerfield raised his muskeat to fire at the Indians on one side an Indian appeared on the other and buried an arrow Into the mascles of his shonlder-blade. His companions seized the sbaft of the arrow and drew it out, but,left the iron head to which we have referred above buried about four inehes deep among the muscles. The wonmd -.s -uffiietne t.e disable the man, and he was soon after disoharged. Having some relations residing here he came to this city to b. oper ted upon. Dr. Lan gworthy made an incision,and by the a1d of two "directors,' with which he guided the shoulders of the iron, he speedily drew out the arrow-head. The point of it was fast in the apinous process of the shoulder-blade. The patient refused to take cbloroform and submitted to the operation with much fortitude, Hle is now doing well and will soon recover the use of his arm, which had en partially paralyzed.-RBchester (U.

Si'mcwE.-Yesterday Mr. Payne held an inquest at the Vestry-hall. Horselydown, respecting the death of Mr. Frederick Kilby, who, as stated in the Mansion-house police rsr"rt yesterday, committed suicide by outting his shroat. The particulars of the case have appeared. The deceased had been charged with having attempted to rob Mr. Stevens, stockbroker, of severalhundred pounds,but the Lord Mayor after hearing the case told him that he left tbecourt without the slightest taint upon his character. Tbe deceased, however, who reside& with his brother In Thornton-street, Elorselydown, was vety much depressed on bis return home, and on Sunday morning-was found in bed with his throat cut.

MONB Y-MARKETand OITYINTBVLMAYio-L-?. ----------- gb- Tuesday EveOlug. The quotation of gold at Parls is about I per mil3e discount, and the ahort exchange on London is 25025 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rated with the English Mint prioe of St. 17s. 10d. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is about 4-lOths per cent. dearer in London than in Paris. At Hamburg, owing to the commerclal derangemnents, no forebyg exchange quotations have been published. The course of exchange at New York on Loondon for bills at 60 days' might in 109 to 109k per cent. for firet-class paper. At the present rate of discount here there is consequently no profit on the transmission of gold from this country to the United State". The funds continue their upward course. Consols for January opened this morning at the closing quotation of yesterday-92J to 93 ex dividend, and steadily advanced to 93g. A number of realizations were then effected, and caused rather a Budden fal to 92i, but the market soon regained its tone, the last official price being again 924 to 93, while after regular hours numerous transactions took place at 93 to i. Bank Stock left off at 217k to 218i; Reduced, 93 to i; New Three per Cents., 93i to a; India Bonds, 30s. to 25s discount; and Exchequer-bills, 5s. to Is. discount. Little doubt is entertained that when the Bank determine to reduce their rate of discount it will be to 8 per cent., and the probability seems to be that even that step will speedily have to be followed by another of a similar kind. Although the state of the market would apparently justify it at once, some uncertainty is expresed as to the movement being made on Thursday next, owing to the desirableness of accumulating a large reserve before the payment of the dividends. There is no question, however, in any quarter that it will be announced before the close of the year. The rebound in Consolx from the lowest point during the pressure in October last has been equal to 74 per cent. The price then touched was 86i, and, the last quotation to-day being 93 en dividend, a difference is shown of 64 per cent. Reckoning the dividend at 31. 10s., this would be increased to 8; but, as the amount of dividend which had aocrued up to the end of October was only 11., the real difference is 74 per cent. The rebound, therefore, has been rather more rapid than that which was witnemed after the panic of 1847. The lowest point then touched was 79i, and by the end of the year there was a recovery to 85i em dividend, which, reckoning 11. for dividend, would give a rise of 7 per cent., or i per cent. less than on the present occasion, although, owing to the prices in that year being relatively so much lower, there was greater room for a rebound. The rate of discount, which on the 25th of October, 1847, was fixed at 8 per cent., was reduced at intervals to 7, 6, and 5 per cent. before the end of the year, and by the 15th of June following it was at 3i per cent. It is expected that the Stock-Exchange will be closed on Satarday next, and that the day wil be kept as a holyday in almost all departments of business. The transactions in foreign stocks have again been unusually numerous, but in some cases the highest prices were not fully maintained. Spanish and Mexican were rather flat. Turklsh, after some fluctuation, left off the same as yesterday. Brazllian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 97k and 96i; for the account, 97, 97k, and 97; dltto, 1829 and 1839, 95i, 95, and 96i*; ditto, 1843, 98; Ecuador Land Warrant, 3i; Guatemala, 53; Mexican, 191; for the amcount, 20i, 194, i, and i; Portuguese, for the account, 444 and 4; Spanish, 41k ; ditto, New Deferred, for the account 25k; Turkdsh Six per Cents., for the account, 96i, 954, and i; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 101; for the account, 1014, i, and 1004; DutchTwo.and-a-Ralf per Cents, 64; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 974 and 97. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Hamburg was lower; Amsterdam and Paris showed also a downward tendency; but the fall in each instance may be attributed chiefly to an absence of buiness. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourne this evening were 67f. 60c. for money and 67f. 76c. for the end of the month, showing a fractional decline. At Hamburg the rate of discount for the best bills ranges between 4 and 6 per cent. According to the private letters from Paris, it is expected the Bank of France will lower their rate of discount to 5 per cent, before the end of the year. About 210,0001. of gold was taken to the Bank to-day. It was chiefly American, but included Eome amounts of Rusian and Turkish. It is understood that at a meeting held this afternoon of the Committee of Joint-Stock Banks it was unanimously agreed to recommend to their respective boards to reduce the rate of interest on deposits to 6 per cent. per annum, and that the measure now only awaits formal confirmation on the part of each establishment to be forthwith acted upon. Tbe measures for the reform of the banking system suggested in the memsage of the American President would be likely to produce good results, but there is little chance of their being carried out. Although they are to a certain extent empirical, they would give a better prospect of safety than has yet been attained in that country. Their adoption, however, does not depend on the wM of the Federal Government, but upon the independent Legislatures of each individual State. Under no circumstances would there be the slightest probability of the various communities of which the Union is composed agreeing unanimously to any specified plan, and even among such of them as might be disposed, while they are smarting from recent experience, to resolve upon an amended course the whole question will, doubtless, subside under the influence of some new excitement before anything can be done. After pointing out that at the beginning of the present year the 1,400 banks in the different States were under liabilities equal to 90,000,0WOI., with only 11,670,0001. in specie-a position which gradually became worse up to the recent crisis-the President recommends that each State should impose the condition in every charter of incorporation that specie should be held to the extent of one-third of the deposits and circulation, and that, instead of notes being issued of all denominations from a dollar upward, the lowest amount should forthwith be fixed at 41., to be increased at some fLiture period to 10. He also urges that all banking institutions should be subjected to a bankruptcy law that would put an end to their existence upon a suspension of specie payments, this last measure being, in his opinion, within the constitutional functions of Congress, and consequently such as can be enforced throughout the. Union at the pleasure of that body. Congress, however, merely represents the desires of the majority of the States, and no restrictions generally unpopular would be entertained by them. Asto the compulsony. retention of one-third of bullion against liab. ities,. and the entire abolitisn.of. the small nota.oiroulation, all expectation of 3uch steps would ba delusive% Among the memb s.of, )mate and Assembly. in each State are ma-y,oL-the-active specrtors.who.push themselves ir,ftaSdbune and notvr,iey by their skill in what is .AWdi " f=nciervk;," ?Lwkvax career woitAd at qZW.NalbAtxucted by the establisb nent of any sound checks against inflation. Numerous suggestions continue to be received on tle subject of crossed checks. Most of the writers seem to imagine that the difficualty is to devise means to prevent a crossing frombeing obliterated, but the recent decision in the Court of Common Pleas was to the effect that any holder might erase a crossing by simply running his pen through it, and that the banker would then be justified in paying it. Of course, the question would arise under such circumstances whether the banker had used due caution, but it was to avoid the uncertainty of such points as these that the public desired the recent legislation on the subject. As the matter stands at present any one who may lose a crossed check has no remedy if it should be paid after the crossing has been secretly cancelled, and only a doubtful one if the obliteration has been made openly. It is of the greatest importance to, the commercial world that the crossing should be. defined by law to be part of the check, so that com.r plete responsibility with regard to it should be' thrown upon the banker; but this can now be obtained only by the passing of a new Act, or by a reversal of the recent judgment in a higher court. The plaintiff in the late case, It is said, is naturally unwilling to incur the risk of further loss, but it is proposed to raise a subscription for the small amount that will be necessary for an appeal, and thus to get as soon as possible a final interpretation of the existing statute. A statement has been published by Mr. James Low of the shipments of specie to the East during the present year. The total is 17,064,5071. (of which 269,2751. was gold, and the remainder silver) against 12,523,7341. (including 404,7491. gold) in 1856. The increase therefore has been 4,540,7731. From the Mediterranean ports the shipments to the sameregionhave been 3,61 0,6751.,against 2,063,9551. in 1856. Annexed are the total exports of specie from Great Britaia to the East during the past seven years.

The cash and bills in hand are sufficient for an immediate dividend of lOs. in the pound; but before making any divisionit will be necessary to wait until the fate of the bills for which Messrs. Herman Sillem and Co. are liable, but which are not expected to be proved against their estate, shall have been ascertained. A short discussion took place upon the large amount of the acceptances, 344,8511., and the requisite explanations were given respecting them. It was finally resolved to wind up the estate under inspection, and a committee of three creditors was appointed accordingly. A meeting of creditors of Messrs.

The probable dividend will thua be about 1ls. in .he pound, subject to increase upon a satisfactory adjustment of the affairs in dispute with the Transatlantic Steam Navigation Company. In NovemIher, 1S52, Messrs. Draper, Pietrvni, andC9, e Rtted into an agreement to subscribe for one-fourth of the capital of that undertaking,-viz., 96,0001., in 3,000 shares of 321. each. in return they were to be the sole agents of the company in England, and to make contracts for building zeven vessels, purchase of stores, &c. Instead of seven vessels, however, only four had been ordered, and Meara. Draper, Pietroni and Co. consider they are not bound to take up the whole of the shares originally agreed upon, but a proportionate number. They have debited themselves with calls upon the 3,000, but under this arrangement claim a return of the payments upon the shares in excess of 1,715; they have also other demands upon the concern. Of the sum due to creditors on open accounts 15,0001. is for debts incurred on behalf of the company, and as arrangements are pending for the liquidation of 13,0001. by the latter the total liabilities will be reduced by that amount, and a corresponding diminution will take place in the 33,0001. at present claimed by the firm. The assets are valued at the market price on the day of suspension, and may be expected, it is said, to realize more than the estimate. Only 2 per cent. of the bills reecivable are expected not to be met at maturity. It was resolved to deal with the estate for the present under inspectorship, Messrs. Draper, Pietroni, and Co. deferring the question of a composition until some settlement has been come to with the Transatlantic Steam Company. At a meeting of creditors to-day of Mr. Thomas Melladew, commission agent, who suspended payment on the 30th ult., an offer of a composition of 3s. in the pound was made and referred to a committee. Ia a balance-sheet submitted by lessrs. Turquand, Young, and Co. the liabilities were stated to be 26,1591., while the net assets are estimated at 3,8771. The failure is attributed to xpeculations in corn. At a meeting of creditors of Messrs. Wright and North, ironmasters, held at Wolverhampton yesterday, it was resolved to wind up the estate under the private arrangement clauses of the Bankruptcy Consolidation Act. The liabilities were stated to amount to 39,1041., while the asseta are estimated at 20,3211. The following letter from Mr. Coleman, the. accountant, relates to the nature of his proceedings in connexion with the London and Eastern Bank:- " 36, Coleman.atreet, Dec. 22. Sir,-I am at aU times unwilling to trespass upon you in any affairs In which I am personally engaged, but, from X one or two observations that were made in the case of the Eastern Banking Corporation before Vice-Chancellor W. P. Wood yesterday, I shall feel obliged by your giving room for the following:- " That I never was associated with the corporation, except as auditor under their charter, and upon being called upon to exeroise such functions In the month of July, 1855, as Mr. Stephens, the 3manager, had, prior to my completion of the examination of the acounts, caUed a meetlng of the proprietors and announced a dividend, which I did not con aider had been earned (if proper provison was made for contingencies), I therefore objected to sign the acoounts. " That on the 31st of July, 1855, I resigned the audltorship, and the following paragraph is in my letter notifying such resignation:- "' I have fuzther to request that you will at once withdraw my name from all advertisements, prospectuses, or other documents upon which the sama has hitherto appeared.' "At this time I believe that a sum of 10,0001, would have covered tho losses upon the accounts which I conceived to be of a doubtful character, and, having strongly urged upon the manager the steps that I considered necessary to be adopted,I considered that at that time I had done all that I was required to do under the circumstanecs "In respect of the estimate of asts, I beg to state that all the assets which I estimated have or will realizo the amount I estimated them to produsce; the deficlency arises solely from losses upon exchange operations in India, which were not known in England at the time that may statoment was prepared, and on the securities of Colonel Waugh, the estimates of which were based upon valuations of parties of the highest repute in their profession. " Iam, &c., "J. B. COLEBlAN." In a recent reference to the notice posted on the Liverpool Exchange at the time of the failure of the celebrated Mr. Oliver, it was mentioned that among the signatures was that of the chairman of the Liverpool Borough Bank. This, however, was not the case. MIr. William Rfathbone was chairman, and he states that he took no part in the demonstration. The late directors of the Mexican and South Araerican Company request to be allowed to state " that ali the facts mentioned in a letter inserted yesterday, signed ' Plain Sense,' so far as the salne relate to the directors of that company, are erroneously represented, as will be proved by the investigation now going forward in the Winding-up Court." They also observe that "the whole of the cormpany's affairs being placed in that court, it is obvious that any detailed discussion of them would at the present moment be entirely out of place." At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day a petition was presented for a winding-up order against the West Ham Distillery Company. The 4th of January was fixed for hearing the case, and Air. Whitmore was appointed receiver. The dividends are advertised on the Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Loan and on the Canada Debentures, Nova Scotia Sixper Cent., New Brunswick Sis per Cent., Virginia Five per Cent., South Carolina Five per Cent., Boston Four-and-a-Half per Cant,, and Eastern Railroad of MIassachusetts Five per Cent.

Yours obodientlv. SYRD ARDOOT.T.AWT . 8, Grove-terrace, St. John'a-wood, N.W., Dec. 2L, "Jabbulpore, Nov 10. "My dear Son,-Thanks be to C-od, after many days And nightspassed amid hopes and fears of the most snxfous description, this town and its inhabitants are now safe; bu; the Government Thanabs (or polioe stations) of Sleernanxbad, Kuttung-gee, Bhurthullx, and Gomulpore have been broken up by the rebels, and the thakoors Moortt Singh and Lutchmun, uingh men, possessed of but little inflUeno, having only a jageer (not exceedIng 800 rupees per annum), and who redided at a distanoe of seven coss from here, having collected hundreds of the Gound tribes together,are plundering and ravaging the country, baving cat off all communications between Mundish and Sohagpore Gurrur Stogb, the Thakoor of which latter place has joined' them. "The Rajah of Ramghur, who ever since 1840 has been labouring under mental aberration, still continues in the same state, but his unfortunate son, a youth not more than 20 years of age, listening, as il-luck would have It, to the advice of evil counsellors, has taken the field as a rebel, and,after plundering the districtof Burraillaon the7thinst., attacked Boora-Gurh and Gosulpore, Here a desperate encounter took place between him and the British force under Majors Erakine and Sleeman, these offioers fighting most gallantly with the rebels hand to hand; the rebels being at lut routed with great slaughter, the British loas being trifling, with the exception of that of Captain A. Tottenham, 4th Regiment of Madras Light Cavalry, an offlcer of undaunted courage and great merit. His corpee has been brought in here and buried with all due military honours. Another dlgaa Dstance of a native chieftain's ingratitude has occurred in the person of the Rlajah Surjoo Persehad, son of the late Rajah Purrag Dose, of Bijat }ligho Gurh. This prince, who at the time of his father's death was only 12 years of age, was, as in the invarable cstom with Indian princes, surrounded by a host of wily, treacherouw, and selfish courtiers, Major Janmeg 'Adam, late principal commissioner of this pro. vince, seeing this state of things, determined, with the view of consulting alike British interests and the welfare of the RqKya youth, took the management of the provinee Into his own hands, and had the young iejah Scrjoo Pershad educated under proper instrmctorsm The result of this foresight and prudence wa, that although the late Rajah Furrag Doss had died overloaded with debts, and the country, the annual revenue of which amounted to one lxc of rupees (10,0001.), was mnuch miegoverned, the ryots impoverished, and the villages de. populated, nevertheless, by the time the boy ascended the musnud of his father every rupee of debt was paid off, the condition of the ryots Improved, and the revenue increased. In addition to all which Major James M'Adam presented him with the sum of three lacs of rupees which had been allowed to accumulate for his service, besides banding over to him a well-furnished treasary. Forgetful of as these benefits, this scoundrel also raised the fstandard of revolt plundered the Government treasury, and, having put todeatb. Syed Sabit Allie Tehseeldar at Bijai Ragho Gurgh,was advancinguponJubbulpore,when he was interoeptedbyCaptain E. Clerk, deputy-commissioner of this place, where a fierce struggle ensued, Captain Clerk, sword ix hand, captured in the most gallant style two guns which Major Adanm with the sanction of Government had presented to this joung rascal and ungrateful Surjoo Pershad, put him to the rout, and he fed to the jungle, having narrowly escared being shot, Captain Clerk's pistol unfortunately miiming fire. The English troops being but few In numbers, it was not thought prudent to track him to his lair, but he has received a lesson which he will not easily forget. ". sjah Ragho Binder Singh B hadoor, of Nagode and Oochera, is doing good service to Government. There is a report that his Highness the Nawab of Bands has also joined the rebels; but the Maharajah of Rewah is still steadfast to the friendship of the British. " By the indefatigable zoel, asiduity, and foresight of Captain Maclean, deputy-commissioner, the provinoe of Baitool has lbeen preserved from pillage and surprise, but I am exceedingly sorry to Inform you that Shivdeen Puttall and his brother Ramdeen Puttail, the Jageerdars Of Baitool, who at one time enjoyed such high reputation ir the estimation of the British authorities, and had rendered essential good servioe to them on various critical occasions and Iu return of their servics had received Jageers, have been found gUilty of tampering with the rebels and been sentenced to severn years' impriSOnment with labour, all their moveable and immoveable effeet confiscated, and their families turned on the street without a pice in the world. Corn is very cheap here In consequenoe of the corndealers not being able to send it to the other provinces, owing to the bad stato and insecurity of the roads. In several Ilaaquas of the Saugor and the Nerbudda territories the Khurreef and the Rubbee crops have not been sown I must not omit mentioning to you the constant zeal aud laudable exertions of Major W. 0. Rslkine during this verr troublous timee; the untiriug and persevering exertions of this excellent and highly-gifted officer are the theme of universal admiration. In fact, the authorities here have done wonders in preserving this small but beautiful, opulent, and ancient town. The neck of rebellion in this district is now broken, and we ane in hopes of soon receiving troops from Madras and Bengal. These shortsighted and hotheaded vagabonds will then discover their error when it is too late, and bitterly repent for generations to come. In my next letter I hope to furnish you with further news.

TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMBE& Sir,-We are told that " Her Majesty and his Royal Highiass Prlice Albert have been pleased to sanction the plans submitted by Sir Be'amin Hail for the lmprovemerat of Rotten-row, Hyde Park, and that this concession has been made to the Commissioners of the Exhibition of 18.51, by which the value of their estate at Kensington-gore, in. cluding Prinoe Albert's Road, will be materially enhanced." I as an inhabitant of that neighbourhood see no objection to this, and cheerfurlly congratulate the Conimis. sioners-of whom his toyal Highness is President-in having such powerful patrons. But as it muay be sonmewhat like appealing from Peter to Paui to addrs that body upon the subject, I prefer tsking the more direct because the more unfailng course of asking them the question througb. 2 he Times, whether they purpose showing their appreclation of the condescension of the Court by lighting the mile or two of stew roads they have recently thrown open !> If not, and that sbortly, they must not be surprlsed to hear that they have tacitly laid out a neutral ground upon which those who love the deeds of darkness rather than of light may meet in common. I know no iner arena around the whele metropolis than these gasless roads now present for British Thuggisut at night. For such class they offer an obscure stage and every faVour,-the '-immense open area," indeed, " upon vhich Government give a guarantee that none but buildings of a public character shaUl be erected," affording to modern Dick Turpins and Jerry Abershaws just the " bit of cross country" to lend additional security if not picturesqueness to their escape, Let the Commissioners, therefore, do that at orce and with a good grace which they must eventually do; and as the neighbourhood and the public have to thank them for opening ehese much needed sources of communication such gratitude will not, as now, go down with the eun.

THE C.RowN JEwEs.-W& find tiae folowig mi. a letter from Hanover, of December 19 :-" The hearts of the King and Royal Family of this country have been much rejoiced by intelligence which has just reached them through the Hanoverian Minister at tho Court of St. James's, that the long dispute between the King of Hanovez and the Queen of England respecting the right to oertain jewels of enormous value, in the possession of the Sovereign of England, and forming no inconsiderable portion of what have been hitherto called the British Crown jewels, hwa been decided in favoar of Hanover. hiany of your readers are no doubt aware that when the kingdom of Hlanover was severed from the united kingdom by the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne, a clatm was made by the late King of Manover, formerly the Duke of maberland, to nearly the whole of the jewes usually worn on State occs"ions by the EngHsh Sovereign, on the ground that part of them, which had been taken over to E:ngland by GeorgeL, belonged inalienably to the Crown of Hanover- aud that the remainder had been purchased by 6eorge III. out of his privy I-nrse, and had been left by him and his Queen Charlotw to the Royal Faumily of Hanover. As the jewels thus claimed are supposed to be worth considerably more than l,00{,0O., a. single stone having cost nearly 20,O0., they rere not to ba relinquished without a struggle; ant I am assured that every possible expedient was resorted to in England toL b7file the claimant. Ultimately, in the lifetimne of the bate Kxing, the importunity of the Hanoverian lMinister in london drove the Engli5h MsIinistry of the day to consont that the rights of the two Sovereigns should be submitted. to a commis5i ,n composed of three English judges; I>nt the proceedings of the coummission were so ingeniously protracc} that all the commissio ers died without arring at any decision; and until Lord Clarendon received the seals *,f the British Foreign-office al the effores of the Court of Ianover to obtain a fresh commission vrere vain. Lord Clarendon, however, seems to have perceived that such attempts to stifle inquiry were unworthy of his country, for he consented that a fresh commission should be issued to three English judges of the highest eminence, who, after in. vestigation, found the Eanoverlan claim to be indisputably just, and reported in ias favour.

LAJVW PEPOBT. COURT OF ClANCERY. LiCwLN'RTn-. 1brn 99 3OBSO1T V. THE AI,L OF DEVON.-JflGMD-n (Before the LORD CRACFcLLOR and the LORS JUSTICES of APPE}AL This was au appeal from a deeree of Vlce-Chanoellor Stuart. The cas stated by the plaintiff in his bil was as follows :-In April, 1852, the Earl of Devon and certain others of the defendants assisted in the formation of a scheme to establish a mining association on the cost-book principle for raising gold and other metals in Australa, to be caUed " the Melbourne Gold and General Mining Assoeiation." In one of the prospectus es Issued by the company It was stated, among other things, that the company was to be conducted on the cost-book principle; that it was to consistof 100,000 shares, on which a deposit of 11. per share was to be paid on allotment; that no deed was to be signed; that the liability was to be limited to the amount paid; that all moneys would be] returned without deduotion unless adequate capital should be subscribed, and that by the constitution of the company on the cost-book principle there was an absence of all personal responsibility, unless expressly asumed by parties themselves, and the limitations of all claims to the assets of the company. Shares to the amount of 105,000 were applied for by the publio, but the committee of management, of which the Earl of Devon was the chairman, in the exercise of their judgment allotted only about 30,000 shares, and of the number so allotted a deposit of Uf. per share was paid only in respect of 1,918. The company, therefore, received by way of deposit on the allotment of shares the sum of 1,9181. only. The managing committee nevertheless determined to proceed with their scheme, and to effect that object they were desirous of obtaining a loan on the security of the company's shares, and also the quotation of those shares in the official list of the Stcok-Exchange, as well as the appointment of a settling day for the shares. It was alleged by the plaintiff that the managing committee employed one Robert George Moore as their agent to effect the above purposes, and,that Moore, in concert with one Edwin Howard Tripp, a sharebroker, devised a scheme with aview to their accomplishment, and that that scheme was embodied in a letter dated May 3, 1852, and addressed to the Earl of Devon. In order that the shares might be quoted in the Stock-Exchange share list It was necessary to satisfy the committee of the Stock-Exchange that twothirds of the shares of the companyewere allotted, and the deposit thereon paid. The main features of Moore's alleged scheme were directed to satisfying the requiromenti of the committee of the Stock-Exchange, and it was described by him to be of suoh a nature as that it would " Involve no money payment", on the part of the company, and "only a limited risk of shares, which," he added, "was not unreasonable for the service proposed to be rendereL" It was further alleged to be a part of Moore's scheme " to rig the market," a process by which an apparent demand for shares in a company is created, so as to give them a fictitious value. It was also alleged on the part of the plaintiff that Moore's letter of the 3d of May, 1852, was read on that day to the committee of management of the company, and that the proposal therein contained was approved by them, and a minute to that effeot was endorsed on the letter by Moore. In pursuance, as it was further alleged, of the arrangement contained in the letter of the 3d of May, 1852, Trlpp on the 15th of that month called on the plaintiff, who is a stockbroker, and represented to him that Moore and one Scotthorn, who was the engineer of the company were desirous of borrowing 5001. on the security of 1,000 shares held by them therein, and on which shares a deposit of Uf. per share had been paid. The plaintiff, in ignorance of the plan contained in the letter of the 3d of May for pro-. curing a settlng day on the Stock-E rohange for the shares of the company, paid Moore and Sootthorn 5001., and as a security for its repayment they deposited with him the certificates of the before-mentioned 1,000 shares. Those shares, it was alleged by the plaintiff, were not the property Of hloore and Scotthorn, but had been deposited by them as the agents of the managing committee of the company, and to effect the purposes contained in the letter of the 3d of May, 1852. The bill next alleged that a day or two after the 15th of May, 1852, and in further pursuance of the arrangement of the 3d of May, 1852, Moore and Tripp called at the plaintiff's office and required him to procure for Moore some shares in the conpany not exceeding 1,200 in number for the day of settlement at any price not exceeding 11. 2s. 6d. per share, to pay for which hloore undertook, by a memorandum in writing of the 18th of May, 1852, to provide the plaintiff with cash before the settlement, and In case Moore failed to do so he authorized the plaintiff to sell the shares purchased by him at the best price obtainable to close the transaction. Moore further undertook by the memorandum in question, "from time to time to deposit with the plaintiff sorip certificates for paid-up shares in the proportion of one to every two shares purchased by the plaintiff as a security in case Moore did not provide the plain. tiff with cash as before named to pay for the said shares purchased, or any difference between the price at which they had been bought and sold, and the plaintiff's commis3ion of 6d. a share on the purchase, and a further 6d. a share if sold, which commissions were to be payable on the day of settlement ; and in case Moore did not provide the plaintiff with cash to pay the said difference and the commissions of the latter, the former authorized the latter to sell so many of the shares deposited with the latter as would be sufficient to pay the difference and commissions; but the shares were not to be otherwise sold without Moore's order." On the 25th of May Tr,pp also undertook that he would be responsible to te plaintiff for any loss which the latter mlght inour in relation to the purchase of the 1,200 shares mentioned in the memorandum of the 18th of May, 1852. Ptrsuant to the instructions contained in that document the plaintiff, at various times between the 18th of May, 1852, and the endi of the following month, purchased for Moore 1,200 shares in the company at different prices, some being purchased at par and the rest at 2s. 6d. and Iz. 3d. premium. The cost of these purchases, including commission and a loss of 51t. 5s., occasioned by a failure on the Stock-Exchange, amounted to 1,3981., which the plaintiff paid out of his own pocket. The plaintiff, by his bi, alleged that he made the beforementioned purchases in the full belief that they were bon'fide purohases by Moore, but that they were no such thing, and that they were made by Moore and Trinpp in furtherance of the lan of the 3d of May, 1852, an as the agents and on behalf of the managing committee of the company, and by their authority. The plaintiff had sold 200 out of the 1,200 shares purchased by him, and had received, as the proceeds of such sale, the sum of 931. 15s. The hill alleged that the loan of 5001. was made and the 1,200 shares were purchased in pursuance of the soheme agreed upon by the managing committee of the company in concert with Moore, Scotthorn, and Tripp, and that those transactions were a fraud upon the plaintiff; and it prayed that they might be set aside on the ground of fraud, and that the defendants might be ordered to repay to the plaintiff the sum of 5001., with interest, from the 15th of May, 1852, and the whole of the purchase money for the 1,200 shares, witl interest on such purchase money, after allowing for the sum of 931. 15s., the plaintiff being willing and offering to deliver up the shares in his possession and the memorandums of the 15th, 18th, and 25th of Mlay, 1852. All the members of the committee by their answers denied to the best of their behef having heard the letter of the 3d of May, 1852, read over, and the then solioitor to the company, Mr. Ellaby, also spoke to the same effect. The evidence of the letter having been read over and approved by the committee on the 3d of May, 1852, was confned to an affidavit made by a person named Servantes, who at that time held the office of secretary to the company. It was under these circumstances that the Vice-Chancellor dis. missed the biUl with costs, not even excepting Moore and Tripp, on the ground that the plaintiff had wholy failed to prove the allegations of fraud contained in his biUl. From this decision the plaintiff appealed. Mr. MALINS and Mr. G. L. RUSSELL were heard for the appellant. Mr. Bacon, Mr. Wigram, MIr. Craig, Mr. B. F. Smith, Mr. Stevens, lr. de L. Giffard, and Mr. J. N. Higgins, for the several members of the committee of management;* and M\r. Walker, MIr. Baggallay, MIr. Osborne, and > mte for other defendants. The LORD CHANCELLOR now delivered the judgment of the Court, and said, that the issue raised by the bill was whether the two transactions between the plaintiff, and Moore and Tripp, first as to the loan of 5001., and then as to the purchase of the 1,200 shares, ought to be set aside and the loss to the plaintiff made good by the defendants, on the ground that such dealings had been brought about by the fraudulent scheming of the defendants. His Lordship then went minutely through the evidencezrelating to the loan, and said that the plaintiff chiefly rested his case for relief from this transaotion on the allegation that the shares upon which the 5001. was obtained from him were not the bond fide property of Moore and Scotthorn. Now, this allegation was not borne out by the acr ortn oae,and, on the contrary, the inference dav by him (the Lord Chancellor) from the evidence was that the shares belonged bond fide to Moore and Seotthorn. Be that, however, as it might, it was manifest that it was not of the slightest consequence to the plaintiff whether the whole of the deposits had been paid upon the shares or not, as between him and Messrs. Moore and S¢otthornthat is the depositors and the depositee; it must be conclusively taken that aU the required deposits had been paid. This view seemed to exhaust both branches of the alleged fraud in respect to the loan, as the plaintiff got for that advance thepersonal security of the two depositors and a deposit of the shares. It had, however, been urged that Messrs. Moore and Scott. horn were not aoting in the transaction on their own account, but as the agents of the committee . but even if that were so it would afford no ground for coming to this court for relief, as the plaintiff would have a riseh of action to recover back his money at law. Then, 'with respect to the purchase of the 1,200 shares, it was contended that the order ws not given to the plaintiff bondl fide to purchase them for Moore, but that he and Tripp were acUg merely as the agents of the committee, and fraudulently imposed upon the plain. tiff, inasmuchi as the deposit had not been paid on any of the shares purchased by the plaintiff in the market. 'Now he (the Lord Chancellor) must confess that he could not see, even asming that statement to be true, what pre. text it afforded the plaintiff for coming to this court. It was an impoeition upon the rest of Her Majesty's subjects but not on3 that could affect the plaintiff, for he was clearly entitled to call upon Moore, or his employers (if any), to make good the deficiency of deposit in respect of those shares upon which Moore had represented the whole deposit of 11. had been paid. It was not alleged that the defendants were insolvent, and therefore since the plaintiff bad his remedy by an action at lAW, it WAS cleAr that if all the allegations maade by him were capable of beon proved no canse -whatever had been made out for a bill n,-l court It was due however, to the defendants to state that, in his (the Lord Chancelos) o i on, the mait foundations for the plaintiff'ls compl&int had not been mnade out. T'he chief troud of such comjplaint was the letter of the 3d of May, 152, wh. I t wi stated was readl over to the compmttee on that day, ahd approved byt them. No -doubt the letter was written, butewhetherit was read over or not must chiefly depend upon ruo degree of credit to be attahed totheevideaoe of Mr. aervantes.Now, it owouahave beenmuchmorwaesfftomake r Bernt tesa when speaking of. the approval of the committee, had told us what was id, and n what manner they evinced their outwsrd appro. bation of Its contents, considering the letter was of such an extraordinary description that it muist hve elicited some remarks at the time it was read. For this reason the testimony of Mr. Servantes must be received with great saspicion,-the more so as every one of the directors present at the meeting denied, to the beast of hio belief, that the letter was read over. In addition Mr. hoaby, the solicitor to the company, stated that he had not the least recollection of the letter being read, although he believed he was present dcseng the whoeo of the meeting. Further, it -was alled that the secetary of the company was to e no entry upon the mranutes respecting the letter on the agestion that the commlttee were well aware of ge dishonest nature of the proposition contained in It. Now, It was extremely improbable that those gentlemen would put themseves into the hands of a peron who might at any time disclose a tranction which would involve them al in a fraudulent conspiracty for, undoubtedly, the letter, if read and approved, would lead to that result. This instructionL to the secretary, and his putting the letter Into the company's box, coupled with the endorsement In the handwriting of. Moore, formed such an. extraordinary tale that he (the Lord Chancellor) could not attach any weight to it. It followed, therefore, that the Vice-Chiancellorhad come to a right conelusdon in dismissing the hil with costs, exept as to the costs of Moore and Tripp. In that respect he was wrong, for how couldthey be entitledto cotswhen they stte thatethey hadattemapted topractisea fraud. The deOreewould be altered so as to deprive them of their costs, and also in stating that the bill was dismissed without prejudie< to any right the plaintiff msht have to bring an action at law. No cEsts of the apce Lord Justice TuRuxnR conurred in all respects with the Lord Chancellor.

It appared that Dodd was an attotney,and Merrifield was his cler and that the former havine issued a writ out of the Court of Common Pleas In England'against a person named Buldus, then residing In Jersey, It was served upon Benldus by Merrifield in Jersey. Shortly afterwards Dodd and MeroifLeljt were arrested on meme process to answer a question of damages, on the ground that the laws of Jersey had been violated by the issuing and service of the Common Pleas writ,dThe arrest was madue by " an order of jstiee" issed out of the Court of Jersey, and Dodd and gerrifield were now Imprisoned upon it. The application was made to this Court because there was no commissioner for taldng affidavits for the common law courts in Jerey, and the Jurats of the island, who were authoricedto take such affidavits, hea e clined to do so in the present instance,and, consequently, the affidavit had been sworn before a commissioner in hancery. It was stated in the order of justice" that previously to its being issued Dodd was a prisoner for debit in Jersey, U n d er th es c ircth e stan c est h e h a b eas c osp us w as askad fo r bsoth o onth e ge neraldri ght to uhavr th e l lt y o of the "order fjustice"inquired bint wan thled Iorreartitioy of the Instrment tsel, it avin beensignd bya jdedelegate, intenad ts, of d the bilff atofice in tde ilan d being now The Lond CHANcELLOR said a writ of habeya Vcopus would go both as to Dodd and Merrifield, as Dodd might be detained in prison by the "rorder of" sjustioe after he had paid the debt upon which he had been arrested. The writ would be returnable on the sweond day of next term, and his Lordship would probably obtain the assistance of a common law judge in the hearing of the case.

The chief clerk by his certificate allotted the lands in severalty, and that certifiate was approved and the Vice-Chancollor ordered the estates to be conveyed in severalty, and declared the lunatic to be a tustee under the TLrstee Ao 1850, of certain heredit.ments. Under these circumstances a petition was presented in the matter of the Trustee Act, 1850, and In the matter of the lunay, and also entitled In the case to aery Into effect the order of the Vice-Chancellor. Mr. A. BoYas PURCELL appeared in upport of the petition, and rioed upon the 3d and 30th sectlons of the Trustee Aot, 1850, and on the Lunaoy Regulation Act of 1853 as showing that this Court was competent to deal with the matter. Mr. CRAIG appeared for the committee, and said the committee was of opinion that the partition would he for the benefit of the lunatic, Lord Justice TURwa una-This can be done under the Trustee Act. Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUCE.-Ye a ; there must be some way, when such a power is given to this Court. Whether the convoyancers, who are hard to please, wll accept a title, is another question. Mr. PuRCETL suggested that, under the 1qU th and 137th sections of the Lunacy Regulation Act, 1853, the matter couldmhe effected. After some farther discussion, The LoRDS JUSTICES made an order declaring, under the Lunacy Regulation Act, 1853, and the Trustee Act, 1850, that asit appeared to be for the benefit of the lunatic that the partition should be completed in pursuance of the order on further consideration it should be completed acordingly, and directing the committee of the estate to convey the ectate and initerest of the lunatlo in such manner as to give effect to such R?srtition. It was also mentioned In the order that the committee consenated to convey as aforesaid, and was of opinlion that such partition was for the benefit of the lunatic. IN BANKRUPTCY. EX r'ARTE YATES, IN RE SMiTH. This was an appeal upon a point of disputed right to proofs, A joint and several promissory notea was made by three persons, and one of the miakers applied to the payee to give him time, which was agreed to if- a fourth party would add her namne to the note. The fourth party, intending to make himself liable as endorser, wrote his name not on the hack,, hut on the front of the note, and the question was whether' this vitiated the naote. Their LoRDsUiiPS, overruling a decision of one of the commissoners, held that it did not, it having been decided for more than a hundred years that the locality of the name made no difference, so long as it was placed with the intentioni of being an endorsement.

Foo0s applied to his Honour, in consequence of a difficulty which had occurred in drawing up an order in this matter. It was necessary, before the order could be passed, to prove the due exeoution of a certain instrument by Elizabeth Catherine Robins, and the evidence of that execution was the official seal and signature of the British Consul at Chicago, in North Amenca; whereas the Regis. trar (Mr. Metcalfe) thought that it was necessary to have *n affidavit of one of the attesting rwitnesseos. The deed (which was produced in court) was a perfectly good and valid in. strument, and had been executed by another party at New York, with exactly the same evidence of Its execution as at Chicago, thatSbeing considered good evidence according to the practice in the A merican courts, founded, as was sup~. posed, upon a case in MeaddocA?s RcepoHs, where the p roof of the execuahon of a deed was allowed under a no soa The VICE-CIASCELLOR (after consulting Mr. Metcalfe, who was in court) said that the practice In the American courts could not, of course, govern this court. The case cited was admitted to be a special case, and not decided as establishing any rule. This proof was altogether irregular; although the seal appeared to be official, yet in the absence of anyproof of difficulty of obtaining an affidavit of au attesting witness the order could not be drawn up. Mr. Foons said that with his ERonom?'s leave he should mention thematter to the Lord Chancellor or Lords Justices. The VICE-CHNCXLLO1t said that he should be very happy if he would do so. (Before Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) WYELCH V. KNOTT. This was a motlon on behalf of the defendant to dissolve an iniunction which had been obtained during the long vacation, ex parte, restraining him from selling soda-water in bottles similar to those in use by the plaintiffs, having the words and figures "J. Sohweppe and Co., 51, Berners. street, Oxford-street, genuine superior aerated waters," or similar words, stamped or impressed thereon,and from using and selling soda-water in bottles having labels pasted over the corks similar to those used by the plaintiff, or in colourable Imitation thereof. The plaintiffs had in 1834 purchased the sole right to the soda-water manufactory carried on under the name of "Jacob Schweppe and Co.," and had since that time car. ried on the business at the original premises, 51, Bernersstreet, Oxford-street. The bottles used by the plaintiers Were indelibly stamped or moulded in the manufacture with the words "J. SchwepPe and Co., 51, Berners-street, Oxford. treet, genuine superor aerated waters,"Iandalabels with the signature " J. Schweppe and Co:" were also pated over the corks. The defendant Kinott carried on business as a cyIst druggist, and soda water manufacturer in Exeter. M.Chapple, their solictor, called at the defendant's shop by teir direction on tho 21st of ;3eptwomk ,dP~bvtd pha)a dozenr of soda-water. Five bottles Out of the dozen we e stamPed with the words "J. chwepe and Co.," &e.,,while the remaining seven were plaini bottles, and over the corks of all a label of a similar colour to that used by the plain. tiffs was pasted, with the words " Soda Water" printed thereon. Tha plaintiffs thereupont filed their bill, and ap. piled during the vacation for anL ex parte injuncotion, which theyobtainedouythe13thofOctober. Tledefendantnow moved to dissolve this injunction. Mr. RoLT and Mr. SHArTER, in suLpport of the motioa, referred to the defendanVs naswer, put in subse uently to the injunction, in which he stated iat he usuay bottied his soda-water in plain bottles, but tha ehdocsoal purchased quantities of second-hand bottles wit theasinamUy tbereon, and that it wast°thec'uSstComfthrVe ftrhade° monslling similar bottles, withot regard to whatmightbe moualded tention of passin of issoa-aer bortlemndas w theqyirs. and that when his customers asked for Sch water, he had sent for it to Schweppe's agent in Exeter. The defendant also denied any Intnino mislead the public by his labels Into the belief tht th were buyg Soihweppe's soda-water, and offered to g uve an undertaking not to use any of thepanif'btlsi h sale of soda. water. Upon these ground it wa submit that no cse whatever existed for continuing the in'cthon Mr. CAnIRS and rofrplaintiffs, con. tended that the inninrtlo t ai The defendant though he mi not have any f hn intention, was doing that e e of which was to mnislead the pnbli into the behef that they were purchasing the soda. water Iaufaetured by the plaintifs, and aa erding to the settle rules of the ourt mnust be rtrained from sueho act. In using the plaintlffs' bottles he had affixed no distinctive label or anything to show that the soda-water was of his manufacture, or destroy the obvious inference that bottles stamped with ' Sohweppe and Co.," and labelled merely as "naSoda Water," did not contain Sohweppe's soda-water. Irn his first letter he stated that these bottlss were forced upon him as retrnt bottles, though in his answer he admitted that he purchased them indiscriminately. So far from parting with all control over the bottles thus moulded, the laintiffs did all they could to get them back agIn by offering 3s. a-ozen for what they could manufacte t Is. 6d. per dozen. The VicE-CnAJNcELLoR (without calling for a repy said that he must dissolve the Injunction. It w ear that the particular bottles might ep lawfuy used for the orpinary purpose of being filled with soda-water, though not In sucn a way as to deceive the public nto the belief that they were urcbaing soda-water man ufactured b the plaintfs. if to publio was deceived it was no answer that the defendant had done so in tgnoraneb and without any fraudulent intention,the settled rule being that where a person was possessed of an exclusive right to a trade mark no one else could use that trade mark so as to induce the publ5 to believe that the goods sold by him were manufactured by the person entitled to the trde mark. Whether or not in vending generally articles of this description the onus might not be thrown upon the vendor of distinguishing those of his from those of the plaintiff, and of Informing the publico that what they were buying from them was not the article manufactured by Schweppo and Co., wasa question of considerable Importance, and might have to be determined at the hearing of the cause aeording to the evidence. As regarded the injunctlon which had been obtained Mr. Chapple must clearly have. known that the defendant was not selling the soda-water as Schweppe's, nor was thee anuy retence of Its bein such. He could not say that any fact tad been suppre upon the ex parte appliceation. The Injunction might possibly have been granted from want of sufficient scrutiny and iavestigation, which had been now suppled by the arguments on either side. So far the Court miht be said to have been in fault, but then the p tiff obtaed his ijunction at his own risk. His Honour, after referring to the bl and Mr. Chapple's affidavit, which, he observed, differed in some respects, and, eo far, were somewhat calcltoad to miead, said that no doubt the label and bottle, when taken together, had a considerable effect or tendency to bring the publc to the con. cluslon that they were buying Schwepe's soda-water. Mr. Chapple, however, had not asked for *chweppo's sodawater, which he ought in fairness to have done if he wished to ascertain whether there was a piracy or not. The case was by no meaus one upon which an ex parte applation should have been made. 'The defendant was not vending his soda. water as Sthwepport and If the plaintiffs bad made inquiry they would have got that information before applying for an injunction which the defendant subseuoently gave them. Seven of the bottles sold were withouit tho slightest imita tion of those of the plaintiffs, and this circumstance alone ought to have induced Mr. Chapple to ask for InformLation. Moreover, the defendant wha made an offer which would ive the plntifs all they could require. He did not at au doubt the plaintof right to their trade markw , nor did he look upon it as an "advertiing case," but for the reaons already stated the injunction must be dissolved. Mnr.

With reference to the letter published in ne Timas of Mondy, signed dnE. Benoit," In which the writer, stating himse to be professor at the royal iiontary Academy, Woolwich, and at the Ordnance School, Carshalton, con-. plains that our report of this cae contains a o ifalse assertion" in describing him "as having formerly been a clerk in Messrs Lonigman's house,' our reporter j ustifies the correctness of the report by referring to what took place in court at the bearing of the cause. Certain letters were produced for the defence, which were stated to have been written by "M1. Benoit, of Paris." Itemarks having been made by the plaintiffs counsel In the opening on the desription thus given of ML Benoit, and on the absence of all evidence as to who he was or what was his occupation, It was at once stated in court on the part of the defendants that M. Benoit had formnerly been a clerk- in Messrs. Longman's house, but nothing transpired as to his holding any professorship at Woolwioh or elsewhere. The statement thus made spreared to be accepted as a fact, and, moreover, formed the subject of addi. tional comment by the counsel for,the plaintiff; nor was it contradicited during the progres of the case. It would seem, therefore, either that the description thus given in court was a mistaken one, or that M. Benoit, of Paris, and M. Bienoit, the Professor, are not one and the same person. At aUl events, if they are, the statement or assertion thus omnplained of in the abovementionea letter cannot in fairness be laid to the report.
COURT OF (OUEKN'S BENCT ZT1.T%WAT.T. Tn- 99 THE QUEEN V. ROBINSON. (ftUing at Nin Priuw, before Zord CPBIXL and a SPecia JW,.1 Mr. Sezjeant Byles, MAr. Huddleston, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Harrison appeared for the prosecution; and Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and MIr. Hodgson for the defendant. At the sitting of the Court this morning, the trial of this indictment was resumed. Sarah Grocott, examined by Mlr. HAwxisS, said,-I am the wife of Thomas Grocott, a butcher in St. John's-wood. I have been married 11 years. Before that I had been in service some years as cook. On the 28th of June, 1854, I was engaged by Mr. Field to go to Mrs. King's. I was to receive 21. a-week. On Thursday, the 29th of June, I went to Mrs. King's in the morning, at about 9 or 10 o'clock. I know the defendant. I saw him on that day, about lunch time. On that day (the 29th) the defendant dined there. The defendant, mrs. Evans, and Mr. Mylitis went to the Crystal Palace. On their return they dined at, I believe, between 7 and 8 o'clock. I remained tnere tilt the following Saturday week. I had been engaged for ths purpose of watching Mrs. Evans. On Friday, the 30th, I Saw the defendant again at the house. He came about lunch time; he generally came about that time. I don't remembar how long he stayed on the Friday. Mrs. Evans was at home. The defendant was alone with Mrs. Evans for some time. The following day (Saturday) he called again about the sams time, and was alone with Mrs. Evans on that day for som, time. 1 had observed nothing particular down to Saturday, the 1st of July. On the Snnday, the 2d of July, a gimlet was given to me by Field. I made a hole in the foldingdoors between the drawing room and the side room. Through the first hole I could not command a view of tht i sofa, and after that I made a second hole wita the gimlet, and through that I could command a vie v of the sofa. I remember Tuesday, the 4th of July. The defendant came to the house on that day, about luno's time. Mr. Mylius was there. They lunched about 1, a s near as I can remembei. A. ter lunch, Mr. Mylius went out. The defendant remained with Mrs. Evans, and they were alone together in the drawing-room. After Mr. Mylins hal gone out I went into the side room. I found Mrs. Price there. She was writing, taking an inventory. I looked through the second hole I had made, I saw the defendant and Mrs. Robinson sitting on the sofa, side by side. Mrfs. Price also looked through the hole, and in so doing she made a slight noise. After that Mrs. Evans came into the room where we were. She spoke to Mr Price, and as near as I can remember asked her what she was doing, and Mrs. Price said she was taking an inventory. After this I went down stairs, and I think Mrs. Price did. After I had gone do wa stairs I heard the drawing-room door closed. It was open when I went down. When I heard the door closqd I again went up to the side room. I think M Przice also came up. I saw her in the side room. I looked through the hole again. I could see fmr Evans and the defendant. They were on the sofa. (The witness here described the position in which she said she saw the parties.) I think I fetched Mrs. King up; at all events she came up to the side room, and looked through the hole. Mrs. Prica also looked through the hole in my presence. On Wednesday, the 5th of July, the defendant also called about the same time, or it might be rather latcr. Mr. Mylus and MIrs. Evans were at home. The defendant was there a, lunch. After lunch Mr. Mylius went out, and the defendant remained behind. There was no one in the drawing. room then but the defendant and Mrs. Evans. I then agali went into the little side room and looked through the hole, and saw the defendant and Mrs. Evans on the sofa. (The witness described what she saw.) I then went down t) Mrs. King and asked her to come upstairs. She came aud looked through the hole. I did so too, when Mrs. King came up, and saw the defendant and irs. Evans in tge same position. I remember seeing the defend. ant the night before I went to LiverpooL I was wfith Mrs. King. I think it was at the corner of Portman. square. The defendant spoke to Mrs. King. When he first addressed her he said, " What Is all this ' noratien ' aboat me ?" Mrs. King said, "It is not mI that has niade it, but yourself," He said, "What have I done VI She said, " Ask 5 ourself the question." I went out of the way into the country, and they fetched me back again. He said, " Can't you go away again, and find the cook and take her with y ou?' He said, " If you bring Heaven and earth against me, I have got clever men to work, and it will rain you if you go against me." Thi defendaDt did not know who I vere. He wras talking a long time, and walked to Cavendish-square. Cross-examined by Sir F. TsESIGE.-I was hired by Field. He came to me, and told me he wanted me to watch a lady, and offered me 21. aweek for a month. I was there altogether about 10 days. I received my 8C. I went on the 29th of June, and did my duty very carefully in watching. I went over to the door. I believe I listened-not many minutes. It was at the drawing-room door. I believe that was the only time I listened. I got the gimlet on the Sunday, and made the hole on the Monday. It was in the middle of the day. They were all out. I looked through the first hole, and then made another. I did not look through the hole when any one was there-not on Monday morning. It was a quarter-past 3 when I came down on the Monday. I looked at the baker's clock. When I came back the defendant was proceeding to leave the house. When Isawhat wasgoing on I went down to Mrs. Kingand fetched her up. She came up immediately. I did not tell her what for. No one know I had bored the hole till Mrs. King came into the room, and I told her. I believe Mrs. King looked first. Mrs. Price was there before Mrg. King came up. Mrs. Price remained In the room. She was in the room when I went down to Mlrs. King. The same thing occnrred on the 5th of July. I then went down to Mrs. King in the parlour. She was sitting in the easy chair. I cW't say whether she was awako or asleep. I told her to come, and we all witnessed this again. I did not tell Field what I had seen. I did not see Field after this discovery. I can't say when I received the 81. I think Mr. hMelton paid me. I don't believe Field was present when it was paid. I don't remember horw soon after the 5th of July I saw Field; not before I saw Mr. Melton. I saw M-. Melton on Friday, the 7th. Mrs. King and I vwent to him together. I have seen Field here during this tr,aL I was talking to him here yesterday. I mentioned the conversatien with the defendant on the second trial, not on the first. I was not asked. I told Mr. Melton. We all went together to Liverpool, frs. King, Ms Price, Mr. Melton, and MIr. Field. Field was examined on the second triaL Re-examined by Mr. Serjeant BYnW.- I gave my account to Mr. Melton separately from Mrs. King. On the first trial no witnesses were csJled for the defendant, nor on the second trial. I believe I saw the defendant's witnesses there. I was to have 81. whether I found anything or' not. Mrs. Ann Price, examined by Mr. HUDDLESTON, said,-I am the wife of Thomas Price. He is in Australia. I live in Ryder-street. I keep a lodglnghouse there. I was at Mrs. King's, 2, Bryanston-street, on Tuesday, the 4th of July. I was taking an inventory in the side room adjoining the drawing-room. The last witness, Mrs Grocott, was there. Sho called my attention to look through a hole in the panel of the folding doors. I looked through and saw the defendant and Mr Evans sitting on the sofa. I made some noise in moving a chair, and Mrs. Evans came into the room from the drawing room by the door on the staircase. She said, " Oh, you're taking an inventory," She then left the room. I can't exactly remember whether I left the room. I was in the room afterwards, a short time afterwards, and looked through the hole a"ain. The were in the act of adultery. Cross-examined by Sir F. TEYSGnR.-I had only known Mrs. King a short time before. I did not know what her revious life had been. I had been at her house the day before, and went with her to the Marbl-i Arch. She aked me to accompany her to the MIarble Arch. She told me she was going to meet Mr. Evans. I had heard who he was. She did not tell me I was going to meet Field. I did not know him then * I know him now. I met Field at the Marble Arch. Mr, Evans was not with him. I did not hear Mfrs. King say, "Here is my friend, Mrs. Price;. perhaps she can assist you." Field said something to me, but I don't know what. Mrs. King said something about an inventory, but I didn't know what she said. Mrs. King might have said that an intrige was going on, and she had been applied to to detect it. When I went to the house on the Tuesday (4th of July). I knew that there was an intrigue to be detected. I had known that, I engaged to take the inventory. I was not to be p_aid for it. I dad not take it with that intention. I had no employment at that time, except my lodginghouse. I had not been employed as a broker in taklnn inventories. I began at the top of the house. Mrs. 'ivans did not assist. I don't remember seeing her exoept when she came into the room. I began at the inventory early in the day. I had nothing to go back for; it was nearly com. pleted. Mrs. Evans's maid helped in one bedroom. I was living with my husband before he went to Australia. He had not resided with me for a year or two. I let lodgings in Ryder.street now. I went to Margate after this with Mrs. Kilng. Mrs. lKing went to my house in Ryder-street. Field came there. I think Field did come to hargate, but I don't remember, it is so long ago; and yet I have some recollec. tion that he did. Field talked to me about this business, but I don't know whether It was at Mar. gate. It might have been. I stopped at Margate two or three weeks. That was before I went to Iaverpool at the first trial. I have seen Field several times during this trial, and spoken to him. I don't think I have spoken to him this morning. Re*examined by asIr. Hu nrazsroN.-I have not talked to Field anything about this trial; nothing materil at alL My husband ]dved with me five wears, and left me. He was a warehouseman. I had often done wrltm for Mrs. King before. I have heard that ars. Bvans fnade an inventory for herself. f Margaret Clarkson, examined by Mr. IlAnssor, said,-I am the wife of Thomas Clarkson. I am a laundress, and live now at No. 31, Saville-street. I recoUect being at Mrs. .King's house on Tuesday, the 4th of July, 1854. I went there about 11 o'clock in the morning. I was cleaning paint and the chairs in the housekeepers room, on the groundfloor. I mean the floor on the level with the kitchen, usaUy caUed the basement. . I know Ellen Davis, Mrs. Evans's maid. I saw her on the afternoon of that day in the housekeeper's room. It was from about 2 o'clock tiUl 4. She was ironiog. She did not go upstairs during that time. Cross-examined by Sir F. THJBSIGER. I am a laundress. I have been employed by Mr. King for a length of time. I 'worked for her occasionally when she was in Bridges-street. I ap Mrs. Kig's cousin. I was first asked about EUen Davis after the first trial was over. John Clark, examined by Mr. HuDDLESToN, said,-I am a flydriver at Chelteiham. I remember a party being given at No. 9, Lansdowne.crescent. It was in 1845. I know Mr. Carrington's house. It was No. 1, Lansdowne-terrace, about 150 yards from where the party was. It was a private ball, at night. My fly was engaged by the defendant, I was standing first fly at No. 9, where the party wavs The defendant and Miss Carrington (now Mrs. Evans) got in. It was between 2 and 3 o'clock in the merning. I asked where I was to arive to, and the defendant said " Berkeley. place." That is about a mile and a quarter from Lansdowne. crescent. The defendant lived there. I drove the defendant and Miss Carrington towards Berkeley-place. The defendant caUed to me to stop, near the BeUle-vue, about 50 yards or more from the defendant's house. The defendant got out and paid me, and told me to drive to No. 15, Lansdowneterrace, to take the lady home. I did so, and Miss Carring. ton got out. I lived behind Iansdowne-creseent for about 15 years. I have often seen the defendant and Miss Carrington out walking. I have seen them walklng in Hather ey-lane and Bouncer's-lane, leading towards Prestbury. They are retired lanes. I have seen the defendant go to Mr. Carrington's house a little after 11 on Sundays. Church begins at 11. I had seen Mr. and Mrs. Carrington and Miss Carrington (Fanny?) go to church. Cross-examined by Mr. EDIVIN Jar-ss.-I spoke of this years back on account of its being such an unusual thing. It was in the winter time-January or February. A flydriver named Cox came to me last Friday. I saw Mr. Evans with the flydriver at Cheltenham, at the Assembly. rooms. Mr. Evans said he would let me know whether he should want me or not. He let me know, and I came up on Sunday. Miss Carrington came into the fly in X baUl dress. I don't know who lived at the house, but I believe it was No. 9. There were eight or ten carriages round the door. Miss Carrington's house was about 150 yards off. I first gave information to Mr. Evans on Friday. I have never seen the defendant go to church with them. This was in 1847, or 1845, or 1846. It often happened. Re-exaimined.-My evidence was first taken down on Sunday. This was the case for the prosecution. Sir F. TissioER then addressed the jury for the defendant, and in so doing said he was sure they would be fully impressed with the importance of this case. The charge of perjury was one of the most serious that could be brought against any man; perjury poisoned the channels through which justice flowed, and, therefore, he -was sure they would watch all the circumstances, and weigh them well in their minds before pronouncing an opinion one way or another on the important issue they were caUled upon to determine. The learned serjeant, in his sldlful, and he might almost call it his artfal speech, had endeavoured to alarm the minds of the jury by telling them that if they did not convict the defendant they would find several witnesses guilty of wilful perjury. The question, however, was whether the defendant had been guilty of wilful perjury, and that charge ought to be established by clear and indis- putable evidence; hut if, on a view of aU the circumstances and in a conflict of testimony, their minds should be left in doubt, it was not only reason and justice, but law also, that they should say the defendant wan not guilty. It appeared that Mrs. Evans was married in November, 1850, but on her mirriage she refused to live with her husband's mother. In that respect her conduct was to be reprehended, for she ought to have submitted her will in that respect to her,husband's; but it appeared she had afterwards humbled herself, and agreed to submit herself to his arrangements, ag'it was her duty. Her husband, however, who ought not lightly to have put away his wife, was guilty of a dereliction of his most sacred duty. He abandoned his wife, and from that moment they had never seen each other. Bat in the letter which Mr. Evans wrote to his wife on that occasion there was no suggestion made of any impropriety in her conduct, either before or after her marriage. That showed the falsehood of the evidence which had been adduced, for if it had been true the facts must have become known to Mr. Evans, and he would, no doubt, have referred to them. It was said Mr. Evans had been liberal to his wife on her marriage; and perhaps that might afford some clue to the proeeeding3 which he had instituted. It appeared that a man named Field, a detective policeman, had been employed to find out if possible, the means of obtaining that divorce which it, was now avowed was the real object of aU these proceedings. The learned counsel observed that a dangerous system had grown up of late of persons who had been in the police setting up private offices, and holding themselves out to the world as detectives. So long as that system was confined to the discovery of felons not much harm, but rather gcod, might result from it; but if the system was extended to the watching of private honses, in order to discover what their employer might wish to know, it would lead to the utniost danger through all the walks of society. Such persons could not work without instruments, and It was necessary to em. ploy the basest of society, who must be rowarded for their services,and, perhaps, according to their suooeas There would thus be a temptation to fsbrloate, and, having onoe tasted the sweets of reward, parties would be tempted to go on and support their statements in courts of jsice. Something of that kind would, he thought, be found in this cases It appeared that, in the year 1852, Mmrs Evans had taken lodgivgs in Upper Seymour-street, and, from the admission of the prosecator himself It was impossible to allege anything improper against her while in that place. In 1850, Mrs. Evanslodged intheEdgware-road.d and whilethere it was proved by Mrs. Phillips that she saw nothing wrongin her, but, on the contrary,thatshe conducted herself properly in all respects; in fact, no impropriety at all was discovered until the year 1854, when she was lodging in Bryanstone. street, and not even then until the 4th and 5th of July, when MIr. Field had got all his instruments ready and tie parts of all the actors were arranged. Immediately after tbat, viz., on the 8th of July, tho writ in the action was sued out. On the first trial counsel, in the exercise of their discretion, called no witnesses for the defendant. The case depended on the evidenoe of those three witueues.Mrs. Ring,Mrs. Grocott, andMra.Frice-and Mr.andhirs.Phllips. and a jury of Liverpool merchants disbelieved those witnesses and gaveaverdiect for the defendant. A new trial was granted, and on that occasion the plaintiff seured the services of the Attorney-General, now the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and his eloquence prevailed with the jury to give a verdict for the plaintiff, with 5004. damages. So far Mr. Evans was successful; but he then proceeded to the Ecclesiastical Court, and a most eminent judge, Sir John Dodson, had refused to pronounce for a divorce on much the same evidence. Stung with the disappointment, and determined to carry his object, Mr. Evans then instituted these proceedings. In the Ecclesiastical Court a party was bound to state the acts of adultery on which he intended to rely, and the proseoutor had instanced only the Edgware-road and Bryanston-street. He might have alleged other matters which led up to the adultery, but he had omitted to do so. The learned serjeant had endeavoured to find Efault with the manner in which the defendant denied the acts of adultery alleged against him in the passage which commenced " I am now prepared solemnly to swear," &c. The fact was that that was the-form of the interrogatory submitted to him, "Are you now prepared solemnly to swear," &c., and, as the de. fendant was bound to answer the question categorically, he necessarily answered the question in the form in which it was put to him. Leave was given to the prosecutor to bring in an additional allegation; and then it was alleged that, on or about the 22d of July, 1853, the gardener Munn had seen the act of adultery which he described yesterday. Evidence was given to show that it took place from the 15th to the 27th or 28th of July, but that evidence being shaken the ground was now shifted, and it was now stated by Munn to have taken place on the 12th of August. Now, however, a new flyman named Clark had been started upon the defendant. The learned counsel here referred to the defendant's denial that he had ever taken indecent liberties witb Mr. Evans, the meaning of which was evident, and did not mean that he had never put his arms round her waist or kissed her. If putting his arms round her waist was an indecent liberty, ne (Sir F. Thesiger) was afraid such libertieswere committed every night at balls in the presence of fathers and mothers. The evidence on this part of the case, if it was important at all, ought to have been brought forard in the Ecclesiastical Court, which it was not. The learned counsel then re. ferred to the contradictory evidence given by Mr. Schonswar and Morgan, the waiter, as to the conversation which was alleged to have taken place at the club in October, 1850, respecting the expected marriage, and contended there was no ground for giving it the meaning suggested. In fact, it would be proved that the defendant had no hand whatever in procuring the marriage. It was a melancholy circumstance for the defendant that it had pleased Providence to deprive him of one of his most im- ortant witnesses, Mr. Carrington, Mrs Evans's father, who had suddenly dropped down dead on the 10th of the present month; and also of Mrs. Carrlngton, who died on the same day. Was it, however, to be supposed that a gentleman and lady of the acknowledged respectability of Mr. and Mrs Carrington would have allowed any of the improprieties referred to ? But it would be proved that the lodgings had been taken by the defendant for Mrs. Evans with the approbation of the deceased. The learned counsel then proceeded to state that he should call a witness who must be admitted to be of some importance in this inquiry. That witness was Mrs. Evans herself who, though she had but just lost her father and motier, and another member of her family, was prepared in vindication of her character to come and appear In the witness-box, and submit herself to the most searching cross-examination. She would deny upon her oath that the defendant had ever taken indecent liberties with her, much more would she deny that he had ever committed adultery with her. The learned counsel ridiculed the story told about the latch key, and said It was altogether untrue. The mald servant, Jemima Miller, at first swore she saw Mrs. Richards give the defendant the key; but she was afterwards compelled to admit that she did not oeo it given. Mmrs PhiUips had said nothing about It in 1853, but after the affair of 1358 Field went to her, and he discovered it. It would be proved by the defendant's own son, Frederick Robinson, that the story about the latch key was untrue. It had already been disproved by the defendant himself and it would also be denied by Mrs. Evans. Mrm Evans's servant ws now marrled to a iean named Brill, at Cheltenham, and though every effort had been made to subpcena her, her husband had refused to allow anybody to see her. The learned counseL in reference to the fly ase in 1849, Faid It was a most incredible story that anything of the sort spoken to by the man Boston could have occurred in a fly, without blinds and in the day time in a publio road. The other two witnesses, however, did not confirm Boston's story, for they saw nothing. Munn's case was never brought forward tillI85G,andthe wholo story could onlyhave beenthe inventionof the prurient mind of a baseandabandonedman. The defendant was a magistrate, well known in Cheltenham for 20 years, and it was incredible that either he or Mrs. Evans (then Miss Carrington) could have done what was alleged, and so have exposed themselves to the world on the ground by Mr. Close's waU on the 12th of August, 1849. He (Sir F. Thesiger) might here say that there was but one witness, and in perjury two were required ; but he would rather rely upon the evidence which he should adduce to prove the faLsehood of this charge. The man Munn had said that Mrs. Evans's sister was walking with her and the defendaut on that evening; but It would be shown conclu. sively that on the day named, the 12th of August, her sister was m Dublin, where she had been taken by her father in July, and she did not return home tiUl October. With respect to the affair In Bryanston-street, it would be shown that Mrs. Evans had come up to London with her cousin, Mr. MylHus, a gentleman who was studying for holy orders. The apartments had been taken for her by the defendant, who made no secrecy, but gave his own name and address, and stated that Mr. Carrington's family would be there on the 5th of July. Mr. Mylies occupied the room next to the drawing-room as his bedroom. For months, and even for years, Field had been foiled in his attempts; but in June, 1854, he had recourse to Mrs. King, and found her ready to his hand. He engaged her services, not her house, for the sum of 251. Mrs. Kig said she did not like that sort of thing. But it appeared Field promised her 251. and paid down 15l. ; he kept the rest as security for her good behaviour. Then, again, she was under the thumb of Mfr. Melton, the attorney, who had paid out two distresses for hr.E H had paid 45 guineas for her, and taken her I OU for the amount. He had taken her furniture and put it into a warehouse, but he had since been so kind as to give It back. Thus she was under the screw. There was some security upon her furniture, there was the L 0. U. for 451., and the 101. unpaid. And who was lrs. Sing? Why she was Mra.Walsh. And why did shecall herself King? She said it was her " fancy ;" but it turned out that King was the name of her "fancy man." She said she had kept a cigar shop in Brydges-street, Covent-garden, where ladies and gentlemen used to meet, where she had two lady lodgers, and where the laundress, Mrs. Clarkson, who bad been called as a witness, used to go " to clean the iaint." She was thus an instrument ready made to Field's hand. The first woman put in by Field, Miss Jackson, only remained three days. It was soon found out that she would not do, and mrs. King said she was of " no use." The next person resorted to by Field was Mrs. Gro. cott, for Field mustered all his forces. She was to have 21. a-week for a month, and remained 10 days, for which she received SZ. Mrs. Grocott, however, looked and watched in vain. At last Field, on Sunday, the 2d of July, gave her a gimblet, to make a hole to see, or to say she saw, something. Then an appointment was made to meet Field at the Marble Arch on Monday, the 3d of July, and Mrs. Price, whose husband was in Australia, was called in to assst. As soon as Field had got all his istraments ready, the whole scene was Ilad open. There was no time to be lost, for Mr. Carinngton was to come on the 5th of July; and therefore it was that all those witnesses and the gimlet were to be provided. And yet, strange to say, when the discovery was made they never told Field a word about it. Mrs. Evans would, however, be called, and would prove that nothing of the kind had taken plnce. It would be proved tbat on both the days spoken to, th`e 4th and 5th of July, the defendant had called on Mrs. Evans in the morning, in companywith the Rev. Mlr. Thackeray and his little boy, and that they went away together in about half an hour, and the defendant did not return. It would be proved by Mr. Mylius that he was occupying the side room at the time, and he would confirm Mrs. Evans's testimony. It would be shown that the defendant was not these At lunch on either day; and indeed evidence would he given which would satisfy the jury that he could not have been in the house at the time mentioned, either on the 4th or 5th of July. Thelearned counsel then observed that the alleged conversation of the defendant with Mr King was not mentioned at the first trial, and though it was mentioned on the second trial it must be remembered that all the wit. nesses went down to Liverpool with Field. After reviewing the whole of the evidence, the learned counsel observed that there was no sound point in the whole body of it, and he solemnly warned the jury not to encourage such a system of espinage as had been proved in this case, and he implored them to guard the interests not only of the defendant but of society by pronouncing a verdict of acquittaL The learned gentleman's speech was followed by ver loud and general applause from a crowded audience. it may be as well, however, to observe that the jury maintained throughout the proceedings the most perfectjudicial graLvity, and an entire freedom from all excitement. The first witness called for the defendant was Mr Evans She was examined by Mr. EDNVTW JAS=. On her firstap. pearance in the box she spoke in tremulous accents, but she soon acpquired self-possesslon and gave her evidence with greater distinctness. She. said,-My nameLIs M ySohia Evans.

The defendant called at our house whenever he liked and used to go out in ride with me and other friends.

He never m.asignedaiiy other cause for leaving me than that, My father died on the 10th of this month. and my mother aio the same day. My father gave his evidence in the Arches Court, and was to have been a witness here. My father used to come to London in the season, and the defendant has on deveral occasions taken apartments for him. I was never in a tly wvith the defendant alone in July, 1849. I was in Norfolk at the time, dtaying at Horsted Rectory. I was never with the defendant in a fy on the Charltonwroama or anywhere, or at any time. I never left a bal in a with the defendant; I ws always chaperoned home by my parents.

It is not true that on the 4th of July I was in an indecent position with him on the sofa. That story is al a fabrication. I say the same of the next day. On two occasions while in the Edgwareyroad I went to the theatre with the defendant. I went to set Rachel one evening at the French Play. in the other occasion I went to see Sar-danapaius at the Princess's. On these occasions the defendant came home to the dore but he certainly id not come in. While in Bryanston:t street I once went with the defendant and Mr. Thackeray to the opera, Mr. Thackeray is sister to the defendant. They bath brought me home to the door. I remember, on Tuesday, the 4th of July, the defendant called upon me with Mr. Thackeray and his child. The boy was about three years old. Trhey called about U, before luneheon time.

I have wilked out with the defendant nearly everycday. I also rode out with him. The first time I rode out with the defendant was in October, 1852. I frequently rode out with him in 1852 and 1853; no one accompanied us. I was constantly in the habit of walking with him up and down the terrace at Cheltenbam, We may have extended our wals.

I afterwards removed from that room on Mr. Carrington's arrival, snd took o small room downstairs. I changed the same day, I always sat in that room tillluncheon-time.

I well remember the 4th and 5th Of JulY. On the 4th Mr. Thack-eray, his little sons, and the defendant called on mrs. Evans about 11 o'clock. I was in my own room.I could hear if any D erson 'was in theAdrain-ro- ITe mained quietl in my room till Mrs Evans tapped at the door for me to come in, as she wanted to introduce me to Mr. Thackeray. I had some talk with him about Cambridge. They went out for a walk. The defendant went with them. It was past 1 o'clock when Mrs. Evans returned alone. One o'clock wras the usual time for lunch. When she came back we had luncheon as soon as possible. It is not true that the defendant was there at luncheon on that day. He was only thereat luncheon on one occasion-on tbe day they went to the Crystal Palace. On that day (the 4th), having been disturbed by Mr. Thackeray, I returned to my room after luncheon, which was not usual, to finish my reading. I remained there till about half-past 2 or a quarter to . I then went to a shop oposite Pornmn Chapel, and made inquiries about A hymn-bookI then went to Portman Chapel to hear the children's sermon.

Mrs. Evans asked me if I had met the M'Donalds, and said they had just gone out. I then went to walk with Mrs. Evans in the park, and returned home just before dinner. Mrs. Evans and I dined together. On Wednesday, the 5th of July, the same persons called as on Tuesday-Mr. Thackeray, the child. and the defendant. They stayed the same as the day before, and then they all went out and left me alone. About 1 o'clock I heard a loud knock at the door, and I put my head out and saw Mrs. Evans.

Mr. Montague Smith, Q.C., and Mr. Honyman were for the plaintiff; and Mr. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Blackburn for the defendant. This was an action oni a policy of insurance (part-heard yesterday), in which 2501. had been paid into court. The evidence was mainly documentary, and The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 521. 2s. AI'LIN V. THE SOtTH-lWESTRr RAILWAY COMPANY. Mr. Edward James, Q. C., Mr. Beasley, and Mr. Watkin Williams were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. Milward appeared for the defendants. This was an action for an injury to the plaintiff's wife, caused by the negligence of the defendants' servants. Mrs. Aplin said that on the 2d of A-ugust last she went by the excursion train at 8 a.m. to Southampton, intending to go onto Dorchester. As she could not take luggage by that train her boxes were to follovv by another. On her arrival at Southampton she inquired of a porter when her luggage would come and where she should go for it ; he, pointing across the line, said " Over there ; come with me." She expressed her fear, and asked whether the public wero not prohibited from crossine the line. He answered " Oh,ye, unless under the care of a porter or inspector." He thern took herby the wrist and led her to cross the line. She followed, and s^arcely had she got her foot on the line than the carriages between which she vwas going closed, and orushed her severely. She became insensible, and recollected nothing until she found herself at Dr. Hearne's, in Southampton. She was laid up at Southampton a fortnight, and for nine weeks in the country, and she has ever since been suffering very much; her sight is seriously affected, and she can do no work. Mrs. Gerrist confirmed this account, and distinctly saw the porter taking Mrs. Aplin by the wrist. M.r. Jison and another medical gentleman spoke to the serious nature of the injury, and believed that probably she would feel it all her life. Mr. LusH, for the defendants, contended that even shouldthe jury be of opinion that the porter tookMrs. Aplin across, yet that, as that was a wrongful act on his part and wholly unauthorized, the company were not bound by it. The LORD CHrE JUSTICE said that he was prepared to rule that the company was liable, and entered at some length upon his reasons for so deciding, but added that Mr. Lush might have leave to move. Several porters and officers of the company were then called to contradict the evidence of the plaintiff, but it was admitted that persons were In the habit of crossing the line to get to the Dorchester train.

Mr. Doyle was counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Joyce were counsel for the defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover compensation for iniuries alleged to have been received by the plaintiff through the negligent conduct of the defendant's servant, under the following circumstances: -The plaintiff was returning to work from his breakfast on the 29th of July last, and just as he passed the shop of the defendant an instrument known as a " long arm," which is shod with iron, and is used to pull down the window-blind, was thrown out of the shop at a dog by a lad, and, unfortunately, struck the plaintiff on his ancle. The plaintiffs first impulse was to punish the offender, but the defendant, according to his account, came into the shop and begged himn not to strike the boy, as he had thrown the " long arm" at a dog which was troublesome by his order, and he was very sorryfortheaccident. Theplaintiff,notknowinghe was rmuch hurt at the time, accepted the apology and went to his work; but In a short time his foot became so painful that he was obliged to go to a doctor, and abstain from work for four weeks. The doctor's bil and the loss of wages amounted to 151. - but when the plaintiff demanded comPensation from the defendant he repudiated all liability, and referred to the boy's father, but declined to give the boy's address. On the other side, the defendant swore most Positively that he never gave any order to the boy to throw anything at the dog, that be never had seen him on the morning in question till the plaintiff rnshed in, that he then cameout of his parlour into the shop for the first time, and expressed bis sorrow indeed when he beard of the injury intlioted on the plaintiff, but never admitted that the boy had acted under his orderm. In this stage of the case, it ap. pearing that the boy was in court, The LOURD CmHE BAnoN suggested that the boy ought to be called. It was not to be expected that the defendant would call hmi; but it appeared to him that the plaintiffs counsel ought to call him and examine him as a hostile witness. Mr. D]OYLE, after some besitation, adopted the suggestion Of the learned judge, and called Charles Burnett, the lad in question, who stated that, though he could not swear whether his master had or had not ordered him to throw the "long arm" at the dog, he was quite sure his master was present when he flung it at the dog, and that he had stated to the plaintiff that he alone was to blame, and that he had ordered the boy to fling the "long arm" at the dog. This evidence gave occasion to the learned counsel for the defendant to call other witnesses to contradict the boy, and to prove that he had frequently stated that he was to blame in the matter, and hoped that his " governor" would not be prejudiced by his conduct on the occasion in auestion, The LoRD CHIEF BARoN, in summing up the'case to the jury, stated that he was by no means satisfied that the defendant would be liable even if he did order the boy to throw the instrament at the dog, but he should reserve the point forthe Court. For the present he would take the opinion of the jury on the question of damages, and on the poiiit whetber the defendant had given general orders to the boy to drive away the dog whenever he should come, as it seemed he was in the habit of doing, or had given a special order to do the very act complained of, and was present when it was done. Tho jury found a verdict for the defendant. The Court rose to-day for the holydays, his Lordship having disposed of the whole cause lists.
PREROflA¶VTV nnmTi' n- 'o _ - LANE V. LA-E A.ND GRIFF1TIIS. ;sir J oUN DODSON sat this morning for the purpose of giving iudement in the followin_e '- xne iearnecs d UDGE said that the testatrix in this case, Mrs. Caroline Lane, of Chipping Camden, in Glocestershire, dlied on the 22d of October, 1855, aged 62. She was a widow, and left four sons, two of wbom were parties to the cause, the will before the Court beingpropounded by Henry Warden Lane, the younger son, and opposed by Charles Lane, his elder brother. At the time of her death she was possessed of personal property to the amount of about 5001. and some real estate of the value of 2501., subject to a mortgage of 2001. Three vills had been laid before the Courtt the fits dated In 1851, which .,was admitted to be valid unless revoked by a later instrument; the second dated the 28th of December, 1854; and the third dated the 13th of October, 1855, which was the one propounded by Henry Warden Lane. There was a forrth will, of M-ay, N6, but it was stated that the testatrix had destreyed it in her lifetime. The deceased had since her husband's death carried on business as a plumber and glazier with the assist. ance of her son Charles. The question for the Court to con. aider was whether the deceased, when she made the wil of October, 1855, was competent to dispose of her property. That will was opposed by Charles, on the ground that in April, 1854, his mother had a convulsive fit, accompanied with paralysis, from the effects of which she never tho. roughly reeovered, but continued from that period to the time of her death of unsound mind and ineapable of doing anything requiring thought, judgment, and discretion. He. alleged that the wils of May and December, 1854,were made merely for the purpose of pacifying his mother, and there. fore, although the will of 1854 gave him the entire property, he relied entirely upon the will of 185L The learned judge went through the evidence adduced on either side, beginning with that of the medical men who had attended the deceased, one of whom was unableto say whether she sufficiently recovered her first attack to be capable of making a will, while another said that after the first attack she was perfectly rational, but in his opinion she must have been incompetent to make a will after the second attack. The managig clerk to the solicitor who had drawn up the. Will of October, 1855, detailed the circumstauces under which it was executed, stating that the deceased told him that her son Charles had used her so badly that she wished to alter her will in favoar of Henry. He added that Charles had never advised hbnr that the deceased was of unsound mind, or that the wills of 1854 were executed merely to pacify her. Mr. Grifths, the solioitor, who was appointed one of the executors, and another witness gave similar evidenceas to the capacityof thetestatrix, and itwasprovedthat neither when she gave instructions for the will nor at the time of its execution was either of her sons present. Under all1 the circumstances he should pronounce for the will, and condeonu Charles Lane in 301., no mine ecxpensarum. AMrPnEmTr V. EARLE AND EARLE. The learned JUDGE said that Miss Hannah Martin, the testatrix in this case, died possessed of considerable property, both personal and real. Her next of kin, the Misses Earle, who would have been entitled to her personal estate if she had died intestate, opposed the will, which was propounded by the executor named in it, Mr. Amphlett, who was also the heir-at-law. The will was dated the 7th of March, 185, and, after giving directions as to the funeral of the testatrix and bequeathing legacies to her servants and others, distributed the bak of her personal property among various relations, including some illegitimate nephews and nieces. The attesting witnesses were a friend of e testatrix and a gentleman, Mr. Frere, who had drawn the will, and who had for a number of years managed her concerns. It appeared from that gentleman's evidence that he had interviows with her, on many different occasons, on the subject of the will, and read over to her dispositions 1 which she had formerly made of her property, and so collected what were her wishes. He made suggestions to her, but she hardly ever followed one of them. She frequently recognized the will before her death, and on the whole hc had no doubt that it was a good wiL. But these ladies were fully entiled to bring the question of its validity before i the Court, and therefore he should pronounce for the will, but should direct the costs of the suit to be paid out of the property. WOOD V. HOARE AND CHILD. This was the only cause upon the paper for argument, but before the Queen's Advocate, who appeared for the will, had begiu to open the case, Dr. ADDaiss said he could not oppose the granting of probate, and The COURT accordingly pronounced for the will. T1}E SENIOR DEPUTY REGISTRAR. The case of " Dyneley v. Crosse" was then called. When I it was last before the Court Mr. Dyneley, the senior deputy registrar, was assigned to deliver a copy of his charges against Mr. Crosse, the proctor, within a week. Mr. DYNiELrY said he had obeyed the order of the Court. Mr. CRossF said the statement was not delivered to him until after the expiration of a week from the date of the order of the Court, and he could not therefore receive it without further directions. Sir J. DoDSoN.-Why has this case been called on ? I came here to-day to dispose of three particular causes, and I cannot hear any other cause, My business is done. Mr. DYIMEY began to read the notice he had received to attend to-day, but was interrupted by Sir J. DODnO,, who said, I know nothing about the notice. I desire to hear no more of the matter. Let the case be taken before the judge of the new Court, who is the proper authority to decide it. I cannot decide It. Mr. DYNLEy submitted that his fellow registrar, Mr. Ostling, ought to be reprimanded for an improper assumption of power in citing him to attend. Sir J. DODSON.-You will have amnple opportunity of siating your case to a judge who must be totally unprejadiced and who will do whatever is right and proper. Today sat for a particular purpose, and I cannot go Into other matterm Mr. Dy,LEY said he had attended in obedience to the learned judge's order, and was about to make a farther statement, when he was again interrupted by the Court. Sir J. DODSON.-It is very extraordinary that you can. not keep quiet, Mr. Dyneley. I gave no order on the sub ject. I now desire that the Court may be broken up. The learned judge then left the bench.

The 4th of January was appointed for hearing the petition. In the meantine all executions are stayed. The case was balloted to Mr. Commissioner Fane, and MWr. Whitmore is the receiver. L RE IVILLIAX BUDDLE. The bankrupt was a builder of 5, Delamere-terrace, Pad. dington. His accounts contain the following items- UJnsecared creditors, 13,98h.; creditors holding security, 35,7631. property held by creditors, 491,8441.; other prope'rty, about 8001. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. LAwRANCE, for the assignees, didl not oppose ; Mr. BAGLEY, instructed by Mr. T. J. Jerwood, opposed for Messrs. Atherton and Co. and five other creditors; Mr. 1,12MLATER, supported. Reference having been made to the circumstance that on the occasion of a previus bankruptcy (in 1849) the bank. tapt had received a first-class certificate, HlisHEONOIJ, ingiving judgment, said it appeared to him at the bankrupt was an honest trader,and he would receive an immediate certificate of the first cass on the present occson. Certificate accordingly. IN RE IICHAEL BANES. The bankrupt was a sewed muslia warehouseman of Watling-street. His case has been fully reported in The Times. He nowy passed his examination, Mr. Murray appearing for the assignees and Mr. Reed for the bankrupt. (Before Mr. Comminsmoner EvA?s.) |IT RE OCTAVIUS RXCG.-EX PARTE THE UNITY BANE, This was an application by the Unity Bank for leave to prove against the separate estate of Octavius King :- His HONOUR now gave judgment:-He said,-It was contended that it was too late to dispute the claim. On the proceedings it appeared to have been admitted ia the form of a proof, but a memorandum on the alleged proof reduces It to a mere claim to be turned into a proof if the Court were satisfied, consequently the Unity Bank must prove their case, and the assignees are entitled to make any objection. The objection is that the proof was sought to be made on a joint and several bond given by Octavius King and his brother to secure any advances made to the firm, which was constituted by brothers. It was admitted that at the time of giving the bond Octavius King was an infant, and only beeame of age a short time before the bankruptcy. Octavius King did nothing to confirm the bond after he became of age. It was contended that Octavias King being an infant was not bound by such a bond, and the following cases were cited In support :- " Fisher v. Mow. bray" (8 East, 330), where it was decided "that an infant can on no account bind himaelf in a bond with a penalty conditioned for payment of interest as well as principal;" also "Baylis v. Dinaley" (2 Selwyn, 447). I bave looked into an the cases cited, but It does not appear to me that there is any decbioai in contradiction to those cited, and I am therefore of opinion that the Unity Bank cannot prove against Octavius King's separate estate.

MIDDLE2SEMIOXS,jTt7day, D". 22. (Befor Mr. PAsn-,YQ. C., Assistant-Judge.) George Nathamiel Hosking, surgeon, convicted on Monday upon his own confession of embezzlement, was brought up and sentenced to 12 months' hard labour. George iCathbertson, 36, clerk, was indicted for embezzling three sums of money, amounting to 21. 12s, 6d.L receive by him on account of George Craken, his master. He pleaded" Guilty," and, being brought up for judgment, was sentenced to 8 months' hard labour. Michael Hannon, 28, pleaded "Guilty" of stealing a cask of white lead, the property of William Peters. For-ner convictions were proved against him, and the Court sentenced him to three years' penal servitude. Thomas Carmoody, 22 and Thomas Reeves, 20, were found Guilty of stealing 201b. of lead, the property of JohnLee Sulivan, thesame beingfixed to abauilding. Both risonerswereknown. Carmoodywas sentencedto18 and Reeves to 3.2months' hard labour. John Scott, 42, a Life Guardsman, pleaded " Guilty" of having stolen two guns and other articles, of the value of 250l., the property of the Hon. Charles Batemaxx Eanbury. The prosecator is a lieutenant in the 2d Life Guards, and the prisoner was his servant. On the Ist of August Lieutenant Hanbury went on leave, and returned on the 4th of November. Th prisonar wasleftin charge of his wardrobe, butduring his absence he purloined a great variety of articles of clothing, the gold lace from his uniform, two guns, a violin, and opera-glass, altogether of the value of 2501. The prsoner absented hiraself from barracks until the 7th, when the prosecutor saw him In the yard, and asked him what he had to say for himself. He said he was very sorry, and told where he had pawned the property. The prisoner had been 21 years in the regiment, and seven and a half the prosecutor'sservant, great confidence being reposed in him. The COURT sentenced him to be kept to hard labour for one year. Lleutenant Hanbury stated that there were two other John Scotts in the regiment, young soldiers of very good character, and he was anxious on thetr account that it should not be supposed that either of them was the John Soott who had been guilty of this dishonesty. The distinction between them was that they were young men, while the prisoner was an old soldier, having been in the service over twenty years. Edward Scott, a well known thief, was indicted for stealIng a basket containing a number of plated artiQles value 54, the property of John Stratford Best. His last sentence was l2mnonths. The Court now passed one of four years' penal servitude. (Before Mfr. Cfl.AY.) Catherine Vale was indicled for stealing a quantity of linen, the property of Roland Webster.

Mary Ann Dickson was indicted for having obtained by false pretenoes a silk dress with intent to defraud. Mr. Orridge prosecuted, and Mr. Sleigh appeared for the prisoner. It appeared from the evidence that the prisoner was in the employment of a dressmaker named Tully, and, availing herEelf of her knowledge of her mistress's customers, she applied to one of them, a lady named Mayhew, for the silk in uestlon, stating that she hadbeen sent for itby Mrs. Tully. t was given to her, but she never returned to her employ. ment.

P-O~LIOE. , .ANSIONy.nOUl The Rev. E. J. May, the head-master of the Brewers' Company's School, of Tower-hill, appeared before the LORD MYOR, to answer a charge preferred against him of having unlawfofly assaulted and beaten John Henry Grossmith, one of the schoolboys, and son of Mr. Grossmith, of the three Tons Inn, Jowr7-streoe, Mr. fDaniels appeared for the prwsecution; Mr. Hobler for The defendant pleaded " Not Guilty." John H. Grossmith said,-I am ten years and a-half old, and go to the defendant's school, at No. 9, Trinity. square, Tower-hill Last Friday I was sent to school, at about half-past 3 o'clock. By my mother's dedre I was detained at home til that hour, and took a note from my mother to the defendant, and I believe he read it. He said it was nothing about going home. I had told him that my mother had sent a note about my going home. He told me to go to my place and work, and.i made an attempt to ran out of school because my mother had told mne to come home. I had no other reason. I went towards the door with the intention of leaving the school, and I was followed by Mr. Cattermole (one of the other masters), who brought me back into the school. I did not use any impro;per language to him. Mr. May then told me to come to Mm and he would cane me. Iwent to him and he caned me. He did not say anything, nor didL He caned me on my thighs. It took about 10 minutes. I asked him to forgive me. I said, "Forgive me, I did noti mean to do it !" and he kept on caning me. I went to my place. I saw afterwards that my trousers had a hole in them from the effects of the cane. I stayed at the school about threequarters of an hour, and then went home. I felt a little difficulty in going home. I saw my mother, who examined me, and sent for a doctor. Cross-examined by Mr. Hobler.-I saw my mother write the letter produced. It is as follows:- " Sir,-I have kep. my son at home for a few hours, requiring him particularly. " DecM 1Y. "- xOiossirrrml . I had been complained of for keeping from schooL My master did not teU me to bring a note. My mother sent me with the note. I told my master that my mother told me to go home. There was a scuffle between Mr. Cattermole and me when he stopped me. School breaks up at half-past 4. I don't know how Mr. Cattermole got struck unless it was with the satchell I had with me. Mrs.Grossmith, the mother of the boy, said-I Eent a note by my son on Friday, and told him to give it to his master and bring back his books, as It was so late. I had forgot to mention in the note for him to come home, and so I sent that as a message by my son. I saw him when he came home. He had his head forward, and he staggered across the bar to me and began to cry. I said, " John, you have been punished " He was very palid. He brought the following note with him from Mr. May :- *Tower-biU Grammnar School. Deo. 18,1857. '"Sr,-I have frequently complained of your son being late In his attendance at school.

The witness here stated that the boy, who was a delicate child, had been before punished by the under-master. Mr. Sequevia, a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company, resident in Jewry.street, said,_l waz called to examine JOhn H. Grossmith between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening of Fridxy. He came hobbling in, evidently suffering from sorething which prevente his wi kibng astraight. I examined his legs and n onnted about 20 raost sevre con. tusrons, one almoit through the skin. I directed that he should go to bed direetly and keep perfectly quiet. The blao aPpeared to have been tery severe. There would have been a lesa appOr-ance if he had been a stronger boy. The marks may be vible a week or ten days to come. Mr. s obler.-The boy, ray Lord, has been constantly s a Ing away,ho nd ha e has been oin st an y In the hAbit of Tche evidence MAof pm. nt. I dobnoconsider this (pointingitohamln g hand noth be e th ic a e w hiah was exhibited) a fit instrument foruthespunishmentUofya boy of the age of 10i tr. sobler said thee were present the fathers of several of the boys who were under istruction ine the school, and they and their boys, a gst many of whom wero in attendance, were ready to rove that the defendant was respected for his judgmentad humanity. Thegeneralonduct of the boy, too, would be desrtibed. The LoRD MAYOrt.-I really would rather leave it to another Court to decide whether a man is justified in using such an instrnment in punishing a child. I saw the boy's pern when thbe sommons was appied for, anl certaiy eriminals who have been flogged in .wgate have notahown such evidence of puishment. I observed, too, that the punishment hasd not been inflicted on the part to which it isually appied in the car s of boys. I believe tht at great deal more can be done in schoo by the exercre of another sort of authority. Others are of a different opnion, but oerporal punishment appears to me to be peuliarly pob- oetionable, except ini intances of uvoontrollable vice. t hetqu onher e is whether unnecessry violence has been used, and, as the character of the school is concerned, I would wish the case to be taken to the sessions. I am perfecty aware of the respectaibiity of Mir. May and the estbmation in which he is held, and I dare say he has no objection to go before another tribunal. Mr. May.-Certainly not, my Lord; but I wish to say a few words. This has beent simply an ctlparte statemewat, andjl wish to say something on the opposite side Yoa r Lordship has not heard anything of the gross insolence of that boy tome beforehanod. I wil merely stati that hore are a number of boys present who witnessed the whole transaction, excepting the kicking and striking Mr. Cattermole, whichx took place In the passage. Mr. Cattermole's face sti bears the msrks of the boy's violence; there Are prent a number of the fathers of the boys to testifyas to their opirion of the system pursued, and a number of older boys who have left the school, to give their opinion as to whether I am cruel or kInd to the boys. The LoRD MAYo R.-Is the practice of caing the boys sanctioned by the authorities? Mr. May.-Certainly. Mr. Grosamith aipd he was perfectly satisfied with what had fallen from the Lord Mayor upon the subject, and had nho desire to proceed any further in the matter. He would therefore willngly drop the prosecution if Mr. May would make a concession te the extent of expresing his regret for the severity of the infliction. Mr. May said he could not for a moment think of making as y apology for the course he had pursued. The LoRD MAYon.-I amd sure that it is better to take the case to the Quarter Sesasons- and I shall be glad to the responsibflity taken off my shoulders. b The rev. Mr. May -was then bound over in his own hecognievnes, to the amount of 10a, to appear at the next Quarter Sesons to onmwer the accusation, and Mr. Grossmith was bouLnd over to prosecute.

Banks, who, however, did not pay it, because it was signed when he was a minor, and he had received no money for it. Several judgments against Mr. Banks had been set aside on the ground that he woa in his minority when the debts were alleged to hAve been contracted.

It appeared that the proceedings originated from complaints madOeto the police by inhabitants and licensed victubleers of the district, the first asserting that these supper houses rendered inoperative the Act which required public. houses to be closed after 12 o'clock on Saturday oight, and the last that their business wa seriously injured by unlicensed persons keeping open at all hours and supplying exciseable articles to their customers. In consequence of these complaints the Excise authorities communicated with the poulce, and the result was six inforiations against eight prsona, occupying and owning six houses called supper- 910uses. The first informationwas against tMatilda Wood ana Police-sergeants Draper, Roberts, and Silverton proved that the house was watched for some timeo; that they gained admissaio infplain clothes on the morning in question; that great caution wasrusd in admitting them, the door being carefnuly guarded and a signal given on the admission of a customer - that they fouLnd the supper-rooms filled with persons o? both sexes, who wore being served with beer and spirits and water. Inspector Lester proved the ownership of the house, and that the business had been for a length of time conducted in the same way. The evidence of the sale of spirits was defective in one of the links, and the defendants were allowed the benefit of the doubt by Mr. BRA.DON, and no penalty was inflicted. A second informnation against the same persons for a similar infraction of the law on the 29th of Nlovember was next head. The evidence was similar in character, and supported by similar evidence, with this addition,-that the proof of the sale of exciseable liquors was made clear, and that the defendant, after the 22d of November, exercised greater caution in admitting guests, the outer door being kept on the lock, and no one admitted without a preconcerted signaL Mr. BEADON imposed the highest penalty, 501., on each defendant. An application for a mitigated fine was made. Mr. BEADON could see no grounds whatever for mitigation. The next case was against John Hoare, Henry Cox, and Joseph Gray, the keepers of the Waterford Arms, 15, Hay. market. The police proved that they visited the house on the morning of the 28th of November, and found about a dozen persons there. Some were drinking spirits and water, and some wine. The defendant Cox was seen to mix spirits and water for customers behind the bar. Mr. BEADON inflicted the full penalty of 601. on each defendant. The next case was against David Belaseo, of the Carlton Supper-rooms, 29, Haymarket. it was proved that on Sunday morning, the 29th of November, a number of persons were in the rooms, and were supplied with beer and brandy-and.wvater. Mr. Sleigh, for the defendant, made a strong appeal to the Bench, contending that the evidence was not sufficiently conclusive to justify the iniction of a penalty against the defendant. MIr. BRADON considered that the evidence brought the offence clearly home to the defendant, and therefore he mnst impose the fnU fie of 50. The next case Was agahiLt Elizabeth Harvey, of 13, Panton-street. Mr. Lewis, of Ely-place, pleaded " Guilty" for the de. fendant, and in mitigation urged {hat it was his client's first offence. Mr. Welsby did not wish to press with severity against any one who had a reasonable defence to offer. Mr. BK&DOX had no desire to put the law in force to its fuhlextent for a first offence, and woald therefore impo8e the mitigated fine of 251 The next case was againt Samuel Belasco, No. 6, Panton. street. The defendant pleaded "Guilty," and asserted that it was his first offenco. Inspector Iester said thiz was not the fact. The defendant hoped for a reduced penalty on account of the badness of trade. Mr. BXADON.-Why, your trade appears to be one of the best going. There were 25 peraons drinking in your house on Sundy morning. Detendint.-All my best customers have gone out to Ind and I can't expect much trade till we have peace. Fined 50?. Mr. BEADOXN expressed his entire approbation of the course adopted by the police to put an end to such an extensive system of liJegal trading. He bad very little doubt of the attention of the Legislature being attracted to these cases, and then the necessity for strengthening the law would be recognized.

B." and 51., from Mr. Miland have been received for the poor-box. WoRsEsrpsSTR.H-enry and Jane Alexander, husband and wife, were charged with the following robberies : C ing, a constable of the x division, was on duty in tbe hitechapel-road at 11 at night, when he saw the male prisoner come out of a publichouse with a pint of beer In ni , an d oross over to his wife. who had been rnanifestly waiting at the corner of a street for him. There had been numerous complaints for a long timue past by publicans of vexatious robberies being committed upon them, and, the prisoners' conduct appearing suspicious to him, he followed and questioned thein just as they were walking away with the pewter pot, and then took them back to the publican. The publican had been a severe sufferer by such frauds, and therefore gave charge of both prisoners, who were transferred at once to the station, where it was then noticed that the woman's hips presented a most unnatural distension. This induced an external manipulation, which resulted in her being intrusted to the care of the female searcher, and, as concealment was useless, she now acknowledged this distortion was produced by artificial means, and displayed to the eyes of the astoni6ed searcher a leathern belt secured round her waist, and to this, suspended by hooks all round her, was attached a row of as many pint and guart pewter rneasures as could at all be conveniently carriea. It was curious to see the publicans getting into the witness-box one after the other and identifying their pots so straugely recovered, all the publicans being from the same neighbourhood, and all but one swearing to the prisoners, either both or singly, as being in their houses just before the delinquents were taken. The male prisoner said,-I am very sorry, but we were both starving, for I have had no work now for seven weeks. I wish tosy thatmy wife did entirely by my direction. We are both guilty, of course, and should like to be tried by you. Mr. HLLMiL.-WeU, it is a great pity she yielded to your advice. I shall discharge her, but I shtll send you to the House of Correction for six months, with hard labour.

SouTrwA:ax-John Townsend and Eliza Townsend, man and wife, were charged with being concerned with others not in custody in steaing silk dresses of the value of nearly 200., the property of Mr. Samuel Holt, manufacturer, Manchester. It appeared that a few days ago the prosecutor's premises were robbed of a vast number of fashionable dresses by some person in his employ, and it being suspected that the pro. perty had been removed to London, a telegraphic message was forwarded to the metropolitan police. In conEequence of that, suspicion attached to persons residing in the district of this court, and the result was that the prisoners were given into custody. Sergeant Sanford, of the Manchester police, said that at an early hour that morning he went to No. 22, Thomasstreet, London-bridge, and saw the prisoners. They had just got out of bed, and he told them he suspected that they were connected in stealing a large quantity of valuable dresses from Manchester. They denied it, but, on his commencing to search the room the woman handed him a new dress, and under the bed he found another. There was nothing more to be found, and, the dresses being identified as a portion of tie stolen property, he took the prisoners Into custody. The actual thief was not yet apprehended, but he had no doubt he was not. far off, as the woman bad stated that two boxes were brought in a cab to her house, and they were opened and contained dresses. Two of them were given to her for the trouble of taldng care of them a little time, The male prisoner denied all knowledge Mr. yohn Smith, salesman to Mr. Samuel Holt, manufacturer, of Manchester, statedthat their warehouse had been robbed of property worth 1401., and he identified the dresses produced as a portion of the stolen property. Sergeant Sanford here asked for a rem ndi to commucate with Manchester, consequently the prisoners were ordered to be brought up to-morrowr.

WIMh2ER ASSIZES. WESTERN CIRCIJIT TA¶flTO.?, TUXSDAY, DEC. 22. THE LEIGH-WOODS' MIJURDE 4Pcforc Mr. Justice WILLES.) I John Beak, aged 30, was indicted for the wilful murder I ,of Charlotte !'ugaiey at Long Ashton, oa the 3lth of September. Mfr. Stone and Mr. Coleridge were counsel for the prisoner, instroted by Mr. Edwvard Chadwick, of Long Ashton, and M1r. T. M. Saunders, instracted by Mr. Harris, of Bath, defended the prisoner. This was a csOe which excied the greaet interest, it being the trial of the prisoner for the murder of the poor woman in Leigh-woode, near Clifton, in September last. Leigh-woods are situated close to the river Avon, but on the opposite side to the village of Clifton; they are extremely beautiful, and are the resort of all the pleasure-seekers of Bristol and Clifton. There is a par. ticular valley there, called Nightingale Valley, which is one of the most lovely spots In England, and it is to this ,alley the mind of the reader must be directed. On the top of the hill is a rabbit warren, surrounded by trees and underwood, and for the protection of the game a gamekeeper Is kept, who lives near the warren. The gnme. keeper's name is Worth. He is in the habit of walking all over this place daily. On the morning of the 10th of Sep. tembor Worth went his rounds examining every part closely, but he saw nothing uncommon, He did not pass that way again nntil half-past 5 in the afternoon, when, as he was looking about, he noticed a handkerchief on the ground, npparently saturated with blood. He then saw a pool of blood on the top of a precipice overlooldng Nightingale Valley, partly covered with mould. He looked over the precipice, and about 12 feet below, in a kind of natural vault, he saw what appeared to him to be a woman. He descended the hfll, and then he found it was the body of a woman completely laid out, the clothes being in perfect order; the body had not any shawi or bonnet on. There was no blood about it. Worth instantly went and fetched a policeman named Jones, and they then observed that the tbroat was cut and there was a hole In the temple. It was evident that a murder had been com. mltted. Worth and Jones then took the body to the New Inn at Rowrnhuam Ferry, which is a ferry over the river Avon, leading from the Hot Wells to Long Ashton and Leigh Woods. The body was exhibited to any one who came In order that it might be identified. The face and bead were much disfigured. On Monday, the 14th of September, an inquest was held, and at that time her clothes were removed from her person. The handkerchief and clothes were examined, and the letters "C. P." were upon them; bat no one came forward who could identify the person. A post mortem examination was made, and a bullet was found in the head, The teeth were very peculiar, having been stopped in a particular manner, and the surgeon therefore tools out the jaw. He had no doubt that the poor woman had been murdered, and, in his opinion, she had been first shot and then her throat had been cut. The question then came as to who she was, and by whom she had been murdered. The matter, of course, soon became known, and it was then found that a woman answering the description of the deceased had lived as cook in the service of Mr. Bythesea, at Freshford, near Bath. The servants there saw the clothes vhich had been found on the body, and they identified them as those of Charlotte Pugsley, the cook of Mr. Bythesea. She bad left her service on Wednesday, the 9th of September, with the prisoner. It then appeared that the prisoner bad formerly lived at Long Ashton, in the neigh. oourhood of Leigh Woods, and he had courted the deceased, but latterly he had been in the service of Captain Watkins, who resided at Daventry ; but the courtship between him and the deceased stil continued, notwithstauding the prisoner was a married man and had a vife living near Daventry. On Sunday, the 6th of September, the prisoner obtained permission from CaPtain Watkins (who unfortunately met with that dreadful accident the other day on the South Devon Railway) to go out for a week. He stated that bhsfather wasabuilder atBath, and had fallen from a scaffold and broken his thighs; that his sister was so much frightened that she had died, and he wished, therefore, to go and see his fether at Bath. He left Daventry on Sunday the 6th of September. On Monday the 7th of September the prisoner caUled at a shop in Bristol kept by a tailor named Aplin, and he there ordered a coat, and in measuring him Aplin saw that he had a pistol in his breastpocket; he said he was goitg to Bath. Between 3 and 4 o'clock on Wednesday the 9th of September he went to Mr. Bythesea's, and gave the servants to understand that hs master, Captain Watkins, had discharged all his servtans and had gone to India, and that, according to previous arrangement, he had oome to fetch Charlotte Pugaley; that they were going to Southamptonto be married, an were then going to America. He assisted in cordin three boxes belonging to Charlotte Pugeley, which contained al she had In the world. He directed them in his own name, " Beale, Bristol." The housekeeper of Mr. Bythesea asked him as he was going to Southampton why he went to Bristol, and he said he had some business to transact there. The prisoner and Charlotte Pugeley then left Mr. Bytheseaes together. They went, accompanied by the butler, to the Fre ord station, but finding the train did not stop there they walked to Lymply Stoke station, the butler carrying Charlotte's shawl' and carpetbag. The prisoner and Cbarlotte then got into the train sad proceeded on their way. The luggage was forwarded by another train after them. Tba prisoner and a woman were at the rallway station at Bristol waiting for the arrival of the 9.40 train ; the prisoner then selected the luggage, but as it came by another train the officer charged them 3s. 10d. for the carriage. The risoner demurred to this charge, and it was arranged that tne luggage, consisting of three boxes, should remain till the nextmorning. The Prisoner and the woman then left the station at 10 minutes bfore 10 o'clock. The next morning the prisoner and aswoman again went to the station, and after some discussion he paid the 3s. 10d. He then left the woman, and told the officer he was going to Liverpool, and he' had the boxes removed across to the Midland station at Bristol. They were put in the luggage-room, and he took the usual tickets for them. He then joined the woumn and they went away. This was on the morning of tho 10th of September, the day on which the murder was committed. In the course of that day he and a woman were seen going in the direction of Downhamferry. About 5 in the afternoon of that Thursday, the 10th of September, the deceased was seen by a person named Hancock at the foot of the hill leading to the warren; he could swear to her, because at first he thought it was his sweetheart, and he went and looked particularly at her; she was walking with a man who was unknovwn to him. On the top of the hill, near the scene of the murder. the prisoner and the deceased were seen by a man named Jackson walking together, apparently in a most affectionate manner; he had his arm round her waist, and she had her head upon his shoulder. What a feaful contrast to the dreadful crime that was shortly to be commited, and which it was evident the prisoner must for some days havehadincontemplation ! She atthattimewasconfidingin his love, and he was full of murderous intent,-for what reason it is dificult if not impossible to conjecture. From that moment the poor woman was never seen again alive. On the next day, Friday, the prisoner went to Aplin's shop for his coat, and said he had been having a glorious spree at Bath. On the Saturday morning the three boxes were fetched from the Midland station, and on the evening of that day the prisoner arrived at Daventry, having three boxes with him, which were taken to Captain Watkins's. The prisoner told his fellow-servants that he had buried his sister, that he had maintained her a long time, and he had brought away all her clothes, which were in the boXes. On the Monday morning he gave the wife of a shoemaker in the neighbourhood, a sUk dress and other articles, all of which had been the property of this unfortunate woman. He told the shoemapker's wife that they had belonged to his sister. In a cupboard in the prisoner's room the keys of the boxes were found, as well as two pistols, one of which was loaded and the other was unloaded. The buliet found in the head of the deceased fitted these pistols. In one of the boxes were three new dresses, which the poor woman had bought for her marriage. The prisoner had dealt in lies. Captain Watkins had not left Daventry; the prisoner's father had not met with an accident; and his sister was not dead. He must have contempLated this act before he left Daventry, for he had brought the pistol with him and had it in his pocket when Ie deluded his poor victim and took her from her place of service. A rmore deliberate, cruel, heartless, decided act of fearful murder could hardly be conceived. The case was got up with great care, for there was not a link in the chain wanting. The evidence given has proved the finding of the body the cause of death; the identity of the body by the clothes and tho teeth; the fact of the prisoner having courted her; his being in Bristol wvith the pistol; his going to Mr. Bytheseas and cording the boxes, and directing theor; the prisoner and the deceased leaving Mr. Bytheseas together, and going from the Lymply Stoke station to Bristol; the arrival in Bristol; the disprte about the luggage - the prisoner being seen s* Bristol and near Leigh-wood; Lis return to Daventry ; the tilding the boxes containing the deceased's clothes; the pistoLs and bullets, and a knife with blood on it; and the shawl the unfortunate woman wore on the day_,she left MIr. Bytheseas. al.r. ISAtNDESS addresed the jury for the prisoner. He did not deny that the body was that of Charlotte Pugsley, but be denied that tbe prisoner was the murderer. No motive had been shown, and he9 contended that the evidence of the risoner being with the woman near Leigh-wood was of too -oubtful a chnacter to justify the jury in finding the prisoner goilty. With regard to the pistol, the prisoner hadfoolislly, no doubt-been in the habit of carrying a pistol about him. The .ase, he sabmitted, was one of of extreme mystery. There was nothing to show but that this woman had gene from Bristol with somne other man, and the prisoner might foolishly ia-a taken away the poor woman's boxes, but eoven that not with any felonious intent. He then stbmitted that, even if the jury should be of opinion that the woman had met wh her death by the hands of the priro-e-, it did not necesarily follow that it was a murder. The death might even 'have been acci. dental. Mr. Justice WYLLES, in summing Up, said the prisoner -was charged with the wilful murder of Charlotte Pugsley. No doubt there were cases in which thb- charge of nurder contained an alternative of manslaughter-in which there might be evidence to reduce it to sometbing lees than murder; but, with r-ference to the observations which the learned counsel had aodressedtothem, it was his duty tosay that If a person took away the life of another it was primd fadec murder, and there must be something to show it was not before a jury should jump to a conclusion that it was not the greater crime. There wag not in this case a shadow of evidence upon which, if they should be of opinion the prisoner took away the lire of the woman, they could in law or common sense find him guilty of anything less than the offence of murder. He thoughe it -ight to make these observations. because the learned coonoel had used an argument which was not founded on kh t JvSt or on the law, The woman was found ns4 only with a buUet in her brain, but with ber throat cut, anid 4herewereno apearaces fheravinmO an y resistance to teviolene offered to her. rlf ehienywere of oplnion that she ameto hr dathby te hndsof the prisoner they, ought to nd him guilty ofmuhrUdedr ; If they were not of that opinsion they ought to acquit him.

liDLAND CIRCmITr NVARWICK, Dxc. 21. tBef-ore Mr. Baron CHANELL.) EIBEZzLEMENT OF GOVF:RFYMVNY STORES, Thomas Williams was indioted for having on the 12th of October last feloniously sold and delivered to one Charles Clark certain stores of war, the property of the Queen, aad marked with the broad arrow-viz,, three Enfield rifles and 17 Enfield rifles without locks. In other counts the prisoner was oharged with receiving and having in his possession audeoncealing the same stores. Mr. Serjeant Hayes, Mr. Bodldn (specialy-retained), and Mx. Bittleston were counsel for the prosecation; and Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Elers for the defence. This was one of several prosecutions instituted by the War-office, in consequence of the discovery of an extensive system of fraudulent nisappropriation of Government stores by person s employed in the gun trade in Birmingham t seems that the course pursued -with respect to the manufacture and storing of the small arms made for the service of the State at Birmingham is this :-The Goverument have an establishment in Birmingham at a place called the lov er, where the prisoner was employed as a lockfreeer. There they receive from numerous contractors, in large quantities, the various parts of which a musket is composed -such as barrels, stooks, locks, sights, bayorets, &c., in a rough state; and these, after being subjected to some exam:ination, are marked with a Government mark and put into store. They are theyroperty of the War Department, and for the purpose of being made into guns are issued froi the Tower to other contractors, who are called " setters up," and who are responsible for the return of them. From the contractors, however, they pass into the hands of workmen employed by the contractors to execute the various processes which have to be performed upon them before they assume the form of a complete gun. These pDroceses are no fewer than 19, performed by different workmen; and at several stages in the progress of the work the materials are returned to the Tower to be viewed, and approved or condemned. Upon each of these examinations a fresh Government mark is stamped upon tbem; and if they are rejected a special mark, like a double R, is put on. In cAse of rejection, if the fault be in the workmanship, the materials are thrown upon the hands of the particular contractor, and he is debited with the value; but if the fault be found to have existed In the original material, then they are taken back by the Government and fresh materials given in exchange. Ver large quantities of these stores are always in the hands or Ithe contractors-the quantity being seldom, it ever, less than some 20,000 sets, and for some time past there has been a great loss of stores in the course of the process of manufacture. However, in the month of September last a communication was rnade to Mr. Goodman, the chairman of the small arms trade in Birmingham, which led to the discovery of some of these frauLds. That commiunication was made by a Mr. Charles Clarke, who was the principal wvitness against the prisoner, and whose statement was to the following effect:-The witnesa stated that he was a gunmaker in London, and In the habit of buying guns. In the early part of August he went to the King's Arms, Whittali-street, Birmingham, to engage men to work in London. While there, Williams, -whom he had known for some years, came in and said, "I want to speak to you." Witness went la with hi.i into the passag,, and he said, "IDo you wan .o buy ayMini6 rifles P' Witness said, '"Yes, it thLey are good ones." Williams said, "I know a man who has some." Witness asked when he could see them, and was told on the following day. On that dry vwitnessimetprisonerathis house, and saw a gun there, which was in an unfinisbed but a "screwed-together" state. Witness recognized it as being a Government gun, with the marks recently effaced. Prisoner asked 23s. each for 20 guns, though they were worth at least 50s. eaclh Witness promised to give an answer next day, and next day he went to prisoner's house. After tea prisoner asked him to come out for a few minutes, and in the street said, " Are you going to have these guns ?" Witness said, "Yes; when can I have them'l" Prisoner said, "In a week." Witness said, "Whycannot I havethem earlier?" alud prisoner, replied, " It will require fuUy a week to erase the marks, as it can only be done at night, as there is a young man working in the shop in the day." Witness begged to have the proof marksleftinthebarrelsalone, asit wouldsave him money, and prisoner agreed to do so; but he said that witness could not have them before the Friday. Wi'nesssaid that he would take 20 by Fziday; and the eveaing of that day was appointed. Prisoner said, " Well, we have nearly a hundred of them." Witness said, " If they all turn out as weU as the oneI have seen I wilU take the whole of them." On the 23d of September witness received in London from the prisoner the following letter :-"Sir-I wish to see you as quick as possible, for I am aU in reai4ness, and if other busines9 detains you please to send me 61. by return of post till you come, or you can send me the vhole amount, and I will send you the returns if you tmll s9ud me word how you will have them." On Friday, the25'h of September, witness called again at prisoner's house about 6 in the evening. Prisoner took him into a back room on the ground floor, and showed him a case con. talning 20 guns. He examined the top lot, and found them of the same kind as the one he had previously seen. Witness told prisoner that he was satisfied, and would pay him if he roould put them on to a cart and take them to his direction. Prisoner t-en went for a horse and cart, and the case was sent to the warehoun. of the Bridgewater Trustees directed to the witness. Witness then went to a publichouse with prisoner and paid him 231. At that time prisoner wished witness to give him an order for the other guns as quickly as possible. Oh tbe 3d of October witness wrote to prisoner to get 20 more gnus ready as soon as possible, and received the foUowingreply, dated October4:-"Ireceivedyour letter aud can accommiodate you with 17 low-price ones, those that I vas telling you of without stocks, and three of the others, maklng them up 20, as I want them out of the way as quick as possible before anything else. If I have no letter to con. trary by Tnecday I shaU get them ready and meet you on Friday next." On Friday the 9th witness again came to Birmingham and caUed on the prisoner. He said the guns bad been ready for some days. lWitness told him Le should not have the money til the next day. Prisoner pressed for 31., which witness gave him, and appointcd to pay the rest on Monday, the 12th. In the evening of that day witness called again at prisoner's house, and paid him the remainder-viz., 111. 10s.,-the price agreed upon being 23s. each for the screwed-up guns and l3s. each for the guns without locks. The former were worth S0s. and the latter 30s. Prisoner objected to take notes, and was paid in gold. The property consisted of three guns in the screwed-up state, and 17 rough stock guns without locks, 17 bayonets, and 17 ramrods. Upon all of them there were traces re. maining of the Government marks, though they had been very much effaced. These stores were also delivered to a carter to take to the warehouse of the Bridgewater Trustees. On the 15th of October witness wrote again to prisoner requesting him to get quickly the remainder of the 100 promised, and received in reply this letter on the 20th:- "Sir,-I am very sorry I cannot obhe you by the time, but Iwill try what I can do byFridayweek, andsendyouword." On the 26th witness again visited the prisoner, who then said that he could not furnish witness with 40 guns, as Turner's clerk had taken stock, the men were alarmed, and would not part with any more. Bat he said he bad six finished guns, which could be got ready in a week, and one steel-mounted rifle corps gun with all the marks in, ready for viewing, and they could take the marks out of that and let witness have it. Witness agreed to take them, and they were to be ready on the following Monday h but in the n eantime prisoner was apprehended. The statement of the witness was corroborated in material particulars by the evidence of a detective officer from London, who bad seen him and the prisoner together when the guncase was taken fronm the prisoner's house on the 12th of October; and the two cases of guns removed on the 25th of Sentemnberand the 12th of October were proved by the viewers employed at the Tower to be Government stores, baving some Government marks upon them and evidences of others. The head viewer, in particular, spoke positively to the fact, and deposed that they were not " wasters " or spoiled materials. He was cross-examined for the purpose of showing that materials with the Government inar)s on them might get legitimately into the market if they had been rejected for bad workmanship, anid he admitted that might be so, and that the mark of the rejection might be removed, but heldistinotly denied that the guns in question were of that sort. MIr. iClarke waa also sXeverely cross- examined as to his conaduct in leading the prisoner, as it Was suggested, into a trap, andas to hisknowledge of the Government marks. He admitted that something had been said a out " wasters"in his interview with the prisoner; but he denied that the guns in question were wasters. Mr. O'BRIEN in his address to the jury rested the prisoner's defence upon a failure, as he contended, In the evidence to establish the guilty knowledge of the prisoner, and he relied upon the difficulty which even the Government officers appeared to have in saying whether the guns, or any of he parts of them, had been rejected at the Tower as in the highest degree favourable to the prisoner, 'The learned J1DGE summed up the evidence with great care, and the jury found the prisoner Guilty. Sentence William Brueton and George Brueton were then indicted for stealing certain muskets, the property of their master, Thomas T'urner; and Thomas Williams was further indicted for aiding and abetting them in the commission of that felonv. In other counts the muskets were described as the property of the Qneen. 3Ir. Serjeant Hayes, Mr. Bodkin, and lMr. Bittleston werecounsel for the prosecution; M1r. O'Brien defended Williaus, and ifr. Elere defended the Bruetons. The evidenc8 in this case was the same to some extent as in the last; but it was proved in addition that Mr. Turner was a contractor with the Government for setting up small arms; that William Bruaebon had been employed by him as a gun-finisher, who worked in his own shop down to August last, and since then in Mr. Turner's nanufactory; that on the gth of October, in the avenig, Williams was seen coming out of Brueton's shop carrying guns; that Wiliams and the Braetons had been seen frequently together, and that several of the second lot of guns which Wiliams hiad sold to Clarke on the 12th of October bad upon them erasures in the pla¢e of marks, hod also some of the marks made by persons in Turners employment, who eexecuted earlier parts of the process than that for which the guns were Intrusted to Brueton. It was farther proved that Brueton when he was apprehended was found to be greatly deficient in his return of materials; for, according to the accounts kept by MWr.

"The people,, love good muic tas biuch as those who are coventionally styled their betters-" and It wau worthyc of remark that the nicest discrieination as well as the heartiest ue o ceeded froma the "1shilling area.s6t1 Po The programme was capital including three genLuine ex. ,mples of the madrigal style to which the 16th centcry gave birth-" Dowxn in a flowery vale" (Feats); "1Lady, see onk every side" (Luca Marenzio); a nd " Flora gave me fairest flowers" (Wilbye)-the first awo Itur, the lsot English.

Henry Smart's very beautiful pa rtsong, "The shepherd's farewell'"-al o an excerpt from the programme of the firnt concert-was hnge i,f possible, event better thin on the previous occasion, and re. demanded with equal unanimity. Two part-songs of merit-Mr. W. t . Macfarren's "H farvest song," and mur. S. WaIey's setting of the fine stanzas by Thomas Moore, lt the world ir ail a fleeting show," were both received with favour; and Mehdelssohp's genia and vigorous "Easter drinking song" (for male voic), although placed at the endox the concert, excited the utmost porsble interest. Besides these we had Pearsall's somewhat acmeyed "0 who wouild o'er the downs so free" (encored); a charming trio for female voice, " Forest bome" by Mr. Benedict (sung very much out of tune) ; andaDr. Hlors. cy's glee "nBy Cella's arbour," which was given with infinite smoothness and delicacy (by Messr. Heming, Pack, lisdby, and Stroudc), adding one more to tho iuterminable litofrpetitions. The inxtroduction of Sebastian Bach's magnificent Preludet and Fugue in A minor, before so vast and "mixed" an audience, entitled Miss Arabella Goddard to the credit of more than ordinary enthusiasm for the highest and most venerated models. To one who, like herself, re. gards music from a serious point of riew, and has studied it cm awore, with all the ardour of a true and aspiring devotee, the attention bestowedl upon this specimaen of so profound a mpster, and the applause won for it by her own faultless execution, must have been far more gratifying than the absolute upro,ar that fod lowed hEr performance of Thalberg's "iranscription" of "Home, sweethoma," and the showy arrangement of "A to Oeani," by the late Signor Fumagatiwhlch shesubstituted fo nh the "oncore." To Miss Goddard such displays as are involved in these "brillant fautaslas"l are rmere child's work; but to present as she presented the Prelude and Fugua of Bach coulId only have resulted from intense and perse. vering application, united to uncommon natural genius. We may reasonably believe that her heart was with Bach, just as uteh as her fingers were with Thalberg and Fuma. gli, who in their brightest moments are as distant from thelpi irac as the earth and the moon fromn th naaale Sirius. It is worth noting that the Pre. lude and Fsujue. introduced by Miss Goddard last night do not form part of the celebrated Clavier iden 2'emper6 (almost the only great work of Bach's familiarly known to pianists), but are lamong that seemingly inexhaustible ccliectlon which the musical press of Germany has for years beenx giving to the world, from the hitherto unaccountably neglected manuascripts of the niaster. The deepest science and the happiest invention are remarktable in every bar,
IN BE SLBIGH. TO TME EDITOR OF THE TIM-PS. Sir,-Some of the statements which appear in your report of yesterday's proceedings before Mr. Commissioner Holroyd being incorreot, I am directed, as the accoontast employed on the paper during the whole period, to state that one half-share of the Daily Teegraph was purchased by the present proprietor in August, 1856, for the sum of 2,40Ml, In which sum Colenel Sleigh was then indebted to hlm iuder a contract for printing the DaiZy Telegraph and for paper supplied to him at agreed prices. From August, 1856, to February, 1857, the journal was the jolnt property of the two, each paxty being entitled to an equal moiety, and in Febraary,11857, Colonel Sleigh sold his moiety to hs co-proprletorf for 2,0001., Ewhich amount was paid by the purchaser in the presence of the solicitor employed, abnd for which sum I hold Colonel Sleigh's receipt.

NORTHI WALES. -Another ehocking catastrophe has occurred in the Vale of NantlUe, so lately the scene of a dreadful accident of a similar character. On Monday six men were at work at the Dorothea Slateworks, in a pit known as the Fire Hole. A fresh "opening,"consisting of a channel about 15 yards long and seven or eight broad, was in progress preparatory to working the slate on each side, which rises perpendicularly to a height of about 30 yards. A powder. waggoa had JUSt been lowered into the pit, when an fin. mense mass of rock fel as suddenly as an avalanche upon the men. About 30 or 40 tons rested on a ga1lery above, overhanging the opening, and thus divided the rock in ita descent into two courses, which completely cut off all escape. One man ran a few paces after the faD, but his progess was arrested, and he was buried with the rest The sixth man was almost miraculously preserved. He was working apart from the others on hlgher ground, and the projecting rock partially sheltered him. A stone about six tons weight was seen to bound over his head, and, though struck by fragments and seriously injured, he ultimately succceded in reaching the area of the quarry. Blasting had frequently to be resorted to to recover the bodies, vwhich were not found until Friday evening. Relays of workmen searched during the whole week night and day without intermiesion. The bodies presented a frightful appearance. Some were terribly mutilated and nearly cut through, and one was perfectly flatten,ed by the weight upon him, the skull tora asunder, and the brain found seoarated close by. The names of the deceased are-WiDiam Pritchard, 60; John E3vans, 36 ; Thomas Jones, 34; Owen Morris, 26,; and Thomas Pritchard, 21. AU ecepting the last-named were mar.ied, and leave several children. Had the accident happened about three minutes sooner i all likehood but one life would have been sacrificed, as the rest had retired for a while from work. The entire fallUis estimated at several thousand tons, and the rubbish, irrespective of the enormous mass which lodged on the ledge, was piled to a height of eight ya-rds. TBx Co.mo2 LAW JuDroi BusmESS ComrmsSION.-The following letter was addressetby Sir George Grey, as Home Secretary of State, to Lord Chief Justice Campbell on the 27th of August last :- Whitehall, Aug. 27. My Lord,-Eaving carefully considered the report recently presented to Her Majesty from the commission appminted to inquire into the Common Law Judicial Business, of wvhich your Lordship was the head, I have much pleasure in expressing the obligation which Hfer Majesty's Government feel to your Lordship and to your colleagues in the commission for the careful attention given to the various subjects of their inquiry, and for the vauable recommendations contained in that report. No immediate steps can be taken with regard to such of the recommendations as requlre an alteration in the law in order to give effect to them; but there are others which Her Majesty's Government feel it their duty to act upon without delay. With this view they propose that, together with a speoial winter commission for criminal businees, a commission of assize and nWis psrius should be issued in the ensuing winter, for the disposal of civilbnsiness in Yorkshire andLancashire .1 am notaware that there: re any other places which are at present clearly knowvn to requiire such assistance; but, if your Lordship is of opinion that there are any other places which are likely to require it in the ensuing winter, I shall feel obliged if you will inform me of them. It is further proposed that a commission of assize and nisisprims shall be issued for the disposal of civil business at Bristol, at the close of the Spiing as well as the Summer Western Circuit. As the proposed remodelling of some of the circuits depends, to a certain extent. upon the separation of Manchester from Liverpool, and the granting a separatecivilandoriminalassizetothe city of Manchester and the borough and hundred of Salford, and -.s the recommendation of this grant has been very properly made subject to the provision of proper courts, judges' lodgings, and other accommodation, it appears to me that no steps can be taken with reference to this branch of the subject until such provision has been made. Upon this point I pro nose to communicate with the municipal authorities of Manchester and Salford, who may possibly require the aid of Parliament to enable them to do wha4 is required. The proposed consolidation of the Welsh counties wiU clearly require an Act of Parliament, but I trust t-hat it will be poesible to make arrangements to commence at the next Spring Assizes by which the rapidly increasing amolzut of bFesinesm in Glamorganshire may bo more satisfactorll7 disposed of by the attendance hereafter of two judges instead of one at Cardiff and Swansea. With reference to the ob.rvations of the Commisioners as to the London sittings at 7sisip pris during term. and the despatch of bueiness at the iadges' chambers, I feet that I best lischarge nmy duty by 1b.Nszg v4;: questins to the con ,deration of your lordsbip Xd of e-the other aosmaon law Judges.

MILITARY AND NA VAL INTBLLIGBNCE. The European, Australian, and Royal West lndian Mail Company's steamship Australasia, Captain Sceales, em. barked the head-quarters of the 68th Regiment at Ports. mouth Dockyard yesterday for India. They comprised 21 offioers and 450 rank and file. The offloers were Colonel H. Smyth, CB., commanding; Major H. Harpur Greer; Captains John Cassidy, IL W. T. Trent, Cavendish C. Fitzroy, and Herbert Vaughan; Ueutenants Aubrey H.Tuoker, Edward Deshon, Edmund P. Etheitan, John H. C. Sey. mour, T. Reeder Clark-on, O. E. Beaty-Pownall, and George F.

Applin. The Australasia is a monster of a steamer, but her spaoe seems sadly misappropriated; what with bunks, cabins, and saloons, 450 troops seem to choke her internal capaciiy, snd her consumption of coals, reported as about 120 or 130 tons per day, appears rutnous without an equivalent in the matter of speed. She drew 24 feet 9 inches forward cnd 23 aft on her going ifto Portsmouth harbour, rendering her pilotage a test of the skill and nerve of the pilot (Mr. Richards), as there were barely 6 inches of water between her keel and the bar of the barbour, the wind blowing agale. Onb er going ot again yesterday she was somewhat circumstanced, bat better trimmed,the windblowing nearly agale from the S.W. Nevertheless she was capitally navigated, and her troops loudly cheered on their route to Spitbead, which they will leave to-day, weather permitting. The following detachments of regimentb are under orders to embark at Portsmouth in the CospVAtrick for the Cape of Good Hope :-2d Foot, 2 officers and 50 men; 6th Foot, 1 officer and 98 men; 45th, 48 men; 60th (2d battalion), 3 officers and 68 men; 73d, 2 offlcers and 59 men; 80th, 1 officer and 72 men; 85th, 1 officer and 55 men; also a number of soldiers' wives and children. The following are also ordered to embark at Portsmouth in the Sir George Pollock for the West Indies :-41st Foot, 1 officer and 131 men ; 49th, 1 officer and 124 men. On Monday night an order was received at Chatham garrison oountermanding the order for the embarcation yesterday of the reinforoements for the 18th Royal Irish, 51stLight Infantry, 83d, 86th, and 08th Regiments on board the Salamanca, for Bombay and Kurrachee, and it is uncertain what day the detachments will leave Chatham. Yesterday an occurrence took place at Ckatham garrison whlch caused much excitement among the reinforcements nnder orders to embark for India in the Salamanca India. man. On Colonel W. HL Eden, the Commandant of Chatham garrison, inspecting the Indiau reinforcements on Mon. day afternoon he put the usual question to the troops as to whether any man had a complaint to make. Two sergeants of the 51st LIght Infantry immediately stepped to the front and Informed the Commandant that the troops of that depot under orders for embareation had been each made to pay the sum of 21. 2s. 6d. for his sea-kit, when the same contractor waas only charging the snm of 11. 17s, lld. to other depOts about to embark in the same vesseL This the non-commissioned officers and men looked upon as a great grievance, especially as they were required to pay for their sea-kit themselves. On receiving the complaint Colonel Eden immediately summoned the commanding officers of the several depOts and inspected the aocounts, when the statements of s Tbsergeants were found to be correct. A board of officers i v as consequently ordered to assemble at Chatham garrison E esterday to investigate the matter, when it was found that the depot of the 18th Royal Irish had also been overcbarged, and also that each man had been overcharged 2s. for his tobacco. On receipt of the report dra wn up by theboard, Colonel Eden Immediately ordered the price o! |nh man's sea-kit to be reduced from 21. 2s. 6d. to 1 16s. 7d. AIr. J. W.

The weather prevented any rwsults of importance being arrived at. The Ardent, 5, paddle sloop, Commander Cave, was ordered to sail from Portsmouth, yesterday, for the coast Of Africa, calling at Plymouth, but had not left at dark last night. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:_ Lieutenant M. E. Porter, to the Vesuvius, for disposal; Lieutenant J. . Stewart, to the Ganges, for disposal; Valentine G.

Sir,-I have had the honour to submit to Her Majesty the Queen the purport of the petition which Sir George Grey had forwarded to me, and which is addressed to Her Majesty, although it is not usual for any committee, or any other body, to address Her Majesty personally through the medium of their scretary. The subscription to which you ask Her Majesty to contribute is one raised among the inhabitants of Woolwich Charlton, and Plumstead for the relief of the wives of the soldiers of one particular corps who have been quartered in that neighbourhood. I am commanded to inform you in reply that it would be contrary to established rule for Her Majestyto join a local subscription, nor couldthe Queen contribute to the assistanoe of the wives of one particular portion of the soldiers in Her Majesty's service who are suffering under the unavoidable separation from their husbands, which has been equally borne by the wives of soldiers of other branches of the army who may have been quartered throuphout the united kingdom. Her Majesty feels much for the hardships which this separation, necessitated bv the nature oi the service, must cause to these poor women, and cannot hut feel pleasure at the sympathy and kInud assistan ce wvhichtheir neighbours are willing to extend to them.-I have the honour to be, &c., 0.

After several speeches, iu the course of which the qualificatios of the various candidates were discussed, the Cours reduced the list for the majority to three. The lot fell upon Colonel Harvey, Captain Chaproniure, and Captain Curling, the senior captain bf the regiment, who had received highly satisfactory testimonials from the colonel and other ofticers as to his capabltties as a field officer, mere especially durig his residence in the camp at tldershott, Hlis friends (many of whom were present) contendedthatheoughtnotetobhepassed over. The majority of the commIssioners, howvever, were of a different opinion. It was asserted that an officer of 30 years' experience in the ina who had seen foreign service was better qualified, especally one who had graduated from the position of ensign to that of lientenant-colonel, and who had only now reached his 47thyear. Such a man would do honour and credit to the regiment. Colonel Harvey was elected by a very large majority. The vacancies for companies were filled by promotion in the regiment. Lieutenant E. Vere Jones (the senior lieutenant) and Lieutenant Andrews were made captains. The colonel reported that the new head-quarters would he occupied by the staff on New-yeals day. The quartermaster, who had been in some time, was arranging and prepargthor om The arms and accoutrements were bein ldeaned and arranged in proper order. The officers' and sergeants' mess utensils and furniture had also been removed from Oliver's yard to the new head-quarters. Mlr. H. F. Golding and Mr. Thurlby Snmith, of 16 and IS years of age were appointed ensigns, and ordered to qu%lify themselves by drilling with the Coldstream Guards, and to be ready for duty in Febray, when It is expected the regement will be embodied and ordered to their old quarters in the camp at Aldershott. A flagstaff was ordered for the building, with a Standard and Union Jack. The now head-quarters contain 60 rooms for the sergeants, drummers, and non-commissioned officers, a messroom for the sergeants, another for the band; armouries for 10 companles, each separate from the other; armoury shop and forge; a meesroom for the commissioned officers, a reading-room, cloak-room, and lavatories. There are separate quarters for the adjutant, sergeant-major, quartermaster, and surgeon. The commandmg officer has apartments overlooking the Artillery-ground. The whole is lighted with gas, and fitted with every requisite for a regiment of soldiers. The building is of a substantial charaoter, and does great credit to the liberalty and patriotism of the citizens of London. While, on the one hand, there has been no useless or wasteful expenditure on the building, so, on the other, no pains have been spared to insure comfort and convenience to those who are to occupy it, and which it is believed will rank second to none of Its class in the kingdom.
CRYSTAL PALACZ.-ONR SIILINIG DAY, Tuesday, Dec. 22.-Admissions on payment, 434; ditto, by eason tickets, 259; total visitors, 693. FATAI Bo.-iTmR ExPLosiOm.-A frightfu acident occurred at Thorne-moor Ends, near Thorne, Yorksuire, on Saturday afternoon last, with a steam thrashing-machine, owing, it is to be feared, to the ignorance and incompetency of the proprietor of it, a person named Thomas Johnson, residing at £horne, who obtainod a livelihood by travelling abrout the rua districts with a portable thrashing-machine and other agricultural implements, which he let out on hire, and generally superintended the operations himself. On Satarday morning his thrashing-engine was employed on the farm premises of Mr. RidgUil an was immediately after. wards taken to the stackyard of Mr. Z. Maud, where it was being got ready for work in the presence of several labour. ing men and boys, when the boiler saddenly barst with a tremendous noise, scattering death snd destruction around. The rUpture took place just above the near side of the fnre-box, and the engine was rent into numherless pieces, the lower part of the framework being twisted completely round. Johnson, who just before the accident was observed standing in front of the fire-box oiling the engine, and having one hand on the safety-valve, was found a short distance from the machine quite dead-his si i1 being fractured, the brain protruding, and blood flowing copiously. A son of Mr. Maud, a boy aboat seven years of age, was also killed on the spot; a son of Mr. tidgill, a youth 14 years old, had one of his legs broken in two places and his left cheek laid open, and died soon after the accident. Another son of Mr. Ridgill, aged 16, was blown completely out of the stack-yard into a ditch about 15 yards off, and was so seriously scalded that he is not likely to recover. A third son of Mr. Ridgill, aged 12 years, was blown into A neighbouring field about 10 yards off, and also sustained serious injuries in the face and neck from scalding. A haystack was blown completely over, aud some men near it had a narrow wcrape from being smothersd. Portions of the engine were found in all directions; the flywheel was broken to atoms, and the "man-hole" door, a piece of iron about 2:} stones in weight, was projected a distance of 154 yards from the engine. An inquest on the bodies of the persons killed was held at the White Hart Tavern on Monday afternoon by Mr. W. Marratt, coroner, Doncaster. From the evidence then adduced it appears that when the engine was taken from Mr. Ridgill's to Mr. aud's farm there was a fire in tho box and a quantity of water in the boiler. Just before leaving Mr. Ridglll's premises. Fox, an assistant of Johnson, raised the screw of the safety-valve to let off the steam, which was then blowing very fast. Johnson, however, shortly afterwards screwed down the valve again to the lowest point (showing a pressure of 451b. to the square inch), and at the same time added some coal to the fire. When the engine arrived at Mr. Maud's stack-yard there was stllU water in the boiler, Fox Ascertaining this by the gauge-taps, the glass tube used for an index being broken. The engine was got ready in the ordinary manner; Fox was rivetting a strap, and Johnson was oiling the engine ,eparatory to its starting-the latter having his left hand on the safety-valve, thus cansing additional pressure-when the explosion took place. It seems that the machine had been in the possession of Johnson for several years, and it is supposed that the boiler had bec-ome too thin to resist the pressure applied to it ; but as there was no professional evidence on this point the coroner suggested that the inquiry should be adjourned to a future day for the purpose of obtaining the opinion of some competent person on the subject. The jury assented to this course, and handed to the coroner the names of several persons versed in the construction of steam-engines, one of whom (Ur. Marratt) they promised to have in attendance at the resumed investigation, which is to take place on Tnesday next. It was stated that Johnson's late foreman had frequently had to ease the safety valve of his master's engine to prevent an explosion, and the coroner ordered this person to be summoned to give evidence at the adjourned inquest.
