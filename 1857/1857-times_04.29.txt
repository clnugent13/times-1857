TBE Hop DUTY.-Every one who has paid the slightest attention to the course of the hop question cn.i not fail to have remarked that if the nature and hats of that plant be erratic, itg growth uncertain, and ite developement precarious, the career of those who pursue Lk cultivation as a calliun exhibits not a few peculiarities of similar character. The eourse of the hop plantes hs been "erratic" enough, and not a little "nnoertain" At one time sinking under the preseure of an enormons duty, they have been found knockhg at the door in Downing. street, with earnest vehemenoe beseeehing a remision od the tax; at another, when the burden has been somewhat, though scarcely less oppressive, the cry has been for post, ponement of the duty; while a third season and abundant growth-that abundance which in the case of all other prow duoe is deemed by mankind a bleeing-has ent them again suppliants to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, boldly de. m&nding to have their coaling altogether relieved from an impost the direct operation of which is to render the bounty of Providence a curse, and the success of the hun. bandman's toil a disaster. A fourth occasion hu found them again besieging the Minister of the day for a partial reduction of the duty by the reDeal of the war tax, while " act the fifth" has ushered in the prod posal of an acreage duty, a system of bonding, or some other scheme for ehifting the load or alleviatingits pressw And, as if to render the hop duty question a special ese by itself, the curtain has sometimes drawn up with at the sixth, displaying the extraordinay spectale of a sdect claSF of hopgrowfeu positively petihomng~ the Chancellor of the Exchequer not to remove n atom of the duty. Ka, though we confess we write down the words with Ite hope of obtaining credence, plnters have been found to declare their readiness to pa * duty double in amount rather than have a fraction taken off the existing impost. These are plain facts, and under such a ste of things it h no matter of surprise that, with the exception of oocasiona postponement, and in one speal and imperative case of entire remission, the prayers of the planters he remaine unheeded. Never ahering for twro consecutive years to the same demand-now takhng up the question, now laying it down-for a few months " red hot" for one stbject, only to subside into quiescence for a subsequent indefmnite perioaI -who can wonder that Minixters have listened to the com< pladnts of the planters, only coolly to dismiss them to their ho.mesto agee upon some practical remedy ? Chaneellor of the Excheguer have found relief from these appeals is a cause whioh those unversed in the arcan of this qutl would little dream of-Damel!, in seasons of short crope and blight. In other productive occupations the very es. senco of prosperity, the life-blood of success, is "a eroM J with the hop-planter it is far otherwise; a failure, whaefr by storm or blight. is a perfect godsend a failure relieves the banter from the claims for duty wEich a crop would entail, and, creating a scarcity, rapidly runs up, by a nza tural sequence, the price of the article. The vesl "right' and the planters stealthily, lily, and with a half-hope tiq their defection may be unobserved, cease all appeals to Downing-street, suspend their complaints, and forego al claim or attempt to procure emancipation from ihe thral. dom and disaster which but a few months earlier hl brought them on their own confession, to the verge of bankruptcy. et those who have watched the course of the planters say whether this be not a true picture. Whet Is their position at thbi moment? The "scold fit" halated for a year or two. Very high prioes prevailed; old wounds were healed and wrongs were forgotten. Two wasons of heavy growth-one of unparalleled abundance-have sines follo ed, and the pressure of bhe duty has begun to tIl. The ' hot fit " is now on, and the planters are once more about to renew their appeal to the Chancellor of the Excheq!aer, and to beg for time to enable them to raise the oppressave levy which the cooming month of May will cll for. In a word, the planters are going toSirGeorge Corueq wall Lewis to pray for a postponement of the Way inxtal. ment of duty. Havingdun last er pid a duty of some 800,0001. for the crop of 1855, D, prices hav wing to so enormous a crop and to the subsequent lge g 1856, fallen to an extremely low range, the hopplante find themselves in no conditiontomet the whih the Excise will in a few week make uponthem inpectof the first moiety of the duty on lat autumn's cro ad the! are therefore abnt So present thense to Dowrng as suitors, in fomd pvalupits, for " time."-Suex 4ub LAdrtilsoment -Preac.ft and PrewXing.-On te sat tray of pbe Rled.peis 'e.cfsb" for ssvsahar the t Grea<tt Beameois cC eIsb* andorfossotltede t i esnorSI and o al ountres Part L wll ecutela itoaln RkofO,ebe Greek a = tlauu =~e1n, Athacadus D yi fJuse, ihset1esia etebes Of ea.

ONY-MARBY cand C"Y Tuesda7 EvenLng, Tflhe quotatlon of gold at Paris is about 6 per 1nllle premiam, and tie short exchange on London Xs 25.25 per 11. aterling. On comparing these rates 'with the EDnglish Mint price of 31. 17s. 10id. per ounce for standard galdX it appe2s that gold is nearly 3-Oths per cent, dearer in Paris than In Liondon. By adviees from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13 S per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English In price is therefore about 3-IOths per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in London. The ours of exchange at Nevr York on Londonfor bi3s at 60 days' aight is 1082 to 109 per cent., which, when compared with the Mnt par between the two coumtries, ehows that the exchange is agaiust EngLand; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difTerence of interest, the preaent rate eaves no profit on the transmision of gold either way between England and America. T'he funds have again been dull to-day, but have not experienced any further permanenat decline. Shor'tIy after the commencement of business there was some disposition towards a recovery of confidence, which was checked by the Bank having refused to make loans on Government securities at 7 per cent. for a longer period than a week-a term adopted a short time back, but which had subseqnently been extended to a fortnight. Consols for money wzere first quoted 924 to i, whence they improvedto 92&. Afall then occurred to 924to 4, and the final transactions were at 92 to aa for money, 924 to j for the 7th of May, and 934 t 4 for the new account on the 4th of June. The stringent course adopted by the Bank with regard to advances upon stock was understood to have been caused by a great renewal of activity in the demand for discount, which renders it proper that their resources, instead of being employed to enable perOns to hold speculative investment, should be kept avlable fox legitimate commeial uwes. This augmnented pressure has suggested the poasible necessity of a further advance in their minimum rate, but there has again been an absence of gold withdrawals, and the balance of opinion is that no immediate movement of that description will be found requleite. It is also thought that if the present week should pass over without further difficulty, the amounts now overdue from Australia, together with those to arrive from the West Indies, and to be looked for henceforth from New York, nay be expected to prove sufficient to prevent, for some tlme to come, any increase of inconvenience. Bank Stoclk left off at 213 to 215; Reduced, 914 to4i; Neo Three per Cents., 91A to ; mdia Sto 220 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, 984 to; Inda Bonds, 8s. to 4x. dlscount; and cxchequer-bills tJune) 5s. to is. discount, (March) 2s. discount to 2%premium. Foreign securities were heavy, and no important leeovery took place to the close of business. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 924, 92i,i, and 03, and for the aecount at 934, 92j, and 4. In the Four per Cents. guarauteed the transactions took place at 994. The general operations comprised-Brazilian Four-and-a-Hall per Cents., new, 98i; the Five per Cents., new, 994; Granada Deferred, 64; Guatemala, 56; Mexican Three per Cents., 23kand+; Dutch Two-and-aHalf per Cents., 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 97i. InI the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no important alteration from last post. The fall on the Paris Bourse makes rapid progress, and prices to-day have reached a point lower than for some time past. The final quotation of the T;hree per Cents. was 68f. 95c., showing a further decline of i per cent., and the approaching monthly settlement seems likely to be accompanied by much pressure. The invitation for subscriptions to the Russian Railway scheme was issued to-day by Messr. Baring. Each application is to be accompanied by a deposit of 21. per share, and the amount of the first instalment will be 61. The Russian Government are stated by telegraph to be about to remove the prohibition against the exportation of gold. This is probably intended to operate favourably on the Pailway schemoe as a display of confidence, and it may have been rendered practicable by the temporary ability which the pay. ment of the deposit upon the shares about to be issued will give to the Government to draw funds from Paris and London. The New York advices this week describe no material change in the Stock-market. There had been some tendency towards recovery, but the expectation that shipments of specie to England would soon have to be resumed had created a feeling of caution. The 64,0001. brought by the present packet is all for the Bank of France. Erie Railway Stock was quoted 52; Reading, 80; Panama 92 to 4; New York Central, 874 to 4; and IMlinozs Central, 131 to i; the bonds, 100. Notwithstanding the pressure for money on this side it is evident that much of our capital continues to be drawn to America, since the last arrival at New York is sid to have announced the successful negotiation in London of 200,0001. in the bonds of one of the Western railroads. These transactions are generally managed through ironmasters who interest themselves in the negotiation in consideration of the orders for rails. Intelligence bad been received that the Commissioners appointed by General Concha to examine the guano deposits in the neighbourhood of Cuba had returned, and reported the existence of immense quantities. In some of the eaves the quality is alleged to be superior, and as highly impregnated with ammonia as the best Peruvian. From California the accounts were more favourable than for some timne past, not only as regards the mining, but a]so the agricultural and trading interests. The last. steamer from San Francisco bad taken 74,0001. for England, which will probably arrive by the next WSest India steamer. According to the advicos from Havannah the West India intercolonial steamer Solent touched at that polt on the 8th inst., on her way from Vera Cruz to St. Thomas with a freight of 350,0001. in Mexican silver for the homeward mail. In consequence of attempts which have been lately made to injure the Bank of London the directors have issued the following circular to their shareholders. The only way to deal with such circunmstances is by thus meeting them openly and challenging inquiry:- "O Gentlemen,-Yoa are probably aware that statements, strongly reflecting on the character of the directors of this bank, and calculated to prejudice its interests, have been of late industriously ciroulated. The progress of the business has not in any way indicated that such statements have affected publio confdence; yet it is evident to the directors that the highest credit is liable to be shaken by a bold reiteration of calumnies, if uncontradicted, and they feel Ybat your interests andl. their own position alike demand tke refutation of such malicious aspersions, although proceeding from a very obscure source. " With this view the Board have already taken the opinion of eminent counsel, and, under their advice, pro. ceedings rill, at the earliest possible moment, be coin,menced against all persons whom the law can reach. "Mieanwhile, the directors desire to assure the share. holdeis, in the most direct and positive manner, tAhat the Imsutat,ons sought to be conveyed by such statements are entirely false and groundiess, and that the business of the bank is i a perfectly sound and satisfactory condition. " I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, "Your very obedient servant, BENJAM&l SCOTT, Secretary. Threadneedle-street, April 28." A special meeting of the London and Eastern Banking Company was held to-day, Colonel Tucker presiding, to receive a report from the directors sanctioned by the Committee of Investigation. It entered into the arrangements effected with the Oriental and other banks for liquidating outstanding engagements, and referred to the progress of the administration up to the 11th of April. It appears that the liabilities of the bank have been reduced between the 11th of March and that date from 397,7341. to 340,2401., and that the general assets remaining are estimated to yield 16,0521. above the estimates made on the 23d of March. The securities held for the debt due from Colonel Waugh will, it is nQw thought, not realize by 38,0001. the sum estimated at that date, and the result is that the estmated surplus of 15,7181., as then exhibited, is mow chmaged to a deficiency of 6,2301. There was no discussion, and the report was adopted, resolutions being subsequently passed continuing the servioes of the committee and appointing Mr. Stuart, of the Oriental Bank, the manager, to proceed with the liquidation. The reason asigned in the report for not at present entering into full statements of tho transactions in which the directors and officials bave been ersonally engaged is that "it might impair the ue progress of the administration." At a special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Company to-day, Mr. Ravenshaw in the chair, it was proposed to fill up the vacancies in the direc- tlon caused by the late resignations. The chairman explained that it would be necessry to reorganize he Board with asolttlg~fay as possible, since there various important colonial points which reqaire attention, whilo also arrangements have to be made for securing the Act reducing the number of director. The members of the existing Board who propose to rermain are Mx. Ravenshaw (the governor), Mr. Davidson, and A[r. Thornton. Po supply the vacancies, the nominations are Mr. Leslie as deputy-governor, in the place of Mr. Bruce, Mr. R. R. Brown, Mr. J. Goodson, and Mr. J. G. Cattley; and it was added that if the shareholders wish Mr. Do Salis to be admitted to a "eat,there will be no opposition. On the proposal that Mr. Leslie should be appointed deputy-governor a lengthened discussion ensued, and an amendment was moved in favtour of Mr. De Sails. Mr. De Salis, however, intimated that unless the decision were unanimous he should decline to accept the post. On a show of hands the numbers were declared tobe 25 f6r Mr. De Salis and13 for Mr.Lelie but a ballot was immediately demanded, which wili be taken on a future day. Mesrs. Brown, Goodson, and Cattley were then elected. The weekly reviews frora the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce markets' state that business was rather more active and that prices were well sup ported. In coffee the operations had not been numerous, but quotations continued to be mamntained. Little alteration had occurred in raw sugar, but refined was in greater demand at advanced rates. Although the transactions in tea and indigo had not been numerous prices generally showed firmness. The accounts from Rouen mentioA that the market for manufactures was heavy. Advices from Hongkong stste that the local insurance offices have resolved on nlaking an addition of J per cent. to the rateaof premium lately charged on vessels from Foo-chooan4 Sharnghai to ports in Etigland and America, with &return of J per cent. if the vessels are towed to sea by steanm. In consequence of this measure it was expected thatiteamera would be placed on the Shanghai river and the Mn. At the Court of Bankrtptoy to-day Mx. S. Adams, of the Ware and, Hertford Bank, passed his adjourned last examination. The Committee of Spanish American Bondholders, in answer to their application that the holders of Peruvian bonds, issued.in payment of the debt of Peru to the States of New Granada and of Eeuador, might receive the dividends thereon by the transmission of the coupons to New York instead of the bonds themselves, as had been- heretofore required, have received an intimation from the Foreign-office to the effect that through the intervention of the British Charg6d'Affaires the iesidenthas consented that the coupons shall be paid, provided they are accompanied by a certificate from the financial igents of Peru in England and signed by the resident Minister of the Republic in this country, proving that the coupons have been cut from the original bonds. The annexed refers to the communications lately inserted on ohartered banks - " Sir,-In ' J. R.'s' letter, inserted in your city article of Saturday evening, the Ohartered Baak of Indi, Australia, and China is omitted in the list of banks enumeratod as enjoying Royal charters of limited liability, and which, Indeed, is the only bank possesng the same powers as the Oriental Bank corporation. "I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, "3J. R.MXI' The following relates to the decree just published regarding the sinking fumd for the Peruvian debt:- " Sir,-Af authorities on international law have held as an established principle that the foreign creditorg of a State take precedence of all domestic clajinints. Let us see, then, howr the Government of Peru has respected this principle in the recent decree relative to t.he si4king fund on the debts therein mentioned. "By it the Anglo-Peruvian Four-and-H-Eall per Cents. are to have 7 per cent., the Three per Cents. stand where they were at 3 per cent., the Internal Debt is to have 5 per cent., and the Uribarren and Hegan Bonds (part of the Internal Debt converted Into sterling) are to have 4 per cent., besides the arrears. "3 t is thus clear that if the above debts are extinguisbed the Government intends that the extinction al go on nearly pari paSsu, and that,if the guano should be e=hausted before, they shall all be in the same boat. This is a serious injustice to the holders of the Anglo-Peruvian Debt, who not only have a very great priority of claim, but the natural position of whose bonds is that of first mortgage, and with a right to liquidation long before the others, To place the old bonds in their just positon, and to secure their liquidation be.ore the guano of the C hia Idands is exhausted, they ought at least to have a rinldng fund of 10 per cent, on the Four-and-a-Hal, and of 6 per Cent. on the Three per Cent. Bonds. "The wrong is the greater when the fact is remembered that the Uribarren and Hegan Bonds had their i fund raised fromn to 4 per cent. by the ex-g ulfo, for the express purpose of making them go down In this market -a poit of vital importance to hin, and to the President and favourites of the late Administration, who were all deeply interested in putting them upon the Britsh publio. Of course,Rodulfo?s action was approved by the ex-Presldent, but he (Echenique), fearing future impeachment for this and other aets of hia Administration, took the precaution to obtain the approval of the then Congress (the major part of which body he had made his creatures) to all his financW doings.

GUAMO. TO TEl EDITOR OF XE TIMES. Sir,-Theoquettion of thoe quantity f guano probably re md&niDg on the centr"l grOup, orXChIn&h Islands of Peru, h4 fallenlInto. abonAcs, but it nso of mueh Imporanoo t 3ritish intereats that,it ought not to be lost gjht' of. To come to an approximato idea on. thi point zdfereoa must be mAde to formier surreys and estimates .(pacularly to those of 153) and to the quantity since extrat . In August, 53, Senor 1lis; (who thesi ha the contract for embarking guno at- those Islands), in 215l Memorable lettetothelmePrerident,:Echeniqui, states thatt-'the rato it was then being taken- away thbo quantity re.mining Would only last eight years longer; and, a ater aying that OD the principal island %ibo northern) two rocks had made their appearance-one with an elevation already of 30 feet, and the other of 10 feet-pertinently adds, " without any one being able to-eatimnate their futur extension and heght, nor whether in that or the other islands rock or the same or greater size may not alo be found." He further states that 2,085,000 tons had, been tken away in the 12 years preceding. In the following month Mr. Wlntosh surveyed the iids, by order of Admiral Moresby, who reported to the Admiralty that at the then zate of extrcton they would be extausted of guano that would pay freight in 8 or 9 yeaS Mr. WIntosh acknowledges that his eamination "was. exoOedingly rough and imperfect," yet does not hesitate to pledge himself that "the quantity specified is greater than that absolutely remaining on the Islands." Towards the cleso ofthe same yer (1853) the Peruvian Goi'ernment appointed a commission to survey those iFlands, and invited several foreigners to be present; bit, as facilities were not afforde for their general attendance, the only one present was a clerk in the house of Qibbs and Co. The commisdon reported the quantity of guano re malning to be 12,376,100 tons, but this estuiate was viewed in LTia with a crtain suspicion, 'as it waa obviously the interet of tho 'Government to have the quantity appea krester than it realy wuA. Senor Rivero (the presont Minister of Pern to this eoun. try) surveoed the pr#inipal guano deposits In the yoe 1B46 and he estimated-the Csinchs group to contaln 18,250,006 tons, bat after dlowing for the suooeeding seven years to 1853-say, 1,250,000 tons of the 2,085,000 tons extracted In the 12 years previous to 1853--hiU estimate differs from that of Mr. l'Intosh by no less than 8,'400,000 tons, and from that of the Peravian tnommisi6n of 1853 by4,623,90& tons. Captain George Peacoolc, F.R.G., who appears to be con. sidered as an authority, did not survey anZ of the deposits, nor in his letter, published In h Morning Chronide of the 24th of December, 1853, does he venture to name the quantity at any one, except that on tho northern or principal island of the Chinehr group, and this ae estimated in 1844 to contain-10,000,000 tons-an esimato unsupported by any other. The following tabular statement shows the disorepanoies In tho various surveys and estmates of the deposits on the Chincha or centre group, which have always been known to be much larger thin all the other deposits in Peru united:- Wlatosh Periana Ooinis- Rivero in 1i3. Sion it 1853. in 1546 Tts O IUL TeeL lortbern Iland .. .. 6,GOO,000 4,189,477 7,600,000 Cente Islaud 1,oo,000 2,50595 6,4s0,000 Sothem Island J, 1,000 6,680,675 4,100,000 8.600,000 1;376,10D 18.21,002 Is there no information to be obtained relative to the pano on these islands that will be beyond cavil or dispute, and to be relied upon? But, although there is so munch doubt as to the quantity of guno existing on the Chinoha islands in 1853 there can be none whatever that the ratio of extraction has been very much greater since. It is known that about 300,000 tons were sold in Great Britain alone last year, and that since 1852 there has been a large export to the United States, reAching in one year to about 200,000 tons. Considerable shipments have also been kept up to France, Spain, and, in fact, to wbierever it could be sold to advantage. If, for the sake of arriving at the probable quantity yet remaining at the Chincha islands, we assume mr. urIntoeh's survey (confirmed as it is by Senor Ellis' estimato) to havo been substantially correct in1853, and evenincrease itbythe excess of exports since that year over the previous years, we shall find it difficult to avoid thebeliefthat there is not more than enough guano remaining in those islands to last longer than from four to five years, and that the gradual advanos in the price of the article by tho Peruvian Government 1l induced by their knowledge of the comparatively small quantity left. In the correspondenoe rspecting the Guano Iands it is stated at page 71, with regard to the northern group (the Lobos and other islands) that "the quantity of manure thoY contain is in general of little thickness, and is re. quently mixed with sand," and that, "i n the present state of these deposits they are barely sufficient to auswer the demands of foreign consumption for one year." This was at the period of the official urvey made by Cater in 1846, who reports the group to contain 853,086 tons. Captain Peacock estimates the quantity at "some 5,000,000 tons.' Let the quantity, however, be what it may of these deposits the quality of that on the Lobos islands at least is comparatively worthiless, for according to Senor Els some cargoes sent to tho United States were found to be greatly mixed with stones and sel dung, had barely 3 per cent, of amnonia, and only sold for $25 the on, scacely leaving $4 net to the Peruvian Govemnment. The southern group were surveyed by Senor Rivero in 1846, and estimated by him to contain 7,921,000 tons. The guano is said to be good, but is far from being as accessible as that in the centre group. It must, however, be cons3tntly borne in mind with respect to the deposits of guano in Pera that the agicul ture of the country cannot be carried on without this manure, and therefore it is idle to supposo that any GoVernment whatever would dare to go beyond a certain point In the export, much as it might be disposedto do so. An idea is prevalent that the bondholders have a lien on the guane depDAite, but it is a misteak-th4i. lien is on the not proceeds of the guano consumed in the unted kingdom; consequently, if any Government in Peru should choose to sell the guano at the Islands (which Yivanco, the revolutionary chief, is now doing as far as he can) they would be without redrew, unles the British Government thould tahe up their cause. In 1853 a eommittee of Congress recommended the sale of the guano at the islands, and the project found many surporters then. sas It .1- A, INVESTIGAOIG London, April 27.

LONDON, WRDN.ESDAY, APRIL 29, 1857, We trust that in the intelligence now received from India we may have heard the last of that groundless discontentwhich appearstohaveprevailed in one or two of the Bengal Regiments, and to have shown itself in a Battalion of the Madras Army. The first symptoms of disaffection were exhibited at Barrackpore, in the immediate neighbourhood of Calcutta,where the Sepoys objected to the impurity, according to their notions, of the substances used in the manufacture of tho now rifle cartridge. The ferment thus excited was allayed by the indulgent consideration of the authorities; but, notwithstanding these concessions to their comrades, some of the troops in the eantonments of Berhampore, or Moorshedabad, -were only brought to reason by a display of superior force. Of the regiment thus offending an example is to be promptly made, and our accounts represent it as ordered from Berhampore to Barrackpore for the purpose of being disbanded. This is not the only instance during the last few years of such a proceeding. Not long ago the same measure was resorted to in the case of the 66th Regiment, which was broken up for its misconduct, and embodied anew from volunteers of the Ghoorka tribes. The infli-tion of this penalty may exercise, we hope, a salutary infunce in Bengal, and, as we learn from Madras that one of its European regiments has been made disposable for service in Pereia, it may be inferred that the disturbance in that Presidency did not assume any formidable aspect. We have never been of opinion that these occurrences furnished any material grounds for alarm; but, wita an empire constituted like our own in the East, it naturally becomes an object of the deepest interest to ascertain on what feelings | of delusion or discontent such manifestations as these are based. After attentively investigating the various reports and communications which have reached us, we are disposed to conclude that the agitation itself is nothing more than av fortuitous access of the religious disquietude to which the Hindoo populationi is periodically liable, but that the disorder has perhaps been aggravated by certain effects of our military system, as at present prevailing in the East. Of political disaffection, in the proper acceptation of the term, we cannot discover a trace. That the dethroned King of OuDn should have been the object of suspicion in current rumours was only natural, but it is allowed on all hands that neither he, nor, in all human probability, any other prince or potentate, has had any share whatever in the creation or encouragement of the discontents referred to. It is one of the most remarkable features of the Hindoo character that this singular people feels no impatience under political subjection, nor evinces any desire for political independence. To find Rindostan under the rule of Hindoos we should have to ascend to a period beyond the range of credible history. The Mahomedan population of our Eastern Empire, though far less numerous, entertains very different impressions, and the uneasiness of its ambition is usually discernible whenever, as in our Cabul expeditions, the power of the British Government has been brought into collision with the arms of true believers. But, though the Elindoo looks with apathy or unconcern at the dominion under which he lives, he betrays extreme jealousy of religiousproselytism, and exhibits this feeling in symptoms which the very circumstances of his political position have, perhaps, tended to create. We do not often read in the accounts of Hindoo life of any of that personal enmity towards the teachers of an opposite creed which commonly attends a rivalry of religions. The natives do not seem to resent or apprehend the results of individual conversion, nor to object, as far as we understand, to the probable influences of general education. Their alarms appear to have reference to the Government alone-to its views, its decisions, and its designs. They seem almost to act as if they held their faith upon sufferance, and as if they thought that the Power whose behests in all other matters they would obey without murmuring could in the strength and plenitude of its authority deprive them, by some proceeding or other, of their caste and their religion. Under ordinary circumstances these apprehensions lie dormant and produce little or no effect, but at intervals they burst forth in paroxysms of terTor, and then the smallest incident is magnified into a wanrant for alarm and violence. Thenewheaddress atVeUore 50 years since, and the newcartridge at Berhampore the other day, were alike regarded as instruments for the destruction of Brahminism by some mysterious process, and, as mischief makes mischief, the discontent of one corps becomes the aliment of disaffection in another. We do not believe the recent disturbances to have been based on any reeling more solid than this impulsive and unreasoning terror; and it is extremely curious to abserve that when other circumstances have not been conducive to the development of this epilemic alarm, changes of a far more notable character have been introduced without any disturbance whatever. The Enfield rifle cartridge set the Hindoo mind in a ferment, but Suttees and compulsory widowhood have been abohlshed and village schools and railways instituted without any 3uch consequences as even the boldest felt halflisposed to predict. Although, however, we consider the recent panic o have been almost as unavoidable as an eruption f cholera, we think the present administration of )ur Indian Army might very probably have been nstrumental in giving the disturbance the proportions it displayed. The truth is that the l.rmies of India are not supplied with a sufficient strength of officers to furnish, as they now do, iervants both for the military and civil departments of the State. Under a Government like bhat of India it is highly natural that men inured to military discipline and possessed of military skill should be selected to fill what in any other country would be regarded as purely civil appointments, nor do we doubt that this system is the best that could be adopted for the administration of affairs. But unfortunately an officer, however able, cannot follow two professions at once, and when he is despatched upon Staff or political employ his regiment suffers, though the State may gain. The irregular corps, too, which have now been enrolled in considerable numbers, draw upon the same source for the officers who are to command them. Every new battalion of Sikhs, Bheels, or Beloochees makes its demand upon the regiments of the regular army for its commandant, its lieutenant, and its adjutant, and, when to these draughts are added the abstractions due to furloughs and invaliding, the result assumes a character almost incredible. At the date of our last despatches there were two native regiments in the Bombay Presidency which, out of a complement of 23 European officers each, had but six between them actually present with the corps. That the control which might be otherwise exercised over the prejudices as well as the disciplE;e of the native troops must be seriously diminished by such a system as this we need hardly remark, and it is not impossible that other events may have operated in the same direction, and impaired in some degree the influence which European officers formerly possessed. It is said in India that the very improvement of European society, by rendering the European less of anAsiatic, has tended to weaken the sympathies established in times past bstween officers and men. To this argument, however, we do not attach much weight, and for the obvious reason, that these outbreaks among the natives were in those days more frequent and far more serious than they now are under the conditions prumed to be more favourable to their occurrence. India was certainly not Europeanized in 1806, and yet the affair at Vellore was a good deal worse than that at 13erhampore. It is probable that these gusts of passion may sweep at intervals over the Hindoo mind for a long time to come, but it is clearly incumbent upon us to omit no efforts in providing the best securities for tranquillity and control. In the numerous and unsympathizing populations now under our command we possess exellent means for establishing a balance of force; but to render these resources efficient for the protection of our Indian Empire we must always require a full proportion of those European energies by whioh that magnifioent dominion was acquired.
The graphic letter of Sir JAMBS BRooxE, which we publish to-day, together with the details given in the Singapore papers, enable us to form a clear notion of the late extraordinary events at Sarawak. We were not wrong in supposing that the plan of revolt and murder had been elaborated by communication with other settlements where Chine?e abound. From Singapore the seed wjs brought, and it took root speedily among the barbarous and needy race which is sprinkled over the Western coast of Borneo. The details of this outbreak and of the terrible punishment which fell on the aggressors may be shortly narrated. When Sir I J. BRooun settled at Sarawak he found in the country a race of Chinese, who appear to have numbered between 4,000 and 5,000 souls. These people have, it appears, been always restiff I under the authority of the Rajah, impelled by their vanity to think they could supplant him, and by their cupidity to hope for the gains of the trade which has lately sprung up. During the last few months the yield of gold from the district they inhabit has been scanty, and the pressure of poverty still further increased their discontent. Such was the state of things when the dispute at Canton took place. The events of November last were, no doubt, related at Sarawak with all the colouring which national vanity and hatred could impart. The Chinese were probably told that English ships had been seized by the Canton Governor, that English crews had been destroyed, that the English fleet had been beaten off, the English authorities blockaded in Hongkong, and that a few weeks would see the whole tribe of barbarians exterminated. Sir JAEs BRooxz, in his letter, remarks on the confidence and lust of dominion which everywhere possess the Chinese when assembled in large bodies, and these feelings were roused by the news received from the North. Whether the great rebellion which now convulses the empire be the cause or the effect, it is said that an energy and a spirit of daring are to be found among the Chinese of the present day which they hardly possessed even fifteen years ago. It seems that their plan was not to destroy, but to revolutionize the settlement. They would murder Sir J. BROoxE and every one connected with the Administration, but they would sp3re the Bishop andthe other Europeans, take, them ucnder their protection, make Sarawak a Chinese settlement, and carry on a trade with England on their own account. We cannot but be struck with the audacious cleverness of the whole scheme, but the assumptions on which the Chinese based their proceedings are still more surprising. We learn that the Chinese politicians have pretty much the same opinion of us an was entertained by the Czar NicHoLAs before the late war. EDglishmen only wanted to make money, and as long as the trade of Borneo was kept open no one of us would care whether Sarawak was a British or a Chinese settlement. " To upset "the Government," writes Sir JAsx, " by the "murder of its principal officers and its head, "and to establish other Englishmen to carry on " the trade, was the suggestion of Chinese at Singa" pore well acquainted with my relations with my "own country, -with the isolated position of Sarawak, and possessed with the idea that th¢ " murder of Sarawal- officers and the Sarawak "Rajah would be a matter of supreme indifference"to the British nation, provided that trade was "contiuued and cottons sold." This it is to have, a reputation. We presume the British public were hardly prepared to find the Indian Archipelago. talking of us in the style of the AssemQU Nationaie or the Kreur Zeitung. We recommend the incident to the consideration of those who ara always telling us of the opinion entertained by Drientals of our ambitious and aggressive spirit. rhe idea of these over-clever barbarians, that the English people would submit to any outrage so long as they could maintain peace and buy tea, ~ertainly rseems to have been inspired by anything mther than the exhibition of a warlike temper on Dur part. On the contrary, it confirras strongly the opinio;i of those who declare that our Dfficers and merchants have for years endured insults, vexations, and injuries with a tameness which was always undignified, and had at length become dangerous. The conspirators, however, did not know all. Had they had the opportunity of reading recent debates in the British Parliament their more subtle spirits might have received further encouragement from the belief that we were not only an ultra-peaceful but an ultrapunctilious people, and that the cutting of Rajah Bu.oox's throat and the burnig of his town might be considered matters beyond our cognizance antil the precise colonial status of Sarawak was- letermined, and whether a Kungsi Chinese was; ander the jurisdiction of any British Court. On the night of the 17thof February the Chinee. lescended the river to Kuchin, the seat of Siri TAMEs BRooxa's Government. They first seized. the two forts, and then set about their bloodp work. They surrounded the residence of the Rajah, whose destruction was their great object, And proceeded to attack the house in front. Sir TAmEs, however, escaped by a bath-room, and, Eavoured by the darlness, gained a creek, across which he swam, and took refuge in a MAlay village. The house of Mr. CnooKSn:HNx, the magistrate, was attacked, his wife bratally wounded4 and dragged away, to be found next day almost &-ad in the jungle. The house of Mr. MMIDDLEON, another settler, was fired, and two of his children perished in the flames. Mr. WELn-nGTOr, in the service of the company, was murdered, and his head cut off. The Treasury was plundered, and all the Government property that could be seized was carried away. But the most extraordinary fact connected with the story is, that even in the midst of this slaughter the Chinese proceeded consistently with their intention to conquer, and not destroy the settlement. They spared the Bishop and some other persons, while expressing their determination to put to death the Rajah and every agent of the company. The next Sunday Sir JAE8 BnooKE returned, but the Chinese, who seem to have heard with astonishment that he was still living, made a second descent, and he was forced to retire, taking with him all the Europeans. He then proceeded to Linga to procure the co-operation of the chief of that district, but on his way a steamer from Singapore, named after him, the Sir James Brooke, appeared in sight. The Rajah embarked, proceeded to Kuchin, and cleared the town of the invaders. Then came the retribution. The Malays and Dyaks had been for some years contented subjects of Sir JAMEs. They were eager for vengeance, and it was determined to make a general attack on the Chinese. We need not recapitulate, the details, which will be found in another place. Suffice it to say that for days a kind of guerilla warfate was carried on. The Chinese were driven into the jungle and shot down wherever they appeared. On all sides they fled from their villages,. pursued by bands of Malays. Sir J~sis Bxooxn carried on the war like some JosuuA smitincg the Canaanites. The Chinese were extirpated. " There is not," writes Sir JAMIEs BRoonE, " a " rooftree to cover their dastard heads in the "country." " Out of a population of from 4,000 "to 5,000 not more than 2,000 have escaped, and "half this number is composed of women and chil"dren." The few who will wander back fromtie jungle are to be disarmed, prevented from forming separate settlements, and reduced "to a daily "obedience to the laws, and a strict surveillance." Such is the episode of the insurrection in Sara. waak. Amid the maundering of humanitarianism and the foppery of professional generalship it is reassuring to meet with a man who recalls the old days of British enterprise and personal heroism in the East. Sir JA?tRS BRooxs knows his work anad the people he has to deal with, both friends and foes. In a few short days he has crushed a movement which might have extended to all the British settlements in those sam. Less than his vigour and determinitiozi would have been unable to combat a conspiracy which his probably its ramificatioiu from Hongkong to Australia. Such is the kind of man who, if he could be found on our roll of Generals, should be intrusted with the task of bringing the Government of Pekin to reason. Diplomacy and orthodox sbldiering are very well in their way, but the heads of our Chinese expedition would do well to learh a lesson from the Rajah of SA&wAxc, who did his work so quickly and so effectually, with a single steamer, half-a-dozen civilians, and, a handful of Malays. I
The investigation into the affairs of the Royal British Bank, as we are informed upon the excellent authority of Mr. L IriATB, is drawing towards a conclusion. On Monday Mr. CRAuFu:ui, the young and polite General Manager, was examined, and Mr. EIMrrY BROWN is this day to give the Court of Bankruptcy the benefit of his Random Recollections. We do not, however, propose to-day to enter upon the general question, but simply to call attention to the method in which the accounts of the Banlk were " audited." It is the fashion to hold that the practice of an audit affords considerable security to shareholders in a joint-stock undertaking; the case is rather the reverse. - When truth and honesty exist at head-quarters, then, precisely when it is little needed, or not needed at all, there will be a fair audit of accounts. On the other hand, when a spirit of triclkery and rascality presides over the operat.sius of the Board, the audit wil be nothing better than a farce and an imposture. It will, indeed, be something worse, for the opinion I that there i an exaniination into the accounts periodically nmde by competent and independent persons inpirs additional confidence, when in ;ruth the semblanee, and not the reality, of the examnination is there. " Oh ! it must be all right-the auditors have "passed the accounts." That is the bladder upon' which the careless shareholder lme to keep hia head above water on the bubbling sex of speculation ;--it bursts beneath him, and her is gone. We had occasion to discuss this subjet with great earnestness some few years ago, wheL the question was raised as to the auditing of railw accounts. Had a real audit existed the systems of paying dividends out of capital could never have been carried out, nor many other gross fraul&s of the like nature, which carried ruin to so many hearths in these islands. The Railway interest in tbe House was, however, too strong for tae reformers. The establishment of an independent audit vas denouneed as an. unconstitutional interferenoo with the legitimate freedom of private enterprise, and the constitutional principle triumphed at the exznse of the shareholder's pocket. Now that crash is followingcrash in the joint-stock world it may net be amiss to pick out a few salient points from the evidence given at the Bankruptcy Courtt on Monday last by the Auditors themselves, as well as by the General Manager of the Royal British BBmk, to show the amount of protection whica results from what is held ouit to be a regular audit ef accounts. If little benefit can arize from the discuwion to the shaeholders and depositors in thew late swindling concern, at least it may serve to put shareholders in other similar enterprises on their guard, and induce them. to bestir themselves until they have established a system of audit which shall be something better than , fiction and a snare. In the case of the Royal British Bank there were two Auditora-Mr. Tuo3As PAGE and Mr. -T CHND,L. Its eem-that about five hours sufficed fdr -every half--yearly audit. On one occasion Mr. PAGE acted without his colleague, and the only person at the Bank with whom he entered inte communication was Mfr. CnA.iumD. This polite person represented to the Auditor that bills to the amoun:s of 9S0,0Q1. were an available asset; in truth, they were aAnmost entirely past-due bills. This slight fact was sippressed by CxAUBuID, and the easy Auditor doea not seem to have made himself troublesome by his pertinacity. R&uFuaBD's own account of this litle matter is,-" This item "was entitled 'London bills, Nos. 4 and 5.' "The title ais written by Mr. CAmssox. I stated that these were London biUs, and if the Au"ditors said I tod them the Bank held security "I should.think I did so. The Aluditors could "not suppose they were past-due biUls. I " did not volunteer the statement that they " were past-due bils, and I certainly did not "suppose they would imagine they were past"due biUs. I did not believe at the time they "were under any impression that they were " past-due bils." Now, we would entreat attention to the rich, racy rascality of this whole proceeding. Were not interests of such magnitude involved, and had not so much misery been inflicted on innocent persons by the acts of these men, an audit of the accounts of the Royal British Bank would seem to have been almost a ludicrouw proceeding. Only conceive CrAuonRD gravely asserting to the Auditors that a set of figures which represented paper which was worth just ais much as the rag mnerchant would give for it was worth 90,000l., and the Auditors gravely ticking the figures off accordingly I Mr. PAGE, as he proceeded with his useful labours, had no idea that HlumPnY BBRowN's overdrawn account of 37,5921., CAxox's of 30,0001., or EwrrsoN's of 8,0001. was included under I good " assets." As little had he any suspicion that an item of 54,0491. included as a trifling rebate 31,6631. sunk in the Welsh Work-s. As to Mr. M'GsnEoo's debt, it was quietly passed over as a loan on mortgage. It was represented that certain figures stood for loans on mortgages of houses and lands, " which now turned out to be nothing of " the sort," as Mr. PAGE piteously told the Commissioner the other day. Then there was a whole heap of bad debts due by HAwxss, MluLLIs, a shadowy irs. GOODRIDGE, andothers, which were all put forward by the young Accountant, and received by the Auditors as excellent and available assets. It should be added, in justice to Mr. PAGE, that he never was indebted to the Bank, and had never received from it more than 401. in compensation for his services as Auditor. This payment, however, seems to have been more than sufficient for all the services rendered by Msir. PAGE to the shareholders of the Bank. The case of Mr. T. Cmum=ix, his colleague, wears a very different complexion. This person, who was appointed to his office as a check upon the proceedings of the Directors and General Manager, seems by his own admissions to have been their creature and tooL He commenced operations by making himself a debtor to the Bank. He borrowed money from the concern, and deposited its own shares as securities. Altogether, and inclusive of bills which his eom- plaisant friends had discounted for him, he was in debt to the concern about 3,0001. He was hand and glove with the Directors, not only in the affair of the Royal British Bank, but in other similar schemes. Thus, he was a Director of the Wandle Waterworks Company, of which ESDAILE, BRowN, M'GREGOR, and BARING were also Directors. This conern is about to "wind up." Then, in company with ESDnA', he was a Director of the "Chartered Australian Land, Mining, Im"C porting, and Refining Company." This association is not wound up yet ; it is ia abeyance. Then there was a Brick and Tile Company, over the foitunes of which CHA.NDLER and BARxiG presided; and an Irish Peat Company, with CHANDLER, M oGREGon, and GWmfNz on the B3ad. The ohly aaoeiation of whihl OrANDLf .otiai not r.emt,ber that he Waa & Director W." "the Hot Muffin and Crumpet Quick lak&ing and "Punctual Delivery Company;" but he Wad enough on lhis hands without this further responsibility, as, independently of his directorial duties, Jae was a brickunaker and a surgeon. Such was the person chosen to hold his egis over the heads of the share. holders and depositors in the Royal British Bank. The office of Auditor, as he had been informed by Mfr. MJuLLINS, was so simple a oue that any schoolboy could discharge itsr duties. The syxtem he pursued appears to have been very nimple. His plan was to pick out a few items, and, if -the were correct, to be less minute in his after-inquiries. Now, considering that it was Mlr. IRAVFUnD who fed him with the items he required, there .can be little doubt that this worthy pluralist of a Director would Snd but slender occasion for pushing his investigations to any inconvenient length. " From the beginning to the end 'CR-AuSFuRD always represented the assets as good, "with the exception of one of abouft 181., and 'that he eaid he would get some day." This respectable functionary did not notioe that Mr. DB TAni's debt had been simply transferred to a¶other account; he treated it s redueed by 8,0001. , and io on throughout. It would be prepo*torous, however, to speak of any investigation made by such a perxon as a seri.s matter. There was dirty work cut out for him to do, aDd he did it. This ludicrous exposure of the nanner in which the aecounts t jointSto&k Companies are madited ought not to be without its effect upow tke public; but ts have little hope that it will et as an effective and per. nianent warising. lun n fes months, or weeks-. the affair of the &Royal Britids B"& will be forgot#en. Other knaves will lay other traps for gieedy and credulous persens, and into these traps, the victhm will duly fall. We cau scanely indulggethe;expec. tation that they will so far ben mindful of their own interests as t secure a reasoiable audit of their accounts.

AiIERBWAX CO..Sr DxE CI~cxS.-Duringone of the wildest storms of the past stormy itev an maneican ship, the Northemn BeUe, was driven shore-d usterly wrecked upon the cost of Kent. The hardy seafang in habitants of that part of England assemwbli upon.thesore not to gaze idly on the terrible spectacle before tbeur, but to devise means hr rescuing n imperilledicrew. Tb4 life. boat was manned by volunteers, boatmen o'Deal. who contended with one another in their egernes to r to the relief of the helplems strangers, through such asurfas landsmen never dream of when they sig the praiss of the "wet sheet and the flowing sea" aound acosy suppertable. Threatimes the gallant fellows fought ar way to the ship, till, with A persistent heroism. never surpassed before the " imminent deadly breach4" or,at th' 4cannon's mouth," ther had wrunug the victory from. the' Wves and landed every livig soul on board thatheleagueeed vessel in safety upon tImebeach. The details ofthis.snostnohle achieve. nent stir tkheert as with a trumpet, but owe have neither t-he time, nor, indeed, the inclination to dwoU upon them here, for the occasionhich shoutdhavebeon siza UpOn by our ovwn people for doing fit honour to the brave Britons who had risked so much and w:rought s stoutly in the service of American interests, and Ameican lives was suffered to pass us by unimprosad, aud England was left to pay the meed which we should. have claimed it as our right to bestow. We recall the stoW now only to bring into vivid contrast with it that very diTbrent stor If the los of the ship New Hampshire, on the shore of Lsog Island, which was reported in our yesterdAy's issue. The New Hampshire, like t;he Northern Belle, wTa an American ship; but it was her more cruel fate to ba cast upon her native shores and, within sight of one o the "lie statlons" by lav established for the yurpose, as it would appear, ef deluding mariners to. their destruction. Had she been wrecked in the neighbourhood of a mere fish, g village, where never a lifeobat was to be found, we do not doubt i'dat the generous course of the Deople would have sent help to hba in cockleshells ibfhin the first hour ot her distress. As it was, however, she stranded within the range of offMal salvation, and mecresw, of course, were heft to their own resources. Moatfortanately for them the sea, althaeub very heavy, did n.run so high as to dash the ship directly to pieces, or to annihilate the boat in wheh they sought safety. They reched the shore in timeh see tho keepef of the ~lifeboat esserge from. his cheerful residence, and to receive ocular degnonstration that it was his intention to visit the ship whea the surf should bave gone down sufficiehtly to it of his making the trip without any great ersonal incon. venienee. If the conduct of the eal boatmen who reseced the crew of the Northern tUlle deserved the recompense of oblivion and nelect, it is clear that the coumse of the Long Islt life-ke}p4 who allowed the crew of the New Hampnaire a fair chanae of goingto the bottom quietly, ought to be rewarded with immediate promotion and a public dinner. The qualities which were displayed on this occasion should commend their possessor to the suffrages of a municipal constituency for one of the highest posts in our city government, and, as the new charter has made no provision for any alteration in our sanitary system, wo entertain a confident hope that he may be called to preside over the health of the metropolis, in the capacity of city inspector, How much of the dangerous and much-frequented coat of Long Island has been confided to the protecting .egis of this considerate guardian we do not know, but we oannot help thinking that the attention of the Chanber of Commerce might be profi'ably turned to the examination of the actual condition and working of our lifo-station system. Millions of property and hundreds of human lives float yearly in and out of our harbour, at the mercy of the winds and wave,, and we cannot me in what respect the interest of trade can be advanced by the addition to all other nautical risks of such an inefficient lifeboat system as is more likely to paralyze the self-helpfulness of endangered crews than to give thezn succour and encouragement. If the present opportunity shall be turned to the account of a thorough overhauling of our "cost defenes" (for such indeed they are, and of more permaizent importanee than - our forts), we shall not regrt the words which ehave spent upon the proceedings of a functionary wrho seemns to have carefully modelled himself after thebhero of w ma3aiee3t ;aFid yidieuilous son.-,-Zi'w YorJ; Tim4s,I

ROY1;AL ITALr-Al oprRA. la Favrota; the best of Dnizettfi serious French operas, althoug& by no meamr the bs orera of Donizetti, was given lastnight, with the same at as in 1856. Theperformance might be described in atmest the exAct words. which chronieled the event las year. What was good thena was good now, and what was indiflerent then was not a bit. leas indifferent- on the present occaeien-which is as much. as to say taht the first three sets, in spite of certain exceptional passages, went oF, as is inva-Aably the case whereever and however La Fcesitz may be executed, ratherr flatly, while the fourth a*sc lst act was listened to with eager intemst, and excitsd real enthuiasm. At the IRoyal Italian Opera, it is sarcely necessy to. say, the- success of La Fascita depends upon Grisi and Mario, and the success of Grisi and Mario, in a great nieasure, upon the final scene, which, both from a dramatic and musica* point of view, is beautifbl onough to have rescued a much more dreAry and prolix work from oblivion. Itt can hardly be questiored that Donizetti composed the first throe parts of the opera with his head, while the ,est came spontaneously frora his heart, and endowed the wevil witk something even more genuine and expreesive than Lucia di. -zncmerntoor itself, for there is as much true vsic and as much intense foeling in the cloister scene of La Favorite za in the whole of that earlier essay, generaly reogniozed A; ibe chef d'airv of its author. The sigers, to, must be fully conscious of this. A certai lassitude, occasionally bordering upon apathy, seems a infinenca othem (as we as the audience) up to the momea wlker Ferdimndo, conscious of the dishonourahbl union into which the Kag, to be quits with Leonors5 has inveigled him, repudiates his badge and breaks his swrd in two (finatc to Act M.), and operates s a kind of "wet bUnket"or& their efforts. From this incident, neverheless, Donizetti, previowly unequal to his subject, riss with it, and may be said to have done even more for the poet than the poet has doue for the musician. Nothing in its way can be finer tha the Lst sct of La Ya-aoria, and never were its beauties histrionic and musi. al, revealed with more peerfect xucess than by the Leonor and Perdinando of last night.

THE INSURRECTION AT SARAWAR. i-- ---- b We have been favoured with the f vll)wing letter from Sir Jamues Brooke, addressed to a warm per4sonal friend, and describing the events of the late insurrection, and the steps taken to suppress it " Baiidah, Match 15. cI may now relate more circuumstmutially the *events of the last few weeks. Sarawak was as peace'ful as it had ever been, and there was no cause to -excite dissatisfaction among the Chinese or raise suspicion in our minds of any hostile liesigns ; yet a conspiracy had been formeed which had its ranifications in SingSpore and in Cbina. A follower of Tien-Te, the rebel chief, had arrived in Sarawak .and some criminals, who had been banished the -coumtry, secretly returned from Singapore. I had been unwell for some days, and on the night of the 18th retired early to bed. My servant was sleeping in a room near mine, and Mr. Steel anid Nicholets occupied a small bungalow close by. Between 12 and 1 o'clock I was awakened by yells and shots, -and, seizing my sword and revolver, I opened a 'window and saw that the houge was surrounded. The noise told me it was by Chinese. I opened -door by door ill the hope of finding means for escape, but in vain. I told Penty (his native servant] that our deaths were at hand, and, as the last hope, went down to the bathingroom, which was under repair. The door was not. fastened. I opened it gently, and, seeing the way clear, ran across the lawn to the creek on the right hand of the house, and took the water -close under the bows of the boat which had brought the murderers to their bloody work. I *carried my aword and pistol across with me. Glad waa I to touch ground on the far side, though not -above 30 yards. I struggled through the deep mud, and lay down exhausted and panting in the road. Ftecovering breath, I got to the nearest bouse, and, launching a canoe, pulled up to the Datoo Bandars kampong. AU was in confusion. I was too ex-haunted to do much, and Hercules himself could not have restored courage or order to such a panicstiicken crowd. Here Crookahank joined me bleeding from a severe swordout in the arm. He believed his wife to be dead, and we both apprehended that the massacre would be general. Finding all hope of restoring affairs at the Bandars gone, I pulled to the kampongs above, and persuaded the people to se-cure their women and valuables in prahus, and to .cross to the opposite or left bank of the river, so asto prevent the assailants from attacking them by land. My house, Arthur's, and Middleton's were long before this in flames. We got the women and children across the river, and Arthur, Crookshank, -and myself retired to the same side, to the house of Nakodah Bryak. Here Crymble joined us with the intelligence that after an hour's defence our fort or palisade had been taken, and with it all our guns, small anns, ammunition, &c. It had been defended by Crymble, with four men and two prisoners ; three of the defenders were killed, one or two wounded, and Crymble himself had been grazed -by. a spear in his side. Middleton, Steele, Ruppell, and Penty dropped in one after another. The bright fires went out, and the dull morning broke at length, but only disclosing to us the hopcless state of our affairs. We remained quietly at Inkodah Bryaks, doing what we could to animate the natives, and to prepare for such a 'defence as our means allowed, should we be attacked. I may here relate the fate and misfortames of our fellow-sufferers. Poor Harry Nicholetta was murdered on the grass, trying to reach my house. Crookshank and his wife escaped by their bath-room door. She ran first, and he protected her retreat with a spear in his band, but, in passing the stable, one of these vsillains rushed from the -opposite side and out her down. Her husband jobbed his spear into the miscreant's back, but with a twist of his body he wrenched it out, and, seizing the shaft. he struggled to get the spear. Suddenly, however, letting go with his right hand, in which he held a short sword, he cut Crooksbank across the feshy part of the arm. Both staggered, both let go the spear, and Crookshank, weak with loss of blood and believing his wife dead, staggered away and reached me. She, young and beautiful, lay for 12 hours weltering In her blood, conscious and caln in this extremuty. One fiend hacked at her head till he cut off the long tresses which protected it; another tore her rings from her fingers; a thirdfor the sake of our common nature let it be toldgave her water to drink. By this time the remainder of the Europeans had been assured of protection; but when the Bishop asked the leader's permission to carry her to his house, he was told that she should be left to perish. At length the boon was granted, and she was relieved and tended, and is now, God be praised, recovering. Middleton's house was attacked at the same time and in the same manner as the others. He escaped with difficulty. His poor little wife hid in a bakery till the burning rafters fell about her, and, froim her concealment, saw the assailants kicking about the head of her eldest child. The mother was paralyzed; she wished, she said, to rush out, but could not move. The youngest child was murdered and thrown into the flames, where poor Wellington's remains were likewise consumed, his head borne off in triumph alone attesting his previous murder. The day broke, as I said, and shortly after I heard that the Chinese had assured the survivors of safety; that they had communicated with the Bishop, and sent for Helms and Ruppell. I then, hopeless of doing good, started for the Siole, a small stream which has its outlet far below the town; it was a wild walk ; we swam the stream, washed out every track of our footsteps in the mud, and took refuge in a mangrove rswamp as dark came on. By 8 o'clock two small boats came to carry us away, and in an hour afterwards I was in Abong Buyong's prahu, manned by 40 men, with six smaller boats in company. Our party consisted of Arthur Crookshank, Crymble, Middleton and Panty, and, after the trials and fatigues of the 24 hours, we slept as though misfortune had not overtaken us. " On the morning following I landed at Sabong, and I wish I could explain toyou the tender care, the generous sympathy showered upon us. Here we received information that the Chinese, after forcing the Europeans and Datoos into oaths of fealty, had agreed to retire up the river. It was clearly their intention, having, as they thought, disposed of myself and Arthur, to take the country into their own hands, to be friendly with the Malays and Dyaks, to patronize the Europeans and to encourage them to trade in order to the supply of their own wants. There were two parties requisite to the success of this notable project. My intention was to proceed to Sakarran, to collect as large a force as I could, and with it to retake the town, or to command a base of operations in its vicinity. I awaited, however, the iintelligence, and on Sunday, having heard of the retirement of the (hinese, 1 was again entering the W town, when down they came a second time, before we were in any mmnner prepared to receive them properly. The consequence was, they gained the town before I could even land, and I again retired with all the Europeans, with the firm intention of proceeding to Sakarran. This was the only evening I felt the depression of spirits attendant on ill fortune, but I did not show it. There we were, outcasts-women and children and helpless fugitives to be provided for^-the town in names, and my peoplo without firearms and .ammunition, panio stricken, and fleeing with their families. A force from Sakarran was our only hope, and with a base for operations we might rally the people, re-arm and act against the enemy. The next moniing I was on my way to Linga, when the steamer hove in sight. I boarded her. Skinner was mort zealous and active. Here was the very base for our operations we wanted. We drove the miscreants out of the town, found the Dateo in a cluster of prahus, and heard that he had re,captured nmne srampans and one of our prahus -containing stores of powder, some guns, &c., of which we were in great want. This was the first blow struck at the Chinese. I felt aured that each day would improve our resources and diminish -those of our enemies. Their body of men was nearly annihilated, for taking the jungle behind the town or making off by the rqad, as they had no boats to tcarry them away, they were cut off by the Dyaks or starved. Miy next measure was to let the land Dyals loose upon them, and within a circuit of 30 miles from Siniawan, Bau, and Bula they were driven into their defences with great loss of life, and aU communication between Bau and Siniawan prevented, excepting by means of large parties of armed men. :Nght and day they were harassed by alarms; every stragglerwFas cut down. Inshort, it wras a guerilla warfare of the most harassing character, snd quite shut the enemy up in their twoaplaces of strength, Bau and Siniawan. The want of fool was sure to do tbe rest, and it was a mere question of time how long they could hold out. Simovar and Bank were each covered, the former by the fort of 13alidah, the latter by its landing place, but early in the month the Chinese again came forth in five prahus and began ravaging the banks of the river. I was collecting my people and re--assuring them after their panic. The Datoo Bandar, on the 9th, was in a single Malay prabu on the look-out at Linda Tarak when this Chinese party came there. They declined an engagement on the water, but landed and threw up a stockade, which they defenlded with four guns and manned with about 250 men, armed with muskets and rifles. The I>atoo came down himself in a small boat, and by 1 o'clock on the IOth we got off two more large prahus, some 30 D)yak bangkongs as a reserve; other prahus were preparing, and some followed the same evening, but too late. These three prahus ranged themselres in line and dashed at the Chinese stockade, landed sword in hand, and carried it without a check. The Dyaks cut the Chinese to pieces in the jungle, and the half-hour before sunset cost our enemies from 100 to 120 men. Again the remnant was distressed in the jungle. Our party returned ; had it ascended the river, no man, woman, or child of our enemies would have escaped death or capture. This defeated party consisted of their picked men, and their two great leaders were kIlled m the stockade. A panic now seized them. On the night of the 1ch I heard that Balidsh and Siniovar had been abandoned, and, hurrying up the foUowing morning, the intelligence greeted me that Bnaik was likewise deserted, and had been burned, and that the Chinese were in full retreat towards Sambas. This took us by surprise, but our force got upon their trail on the 13th, and, after three days' desultory fighting7, drove them across the frontier with great slaughter, the enemy, however, making a desperate resistance in defence of the women and children, and the efforta of our people not being able to break them. Had 24 hours' delay intervened to aZlow a concerted attack we should have had them all; but as it is we may be thankful, for a mere remnant of the body of Chinese men has escaped, and the capture of the women and children was not to be desired. Even now, however, this wretched mass, driven to the further side of the Sambas river, must suffer great loss, and may altogether perish An the wild jungle for want of food and from exposure. Thus the punishment has been almost as sudden and far more sharp than tbe treachery and first success of this miscreant body. A thousand and more have been killed in different places, their flourishing xettlements destroyed, and not a rooftree to cover thbir dastard heads in the country. Thenumbers starved in their flight by being lost i the jungle it is diffi-I cut to reckon, but it must be considerable, and out of a population of 4,000 or 5,000 certainly not more than 2,000 have escaped, andhalf thisnumberia composed of women and children. The punishment has been severe. The Chinese wiU play no further treachery here, and in future we shall prevent their being associated in companies, disavow them, and reduce them to a daily obedience to the laws and a strict surveillance. Sarawak has now passed through the ordeal that Hongkong is paming through and Singapore has yet to meet. The country is secure; the authority of Government has been vindicated; the principles on whioh it is based proved to be right by the fidelity and ardour of its native population. Our guns have been recovered with a proportion of our musketry, and the principal loss falls on myself, on Crookshank, and Middleton. For myself, 1 may say that I never knew the small value of worldly goods till I lost them. I do not pretend to any sentimental cant over my noble library, my costly plate, or all the decorations and tokens of honour which were once showered upon me and have been lost even more suddenly than they were acquired. Man's happiness consists not in such tbings, and he destroys the chances of finding it if he persuades himself that it does. Now, a word moro as to the causes of these events. Wherever there is a Chinaman there is the conceit of supremacy and the desire of dominion. When associated in bodies, as in Sambas formerly, and thence in Sarawak before my arrival, this lust of rule grows stronger. The stringent proceedihgs of the Dutch have recently thrown many desperate characters into Sarawak, and the miserably feeble C-overnment of Singapore, with its toleration of secret societies, has strengthened the Chinese Kungsi here and given it advisers aware of the state of British affairs and policy. Without such advisers the idea of encouraging trade while murdering the officers of Government would never have entered the head of any Qf the rude Chinese here, and without the means of livelihood from without and the support of the European community so mad s project could hardly have been undertaken. To upset the Government by the murder of its principal officers and heads and to establish other Englihmlen to carry on the trade,was the suggestion of CIhinese of Singapore, well acquainted with the isolated position of Sarawak, and posse3d with the idea that the murder of Sarawak officers and the Sarawak Rajah would be a matter of supreme indifference to the British nation, provided that trade was continued and cottons sold. It was a high compliment to my government that, murdering me with the intention of obtaining power, these stupidly clever Chinese desired as lhttle change as possible. They forgot the native element, and hence their destruction has come. It was a grand superstructure, cleverly devised by men acquaintedwithEnglish policy and mode of proceeding, but mizerably based as regards the feelings and the ferocity of the native population. I think I have told you that one of Tien Te's followers-i. e. a follower of the rebel and Hu6 leader in Cbina-has since been ascertained to have arrived in the country. It is probable that he was the great Singapore mover and agent, and to all these causes to encouirage the attempt to acquire power and plunder by means of treachery and murder may be added the poverty of the Chinese, owing to the scanty yield of gold during the last eight months. I will only add that to penetrate their designs was impossible, and without a clue to the design and its advisers their attempt was not conceivable. True, some rumours had been afloat three months before that under guise of a religious procession the Kungai people were to force the gaol in order to liberate some prisoners belonging to their body; but the scheme did not then embrace my life, as I was in Singapore. Crookshank took precautions, and on my return I made inquiry into the matter, without eliciting any tangible evidence to warrant me in disturbing the peace of the country. To guard against such a conspiracy is impossible; it slumbers tillopportunity oocurs. We are really not much hurt; our finances wll uffer,but will recover, as even now, owing to the speedy and complete destruction cf the Kungsi, confidence is not wanting. The loss of the company is trifling. It is fortunate that you will hear of our disaster and its retrieval at the same time; and, for myself, I may say that I am in good health and spirits, and ready to rough it with the bestof them. Our ladies behaved with great fortitude and resignation. Charlie Johnson, as usual, has been my right hand, and every Government servant has declared he will follow its fortunes in evil as wen as in good fortune. I have written to retrer.-,h every superfluous expense and I have appropriated my pension from the huast India Company to pay the pensions I grant to others. Everything else is superfluous. No books, no papers, no wine, no nothing. The following is an extract from a letter from Singapore, dated the 23d of March:- " The Chinese here and in the Straits generally are in a disaffected state, and, should there be any rtumour of mis- fortune to us in China, it may lead to unplesnt conse. quences i the meantime, though there can be no doubt of the ultimate result. The punishment of the Chinese in Borneo must have an excellent effect on other Populations. The only pity is that the English did not do It instead of the Malays. Sir W. HosteWs going to Borneo must produce the best results." (The following appeared in our sewond edition of yesterday :-J I We extract the following from the &raits Times of March 21:- " On Tuesday last we issued an extra, giving an outline of the recent outrages committed by the Chinese at Sara. wsk, particulars of which were brought from that place by the schooner Good Luck, which sailed on the 21st ultimo, and arrived on the 10th inst. Although rumours had been current that theKungsicontereplated resisting theauthority of the local Government, the latter appear to have treated the matter with indifference. Saddenly, however, a large body, numbering about 20 Chinese, eame down the river on and.before 17th Febrnary.andatmidnight commenced a most determined ittaa oni tbe Government people and property. They firmt sjimd; j ssoun of th fAiats,cne bdoow X nd the other above the town of Kuchin (theseat of Rajah Brooke's authority), which were only garrisoned by 12 men, and, having furnished themselves with all the arms and ammunition in the forts, they proceeded to the work of destruction upon which they had ventured. This was at mnidnight, when all were asleep. One party made an attack on the residence of Sir Jamea Brooke, while the remnainder assailed the houses of Mr. Crookshank, the magistrate, and Mr. Middleton, also a Governient official. For some days previonsly sirJ. Brooke was unwell, and was about to proceed to Simunjang, on the SWdong river (the seat of the Borneo Company's operations), for change of air. On the night in question his servant was sleeping in an adjoining room, and under the same roof was residing a young and very promising gentleman, named Nicholets, who had joined the Rajah's circle as a guest within the last 12 months. The surprise and consternation were so great, and the measures of the attacking party sO Well organized, that any comm4nication between the different European mombers of the com- unutity was impossible. While the Chinese attacked the front of the house Sir James Brooke succeeded in effecting an extraordinary escape; he passed down the bath-room and swam across a creek near his house, by which means he succeeded in gpining the Malay village, which also others of the European residents happily reached shortly afterwards. The assailants fired into Sir JAsnes Braoke's residence, killed Mr. Nicholets (whose body was buried in the ruins), plundered the place of everything of value in their estimation, and then set fire to the building, ruthlessly destroying Sir James Biooke's excellent library and the valuable collection of his wrhole life-a loss which friend or foe must equally regret. Ai the hou'se of Mr. Crooksliank the pssaiants pet with a firm resistince, but that gentleman was overpowered; he defended his amiable ani recently married lady with the utmost gallantry. Mrs. Croolkshank was brutally wounded before bis eyes, and dragged away when he was no longer able to defend her. Mrs. Crookhasik 'was beleved to have been killedi but happily next morning she was found in the jungle. Her wounded body Was covered with cocoanut leaves. She was removed to the Mission-house, where, under the skilful treatment of the Bishop, the Right Rev. Dr. M'Dougall,shewas, at thedateof thelatest advices,doingwelL Mr. Crookshank, after pssinsg thlenight in the jungle, by some means reached the Mission-houws next moruing in an almost ihsensible state. The house of Mr. Middleton (also in the service of Sir James Btooke) was attacked and fizrd, and two Of his children unhappily perished In the flataes. Mr. Wellington, a metallurgist in the servlce of thb Borneo CompAny, a guest of Mfr. 3Iiddleton, wax killed and his head cut off, probably under the mistaken supposition that he also was in the service of the Sarawak Governrtent, as the head was given up on the following day. The Government Treasury was plundered of everything it contained, which we regret to hear was condder. able, Nearly every European had placed his money there, as the most secure place. About $10,000 belonging to the Borneo Company were carried off. In the course of a few hours a large amount of Government property was destroyed. " Next day the Chinese Kungsi stated that they had no hostile intentions against any one but persons connected with the Government; indeed, they expressed A wish that Bishop M'Dougall and Mumrs. Ruppell arnd Helms should act as their chieftains, whfile they unreservedly declared their determination to destroy Sir James Brooke and every one in his service. Duringtheiday negotiations wereopened with the Chinese, and it was irranged that they should depart, unmolested by the Malays, with the plunder they hiad obtained; at 4 p.m. they started up the river in their boats. " The immediate causeof this frightful attempt to deetrry the whole of the Government European authorities at Sara. wak is stated to be the stringent measures which Sir James Brooke has found it expedient to adopt to prevent opium smuggling, Some heavy fines have been levied on the smugglers, the amount being paid by the Ugs4i, and latterly some of the offenders have been imprisoned ; but these seem scarcely sufficient to account for such ruthless slaughter and destruction, not sparing age or sex. " Sir James Brooke is stated to regard the affair as trifling and soon to be retrieved, The Government gunboats and the Malays were in eager pursuit of the Chinese, and if the latter are overtaken the retribution will doubtless be severe. The 1dalays everywhere expressed their confidence in Sir James Brooke, The arrival of the steamer Sir James Brooke, belonging to the Borneo Company, was anxiously looked for, and, as that vessel left this on the 21st uit., she would most likely reach Sarawak on the 24th. The Euro. pean ladies had, we hear, quitted forthe mouth of the river, where they would be safe under the proteetion of the Malays. " On the arrivol of the news here the Singaporo gents of Sir James-Brookeand the Borneo Company lost no time in chaitering the schooner Waterlily, and loading her with arms and ammunition, as also rome volunteers for service. The steamer Inflexible, which sailed for Hongkong, took the Waterlily sand a gunboat in tow, and we hear that the Starling will look in at Sarawak on her way to China. " Sir James Brooke, by latest advices, had departed for Simunjang, on the Sadong, the scene of the Borneo Company's operations, and where a large number of Chinese Coolies are employed, with the hope, no doubt, that his presence would prevent any ristig on the part of the Coolies in that quarter. " In our hurried extra of Tuesday last we stated that the Chinese authors of the above sad outrage were refugeesfrom Sambas; in this particular we were in error. The Kungsi comprises the hSine3a settlers Sir James Brooke found at Sarawak on his arrival there. The formidable character of these Chinese is given in Mundy's first volume, page 289 and sequel, and to resist their then demands Sir James Brooke (p. 294) says he was prepared to push the Affair to extremity 'if they did not yield to the terms demanded,' while he prophetically observes, ' I look forward to future trouble in that quarter; but by just government and fair trade they may be brought to good temper, and, at any rate, the chances are we shall strengthen in a greater proportion than they will be able to do.' The recent outrage has clearly shown that the strengthening means have been overlooked, with a fearful result too." (From the Strais Tismes of March 23.) "The British steamer Sir James Brooke, belonging to the Borneo Company, arrived at Singapore yesterday (Sauday), having left Sarawak on the 19th inst., by which op portunity we have received late and important news, which we hasten to lay before our readers. " Our latest advices by the steamer Good Luck were to the 20th February, at which date Sir James Brooke had retired to Simunjang, on the Ssdong river, the head-quar. ter of the Borneo Company's operations. Messrs. Crook. shank, Crymble, Steel, and Penty accompanied the Rajah to Simunjang, the object of the Rajah's visitto that quarter being, as we nor learn, to collect forces in the neighbouring rivers, with the vnew of returning to Sarawak. We previously announced that the Chinese Kungsi people (the insurgents) had evacuated the town of Kuchin, and retired up the country, and that the Malays were preparing to start in pursuit. We now continue the narrative of events. " It appears that on Sunday, Feb. 22, Sir James Brooke received intelligence of the retirement of the Chinese, where. upon he returned from the Sadong to the Sarawak river, but before he could land the Chinese Kungsi had a second time ventured down the river in great force (between 5OO and 600), with feelings whetted, as it were, by their late partial success, and yet chagrined at their failure to overturn the Rajah's authority. The return of the Chinese with so large a force somewhat surprised the Rajh, and compelled him to retire, or venture a collision with an inadequate forme. In the meantime the Eungsi people availed themselves of the time to commit further depredations on the Government property. It now became appa. rent that most extensiva means were needed to suppress the advance of the Kungsi people, whose object appeared to be to secure for themselves the entire paramount authority, alike indifferent to brute force, base treachery, or the vilest measures.. Under these circumstances, Sir James Brooke proceeded to Linga, to secure the co-operation of the chief and the people of that district, but on his way the steamer Sir James Brooke, from Singapore, hove in sight most opportunely; her arrival was not merely opportune, but the site of her anchorage formed the base of aU subsequent operations. Sir James Brooke and his party at once proceeded in the steamer to Kuchin, and soon succeeded in driving tho miscreants out of the town. On inquiry and search it was found that the Datoo Bandar was defending himself against the Chinese, amid a cluster of prahus. The Datoo succeeded in recapturing nine samr pans (boats), and one of the Government prahus (vessels), containing stores, gunpowder, opium, &c. " The body or main force of the Chinese, driven from the town, were finally either out off by the Dyaks or were starved in the jungle. At the outset about 100 of the Chinese were k-lled. The warfare assumed a mode of irregular attack. The Dyaks were let loose, who, from a large circuit, battue-like, drove the Chinese into their fastnesses, accompanied by great loss to the retreaters, where they were hemmed in; in other words, there took place a kind of guerilla warfare of the most harassing character, grievously thinning the number of tke rebels. Still the Chinese were undaunted; from their stronghold they ventured an astack in five prahus, and commenced ravang the banks of the river. This was on the 9th of March. The DAtoo Bandar was stationed in a, single prahui at Tangah Lida (the junctioa of two rivers, about 15 m31es above Kuchin); mecting tlke.K ngsi in their boats,% i Datoo, in his single prahua Q%saad htle, wrich tl& 3ungsi dechned. Think]ng thib% ,% exealkont ithtJkungla and constructed a stockade, which they amed with four guns, and garrisoned with about 250 men with mukets, &c. Believing themselves to be secura the Chinese very foolibly neglected to secure their boats, vhich were captured by their opponents. Leaving his war prahu near the stockade, the Datoo chivalrously proceeded to Kuchin in a small canoe-boat for assistance. The Datoo hastened toRuchin to secure reinforcements, and on tholOthof Maruch hreturned tothestocadeswithtwolargeprahu, nd someDyakbangkongessareserve. Thus strengthened,theDatoo,withhisthree prahus, rnade a dash at the Chinese stockade, where he landed with his party, and carried the place without a re. pulse. The Chinese in tho stockado were cut to piee In half an hour they lost from 100 to 120 men; the rest in thi stockade, having lost their boats, took to the jungle. WO may remark that the defeated party in the stocade con. sisted of picked men; their prindpal chiefs were killed in the assault. The effect of this signal attack was complete. A panic seized the Eungsi people, which was eagerly avaled ot'; the Chinese successively fled from Baaida, Siniawani and Bau. By the night of the 11th of March the Kungs, people were in full retreat towards Sambas, closely followed by bands of Malays, who availed themselves of every opportunity to cut off the straeglers. The Chinese retired in a close body--so close, indeed,.that their asailants failed to cause disorder, and made a desperate resistance, in the presence of their wives and children. " "Had time permitted to organize a concentrated attack not an individual would have escaped. As it is, the wretched fugitives are driven into the jungle, where a vast numbarof them must perish from want and expore before -they can rech a place of security. I According to the soit moderate estimate at least 1.000 Chinese have been Idlled at the ianons places, while al the flourishing- settlements of the Chinese (except at Xuchin) have been destroyed. The exct number of Chinese. who have perished during the retreat it is impossle to say; it must be considerable, since out of a population of .4,q0 to 5,000 Chinese belonging to tho Kungdl, not more than 2,000 escaped the late retribution, including women and children. " Much as we regret letting loose the Dyakd to commit the mopt saysge decimation or rather destruction of a whole people, we cannot sympathize with the diabolism of thie 3:ungsi, who, both individually and collectively, have always received at the hauds of Sir James Brooke Borneo justice- a code regulated by circumstances. The diaboh'cal attempt of the Chinese Kungsi has met with the punishment it de; servid. No reasonable being will pity them, however much they may regret the frightful sacrifice of human life. Experienoe too sadly proves that at the present period kindness, humanity, and forbearance are either misunderstood or but too lightly appreciated by the Chinese, who think they ought to be,dominant, for no earthlyreason that we can discover but because they are cruel and vain. " Having thus disposed of the leading events from Sarawak, there are a few matters of both general and local interest which we cannot allow to pas3-the omission would be rather unjust, inasmuch as the circumstanoces are fresh in our memories. It appears that on the 27th of February, when affairs assumed a rather ugly aspect, Mr. Helms (the, agent for the Borneo Company) was despatched to Sambas, to inform the Dutch authorities there how matters stood at Sar walw , and to request assistanco. The assistant-resident at Samba expressed great sympathy, and immediately deepetched a fast boat to Pontianak, where the chief resident wvas the staying. The latter, without hesitation, despatdhed a war steamer, with such soldiers as he could well spare, accompanied by an offer of further assistance, should it be necessry for the protection of British lives and propertyan act quite charactaristic of our Dutch neighbours The Dutch war steamer arrived at Sa-awak on the 15th instant (wheh allwvas happiy over), and after staying three days returned to Saravvak " On inqui±y among the chieftains who acted against the Chinese it was foud that their loss did not exceed 12 Malaya and Dyaks. "The Chinese residents at Kunohin rwere completely restored to confidence whien the siteamer left, and lad reopened their shops. So great, indeed, Sheir reliance on the stbility of the Rajah's Government that not one of their wives or children was sent aWAy to Singapore in the steamer. A letter received from Sir James Brooke mentions that iiost of the guns taken by the Kungd had been recovered, as aso a Iarge proportion of the muskets carried away from the fdrts The loss by the late outrages chiefly falls on Sir James Brooke and the Government people. "W e are right glad to notice that Mr. CroocAhank had nearly recovered from her injuries, and her husband's wounds were doing well Sir James amd the Bishop were in good health and spirits."
I To THE EDITOR OF THE 2IMES Slr,-I bava just read in yo Ur valuable number of this dYth TP= ofu XeMarlborough-Btreet police-court, in which I d with stonishment the following atement:- "The dispn.te, it was stated by a person in Court, with Mr. Gautier was that he was offernng 16s. for dress coats, while full-priced masters were paying 22s." As that sentence is entirely the opposite of tratb, I request you to be so kind s to allow me to inform you, . That no statement of any kind has been made before Mr. Bingham respecting the price I pay to my workmen. 2. That the dispute was not betvween myself alone and the workmen, but the atrike affected all my French brother tailors as well. 3. Instead of stating that I paid 16s. for a drem coat, while the full-priced masters were paying 22s., your reporter ought to bave said just the reverse, viz.-that I pay 22s. instead of 16a.; and I believe that no house in Londor, English or French, pays such a high price. The workmen who remained with me can certify it, and I submitted to MIr. Bingham the list of the prices I sayi Ilam happy to state at the same time that the strike is over, thanks to the wise conduct of some of the worlmen. I am, Sir. Your obedient servant. A. M.

Ax OLD STORY RzvmVnD.-The Tipton Advortiser yublished in Iowa, contains a story apparently In imitation of Poe's "Case of M. Valdemar," which is evidently a Pure fabrication. It is contained in'a letter from one Dr. John Moreton, and relates the case of a patient of his who dis. agreed with his wife; she believing in spiritual manifesta. tions while he scouted them. She died, telling him with her last breath that on his aeath-bed she should appear to him In the body. A few weeks after he died, Dr. John Moreton being present, and as he was gasping his last a horrible body, through whose decaying flesh the white bones gleamed, and from whose rotten limbs dropped loathsome grave worms upon the floor, entered the room. This horrible form said, Come, William, they wait for you-I wait," and fell to the floor, where it remained the next day, and the body of the husband being conveyed away the house was bhrned. This WtOry is suported by two or three affidavits, taken before James Taylor, notary public for Grand Traverse county, Michigan. Those may believe it who choose. AONG TH SAVAGas.-The Sprinafidc (Illinois) Bepublican says that a Mr. William Bailey caled upon the editor sud related his adventures among the Indians. About 18 months a4o he was travelling, with nine men, from the Gulf of Mexico, when the Indian stole their mules. The travellers went in pursuit, and overtook six Indians, whom they kiled; butthey themselves were surrounded byabody of Indinsn, who kiled all but Bailey. Him they stripped and bound hand and foot on a pony. After U davs' hard riding they reached an encampment. After recrinting for a week the Indians went out on a robbing expedition. and on the Santa F6 road attacked a baggage train, and killed every person with it. Their prisoner was kept strictly conued during the day, and was tied up every night with pieces of raw bide, by the hands, to the Ilinb of a ee, as high up as he could reach and stand on the ground. Duringthe day he was allowed to lie down and sleep a few hours. During the time Mr. Bailey was with them they went on five robbing expeditions, taking him always along with them. The last merchant train they robbed they took two men prisoners, who had bravely defended themselves till their weapons were all discharged, and who had kiUed 12 of the red skins. These two men were then taken and tied to a stake and skinned alive. Mr. Bailey was placed close to them, and compelled to witness this horrible scene. Every time he would close his eyes they would punch him with spears and bayonets until he would open them, and look on this picture of revolting horror. They then took the skin, reeking with warm blood, and slapped him arotxnd the face with it, covering hiy with blood, aud telling him if he tried to escape this should be his fate. One of their excursions was agairst the United States' mail waggons. They killed the five men with them, tore open the letters, got out the money, and, after cutting out the pictures from the bank-bills, threw them away. They kept all the newspapera that had pictures in them, throwing everything sway that was not embellished. For three nights after this they did not tie hini up, but kept guard over him. The third nigbt they had a big wardance, and in the excitement forgot Mr. Bailey. While dancng around their fire in-front of t a tent he crawled out under the back of the tent, seized one of the ponies, and escaped. He was soon missed, and was followed for five days. At the expiration of that time they came so close on him that they fired at him, which obliged him to leaTe his horse and take to the mountains. Forttnately, he found a small cave, just large enough to crawl into, in which place he remained for a day and a half, the Indians being so near him that he could hear their footsteps as they searched for him. He remained in this position until he was assured his pursuers had left when -.he. emerged from his conceahneut. and made a sTraght shoot for the lKickapoo settlement, about 6000 miles distant. In about a month he reached the longedfor pcoint. While witb the Camanches he was fed on raw horseflesh. A *-zw SPrCrEs OF RAT.-During the last few weeks, Mr. William Prest, farmer, of Long-street, Thirsk, bas observed a number of hills of soil in one of his meadows in construction similar to those made by themole, but smaller in size. The young gass was eaten around therm to the roots, and he was at a losto discoverthe cause. On Tuesday, however, he set a trap, and during the day caughi two of the delinquents, which are a cuious speciea of the rat tribe. They were about 13 inches in length, and at the tieck 81 inches in circumference. The skin, which is similar to fua, is as fine as silk, and is of a beautiful brown colour. The neck is remarkably strong, as if for burrowing like thb mole. The tail is nearly like that of the rat, and the ejes also; the under part of the bellT is of a snuff r colour, arnd very smnooth and bright. The animals were re! makaily Sat. We suspect that, instead cz finding a neLw a pecies ot rat, the worthv farmer has discovered a mare's nest. The description appears to apply to the species krnown as the old Engliih rat, which has a peculiarly fine fur, and feeds on vegeta lns.-Mnc4estcr Giun-diic

The year 1840, when (it was expected that Prince Albert would attend Newmarket to witness the race for The Two Thohusaind, has down to the present time lived in the memory of the inhabitants as an occasion when the largest number of visitors ever asembled on the Heath. The attendance yesterday, however, fully equvlled, if it did not exceed, that of 1840, and the many vehicles which rattled into the town dnring the morning forcibly reminded one of the good old coaching and posting days. Tho To ihousandgr1wmintorea eand iiportnee until the very moment the flags were lowered. The respective owners of the leading favourites seemed equally confident, and the sudden chadges which were daily made in the hetting attested the " open" character of the race. The guess which we made on Monday as to the numerical strength of the eld proved correct, for exactly a dozen competitors went to the poSt. The description of the race given above renders it unnecessary for us to refer at length to it here. The result was hailed with great acclamation, especially by Yorkshire sportsmen, who not a little triumphed in the success of Vedette, who was almost unanimously pronounced by southern turfitesto be lame. It is not a little singular that Fazzoletto, the viinner of the Two Thousand last year, was also considered lame. Voltigeur, too, the sire of Vedetto, was violently o,posed by good judges for the Derby of 1850, owing to the same peculiarity of action. Velocipede and many other turf celebrities might be mentioned as a proof that a seemming lameness does not greatly detract from a horse's merit. The minor events were unimportant, and except by those persons immediately intereited in the results they were regarded with indifference. The aftermoon was somewhat cold and cloudy, bat the weather offered no drawback frcm a faull enjoyment of the sport. A remarkable incident in two dead heats for the 10 sovs. Sweepstakes, T. Y.

TBA-GROWING Iir IN)DIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-In your issue of the 27th inst I have read a letter, signed "A. E. D.," on tea-growing in India. It is perfectly true, as is stated by your correepondent, that the extent of the oouutry saitable for the growt h of tea onthe various branches of the Himalayan range is almost without bounds," &c. Bat what Englishman, I would ask, will proceed to the interior of India to engage in any mercantile or aricuatural pursuit, if they are to be subjeocted to the Company's blws, administerod in the Company's courts, by the Company's serants? Shonld the projected measure, which waxs ably discussed a short time since in the leading columns of Te Tnzm,, be carried into effect I venture to predict that within two years the entire Mofussjj of India will be donuded of European plantors of every kind and grade, aud British enterprise be no longer known beyond the immediate precints of the Presideucies-Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Land for the cultivation of the tea plant may be had to any roquired extent in the Sab.Himalayan regions, and on the Dhoon of Dherah; and it has been shown that under proper management the best quality of tea can be grown at Is. 6d. per pound, and yield at the sme tine * highly remunerative profit. The natives of India are extremely partial to toe but at present it is beyond their means. Our Europoun troops might be supplied with a superior article at a comparatively miall, coat, inwead of with bad tea at a very exorNtant price; and it has often occurred to me that it the Govern. ment of India thought more of tea-growing and leos of opium cultivation the interests of India would be much better oonsalted. With our Indian possessions thee is not the slightest reason why Engiand should be dependent oi China for tea. I have the hbcxour to be, Sir, Your obodi>t smrvaM. J. L. BroMdstai, Apzil 29.

MILITARY WDUCATIOz. TO THE EDITOE OF THE '1DfES. Sir,-The letter of Dr. Vaughan, of Rarrow-, which appeared in The Times a few days ao, has been read by no one with deeper interest than by myself, for this imong ether reasons-that its publication under the circumstances appears to justify, if, indeed, it do not require, the statements which I am going to make and the suggestion which I shall venture to offer. Dr. Vaughan speaks of certain papers as having been transmitted to him, and addresses his comnmunication to an officer eonnected vith the education of the army. The officer to whom he writes is LieutenantColonel Lefroy, my successor as Inspector-General of Military Schools, and the papers to which he refers -were drawn up, some at the Horse Guards, under the direction of;liis Royal Highneas the Commander-in-Chief, others in *the Waoffice, on thet invitation bf the Seci%tary of State for War. They consist of three plans or schemes for the establiihment of a system of education for candidates. for commissions, and for officers after their entrance into the service,-one bearing the signature of the Duke of Cambridge, 'one signed by Lieutenant-Colonel Lefroy, and the third signed by myself. And there are added to them criticisms on all these plans, drawn up by the several authorities, each dealing with the plans which had been submitted by the others. Colonel Lefroy's plan is understood to express the views of the present Secretary of State on the important question under discussion. The planemanating from the Horse Guards speaks, itis to be assulmed, the opinions of the highest; authorities there. My own is the result of many years of anxious consideration of the subject, and of much open anc confidential communication with Mr. Sidney Herbert while he presided at the War-office. Though sent in long before the publication of Colonel Yolland, Colonel Smyth, and Mr. Lake's report, it is founded very much upon the same data from which they draw their inferences; for in 1847 I had visitec the niulitary schools of France, Belgium, Prussia, Saxony, and HIolland, and given to Lord Panmure, then Alr. Fox Maule, a report which, doubtless for exceUent reasons, he considered it inexpedient to publish or to lay upon the table of the House of Commons. Parliament will meet in a few days, and the suggestion which I venture to offer is this, that theset plans and criticisms be immediately called for in. both Hlouses. When this is done the fact wiiU probably come to light that but for the breaking up of Lord Aberdeen's Government in 1855 the -want under which the army still suffers would have been supplied long ago. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. G. R. GLEIG. Royal rospital Chelsea, April 28.
TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES Sir,-I cannot allow a most noble act on the part of Mr. Erasmus Wilson, the celebrated surgeon and author of the noted work on skin diseases, to pass unnoticed. Last Weda nesday, the 22d inst., a cold, wintry, wet day, as this gentleman was ridingalong in his carriage, an alarm was suddenly raised that a woman had throwii herself into the Regent's-c¢al. The cry of distress was sufficient. A poor miserable wretch was struggling for life. The carriage was stopped, the coat and waistcoat quickly thrown aside, and, rushig to the water's edge, he pluuged in after her, and. almost succeeded in bringing her to the banks, when he found himself fast sinling from the increasing weight of bin hoots and trousers, owing to the contact of the water. Disengaging himself, however, he, with great exertions, once more gained the land, but, although almost exhaused, yet, having obtained one end of a rein from one of the bystanders, he agpin plunged in, and this time happilysucceeded in brig the body of tho almost lifelase woman to the sbore.

FORBEIGN INTBLLIGUNCE. FRtANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) [The following appeued in our seoond edition of yes. kicaay :-I PARDS, MOV'DAY, APRL 27. Private accounts from Berne, of the 26th, give the project of mediation adopted by the Paris Confelence in the following terms:- " There will be no mention of a title in the treaty. "The indemnity is fixed at a million francs. "The property of the Church and other foundations can. not be diverted from their object. " All the other conditions are set aside." The letter adds that the project has been favourably received at Berne. A telegraphic despatch from Toulon, dated this afternoon, announces the Grand Duke Constantine's departure from that place. A private letter, dated 24th, from a French friend at Toulon, gives some details about the "sayings and doings " of the Grand Duke Constantine at that port. I have already noticed te moneagroness of the Mfonitetur in speaking Of his Highness's movements, and the accounts furnished by the MEinisiterial pajpe are of course suited to Ministerial taste. The writer of the present letter is a professional man: he de- scribes -what he has been an eye-witness of. He I says:- "The Grand Duke will positively leave us on the 27th, after having had at Toulon a reception which will long be remembered In our local chronicles. He Will quit ocr harbour on berd the Eclaireur, a French steamer, which wil convoy him first to the naval establishment of the Clotat, which has contracted with the Russian Goverament for the constrction of divers ships and steam nachinery. Tho Prince will arrive the same night at Marseilles. " At Toulon he has been received, as the guest of the Shate, at the Maritime Prefecture. Balls, dinners, presentations, and representations of every sort, in the harbour and oi shore, have signalized his presence among us. Two salutes from aboutt 800 guns-one per gun from each voes in the harbour-announced his arrival And landing at the port. A third salute of the same number Will S3g. nalize his departure for Marseilles. " At the theatre the Mayor insisted, after a rather lengthenod refusal, upon his taking his seat on the same throne on whilch the Prince President of thoe epublic sat for the last time when he came to Toulon in 1852, not long before the official proclamation of the Empire. From an unwillingness to wound the feeHlngs of the guest of Yrance, it had been auggested to cover with a vell during the time he was here a trophy mado out of some of the guns taken at SebastopoL On reflection, however, it Was thought that sfuch extreme precaution was uncaUed for, a3 the past and future of a great nation like Russia did not require the same tenderness as those of a weaker State, Ths trophy of Sebastopol was therefore allowed to esne in the light of day during the offlicial visit. I am sure the Prinee would have thought the same had he been consulted on the subject. *' In the official visits to the port, which lasted two days, and before the visits of detail, the Grand Duke passed through a double line of troops of artilery and infantry of marine, on the breasts of many of whom hung the Cr1. me decoration, given by Queen Victoria, either by Itself, or by the side of a Turkish or French deooration, and in several instances between them both. The Cri.. mean decoration led to a brief conversation between the Grand Duke and a Lieutenant-Colonel-not the officer commanding the corps, who arrived too late to take part in the campain The Prince examined like a practised and Inteligent nan everything connected with the marine department, naval constructions, the artillery, and fortifications. He addressed to the heads of the different branches qaostions marked by sound judgment, discused with them the strong and the weak points of all he saw, and particularly directed the attention of General Todtleben to all that was remarkable in the artillery and engineer department, and to him, as Well as to a Russian Admiral and an Engineer of the Russian Navy, he carefully pointed out what. ever appeared to him new in our naval department. His questions were brief, and occasionaly abrupt (un peu brusque), but he was not unpolite in his manner. He compared the information he received on the subject of rifle guns with what he had heard of the same arms in Sar. dinia. He examined with great interest and with marked atteation the martne armouries of Toulon, as well as the artiUery, whiob, as every one knows, is the most artistioally designed and decorated in the world. This, however, is only a salle d'armes for exhibition to strangers; there is another at Toulon much more extensive, and from which arms are furnished to the navy. The Prince also inspected in their docks several sailing vessels, to which screws are fitted, to some by lengthening in the middle, which allows of their keeping their old guns and the samo sailing power as if they hod been intended from the beginning to be stamers. The repairing docks, which contain the Imperatrlce Eugenic, a new frigate, and the Gironde-this last of Iron and wood, bY M. Arman, of Bordeaux, who Is building two ships for the Raussian Government-particularly attracted his attention. But what struck the Grand Duke uost of all were the three floating batteries which attacked the fort of Kinburn, and the gunboats destined to ascend the Dnieper. While examining them he observed that no conclusion could he drawn from the fact of floating batteries having reduced a fortress wrhich had no guns of lung range or projectiles of great weight; and the experiments made with such guns have proved In Rusaia, aud elsewhere, that Iron plates of four or five inches thick equal to those of the 'doating batteries could not resist them even at great dis. tances. By the way, we were a little surprised to find the Grand Dake invariably asking those about him to translate the French metrical measures which we use into English terms, apparently in order to form a just estimate of the length or thickness of what ho saw. In fact, with re. spect to the floating batteries the opinionof the Russian was pretty much the same as that of the French officers. As to the gunboats, when he heard that they were fitting out for the Chinese rivers, he could not suppress a movement of dissatisfaction, and he said to those about him, ' What, you are again going to take the chestnuts out of tho fire there also "' (Vous sUe core tir-r 1 les mm-s-e dufcu.) " Many French officers, even among those who have not the honour of wearing the Crimean medal, regretted that politeness prevented them from saying to their guest that France is not in tho habit of ' taking the chestnuts out of the fire' for any one. " I now give you a few details of another kind :-Admi. ral Dabourdieu, our haritime Prefect, who could hardly have fooUowed the party on foot, as he lost a leg at Nava. mino (where he was a midshipman), had invited aU the officers to accompany, in full dress, and on foot, the Grand Duke and his attendants, who, with the Prefect and some superior officers, were conveyed in carriages to the different places they visited. This arrangement produced some discontent, and, indeed, several of those who would have to trudge on foot disappoared altogether from the cort'ge. Theso carriages were French, and were lent to the Maritime Prefect, who has no carriage of his own, either by the contractors to the navy or by rich individuals who have sons in the service. Many were Annoyed at the rapidity with which the horses were made to proceed before a body of officers who were expected to follow on foot, and they murmured at the excessive economy (economy is very praise worthy to a certain extent) of the Prefect, who is repaid from the budget, on the presentation of proper vouchers, for any expenditure necessary for receptions like the present. " I conclude with two anecdotes. The Russians had chosen the 20th of April to land in France, because it is the auniversary of the birth of Napoleon lDt. They were, however, much surprised during the offcial banquet at not hear. ing any alusion made to that daY. They were informed that in France it is the fete, or Saint's, day of the Sovereign that is oelebrated, and not his birthday. " The Graud Duke having aa1od an officer what difference there was between the French military medal and the cross of the Legion of Honour, was answered, drily, that the dif. ference was 160f., in allusion to the pension attached to the latter. I do not vouch for the authenticity of this anecdote, but you have it as itwas oiven to me. "I must not omit telling you that General Todtleben, Who was a pupil of thelEngineering School of St. Petersburg, left Russia for the first time only a month ago, although the vanity of my dear countrymen has made them say in some of the papers that he had studied in the College of Metz," General Liprandi, of the Russian army, has arrived in Paris. General Luders, who intends, it is said, spending some years in France, has fixed his resideace at Versailles. The review, which will take place in Paris on the thh of May, in presence of the irand Duke, wil be ommanded by Marshal Mag!nan. One of the three Frenoh Engineers appointed to direct the constection of railroads In Russa has left Paris for St. Petersburg. Despatches were received to-day from the French Minister at Copenhagen. It appears that an in. fluential party in Denmark is endeavouring to force the King to abdicate. EHis Majesty resists, and he has declared to the members of theDiplomatic Corps that his enemies 'shall never compel him to lay down the sceptre. Yeatterday, about 2 o'clock, the Archbishop of Aix vas proceeding to the Church of N6tre Dame de Bonne Nouvelle, the fesival of which was held yesterday. His carriage, while turning the corner of the Rue de laLune,was upset, and it was through the window the Cardinal and the two priest who attended him were extriecatod from their unpleant position. His Eminence had so much recovered from-the ahock in theafternoon that hewras able- to officiate at the Church of St. Eustachei -- There is no improvement to be yetunoticed either in the wholesale or retail trade of Paris; both manufacturers and shopkeepers are complaing. Sorme few commission agents have -arrived fiom the. provinces and from foreign countries, but their pur- chases are on a very limited scale, and even, those. are made on such terms as to leave very little profit. to the manufacturer. Some Spanish buyers have ap.: peared in the market for furniture, lace, brozes, and jewelry, but a few privileged housea only profited by their arrivaL The scarity of cah4rantioned in the letters from the principal towns in. Europe is very prejudicial to commercial. transac. tions. The French manufacturers particularly co04,plain of the long credits taken by the rmerohant-s both in North and South America, where money carries so high a rate of interest. The salebf =torials for ladfes' dresses is very much influenced by the weather. It becomes acsive with fieat and urishine and languisheo with cold, wind, and rai. Nu ;iu ; are anxious to provide thiemrselves wi'th summer dresse, but the keen north wind now blowing confines them to the house. There is not much business doing In the manufacturing towns in the departments, except at El.bcuf, Roubaix, and Turcoing, where a certain actinty prevails, but, as long as trade in dull in Paris the manafacturers in the provinces feel the low of their usual orders from the cakital.. The ailk mannfacurers of Lyons and St. Etienne have received a few tidfling orders from Germany and the United States, but they have not been able to maintain the high prices they obtained a few months since, and if they hiad not made a reduction in their demands they would have made no sales. Ilaw silk has fallen in ..the southern markets, and great hopes are entertained of an abundant silk crop. The appearance of the- mulberry trees is highly encouraging, and where the leaves arev abundant the silkworm Is thriving. The progrees and. bringing to perfection of the ilkworm*this year will possss more than a mercial interest for the wellbeing of thou ds of families will depend on the approaching ailk crop. The corn market was more firm this week than last. The. farmers are holding back their stocks on hand until they ascertain positvely the quality of the next harw vest. At the last Parismarket-selers demanded -an advance on wheat of lf. 5O. the heotolitre, but were ranable to obtain more than If. It was remarked that inferior samples were teo neglectOd, which indicates a deficiency of stock on the -part of the public, Official returs show- -that the importtions of foreign corn during the month of arh amount: to 1,056,690 metrical quintals. The pce of four, which was remarkably firn all the week, experienced a further rise at the last Paris market, The bakers were disposed to purchase, and more business would have been trantea but the millers were not satisfied with an advance of If. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. For the beat marks 74f. were offered, but the holders of stock would not sell at less than 74f. S0O. The stock of fiour in the market stores diminished during the week by 2,000 metrical quintals; it is now reduced to 15,000 metrical quintals. Accounts from Marseilles state that the arrivals of wheat from the Levant am decreasing, annd it is not expected that there will be much stock on hand at the period of the next harvest, the daily consumption oeing eonsiderable. L-etters recelved at Marseilles from the Sea of Azoff announce that the ice had completely disappeared from that sea, and that the port of Taganrog was clear at the begining of this month, but wheat was scarce in that market. Hard wheat Is quoted there at from 2Sf. to 26f. the hectolitre. The prie of wine still continues high in Paris. Sotwithstanding the favourable appearance of the vines, the prop)rietors pretend that it will require three or four abundant vintages top prduce any considerable fall in prices. Good brandy has nearly disappeared fronm the Parismarket. Beetroot spirits om the north are auoted at froml28f. t1SOf. the hectolitre. The Boiyathbne has arrived at Marseilles with accounts from Constantinople to the 16th. According to the last advices from the Principalities the Turks were evacuating those provinces, and the principal Boyards were in accord with the MoldoWallachian patriots in demanding the union of the two provinces under a foreign prince as vassal of the Porte. Prince Ghika, the representative of Turkey, favours, it is said, this movement. It is thought that he will be disavowed. The Marquis de Belmont, Chamberlain to the Emperor, Colonel Fav4, of the Artillery, and x Bourgon, one of His Majesty's aides-de-camp, despatched from Paris to receive the Grand Duke Constantine, have arrived at Marseiles.

TBR. PUBLIO REALTH. (From the RegistA-General's Weekly Return*) In the week that eaded on Saturday 1,065 deaths were registered in London, a number which differs only in a small degree from those id the two previous weeks. In the ten years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,048. But as thle deaths of last week oocurred in an increased population, the average, to admit of comparison, should be raised in pro. portion to the increase, in which case it will become 1,153. The reault is that the number now returned is less by 88 than the deaths that would have occurred if the average rate of mortality had prevailed. The births registered last week were 1,788; they were numerous enough to supply the vacancies caused by death, and to contribute, moreover, 723 lives to the inorease of population. Although the weather has lately been changeable, and on some days of an ungenial character, It does not appear as yet to have fatally aggravated those complaints which are most subjeot to its influence. The deaths causod by diseases of the respiratory organs were last week 205, having bhen in the two previous weeks 222 and 200. The corrected average for last week is 200. From bronchitis and pneumonia together 179 persons diedlast week; of these 83 were children less than 3 yearsgold. Whooping.cough continues to be the most fatal of the diseases inthe zyrnotic class; it numbers 57. One death from smallpox occurrod in the west district, and 2 in the north; there were none in any other part of the metropolis. The deaths from typhus 1(and oommon fever) declined to 29, of which 14 occurred in the east dlstricts The west districts return none from fever. A case of bronchitis and typhoid fever which proved fatal in Somers. town is stated by tke medical attendaiit to have arisen from the opening of a foul drain in the house. Soarlatina was fatal in 20 cases, 3 of which occurred in tho sub-district of Kenniugton (3st part), in houas that are situated not 100 yards from each other. In one of those houses 6 persons have been attaoked with scarlatins, and 2 of them have died. Four nonagenarians, all womnen, ied in the week; the oldest, a widow, in the Hornsey-road, had attained the age of 96 years. Two cases of intemperance are recorded in the present return. Last week the births of 904 boys and 884 girts, in all 1,788 children, we'e registered in London. In the ten corresponding weeksof the year 1847-56 the average number was 1,583. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of; the barometer in the week was 29,882 in. The mean readings on Monday and Tuesday were above 30 in. The highest reading was 30-14 in. on Monday. The mean temperature of the week was 46-6 deg., whiech ia 0'6 deg. below the average of the samo week in 43 yea On Sunday the mean iemperature was 56-4 deg., which is 9-9 deg. above the average of the tame day ;lt continued above the average ti3l Wednesday; and on the Ilat three dayx it was from 7 dog. to 9 dog. below it. The highest reading waa obtain on gunday, and was 69 deg.; the lowest was on Fri. day-viz., 28-2 doB. showing a range of temperature equal to 4018 deg. in the week. The mean dew.point tempera. ture wasa 40i1.deg., and the difference betwoen this and the mean temperature of the air was 6S5 deg. The wind In the beginning of the week was for the most part in the soathwest; on the lst three day, It was ?enerilln the northeast.

T.zz UXZTTD STATPAW (thou OTI, own - NEW YORK, APnIll 1. One,of the ve-;ed questions of diplomacy hasjuslt been settled and placed beyond the reach of futur' iunderstandings. Tlie formal convention betweeia the United States and Donmark on the subject of thd Sound D haes a jiust been signed at Washixigb-,a by Mr. Cass, the Secretary of State, and M.

The other conditions and. S&ti pons of the arrangement are already known Xn Europe, The Aierican MiniAter Extraordinary to China, Mr. W. B.'

He will embark in a: early steaedr fdr 3England, where hle will corn- minicate thepurpose'of' Iih mission to the English, Government, obtain the latest information of the state of affars,' and learn what the policy of our AiAministration is to be; he will then ga to Paris, cdnfer in the same manuer with the French Governnmint, and then proceede Overland to Aden, where he wll be met by the UnIited States' steamer which w;ll take him to Csaton.

The arrival of the Clifornian mail brings no fresh intelligence from Nicaragua, but the rumouis of the late astonishing victories are not confirmed. All the private accounts reveal a deplorable state of suffering anddisease among the fea troops remaining to Walker, who appears to be still hemmed in at Rivas. The "glorious" nowswhich puzzled people on the arrival of the last mail begins to look as if the 1st of April had somethingto do with it. The late State Treasurer of Californla, Mr. Bates, refused to plead to the impeachment before the Senate for embezzling the State funds; he denied its jurisdiction, The Senate; notwithstanding, has found him guilty and declared him incapable and disqualified from, hereafter holding any office of honour or profit in the State of California. He has still to be tried criminally on the charge. The language of the press in reference to the assumption of the State debt and tho avoidance of repudiation is hopeful, but the quetiotsmustremain in suspense for some months to come. The period of collision between the peculiar caommunity of the Mormons and the-' Majesty of the United States' Federal laws appears to be rapidly approaching. It could only be a question of time, but the Saints seem- desirous of hastening it. .Tust as the smaller body settled at lTaulvooI drew down destruction on Itself by resistibg "legal process" on the part of the State officers, so the i larger and more numerous zettlement of ltah will provoke the same fate by defying the power of the Federation. Distance and isolation have secured the Saints such complete immunity, so far, for al their opinions and usages, that they have grown insolent, andwhatiaworse, imprudent. SometimeagoBrigham Young, their absolute ruler, ordered all the records and papers of the Supreme Court of the territory'] to be destroyed; they were accordingly seized and deliberately burnt, with a collection of 900 volumes of the United States' laws and reports; they were only the laws of the "Gentiles," which the Saints reject; some decisions aud sentence of the Federal Judge, which Young -ancelled and reversed, raising to honour the criminals this judge had consigned to prison, were the cause of the audacious cremation. As Brigham Young, by some extraordinary compromise of the late Administration (the Saints always vote the Democratic ticket), is the duly-appointed Governorof the territory of Utah, and draws a salary from the Treasury at Washington in that capaoity, burning the library' and archives of the Supreme Court of the Federal Power he (civilly) represents is rather a strong measure. It is not only an outrage and an insult to the central authority, but an overt act of treason and rebellion. The Judge of the Supreme Court, unprotected, and a " Gentile," having no forco behind him to carry out his docisions, unable to get verdicts, and altogether reduced to a cipher, has resigned, and sent in a formal complaint and description of the state of things generally in the City of the Salt Iake to the AttorneyGeneral of the Union at Washington. The case ;s therefore fairly before the Government. The allegations of Judge Drammond in his report are really of such a character, confirmig the rumours that have found their way into the journals during the past two or three years, that, if any jurisdiction of the territory is to be retained at all, an armed force will have to be sent to the Salt Lake; if the Saints were within reach of any centre of population, the common law (or that of Judge Lynch) would have overtaken them long ago. Agailst any " Gentlle" force, civilor military, the desert that surrounds them is a very effectual barrier for the present, but on great provocation it may be passed. Judge Drummond states that the Morifion chief priest, like the "Old Man of the Mountain," has a vsworn band of assassins-tbe Danites,-who commit murder at the command of the church as a religious duty, inflict bodily mutilations: on offending persons as a secondary punishment, seize property, and are generally the " executive". officers of the chief. Suspected parties, or tlhose known to be dangerous to the church, disappear, especially in leaving the territory; they are supposed to be murdered by the Indians; really, the judge says, they are dis posedc of by' order of Brigham Young. Mr. Drummond's predpesosor, the late Secretary of the territory, Mr. Ba i and Captain J. Gunnison and a party of eight others have thus been murdered. The charges made can, it v ind, be proved ny numerous witnesses, whose names cannot be made ,public now, as their lives in that case would not be safe for a day. Long -before Judge Drummond,reiigned he says the judicial power of the Federation had become a mere farce. En every case on which a jury was called some member of it had received the instructions of Brigham Young, and, whatever mi,ght be the evdence or the charge of the Gentile judge, the private orders were obeyed, and no conyiction was possible. The chief's own sentences and puishments were strictly carried out by his Danites withoult triaL. The newspaper rumours of such things have hitherto been doubted ;theyseemed to belong to the region of romance rather than to actual life at the preset day; but they are taling shape and form, and re vealing the extraordinary fact that far in the wilderness there is a community-of 100r,000 people governed by an absolu'te theocracy, with lpolygamy as the basis of society and assassination a recognized instrument of the religious despotim. The proportion of the community drawn from the most Ignorant of the peasantry of Europe is large and they know nothing of the civil power of the United States; this, and a blind belief in the sacred character of the head of the saints, renders uch * system possible. It is a a ppalling set-off against the intelligence and enlghtenment of tho 19th century, of which we hear so much. The boundless territory of the wetern continent hsx enabled this anomaly, once despised M mere,ly contemptible, to continue, and, in a material sense, to flourish. If the old here6ies of formner centuries, the Anabaptists and others, had had the Mhe-facilities of remoYbig from - contact with the reit of the world, history might have recorded somethingof this lind before; but they arose in the midst of populous and ;seftled'c ountie, codd not get out of them, and were erushed. The lasr 'will bridg6 the 8pace bet*een ociety and the Mormons, and they will be eruthed also. Distance, isolation, and the reluc ce to begi, what might seem a teligious perseeution' hav hitherto protected them; but, politically, thej^'are becoroing rebels sand, socially, practising a- estem of authorized murder wrhich leveIs them wit~h the Thugs of India; anld they will be dealt witliaccosrdingly.

CHARLOTTE BRONTy. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-If yonr columns are conspicuous for one thing more than another it is for their even-handed justico. May I, then, say that the accounts given of the " bad diet and treatment '7 at Cowan Bridge School have been continually contradicted by teachers and pupils who were there with Miss Brontc. The lady who was the superintendent of that establishment in 1824 (whose husband heads a collego in America) wrote in 1855 a long and complete answer to all the assertions in Jane Wr4 and her able letter appeared in a review. Mr. Gaskell tells us that the "little Bront6s were naturally very delicate, their father an austere atd peculiar man, denying his children animal food, &o., and that fever was often hovering over saworth." Is it fair, then, to trace all Mi.s Bront6's after sufferings to the " bad diet and treatrent " (?) at Cowan Bridge ? Rather should we take the testimony of hundreds of daughters of clergymen who, with their parents, have grate. fully acknowledged all the benefits they derived in that cbaritable institution than the aucont of one, however talented, who left the establishment when but a ohild of nine years old. I can speak from a porsonal kiowvledge of that invaluable lnst'Thution from its infancy. Noone admires Miss Bront'm bright genius more than I do, bult justice and truYth I admire also.

Our report of this long and complicated case contained a statement which, although not affecting the real grounds of tho Vice-ChanceUor's judgment, which assumed the complete bonaffdes, openness, and fairness of the compromise made so long ago az the year 1781, we are nevertheless anxious to correct, as it might lead to the inference that the present plaintiff had now brought forward unquestioned proof of the heirship of his grandfather z(ad therefore of hiself ) to the original owner of the estates in question by enpplyloga link in the pedigree which hadi been vwanting at the tune of the compromise. The statement was as f ol- " The plaintiff since filing his bi!l had discovered documnentary proof of the marriage of Ann Stote, daughter of Cuthbert Stote, wIth Will.am Manby, grandfather of Stote MIanby, the cLaImant in 1781, and of her being the daughter of Cuthbert Stote, the nephewr of Sir RcadSoe b father of Dorothy Windsor." RcadSoe h We published in our yesterday's impression a letter from the defendant's solicitor, stating the real nature of the documents recently discovered as showFing only "that an Ann Stote, described as of South lKelsey and of Caistor, was arriedi to a William Manby, of Caistor, a miller." The Inadvertence In cur report of Saturday arose from the idenUity of Ann Stote, wife of Willlam hlanby, wi1th Ann, *daughter of Cuthbert Stote, being stated broadly as a fact, *inatead of its being stated as the infeec urged by the psplintirfs counsel as necessarily arising from the evidence in its present state.

There had been a misdirection, and the learned Judge was quite satisfied with the verdict. There would therefore be no rule. Mx. Justice WIuHrTax, who presided at the trial, said he was quite satisfied with the verdict. Rule rofused. THE QUE1E V. LLOYD. In this case, in which the Court had granted a criminal Information against the defendant for an attempt to bribe a party to vote in the election of a Poor Law auditor in ihorth Wales, Sir F. KELLY now moved to enlarge the rule till next term, in order to enable the defendant to file affidavits. Lord CAMPBrLL Baid that on the first day of Michaelmas, Hhlary, and Easter terms the judges were in the habit of waiting upon the Lord ChanceUor ; but at the commencement of Trinity term it was not the custom to do so. The Court would therefore sit on the first day of Trinity term, and the case in question would be taken at the sitting of the Court. VILLERS V. XIARHREAVES. This was a special Case for the opinion of the Court. The action was in trespass for levying a highway rate by distress and sale of the plaintiff's goods. The question raised was as tothe power ofthe surveyors of the highways in the pariah of Old Swinford to mako the rato within tho district of the Commissioners for tho Improvement of Stourbridge. The ease was remarkable only for its entanglement and the obscurity of the local Acts. Mr. KEATITG, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Scotland), was heard on the part of the plaintiff; and Mr. H. HILL, Q.C (with whom was Mr. Huddleston), for the defendant. L6rd CAMPBELL said it was very important that the Act which had beenpassed,the3lstof George IIL, fortheregulation of all matters in the township was found so defective, that another Act was passed, which recited that the former Act had been found in many reoscts so defective and inefficient that it was desirable that it should be amended. The latter statate, the 6th of George IV., was certainly obscutrum per ob3curius, and threw the Court into a difsiculty which they m%ist endeavour to surmount; but his Lordship said he was afraid the Court could net put any construction upon it which would not operate great injustice to some in the township. His Lordship only hoped a third statute would not become necessary, which might be worse than the first. (Laughter). His Lordship hoped that local Bills as well as Bills of a general character, would soon be subject to some competent examination before they were passed. HEUDSOi V. THE ROYAL BANK OF AU7STRALIA. This was a special case for the opinion of the Court, and whM:~ raised the question whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover the value of a promissory note made by the Royal Bank of Australia, and endorsed to the plaintiff by the Messrs. Boyd, formerly brokers to the bank. From the facts stated in the case it appeared that the bank was established in the year 1840, and that they had intrusted certain promissory notes, with coupons attached, to Messrs. Boyd, as their brokers, with instructions to sell the same for the benefit of the bank. In the year 1S48 the bank be. came insolvent and stoppe4 payment, auld from that time they ceased to employ the Messrs. Boyd as their brokers, but allowed the note in question to remain in their hands. On the 26th of February 1855, Mark Boyd endorsed the note in question to the plaintiff for the sum of 1,000. in violation of his duty to the bank, but it was found that the plaintiff was not privy to his breach of duty, buthad becorme the bond fide holder of the note. The question was, whether the l intiff was entitled to recover the amount from the bank in this action. Mr. PZTEESDOREF (with whom was Mr. Hance), on, the part of the plaintiff, contended that, as the plaintiff had purchased the note from the company's brokers, who were authorized to sell it without any limitation as to time, he was entitled to recover the amount. There was nothing in the case to show that Boyd's authority had ever been revoked, and mere insolvency would not destroy it. Lord CAMPBELL said, the Boyds were not brokers to the bank down to tho year 1855. The bank had become insolvent in 1850, and they had not employed them as brokers since that time. Mr. Justice ERLE said the question was whether the authority had been revoked. If the note wexe a chattel, the mere stoppaqe of payvment would not interfere with the rigt t ssl o aooa.fdepurchaser. Mr. R. Clarke, who (with Mr. C Pollock) appeared for the defendant, was not called upon. Lord CA3rPBELL, said that e.t the trial of this action it was contended that the Boyds were creditors of the bank, and if that had been the case Mark Boyd would have had a right of action on the note, and he could have transferred that rieht to the plaintiff. But, on the other hand, it was contenaed that the bank were creditors of the Boyds, and that the Boyds had no lien upon the note, but that they were wrong doers in makine away with it. It was accord. ingly referred to an arbitrator to take the account, and he had found that at the time when the note was endersed to the plaintiff a balance was due from the Boyds to the bank. The Court were then called upon to give their opinion whether, undor the other circumstances stated, the plaintiff vms entitled to maintain the action. Those circumstances were, that from the year 1841 to 1848 the Messrs. Boyd had been employed by the bank as their brokers, but that in the year 1848 the bank stopped payment, and had had no trasctions with Mark Boyd from that time. Itappeared that the bank, after haviag stopped payment, had got into Chanoery under the Windig-up Act, and an order was made In 1852 for the Boyds to pay 30,4501. to the recsiver a ppointed by the Court of Chancere as a debt duefrom the Boyds to the bank. It was therefore clear that, as between the bank and the Messrs. Boydh the Bosyds had no authority. They had ceased to be employed ers, though there was no formal revocation of their authorit. Could it thenPbe said that in 1855 they could sAvs adne ite Hi Lrdhipthugt tatifMark Boyd had had authority to dispose of the note for the benefit of the bank, and had misapplied the proceeds, that would not have affected the title of the plaintiff; but, as he had no such authority, the plaintiff had no title to the note, though he had paid I, 1 for it. The other JUerGFS expressed themselves to the same effect ; but Mr. Justice ERnE rested his judgment on the ground that the note in question was not a chattel, but an overdue negotiable instrument, and that a party who took such an rinstrument took it subject to all the equities in the hands of the party from whom he took it. If Boyd could not sue the plaintiff could not, so that the question was whether Boyd could maintain an action. Judgment for the defendants. NVARDEN V. STOW. This case came before the Court upon a demurrer to the declmation, and also upon a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant. The question raised was whether the defendant, who was high bailiff of the County Court at Liver. pool, had rendered himself liable to a penalty of 50., imposed by the 29th and 30th sections of the County Courts Act (the 9th and l0th of Victoria, chap. 95), for acting as attorney or agent for any party in any proceeding in a County Court. It appeared that certain proceedings had been taken in one of the superior courts under the Absconding Debtors Act (the 14th and 15th of Victoria, chap. 52), and the defendant had made an application under that Act to the judge of the County Court for the arrest of a debtor. The question now raised was whether the defendant in so doing, wa acting "in any proceeding in the sid Mr. Serjoant Atkinson, Mr. Sowler, and 'Mr. Brett were heard for the plaintiff - and Mr. Mllward for the defendant. Lord CAMPBELI. said the question was whether the case came within the 29th and 30th sections of tke County Courts Act (the 9th and 10th of Victoria, chap. 95), which rendered it penal for the high bailiff of the court to be directly or indirectly engaged as attorney or agent " in any proceeding in the said County Court." His Lordship said he was of opinion that this was not a proceeding in the County Court, for, though it was a proceeding in which a County Court judge was authorized to do an act, he did the act as a special commissioner appointed by Act of Parliament, and not as a County Court judge. All the statntes seemed to make it ancillary to the proceeding in the superior court from -which the capiu issued. It could not be said to be a proceeding in court, though done by a person in court ; it was a proceeding in camcerd, not in curid. The other JunGEs were of the same opinion. Lord CAwPB3n;u added that he thought the high bailift in this case had acted very improperly ; and he hoped that this instance would not be drawn into a precedent. Judgment for the defendant. BAIL COURT. (SiUaigs at Nisi Prius before Mr. Justicc COimETGE and Common Juries.) T1{ANT V. FIELD. Mr. Hawkins and mr. W. D. Seymour were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Overend and Mr. Raymond for the do. fen dan;. This was an action of replevin. It appeared that the plaintiff is managmg clerk to Messrs. Cooke and BeaI sol citors, Temple. anuary, 1856, he took the house, N9. 12 Princes-street, Cavendish-square, from the defendant, Wis Auus Field, at a rent of 10. a-year, payable quarterly. In JanuarY, 1857, a distress was put in for 481. 3. 9d., rent alleged to have accrued up to Christmas; the defendant tendered 37Z. 16s.,which ho contended was thearmount due, and as the tender was not accepted he sued out the replevin, the subject of the present action. The prinzipal question in dispute was whether the plaintiff was entitled to take credit for a sum of 121. 10s. 6d., which he alleged he had paid on account, and at the request of the defendant. The case as put forward by the evidence for the plaintiff was that in August, 1856, Miss Field was indebted U1. to a -Mr. Anstee, and that he had got a judgment against her for 121. 10s. 6d. debt and costs, She went to the plaintiff, and begged him to lend her the money, romising to allow it out of her next rent, and offering 2L for the convenience. He was not able to advance the entire amount, but by an arrangement witbh Mr. Oldknow, Mr. Anstee's attorney, he paid 51., and after. wards the balance, 71. 10s. 6d. Mr. Ov3NnD, for the defendant, submitted that the plaintiff should be nonsuited, as It appeared that the tender ad not been mado untl after the tress had been impoun'ded. His LoBDsuiP said he would reserve the point. The defendant and some other witnesses were then called. They stated that the defendant had never authorized the plaintiff to pay the money to Mr. Oldknow,but, on the contrary, had expressed her annoyance when told he had paid 51., and said she onlYiwanted to get her rent from him, and wiould pay her debts herBelf, His LORDsnsP having summed up. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff-damages, 4?. 4s.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. WESTMTVRn A - 9Q POWYS V. nAIM32DlTGPL P. 0- (SWiings in Barnco, Ea*er Term.) In this case Mr. Pnirsox showed cause against a rule ob. tained by Mr. Beasley, calling on two persons named Butler and Walton, executors of a person named Walton, deceased, a shareholder in the Royal British Bank, wha judment obtained against the public officer of the banL, wtibh was unsatisfied, should not issue against the estate and tglete of the deceaed shareholder unadministered. The Ieerned counsel contended that the 7th and 8th of Victoria, c. 113, I. 21, on which the connsel for the plaintiff relied, did not apply to executors. After the argument had proeeeded some time, The LORD CMnF JUSTICE sad this was a question which ought not to be decided on a motion. The question was one ofsHomuchlimportance that it ought to be put in a train to It was ultimatelydecidedthat the result of the maotion should depend on the reeult of a special case. RB THOMAS MOYRS V. THlE EASTERN COhUIXnS RAILWAY. Mr. T. JOnBa moved for arule calling on the defendants to show cause, under the Railway and Canal Companies Act, why an injunction should not issue restraining them frommaking a)preferential charge for the conveyanoe of coals along their railway in favour of Miessrs. Prior. The facts of the case were these. The applicant brought coas by sea to Colchester, and Messrs. Prior brought coals from the north by railway to Peterborough, and both parties sold their coals at the same places on the line, chiefly to the west of Colehester. There was, therefore, a competition between them, and the applicant complained that he was driven out of the market by Messrs. Prior being charged less carriage than he was. Rule nis granted. IIODGKWSOX V. TER.E In this case the argument was renewed to-day. On a former day Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Needham shlowed cause against a rule for a new trial on the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was against evidence. Mr. Edward James and Mr. Quain to-day were heard in support of the rule. The action was brought by the owners of the ship Sultean to recover damages from the owners of the ship Courier, arising from a collision in the Black Sea in the expedition from Var,na to Eupatoria. The Sultana and the Sir Robert Sale were in tow of the Hydaspes, and the Orient and the Courter in tow of the Fury. General orders had been given at night for the vessels in tow not to cast anchor, but to hang on by their hawsers if possible; but if circumstanoes arose rendering that necessary they were to do so. In the course of the night a breeze sprang up and freshened, 'which led to the Orient and Courier swinging round, and the Courier coming into collision with the Sultana did her considerable damage, to recover which this action was brought. Mfr. JAhlES now contended that the defendant was not liable, as he was acting under the orders of his superior officer, whom he was bound to obey, and that the breeze was not one which would justify, under the circumstances, coming to an anchor, considering the objects of the expedition and the necessity of avoiding delay. He also contended that the collision was an accident, and without fault in the defendants, and that the rule ought therefore to be made absolute. Mr. QUAIN, on the same side, submitted that the de. fendants were subject to martial law. Military law had been defined by the Duke of Wellington, in the sixth volume of his despatches, page 46, to be applicable only to the officers, so diers, and followers of the army, and was neither more nor less than the will of the commander of the army ; but martial law applied to civilians when in an enemy's country and at war. The distinction had been taken bv Sir James Macintosh in Parliament in discussing the case of Missionary Smnith, who was tried by court-martial at Demerara, and which was to be found reported in the 11th voL of Han-sard. Military law prevailed otih in time of peace and war, and depended on the Mutiny Acts and on the Articles of War. This was an order given by an officer when acting before the enemy at on war, and the defendant would have been liable to martial law if he had disobeyed it. He referred to " Forbes v. Cochrane" 12, Barn. and Cress. 464) as showing that the order nven justified the defendant, who had no right to disobey it, although it was evident it would lead to a collision. He also submitted that, although the circumstances as to the weather had changed, the captain had not altered the order, which therefore continued. The jury had decided this case like one of ordinary collision, without reference to the peculiar circumstances of it, and he therefore submitted that the verdiet was unsatisfactory, and that the rule should be made abeolute. Mr. Justice CRxSSWXLL said he was of opinion that the rule should be discharged. It heA been moved on two grounds-fist, on the ground of misdirection, and, secondly, on the ground of the verdict being against the evidence. As to one part of the direction of the Lord Chief Justice, that if at the time the damage was done the defendant was acting in obedience to the direct and positive | orders of his superior officer, then the action would not lie, it was not complained of, and he need not therefore discuss it. As tothe misdirection complained of, which was that the Chief Justice left the question to the jury whether the defendants were guilty of negligence in not letting go the anchor, he thought his Lordship was quite right. Tie evidence of Captain Chambers was, after the Admiral had given orders for the whole fleet to anchor, that he gave tho defendant orders to hang on by his hawsers; buthe said it would have been proper for the defendant to drop his anchor if circumstances arose which placed his own ship in danger, or made It dangerous to other ships not to be so. He construed that to mean that the captain, when he gave the orders, meant that the orders should be construed as given under the existing state of things, and not as positive orders to continue to opperate under all circumstances. That being tihe case, the direction of the learned judge was perfectly right. With reference to the verdict itself, the Lord Chief Justice was not dissatisfied with it, although it appeared to be the inclinaon of his opanlon that there were circumstances in the case whioh would have made him quite as well, if not better satisfied, had the verdict been lor the defendant. But the verdict had been found by a jury who very likely understood its circumstances a vast deal better than he could, and he saw no reason for disturbing that verdict, Mr. Justice CROWDER and Mr. Justice Wnix concurred in this opinion. The LORD C}rIEF Jus=Ecn smd he remained of the same 5opinion as at the trial, He should; however, have beenl better pleased had the verdict been for the defendant. But. a competent jury having given it their consideration, he could not say he was so far dissatisafed wvththe erdict as to say there ought to be a new trial. The Court ought to be most careful how it interfered with the province of, the Jur. The rle must thaefore be dischargel. sale iischargea. Mr. JA aked if their Lordships would allow kim to appeal. The COURT said, none of their Lordships entertained any doubt, and there would therefore be no appeaL (aituigs at Niri Prius, at Westminstcr, bforc M2r. Justicc WILUM,S and Comr,on uriaes.) I ATrHEwS AND AIrOTER V. PEULAN.W Mr. Berjeant Pigott and Mlr. Huddleston appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Joseph Browne for the defendant. Tins was an action brought to recover the amount of a bill of exchange. The defence was that Mr. Feuiilan had, been induced 1y an attorney named Chubb to sin it in order to induce the withdrawal of opposition to his (the defendant's) discharge under the Insolveut Act, and that it was therefore void as being a new security for an old debt, even in the hands of innocent holders, which the plaintiffs said they were. The 91st section of thelst and 2d Victori, c. 110, was reled on; but as the learned judge was of: opinion that there might be some doubt whether the plea raised the point sufficiently, be gave the defendant's counsel leave to amend, and left it to the jury to say whether or not the bill declared on was given as a new securit' for an old debt. They found that question in the affirmative, and the verdict was entered in such a manner as to enable the points of law in dispute to be argued in the full Cout. SQUIIE V. Pnzsr. Mr. HAwins. -who appeared for the plaintiff in this: case, stated in his opening speech that this was an action. of ejectment brought to recover possession of a small cot. tage in Fifteen-foot-lane, St. Pancz4, and that out of the title to this small tenement, rented at 4s. a-week, had arisen three bils in Chancery, three actions of replevin, one interpleader suit, two actions of ejectment, two summonses in the County Court, and one action for illegal distress. It appeared that the right to the possession of the property of which No. 2, % .tun-foot-ne, formed a par-t had long been in dispute, and that the defendant, wholhad been admitted as tenant by the plaintiff, had taken advan- tage of this fact to live rent free, not knowing, as his coUn-- Eel, Mr. Prentice, said, to whom he must Pay rent, and not ,knowing to whom he ought to give possession. Howver, on being sued in ejectment in the County Court some tim ago, at the suit of two gentlemen, named Beet and Smith respectively, he swore that he knew nothig of any landlord excepting the now plantiffl who had let him the house. It was clearthat Mr. Squire was only agent for the letting of the house in question, but Mr. Justice Williams said that the defendant could not at one time say that Mr. Squire was his landlord, and then, when it suited his nurpose so to do, repudiate his title, and directeda verdiei to be entered for the plaintiff. HOPLOit V. OARPMTTEp.. Mr. Holl was oounsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Prideaux appeared for the defendant. This was an action on an agreement of a somewhat curious nature, brought under the following circumstances -The defendant was the collector of the rents of a person named Adams, and, according to the plaintlUP case, agreed to pay over on the order of Adams out of his rents such sums as the plaintiff might advance toAdamsB fromtime to time. The first ordergiven wasfor20&.,butthe sumsborrowedbyAdams amounted in the whole to about 581.

COURT OF EXCHEQOAL TumsmAv. APzTT. 9R NW TRIA PAPER. SMITH V. vOSS (Siui.2o in Ton R-l th1is was an action Whereby the owner of a barge called the Joseph claimed compensation for damage alleged to have been sustained by his vessel through the negligent management of the steamer Ranger in the river Thmes. At the trial before the Chief Baron at Guildhall it appeared that the tide having not long begun to flow, at which time there is always a drain dowvn in the main stream though the tide Is slowly flowing along the shores, the Joseph was going up the river, and was croesing to the south shore, when the Banger came down on the same side and a colliaon ensued which caused damage to the forner to the extent of 14L 5s. On the part of the plaintiff it was ontended that the collision was entirely attributable to the mismanagement of the Ranger. On the part of the defendant the contention was that the Ranger was in that part of the river Iresoribed by the Act of Parliament regulating naviation m rivers-namely, the starboard side of the " fatr yy or midchannel," and that the barge ought to have kept on in the midstream, or at all events ought not to have been vvhere she was. To this it was replied that, on the proper construction of the Act, the Ranger ought to have kept within the limits of the "fair way," though on the starboard edge of it, and that she was clearly wrong in going out of those limits close to the shore ; but that, at all events, whatever was the definition of the term " fair way " as used in the Act, the Ranger had been negligently handled, and the defendant was therefore liable for the consequences of the collision. The Chief Baron directed the jury'that, according to the constraction of the Act in question, the steamer ought to keep on the right of, but within the limits of, the " fair way," and left it to them to say, on the evidence, which was contradictory2 first, whether she was in her right place and within the fair way- and, secondly, whether she was guilty of negligence, whather in or out of her properp aspre. scribedb the Act. The jury found thbt e steamer was out of tho limits of the fair w.y, and that she was guilty of negligence at all events, assessing the damlies at 14. s, whereupon this rule for a new trial was obhaiuod on the ground that the finding of the jury as to the position of the steamer and the question of negligence was contrary to the weight of evidence, and on the further ground that the Chief Baron had misdirected them as to the meaning of the statute. Mr. 0 '',u= now showed cause. As to the finding of the jury, the verdict was too small to admit of a new trial bein' rated, and as to the alleged misdirection, it was insis that the construction put on the langnage of the statute was quite corret Mr. 1L CA=rXsS and Mr. JosLTH BRoWN supported the rule for a new trial on the ground that the question 'was one of great iortance to al nuities concerned in the navigation of the Thames and other rivers, it being highly desiable that the real andproper construction of the Act, and the meaning to be attached to the term "fair channel," with reference to its extent, should be clearly defined and commonly understood. Mr. Baron BRAmwELL said he regretted that the rule mnust be discharged, reference being had to the first ground, because the damages wre under 201., as he was of opinion tbat the jury had arxived at an egregiously vrong finding both as to the extent of the "fair channel"and the ques. tion of negligence. In his opinion, the words "fair way, or midehaunel" of a navigable rivr, as used in the Act, meant so much of the surface of the strem as was commonly navigable, and ought not to be limited to any portion of that space in the middle of the river as had been found by the jury. Under the circumstances in which the steamer was placed, he thought she was in her right place, and had acted without negligence, but the jury had found otherwise, and the Court was bound by their finding. As to the second ground. there had not been any misdirection, the proper auestions in the case having been left to the jury, though they had come to an erroneous finding on them. The rest of the Court coneurring, the rule w.s discharged, with costs. Judgment accordingly.
PREROGATIVE COURT, TuEsDAY, ApRm 28. (UUL ANID CURL V. GAMBLE. V56jore .tw JOHN DODSON.) lUrs case again occupied the attention of the Court the whole of the day, and was not concluded at its rising.
COUrBT OF B.A ZVKRUPTCY, BasinghazU-streed, Ar 28. IN RE W_ TL rAXrMArn (BGfore Mr. Commisn6mrf FoxBLANoup- abJe bankrupt was a shi wner, &c., of Sootl-ad uh lane. This was the certia&te meeting. tt's-yard, Bush. Mr. LUFsXrrTI, for the assignees, said the bankrupt was a young man of great abilty, but for which it was difficult to conceive how he could have canried on so large a business and contracted so large an amount of debts, hebeing in 1852 behind the world to the extent of 3,2001. The baurk ruptcy took place in March, 1855, when the bankrupt's debts were upwards of 70,0001. The estate had paid 2s. in the pound. Asmun of 8,0001. was in hand, and a further sum of 10,0CO. or 15,0001. might be forthcoming. The bankrupt bad co-owners in many ships, from whom the latter sum was expected. The asaignees left the case in the hands of the Court without opposing the application for certificate. Mr. ILWRANoE, for the bankrupt, urged that his failure had been partly occasioned by that of Oliver, of Liverpool, who had failed for 1,000,OOOl. sterling. Oliver's case had not been administered in this court. The CommissiON?EP-If it had gone to a bankruptcy, how many bankruptcies would it have saved ! Mr. L.&wRiCE quite agreed with his Honour that Oliver's estate ought to have been thus administered. The bankrupt, he might observe, had had further losses by his clerk, who had forged his name to acceptances and kept his books in a most irregular manner. He trusted that the bankrupt might now receive a firstclass certificate. lis Hoou, said he, in common with every person found enormous difficulty in determining what was unavoidable loss and misfortune. He could only determine it by a series of negatives. One of these was where a man did not commence with sufficient eapital, so that he might have something to fall back upon. En this case there was an actual deficiency. The bankrupt's ship speculations had been carried on, to say the least, in a very eccentric mode. He (the commissioner) had found himself in a labyrinth, shares in the ships having been changed in so handy-dandy awray that it was didicult to ascertain who were the real owners, The bankrupt had been diligent since the bankruptcy; and, having regard to the time that his case bad been before the Court, he would now receive an immediate certificate of the second-class.

It apred that the insolvent keeps a beershop in High. street, hadwell, where mtusic and dancing were carried onto the annoyance of the neighbous, who complained tohte authorities. Mr. Newton, who is an a-istant tothe High Constable, sued the insolvent for permitting dancing sod singing in his unlicensed house, and obtained a verdict. The isolvent,who rehFued to discontinue the practicescormn plained of, was now in custody for the penalties and the The CmmF Co rssrox said he shorld give the insolvent no discharge until he gave up the objectionable praptices and entered into an nderkg not to renew them. In the meantime the bail could not be enlarged. The case was then adjourned, a> the insolvent remanded to prison. (Before Mr. Commioer Murury.) IN I1B VIVIA2e O'E3Elpz This ,nsolvent, a young m 23 years of age,. was opposed by Mr. Sargood and Mr. ¶eed; he was supported by lit, Denney. The insolvent came of age in 1855, since which tine he had d7seoed of a reversionaginterest he possessed in a smm of 9,750. contingent upon his surviving his mother. The amounthe had received was about 1,MO0I, the whole of which was now gone, and the insolvent owes S60., of which 144Z. is on account of liabilities chiefly for his father. M. Beyfus, a jeweller, was examined, and proved that in a few months he had supplied the insolvent with jewelry to the extent of 335Z. most of which appeared to have been edged immediately for comparatively small sums. In these transactions the Insolvent was accompanied by his fAther, who appeared, as the learned commissioner remarked, to have enoouraged and benefited by the young man's extravagance, instead of restraining it. Mesrs. Beyfuds debt had been paid, one of the partners having purchased a portion of the insolvent's reversion and deducted the debt from the amount of the purchase money. The cme was eventually adjourned for Mr. Lawrence, an attorney, who had received a oondderable sum of money, to furnish en accounkt and in the meantime the insolvent's sureties were enlarged.
POLICZ. MANIoN.nouSz.-Mr. Wi3liam Cockburn, a newspaper agent, appeared before the LORD MAYOR in answer to a gAmmons which charged him with havinn "unlawfully and maliciously written, printed, and publis ed a certin false and defamatory libeS of and concerning divers persons trading in the city under the firm and title of ' The Bank of London."' Mr. Bodkin (instructed by Messrs. Tyrrell, Paine, and Co., solicitors to the Bank of London) appeared for the prosecution. The defendant had no legal adviser present, and the hear. ing of the case was adjourned for half anhour for the purpose of enabling him to procure the attendance of his eoli. citor, who, however, didnot make his appearance during the proceedDgn M B n opening the case for the prosecution, sid, -M;ord Mayor, =I& pear before you instracted by the Ban=c of London to make an application that I think has been almost too long delyed. Thig is a question not affecting the puticu ar bank in question, but your Lordship and suequently a jury of the city of London wil have to say whether a system base and infamous in its naturo, carried on with pertinacity, the object of which is to extort money from gentlemen of character and station engaged in commercal enterprises of great moment, is longer to be tolerated in a cty like London. it is known to your Lordship that this case comes before yoa in consequence of the taking into custody by one of your officers of a lad-a child who was carrying about the city a piacard siilr to those now before you. The lad could only be considered an innocent instrument in the hands of other persons, of some of whom we have information which will induce me on this occasion to confine the evidence that I Ehall lay before you to just enough to justify the remand of the defendant, because we shall apply for process which wll secure the attendance here of another pereon against whom we have a charge of conspiracy to make, andthe charge then will be against that other person, whose name is-, and the defendant of wickediy conspiring, by the publication of false, defamatory, ndmalicious matters, to injure the credit of the Bank of London, on behalf of the directors of which I to-day appear. In order that you ma understand this matter, it is necessary that I should remind you of a case that occurred just before you came into office, wich = was inquired into by your predecessor, and in the course of which it appeared that this person named -caimed to have some right or title to the appelation of " the Bank of London ;" that he had first thought of the advisability of having a bank in London to be called " the Bank of London," without any knowledge at all that such an idea had occurred to any otber individuaL The gentlemen with whom this bank orignated formed and established it, and I am happy to say that it is enjoying the confidence of the pablic and doing an amount of business exceeding that of any other oint-stook bank during the time it has been in existence. has been established; but still if a system of this sort be permitted to go on uncontroled there is no establishment of a commercial kind, where credit is so important, that can hope to outlive attacks of this kind. The person whose name I have mentioned imagined that he had some claim upon the score of this pretended or real-I knowr not which -fancy of his own of caUinganinstitution "the Bank of london," and he brought an action against the directors of that bank upon the subject of this claim. That action entirely failed, the Court holding that he showed no right Or title whatever to maintain it. Ever since that time attacks have been made upon this bank, and a person was brought here who was considered by the directors to have been an agent or an instrument in the hands of those parties whence they originated, and he was committed by your Lordship's predecessor to the Central Criminal Court, where he was indicted for attempting to extort money by threatening to make disclosures supposed to be capable of affecting the credit of! this bank. upon the occasion of the trial coming on ai course of proceeding was taken of which, whether right or: wrong, I must take the sole responsibility, because the directors were no party to it; butx it appearing to me that i he wai a young man who had probably been misled by others, and le through his counsel expressing con'trition for i his misconduct, andpromislng not to repeat it, I did not! press the charge against him, and he was permitted to go at large. From the time of that trial these annoyances commenced and have continued, and at last they have arrived at such a pitch that it is neces sary to put a stop to them. In a publication called the JAin f-StockCompanies Journal afticles have appearedc from time to time with the sole object of attackhng and maligning this bank, and the persons who compose its direction. I will not trouble your Lordship by going through them, but will call your attention to one dated the 18th inst., which was being hawked about the city when this lad wa -aken into custody. It appears that there had been an article in a newspaper called the Atlag, observing upon this bank, and upon an application being made to the publisher of that paper by letter signed by Mi;r. Frith, a gentleman who holds the office of vice-chairman of the bank, that paper ve pro rl inserted his letter, and made a recantation and apology for the error that they had been led into in the observations they had made. On the same day aprred the Join-StOcCompanies' Journal) dated the 18th of April, and in which is this article - "An article which appeared In the last number of our excellent contemporary the I Atlas' ha,% it seem ralsed the bUe ot the Board of Directors of the Bank of London.

Alderman HUMtPEOMY.-How, Mr. Abbott, just state your complaint in the presence of Mr. White. Mr. Abbott.-I deposited about 301. with te Metropoli-- tain and General Benefit Beuiding Suoity, and upon apply.o Tig to withdraw that amount ibout 17 or 18 months ago, t was told by the seceutary that Icould have it insadfe fewweek sv ut have not yet been able to get it. Alderman HDirPMEMY.-Well, Mr. White, what is the reason you do nothpay Mr. Abbott's claim? Mr. White.-This is an enroled mutual socety, and the rules, which have been oertified by Mr. Tidd Pratt, do not. allOW Any one mnember to claim aUY advantage over the othemr. Thecomplainat twants his money out of histurn, atm st the rules, which have been made for the guidance o the members, and his claim cannot, therefore, be enter-. tabed untll there are funds to enable us to pay him off,! This society is in the same position as many others that have been suddenly called upon to repay money that had been advancedl by depositors. Alderman HuaHxP y._Wh&t is the total aot of subscriptions you have received in this society ? Mr. White.-About 20,0007., and during the last 12: months the society has paid out about 2,OODny to members, and Mr. Abbott will roeeve his maoney with interest inx due time, but there are 84 on the list before him, and that number will requig r about 1,1001. to pay off. Alderman Humes mo Y.-Whaht interest do you pay? for. Whit.-M8s. 6d.per cent., which is eqa to 5 per cent, for 13 months, instead of 12. Some of the clauns lately paid Off amount to 301 and 4001. eah. Alderman HuaspnpRy._(Jan the members withdraw when they aie ? Mr. Wbite.-Yes, Sir; but when so many members with. draw at one0 timae they mnust take the funds at hand as far as they will go, for it would not do for us to borrow money while the rate issohligh !Ly7or 8Pe cent. to repaym3oney Alerme^ x ew rez.Wl,M.Abt,if you have to wait for your principal you get your interest upon it.

Mr. Abbott'a claim is only about 33. including interest, and as soon as the rate of money is easier we shall borrow money nd pa him off. Alderman luT srrnuY.-What security have yoU to offer In borrowing money? Mr. White.-Mortwges and title deeds, held as seocurity for loans to members m the shape of advAnoed sha. - Alderman Huxrmn y. -I do not understand tbis balance-shoetyou have produoed. Perhaps you will explain the items. Htow much do you owe? Mr. White.-Oar liabilities on the 1st of January wore about 4,0001., and we have scurity by mortgage to the amount of 13.000b, representing the shares advanced. We only owe 4,00wu. to members, and 6,0004 to bankers, solici. tors, and others for loans Alderman HuImPxUY.-But do you prt with your mortgoee for these loauns, or what security do yo give, for bankers will not lend money without? t Mr. White.-We retin all the mortge deeds In our own pomeseson, xd our directors borrowr money upon their notes joint andweveral, for which they are all personlly responmdble. dfrm&n thuxp=rtyt-How many members have with. drawn from the society?

ILILITARY ANSD I'A7AL INTELLIGECRA The Duke of Cambridge having foanded a musical school At Kneller-ha%I %r the inatruction of boys belonging to the army in eausical education, the commanding officers at Chatham gaTrison have received direotions to select a ,certain nusmber of boys who hsve a knowledge of music frem their rspective corps, in order to their being trained for ba;dmasters in tho army. The authorities at the War Department have sanctioned the issue of 6d. per diem by the relieving officers of parishes to all those soldiers' wives, married with leave, who have 'been left behind on the occasion of their husbands embark. ing with their regiments for special service in China. The Winchester, 50, Captain T. Wilson (1854), late the .agship of Rear-Admiral Sir At. Seymour, MC.B., on the China station, is ordered to Chatham to strip and pay off. The Winchester is relieved by the Calcutta, 84, Captain W. K. Hall, C,B. A new steam screw corvette, of 22 guns snd of 1,470 tons burden, to be called the Orpheus, is ordered to be laid down at Chatham Dockyard, on the slip from which the Racoon, 22, w-as recently launched. She will be constructed from the designs of Captain Sir Baldwin Walker, I.C.B. A large 91-gan screw-steamer, to be called the Atlas, with engines of 1,000 horse-power, is also to be laid down at Chathain, with another vessel of equally large dimensions and tonnage. The Royal Sovereign, 131, was taken into the steam basin yesterday at Portsmouth to receive her steam machinery. The Assistance iron steam-troopship, Commander Heath, waent out of harbour at Portsmouth yesterday, to prove her engines, &c., prior to being reported ready for the reception of troops for China. The Armphitrite sailing corvette, 25, Captain Tatham, fitted out for the Coast Guard service, is ready for the adjustment of her compasses in Portsmouth harbour. The 7th Royal Fusileers, from Aldershott, arrived in Portsmouth garrison yesterday, and have taken up quarters in Colowort and Cambridge Barracks, and at Gosport. Her Majesty's ebip Transit, having the 90th Regiment on board for China, has put in at Corunna in " deep distress.' Our Portsmouth correspondent had a letter, from which the following is an extract, placed in his hands yesterday for publication:- " Hler Majesty's ship Transit, Corunna, April 19. "Hore we are! done up! Two days' 'Bay' weather sent us in here to be fresh rigged; you never saw a worse sea boat in your life,-crank, top-heavy, and ,everything that's had! We have everything we could wish in the way of provisions,-only two days' salt since we came on board;-but such *n old tub you never saw; the riggiDg never set up, or anything secured; we had hard work to keep the masts from going over the side; if she had pitched instead of rolling I am sure the foremast must have none <over the bows. We had to get tackles across the decks from side to side to brace the rigging in to save the spars; in fact, a greater tub to roil I never knew. She is topheavy. I am certain she will never weather the Cape, or she Zil deceive all on board. both soldiers and blue-jackets. dhe is a disgrace to the British Government, and more so to -be dockyard authorities. If she is lost I only hope my diary will be found to condemn those who sent her to sea. You -may think what she must be when I tei you for a truth that there are not one dozen men (troops) on board with a dry hammock, every seam in her deck letting in water. They had to give, or at least did give, extra grog. This letter is from an intelligent and responsible person on board the Transit, and is authenticated by name, rank, and every other essential establishing the credit of the writer. The freightsbip Margaret Elizabeth, laden with war stores for China, is shipping ammunition off Woolwich Arsenal; and the Eglintoun, having embarked a number of 24-pounder howitzers and pivot guns, with a quantity of reserve stores, has sailed for Greenhithe, whence she is to take her departure for Hongkong. The 2d Battalion Royal Military Train, under the command of Major Robertson, embarked yesterday on board the freightship Blenvie Castle, from Woolwich pier, and sailed at 4 p.m. for Hlongkong. The battalion consisted of Major Robertson, Captain Clark, Captain Inglefield, Lieutenant Blake, Ensign Bodkin, Adjutant Thompson, Paymaster James, Surgeon ArArthur, one quartermaster, and 262 non-commissioned officers and men. The gunboat Leven was again brought up to Woolwich yesterday for repairs from Greenhithe, whither she had proceeded a second time to be adjusted for China. It was found necessary to have her after stermpost strengthened. She is ordered to sail again to-day. The gunboat Slaney was ahso ordered back to Woolwich from Greenhithe yesterday, in order to enlarge her hammock nettings. Her Mlajesty's sorew steam storeship Hesper, freighted with stores for China, was removed from Woolwich basin yesterday, and is ordered to sail to-day for Greenhithe. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty :-Captain J. B. Wainwright, to the Loopard (commissioned); Jabez Soame, Master, to the Princess Charlotte; W. R. Dalton, Surgeon, to the Princess Charlotte; John Caldwell, Assistant-Surgeon, to the Princess Charlotte; CQ A. Lees, Acting-Assistant-Surgeon to the PetncessCharlotte. Mr. Cornelius T, A. NoddaU, Master, was yesterday appointed to the Agamemnon; and Lieutenant J. Dayman was also appointed Lieutenant in command of the Cyclops, both ships being commissioned for special service of laying down the Transatlantic cable.
TIHE GEAT WROUGTI-RBO GUY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your impression of yesterday I obsesve the 'official report of recent trials with the monster wroughtiron gun, by which it appears that the ranges are greater than those of the 68-2ounders (95 ewt.) smooth bore guns, and also greater in a slight degree than the Lancaster gun, up to five degrees of elevation. Can any of your scientific readers say whether it is possible to rifle the great gun on Whitworth's principle? - I also notice, although the report seams to be final by the Select Committee on Ordnance with respect to the trials by this gUD, that no mention is made of trials that were to take piace against the floating batteries. Can any 'of your readers, official or otherwise, give the world any information upnon that subject; and also, what is intended toedone with thee gun now that the trials are over !

TunF Gipa's REFuaE.-The eleventh annual meeting of the King Edward Ragged and Industrial Schools -and Eaatern Refuge was held yesterday evening at the institution at Albert-street, Spitalfelds; Mr. R. ilanbury, M.P., presided. Tbere was a full attendance of the friends of the stitution. The large number of dirty, ragged, uncared. for children existing in the neighbourhood 10 years since led to the formation of a ragged school, under the patronage of Lord Ashley, and its requirements ultimately resulted in the erection of a commodious and substantial edifice in a comparatively healthful situation, which is now known as Ba Thle King Ecdward Ragged and Industrial Schools and Eastern Refloge." The Chairman congratulated the society on the progress which ithad made. Since its establishment in 1846 no less than 6,565 had been inmates of the institution, and the present number of girls in the Refuge was 31; but that number admitted of being doubled by a very *mall outlay. The girls are trained in the various duties of the house, and are taught to wash, mend, and repair clothes, and to do the work of ironing and manglinp of linen. In addition to these domestic duties they are tanght straw bonnet and hat making. There is also a dayschool attached to the institution, the average sttend. annce at which is 360 children, while tbe Sunday school is ,wry fully attended the object of the establishment being o rain young girls in the various domestic offices, and at *h,e same fime to inculcate in their minds moral and-reli. gious rineipiw.q The chairman regretted that the pecuniary zesonms in the .1tands of the committee were not sufficient to disdmage the present outstanding liabilities of the society, while the ,'lmont to be received from the regular subscriptonsa during th e remainder of the year would barely meet the expenses of t,'te institution for a sii6 month. Under these circumstances the society made a sternous appal to all who were Wiling to save from rsin a degraded and outoat girl, who if right V trained snight becorhe a sorsCe and centre of blessing. \ 1esolutions were then passed in accordance with the viewb expresed b$he chair. )ang and the meeting broke up.
A TARARNTASgS JOURNEY TBROUGR EASTERN RU$SIA*. There are few Englishmen 'whose occupations allow them two or three months' holyday every summer that do not take advantage of the circumstance to gratify the national instinct for locomotion; and of these few are so unfortunate as to be withont some friends or relatives, of one sex or the other, to whom their wanderings, if only beyond the limits of the four seas, are an object of interest. To this circumstance, together with the desire which virgin souls, as yet anstained with printer's ink, always feel to see themselves reflected in type, must be ascribed the enormous quantity of books of travels in countries familiar to every educated man which floods the London market. Some of these, indeed, proceed from an inspiration of a very different kind. Professor Forbes's book on the Glacier, of St itzerlmtid, for instance, would be charming as a narrative, had its scientific value been as little as that of Mr. Albert Smith's exhibition. But the rmodel of these publications is, generally speaking, that which has been rendered popular by the witty cynicism of Eothen, or the irresistible animal spirits of the author of the Bubbles. It is not, however, every cook who, like the artiste of the French Marshal, can fturish good soup from a pair of shoes, a handful of nettles out of the moat, and the hoof of a dead horse; and readers who pay their money to learn what the author saw have a right to complain when they find themselves put off with the stupid jokes of a traveller whose humour is mere grotesqueness, and who unhappily thinks himself bound to be always humorous. These remarks are, however, only so far applicable to MIr. Spottiswoode's book as furnishing a clue to some of its blemishes, which would be otherwise unaccountable. He himself has both an observing eye and the advantage of having made a journey through an interesting and little-known locality. Hae galloped in his tarantasse from Moscow to Nishni Novgorod, arriving there before the crowds assembled for the fair had dispersed; descended the Volga by steam to Kasan; then, resuming his carriage, crossed the Ural chain to Ekaterinburg; skirted the mountains for some way on their eastern side, after paying a visit to the manufactories of Zlatouest; recrossed them and reached Orenburg-the base, as it may be considered, of any possible extension of Russian operations in the direction of Central Asia. From Orenburg he went to Samara, struck the Volga again a little above Saratoff, and pursued the same route which Pallas did on the right bank of the river to Astrachan, where he made a stay of ten days. On his return he left the Volga at Tzaritsin, where the river approaches near tbe Don, crossed the country of the Don Cossacks, and returned by Tamboff and Riazan to Moscow, accomplishing the whole of this distance in the interval between the 2d of September and the 27th of October. It is needless to say that a necessary condition of this feat was continuous travelling by night and day, sometimes without a break for ten days together ; but, except for a scientific traveller, this hot speed possesses little disadvantage in a country almost as monotonous as the ocean, and Mr. Spottiswoode wouild probably have seen nothing more than he did had he spent every night in bed, or its Russian substitute-a bench in the common room of tha posthouses. He had ample opportunity of observing the characteristic peculiarities of every region through which he passed, and even those of the inhabitants; for the circumstance of his being an Englishman seems to have procured him a levoe of the whole population wherever he changed horses. His sketchbook was always in his hand, and from it his volume has reaped the advantage of several interesting illustrations. He could well have afforded to abstain altogether from that rollicking style of writing of which, we suppose, the precedent of ordinary tourists induced him to consider the occasional employment essential to success. At Ekaterinburg and Ziatouest are the principal manufactories of machinery and small arms, and at the former the mint for the copper coinage. It is under the management of an Englishman, as is likewise the manufactory of machinery which immediately adjoins it; and the whole of the lathes and planes, &c., now employed there were brought from this country, with the exception of one or two pieces for which the imported articles furnished models. The manufactory of small firearms was likewise under the care of an Englishman, but he left at the beginning of the war, and was succeeded by a German. The machinery used in this particular instance is Belgian. If Mr. Spottiswoode's information be correct, it is in these two places that " the engines, and even the iron steamers themselves, for the navigation of the rivers and inland seas aild 1akes of Asiatic Rusia are made," He tells us that there are fiv6 IRU,t1a'l siatloha established along the line of the River Sir Daria (the Jaxartes of antiquity), to the south of the Sea of Aral. The lowest of theseFort Aralsk-is about40miles above the embouchure of the river. From this poiut a road leads along the right bank to Fort Peroffski, distant from the other nearly 300 miles as the crow flies, and by water 400. Up to this, the highest of the Russian settlements, the river has been navigated by steam; and it is reported to be navigable by small vessels nearly 600 miles higher, as far as the town of Kokand. Mr. Spottrswoode must excuse us for remaining extremely seeptical on the subject of this reputed steam navigation, until some explanation is given of the means by which the iron steamers, of which the parts were constructed in Zlatouest and Ekaterinburg, came to be put together on the shores of the sea of Aral. That the Sir is navigable by small boats all the way from Kokand to the Aral was asserted by Mouravieff, and may very possibly be the case. But the difficulty is to transport a steamer, even of the smallest size, in framework from the Caspian to the Aral sea and there launch it. Mr. Spottiswoode does not name his authority for what, if true, is a very important piece of informnation. He mentions it in the course of his description of Orenburg, and, for anything that appears to the contrary, it may very well be a mythical version, taking the shape of historical fact, of Russian aspirations after influence in Central Asia. Another circumstance related by him is less questionable and equally important. At the Military College at Orenburg the Oriental languages, Arabic, Persian, and Tatar, are now being substituted for French and German in the academical course. When shall we, with our colossal Indian possessions, begin to take the least thought for enabling those who have to maintain them to communicate with the native populations without the aid of an interpreter ? The road to Astrachan leaves the Volga at Saratoff, and does not strike it again till Kamystchin is reached. For nearly half-way it follows the course of the Blova, a stream which rums parallel to the Volga for nearly 150 miles. This part of his route is graphically described by our author, and, as it is characteristic of a very wide extent of colintry between latitude 450 and 510, we will give it in his owsn words: "I am not aware of any place more dreary or less worth a iornoy of 3,0c0 miles than the few stages to be traversed fore reaching Kamystehin. let any one conceive a traveller weaned wiith a journey of 10 days andnights. broken only by a stretch on a wooden bench at Saratoff, ariving On-a cold drizzly afternoon in this unhapry valley. The station and a back outhouse, some 50 yards behind, combining the flimsine8s of plank work with the rough unfinish of a log building, are the only habitations to be seen. Behind them is the nver, marked not by its stream of running water, but by a long line of willow shoots spring. iDg out of muddy stagnation, and looking likethe mos ghastly imitation of vegetable Srowl,t ofvihnzl sterer or decorator was ever gulty ." If, instead of a river, however muddy, we suppose a marsh of salt water, partiaUy dried up, and, in place of wilow shoots, a jungle of reeds, tenanted by wild hogs, antelopes, wild asses, and dog-geese, the above passage will serve for a description of the country over which, for the distance of at least 200 miles, the framework of any vessel intended to be launched on the Sea of Aral would have to be con. veyed from the nearest point to which, on the most favourable hypothesis, the aaterials couild be brought by water. After toiling for a day and a night through a waste of drift sand, -with a cold driving rain over head, the clouds suddenly breaking Bhowed our travellers the white towers of Astrachan over the waters of the Volga, there an immense net-work of channels extending for a breadth of 20 miles. Another branch of the river, which goes by the name of the Akhtuba, turns off to the et about 40 miles above, and these two main streams are the boundaries of the delta, the base of which is a hundred miles in length. On both aices of the river stretch out immnense steppes, consisting mainly of B sandy wastes and salt plains, covered with a white i sheet of brine, and extending to the foot of the CauCcasus on the S. W., and far intQ Central Asia on - A ofaran18c JOurney thtrouh Eastern bRitsio, iEn tA Auvf'4rA of 186 *by William Sp'ttiawogde, M.A., F.R4S. the Bast. Only here and there is there a stream-of sweet water to be found. Astrachan is an important depot of the Russian trade. Bales of cotton come hither from Persia, crockery from the German colonies on the Volga, iron from the mines of Siberia. Mr. Spottiswoode's description of these commodities collected in large open space!, and of the armies of carts drawn up in regiments to receive them, and in fact of all that he saw at Astrachan, is the best part of his book. It is a matter of regret that he gives us no information on the subject of the dockyard there, which, we suppose, he must have visited. Or are there some subjects upon which he has abstained from touching, out of delicacy to his hospitable entertainer, the great fish merchant, M Saposhnikoff, who is the purveyor of caviar to almost aU Russia, and whose interests might perhaps have been prejudiced by the revelation of State secrets ? If so, we must put up with the disappointment. as best we may, and be thankful for a volume which will be read with great interest, and wiU convey a great deal of information to nine-tenths of its readers.
IRELAND. (OoM OUR OWN COBP RnO2DZX. DUBLIN, TUESDAY MORNmG. The Dublin Protestant Association have 'hought proper to address a memorial to the Lord Lieutenant in reference to some disgraceful outrages which were perpetrated during the excitement of the late election for the city. Protestant poor schools attacked by Roman Catholic mobs; Protestant ladies pelted with stones; female teachers -with their " clothes torn off their backs ;" and such like brutalities, form the groundwork of the memorialist8' complaint to the Executive. But they do not stop here. They say, without the slightest reserve: "That your memorialists have observed with intense pain and indignation that for a series of years past faithfulness to Protestant principles has been looked upon as unworthy the countenance of the Executive authorities, espacially in Ireland, and that the profession of principles avowedly hostile to the British constitution has been a sure passport to Executive favour as though it were no longer politic ornecessary toupholdtLeprinciples which ourbeloved overeign is sworn to maintain, and by virtue of which alone she occapies the throne of these realms. That the consequence of such conduct on the part of the State authorities is now made manifest in a most painful manner. That crime, outrage, and l-wlessness have hecome normal in this country; the Executive authority seem to have become a dead letter2 while the lives of Protestants are placed in jeopardy, hb7.7erty of conscience outraged, the laws violated, and truth dishonoured." To this charge therewas obviously but one answer. It has been given by Lord Carlisle in such clear and intelligible terms that henceforth all the parties concernedwill understand the nature of the relationship which subsists between the Dablin Protestant Association and the Queen's Government in Ireland. Here is the Viceregal reply:- " Dublin Castle, April 17. Sir,-I am directed by the Lord-Lieutenant to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., and its enclosure,and I am desired by his Excellency to acquaint you, for the information of those gentlemen who framed the memorial which accompanied your communication, that heretofore, while his Excellency has never recognized their assumption of the title of the Dablin Protestant Association, still, out of deference to the personal respectability of the gentlemen who comsose that self-constituted body he has always bestowed such attention upon their representations as they appeared to him to call for. So in the present instance his Excellency will not fail to keep under his fixed consideration the transactions which are the immediate subject of complaint. "His Excellency now, however, feels fuither bound to state that as, for the first time within his recoDection, he has in the office which he holds under Her Majesty, in cammon with his predecessors and official colleagues, been exposed to remarks of a highly disrespectful and disparaging characterfromn an associaton of persons in no way authorized to address hir in any collective capacity, he must henceforth decline to receive any further addresses or communications from the body styling itself the Dablin Protestant association. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, " THoMr,As A LARCem, "W. R. Furlong, Esq., 83, Middle Abbey-street." By way of rejoinder to this stern rebuke the association, at their meeting last night, adopted the followYing address to the Lord-Lieutenant:- " My Lord,-We have received, with a great degree of surprise and regret, through Colonel Larcom, your Excellency's expressed determination not to receive in future any 'addresses or communications from the body styling itself the Dublin Protestant Association,' on the ground that your Excellency, - 'in common with your predecessors and official colleagues, has been exposed to remarks of a highly dis. respectful and disparaging character.' "M My Lord, in the most distinct and unequivocal manner we desire to repudiate the idea that we had the most distant intention of using language in the address which we did ourselves the honour to forward personally offensive either to your Excellency, your official colleagues, or your predecessors in the high office of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. But, in addressing your Excellency, we contemplated a policy wn=lh -we believed to be detrimental to the best interests of the united kingdom, especially of Ireland. We addressed your Excellency as loyal citizens and subjects of the British Crown in public meeting legaUy convened, as we have frequently addressed the Queen, the Houses of Lords and Commons, and various functionaries of the State; and, having an undoubted right, as citizens, to address your Excellency, as such we deemed it a matter of little moment whether we addressed your Excellency in our capacity of citizens or as members of the Dublin Protestant Aesociation; but our address and memorial, whether as citizens or as members of a loyal and constitutional association, have always been adopted in public meetings lawfully ssembled. " Assu:ug your Excellency that, as loyalsubjects, nay, as Christian m.en, we desire to treat ' the Powers that bW' with the f ullest respect, and to render to them the fullest hononr, and that we addressed yonr Excellency honestly and with every desire to be personally respectful to you in the high offlce which your Excellency holds under Her Most Gracious MIajesty in this country, wve have the honour to remain your Excellency's most obedient se-vants, the mnembers of the Dublin Protestant Association. " Signed on behalf of and by desire of the meeting, ! " April 27, 1857, 83, Middle Abbey-street : " lra SADLESRISMr. The Tipperary Bank swindle continues to share the attention of the courts of law and equity, scarcely a day passing over without it-s affairs beingr brought under the notice of the public. In the Master's-office yesterday an application was made to allow Mr. Jerningham, of London, to institute proceedings at laws against Georgie M'DoweDl, the official manager of the Tipperary Bank, to recover a sum of 5,3001. In the year 1848 13,0001, were lodged in the Tipperary Bank in the joint names of John Sadleir and -Jorningham, and it appears that John Sadleir was improperly allowed, without the knowledge or authority of Mr. Jerninghain, to drawr upon his own checks not less than o,3001. Mr. Jerningham now sought to recover the sum from the Tipperary Baink by an action at law against the official manager. The motion was granted. In the Court of Queen's Bench, on the same day, counsel a pplied on behalf of t.he public officer of the N!aewcastle bank to make absolute the conditional order for a scir-e faciuis against Mr. Hone, in order to recover against him ajudgmnent had against Mr. M'Do well, the official manager of the Tipperary Bank. The Newcastle Bank having obtained by consent a verdict for 25,0001, against the official manager of the Tipperary Bank got a conditional order for liberty to issue a sclrc against Mr. Hone, as being a shareholder in the latter concern, and therefore liable to the creditors of the concern. Afidavits, had been filed as cause against the making absolute of the conditional order, on the ground that Mr. Hone was not a shareholder, but that was a question to be tried by a jury, and could not be disposed of upon affidavit. Mr. Hone said he had ceased to be a member of the bank from 1847, and that he had disposed of his shares and got rid of his liability, but the transfer, it was insisted by the plaintiff, was a mere collusive proceeding made for a nominal consideration, and after the aUleged transfer Mr. Hone had continued up to 1854 to receive the dividends on those shares. The conditional order was made absolute for the issuing of a scirefacias againt Mr. Hone, and a like order vas made against Mr. Vincent Scully. A SUMMO0NS TO ROMSE.

THE MOONS. hefol llowing is the ofieBhreport ofJudge Drim. mond, of the Supree {hurt of the territory of titab, to the Ho. Jezeremaia S. Black, Attorney General of the United States, VWashington City; I "My dear Sir,-As I lave concluded to resign the office of Justice of the Supreme Court of the territory of Utah, which position I accepted in A.D. 1854, under the Administration of President Pierce, I deem it due to the publio to give some of the reasons why I do so. In the first place, Brigham Young, the Governor of Utah territory, is the acknowledged head of the 'Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,' commonly caUed 'Mornons,' and as suchhead the Mormons look to him, andto himalone, for the law by which they are to be governed; therefore no law of Congress is by them considered binding in any manner. *'2. Iknow that there is a 9ecret oath-bound organizstion among all the male members of the church to acknowledge no law save the law of the " HolyPriesthood," which comes to thse people through Brigham Young, direct from God, he, Young, bemg the vicegerent of God hnd the prophetic sue. cessor of Joseph Smith,'who was the founder of this blind and treasonable organization. " 3. I am fuly aware that therais a set of men set apart by special order of the church to take both the lives and property of persons who may question the authority of the church (the names of whom Ia will promptly make known at a future time). " 4. That the records, papers, &c., of the Supreme Court have been destroyed by order of the church with direct knowledge and approbation of Governor B. Young, and the Federal officers grossly insulted for presuming to raise a single question about the treasonable act. '- 5. That the Federal officers of the territory are const%ntly insulted, harassed, aud annoyed by the Mormons, and for those insults there is no redress " 6. That the Federal officers are daily compelled to hear tbe form of the American government traduced, the chief executives of the nation, both living and dead, slandered and abused from the masseo, as well as from all the leading members of the church, in the most vulgar, loathsome, and wicked manner that the evil passions of man can possibly conceive. "Again-That after Moroni Green had been convicted in the District Court before my colleague, Judge Kinney, of I assault with intent to commit murder, and atterwards, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the judgment being affirmed ando the said 'Green sentenced to the penitentiary, Brigham Young gave a full pardon to the said Green before he reached the penitentiary; also, that the said Governor Young pardoned a man named Baker, -who had been tried and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in the penitentiary for the murder of a dumb boy named Whitehouse, the proof showing one of the most aggravated cases of murder that I ever knew being tried; and, to insult the Court and Government officers, this man Young took this pardoned criminal with him in proper person to church on the next Sabbath after his conviction, Baker in the meantime having received a fall pardon from Governor Brigham Yoang. Theee two men were Mormons. " On the other hand, I charge the Mormons, and Governor Young in particular, with imprisoning five or six young men from Mlissouri and Iowa, who are now in the penitentiary of Utah, without these men having violated any criminal law in America, but they were anti-Mormons, poor uneducated young men, on their way to California; but because they emigrated from Illinois, Iowa, or Missouri, and passed by Gzeat Salt Lake Cit,y, they were indicted by a Zrolte Coart, and most brutally and inhumazly dealt ,with, in addition to being summarily incarcerated in the saintly prison of the territory of Utah. I also charge Governor YoUng with constantly interfering with the Federal Courts, dhectmg the grand jury whom to indict and vhom not, and atter the judge's charge to the grand juriesasto their duties that this man Young invariably has some member of the grand jury advised in advance as to his will in relation to their labours, and that his charge thus given is the only cbarge known, obeyed, or received by all the grand juries of the Federal courts of Utah territory. ". gain, Sir, after a careful and mature investigation, I have been compelled to come to the conlusion, heartrending and sickening as it may be, that Captain John W. Gunnisoa and his party of eight others were murdered by the Indians in 1853, under the order, advice, and direction of the Mormons; that my illustrious and distinguished predecessor, Hon. Leonidas Shaver, came to his death by drinkuing poisonous liquors, given him under the order of the leading n en of the Mormon church in Great Sal. Like City; that the late Secretary of the territory, A. W. Babbitt, Was njurdered on the plains by a band of Moruion marauders, under the particular and special order of Brsham Young, Reber C. mball, and J. AL Grant, and not by the Indians, as reported by the Mormons themselves, aud that they were s^ent from Salt Lake City for that purpose, and that only; and as members of the Danite band they were bound to do the will of Brigham Young, as the bead of the church, or forfeit their lives. " These reasons, withmany others that I might give, which would be too heartrending to insert in this cornmunication, have induced me to resign the office of Justice of the Territory of Utah, and again return to my adopted State of nllinois. My reason, Sir, for making the communication thus public is, that the democratic party, with which I have always strictly acted, is the party now in power, and therefore is the party that should now be held responsible for the treasonable and disgraceful state of affairs that now exists in Utah Territory. I could, Sir, if necessary, refer to a cloud of witnesses to attest the reasons I have given, and the charges, bold as they are, against those deepots who rule with an iron hand their hundred thousand souls in Utah, and their two hundred thousand souls out of that notable territory, but shaU not do so for the reason that the lives of such gentlemen as I should designate in Utah and in California would not be safe for a single day. "In eoncluslon, Sir, I have to say that ih my career as Justice of the Supreme Court of Utah territory I have the consolation of knowing that I did my duty ; that neither threats nor intimidations drove me from that path. Upon the other hand, I am pained to say that I accomplished little good while there* that the judiciary is only treated as a farce, the only rule of lawv by which the infatuated followers of this curious people will be governed is the law of the church, and that emanates from Governor Brigham Young, and him alone. "I do believe that if there were a man put in office as governor of that territory who is not a member of the church (Mormon), and were supported with a sufficient mUitary laid, much good would result from such a course; but, as the territory is now governed, it is noonday madness and folly to attempt to administer the law in that territory. The officers are insulted, harassed, and murdered for doing their duty, and not recognizing Brigham Young as the only law-giver and law-maker on earth. Of this every man can bear incontestable evidence who bas been willing to accept an appointment in Utah, and I assure you, Sir, that no man would bo willing to risk his life and property in that territory after once trying the sad emperiment. "4 With au ardent desire that the present Administration will give due and timely aid to the officers that may be so unfortuiate as to accept situations in that territory, and that the withering curse which rests upon this nation by i irtue of the peculiar and heartrending institutions of the territory of 'Utah may be speedily removed, to the honour and credit of our happy country, "I now remain your obedient servant, "W. W. DRUMMIOND. " March 30.". "Justice of Utah Territory." (From the New York Express.) Mormonism hitherto has been popularly associated only with the grosser immoralities, and looked upon by most people in the States as a revolting plague-spot upon civilized Eociety, which would die out in the course of time by virtue, so to speak. of its own rottenness. We are now beginning, however, to get glimpses of the " ism" from a different stand-point, and the addition to our knowledge of its nature and disposition thus gained is certainly not of a character to realize the expectation that the pestilence is going to abate without a severe struggle, sooner or later, with the " powers that be." As long as the Mormons broke the moral law simply by themselves away off on the borders of Salt Lake, the best thing that could be done was to let them alone; but, as they are now making a serious demonstration against the civil law, and exhibiting a spirit of open hostility towards the constitution and the Union, it becomes a graver question than ever what is to be done with them. The letter of Judge Druminond to the Attorney-General of the IUnited States, resigning his office as Justice of the Supreme Court in Utah, for the reason that he was not [permitted tooexerdise its functions without imperilUing his lif, how t-t heFederal Government is utterly powverless; end, such being the case, it devolves upon that Federal Government to assert its authority. kNo time should be lcst in a business of this kind. If there is to be organized resistance to the execution of the lAws, that organization will gain strength by tho lapse of time. The case is a clear one. We are for " toleration" in the most liberal sense of the word; but is it toleration to countenance a system which, if practised in any one of the States of this Union, would send its disciples to the State prison or pVnitentiary for bigamy, adultery, or disorderly conduct ? We are for respeting al religions, but what religion is there In a creed whioh is constantly at war with good morals and those fundamental principles of Christianity upon which the institutions of the Republic itself m ay be said to depend? As soon as the Federal Government is satisfied of the truth of Judge Drumimond's statement, that it is out of the question for an United States' judge to sit in Utah, steps shoald at once be taken to enforce its authority. The appearance of a few regiments of United States' Dragoons, in all human probability, would exerc:c ea salutary influnce upon Brigham and the elders. It is high time that those gentlemen were given to understand that, though encamped in the heart of Utah, Utah is United States' territory, over which the Federal Congress has jurisdiction, and to resist that jurisdictiou in the manner so set forth by Judge Drum aond is a species of Higher Law-ism, which must draw down upon their heads certain retribution.

RAILWA Y INTBLLIGErAE, EAST INDIAN. The half-yearly meetirg of this company was held yastor. day at the offices, Alderman's-walk, New Broad-street, lAr. R4 W. Crawford, ILP., in the chair. The report, an abstract of which appeared In The Tima of Saturday, was taken s read. The CBnAnmAN aid that the report contained a full and complete statement of their affairs up to the 31st of Decem. berlast. There were sabjects of disappointment and congratulation thereir. The subjects of congratulation were the great and satisfactory progress made in the revenue of the Jine open for traffic, and also as to the progreas of the works on the portion of their line in the Upper Provinoes, Di8ap. pointment had arisen in consequence of the slow progress made in the constraction of the southern division of the railway, but the whole conlid be easily expuained. They were not eDgaged onworks extending over 1,100 miles, of whichl 21l miles were open for traffic; and for the remaining length of Lt 00 miles. he might say the spade was in the gtound for tbo whole distance. In the lower portion of the line some progress had been made in the works by their own stnffi They found it necessary to divide one contract, 134 miles in length, which had been let to Messr. Nelaon and Co., into three contractg, 67 miles of which were beinia constructed by the company's officers, 33 r miles by Mess Nelson, and the remaining 331 miles by lessrs. Smith and Atkinson. The works on this portion were now makiog progress. It was necessary to state that this portion of the line passed through the centre of the Santal district, where the insurrection had taken place. The result had been more prejludicial to their interests than they had reason to expect. Not only was the progress of the works suspended, bnt they were put in a worse state, and they had to make good certain portions. Their agents had placed the works in the hands of the compauy's officers, who were proceeding in a manner which was satisfactory to the directors and the Government. Another thinz that bad retarded the works and caused great disappointment was the difficulty of getting the bricks made for the erection of the bridges intended to croFs two rivers. For these works they required 35,t0,000 bricks, and in order to obtain sufficient bricks of the best quality they would have to make double that number. Those difficulties were now being gradually got over, and they were taking measures for making bricks in sufficient quantities, so that nounnecessary delay should take plce on that account. Theirprogress had also,been interfered with in consequence of differences between themselves and the contractors, which were lluded to at the neral meeting of the company in November last. Thoy hadThad great difficulty in finding suitable contractors, but happily those difficalties had been got over. A large claim had been made againstthe company by one of the con- tractors. It was brought before the Sapreme Court, who' referred it to arbitration, and instead of the enormous damages claimed by the contractors, a verdict of 20 o01. was given in favour of the company. That showed that there was no fault on the part of the company. Some of the works met with were of a heavy description, and difficulties not origmally contemplated had been met with as they proceeded, but, generally speaking, all those difficulties had been overcome. On other portions of the line the works were proceeding satisfactorily, and there wras every probability of the line between Alahabad and Delhi being completed in two years from the present time. They had recently received some useful information fromtheir engineer, which stated that the cost of that portion of the line would probably not exceed 7,5u01. per mile. The traffic on the portion of the line in operation was very satisfactory. The number of third-class passengers conveyed over it for the half-year ending the 31st of Dlecember last was 432,605, and the traffic continued to increase both in goods and passengers. From a letter they had received that morning it appeared that the trafflc on the line for the last fortnight prior to the date of the letter in Indis amounted to 7,0001., and, taking the working expenses at 41 per cent., they would perceive that the net receipts woo d leave a considerable profit over the 5 per cent. guaranteed on that portion of the hne. The statement of the traific receipts for the half-year ending the olst of December last ha just been received, from which it appeared tbat 53,8S had been received and,21,894L, or 40 68 per cent., expended, leaving a profit of 31,9291. available for payment into the treasury of the East India Company towards the sum advanced for interest on capitaL The expenditure did not include the proportional cost of the establishment in London, but, lookng to the extent of the works in hand, it would form but a small proportion of the expenses chargeable to revenue. The result of the four half-years' traffic showed that the profits from workin^ the line amounted to 90,9701, and would go in diminution of the advances of interest paid by the East India Company to the railway company under the gaantee. Taking the present rate of traffic, there was no question that they were making considerably more than the guaranteed rate of interest. The total cost of the experimental line wou'd be about 1,731,000u, but from this mnut be dedacted the extra cost of a double line atBurdwan and of the terminal station at liowrah, near Calcutta, which was intended to accommodate the traffic of 1,100 miles. Assuming the expenses of the experimental line proper at 1,200,o0ool, taking the traffic at an average of 7,0001. per fortni1hr for the year, and allowing 41 per cent. for working expenses, there would remain a considerable refit over tne 5 percent arantee. It was a very satisactorymatter that theyhad been enabled to send out 65,000 tons of permanent way and other heavy materials for the railway during last year at a very mcderate cost. At ll events, the works would not be delayed for want of the necessary materials. With regard to the proposed Jubbulpore contract for 2e0 miles, wvhich they had assentedto take, the directors had heard nothing. The fact was, they were most anxious t complete the main line of 1,100 miles before undertakig any other contract. At the suggestion of the Government their engineers were examining the river Sutlei as to the most eligible place for crossing it. The bridge would form part of the extension of their line from Delhi to Labore, 500 miles in length. He thought they would haie enough to do in carrying out those reat lines, and trusted they would be able to abatain from further extensions until the great work they Bad in hand was completed. He then alluded to the loss of Sir R. 3M Stephenson's services in consequence of ill health, and explained that after most carefal selection the directors had appointed Mr. Palmer to fiU tbe office lately occupied by Sir R. ML Stephenson. With regard to theconsolidation of the shares intostock, thedirectors had takenthe matter into their own hands, and, having individually examined every entry in the books, compared them with the documents, and signed the latter, he was happy to say there was not one single error committed by the officers of the company. He concluded by moving the adoption of the report and statement of accounts. MIr. BAXNDALE seconded the motion. A long discussion ensued in respect to a balance of interest, amounting to 7,5801., which it was contended by a shareholder should have appeared in the present account, but it was stated that the amount was included in the present balance of interest, amounting to 13,4141., in favour of the company. In reply to observations by Mr. FRINsxLYN, it was stated by the C ASRA&B that, rathough the balance belonging to them in the treasury of the East India Company appeared very large at the time of making up the accounts, the East Inda Company were paying large sttms for them in India, amounting to about 120,1001, a-month. After they had paid up the 1,500,0001, they would not have a year's money in hand. Mr. MOnoAN contended that the sooner they could finish the lines they had in hand the better it would be for the shareholders, as the interest would amount to a l1e sum against them. The CH sirIAN said they were activoly engaged in constructing 1 000 miles of railway, and it was not from any act of the hoard that they were so extensively engaged at present. The works had been forced upon them by L)rd Dalhousie and the Indian Government, and it was not reasonable to ask them to do more until those in hand were completed. In reply to questions from Dr. BEA=iE, Mr. Ds.A, and other shareholders, it was stated that the bridge over the river Soane would be 4,200 feet in length, and be a lattice tubular bridge, consisting of 28 spans, at an elevation of 45 feet above the bed of the river. Tho abutments and Piers would be of stone and brick. The superstructure wou d bh of iron, and cost 74,000 on beard ship in the Thames. It was designed by Mr. George Rendel, C.E. They found it impossible to properly regulate the trains on the line in consequence of the Government interference As an instance, a special train was required, and permission was not obtained to run it until 48 hours after the time it waswanted. Some of the works on the R.jnmahal line were of a very difficult character, aS two or three considerable rivers would have to be crossed. About 21 miles in length of the line would be opened in December next. The report was unanimously adopted, and the retiring directors, Messrs. J. Beaumont, J. D. De Vitre, and A. Nairne, were unanimously re-elected, as was also Mr. C. Farquharson, the retiring auditor. On the motion for confirming the provisional election of Mr. P. W. Simons as an auditor, Mr. DPAN and Mr, FRASKILYS protested against the principle of directors a ppointing auditors, and after An explanation from the Ohairman, and a statement that in future such matters should be left in the hands of the shareholders, Mr. Simons was elected. A vote of thanks to the Chairman concluded the prooceedings. DENMRARA. The annual meeting of this company was held yesterday at Liverpool, Mr. T. F. Bennett in the chiir. Mr. T. Jones, the secretary, read the report, which stated that the gross traffic receipts for the half-year ending the 1st of March, 1857, amounted to 9,2981., being 61L less than at the corresponding period of 1856. About the beginning of December considerable irregularities occurred in the working of the line. On the 9th of February Mr. Manifold formally renounced his worling agreement, but he continues his superintendence until new arrantements are made. Early in January his Exoellency P. B. Wodehouse, the Governor of British Guiana, laid a memorandum before the Court of Policy, explaining his views of the position of the railway. In this document the importance of the line to the colony is fully reoognized, the estates are called upon to submit to higher tolls, and a supply of funds in some shape is proposed, on condition of a more effective service. New members of the Demerara committee are recommended for election, under the aseertained approval of his Excellency; and a power of attorney has already reached the colony, by which the fullest authority was delegated to Mr. Jamnes Stuart, of George Town, to make the best arrangements he could for the asistance of the colonial Government.

CITY COURT OF SEWEPW % Yesterday a Court was held in the Guildhall, Deputy Peacock in the chair. Dr. Lrrn3Y, the Medical Ofricer of Health, presente(* his returns as to the condition of 93 houses which had besn inspected during the weel;, and he submitted a list of 5S places which required the orders of the Court for the;sanitary improvement in various particulars. He also sub. mitted a number of certificates of overcrowding in cam where 20 men, 31 women, and 22 children were lodged in 12 rooms without due regard to health or decency. The mortality tables for the week indicate a satisfactory ste of the public health. There were 67 deaths duringthe week, of which 30 were among children of less than five Fears of age, and 11 among old persons of 60 and upwards; 30 deaths were occasioned by diseases of the respirato organs, as-bronchitis, It; phthisis, 8; whoopiugcough, 7; and pneumonib, 4 There were but 2 deaths from fever, 2 from scarlet fever, and 1 from measles; and there were no, deaths from smalpox. The other deaths were occasioned chiefly by disease of a chronic character, excepting four deaths caused by drowuing. Upor. the motion of Mr. Annr, that portion of the repuort, which referrd to the overerowing of houses was referred to the Committee for General Purposes. THE GAUGING OF THE CITY SEWERS. Mr. Haywood (the engineer to the Commission) laid before the Court an elaborate set of tables of the gauging of the city sewvers, showing the discharges at every minute ana hour of the day from each of the sewvers. The Statemeute, which are of great public importance, were unanimously ordered to he printed, and copies were ordered to be sent to every member of the C7ourt, and to the Metropolitan The COUnT was for some time occupied in deciding uport appeals aaiust the rating of premises in the city; anud ater having heard the reports of the inspectors as to the condition of the streets, and the performance of the duties of the dust contractors, adjourned.
Thx DnmLOxATIC S vicxE oF THE UNrm STAlES. -It seems to bc generally taken for granted that Mr. Buchanan and his Cabinet are now busily engaged uporc the diplomatic appointments and disappointments incident to the establishment of a new Adminstration. The new President has shown no indiscreet haste in remodelling this department of the public Bervice, and we are disposed to attribute the unusual deliberation of his proceedings to a distinct perception by him of the fact that in no depart- ,ent of the public service are changes sO elaborate and so thorough required by the interests and the honour of tha-. country as in this. The diplomatic corps of the United States are charged with the representation of the national character as well as with the care of the national interests., The Minister of a grest Power is held to be * typeof the highest ci lization and the most cultivated intellect of the country which commissions him. He is invested witha dignity not his own, and clothed with a prcage which only the most extraordinary personal qualities conic' secure for any other ofiial, solely and dmply in consideration of the fact that he stands for his nation before the people among whom he lives. These circumstsneen should determine the qualities of character indispensable to the post. The qualities of intellet required for the due dischsrge of its functions must be decided by the number and the importance of the interests involved in our intercourse with each particular nationof the world; and though it can never be excusable in us to send a positive dunce or a, recognized bore into the bosom of a friendly people, there is certainly no reasonforourinsisting that every Envoy,Charg6, or Secretary of Legation appointed by the President shall be a man of transcendent genius But it is our right to demand of the Government that no blackguard or bully, no low and vulgar politician, no' persou of repulsive manners or filthy habits, no reprobate or drunkard, or sw;indler, shall be sent to flaunt the shame of his vices or the odium of bis. behaviour in the face of a foreign nation. And therefore it is our duty to protest, with all the force of a united public opinion, against the system upon which our diplomatie appointments have heretofore been made; and to denounce the application of the "spoils" theory, whereits applicatiom so nearly concerns the fair fame of the nation, the comfort of every American who travels abroad, and the self-respect of every citizen who feels that in the reputation of his. country his own is involved. It is an unplesant fact, but; a fact unquestionable as it is unpleasant, that the character and conduct of our diplomatic representatives in Eurone han, of late years done very much more to damn our natioial reputation and to destroy the consideration in which ouar institutions were formerly held even by their enemies thsas their activity has done to advance our material interests orprotect our public rights. There is hardly a Court in Europe at which some pet partisan of a past Administration has not left his memory tobe a hissing and a reproach to all of us. In one city the American traveUer descends at a hotel from which a Plenipotentiary of the Republic was expelled for drunklen insolence to the female servants of the establishment. In another he is regaled with the sicht of diplomatic autographs in the form of "due-bi[W' draw on brother envoys ard never discharged. In a third, he is invited to inspect the records of a club fronm which an American Charg6 was formally expeled forhis indecent vililication of the Sovereign and the societyof the nation to which he was accredited. Everye were he hears of gaucheries and inelegancies, of awk. wardnesaes and improprieties lending confirmation to thelying legends of Irs. Troliope, when he is so fortunate &a% to escape the battery of darker and heavier charges. It is time that an end *hould be put to these things. It is-times that our diplomatic service should cease to be regarded an. the sure resource of Administrations driven to despairbji hungry retainers and insatiable supporters. ir. Buchanan can do nothing which will more redound to his creditor more warmly enlist the goodwill of all decent and respectable citizens in his behalf than to reorganize our diplomatic system in accordance with the true priniples by which it should be governed. His own experience must havyamply satisfied him that, while the personal traits of good. breeding and of character are moet essential to thet success of a public negotiator engaged in transactions of thea highest importance, they are of more value to the resident; at a Court of the econd or third rank than any othex qualities whatever. Nor, we trust, will Mr. Bucham. forgetz in selecting the foreign representatives of theAmerican people, that a due regard is always to be had ta. the public opinion and the political ethics of the differenu. nations to whom our envoys are to be accredited. Ai hiinister whose social philosophy and practice would causes him to be received with open arms by the socety of SL Petersburg, might very jpossibly fnd himself eonfide at London within tbe narrow circle ot strictly offcial ourtesiear and be wholly cut of from the thousnd opportunities of usefulness which are afforded to ans agent b- the oordial sympathy with him of the people among whonx he is to act in his convictions and his views of life.-Nczm* York Z'mf THE RrmicrioNS AT WooL5wicH DOcKARD.-A4 already stted in ThAe Times, a mneeting was held at Wool. wich on Friday last, the object of which was to assist the nmen who have been disebarled frort the Government estai blishnients kt Woolwich, and wh6 have eonsquently been re-. duced to great distress.
