DRATH OF EARL FITZHARDINGE. We have to roDrd ths day the death of the Right Hon. William Fitrdinge Berkeley, EArl Fitzhardinge, which event took place at BerkeleyCastle, Glooestershire, on Saturday night, In the 71st year of lbt ege. Hs Lordship was the eldast son of Frederick Augustus. fifth EArl of Berkeley, by Mary, daughter of fr. William Cole, of Gloester, and was borm iMountletreet, Grosvenorsquare, on the 26th of December, 1786. Thoso of our readers who are familiar with the peerage and its history will scarcely need to be reminded by us that the validity of a mrriage which was alleged to have been oontraoted so early as the 30th of Ma3h, 1785, between the father and mother of the nobleman recently deceased became the smubect of a Parliamentary inquiry after the death of the filth Earl of Berkeley, and tlbat the remut of a cloee investigation of ihe entire circum. stanoes connected with the ease was a resolutioa passed by the Uoue of Lords withott a dissentient voice that this alleged marriage of 1785 was not proven, and that oonsequently the late Lord Fitzhardinge had no claim or right to the arldo of Berksley. Thegeneral reader, however, wil thank ug for setting before him the following brief outline of the facte of the " Grext Berkeley Case," which created so great a sensation some five-and-forty years ago. The Late Earl in the autumn of 1784,or the commencement of 1785, on a visit to Glae*ter from his castle at Berkeley, ws struck with the chaiam of Miss Mary Cole, the daughter of a butcher in that city, nd took her to live with him at Berkeley as his wife. As time went on the lady bore him four sons, and common reputation affirmed that up to that date no legal marriage had been solemnized between the parties, although the lady yled berself Countess of Berkeley. Thelady whose character was thus' impugned alwaysa _rted, on behalf of her ldegt son and his three next brothers, that although the public solemnization of the union between herself and the Earl did not take place until May 16, 1796, she had been Privately married more than 10 years previously, and the same fact was affirmed under oath in his Lordship'3 last will and testament. To establish this statement an entry In the parish register of Berkeley was produced, which entry, it was alleged, had been made, for eertaln reaons Of pleasure and oonvenience on the p7rt of the late Earl of Berkeley, on a leaf that had been pasted down in the volume for many years, until it should be wantedL The question as to the genuine or spurious cha racter of this document came before the House of Lords only after the death of the late EarL The clergyman who ws sid to have made the entry was then dead, and his 'Widow declared thit she did not believe it to be in her deceased husband's handwriting. A brother of the Countess of Berkeley, however, deposed that he was present as a witness at the marriage of 1785. The evidence of Lady Berkeley, it is stated, was contrsdicted by that of her mothor, who afterwards married hr. Glossop, of Osbourcby, in Lincolnshire, and who, though born in a humble sphere of life, lived to see one of her daughters a Countess, one married to ageneral offioer, and the third the wife of a nephew of the late Sir Frincis Baring, Bart. Such being the case, on the death of the fifth Earl, his eldest son, who then bore the courtesy title of Lord Dursley, and ws member for Glocestershire, presented a petition claimimng tso be calledtothe House of Lords as sixth Earl of Berkeley. The subject of his legitimacy had been mooted during his father's lifetime, and an Inquiry had been actually oommenced, bit it was abandoned on finding that no legal ques. tion could arise until after the old Earl's death, when, as we have already stated, the evidence bronght forward in favour of the legtimacy of the eldest son was not judged by the House of Lords to be sufficlent to establish the claim. In consequence of this decidson, Lord Daraley was obliged to drop that title, and he retired from public life for many years, and was known only as Colonel Berkeley, of the South Glooesterahire Militia. Thes estates at Berkeley, st Canford in Middlesex, and elsewhere, were not entailed upon the title, and hence he remained in. undisputed po6sson of Berkeley Cstle, which was bequeathed to hima by his father, and which gave him very extensive influence as a landed proprietor in the county of Glooester, in which, as also at Bristol, and in the cItyof Glocester, he ably supported the Liberal interest against the powerful inauenoo of the Beaufort family. He maintained his ground in this position extremely well, and Ws one of the gentlemen chosen by Earl Grey for elevation to the peerage at the coronation of King William IV., when he Wa created Baron Segrave. The operation of the Reform Act, instead of limiting his territorial influence, went fAr towards doubling it, sa he was in general able to secure one scat at least for the Liberal party in East as well as in West Glocesters ie In 1841 he was elevated to the earldom of Fitzhrding, jut previous to the departure of the Melbourne Ministry from office. The earldom of Berkeley was adjudged by the decision of the House of Lords in 1811 to the Hon. Thomas Morton Fitzhardinge Berkeley, fifth son of the late Earl, but the first chUd born after the marriage of 1796; he has never, ho-ever, amumed the title, as to do so would be to cast a reflection on his mother's memory. He is unmarried, and In the event of his dying without issue the earldom of Berkely Will pas to his next brother, the Hon. George Charles Grantley Fitzhardlnge Berkeley, formerly M.P. for West Glocesteshire, who married a daughter of the late Mr. Paul Benflield, and has two sons, the eldest of whom WMll eventalUysucoeed to the title and, it is believed, to the estates The Earl's youngast brother, Mr. Craven Berkeley, many years P. for Cheltenham, died in 1855. Earl Fitzhardlnge never married, and consequently his eLrldom and the barony of Segrave have become extinct. His next brother is the Right Hon. Sir Maurice Frederick Fitzhardinge Berkeley, KECBR, and late M.P. for the city of Glocester; the third brother is Augustus, and the fourth ix Mr. Francis Henry Fitzhardinge Berkeley, who has sat for Bristol sinoe 1837, and is weeU knowvn for his annual advocacy of the ballot and for his opposition to the Sunday Beer Bill of 1854.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit me to observe that some error must have cropt into the calcuation given in 2l7c Time.s of this day's date for oonverting hectohtres into quarters, and the price of a hectolitre of wheat in francs into that of a quarter in shillinga. If it bo truo that 35 quarters are equal to 100 hectoltres, It cannot at the same time be trme that 17 francs per hectolitre is the same thing as 37s. per quarter, except on the supposition that 20s., or 11. sterring, is equal in value to 261 francs, or more exactly to 26-25405 francs which iS certainly m?uch beyond the true value, that, as I am informed by a friend learned in currency matters, being only 25225, or under 25j francs. The matter is of sufficiont practical importaece to call for some further explanation of the grounds of the rules given in your widely-diffused journal, or otherwise for the insertion of the necessary corroetions if, as I presume, some error has crept into the statemnent. I hap en, unfortunatAly, to be without a card at hand to authenticate my claim to be heardon a matter of arithmetic, but beg to subscribe myself, Sir, your very obedient servant.

EXTENSrvF SNrmoGLixG OF TOBACCO.-A case was tried some days ago before two of the magistrates of Leith as justices, in which James Morrisou, carpenter ; David Murray, steward; David Burrell, boatswain; Johi Noble, James Brodie, and John Lorimer, seamen; and John Shaw, fireman, all of the steamship Holyrood, were prosecuted at the instance of Mr. Nanson, collector of Customs In Leith, for smuggling tobacco. Mr. Beverly, a solicitor of Customs from London, conducted the prosecution; and Mr. P. S. Beveridge, Leith, appeared for the defence. Mr. Beverly stated that on the morning of the 2d inst., after the steamship Holyrood had arrived in Leith Docks from Rotterdam, certain officers of Customs had found 26 packages of foreign manufactrared tobacco, weighing 281b., liable to seizre, concealed In the forecastle of said ship, where the defenders lived, and that they were found on hoard. He then directed the attention of the Court to the terms of the Act of I.5, and submitted that if he were able to prove that the defenders were on board of the Holyrood when the seizure was made he should be entitled to a conviction. Mr. R. P. Testrail, a tide-surveyor, and Mr. Mason, a Custom-house boatman, deponed to finding the tohacco and the defenders on board of the Holyrood. The case was then delayed till Thursday last to hear some evidence for the defence. Mr. Beveridge then adduced several witnesses, one of whom deponed that the tobacco belonged to a seaman who had absconded. The maglstrates were, however, of opinion that the charge under the Act was proved. Bailie Lindsay, ia giving judgment, said it would, no doubt, be a groat hardship in some cases to apprehend and fine every ono found on board of a ship where goods liable to seizure were found; but in the present instauce there was no great hardship, for only those who had been eating and sleeping in the forecastle (the place where the tobacco was found) were before them, and it had come out In evidence that some of the defendants had a guilty knowledge of the tobacco being concealed on board. He fined them 1001. each, with costs, and failing payment to be imprisoned during lHer Majesty's pleasure. On this case being concluded William Dickson, another of the crew, was placed at the bar on the same charge, and on being found guilty he was also faned 1001. with costs. None of the fines being paid the parties were sent to prison. The Holyrood was placed under embargo, and it was not till the owners had placed a deposit in the hands of the collector of Customs that the vessel was allowed to leave the dock, ArmsnLttAs CoPPgV MaINE.-The arrival of each mail from South Australia brings fresh evidence of the great extent of her mineral deVosits by the discovery of copper mines. Another is mentioned on the uresent occasion, but at the same time it is stated that hands suited for this description of labour are inadequate to the demand, and it is recommended that the superRuous mining population of Cornwall and Devon should emigrate to these localities, where high wages would be given, and the mineral resources be effectually developed. The copper mines of South Australia are well known throughout the world for their great yield and richness, yet many, such as Port Lincoln and others, remain unproductive, in a commercial sense, from the difficulty of obtaining miners.-Mining Journal, Oct. 10,

The market for goods and yars closes havily this wee4k The advance in diacounie, the mostetary eri s Ameri, and the stoppage of several more dik houses in thi town (making * total of nearly 20 within a very ort e ot time), hlave all tended to induce caution among buyrs Th~ orders in hand prevent any undne pressre on the market, and prices are firm, writh a demnacd for Germasy and China, which has led to some fair pucases of yandurlng the. week.

The concluding quarterly meetingof iron and coal msster4 was held at Dudley this evening. Prioes wrere fully min tamned, but only a moderate aount of busines was tras acted. The state of the moueyrmarket produced a aome4 what depressing effect, but the numubers of order. on hand at the principal works imparted stadness to the. market. At Stonrbridge meeti.ng, keld yesterday, the eoad and ironstone trades wrere represented to be bris. A rise of ls. per ton in best descriptions of Cannock Chase prodnc. tions has taken place, and they consequently now hsnd ai; 13as 64. per ton and are in great deenird. At thls assembly of mineral proprietors the present disturbance ef the earrys ing trade as the subject, Ms at Birmingham, f'mueh tiscus sion. The mining and irontrae of this nedghbourhoo4 are more especially interested in tho stability of chares for conveyance, and it h~ believed that the preeentcontest between the Grand Junction Csnal, Great Western, anti London and North-Western Railwy C'ompanies, whnile it has at p resent caused a great reduction in carnagee chargesF wil uliaey prove of gread disadv antge to the neigh. bourhood. The cause of fae flpeeent compettion Isnot fully explained. It appears at fot a oonsderal2,l tine past an agreement h1 exshted betweren the tw railway companies for the carriage of allClse of goods at equal rates, sbject to a roie o a givden timue to be given by either p arty wising t abanon its condition,. A fewr week, ago the Cana Company offered to carry at greatly reduoed rates betwreen Birmingham, Liverpool, and London, and n;pon this thq Great Western, mithout g1vn the stiputlated aotice, prow ceeded to follow the exampli, and reducedl -i rates of charge to tlst extent of 25 per cent, After this eoorsEt had been adopted, it is said the London and Norte Western were compelled, in self-defence, to aLnnUounce corresponding reduction, and carry at proBtiem atneK. Ta te various trades of the disrict the dispute is. howrever already felt to be of serious importanu The Iron and' coal masters cannot ensure the permanency of the present reduced scale; while, on the other hand, the merchants of London and lirerpool requr contracts Such a stateJ of thinge cafnnot lastlong without poing disadvantageous to aiparties, and great hopes are enter. taUe that existing disagreements will speedily be arngedj 31eetings of the chairmen of the several companIes hve recently been held, but hitherto they have proved fruitless. If the contest should continue dividends aleay small wil There has been no important alteration Intheocopper market during the week. Purchases continue to be effecte with greater ease, and generall the principal foundries are moderately wrell off for orders. Some of the manuIacturerS. who rely upon prompt payment of uartetrly accounts eonsm p lain of the manner in which paymesnts were postponed at ~olverhampton and Walsall until the ensuing wreek-i but those due at Birmnnhm on Thursday were-t understood to have been discharged writh customnary regnlarity. The tin wae manufacturers are busy, but chiefly upon foreign orders, and railway carriage building for the Est Indies Is remarkably brik. The chief establIshments of tbe neighbourhood engaged in this branch of business r workig ' over time." The reports maLde with reBard to the general stte of tbrd vared trades of the towrn and district at the krte meeting were partially, If not entirely,satisfactory. The nail trade, both cast and wrought, is more than uwsully active. The chief masters in the neighbourhood of Dudley state they never vwere busier, but the make is chiefly fo exportation. The cooper tube and wAire manufactures continue animated, wvhile lor best descriptions of electro-plate there is a mode. rately good demPand. At Redditch the needle trade is. scarcely so brisk as it was a few weeks ago, but still no cons. plaints are made of want of orders or temployment. although many BirminghrAm houses wecre largely con. cerned in the North A mericanA trade, we are please to stae that fewv, if any, of them wrere sufferersA to sany lmportant extent by the late failuresi annouAnced in the last advices received from New York. Of late exportationa of hardware to the United States have been somewhbat limited, sand trade conducted upon sounder principles and a safer footing than formerly. Losse by Tran,atlantlc failures have consequently been proportonately fewer and less important tharn some years zago, when BirminghAm was a greAt sufferer by American speculations. NOTTINGHAM, O0T 10. The pest week has been an exceedingly quiet one MAs respects the lace trade, in most departments of which there is very little doing; there is a trinle more doing in slkI goods the lace trade generally, however, is decidedly dutll the October fair has also interfered to some extent with budi ness. There is no alIteraAtion so report in silk, which is sell ing at a very high price; cotton also continues dear, botlr wAhich causes make manuf^acturers cautious In the produc. tion of goods. Material Is stUI selling at very high prices. LEICESTEB, OcrA. 10. The hosiery trde is in a satisfactory state, there being OUA the wshole fully as much doing a^s iS usual at this time of the year, and A further improvement will take place, when the mild weather is over, {n the demaznd for wcellen goods. Botba town And 'country houses are, howvever, now transacting a fair amount of business. There hs very little stock on hand on account of the high price of material, and sanything like an improved demand wrill cause considerable activity. There Ss no altersation to report in wools, aAnd yvarns maintain the prices of last week. LEEDS, OcrA. 10. Quietness has characterized the wroollen trade this wveek, hut aboout the same amount of business has been done in the Cloth-hails and at the warehouses as last. The unfavourable monetary Accounts froum the United Stes, the absence of anything of a positively cheering nature from Ind4a sand the tightness of the money-market at home, are all rircum. stances combining to prevent briskness in the stsaple textile maAnufacture of this district. Stocks, hoswaver, do but slightly increase, Sas manufacturer. are gradually putting a check up~on their rate of production. Notwithstanding these rather unfavourable circmstances, and that, as a Consequence, some of the needy clothiers mak-e some abatement in their prices to effect sales, prices in general are firm, and those of the raw materials (wool, dyawares, and oil), if not advancing, are certainly very stiff. The markets in both Cloth-halls to-day were fully as good as those of last Saturday, and in the White-hall more business ws done, there being a good demand for " roughs " " marbles," and other heavy goods. Wools, as already intimated, are very firm, and, as there appears to bea faling off in the arrivals from Australia, high terms are expected to be realised at the colonial sales4 to take place in London early in November. The flax silk, Iron, and buildlng trades in this town and. neighbourhood are all enjoying a fair amount of prosperity. BRADFORD, Ocr. 10. Three things have exercused an unfavourabie influenco upon the Bradford trade during the present week. First, perhaps, may be placed the continued financinl trouble in the UJnited States, mentioned in the advlces received by the two latest American malls. The steps taken by the Bank of England, in raising the rate of discount to 6 per cent., and the uncertainty which exists with regard to the suppression of the insurrection in India, have also tended tc depress the tone of our market, which has been unusually quiet in all its departments. As to wrools, the demand has been exceedin6gl limited, spinners purchasing only for urgent and immediaterequiremente. and pricesmaybe quoted a little easier. In nails and brokes there appears to have been about an average business doing, and as the supplr of hcse descriptions of wool is not abundant the pnces for some time current have been maintained. The business transacted in wrorsted yarns, whetherjfor export or ho ne consumption, has been very small in extent, but there is no change to be noted in prices. Some of the spinners coin plain that they are doing a profitless, and even a losing trade. At the same time it Isobvious that this may be a lesser evil than wvould ensue if they allowed their machinery to stand idle. Cotton yarns are stationary, except for some low numbers, which have rather advanced in price, owing to the increased cost of the rawr material at Liver. pooL. In the market for goods there is no changet to report as regards prices, but the trade may be said to have shared in the dulaess which pervades the other departments. At this season of the year manufactulrers, under ordinary circumstances, ought to be busy for America, but there are no orders giinug out for that quarter of thc globe These facts go to show that ths worsted trade is not by any means insa satisfactory condition; but our report would not be complete without mention being made of one or twvo matters which belong to the bright side of the account. The stocks of both yarns and goods at present held are very small, therefore; the business doing, though contracted and larnguid, is perfectly legitimate inx the commercial sense of the w ord; and, by reason of this low;ness of stocks, and the absence of anything like pushing In the market, the adverse circumstances above referred to have not ha,d that depressing effect w;hich otherwise they ngmie possibly have produced. Again, it is remembere& that there have been good barvests this year on the oonti. nent of Europe and in the l-nited States as well as in our own country, while, on some former occasions, as, for instance, in 1837, trade has bad to sustain the pressure and inconvenience arising from unfavourable harvests, a ighh rate of discount, and monetary perturbations combined.. These facts and considerations have helped to support our market at the present juncture and to prevent any feel. ing of alarm. aHALIFAX, Ocr. 10. The worsted trade is rather flat. The demand for piece goods has rather diminished, and there are few orders in and, The monetary panic in America is preventing the full extent of business for that country usual at this season of the year. There is also a slackness in the sale for the, home-market, hut an improvement 13 looked for with the change of the season. Yarns are tbut in moderate request, and spinners complain that remunerative prices axre dlHcult. to obtain, vool being so high. In such circumstances there has been less done in wvool, hut there is no fall in price to note, NORWICH, Ocr. 10. It is stated that there has been a good trade here in textile fabrics for the approaching winter. A new fabric called " bicuna" is also reported to have been produced, and some fancy goods have been made for the Australianand Anerican markets. The Norfolk Chronilc, 1which speaks in sanguine terms of the state of the manufacturing trade of Norwich generally, announces that an establishment has been opened tor the manufacture of a silk fabric generally used ia making gloves. DUBIN~ Ocr 10. The Customs' receipts for the week to Thu %y, ore 1tl. inst., inclusive, were 15,5231., against 19,4221. lost week.

ZiONBY-MARKBTar.d CITYINTBLLIGBNC.B. _-- --- l Saturday Evening. Mae unfavourable return from the Bank and the turThe fall in the American Exchanges, telegraphed Irom Liverpool on the arrival of the Persia, caused the funds to open this morning at a fresh decline of a quarter per cent., the market continuing to give way till near the termination of business. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 89i to *, 'Vere first quoted 89k to 3. At this they remained for some time, but the excessive demand for money -observable in the discount-market, coupled with renewed withdrawals of gold, strengthened the im3jresslon that on Thursday next, or even previou4ly, {he Bank may find it necessary to go up to 6i or 7 per cent., and sales were pressed till the price was -8. Ultimately there was a Blight reaction, and the final operations were at 89 to j for money, and :89# to i for the 10th of November. India Stock elosed at 208 to 210; India Bonds, 25s. to 20s. ds*ount; and Exchequer-bills, 8s. to 4s. discount. At the Bank of England the demand for discounts -wa excessive, the applications being more numerous than on any day for months past. This rush -a doubtless not to provide for immediate wants -ao much as to anticipate the possibility of another upward movement on Monday, or, at all eventz, on 2hursday. The foreign stock-market has been rather active, and in most casee a decline has taken place. Bra'zillan Five per Cents. were negotiated at 101; and for the account, 99 ; ditto, 1829 and 1839, 99; Danish Three per Cents., 83k; Mexican, for the -count, 20k and i; Russian Five per Cents., 108i; Bardinian, for the account, 90; Spanish , 40i and @; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 25a, j, and i; Turklsh Six per Cents. for the account, 90, 90g -891, and 90{); Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., CA4I; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98. The closing quotation of the French Three yer Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening wa3 6(7f. 25c. for both money and account, showing a fall of nearly three-eighths per cent. At Hamburg the rate of discount has advanced to 71. About 60,0001. of gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation. Abs the shippers of bullion -were among the principal sellers of Consols it is inferred that they are preparing to act on a still larger scale, and that they consider another immediate *aovemeuii in the rate of discount inevitable. The adviceas from America telegraphed to London lhis morning are not worse than had been anticipated. They show, however, that, although an early tebound may be possibie, the mischief and confusion tasve now been too extensive not to require the lapee of many months for their consequencea to ibe retrieved. The charge for discount at New 'York is stil apparently at the rate of from 24 lo 36 per cent. per annum on the choicest paper, and from 60 to 70 per cent. for the secondary descriptions. At such a time the prices of all descriptions of stocks must, oE -course, be little more than nominal; but it appears that, although a further heavy reduction had taken .place, there was a partial recovery before the departure of the mail. On the whole ih seems the distrust had certainly not increased, -and a few days' pause under such circumstances ,usually promises a turn. The New York banks had fairly maintained their stock of specie, although they had been caUed upon for large supplies to support -their correspondents in the interior, and another -arrival from California was nearly due. As the stock during the previous week had received an ad-dition of 270,0001., and all thatimight arrive would be retained, it is evident that nothing short of some new and wholly unexpected development of misamanagement or fraud or a sudden return of lunatic -terror was likely to carry the crisis beyond its present point. The suspension of the Baltimore banks, -which was arranged by a concerted resolution, is de-scribed to have had the anticipated effect of relieving the prevailing apprehensions in that city ana throughout Maryland, and it is now announced that -un arrangement equally general has been adopted at 3?hiladelphia, and that theState.hegislature of Pennaylvania has been convened to legalize such future measures as may by requisite. It is the duty of all 'banks at periods of panic, unless they can see that 'they are in a position to meet every claim, to -suspend at once, and not to allow the selfish people who are the promoters of the calamity to run off with assets which should be equally divided among all Eenee the present resolution must be regarded with ,satisfaction, although it Is plain, from the way In 'which the New Y ork banks have stood their ground, that the necessity for it could have resulted only from gross mismanagement. It will, moreover, have the good effect of causing specie to flow to those points where suspension has been avoided, such as New York, New Orleans, &c. The impression that 5 year must elapse before the Philadelphia and Baltimore banks will be in a condition ,to resume specie payments will most likely be fully borne out, .7out unless the Legislatures of their respective States should commit the fault of allowing them to extend their issues during the period of inconvertibility this circumstance need not necessarily create much lows or annoyance. With regard to the further effect which the panic will produce in Europe it is9 still to be hoped that the enorinous inconvenience experienced from our nonreceipt of remittances will not be aggravated by -bullion in large sums being absolutely withdrawn from us. The Vanderbilt, which was shortly to arrive, was expected to bring 100,0001., it is presumed from France ; but the uncertainties as to the duration of the panic are likely to limit any speculative shipments from England. Although it appears -that some produce bills have been isold at New York as low as 100, the profit on their purchase was -doubtleas considered not more than sufficient to cover the risk of their being drawn upon weak houses that might be found to be compromised by the failure of American correspondents. The chief danger of gold being sent hence to New York is on account of the large additional pur-chases of securities which our capitalists have ibeen tempted to make at present prices. A fall equal to about 4s. Gd. per quarter in wheat had led to the despatch of several cargoes of wheat and Biour to Liverpool, but the unfavourable rate of ex. thange operated greatly to counteract the apparent advantage to be realized from the prices in our marRets. As respects the commercial losses to be :Zustained on this side, very heavy amounts are believed to have fallen on Lyons and Paris. Here it is feared Manchester, Bradford, and Glasgow will suffer considerably. From the latter place a serious case of embarrassment is reported this afternoon, The Marseilles letters mention the failure of the mercantile firm of M. Nessim Solal, but it is not thought to be of a very extensive character. The following is an abstract of the railway inteigence of the week :-At a meeting of the Irish South-Eastern the dividend declared was in accordance with the report. The report of the Waterford and Tramore shows a balance against revenue for the past half-year of 4231. The directors have been authorized to i3sue guaranteed *6 per cent. shares to the amount of 10,0001. At a special meeting of the Dublin and Drogheda the resolution previously passedtopurchase stock to the 'extent of 30,0001. in the Dundalk and Enniskillen -was approved. The proposal of the Board to pay eoff the debt due to the Belfast Junction for the pur-chase of the Wavan Branch was also adopted, and the sum of 170,0001. required for these purposes was ordered to be raised on 5 per cent. preference shares. The report of the Norwegian Trunk shows steady inerease in the traffic. The contemplated 4xtensdon of the railway system in Norway (in aid of which sumt have already been voted by the Storthing) is expected to prove highly advanta- geous to this line by givng access to productive and populous districts. The works upon the Welland Railway, which, running along the side of the canal of the same name, is intended to connect Lake Erie with Lake Ontario, are making rapid progress, and may be finished by the opening of the navigation. At a rmeeting of the Great Western of Canada the dividend declared was at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. The falling off in the traflic was attributed to the reaction caused by the partial discontinuance of the outlay of English capital in Canada, and alwo to the general depression of business in America. The arrangement for the repayment of the Government loan of 700,0001. was approved, as also the loan of 150,0001. on mortgage, to complete the Detroit and Milwaukee line. It was stated that 99j per cent. of the stock and the entire of the bonds are held in England. At a special meeting of the London and North-Western resolutions were passed approving the agreement for the conversion of the Shropshire Union Stock, amounting to about 1,500,0001., into stock of the above company, of taking shares to the extent of 105.0001. in the Buxton Extension capital of the Stockport, Disley, and Whaleybridge, of the purchase of the Euston and Victoria Hotels, and of assenting to the new contract entered into by the Postmaster-General for the conveyance of the mails between London and Kingatown. By the new contract two communications will be made daily to and from the above-named places, the time occupied being 11 hours The Bradford, Wakefield, and Leeds Railway has been opened for traffic; it is the shortest line between thoee towns, and will accommodate an extensive coal district. The statement of the directors of the Belgian Eastern Junction sets forth that a large reduction has been made in the -working expenses, and that time has been obtained from the principal creditors of the company, which will allow of the development of the traffic and enable them to pay the interest on all their debts. The coal traffic can be looked to as capable of sudden expansion, and it is intended to form a new company en commandite for the purpose of dealing in coal. The first turf has been cut upon the projected Deeside Extension and Murrayshire Extension lines. The following information regarding the mining business of the week is condensed from the Mining Jownwl :- " Great excitement has been shown in the mining-market daring the week, and business has been more than usually bri,k.

It should have been 5 per cent.

RAXILWAY 'AND MINING SHARBA Saturday Xvedng. The railway-market has been flat, and in several deacriptions, Buch as Great Western, Shefflield, London and North-Western, South-Eastern, and Laucashire and Yorkshire a further decline has taken place. Midland and Caledonian were also lower, the elosing prices, at 2 o'clock, showing a reduction upon the corresponding quotations yesterday. Great Northern were heavy, the A stock receding above 11.; it is inderstood that the purchases of the company to absorb the capital fraudulently created by Redpath are now completed. Canadian descriptions were flatter, and a considerable faU took place in Great Western of Canada; Buffalo and Lake Huron, East Indian, and G:reat Indian Peninsula were also lowrer. In foreign railways Dutch Rhenish, Great Luxembourg, and French shares generally were worse; Lombardo-Venetian also declined about lOs. In American securities the only business was in Illinois Central shares, which receded; the bonds, however, were rather better. In British mines no transactions have taken place, butEast Bassett were quoted at a further advance; a new and valuable lode has been discovered in this mine. Foreign mines show no movement of importance. Joint-stock banks were little dealt in, and there was no alteration in prices. InI miscellaneous securities a reduction of 51. occurred in British American Land. ORDflSABY 5HAEr A~ND STO0lUS.

lONDON, MORlDA Y, OCOJOBZEB 12 1857. The intelligence from India which we publish | to-day will, we think, be considered by the publie as sufficiently satisfactory. Indeed, the lapse of a fortnight without any fresh diaster is itself a success of no small importance. In the present state of things no news is emphatically good news. But we have now to record, not only that no fresh difficulty has arisen, but that our arms are rapidly making way through the enemy's country, and that the final crushing of the mutiny maybe predicted for no distant date. The tempest is breaking up, the sky begins to be seen through the thick masses of cloud. In a short time we may hope for the quiet and security which the empire had so long enjoyed. The news, as is often the case, contains some items which the preceding mail had brought us. For instance, the victory of General HAVFLOCK on the 16th of August was published by us on the 4th of the present month. The fight, it was stated, took place about 12 miles from Cawnpore; two guns were captured. Captain M&cEEN7m and 15 men were wounded, none killed. Therefore, up to the despatch of the present mail from Bombay on September 17 no later intelligence had been received from General HAvxLocK, although he, no doubt, was established with his little column at Cawnpore, waiting reinforcements. It will be observed that Sir JAns OuTRAm had reached Allahabad with a strong body of troops on September 1, and expected to arrive at Cawnpore and effect a junction with General HAVELOCK on the 9th. We- may therefore conclude that in Oude things are going on prosperously. The last accounts from Lucknow, dated the 14th of August, reported all well, and we may trust that the little garrison has been able to hold out for another month, and until the combined forces of the two Generals were able to march to the relief from Cawnpore. So much was partially known before, but what is new is of zufficient importance. First, as regards Delhi. We have for some time ceased to look upon the immedlate assault and capture of Delhi as the most urgent operation of the war. Undoubtedly, the storming of this city and the punishment of the chiefs of the rebellion would produce a'geat effect through the country; yet, lith the country between the Mogul capital and Calcutta swarming with enemies, the success of a small body of Europeans 900 miles up the country would but little avaiL It is therefore not to be regretted that the assault has been unavoidably deferred until troops are beginning to arrive at Bombay and Calcutta, and reinforcements are pushing up from the Lower Ganges. By the end of August, however, Generals WILSON and NIcHoLsoN were becoming strong enough to take the offensive, and the rebels within the city seem to have been conscious of the fate that awaited them. The siege train was expected to arrive by the 3d of September, and the place would be assaulted soon after. The news urged the rebels to a desperate effort. A body of them left the city to intercept the train. On the 26th of August they were attacked by General NiCHOLSON, and defeated with the loss of 13 guns and their camp baggage. This last decisive blow must have dissipated what little remained of the courage of the insurgents. For more than three months they had done their worst against the little band that held its position before the city. Even when it hardly exceeded 2,000 men and the rebels were nearly 30,000 they had been defeated in every sortie, and their inferiority to Europeans even at enormous odds fully demonstrated. Hence had arisen profound discouragement, accompanied, of course, by quarrelling and bloodshed among themselves. The population of Delhi detested their rule, and were anxiously looking for the restoration of the British authority. In this state of things we may well believe that the march to intercept the siege train was the prompting of that courage -which is akin to despair. The signal defeat at Nujuffghur with the loss of all their guns and baggage will, no doubt, plunge them into a dejection from which we trust that the promptitude of the British Generals will not give them time to recover. In the meantime the Sikh levies have, no doubt, been approaching from the north-west. The Panjab, we learn, is perfectly quiet. The 51st Native Infantry had mutinled at Peshawur on the 29th of August, but on the following day the revolt had been completely crushed. The mutiny of a part of the 10th iUght Infantry at Ferozepore had also been promptly suppressed. In other respects the district was tranquil. From the Bombay Presidency we leam that the remainder of the Joudpore Legion had mutinied, and were in march towards Nusseerabad, from which troops were sent to intercept thetm. This, however, was the only sign of disaffection in that quarter. The Bombay Army continued faithful, so that the Presjidency was perfectly quiet. To this favourable state of things the landing of the 89th Regiment from the Cape and the expected arrival of the 95th no doubt greatly contributed. Indeed, it may be considered that when once the English troops begin to arrive the rebellion will be at an end. The mutineers actually in arms, and who know they are fighting with ropeS round their necka, may persist in their resistance, but they will be unable to persuade I any others to join them. The native troops I-who have not had the inclination or the courage to revolt when the first storm nearly swept the British from their country will hardly be likely to stir when every day is bringing white regiments into port, when it is shown that, though surprised, betrayed, and outnumbered twentyfold, we cannot be crshed, and when it is evident that a swift and terrible punishment is about to fall on the mutineers. The fidelity of the Bombay and Madras Armies has been all through the great and vital question. With these two Presidencies quiet, the evil, though widely extended, was not beyond the capacity of one army and one campaign to deal with. But if the flame oE rebellion were to extend over a country half as large as Europe, then, indeed, would a task be set before the English people demanding the exertions and the sacrifices ef yearsto accomplish. Happily both Bombay and Madras, like the Punjab, remain perfectly quiet; Central India also remains undisturbed. During the maonth of September the troops from England would be arriving. Up to the date of this mail the reinforcements wers entirely from the Colonies or from the diverted Chinese Expedition. The 23d Fusileers, who went out in the unhappy Transit, had arrived at Calcutta, and the despatch of troops up the country would, no doubt, produce the best effect. The rebels from Oude are said to be threatening various points, and Allahabad and Benares were being plaoed in a atate of defence; but if these imnportant places had been seriously menaced we do not suppose that General OuTRAm would have been aole to push on to Cawnpore. The Dinapore mutineers have been followed up to Sasseram by Major Eyax, and again defeated. Higher up the country things go on favourably. At Agra we learn all was wells and, so farwas the garrison from being shut up in the fort, that a detachment under Major MoNwoMxay defeated a body of the insurgents near Alyghur on the 24th of August. Thus, on every point the intelligence is enoouraging. The only anxiety that we have reason to feel is about the fate of Lucknow, and there is positive intelligence that the besieged had obtained a supply of provisions, so that it was confidently expected that they could hold out until the arrival of Generals HAvELocx and OuTri. On the whole, these are decidedly the most satisfactory accounts we have received since the commencement of these troubles. There can be little doubt that the tide has turned, that the area of the insurrection is now circumscribed, and that the troops about to arrive will be able to deal with it speedily and thoroughly. We may now hope that each racceeding mail will announce to us the steadily progressive restoration of authority throu,gh the provinces which have been the scene of such calamities and crimes.
The last blow is generally an unexpected one. It is strange at this very quiet time of the year, when nobody expects any important home events of any kind, to find ourselves announcing the destruction of Orangeism in Ireland. But so it is ; the Irish LoRD Cn.N&iF:zuoi2s letter is the death blow to that old Irish institution, around which so many associations have gathered, which has been the centre of so many solemnities and ovations, grand days, processions, ceremonials, cavalcades,inaugurations. and commemorations. What war cries and heroic speeches, flags and banners, have attended its march ! Orangeisn ought to have expired in the midst of a storm or on a field of battle, not in the long vacation, when statesmen have gone to Scotland to shoot grouse, when all the -world is touring in Switzerland, Germany, or Norway, and hardly anybody is left at home; when even the news of its death wiU be a week old before it meets the eyes of the greater part of the Legislature. But fate is very perverse, and many a rough warrior dies in his bed, and many a quiet civilian in the open field. Orangeism had, in fact, lingered on so long in the last feeble stage that its death is now hardly felt as an event. It was like the Old Year about 11 p.m. on the 31st of December. It gives up its last breath without a struggle at a mere letter from the Irish CHANCaIOn, announcing that Orange Justices of the Peace will no longer be allowed. This step has, of course, not been taken without advice from Government here, and there can be no doubt that it will answer its purpose. It passes off quietly; it makes no noise; even the Irlsh Protestant press is silent, and has hitherto hardly raised a protest. When an act of suppression takes place so tran.. quilly it is a proof that the institution is thoroughly ripe for extinction, that it has ceased long ago to be a living institution, and only lingered on by habit. This is the case with Orangeism in Ireland. WVe do not mean to say that there are not at this time plenty of wild Orangemen in Ireland, who will talk exactly as Orangemen talked in the reign of GEoBC-i III. This always happens in the case of any sect or institution that has been great in its day; it leaves a vast quantity of combustible material behind it, and even in its ashes feels its wonted fire. This is the reward of past reality, and it is one which we should not grudge. There wiU be always numbers who, when life has gone, will declare tbat it has not gone, that the institution, or the sentiment, or the creed is as strong as ever, or stronger, that it has only slept, and is going immediately to reawaken in greater force than ever. This is the ratioale of all revtivals, as they are called, reanimat ons of things dead in religion or in art. We do not doubt, then, that Orangeism has at this moment plenty of enthusiastic disciples in Ire. land. But the test of real life in an institution or a sentiment is its hold upon public opinion, and Orangeism has long ceased to possess this. There was a time when Orangeism was really useful in Ireland, when the English Government was weak, and the country wanted a strong zealot institution for the protection of the Protestant part of the community, and in order to keep down the savage Celtic element, which had so much the advantage of numbers. Orangeism was, as Lord MACAUTLAY himself allows, in those days the civilizing ingredient in the Irish mixture. The Orangeman represented England; he was, infact, an English or Scotch colonist, and he did what colonistg do on a barbarous soil,-he introduced agriculture, planted and drained, built farmhouses and country seats, erected bridges, made roads, checked violence, punished robbers and murderers, and established law and a magistacy. This was a good work, and it could onlybe done bythat vigorous combination which a strong fanatical spirit inspires. The Orangemen were a unted phalanx in the midst of a ferocious, barbarous, and yelling native rabble, that hourly threatened them with destruction. Nothing but religion was strong enough to be such a bond of union, and all sincere popular religion at that day was fanaticism. The Irish battle, then, of that day was a religious one, anid the country was convulsed by zealot fighting against zealot, but the contest was on the whole beneficial, because it covered a real progress going on underneath. One of these militant parties was the superior English intelligence, bent on Protestant ascendancy, but also bent on rescuing the country out of the hands of savages, and giving it culture and law. Thus, as chymistry rose up amid the grotesque toils, the wild aims, and serious triflings of medi2val alchemy, Irislh civilization rose up amid a furious religious war1 which ditrate4 ad convdu4 the whole community, but the very bigotry of which still contained in its bosom the secret of progress. But Orangeism haa long ceased to hold this relation to, and perform this work for, Ireland. The English Government grew stronger and stronger, every year adding to the principle of civil obedience in Ireland, and the need for acts of force I becoming every year less, till at last it was able to throw off the asistance of this irregular coadjutor, and to rule reland by its owrn strength and authority regularly and systematically. The awkward ! extraordinary instrument was rejected as soon as the ordinary means of government were found adequate to their purpose, and true poliI tical science threw off Orangeism just as the chrysahs iheds its outer skin as soon as ever its own maturity bas made the latter an encumbrance. Religioas bigotry is noLb wanted now for the purpose of protection against Celtic aggression, or to puah on the culture and improvement of the country. The protector in Ireland is now national law, and the work of improvement and progress goes on by the force of its own reasonableness and expediency, which an enlightened public opinion admits. We have no further need, then, of Orangeism, and it has accordingly been laid aside as an instrument which has been useful in its day, but hsu now done its work, and can only do mischief, if it goes on doing anything. This substitution dates substantially some 30 years back, but Orangeism survived its period of reality and life, and dragged on a feeble existence till this sudden unnatural flare at Belfast has at last called down the final stroke. We do not wish to write its epitaph with bitterness. It did good work in its day, and its principal crime, like that of Many other institutions before it, has been Ithat it has gone on pretending to work when its day was over. We will go so far even as to say, that with all the usefulness and expeI diency of abolition and change, there is some natural regret when anything perishes before our eyes to which a true, sentiment has ever attached. We are at any rate reminded of the lapse of time, and of that wheel of Providence which since the world was made has been laying low one institution after another. The rule of the crozier, the feudal system, the clan sytem, the divine right of kings, have all in turn disappeared from the scene. Orangeism cannot lay claim to asociations so poetical as these, yet a genuine and a stirring sentiment once attached to it, and the loss of this will be regretted by some who thinL the age is becoming too utilitarian, and that the tendencies of society are leaving zeal and enthusiasm too far behind. But such considerations as these must give way to the great principle of good regular government, which, amid all the i poetry of irregular systems, has alone Divine authority on its side. We may admire the spirit which could in different ages supply the place of a good government when this was not to be had; but, after all, a good regular government is the ordinance of Providence; for not poetry, but use, is the aim of nature, and not sentiment, but law, is the perfection of society.
It is extremely interesting-unless, indeed, a term expressive of some deeper emotion should be employed-to remark the views and proceedings of the manufacturing world at this moment with regard to the cotton supply. This plant is now considered, and with perfect reason, as one of the chief elements in the wealth of nations. The mutinies in India set the French journals speculating the other day on the effects producible in the cottonmarket by the interruption of cultivation in Bahar, the Americans are serioualy apprehensive of being overtaken by the excessive demands of Europe, and our own manufacturers have formed associations and established correspondents for the purpose of seeking out this precious material in all parts of the world. There is no delusion or mania about aU this. What bread is to life cotton is to commerce, for raiment comes next in necessity to food. Wool was once the great staple of this country, but wool now gives place to the produce of the cotton plant. On this produce depend our manufactures, and upon our manufactures depend our inexhaustible resources and our national power. The Providential adaptation of the finits of the earth to the wants of man is nowhere more manifest than in this signal instance. The plant thus universal in its utility is all but universal in its growth. If cotton could only be raised, like the rarer descriptions of spices, in a single quarter of the globe, our position would indeed be alarming; but, as it happens, the plant wiU flourish within certain latitudes over an immense extent of the earth's surface. Asia, Africa, Anerica, and Australia appear to compote with each other in productive power, although one country at present has almost a monopoly of supply. Cotton will grow with luxuriance in India, and it could be raised in almost any quantities in Borneo. The French are pushing its cultivation in Algeria, and Dr. LIVL?NGSTOrN assures us that Africa is the very territory for such crops. The capabilities of the West Indies and Guiana in this respect are notorious, Brazil actuaUy sends us considerable supplies, and we have seen excellent specimens from some parts of Australia. There is no limit, in fact, to the expansion of which cottonplanting admits, as far as the elements of soil and climate are concerned. Cotton, in other words, can be grown in quantities sufficient to meet all the requisitions of manufacturers, and since manufacturers can well afford to pay for a commodity so remunerative, why, it may be asked, do not the operations of supply and demand result in a natural adjustment on this point as weU as others ? To this question we think we can give some reply. As a matter of fact, it must be premised that this adjustment up to a recent period had actuaUy taken place; indeed, it is but just now that a positive dearth of cotton is apprehended. About the time that our own cotton manufacturex made such enormous strides the United States of America entered specially upon the work of supply. This, by their energy, devotion, capital, and skill, they soon monopolized, and for years together consumption on this side of the Atlantic and production on the other proceeded at a rate of acceleration tolerably uniform. Even now a good crop and a good harvest in the Southern States of the Union would provide the Lancashire mills with almost as much provender as they required. Lately, however, the supply has threatened to fail in keeping pace with the prodigious development of the demand, and a variety of circumstances appear likely to increase the disproportion thus first created. The Americans themselves are working up a portion of their own raw material, and the manufacturers of the Continent now come into the cotton-market with more considerable demands thanin times past. These weights thrown into the scale tend, of course, to the further depression of the balance, and the Manchester people ask what is to De done if America can hardly supply her present customers and is likely enough to have more? The apprehension is felt in America itself, where, instead of expressing any jealousy, the Southern journals dilale on the expediency of enlarging the f eld of supply and bringing some countries to the aid of the Americans in their work of provisioning the world. Accordingly, our manufacturers have organized associations for this purpose, and have I cast about in all directions for the means of stock- ing the mvket more zatisfactorily. We have been, favoured with soome communications representing the results of their labours; we have also receired intelligence of our own upon this important subject, and it appears to us that the incidents of our present position involve nothing very unnatural or extraordinary. The capabilities of various regions in variots quarters of the world for the production of cotton have been placed by these inquiries beyond any doubt. there are territories without end from which cotton migV. be exported, but when it comes to the point in any particular case it is found that something or other is wanting to sure a good and regular amount of production. To understand this we have only to look to America and observe the combination of means by which a large exportation of cotton is permanently sustained. The Southern States poss not merely a favourable climate-that advantage is shared by many other regions-but capital, labour, skll, and, above all, a comprehensive organization of resources resulting from years of commercial experience and success. The Americans know how to grow cotton, how to pick it, how to dress it, and how to pack it. Ships in abundance are readyto carrylt fromCharles. ton to Liverpool, and the whole trade from first to last has been brought into the best operation by long practice and good returns. The case is something like that of the wine trade at Bordeaux or Dijon. It is posible that other countries may be capable of producing excellent grapes and excellent wine-indeed, we frequently observe assertions to that effect, accompanied by samples of South African, Australian, or other produce of certified superiority. But Claret and Burgundy have got possession of the market; they are uncommonly good, the thade is actually established, and if we went any further it is by no means unlikely that we slould fare rather worse. Just so is it with the American cotton trade. The cotton coming from Charleston every year is as good as we should ever get from any place-probably better; nor is it at all probable that capital, climate, labour, experience, and all the ingredients which go to first-rate production, will ever be much more successfully combined than in the Southern States. If, in short, the supply from these quarters answered the demands of our manufacthers as liberally as Claret and Bur. gundy answer the inquiries for French wines, we should be under no necessity-saving our opinions about slavery-of looking for any new cotton fields. Here, horever, ends the analogy between the two case The supply is not equal to the demand, and is likely to become less equal than it is. So the question of the Manchester people recurs with as much force as ever-What is to be done ? It appears to us that if one America is not sufficient, and we want a second, we can hardly do better than take the first for our model. We know of acores of spots where the soil and the clinate are as good as in Georgia, and though, perhaps, cotton of the very best quality is not to be raised everywhere, or upon the instant, we have great faith in the powers of cultivation. But soil and climate are not enough. Capital, energy, and organization will be called for still, or we shall get no cotton to speak of, and it happens that in none of the countries otherwise fitted for the purposes in question are these requisites to be found among the native possessions. The qualities which enable Americans to send out millions of bales every year are not discoverable in Hindoos or Borneans, and as they are not indigenous they must needs be imported. England, in short, must find money, machinery, and wits, and if these are carried to some well selected territory, where there is good land and abundant labour, we may soon be able to dismiss our alarms about the production of cotton.

HAYMARgET THEATBE. Miss Amy Sedgwick, who made her first appearance ou Monday lzst, has tvice repeated the character of Pauline since that occasion, and has secured an amount of publio estimation rarely acquired by young beginners. The quality of her voice, which is somewhat hard and uanmusical, deos not appeal greatly to the sympathies of tlFe audience, but the organ is perfectly clear and distinct, and the articulation is admirable. Her inteUigence seems of a very high order, if we may judge by her perfect grasp of the character of Pauline, ard the quiet, secure manner, with whioh she indicates its manifold phases of love and indigr:i-on. That she has not as yet given free rein to her power is evident enough and some of the strong lines, escaily inthe third act, might be more forcibly uttered. Bct the existence of power, and tkat in a high sate of discipline, cannot he doubted foil a moment, while the appropriateness of her gesticulatioA is one of her happiest qualities, Whether she is an actress of spontaneous feeling as well as of cultivation may at present be a matter of queston, but this much is certain, that she is an artist thoroughly trained in her profession, and with every one of her resources at her fingers' ends, The Lady of Lyons, as a whole, is very woll acted at the Haymarket. Mr. Howe displays an extraordinary amount of mnuly spirit a Claude helnotte i Mr. W. Farren is blndly wicked as Beauseant; Mr. Chippendale is a blunt frank representative of Damas; and the mothers of the two young persons are played with becoming pomp by Mrs. Griffiths, and with due maternity by Mrs. Poynter. Performed an infinity of times, and censured by an infinity of critios, this is one of the few plays that never weary,and people are as agreeably surprised when the penitent Claude returns with a pocketfull of money, as though they were not perfectly aware of the event beforehand.
LYCEUMI THEATRE. On Saturday night, when the ears of the audience were stDI ringing with the effect of " Rhode's variations," so exquisitely sung by h?iss Pyne that we forgave its interpola. tion in Les Dtaman de la Couronne, the curtain rose for a faroe boaring the singularly appropriate title, A VerySeriouw Affair. The story, which related to the embarrassment of two timid gentlemen who, having involved tbemselves in an "a ffair of honour," did aU they could to keep out of each other's way, but were at last inveigled into fighting a duel in the dark-this story, we say, was intrinsically smple enough. However, in the course of dramatic treatment It had been subjeoted to such a lengthening and obscuring process that it stood a perfect marvel of entaugle. ment and dnration. Hasty advisers might, under these cir. cumstances, suggest the emuloyment of that oft-mentioned instrument, the prunlng-lkife,5 but their counsel would be moat injudicious. By dint of its longth alone the faroe -was not only saved, but arrived very respectably at its termina.- tion, fairly living out tho malcontents, who hissed when it was about half over, and, as they hised, retired. Sudh a Parthian modt¢ of warllare was totally without avail ainst such a solid f ort as this hardy production, which, having reduced an audienue dense, through the attraotions of the excellent operaticcompany, to an insignifloant hndful of persons, frowned stately and unscathed upon the retreating besiege pn.

TIBE SUPPOSED MURDBR. The intense sensation which was created many years ago by the first discovery of Greenacre's crlime bas even been turpased by the painful feeling which the discovery of the 3nutilated renauins at Waterloo-bridge has raised in the public nind. The mystery which envelopes the whole affair -the certainty which now exists that an elderly woman must have borne a principal share in the deed, and that with her, probably, as many as three orfour others were partakers in -the awful crime, render it a subject of most painful intere6t. D)uring yesterday afternoon hundreds flocked to gaze upon the spot where the remains were found, and crowds re%nained in the vicinity of Bow-street, evidently it the van hope that they might hear of some olue having been ascertained as to the murderers ; but nothing, of course, transpired to reward tha patient expectation with which they evidently waited for inteUligence. We wIll not attempt to impose upon our readers by saying -that the ends oi justice may be defeated by premature dia losures, for, unfoztunately, beyond the fact that one of the nort horrible murders that has ever stained our criminal annals has been committed, there is nothing whatever to idisclose, and up to the present timue not the slightest clue ms been obtained as to its perpetrators. The police base 'their hones of their detcction,-first, on the chance of the -clothes being recognized; scondly, oni the ownership of the carpetbag being traced; and, thirdly, upon finding the cabman who drove the woman with her ghastly load to the neighbourhood of Waterloo-bridge on Thursday night2here is not the slightest possibility of recognizing the deceased by the remains which are in the bands of the police. Tn faot, these are nothing more than a pile of Jbones, on which the muscles and large tendons hang In ragged tatters; all the flesh and skin, except a small portion of the breast and under one armpit, having been rcompletely hacked away. Both the thigh, leg, and back bones h,zve been sawn asunder, in order, doubtless, to pack them in a small compass in the vessel of brine, in wrhich they have evidently remained from two to three weeks. From these relies of hnmanlty, therefore, ao clau eW to who the deceased was can be hoped, and, if the awful -crime be ever brought home to the guilty persons, it will be as we have said-by means of the clothes, the carpetbag, and the cabman. The chances which the former offer are mot very, strong. The dothes, which have evidently once teengood and of superior quality, are so torn, sained with blood, marked with earth and whitewasb, and, above all, so sbrunken and altered by leng immersion In strong brine, as evidently to have totaJly changed them from the Appearance which they must have presented when elean and new and worn by the unfortunate deceased. Still they are far from being quite unrecognizable, tbough at the first glance few wo uld suppose it possible that they were the clothes of a well-dressed gentleman. Experienced taUors who ha.e been brought to examine them express a decided opinion that they are of foreign snake. From the number of persons who examined themn at the Bowstreet Police-station on Saturday, anxiously seeking for some trace of miissing friends or relatives, it would seem that n,ysterious disappearances must be of very frequent occurrence in this metropolis. No less than eight or nine genatlemen went on Saturday and yesterday to the station, each of whom was searching for some clae to the discovery of persons who, within the last month, without any known teeson. have disappeared, and never since been heard oL No one, however, recognized the clothes which were found with the remains. A minute examination of the dress and the condition in which it is at presant seems to show at least the manner in which the murder was committed. There are marks of three stabs in the back, between the shoulders, three in the abdonien, and no less than seven exactly over the region of the heart. All these are clean cuts showing that they Snust have been inflicted with a double-edged knife, about the thickness of a crown-piece in the centre-a poniard-bhided weapon similar to those ealled Spanish knives. The waistcoat is not pierced, so that It must have been tulmuttoned at the time the murder was committed. -The trousers, also, must have been partly undone, as they asre only punctured in one spot, though the shirt shows snarks of three stabs having been inflicted. If any conclu. slon can be founded upoII these appearances they would certai,ly lead to the belief that the deceased must have been first stabbed from behind, and that then a desperate struggle ensued, for the other wounds in the back and abdomen are wide apart, as if the assailant struck ahen and where he could. As the deceased becamo wreaker and offered less resistance the finishing wounds in the heart appear to have been given with ferocious rapidity. .They almost all lie within the circle of a crown piece, and lzust therefore have been struck as rapidlyasthe hand could rise and falL The back of the greatcoat is marked with 'vhite, as if the murdered man had struggled hard 'with his back against a white or lightly papered ValL After the assassination had been effected it is suppsed th%t the body must have been left as it feU upon its face for 12 or 24 hours, as the blood has completely saturated all the front parts of the dress. The coats, waistcoat, shirt, and trousers, also, are all split down the back in two halves, and the sleeves of the coats ripped open, which leads to the supposition that the body must have become perfectly rigid and in a contorted and unnatural position before any attempt was made to renmove the dress. The hopes which exist of the carpetbag being traced 'Are foumded upon the fact of its being a comparatively new and very peculiar one, with tho trade mark of a shopkeeper, a " 4.. Sd." in ink figures on the handle. The bag itself, though nearly new, is extremely old-fashioned with regard to forml, being nearly three feet deep aud two wide; in Tact, irg great sire and peculiar appearance would place its Identificstion by those who had once seen it beyond the 'possibility of doubt. That this bag containing the remains wras the one which was carried on to the bridge by an elderly woman on Thursday night is distinctly established by the statement of Etherington the toll-taker. Etherington wxs himself formerly a constable in the A division, and remarkable for his shrewdness and caution, and this fast, coupled with the peculiar circumstances which he mentimis, apparently place the accuracy of his testimony beyond a doubt. Ee states that the woman came from the Xliddlese,. side of the water, and paid the toll at the western tollgate. He took the toll, and saw that she had with her a browvn paper parcel tied with cord; it was long, ibulky, and apparently heavy. She had also the carpetbag in which the remains were afterwards found, aud ,which also seemed full and heavy. HIs attention was particularly directed to the woman in consequence of her turning the turnstile twice while endcavouring to get the carpetbag through. He spoke to her about this, said that he would have to pay the money himself, and that she should hbave been moro careful. Tho woman did not repily, but looked at him steadily whlle he lifted up the carpetbag for her and placed it on the top of the turnstile. She then mnttered something in a very gruff voice to the effect that it could not be helped, took tho carpetbag and walked slowly away. As it was thought possible from the gruffmess of the voice that it might have been a man in 'womarn3s clothes, Etherington has been questioned on this point, but is positive as to its being a woman, as he saw her face most distinctly, and furthermore that he ze3narked she was short even for a wtoman. The police who are engaged in ondeavoruing to penetrate the mystery which surrounds the whole c-se believe that a woman so unequal to carrying a heavy weight as the woman -at the bridge evidently showed herself to be must either have been sassted by male accomplices or have driven to the meighbourhood of the bridge in a cab. Against the former supposition is the fact that none of the police in the vicinity -f Wellington-street have seen persons carrying bundles such as described, though the carpetbag could not have ecaped attention and remark had it beeni so conveyed. On 'the other hand, the most minute inquiries have been set on foot among the cabmen throughout the metropolis as to ivhethec any one answering the description of the wroman -with carpetbag and bundle, or any ono at all with a carpetbag and brown paper parcel, was set down in the neighbourhood of Waterloo-bridge on Thursday night. As yet these inquiries have elicited nothing, though it is still hoped that, a the details of the atrocity comruitted are ridely 'spread, infoniation on this point may be obtained, The police are inclined to the opinion that in case of to cib bavilng been employed tho murder must have been ppetrated. at some of the houses of il-fame which are numerous enough alnost within a atone's throw of that end of the bridge. Ot course, the most vague and contradictory rumours have been circulated everywbere as to the discovery of the other portions of the body. Though some of these reports and rumours were In the last degree absurd, they were all carefully sifted and inquired into, and some of them certainly bore most unexpected frlto. We may here mention that the polioe entertain little hopeo of recovering the head, hands, or feet of the body. In their opinion these members were in the brown paper parcel taken on to the bridge and have been thrown into the river. Evory part of It Im. mediately beneath thebridge, onboththeeastern andweern aides, has been carefully draged; but, as might have been anticipated in a search for so small a parcel, and one so likely to be carried about by the slightest ourrents, without suoews. It was confidently stated yesterday that the guilty parties had been traced, and that the woman who carred the bag on to the bridge bad been apprehended. We regret to say that there is not the least truth for such assertions. LiteraUy nothing more wam known at a late hour last night than was known within an hour after the mutilated remains were in the hands of the authorities ; not only has no clue been obtained, but nothing whatever has been elicited that would even lead to the hope of the mystery being eventually cleared Lp. Nevertheless, Mr. Superintendent Durkin is indefatigable in his endeavours, and Is exhausting all the resources of the detective polioe in his attempts to bring the matter to light. Among the heterogeneous mass of information which he received on Saturday, all more or less irrelevant and useless, were two commnunIcations,-one to the effect that a bag supposed to contain something connocted with the murder had been washed ashore at Lamn beth, the other stating that the heed of a man had been found slightly concealed under the soil of the enclosure at Sussex-gardeas, Hyde Park. The police immediately pro. ceeded to inquire into these reports, and found that a leathern bag had been washed ashore at Lambeth, containing, among other sundries, a pistol-case end some bulleb, aU being the part proceeds of a burglary committed a few days since at the mansion of Sir W. Poland, near Black. beath. On prooeeding to Sussex-gardens the police found that two human heads had recently been discovered there, -one of a man, and another of a womsn, but inquiry Into the matter showed most satisfactorily that the man's had been buried some months, and that both had been used for the ptrpose of regular anatomical examination, and werenot in any way connected with the present mysterious ease As we have mentioned the subject of anatomica examination we may refer to what has been suggested by some of our Sunday contemporaries-namely, that this supposed murder will turn out to be nothing more nor less than a medical student's hoax. This supposition is simply absurd, and shows entire ignorance of the way in which allmedical students pursue their anatomical studies. The inquest upon the remains wUl be held to-day, when the medical evidence will show that beyond a doubt one of the most deliberate inurers which we have had to record for many years hba been committed.
THB INDIIN MUTINIES. The following is an extract from a letter from Colonel R. Campbell, C.B., commanding 90th Light Infantry, dated- " BERHAMPORE, AUG. 2. "My tUme is so taken up with the novelty of everything connected with the service here that positively I have not a moment to spare, and every day endeavour to lean the Indian custoras and forrns as regards the army. The 90th left the Himalaya steamer for Chinsurah in two boats towed by steamers, large oovered Tessels, and we remIned aix days at ChinsurLh, and got on extremely well,-no drunkenness, no sickness, and the regiment all I could wish, so clever and orderly. I implored them daily not to poison themselves with bad spirits, but to buy beer, and during six days I had only three cases of drnnkenness in 800 men, and only four men sick, who came so from England. We have had no casualty since leaving England. Iwas hurriedoff from Chinsuraband embarked theregiment again insteooners towing boats, and wehave been four days comlng here. My instruotions were to land here quietly and expeditiously, and to disarm the 63d Native Infantry and the 11th Irregular Cavalry, to take also the horses of the latter, also to disrrm some native Artillery here. The total force considerably exooeded mine, with the additional advantage on the native side of 30 of the most splendid cavalry I ever saw; as regards men, horses, and equipments I never saw anything equal to them. The regiment was landed by me 730 strong and I ordered the Commandant here, who is Ideutenant. Colonel of the 63d Wative Infantry, to parade the whole of the troops. He wished to put it off until to-day, but I would not grant an hour. The Sepoy regiment came out on parade; I drew up the 90th opposite and on one flank, and ordered them to lay down their arms; they obeyed, and I then ordered them to take offtheir belts, which was done; and having securedthem in carts and upon elephants; Ikept the regimnent of Sepoys standing upon parade until the 1lth Inregular Cavalry came up, and they came from a distance * f five miles off, not expeoting to find an English regiment, but only a detachment of the 35th Regiment, 180 strong, whom they were prepared to fight. Their commanding officer wished to put off the parade until to-day, the same as the others; but I refused. Fortunately I dld, for not a man would have been here this morning ; they would have gone off with horses, arms, and ammunition. They seemed thunderstrnok then they discoverod our men, and had no idea that their fine horses were to be taken from them; if they had thought so they vould have gone off in a body. They told the Sepoys afterwards that they were cowards to give up their arms, and that if they had waited until they came up they would have fought us, but that my men were so placed they could not escape, The cavalry obeyed orders to lay down their arms, but with a much worse grace than the Sepoys; they looked at each other, and then put them on the ground. I collected them, and found al the carblnes and pistols loaded.i I was standing opposite to them. I then ordered all the beltsto be taken off, and this was not approved of; some broke their swords, others threw their pouches into the air, but still the order was obeyed. Having coUected them I surrounded them with my men and ordered them i to lead their horses off to a safe place I had selected for them, and where they were turned out loose. The men then pulled off their long jack boots and spurs, and pitched them away. The regiment had not mutinied, but, no doubt would have done so, and of course I treated them as a regiment having committed no crime. They are splendid men, hat savage beyond expression. Their swords are like razors. The Political Agent there had no idea that we should have succeeded in getting this regiment together, and told me that we had done the best service yet done In India since the outbreak. He has reported our valuable service to the Government of India, and I have reported direct to the Commander-in-Chief. Had I delayed as requested until morning not a man would have been found. Ve are steaming up the Ganges, the weather terribly hot, mosquitoes most barbarous, heavy rains. I have to disarm and dismount another Irregular Cavalry Regiment in two days' time if they-have not already gone off. I want to come near some mlUtinous Sepoys ; they shall remember the women and children if I do.'

ATrEmrTED MURDER AND SuicIDn..-A determined attempt by a mother to destroy the lives of herself and child oy drowning was made in the riverRibble, atPreston, on Thurs;ay afternoon. As the bodies were being carried down by the stream they were observed by some workmen engaged en a boat, one of whom, a ship carpenter, named James Fisher, an expert swimmer, jumped in the water and, though a higb tide was running at the time, succeoded in securing the body of a woman whom he brocught ashorem As he seized the 'oody of the woman he perceived that she rel%xed her --rasp of a child which she was tightly holding on to ber breast, and having placed the woman (who wsr just alive) in the charge of a fellow-worksan named l?rodsham, ho again plunged into the stream and rescued the child, which was already quite black in the face and exbansted. Both the mother and child were conveyed to Mr. Thsrelfalls, the Wheatsheaf Inn, where medical aid was procured, and the usual restoratives applied with sucgess. The girl was removed to her erents' , house the sae nigt, but the mother was not suficiently recovered to allow of her removal. The latter is the wife of a spoiner named Evdward Kirkby, of Henristta.street, and the child is a daughter by a former husband, named Bobin. Eson. 'rho ulfortunate vwoman has lived separte from hor I husband for the past &so months, and she left him with an infant nine weeksa.e4..

A LAY SBRMOY. "Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which Lath ten talents ;-and cast y the unprofitable Se-at Into outer darkmnees" The life of a nation or of a nation's poliey is as the life of a man. Both have their creeping infancy, their hot youth, their golden prime, their tottering age. To both are finally meted out by an Allwise Judge with unstinting hand hope and confidence, remorse and despair, as they have att^ined or come short of the great purpose of existence. This is an universal rule; it holds good of all nationg and of all men. It holds good of their internal religious life still more thanof their external political acts. As the tree falls so will it lie; man and nation alike shall be known by their fruits. On the present occasion the train of thought caries our minds with a lightning flash to a great pe3insula many thousand miles away across two oceans, and bids us re-iew the infancy, the youth, and the prime of that mighty empire which England has established and upheld for more than a century in those regions of the gorgeous East. We stop at the prime; the weakness of age has not assailed us yet, and, if we fall under our calamities, we fall like Lucifer, in our pitch of pride, hurled down in the full vigour of our fancied strength. 'Twere long to tell how, little by little, those two small factories on the banks of the Taptee and the Hooghly, buds at first of little promise, expanded into an empire which would have excited "the envy of Alexnder and Augustus;" but of this we may be sure, that if the " traditionary policy" under which they grew was godless and indifferent; if it was based on the principle of veiling the pure light of Christianity, while it allowed the revolting orgies of Vishnu and Siva and the disgusting sensuality of Mahomet to revel in the glare of day; If the m3inisters of Christ, and not His ministers only, but even all professing Christianity, were counselled to seek bypaths and corners, while idolatry in its most hideous features flaunted itself in high roads and public places-if this has been our " traditionary policy" in Hindostan, we can only say that so great an empire, established with so much toil and blood and treasure, deserved a better policioal and religious guide, and that, so far from recognizing in it the reason of our successes in the East, we regard it as an incubus which has weighed on us from the first, and as a proof of how muich the Anglo-Saxon rmce can accomplish under the most unfavourable conditions. There is a touching story somewhere of a father who would not allow his child to be taught to say its prayers. " Some of my friends may be infidels or heathen," he said, " and, though this in theory is a Christian family, it would shock them if they heard the child praying." Besides, the mran was a philosopher; he thought it unfair to bias the child; when it grew of years to judge it might choose for itself, and pray or not; meantime it was not to pray. So things went on for some time, till the child's first grief camne. Its mother died. The story doesBnot tell us whether the philosopher used to pray himself, nor does it inform us if he wept when his wife died. We lnow nothing about him till he went to bed one night, ani then the story goes on to say he heard some one repeating the Lord's Prayer in the next room, where his child slept. This was an unpardonable liberty-to pray out loud in his house, and in bis child's bedroom; so he went in to see who it could be that thus broke through all rule and order, and there he found the child's nurse, who had taught it its prayers long ago after the good old fashion, and now was comforting the little one for the loss of its mother by making it say " Thy Will be done." Here, then, was the whole policy of this man with regard to his child destroyed by a perverse conibination of calamity and disobedience, and a glorious philosophic experiment spoilt by an overruling Providence, which took away the child's mother, and a maid servant who had prepared it to support her loss. Well I we cannot help thinking that the "traditionary policy" with regard to Christianity in our Indian Empire is very much like the policy and purpose of the man in the story and his child. We have been afraid to let the children pray lest the heathen who live in the house should be offended. The experiment has failed in every way more signally in the reality than in the story. The children have been taught to pray by stealth, by hasty and hurried missionary effort; the heathen 7iare been offended, and now that a great woe has come, when children are weeping for mothers and mothers for children, it is not in consequence, but in spite, of those to whose care the temporal and religious welfare of India hag been committed, that our countrymen, in the agony and anguish of their tribulation, have been able to say " Thy will be done." Let us turn, then, from a system which has shown itself Eo little capable of appreciating its opportunities; let us avert our indignant eyes from an Executive which has been content with the maxins of mercantile prudence, instead of rising to the dignity of an Imperial policy; let us forget the burning zeal with which the chiefs of great idolatries have glowed; let us not reckon the scimitars which flashed by hundreds of thousands at the bidding of the Caliphs; nor call to mind that fury of conversion, that great greed to gain souls, that mighty impulse to propagate the "faith," which began with Mahomet and ended with the subversion of the Empire of the East. This burning fire of enthusiasm is not, it is true, of our creed or of our age. It has long since passed away. Or, if we remember these things, let us remember also that when so much was done for a base imposture we might at least have done something in our generation to spread a purer faith; but that we have done nothing at all, that we have been neither bot nor cold, that we have halted between two opinions, lest we should provoke the suspicion of proselytism and conversion, until we have ended by exciting that very suspicion; and so, by a course of conduct quite unaccountable to the Oriental mind, have drawn down on our heads the very evil which has so long haunted our doubtful minds. Let us turn from the Government, then, and fix our eyes on the conduct of our cotuntrymen as it has been displayed of late in India. This is a more welcome theme. Here, in the energy of character exlibited in each isolated case; in the self-reliance, resignation, devotion, faith; in deeds of the sternest herois,m and traits of the most touching tenderness, we recognize the grandeur of our race, and almost exult in the opportunity which has brought such bright examples before the eyes of an astonished and admiring world. As no persecution, Christian or heathen, has been steeped so black in treachery and cruelty, or has vented its malice with such diabolical tortures and such exquisite brutality, so no martyrs, ancient or modern, have met their fate more serenely and cheerfully than our glorious coLuntrymen. Death has looked them in the face, not with the mild features of a happy release, but grim with a3l the agony of soul pangs and shocking spectacles, far worse than any bodily anguish; yat they have met him manfully, and fallen without a murmur, confessing their faith. Who that reads the heroic and pathetic details of these Indian masaacres is rot reminded of that chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews hvich tells of that " great cloi. of witnesses " "w ho through faith subdued kingdozws, quenched the violence of fire, escaped Ila edge of the sword, out of weakneis were nzlk strong, waxed valiant li fight," xnd " turned to flight the armies of the aliens ;" Or if we think of those whose lot has rather been to bear than to do, who does not recognize those who $'Cwere tortured, not accepting deliverance," who "had trial of cruel mookings and scourgings," 't of bonds and imprisonment," who were " stoned, sawn atunder," and " slain with the sword," who "wandered about, being destitute, afflicted, tormented ?" What has enabled Englishmen to do such deeds and to bear such hials ? One Divine gift enshrined in a little word,Faith. And now that we have contrasted the lukewarmnems of the system of Indian Government and its " traditional policy " with the fervour and heroism of each individual of our race, let us ask if the " traditional policy" of which we have heard so much does not stand self-condemned by the faith of those very Englishmen whose religious feeling it has striven so long to keep down ? When was this "traditional policy" of suppressed religion, of Christian worship with bated braath, first introduced, by whom was it inangurated? It aroze a century ago, in that philosophic age when Christianity was so sound asleep that it might have been thought dead; it ws inaugurated and adopted by men great in their generation, no doubt, great as generals and statesmen, but not great in religion, for their religion was one of expediency, and their Christianity rather of the pocket than the heart. It happened, too, that their policy, the esence of which consisted in eldng out the lion's hide with the foU's skin, was admirably suited to. the wants of a weak but ambitious State. In this they were true children of their time. But it has happened here, as in so many other cases, that the politic wisdom of one age has come to be jthe folly of the next, and of this at least Englishmen may boast,-that they are better Christians now thau they were a century ago, for they conld not well have been worse. So it has turned out that, while all England has been advancing and improving itself in many ways, our " traditional policy" in India has lagged, more and more behind the spirit of the, age, till it has become ridiculous and impossible. The syste3m of no religion, in plain words, has broken down, because Englishmen in the East will not tolerate it any longer. They are too good for the system, and will no longer suffer the Gospel light to be hid under a bushel, beeause that was the order of the day in the time of Clive and Warren Hastings; their conduct lately has shown that they can be as brave as their fathers, and better Christians into the bargain. The less, therefore, we hear of a " tradi" tional policy" in this sense the better. It is a thing out of date, and lifelws; an idol which " old Indians" will do well to throw, along with all other4idols, " to the moles and to the bats." HABITANS IN SICCO. Broad Phylactery, Fast Day.
THE CHURCH AtISSIONYRY SOCIETY VBRSUS XESSRS. IISEMAN AND CULLEN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-I beg to solidit a place in your columns for the following,extract from a minute recently isued by the committee of the Church Missionary Society, aud widely circulated among that society's friends and supporters :- "The committee must, in conolusion allude to the pecuniary loss to the society which w1 6e occasioned by this mutiny. They are not able at present to calculate the amount, but it will probably exceed 20,0001. or 30,ODOL A large expenditure must also be incurred by the temporary removal of missionaries or their families, while for tha present the yearly amount of contributions from North India of 8,0001. or 10,0001. cannot be expected. Under these circumstances the society 'wll need the extraordinar aid of friends at home; but they do not at present urge special efforts to raise such aid, beause they are desirous of not intefering with the fund now being raised for temporal relief to the many thousand suffering European fsmies who have been more heavily afilicted than the missionaries, and have many of them lost together with their property all their means of support. "A A few zelous friends have already sent specal donations to the society to meet the emergency which the comnrnittee morst thankfully acknowledge, and such donations wll be kept separate for the fund in prospect; but at present the committee desire to promote the fund for temporal relief, of which they are convinced there is the utmost need.' So honourable a contrast to the selEsh and eectarian con. duct of the un-English Cardinal and his contraternity under similar circumstances needs no comment. I remain, Sir, yours faithfully.

LIVERPoOL, Oct. I0.-The Royal MaOl stearnship Europa, Leitch commander, sailed hence to-day for Halifax and Boston with the mails, a large cargo, and 381 passengers, besides 60,000l.in specie on frelght. Thesteamer Borsassa, Captain Trantmann, has put into this port, condgned to M.ess. Leech, Harrison, and Forwood, to repair her propeller, to enable her to complete her voyage to New York. She left Hamburg on the lst inst., with a large Xumber of passengers and cargo, put Into Greenock on the 5th inst,, and then came here. No damage is expected to be found In her hull or cargo. FitrUL COLLIERY EXPLOSION-s.-The Butterley Company's New Colliery at Ripley, Derbyshire, has been the scene of a series of explosions by which about 35 persons have been more or less lnjured. On Monday, the 5th inst., an explosion took place, when two Mren were severely burnt. On the following day (Tuesday) the ground-bailiff, Mr. John Smith, went down thepitto ascertain the state of the workinga, and while going round for this purpose the gas )gnited and burnt one poor fellow very badly, and Mr. Smith himself ws also burnt, but not seriously. Precautions were taken to prevent further damage, and, notwithstanding the continued presence of much foul gas, it was considered safe for the men to continue at work while proper caution was taken. Early on Friday morning, however, intelligence was quickly spread that another and more fearful explosion had taken place, by which nine men and two boys had been severely burnt; their names are George Bonting, Wingfield-park; William Walker, Swanwick-hill-top; Samuel Shooter and bis son, a boy, Greenwich; Enas Yates and Samuel Meakin, Greenwich; William Bulock, Ripley; John Green, Mount Pleasant; James Wra Codnor; Henry Ivin, Ripley; and John Millership, ER locks, Ripley. Several of the first-named are very bad, and serious doubts are entertained of their lives being preserved. Some idea may be formed of the severity of the re from the fact that a new suit of flannel which one of the sufferers wore was cormpletely burnt to a cinder on his body, and a valuable pony, afterwards brought up the pit, presented a most frightful appearauce, having been literaly roasted alive. The sufferers were promptly attended to by Mr. W. H. Fletcher, surgeon, of REpley, who exerted his utmost to alleTiate their pain, and, according to latest accounts, they were doing olly as well as might be expected. The colliery being newly started we are informed that great difficulty is at present experienced in obtaining proper ventilation until the Iheadings," now being pushed on are further advanced and the proper " airways" are formed. This is being done with all ossible speed, after which the pit will, no doubt be worked with perfect safety, The immediate cause of the accident on Friday appears to have arisen fromn one of the men having placed a naked candle too near the roof. This, we understand, wiU in future be prevented by every man being compeled to use the Davy lamp. Ripley, Saturday Morning.-Bollock died this morning. olr. Coroner Whiston will commence his inquiry on hlonday (this day). 1n ;IVE:RrOOL. COUm-r COUR.-The public, and more particularly those persons in any way interested in the proceedings of the Liverpool County Court, wil learn with great regret !that Mr. Joseph Pollok, the re spected and indefatigable judge of that court, has resigned his office, in consequence of his continued rn-health. r. Pollock has all along laboured to make his court as useful ,Is possible; hehasperformedthe duties of judgeinasatisfac- tory and impartial manner, and he has won for himself the respect not only of the professional gentlemen attending the court, but of all classes of suitors; and yesterday morning the news of his resignation was received with the utmost regret by all. After a brief abeence, 'with the view of endeavouring to recruit his health, Ar. Pol. I lock lately returned to his duties and stated his intention of sitting daily from half-past 10 to balf-psst 3 o'clock; but he was agin taken ill, and was compelled to proceed to london for the purpose of consultig the most eminent medical mene The opinion given is that there is no organic disease, hut that the learned Judge is suffering from a general prostration of strength and energy, and he has been ordered absolute idleness for a very considerble time-at least a year-foreign travel, sea voyages, a warm climate, and the utter absence of excite. ment. !inder these circumstances we believe Mr. Pollook, on Tuesday last, informed the Chancellor of the Duchy that he held office only til his successor was appointed; and he has also made a similar communication to the Lord Chancellor. Shold his health permit him, however, he will probably presde in the cotrt for a few days befoce he takes his final eave of a position in which he acquitted himself so ably. Mr. T. S.

A meeting of the inhabitants of this town and neighbourhood was held in the Town-hall and presided over by the Mayor (Mr. Aloody) on Friday, for the purpose of commencing a local subscription in aid of the funds for tho relief of the sufferers in India. Several appropriate resolutions in furtherance of the object, proposed aud seconded by the Rev. R. Ainsley (the vicar), Mr. W. I. Daubeny, Mlr. Wintriagham, the lev. J, E. Coulson (Wesleyan minister), Mr. Brooks, lr. Snow, Mr. Joseph Bennett, and Mr. Bannister, were carried unanimously, and a committoe appointed to collect subscriptions. The subscription list wa commenced at the meetng, when about 60l was con. TAVISTOCK. A meeting was held in the Gulldhail on Thursday, Dr. HA.Ru}Ess, the portreeve, occupied the chair, and commenced by readlng several letters from gentlemen of the town who were unable to be present, bht expressed their sympathy with the object of the meeting. Be then obLerved that the object of the present meeting was to express our great grief at the loss of so many men, and espedally women of our ownI kindred, vwho had passed through death in some of its most horrible forms. This was not the time to make complaints against the Government, but we should come forward as Englishmen for the parpose not only of assisting those who are now suffering from these atrocities, but also to stir up the home authorities, so that India may be reconquered; for he looked upon the present revolt as one of the most critical in its effects to England that had happened for a very considerable time. In the late war with Russia we had numerous and powerful allies; now we have to fight tho battle almost single-handed in order to retain the British power in the East, He hoped the people of thai town wol not give way to some of the miserable feelngs which had been elsewhere expressed, such as the cry for "horrible vengeance," &c. It was a different matter to insist upon retributive justice; hbt when he was told that Delhi would uap to three days' sack, and that thereby many persons would all victims to the massares which would follow be thought it high time that some protest should he made against it. Mr. TtRRinL then proposed, and Mr. HoSEY seconded, the following resolution:- "That this teosling beg to express their profound and heartfelt Bsmpathy with or- fllo--eouoterymen I 1.di. in the aufferings and privationx to whlch they haTe been subject by the revolt of the Eiepoyes" After a few brief remarks from Messrs. SLmua and BRiDGMXS,_ The Rev. E. SPEcxRC proposed the following resolution - That thisg eeting. whle deeply symDathizing with the sufrerings of our Dountrymen in India, and feeling It a duty and privilege to eon. tribute to the retiet of their immedfiate necenMiies, does also oon2lde, l mot justandpolitistbatour falthbtl alle, the Bikhband Gboorkas ln pesicalar, aould be lecludeod I the dl3tribukion of she htnd now eollecting, and does hereby expresa Its desre that a portionot the Tavistook subscription be appropriated to thoir benelit." He thought that some tribute should be paid to our brave allies in this war for their noble and galant conduact. It was a remarkable fact that in sarcely any of the meetings vwhich had been hald in England on the present subject was any mention made of these brave supporters of ours, who for their courage and fidelity had rare y been surpassed, and he should be glad if it could go forth to the world thlat Tavistokc had taken the lead on that point. Mr. C.utPPNTXB seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. A subscription list was opened and a committee appointed form making a house-to-house canvass. CITY OF ABERDEEN.

PETRJURY AND THE SCOTCH PvnLIcHorsE AcT.. -Numerous cases of perjury committed to conceal offences, bave been brought under pukbio notice since the passing of the Forbes Mackenzie Act restrieting the sale of liquor in Scotland. OnjThurday last an extraordinary case of the same crime being committed, but for a different purpose, nau Iy, to xrocure oonviction, was brought before Sheriff Gordon. and a jury at Edinburgh. Two police comstables doing duty. in plai clothes, named Patrick Niven and Neil Stewart5 who had been for some time emploed in watching houses Euspected to sell liquot without license, and particularly at nignt hnd morning and Sundays, when the licensed houses. were closed, had, instead of merely watching for infractions of the Act, entered Into a wcheme with the wife and sister of Niven to entrap a vegetable dealer into a sale of spirits, and then, by the women giving false namea in court, and appearing to be uconnected with tb. officers, to procure a conviction in fhe poliee cour. It did not appeer whether. the constables bad Any personal motive to gratify or wished merely to show their vigilance; nor did it appear whether tiky had habitually acted on the entrapping system. The two constables were cltarged with sebornation of perjury and the two woznen with perjry. Niven and his wiHo falling to appear ats werea iesed for their appreheasion, and their bail bonds for 604 each were forfeited. Neil Stewart and Rose Amn Niven pleaded "Not Guilty." It was then proved in evideace that on the night of Saturday, the 2M of June, the girl Rose kad been sent by the con.. stables to the shop of Bobert Ferguson, vegetable dealer, to ask for whisky (the evidence was contradictory on the point as o wrhether she received it); that the constables a'Ve iniormation to tle effect that Ferguson had made an. illicit sale of spirits that a ch=ee was issued agiiast-him 'and that on the 7th of July he vwa oonvicted befors ,Bailie BUack adder In the policscourt on. the testimony of FaPse Ann Diven who falselygave her namne asMary Harnson, and gave a false address, Lnd wrho deponed tCat she had bean sent for the. whisky by Mr Harrison, nxder which fWoe name Niven's. wifeapperedandcorreboatd her evidenc.

AMMRICA. .Nb. , LrvERpOOL, OCT. lo. The British and North American Royal Mail ateasuhip Persia, Judkins commander, arrived this nmorning from New York, with advices to the 30th ult., 115 passengers, and 2001. in specie on freight. On the lst inst., in lat. 40-42 N., long. 69-30 W., the Persia passed the Royal Mail steamsip Arabia, hence, for New York; on the 2d, in lat. 43-23 N., long. 60-21 W., passed two screw steamers, one a large one, both bound west; and on the 5th in lat. 5055 N., long 25-ol W., signalized the Royal Mail steamshlp Asia, hence, for Newv York. The Cunard screwr steamshlpJura wras e2pected to leave St. Jobn's, New Brunswick, on ths 1st Inst., for Cork. The Ministers of Guatemala, San Salvador, and Costa Rica had addressed a note to General Cass, informing him that Walker was fitting out a new expedition against Nicaragua, the men of which were to go from the south, and the armament from New York. The expedition was to gather and be put together at the harbour of Bocas del Toro, a short dixtance south of San Juan del Norte, and then to land at that port. The Ministers requested that a vessel of war might be sent to the former harbour, and that the one lYing at San Juan del Norte be ordered to prevent the landing. They also desired that the Filibusters may be sent back to the United States as transgremors of the laws and disturbers of the peace of friendly nations. All hopes of the safety of the commander and missing passengers of the Central America had been abandoned. A correspondent of i1t, sgejldd Advertiser gives an account of avery bloody fight which had occurred at Boneygall, a small settlement in Georgia. A band of thieves having for some time committed depredations on the property of farmera, it was determined by the " Begulato'" (Lynch-lawers) to rid the country of them. Accordingly they were ordered to be off, with a promise that if they went quietly they should be paid their travelling expenses and receive compensation for what little property they left behind. Among these persons thus notified there was a man namedMosesHormsby and his family -wife, one grown son (Mike), and three small chldren. Moses thought of the matter, and concluded not to go; but still led the "Regulators" to believe that] he would go willingly. Failing to fulfil his agreement by the specified time, 14 riounted "' Regulators," only two of whom were unarmed, appeared one morning at Hornsby's door, and a Dr. Foreman advanced to parley. At this moment a shot was fired from the house, through a sort of rude and inartistic porthole, at Foreman, missing his knee a few Inches and striking his horse dead beneath him. Another shot in quick succession discharged a full load of buckshot into the left breast of Rumnpt, a "Regulator," who on being shot wheeled his horse round and, crying out to his comrades to wcatter, galloped off a short distance and fell dead. The firing continued rapidly and with terrible fatality from the house for some seconds, perhaps minutes. The party scattered as quickly as peaslble, but left four more of their number upon the field, two named Radellff-an old gentleman and his son, the son mortally and the old gentleman dangerously, if not mortally, wounded; May, a sonin-law to Radcliff, dangerously wounded, and Foreman, with his ankle fractured by the failing of his horse. Three horses were also shot down and kiLled. In the midst of this firing young Radcliff, Eatisfied that his wound was fatal, determined to have some little revenge, and, crawling to a stump, rested his gun upon it and fired through the porthole, emptying the contents of one barrel in the face and breast of old Hornsby, killing him. Casting his eye to another part of the fortress he perceived a human figure, at which he fired the contents of the other barrel. This shot, it seems, took effect in the left side of Hornsby'a wife and in the legs and hips of her Infant, which she held in her arms. She wax killed instantly; the child may possibly recover. About the time these two shots were fired Mike Hornsby appeared in the piazza and fired one barrel and drewv up to discharge the second, when a "' Regulator" named Morgan, and who at thiis moment stood alone upon the field, defending the wounded, seized the gun of a fallen comrade, and cautioned Mike if he fred the second barrel he (Morgan) would certainly return the fire. Mike heeded not the warning, but fired and turned o run, probably, when Morgan, true to his word, blazed away, and dropped Mike -with a mnortal wround. From Havannah we have advices to the 25th ult. The stock of sugars at Havannah was 175, 000 boxes; at Matanzas 27,000 boxes and 18,000 hhd. Money was abundant at 10 and 12 per cent. for six months. Exchange on London, I Ito 11i. Freights were dull, and several large vessels had left in ballast. Several cargoes of negroes were reported to have been landed on the north side of Cuba. Two Spaish vessels had been seized, and several persons supposed to be implicated in the trade had been imprisoned by order of the Captain-GeneraL The correspondent of the Nei v York Trin&u says :- " The American ship Mazeppa, or General Paez, was seized last Monday week, near Cardenas, by the Spanish schooner Habanera while in the act of landing a cargo of Africans. She was ashore at the time, and the schooner approached and boarded her for the purpose of rendering assistance. When the officer came on deck his eyes met with one of those awful scenes so common in the slave trade. The deck and hold were strewed with hundreds of naked Africans In different stages of the smallpox. The able-bodied portion of the cargo had been successfully landed, and t reems that the captan was zaaking arrangements to get off the rocks and proceed to sea again until the disease had disappeared. The vessel was cirried into the port of Cardenas, wbore she will undergo quarantine. Her captaln Is an Amierican, and nearly all the crew Spaniards and Portuguese. The number of negroes saved was about 500, and had she not been aground she wouid nuoe have been suspected by the Spanish cruier. We had hardly beguan to get over the excitement attendant on such an extraordinary event in the annaLs of the Spanish marine as the capture of a slaver when some bold fellow came into the harbour of lIavannah, immediately under the gus of the Punta Castle, and within S0 yards of the sentries box, and landed 400 negroes. How the matter was managed is more than I can ascertain. A thousand reports are in circulation, but as they throw nolight on thesubject, I refrain from troubiing your readers with their perusaL One fact, however, cannot be overlooked-400 negroes were landed in this harbour at 12 o'olock in the night, in ront of a guard. conveyed to acme hiding-place, and with the exception of 43 belongig to the sailors have been conveyod to safe places in the country. We have rece*ved three car oes of Chinese labourer,alIgodht,anfie looting men." Vera ra, allingoed health, and fino. Advices from Vera Cruz to the 22d ult. state that the grant to the new Tehuantepec Company requires the finishing of ten leagues of railroad every year from the 7th of September, 1857, and all the dykes at Coatzacoalcas and Ventosa vithin the first year. From Hayti we leam that on the 12th iult the old coffee crop was all in; its price had risen to $12. Campeachy wood was plenty, at $4 5e. for 1,0001b. There was little sickness in port. Letters from Belize, Honduras, state that the mahogany cutting this year has been a decided failure, falling short of the first etiate by nearly 10,000,00feet. The product of logwood has also fallen short. Commercial affairs continued in a condition of collapse. The New York Bh1ippi7Wz List says a_ " The negotilons of mercantile paper at baDk and note brokers' offioa have been extremely light and at very irregular rates. The highest grades of paper have been dis, counted at 2 to 3 per cent.uS -moa,F lwhile very good endorsed notes nave changed hands af 6 to 6 per cent.,"aj even at more exorbitant figures under peculiaj eum. stances. A conference of the leading bank officers wa held yesterday, which resulted in a relintion to reoouand an imnmediate inerease of loans and discounts to the extent of 3 per cent. This will doubtless produce a favourable effect in the street, and have a tendency to strengthen confidence In a good degree. There never was a year sinoe our existence as a nahon when the same extent ef those rmsouresa which constitute the only real bass of rosrity were so abundarst or so valuable. The crops alrea thered exceed all precedent, and those of the south, in cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco, wil ealize more money by many millons than they ever did before." The New lork- Courier and Fiptsirer says " The suspended banks of Philadelphia ana Baltimore are gradually settling themselves down upon a non-speoie currency, and their movements for the next 12 months will be regulated in the first place by the legitimate demands upon them by their merchants ; and, secondly, by the means and measures essential to a restoration at an ear y day. Of a resumption there is no hope under 12 months. The sales of prodiuce and of merchandise, and business operations generally, in the suspended cities, must be adapted to a depreciated currency; henCe prlces, when compared with those of New York, will be nominally higher, but, in fact, will be somewhat lower. The foreign exports of the country must be regulated by the specle standrd only. The process of redemption of country k issues goes on with regularity and consistency. Thebank circultion of Rhode Iland will be taken to any extent in the payment of current liabilities in 'toat State or in the purchase of cotton goods the latter being more depressed in market value than the banik bll Thus far the suspnsin exend tothe ank ofPhiladelphia, L%ncaste Pitsburg (th Bankof P ttbr o lyxcpd, Balimre Cmbrlad,Nofok,IYeelng Wlmngon It will be observed that the sspension has been earliest jA those places having a redundant bank circulation. This is the weak point in American banking, and one on which banks throughout the country generaJIy faiL. At New Orleans and St. Louis, where legilation provides for an enlarged specle basis, their banis will not come into the measure of suspension. New Orleans has O6,000,0O0 inl specie against a ciroulation of $8,000,000; St. Louis ha $3,000,000 in coin to meet a lmited circulation, while 1l1lnols, Indiana, and Wisconsin are more infAted, their issues being based upon State bonds now depsocit-ed 15 to 30 per cent., Instead of gold and sllver. Bank Stocks have already declined 12 or 30 per cent. In many cases, and an actual depreciation to the extent of 5 or 10 per cent. has occurred to their capital in some instances, in consequence of recent failures. A formal meeting of bank presidents took place at 3 p.m. at the Cleazing- ouse to-day, to take into consideration the financiaI wants of the community. After oonsultation it was decided to recommend to all the banks of the city to extend their discount line 3 per oent. during the coming week. This, in the ags-egate, will amount to over- $3,000,00. -The banla at Newark and the old Trenton Bank feel theselves strong enough to maintain specie payments. In doing thisbthey must, of course, restrict their receipts to those bills which are equivalent to specie. Vaious calls have been made by the Western bankers tor secie from New York to enble thern to sustan themselves. u ntil a few dan past the prc8sureamainly at New York. Nowthe reaction is felt at all points in the West. We learn that the banking-house of E. J. Tinkham and Co., Chicago, suspended pyment to-day. Messrs. Darby and Barksdale and Mes John J. Anderson and Co. suspended at St. Louie, temgorarily only, it is believed, both houses having cA itl an established credit hitherto. The business of the State and of the West is paralyzed by the straitened course of the bakr. | Produce cannot be shipped because bills drawn upon It cannot be negotiated. Bills on London are without price; 5 to 6 per cenL re the nominal rates, but there is no money to pay for them. The same may be said of our domestic exchanges. The banks will not purchase on the South and West because the actual cost ot ex. change cannot be fixed.

' The Board of Brokers bad rescinded tfeir recent resolution, limiting time sales to 30 days and under, and extended time contrets to 60 days. The general opinion seemed to be that the misohievoas system of time sales should be arrestoed. "The bank statement was generally considered a favourable one, although there was a slight reduction of the specie item, owng to the liberal draughts made to sstain eastern banks. The returns for the week did not include those from the Island City Bank, a small and weak institution, which had ,gone into li uldatlon. When allowance was made for the absence of the report of that bank the decrease in the deposits was only about $100,.OOO The exchange-market, both foreign and domestic, was very much deranged. It was difflicult to sell sterling, especially produce bills, some of which were disposed of at 100, while bankers' brouht 105 to 106k. The West and South were genermly bare of exchange, and it wvas therefore difficult to give quotations. A early availability of thle productive resources of the cAountry was wanted. On this account not much was done for the Persia. There had been plenty of sellers of bills in the market, from bankers awell as shipping firms, and prices had a large range. The transactions in continental bills had beenvery limited, bat sales bad been considerable. Bills on London were 4 to 6j per cent, premium. The Phi7adelpAia Korth Ameruxsn of the 29th says " There was a much better foeUng In the mone7-market to-day. After several conferences among the presdents of aU the city banks yesterday it was determined to suspend the payment of specie on notes of all denomiations - to issue their own notes, including the smaller denomilnation for checks and all other obhgations; and to increase the lino of dicounta with a view to immediate reBef, while maintaining the purpose of a resumption of specie play ments. It was also determined to admit the Bank of Penn. stlvani& to equal participation in this arrangement, upon te foregoing conditions. This is the only stp the banks have taken that has exhibited the concert and sphrit of mutual conciliation which the oecasion demanded, and it has been followed by a cheerful raly that must be produc. tive of great benefit." The Americo,i of that city says " The Immediate effect of the suspension wa to brighten the aspect of commercial af5irs, and relieve the apprehension so constantly prevailing for the past month. The prile of money fell from 2 to li percent,, and an advance of psices occurred st the stock board. The disasters that threatened the business communitvhave thus been arrested, and the general feeling among the merchants was one of ap. proval of the course adopted by the banks. The prevailing opinion, in which the most intelligent of our officers join, is that the suspensdon will be but temporary, and that an early restoration of confidence will place affairs on a more fAvourable footing. Aooording to a rigid constraction of the charter of our banks they forfeit their corporate franchises by the suspension; but, inasmuch as it has been general, and was invoked by an unavoidable necesity, to disregard which wouid have-produced the worst results, there wil be no hesitation on the part of the Legislature in taldng any action that the contingentcy may require." The Govermor of Pennsylvania had isued a p clamation, convening the Legisature on Tuesdy, the 6th inst., in response to a general sense of its nece3sity, arising from the supension of specie payments by the bans and the pervading deranlgement in business affairs The p3anc in Philadelphia and further nortih had led to the suspension of specie payments by all the Baltimore banks on Saturday. The Boston Post says:- "Our money-market, as far s the bans and approved bank customers is concerned, is nvow on the verge of improvement. A few days longer, doubtless, and it will be matenaly better. The banks stand $500,000 better as to coin than they stood ten days ago, and exchange with New York is intheirfavour, rendering it almost certain that specie wlli continue to flow hither from Wall-street. The amount of Philadelphia collections and discounted paper now in the Boston banks is not enough to hurt the latter, even with a high premium for the change of the avails into coln as the paper matures. Moreover, Boston owes Philadelphia large sums for coal at this season of the year, and these sums will offset a large portion of the Philadelphia paper now in State-street, either for colleetion or discount. Future colleotions and discounts will be at tho charge and risk of individuals so long as the suspension l , The banks will act as agents only." The Ohio Life and Trust Company had made an assignment. A circular was in circulation among the leading banks, of which the annexed is a copy:- "The undersigned having been called upon to give their opinion as regards the effect likely to be produced upon the banks of this city by the suspension of the institutions of the neighbouring cities reply that It is their dedded opiion that the banks of the city of New York are in a safe and secure position, and that they cannot only sutain them. selves as speoie-paying banks, but, from the natural flow of coin and produce to tis pont, as a common centre, that they vwil soon be able to furnish further and more efflicent aid to the mercantile community." A partial or total suspension of labour was taking place in the woollen and cotton mnanufactuing establishments of New Eingland. One of the most agreeable features of the day was the steady accumulations oi deposits of small sums In the savingsbanks and the increased number of depositors. Among the reported failures were Foster and Co., Abbott, Dodge, and Co., and J. M. Mackay and Co., of New York; Lovejoy and Co., of Boston; Tirrel and C. Hearsey, of South Weymouth; W. H. Bottom and Co., Bottom, Tiffany, and Co., and James S. Stirling and Co., of Trenton * J. B. Holmes, of Cincinnati; J. P. Jewett and Co., of Boston; Bogy, Mittenberger, and Co., Anderson and Co., and Dawley and Barkdale, of St. Louis; Garner and Co., of Baltimore; and, lastly, E. J Tlnkham and Co., of Chicago. The Boston Tra'veller gives currency to a rumour that there was discovered a large amount of forged paper, stated by some at $30,000, and by others as high as $50,000, and advances the presmption that the forged paper in question i hat which has been quite freely circulated in thte clty within a few monons, ceasing the supposed signature of James Paul and Co., small traders, of Biddeford or Saco, Maine, and the endorsement of Hallet, Pinkham, Quimby, and Co., a dry goods firm, of Hanoverstreet, in that city, which failed a few days since. The Brie Constitution says :-"MI. Lswton, the cashier of the Erie City Bank, has been arrested for embezzlement, and, after an examination, has been held in bonds of $10,000 to answer the charge." Cotton remained inactive without change in prics, and holders, in consequence of tha unusually low stock, were not disposed to realize. flour had felt the effect of the stringency in the moneymarket, and holders of State and Western, although the receipts were light and stocks moderate, had been necessitated to give wry 40oc. to 50c., and at that reduction the business was only light and confined. to the wants of the local trade. The day before the departure of the steamer there was an increased inquiry for export, prices having fallen within shippers' limits, but the difficulty attending the sale of exchange stopped bnsiness and deranged the market. Pices were lower than they had been since the autumn of 1853. The Jura's news was considered favourable as far as it went. The market closed steady at the quotations.

THBE NITED STATE. (FoR oM oW. CoRs1'oNNz .) NEW YORB, SEPT. S0. Still a panic; with still a lower depth In stock values. Monday was, as might have been anticipated, a bluer day than anything yet. Following upon the supension of the Southern banks holders clung tenaciously to money here, and borrowinr Was almost Impossible. Erie fell as low as 10, aud other stocks proportionately. By Tuesday morning the world began to find that, after all, it was not entirely demolished, and recovered some of its pluck. Thisgn took an upward turn; but in these feverish times a fluctuation, up or down, meani little. The banks of Philadelphia, Baltimore, aud Washington, and of PRhode Island have been obliged to suspenld, and there ae spasmodic cases of disease in Western cities. AO yet, Boston, Newr Orleans, and New York stand fim The Boston banks feel sure of their ability to hold to their present position, as they are gaining specie-a confidence not altogether shared by this community, but at this distance it is not at all improbable thatour fears exaggerate their danger. The great manufacturers of that part of the country are rumning short and discharging hands; some havereduoed the amount of work more than one-half, some have even stopped entirely. Of the New Orleans banks, also, it is impossible at this distance, and In such a crisis, to judge accurately. So far as one can judge from their published statement they have a larger proportion of specie to deposlts and circulation than the banks of any part of the Union. Of New York I again say, as I said in my Sat letter, no apprehension need be felt. The presid*nts of the leading banks have felt called upon to issue a circular to that effect for the benefit of personis residing at a distance. Those on the spot had no need of such information. Government, in this ju?ncture, is also doing its best to relieve the market. In addition to authorising a new redemption ot scrip at a high premium, as shown by my last letter, which the savings bks here are takdng advantage of, it has disbursed a great amount of coin in the purchase of State stocks for various trusts, already something like a million and a-half of dollara is is alao the time for the heaviest disbursements for the great works going on at Washington. Probably'the Government are now paying out here a millon of dollars a month for salaries and contrapts upon the Government works. With such an amount of specie flowing upon them it is ,aot easy to see why the banks of Baltimore and Washington should have suspended. Now, this specie must find its way to New York, as long as the suspension continues elsewhere. The October payments, due to-morrow, will be paid in amaU coin. The steamer soon to be due from California will also probably bring a large amount of specie . and if exchange continue as at present, it must come here from London. Bankers' settlements Yes.terday were 105; 107 asked for the best bills. With produce bills, grain and cotton soon to coms in, it is to be hoped that this state of thing won't continue. The bank statement showed another laxge contraction in the line of discounts-nearly $1,000,000. It has now been determined to change the policy, and the line wil1 be Increased about $3,000,000, which, it is thought, will afford relief. IUnder the operation of the contraction stooks were low enough on Monday to satisy the morst imsatiate bear. The present trouble originated In the operatlonm at the Board of Brokers. How extensive its effects may have been in other cities I cannot say. Here it has been mainly confined,a up to this time, either to " operators" in stock-which is another name for gamblers-or to houses that have left the legitimate line of their business to put too many irons in a fire not large enough to heat them alL Whether it is t v terminate with such persons depends entirely upon tho time when people shal begin to find out that there is value left in property in this country. One thing the present pinch may be relied upoa to do-put down Filibustering. The Departmeat of State, ating upon information received through the Minister of CostaRica, has lately issued stringent instructions to officers at various ports to prevent the sailing of any expedition intended to operate against the Central American States. Even Filibustering can't do without money, and I fancy that with the latter at 3 per cent. a-month holders will find it won't pay to sink it in Central America. The IUnited States have taken the matter of the Isthmus routes a little more vigorously in hand than any previous Administration had ventured to do. New Grenada has been told th-at any attempt to collect tonnage dues, or a correspondence tax, or trandt rates ,will be resated by thOeUnited States, and that instructions have been given to that effect to the naval force on each side of the Isthmus. Cost Rica and Nicaragu, hasving s.hown Some disposition to close the transit route have been told that the -Jnited States intend to keep it open, and, while claimng no rights of sovereignty, mean to exercise sufficient supervision for that purpose. Venezuela has been notified that she must admit the principle of the Shelton claim, and that then this Government will negotiate about the amount. The policy of the present Administratlon towards Central America is decided, and under the circumstances moderate-calculated to leave these great avenues of commerce free for the world's commerce, and protected from the rapiE of the people and States along them.. 3 . ,j

.FOREICf TINTRLLIGRYCE. FRANCE. (FROM O'M OWIf ODRILXMITDXN-..) J& eg 7 portlol ofthe follog appeazd In our sena on2f Saturd y:-] e PARIS, Ocr. 9, 6 r.a. The bad weather has, as was expected, accelerated the raising, of the Camp at ChUlons. The grand review (revue dh'nmeur) was passed yesterday, in presence of the Empress, Prince Napoleon, and idx Marahals. The Empress returned to Paris last night, the Emperor returns to-morrow evening; the first detachments also leave for Paris to-morrow; on Monday General Regnault de St. Jean d'Angelyv will leave, and the camp will be declared officiaUy raised. In to-day's Moniteur the Emperor publishes his valedictory order of the day, a concise and neatly-worded document, concluding with a referenoe to " the immortal phalanxes which sank only by the exces of their glory and of their triumphs." The Emperor, it is observable, rarely loses an opportunity of exalting his uncle's fame, and, as long as he wisely abstains from adopting his policy, it would be ungracious to find fault with him for this, or for occasionally wilfuy forgetting the errors of a great man-errors to which the rum of his armies was certainly as much to be attributed as to the load of laurels they unquestionably won. Such oonsiderations, however, now come rather within the domain of the historian than of the journalist. The order of the day of Napoleon III. will, doubtless, by the well-merited raise it contains, add to the great gratification with which the Guard witnesses the termination of the campaign of 1857, and anticlpates the transfer from the dreary plains of Champagnetoit anugquartersinParis. The Camp of ChAMons is to be considered a per.manent institution, and a special chapter in the war budget will be allotted to it, as to the military schools. It is said that its raising, for this year, will be announced by an Imperial decree. Although letters from Marseilles said that the Emperor was no longer expected there this year, a report is current here that not only will he proceed thither in about a fortnight from this time, but that he will embark there for Algeria. The latter part of this report may possibly have for its sole origin a conversation that the Emperor held with Marshal Randon at the camp, in which he expressed his wish and intention to visit the French African Colony. The excursion need not occupy much time; a fast steamer performs the distance m 30 hours; and the season now is donbtless temperate and agreeable in Algeria. Nevertheless, I think it very doubtful that the Emperor will go thix year. At the review yesterday the Emperor distributed a number of decorations for long services. During his journey to and from Stuttgart, on his passage through Strasburg, Luneville, and Metz, he granted about 80 crosses of the Legion of Honour and military medals; . . By a despatch of the 6th inst. from Jassy we learn that the Moldavian Divan had asembled. It appears that the duration of the two Divans is to be limited to 15 days, so that it does not seem improbable that the Paris Conference for the settlement of the question may open noet month, as was lately reported. For some days past there have been reports of apprehended disturbances in some parts of Italy, and in iedmont, particularly, it has been said that the authorities -were on the qui vive. Last night's Presse spoke of symptoms of agitation, of arrests made at Bologna, of unusual precautions taken at towns upon the coast, and of movements at Carrara and Yicenza, but in this news there Is a probability of exaggeration. General Goyon, who commands the troops at Rome, and who has lately made a tour in the kIngdom of Naples, has written to Paris that in those two countries perfect tranquillity reigned, and that there were no symptoms of its probable disturbance. The English resident in Paris, and aU persons here who are in the habit of receiving English papers, wvould, I am assured, feel extremely grateful to the Minister of the Interior if he would give orders to those of his subordinates whose duty It is to exanine the contents of these journals previously to their distribution to be rather more expeditious in their proceeding. At present there is great delay in the delivery. The papers that leave by the morning mnai from London are frequently not delivered in Paris till the afternoon of the following day, at the same time (generally 2 or 3 o'clock) that those which leave by the night's post are habitually distributed. Surely a little more expedition might be used. The delay cannot be lid upon the wind and weather, because the letters that leave by the evenin post are delivered here before noon. very one has seen or heard speak of the great Robert Houdin. Besides being the prince of conjurora, he is an able mathematician and mechanic3an, and his electrlc clock, made for the H] otel de ViUe of his natve town of Blois, obtained a medal at the Paris Exhibition. It is not generally known that he was sent to Algeria by the noh Government on a mission connected with the black art-probably the firt time that a conjuror has boen called upon to exercise his profession in Government employ. Some details of hls expedition have just been published. Its object was to destro the infuence exercised among the Arab tri0es by the marabouts, an influence often mischievously applied. By a few clumsy tricks and irapostures these marabouts pass themselves off as sorcerers; no one, it was justly thought, was better able to eclipse their skill and discredit their science than the man of inexhaustible bottles. One of the great pretensions of the marabout was invulnerability. At the moment a loaded musket was fired at him, and the trigger pulled, he pronounced a few cabaUstic words and the weapon did not go off. Houdin detected the trick, and showed that the touchhole was plugged. The Arab wizard was furious and abused his French rival. " You may revenge yourself," quietly replied Houdin; " take a pistol, load it yourself; here are bullets, put one in the barrel, but before doing so mark it with your knife." The Arab did as he was told. "You are quite certain now," said Houdin, " that the pistol is loaded and will go off. Tell me, do you feel no remorse in killing me thus, notwithstandin, that I authorize you°" "You are my enemy,' coldly replied the Arab; " I wil kill you." Without replying, Houdin stuck an apple on the point of a knife, and calmly gave the word to fire. The pistol was discharged, the apple flew far away, and there appeared in its place, stuck on the point of the knife, the bullet the marabout had marked. The spectators remained mute from stupefaction ; the marabout bowed before his supe. rlor; "(Allah is great " he said, "I am vanquished." Instead of the bottle from which, in Europe, Robert Houdin pours an endless stream of every description of wine and liqueurs, he caUled for an empty bowl, which he kept continualy full of boiling coffee, but few of the Arabs would taste it, for they made sure that it came direct from the Devil's own coffee-pot. He thentolathem that it ws in his power to deprive them of all strength, and to restore it to them at'will, and he produced a small box, so light that a child could lift it with its finger; but it suddenly became so heavv that the strongest mau Dresent could not raise it, and the Arabs, who prize physical strength above everything, looked with terror at the great magician who, they doubted not, could annihilate them by the mere exertion of his will. They expressed this belief; Houdin confirmed them in it and promised that, on a day ap- ointed, he would convert one of them into smoke. The day came, the throng was prodigious; a fanatical marabout had agreed to give himself up to the sorcerer. They made him stand on a table and covered him with a transparent gauze ; then Houdin and another person lifted the aWble by the two ends, and the Arab disappeared in a cloud of smoke. The terror of the spectators was indescribable ; they rushed out of the place, and ran a long distance before some of the boldest thought of returning to look after the marabout, They found him near the place where he had been evaporated; but he could tell them nothing, and was like a drunken man, ignorant of what had happened to him. Thenceforward Houdin was venerated and the marabouts were despised; the object of the French Government was completely attained. The fashion of " testimonials " having, it appears, infected even the Arabs, a number of chiefs presented the great French conjuror with a piece of Arab writing, wonderfully decorated, hyperbolieal and eulogistic, and to which they were so attentive as to append a French translation. Besides this memorial of his Algerine trip, Houdin has a rosary which he one day borrowed from an Arab to per. form a trick with, and which the owner, persuaded that Sheitan in person was before him, refused to receive back. The accunts from $spain simply confi= what hmaa already been communicated to you. A letter of the 5th says:- " It is impossible to say anything positive concerming the d4nouewment of the Ministerial crisiz. The only thing cer1ain is that the Qqeen ha asoepted the resignation of all the Ministers, including General TNrvaez. She anifested, however, some repugnance to accept his resignation, and said that he might undertake to form a now Cabinet; his colleagues were of the same opinion, bat he remained deaf to all representationu, declaring that his only wish was to retire into private life." A private letter of the same date says " The Ministry has flen at last, and, as it appears, not to rise again. Still I would not gnarantee this, for it is stated to-day that Itistori, emboldened by her late suaccess in obaining from the Qaeen the pardon of a criminal condemnied to death, went yesbtrday to Her Majesty's box to Implore the rirdon of the great political criminal now about to be turned off.' In Spain little mercy is shown to a fallen foe, and there will be more jokes cut than sighs breathed on occasion of the overthrow of a Ministry which can hardly be succeeded by a worse. ThePays, which has furnished some of the most interesting of the numerous details that have been given of the proceedings at the ChUlons Camp, has a correspondence thence in its impression of to-night, from which it appears that canvass dwellings are becoming intolerable, owing to the frequent rains and storms of wind. The Emperor leaves at noon to-morrow, and, if the weather permits, he will be present, before his departure, at a comparative trial of the different firearms used by the Guard. Two battalions of Chaseurs and a company of EngineerJ Will occuPy the camp during the winter. One bat. taHion wl be quartered at ChUlons, the other at the camp, and they wil relieve each other monthly. The Cuirassiers and a regiment of Voltigeurs leave to-morrow. When distributing the crose and medals after the review the Emperor shook hands with all the men whom he thus decorated. With the bad faith that usually characterizes them, some of the Legitimist organs in tLa French press have repeatedly, since the outbreak in India, when speaking of tortures inflicted on the natives to compel the payment of taxes, given it to be understood that this was the work of English officials, although they must be perfectly weU aware that those cruelties were perpetrated by natives on natives, and that the utmost charge that can be brought against the European authorities is that of negligence In not sooner discovering what tas gomg on-highly culpable negligence, doubtless, but in some degree extenuated by the great extent of the districts assigned to their superintendence. One of the journals referred to gives to-day a list of barbarous tortures, and artfully leads its readers to suppose that these were inflicted by Englishmen or by English authority. That mauy and great faulta have been committed in the government and administration of India is generally admitted, and it is quite fair to point them out. If our French opponents would apply themselves to the task, they would, doubtless, find plenty to criticiso; and that would be a more honourable and creditable way of manifesting their hostility than by garbling documents and suppreming facts. But thus they find an easier and more congenial mode of warfare. It is rather fortunate for us English that we are a thick-skinned race, and that, although generally prompt enough in pointing out our own shortcomings, which strike us the more forcibly by reason of the lofty standard we have established for ourselves, we are exceedingly indifferent to the censure of foreigners. The dav of humiliation was too good an opportunity for ill-nlatured remarks to be mised by our enemies in the French press, and it has even been too much for the forbearance of some who recently affected to be our friends. " Only mountains never meet," says the French proverb, and to-day the Debats and the Spectateur chime In in delightful unison. Of the two the Specu isthe least unfriendly. The following is an extract from its article :- England has good reason to humble hersef, and, should the Almighty re-establish her former power, we trust thbt this humiliation wiU bear Its fruitg, and that the meditations of this day of prayer will not be lost. A grand and solemn opportunity has ben offered to the statesmen who have governed that oountry for years past to reflect on their polcy. We need only repeat what the best friends of England in the French pram have affimed-that their quarrelsome, unjust, and aggreidve policy has done everything but obtain for England the sympathies of the contlnent. And when this rule, which seemed to grsp at everything, was seen to be menawal at the point where it appeared to be the best established, the general sentiment ws not that which ought to have prevailed at the spectacle of the horrible duel raging in India between civilizatlon and barbarism. It must nevertheless be admitted that a grand and noble sight is offered by this nation-so haughty, so full of Its power-humbling itself at the volce of Its Sovereign before the hand which chastises it, and imploring God to bestow on it the strength to conquer. These are signs by which we recognize a strong and free people, and a nation called upon to accomplish high destinies." The Dews writes as followsa- " The ideas which we have expressed for some days past on indian affairs prevail at this moment not only in France, but even in England. In reading the article of The Times on the day of humiliation it Is impossible to forget the article published by the samae journal some months ago, in which it proclaimed the English nation 'the first Mnssni. man nation in the world.' What a sad and cruel turn in political destinies ! The 'first musslman nation' is now threatened with the loss of the title which inspired it with pride; the nation which boasted of reigning overl5O,OOO,OOO subjects Is at present the most humiliated and affictea of all nations. Gcod forbid that wo should rejoice or triLmph over this terrible trial, this sudden humiliation inflicted by Providence on our allies and neighbours; but we are forced to acknowledge that this mea culpa, so solemnly proclaimed by The Times, is the echo of the publio sentiment of France and Europe." A letter from Turin announces the arrival there on the 7th inst. of the Infanta of Spain, the Duchess de Montpensler, with her husband and children. All the honours due to the sister of Her Catholic Majesty were paid to her. The relxway from Novara to the frontiers of Lombardy on the Ticino is to be opened to the public on the 10thinst This Inauguration would have taken place on the 1st of October but for the rain, wvhich fell in torrents, and caused some injury, which it required a few days to repair. The Nuremnberg Gazeite says that when Baron Hubner, the Austrian Ambassador at Paris, last left Vienna, he brought with him an autograph letter from the Emperor Francis Joseph to the Emperor Napoleon, which the Baron delivered at the camp of Cbnilons The 7azette adds, this letter did not contain an invitation to meat the Emperor of Austria at Munich, as has been erroneouly stated, but that it related to the question of the Principalities, which is to be arranged by reciprocal concessions on the part of France and Austria. The Emperor Francis Joseph raised this question at his interview wiith the Emperor Alexander. The following i the telegraphic despatch from Jassy referred to above:^ "The Divan wasopened on Sunday last by the Metropolitan. His speech was moderate, and was well received. " The moet perfect tranquillty prevailed throughout the assembly. "During the sitting cries were raised in favour of Moldavia, the Porte, and the friendly Powers.

Yesterday being the day appointed for our na tional humiliation on account of the present state of affairs in India, the prescribed form of service was duly performed in our chapel here, and was at. tended bv Lord Bloomfield, the gentlemen attached to the minsion, and by all the English reddents not imperatively prevented by other duties A sub. ption has also been opened here among ourselves as a contribution towards the Indian Relief Fund, and is progresing favourably. As there was no religious service of humiliation in the afternoon of yesterday the Kreuz Zeituttg took upon Itself to read us a homily in the evening, in which it favours us with a distinct revelation of the Almighty's motives in thus severely punishing our nation, which it, nevertherless, recognizes as God's chosen people and after His own heart. As the writer in the Krcu Zeitung is not the only individual who profes3es to know exactly what goes on iu the councils of the Most High when the subject under consideration is one's neighbour's misfortunes, we need not stop to inquire how it is he comes to be favoured by a special revelation on the subject, but rather listen with interest and curiosity to an explanation emanating from such a soi-disant high authority. The following is an aperS4 of the bomily in question. The Krewz Zeit4vj experiences a shuddering feeling of awe on the receipt of every fresh budget of Indian news : " Who does not feel the deepest commiseration for the wretched victims that have been most cruelly offered up there by hundreds? In spite of the reckless manner in wrhich England has of late years, and apparently almost intentionally, striven to alienate from her the sympathies of German hearts, there wil be few found, particularly among Evangelical Christians, who do not from the bottom of their hearts experience a deep and fervid sympathy for the English people. August lipa have already pronounced it openly, ' There is in England seven times as much truly Evangelical Christianity as in Germany,' and this was made the guide-line of our policy in the late Oriental conflict. Moreover, and what is still more important, God loves the English nation, and has for generations given it the mission to strive in the foremost ranks for the extension of His kingdom; in it God has manifested to aU heathen nations the victorious irresistible force of Christians But there is something still higher and more impcrtant than even this preference shown by God for the English nation, and that is God himself, His truth, and eis holy providence. Difficult as it is even for the Christian clearly to recognize the hand of God in the events of passing history, it is the more edifying and cheering when it can be so distinctly traced as it is in the present events in India. " The Engliah Governnant, which must be here taken to represent the English people, has for years past promoted sedition and rebellion on all sides, and now a rebellion against this same Government, more fearful and terrible than has been heard of for centuries, breaks out in the very seat of its power and its riches. The Engliah Government did not hesitate to transmute the prescriptive form of ancient Christian treaties, " In the name of the Triune God," into a deistic form, in order that Mahomedanism, now received into the pale of European civilization, might be put on an equality with Christianity; and it is Mahomedans who are now exhibiting their civilization on the helpless wives and children of the English, alnd manifesting to the world what totally dilirent views of right spring from the teaching of the false prophet and from salvation through the Son of God. " England backed Turkey in the late war out of fear that Rumia might become dingous to her in India. God permitted the English, with the assistance of the French, to defeat the Runians, although the latter were fighting the battle of Christianity against Mahomedanism The Almighty wa resolved to show the Russians that those who wil serve Him must be pure in heart, and He punished their arrogance and high-mindedness ; and to the English, who gained little enough in that war, He is now showing that it is not the Rusians but Himself that is to be feared ln India. How bady has not England prostituted the name of Christianity in her government of India! Idolatry has been made a source of revenue, schools have been instituted in which everything heathenish was taught, and nothing about Jesus Christ, and now, forsooth, the application of hogslard to cartridges is made the pretence for rebellion, as though heathenism was in any way endangered by Chriatian England. Government officials there have shamelessly committed atrocious crimes in former days, and now they are compelled to see these crimes retaliated on the persons of English woomen and girls, " Who among us does not desire, does not pray, that England may be eventually victorious? But canvictory be expected, or can it bring blessings in its train, before England recognizes these causes for the rebellion and sincerely repents of them ? What most of all pains us is, that from Christian England we have heard so little of this recognition; almost the only thing of the kind was the feeble, though correct remark-, of Lord Ashley towards the close of last session, how much he bewailed that people always spoke of the power of England, and not of their trust in the power of God. Trust in God is only possible after acknowledgment of sin and repentance for it and that God may speedily vouchsafe this to iEngland is our fervent prayer. God loves England still, and will grant this." For the saLke of the kindly feelings expressed towards us in the above perhaps it will not be worth while to be too critical with the reasoning, but at any rate -we must wait for more special information how the Kreuz Zeitut71g has come into poesion of this direct and authoritative exposition of the Divine motives for inflicting on England this judgment, and until we receive it we may venture to doubt its Authenticity.

THE ".TELEGRAM." TO TRZ EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-As you were yourself the means of giving to the world this now word, which but for its adoption in your columna would probably have remained unknown to fame, perhaps you wUl allow me to express an opinion that you were not quite as ignorant of the principles of philology as the correspondent of the Sun appears to imagine. I dare not enter the lists against a writer " half " of whose vocabulary consists of words like "micography" and Its fellows, though I am curious to know of what the other half consists. I will not even dispute his proposition that it is the office of the " lexicographer " to supply new words to a language. But I may venture to set against his quotation of the words " paragraph," " autograph," " photograph," and "holograph," the equally well.known " opigram," "an&. gram," "monogram," and "diagram." These words have not, I believe, been productive of any very frightful consequences to the English language, nor would they, so far as I am aware, rise in rebellion against the introduction of this new comer into their society. The common sense of the matter appears to me to be simple enough. The word "' telegraph" is known to denoto the apparatus used for oonveying the message. The message itself has hitherto been called a "telegraphic despatch." A single word was obviously desirable as a substitute for this expression: and " telegram," a word constructed, as every Greek scholar knows, on perfectly sound principles, was offered to the language, and accepted by no mean authority-Yourself. The writer in the Sun is facetious upon the subject of terininahions in 'grammy," and I give him credit for the originality of the conception; at the same time I may say thae there would be no absurdity in supplying the vocabu. Lary of the geographer with the term "geogram," if we had not already the advanteo h hre n ipe I am, Sir, your obedient 5ernve,, AN OXFORD FIRST.-CLASSMAN TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-My grammatical existence is impugned by your graphic correspondent. I hope and trust the threatened crusade against me vill include my elderbrothers-" diagram," "anagram," "epigram," "programme," and the rest of the family. My youth is my only fault, and for that Professor Wheatstone isto blame. I have a better right to live than hundreds of now fully admitted words, and hope long to remain Your nbeaia _" TEL GRAMI. JIUlIUQtD, vat. 1U. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am rather surprised to find you joining In the onslaught which has been made on the new word "telegram." I hope that upon second thoughts, instead of using your giant strength to murder the innocent, you will be disposed to take it by the hand and foster it, and that you will aeknowledge it to be of honest birth, and likely to be avaluable accession to our language. In order to show that "telegram' is an Ml-bred mongrel term, you allege the existence of such wordsas " paragraph," "holograph," "photograph," &a., and you say that if " telegram" is right, these words in deference to it must become "paragram," "hologram," "photogram,"&c. But what do you say to "epigram," "anagram," "diagramn," "monogram ?" Have we any quarrel with these words because they are not "epigraph," "anagraph," diagraph," "monograph T" They are quite sufficient, I think, to protect our young friend "telegram," and moreover, they are of quite as puro birth and as well formed as their cousins in graph. In striotness, words which end in gram have a different meaning from those whiclh end in graph, the former being derived from the Greek substantive 7ypaa, the latter from the Greek verb yp4Ow. Thus, " telegram " is that which is w4tten at a distance, the telegraphic message, whle "telegraph" is that which writes at adistance,vwhether it be a signal poet or an electric battery. I am not saying that this distinction has been always observed in the formation of wvords of this clas, but at any rate no fault can be fwaId with the word telegram on the ground of etymological in,a1cgy, I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

IRELAND. (FROM OJUR OWN CORRSPONDINLT.) DUJBLIN, SATURDAY iORNING. THIE (OVEP-RqM T AND TUE OBANiOEl-NI The effects of the Chancellor's missive to Lorrd Londonderry are already made manifest by the submission of one of the factions which for some mionthB past had lent its aid towards kindling the flame of religious discord in the capital of Ulrter. The Belfast gun club has laid down its arms. A meeting of the members was held on Thursdav night, when, after some discussion, the following resolution was adopted *- "That inasmuch as this club was established solely for mutual self-defence against the attacks of Orange rioters, and as, on tba appeal of the peaceful portion of the population of Belfast, an investigation has been held into the causes of the recent riots which disgraced our town; and as, furthermore, the Government have, through the voice of the Lord Chaucellor, pronounced condemnation on the Orange system and its leaders, the cause of these disturbances, as dangerous to the peace of society, we, willing to believe that the authorities wil afford us henceforth sufficient protection for our lives and properties, do hereby dissolve this self-defensive society, and throw ourselves on the Executive for that protection to which as peaceful citizens we are entitled." The Belfast Mercury, a temperate Protestant journal, referring to the Chancellor's letter, says "I n our paper of the 29th ult. we noticed Lord Enniskiden's examination before the Government Commission, which fally proved the uselessness and mischievous tendency of the Orange Confederation, even on its new and improved organization. It is, undoubtedly, the duty of the Government to discountenance such a confederation, and the rule now announced by the Lord Chancellor is only the revival of one that was formerly in force. If the heads of the confederation acted sensibly and in accordance with the spirit of the age, they would forthwith dissolve an institution that has outlived all practical utility. It only now tends to perpetuate party animodties and to keep alive bad passions." THE IRISIT BANXS. The Dublin Pening Post, in the course of some remarks upon the present monetary crisis in the United States and on the continent, takes cccasion to congratulate the Irish banks upon their prudent and liberal management, and the soundness of credit among the Irish mercantile community:- "At this moment, when the Bank of England has wisely taken the step of again advancing discounts to the minimum, of 6 per cent., and the accounts from America give so distressing an account of the crash among banks and great commerca firms, there is in Ireland complete confidence and general security, although, of course, no one supposes that the terrible derangement abroad will not produce some degree of pressure here." FATAL RAILWAY ACCIDENT A telegIraphic message in Saunders's Newsletter of this day says,- The 7 o'clock up-train from Enniskillen came Into col:.on with a car on the rails near Carrigans, three miles from Derry, which forced it off the line. The fireman fell off the engine and was cut in pieces by the carriages passing over his body. The driver is also killed, but the passengers sustained hut few irjuries. The line is completely bloced CIRtCU)LOCUTIO~.T An unpretending country paper, the Fermansagh Mail, very properly calls public attention to another strikng sample of the working of the Circumlocution-office. The military authorities are, of course, the most competent judges of such matters as are here touched upon; but to mere civilians the wanderings of Her Majesty's 55th Regiment for the Inst month or so are a perfect riddle - " The head-quarters of the 55th Regiment, after a shy of eight or nine days here, marched hence, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Daubeny, on Tuesday, for Dublin. Two companies remained behind to do duty in this garrison. Our readers are aware that we considered the quartering of such a corps here, at the present momentous crisis In India, as most unnecessary and unwarrantable on the part of the authorities. The corps should have gone direct to India from Gibraltar, instead of being brought to this place in the 'out-of-the-way' route vidi Dover, Cork, and the Curnagh. For such a proceeding cui bono i may wel be asked. The revenue of the country is found to have faUen very considerably short of the expenditure during the last fnancisl year; and can it be wondered at when the fundamental principle of our military administration is one of, we cannot term it less than, reckless extravagance? What purpose under the sun could it serve to bring a regiment from Gibraltar here for a few days, by a most circuitous route, when al the nation knew that EnnisWIllen, after being a length of time without anything like a proper military force, little expected the arrival of a regiment just now. A far greater necessity existed for their transport to Calcutta than to Great Britain when they left Gibraltar in the early part of last mouth; and, in our op i nion, it will not be long until their speedy arrival in the East wDl be desiderated by alL" Under the head of "c The Car before the Horse," the CorC Reporter prefers another charge against the "circuml0cution" system, and a curious one it is truly :_ "The Government authorities conduct their arrangements with an uniform confusion which, besides the disgace of the blundering, comes home heavily to our pockets in a very tangible shape. The case of any of the prepara. tions for the transmission of our troops might be taken at random to illustrate the fact; but we may particularize the mode in which the Great Britain was delayed rnd mismanaged. This enormous vessel was chartered by the Government to take two cavalry regiments out to India, of course at a vast cost per diem. Under such circumstances it might be supposed cae would be taken that the troops should be in a fit state of preparation to walk on board the minute the ship was under contract. This would be the common sense courae of doing the business, without either loss of time or money. But the ' Circumlocution-office' begins at the other end, and first having undertaken the expense, and the transport being ready, it then begins to see if the soldiers are in a condition to embark. This ship entered our harbour and was inspected upon the 26th of September, and she was to have sailed upon the 2d of October, but not one of the cavalry had the equipments for a houpon that day to carry with him. The practice wen horse soldiers are to go on distant foreign service, that they transfer their horses with their accoutrements, and take out with them new articles of horse gear, to be used on their arrival. Our provident authorities, when letting the men part with their old saddles, seem to have been forgetful that they would require others in their stead; and accordingly at the eleventh hour orders had to be given for the procurement of nearly a thousand saddles. The demurrage which was incurred by the delay of the vessel, and which, we presume, began to run from the 2d of October, was, we understand, at the rate of 3001. a-day, and she has been delayed six days behind her time, so that in this one particular a dead loss of 1,8001. has been suffered, because the authorities forgot that cavalry soldiers use saddles. Bismillahl / It is wonderful !" TDE BELFAST CUSTOMS' FRAUDS, The following particulars appear in the local papers of Friday:- " The police court, Howard-street, yesterday, was much crowded in consequence of its having been stated that Mr. Henley, who was arrested a few days ago as being connected with the great robbery of tea from Moore's bonded store, would be brought up for examination, and considerable interest was manifested to hear the case. It turned out, however, that there was no investigation there, but Mr. Hunt, R.M, proceeded to the private office of Mr. Hill, Superintendent of Police, in the Police-buildings, Police-square, for the purpose of informing the prisoner of the nature of the offence imputed against him. Mr. Henley had been previously brought down from the gaol in a covered car in custody of the police, who were in waiting, and mr. Hunt at once communicated to him the fact that he was charged with felony and misdemeanour; or, in other words, with aiding and assisting in tampering with goods in a bonded store, and that he nmght prepare for his defence. After consulting with his solidtor, Mr. .Tames M'Lean, the prisoner, with the consent of Mr. Gardiner, solicitor for the Customs in Dublin, who has come down speclally to watch the inquiry, stated that he would be prepared to enter upon his defence on Saturday (to-morrow). Mr. MLean applied for liberty to communicate with the prisoner in the gaol between that day and Saturday in order to arrange for his defence, and Mr. Hunt granted it, and stated that the prisoner was entitled to the privilege of communicating with his attorney ander the circumastances, Mr. M'Lean also applied for hberty to put some questions to the prisoner in the presence of Mr. Thompson, bookkeeper for Messrs. Richard and Jacob Bell, as the prisoner had been himself in the employment of the Messrs. Bell, and the application was at once granted on condition that the question should be put in the presence of Mr. Gardiner. After the questions were put the prisoner was conveyed in a covered car to the gaol, ro wa-rantfo hi comita hain bee mad gaol, thne warraut for bfs ommiattai aving been made out by Mr. Hunt. The investigation will take place at 2 o'clock in the afternoon to-morrow. We may observe that no further information has been obtained as to the whereabouts of Mr. Moore, and the authorities are completely in the dark as to whether he is still in this country, or has succeeded in getting out of it per the Asia for America. " On Friday the magistrates sat in private, and issued a warrant for the apprehension of Andrewv Harbison, a clerk in the employ-ment of Moore. He was arrested shortly afterwards, and conducted to the police-office, and will be examined to-morrow." REFORMATORIES FOR JVEXN-ILE CRYtMNLS. Mr. Serje%nt Berwick, the chairman of the East Riding of the county of Cork, in opening his court on Thursday delivered an able charge to the grand jury, in the course of which the learned gentleman dilated at some length upon the question of secondary punahinnents, and the substitution of penal servitude for the old system of transportation to the colonies. Having touched upon these subjects he proceeded to say: " This leads me to a matter of which I have been for a time thinkin and which I have brought before you more than once. lhat question is the establishment of reformatories for juvenile criminals. So long as transportation continued as the punishment for serious crimes, I ama sorry to say we were all more or less responsible for having sat by quietly without paying that attention to the unfortunate crimninals in this country which feelings of humanity, and in my opinion our duty to God and mans-quired. When a man was transported he was sent to a foreign land. He there remained, rotted and died,unheardof and uncared for. Thathas now, I am hacpy to say, been ut an end to. We are now responsible for criminals from the cradle toths grve. If they te dieharged among us after their sentence expire, unre- chlmed, life and roperty will not be afe. We re therefore now, from se,sh motives, called upon to look about us and see what Is to be done to take ware that that duty wbich we hsve hitherto neglected shall be performed-namely, the establishment of reformatories for criminab before they be discharged upon society. It is a duty which our own selfish feelings, independent of higher and betterinotives, must now force upon us. There is but one way that appears to me-the establishment of reformatories, where young erinmi nDs will be set apa, not for punishment, but for reformation, and from wvhich they will not be discharged until they have given proofs to society that they have been reclaied, and for the future will he honest and industrious citizens. That princple appears to be one which, on the commonest view of the case, is the only remedy for the evil which we have now to anticipate, for two reszons particularly. The firstis thls,-from the juvenile criminal population of this country the whole adult criminal population is derived. t is the seed from which spring up the crop of unfortunate, hardened beings who distract society, and who make us all at times tremble for the consequences of what is going on. I have myself, from a very large experlence in criminal courts arrived at that conclusiou not from abtract speculation, tat from atual experience-o may say daily experience. I have followed up the unfortunate child from the first month of his confinement In gaol for that which can hardly be called a crime, but which the law designates as such-for vagrancy, or, in plain Eneish, begging. I have followed the career of the cMild, and from the training received in gaol I have seen him become a pickpket, a thief, and a burglar, and at last so hardened and epraved that he was beyond human power of savation. The next subject is, whether the recommittals to gaol have the effect of correcting or reforming the offender. I do not mecn to say that there have not been in my experienoe a few instances-solitary instanoes-in which persons have been corrected, and have, after their discharge from gaol, become well-conducted subjects; but as a general pr.iple, in my belief, the imprisoment, even an w llregated gaol-and I have had the advantage in this county of having the experience of a gaol thastis well regulated-but even in such gaola I have satisfied my mind from experienoe that there is no hope for the reformation of a criminal by imprisonment there. I speak now of his beginning in gaol-and that isthe month for vagrancy. The law which enforces imprisonment for vagrancy is,in my mind, a cruel and unjust law. I have long sought to get It altered, and I never shall cease to struggle until I have it established that the child who begs a piece of bread or asks for a halfpenny shall not be considered a criminal,a at pTesent I can answer for it that the month in gaol for vagrancy is the commencement of a training in crime which sticks to the child during the term of his life. If the gaols could be managed as well as one could in the highest flight of fancy have wished the term of imprisonment is stiU never one of reform. One, two, or six months is never sufficaent for training. I would not have occupied your time with these observations, having on more than one occasion pressed the matter on your consideration, and you yoraselves having on one occasion expressed your anxiety tbAt my suggestions should be carried out, if it were not that I can announce to you that there is not only a hope that a reformatory for the juvenfile population of the city and county may be established, but it is in course of for. rnation under the superintendence of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and when such men as these have determined to Carry it out, if .ssisted;they are sure to succeed. It is a society you are all aware which has been established for purposes of charity, and I must say I have more hoe for the success of any experiment of this kind when I find zealous persons such as they are-whose whole object has been works of charity, and who are bound together in the manner that society is-come forward and accept the trust. It will, therefore, be undertaken by Catholics, and will ne. cessarily be a Romaa Catholic institution. I must say, -and it is not only my own opinion but what I have ascer. tained from eminent philanthropists in Enxlgacd, who have adopted the system of reformatories,-thAt it would be impossible to conduct the reformatories efficiently if there were a mixture of creeds in the parties Instructing the children. Mixed education is a most excellent thing among the ordinary classes of society for the time in which they are engaged for school education, but when you come to deal with the whole period of the children's time from morning to night, particularly when you have to deal with their heaTts, it must be done by persons devoted, not merely to their secular, but religions instruction; and It would be therefore impossible to bring persons of different religious persuasions to act harmoniously together in the education of children in one establishment. Eually anxious as I would be to have the Protestant cldren cared for and tended as to have the Romaa Catholl child converted,-I mean converted from wicked. ness to honesty and virtue,-still I am quite satisfied the two ought not to be combined. There cannot be in a system of that description anything tending to what is called proselytism, because each will be independent of the other. When I tell you that this society, who have undertaken the establishment of a reformatory, intend to have a numberof Protestant patrons, all those charitable individuals belonging to the Protestant religion, it will show you that there can be no injury by its being confined to a society who are devoted to the teaching of Roman Catholio children. I have a return of the number of jinvenile convicts who have been in the County Cork Gaol for the last eight months, from the 1st of January to the 30th of Sep. tember, and in the whole of them there are but two Proteatant children. That wiU show you that the great ma. jority, if not almost the whole amount of the criminal population are from the lowest class-are all Roman Cathohcs, I should, however, be very glad if the different counties in the south of Ireland would join together for the purpose of establishing a Protestant reformatory, and I would give the same assistance and support in every way in my power to the one as to the other." THE DAY OF HUnf1I1TIOo, One of the Belfast journals says:_ "A very characteristic sermon was delivered by the Rev. Mr. M'Ilwaine in his church in High-street. After the usual prayers were read, he drew a comparison between irish and Indian idolatry, stating there was something resectable in the latter. they had gorgeous idols to worship there was realy something rational about the idols of the Indians. The religion of heathenism vas respectable when compared with the religion of Romanism. He would ask them what were the idols of Rome-what would they think of those who held their God in their hand, and afterwards eat him? What were the members of the church of Rome doing? There was not an organ of the Catholic religion that was not inviting its followers to rebellion. He went on to ay that the religion of the chrch of Rome was not Christian, and that much of the present miseries and suffer. Ings now endured in India were owing to the encouragement on theo part of the British to idol worship in that country The Northert WThig remarks that the non-issue of daily papers on the day of humiliation is peculiar to Belfast. " But," explains the TPhig, " we are so riotous and religious l" THE FUNDS. Three per Cent, Consols, 88 ; ditto for account, Oct 13, 88R; ditto for new account, Nov 10, 886; New Three per Cent.

This day the magistrates sat in private, and Issued a warrant for the apprehension of Andrew Harbison, a clerk in the employment of Moore. He was arrested shortly afterwards, and conducted to the police-office, and will be examined to-morrow. Moore, whose frauds on the Customs amount to between 5,0001. and (6,0001., is now known to have left Ireland, but it is almost certain that he has not succeeded in getting off by the Asia to America. His defalcations to creditors are variously stated at from 5,0001. to 10,0001. SATURDAY. The persons in custody for the tea fuds were this day remanded till next Wednesday.

THE VACANCY IN THE REPRESENTATIOY OF EAST KENT. CANTERBURY, SATURDAY. A meeting of the Liberal electors of East Kent took place at the Fountain Hotel this afternoon, for the purpose of considering what steps should be taken to obtain the return of a Liberal candidate in the room of Sir Edward Dering, who has resigned his seat. Sir John Tylden occupied the chair, and was supported by Mr. J. A. Warre, M.P., Mlr. E. H. R. Hugessen, M.P., Mr. Mackinnon, ML. Mr. E. R. Rice, MYr. Brockman, Mr. C. Dering, and the Mayor of Canterhury. The meeting was not very numerously attended. Sir John TYLDEN. after referring to the vacancy that had occurred, said that the Liberal party should at once look about them for a gentleman who would represent their views, and rescue tho county from the dictation of Tory landlords. He knew of no one more fitted for the post than Mr. Rice, the late member for Dover. Mr. RICE, though villing to do all he could to aid the Liberal cause, declined coming forwardtofight asingle-handed contest with Mr. Deedes; he thought it would be useless. At the next general election he should have no objection to be put in nomination, because he hoped they would then have a very good chance of success. Mr. HUGEaSE?-, M.P., complained that the register had been neglected, otherwise ho believed theLiberal party to be quite strong enough to carry their candidate. Mr. MlAc;i{?soN, ALP., said it would be wise to postpone the battle until they were sure of victory. He felt convinced Mr. Rice would have no chance of success in a singlehanded contest against Mr. Deedes. One or two of the electors present objected to give way to Mr. Deedes without a struggle, and after some further dis-. cussion it waa determined to adjourn the meeting for a month, and in the meantime Sir John Tylden undertook to ascertain the strength of the party on the register. Nearly 501. was subscribed in the room for the purpose of defraying the cost of the inquiry. Later in the afternoon Mr. DEEDES addressed the electors in the corn-market. He stated that he had received a requisition, with more than l,OOOsignatnresattached, desiring him to come forward in the place of Six Edward Dering. He had much pleasure in complying with that requisition, as he was at all times ready to serve the electors. Mr. Deedes was very warmly received. The general opinion appears to be that he will be returned unopposed,

The engine. driver, after stopping at the first bridge, proceeded on to the water-tank for the purpose of taking in a fresh supply of water. The stoker was at the front of the engine, oiling it, and the driver was attending at the fire. At this moment the internal cylinder of the boiler burst, and the door of the engine strWikng against the ,r stoker, he was forced a distance of 40 or yards up the line, while the driver was blown in a contry diretion, and mnst have gone a considerable beight Into the air, insmuch as he was found at the top of the refreshment room, evidently having been caught in the stomach by the explosion. The other poor feUow was discovered in a frightfully mutilated condition, lying with his face on the ground, his skull completely blown off, together withpart o his foe. His Cp was found some 50 yards further off. The cause of tbhe accident is perfectly inexplicable. Both, the unfortunate men were exoeed. ingly steady and sober, and had a thorough knowledge of their busines. The englne was nearly a new one, and considered perfect in its construction. Mr. Beattie, the super. intendent of the locomotive department of the line, was telegraphed for, and he arrived on the pot two or three hours afterwards. The names of the deceasedare-Renben Thoroughgood and Henry arrell. Both were maried men, and the former leaves two ohildren. At 1 o'clock in the morning an honest was held at the Queen's Arms publichouse, close to the station, before Mr. Sebbeare, the disct coroner Mr. Beattie and Mr. WilHiams, the station-maser, were present, and desirous of affording every Informatlog to the jury. The proceedings wrere rendered much more satisfactory by the fact of One of the jnrymen-Mfr. Sorer, of Basingatoke-being a practical engianeer, John Hodgkiuson said,-I am the foreman of the locomotive department on the South-Western Railway at Southampton. I see to the repairs of the engines, and that theT are m a fit state to go out at the proper time. The engme which left Nine-elms at 6.15 yesterday morning is numbered 139, and is the same engine which took up the goods train at 8.45 last night. On the arrval of the train at Southampton, as was my duty, I examined the engine aDd Its machinery, when I found that everything was right. The engine and machinery were made by the company's servants, and ha been used from that time to the present day. It was almost a new engine. Thoroughgood has been in ths ervice of the oompany three years ; hew as a sober and attentive mn.L The deceased Farrell has been in the company's service about the same time as freman, and was also a soer, stexdy men. He has been employed on the engine that has exploded ever since it was made, and acoomranied Thoronghgood with the up goods train last night. e had never made any complaint as to the engine being a bad one, or that the machinery was in an inef;icient state. I considered that there was a suflicient supply of water from the appearance of the fusible plugs that are inserted at the top os the fire-box. If the boiler had been short of water these plugs must have given way, as they would have got hot and mielted. Mr. Sopor.-Is there not a possibility of those plugs beGoning incandescent? Wltnessa-I never knew one. There was no indication of the boUer plates being over-heated. I have known the fireman for more than 10 yeas. He was a steady, clever maan, and capable of working an engine himself. The proper time for the train to start is 8.45, but it started some 15 or 16 minutes late. I cannot say exactly what is the evaporative power of the engine. Charles Binfield sdd,-I am nilght porter at the Baslngstoke station. I got upon the van next to thoe engine of t e up goods train at the arch and rode with it dQwn to the station. I asked the driver if he oould take any goods on, and he said he could hrdly get along with what he had got. I then told him to drive on to the water stand. That was all that passed between him and me. On reachin the station I got down. Both Thorougbgood and Ferrefll were on the sngine together. They made no remark as to there not belg a proper supply of water. They arrived here at 10 mInutes past 1 o'clock in the morning. Their proper time was five minutes to 12 o'clock. The exlosion took place about 10 minutes after the engine stop Both men appeared perfectly sober. I heard no reason whatever for their more than sual delay. I did not hear them blow off at the sfety valve. I heard the explosion. It was Just like a sharp clap of thunder, and fire flew in every direction. Everything was covered with smoke. I wonder I escaped as I did. I went to Mr. Wil. fiams, the statlonmaster. When I came back some one said, "tHere's one of the poor men." The body had been blown a distancoe of 45 yards from the engine. The train was about the same as unsal; there were 34 trucks. They said they were so heavy they could not take any more on. Edwaird Deane, another porter, said,-I was at the station when the up goods train arrived this morning. I saw Thoroughgood and Farrell on the engine when they came in. They made no remark about the en1ne being out of order, nor did they give any reason for bemg late. They stopped at the water column. I heard steam blowing off, but not so much as I have heard It. Within 10 minutes I heard the explosion. I heard one of the deceased call out just before to the guard " Are you almost ready, John?' That was all I heard. In company with the policeman I found the body of the driver. We searched for the bodies for some time. We had fonnd one, and at length we thought It was just possible that the other body might have blown on the top of the refreshment-room. That was where we found it. I was putting in acask and had placed my lamp on the top of it. Suddeny it was blown off, there was a tremendous explosion, and the next thing I knov about I found myself in the doorwy of the refreshment-room. How I came there I do not know. It was then we heard the noise of something fallng onthe top of the roof, but we thought it might James Tandy said,-I live at Lambeth, and am foreman of the boiler-makers in the service of the South-Western Railway Company. I have seen the engine 139. I superintended the making of the boiler for that engine. I watch the making of boilers through all their processes. I tested the one in question by steam and water pressure. We turned this boiler out about four or five months ago. She has never been in dock since. I have examined the plate; I perceived a rent, but I cannot say how it came there. I cannot give any account of therent. I never sawanything like it before in the whole course of my life. When I examined the slate I found It oompressed and rented, but I cannot account any way for the compression. The boiler is constructed of the very best Yorkshire iron, allowed by all engineers to be the best. My instrutions from the company are to carefully examine every plate that is suppled to the company, and in order to do that more effectuallyl am furnished with a mapffying glass. If I detect the slightest flaw before or after it is operated upon I am to return it to the makers. Mr. Sope..-What is theproportionof defectiveplatesyou find out of a quantity ? Witness.-Very few; indeed, in these Yorks;hire plates not more than 3 or 4 per cent. Mr. Soper.-Have you ever had occasion to take out a defective plate ? Witness.-Never. Mr. Soper.-When was the last time you saw this engine? Witness.-The engines scarcely ever come under my notice except they require repairs, and this one has never been under my repair. Some boilers will last from 12 to 15 ye-ars. Mr. Soper.-What power do you suppose this engine was ? Witness.-I don't know how to calculate the power of a locomotive engine; but I should say about 120-horse-power. Mr. Soper.-Have you come to any conclusion in your own mind as to this accident ? Witness.-In all my experience I never knew before such an accident. I put the very best xsaterial into every boiler. The Coroner.-It seems a mystery. Mr. Soper.-Yes; because more than six inches of this p]at is torn away from the solid materiaL Witness.-The usual test is 1801b. steam on the squAre inch, and 3001b. hydraulic pressure. We have never had but one boiler burst before on this line while Ihave been in the company's service, now ten years, and that was not made by the company's servants. John Smaley said,-I was guard of the up goods train from Southampton last night. We arrived at Basingstoke five minutes after 1 o'clock. I knew Thoroughood and Farrell wel. I have known them ever since they have been in the company's service. They both were sober, steady men. I never saw them drink a glass of ale on the line. They both seemed perfectly satisfied with the engine. I have been with the former driver of this engine, and he liked it very much. We were an hour late. We were 15 minutes behind our time in starting, and I consider that welost the other time on th' road. It is mostlyaup hill, and there was a very strong wind. On arriving at Basingstoke I got out of my van and put out some oysters. Thoroughgood called out to me, " Is there anything else, fthe.r' ana ^ "2AA AAsA1., my son." At this moment therO was a errifc noise, likc a great cannon going off, and something came by me like lightning. I supposed after- wards it wasthe body of the driver. The other poor fellow we found up the line, lying face downwards, with his skull blown off, which we have not been able to find. They were both perfectly sober. The reason, I suppose, why they refused to take any more trucks was because we were late, and had to get out of the way of the mail train. Mr. Beattie, the superintendent of the locomotive department, here intimated that he should be happy as far as he was able to give any information on the sabject. The Jury expressed themselves perfectly satisfied, and said it was clear there could be no blame attachable to the company, and that the deaths of the unfortunate men must have beten causedrby accident. Tdbetiirywasthen terminated by the jury returning a
HIGHWAY ROBBERY.-At the Courthouse, Leeds, on Saturday, a ruffian-looking fellow, named Robert Gibson, was charged with assaulting and robbing William Bentley, a bailiff, living in Paradise-street, Burnley, Lancashire. The prosecutor was attaeked in Larchfield-street, Iunslet, about 12 o'clock on Fridav night, by the prisoner and three other men, who severely il-used him and robbed him of all the money that he possessed and a silk handkerchief. The prisoner was taken into custody about 10 o'clock on Sattrday morning in the market, and he was recognized as a man who had applied for lodgings at an early hour that morning at the police-office, where he remained till nearly 6 o'clock. His identity as one of the men who had committed the robbery was clearly established, and the magistrates committed him for trial at the Yorkshire winter gaol deliverv.

SYke%, blanket manufacturer, of Aldermanburyo Of UPWards of 1,0001. worth of goods, was brought before the LoRD MAyor- for further examiation. MIr. Lewis, jun., ppeared in support of the prosecution, and Yr. Leisu of Malborouglstreet, attended on the part of the prisoner. Mr. Solomon Abraham Hart was further examined by Mr. Lewis jun. as follows :-On the 22d of June I purchased of tle pr!soner 150 toilet quUts at 7s. 6d. each, making an amount of 561. 6s. He gave mne the Invoice and receipt wkich I produoe. Mdr. Lewi, un.-That is the very day on which the goods were obained from my client. Wltness.-I purchased the goods by sample, and the were deliverod at my honse either by the prisoner or hzs man, Peter Ward. On the 26th of June I purchased 300 pars of blanketa of him at the rate of ls. 6d. per lb., and I gave him a check for them, amounting to 189. 7s. 6d. He asked me about 20d. or 214. per lb. for them. On the 4th of August I purchased of him 200 pairs of blankets at 17d. per lb. I paid him the same day for this particular lot Ma 0 other pirs Ls wrapPer .1sl. 10d. Theblankets to the best of my belieF were all paked as if they had come direct from the manufacturer. I had no conversation with the prisoner as to where he got the blankets from. That ia not my business. I did not have any conversation with him about the Camp at Chalons, or anything of that kind, The LoRD M.Yon.-Did you never ak him any question as to where these things came from? Witness.-No, that is not our business The LOnD MAYO.-Then I think it onght to be. Witnew.-We have a very small staff. Your Lordship can see my transactionas in my passbook if you like. The LouD MAYOn.-There ought to be proper precAntions In all busineas transcions. Have you none of these goods in your 3 on now? Wxibess-N Oo, my Lord. Re-examined.-I sold the blankets aceording to the current price, and I have net gained a gresater profit than 10 per cent. upon them. Mr. Lewis, jon.-I now ask for an adjournment for tha purose of proving that the prisoner is not in any way oonnected with ML. Eould, the French Minister. This applics.cion, which was resisted by the prisoner's attorney was at once acceied to by the LORD MAYOR, and the prisoner wvas ainremanded. G D,muAia.-Wllama Charles Vaudin, an elderly man with a dark complexion and Jewish oast of countenance, was charged with obtaining money under false pretenoes. Dr. Robert Martin, one of the physicians of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, said, the prisoner ealled upon him that morning and repeated an application he had previously made to the following effect :-he represented that he was an old cpUl of the hospital, that his name was Vaudin, and he had pen racting as a surgeon in Jersey, where he had met with losses which had reduced him to great distress, and rendered him anxious to prooeed with his family to Canada. He said he was known to several of witness's colleagues at the hospital. Witness asked him to leave his Address when be first came, and he then made inquiries, and found out that he was not Mr. Vaudin of Jersey, and that that gentleman had been very prosperous at Jersey, and was stil residing there Dr Clement Hugh, a physician at the same hospital, said, he knew Mr. Vaudin, of Jersey, perfectly well, and the prisoner was not that gentleman. The prisoner had some time back appiied to him for relief for the purpose of emirating to Cma and he had given him 1s. to get rid of Mr. Charles Godfrey sid, he resided at Jersey, and was well acquainted with Mr. Vandin, who was now living at Jersey. I The prisoner said, hisname w Vaudin, and be had come from Jersey. AIderman Cop=z.N-D sid, it was quite clear that the prisoner was not the person he had represented himself to o, and he had practised an lmsposition upon these gentlemen. H[e should, therefore give him the severest punishment in his power, and should sentence him to three months' imprisonment w;ith hard lahour. The prisoner had made; asimilar application to Dr. Bow.smxx r-hlr. Few, on behalf of the governors of Charing Cross Hospital, waitedi upon Mr. JARDL to state the result of the recent investiation into the alleged misconduct of the porter of the unstitution, who had been accused of drunkenness by a Mr. Sprague, of Villies-atreet, Strand. The circumstances of the case will be remembered. Mr. Few said, that the subject was brought before the governors at their quarterly meeting, when Mr. Sprague, the pollee constable, and the young mLa James (who took the girl out of the water) were in attendanoe. The gentleman who assisted Mr. Sprague in conveying her to the hospital was not present. A full inquiry was made and shorthand notes taken, which he begged now to submit to his worship, together with a copy of the resolutions agreed to by the governors. It must be seen that the evidence completely failed to substantiate the charge against the porter, who, besides having an impediment in his speeoh owring t the loss of part of the roof of his mouth, was suddenly disturbed from asound sloe which tended to confuse him. Mr. Sprague himself had expressed his entire satisfaction with the inquiry, and had acknowledged that the committee had done their duty fairly and promptly in the matter; and, in answer to a question put to him, replied, '"My impression is now that the man wvas not intoxicated." The other witnesses had only considered him ste p id, and not drunk. He (MIr Few) hoped that publicity would he given to these facts The principal resolution referred to was as follows That it is proved bernddoubt, and fnilyadmitted by Mr. 8pra&uo, that the porter was erfecl aober but hanng an impedicient inis speech, and being suddenly arseed from his aleep (his previouo night's rett having been ununsally broken), an entire stranger was noe unlikely =drng a momnentary interview to have regarded him as nuder tho inlece of drink." Mr. JARDDiNE was very bappy that the matter had been cleared up, and doubted not that the press would do justice in the case as usuaL MRLnBoRouGrsTR T.-Henry LaAning Bwa again placed at the bar before Mr. BuLGiiAM, charged with attempting to murder Flemry Clarendon, a young woman of loose character, by cutting her throat, on the morning of the 26th ult., in a house of ill famo. It will be remembered that some dispute having occurred respecting the money the prisoner had given the woman, and which she had resolutely refused to return when demanded, the prisoner had seized hold of her, and, puUing a knife out of his pocket, deliberately cut her throat. The prosecutrix, in appearing against the prisoner on the first examination, having stated that he had stabbed her in the throat and drawn the knife aross it, expressed evident reluctance in going on with the case, but the magistrate very proply remanded the c requiring the fulUest evidence bearng upon the charge and the testimony of the medical ntleman who had attended on the woman when taken to the hospital. The second examin.lion was appointed for Saturday, the 3d inst., on which day the prosecutrix not being forthcoming, and not to be found at her place of residence in Norton-street, Fitzroy-square, Inspector Park made application for a further remand, to give time to the police to trace out this woman, and the prisoner was remanded till Saturday. On the present occasion Inspector Park informed Mr. Bingham that the police had used every means to find the prosecutrix, but without effect at present; he had therefore to request his worship would further remand the prisoner. Mr. BnU-11sAr said, he would remand the prisoner tllU next Saturday, and he should coontinue Ito do so until the prosecutrix should be found. TnAxss.-A poor widow named Mary Speckam came before the magistrate, and stated that she had taken the note written by his worship to Mr. Brooks, the relieving oflicer of the Whitcchapel onion, requesting that the board of guardians would reconsider the decision they had come to on Tuesday last, when they resolved on sending her and her two children to Ireland, of which country she was not a native, and where she had never been in her life; and Mr. Brooks tore up the note and threw away the fragments, and said he did not care for any magistrate's recommendatlons, and that the only choice for her was to come into the workhouee or be passed to her husband's settlement in Ireland. Zr. SELFE said that as the applicant had been born in Whitechapel the relieving officer could not pass her to Ireland until he had ascertained her husband's legal settlement there. The poor woman said she was anxious to go before the hoard of guardians, hut Mr. Brooks, after tearing up the magistrate's note, said he would not allowv her to do so, that no more out-door relief would be given, and that if she came into the union-house she must go to Ireland with her children. Mr. SELFE said, a magistrate's order must be obtained before that could be done, and if the woman's statement was true no magistrate would make the order, although the Whitechapel guardians had determined to remove an Englishwoman to Ireland, which she had never seen, ,molzss voenas. He advised the woman to go with her children into the union, and disregard the threats of the relieving officer. After the publicity given to the case he thought that Mr. Brooks might have waited upon him and made an explanation. If he tore up his (the magistras) note and threatened tosend the woman and her children to Ireland he was a most improper servant of the guardians, and if they sanctioned his conduct they were most improper guardians. The way in which the poor were treates by relieving officers and guardians was most disgraceful, and he regretted that the complaints against the Whitechapel Union had been very numerous, and also his own impotence in these matters. The mag,istratedirected half-a-crown, which had been forwarded for her use by some benevolent individnal, to be given to her, and remarked that her case Was a very hard one.

S0oTEH AUSTRALIAN MAILS.-WVe have received our South Australian papers by the Indus, with dates down to the 16th of July, two days earliertthan that received by "e regular Overland mall tiv Melbourne. Tboy appear in ztis case to have been sent to Singapore, and thence forwarded for the Indian Overland mail. It is understood to be the intention of the authorities in this colony, not certainly of their own free motion, but in obedience to the popular will as exyressed by the Assembly, to refuse to join in tbosteam a rvce rid Suez Rs long as their mails are taken oto hIelbourne; and we learn that a contract had been entered into with the agents of the Australian Auxiliary Steam Clipper Company, but we do not know how far this relates to the mails from England. A principle is certainly a great thing, but our friends in South Austraia are rpaying rather dear for it in this instance, and their merchauts, both here and in tho colony, wvll be put to great inconvenience. In this case their letters would have been received a fortnight ago, and we should have had to wait stiU longer had it not been for this trregular resource, rid Singapore, which will not always oocur. Another mail will be brought by the King Philip, whieh was to sail from Melbourne on the 25th of July, but it wil only have two days' later intelligence from Adelaide. We therefore trust that the colony will find that the arrangements of the mail service were the best for all parties, taking all the difficulties of the case into consideration; and we shall wait with some interest to see how long they wil continue to reject a very considerable benefit merely because they could not obtain a slightly larger one. It is admitted that the mail steamers cannot put into Port Adekide, but if the colony had agreed to the scheme fit msghtj have taken measuree to have them landed at King George's Sound, or perhaps Kangaroo Island, and brought on by a branch steamer at much less expense thmn an independent contract line wWil entail, and with much greater regularity.-suAstraliali and ANezo Zealand Gazue,

A Cork paper of Friday announces the departure of the Great Britain from that port, having on board the whole of the 8th HLssars and the 17th Lancers, besides detachments from other segments. We regret to announce the death -of Admiral Joseph Harrison, of Portsmouth, who died on Wednesday last, aged 67. Re was agallant and much respected officer. He entered the navy on the 25th of July, 1799, as a first.olass volunteer on board the Spider, in which vessel he was made a midshipman on the 1st of January, 1800, and during the short-lived peace he was employed in the Channel and Mediterranean. In March, 1803, he joined the Aurora frigate, and served on the Newfoundland station until transferred to the iPallaa, 42, Captain Lord Cochrane, in Janugry, 1S05. He subsequently served on the West India station in the Merlin sloop and the Northum. beoland, 74, lag of the Hon. Sir Alexander Cocbane.

In M(ay following he was confirmed to the rank of Lieutenant, and afterwards joined the Epervier brig, and served under some of the snest disinguished officers of the day. In November, 1809, le joined the Achille, 74, Captains Sir Richard King, the lion. G. H. Dundas, and A. P. Hollis, and was attached to ler for nearly six years, during which time, besides com. -anding a Spanish gunvessel at the defence of Cadiz, he Served off Toulon, en the coast of Sicily, in the Adriatic, off Cherbourg, and on the South American station. In lS15 andI817 he served in the InconstantandSemiramis frigates, respectively employed off the coast of Afrioa and at Portsmouth, under the oommand of Sir James Yeo. He was promoted to the rank of commander on the 14th of September, 1818, and commanded pro ten. the Challenger, 28-gun frigate. In May, 3829, he was appointed to the command of the Favourite sloop, and served a term in her on the Coast of Afrioa station, during which he was pro. noted to post rank. He retired, with the rank of Bear. Admiral in 1856.

A RAILWAY CARRIAGE ON FIRB. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As an eye witness of a most dangerous accident that occurred on the Great Western Railway this afternoon, from which several people narrowly escaped with their lives, I take the opportunity of urging most serioRsly the establish. ment of some means cf communication between the guard and passengers and enginedriver,-an arrangement which common sense tells us is indispensable if we are to travel safely, but which rallway companies have invariably neglected, except on those occaions when Her Majesty was travelling on their lines, I was a passenger in the up traln which is due at Padding. ton at 5 20 p.m.; we left Slough about 5 p.m., and a shott time after, happening to look out of the window, I saw several people leaning out of the windows of a carriage some distance from me, who were making signals and evidently trying to attract the attention of the engmedriver. I soon perceived that the carriage was on fire, as the smoke begam to curl out between the heads of the afrrighted passengers. We immediately made such signals from our own carriage ss we could with a handkerchief fastened on to an umbrella, hoping that, as we were nearer to the engine, we might succeed in attracting the attention of the driver; all these signals, however, proved vain for at least 20 minutes, and the train whirled along the imprisoned and suffocated passengers at the rate of 40 miles an hour, until, as It ap. proachedLocndon, the speed diminished to about ten miles an hour, as it was preparing to stop at the ticket-platform; we were about 450 yards distant from the part of the platform where we should have stopped, when we saw a police. man on the line; we made signals to him with frantic energy, and were overjoyed to find the speed slacken and the train at last stop, after going about 200 yards. We rushed instantly to rescue the passengeras, some of whom had fainted, and had been cut by the glass which the heat had sent flying in splinters about the carriage; in one minute more flame was darting out of the windows, and in two or three more the whole compartment was full of jlame. The carriage burnt furiously for half an hour, and three out of the four compartments were entirely destroyed. Now, had the train nct stopped till it had reached the platform the passengers, of whorm several were ladies, would have been in their burning prison for at least one minute, and probably one and a half, longer, by which time the flames must have enveloped them; so that I have no hesitatlion in saying that had not the policeman, attracted by ouar frantic signals, stopped the train, when he did, some of the unfortunate passengers must bave been burnt alive, a fate the mere contemplation of which is so horrible that we may be sure that no one of the imprisoned passengers wili ever forget the fearful agony which he endured during the halfhour which elapsed from the time of his discovering the danger to the time when he was placed in safety, and which was en,dured solely because he could not communLicate with the driver. As, by the mercy of God, no injury was inflictod, except. ing the cuts caused by the splinters of glass, the fearful nature of the accident and the perilous position of the passengers will not, perhaps, be fully appreciated, and the public indignation which would have ensued had the accident proved a fatal one, when the cause of-or rather the absence of remody for-the disaster had been explained, will aot be aroused; and so, although no harma has liap. pened, I have explained what I feel sure inust have hap. pened, but for the providential assistance of the policeman, in consequeene of the abserce of communicatloa between the passengers and the driver, in the hope that some of your readers may be induced to adopt my opinion, that the neglect of this precaution is highly criminal, and to act upon it also-should any of them be members of a jury holding an inquest upon the victims of a fatal accident which could be proved to have resulted from this neglectby returning against the manager of the railway a verdiot of manslaughter, on the ground of his culpable and wilful neglect of a precaution so simple, so obvious, and withal so indispensably necessary for the safety of the public. L I remain. Sir. vonr ohnbeli-,t asro.-- J. J. C. I Vot. v. TO THE EDIITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-I have just escaped from a blazlng carriage of tho Great Western Railway. Smoke was perceived rising from the seat on which a lady was sitting, opposite to me, whom I immediately handed to the other end of the carriage, and never more fully approved the broad gauge. By piling cloaks and coats over the burning seat the flamos were for some time kept from rising, but the smoke was suffocating. In the mean. while I set the same lady to scream out of the window, thinking she would do it much better than myself, and she performed to admiration! For miles we went on blasing at d smoking, for no guard could hear; but the alarm at length spread along the train, and it was stopped just near Kecsal.green, only (I believe) bacause they take tickets there. Three carriages were completely burnt. - In hasta. vonrs ohlinnt.iv ilriday Evening. _ SALAMAID ER.

The anual distrhihton of the nationasl edals for drawing among the students of the Schools of Art of the United Xingdom took e in the Manche8ter Town-hall on Friday everng,under ke iresidenery of Earl Gransv-lle The exhibition of the prizedesignaby studet inalal theschools of art in the kingdom haicpreviously been opened at the Manchester School of Art. Ti collecion comprised upwards of 500 specimens, filimg three large rooms. On the occasion of the prze distibation the principal room of tho Town-hall was completely filled with ladlea and gentlemen. Earl Granville s accompanied, as the deputation from London, by the Right Hon. W. F. Cowper, 1KP,, Mr. Redgrave, and Mr. Cole. On the platform were lo the Bihop of Manchester, Mr. W. Dargan (of Dablin), Mr. Cheetham, hfP., Mr. R. IL Philips, d. P., Mr. Joseph Whitworth, Mr. W. Fair. bairn, aud most of the gentlemen who have beea engaged in promoting the anchester School of Artand the Exhibition of Art TeaaureG Mr. jAMUN PoTrm, the chairman of the committee of the Manehester School of Art, commenced the proceedings by explaining that the drawings which had obtained bronze prize medals in the schools of art all over the country were sent up to London, and that silver medals were awarded only to the best of these. Mr. REDGRAVE said, Lord Granville had desired him to explain the couzse adopted in sohools of design or schools of art ia order that the system on which the awards of that evening were made might be properlyunderstood. When tho Government were urged to take up the questioni of instraction in arb,the establishments called Schools of Design, as first instituted, were devoted exclusively to the inatruc. tion of mechanics and ardsans, with a view to improve their knowledge, and thereby the manufscttres of the country. But It was very soon found that this was taking a very limited view of the matter. It was necessary, if we desired to improve the public taste, that we should educate all classes, and especially the consumer, who was to purchase the artices manufactured, as well as the designer and the artisan, 'who were to execute them. Consequently, that hnstrction which had been at first rigidly confined to the artisan classes, was opened to all clssseawhochoseto participatoin it. It was discoveredalmost simultaneously that drawing, if properly taught-the elements of drawing, at leas-exercised a very great influence on general education; that if we taught a boy drawing it enabled him to see better, to copar obetter, and to have a hetter sense of things altogether thn ke -would have by the mere rote learning which had previously been n ractice And, althoughit mightbe somewhat tedious, -erhapshemight be permitted to speak a litle of the general intentions of the Government with regard to the educationof the people in the elements of art generally. (Applause.) A system had been adopted by which educatior was now given in aU schools for the poor, and so given that any town In the kingdom might avail Itself of the opportunity to receive this instruction. Any town which chose to take the trouble of registering 500 students, or 1 per cent. of the population, who were willing to pay 6d. for lnstruction for one year in drawing, might have a mater recommended who would undertake for that small sum the instruction of those 500 children for one year, giving them one lesson per week. The State farther undertook to test this instruction, to see that it was soundly carried on, aud at the end of the year would send an inspector down, and by means of papers from which there was no escape would examine those boys who chose to cqme up for examination. And, to induce them to come up, a small prize ws given to every successful child the prize being of materials that would assist him in the further progress of his art instruction. pMoreover, to give the master au inducement, for every boy who received such a prize a small psymant vas made on his behalf to the master which was In aid of the mere 6d. he had to pay forthe twelve month's instruction. Those who might visit the exhibition of the prize drawings during the week would find amrong the other works of art a copy of the paper given to the boy by the inspector when he came to examine him. It was executed hn presence of the inspector, in a given time, aud by every boy at the same time. It consisted both in free hand drawing, to educate his eye to precise imitation and appreciation, and his hand to wer andalso alittle way In those scientific principles, such as the nature of geometry and perspective which enabled him to sce the relation of tbings to one another, The prizes were also submitted to the in. spection of visitors and it wonldbe seen that although they were al of a valuable nature, and such as the boy could not verywell obtain for himself, the examination papers were such as would absolutely test the progress he had made. This education, therefore, was open especially to the lower classes, and open to all who chose to come up and test their powers, and see whether they were really profiting by the instructon given to them. It was open to any one else besides those who recelved instruction from the masters appointed by the Government, and if they succeeded they would obtain the prizes, although if the master who instructed them was not appointed by the Government he did not receive the reward. This formed what was called the first grade, nd It was an extremely valuable part of public education, not only male but female. A bronze medal was given as a prize to all who were most successful In these prescribed examples. These bronze medals were given at the local competition. Only 30 could be given in any school, and It must be very satisfactory to the people of Manchester to know that their school had this year the whole number of these local medals (applause), while it was the only school throughout the kingdom that had thus distinguished Itself. These drawings were again gathered together in one place-on this occaion it was in London-and two of our most eminent artists, Sir Charles Eastlake and Mr. Maclisa, had assisted him (Mr. Reagrave) in making the award again upon these prize drawings, 100 national medals being pernmtted throughout the whole of the schools in the country, in such proportions as they might happen to fall upon the various schools. It was these national medals that were to be distributed that evening. He very mucu regretted that they were not able that evening to give the students the medal itself, which would be a very handsouie one. In endeavoug to give them the very best work of art that could be dbtained they were obliged to go to the most eminent artists, and the artist on this occasdon happened to be a foreigner. He hoped that on future occasions English art would stand well enongh to produce its own medas, but on this occasion the medal woald be the work of hL Vechte, whose works stood forth preeminent in the great exhibition in Paris, among them being that wonderful shield which was the admiration of all the civilized world, and which was now in the Manchester Exhibition. XS Vechte was engaged to give them one of the finest medals he could produce, and said he was using all his efforts to produce one of his choicest works. On this occasion each prizeholder would receive a certificate, and they would be quite satisfied with the delay when they saw how beautiful their medal would be when it was ready for distribution. (Applause.) He would merely ada, to sum up all that was endeavouring to be done, that in addition to various aids to instruction, which were valuable to all, the Central Department ia L ondon, the Department of Science and Art, were now making efforts to render all that it possessed available and fruitful in the provinces. They had been enabled to collect a most valuable library of art, an especial library of art; and, under very simple conditions, these valuable works, far too important to be bought by individuals, and hardly likely to be bought by provincial towns even, sinoe they were many of them rare and not often in the market-these works were lent, by a sort of circulating library process, to the various schools of art for a short period, with constant changes. Moreover, all that they got in their purchases for the museum at South Kexsington was also circulated in the same way. He had, perhaps, now said enough to show the nature of the assistance given to art instruction throughout the kingdom. He would only say, that all that was being done was not done with the view of educating artists. No doubt artists would come out of such education, but this education was given with a view to produce an intelligent appreciation of art and a right taste in matters of art. He should be pardoned ior addressing one word to the number of students who were before him, and who, he knew, had all been looking at that great exhibition. He could not help saying to them that there was one striking fact observable throughout the works in that exhibition. They would say, perhaps, It was a low fact he was goinlg to remark to them, but it was or,e very valuable for them to notice, and it was the amount of lovinn labour that there was thrLoughout a 11 the works in that exhibition. They could not see a first. class work anywhere that had been done without labour, ard that labour not nmere labour, but loving labour; anld if they would achieve excellence and eminence it was only through this labour they could succeed, Not that they were to rest in labour, but that labour should wait upon the higher qualities of the artist. (Hear, hear.) Let them not thbin they could do it slightly and easily, for it was no easy thing-it was life-long; and if they wanted to rise from mere education in the elements of art to bh artists he was quite sure they must be life-long students. (Loud cheers.) Lord GR.-!vrLnL, who was loudly cheered, said,-Ladies and Gentlemen, the ohairman of the council of this school was good enough to point out rome of the reasons which might have induced MIr. Cowper and myself to attend on this occasion. I can assure you it has been, and I have felt It to he, a duty to attend here. I have felt it to he a duty on several grounds. There is no doubt that any Englishman proud of his country would not willingly OSe any occasion whatsoever to visit this grzeat centre of our manuractures and of our commnerclal progress (cheers) ; and I cannot helpfeelilg it avery greatsatisfactionto be able to call It a duty, and to give that name to my third visit to Manchester this year under the peonliar circumstances with which you havo celebrated artin this great city. (Applause.) But one reason which made me extremely desirous to be here was, that it was tine first illustration of a principle which we have endeavoured to establish, and that is as much as possible to de-ceutralize the action, except where absolutely necessary to centralize it, of the department in London. This being the first instance of the national prizes being distributed in one o! the great towvns of the country, Mr. Cowper and myself both felt it peculiarly incumbent to be present on so interesting an oocason. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Redgrtve has gone so very clearly into what the objects of these schools are that there is little left for me to state. About 15 years ago a very great popular feeling existed, a,d at last manifested itself by appeals to Parliament and the Government to take some steps in reference to a deficiency which was too painfully. apparent. Manchester, which is apt to be foremost in pointing out that which requires reform, and is not slow to sugget a remedy, was, I believe, almost the first town to make this appeal to Parliament and the Government. There is no doubt that the facts fully warranted any appeal of the sort, While wew ere superior to aU other nations in advantages for muanufacture, both in regard to the enormous accumulation of capital and to the cheapness of the material we required, with regard to our maritime position, and with regard to the immensity of our rnineral wealth, at the same time we fthought-and I believe not unjustly-that we equaUed, if we did not surpass, other nations in enorgy and love of honest labour. But there was one point in which our manufacturers were certainly defidcent, when compaued with those of some of our continental neighbours, more especiaUy the French. It was in that finish which art alone can give, and which often imparts greater value to an object tfian the intrinsic value of the material, or even the common labour that is sp]ape upon it X Pff@oQ) Now, 0i4wma N g }hg; lia.b men surely ought to feel was to be remedied. parliament met the quxestion, committees gat, avid the result was, as Mr. Redgrave has explained, that Schoola of Des3ign, as they were finst called, were established. I believe some mistakes were mnade at the outset, but It was felt Uhat some steps were necessary to counteract what bad been the course of this country. Now, what was the reaon of our inferiority to oar French neighbours? I am quite willing to concede the great Imagination of the Frencb, their great cleverness, andl the advantages of a very bright climate, but I deny that there is anything natural in our constitution or our temperament which rmakes it impossible for us, if our talents are properly, developed, to excel Also in art. For more than 1,000 yea-rs the Goverisment of the French nationL have encouraged rmd fostered in every way the art education ofthg l.Th hvdo itn erorf manne. Ther p,some of them poassesng very great tsehaedone It in a manner which I believe was most baneful to the naLtion inL other respects. While erecting enormaous palbaces, lavishing upon them all the treasures of art, they forgot that they were doing it for their self'gloriflca. tion, and draining the poeckets of the people they ought to have encouraged 'to snstaim themselves, to raise themselves ; and, I believe, a bitter penalty was afterwards paid, in that first revoluttion, for these very extensive oppressions. Butx whenx ou take it in the point of art, it is9 impossibl n ot to feltat it did give a great advantage, and that by these in. stitutions, the ornamenting of great putblic buildings, and the collections that were amassed, a great opportunity was given to educate the taste of every Frenchman of every clas in that great conntry. Our own history was of a diferent kina. For some time there was encouragemnent to art from our kings in the same way. In the middle of the last century there was a great movement, and some of our adndirable paiter who then a =Peed, our admirable sculptor F=ans and ohr guished people who were in the habit of travelling or -the continent, having weaLlth and leisure enough to do so, brougt backc a strong feeling for art. But that was never appliedto manufactuLre; and the result, I beleve, was perxectly true, and most certainlygproved at the Exhibition of 1851, that in that respect, and I believe in that respect alone, our manufacturers were decidedly' i- ferior to the manuLfacturers of F'rance. Those are some of the reasons which created the necesity of schools of design. I behoeve it to be of the greatest importance to provide the best copies and examples for every school in the country, and I believe that a provlion of this sort can much imore easily be made, and much more chea2p1y made, byv a central body than would be pogsible by individual efforts. I believe, again, that the training of masters, to supply one Iof the most important deficiencies at this moment felt, and which was still more appaxnt a few years back is what a merely central authority can do. There is another object, -which is to encourage the general taste by the making of collections which may show what the principles of good taste are. I quite admit that thlsis apoint which may be -very muceh abused. I entirely deny,' although a cockney born myself that London has a right to mionopolize advntaes f tissort. But we try as much as possible to avoid that evil, by dissminating through the country parts of the collections, In whatever way mnay bemrost usetul to the country . and we endeavour to extend to ev'ory district. the good which we disclaim wishing to retain exclusively to ourselves. There was another point allnded to by Mr. Redgrave, which I believe to be of the utnoost importance to All and I am, more inclined to dwell upon this, because there is, perhaps, so me deficiencoy in' this respect, in the progres which has been made at Manchester,-I men. with regard to the teaching of elemnentary drawing gene. Tally, mot in the schools ofat where the pIupils are of a Chig!her order, but in the commonx schools of the couLntry. I bleve all that has been said about the advantages of teaching drawing, to be perfectly true, and all the objections that are made to beyprfectly false. I met yesterday in the Exhibition a friend of maine, and one of the most maunificent, intelligent, rand judicious promoters of educa. tion I know, who objected to the universal teaching of drawinag, admitting that drawing was good for maen, ~at it was good for carpenters and joiners, or persons employed in mnfcue,but saying that it was bad for a very lare cls ftoebrought up in our schools-namnely, those gn who were destined to be domestio servants. I believe, even here, that there is no doubt the objection is a fallacy, and if you consider what Mr. Redgra've said about the sort of education which drawing confers, the precision and neatness it leads to, then the sadvantage of this kind of instruction must be very apparent. I believe, after all, there is a design in the cuLtting out of a frock ; and a friend of maine went still further and suggested that, to lay a. knife and fork perfectly parallel to one anotber required the sort of eye which was pe rfected by a rawing-lesson or so. (Laughter.) And, still frther is th e fact agree to by the gener-al assembly of all the schoolmasters at Marlbor-ough-.hotse that, so far from dra ,gtking up time which maight be more advantageousl employed, they found the children who had half of the alotted number of hours given to drawing and half to writing progressed more rapid y in their w-riting than those who were occupied in learning to write durngn the whole of those hours. (Hear, nea.) I beeveo the advantage of this instruction Is great in every class Of lfe and I can assure youlT don't speak in an in. teretewayas being a very eminenLt drauglitsman myself. I learnt to drw whenI was very young, and the result was that I dlrew a certain church, which I used always to t-ake home to may parents, and I don't think it would be quite fair for me to state how many " touches" it received b3fore Itoo.ime home. ("Rear, hear,' and laughter.) I am sorry to tieomitted, until many years later and not man-yyears ago I found myself at Rome. Finding my enjoyment to be very great from the objects of art which are there to be seen, I went to an eminent artist there, who sometimes gave lessons and asked if I was too old to learn to draw. He said, "N'ot at all; he had kmown persons of may age progress very rsiIadeoo~vr itnuse artists " and he begged me to ait down and attempt a sketch. I n'sm. mnediately thought of my old church, and set to reproduce that, adding a cedar or two, and a cottage in the distance.I was not, I Own, very much pleased with the result but I showed it to the artist who took it up and looked at It, and then said, "1On the whoe, I think if I was you I would not take lessons." (Much laughter.) Now, I Aam vain enough, notwithstAnding that discouLragemenat, to think that I have no inherent incapacity for beinig an ordinary draughtsman - but Ido ve,rysincerely regret that that gret usefulness an~d pleasure has beent denied to meo through life from the circumstance of not having attended to it when I was young. And I believe, what may seem paradoxical, that that uatility and that pleasur go on increasig In proportilon as we go down the clusees less rich and less able to avail themselves of urat both for use and for pleasure., I believe, therefore, this elementary drawing to be conferring very great benefit inxdeed on the country at large, and hope it wM progress satisfactoriy An venture to ap ax to those who have worked so hard in the higher ranches of art, also to try to put their shoulders to the wheel and promote this elementary drawing wherever it can he forwarded. (Heair.) I think there is nobody here who will deny that our present Sovereign, together -with Prince Albert, has shown an interest in this subject. (Cheers.) And I remark just now that it is singularly characteristc of the spirit of the present age, an d of the ~s appreciation by the Sovereign of that spirit,tatwtedreas former monarchs worked almost entirely erther for the gratification of theirindividualtaste or for their self-glorification astotheirregastate,lItrustthatinthee5eou ragement from the Crown whi!ch has been given to art, while there Is gret individlual enLjoyment of the thing itself, an encouragement, has also been givent to education, and there has been an endeavour to miake every class of the commiunity co-operate in every manner in the work which was in hand. And I believe there is nothing more evident or thaat has done more good than the example net by the Queen herself, of the very generous use of any object of art in her possession, by circulating it as widely as psil,adltigi be known inu every possible way. The example has been followed, I must say, in a very marked maniner. I may instance the fact of the public instittutions being opn to the people, and established more for the people, an2d also the very fact of this great Ex-hibition of the Art Treaseure of the kingdom, which I believe would hiave been impossible some years ago. The very fact of some of the leadinig men of Ma!ncliester having originated that Exhibition, and the readiness with which they hAve been met and been able to collect from every source the treasures which have been entirely conceaed from the ees of the people for cenituries, shows the sort of impulse 'which is now given to the pu'blic taste, The sprepa of education tendsveyuchti;an there are also othier things. Iwarednthohrdy aLn account of most interesting wodusdbaFrnh n on the union of arts and commre n epriual dwelt upon this point, that be did o idorrvlywe earried on by exiles of lisa own countybeas there was something not fully vital in that but that he did foresee grQAt danger to their supremacy A1 what lie remarkeod was taking placeo in Enagland now, which wa the recrrence to the old simple priniciple of art, and a deterzmination to adapt the ornaraent and the design to the psrts of the object which wasornamented or designed. (Cheers.) But, with regard to thes schools of art, I believe it Ls possible that, in this sort of Institutions, the Indirect effects are much greater than the direct effects. I believe it Is erfectly possible to point out some very tangible results. believe it is a result to find that the students in these schools in the last 10 years have become exactly 10 times more numecrous than. they were 10 years ago. I think it is a result to find tht u educaffoa costs exactlY one-fourth of what it did seven yers ago. I think it is a result to find, as a positive fact, that almost all the most emineant porcelain manufacturers, almost:all the Inest eminent cXbietmakers and upholsteres and paperhangers, and almost all the most eminent ornamental tmetalwork men, have got in their estabILhm-ets at this moment men whom they have drawn from schools of art in different parts of the country. I think this Is a great result, and that from those local examinations, referred to by Mr. Redgrave, You will find that there are not merely many persons now learnIng to draw, but that you have a positlve proof, in the drawings they produce, that they have profited by the lessons. (H ear hear.) The public mind of this country lsengrossedwith one subject at thismoment-the melancholy events which have happened in a far distant dependency of this country. There have been added to a military mutiny, horrors and outrages which have agonized the hearts and minds of every Englishmnan In this country. There are great difficulties In the course which this country has to adopt. There is the stetn, inexorable punishment which must follow upon thosewho have been guiltyofthacefrightfal outrages,-that sort of stern punishment with the view which all right punishment hEa, of effectually deterring others from such fearful crimes. (Hear, hear.) The names of the prieholders were then called over by Mr. Colo, and the certificates of their claim to the medal wea presented to them in succession by Lord Granvile, The foUowing Is an alphabetical list of students rewarded at the national competition, 1857, giving the name, school, stage rewarded, and subject:- A-1- rS w !,10 a,. foliage In outine, bib aeatonical sdy Clark Willtam Wooeter 5 egg plant. ecohe. }aIei.

W F. d on Cem, who rose amid loud applause, saod the general opiion of those waho had examined the works of art that had been exhibited during the last two days had been that those 'works not only showed great proficiency, rntellgenoe, nd tlent in th;e persons who drew or pahited thenm, but were aiso a tribute to the excellence of the atethod adopted In these schools of art, by leading each student, 8syseaicaUlCly from stg to stage through a coptrse rhich was mapped out for him, thuS teacimn art upon scienhtific principles. One of the wnays in which this department combined science and art was by treat. ing art scientifically and treatlng science artistically. He vvould renture to say that the students should persevere, and gain still further distinction upon a futulre occasion. The Lord Bishop of Manchester having taken the chair, The Rev. Canon thICe SOi proposed a vote of thanls to the Lord President of the Council and the Vice-Pxesldent of the Committee on Education. (Cheers.) Mbr. T. BAZLo seconded the motion, which was paeed by acclamaltion, Lord GB.VILLI briefly replied, excpreesing the great gratification which ho had derived from his visit to Man. chester and presence at this meeting. While he, therofore, could not accept their thanks, he thanked them from the bottom of his heart for the singularhospitality and kindness with which they had received a stranger among them. (Loud cheers.) This terminated the proceedings of the evening. The exhibition at the MIanchester School of Art will probably remnain open during this week.
