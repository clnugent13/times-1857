IRELAND. DUBLIN, TuSnmAY MoRNwo. TM RDEB OF MRITIaT. 'The judges took their seats at the usual hour on Monday morning. The case for the Crown, which was understood to have closed on Saturday evening, was reopened for the productioa of the following evidence- Mr. Hughes, examinedb Mr. BRzwsTm.-The polcer scisrors, penknife, andtowel (marked with blood) exhibited were seen by me in Mr. Little's room on the day it was opened. Mr. Hanbur,re-examined.-Had not heard that the plast form door was found open en the morning after the murder; Catherine Campbell wss three months in the oustody of the polce. There were serious suspicions against other persons than Spdllen. A person could close the platformx gate after going out by catching hold of the panelling. James Llesre,, re-examined.-8aw Spollen on the day he s arrested. Saw his moleskin waistcoat and trosezrs thea. They were taken away by 'witnes, Dr. GeoghegAn had them nowr At a quarter Jefore 11 1r. CnuRRAN rose to speakfor the defence. EU would commence by reading for them an extract from the same charge as had been quoted by the Attorney-General, and it was that the jury should divest their mn3ds of evethbing they had heard previous to the trIal. This he al upon them to do upon the anetity of the solemn oath they lad tajoen. He asked the jry io observe the cool levity of manner in which the prisoner's children had ooede forward against him; and he (r. Cur. ran) believed thj, unless their minds were operated upon by someone, tbey would not vlanteer as they id, to gve evide,no in suci a manner. He defiea any one to ay either Luoy or Jtseph Spollen had told the truth. He (Mr CNIn) would move to demonstratlon.tbat aeith6rof those chldrene ould Se believed. Children, said the Attorney Generalj were the best witnesses, for they always told the trath; but, he, faked thema, had they not been children themselves, and did they never dtate falsehoods ? Lucy amd Joseph Spollen1 had aworn to dates and iWdent,; but were they$o be epended upon ? He (the learnedgentlem4in) had himielf hesrd of Mr. Little's murder, but even he could not remember the time or place at which the information reched him. Could, then, children be relied on, who fixed dates with the greatest confidence? He would not make any reference to Mr. Little's murder, and he would admit that the money found was probably taken from the office; buthe would turn to the manner of ingress on which the Crowvn bld mu"!4tress. ThesRivel window could only be openedfromthe inside; and how, then, could a man get in by It I The footsteps of a person seeking admission In this way would also be heard on the roof. Again, those 431. found in the locomotive department and alarge sum in the privy. Now, it would require great strength for a man to carry this and to go down into the privy with such a burden he wouidhave to ran the risk of meeting drovers and others. They had heard that deceased's carotid artery had been out, and it was well known that if this were done everybody at hand would be spattered with blood; and he (Mr. Curran) could not therefore see how the Crown could prove that the murderer got out by the swivel window, for he munst have been sained y the blood, and the traces of it ought to be found oa the window, which was only 10 inches wide; and therefore he must have rubbed the frsmework, upon which no trace of blood or scrape was discovered. Could they place any weight upon the fact that the money was found in a linen bag In the worksbop? Had not other persons acces there as wellas the prisoner? It was said he looked through the wiadow *nen the police were on the preinises; but was this asto'nlshings Would not ouriosity lead him thre, 'sit did pro. ;bWby wany others ? Had the bag beentracedto him? If iJ.weeSpollen's would it not easily have been proved? It ,ae.not clear even that this was part of the money taken by ltf1 jirtolir. Might it not have been anybody's? The Crown ZaOiii l their ce before them, and there was not a part1lO of evidence that this money belonged to the, raUway. Luucy Spollen was an intelligent child, and might she not have been tempted to help in removing her father from this world ? They all knew what woman could do, and was it beZo,ud pzo)bDauity that both tbe children were trongly operdte'tpbn by some one out of view? It was necessary (coiinfunedike learned gentleman) at the enrd of six months to fix dates; ard they found the children giving their evidenoe unhesitatingl. Could they state the thins they did from theirown recoUectiou, and was iton theirteti'monythat the prisoner was to be consigned to an ignominious death? On the 25th of June Lucy Spollen swore her information, in 7hich she said,-" I remember the day of Mr. Little's murder. I sa'w the duster about the house on the day before, but I have not seen it since." That information was red to her on the 26th of June, and more pains could not be taken in impressing on her mind Its contents Every opportunity was given her to correct it, but she made no altration, and yet on the trial she swore dirtly in opposition to the statement in the polios.office. Was it. counsel would ask, on such testimony that the jury could rely? That duster was never seen in the hands of the prisoner; no one ever saw him use it; it never was bandled by the witne2s Joseph Spollen, and yet he came into that court to identify what he never used-to identify it point blank If such testimony were toleratedtherewould be no sf6tyfor htiman life. Now, he (Mr. Currain) would sRupose a c -he would suppose that pollen was the mutderer, and4that he was hiding in the chimney the produce of his plunder, uotild it bo a fair inference to say that his wife, use she was absent at the moment, was therefore a parHicep crilniisi But he (counsel) would deny that the prisoner was in the chimney at all, and all the circumstances of the oase went to prove the fact. It was deposed to that he was seen on the roof of the building. on the 13th November, between 7 and 8 o'clook in the evening, ou one of the brightest nights of the year, the moon being full, ad that at a moment when everytbJng in the railway station ws in full motion-*heii trains were coming In and departing, and numbers of people about the place-was it reaonable to sup. pose that at such a time a man, after committic a mur der, which should be disoovered ahmosi immeday, would expose himself in a position which would be visible from all garts of the building? It was absurd to think he w6old o so. The presiaptios. was that on some other ocoason Spo!len night have been on the roof, and that his being seen there had been turned to account by thoe children, for they had no reoolleotion of day or date, but all that they could fix their minds upon was Mr. Little's murder. That was the word put into their mouths. Did those children when they saw their father on the roof go out to ask him what he was about or what he was doing? Did they pass any remark on their father being there? Did they speak to one another on the matter ? Not one word. Did they ask what their father was doing on the c}imney? Not they; and yet would not that have been the moat natural observation in the world? H4vinv commented at some length on the dis. crepancies in the evidenoe, counsel sid he arraigned the whole of that part of the case as an absurd fabrication. and that if such a circumstance ever took place it must have occurred on another occasion, aud had been applied for the purposes of the present trial, and that all tne im,robabilities of the case were In favour of the prisoner. Was there anything to corroborate the testimony of those witnesses? It would be impoesible to lowerdown the chimney the bucket produced, containing, as was alleged, such a large weight of silver, without leving some mark belhind. No such evidence had been given, and if it existed no doubt the activity of the police wotld have discovered.it. Was there a scratch on the roof ? Was there a slate broken or disturbed? If there bad been the jury would hive hiard so, and therefore he (counsel) waS justified in sayigfthit no credit ought to be given to those witnesses. Counsel proceededto comment on the informations. He asked, was it not ridiculous to suppose that ny one could swear to the identity of a icek of a similar pattern to which thousands wore imported into the country ? He looked upon the witness swearng ao exactly and ipositlvely to this as betraying a negligence aboat the exact quality of his evidence, or, aa betraying a desire to convict his father, as wilfully false. But be looked upon the evidence of the boy, and the same applied to the evidence of. the little girl as unworthy of behef, from the mere fact that they had alleged an absence of conversation with one another, and a total negation of a feeling of curiosity, which was beyond belief, as it was not naturaL He (the learned counsel) now impeached this evidence for the prosecution as the result of the basest of conspiracies between the wife of the prisoner and those children-betweeu the wife of his bosom, and the children, his ofpri-and did not the very probability of this unfit them for belief in a court of justice 9 [At the allusion to his wife the prisoner evinced oonsiderable emotion, lowered his head on to his hands, and hiq face became suffased with a reddish glow, while large beads of perspiration hung on his forebeau. e, however, speedily recovered his composure.j Pointing out the discrepancies between the evidence of the boy, Joseph Spollen, given at the pollce-offioe, as disclosed on the face of the informations, and the evidence given at the table, he psrticularly adverted to the fact that the boy had twice sworn-first at the police-office and then at the table-that he had been at school during the entire week of the murder, and that he had afterwards denied that he had sworn tat he was at school on the day on which Mi. Little was murdered. He arraigned the entire evidence of the children as fabricated, and stated his belief that if the prisoner's caution to the children about the red rag sad chwnois hadbeen given, wichbbe averred it had not, it was nothing more than an anxiety to save himself from being involved by their foolish prattle in the suspicions which had been entertained of a number of persons connected with the railway. Again, he ,would ask, had any connexion been established between the prisoner and the moneythat was found? Was there any human eye, save those of the two unfortunate childrenl, which saw him on the evening of the murder going to or comiing from the terminus? Was he met by any one-any of his fellow vvorkmen lI Not one. Hadnot every one about the premBises access to whbere the money was found?5 Could uot any one who might have stolen the rag from the oottage place the money where the police dis. covered it? And if this were so, what evidence was there agapinsthe prisoner? The finding of the lock had been looked upon by the Attorney-General as of paramount importance in the case; but was it so? Manufactured in hundreds of thousands of the samne pattern, a lock of this Idescription wa incapable of being proved. He hadno douot that they would feel considerable difficelty in coming to the concusion that the lock found in the red lead-which *s also leftuntraced to theprisoner-wasever inthe possna of JamesgSpollen. Did they believe that Joseph Spolleraha no other object than the gratification of am idle curiosity,' taking the key from his father's pocket, and openung the drawer where the eight sovereIgns were laid ? He wotldsa& them rather, when they reollected that this ocured A short time before the prisoner's arrest, was it not more likely that the wretched boy went to tb at drawer for the purpose of maling a ese by the discolouration of two sovereigns ? A grnat deal-in the prisoner's favour turned upon the hamlmer and razor found m the canal. Whoever was the hand that wielded it, the hammer found in the canal was, he firmly believed begond yea or nay, the instrument with whichl the murder was committed. It fitted exactly to the wound. [Bt wasi Spollen's hammer? Here (exhibiting one of the two hammers found in the cottage) was Spollen's hammer. It had a much larger face, and Inspector Ryan. old themn it was too large for the wound on th. head, Mr. Curran then animadverted on the fact that Spolien's c clothes, which were -iven over to Dr. Geoghegan, were nibt produced, and that thA said gentleman wasi not examiod about the razor. Wsa the towel found in the inurdesed mDan's offiae Spollen's? If it belorged to him woidd it'not havebeenemsy of identification?

Let them alc themselve* was this eiidqpoe the natural result of a feeling of justice? WasA, T a feeling of justice that brought Luc Sp9Uxis al9e to,_;n-g1 her father?

' Did th%y believe that waa natural?

Not n a' legal foundation sure, Moral presmption ha nothing to io with the case.

The two roudholes now in the towel were not in it when witness exind the towel in the room.e Mr. Pemberton, chief clerk of Capel-street PolIe-office, examined by Mr. SmiDz-Recollects Lucy Spollen making two informations, one was written by witnese, the other by MIr. Ray. The informatonsa were prepared from his (witness's) notse and Mr. O'])onzell's, and at a subsequent da,they were wly and distinctly reod ever to her. Mr. O'vonnell told her before the rea cg oommenced that if she vdshed anything rltered to state so. She desired no alterationa. Siae did not say it wa three months before the day of Mr. Litt4e's murder since she saw the zag. In hgr informnations she did not gay that her father took the ladder up on the roof after him. On ber second informations leAg wrtten dowvn she was cantioned to correct them if they;wercwrong. Joseph, at the timae he swore his informations, te. ceived the same directions. No alterations were made in. them, except Jw'ere they were interlined. Joseph, 511 stated thathe dtd not see his father after he went out ti he saw him on the roof; he stated this distinctly; he ais' swore that he wenit to school the entire week of the' murder. Mr. W. T. Kirwan, solicitor of the railway company, gave the priaoner a charaoter for quietness, sobriety, and general good cnduct. Mr. BnxWs'T= then replied for the Crown. The view which the counsel for the prisoner, at the Instigation of his client, would lead them to believe was, that the unhappy man at the bar stood accused by means of a conspiracy in which his wife and children were the conspirators. Such a crime, he would hope for the sake of human nature, never did exist, and he hoped to be able to convince thei It was never attempted to be brought abort bY much means and such inatruments. The grat number of witneases who had been examined-no lees than 48 witnesswibadheenproducedfortheCrowx-necerly made the case for the prosecution lengthened; but all these witnesses had been produced for a legitimate purpo6e -for the purpose of brlnging every person connected wit the esta aliaLuent before the jury, and giving an opportunity-for thelz croe-examiuation to the fullest extent. [e wonid prooeed to consider in the first place on what grounds it was that counsel for the prisoner, action on their insuactions, had thought proper to prefer aganst the prisoner's wifethat petty treason of the worst class-a plot to take away. the Wie of her husband by the false swearing of her children-because they did not stop short of attributng acts calculated to show that they were the effeotive instruments in procuring the death of their father. Let the&i consider what grouncs there were for such a charge. He Mfr: Brewster) did not believe that in human-nature, among any nation or people that over existed on the face of the earth, a mother or children could be found to act sa imputed to the wife and children of the prisoner by his counL What was thg act ? To gain a Toward of 35W. by putting the father to deAth. To come there conspirators for the purpose of putting in their pockets the reward of W I. He could not ,trust imself to dwell upon this part of the cae; it was too awful-it was impoeible. e wouldnow proceedi to thefacts of the case, and first all would concur withhim that themnar der was not the esult of a casal accident, but of deibezate plsnandde' n. Comments had beenmadeastothe-non-pro. duction of the towel, and also of thepeauknu1 psorsa,nd. .Sokr untfil this mb,olr,ninO aThey hatee n h VkeriwttheInsp;ossiiiity Theybhad thenlobeenirought to dw te ipossbUiy oany of the thre latt& being 'the'. inutrumentsused by the murderer. Whoever h s came prepared. He brought with him what enabled bimto accomplish his purposs. It was pretty clekrly proved that everybody in the concern, with the exception of those resident there, were cleared off by 6 o'clock on -the evenlng of the 13th of November, and that Mr. Little, who was a person of smngur care, as he was of most undoubted honour andintegrity, waS so devoted to his business that, instead of going home,- he frequeutly remained until 7, sometimes until 9 o'clock. Spollen's house was sonituated that there never could be a light in Mr. Little's rbom without his knowing of it if he only came to his own door for the purpose of looking. There was no man In the companyservice who knew better-none, peraps, dkew so /ell-the means of getting Into the corridor an-into Mr. Little's room, if he did not wish to use the doors and stair. case. He was ten years in the company?s servioe, and for a considerable portion of II had been intruwed ith the entire painting of the roof and with the clening-of the windowF, and knew the minutest details connected with them. That being so, he had either daily or weely the means of kno*ing every circumst3nce connected with them; and the, prisoner was entitled to this admisior, that others knew them also. No one could doubt that the murderer came prepared with his implements, nor could it be douhted that themurderer did not gothroeighthedis'ectots house, as in doi4g so he ran the risk of meeting odme one of the residents at'every step. He did not come casually oraccidentally, bpt designedly and deliberately, with the double purpose bf accomplishing the murder and effecting his.escape. No,human eye could see it unless there- Was some one on the roof before the murderer; if there was he would have turned back before accomplishing his fell object. He arpved at the windovr for the purpose of seeing what wag going on, and that no one else was there. Nobody could tell what the fact was, but nobody could tell who o,mmitted the murder, and therefore a great many of the theories of Mr. Curran were disposed of. The murder having been accomplished, and aportion of the spoi s carried away, they came to the next great cardinal point in the case, and he should ask them to make up their minds on that point. The first question he would ask them to ask themselves was whather the prisoner was at the chimney on thenightof the murder. If he was, theywould ask themselves was he putting anything into that chimney? The person who oommitted the deed knew thatitwouldnotbe a subject of remark for Mr. Little to remain for a long time in. his offire; therefore he was in no hurry. Could there' be any doubtbut that if Mr.,Little heard a knock at the door he would admit the prisoner, whom he knew, and who had been in the ihbit of working in his offlce He Durposwly refrained fromgoing into thehorrible details w ch were so graphically described by Dr. Porter. It was done in sucha systenatic way as to lead to the supposition that the mnTdered man had committed suicide, therefore the reason of bringing the razor, which woald otherwise be unnecessry. Be would admit that therazof rwhich cut the throat wonld have blood on it, but that would not be on' it if it were wiped, and it was not too miuch to asmne that where there was a basin there was a toweli n the rmom, and that It was availed of by the murderer for the purpose of wiping his razor. He did not know whether they remarked an answer given by the little girL She said it was 8 or 7 o'clock when she faw her father at the chimney; thht was an answer like what a child would give. It sbhowed sbe had no power of measuring time by hours,but he (Mr. Brewster)did not care for that; he wouldmeasurethe time by events, not by hours. If the account giveh by-the prisoner of his time for that night were true, why ,was not James Spollen produced to prove it? No one suggested that he was a conspirator against his father's life. le did not say for a moment that there wM not somrecontradiction between the evidence of the children at the police-office and on the present trial. To one whioh was the subject of proper observation on the other side he would refer, and he would even go the ltength of saying that it was legitimate for cour- sel to& say tbat Joseph~ SFo-llenis. sae ut,h tbathe"s-avr his father crossing the line be'ween 5 and 6 o'clock, was made with a view of injurng his father. He hoped that they would never again see evidence taken down in amanner similar to that in whicb it lhad been proved the evidence in the preliminary investigation in that case had been taken by one of the witnesses that day, evidence cooked between the justioe and his clerk. The exact evidence never could be what it ought to be. The circumstance of the stoppage of the ram they oueht not to allow to inffuence them, for, as was remarked by Mr. Curran, the person who hid the money would not go there after it had been discovered. Me also agreed with him that the hammer which was found WaS the instraument by which the deed was committed, and he admitted there was not the slightest evdence to prove that any one ever saw that bammer with the prisoner. He could not concur with Mr. Curran th ththe first rarer was the one that had been employed Hi.s observation was il-founded when he asked, It conceivable that Spollen, if he had eom- zutted the crime,' would have thrown the razor into the canal? Whoever 6oinmitted the murder threw the instruments there in the full expectation that neither the ohe nor the other. rould be found. With respect to tbeI hammer, what ;was the whole value of it in the case? Besdes the hamking- hamtmer, used in his. trade of larig, which it was proved he got since the murder, roellen had had Another for the purpose of his business as a piunter; audwb*r?

N~,oeon is qote a conobaseur in horses e,nd his tcurie contain 1Â°ome of the finest specimens in Europe, aind cost the Imperial treasury a fabulous sum of money.; The horses that go 4ut to-day will wie with any that he now ha in the partlcoilVr use for which they are destined, which is to draw the Imperial carriage on. State occasions, and. their having been bonught at the Emperor's order is another tvidence of tbe high estimate that is begdnning to be placed on Anierican horaes in Europe. Withbi a few i esas Aimerican trotters have,- been mauch souight after by English turfnemi ;. but the Emperor Hapoleon is the first to bhow any appheiation of our fine carriage horses, the rnore showyEtnglsh ones having heretofore been deemed the most desirableoses The circumstances con. nected thewitl buyhinÂ°g of these horses bre a Itetle curiousc nd BÂ° to show the infinenoe a vwoman in France nsay have in ringing horses aswelt als hoops into fashion, provided theIs t Curtand has the ear of. the Emperor, The Marquis de Lavalette, a Senator of France. end one of Louis Napoleon's confidants, is 'married to a pretty young American lady,; formerly Miss Underwood, an d o#sin to ex-Alderman Underwood, iDf the third ward of- tbis city. On the Emperor expressing a wish to buy a. new pair of carriage horses lie consulted ,with D)- ISvalette, who, of course, at the instance of his *ife, aavi8ed him to purchase a pair frofi America, which he gr4ed to do, and the fair American's. relatives were csen as agents to purchase the anmals, with instructions 'tq spare no coat, but to procure the finest, and of the -p rest breed. A notification to this effect was sent tt the senior meAber of the firm of Underwood and Co.? in Boston, who, after some delay, purchased the-horses in utlhand county, Vermbnt, and sent * them on to his brother, the ex-alderman- in this city, to be sent off in the, first steamer that Bailed for HEvare. The adimalsiTrived by wiy of the boat from Troy a frewdays since, and were put in atable in New-street, near Beaver, Iwhere tbey remained until yesterday afternoon, when they were taken on board the Vanderbilt.

For three days they had been compelled to consort with all mianner of vulgar beasts, who had all their lives been drawing milk-waggons, coal-carts, and some had been put to even baser use. The place was cleanly'enough, but would hardly cornpare with the splendid 6curits of the Emperor.

THE. G T ,.STEJ RAIrWAY. TO Tn:B EDITOR OF T#H TIES. Slr,-Under the head "Money-Msrketo ix 2'cTTimesof to-day, you ad4io the holders of Great Western shares, 'instead of xacificing their share in wid alarm, to inEat tute a thorough scrutiny." No advice oould be better. lam not s holder of any of the sharei, but some of my friend$ for whose welfare I am anxious, are large holders; a nd the bost wish that lZoould zeasonbly entertain for them would be thathe areholdersshould now insist on "&thorough sarutin.t . I qulte apse ith.you that " the property has still the elements of a sure althougho perhVp, slow reovery ;" but I think it very questionable whether the directors are right in saying in their report that " it may be presumed that the Great Western' laAlway Company have srrived at their lowest dividend." On the contrary, if money keeps at its present prce fo; two or three Ye more I apprehend even a lower divideud thn one-half per centlor * futaue half. year. -' The present statte of dEars has been foreeen io} a long timp Whlle li4er have been ioomylete, )tÂ± * been paid out of oapital, ad it has been *ery * deatXtf t the opening of mmay portions of aillwy ha beenodeferred for no other oonceivable reasoA than that the opening of them would show-what the directors now confess-'that "ttehex. penses consequent on the development of the new lines appear to have aslorbed more thau the advantages of tble inoreased traffic during the half-year; that ls,4, plain word,, "the me* lineWAre a dPA lOss," There can be no worse policy than that of paying ia. terest out of papital for a single day beyond what is unavoidable. It is not honest to do so. The consequence is a needless increase of dividend-bearing capital for all, future time. Thie shareholders are told that there I still n 4'exoeption of 7,6171." of interest now paid out of capital; that is to say, 15,23U. s.,ear is being added to capital yearly, Instead of being charged to revenue. 121,6001. a-year besides appear tohavebeenaddedto capit for some tlmespast. If this game has been played for only fve years 68$1701. have been added to oapital without one sbilling's worth of property to show for it, and, ialdng It as having been in all -probability borrgwe4 aud rALsed-by preferential shares, the divi. dends and interest, thereon. haye in like,iRamier been thrown away. Theloss.up tor the present time may, per. hAps, betaken at 760,0001, And the future loEs at ful 30,0001. a-year. This requires " scrutiny." It appear by the report that the highest rate, of interest which the dtbpntiir, debt now beos is 61 percent. It has for a lo4g time been matter of common talk that the Great Western Railwayeoompany occasionally issued 1,000. five per cent. bonds at 950.; thus making a permanent addition of 501 totheiz debenture debt without having a shillng to show for it, aad throwing that additional *ebt, on fture shareholder instead of paying for a few, years a rate of interest rather above 6h per cen K The accuracy of this report, and, if accurate, the extent to which this practioe has prevailed, likewise require " scrutiny." At the present time it is of the first 'nportanc to the shareholders that thay should ascertain the exact state of the facts affecting their 23,000,0001. worthb of property, and that, so far as paying interest out of capital and borrowing at a discount are concerned, their capital account should be doeed. It cannot bc expected.that the companywill, under existing circumstances, be able to renew any of their debentute debt which now bears less than 41. 10g. per cent interest at less than 51 per cent.; so that, with the 15 2341 now paid out of capital, there probably may be 35,01. a-year more than at present to pay as interest on debenture debt. This is taking a favourable view, for it assumes thAt they will renew the whole of their 41. 10s. per cent, debt at the same rate. If that were raised to 5M per cent, the increase would be 50,000h. a-year. There is no reason, irrespective of the state of the money. market, wby the company phoild not Pubstituto a 41 per cent. debentsiyo stock for tbhir present debentore debt. 4 debenture stock takes prdeereude of all share capital, Lnd the company have a most ample margin for their debonture creditors. The severest " scrutiny" would probablj end in raising the credit of the companyas borrowers, though I fear it would show that the prospects of tbe ordinary shareholders must for some years be the revorse of exhila. rating. I am sorry to see the directors trying 6n again'the deluaive expectation which they held out last year-that the next haf.yeres dividend will be better than this. Of course it wilL On this as on many other lines the February dividend is greater thna the Augat dividend M i )ly' becanse-people travel more in.theautmn thah they do un the spring. The question Is, what is the prospect of the dividend in August 1858, and the answer to thig question can only be got at by means of a " thormneh saeutlsv2 ". Yotun obediently, N. R Atg. 10. -

PADJAMENTARY INTFLUfGElBoC HOUSE OF LORDS, TuxsDAy, AUGUST U. The LORD CORAikSovLon took his seat on the woolsack at S o'clock J1JDICIAL ARRANGEMENTS. Lord C&MPBELLwished to put a question to his noble and learned friend on the woolsack respteting the report of the commlssIonors appointed by Hor Majesty to inquire whether the number gf judges should be diminished, and what arrangementa ought to be made respecting ijdicial I buess in town and on circuit. He balieved the e4mmis-| dioners bad presented their report some days ago, and he wished to know when it was likely to be laid before Parliaaent, Legidation on the subject during the present session was, of course, wholly out of the question, bht it was iun. I portant that the public mind should be disabused of some of the unfounded notions whih had obtained currency. A rght hon. gentleman, ting no d$ubt upon what he be- I lieved to be authentio information, had again anl again maintained that the judges were little better tha sine. curlsts, that they had nothing to do, and that their number might be diminished with advantage. Having boen a member of the qomnmision he (Lord Campbell) could gay that the subject had received most deliberate and earnest Investigation. The commission had the advantage of two ay members, Sir J. Pakington and Mr. Wilson Patten; and, after a most laborious investigation, they came to the unanimous resolutlon that the number of judges could not be diminished without prejudice to the interests of the coantry. The number of supretoe courts was now the same as in the reign of Edward L, and the number of juidges had been increased by three at the time that Wales was added tko the urisdiotion of the English jrudges. The County Courts had taken away away a good deal of unimportant business which ocetupied but a small portion of the tume of the superior courts; but since the establishment of the County Courts a number of Acts had been passed which geatly inereased the onerous business which the common wjudges were reanired to transact. The commissioners were of opinion that those judgos had now as much to do -if not more-that before the number of judges was Increased. lis noble and leaneed friend on the woolsack had been very severely blamed for advising Her Majstty to appoint puasnepidges when vcncies occurred, bt if his n oble frTend ha,d not givenk such advice he would have fafild in the performance of his duty, for such vacancies could not Lave existed without serious detriment to the public interests. Mauy of his learned friends at the bar weremauh interested in the arrangement of the eircaits, and that was an additional reason for the production of the report with as little delay as possible. Some of those learned gentlemen might feel annoyed at the arrangements proposed, bat the commissioners had done all they could, consistently with the Interests of the public, to obviate private inconvenience. It was desirable that the decision of the commissioners should be made known in an authentic manner as scon as po:sible and he therefore begged to ask his noble and learned friend whether he had received the report, and -hen it was likely to be laid upon the table ? The LORD CHANCELLO0R said, that althoogh he was very glad this qn6stion had been put, he would have been able to give a more decisive answer if he had had notice of IL's noble and lear-ned friend's intention to make the iuquiry. The commissoa was not one issued under the great seal, but under the sign manual, and the report was made to the Secretary of State. He believed the report of the commaisson was in the bands of the Secretary of State, but he (the Lord Chancellor) had not seen It officially, and he was therefore unable to give a distinct answer to bis noble and learned friend's question. He agreed, however, with his noble friend that it was essentIal that at the earliest maoment-if possible before the separation of Parliamentthe report should be laid upon the table. He should have Occasion to see the Secretary of State to-morrow, and he would then, no dbubt, be able to ascertsin when the report was likely to be presented. He was glad his noble asad learned friend had called attention to this subject, because the only point upon which he felt some jusBtfication might be necessary was with regard to the issuing of such a commission at aL The commission was issued, not because the Governmentthoughtthere wasanynecessityforit, butbecouse after tha e pressions of opnion ifrom persons of high autho. rity the Government thought it desirable that the nmatter ahould be fully investigated. He rejoiced to hear that the concluimon at which the commissioners had arrived was that which he had formed-that there was not the least pretence for a diminution, of the number of judges. He had the honour for 11 ears of flling the office of ap nuie judge; and he could say that,. although the labours of those judges might not be qu'ite so arduous as those of the chief justices, yet from the 1st of Ngvember to the commencement of the loug vacation their time waia fully occupied. People were uis. tak4,a If they supposed that because the judges were not actually sitting in ceuart they were therefore unoccupied. There were judgments to be comnparedthere was attendance in chambers; there were various official daties to be performned; and, In fact, the time of a judge was fully occupied for at least nine months in the year. rHs noble and learned friend had adverted to the recommendation he (the Lord Chancellor) had made to Her MaNesty to appoint judges when vacancies had oocurred. It had said that suclh a course was improper pending the inquiry of the oommission. IHe found, however that if the vacancies were not filled up it -oul& bave beea necessary for him to take a course which he knew would have occasioned great dissatisfaction in the provinces-namely, to appoint deputies to performn the duties of judges pro hc vsice, because the diminished number of judges could not possibly have got through the business of the cireuits. He had, therefore, felt it his duty to act upon his belief that there was no superfluity of judges, and to recommend the appointrment of judges to supply the vacancies wbich occurred. He was sensible of thej responsibility of recommending suoh appointments, and he was glad his noble and learned friend approved the course which he had pursued. It would be the duty of the Governmaent immediatey to frame measures to carry out, he would not say all the recommendations of the commissioners, but such portions of them asit s6emed desirable to carry into effect, and such measures would be introduced at the very earliest period of the next session. SALE OF POISONS. Lord CAPBEBLL asked the Lord President of the Couneil what the Government intended to do in reference to the Bill relative to the improper sale of poisons? The Bill had been referred to a seleet committee, who had laboriously investigated the subject, and obtained Important informttion, founded on which certin amendments had been intro. duced into the BilL He wished to know whether the noble earl intended to proceed with the Bill during tho present sesdon or whether It would stand over for consideration until tne next sessio Earl GRANVILLE said, that the select comnmitee had given most patient attention to the Bill, and had amended -t ia several particulrs. It wrould, however, be useless to attempt to proceend with it at that period of the eession, and he thought some advantage would be gained by the Bill beig prnated and circulated in the country during the The following Bills were severally read a third time and passed:-Te Miltia Bill, the Court of Session (Scotlandl BiU, the Genezal Board of Health Contineance Bil, the Attorneys and Solicitors (Colonial Courts) Bill, the fLUicit Distillation (Ireland.) Bill, the Loan Saeieties Bill the Burialgrounds (Scotland) Act (1855) AmendmenLtBill, the Sumumary Proceedings before Justices of the Peace Bill, and the Jurisdiction in Siam Bill. The Municipal Corporatlons Bil passed through comaittee, and the Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Act Arnend. zaent Bill was reported, THE NEW' ZEALAND BILLS. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY moved, as regards the New Zealand Government Act Amendmenr Bill, the New Zealand Loan Goarantee Bill, and the New Zealand Company's Claims Blids being all connected one with another, and the two latter being money Bils and Bils of aid or u X that as it appeared that the said Bils were unavoid- y e'layed inai reaching their lordships' House, in conse. quence of the necessity of commaicating with certain members of the New Zealand Legislature, and from the late period at which the select committee to which the Bius were zeferred reported up,con them to the other House of Parliament, and as great inconvenience would arise to the distant colony of New Zealand if legislation were postponed tilU another year, the circumstances rendering leIslation on the subject msatter of the said Bills wrere of such urgency as to cause the immediate consideration of the same necessary. Lord IEDEBDALE said, he had no objection to the motion. The motion was then agreed to, and the standing order againat the second reading of Bills subsequent to the 7th ist. being suspended the above-maentioned Bill were each reads second time, The Ecclesiastical Commission, c, Bill was brought up from the Commens, and read a first time. The House adjourned at 6 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMIONS, TuEsDAY, AUGUsT U. The SrPAXIZ took the chair at 12 o'clock. NEW ?&EMBEl. MY. M1LLOQ took the oaths and his seat on his election for the borough of Great Yarmouth. Toxards the close of the morming sitting Mr. YoUNG, the other member just returned for the ene place, also re. * ented himseif a the table, and took the oaths and his =ant. PDOBATE AND LETTERS OF ADUlmTpalON On the order of the day being read for the conaderatlon of this Bill as amended, Mr. WESTEHEAD, in lieu of clause 91, moved a clause mslng it obligatory on the acting judge and registrar of sery edalesi>tloal or other court now having jrisdiction robteprobate or dmintion, except the registars of certu eorismentioned in schedule LA~npon receivig reffiton umder the seal of the Court of J?robate, to tnne nilt to the District Court of Probate hi 'which such ocoleedas icnl or othSer court ws locally situte, all records of wilsX rohates,&c, to be deposited lnEch dioeistric r s a o be eay of reference. The ATTORNEY-GENEBRAL thought It would be etter to leave the clase as it stood in the Bil, inamuch as t would be some time before the local receptacles contem. Iated In the proposed clauso would be provided. The clause was withdrawn on tie Attorney.General gIvln n nsurance that the claute in the BUI should be modifed Â¢ 3 as to carry out the object of Mr. Westhead In another )rm. Mr. WESTHEAD then moved a clauee to foNow 109, yving an annual compensation, equl to hf the net profits 3rived by them In respet of mattr ad eauses testaen. r upon au armo gef the IA five yars, t a of tho four advocates in the courts of the provinee of York and diocessof Ripon for their natural lives, for the abolition of their offic64, unlesS they should be appointed registrarsin any of the district courts to be ostablishe& under the B'ILl The ATTORNZY-GENERAL stzenuously opposed the clause, declaring that the line aust be drawn somewhere, and that he woald go no further in the matter of compensa. tion than he had already gone. Mr. WESTHEEAD remindedl tiro House that the positionL of the adfooates of the ecd tical courts of York and Ripon was lpcluliar, that there were but four of them, that they were elntitled to ractise in those c-ourts, and for many years they Wh ti exclusive audienice thete. He submaitted, that as the House had dealt so tenderly with the proctors it was but fair that they should evince equ.al consideration towirds the advocates of the province of York and diocess of Ripon, whose fees and emoluments were about to be abolished by the Bil. The clause wae then put and negatived without a adivson. Mfr. AYRTON moved the following clause, " That every person to whom any compensation shall be grantod under this Act shall, at al times when called upon, be liable to AU Any publi office or situation in England under the Crown for which his previous servicws in any office abolished by this Act may render im eligible- and that if he shall decline, when calle uponi so to d to take uplon hpposel stch ofie orv situaton, wan exeuotno the duties tereo satsfagtorly t bzeing in a PompBe8tentstate of hpeath, then sh alluor,eit hs nht to a y come atiotor adowances whi bch maylhave beengranthe to hit in respeconof such previous servces,under petion19,a nd f th Wab liam The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, without meaning abso- l o oppose the olause, sfao he was of opinion that the ae uoted in it did not apply to ces wjiere compensation swasgtven W. fnder this Bil, for the os of something of value, and not by way of gratitude for past rvice whIch alonu the Act in question had in view. Sir J. GRAHAM said, After the great liberality shown by the House in compewating persons for the abolition of office or emoltument under this Bill, he thought the clause uroosahy hehon mebe fo th Twer Hlamlets would w otad be a hard matter to withdraw it.

For as to these 'reigions-what are they. in fact, but lust, lies, treachery, raurder, andl social degradationI I should like to see our Governmlent cause it to be known that its past forbearance has been abused, and that now Alahomedans and BHindoos must look to it for no sort of countenanoe." l2o wanted to know from sorne member of the Governmeat whether this ws the poliz toobe noted upon in India? [Lord Palmerston made a sign of dissent.l It w;as recommended In The Times by a correspondent siguing himself "A an Anglol.Tdian," w"o was probably a military man, and who sid that 66,000 ditional troops would not suffice for what he very prorl called the reconquest of India. He would not deny that this was an intelligible policy-a cear decded, manly policy of extirpation. It recommended the Government to make war on oaste. He did not speak ofthepreseut Minister for India, but the Government had previously done this, A petition, to which he bad bore referred and which had been reprinted, warned the Governmentn the lst section that the laws they were paing for India were calculated to subvert the social institutions of the people of that country. In an appendix to the papers that had been laid on the table General Hearsey explained that a feeling of apprehension pervaded the minds of the people that the English Government meant to make war on caute. General Hearsey said:- o.Perhaps those Hindoos who are opposed to the marriage of widows in Calcutta are using underhand means to thbwart Government in abolishing the restraintslately'removed by law for the marriage of widows, and conceive if they can make a party of the ignorant classes in the ranks of the army beheve their religion or religious prejudicesa ze eventually to be abolished by force, and by force they are al to be made Christians, and thus, by shaking their faith in Govera. ment, lcse the confidence of their oficrs by inducing Sepoys to commit offences (such as incendiarism} so difficult to put a stop to or prove, they will gain their object" That wasexctly what those who beat understood Indi bad already sAid. The Government had changed the laws of in. heritace and marriage. Why should the Government insist that Hindoo widows should marry again 7 The Hiadoos considered that the law of marriage had been desecrated. If in a court of law they could establish a second marriage they could claim the inheritance which by the ancient law they had lost. Why should men, carrying out a red-tape polioy at their desks, issue an ediot sbvert- ing the ancient laws of hdia? Suttee was rightlyi abolshed. This vas admitted in the native petition, which was signed by many young natives who had embraced Christianity. The right hon. baronet (Sir C. Wood) avowed that he had passed one of these minutes on educa tion. He therefore had to answer in part for what had bapponed, for he had been a party concerned in the intro. duction of this now policy in thie Government of India. He had reoeived a letter from Calcutta, the writer of which, a civilian, said that the East India Government had annexed 12 or 13 new provinces, and yet they had made no addition to the cvil servsats, wbilo they had taken away the military to place them in situations of civil trust. That was not the act of the directors, for it as forced upon them. How could the Government expect that custom, which "o'er-mastered nature," andbent nature to itself, should be got rid of by their little edicts 7 It was the most ridiculous tohcy thiaat a Government possessed of a distant province asd ever pursued. The natives believed that the manufacture of the cartridges was only the consumrmation of a policy that had long been puxsued. He did not Inow whether the right hon. gentleman (Mr. V. Smith) could translate Iindostanee, but he remembered he said that mo one from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas could have anticipated the recent outbreak. Now, he understood that the native paners had been writing sedition for rconths past, and warnlig the Governmaent that something would happen. (Hear, hear.) If the Government wanted toknowwhat ws passing in the minds of the natives they must look at thcae newspapers, which were tbe expositors of their opinions. A friend of his, writing from DeXli said that the circnation of these paper was not large, but that it would be a great mistake to Infer in consequence that the natives did not know of these publications. His friend said that a Moonshee would sometimes read one of these articles to a whole regiment, the men squatting around him to hea.. It was clear thatfrom Christmas last the Government had plain notico of what was going on. Tha the Government had notice in January vas clear from the papers laid before Parliament, and on the 20th of February a native newspaper, published in Meerut, stated that al the mahomedans and Hindoos were agitated in mind, that the natives would not obey the Government, and that the fire of mischief and the flameofdisaffection would be kindled in the Western Provinces. He did not complain that the Government had put down these native papes although he understood they had with great impart -ty also put down the English papers that were enga in writing up the Indian Government. (A. laugh.) But if they found the native newspapers preaching sedition, was it not time to inquire and to act ? (EHea, hear. HTe ha also received aletter, written on the 13th of March by a gentleman in Calcutta, who had been walking about with a revolver, expecting to have histhroat cut. This gentlenau had given a narrative whilchhe had compayedwithathepapers3aid before ParBament, and which was similar to the statement of the Sepoy as to the intention of the matineers at Barrackpore. This skatement made to Lieutenant Allen by a Sepoy on the 7th of February was to the effect tuat a conspiracy existed among the four native regiments at Barrackpore. They determined to rise againsttheir officers, and to plunder Barrackpore. They next proposed to roceed to Calcutta and seize Fort William, or, failing tbat, to take possession of the Treasury. What was the strength of the European regiments at Caloutta to resist this threatened outbreak? His correspondent sid that on the 13th of March the Governor-General, wbom it was part of the conspiracy to seize, had 200 black gentlemen as a guard. She number of white men to ddfend Calcutta on that day was 250. The Sepoys were the sentinels of the outer fort, and in the inner fort a Sepoy and a European soldier were sentinels together. The design was that the Sepoy in the inner fort should shoot the English sentinel, and that the mutineers should then seize the fort and treasure. On the 13th of March there was not a ship of war at Caloutta, nor was there any proteotion for the shipping. The English population were armed by the Government, and formed themselves into a volunteer corp., The King of Sardinia had a shlp of war there, which was laced at the service of the Government. Thus the Covernor-General had evidenoe in January, February, March, and April warning him of the mutinies among the troopa on the subject of religion, and that they said they were determined to die for their religion. The idea had been disseminated ever since 1851 that the Government were making war upon caste, upon the laws of inhertance, and the fundamental csitoms of the Hindoos, and the natives believed that the Government meant to overthrow their religion. Yet on the 7th of February, in the midst of all these Vwarnings, Lord Canning wrote to say that three reSirents might be withdrawn from India for the China war. Inaian troops were also wanted for the war with Persla-a war undertaken with no other plain reason that he had ever heard except that the Shah had not modelled his eplstolary correspondence on the examples of the Politc L;eUr WriWer. (A laugh.) Lord Canning nghtly said that he could not spare more than three regiments, that he daily recehved communications telling him of fresh mutinies, and that he had issued repeated proclamations assuring the people that the last thing the Government intended to do was to meddle with their caste or their religion. Bnt, unfortunately, the people would not now believe these protestations. This was the effect of the radical blunder that had been committed. If they chose to embark in such a poliy as he had described, they ought first to have collected an adequate armed force around them. He had it from high miitary authority that if they really meant to overthrow and root out the institution of caste, according to the recommendation of the writer in Te Times, they must have, not o6,000, but 300,000 men for the purpose. It was clear, therefore, that the nature of their policy was as important an element in this question as the number of their trosps. When the hon. member for Lambeth told them they ought to be governed by the opinions of eminent military men he seemed to forget that when such men gave their oplons they were never acted upon. They a had warnings as to the rotten condition of the Bengal army from Sir C. Napier, from Iord Melville, from Brigadier Jacob, and a dozen other high authorities; but those warnings had remained unheeded, Even General Hearsey told them, quoting the langnage of Lord Metcalfe, '- I fear we shall wake up some finea morning, and find that Her Majesty has lost India," This was the apprehension entertained from the genexal disaffection among the native troops. What advice had the highest military authority given them years ago in regard to Delhi. w'here so many of our countrymen and countrywomen had been cruelly murdered? Why, that for the defence of that great Mahommedan city and its magznes 12,000 men were reqnired-that they ought to have there the means of escort for their convoys, and a force adequate to resist any sudden danger-that Delhi was the grand depot whence supplies had to be drawn for all the stations between the Upper Ganges and the Upper Sutlej, and that the sup plies must be sent from this central point to the Fnn]aband toJullinder untilamore convenient route, id Errachee, had been completed. They had been told, then, that Delhi ought to be mado tbo magazine for their army, their aryllerj, and their treasure; and yet, strange to ay, when the reent outbreak occurred they had not a single European soldier at that most important position. The opinior laid down in a paer written by the eminent authority to whom he had referred was that wherever It was necessary to have their magzines one-sixth of their military force should be composed of Europeans. (Elear, hear.) It was but just to Lord Caunnig to say that he had reported the deficiency of Earopean strength and European control in the native army. But it appeared that the state of the Indian finanes would not permit of the required improvement. They could not afford to bear the charge of two additional captains and two additional lieutenants to eaoh regiment. Who, then, was responsible for alU thisl As long as the House of Commons, when it was about to prorogue, alowed a Ministry to go to war, as in the case of Persia, without the previous sanction of Parliament, we had no security that we might not soon be involved in an European war, while EnglAnd wAs denuded of regular trops. (Hear, hear.) It was stated that Lord Hardinge was afrid to bring the Ben2al army together, on account of the danger of a mutiny. The force on which they had been relying appeared, then, to have been an army of conspirtor I t The arfuls esults that had lately been witnessed were the Inevitable consequenoes of causes -which had been patent to al maen and either the Board of Control, the Court of Directors, Leh looal government of India, or alU of them together, were answerable for disasters which were fairly asaribable to their misohievous policy. They talked of zeconquering India. That was esnier said than done. But did t4ey mean to hold that peninsula, inhabited by superstitious and, It mighht be, fatAod raes, by proclaiming that henceforth eas was a thing nt to be euad, that etbisad custom must be entirelj' subverted and anient la7s supesseded bya E nglish Ministr who chose at any moment to lane froml his desk a code tht did violene to the lcemg-eeri4^;d feelings and nsaa&esof the -peope. The Sepoy wsfcs'sedy rsspacoUnI, docl, an obedint. N'owhe wsinmbocdin and auth. lOULs It wax the budness of the ouse to bentnle te causes that had led to thi change. The officer who had the command of a*ing of the Ma Beglmnt it Calcutta, suspecting an outbreak of disffection, dtd n6o wait for the ditections of his superior, but promptlS, and of his own accord, ordered that one company abonld be kept constutly supplied with 10 rounds of ammunltion, and that the guards should be doubled. Thix officer's name was ajor Clarke; iand he wrote a letter, to his comrade, who commanded another wing at Dumdum, informing him of what might be expected aat Calcutta, and advising him also to have one coipanJ siu plied with ten rounds and to double his uards."ge:t this gentleman was called to acoount for havng adopted these precautions. The same steps were directed to be taken in regard to the small readue of European troops which remained in Fort William. This o=ebsed on the 3d of February, and yet four days afterwards the GovernorGentral was caled upon to send away three regiments. On examining the papers before them hon. meaubers would see how one event influenced another. The hon. and gallaut General opposite (Sir W.Williams), who had been starved ae Kars, was saen by Persaa agents whbe a prisoner in the camp of the Russan neral Mouravieff. War subequently broke out with the Shah. Then c4me "the hostilities," as they were termed, but he called them " the war," with the populous empire of China; And to add to their dificolties they also saw the flames of civil war now raging from one end of theBengal Presidency to the other. By the two first of these wars, in the waging of which the Govorsmeut had taken so much pride, the available military force in India had been seriously weakened; aud yet, for3o0th, they criticized the conduct of their officers and wondered that General Barnard had not done that which they did. not give him the, Indiapeuaeble means to achieve, They talked of voting men and money, of calling out the militia, and then of prorogung Prliament while they were engaged in war agiinst half thehuna rae. Wben hon. members returned to their sgveral homes they would bave to spend their time as many thouands of their fellow.countrymen were now doing-viz., in waiting with aching hearts for the next mail, which might bring with it tidings afflioting to the heart of many an English family. He mnintained, then, that the Government had shown neither watchlulness, foresght, nor judgaent- otherwise tbey would long since have discovered the al state of things in India. If they were determined to adopt the new policy, which was at least intelligible, they paght to have the 56,000 men who the writer he hadp pre. viously quoted said were necessary to reconquer India. Although the House had been told by the Government that they had nothing to do but to vote men and money, he trusted that the day was not fsr distant when the principles and policy by which India was to be governed would be settled and fixed by the House. Whether the principle on which India was to be governed should be somethig more intelligible (hear, hear), more consistent and more rational than the principle of the existing system, or not, he trusted that the Hlonse of Commons, as an integral part of the constitation of this oountry, would exert its authhorit, and that its voice would be heard; And he was sure that if that voice were heard it would he for the good government of India and the consolidation of the power of this oountry. (Cheers.) Mr. V. SMITEI.-Although Her Majestys Government, and, I believe, the House as well as Her Majesty's Government, are very anxious to go into Committee of Sapply, which is the appointed businees for this evening, I cannot let this debate, short and interesting as it has been, pas8 withouLt entering my deOcded protest and my distinct denial of the truth of the assertion made by my hon. friend the member for Aylesbury, and repeated by the hon. and learned member for Enniskillen, that Her Majesty's Governmeat are not consCious of the gravity of the present state of things in India. They are perfectly conscolus of it, and I believe this House Is also conscious of it. I thin we may take the moderate and wie speech of my hon. and gallant frlend the member for Westminster as an instance that, ths House is perfectly conscious of the gravity of the occasion. Bat I should like to know whether the hon. and learned member for FnniskIllen is conscious of the gravity of the occaion, and whether he really thinks it is worthy of the gravity of the occaion to come down here this evening with scraps out of newspapers which he has carefully collated for the parpos of charging them upon the Government as being manifestoes of the Administration. Why, Sir, I thought on hearing the hon. and learned gentleman read a letter from 2Ve Timas newspaper, that the signature would at least have been *' Palmerston," or that my own name would have been the signature, as he appeared to quote it by way of casting reproach upon the Goverament, but it turaed out that the signature to that letter was " Anglo-Indian." He says that the " Anglo-Indian" wishes to put down caste, and throughout the whole of his speech he laboured to show that there was somebody in this country who was disposed to put down caste. He did me the honour to allude to me. He said that I supposed I could sit at my desk and write a little law which would govern India. Where does the hon. and learned gentleman find proof that I ever had such a notion ? He disd not adducothe slightest eviAence to prove that I ever had any such immodesty or presumption as to suppose that I coald sit at my desk and write a little law which could govern India. I have, on the contrary, on al occasions expressed a very different opinion in the Iouse of Commoins with reference to the government of Indas. I have always been as anxious as any maa could be to express my opinion that India could not be goverued by any such means. I therefore repudiate altogether tbe assertion of the hon, and learned gentleman ahit thoreTiy sucL scheme on the part of the Govermment as that of putting down caste and counteracting and destroying all the priwciples by which we have hitherto governed the people of India. The hon. and learned gentleman says, and very truly, that this is a sad subject. It is one respecting which he has heard sad accounts even since he spoke last; and I must say that he has this evening repeated almost word for word what he said on the last occasion when this subject was before the House. There is not a syllable in the speech whioh he has just delivered which might not be found in the speech which he made on the motion of the right hon. gentleman the member for Backnghamshire, and which, in my opinion, was a much abler speech than that of this evening. But he has heard sad stories-that is to say, ho has heard one or two such stories, but I believe that I have myself heard 100 sad stories for every one that he has heard. And therefore, if inclined to take that tone, I should be just as able as the hon. and learned gentleman to give sad accounts of the present atate of India; but Her Majeety's Government, while they feel sincerely and deeply upon that subject, believe that it wonld not become them to come down to this House to speak in a tone of melancholy despondency, and excite additional alarm in the minds of all British subjects with regard to our possessions In India, and the misfortunes that are occurring there. I do not think that tha would at all become the Government of this country. The hon. and learned gentleman did nothing throughouttthe whole of his speech but elaborate all those questions which we have already discussed. I can only repeat what I said on the last occasion, that for all that has occurred in India the whole country is just as responsible as any Government, whether the present or any of Its predecessors. I do not wish to throw any responsibility attaching t a person who holds my position upon any other human being. But if the hon. and learned gentleman wishes to treat this subject in a philosophic and statesmanlike manner he should consider what has been passing in this country for the last ten years. The whole of this country has during that period been bent upon what is caled the hmprvoement of the condition of India and its inhabitants. We may have been wrong; but everyone that ever thought of India has urged upon us the moral and even the religions improvement of India. If we went rather slowly then we were charged with being impeded by antiquated notions, and if to avoid the reproach of going too slowly we have gone fawter, suely It is hard that you should tarn round upon us and say" You have gone a great deal too fast-why did you meddle with these things ?" Not only the present, but every preceeding Government that has existed since Iadla came into our possession has been constantly charged throughout the whole of England with governing India on too slow and antiquated a system. I think the hon. and learned gentle. man has idly wasted his powers in throwing out geneal abuse against al persons who have been members of the Government for the last l0 or 20 years. When lasked him wb.ther he charged me with being respondble for the present state of India he said that he did not. He declines to make an. attack upon any particular member of the Government, and his declamation has nothing to do with the present Government. But he says for aU these things we have no redress and no inquiry. I say, have as much inquiry as you will - but what you have to do at 1.reeont is to put out the fire wzich is now raging over India. (Loud eheers.) After you have quenched it, then have inquiry till you sicken of it. I should be iner happiy to assist the hon. and learned gentleman in a future session of Parliamoent, if he wishes to have an ineuiry upon the state of India-if he wishes to have a committee, if he wishes to bringIn a Bill, if hoewishes totakeany measre by which Parliament can improve the stte of India. The hon. and learned gentlemen complains that Her Majest's Government only come forward to ask for men and money. Why, that is al that can be of any avail at present aud I believe that the hon. gentlemen who dt on ifat as well as on this side of the House ae perfectly willing to give us men and money for the occasion. (Cheers.) On that subject I believe there is but one voice. I really mean no disrespect to the hon. and learned gentle. man, because 1 hbava the greatest admiration for the lively eloquence with which he entertins this House; but I cannotlielp thinking that his objeot in making a specwh on this occasion, just as we ae breakdng up, is more to afford himn self the consolation of thinking that he may be the more pleasantly remembered by us dung the recess than to make suggestions for the improvement of the state 9f thin in India. As faras regards the things whichj he has mem.oned he has not shown that great assiduity in obtainng informaation whicih I think generally charterizes allihat he Bays. For instance, he says that we have committed a great fault with respect to Eindoo marriages, and that our coure in that regard has been offensive to the people of India. Is he aware that the Act with respect to that subject arose from a petition very numerously igned by Hindoos? That petition stated, and very fairly and reasonably, that as we had put an end to the burning of widows upon- the death of their husbands, It was only rlght that they should be per. mitted to maarry again-that if we gave them existence by one law, they should not by another law have the manner of that existenoe interfered with. That change in the law with regard to widows hu by no mes had the effect attributed to It by the hon. and learned gentleman. It may be one of those sabjesta upon which the Legislature has rather invaded the privileges of the Hindoos, but it Is not the only one. On the contry, it merely indiasteewhathas ben the tendency of modeen l o, But au of axad8en we have, it appears, fouid out that we have been g too fSt, Thehon. adleurn6dvallemmxvithat thlgard to thls ontbr} it0 fo ret1 6 h reutmon, no activity has been shown on the part o the Indian Government * ut I think be is entirely mnistaken. The hon. and learnedgentle. 3man sayswe knew of this outbreak on the 6th of Febrary. [Mr. Whiteside.-I said the Government in India were arwsse of it in Februry.] Well, the Gcvernbiit took tbe most effective steps to put an end to It. The Goven, ment of India disbanded the troops at CAcatta. When we heard of the refusal of the cartridges by the native army we aiso heard that punishment bad been inflicted for that refusaL There was therefore no reason why the Gofenmment in this country should suppose that any outbreak was likely to occur in India. The hon. and learned ge&tletnan has quoted 5uthorities, most of them anonymous, to prove that the Government ougbt to have anticipated thf mu tiny, but I think I may quote as authorities the Governor-General of Indis and the Comnmander-in-Chief of India to prove that those vessels wrhich the hon. ana learned gentleman sys were so necessary at Calcutta werer not at all required by them, and that they did not require the army which he speaks of. The quotation which he has roepated til3 evening from Lord Canning's despatch to the Gvermment tells for us rather than against us. I do not think it necesary to go tlrough al those other charges rhich he has renewed agamnst the Government this evening. He brought forward the opinion of Sir Charles Napier-a most excellent authority, no doubit, upon malitary matters - butI was rather surprised that he qnoted his opinions with regard to Delhi. because Sir Charles Napier recommended that there should be a largo garrison and arsenal at Delhi NZow, that is one of the greatest misfortunes that we have bad to encounter during this outbreak, for Delhi has there. by been made the focus for all the miutneer to resort to. They have there obtained pomsssion of powder and ammui tion, which have been the great cause of their being able to sustrin themselves against us. But Sir C. Napierrecommended that there should be 12 native rents stationed at Delhi. But as regards Delhi there is nothing new in the policy of the Government. It hu alwa been the established policy of the Indian Govermient not to keep uropeax forces at Delhi on Acount of thextreme unwholet romenew of the place and its neighbourhood. and stimore from fear of a collision betweea the King of Delhi and the persons around him and the luropean troops stationed there. I do not think that the hon. and learned gentleman has in any way saustined his acousations against the Indian Government. I defy any man to point oat in any of the documents relating to India Any pasage showin that my Lord Canning has been in fault on this occasion. I believe that throughout these transacons ho has shown the greatest posible judgment. All persons with whom rI speak vwho ar well acqunted with India say that he has exhibited the greatest vigour and personal courage that could be expected from any man In his position. (Cheers.) That I beheve to be- the undenied And undeniable fact as regards Lord Canning. Thre tnay be some expressions of distrust with regard to India in the letters addressed by Sir C. Napier to Lord Hardinge, but I belleve that any mm would have been denounced As a madman or a vidonary who bad hinted that sttch an outbreak as that which has occr:red would occur in India. (Hear, hear.) I believe that that outbreak can by no means be attributed to any want of foresight on the part of tho Governor-General. I believe I have now answered inost of the points whlih have been mentioned. I may remind the Iouow that we bave already had a long debate upon this sabject; And I thnk any hon. gentleman who could introduce any ner fact or amuments into its discussion must be gifted with great livelines of imagination. With reference to the obwervations of the hon. and gallant member for Westmin. ster (Sir D. L. Evans), I mu ay the Government are most tbankful for any suggestions offered to them by one who possesses his mriRtary experience and I only wish that he had favoured us with his opinions as to the reorganization of the Indian rmy-a subject upon which he would be an excellent authority. I am, however, desirous of correcting one error into which the hon. and gallant member has fallen with regard to the manner in which the troops were sent out. They were not aIl sent out in Balling shiPW and it was not from motives of economy that any of them were sent in sailing ships. A question arose whether scerw steamers or sailing ships were best adapted for the conveyance of the troops, and it was thought on the whole most advisable to send many of them in sailing shis, or clippers, and the remainder in auxiliary screw steamers. Twelve Auxiliary scrow steamers have been sent out, and aU the ships are ander a penalty to make the voyage in a certain number of days. They will arrive at a period when the climate will be best sitted to Europeansand Ihope that, arriving by derees, and pouring up the country, the disaffected vwill be astonished at the apparently perpetual invasion of fresh European troops, (Hear, hear.) I believe that the arrival of those forces in India wil produco a rat effect upon the minds of the native population. Mynobte *lend has assigned reasons against conveying troops to India across the sthmus of Suez, and I may add that I believe the passage of the Red Sea at this season of the year would be attended with the most injurious consequences to the health of Europeans. (Hear, hear.) Considering the impossibility of any previous arrangerents, and the difficulty or conveying troops across the Ithmts witbout suoh arngements, it was deemed advisable to send them by the usual route. I can awsure the House that the Government are acquitted, in their own consciences, of any neglect to avail themselves of the best means of pouring troops into India. (Hear, hear.) I may observe that, in additioL to theurzopean troops, our forces wil be increased by a large number of the Punjab levies, consisting of different clases and races, to the amount of some 40,000 men, who wil bereadyto act gsaint the mutineers, and upon whose loyalty, according toBr gadier Chamberlain and the offlcers by whom they have been organized, full reliance may be placed. I was glad to hear from the hon. and allant member (Sir D. L :Evans) a trbute to the merits of of the two ^Lasrences and other distinguished officers in India. They are men in an exalted Poaitlon, but I could alMr detil to t ie House act s heroism nob only uon the qart of ouhncers of every rani-brygedhera, captlins, and younm lieutenants (cheers), but also on the part of civil srvantgs-maRistrater and others (choerso-as would gladden the hearts of Enlimen, and render hem stll more proud of their countrymen. (Cheers ho mr. edIBrAie L-I wish to make a few osHervat,ons upon the question brought under our notice by the hon. and gallant member for Westminster, andto recall the attention of the ouse to tihe real subject under discuson. At the same time, I musts ay I am rather surprised at the tone aasumed by the Pcrosident of the Board of Control in reply to my hon. and learned friend. It is not, I thin, at all stuprising that, in the present emergency, my hon. and ]earned friend, or any other member of -his HOUsE, should eizie upon an opportunity of dilating on the causes of the sate of affairs in our Indian emptre, and denouncing the systsem of misgovernment which has thero eprted. But what is the rejoinder of my right hon. friend? e sys - "I object to sach comments, because you are not making this a party quesidon. Your criticisms apply not only to the present but to preceding Governmentis. They don't touch me any more than other people, tf sO much. Don't waste yonr tffme in adducing arguments to show that a most impoHasnt dependency of tho empire has been misgoverned, but make a party attack" Why, we are always told we are making party attacks. It has boen said that the House of Commons is converted into a Scene of party wrarfare; hut when an hon. gentleman, speaking with knowvledge and feeling upon the subject of India, tries to discriminate the causes and reasons which have brought about the present portentous state of affairs, he isi complained of because he ts not making a party attack. I think the House is much indebted to the gaiant veterain (Sir D. 1o E vans) who has called attention to this subOect. (Che3r.) It is one thati ought to ocupy our attention, whatever maybse the pressure of public business. Indeed, nopubl'i business cat be more pCessing. I cannot say that the esawer of the noble lord was so satisfactory as I could have desired. I must observe of the noble lord's reply that he vnderrated our position in India, and overrated the disposi. tion of Europe; and those are very dangerous sentiments Â°r thenpofrthe a Prime Minister of this coantry. I agree with the orn, baronet the member for Buckingmiam, that the state of affairs is most grave; and I think it is much to be regretted that from the orst, on tbh part both of the Go. vernmient and of the countr-the country, of course, taking its tone from the Government-there has not been a due sense of thhevast and imminent danger to our empire and to our national power which in my onsCience I believe to eist, and whioh, though it oolght not t;o aippa , is one for which we should bethoroughly prepard I think there is no mistake so great on the part of aA Minister 5r to undervalue public peril. Certalnly there is no greater mistake on the part of anEnglish Mlinister. The English nation Is never so grest as in the moment of adversity. In prosperity it may boe accused, and very justly of being ostentatious and, perhaps, insolent; in its middle fortunes it may often prove itself unreasonable; hut there never has been a time when a great sense of responsbility has been thrown upon the people of this oountry when they have not nswerei to the occasion, and shown that ratch. less energy which has made, and will maintain, their position as the leading nation of the world. (Cheers) The opinion of the noble lord, however, swems to be either that the emergency is not so great as I believe, or that if it is so we should veiT its hideous proportions from the people of this country. In either case Ithinkthe noble lords opinion is erroneous. The noble lord says to-night-'"This Is an affair of pounds, shillings, and penecm We ae going to do something, but more we cannot do, because we muSt look to the zesources at our disposaL" Now, that is not a proper tone to take. I: the noble lord really believes the empire is in danger it is not becoming i him to say that tshe rc0esures at his dispos l are limited, and that the meus adopts in such a great emergency must of course be of a proportionate charater. I don't wn at al to reopen the controversy which I raied about a fortnight ago. The ve which I then expressed were not lightly asumed, nor can they be answred by the incidents of the hour. Time and thought must be the test of their soundness and authenticity. But as the question has been reopened both b my hon. and learned friend and by the right hon. gentleman, I my be permitted to make one or two observations. Ithink I have a right to say that nothing that has oocurred since that dobate-none of the Information w7hich was reached us from India-has at all refuted the views I then, with great huni. lity, placed before the House. Upon that eccasion the right hon. gentleman took me to task because I had endeasoured to poit out the causes which had led to an understanding betw en the indoo and MLhoemedan princes, and because I had intimated that they were distisfied with the Governmentof India. The right hon. tlean then sid thatno proof whatever was in the posessdon of the Government that any such feeling ext en the tpx of the native pre, a thatI hao vernmeut of one dltlor of the Isian princes.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, Auausz 12, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, The LoOBD OC}IxoBmo, in reply tq Lord CApcmL. stated that the Government proposed next esdon to introduce a measure based upon some oE tfhe recommendations of the Comm;ssioners appoiuted to inquire into the expedienoy of adjusting 'the circuits and making other judicial arrange'ments. Several Bills were forwarded a stage, after which their Lordahips adjourned. In the Honse of Commons, at the early sitting, 'the Prob*tes and Letters of Ad tnistion Bill, a .amended in the oommittee, was conaidered. A new clause, moved by Mr. AXB ON, enting that every perser compensated under 4ie Act shall be liable to fill any public offiee under the Crown -for which his previous servicesin any ofice abolished by the Act may render hib eligible, was agreed to, and added to the BilL The consideration of a great variety of amend=nxeuts proposed to be made in the original claus of -the Bill, some of which were adopted and othem ,rejected, occupied the remainder of the sitting. The Revising Barristers (Dublin) Bil pAssed through committee. In the evening, Mr. DisunA. inquired whether there was any ,;rospect of an amidable settlement of the existing diiferences between England and France on the .-s3ubject of the Danubian Prc.palities, and whether there was any apprehension of all estrangement of feeling between tie two Governmen,ts Lord PAMEsrON said, there had been differences at Constantinople, not arising out of the question -of union or disunion of the Principalities, but in xegard to the regularity or irregularity of the elections in Moldavia, which it had been thought were not in accordance with the law. This had been represented to the Ministers of the Powera at Con-stntinople, and four of them-thoso of Frances Russia, Prussia, and Sardinia, aoting separately, and not with those of England and Austria, had called upon the Tt .kish Government to annul the * elections, and cause the electoral lists to be revised in order that the elections might be made over again. The Turkish Government had declined to comply with this request; misun*-derstandings had arisen, and the result was that the Ministers of France, Russia, Prussia, and Sardinia bad taken down their flags, and interrupted relations with the PoaE, or were about to do so. The recent visit of the Emperor of the FRENCn, to *Osborne accompanied by his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lad afforded the English Govermment an opportunity to come to a full understanding with that of France upon the subject, and they -thought there was sufficient primd facie ground for the misunderstanding to make it desirable, in the interest of the PoRTX, that the elections should be -held over again. They had reason to believe that the Austrian Government took a similar view of the sub.ject, and that the SULTAN would adopt the course -they recommended-namely, to annul the elections, in order that they might take place again. There was no ground whatever for any apprehension of a *divrgence between the English and French Governments that would interrupt the existing harmony and good understanding. In reply to Mr. SrooNER, Lord PALmEsorow said, there was no foundation fer the report of the arrival of the Indian mail. On the order for going into a Committee of Supply, Sir Dx LACY EvANs drew attention to the military arrangements for meeting the contingency in the Bengal native army, taking a tomprehensive view of the possible effects of the events in India *-upon the interests of the country, foreign and domestic. Lord PAsio wsror made a detailed reply to the suggestionsof Sir DzLAcY, to whose opinions, hesad, he had listened with the respect and deference due to his high military character. Re had, however, iu his opinion, over estimated the European difficulty that might be produced by the events in India. The nations of the world had seen with what an unanimous spirit and energy the British people had responded to the call which the Government made to them in a moment of national emergency. While some 30,000 troops had been sent to India, troops were being raised at home as * fast as possible; and not only was the regular army being increased, but a portion of the militia was about to be embodied. Recent events in India were undoubtedly serious, but, as far as Europe and foreign countries were concerned, nothing had oc- cured to alter the conditions of peace. He assured Sir Dx LACY and the House that while the Government were at present doing all they thought necesBuy to meet the difficulty, not going beyond the neceasity, if events should take a turn different from rhat they expected they felt they had at hand the resouFce of calling Parliament together and asking for additioTnal means of national defence. The discusaion, which assumed a discnrsive character, was continued by Colonel NonTr, Mr. BXNTLNOK, Sir E. VEp_NZy, Mr. NZWDZOATE, and Mr. WIlLIAmS. Mr. WHITmThE reviewed the causes of the Indian mutiny, and the conduct and policy of the Government of India, contending that the former had been the natural and inevitable consequence of the latter. 'There had been, he said, no foresight, no watchfulmees, no judgment shown by the Government. Mr. V. Sxmr entered his protest against the asertion, which he denied, that the Government were not aware of the gravity of the events in India, and asked whether it was worthy of that gravity for a member to come down, asa s. WwFrB SIDu had done, with craps of newspapers, and to found upon anonymouS statements charges against the Government of India, the conduct and policy -of which Mr. S3nTH defended, commending tbh judgment and vigour displayed by Lord CANNIG. Mr. D=Aw said, he was surprised at the tone adopted by Mr. Sarr, who seemed to obj6cd to the criticisms upon the Indian Government because this -wa not made a party question. He did not thinlk the answer given to Sir DE] LACY EvANs by Lord PAj.stsrox satisactory; he haa underrated our osition in India and overrated odr; position in Europe, aud no mistake could be greater than to undervalue the national danger. Nothing, he ob- served, had occurred since hi& recent bpeech.upon the subjetof Indiatorefute theopiniwithenaexpdj th4t the-outbreak was not a m andtat one:of its causes was the tampering by, the Injdivn 'Legi_pture with. a religia, prthjudiiew of the peo,$e.: Ie warned' -the overnenetthatverp'. thigpg-dQ.ended upn. the second c'anpaign, -which w104d_cprmn I1nee in November; if our energy and resources were adequate it might re'-sttblish out empire upon a firmer foundation; bul if that WaU-' paignshould prove unfortunate, ald a thrd-rwa entered upon, wa should have etl.rs to cont6ni with besides the princes of India. The Governor. General, he remarked, wa not in Isolted individual; he waa surrounded bv men- the Council of Idia-whose conceit and arrogance had en-- dangered our Indian empire, aid who oig}ht to be called to account. From India .DIsiAA turned to Turkish politics, accusing Lbrd PALMERSTON of changing his policy under thj reasure of clrcmiuutxc'e*. Colonel Srxz read extracts of a letter froa Colonel ED)wRDns at Peshawur, who at ted that tho mutinous soldiery had met with very lit lesyimpaty from the people in any part of the coutry, and that the Hindoo Sepoys were beginning to find that they wexe mae too.s of by the Mahomedan", He showed the extreme danger attending the slihhtest -nterference with the lawi of caste, owing to the jealous susceptibility of the Hindooa upon th' point. Lord J. Russni noticed, he Baid wth regrt, some of the arguments employed by 9 r.Dssn who. had compared the Indian muti4y with the American war, He believed there was lo similarity betiren the two. lHe had also iharged the Council of, India with being srii inar6, but; whate6'ei errors the Indian Goveri4nent might have ixdmmitted, he (Lord JouN) Was convinced that it had imparted a grea amonit of gookl to the people of India, ani that i intentions we" -as: benevolent towards the people as Pho0e of ani Government that ever exista The Inmialny, he observed, must be put down; tranquillity raqmt be restored in India, aZnd it.' was the primuar duty of the House to assure. the Exeuive Government that its support sl4ould not be wanting. There was one subject, he remarked, respecting whkih le had heard Io explanatiou-rthe financial efforts which tb. Indisini-Go verament would have to make, large amounts.of treasbre having been seised, and it being but too certain that there would be great irregzlarity in the paymnent of 1t1G taxes. The imlperial !Govermnent should, in his opinion, aid the financiisl efforts of the Company, and he trusted they w ould not kssitXte to give them the assistance t.hey required. Mr. E. Bnucn called attention to i statement contained in a return on tenures of land in India, made by the East India House on the 18th of June, whicb, he said, contained irrelevant mattei, prejudicial to the character of the late Sir C. N.A.pru. MIr. WmLouGnBY said, there was no1hlng inten-. tionally wrong in the statement, which had beeix taken from an official report. A short discussion followed, in the coirse of whichl a warm tribute was paid to the merits of Sir C. NAPrn,, and it was urged by General CoDRNGTox, Mr. Rornucm, and Mr. Burr, that Sit OHanans's answer to the accusatiou contained in the statement ought to be produced and plao3d upon record. The House then went into a Committee -of Supply upon the remaining civil service eetimttes. . These estimatea were all agreed to, as well Sa those for the militia, after much discussion. On the vote for the Ordnance survey, Sir D. isoRtmYs caUed attention to the state of -the Ordnance survey of Scotland, and put certain questions toLordPAisnsroX(whichwere answered by the noble lord) on the subject of the commision I to coniider the scale of the national survey. The resolutions completing the estimates ,ver e ordered to be reported. Thereport oftheCommittee of Supply 'was brqught up wAd agreed to. : The LoRD-ADvoCATE, in moving the second read, ing of the Parochial Schoolmasters (tland>Bill, explained its object. Mr. CRAuiURD suggested various objections to the Bill, which, however, after some remarks by Mr. SrTauArT and Mr. SrnIRG, was read a second time. ; The Pimlico improvements Bill and the Police (8ctlaid) Bill, were read a thir4 time and. passed. o The consideration of the Probates a-d Letters of Administration Bill, as amended, itas then resumed, and the remaining amendments were discussed. Some further business having beexi disposed of the House adjourned at about 25 minates before 3 o'clocIk
Time was when a Minister would rouse the slunbering energies of his country lXy a brilliant survey of its world-wide achievement$ and duties, its scattered colonies and its banded toes, its disput1d prerogatives and its spreading possessions. One there was who could quicken all Ingland into flame by telling it that he had called a; New World into existence to restore the balance pf the Old, and it is his son who has now, in a sttll older, but to us a still newer world, to do a greater work-- not in words, but in deeds. In our ti4ae, however, a change has come over the scene, for it is no longer from Premiers and responsible statestnen that we hear these displays. They know tqo well the dizzy pinnacle of the world on whic4 we stand; they have their eyes too habitually on; the perilouA verge that forms the line of our empjrea To their practised minds it ia here the still gloNying embers, there the treacherous bog. They know too weU that on one side we must ever advance, on the other at least not recede; and that eyerywhere it is only by hard struggling that we con maintaia our ground. Such panoramic views, then, of our empire, its prospects, and its difficulties, are left in these times to men with no more respoiFsibility than attaches to their history and character. Sir DE LACY EvANs rmay safely remind his country and the world how high are our pretensions, how va*t our line of defences, how scanty our reserve, how laggiug our preparations. Had he not himself done a miracle in his day,-had he not created an army out oI the streets of London, and w4th it done noble deeds in one of the greatest battlefields of history, we might resent the rashness of exposing, or rather exaggerating, the disparity, between our engagements and our ipeans. Sir DEi LAcy EvANs, however, is privileged to warn and to complain, and we may safely a ow him to do so when the result is to elicit| from more authentic lips a declaration of England's confidence in her cause and her resources. The determiiiation expressed by Lord PAXanItsroTN will find on echo in every British soul. We all 1inow we are. playing a high game, and we are resolved to play it. We are aware that it is eo trifle, At the saine time, to maintain ou$ place ini the first rank of European nations to show a front of brotherly independence to tie-populous and aggressive American Republic, to ke7ep'aiFay i the savage tribes of Southern Africa, fo guard the entrance of the Mediterranean, and'to hold aUl over the world the long list of milita4y stations, harbours, and other dependencies, that give scope or safety to our trade. There is no empire so various and so wide-spread as ours; 'no army so taxed. But who are the men on whom we have to depend for standing, or even advancing, on every shore, under every clime, in the face of all the tribes of mankind? They are not trained warriors, taught from their childhood.. No. The men whom we have to carry fur-* ther than COSAI' legions or AaNxADRni's phalanx, and with whom, besides a hundred other works, we have now to subdue a spoilt and mad-! dened soldiery in Central Hindostan, arre iawlads,' still lingering in the harvest fieldc for the. fw shillings more to be got there. They are a s6mpl, -honest, and harmless race, unused to. niolence ori fraud; strangely ignorant of every tmg beyond' their native.fields, and- but slow to lea&e. Such arei the Normans of the nineteenth centaiy, who cross in, 'iese days not a paltry strait%,aat the whole convex world; who hold with iron grasp, not Si6iljor':li6des, bWt~ ill' Thdlh31d t,Vat only as one p&r of theirdiiay voe > .y: ao fAr Â£rom, ,tew, bing an,' gen,ral misgiving as to. the; adequay of our reso= tes'out reaI dangemr lies oi the side of se6irity. 1* We expgct to jdo eVeything, or rather' that, 6*6"hingi.y go it1i, i natutally, nd 'tl'e unfortate ritish o3icers ,n Inuin 'could nQt cobde moo`e blWdly in Sepoy ,fidelity than the British .pqbl,cA9,ei,in the kenitu" or the destiny.. of the nation. - Fot our part, 4re yield to'none in confidence; yet dnfidence snd supinenes7 are very different things id, whatever. ie risk of exposure, we are thanklfiji Sir Ds LAoY PvVABs for calling attention to the iUrgency'of %h6 case, and eliciting from Lord PALA_EsTON. somq frther particulars of what has been do)2e, is being done, and is still to be done. Tie .now is of the greatest value. What is wOanted at 4 moment in twenty places in Beng is a few hundred European;, and the sooner they are there the better. A handful of Light Cavalry would.haxe stopped the mischief at 'Meerut; 'two hundred European infantry wouid have saved Del6l4 On6Iy two days before the murderous mutiny at Allahabad the commanding officer reported the daily pasageof Europeans to Cawnpore, where they were suppose to be more wanted; and, even after that mutiny, Europeans were still passing up, the river, and couId not be spared for Allahabad.. Some twelve or fifteen thousand men are held in, thin soluton over a population of seventy or eighty millions, and all that is wanted is just sucli an addition at a dozen critical points as to turn the scale. It is the suspense of a few days that ruins, a's minutes kill ihe drowning' man. No doubt, if we do not finish matters by the end of this year, we shall have more to do by the end of next ; but, as the natives do not wait for the proper season, neither can we; and the work must be done now. Sir DF 1,&cv Ev&iAs. urges the necessity of sending on more soldiers from the Cape, and, for that purpose, sending niore exact and peremptory orders than those which colonial authoSities there set at noought i -thb last war. He urges the despatch of soldiers from Canada, and the substitution of a colonial militia. Malta, too, he says, may contribute by the same process, and he does not see -w.hy some thousiad men may not go straight from the Mediterranean by the overlsmd route. In som& of theeo :uggestions the General has been aiticipated, though Lord PA1asTON showed satisfactorily, as we think, that, under actir4 co` cunstances, clipper ships would carry a regiment quicker to Calcutta than it would be likely to get there by Alexandria and Suez, So it may be under actual circumistances, bit there is no reason against making arigements for the future useof this rouate. Sir DE LACY EvAS has too mauch. reason to remark on what appears to us the *eakeat -point-the only weak point-of our operations at home. WVhen the resolution has been taken, .the ;regiment or the battery selected, and the orders given, and when the public mind is somewhat relieved at the promptitude showxh, there certainly is *a longer delay before. the -actual embarcation than people ai prepared for. -The General says he kept his eye' eoz the Naval Jhtelligence, and could not make out that more than 'six hundred men left for India in the month of June. They are now going fast, but we should be gladato be sure that the whole thirty thousand will be off by the. end of this month, as that will be necesmary for their employment, to any good- pbrjost, in ther ensuing season for military opera,ioni. But, we repeat, transport is the weak point Gf our naval system, or rather, it falls to the ground, between the army and the navy1 4ia is walting altogether. We have lately Ee9n much more jn_wAnt of clippers, ready equipped^ the conveyance of whole regiments, that of three deckers. 1But every year we shall seo that the keels of half-a-dozen three-deckers, or men of war of nearly equal dimensions$ have been laid down at the rival dockyards and not a word about transports. These are left to the emergency, when they do not present themselves with uniform celerity, and scme time is always lost in getting them, and preparing them for the service. If quick transports can be obtained in sufficient number at two or tliree days' notice, well and good; if not, there is as much reason in.keeping a stock of steam-transports or fast-gailing ones as in multiplying ships of the line, that will not be used once in a century. A; nation that chooses, from one small group 9f islands, to hold an empire all over the world, must overcome the difficulties of distance and dispersion by speed, just as a man with a wide acquaintance in a thin country must keep a horse. It is too evident that we have not yet completed this part of our national establishment, and it ought to be done without more delay.
It was perfectly reasonable that a vote of 10,3001. for the fortifications of Corfu should lead to some remarks in the House of Commons. There could be little hesitation in agreeing to- the vote itself. Corfu, like Malta and Gibraltar, concerns imperial interests principally as a military station; and, although it is alleged that the proposed alterations in the works will improve the sanitary condition of the town, the inhabitants would be as unwilling to contribute to such an object as the citizens of Paris in 1789 to pay a rate for the repair of the Bastile. At the same time it must be admitted that the habitual patience of Englishmen is required to tolerate the language and proceedings which take place from time to time in the Ionian Islands. Mr. BnzTrncI was, perhaps, right in his assertion that the inhabitants of Corfu itself are a tolerably harmless and welldisposed race; but there is no part of the world in which agitators enjoy a more secure, a more profitable, or a more agreeable trade. The conditionS of their occupation are even more advantageous than those which existed in Ireland during the happy days of O'CoNxraL. English toleration and love of freedom applied to a race Utterly indifferent to constitutional freedom, and ignorant of the self-restraint which it requires, can scarcely fail to produce the whimsical travesty of revolutionar - language -which is used in the Ionian Legislature. Successive Commissioners have alternated 4etween extreme Liberalism and measures of repression, which, however necessary or expedient, ire certainly somewhat inconsistent with a cotstitutional system. Sir H. WAn's severity has not ielieved his successor from Parliamentary embsrrasments, which will scarcely be unravelled by Pa'liamentary methods. COoarwEta himself was forcea to explain to one- of his Parliaments that, although he was willing to allow them full liberty, they, could only act on the condition of recognizing tbYe authority which called them together. When the-I6nian Assembly affects to invite a union with. the kingdom of Greece it openly ren+unces the functions for which alone it was creaked by the proteeting Power. The present LORD UGHa Co@ - MISSIoNER commenced the session with, a Government majority; but there were algationl ot irregularity relating to the election ot he loyal candidates in Cephalonia, and in adoubt i luefti6n an English Governor invasiaby Bide with tb0 Opposition.

It is equally impossible to abandon the Protec- torate without regard to the future fate of t,e, Republic. From the fall of the Venetian doninijo; several . the Great Powers of Enrope pavyeeagerly c9veted a pdssession which cotsmaands the trade of the Adriatic. Russia and France were especially desirous to obtain a maritime station at Co0u, and an obvious interest dictated to 4Autria. bhe expedivncy of anticipating the vi,cinity of a- fornMidlble, rival, At the Congress of Viqo s4e pretensiobisL of-UFratce were obviously out of the questibji, Caiid the smallest possible violenpe -wav ofeied to ' the wishes of the different States when the Protectorate was vested in England. CAOP D'IsTRuis, then and afterwards the most . confiSential counsellor of AfLMAaD was, as he said himselfj. an lonian and a Greek before he woa a. Rusianq. The future President of Greece told Lbrd QAsmYRGau that'h piferred for his niave cout#ry the supremacy of England to that of,4ussia. Â£ any Ionian at the present. day possesseas equal wisdom and patriotism, he will not fail to,a,cknowledge that the interests of his country are stigl identified with the maintenance of Englis,h powqr.

The only just complaint -which- can be: Wged faain't the' English Frotectorate is foun4ed on the precipitate assumption that Parliamentary institutions are suited to :all forein populations under our control. Lord. (iY made a similar mistake in treating the Maltese priests like English citizens or freeholders ; but the foreign tyranny which consists in conferring extravagant franchises on the subject is not of a4 intolerable kind. The LIolonial-office is bound to propose to Parliament at an early period a scheme for t e'reprsasi6n of the scandals which have become famir in4)orfu. Commnissioners should be encouraged -to, maintain the Imperial authority, and agitator Bhbuld be discouraged by the withdrawal of oppoqtunitlea for agitation. In the meantime those French journals which live upon Anglophobia may be assured that the English Empire is not on the point of 'disiolution whenever a tolerated clamour r akes itself heard in one of its remoter dependencies.
The religion of the English residents in Paris has reduced itself to extremely fashionable dimensions. It just sticks on them, and no mQre, like the oystershell bonnet. It hangs elegautly and loosely upon them, like the sh4wl which is ever on the point of dropping fromh a PMr of symmetrical shoulders, appearing to be iustained by a miracle which dispenses with the ordinary laws of gravitation. There are various stages of religions warmth. There is the communicating stage, when people are not satisfied with. being religious themselves, but want to malke everybody else religious. Then people become co4entent mitKh a proper concern for their own salvaimn. Thin zeal subsides a step further, and they qfialify this concern with various conditions which they think just, equitable, and constitutional, ahd make a fair bargain on the subject. The dohdition on which the English residents in Paris pledge themnselves to attend to the vital iaterests ot religion is, that a Chapel shall be provided for them at 'the cost of somebody or other-they do ndt muQh care whom, if they are only relieved from axny share of it themselves. The Chapel in the Rue dAgae'sseau has been going through one purchaser's hanid after another's for the last dozen years everybody has been buying it except the resideats in .Paril for whose use it is intended. First it belonged to. Bishqp LuscomBE, by whom it wal Ibffered' to Government for an annuity of 1,00pl. to himself. Government refused the offer, and it was taken by a gentleman who had, we suppose, more correct information as tp the state of the Bishop's health than the Government had. Mr. CQiAm found himself? after the payment of 5001., the possessor of the Chapel in 'the' Rue dTAguesseau. In 1849 the C61i was again offered to Government, but ir. C BA3nxH'S price, 10,0001., was objected to. Some years after-i. e., last year-the Chapel *as again on sale, 9,0001. being the bri? find i . is . said that an American genitiman had cloyed in. Government, however, qa%b' igain' into th4e field, drove out the American, atid 486tIcA Io buyit at that price. All this timethe Englfih reaidents in Paris looked on, and dxhibited no. in *d of; vsh to buy the Chapel themWelves.

EPPMiS FROM PARIS: The following In the letter of our Parls correIpondent, dated yeterday (Tuesday), 6 p.m. :- Everything appears to confirm the corretnem of the Informaton I communicated yesterday touching the settement of the MIoido-Waiadian di%etaty. !The Pays has been authorized, or permitted, to say, 2u an arHicle ctiticlng the language of the Englih| press, that " we also believo thbt the queston has been resolved at Osbone," though not in a way Sdlted at by some of the English journals. The pays, I suppose, does not yet know much more about the matter, but It Is probable that any diffeZenee that may have been caued by the hotteadedneus of diplomattsat at home oa abromd Would easily be removed in an hour's quiet conver- ation between the princpal personages concerned. At any rate, there is a general Impresion that nothing will come of It; at least, nothing unplesant. AL Vogrides 'wil, perhaps, get a hint not to take ihe French elections too ithfully a Is model in future, and a word or two of remonstrance, reprLXand, or encouragement, as the case may be, will he addresed to the subordinate actors. if, as is Jelieved, the conference will have to decide the queltion of the elections, it Is natural that the whole of Vhe fact, and not ea parfe one, as we now have, ill 7ce laid before it, and judged with as much partIaIty us any one can expect from them. Dspatches fron the Forelgn-ocfie were this day received at the Ragish Embassy, and were forwarded wlithout le1ay to Trouville, where the Axbassador has been 1tay1ng for some days past. It Is probable that they 4ontaIn the result of the conversations at Osbone on thAt and perhaps other quesions A telegraphlc despatch ws received here this morning from constantinople, announcing that matters remaIn iw Statu quo in that capitaL The Ambassadors had made sio preparation to quit the clty, but were awaiting further instuctions from thelr respective Governmonta. So far so good. It is also Btated that it was decided at Osborne that, in the event of Lord Elgin And Baron Gros not attaining the object of their pilsslon to China, a more decided action in common should be adopted. The Nord contaim the following remarks on the late diplomatic rupture at Constantinople:- " We have reealved letters 'which comaplete and corct in ortsin points the detals given aS to the natur3 and bearing of the proceedings of the Ambassadors of the four rowers en the subiect of the elections of doldavha Aooording to these accounts, what took plac wag this:-The Ambas5sadors did not demand, as some of the Austrian and English journals assert, the dismissal of the aimzkan, nor did they even demand, as aost journals hAve alleged, the pure and simple anmulment of the eletlons, which theY knew to be stined with fraud; they mAerely asked that a strict vrification of the elections should tb proceeded to, in order to teabliih pcnul.y ana tlearly whethor the prescriptions of the finnan oonvoking ahe eleoctors bad been observed or violated. At an other place than Consantinople, and on ay other ocadon, people would only have seen in this propodtion what it eaUy meant-namely, tho desire to give to Europe and to the popUtions of the Ottoman Empite a strlklng proof of the good dispoidtlos of the Ottomn Governmnent, or oZ affording that Gavermnent the opporhunnity of repaV.ig the aults and abuses comiltted, and which might have been ascribed to the blind zeal of functionarIes acting from culpable mnotiv. The 3?orbe, no doubt, by the eyes of Its conacUora, saw something quite different, ad without undoertading that what was desired was the smean of securing it an honourable retreat, hastened to accept the proposltion, but offered to cary it into exeution in a manner whioh, to make use of an expressiox tht has been employed, we may call ' derisozry; in faot, iie compromise proposed by the Porte consi in the asembling the Kaliakans at, Constantinople, and in calling on them to declare if they had lolatedor nob the prescriptions of the firman, and if the elections were to be decoared null or maintained. In order that this proposition might have had the appearanc of being, if not serious, at least just, It would have been necessary to convoke al the elector and all the rommnlsioners at Constantinople, in order to hear all parties; for, to all persOns vho knowx how things take place at Constantinople, it is evident that the 3aisnkas, if they alone had been convoked, would have found the means of justifying themselves. Such, however, Is the plan of conciliation which the journals of Vienna and those of London so bitterly reproach Mf. de Thouvenel and his coleague with having ejected. What qulfication would not these same jourals, have giveuto thie PlenWIotenilaries if theyhadfallenintothis naret Itevidentlyrezults from these facts that the four Ambassadors have arrded the spirit of concIliatIon to it furthest limits, and that their greatest anxiety has been to preserve the dignity of the Txrkish Governmeat by caug its deolsions, disregarded by its own subjects, to be respect If the proposition of verlfication had been accepted, the affair would have been referred to the commission at aumharet, and the question would not have assued the proportions which Lord leddliffe, Ausria, and Turkey have so inconsiderately Causd It to take." The Pays publishes a letter from tho Hague, of the 8th inst., which states that the Governor of the Dutch possessions In India had protested against the occupation by the English of the group of ilamds called the Oua-Horn, situate on the confines of the'Dutch possesions in the Indian Seas. This cluster comprises several islands, of which the prcipal are the Island of Cocos, or the ialand of NIeoulaboulabou, the island of Varaders, or Isand of Traitors, and the island Oua, the moat eastern of the group. The protest is accompanied by a long Memorial, from whioh it appears that the Archipelago of Oua-Horn hbs belonged to EolLand since the yea 1680. Colonel Barman, the ex-Minlster of Switzerland a4 Paris, has addr(M(ed a letter to the Gazee of ;, 'sanune, in which he declarefs, n contradiction to what has been stated, that he never said to Dr. Kerr that thelatter was in high favour with the 3eurch GSovernent, alla expreaw mprlxe that fke ne is of Dr. Kern did not themselves con bTadict the ssertion, as they knew that he (Colonel Barma) e oald not, from coniderations Of diplomatic pr 'priety,do so; and yet they knew v hat It u t xrtion which led to Dr . e ms nozL ration. ,heAssem b 'stionace is approaching the termn of _tBIMsPenaioiY4 c it in preparing to appear in r- Its sspenion,and h all the honours of temporary we vigour and ,,uning of September.

It has beereierrgd to the Counell of State to explain the new law on the atamp duties to be paid by proprietors of newspapers more particularly the propritols of unStAMped papers who publish advertisements.

On Saturday afternoon the Grand Duchess Con.- ltlantne of Russia, with her two cildren, and her mother, the Grand Duchess Alexandra Josephowna, a Saxe-Altenburg Princess, who had arrived from Altenburg to join her In the morning, took their deparure for Rel, to embark for St. Petersburg. They were received at the Altona terminun of the Elel Railway by the Danish miiHtary and civil authorities, where a guard of honour aud a military band were in attendance. In the evening they embarked on board the steamer waiting to convey them to Cronstadt. The St. Petersburg acounts of the 4th inst. mention a report set to the Govermaent on the 8th ult. concerning a very brilliant affair whish took place on the 3d at Gelendwahick, on the coast of the Black Sea. The report bad been forwardled by Major-General Filipson, the o%cer in command of the Russian troops in those parts, and states that theFilbustering troops, under the orders of a certain Colonel Leptasky, had been surprised by the Russians landing troop3 under Maior Benaschow, who had succeeded in capturing a large quantity of powder, two rounds of grapes4hot, 500 grenades, and other valuable stores of ammunition, which had been placedthereinchargeofthegarrison, andbeen thought quite secre from any Russian attck. The Russisus are said to have had only eighht-men severely wounded and two killed in storming the defensive worls and capturing the gans in posifion. The 'whole affir sppearstohavetakenplace from the too great confidence reposed in the courage of the garrison to defend their position by Lepinaky, who had otherwise used everyprecautionin fortifying the point of danger, a far as cenoe was concerned. The Russian Governmentd hsm givau ordea for the construction of screw machinery for nine ships of-the-line, two corvettes, and ten galiots, besides four transport ships. There ar at present in the camp of PeterhofE no less than 4,000 cadets belonging to the army, principally in the branch of artillery, and the Grand Duke Nicholas is often employed in witnessing their exercise in gunery. , We learn from Stockholm up to the 5th inst. that another bulletln from Saxo bu bee sent thither by telegraph on the subject of the Mng's health, and which runs as follows - " The tate of HSis esjys health, which at the end of last week bad been lews stisactory in, ad aduxlg the lt two days been improving. He continues to bathe regularly." The committe on the constitution in the Rich' stag have advised the fundamental alteration in the law of the press, to the effect that the publishers of all newspapers and other periodical works shall be compelled to give security of 1,000 thalera R.M., previously to receiving the permision for publication thereof. M. Antonio Alves Machado de Andrada Calvalho has been recognized as B1raz Minister at the Cout of Sweden. SPAIN. A Royal decree in the Madrid Gazette of the 7th sanctions the bill adopted by the Cortes, whlch concedes to a private company, headed by AL Borras and M. Canals, the railway from Remz to Moutblauch. The conceWion is for 99 years, but is without subventiolt of any kdnd. The Government, says the Espaat had sent instractions to its Ambassador at Paris to hasten the concluson of the postl treaty which has been sonme time In negotiation between France and Spain. The Government contemplated establishing ia the Minitry of the Interlor a special department for managing the political police and wathbing over the public safety. The Municipality of Saragossa had resigned en masse, according to some accounts from provincia causes, accordmg to others, owin, to the arrest of the alcalde. Mgr. Barelli, the new Nuncio, was shortly expected, and it was not doubUrd that lhe would, remove aJl the dlfflulties of detail which stood in the. way of the Pope's fol approbation of the sale of church property. The letters reeived from Mexico represented that MiL de Tejeda, the new Minister of Foreign Affair of that Republic, had written to hIL LaÂ£ragua to take no further steps in the dissention with Spain, In the event of the Spanish Government not being satisfied w-ith the concessions that have been Lnade to it. This led to the apprehension that the Anglo-Prench mediation had but smal chancm of succe.

FORMJIGN INDTgLLIGHNR. PRA3C1L (FRoM OUR ow9r OORBRONDiRT.) [The followng appmured in oui aeconi editon of yes. FAF 4 )IAoxLY, AXaUsr 10, 6 P.M. There are a few branches of industry in Paris better off than others, but, generally speaking, trade is very dull. One str6ng proof of the fallingmoff in commercial operations is to be found in the diminished receipta of the principAl railway companies. This diminution cannot be attrbutea solely to the cesstion of the transport of corn, but to a general decline in the conveyance of merchandise. The Parisian shopkeopers hardly hope for any revival of trade rorth mentioning before the end of next month. The manufacturers of wiuter stffs begin to prepare even now for the retun of cutomes from the watering - places, as it wll take some time to make a propec asortment of fancy articles. The absence of nmo r of their hands, now employed in getting in the harvest, necerilylimis the produce of the manufacturing establishment3. According to advices from the 3outh, those who sent their merchandise to the fair of Beaucaire have no reason to be disatisfied with the result. The greater part of the goods offered for sale has been disposed of on excellent terms for the sellers. The meeting was attendea by numerous buyers from Piedmonat, CQrsea, and lsgeriae Silk handkerchieft brought 10 per cent. more than last year; drapery from 6 to 8 per cent.; hemp from 2 to 3; hides, dressed and raw, 20; and woolf10 per cent. All other article brought higher pricen than last year. lour rose in the Pari market atothe begining of lastpweek in consequence of the drought, which prevented the millers fm grinding. The rain which has fallen since then must have removed the difficulty in a great measure. It must not be forgotten that the stock of four on hand is low; the quantity in the Paria market sores is 7,674quintald. The bakers made no purchases on Saturday, and it i0 supposed that th he secient their consImption rntil the 1wtlh The last gales quoted on Saturday are 115 a , at from 6. to 69t. the sack of 157 kllogramnes, for immediate delivery.

Th harvest and the gathering in the wheat have been, t to the hot, weather, effeded writh incredible raoidity. t is now ascer- ptined that, notwithrtadivg the late I bprovementr the oat crop will not be abundant. the ropin the 13eauce and Champagne is particularly olght Theprice is fir at from l9. to 22f. thei Parisogrammes. Accounts frome Marelles oi Saturday lase atate that the oale of vheat is becoming every day more difficult. The Government is said tohave adopted a resolution relative to the sale of butchereo rmeat in Paris, and it is enected that a deoree will be shortly published abolihing the asizeor fixen pcye of meat, sudppresing the market atPoisoy, declaing the trade of the butcher free in Paris, and establshng a great central caWte market at the i ate of Paris. It is hoped that these measures hwill put an end to the continued rise in the price of meat. The butchers deny that the high price of meat is to be attributed to them, but to the insufficiency of produce and the increase of COnsumption. nTo thisthe reply given isthat the dioference ofprice is too great betWeen Payis and the departments. For exrample, the inhabitant of Paris pays at this mtoment lf. a-pound 20r beef, which is to bepuarchased in the departments, of equally good quality, at 14 SOUs. The high price of butchers' meat niParis eauses,moreover,anincrease in the price offowrls,eggs, and vegetables. The intense heat of the weatheor until haat Wednesday, and the want of rain, have caused some injury to the vineyards. Letters from Mr sefiles Lyons, Bordeaux, and Toulouse are unanimo in describing the danger to be apprehended from acontinuance of such scorching weather. The rain, which felt abundantly after Tuesday, appears, happily, to have been general,and wil prebablv remove all danger. Spirixof winedistilled from beetroot have fallen from 112f. to 109f. the hectolitre. Cognac, Armagnac, Saintonge, and Montpelier brandies are quiet, with a tendency to a faLl.

SUMMEB A&S.IZES. sArrLJ(. rTDnT- CROYDON. AUG. il. (Before the LOnD CMx BAAoN and a SpecaZ Jury.) LYLE V. BERBEIT. This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages from the defendant for having seduced and de bauched his wife. The defendant pleaded "N Not Gunilty." Mr. E. James, Q.C., and M1r. Hawkins were for the plaintiff; and Serjeaut Parry and Mr. Prentice for tho defendant. Mr. JAX93, on opening the case to the jury, oad that It was probably one of the last of the same description that would be brought before a court of justice, but at present the plaintiff had no other legal remedy for the wrong that he had sustained at the hands of the defendant. The plaintiff wa a young man who was caruying on an extensive business as an upholsterer in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square, and the defendant, who, ha was istmrted, was a person of property, was conslderably older than either the pli:ntiff or his wife, ad he believed was nearly 50 years of age. The plaintiff met his wife, who was the daughter of an Indian officer, and probably in acondition of life somewhat above his own, at a ball at Bimingham, at which place she lived with her famy, aud they were married on the 7th of April, 185L She was a lady of condderable accomplishments and pleasing manners, and there was no doubt that for some time afler the mariage tho plntiff and his vife lived on the mogt affectionate terms, and that the wife evineed the utmost anxiety for the welare of her husband, and rendered him great assisace In carrying on bis business. In the latter end of the year 1856 the plaintiff w anidous to obtain additional capital in order to extend his busdness, and he inerted an advertisement in 27ie Times for a partner with capitaL The defendant at the time 'was living at Croydon, and he replied to the ad. vertisement, and stated that he had some capital lying Idle, and after some negotiation an arrangement was entered Into that the defendant and the plaintiff should become partners, And the former was to advance the necessary capitalfor carrying on the business, and was to receive a lage am ot intret for that capital. The defendant ater this, of course, went to the plaintif's warehouse and took an active part in the business, and there could be no doubt that he took advanrtage of the opportunity thus afforded him to seduce the affection of the plaintffs wife. In the month of January the defosdant represented that it was very inconvenient for him to go backwards and forwards to Croydon, and he suggested that a bedroom should be provided for him at the plaintifrs reddence, and the plaintiff, who, of course, had not the slightest suspicion of the honour of the defendant, readily oonsented to the suggestion, and from this time down to the discovery of his wife's infidelity the defendant continued to occupy the apartment that was provided for him. The evidence appeared to him to leave no doubt that this prooeed. ing was part of the plan adopted by the defendant to seduce the wife of his partner, and that he very soon afterwards succeeded in doing so. In the month of May Mr. Lyle went to Birmingham on a visit to her relatives, and iroumstames occurrd in connexion. with this visit which excited a strong suspicion in the mind of the plaintiff with rard to the fidelity of his wife, and which led to his raeia th necessary steps to discover her guilt. On the 27th of 'x while the wife was at Birmingham, a telographio mesage came to the warehouse of the plaintiff to the following effect- =I. D. Herbert, Eeq. Prvate. Impotait. Immediate. Meet meat the Euston stetiou by the 1 45 traIn. I could not cne any s0cner.-M. A. 1'owxn." The signature to this mee was in the name of the sister of Mrs. Lyle, but it would be proved that it was sent by the plaintiff's wife, and there was no doubt that it ws an appointmeut for the defendant to meet her at tho railway ttion. She arrived in London by the train referrea to but she did notmake her appearance at her husband?s house until the following day, and he beheved the jury would not entertain any doubt that she and the defendant had ad a guilty night together. The suspicions of the plntiff baving been nius aroused, he more narrowly watched the proceedlngsd o his wfe and the defendant, and on the 18th of June the wife of the plaintiff and the defendant were discovered in bed together, and the plaintiff at once turned his wife out of the house and commenced the present acion. The following evidenoe was then adducd :- Mr. E. Poster said,-I am a builder. I know the plaint3if, and he and his wife formerly lived in one of my houses, and they apeared to be on very affectionate terms. The plaintiff is about 34 years old. His wifo is tnder 30. She has no particula personal attractions. The planstiff had a very good business in Charlotte-street, and the defendant becafme is partner at Christmas last, and he then went to rVeside at thte plaintiff's house. Cross-examined.-Never heard the wife of the plaintiff complain of his being too intimate with a servant girl named Eliabeth Thomas. e ewas in the house on the 18th of June, wvhen "the discovery" took place. The husband saw the defendant and his wife in bed together, and witness and he afterwards went and had something to drink at a neighbouring publichouse. There were several other per. sons with him. They might have had some supper at the tublichouse together. He andtha plaintiff hsdaciga,,ad Ileyaight also have had some "humble porter." A laugh.) There were four or five persons present at "- the discovery," mad Mr. Lyle was among them, and after it was made they all went to have some supper. Did not know that the discovery caused the plaintiff to want his supper. After the discovery had been made all the parties went to have something to drink, and then they retmrned to the plaitiffs house and some of them partook of piockled salmon. (A laugh.) Could not sy whether the plaintiff had any of the pWed sdmon. (Renewed laughter.) One of the party was a lady, but they took her home to her mother. (Lan ter.) Would swear that the plAintiffand all the rest of the party did not asit up drinking during the remainder of the night He believed that the plaintiff had been watching in the next house on the night the discovery was made, but he was not sware that he had done so for three or four nights before. Witness was aware that he had hired a room in the next house in order to detect bis wife and the defendant, and he had advised him to eo ail he could to find out such a disgraceful business. He had heard that two holes wereboredin the party wall so thatthe plaintiff might see what took place in his wife's bedroom. (A laugh. He was also aware that, in addition to the holes, there was a sort of indicator or instrument provided by means of which perons in the room in the adjoining house could tell when the bed moved. (A roar of laughte=.) The indicator consisted of a piece of string attached to the bed which was pamsed through the hole of the wal, and there was a weight at the end which moved when anyone was on the bed. (Laughter ) The weight moved when any person got into the bed, and very necss too. (A roar of laughter.) Could not say whether the p aintlff was in the doininghouse on the night when "the discovery" (es mete watch for the weight bobbing up and down. (needlaughter.) Re-examinied.-The plaintiff appeared very much excited, and he took him out of the house for fear he should commdt some act of violence. Sophie Buckle said she was formerly a lady's-maid, and was acquainted with the plaintiff and his wfe after their marrage, and in 1856 she was staying with them. They appeared to live very bappily together. uross-examined.-She believed at npon one occasior Mrs. Lylewent to a i masqu6 In the character of a paLe with a male friend, with the knowledge of her husbanm Her sister was with her. They had a servant named Elizabeth. She had heard Mrs. Lyle complain of her husband being too Intimate with this girl, and that he had kissed her, and also that he had taken her to the theatre. Never heard that Mrs. Lyle had a latchkey to lst herself in when she came home late at night. Mr. JANs sad that he believed married gentlemen liked to have a latchkey, but he never heard of a ladyhaving one. (A laugh.) CrosFexamination continued.-Mrs. Lyle used to go out sometimes In the evening, but sbe bilieved that she only went to visit a friend in tho neighbourhood. Cecilia White idl that she wa a dressmaker, and knew the plaintiff before his marrTae, hut she only knew his wfe after they wero married. She visited thm Ein NTovember, 1855, and duing the next Year, and sometires stayed two or three dys at their houso. She remembered the defendant coming to live at their house, and very soon after. wards she observed a difference in the demeanour of Mrs. Lyle towards her husband, and she used to find fault with her husband, and say that Mr. Herbert's business habits were superior to his. She had also heard Mr. Lyle complain of his wife going so frequently to the defendant's room aud remaining there so long; and he remonstrated with her for doing so. Mrs Lyle used to play and sing. Cross-examined.-Witness remembered M1s Lyle going to the ba masqu6. Her husband knew that she wenXt. Maria Taylor deposed that she was in tho service of tho plaintiffin September, 1856, sad remained until a fortnight before Chrlstmnas. During this time Mr. and Mrs. Lyle a. peared to live very happily and comfortably together and Mrs. Lyle assisted in the business. She went a seoond time into their service in March, and she then found Mr. Herbert was lodging in the house. She noticedl directly that there were Improper looks and remarks between Mr. HZer bert and *Mrs. ALyle. She once sawr M^r. Herbert sittig on a chair n ^*his bedroom, and MIrs. Lyle wans sitting at his feat, aD4l she thought she heard her Say, "Oh, do," and " Henxg." On_Easer_Sunday afternoon she found t*he Friday before Mfr. Lyle went out to the crystal Palace, About 2 o'clock, and did not Teturn till 8 in the even. Ing. While he was away Mrs. Lyle, Mr. EHenwood, Mr. Herbert, and Mr. Venn, the partner, were in the dinug. room, and Mfr. Venn offered Mr. Herbert a eclEr, but he would not take one, and Mrs. Lyle and Mfr. Her,eit winked at one another, and Mr. Herbert said he was sleepy, and he should g and lie down, and he went to his room, and Mrs. Lyle fololowed him, and she remained in his room until 5 O'clock. On EAster Sunday she found Mrs. Lyle In the defendant's room. The door was locked. She rememberea 'Mrs. Lyle leaving home to visit her friends at Birmingham. she War awmayaout a fortnight. On the 10th of June Mr. Lyle went int the country, and Mms Lyle and Mr. Herbert .were very much together, end they were in the sifttg. room together all the evening. mr. Herbert remained in the homse until the 18th of June. On the evening of that day she heard a noise on the top of the house, and some one come down from the rd&f, and msid "1They were In bed tcgethsr."* A person namedTaylor went up with her, and she saw Mms Lyle and M, Herrbeit fAll from the bed togeher, and ahe was so frighteei tha se anawy.(A laugh.)

Field came to "1pumnp him," and he told him what he liked. He had beenP out of work about a month when he midertook this job. IHis bsiness was that of a cabinetmaker. . The apparatua consisted of a lever attached to a spring, and when any one aw Inthe bed it moved, (A laUgh.) The defendant ws not sleepg in his own bedroom at the time of the discovery, but in the bedroom that had been occupied by the plai-tiff and his wife. Was not aware that it was at the instigation of the plaflntiff that the defendant was p laced in this room, Mr. Lyle was watchingtbe 'indicatoi` while witness waslooking throughthe hole. (A roar of laughter.) An hour and half elapsed befere the instrument began to act, and durin that time t hey drank some gin and water. He sugested | that the parties should have every facility afforded tm in orderthat he might detect them. Would swear that he did not sit upon the tiles dressed in woman's clothes, in orderto watch Mr Lyle and the defendant. He msde a rough model of the " indicator," but he uas not aware whether It was In court or not. Mr. JTn said the model should be produced If h14 leared friend wished to see it. Sereuant PARRY said he really had no deaire to see it. He had been shocked quite enough already. (A laugh Cross-examination continued.-He had followed Mr. Lyle about, and once went to Birminghamn when ske ws supposed to be there. 3e reported all that he saw to the plamntHE Thet had tried otherplansto detect Ms Lyle and Mr. Herbert, but they were unsuccessful. After the affar bad been discovered he and the plaintiff and several others went to a publichouse and had some drink, but he did not see Mr. Lyle smoke a cigar. Did not know whether he smoked a cigar or not. Believed that after the discovery was made they had a glass of brandy and water al1 round. (A lariL) fterthisthey AiRwentback to the house. lhere -as gin and water on the table. Hle stole a bottle of gin from Mr. Herbert's bedroom at the time of the disoovery. (A roar of laughter.) It was Mr. Lle' gin, and he had his authority for taking it They had pickled salmon, gin, and tea but he could not say whether the meal was supper or breakfast; but it was more like breakfast than supper, because it was in the middle of the night. A writ wax issued the. next day, and witness served it upont the defendant. By witness's advice Mr. Herbert wassllowed to remain in the house all day after the transaction, and he took his boots away in order that he might not leave. (A laugh.) He Insisted upon having the arrangement of everythig, or els .e would not have Interfered in the affair. | Reexamined.-He believed that Field came from the office of the solicitor for the defendant. He knew this because he had watebad him. (A laugh.) By the jury.-Witness Ws not related to the last wit. mess. I;aac Cully, a police-constable, proved that he was called into the house on the night of the 18th of June, and he heard the plaintiff say to the defendant, "Herbert, you villain, I have longhad supicions that youhave diahonoured my bed, and now I am thoroughly convinced." The defend. ant made no reply. Mr. JTA=9 then proposed to prove that the telegzrphic message referred to by him in his opening speech was rece.ved at the office in Lothbury on the 27th of May. but, upon an objeotion taken by Soeieant PA-.RY, The CrBAE BARON ruled that the evidence was not rQ. ceivabIe. This closed the case for the plintiff; nnd, tSenesnt PA Riy having Intimated that be did not intend Mtr. J.TA proceeded to sum up the 'aimntif's se, H.- stlrthtWs icain-ea"frieiid 1ad d W tedCriRffi swer on the part of the defendant, and he had only en deavoured to laugh the ease out of court; but he hoped the jury would not take this view of the matter, and that they would ive to the plaintiff the reparation to which he was entitledfor the injury whieh he had olearly sustined. The learned sejeantwould, no doubt, he said, makea good mny severe observations upon the witness Taylor* but the ju;y shouldbearIn mind that guilt o the chaer attributedto the defendant could only be establshed by the aid of such persons, and that the journals of the House of Lords bore testimony to the fact that a right hon. gentleman, who -was once a Minister of the Crown, bad tracked the wife of a noble duke, who afterwards obtained a divoroe, all through Italy, and appeared as a witness to prove her aduliery; and that the fot of a mau in the position of life of the plaintiff employing a man to bring the hargo home to the defendant ought not to operate againat him and that he waa clearly entitled to damages if the; coxeidered the charge w:s establlshed. Mir. S%jeant PaxwY said that his leared friend, in the opening of the case, bad alluded to the procedings that werethgoing on in the Legislature to abolish actions of ti description and all he could say was that if there was a doubt on tue rmind of any person as to the prore of abolishing a practice which eniabled a husband to makeatffio of the honour of his wife the d ing facts that hd been proved during the present inquiry 'would effectually remove thst doubt, and sbow the necessity of doing away with such a course of proceeding, which wa looked upon as a disgrace to our land and a scandal and oontemjpt to the administration of justice by all foreign jurists. His learned friend had sid that he should treat the case with ridicule, and he oertainly should do so, for a more ridiculous and at the atme time disustng case heand he believed he might say every one, including the learned judge, who had had great experience in these mattehrs-adever heard of. Had any one ever heard such evidence as that given by the witness Taylor ? Was it possible for anyone to hear bim talk of his indicator or rather his " crimoonometer," without having his risible muscles excited to the utmost degree. (laughter in which the learned judge could not help joiing.) He could not help saying that he was astonished that his learned friend Mr. James, who, he kneow, enjoe eaything that was funny as well as any one in the world, could have opened the case in the solemn manner he did, when he was awo of the nature of the evidence by which the plain. tiWs cue was to be supported. The learned serjeant then froceeded to state that m his opinion the action was one of he most disgraceful that had ever been brought Into a court of justice, and that even if the jury should believe the evidence of the witness Taylor,upon whm hbe said the case entirey rested, the lowest coin of the realm would be ample compensation for the injury the plaintff had sustained. It -was proved that so early as the mnonth of May he recelved information that something wronig was suspected to be going on between his wife and the defendant, and yet he allowed him to re3main In his house, sat at the samo table with him, sand actually gave him every facility in his power to debauch his w4ifef he had not done so already. The jury, by thr. p reset state of the law, were called upon to assess the damages that a husband was entitled to for the mental angnish he snusined by reason of the seduction of his wife, but "just fancy," said the learned counsel, "what an anount of mefttal e guish must be sistained by a man who coDld sit for an hour and ,half in a room adjoining the bedroom In which he supposed his wife tobe with an adulterer coolly drinking gin and water, and watching the "1Indicator" to ascertan the exact period when his (dii. honour ws completed. The learned serjeant ur in concluimon that the evidence was by no means conclusie that the defendant wus pilty of the charge Imputed to him;e btdt he sad that if the jury should be of opinion that his guilt was established the plaintiff had clearly brought it ulpon himself by his own misconduct, and that a farthing damasges wol b utesffcet fo te wtns Taylor, who was xne LRD- Arsly BA ONsmmed up very briefly, and, after calfln he attention of the jury to some of the points in thle evidence, observed upon the absence of the testi. monY of-aykielations of the parties to show the terms upon whic thy lived an tht nne ht sranersor servants werecaled t prve tat hey ive on erm ofaffection The uryaftr ashort deliberation, returned a verdict fortheplantif,-amaes,one farthing.

The defendant had only acted in the fair disharge of his duty, and finding he had made a mistake he had been illing to make any apology, but the plaintiff' attorey had inins upon Tuckier giving in the apology. Mrs. Beecher had put th whole thi-ng in motion. Tucker had refused to ioin In the anology because he had had nothing to do with the matter, so then the action wa brought against Tuoker s, well sas Holman in the county court. Tuocker said he ha a good defence, and he did not like to hAve it tried in the somewhat hAsty manner in which matters were ltred in the county court- and therefore he had removed It to the higher court, sad;hen the plindtiff bad withdrawn all claim uponx Tucker and confined herself now to Holman. Rethought, had the evidence been taken before the magistrate, that he would have granted a warrant; bat, uxfor. tunately, the defendant h not gone through that formality.

The defendant, Draper, who was a tailor at Cheltenham, had supplied him with clothes, and in Februay, 1856, he (the defendant) ap- led tohim for security for a debt which was then due. she defendant complained that Oliver had given his mother a bil of sale on his forniture, and he required secuity for his debt, which be made out to amount to 2101., though he (Oliver) did not think it was so much. The defendant promaked Oli*er that if he (Oliver) would give him a jndgment for what he owed, he (the defendant) would pay all Ogver's creditors 5s. in the pound. The defendant several times urged Oliver to dothis, and ono called upon him with a person namned Boodle, who was clerk to a Mr. Packwood, the defendant's attorney, The defendant promlaed that the goods should remain, and urgd as a reason why Oliver should sign the warrant that Bidler, the manager of the bank, would be1ikely to sue him for 1201.

The proposal2 is to ran four stetiRewr of 20,000 tons: eal~ betwreen Milford Haven and Chesapeake gay, the capital to be raimed in shares of.$L.0 each? and 31,0 prson to be allowed to hold! more than one shahe. Delte2b were pre3ent at the convention from MAaryand, ngto,Tnnessee Worth Carolina,, Virginia- Georgi and'Texa.. John Tyler, senator, was the president. ILetters were read fromall 1the memibers of the Cabinet, Lientenant Maury, and othereX ctrongly endorsing the plan. ;3y telegraph from Washington,. OD. the 31st, wre learn that on the second day a oueres of eight resolutions were pasued, delegating Mr. Dudley Mann to convey the sentiments of the- convention to the Knioxville convfention, and also to take charge of the correspondence concerning the proposed ocean ferry. The general tenour of the- wesolutions was warmly in favour of the project. t The subscription committee reported that $8,000 had been subscribed on the spot. A despatch from Washington states that Lord Napier, the afitiBh Minister, had an interview on the 30th ult., with General Case, with reference to the proceedings taken regarding the seizure of the bark ranchita on the coast of Africa. It was said that General CasW's explanations were perfectly satis. factory. The sloopp of war Cyane axrived at Boston on the 2th, with 53 of General Walker's mesi, and the steam frigate Rioanoke was hourly expected with 240 more of them. We learn from Rey West of the total loss of the ship 'Uarak and her cargo of cotton, beth valued at !!i230,0; aso of the proboable loss of the bark Pacific, from New York for Mobile, on East Key shoal, on the 22d nilt. No lives were lost by either dfisater. The Tenth, Infantry, the vanguard of the army for Utah, set out from Leavenworth, Kangas, for Salt Lake city on the 18th ult. The iUght Artillery and the Fifth Infantry were to follow at intervals of a day between eacb. The entire force, exclusive of the Dragoons detained by Governor Walker, amounta to 1,300 men. It was doubtful if the Dragoons could be spared in time to join the expedition. Much dissatisfaction was sad to exist in the Fifth Infantry. Several of the officers had1 tendered their resignations in consequence of what they conceived to be the injustice of ordering them upon the toilsome IJtah expedition, after the.- harassing service they had so recently performed in the swarams ef Florida. Accounts from St. Paul, Minnesota, to the 26th ult., represent the Sioux Indians as defying the United States' soldiers, and the settlers as flying to the forts for protection. Despatches from colonel Abercrombie, the commander of the troops dated the 25th, state, on the contrary, that the India had been pacified, and that the trouble with them vas at an end. The sales of cotton at New York on the 30th embraced about 1,000 bales, the market closing firm on the basis of 15fc. to 15jc. for middling Uplands and New Orleans Flour was unchanged in price, while some description3 of common grades were said to be rather firmer; the sales were moderate, and confined moetly to the local and eastern trade. Wheat was quiet, and New Southern was unchanged. The sales of old were confined to Milwaukie Club at $1.45 to Â§1.48; and common Canada white $1.76. IDdian corn was firm, with sales of Western mixed at 89c. to 90c. Pork was quiet, but firmly held at about $24 to $25. Sugars were in fair activity with sales of 1,300 hhds. Coffee was firm, and more active; the sales embraced 4,340 bags Rio at 11ic. to J.1,c. In freights there was some more offering, but engagements were moderate, and quotations unchanged. The stock*nmarket had lost all its buoyancy. The downward movement had fairly set in, and we may expect, with occasional re-actions, a steady decline in all the most inflated railroad stocks. At the first board Virginia Nines fell off fper cent.; Illinois Central Bonds, i; Galena and Chicago Second Mortgage Bonds, J; New York Central Railroad, A; Reading i ' Raukie and Misissippi, J; Illinols Central Ilailad, ;Galena, and Ohicago, f; Clever land and Toledo, ; La Crosse and Milwaukie, i; Pennsylvania Coal advanced IJ per cent.; Michigan Southern, J; New York Cenital continued quite active.

THA LYDIAN MUTINIZ31. TO Ta, BDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I trust our countrymen both in England and India will rather respond to the opinions of Colonel Macdonald than of the morbid sentimentalist. The case demands jt retribution, .and forbids future confidence in the crueL superstitiou Bengalee Sepoy. I wonder that any wiso man ahould presnae to be more merciful than God himself, who taught his creatures from the beginning, " Whoo pheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed" Surely, human snd divine lbws call equally for vengeuce .on those who shed innooent blood, and, undoubtedly, a case where women and children, have been murdered in torture, azd without the slightest provocation, ought not to be made an exceptional one. : The late MisJennings,who was murdered withher father at Delhl, waS for years s. parishioner and friend of mine, living with her mother next door to the vicarage. Never Ws there a more truly amiable and interesting young lady, or one more huiversally respected aud loved.. I never knew a word or act of hers that could incur the censure of tha, strictest moralist, nor could I have more feellngly lamented her fate if she had been my own daughter. She had been long e,uough i4 Delhi to be known and appreclated, yet no hand was held forth to save ber from the bloodthirsty Sepoy. She 'was engaged to marry Mr. Thomason, an offioer in the Enginbers, and in a letter which ].Am JenningR put Into my hands he states that when the dear girl was brought o5t in the P*ace to be maurdered she had no fsar,of datb,, but only enireated the ruffians to spre her father's life;; instead of whioh they bratally shot her dear fther first be. fore,hercye4, jid then herself. If- yor will 14low me to give an opinion as to whit should be done in Indis, I should say, Punish with death every S&pow who 1i been accesory to the murder of any officer or civilian, and show meroy to the rebels who. spared their officers when in their poWer, and had nq hand in tho mas se of the Teidents. To show r4lore mercy than this is not required by the laws of God or man, and would only lead to ninh fature eviL Also, if thoe who rule India ever place coWllence in native armies again they will themselves lose the confidenue of iiQe. British natio,. Nor do I think our Engljsh gentry will in future send ttheir sons to take commissions asflicers In. Sepoy reginments.

It IS a direct addition to that wealth whicli,&4fal under the shears of the oommissioners, o thie income-tax;, and represents vweath amounting even at 5 per cent. to 120,000,0001. sterlng. To this amount we must add, as par Man-c cheste,r valuation, one farthing for the preservation of the tational. honour and sundry equally insignificant items. It is a maxim of this school'nbot to give up a penny while it canl be kept. It is therefore, on the clearest rules of business incumbeit "6oi this niation to ,spend 120,000,000l.' iterling a,nd one fa'gl of its own. money (not fnd?s 'money mind) before it surrenders India to the Sepoys. Thpat i,u readpresents, if I am not greatly misaken, about osia years of stern, determined, bl- d letting warfare. I have said nothing of the frightful shock to our presige,4-and prestige has a money value, if only in the occasional saving, of actual battle-which'would be infliotd by the surrender of India, or -even its tiltiinteloss. fromr our own slaekness. Thlzat argament might bepooh-poohed. -But here.isanother, patent like the fint even to men like the hon. member for Lambeth; -India, besides thi4 tribute *hidi it *paysannually to England, has a tride. at Th ,a exclusive of the Singapore branch, ainoujits to B55,00,0001. sterling a-year. The whole of tbit great commerce is conveyed in English ships, and Passesat one- stage or another tbro'dghEnglish :nans, leaving certain, modicums of profit sticking there. 'And it so passes and deposits thope profitsas aforesaid because of British political supremacy. It .is. 4sy to deny that fact, but the denial can beat onceshown to be reckless assertion. By "giving up India" you restore India to the condition it displayed 1.00 years ago. There is nothimig to'd&elope the iraae now which did not exist then. The people. -I: mean the millions-are not more klf their- land is not .more fertile, their manfactures are; in a far worse position. It ia the ordbr anid the security, the enterprise and' the thirst foi acc=mulAtion, produped by .3ritisI rule which have created this trade.

What is ita money value V I will estimate it at only two years' purchase, ind then we have stilt anothier l00 000,000l, to add to the previous 10,000,0001. OH. 0( We are, therefore on the commonest cal. culation of profit and lous, bound to spend 200,000,0001. before we "give up India.". Again, .these gentlemen may not care muchthough they. do, -for their hearts refuse their own logic, for the lives of the 60,000 and odd Eutopeas in India. iBut they will' understand the value of these lives when I remind them thathey are subtracted from an over-filled labodu-hjjarket. About 9,000. of them are, moreover, subtractedi frot a single claVs, that class being the only oz3e they have really to dread -the ke6na aspiring, esurient, educated poor.

Or will' they not rather admit, fin6ndieis as they are, that to be rid of these annoyances is in itself a pecuniary advantage of no small value ? Do they want 80,000 able-bodied, workers addea every 10 years to their factory tokna to render " balf-time" more bitter and a "glt less supportable ? That is about the nudmber ofpoor Europeans, soldiers and ilors ineluded, whom India O dram off. I have. said nothing about what' India may become-a -out India as an improvable estate; that. topic i-to .vast for. a letter,. and L w t.to call. attention to a different division of the subject. But I subiit that it is proved, even arithmetically, thst Izdia 1s worth at least 200,000,0001. let us tdrn to the other point. There is a vague idea,abroad of some astounding expenditure' which has been, or may be, incurred.
