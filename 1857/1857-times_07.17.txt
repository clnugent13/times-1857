The Committee of the ileaoole Fund have gret zatisfaction in antnouncing that the Directors of the Royal Sburrey Gardens have moss hanideernely Wooced bthatpsendid estabishbment at their disposal for a Grand Military PROe for the Benefit of MMre Seacole. 31L Jultien also hoas generously offered iris lvcoff,-i1e orgrinlziatirarngink;eiid' conducting this military musical festival. The Colonels of the following regimeents have most kindly forwarded the object the Committee have In view, by granting the assistance of the Bands of theke distinguished corps whish will be United in oen Cocecal Orchestra, viz. :-the First Lif Guards, the Second Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards Blue, the Grenadier Guards, the Coldstreamn guards, tire Brats Fuedller Guards, the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Mazines (Woolwich), the Royal Marine3 (Uliatbanri, and the Ilth Hrieaors. Ttese banda wil beoeupporsed by hIL Julle'erenmowned orchestra, etrerg' honed by leading performners from the Philharmonic Societies' Her Majsesty's Theatre, and the Royal Italian Opera. The Roy-l Surrey Chboral Sciety wil also lend its aid, assisted by deputations from the principal Choral Societice In the country. The whole Wil fcrm an ensemable of upwards of 1,080 performers. The Committee, In undertaking Mrs. Seaco1's cause, are satIsBied that they only fuldil a public duty. Her kindiness to tire rick and wounded in the Crimea have establishied a strong claim uponathogenerosty of allclasses. There ca he no doubt that tirecsrvi.ces gratuitously rendered by her to the aisk and wounded of the Britihharmy before Sebastopol interfered materially with her commaersisl pursuitts. She has fallen from no fault of her own. Her businets orrangementa were exrelent. Notwithstanding her genercBity and kin ese, Eie would not only have been able to maeet all her engageiments. but even to realize an. honest Independenoo as a reward fr c constant labour and unfailing sympathy In the service and cause of oar OCimean army. However, cirmumetancestotally unforeseen put an end to the war,a,dleft her wlth alarge sick of goods and materla, (whichi It was impossible to sell or remove.) then wholly wurhetbilo, and even a source of great embarrassmient. The CommsitleefretelatlsSted thatthe BritIsh Army will unanimously on port thin tribute to Amrs Ssawle's worth, andl prove the affection anxgrtitude it feels for the servlcesl she r,rnered.. The well-known oÃ¯Â¿Â½nriespondent of The Times, who was an ese-wltsesiof her conduct,beerstestilmony to Sie,Seacols' mexits In the followtvi; terms:- "For what doesgmrs Sewcele deserve a subscriptIon 1 For courage, devotion, goodness of heast, public Eervices, great loEcre, under-ernely incurred.

PARLIAM1 TARY INTELLGENCE, fO31JSE OF LORDS, TaupSDk;Y JuiY 16. The LORD CHAxCELLoR took his seat upert )te woolsck at 5 o'clock. Lord SHAFTESBURY presented a metition from Rugby for the a,upression of the slave trade to Cuba. The noble earl alBo presented a petition from the guardians of the poor of Beaminater Union praying that the ratepayers may have the mine control over the county-rate as over the poor-rate AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. Lord BROUGHA3I, at the request of the LORD CHECEzs.Io, consented to postpone till the following day bis motion with respect to the African slave trade upon the understanding that precedence should be then given to it. [He also gave notioe of his intention to postpone till another day his motion with respect to the bankruptcy law, which stood for the following day. The'Earl of CLARENDON entered the House while the noble and learned lord was informing their lordabips that. for the convenience of the Government, he had postponed his motion with respect to the slave trade. The noble earl said he was glad that that postponement had been consented to, but at the same time expressed his anxiety that the noble and learned lord should bring forward the motion on the following day. Her Majesty's Government had not had sufficient time to consider its terms. He regretted that there should have been a necessity for postponing it even for a single day. (Hear, hear.) It was a subject which attracted a great deal of attention out of doors, and had been already discussed in the otber House. LordCOLCHESTER observed that there night be some difficulty in bringing on the motion the next day, inasmuch as two noble lords had already given notices of motions Sor that day. Lord BROUGEHAI had no doubt that after the remarks which had fallen from the noble earl the Secretary for Foreign Affails the House would give a precedence to his motion. T1E MUTINY IN INDIA. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH-Il beg to caU the attention of the noble earl opposite to a notice which has been issued by the East India Company for tenders for steamvessels to convey troops to the number of 6,000 to Calcutta, to he paid In India at the rate of 2s. Od. per rupee. About a fortnight ago I caled the attention of the noble earl to a notification on the part of the Esst India Company ordering the rate of exchango at which they lend money in India to be the same as here. It appears to me that the object of this proceeding is precisely the same, and I protest on the part of the Government of India and of the public service against any measure the effect of which is to compel payment in India at the present time by the Calcutta treasury of the same rate of interest as is paid here. I know the difficulties in which that treasury is placed. The Government of India is at present deprived of all financil resources from the North-Western districts. Madras pays for itself. Bombay is subjected to heavy charges on account of the war with Persia, and will not pay more than its own expenses. The whole additional charges arising out of the military operations connected with the mutiny must be defrayed by the treasury at Calcutta, out of the revenues of Bengal alone. These charges witl be enormous. I think the noble earl is in error when he supposes that the Government of India wiU be capable for a considerable time to moot them. The noble earl Is in error when he supposes that. there is a balance of 10,000. 0001., or anything like so large a sum, in the Calcutta Treasury. The whole of that sum of 10,000,000&, if it exists, is not in the Calcutta treasury, upon which alone these expenses will falL It is in the treasuries of Madras and Bombay, as well as that of Calcutta. Some of the treasure which belongs to Bengal is scattered all over the presidency, and a considerable portion is at Delhi, which is now in the possession of the insurgents. I believe, indeed, that three or four of these treasuries have fallen into the hands of the mutineers in consequence of tho delay in the advance of our troops, caused, as I stated the other night, by the heat of the weather, and by the want of carriage, but, as I now learn from authentic information, from the desire of General Anson to bring up a battering train. The whole of the treasure at Cacutta would not appear to be available for the purposes of the war . I understand that a lage partof it has practically been appropriated, wvile another portion is in paper, and is under present circumstances of little or no value. The only fund really available is the coin, and that, I believe, forms no very considerable part of the entire amount. Now, very heavy charges have to be borne by the Treasury in respect of freight. I judge from this notice that the same system has been pursued in regard to other transmissions of troops; and in al cases it is agreed that this freight shoul4 be paid in India. First, there is the freight of 6,000 men, 3,000 of whom are of the Queen's service and 3,000 of the Company's service, who are going out as recruits to supply vacancies in the ranks of the army. Then there is the freight of eight regimenta, which we are given to understand have already been ordered to proceed to India. Next the freight of the five regiments from China now becomes due by India, to which has to be added the expense of conveying six regiments more. There will also be the freight of the artillery and the cavaly, if they are sent out, as I trust they will be. The charge for these different items will be enormous, and if they are all to be paid in India, and not here, depend upon it the Government of Jndia will be perfectly unable to meet the heavy burden that will be thrown upon it for providing the means of transport for so vast a number of troops. This is a very serious consideration. The point ot the most essential importanoe is that the Government of India should have the means of making moveable the force sent to them. If they caunot do that the force might as well not be sent at alL I theTefore trust this matter wiU engage the attention of Her Majesty's Government. Formy own part, I feel satisfied that the moment has come when Her Majesty's Government must intervene with the credit of this cotutry to enable the Court of Directors to pay their own expenses for a considerable period without any remittanoes from India. India is inmapable of maldng those remittances without crippling her own resources-resources which it is absolutely necessary should be appropriated to furnishing .he means of movement for the army. I hope Her Majesty's Government wil afford that assistance witnout delay. It should be given to the extent of five millions sterling. The whole of that amount need not, how. ever, be all paid down at once. If a loan of 5,000,0001. were contracted for under the guarantee of Her Majesty's Government It would onlr be requisite that a sum of 600,0001. should be paid in the first month, the remainder to be raised by subsequent instalments of 400,0001. each succeeding gmonth until the entire amount is paid. It is my firm behef that a measure of this kind is indispensable, because it will-be found that the draughts and remittances from India will cripple the power of the Government of that country, and render it incapable of doing that which is imperatively demanded by the interests of the empire. (Hear, hear.) Earl GRAsVILLLE replied In a tone of voice which was almost inaudible in the gallery. He was understood, as far as we could collect, to say that he had had no opportunity of personally communicating with the authorities of India on the subjeot to which the noble earl had referred. He had, however, received information that the proposed mode of paying for the conveyance of these troops was in strict accordance with the usual practioe; and he also understood that the Governor. General had ample means at his disposal for defraying the charges for freight. The subjects to which the noble earl had adverted were of the greatest importance, and he could assure their lordships that they would receive the careful attention of the home Government. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-My lords, I do miost earnestly hope that the noble earl and the noble duke who aro so deeply interested in the affairs of India will take the trouble of looking into this matter themselves. They may depend upon it that they cannot safely trust to clerks either at the India-house or at the India Board. Unless they examine into these afrairs personally, and have before them a statement of tho funds actually in the Treasury at Cal. cutta and in all the other treasuries of India at the very latest period at which the account was rendered; unless they ask questions with respect to those funds and ascertain how far they are really avaUable for the purpose of military operations, they may rely upon it that, with the best possible intentions, they will fall into the most grievous and fatal of errors. Earl GRANVILLE was understood to say that his right hon. friend at the head of the Board of Control was not backward, in fulfilling the duties imposed upon him by the present emergency. On the contrary, he was at that moment devoting his utmost energy and attention to the condderation of every measure adapted to meet that emer. gency. The Earlof ELLENBOROUGH.-My lords, that may be the belief of Her Majesys Government, but I communilate very extensively with gentlemen connected with India, and I never meet one man among them wvho has slot the moet thorough distrust of the right hon. gentleman now at the head of the Board of Control. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) The subject then dropped. GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY (CAPITAL) BILL, On the orderfor the third reading of this Bill, Lord ST. LEONARD'S referred to the object of the measure, which he said was to settle from what fund the losses sustained by this company through the frauds committed by Leopold Pedpath, lately oneof its own officers,should be made uip. Itwassaid that atthe GreatExhibitionat Paristhis person gave 700 guineas for an article of taste which the Emperor of the French refueed to buy at this price. The losses sus- tined by the company were not the result of a single act of forgery, but of a vast number of forgeries thrown over several years, during which period the directors had shut their eyes to wbAt was geicg on, instead of taking proper 'pains to examine into the aff rs itrusted to thein. 'The chairman oÃ¯Â¿Â½the eompany. at a t ctnt meeting-of the dAae. holders, a idpoken in adistespeocofal raner ef him, and. had most. inaurately sated that he (Lord-.t.

The questlon then acsethow thee fauds should be met. The direetorstfirst roposed to capitalize the amount ofthe loss. .E had been charge- spea}in from interest on this subject,bnYhe hd 1kv ted himself - almoet thewholeof his hterestjii-the conianyin order that hemightnotbeexposed to thineharge. No maW, Indeed, who valuedhisproperywouldchotoleaveanypiouofitund such adirection. (Alaugh H)isnoble friend the Chairman of Committees (Lord l edese) thought that as.therehadbeen great neglect on the purt - of the- directors tho proPer way would be to withhold aU dividends- upon- the stock which they held by way of qualificatih until tihe losswas madeup. But the directora now proposed to meet the lose by appropriating the whole of the half.yes dividend, amounting to nearly - O,000L, to the extinction of theforged capital Iff such a proceeding could be equitably taken -the loS rInghthave been thrown over severa half-years, since there were many persons, including. women, 'whoe whole dependence. was upon the dividends of this company. and the lose and inconvenience to such persons from cutting off their half-year's income could - Ecarcely be overrated. Xhe arrangemenIt which the Bill proposed to carry itto - effectwould no doubt suit very wvellipon theStockEx-- change, but it dealt with theinterests of the preference shareholders in a manner which he truted their lordships would not sanction. He, for one, was prepared to mui',tain that, sccording to the correct vibw of the obligations Into which the directors had entered with those shareholders, - they were entitled to receive payment before the other shareholders, and he apprehended that no reasonable doubt could be raised by auybody &a to the justice of the opinion that the Act of Parliament proiided that each year should be made to enawer its own particular-engagements. If that were the case, then the losa-occasjone tothe company by the frauds which had been- committed ought, at all events, instead of being thrown over one-half, to be extended over the whole of the current-year. Hemust warn their lordships that if they were to stre at the interests of the preferential shareholders by passing the BiU as it stood, they would, while conferring a benefit upon certain parties, do much to damage railways in generaL (Hear, hear-) 'Upon public grounds, therefore, he should call upon their lordships not to take that coure. The Bill, as it had come upVtotemnfrom the House of Commons, had simply pro. vided that the money in the hands of the company hould be devoted to making good the defalcations which had taken place; but the committee of their lordshiop' House to whom the BiU had been referred, instead of allowing the clauso which had been framed with that object to continxe as it stood, had added to-it certain words to the effect that the sum necessary to make good those losses should be duly divided among all classes of the shareholders of the company,- Now, the effect of that proposition, if carried out, would be that no preferenoe sharenolder, whatever his right at law might be, would be in a position to prosecute that right either agaiDnst the directors or against the company generally. Nothing, there. fore, he should maintain, could be more unjust than the couse which the adoption of the recommehdation of the committee would sanction. The preference shareholders, - in acceding to the Bill as It had been brought up from the other Hotse of Parliament, considered that i they were zubmitting to what was a very grievous burden, and their ordships must bear in mind that at the last meeting of the shareholders which had been held 110 of those who were present were opposed to the measure as it stood, while only 105 had been m Its favour. It must also be taken into aocount that the number of ordinary was much geater than the number of preference shareholders, so thAt, of course, the latter were completely overruled by the former. As for the proxies there was very little reliance to be placed upon them, inasmuch as those who. had signed them had been told that they would not receive a dividend at all if the Bill did not pass. The subjeot was one in reference to which he had had a great number of letters addressed to him, with respect to which great public interest had been excited, and he could only say, in conclusion, that if their lordships were to pass the Bill in its present shape the infiction of a great hardship upon the preference shareholders would be the result. The promoters of the Bill, it was trae, had the opinion of the Attorney-General in their favour, but he had the opinion of other counsel to the effect that the preference shareholders were entitled to a full years interest. Under these circn. stances he should move that the words added by the committee of their lordships' House and to which he had referred,-namely, "And therefore the said sum of 243,923 5s. &d. shall be considered to have been duly divded among all classes of the shareholders of the company," be omitted, and the Bill thug allowed to stand in the slti n in which it was when it had come up from the 90=0s of Coramons. Lord WENSLEYDALE, In rising to move the amendments of which he had given notice, was understood tb say that he had been a preierence shareholder as weU as his noble and learned friend, although not to the same extent, but that he ceased to have any direct personal interest in the question, and therefore felt himself perfectly at liberby to advocate what he deemed to be the rights of the preference shareholders, The Mlarquis of WESTMINSTER said that the flrst Bili which had en prepared upon the subject treated the mis. fortune as a serious calamity, and provided that the reimbursements should be mado from the revenue of thecompany. That Bill had been oonsidered by the Attorney-General, who had expressed an opinion favourable to Its justice. It had also been discussed before a committoe of the House of Commons, and had recved the unanimous sanetionof thatcommlttee; and out of 6,000 preference shaXreholders only 79 had. petitioned aginst it. The question was wvhether the u,refer. ence shareholders should suffer a snall loss, or the other shareholders get nothing at all-For hist own part, he should support the Bill as it stood. The Earl of STRADBE,OKE was understood to support the Bill as it stood. If the'proposition of his noble and lerned friend was carried, the preferential shareholders would altogether escape froma the loess I Lord ST. LEONARD'S said that he had not argued inU favour of the preferenoe shareholders; his only object wa to restore the Bill to the state-in which It came from the House of Commons. e Lord REDESDALE said, that wbaen the first Bill was, introduced upon this subject it wasoroposed to capitalize the amount with which the conapany had been fraudulently charged. He conceived that that was a principle of a most daDgerous .liaracterj and he added to his dtsapproval of this mreasure the expression of his opinion that the directors were greatly to blame, and that If Parliament were applied to to permit the loss to be carried over a length of time it would be very proper that the dividexids payable on the directors' quqalafictiens should be suspended during that time, and appled as part of the funds to make good this loss. As concerned the Bill as it now stood he confessed he was disposed to adhere-to the decision of the proprietors, who had come to the conclusion that the loss should be paid out of tbe dividend of a sinlehalf-year. The preference shareholders rere by no means an ummportant minorty of the propretary, and, as this decision hadheen come to, he wvas not disposed to interfere with it. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY was inclined to concur in what had been said by his noble friend, and to regard these words as merely explanatory of what was the view taken by the House of Commons. A preference shareholder had no right to be relieved from his share of any hurdeci imposed upon his brother proprietors, over whom he had no advantaze except as to the priority of title to dividend when the receipts were not sufficient to satWsv the claims of all shareholaer The object of this Biu1, which was approved by a large majority at a meetini of proprietors, at which the preference shareholders were vell represented, wrs to prevent further litigation, and he therefore thought that their lordships would do greater justice to allparties by allowng the Billto remain as it had beea altered by the committee than by om itting these phra.es which were only supplemecntal wrords put in to carry out the intention ot the other House of Parliament. The House divided on the question that the words pro. poreed to be left oat stand part of the cLause, when the numbers were-- Contents ,. - 43 Non-Contents3: .. ,.. .. 7 I Majority .. .. ..3 Lord WENSLEYDALE moved the following proviso, 'l whichwas added to clause 5:-"Provlded, also, that nothing herein contained shall in any way affect the right, if any, of the company or the proprietors of the shaes therein to recover against their directors or oicers of the said company' foranynelec o micoduc o thirpart in the mMaters in the recital of this Act mentioinehd." pati- ll atr The Bill was then read a third time and passed. PRISONERS' REMOVAL BIL The Marquis of SALISBURY in -moving the second reading of this Bill made a few explanatory observations, which were almost wholly inaudible in the reporterB al lery. He was understood to Say that the object of the Bi was to remedy the evils arising from unhealthy prisons, by which the healthof prisoners was seriously affeted. Earl GRANVILLE did not oppose the second reading, but would state in committee the objections of the Government to certain portions of the Bill. After a few words from the Earl of CHisoEsTrm, The Bill was read a second time, REPRESENTATIVE PEERS (IRELAND) BILL This BUl passed through committee. CROWDED DWELLITGS PRBEVENON BItL The House having resolved Itself into committee on this Bill, The Earl of SHAFTESBIJRY said that a justification of the additional powers which the Bll Rwould grant to remedy the evilb of crowded dwellings would-be found in a repdrt of the Commissioners of Police on the subject. The Act of 1851 had been beneficial beyond. expectation. A better class of lodginghouses had sprung Up, and accommodation of a higher standard was provided without increased payw ment A case that had occurTed under the anlended Aet l furnished an example of the nature and extent of the evils which arose in lodginghouses not conrolled by lawv -. . : - "At a house, No. 17, Lincoln-court, St. CGiles's, in. one room 10 feet square, wherein three persons would beallowed by the regulations nowv enforced, seven men, nine women; c and one child Were found huddled together in.a:imost filthy - state; the bedding dirty beyond description, no partitions or ventilation; and a fewv minute3 before the visit of the - of iicer one of the women had been confined. The keeper -was summoned on the 24th of October, 1854, to Bow-street Poliee court, and fined 41, or six weeks' imprisonNot less than 48 medical men, bceing the metropolitan medical officers of their several districts, and living in the most densely crowded parts of the nmetrepolis, attested the beneticial effects of the lawr. They stated that these had been a complete cessation of fever in these lodging houses, that there had been a great diminution in other diseases, a disappearance of vermin, and anlnerease of leanliness, decency, and order. Forty medi cal men from the provincial districts gavretheir testimony| Cto the same efres.

He would take ouesample. Ilunt- stre'et tre was a lodginghouse called " Jack Sheppard's house," which tsed to be frequented bysuch adesperate clas of in. mates that the police seldom dared to visit it even in the uiharge of their duty. This ,house used to be a hotbedof .vie, crime, and disease, but it was now precisely the re- ef%e. He paid this house a visit not long W, and he omd in it imates in the common-rooasm, all peaceful Ad orderly, some engaged in --cooking, others in eating, rekdL%, or conversation.

Eie felt bound-to express-hbsdeepgrmtitude to- the Commissioners of Police for- the manner in which theg had carried into effect the provisions of the statute. e labour thereby imposed upon the police had been very great. The commissioners stated in their report.'- in" In-cenforcing the provisions-of -the Common Lodging. houses'Actsgreat care has been taken to,impress upon-the minds -of the- officers engaged in this duty the necessity of considera'ion and forbearance. The result of this system has been higbly gratif5ing. During a period exceeding five years ending-1857 about 700,655 visits have been made, both by dayXaud by might, among - class of persons deemed amost incorrigible, without the occurrence of one assault on any of the offlicers, and without one just complaint of intrusion into a ' private dwellin.' " The weekly distance travelled by the police in carrying out this Act was 800 miles, exclusive of-the labour of mounting upstairs, diving into celars, going to fetch medical men, and making their reports. Every night -from 40,000- to 50,000 persons slept in these registered lodgineghouses, and whenever he had paid night visits to these places he had found- the -Act duly-carriedc out, and the rooms strictly sweet; wholesome, and well ventilated. There was., nevertheless, something to be done, and it was necessry that a certain class of houses and rooms should,be brought within the beneficial regulations of-the Act. These were tenement houseseor tenement rooms as they were called, wrhich were eccupied by-a number of persons -profesdng -to be members of a single- family, one of whom paid the rent. The principle of English law, that ",every man's house (or room) was his castle," was here grossly abused. The magistrates, whom he did not blame, had ruled that although a single -room might be tenanted by a vast number of people, yet that if the person who hired the house or the room, and who paid the rent, declared-that al the persons living with him were members of the same family, that wan a private room or house, and could not be brought within the Act. The Report of the Metropolitan Police for 1857 gave the folowing description of one of thsee tenement rooms :- " In the occupation by families of single rooms aU the evils incident to the crowding of persons together without regard to age or sex are produced. On visitmng a house in Church-lane, St. Gites's, soon after midnight, there were found in a room, measuring 14 feet 6 inches by 14 feet- 6 inches, no less than 37 men, women, and children, all lying together on the floor like beasts, with scarcely any other covering than the clothes taken from their persons, which they had worn throughout the day. On opeuing the door lending into this loathsome place the beat was so great and theo our-so offensive as to make it nearly unsupportable. No means whatever were employed to ventilate the room, except the chimney." - Dr. Letheby, the able medical officer of the City Board of Health, said in his valuable report for the present year that there were:- "eNumerouQs instances where adults of both sexes, belonging to diflerent families, are lodged in the same room, regardlless of all the common decencies of life, herding together ike brute beasts; where all the offices of natnre ae performed in the most public and offenave sauner, where every human instnct of decency is smothered-a woian suffering in travail in the midst of males and females of dfferent families that tenant the same room, birth and death going hand in band." A scientific man would tell -their lordahips that "in-sUCh a ;polluted atmosphere it was not surprisng that epidemic and other infectious maladies should almost decimate tke populatton." These-persons, occupying tenement houses or rooms, -as he had stated, -were excluded from the eperatiou nf the - Bill, because they declared that they- wero 'l Ixmebers of the same family. The defintion of the word family, asgiven in-the Bill; -emr. braoad within its compass the relations of -grandfather and -graJadmother, and must, he thought, be regarded as suffi. de#tly liberal in its character. - It would, in fct, leave a lage number of homes which woauld - be untouched by the - la ; and yet the testimony of the inspecting sergeants of police, as well as of medical men of the greatest eminence thzoughout the country, was to the efect that, unless those houses containing asigle families were broughtunderthe control-of legislation, ,the ravages which fever and disease coimmitted among tho lower classes. culd never effectualy be put an end to. But, althounb he felt that the Bill did not go -so far as it was desirable that itahould, hehad to a great extent paid regard to the dwellings of private families notwithstanding; but it was his opinion that no great hardship would be inflicted upon them if they were, as far as possible, brought under the operation;of the Common Lodginghouses Act, and thus enabled to enjoy the advan. tages of an improved ventilation' and grester cleanlinein (Hear.) The4th clause of the-Bllgave to the Commissioners of Police the power of calling nuDon the local authorities to put into operation the Nuisances Removal Act of 1855section 29, and having stated thus mauch he believed he had put their lordships in possession at least of the saubstanoe of ithe measure. It was one of-a character very simple and -vet ahort. It conferred- no new powers, although it asmsinedsoene new detiesm and if it wore permitted topassinto a aw it would, he felt assured, conduce to the removal of many evils, the magnitude of which could be ascertainedby personal observation alone. In makdng an effort of that kind their lordships had to ,deal with a class of people who, however degraded they might seem, - were good at the bottom, and who were animated by aspiratlons nobler than their position enabled them to carry into effect. In helpint these pertons, so far as to give them the power to help themselves, their lordships would be conferring. upon them a great boon, anild he felt assured that every effort which was made in that direction would be amply repaid by the increased industry and comfort of which it would be productive, and by the gratitude which it would inevitably evoke. (Hear, hear.)- The Bill then passed'through committee. - JOINT-STOOK COMPANOlS BIL The order of the day forgoing into committee upon this Bill having been read, Lord WENSLEYDALE was understood to move the insertion of a clause to the effect that judgment creditors should not be deprived, as the Bill proposed, of that priorit of claim which the fact of having obtained a judgment under the operation of the existing lawconferrj IHiE lordship added that the creditors of the Newcastle Bank -complained of the measure in that respect, and were the advocates of the amendment -which he suggested. The LORD CHANClELLOR objected to the insertibn'o tho clause. The Bill -as it stood simply -s;ovided th#t as ,was at present. the-,case under the operation of the late Bankruptcy Act, a certain proportion of the creditors, constitutinga niajority, should lbe enabled to bAing the wholeoo' the aESetS into a common fund, of which s rateable distri-' buton might be made, notwithstanding any priority whicb judgment might be supposed to give. By that mean. equaHty in the divtnon of tha assets, would be secured, The amendment wad then iegatived, and the Bil puased through committee. REGISTRA1ON O OF NOG LEASES (SCOTLAND) BILL.

This Bill was read a second time. - THEIE NATIONAL S URVY.3 y TheDuke of BUCCLEUCI, in risinig to move that a commisson be appointed to -inquire int6 the question of whaht ivds the proper scale for a national survey, said that he was '-inclined to brring the subject before their lordahips by what-- had taken place in the other Houu of Parliament. At one -time-the l.inch scale, ,at another the 6-inch scale, and at another the 25-inch scale had -been pTroved, and each i-p turn had been -condmnmed, and he though.t that it would he; niostdesirable that the question should be finat y set at rest by the report of a commission of per-sons whose experiencee quslfied them to form a correct judguent on the subject Thea btional survey had been lingerng on since the year. 182, when the-southern counties of 'gngland had been stirveyedTon the scale of one incec to the sinile, In 184, wheh for the-pur-pose of valuatiion of towd'lands in Irelan-it was-hecessary that that country-shouldheo surveyed, a comnmitte6 of thie-other House of Parliament had, decided that a mjrvey -pn the,l.inch scale would be nseless,.and they recommenided, Ond the Government adopted their recommendation, that "the survey should be on a scale of not lesM than six inches -to- the nibi. In 1810 it was ptoposed -that Scotland- should, 'to sur-veyed onL the 6-Inch scale. -Now;- the 6-Inch scale' -v rwa too large for military or geographical pur-' -poses, but was not large enough fOr other purposes, such as tithe'computati6n or valuation, as had been proveda by the survey of Ireland on- that scae having been -flound useless for those purposes. In Irelandaforthe purpos oDf valuation a new survey had beeni tande, and If tluTe original survey had been on the 25 inch wcAle it could have been made at a less cost than had been caused by the 6-inch scale.

It had proceeded to a certain length in England when it was stopped, In order that the sarvey oC Ireland, which a committee of the House of Commons ad decded notild be on the 6-inch scale, migbt be completed. The 6-inch scle had since been found inapplicable to the ationa Or a sey, nd, acting upon that exporience, Colonel James,- the able superintendent of these operations, than- whom there - was no one better qualified to direct them, su2gested the adoption of a 25-inch sacefor the remainder of England-and for the whole of OtUland,,the survey, of which country had not been commenoeA"-It had been said that the adoption of this scale forthe worth of England and Scotland was a job to satisfy the cotitriy gentlemen oE that part of the empire. Now heF wouid fndertake to say that there was not a landed proprietorin that part of the coanitry wvho had not alrcsdy een compelled to survey hisestate for his own purposes. (Hear, heat.) The ts- soproduced, however, were not maps by which the public cod be gided, and if there-were to eanYnational document -it ll, there ought to be a national survey of the wholo country eventuallv carried out upon one scale, but which 'b -would not take upen himself &ay. The other House of Parliament had decided upon ,thescale threeor four times, and each time ithad pronounced . * diAerent opinion. He therefore though! that the course prqposed by the motion of his noble-friend opposite was the mnosi sensible one which oould be pursued in this matter. 'A:Ehon. member of the other House had said that- he -shtuld-bave no confidence-lrI any commission which might ,-beappo Uted by the Government lf a commissionw *,sppomnted, however, It should consist of such menas the presidenta of the KRoyal and Geographical Societies, joined. tth other emtnent for scielitific or legalattainments.

KUNTINGbONSHIRE ELECTION COMMITTEE. «JFho*S'_?*t?-EB' *lu"T'°e*d that ho had received aletter. ftom SirE. Dering, one of the. members appointed to inqsire^mto the vaUdity of. the election for the county of. Huntingdon, submitting soma reasons why he ventured to nope that tte House would-dispense with his attendanoe upon tiat committee. Last-year, Sir Edward stated, he was ?ent abroad on acoount of his health; he was now qnite. Competent to discharge his ordinary ParUamentary duties; bnt, as the Huntingdon electipn inquiry involved, he beUeved, a scrutiny of a protracted nature, he thought it right .fO-fxptesa ms conviction that at this moment he was phyScally incapable of undergoing the labour attendant on snch aninveshgation. Dr. Latham,1 his medical attendant, wasin attendance, and was prepared to state at the bar of the liouse that a close attendanoe in a committee wonld matenaUy injure his health. . Sir G, GREY asked whether his right hon. friend (Mr. Walpole), as the chairman of the Genoral Committee of EIections_ *as satisfied thatthe House had the power now toentertamthMe objections. .Onght they not'to have been' madeto the General Committee and decided npon by Mr. WALPOLE said the GenerabCommittee were bound to proceed according to the provisions of tbe llth an* 12th of Victoria, cap. 98. After a committee had been selected -tottyawrticulsr election petition it was the duty of the General Committee to'cive-nptlce to each of-the members, toselected. On the following day hon. gentlemen might i d,xtt8 General Committee and state their reasons why they should not be required to serve. The only objechong which could be urged were those contained in the 5S_ secKoh-^namely, "fcy reason of havine. voted atAheelection, or by reason 6f .being the party on whose behalf; the seat is claimedr orielated to Mmor -_» sitting member by kindred, or affinity in the first or second degree, according to the canon law.'' The objection- now taken was one wbich could have been recognized bythe General Committee had it been made before the .select committee *was chosen;, bnt they had no power to do so ___\.t_at\mtufai*/ts .iti4 _- A1><> ___- xm 0!_ .__._, _ - -~. . lir H, WILLOUGHBY asked how the proposed park sto be paid for.- "-» . -?.--------------^a.^v, as they had chosen it. (Hear, hear.) The House, however,: had the power of dealing with, the snbject nnder the 71st section of the Acfc w&chenactedthat "if on the day first appointed for sweating the arid committee sufficienit cause be shown to the House beforo its rising why the attendance of any momber of the cotannttee should be dispensed with, the said committee shaU be taken to be'discharged." The case.ofthe Huntingdon election was a peculiar one. There had been a double return, two of the members having poUed an equrd nnmber of votes; it was likely to be a longinqniry, and it was extremely important' that the members of any comndttee appointed should be fuUy qualified to attehd ftomthe beginning tothe end of tha proceedings, in order that the scrutiny might be properly conducted. Now, if it appeared from Dr. Latham'sevidence that one of the memDers was likely to break down-before the committee had terminated its labours it would be very desirable that the S^T*tee should be discharged and a new one appointed./ ' *'^r3 G:?BT s*!d thera oould bo hut ono feeling on this subject, and that was to consult as much as possible the feelings of hon. members in such aoso; but when they were proceeding under an Act of ParUament it was essenhal that the course adopted by the House should be sanctioned by that JAct. Now, the 69fch section enacted that if any member of the select committeo did not attend in his . pjaoe on the day appointed for swearing tho said committee.' or left the House beforo it was sworn, he should be orderedmto the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms for such neglect of tos duty, Mid should be otherwise punished or censured at the discretion of the House, "unless-it appear to the House. by fact speciaUy stated, and verified npon oath, that such member wasby a sudden accident orby necessity prevented f^om attending the House." In tha -present instance, however, there was no plea of "sudden accident or necessity-" bir Edward Dering Was inhis place; and, that being so, itappeared to him (Sir G. Grey) that the hon. baronet must be sworn. The clause quoted by his right hon. mend seemed only to give the House power, upon cause shown, to dispense with the attendance of any member' on theday fixed for swearing in the committee. ^.Sir,ir-J?iS::t?rGT0ET suggested th&t Dr. Latham should be caUed in and examined., *"<*uxu ; :*Colonel W. PATTEN iaicf the ovidence of that gentleman in regard to Sir E. Doring's health would probably ? wfBisb the House with grounds for dupe-using with the attendance'of the right hon. baronet. * ? .y The^ATTORNEY.GENERAX. was of opinionthat if Sit E.Dejrbg presented himself at the table to be sworn, but assigned reasons why his attendarioo on the select committee .monld be dispensed with, it would be competent for the House, by evidence at the bar, to inqnire into those reasons and act upon them. If there happened to be a miscarriage .ansmgoutof the technical forina' of procedure objectmn might betaken to tte inqniry as taking place coram non judice, and the whole thing would feU to the ground. ? JMr. WALPOLE, with a view to regularity in the discussion, moved that Dr. Latham bo now caUed to the bar. Mr. ROEBUCK said it seemed to him th.t tte House was about to subject Sir E. Dering to a system of torture. H'Hear," and alaugh^ The right hon. baronet (Sir G. Grey) appeared to think that Sir E. Dering onght to serve: pn the committee imta he broke down. Now, surely that was a conrse which (he House in its humanity-to say nothing of its common eenso-would not adopt. (Hear.) lhe Housfe-wasthesole judge in this matter, and was free to determine whether upon the evidence of Dr. Latham it was probable that the hon. baronot could serve upon tte committee, r ? . Sir E. DERING was exceedingly sorry that his ease 'S°T._ have taken up so much of * the time of theHouse.' He did not know that he could add anything to the statements contained in his letter to the Speaker. If this had* ftfeen an ordinary election .committee he shouldnot have* attempted to shirk the duty imposed on him ; but. hearingthatit would involve a scrutiny and the investigation of 2pQ separate cases, be thought it was only right to express a conviction that he was at this moment physicaUy inwiDable bf serving upon suoh a committee. *^ 1 The*motion was then agreed to, and . *^ Dr. Latham was caUed in and examined.

LONDO1V, YRIDJ Y. JULY 17, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, Lord Er ENIBOnouGo again brought before their Lordships the prospects of India, and recommended ,that the Government should at once contract a loan for 5,U00,000. to relieve her finances of the burden the present mutiny, with all its unfortunate consequences, would cast upon them. An animated discussion then ensued upon the Great Northern Railway Bill, in which Lord -St. LEONARD'S took a prominent part. The Bill upon a division was read a third time and passed. Several Bills were then forwardedc a stage with-out much discuasion, and their Lordships then adjourned. The House of Commons, at a mornint sitting, after some proceedings relative to the attendance of aSir E. DErING upon the committee appointed to -determine the election for the county of Hunting-don, and with reference to certain other election matters, went into committee upon the Lunatics <Scotland) Bill. In the evening, in reply to Mr. W. VANsiTrA;T, MIr. V. SMrrT said he believed it was true, as teported in the Indian newspapers, that the Lieu-tenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces of India had issued a proclamation in which he ofrered -an amnesty to 11 mutineers who laid down their -arms, and that the Governor-General had expressed his dissatisfaction thereat, and ordered it to be with'drawn; but not that the Lieutenant-Governor had tendered his resignation. Colonel FRENCH moved that the SPErXJ3a do isue his writ to the Clerk of the CRowNr in Ireland to make out anew writ for the electing a hurgess -for the borough of Galway in the room of Mr. A. ,,O'FlusEnry. Lord LovAInh moved, by way of amendment, that the writ be suspended till Thirsday next. After a few words from Sir G. GREY, the motion vras withdrawn and the amendment agreed to. Mr. ScOn FiELD moved that the SRAIREPR do mot issme his warrant to the Clerk of the CBOWN in Ireland to make out a new writ for the electing of a knight of the shire for the county of Mayo before Thursclay next. After & short discussion, in wlhich an attempt was made to discuss the report of the Committ-ee, the motion was agreed to. On the order for going into a Committee of Supply, Air. ROXBUoC moved the following resolutions "That the war with Persia was declared, prosecuted, and concluded without information of such transactions being communicated to Parliameiit while expensive armaments were equipped without the sanction of a vote of this House; and that euch conduct tends to weaken, its just authority, and to dispense with its constitutional control over the finances of the country, and renders it requisitefor this House to express its strong reprobation of such a course of proceeding." He complained th"tethe House had been entirely passed over in this imatter, and that it had a right to inquire into the priiciples upon which the expedition had been undeAtaken, for which the expenses it was to be called -ripon to vote had been incurred. He affirmed that a more contemptuous mode of proceeding had nevdr been adopted by a Minister since the llouse had baenr a House of Comumons; and he asked whethe, the H ouse was prepared to undergo such an insult. Hfe denounced Lord P smBRbTro as an enemy bf the House anid of England. I ' - The CuAwcELLon of the ExcEnsQm astid the ground upon which the war had been undertakennamely, the occupation of Herat by Persia, and, in reply to Mr. ROEBsCK'S objection, that no special communication had been made to Parliamenj upon the subject of the war, he observed that noie had been made on the former expedition to Karrak and Bushire, there being no doubt of the prerogative of the CRowN to declare war, and of the right hf the Governor-General of India to commence hostilitiee in the East. He was at a loss, therefore, he said, to know how vMr. RoEBtuc could maintain that there had been any irregularity committed, or the siha]1est disrespect offered to Parliament. 'He denieji that the events in India could be connected, as Mr. RoBBUCX had attempted to do, with the migiy rahal of troops from India to the Persian Gulf. Mr. NtSof ri, speaking from experience andjobservation in India, attributed the mutiny priariaily to over-indulgence towards high-caste Sepoys arid the paucity of European officers. Mr. BAIILSE assumed as a fact that money had been expended in the Persian war without !the consent of Parliament. Hle then considered what was the real objeot of the war, which he contended was the dismissal of the Sadr Azim, the Persian Migister, all other demands having been conceded a. Constantinople by FRuxHr KHAN, and this object had not been attained. Lastly, he discussed the past conduct and policy of this country towards tersia, which, he maintained, had been short-sighted and injudicious, and he indicated what in his opinion ought to be our policy. Lord BURy condemned the war as tending to no good end, and as backed by no good cause, co4sidering the alleged object of the war entirely chimerical. He reviewed the history of our political relations with Persia from the time of Sir JoENs MAicoLar and Sir RPI.FOltD JONES, and insisted that the march of a Russian army through Central1 Asia, even with Herat as a base of operations, win1practicable. Mr. DANBY Satoux observed that the question was whether the Government had done right;nde- laring and prosecuting the war with Persia w7thout communicating to Parliament, at an unusual -time of the year, a war which wras essentially an tndian war, for it was undertaken because Persia persisted in a course which had been held by Indian states' men one of direct hostility to our empire in the East. He admitted that it was our interest to(cudltivate the friendship of Persia, but if, in the guise of neutrality, she took advantage of her positio&'V6 break her treaty engagements, wre should makefier feel our arms; and thiis had been the attitude taken. by EBBa MAJESTY'S Government. Mr. WIOUGHIBY approved the policy adopted. by the Government towards Persia, though opimon's1 might differ, he confessed, as to the mode in whioh: that policy should be carried out. . , Sir Wv. WILLAis observed that, within his personal knowledge, the desiens of Russia upon India were the theme of conversation throughout the 1astx Under these circumstances the war with Persia was, in his opinion, politic. If the finger of Russia wap, seen at Herat, that of England was seen at *ob4imerah. Lord J. RTuss=r said Mr. RoEBsuc had raised two questions,-jirst, as to the control of the House over grants of money; and, secondly, the policy of the Persian war. With regard to the first, the House having been in a great measure a consenting party, and, although he did not think the Government altogether without blame, it did not amount to so grave a charge as to render it necessary forthe House to come to so strong a resolution. As to: the second question, be believed that as good a convention might have been had as we had got withod a war, upon the basis of the concessions made by FEituxH KHAN at Constantinople, or by the means of temperate diploniatic discussions. In conclusion) he observed that the only way to keep peace wai by endeavouring to smooth down quarrela, and telling our agents that it was not our interest or our wish to inflame differences. MIr. WALPOLE said, with regard to the policy of the war, he agreed with Lord J. Ruis.LL; but, in respect to the constitutional question, as to the commencement of the war, aud involving the country in expense without any communication to Parlhament, he wvasldisi; pointed at the tone of that noble lord. It was clear from the papers that the Government had actually incurred expenses on account of this war long before any announcement was made to Parliament,. which ought to have been called together 4is soonas any expenditure had been resolved upon. Vhis was a constitutional question of the greatest mwjhitude, and the House had a right to ask from' the Government some more ssatisfactory inforinaaion than it had hitherto received. He should not hepa. tive Air. RoEBucK's motion; he should vote for going into a Committee of Supply, but upon the distict understanding that the Government of this country were not to involve it in the expenses of a waT without the knowledge of Parliament. Colonel SYKES defended the Government, entirely concurring, he said, in the measures adopted by them forprevouting Persia fromtaking possession of Herat, which was the key of India. Mr. V. S&NuTB denied that it was constitutionally the duty of a Minister of the CRowxv to consult Parliament before going to war or making peace; and he questioned, moreover, the policy of disclosing to the world our intentions when hostilities were contempluted. The caUing Parliament together specialy might have been prejudicial to the public interests. When Parliament did meet the papers were laid before it as soon as the negotiations were brought to a close. In considering the policy of the war he alluded to the unfriendly temper manifested for a series of years by tbe Persian Court, and to the proofs that it eagerly coveted the possession of Herat, which, he contended, ought to be in the hands of an Affghan chief. He denied that the same treaty could have been had at Constautinople as at Paris. The powers of `ERuHr {HAN were defective at the former place, and the negotiations were broken off by him. IYr. GLADsTow observed that the question raised by 1Ir. ROEBUC}e'S motion was one of extraordinary gravity and interest. He took an unfavourable view of the policy of the Persian war, and was sceptical as to the world-wide importance ascribed to the city of Herat. The power of England had nothing to. fear so long as it was exercised with justice, though-our own folly might create difficulties and dangers. -The policy of the Persian war, however, was not .embraced in the terms of the motion; but, as peace had been mnade on terms less unfavourable to Persia than Persia her-elf had offered, we had gone to war for an object which, as soon as we commenced hostilities, we found it inexpedient to pursue or unattainable, the original sine qtu non being the dismissal of the SADi AzA:. As.to the eonstitutional question, the authority of Parliament would be greatly curtailed if whatever could be done by a Minister by means of an Indian army and an Indian Executive might be begun, continued,andended without its assent ; but he denivd that the Persian war ought to be exempt from the control of Parliament. Adverting, however, to the fact that the circumstances referred to in the first resmlMtion occurred prior to the dissolution, he was rwilling to waive pressing hom.. that resolution psovideed he had a security that the liberties and rDivileges of . that House weaa- guaranteed agains' the form'lablae dangers involved in the pre4culn.

The: question was, whether the pfemiisses justified .the conclusion which the fouse was asked to 4iive at. He agreed that the Eouse had not been'tr6afed with candour; but he could ,nct get o-er'the; act that, on the meeting of Parliament, -there was no announcement of the war with Persia in HEE MAjrsTT's Speech ; that was the occasion when this question ought to.-have been mooted, and he could not agree to a resolution which a{irmed that the war had been declaredw prosecuted, and concluded Without any information being communicated to Parliament.: He should;,therefore, vote for going into a Committee 6f Supply. ' Upon a divisiBo the -motion for going into committee was carried (thereby negativing Mr. RoxBuoC's resolution) by' 352 to 38. The House then went into Committee of Supply, but the Chairmuan was immediately ordered to report progress. ' I A resolution of the Committee of Supply, relative to Civil Contingencies, reserved from Wednesday, was then considered. Sir H. WILLOuGEBY requested explanations- respecting these votes, which were furnished by Mr. WMSON. I The resolution was agreed to. The Fraudulent Trustees Bill was read a t6ird time and passed. Other Bills were forwarded a stage, and the remaining business having been disposed of the House adjourned at half-past 1 o'clock.
Everybody who lives in a raral paradise, surrounded by-:.a bold yeomanry and a. simple Ieasantry, and carrying out, as far as rates and taxes will allow, the idea of an old English gentleman, knows 'what- it is to receive a long bill? in the fift ci61igraphl#, from the builder or -ar-:. penter of the neighbouring town. It is a wlholly ' bee6ftedplesua& "H e had never once-included MÃ¯Â¿Â½r. -BnR'ST mu hui estimate of iChrifstmas hout'ong's i"'e Eaud included everything-post-horses,' .Whis=tin$s.boxes; 1sutÃ¯Â¿Â½criptions, and all sorts of odds'. and ends--but he did think he had sb*n. his wild oats in the building line long ago. tot, as he opens the bill, it stretches as long 'as :a'Pa4oraria; of the thine, or the Kings 'of England, or LEroiREIL's list of his mastbr's 'amours. -The old English gentleman casts his eyes down, and. they are arrested by the- well-knoWn items, i'"2,500 best bricks, 1,200 ditto," &c.; go nang feet of Memel of such a scantling, Bo much planking, so many loads of lime, so many hundred Counteas 3lates, 'four carpenters and six labourdrs :five .weeks and three days; then so anaiiysquare feet of Yorkshire flags; then two carpent6rs three weekl. and . one day, the bla^ksmitlh; plumnbei, painter, glazier, ;&c., &c., &c., and .by the time our friend has run his eyes 'dow'n six such columns, and been tantalized by a promised deduction. for old material, he comes to the final figures against him,-2721. 15s. 4id. Astonisbed and disgusted he rings the bell, an4 asks what it is all about. 13e gave no orders to anybody. He does -not Inow what it is all for. But, by the aid of his servantj: ho jutt remembers that early in the year 'the gardener said something one day about a toolshed and a frame or two; and the bailiff said there wasn't a place fit to put the cows in; and. by and by he alrso remembers he did one day meet two men with a ladder, and saw a wheelbarrow and some planks where he didn't expect them. On inquiry he finds that he sufffAr that curse of kings, according to our old great dramatist, too willing agents. If he only breai6ad a wish, or was too idle to protest in time, an army of men was set to work; and, little as he thought it, he was running up a long bill. -The result is, that whereas he never touches a cun:umber, a melon, or a grape, im season or out of season, and is of opinion that French beans are the identical husks in Scripture of c" which the swine did eat," he will now have these at least a fortnight earlier than he had before; and, whereas he never takes either milk or cream, his cows may now hope to escape the annual cow influenza; and, whereas the gardener used to be always digging or hoeing in the garden, he is now always pottering about something or other in the toolhouse, and wants another assistant. Now, that is confessedly our case in this Persian war. The Shah of PERSiA knew all about this war, and that an expedition was actually coming out against him, long before we did. The British public knew nothing about it till the fleet was already in the Persian Gulf; and if there had been a revolution at home, Queen VicroTrA sent to Gotha or Berlin, and Mr. COBDEN installed as Protector at Whitehall, it could not have been in timne to stop the capture of Bushire. The British public had nothing to do with it, excepting only in the choice of the man who did aUl this. There, of course, we must plead guilty. With Lord PALzmts!roN for our Premier we cannot honestly pretend much objection to war. Yet on former occasions there has been a good deal of barking before it got to biting. There have been two or three Conferences, an exchange of angry notes, a mediation or two, a demonstration, a peaceful intervention, a hostile intervention, and everything that could prepare the public mind for the dread reality of war. In this instance there was no suclh attempt to break the tidings. All at once we heard we were at war, and had to learn the reason why at our leisure. Then, besides the capture of a small fort and the dispersion of a few hundred men some miles from Busbire, half a day's work at Mohaminerali, and a quarter of an hour up the river, there was realy nothing done to caU a war. At least, if there was a war, if we gained any signal advantage over Persia, if the expedition. did its work, that ought to appear in the Trty. But to this day nobody can venture to assert that we obtained a better Treaty by the war than we eoild have done without it, or that tOe terms obtained at lat were palpably better than those refused at first. Of course, in a matter in which we were all left so much in the dark, and in which the terms of the TreaV. only arrivedwhen people had' forgotten the wart we mnust plead very indifferent means of knowlQd4e.

The 15th clause of Sir ERsxiim Pmitr's BiU for altering the law of husband and 'wife provides That the Act siall not extend to Scotland or Ireland, and the members for those portions of the United Kingdom assert that no other proision in the Bill is equally free from objection. The 16th and final clause, creating the short title of " the "Married Woman's' Property Aot; 1857," v,ill .ssuredly requre alteration. The- attempt -to 'attach a date to- s6 novel an essay in: -legislation vifl- for m'a3in years, if not for some generations, be altogether premature. The lUnder-Secretary for the Home Department voted for-the second Teaditg on .the assurance of the mover that the ATToRsNn-GmrERAL Lad assented to the principle of: the measure. In future it might 'be more convenient if the members of the Government would communi. cate with, each other on the conduct'of Patliamentary business. Sir RrcHAnD BETnrLr may probably have agreed that some change in the law 'was required, but it can scarcely be supposed that he wished the time of the House to be taken up in discussing the provisions of an impossible Bill. If a Cabinet Minister had been present on Wednesday, he could scarcely have failed to vote against the second reading; and when an 'Under-Secretary temporarily represents the Governmen1 he ought to be intrusted with the discretidnary Power which is necessary for the conduct of business. The opportunity of paying a compliient to Sir ERs=E PFuRy was hardly a sufficient excuse for affirming a doctrine which scarcely a single member of the House is prepared to carry out in practice. The recital of the preamble that "the law of "property with respect to married women is un"just in principle" is opposed to the deliberate convictions of at least nineteen-twentieths of the whole community. It is idle to inquire whether abstract justice favours the independence -of married women. English society has from time immemorial been founded on an assumption bre-] cisely opposite. The framers of the Bill calculate on the careless adhesion of those who think that married women are in certain contingencies treated with hardship, but only an insignificant section of Sir E. Punny'S supporters would seriously maintain that the husband ought to be a stranger to the property of his wife. The preamble, which has passed its s: cond reading, is as absurd as if a recital in some Bill for the amendment of commercial law should declare that " the law of property with respect to "debtor and creditor is unjust in principle." The further assertion that the law of husband and wife " presses with peculiar severity on the " poorer classes of the community" is at the same time untrne and gratuitous. The enactments of the Bill are, with few exceptions, intended for the benefit of the wealthier class of women. The wives of labourers are wholly indifferent to. the right of retaining the ante-nuptial property, real and personal, which they never dreamt of Possessing. Daily food and cottage fiurniture admit of no divided ownership, and, except in an inappreciable minority of cases, they are wholly provided by the strong arm that " wins the bairns' " bread." Happily, no Act of- Parliament would in tbis. respect alter the practical condition of the mass of the population. Women in all ranks are culpably indifferent to law, although they are the most faithful guardians of tradition" and custom. No Legislature would persuade the vives of the working classes tbat their husbands were =iot the owners of their property, or, on the other hand, that the man was not bound to maintain the woman. The hard cases in which washerwomen and domestic servants are plundered by worthless busbands might be redresssd without any imputaticn of injustice against the inimxemorial laW of England. Sir ERSum1- PEuRBY rrotests that the principlo of the Bill is exclasive)y eontained in the preamble; but the first clause, ishich. provides that a married woman shall hav.e ihe rights and liabilities of a feme' sole, would sf itself' constitute a startling revolution.

The authors of -the Bill have probably not considered the additional, responsibility which might arise from the speculations of one of their married femes soles.. Private feeling and public, opinion would give a- great advantage to a creditor who had prudently arrested a lady with half-a-dozen small children on the eve of her seventh confinement. The husband would probably be of opinioki that, under the circumstances, his owin arrest would have been a less stringent mode of procedure and, even if he were disposed to acquiesce in the consequences of modern legislation, the clamour of his female friends and neighbours would inevita4y compel him to take the place of the unhappy -victim. Perhaps it is a waste of time to point out the absurdities of a Bill which can by no possibility pass into a law. The Constitution supplies n'pr'elminary check to the activity of amateur le&ls6ators. The discredit of frivolous proposals and o'f idle discussions falls upon those who cou'ntenance the introduction of measures. wlilch they utterly disapprove. In allow;ing 'Slir Emxu3INt PEny'S Bill to pass the secolld rdiding the Government has practically postponedthe introduction of serious measures for the amendment of the condition of married women. Paliament would willingly take into consideration any reasonable project for the protection of helpless individuals against exceptional injustice; but a " Married Woman's Property Ace' which leaves the rights of married men out of consideratioi- 'is' an idle waste of time and of legislative dignity. It is culpable to court -the friendship of outlying Liberal members by concessions which are mad at the public expense, inasmuch as they involve a sacrifice of the respect due to the House`of commols. - = - -
Yesterday afternoon there was held a meeting of members of the House of Commions at the King's Arms Hotel, in Palace-yard, to consider what should be done with reference to the Parliamentary Oaths Bill. Four times a Bill has been sent up to the House of Lords which wvuld have freed the Conimons from the difficulty in which they were placed by the mere ?orm in which the Oath of Abjuration was required to be taken. Four times the Lords have rejected the -successive Bills which have' been sent up to them, and have by their conduct proved that they repudiate 'all idea of a compromise. Utnder these circumstances what is to be done ? Al thoughts of consideration, courtesy, and accommodation being rejected, we are, despite of ourselves, driven back to submit the' original cause of dispute to a fresh examination. Have the Loids any concern at all with the form in which an Oath shall be taken in the House of Comimons? Is not this a point purely within the discretion of the Lower Hlouse ? The dispute is not as to the subject-matter of the Oath. The Oath of Abjuration is sufficiently absurd when considered in reference to the circumstances of our own time; but, still, while it is required by law that it should be taken, an Act of Parliament must unbind that which an Act of Parliament has so firnly bound. Upon this 'point there is no dispute. A Jew is just as ready as a Protestant to take this antiquated and effete Oath,- and to be bound by its requirements. The controversy is merely as to form; it is a question of hats on or hats off. The framers of the Abjuration Oath never had it in contemplation to exclude the British Jew from Parliament. N\ever until the bigotry of the Upper HIouse fastened upon this point, as upon one which might give it scope for its appropriate action, was such a notion as that of the exclusion of the Jevws from Parliament ever entertained. The exclusion of the Roman Catholic-the exclusion of the Dissenter-has from time to time been deemred a political necessity, and hastherefore been enacted ; but, if it be really politic and right to' import religious animosities into our legislation, let us do so in a bold and straightforward manner, by a statute enacted for the purpose. Let the Peers pass and send down to the Commons a Bill vhich shall deprive the Qur=z's subjects of theJewish persuasion of their birthrightto sit in the Lower House of Parliament when duly elected , aud if such a Bill receives th& sanction of the two other branches of the Legiszlhture we havenot another word to say. Everybody knowsv,however, that such a preposterous effort- would be. de- feated at once, and that an exclading Bill of thenature proposed would be at once rejected by the Assembly which it principally concerns. What, then, is to be done T The QuW's Jewvsh subjects, are debarred, as we have said, from their birthright ; the Peers arrogate to~ tbemselves the right of regulating the manner and form it which Oaths shall be taLen by, the Commons, while they themselves assume- the most trauscendant privileges with' rsgard ie m=atters which concern the internal zagulatikn- of their own Assembly, and reject every effort at conciliation. TJnder these ckumstsnces it is that the meeting at the KIingaArma was held yesterday to consider what woun3 be the most proper course for the Lower House X- pursue. Mere is a ca in whbich the Peers have evidently not consideredvwith suffiecientprecisicn whattheeffect of their own,, pertinacity would be, if they drove matters to eXtremities.

SECOND EDITION. THB TIMES-OFFICE, Friday Mo7nang. FRANCE. (BY SuBMBARIN AND BTrnuS TErLEBA}IH.) We have received the following telegraphio despatch from our Paris correspondent:- C' PARIS, JULY 17, 8.30 A.M. "The poet Bc'ranger is dead. The expenses of his funeral will be charged to the Imperial Civil List." EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Thursday), 6 p.m.:- Of the Italians who were at first atrested on the serious charge of conspiring against the Emperor's life, and who are stiU in prison, one or two have avowed their guilt; the others deny it. I am assured that in the course of the investigations conducted by the authorities no complicity has been brought home to any of the French refugees of note in England. The conspiracy is Italian, and essentially MlIazzinian; and the object assassination. A Commission of Inquiry is sent by the Government to Italy to collect further information as to the extent of the plot. This will retard the trial, which takes place before the Court of Assize instead of the Bigh Court of Justice. Admiral Trehouart has received orders to proceed to Tunis with a division of the Toulon fleet. The Admiral's command expires in August next. The Emperor had appointed Admiral Dubourdieu to succeed him. Since the sudden death of the latter, Admiral Romain-Deafosx6s has been selected for the command: the decree will shortly appear in the iAflrniteur. The Grand Duke Constantine has addressed an autograph letter to the widow of Admiral D ubourdieu expressing his regret on hearing of his loss. It was the Admiral who received his Imperial Eighness during his visit to Marseilles. A circular has been addressed to the French Consuls containing the rules and regulations to be followed in the interpretation of the now Russian Customs' tariff. The circular has also been commnunicated to the French Chambors of Commerce. The official report of the operations against the Xabyles, published in the Moniteur of the 14th, has, I suspect, been a 1ittle modified. It admits the desperate determination of the mountaineers, and the loss occasioned by the " vivacity" of their attack on the evening of the 29th, while the French were returning to their camp. The Kabyle3 had planned an ambuscade, and poured into the French ranks an incessant and murderous fire. On one occasion-the attack of, I believe, the village of Ail-Azds--from every ravine, peak, and orag issued such a storm of bullets, that even the Zouaves, all daring as they are, qualled before it, and lay down on the ground. For some time entreaties, reproaches, and threats were unavailing to get them on to the attack, and it was only after a flank movement by the Foreign Legion that the position of the Babyles, impregnable in front, was turned, and the enemy dislodged. It is ascertained that there were many French deserters among the Kabyles, men apparently of ability and experience, and under whose directions the Kabyle3 fortified themselves and fought during the late operation3. Several promotions will take place-generals of brigade advinced to generals of division and colonels to generals. I am again assured of General M'Mahon's approaching nomination to the dignity of Marahal of France. The General has been all that might have been expected in the Kabyle campaign, but it is rather for his conduct in the Crimea that the batonM will be conferred on him. The French Government has received despatches from the Chinese Seas to the 25th May. At that date the frigates Virginie and Capricieuse and the steam cutter Marceau were anchored in the roads Of Macao; the brig Nisus and the steam corvette Catinat were anchored in the harbour of Hongkong. The Virginie was to quit Macao on the 5th June, to proceed to Manila, where Admiral Guerin is to meet Admiral Rigault de Genouilly. The news of Baron Gros's mission had been received in China. The Univers takes a more favourable view of the state of things in India than its contemporaries; it thus expresses itself:- " India has never been guarded to the extent that an in. surrection or a serious movement could at once be suppressed. Either from system or from necessity, the E3st India Company has drawn back before the immense expense that would attend a military establishment capable of at. taining that result. It has preferred, hitherto, to rtn the risk of the losses and dangers which are now experienced rather tisan to organize the defence of the country in a com. plete manner. It reckons on the internal divisions of the Indians, on the forces it can concentrate in course of time, and, above all, en the facility with which it can gain over and corrupt the most important of the native chiefs. The deserLion of 30,0)0 out of 200,000 Sepoys is, after aUl, not so unfortunate for England, for a greater number of desertions might have been anticipated. We raust, moreover aw.it more detailed intelligence before asserting that the insurrections in the north of ldia are of serious imporance."1 A letter from Rome of the 11th Just. informs us that the Pope was atill at Bologna. On the 7th His Holiness assisted at a solemuf4te given by the University of that city. His Holinezs officiated in the church of Saint Mary of the Sciences. After Divine service Cardinal Poggi delivered an address in which he demonstrated the services which religion lias in all ages rendered to literature, science, and the arts. The Moniteur de 'A rmie publishes a sketch of the life oX Colonel Pisacane from the period when he resigned his commission in the French army, in the year 1848, to his death after his late unfortunate attempt to excite an insurrection in Calabria. After he quitted the French service he went to Genoa, and thence to Naples. He took a part in the insurrection in that city, which he did :not quit until order was restored. He continued nevertheless, to serve the revolutionists, and held a commission in the Roman army when the French attacked and captured Rome. Pisacane then withdrew with Mazzini to London, from whom during his short government he received the rank of Colonel. The celebrated conspirator, wishing to try a movement against the King of Naples, cast his eye on Pisacane to command the insurgents. In vain did the Colonel, taking a military view of the affair, object to the attempt as badly planned and having no chance of success. Mazzini persisted, and he was obeyed. Pisacane, " impelled" says the Moniteur "by fatality," landed in Calabria, wnere he met neither aid nor sympathy. His band was destroyed by the Royal troops, except a few who were taken prisoners. He himself, wounded in the first action, shot himself, to avoid the fate which awaited him. The Moniteur de 'Armnae adds:- "Pisacane is one of the most melancholy vlctims of Mazzini and of the revolationary sphrit, which is regarded, with reason, as the curse of Italy. This young man, who, by his merit, his courage, and the honourable rank held by his family, might have created for himself a distinguished name in the military profession, and who had the honour t be received into tho ranks of the French army, was reduced at a later period, to placo himself in the pay of a cos. mnopolite conspirator, and to die obscurely in the mountains of Caabria. He, at least, srifliced sis life, while Mazzini, after having impelled him to the fatal act vhich was his destruotion, avoided by flight, as he always does, the conse. quences of his disastrous enterprise." The Monaiteur says:- "I The news of the harvest in the neighbourhood of Paris, pS well as the accounts from the departments, continues to be most satisfactory. The rye, already cut on many points, gives promiEe of an excellent yield, and the dry ani warm weather now prevailing allows the catting of what is still growing to be actively continued. As to wheat, both quantity and quality may be expected. Although in some places the storms had laid large tracts, still no very great mischief was done, and a far better crop than thab of last year is expected. At Argentenil and Suresna, the wines of which enter so largely into the consumption of Paris, the vines are loaded with grapes, and a large crop may be looked for. The reputation of Montreuil, near Paris, for peaches is well known, the cultivation of that fruit having been pursued there for upwards of two centuries. The crop of this year promises to be unusually large." The Moniteur publishes the official return of the taxes and indirect revenue for the first six months of the present year, amounting to 526,017,000f., and being an increase of 26,285,000f. over the corresponding period of 1856, and of 83,055,000f. over that of 1855. In comparingthereceipts for the last six months with the corresponding period of 1856, the items of revenue which show the greatest improvement are Customs'; duty on sundry merchandise, 6,682,000f.; ditto on foreign sugar, 4,743,000f.; ditto on ditto from French colonies, 166,000f. ; potable liquors, 6,069,000f. ; eale of tobacco, 5,157,000f.; ditto of gtupowder, 345,000f.; daty on salt, 1,494,000f.; registration dues, 757,000f. ; stamp duties, 689,000f.; navigation dues, 186,000f. ; sundries, 1,095,ooof. ; and transit charge for foreign letters, 62,000f.

I shall take up the thread of my narrative at the point where it was interrupted in my last letter. We had two very different statements of the position of affairs before us, and so indeed have we stil, but I can more confidently affirm now that the Govern ment seems to have had the best of it ia the recent collision. Publicity on the part of the authoritie3 Xs 8o unusual a circumstance in this country that I must confess I looked upon the report with some suspicion, but I believe it was true, and that the insurgents who landed at Sapri have been crushed. It remains for me now to give you a history of recent transactions. The attempt was anticipated here in Naples some weeks since, by a very small body of men, disciples of Mazzini, and it is not unlikely that they urged that the present time was highly propitious for a descent upon the coast. Deluded by these representations, and without combination or preparation, 25 men-men, it muat be confessed, in every sense of the term-took out passports, and secured places for Constantinople, on board the steamer Cagliari, which was leaving Genoa. A quantity of ammunition had been sent on board, with their luggage, and had escaped suspicion. The vessel was no sooner out of sight of land than the conspirators went below and put on their uniforms, consisting of a Phrygian cap, green shirt, and red trousers, after the fashion of Garibaldi. They then rushed up and took possession of the vessel. As we already know, they steered for Ponza, and left it at midnight, having induced 400 of the soldiers on guarl and in exile to join them. On the followving morning early (being Sunday), they landed at Sapri, a little village on the Gulf of Policastro, famous in the bloody chronicles of this country as the residence of the Priest Peruso, who is said to have murdered and cut off the head of Deputy Carducci, in 1818, and afterwards brought it up to Naples as an acceptable present. Sapri is a very Royalist place, and the insurgents at the first stop met with a check. They were ill received, and some bloodshed was the immediate consequence, and houses of Peruso and his friends, I am informed, were burnt. Here, and en route to Torraca, the first day's march, they managed to make some addition to their forces. There they reposed and cut the wires of the electric telegraph, without, however, destroying the s6naphores. What skirmishing took place during Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday I do not as yet know, but on Wednes- day there must have been a grand encounter, with the results already given in the supplement which I sent you in my last. That report would indicate that a butchery took place, to account for the slaughter of 100 persons in so comparatively small a force, and it is said that, even after they were taken, many of the prisoners were shot. It is perfectly credible, though it cannot be vouched for; at the same time, the report of the Piazza gives the number of Rifles shot as being 50 and the wounded 150, while the Gendarmeslost 10 menkilled andseveral wounded. Itis possible thatthese figures will have to be rectified. Though, therefore, this particular attempt seems to have been put down, there can be no reason to doubt that skirmishing continued in several directions. Some people, in different localities, felt encouraged to declare for the insurgents under the impression that the insurrection was more general, and was of a national character. An electric telegraphic despatch, as also private couriers, communicated the intelligence that fighting was going.on in several places. The hopes of many were stilrhigh, while the Government was evidently under some apprehension from the preparations which it continued to make. On Saturday morning, at three hours after midnight, Prince Louis was in the Arsenal, giving directions and urging on the preparation of steamers, and sending off troops. It may be that, as is reported, these measures are simply precautionary; they are, however, prompted by an apprehension, with the full grounds for which we are not sufficiently well acquainted. One thing is very certain, that, in a country so infamously misgoverned as this country in, there must always be danger; the country is always heaving, and, if a great explosion does not take place, it Is only because of the overwhelming force. The day must and will come, however, and it will be a dies is-ce indeed-a day which no man has seen since the times of the French Revolution. It is easy to predict, it may be said, but in the Two Sicilies a man may dare to do so, for never, do I most advisedly say, did the elements of havoc and bloodshed exist to such an extent as they do in this kingdom at the present moment. It would be leaving my nar rative imperfect were I not to record that on Saturday, at 11 o'clock, the Royal steamer the Fieramosca, towed her prize (Cagliari) into port, with Piedmontese colours flying at the stern. She is a very fine vessel, sister of the Sardinia, which trades in the Mediterranean. She has oa board her crew, consirsting of 32 men, and as passengers two women, four children, and the Secretary of the Dey of Tunis; a Neapolitan officer was of course on board. In the Cagliari there were eigat prisoners only, and in chlusi, fine-lookino men, who were apparently indifferent to their position. A question suggests itself, where are the rest of the insurgent, if eight only have been brought up to Naples ? A well-informed person tells me that scaffolds are already preparing at the Vicaria for the execution of these men. It may or may not b true, but, according to the law of nations, such must be the result to be anticipated, and this Government knows no mercy; but it is the bes; commentary on the disgraceful state of things hera that the strict administration of justice wiU awaken no aympathy, but rather create in a tenfold ratio conspirators againSt the Government. Why is this? Because, such are the grievous oppressions unde: which men groan in the Two Sicilies, that conspiracy is raised to the dignity of virtue. I cannot, however, conclude this letter without explaining why this attempt has not been more generally sup. ported. First, because it is supposed to have originated with the Mazziniani. Like their masterclever, vigorous, unscrupulous, willing to. be martyrs to their principles, they are disliked and distrusted by the Neapolitans as impracticable dreamers, as those who have already done much to impede the cause of liberty in Italy, and in the pursuit of the object are indifferena to means. Secondly, the late attempt has been unsupported because of the want of combinatioa and preparation. The 25 heroic men-for, despite their imprudence and their crime in sacrificing so uselessly the lives of such a number of persons, they were heroes, and will live in history-these 25 men, I say, came like a meteor upon the country. No sgns announced their approach, and their landing awakened only wonder and resitance. They were of the right metal to conduct a good cause, and the imprudence is to be lamented which has sacrificed so much life, and has compromised rational and constitutional liberty. A protest, I understand, Is now in the course of preparation by the sound and healthy portion of the Liberals, who are the vast majority here, against the recent attempt, and against Mazzini. The feeling now entertained here towards him is as strong ai that which is entertained against the Sovereign into whose hands he most effectively, though most unwillingly, plays. The Elba, on coming up from Messina the other day, was boarded by the Tancredi, and cruisers ar e continually out along the coast. Among other places, troops were landed at Paola to reinforce General de Rivera, inthe Calabrias. They consistel of four companies of 11 rifles, which were first sen. in pursuit of the insurgents. JULY 9. I have already hazarded the opinion that the attempt at Ponza and Sapri, however bold and dashing considered by itself, apart from all its consequences, was the mad design of the Mazzinian party. The Neapolitans have adopted the same view, and are indignant at follies which aim at objects with which they have no sympathy, and which become criminal from failure. The Neapolitans give expression to their sentiments in the following declaration:- "An attempt so mad and rash has produced a melancholy impression in Naples, whtch has striven to show its aversioa from that movement. The bearing of this country has been admirable for its good sense. Naples has alwayi rejected with horror the absurdities and the impieties of th 3 Mazziniani. In the midst of the enormities of the Govern. ment, she has not, like the Mazziniani, calculated on ths irritation of the people to drive them to desperation, for Naples well understands the end at which she incessantly aims, and the means which are best adapted to it. This end is her right-legality, constitutional guarantees. The kingdom revolted in 1820. 1830, 1847, and 1849, only for constitutional freedom. The unhappy Bandieras contending for the republic in the Calabrias were left alone; the Romcos had a large number of followers for the Constitution. The very Government was compelled to affect a zeal for the Constitution in order to suppress the movement in the Calabrias-a movemant which was made in 1849 to ensure the liberties acquired in the preceding year. This country is more practical than i imagined, and blood is now shed only for the real sdvantag3 of the country, and not for any mad attempts. The distrio of Saprihad no previous warning of so stranugea visitas that of the Mazziusans and of the delinquents of Ponza. Without any provision whatever, they announced the Republic wit,. acts of violeneo to which necessity compelled them, so that the people of the country were compelled to defend their dwellings and their property against persons to them of a strange aspect and an unknown tongue, and who gave no signs of conciliation. The caDital is in a state of con. sternation by reason of tSiis grievous episode, and though it betrayed no sympathy for that madness, it sees itself harassed more than ever by the police, by arrests of many quiet persons, and by threats of fire and plunder." To the details with which I have already furnishe i you I have little or nothing to add. The Cagliari was taken within view of the Island of Capri; and, as some say, the captain and 12 other persons were broug,ht in chaius to Naples, and then were taken manacled in five carriages to the prisons of the Vicaria. It is not known whether these individuals were taken on board the Cagliari or on land. About 30 persons of the crew were still remaining. The authors of the fact who left with Ithe Cagliari amounted to 31. In Ponza there were about 250 prisoners, of whom it is uncertain how many foUowed the 31 conspirators. Most of these prisoners wereundertheorders ofthepolice for acts of dishonesty or theft; there were few politicalprisoners, as 1 now understand that men of this class and the military in disgrace were in Ventotene. Many of the prisoners in the islands have now been sent to the bagno of Isachia and there kept in chains. The fate of those detained in Montesarchio becomes severer, according to the most recent reports. Admiral Lyons left Turin on the 13th for Geno i, having on the preceding day had the honour of dining at the Royal table. The Piedmontese cabinet experienced a sligh' check in the Senate on the I 1tb, when the biU for a new convention with the Transatlantic Company of Genoa, strongly advocated by the Minister of Finance, was rejected by a majority of 32 to 24. The Piedmoietese Gazette of the 13th publishes the law enacting that all prisons destined for persoai under trial shall henceforth be constructed accordin to the cellular system, and those already existing be reduced to it. Persons condemned to a term of Jiprisonment not exceeding one year may also be confined in such prisons. AMERICA. (BY ELECTB1C TELEGRATH.) LIVERPOOL, FRIDAY YORNwG.

CHIARGE OF LIBEI,,-ThIVERPOOL, July 15.-The criminal charge of libel against Mr. Onsley. editor and proprietor of the Liverpool Herald, for an alleged impeachment of the chastity of three Roman Catholic priests in the Isle oE Man, has been adjourneduntilTuesday week. Thearticle in question sets out by an attack upon the Romish institution of the celibacy of the priesthood, points to the temptas tion such a law engenders, and states that in the priest's house, Isle of Man, three priests have three young and pretty servant girls to attend upon them. The writer, after asking what necessity there is for three domestiecs says he does not impute anything indeoorous or im. moral to those entlemen, but he knows, " from high authority of the Papal Chrch (Deru), that her priests are permitted, under certain circumstances, to violatetheir vows of celibacy." After quoting, upon this subject, from Dens' OTeology, the writer thus concludes :-" We hopeand know nothing to the contrary-the three priests at Douglas are as pure as snow; yet we tramble for the temptation of flesh and blood, especially where, as we have shown, one priest can absolve another. Very few wolves can be found to rest quietly in the same fold with lambs." The three priests are the Revs. James Carr, John Hawkegworth, and Gerald O'Reillv.

ELECTION COMMITTEES. WpRV1WATT''TT This committee, consisting of Mr. W. T. gerton. tho chairman, Mr. Fagan, Mr. 1. B. Horafall, Sir J. Walsh, znd Mr. W. H. Wickham, met at 12 o'clock yesterday morn. 31g. Mr. Slade and Mr. Clerk appoarod for the petitionersMr. Edwin Jaines, Mr. Phinn, Mr. Power, and Mr. Lefevre represented thesitting members. There are two petitions against this retnrn, tffo first from Mr. G. Mi. Btutt, the late member, complaining of the return of Mr. Campbell, and prying that the petitioner may be declared dtlly elected; the other, from some electors of the borough againAt Colonel Freestun, as well as Mr. CampbelL The petitions contain the usual allegations of bribery, treat. ing ad int'itlildation. . SILADB, first opened the caso of Mr. Batt. HEo obeerved that strong political feeling had long prevailed in the borough, and that a considerable portion of it belonged to the Johnson family, which therefore exercised great Influence over the coustituency. He then briefly sketched the circumstances of the various contested elections which had taken place in the borough shnce the passing of the Reform Act, in crder to show that the sucoessful candidates were always returned by very small majorities. Previous to the lsst election the borough was represented by Mr. Butt and Colonel Free8tun and at the last dissolution those gentlemen again came forward Another candidate, Mr..Campbell, took the field, upon extreme Liberal principles, aud after a short time Mr. Canpbelland Colonel Freestun coalesced, using the same committee rooms and employing the same agenta. When Mr. CampbeU came to the borough he was a porfe *t nger, but he was received as the candidate of the Great Weser Ramilway Company. The committee were aware that that line now extended to Weymouth, through which a communication had been established by large steamers between the north and west of England and the Channel Islands and France. The constituency, deductng those names which had been placed twice upon the registr, con. sisted of 606 voters, and Mr. Butt's canvass; previous to the election, was ver successul, as he received no less than 300 promises. I those promises had been performed Mr. Butt would have been placed at the head of the poll. The result of the polling, however, was-Freestun, 446 votes; Campbell, 49 ; Butt, 272. In the course of the election Mr. Butt discovered that bribery was be. ing carried on by his opponent, Mr. Campbell, in such an open and flagrant manner that he issued an address to the electors, sa,ting that all the votes given to Mr. Camp. hell would be thrown away, as he could not possibly retain his seat,in consequence of the corrupt practices to which he had resorted. The learned counsel then mentionedl varIous cases of bribery, with respect to which evidenoe would be given. A voter named Simmons had said that he would not vote without being paid;he received 10l.,andhevotedforMr. Campbell. A cobbler, named Vile, had been canvassed by Mr. Campbel who gave him an order for three pairs of slippers and aL pair of boots. Vile went to a shop and bought the articles, and then sent them to Mr. Cam IL Thea were worth about 21., but Mr. Campbell sent ile a check for 104. Apparently he felt some misgxvings with regaird-to this transaction, for he afterwards had the check returned to him, and sent 41. instead. Othor cases of a similar character would be proved, and it would be made clear to the committee that Mr. Campbell could not be allowed to retain his seat. The usual formal evidence having been given, the electlon accounts were produced, from which it appeared that the expenses of the respective candidates were--Butt, 191.; Freestun, 2741. a nd Campbell, 558C. Mr. Andrew Iichard Cartis was then called, and stated that he had canvassed a voter named Bonella and his son-inlaw, Thomas Newman, for Mr. Butt. Bonella refused to give him an answer. O6n the polling-day he met Bonella and Newman on the North Quay. Heagain asked Bonuella for his vote. Newman then said he should not vote until be was paid his expenses for voting for Colonel Freestin at the previous election. Bonella also sid he would not vote for any one until Newman's expenses ha been paid. On cross-examination he said he had not been active in gtting up the petition. He believed Bonells voted for Mr. Btt, Bonella kept a beerhounse, and was supplied with beer by Mr. Devenish, witnes?z employer. He might have owed Mr. Devenish as much as 401. at the nomination. In the election week a large quantity of beer was snut to Bonella's honse by Mr. Devenish. Bonella's character was not paricularly good. He might have been fined four or five times. BoneDs was stil in Mr. Devenish's debt. Mr. Devenish seconded Mr. Butt at the nomination. Maria Bonella, the wife of the voter mentioned by the last witness, said that her husband kept the Freemasons' Arms. She rememberod her son Thomas Newman saying to Simmons, a marine store dealer, that he would not vote ntl he had been paid his expenses for voting at the last election, and that Colonel Freestun owed him 6 lOs. Simmons went away and returned in about half an hour. About an hour afterwards her husband and her son ient to the polL Her son said he had got his debt, and would now go'and pay the rent. He accordingly pald 4. Us. 6d. for rent. heowedforthreequarters rent,andhersonpaidit for her. On. cross-examination by Mr. B. JTAEs the witness said that her son had sent in his claim to the agent several times, but had not been able to obtain payment. She could not tell how much Mr. Devenish was owed at the time of the election, but he refused to supply more beer until he had been paid. Her husband votes just before the close of the polL On the morning of the election 36 gallons of beer were sent in which he ad ordered the evening before. Mr. Dennis, an old friend, had to pass his word for the maney before it was sent. She had not yet paidfor it. Thomas Newman, son of the last witness, said that at the last election Freestan's party owed him 61. Os. for expenses for coming from Brldport and drink that had been given away. On the polling-day Simmons asked him how his father was going to vote. Witness said his father should not vote for any one until his debt was paid. Simmons said that if hisfather would vote for Freestun and Campbell he would paythe debt. Simmnons took sixsovereigns out of his pocket and gave them to him, and his father then went out to vote. When his father had gone Simmons sald he should have the other lOs. after his father had voted for Freestun and CampbelL His father came back and sadd he had voted for Freestun and Butt, and Simmons refused to let him have the other lOs. because his father did not vote for Campbell. On cross-examination the witness said that Simmons asked for his father's vtoteabout haltfan hour after the beer came in from Mr. Devenish's. Mr. Devenis had cauvassed his father and asked him to take his father to the poll The beer was ordered of a man named Holt. He told Mr. Devenish, in the presence of Colonel Freestun, that his father should not vote until the debt to him was paidL He showed the six sovereigns he had received from Simmons to Mr. Devenish when hlr. Devenish called, and Mr. Devenish told him to "hold them hard." On re-examination the witness said that Mr. Devenish did not say a word about the beer when he canvassed his father-in-lavw. The committee then adjourned until this day. MALDON. This committee sat for the first time yesterday. Its members are Sir J. Trollope, chairman- Mr. H. J. Baii, Mr. W. E. Baxter, Colonel Shafto, and the Hon. A. Cole. Counsel for the petitioners, Mr. E. James, Mr. Slade, and Mr. Rodwell; for the sitting members, Mrx. Phinn, Mr. Welsby, Mr. Charnock, and Mr. Bushby. There are two petitions in this case, the first signed by Mr. George xL A. Peacocke, against the return of Mr. Thomas Sutton Western - the other signed by three electors named Clarke, Gepp, and Spurgeon, against the return of Mr. Bramley-Moore. rx. E. JAmuEs, in opening the case, said that Mr. Peacooke complained that the return of the sitting member had been obtained by bribery, undue influence, and treating, After referring to the previous history of the borough, which, he observed, was an old offender, Mr. James said that in 1852 a contest took place between Nr. Peacocke, Mr. Bramley-Moore, and lMr. Lennard, and the two former gentlemen were returned. In 1856 Mr. WVestern issued an address, and in January, 1857, commenced a canvass. The nomination took p lace on the 26th and the election on the 28th of Marcb, the candidates being Mr. Peacooke, Mr. Bramley-Moore, and Mr. Western. The resultof the poling was Western, 427; Bramley-Moore, 405 ; and Peacocke, 360. The constituency consisted of 879 electors, of whom 500 were the old freemen,who had so longdisgraced theborough. The head-quarters of Mr. Western's committee was at the King's Head. The returning-officer was the mayor, Mr. P'ayne, who was an active partisan of Mr. Western. It would be proved that the maor had appointed a gentleman as election auditor, who was the partner of Mrr. WFestern's election agent, Mir. Digby; that the offices of the election agent and of the auditor were at the same place; that the accounts had been tampered with; and that voters had been treated by the mayor, and taken to the pol in conveyances belonging to him to plump for Mr. Western. At a place called Tollesbury, within the borough, but about five miles from the town, there were 36 freemen, poor and corrupt, and in January it had been intimated to them by a person named Howe that Mr. Western would distribute some coals among them. Coalswere accordingly distribated, and at the election 19 of them, who had before voted for the Conservatives, plumped for Mr. Western. He might state that Mr. Western was unconnected with the place, and that the coals were, he believed, given to freemen only. He then proceeded to mention cases of individnal bribery alleged to have boen committed bythe agents of Mr. Western. A miller named Riley had offered a voter to let him have flour during the winter for is. a-bushel leessthan he had been payinH. E e had also promised another voter, a car- penter, that he should have th contra_ct for rep_air'ln_ t_ho church if he voted for Mr. Western, and that hene not trouble himself about charging a few pounds more or less. The old practice of colourable payments to voters for loss of timehad also been resorted to in order to induce the colliers engaged in the coal trade between the borough and Sunderhund to go to the poll. With regard to treating it would be proved that the Wellington, a house at which 1r. Western was present on the day of the election, was an open house on that day, and that the account for what had been supplied to the voters was sent in to Riley. The system of supplying breakfasts had been extensively carried on-so extensively, indeed, that Mr. Digby, the agent, became alarmed, and suggested to the wife of one of the voters that she need not know where her husband had breakfasted on the morning of the election. The learned counsel concluded by submitting that if he proved the facts he had stated the return must be declared void. The usual resolutions having been greed to, ana formal proof of the return given in evidence. Zachariah Lewis, a voter living at Tollesbury, proved that he had received a cwt. of coals at Mr. Banekling's houso in January last. The coals, he was told, were ven to him an the other poor of the parish by two madenladles of mhalde who subscribed 10!. for them. George Howe was pront when the eals were given away. He had been canvase by and had voted fer Western and Moore. He was taen to laldon on the polling day in a van. He had a plut of beer and some dinner. 1He went tc the pell alone. 'e was an old freeman, and sometimes votad zor the blu,i, sosnetianes for the yellows, tX get his bread. On cross-examination the witnes said t'at the last eleotion was a very dry one, and tbat the eoals were given soon af'ter Christmas to freemen of all partie,1, and to widows and the wives of men who were absent. William Harvey,whbo had supoeiniended the &itribtLtlotq of the cogls at Mr. Batihklug's, proved that Mr. Howo had paid It. for them. I Sarah Rice, whose husband had received cnals and voted for Peacocke and Moore, tated that lir. Westerna and Mr. Howe had canvassed ber husband, and that Mr. Howe had mid to Mr.Western "these people had coals." Shobelievcd that all sorts of people received coals. Two other ntnesses, named Farrell and Martin, gave similar evidence, az.d The CHAiRVAN then intimated that it would be a vwast of time to call any more witnesses with regard to the coa Mr. RODWELDLsaid be would proceed with cases of direct bribery, and called a witness named Gill, from whom, however, nothing was elicted. Abraham Stratford, a ship's carpenter, who was avoter of laidon, but was working at Ipewich at the last election, stated that a Mr. Cross bad told him that if he went to Maddon and voted for Mr. Western his legal expenses would be paid him. He went to Maldon, and voted for Mr. Western, His fare by the Parliamentary train was 2s. l1Ã¯Â¿Â½d. each way. The day before the election hereceived 15s. for his legal eXPeDnsfs rom a person named Eeebles, in the employment of Metcalf, who had accompanied Cross to Lis house. Nothing was said when he received the money about voting for Western. He should not have gone to Maldon unless bis expenses had been paid Mr. Metcalf was caled and said that Stratford had told him be was anxious to vote for Mr. Western, hut could not do EO unless his expenses were paid, and, after hearing from Mfr. IHenry May, of Maldon, he told Str3tford that he might have 15s. for his legal expenses. He had not yet been re- the 15s., but expected that Mr. May would repay E. Gossett, a voter, said he had been canvassed one day during the election by Mr. Western, young Mr. Digby, and other gentlemen. He did not promise his vote. That evenin; Riley, who was a churochwarden, "ame to him and told him that the Woodham Walter church wanted repairing, and that he should have the job and be well paid or it. The monev came light and was spent llght. He did not promise his vote to lUey. He voted for Peacocke an ooro. On cros-examination he said his estimate for the repairs was 41. 8a, which Riley thought too much. Charles Gill said he had been canvassed by Mr. Western, but had voted for Moore and Peacocke. About three weeks ago hu had gone to Mr. Digby, and said he expected Chenery would have to come up and give evidenoe, and he sked for l0s. for Chenery. Mr. DIgby made no reply. mary Chenery, the daughter of a voter, stated tha last Marchnher father sent her with a letter to Mr. Benthall, asking for the loan of 10s. She received the money from Mr. Benthall and spent it in shopping. John Staples, the captain of a collier, who had plumped for Mr. Western, was then examined, but said he had received no money, nor had he claimed any, on account of having voted, either before or after the election. He had come from Snnderland. Another captain of a trading vessel was called who had come from Hartlepool, but he made a similar statement. Joseph Brown proved that Mr. Riley, the miler, ha cdriven two voters to the Wellington, at Maldon, and then to the poll. A witnegs named Ann Blanks was examined, but stated nothing material. On the application of Mr. SLA6D] the committee aajourned at 3 o'clock, as no maore witnesse were then int attendance, until this morning. BATH. The comraittee sat yesterday, and proceeded with the sctiny from fl until 2, when it adiourned to enable the chairman, M1r.

AfONEY-MARKBT ard CITY INTBLLIGBNUB. Thursday Evening. The Bank of England have lowered their rate of discount to-day from 6 per cent., at which it had atood since the 18th ult., to 5i per cent. This movement merely ftilfilt the general expectation. The increase in the bullion since the last change in the rate is 607,00i:l1., and, as the stock is still steadily augmenting, there waa no reason for hesitation. Some persons have supposed even that a drop to 5 per cent. was not improbable; but on no occasion within the past 10 years, except in May last, when the step was soon proved to have been premature, have the Bank lowered their rate to that point without the amount of bullion being considerably higher than it is at present. Pending the harvest, therefore, and with the contingencies of the Indian war before us an alteration greater than that now resolved upon would hardly have appeared prudent. The funds have again been very heavy to-day, but a partial recovery took place late in the afternoon. Consols for money opened at tho final quotation of last evening-91 to J, and upon the announcement that thle Bauk Court, after a very short sitting, had reduced the rate of discount, the market assumed a slightly firmer tone. A further succession of speculative sales then commenced, and the last official transactions 'were at 91 i to i for money and 91 j to J for the account. After regular hours, ho-wever, operations were entered into for the account at 91g. The depressing influence during the day seemed principally to consist of a report that the Government are about to propose a loan of 5, 000,0001for the service of the East India Company, but this would be wholly inconsistent with precedent, aince the financial wants of India are always met from the resources of that country, while at the same time it is understood that the company hold at present in London 2,000,0001. of Exchequer-bills, which wiU be amply sufficient for all their immediate wants. Of course, these Exchequer-bills cannot be put upon the market with. out causing a violent fall, unless some arrangement to facilitate the process be made with the Government or the Bank of England; but, as the proceeds will be applied for the most part to payments in this country for the hire of steamships, &c., there will be no withdrawal of the money calculated to lead to continued inconvenience. In India the supply of bullion in the several Government treasuries previouslytotheoutbreakwas 12,000,0001. and the amount in the h?nds of the general popula' tion was beyond all former experience. The capacity of the country, therefore, to meet any increase of taxation is very great, and the ability of the local Government to raise money wiU most probably be found simply to depend upon whether the rate offered is 5, 6, or 7 per cent. The present Indian debt is about 50,000,0001., of which the greater portion consists of 4 per cent. stock, and, assuming tbe capture of Delhi to have been effected, there is no reason to suppose that any difliculty would be experienced at Calcutta in raising 5,000,0001. or 10,000,0001. to meet aU the extraordinary wants of the next year or two. With regard to the EDglish Exchequer it must be repeated that the despatch of troops now going on will not involve a shilling of expense to ourGoverunment, since directly they are ordered for service in India their pay and all other requirements are provided for by the India Company. Bank Stock left off at 213k to 215; Reduced, 91, to i ; New Three per Cents., 91 to -i; India Stock, 213 to 210; Exchequer-bonds, 98ft to {; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discoant to par. India Bonjds continue lo show extreme heaviness. the last price being 20s. to IOs. discotnt. These securities bear 4 per cent., and the holders can claim to be paid off after a year's notice. At the end of that time, therefore, the India Company would have either to meet the amount, or to increase the rate of interest, unless meanwhile the value of money should have becomo so much reduced that they could raise it without difficulty at the same or on lower terms. In the Stock-Exchange to-day money was in increased request, and at the Bank there was a good demand, although some transactions took place in the discount-market at 5i per cent. The discount establishments have lowered their rate of allowance to 44 per cent. for money at call, and to 5 per cent. for deposits, with seven days' notice, being a reduction of a half per cent. The rate of the joint-stock banks for deposits will be 4* per cent. Foreign securities have been in good demand throughout the day, bat at generally lower prices. Much business was done in Turkish Six per Cents. at a partial recovery from the late decline. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed there was no alteration for money, but for the account they were a shade higher. Buenos Ayres were negotiated at 841; Chilian Six per Cents., 102i; Mexican, 22; Peruvian Four-and-a,Half per Cents., for the account, 80k; Portuguese, 45; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97, 96# ; ditto, Small, 98; Spanish, 40; the Certificates, bj; Turkish Six per Cents., 94$, , ; ditto, for the account, 93k, 94k, 94 ; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 102:, 102; for the account, 102 ; and the Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64. After official hours a further rise took place in Turkish of about i per cent. A further sum of 70,0001. in Australian and American gold was sold at the Bank to-day. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 6(f. 90c. for money and 66f. 95c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of between 1 and i per cent., owing to a preponderance of money purchases. If nations or individuals, when once they have taken to speculation, could ever be warned by an escape, France might be exDected from this moment to abjure all the fascinations of the Bourse. The lettors from Paris to-day state that a feeling seems to be growing up that the lowest stage of depression is past, and that hencoforth a steady, although a slow, recovery may be hoped for. But the universal exclamation is, what would have happened if there had been a bad harvest? All the operators-that is to say society at large, with the exception of those adventurers who swept off their winnings in time, leaving the uninitiated to their fate-have been beaten down by a year of pressure which has stopped short only of total ruin, and even yet, notwithatanding the prevailing expectation, it is not certain if the end is c me, since the turning of a straw has hitherto been sufficient each day to add to the existing gloom. Under these circumstances, let the consequences be pictured, not of an utter failure, but of merely an indiflerent grain crop I If the promise of unequalled abundance in this respect, coupled with a splendid vintage after many years of loss, is scarcely sufficient to beget a sign of cheerfulness, wrhat would have been the recklessness and despair if it had been absent ? The fatt- of the country has been riskeduponuncertainties worse thanthe turn or adce. The chan ces were not between ruiu or wealth, but simply ruin or the escape from it. The career of the Cr6dit Mobilier and its satellites has terminated but in this, that, with everything in its favour, it has not utterly destroyed the credit and prosperity of the eutire community. This conclusion, it may be presumed, will not be contested by M. Pereire himself. He admits the prevalence of great despondency and trouble, anid wll hardly at the present momuent, when the land is teeming with the signs of bounty, dare to attribute it to in- scrutable visitations of Providence. Neither can he attribute it to vicious mistakes on the part of any particular class of the people, since the Government dictate the channels of enterprise and the foresight has been extolled that created the Credit Mobilier to regulate the whole. The lesson, therefore, cannot be explained away or blotted out. The only question is, will it be accepted or defied? If it be accepted, the penalties already experienced may be expected to give place to a steady return of confidence and health ; if, on the other hand, " luck " is still to bethe word, there is no need to dilate on consequences which will he plain to the apprehension of all who believe that this is not the principle on which the world is governed. Judging rcm the latest symptoms, there is little to encourage a hope that the better course will be taken. The "exalted wisdom" of the Government coniinues to be proclaimed. It is therefore to be preapniwq that no consiousues of error is entertained, and, although it seems they hava lately been presented by one ot the leaders of the mania with elaborate calculations to show that during the recent crisis the floating wealth of the country has been diminished by an awfful number of millions, it was only with the view ot insistaiig that instead of withdrawing from the board they should take courage from the gifts Do-v poirinig upon the land, and order the stakes to be doubled. It is alleged that an attempt is about to be made to open a subscription in London for a rwlw 6 per cent. Turkish loan of 6,000,0001. or 8,00o,oiJ(w. at the price of 84, upon the security of certai i State mines, &c., with the view of paying off the Sultan's private debts, and sevaral current l..ans made hy capitalists at Constantinople, now rtnning at about 20 per cent. A Vienna and a Lonlon housc are connected with the scheme, and the stock, it is said, is to be issued to them at 82, or 2 per cent. below the price at which it will be offered to the public. The affair seems preposterous. The eager capitalists ot Constantinople are the best judges of the value of ths security offered, and if they require 20 per cent. interest, or any rate much higher than that proposed in this country, we may be sure that the bargain for us would be a very questionable one. At a meeting of the London Jointa-Stock Bank, held to-day, Mr. Tilson in the chair, the report and accounts were unanimously adopted, aud a dividend declared of 61. 5s. per cent., with a bonus of 10s. per share, both free of income-tax, being together at the rate of 22ipercent. per annuw. Annexed are the report and accounts:- "1 The accounts which the directors now submit to the shareholders show that the net profit of the hank for the past six months amounts to 76.7461. This result enables the directors to declare a dividend at the rate of 12 , per cent. per annum, and a bonus of 10s. per share, leaving a balance of 9,2461. for division at the end of the year. * LONDONJ OINT-STOOK BANK L Le.BrTrs AND AssEce JUNE B0, )857.

Rocca, who failed on the 31st of December last, with liabilities for 77,0001., chiefly in connexion with the house of D. Trasciatti, of Trieste, a composition of 4s. 6d. in the pound was accepted. A Bill promoted by the mortgagees of the Westminster Improvement Commission, to aid them in realizing their securities, was yesterday thrown out by the Parliamentary committee to which it had been referred. It was opposed by the Committee of Bondholders of which Mr. Beaumont is chairman. From the cross-examination of Mr. Hope Scott it appeared that the case of the opposition was that under the proposed Bill the mortgagees might get paid, but if so there would be nothing left for the bondholders, and, therefore, as the latter could not realize without further power, it was a ease for a compromise Bill rather than a Bil to enable the mortgagees to perfect their securities. Among the mortgagees promoting the Bill were-the London and County Bank, the Commercial Bank, Messrs. Backhouse, and other bankers. But the evidence of the validity of some of the mortgages seemed doubtful. The committee decided that on the promoters' own showing the preamble was not proved. The colonial wool sales opened this afternoon, and there was a numerous attendance both of home and foreign buyers. Much animation was exhibited, and in Sydney wool an advance may be quoted of Id. to lid. from the concluding sales of the last series. The rise on Port Phillip wool was Id., and fully Id. on most kinds of Cape wool; South Australian also realized an improvement. About 77,000 bales are offered. The sales will conclude on the 22d of August. La Plata West India steamer to-morrow will take ont 19,5001. in gold. These remittances, it is believed, are mostly for the purchase of silver. The following on the European silk crop is from Messrs. Draper, Pietroni, and Co.:- "According to the numerous Teports we received from almost allthe plans of production about the European crop, it results that in France, the Two SiCilies, the Papal States, Tuscany, and Levant the yield is one eighth to one. fourth better than last year, but in Lombardy, Venice, and Piedmont, which together produce more than all the rent of Europe, the crop is one-half of that of Last year-viz., onefourth of an ordinary cro0, 11 It would result fron; this that the European crop this year may be considered under that of last year by about 20 to 25 per cent."

COMMITTEE FORP PRIVILEaES. HOUSE OF BORDS. JuLy 16. THE GREAT SHr5WsmSrv PA qv Thelr Lordships met this morning at 11 o?clock to resme the hearing of the evidence In this case, which, from the appearance of the Howse and the Peeresses' Gallery, eemed to excite considerable interest. The registries of Albrighton, Salwarpo, and other places were produced by various witnesses for the purpose Of proving the burial of several of thopersons mentionedinthe pedigroe. The Rev. Dr. Winter, a Roman Catholi priest, said he had formerly been private chaplain to the -late earl. HE saw him-buried. Cross-examinedL-In a conversation he had with the 16th earl, the predecessor of the late earl, he was told that ' Lord Talbot of Ingestre had no more clain to the title and estates than this writing pen." The earl at the same time held up a pen in his handL Re-examined-The earl mado that remark in consequence of witness having told him he had heard a rumour that i the event of Bertram Arthur's death Lord Talbot would sneceed to the title and estates. By Lord ST. LEONxABs.-No more conversation took place on the subject. He asked the earl the question abruptly. Bertram Arthur, afterwards the 17th earl, was the nephew of the 16th earlo and was living in the same house with his uncle when the conversation occurred. Proof was then given of the death of the rema'inin 3mem'bers of the second branch without leaving issue, and thus the seond line of the pedigree was completed. With respect to the third linea curious book caUed the " Benefactors' Book ' s tendered, containing a pedigree allegedtobe edb Sir Gilbert, the son of Sir John of Albighton, anT'the Drether of John of Salwarpe. The ongin of tis book was as foows :-At the time of the 8eat fire of London the Herds' College was burnt down and in order to raise the then large sum of 5,000 for the ose of puh ing lad and rebuilding tho Colle a RoTyal Corni-on issued, diedb to the nobility an4 gentry, urging them to raise the necessary fund, and irecting the Heralds to make a book, to be caled the " Benefactors'," in which the pedigrees of all persons so subsecribing wero to be entered, "together with their marriages, issue, and liberality, for the remembrance of future ages." In the first place, proof was tendered of the authenticity of Sir Gilbert's signature by means of an acknowledged authentio will being placed before experts in the art of com ng handwritings, and then the sgnature in the " Benefactors "'Was showa them. Mr. Serjeant BYI;E3 objected to this method of proceedin. Sir t. TnGsrozM contended that their Lordships would hear this evidence, because, in the first place, if they were bound by the rules of civil judicature, they muat receive the evidence in accordance vdth the Act of Parliament; nd, secondly, if they were not bound by the Act they wouldnotreiect theuselves what they had considered a aust and convenient course to be adopted by other tri- After some further discusdon the proof of the hand. writing was admitted, and several persons skilled in the art gave it as their oplnion that the handwriting in the will nd that of the signature in the "Benefactors"' was the uame. The pedigree entered in the " Benefactors' n was then tendered as evidence upon two grounds,-ist, as an official document, and secondly as a pedigree signed by a member of the family, and containing statements respecting that family. Mr. Serjeaut BYLBs objected to the entry being given in evidence,-flirst, upon the ground that it was not an official document, inasmuch a anli}e the Heralds' "Visitations" no search was required to be made by tho Heralds before the entry was made for the purpose of establishing its truth; and, secondly, because the entry, having been made with the intention of its being made an official document, it could notbe cailed a private ped{gro signed by a member of the family. The ATIORNZY-GZ2MUJ. msid that he considered the entry was not an official document, and, inasmuch as there were several blank in the pedigree, be did not think it could be admitted as evidence. Sir F. K7Y submitted that the pedigro did not pretend to be complete, but merely to be true as far as it went. He contended that it ought to be received in evidence. LordST. IiEoAnaD's saidthat the " Benefactors"' had been admitted in evidence in 1804 by their Lordahips in the Do Ros peerage. Sir F. LrY saidthat if there had been any ground of objection the Attorney-General of the day would not have allowed it to be received in evidence. The LoRD }CSicnLLOr. said that this was a very important point, -ad his trong conviction was that, leaving open all question as to the weight that ought to be given to it, it ought to be received in evidence unon the ground that the " Benefactors"' was legitimate evidence to satisfy their Lordships that this was a pedigree made by a member of the family, whether signed by him or not; the signature being merelyforthepurposeofshowingwhothepersonwaswhodrew up the pedigree. n his opinion the book had been inproper custody. At all events, they might take it safely a satement made by a member of the family as to the state of the family at the time. It was not now necessary to say whether, if there had been no proof of the handwriting, that it would have been admissible in evidence, but at the same he did not think that the " Benefactors"' stood upon the same footing with the iHeralds' " Visitations," which wore quasi judicil proceedings. I the present case there was no evidence to show that the Heralds made any search before the entered the pedigree to ascertain its correctness. The other Lords having concurred, The " Benefactors " was put in evidence, and the entry read. Athi tng olnf the prooeedings their Lordships adjourned. The further hearing Will be resumed to-morrow morning at half-past 10 o'clock.
SIR COLIN CAMPBELr AND SIR PATICK GRANT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Personally unaÃ¯Â¿Â½quainted with both these glant officers, and feelng certain that they wil heartily co-operate when thoy meet in India, I still cannot, with the knowledge I possess of the Bengal Presidency and the Bengal Sepoy, refrain from offering some remarks on one passage in the letter from Colonel Sterling in 2hc Times of this morning. Colonel Sterling treats as a weakness and a prejudice that kindly feeling towards their men which has hitherto been the general characteristic of those by whom for a century past has been discharged the difficult and delicate task of holding so singularly compounded a body as the Bengal native army together. That army, thus sldlfully handled, has ever been found efficient for all of that service within the limits of India for which alone it was raised. When service beyond those limits was required volunteers were to be found ready upon certain oondeitons to engagc for It, and the conduct of the battalions thas drawn from the line justified in every instance the confidence reposed in them by those who commanded the expeditions to Egypt, to the Mauritius, and to But, while the Bengal army vas found for nearly a century to be tractable and faithful,it waswellknown thatthere was one point which, roughly or even indiscreetly touched, would stir them to frenzy. That one point has of late been to some among ourselves what the one room was to Blue Beard's wife, and an Itching to meddle with it may prove as fatal to us as did the Eastern lady's curiosity to her. The point in question is, of course, thatof caste. Closely connected as the Bengal Sepoy is with the community from which he Is taken, he is liable to be agitated by every misgiving that may arise in the minds of his countrymen as to our ulterior designs. Without touching on the question of religious obligation and duty, we may record it as a fact that a desire for, and even an anticipation of, the approaching downfall of Hindooism is now avowed at publio meet. ings and in publio papers both in England and India. How well these avowals are known to the educated natives I could prove, if I had room, by extracts from recent letters of their writing; with what effect the venom thence extracted has been difaneod among our native soldiery may be understood from what is now going on. The measures pointed out to the sepoys as indicative of our dealqns are stated in a letter that appears in the last Bomnbay TLmes to be the following :-The abolition of the Suttee; the recision of the Hindoo law, as to the property of persons embracing another faith; the permitted re-marriage of Hindoo windows; the encouragementoffemale education; and as affecting both Mussulmans and Hindoos our late occupation of Onde. It is strange that such measurescould be somisrepresented as to excite furious hatred against those from whom they had emanated. Yet it is only upon minds in some such way prepared for revolt that " the greased cartridge" could have worked with such disastrous force. It is to be remembered that opinions prevalent in England now tell nuickly on our countrymen in India, and when we hear, as have done, the wish expressed that every officer in India wieregifted with a "forty-Spurgeon power of preaching," we cannot wonder at some of them omitting to resign their m.ilnitalry commissions before undortakingibhodtofms sionaries. of erg e ~duty of mis- The difficulty of understanding tho people of India can appear slight to none but the Ignorant, and it is therefore "a to And a sensible man treating a knowledge and a charitable toleration of their peculiarities as a disqualification for command among them. There maybe wrongheaded enthusiasts among the Bengal officers, and most licely there are some among the officers of Herajesty's army, but it is hardly fair to impute tho failigs of the inereior intellects in either class to one or ether of the able men whose names stand at the head of Colonel Sterling's letter. I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant. T. C. R. zL&on-square, July lb.

On that occason the motion stood over, that the defendants' witnesses might be cross-examined before a special examiner appointed for that purpose (a course agreed upon by all parties), and the matter was then ad. verted to In Whe Times. MIr. BAsrMY this morning said that he begged it to be understood that, unless the motion was brought on upoen Tuesday next, the defendants would ask for the costs of an abandoned motion. fr.

(Before zC-nceaUor Sir J. STUART.) CA3PBELL V. CAMPBEBI. Thi was a suit by the wliow of the late Mr. Campbell who was an armny and navy agent, praying for a settlement as against the aspignees in bankruptcy of her husband. In 1803 M&r. Campbell, prior to and in contemplation of his marrlage with the plaintiff, undertook, by a memorandum in writing, to settle 2,0001. on her, and also " any plate he might be possessed of," and in 1818, by a deed which purported tobe made in pusnuance of the memorandum of 1803, he settled certain leasehold property and two poEcies of assurance on his wife and children. In 1838 he became bankrupt, but sabsequently to his bankruptcy, and prlor to his amn tion, he met with a serious accident, w oh pre. ventedhis passing his exanination and conseqentlyhisob taining his certiicate. Certain property, therefore, which Mr. Campbell became entitled to after his bankruptcy, on the death of some of his children as their next of kin, passed to. his assignees, Prior to his bankrnptky the officers of the JunmorTunlted Service Club had presented an eperen to himn, whic-h wras nowr valued at 500/., and this was in his possession at the period of his bankruptcy. Before the plain. tpi} onng was concinded, HevAHCELLoR aai he euht It was proper case for a compromise, and ultimat,y a ar rngement was come to, the assignees taking the two policies of assurance and half of the value of the epergne in discharge of the claims of the creditors under the bankrtoy. Mr. Craig and Mr. De Gex were for theplintiff; Mr Mams and 3Mr. R. W. B. Forster for defendants in th same Interest with the plaintiff; and Mr. Bacon and Mr. Karslake for the assignees in bankrmpty of Mr. CampbelL (Btfore Yie-Ckancdor Sir W. P. WOOD.) DUGDA V. ROBERTSON. The objectof thls suit was to restrain the defendants. from digging or working any mines orminerals underneath a mansion-ho tse called Brymbo-hall, in thecounty of Den. bigh, so as to interfere with or injure the said mansion. house, offices, demesnes, and pleasure grounds. The defendants were lessees under an indenture, bearing date the 29th of September, 1842, of the Brymbo Ironworks, with. right of worlkng tie mines and minerals underneath the Brymbo estate, and carrying on the necessary operations, "except in or upon any demense, Lands, and pleasure grounds belonging to or occupied with the mansion called Brymbo-hall," with certain provisions as to sinkg the pits and works at the furthest point from the mansion-house upon certain parts of the estate. The bill alleged that by the further excavation of the mines in the direction nowtaken the mansion-house woulld be deprived of adequate support, and would be in danger of being destroyed or greatly injured, and that it had already given way to a con. siderable extent. Mr. Rolt 3ir. W. M. James, and Mr. TAttle appeared for th plaintins Mr. WieDlock, lIr. Kenyon, MTr. Cairns, and Mr. ddis appeared for the several defendants. The arguments turned mainly upon the construction of the providons contained in the lease of September, 1842. lhe VicB-CHa"cEroR said that the lessors, after grant. ing the mines and minerals, had retained the enjoyment of the mansion-house, and clearly had had no intention of allowing It to be destroyed by the excavations aud undergrotmd workings, although by thus retaining the house they adnot in anywaydented from their grant. It was platin upon the evi denc that the workings had damaged the, stability of the house, and it must be declared that the de. fendants were not entitled under their lease to execute any works upon certain specified portions of the demised estate, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to a sufficient support.. for the upholding of the mansion-house, and an injunction accordingly, withi certan inquiries, and liberty for the plaintiffs to bring such action as tbheymight be advised in respect of any past workings of the mine. His Honour made a decree to the above e ect, with certain consequential directions as to costs, &c HOLMES V. THE EASTERN COU ES RAILW.AY COMPANY.. The object of this suit is to obtain specific performance of certain agreements by which tho Eastern Counties Railaay Conpany had granted to the pltinbffs the exclusive right of exhi iting advertisements and selling books and papers at the various stations upon tho line, and to restrain the removal of the bookstall at the Bishopsgate-street station.

I PREROGATMVE COTJRT .Tm.v in fLAC1nn V_ VAUflT^V (Beforc Sir J. DoCON ) The testator in this cuse, Mr. Tohn Edward Elack-bun, &. retired clerk In the Foreiga.office, was born In London on the 15th of August, 1817, and be died on the 27th of Mfay, 1855, at No. 24, uEn de Bern, Paris, possessed of an English freehold estate of the annutal value of 785f1*, and personal property to the amount of 8,0001. or 9,000Z. In 1851 he retired on account of ill-health from the Foreign-office, and went to live in Paris, with occasonal visits to Axla-Chapelle and other foreig waLtering.places. In 1844 Lo had privately parried, in%Egland, a Frnnch lMy, named RousseUe ; but 2n 1854, havingdoubts as to the vahidity of that marriage, be repeated the ceremony in a more formal mnanner in France. Previous to that the parties executed a contract, which he signed as "..Bwr Bakun 13., South Audley-street) Londres." He had also signed a lease in the same manner. He left a wLl in the English form, in which he bequeathed to his wife naearly the whole of his personal estate. Sir J. D0soD5O;, after going carefully through the facts; of theaem, came to the conclusion that the deceased had abandoned his English domnicil and had acquired a new one in Paris. It was true that a short time before hIds death behdepesdasrlaiv revrfjndi, but, in order to re-establish an original domicil, there must be the factuon as well as the antmus. The Court mnust therefore hdldthough it did so not without some 'doubt-that this entle- ma at the time of his death had a French and not an 1nglish domiciL, The argument as to the effect of this decision was postponed.

The troops under canvass -at Cove-common, which sin9e our last notice of the-camp itve been reinforced by the B t,pop of Horse Artillery, ider Captain 8ohnstone, and the 4th IIeiunnt of Light Dragoons, were all under armns, and 'draWn up in contiguous columns. The Ist battalion of ColdstreamnGards, the 22d, 54th, and 66ch Re nsints of Infantry, the lst, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 16th Regiments of -Cavalry, a troop4of Horse Artilery, and one field batters compmsd the force herg. As the Royal Vorkye approached, tho whole line presented arms. Colours were lowered, and th.e bands played' the' national anthem, while the fiold -battery overlooking the heights of the South Camp fired the Royal salute. The. camp at Cove-common has now quite settled down into itS captonments; everything about the ground is scrupulously c-ean and neat, though with an ordinary work-daj aspect, which shows it to be the result of a thorough and eftfctive organization. The men like the change. The offioers have g.t into the way of it. There is an unusually small proPortion of grun blers, and so the. whole thing works well. After passing this camp the cnrt6ye drove at once to the Pavilion, vhence, after a short delay, Her Majesty drove round and through the principal avenues of the North and South Camps, passing slowly through and inspecting each, Several of the senior officera in camp hatd the honour of receiving invitations to the Royal dinner party at the Pavilion in the evening. After thg dinner the programnue of the evolutions to be gone through to-day was submitted to Her Majesty, who expressed her wish that the manu^evres should commence at 10 o'clock. The troops will therefore form in their respective positions on the ground at 9 a.m. To-day's manceavres Wil, wo believe, be a continuation of those which took l,ce at the last Royal visit. On that occasion th: evolations represented the sudden attack of a superior force cefore the advance of which the camp troops were compelled to retreat. To-day the enemy will be atticked in their po8ition on Iystook Bidge from two points. A strong brigade under Lord VV. Paulett will advance from Eelnoro Farm,nand, crossing the Basingstoke canal inpontoons, effect a iunction with the main body of the army under General Koollys. The enemyb advanced position will then be carried by the infantry, and the retreat ef the imagisary foe across the plain will allow scope for some beautiful evolutions with the cavalry and Horse Artillery. We know that non-military spectators on these occasions would consider it a great boon if the enemy's force was represenjted by a handful of skirmishers, as was always the case at Chobham. Civilians aro then enabled to appreciate the whole plan of attack and defence, which, whin the foe is purely Inlgn1Vary, cannot bO aone evenL by military men ,vho aro Unawareof the intended plan. We believe that sevcral me:bers of the late Royal family of France will honour the review with their presenoo to-day. Should the weather permit there is likely to be a most brilliant field-day on Saturday also, before the departure of Her Majesty for Ozborne. The Indian mutinies are bringing about great changes in the camp. Already the 20th, 54th, and 97th Regiments are 9der orders for India, with the Sd battallon of the Rifi Brigadeand the 7th llussars. The whole of thia force wMll be en- route to their destination before the end of the present month. Oa Tuesday last Captain Johnstone's troop of Horse Artillery, froma Christchurchi, with the 4th Light Dragoons, arrived in. camp, and on Wed4esday afternoon, at half-past 4, a telegraphic mess3go waa received directing Colonel D'Aguilar to proceed instantly with his troop of Horse Artilery to Woolwbic, for enibarcation for India So promaptly was this order executed that within 12 hours after the message was received the whole troop was o fior Londorl. The loth and 11th Hussars are fexoeted to arive in camp noxt week. On. diG also that either the Life Guards or the Blues are to take their turn at Aldershott scon. It seems surprisimg that these gallant regiments have no' been there before, as they require the discipline of camp, we should think, as much as other cavalry regiments in the service. Probably, however, it has been felt necessary to give prority to the cavalry which are maitained to do rel duty. In a few days General Scarlett gives up the command of the Camp Cavalry Brigade, and will be succeeded by Major. General Lawianeso; General Scarlett proceeds; to take the command of the garrison at Portsmouth, in the place of General Breton, who removes to the Mauritius,

'Yon will, I am sure, bo thadkful to hear that my der Ihusband, child, and self have been most mercifully delivered from the fearful massacre dt Delhli, nd all the dangers and privations to which we have beeA exposed. We can hardly ourselves believo-hoK we escaped, The way in which poor helpless men, women, and 'children were slaughtered without a moment's warning is most dreadftl. We were sgtrprised on the morning eff he 11th of Miy (baby's birthday) by &aparty of mutineers*romn Meerut. One of our regiments (the 54th Native Infantry), with half of the Wative Artil. lery, was immediately sent to guard the approaches to thecity; but the mutimnece succeeded in crossing the river (the city being open on that side) and in cutting the bridge of boats,: and when -onco in, the city they spared nothing that came in their way, and the sepoys of our regiments very soon joined them and tarned against and kdlled their own officers. "The Brigade-Major (Captian NicollI) sent his carriage to ne and told me to go to his house at onoe., I had no time to take anything, but awoke baby from her sleep, and we were driven about from place to place in the hot sun for sarme hours. AIL the ladies were kept behind a guard of guns with the remaining companies of regiments that had not been sent to the city gates. We were for several houra in a guardroom, and the gentlemen outside were in readi. ness to defend, while many of us were assisting to load the guns and do what else we could. There were many ladies who had not seen nor heard of their husbands all day. I was obliged to do my best to keep up their strength and spirits, for having dearest L1 [her husband] near me I was able to do more than others, although every moment we expected to he murdered. About 6 o'clock in the evening the order was given to retreat. (This appears by the account in your paper of the 14th inst., exm tracted from the Delhi Gazeite of June 1, to have been necessitated by the open ravolt of the 38th Native Infantry, which had been posted around the flag staff tower, in whigh this band of fugitives were taking refuge.] We got into Captain Nicols carriage, and put in as many others as we could, and drove one pair of horses for 50 miles, expecting every minute to be pursued and kied, and we were told a regiment had left Umballsh and was cutting up whatever came in its way, so that uniless we turned off the road we could not escape. [They were evidently on their way to Umrbalah, vid Kurnaul.] This induced some to g6 off to Meerat, but we did not know what to do, as there was danger there. However, the report proved false, and wo arrived safe at Kurnaul the next morning. Here we were told we must leave at once; but I felt so exbausted and iU that I could not stir further, so that half our party went on and he rest remained till eVening. We left lKurnaul at about 9 o'clock, as we.could not get horses sooner, and it was with. tJie greatest difficulty weinanaged to get on at a1l, LI 6eing obliged to threaten to shpot any one who refused to give us assistanco. When we arrived at ThwanessAr(a dawk station on the Umballah road) we halted for a coupie of hourri aleep, and to get a change of conveyances. We stopped with the Asslstant-Commissioner; but before we had rested two hoars oe w atack being told that a regimenj of sepoys was come to attaÃ¯Â¿Â½k us. We had to djl Jromn the, house and hide as best we could, under the bhshes, &c., in the garden; and I kept deai baby in my own arms tho whole time until mgrning, Vhen Europeans were seen, an,dthe cause of alarm proved to be a regimeur of .kie la iCavalry marching to UmbaUshb We corild get no, conveyances to go on wirh until the afternoonswhen we left forUmbaliab at about 6 o'clock ia a cart drawn bv, coolies. ,Our. party consisted of about 10, audwe met with greit difficulty on the road, for the natives were so unwillmg to assist us. We arrived at Umballah on the morning of the 14th, at about 8 o'clock, quite fatigued and worn oat, for dear baby bad never left me sinca we left Delhi. Colonel G- had oemoved Into a small houso, and said they had not! a corner to give us; but, after wandering about for some time, he told us to go to his house and get some breakfast, when Mrs. G- managed to clear outa room for us, where we stopped two days. After this they got us a small house, and fitted it up with what they could get; so we have been here ever since. We wished to go to the hiUls at once, but were one day told it was unsafe, and the next that we might 'go. However, we leave this to-morrow evening (the 20th) for Russowlee, where there is a guard of Europeans, and where, we hear, all the ladies from Simlah and elsewhere have collected. There are four European regiments here with the Comp-ander-in-Chief, but everything seems yery gonfuged agmd uncertain, and orders seem to be given and countermanded directly. We received a, telegraphic message from BR(reslding at Lahore), saying they were all safe. I hope you Will be able to read this, for I have been obliged to write at Intervals whie baby was asleep. No one has beon able to save any of their property at Delhi; every.one was obliged to fly with nothing but.the clothes they had on their backs. It is to be hoped the Commander-in-Chief will not delay sending a force to retake Delhi. I must draw this to a close, as baby is getting up, &c. " P.S. We have been most mercifully dealt with, and cannot suEfciently appreciate the blessings vouchsafed to us. I feel I calnot be thankful enough. Many have left Delhi, not knowing what has become of their relations. Some have heard og their husbands since, but others are still in a state of suspense. The amount of bloodshed was enormous-not a soul wearing an Earopean garb who lived in the city was saved. Mr. and miss Jennings (the chaplain and his daughter, who was engaged to be married shortly) were killed, and also Mlr. Hubbard (the Church Missionary.) Altogether about 100 were massacred, and I do not think more than 40 or 50 were saved, but tho exact number fs not known. We very much want energettic men here, things go on so slowly. Thenews of the Delhi affair has been known for 10 days, and though there are four strongEaropean regiments here they have tent none to Delhi, whioh of course ought to have been done at once. A forse is, however, to march towards Delhi to. morrow morning. All the public buildings were burnt before we left, and all the private hoatses have been plundered."

DVIiB.O^UKE OF CAMRThT I Yesterday a -Court was held at which, after the transae. tion of some btsiness of no interest except to the members ,of the corporation themselves 1Ir.ANisnzstTo moved thefollowing resolution- 'That the freedomof thILcitybepreented tohisRoya Ibghness the Duko of Camlaidge, -the comua of our beloved Qsen, and the ,Commander. iu%1pef of Her Majestys foroer, a a testimony of the attaebanent te,the Queen andRoyal Family of tbe cithiens of London, represented by is smrt ;a a grateful recognitfon of the support his Royal ghness has given to the various pubc charitIes ot the metro. polls; of the indaunted va!our dplajied bY him in the late wa' Inthe COimea` abd of thejudgment, energ, and success with which beha3condu&edtbemflMtaryafWof the emptre dstee he has socepted the high and rcesponeible oficoe of Oammander-tnc4ef of the Britieh Army." There was another resolttIon of which notice had been given in the taper of business, viz.:- " That the freedom be presented with a aword or some other WesU. moulalof the value of 200 guneeash There was aseparate discussion upon each of theresoln. tions. Mr. Deputy LOTT said, he felt sincere pleasure in secondIng the motion. Mr. BuicNcs, said, there could be no doubt that the Duke of Cambridge had acquitted himself with undaunted bzavery in the war, and shared the fatigues and hardsipe of his soldiers with untiring perseverance-but for those services he had been recompensed with the itinguishod office of Commander-ln-Chief, and It was impossible to add at the present time to so dignified. a reward by preeenting his Royal Highnesswf ththefreedomof the city. Besides, the wDake hl,been onlyafew months in that office. Re consi6dsete 1tto'be his duty to propose, as an amendment, that the question be not put." After a long discussion the questionwasput as to the firt resolution, and it was carried amid acclamations, only three hands having been held up for the amendment. Mr. . ANDERTOw then moved that the freedom be presented to the Duke, together with a cup of the value of 100 guineas. 'He had given notice of a resolution to present to his Royal Highness the freedom with a, sword of the value; of 200 guineas, but it was understood in the cotirt',tbat he: had, abandoned the intention to ;move for the presentation of the sword in order to comp;omasq the prejudices of a few members of whose opposition lie 'entextained same fear. In asking the Court to agree to this new proposition, he said that the posteity of the DW1re *ould be sure to have frequent opportunities of seeing the cup wrhen the Sword would be hidden from their C r. HAiiTTRDGE then pro posed, as an amendment, that the words " Sword of the value of 200 guineas be substituted for the words " Cup worth 100 guIneas." Mr. Ross most warmly seconded the amendment, whiolh he had reason to think would be much more eligible in Mr. Anderton'x opinion thin the originda motion. The amendment was then unanimously adopted, and imade an original motion, and the Lord Mayor was requested toprovide a sword, and fix a day after the recess for presenting it to lia }Royae Trghbess.

H9RS3T was appointed totake thechair.'In apening the business of the 'day he said that the occasion OR which they had met was one that had-not lost its interest to them, although it had lost all its novelty. Theywere'met to con.- sider what course it would be proper to adopt in order to give- fulU Offect to the prinoiple of religi6iis liberty. They wore not there to express any sympathy with Baron Rothschild, although it was weU known that they did feel a warm sympathy towards him as a victim of religious persuasion, and which as Christians they could not fail but to deplore and regret. They *ere not unet to py a tribute, however well due, to the electors of the city of London, who had set an example of constancy and moderation in an adherence to a great principle which was deserving of the ntmO&t gratitude andrespect. They were 'inett ere to-day to testify their own adherence to the principle of religious liberty. The contest between the people of London and the House Of' Lords had been so protracted, the arguments had been so exhausted, the manifest injus. tice resulting from the operation of the oaths now required to be taken was so clear,that avery large partyof influential Christians believed that the time had come when an at. tempt might be made to stand by Baron Rothschildby paSwing a resolution of the House of Commons. Mr. Diwyn hai given notice of a motion to that effect. He justifiedhis pro,aosition to some extent by the prcoedent set by the House of reers,whoby a mere resolution excluded Lord Wensleydale from taling a seat in the House of Lords forlife. It wascontended that the House of Commons might by a resolution-eidew ho might take a seat intheirHouse,theparty having been duly elected. He did not eay whether thatopinion was right or wrong, but it was- sufficient that a larpe section of the House of Commons were preparedtocontestit. On the other handnoticehad beengivenby LordJohn Russell to ask for leave to bringin a BilUto alterand amend the Act of the Ist and 2d of Victoria, cap. 78,so as to enable each Hounse to regulate the oath for the admizsion of its own -members. There was nodoubt that if such a measurecould be carried it would be the most easy and convenient mode of Bettng the question. It would unite all parties who were interested in the establishment of the new syttem. It was a course which he had no reason to doubb'would be readily adopted by the Government with all its weight and influence. With respect to the late division in the House of Lords there was a certain amount not only of disappointment, but of dissatisfaction. That division cansed great disappointment, which was to a certain extent aggravated by the fact that all the names of the Cabinet did not appear in the divison. It was a subiect much talked about, and opinions Of gentlemen had been taken, and it had- been suggested that the Government themselves, and particularly the noble lord at the head of the .Government, was not eirnest and sinoere in the support of this meaure. That they knew to be altogether unfeundAL They knew that no man could be more earnest or sincere than Lord Palmerston to carry the meaure.. He did( not believe that any man among the, Liberal party doubted it. (Hear, hear.) But It couldnot be disguoSed that there was not an entire union among the members of the Cabinet-a disadvantage which could -not but be deplored. If the Liberal party had any principleit was that of religious freedom, on which their noblest victories had been fought. Qnestions of zeform, of coonomy, and expediency might be postponed. but on a question involving reigion they were bound to show, as a party ' that they had fully and 'finally established the princip1e that all proscription on account of religious belief was nothing but persecution. (Cheers.) He hoped, therefore. it would go forth that they were stil United with one znind and one heart, and that they would' eautioesly, but courageously give the motion for Jewish.emancipationafnllandfLnaleffect. (Cheera.) Mr. CnAWFOnRV said that having been for some years a very ardent supporter of Baron Rothschild, and being asso. -clated with him as a member for the city and shing in his r poltical confidenco, he certainly felt himself to be a fair ex,ponent of the city on the present occasion. He thought the time had arrived when this long vexed question should he 1finally settled. He therefore moved That Mr. Dlllwn be requeste to postpone the maoen of which be ham given notoo In rel&tsn to Ea,=n Roth,hiUd nntil the MMn whloh Lod Jobn Rusell is to ak leave to jutroduce on Frid, neXt shll have been disposed of." Mr. W. EvANs considered it most important that the Liberal party should be nnited on this question, aud, although he thought the House of Commons was competent to determine what oath a member of its own body ought to take, yet for the sake of unanimity he was willing to forego his own opinion as to the moodus operand; tobe adopted. Sir J. G B.-I rise in the frst place with tho per. mlssion Of the meeting, to state that I appear here to.day without any previous conversatioa with anypersonwhatever. I received this day an invitation to attend thLs meeting as One of the Liberal party with reference to the great question now pending, and I rejoice at meeting so many gentlemen on that subject to-day. (Cheers.) May I be permitted to state one fact with respect to myself ? I have been in Parliament for 38 years and I cannot chargemyself, looldng back at the past, with ever having failed to maintain the prlnciple of liberalism in respect tothe establishment of the national church. YoU, Sir, enunciated from the liberal party that the bond of union was the great principle of perfect civil equality without the least distnction of religious creed. On that prindple, acting with Lord John Russell, was fortunat enough to see carried the repealof the Test and Corporation Acts. I' also saw the great measure of Catholic emancipation carried. Having seen these questions triumphant, I have no doubt that mybrethrenof the Jewish persuasion would feel it an equal triumph if this last vestige were disposed of, aud that men, irrespective of religion or treed, should meet together on term of perfect equalityas. indeed, they now do with one exception, for which I conaider them to he as well qualified as any person whatevernamely, tho right of sitting and votinginthe Honsoe of Commons-aye, and also Inthe House of Lords, if it should pleae Her Majestytoconfertho peorage on any Jew. I sn also of inion that the time is arrived in conformity with the firstesolntion, which has passed unanimonsly, that the IAberal party is bound, under the present circumstanoes, not to sit down quiescent under the negative vwhich has been imposed upon the Bill sent ua by a large tmajority from the HEouse of Commons to the ounse of Peers. I ave ceom here without any foregone conclusion. I came here to deliberAte and act tho part of a sincere friend by speaking the truth as, under the present circoumstances,. It appears to me. I have not communicated with Lord John RusselL I know nothing of his intentions and I know nothing of the mQtion of which notice has been given by Mr. Dillwyn. But I came here frankly to shte my op2ion as to the best way of giving the utmost effect to our views and to oonslderw at is the course which in the shorest e tes most liMely to leadto suocess I must first observo that I think, notwithstanding the vote of the Honse of Lords, that we occupy ats this moment the vantage ground. I don't think a Bil givin. perfect emanlity to the Jlews has ever yet been sent up to the Hlouse of Lords with so commanding a majority as the Bill wehich as recently rejected by the Lords. I think, also, wve have another great advantage. I do_not remember any Prime MKinister in his Ie m hrailiament, xbjecbt t h eposblt of hi h office, ever having so strongly nd frAnkly expressed an opiion condemunatory of the oaths as they now exist ag he *ho said he thought they were almost blasphemous, that he never took them without an inward blush, and that they were revolting to all his feelings and opinions. A Prime Minister who has thus unequivocay expressed his opinion in favour of the Liberal party must be considered to have given a most unequivocal pledge that everything which a PfrieMininter can do to give effect to the measure which we support in common with him will be done. (Cheers.) I have not analyzed the division of the Rouse of Lords, but from something which fell from you, Sir, I presume that the Ministry did not with united strengthaupport the BilL I don't know who the defaulters were, if any defaulters there were, but I think it a matter much to be regretted, and if another opportunity is to be afforded to correct that error I hope it wil not be thrown away. (Cheers.) This brings me to the practical course of prooeeding. I have invariably voted in four Parliaments for the measure, vaing in shape, but having the same identicdl object in view-namely, the removal of the Jewish disabilities. Those altera. tions have been made with tho hope of reconciing the House of Lords to the measore, but in every instance the proposition has been vedt with an unbending refusal. I think there were circumstances in the last division of the House of Lords which were encouragin. Even on the episcopal bench sapport Was given to the Bill by seven prelates, more especialy by the metropolitan of London,-a' TFon entitled to the greatest confidence. Then also it must be observed that in the House of Commons not only the leaer of the Tory party gives his support to the measure, but Sir J. Paign for the first time aeknowlenged a change in his opinion and declared that he was wihing. and more than willing, to give an active sau- rtto tho measure which had been- sanctioned dy th Co o and seont up to the Lords.

I think the measure he KAs indicated is an. esxtremely goad one. (Hear, hear.)

I, think such a meeting as thisa. will how the Government that the House of Commons is - ndt disposed tamely to submit to havlng their deliberatejudgment wholy negatived and set aside, and I hope that. through the press information will reach their lordships ofthe Upper House of what are the sentiments prevailing in the louse of Commonson this subject. (Cheers.) Ido not believe that in the history of this country, since the revolu- - tion and since voluntary government has been established, that there has occurred an instance where the House of Lords durlng four successive Parliaments have offered an uncomPromising resistano to a Bill which has been sent up - for one and the same object 'successively by le majoritiesof the House of Commons. If the House of Lords should adhere to their former decision in this instnce they wlll doit for the first time with great danger to their legisativa. independence. I think that must be distinctly understood, and that that warning will not be thrown away upon t - lordIsbips. (Cheers.) aweyipo Mr. DMIr.WYN2 expressed his readiness to be bound by the decision of the meeting asto whether he should proceed4with. the motion of which he had given notice; but it was his.. opinionthat the courseproposed to bepursuedbyLordJohn Rusell was very dangerous and unoonstitational in many points of view, while that which he-proposed -was neither unconstitutional nor unsanctioned by precedent. Mr. Ronnucx -aid, the question before the meetingwas one of practicability. They were all agreed as to the ond to be attained. They were all friends of- relous llbertY ; but what ' they had~ -to consider *an-- what was the best course to- be taken to ac . complish their object. He would ask the right hon. baronet whether the stop he advocated would not laeu them in a wors position ? Assmn ahength object of Lord Xohn Russell's Bill to be that the House- of Commons - should have the power to regulate the oaths to be taken by its members, and that a Bill to that effect was carried up to the House of Lards; would it not bo a confession tlat they were at present wantingin that power? 'Re vaz anxious that they should not tako any step that would militate against, or diminish in any degree, the privileges of the Home of Commonis, which wrere, in fact, the great. foundation of allthe libertiesgof thisecountry -He thoughtthe*coursoadvocatedby the ightho Lrondtwas a very dangerousone, and he would rather adopt the reeolution of bis hoe fren (M. illwyn). Nobody could entertain a higherrdeparted statemsmn to whom the rightl on. barnethadalldedthan himself; but ther was one thing which he could not concede to him, and that was'politica foresight. Throughout his careetr he opposed great ques, tions up to a certan point; and if the right hon. baronet were livingat theg present day he should have expected to findhimon hs sde f the question. (Hear, hear.).. e was not one of those who would plae the privileges of the House of Commons under the feet of the House of Lords. The Lords had said in the case of Lord Wengley- - de that they were ithejudges of their own privileges, but they had said to th House- of Commons that they - were not the judges of their privileges. Now, he re. grded the two Houses as cowordinate. The Comnmons had vindicated their privileges for ages, and should they now, very nearly at the 12th hour, desetb their consti. tuents and themselves aud deliver up their cause to the-- - behest of the House of Lords?2 No ; and he warned hLon. meimbers of the danger of the couse they had chalkedout to themselves. ~ Sir J. GRAxUAs depreatea any tendency to allow the discussion to degenerate into a party debate. He entirely - agreed with his hon. and learned friend- that no legisla-- tmOn vith respect to this matter ought to be le.- ratedl for a mnoment which cejmpromnised directly or indirectly 'the privileges of the House of Commons; and he admitted most dtintly that thecorirt n bytheHouse, of Lords with referenoe to the creatlon of peers for life did fortify the Home of Commons in amerting the right in thelast resort of determiniDg what oath should be taken to qualify a person to talke his seat in that House.
