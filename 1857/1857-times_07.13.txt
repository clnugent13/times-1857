IfONIBY-MABRKBT and CITY IZATBLLWENB. Saturday Evening. Some telegraphic intelligence from India by the present mail was received in the city this afternoon, but not before the closing of the Stock-Exchange. Its effect upon prices, therefore, could not be ascertained, but throughout the morning the market had been greatly depressed by sales supposed to liave been on acount of parties who have *aiready been suspected in previous eases of enjoying au inexplicable priority in such matters. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 921 to i, were first quoted at that price, but a decline soon coam ra-nced, and was increased by the failure of an operator who had some ratberlargespeculativepur chases open, and the final transactions were at 92k to i for money, and 92a to i for the 6th of August. An arrival of nearly a quarter of a million of gold from Australia and a reduction in the interest on French Treasury Bonds failed to exercise any influence in restoring the tone of business. For the 6th of August the last price was 924 to i, and after regular hours there was a ftirther disposition to press sales. It was then currently stated that telegraphic de spatches had been received by the Admiralty tid Sardinia, announcing that the number of troops in open revolt, which was estimated at 8,COO in the previous accounts, had increased to between 20,000 and 30,000, that Delhi had not yet been retaken, and that General Anson, the Comnmander-in-Chief, had died of cholera when within three days' march of that city. Great anxiety and alarm was consequently excited, but subsequent statements to the effect that Delhi was surrounded, that the insurgents had been driven in with great loss after every sortie, that 27 guns had been captured from them, and that the advices from Madras, which reach to the 10th of June, make no mention of any disaffection in that Presidency, where at the last dates there had been considerable apprehension, tended to restore confidence. Indeed, although the intelligence was looked upon . ia il i66 highest degree important, it was understood to be viewed byone or more members of the India direction as calculated to relieve rather than increase the apprehensions that might previously have existed. Bank Stock eft off at 212i to 214; Reduced and New Thre3 per Cents., 921 to i; India Stock, 215 to 217; India Bonds, 1Os. to 4s. discount; and Exchequerbills, 3s. discount to par. In the Stock-Exchange to-day money was obtainable at 5 per cent. The discount-market was also well supplied. In foreign securities the few transactions that took place were in most cases at a decline. Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 96; Equador New Consolidated, 131; Granada, New Active, 22 ; ditto, Deferred, 6; Spanish, 40Q; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 95o, i; Venezuela Four-and-a-Quarter per Cents., 340 ; anid the One-and-a-Ralf per Cents., 13. The closing quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening show no alteration in tbe price for money, but a recovery of about a quarter per cent. in that for the account. The advices from Paris state that the Government have notified a reduction of a half per cent. in the interest on Treasury Bonds. No alteration had been made since January, 1856, when an advance of 1 per cent. was adopted. At that time the Rentes were nearly 4 per cent lower than at present. About 43,0001. of gold was sold to the Bank today, of which 25,0001. is underatood to be American and the remainder Russian. The Frances EIenty and Roxburgh Castle have arrived from Melbourne, the former with 24,732 ounces of gold and the latter with 30,626 ounces, naking an aggregate value of 221,4321. Both had been some time overdue. A general meeting of deputies from the joint-stock banks of England, Wales, and Ireland has been cauled for Tuesday next to consider the Joint-Stock Companies Banking Bill just introduced by theViceI'resident of the Board of Trade. This Bill requires, under heavy penalties, that every bankina company shall register under the Joint-Stock Companies Acts 1856-57, on or before the 1st of January next, With regard to the formation of new banks, it provides that any seven or more persons subscribing a capital in shares of not less than 1001. each may register themselves as a company other than a limited company. The proceedings of railway companies during the week have been as follows :-At a meeting of the London, Brighton, and South Coast three Bills for small extensions and deviations were approved; also the Bill for authorizing traffic arrangements, with power of amalgamation or purchase, with the West-end of London and Crystal Palace Railway. Power is likewise given in this Billto redeem onehalf of the toll (8,0001.) paid by the former to the latter company for the sum of 80,0001. The shareholders of the South-Eastern have approved the same Bill with the exception of the amalgamation and purchase clauses; a resolution having been passed at a very large meeting of that company in February, 1856, condemning clauses in the Bills of other companies to enable the South-Eastern to raise money. It -was stated that the West-end and Crystal Palace line will be opened to Ranelagh-bridge before the close of the year. The Birkenhead, Lancashire, and Cheshire have approved a Bill authorizing the purchase of steamboats and for other purposes. At the meeting of the Newry, Warrenpoint, and Rostrevor, an extension Bill of the Newry and Enniskillen was approved, also a Bill to enter into arrangements 'with that company An agreement has been made by the Manchesterx Sheffield, and Lincolnshire with the Great Northern, the former agreement with the London and North-Western being terminated. A Bill to permit the North-Western Railway Company to abandon a portion of their railway, and for other purposes, has been unanimously approved by the shareholders. At a special meeting of the Great Northern the Bill for making provision for the capital fraudulently created by Redpath (now at its third reading in the House of Lords) was approved by a majority of votes. In the course of the proceedings it transpired that at the meeting in March last the directors had suppressed a communication received from the Chairman of the Committees of the House of Lords attributing the frauds to gross neglect on their part, and expressing an opinion that the loss should be made to fall on the directors by a suspension of dividends on the stock held by them as a qualification. A Bill for a junction line between tho Reading, Guildford, and eigate and the Great Western has been approved by the latter company and by the Staines, Wokingham, and Windsor. The Devizes branch of the Great Western has been opened for traffic. The Bill for constructing a relief branch to Dartford tid Eltham has been approved by the shareholders of the South-Eastern. Various small extension and junction Bills have been approved at meetings of the Oswestry and Newtown, Newport, Abergavenny, and Hereford, and East Kent companies,-in the latter case the addition proposed being from Herne Bay to Faversham. The report of the Australian Agricultural Company has been issued, preparatory to their meeting on Friday next. It states that M xr. Hodgson, the new superintendent at Sydney, has made a reduction of 5001. per annum in the expenses at that place, and of 1,0001. per annum at the. Newcastle Colliery. The quantity of coal raised during the first three months of 1857 has been at the rate of 82,432 tons per annum, against 67,303 tons in 1856, at the cost of about 7s. 9d. per ton., instead of 1Os.; and, with the assistance of the locomotive lately arrived, a further rapid increase of supply is expected at a still lower rate of expenditure. Sales of live stok have been effected for 5,1151., and, as the company have now a cash balance of 15,0001., with sufficient amounts in the colony for all current expenses, a dividend of 10s. per share is recommended. The governor, Mr. Ravenshaw, has announced his intention to retire. The East Tndia and C hina Association have issued their usual statement of the shipping trade with all the plaes within the limits of the East India Company's Charter, for the first half of 1857. The entries inward have been 575 vessels of an aggregate capacitv of 379,150 tons, against 703 vessels and 462,877 tons in the corresponding period of 1850, Ehowing a decrease of 128 vessels and 83,727 tons. The principal falling off has been in the arrivals ron. Calcutta, C>hina, Mauritius, the Philippines and the Cape, The clearances outward have been 725 vessels of 5314604 tons against 619 vessels of 431,431 tons, showing an increase of 106 vessels and 100,173 tons, ehiefly to Australia, India, Ceylon, and Arabia. Liverpool, the Clyde, and Bristol have benrefited by this increase in a greater proportion thu co611Ion. The following infogmation regarding the mining business of the week is extracted from the Mfining Jour.c _ "We havo vety little Change to notice in the market or new to report upon in regard to mines this week.

SHE INDIAN MUTINIES. (From the Observer.) The news from Inda is certainly seriouw; but it wMil pro. lably not tumrn ut to be so aarming as it looks The tele. graphic despatches are necessarly meagre and unsatisfac. tory. The fall accounts inwritingwMn not be recsivedfor adayor two longer. We may hope that they will bemore full, and satisfactory, and rea-mring than the rumours which precede them; we fear, hovrever, that there is no reaaon to doubt that some 30,000 Sepoy soldiers have deserted their d-ties inthe Presidency of BengaL They have gone off hoFwever, like so m3nyhare3 into a wood, without leaders, or concert, or arms, or warlike stores. Sill, the disafection must bo regarded as wide spread, and it is pos. sible thatmanyof the deserters may reach ourmilitarystatioas and disseminate thepansictslfurther. The Goveraor- Gene. ral and the authorities a6 Calcatta feel leas alarm, and write In confident terms as to the resulh. We cannot doubt that the fmutineers will be severely punished, and the deserters dealt with in a manner becoming the sternness of military disclpline. In the meantime there is happily no intellj gence of any spirit of diaffection having exhibited itself among the native population throughout Indi, The desertions and the crimes committed upon the defenceless part of the Euopean eadents are confined to the soldier. of the Bengal Presidency alone, IoW far the contagion may spread it is impo33ible to say. But we repeat that the authorities on the spot, and those at home who have bad personal experieceo of India, and who havo fUed public offices in India, have no fesrs for the general safety of al'our possesslons there. Still, we may look for an unsettled StatO of affairs for some time, and wv must be prepated to put down the present revolt with Strong hand, and to provide against anyrecurrence of simiil&r, scenes in future, by not trusting quite so much as we ba ' done to largo masses of native troops, who 2save ebLibited o *uwn kLmuly as they have dono upon this and (on a smaller scale) upont former o,edons. Let us hope, also, that as this seems to be the most extensivo case of disaffection, so it may prove to be the most conclu. sive anddecisive of consequences to the fature security and good government of India. It probably required some sach general and serious outbreak to awaken the attention at home to the vast intrests at stake, and to the very anomaloas charactrof the Government of India. The mutineers who had sought refuge in Dclhi, and who had committed such atrocities in that city, with 'he aid of the worst part of the native population, having ventured outside the walls, and been joined by other deserters, have been defeated, after some partial sucoesses, and have been comoelled to seek shelter within the walls, where it is hoped they will soon receive the signa punishment they so- chlmydeserve. Thedeathot GeneralAnson,theCommander-in.Cidf, from cholera, at any time a subject of regret, isalossall the more to be deplored at a moment like this, when he is struck down inthe midst of his preparations and anxieties to arrivo at the scone of action, and to Inflict exemplary punishment upon the offenders. He died at Kurnaul, on his road from UmbaUlah to take the command of the troops before the capital of DelhL He is iusly lamented as a most accom. plished gentleman and true soldier. The people as well as the army, in GreatBritain,as wellasin India,will be glad to hear that he is succeeded in his high command by Sir Colin Campbell, who has had the highest experience in Indian warfar, as well as throughout the Crimean campaign. Si Colin Campbell leavee London for Marseilles this morning cn routc for India. The telegraphic despatches received by the Government yesterday were despatched by the Port-Adumiral of Mita On the aivalof the Indian mail at that island. The Admiral Superintendant, perceiving the lmportance of the intelligence, sent a special steamer frorh Malta to Cagliari, in Saw. dini, where there is an electric telegraph to London. The CabinetCouncil, whichhad been sammonedfor3 o'clock, was asemlnbled more than an hour earlier. SirColin Campbe"2 with the trne spirit of a gallant soldier, at once consentedj go out, without 24 hours' notice. He said he would no wait to take anything out with him; he could get all h3 wanted at Calcutta as well as in London. The steamer for India, about to start, was stopped yesterday by telegraph, and will await Sir Coiin Campbells arrival at Marseilles, with any further instructions necessaryto be sent out ia th3 emergency. The 14,000 troops under orders for India ar3 gone or goiug immediately; other reinforcements of Euro. pean troops will be sent as soon as ships and stores can be got ready.
How miss Smnn LEFT TaE CotnT.-The circuinstances of the it-sc adopted by one of the Glasgov agents employed in the case for getting off Miss Smith unmolested hy the vast crowvd waiting inthe Parliament. square and leighboulrhood1 for her exit after her trial were, re areotold, as follovs :-He had provided himself with the drecs won on the prevous days of her trial by Miss Smitb. and on her liberation from the bar he asked the sergeant o: polic in attendance -whether he could find him a girl abiutn the size of 3iss Smith to porsonato her and gothrough th, ordeal of driving in a cab to the gaol downi tho High-street The sergeant immediately recollected a girl who h#a for several days importuned the police officers to get her a sight of the prisoner, saying she would give anything for tho privilege. This girl was got, a bWeing told that not only would sho get a sight of Sit Smith, bat also her dress, and a douceur besides if she would representherin a cab inorderto diserso the mol from the square, she undertook the job, anu was dressed iby Mss Smith herself) accordingly. In the meantime e rumour was circulated through the crowd that Idiss Sinitb was to drive to tho gaol to change her dress before gomn at large, and orders were given to clear a spaceo about thi court-room doors. This being done, and the anxiety of thL crowd raised to the utmost pitch by the perpetrators, ul came the cab, and out camo the fabricated grl in nearly fainting state, and, being with some little diiliculty got into the carriage aloDg with the nsual police, off dron. the vehicle at a breakneck pace, followed by the whole rabblo of expectants, and in a trice the Parliament-squass and all the thoroughfares about it were oompletel3 cleared. 31is Smith then having been taken round througi tho Advocates Library, and put on a different dross, with I coloured veil, quietly walked away, accompanied by het brother and suother young gontleman, to the front of St Gies's Church, where a cab was in waiting, and, entein, it uetly, Jehu drove away to Slateford, where she met tht Caledonian train to Glasgow, and was carried by it to thw city. She proceeded, we believe, straight on to Rowaleyn her father's residence, near Helensburgh. On dit that o the day of the Lord Advoctel's address she Wa asked wha sh thouht of it?

STATE OF TRAD1, MAiCHESTER, JULY 11. We have had but a quiet maiket this morning, buyers for India and China being in a great measure restrained by a desire to see the news dne by the overland mail before en- tering upon further operations. There is, of couise, no imI prosement to report iu ptices under such circumstances and the higher rates continually obtainable for cotton are leaving the producer further and further behind the rates that would remunerate him every day. Spinners, vho havea faix demand for Germany and the Mediterranean, as well as the home trade, have made a slight advance in price, but are still unable to overtake the price of the raw material so as to obtain a profitable trade, while mnanufacturers are in a istill worse position. The nearer approach of the period vihen the new American CrOp of cotton will come into the marlket wAil probabiy lead to fuctuations which will tenupt speculation; but at present the business doing is marked by the utmost caution, and liiited to inmedite wvants. BIRBIUNIGAM, JUlY 11. The narterly meetings of the ironsuasters of the district vhich Vaave been held duming the week terminated this evening. The general result is stated to be highly satis5aco tory. The prcceediags at Wolverhampton and BirmiDg. hana 'were fully confirmed, although it was intimated by somne persons--such are the fattering prospects, more espe. cially of the foreign trade-that a nominal advance will b made before the conclasion of the quarter just entered upon. Large orders have within there twvo last days been given out for theUnited States and the continent of India,and so SDon as the Russian tariff comes into operation a great augments. tion of the demand for that country is anticipated. Although the appearances of the great staple trade of the district are Battering, the gezezal n,a2ufactures of Birnirgbam are flat. Some branches are well employed, but the country trade is dull, and is likely to continue so uutil winter orders Sairly set in. This is rmde upob the authority cf several of the leading factoring establishments of the town, Nbose business lies with the ironmoneers and retail shopkeepers of the kingdom. For manufactiired goods the Amexican demand is also comparatively slack. The head of one of the oldeEt and laTgest firms in the town connected vith the American trade states that the demand for articles of Bilminghamproduction in the Jvited Stes isconsalderably less than usual at this season of the year ; and this be ccnsiders the more remarkable as the Americans are obtaining better prices and larger profits upon such goods tban for some time past. T here has been little or no alteration in the brass-foundry business during the; week. The cabinet brass continues to be tolerably active, but the recent reductions in the price of copper have as yet had but little influence generally upon the manufacture of brass and copper goods. It Is expected, however, now the price of metal is more settled than it has been for the last year or two, and midsummer is upon the turn, business will be more active during the ensuilg quarber. The principal and most pleasing feature exhibited during the meetings of the week has been the prompt manner iu wbich the quarterly accounts have been settled. These pericdical assemblages of the various manufactures and trades of the district usually test the credit of those engaged in tbem, and it is satisfactory to find that in this respect reports are highly favourable. N'o defalcations have teen samounced, and engagements have been ful9iled with a promptitude that speaks well for the monetary condition of this town and neighbourhood. NOTTINGHAM, JuILy 11. The lace trade is quiet. Some purchases have been made this week for the home market. Plain nets are stil inquired for, and for narrow edgings there is a good demand. In silks there is not much doing, mnaterial still keeping at a very high price, with no apparent probability of edauction; cotton also continues high. The hosiery trade is exceedingly dull; nearly all branches are fiat, cheap goods mnanufactured by rotary sharing in the depression. The o-peratives have not now full employment. Silks and yarns remain at a very high figure, and this may in some measure contribute to the dulness of trade. LEEDS, JuLY 11. The position and prospects of the 'wooUen cloth trade have not assumed any important alteration since our last Seport. I'here has been a steady business transacted in the warelouses for the home market during the week. The &hipping houses are still moderately well employed, and the general aspect of the trade continues tolerably satisfactorv. these was a fair attendance of merchants at the cloth-hafl this morning, and a ful average amount of goods was cleared out, consisting principally of heavy cloths and other ,winter materials. There has been more doing in wool, and psices show an upward tendency. HALIFAX, JULY II. There has been rather rmore activity in the worsted trade this week, and the prices of yarn are a little better. All kinds of wool are very firm, and the sales have been more numerous at improved rates. LEICESTER, JULY 11. There is a little more activity in the hosiery trade, and operatives are rather better employed, orders having been placed both from London and Manchester. Manufactutrers, however, complain, and not without reason, of the small. neEsof profits, no advance in proportion to tho high rates of material being obtained. Wools are selling at very high prices, farmers' lots ranging from 40s. to 42s. per tod. Worsted spinners are seeking for a rise. At Huntingdon wool fair 4,380 tods were pitched, being 1.035 less than last year. The prices ranged from 37s. to 4DF., 42s. being considered the average. BRADFORD, JuLY 11. The staple trade of this district manifests a continuance of the imhrevernent which took place at tho termination of last month. There is an active inquiry for worsted piece goods, and sales are made with considerable animation, while the mai,srex, -i4 ol,L5 nerativo prices than those previously current, wlhich have, however, been steadily on the increase. A satisfactory business may therefore be generally reported, both as to the number and extent of the transactions. In the warehouses a good business has been done, thero having been a labrge attoudance of buyers during the week. Our merchants are sanguine of a prosperous trade; the prevalent splendid 'weather must have a highly beneficial effect upon our harvest prospects; and, as it is understood that a larger breadth than ut ual is this year under cultivation, itis probable that a more than ordinary bulk of cereal produce wiU be rendered available for home consumptton, while the apprehended unfavourable advices from India will not affect the worsted stuff trade as the cotton manufacture. The yarn departnent experiences an improved inquiry, and a steady trade is doing in worsted yarns both for the home branch and in the expozt houses. Prices, too, have gradually improved since our last report, and it is anticipated that a further enhancenient in rates wil have to bo submitted to, in order to enable the spinners to meet tho increased cost of production. Cotton warps, consequent on the improved figures obtained in the markets for the raw material, partake in the upward tendency,with a tolerably satisfactory business passing. In the wool-market, considering the very firm tone exhibited by the staplers, there is in the aggregate a satisfactory smount of business doing. Prices obtained by the farmers at recent sales in the wool-growing districts are as much as ljd. per lb. bigherthan at the commencement of toe clip, and, to keep pace with this enhanmement, our local staplers are compelled in all tranasations in combing descriptions to firmly demand a higher ran,ge of prices, to which, although relucta.ntly, spinners are generally compelled to accede for t,he best assortments Clothing wools steadily maintain their value, and, being short in supply, are purchased with considerable brisknees.

Od. Tbe returns bave been made up for the year ending June .'0, 1S.G, and June 30, 1857, respectively. Business still continues dull, though trade is healthy, and commnercial credit is well supported. It is to be hoped that the prevailingi favourable accouits frmni all quarters of the cheeringpromise of the harvest will shortly impart some activity to comlmercial operations; and that "*little or nothing doing" will soon cease to he the stereotyped reply of cemmercial men to inquiries as to the state of business. BELPAST, JULY 10. LINMx.-At Arnmagh, on Thursday, the supply was not large, and prices advancing. Lurgain was sparingly supplied, | and prices of all descriptions were firm. In Ballymena, on Saturday, there was a slow, but firm masket. LuNEN 1YAnn.--As yet there is no improvement in the demand for yarns, but prices rermain unaltered. FLAx.-The supply of flax during the past week in the different mnarket towns was muth the samne as the previous ono, with the exception of Aughnacloy, which had 15 tons in it, muostly all handscutched, which was briskly bought up at full rates. CoTTo1;.-The quietude noted here some time ago as cxist;ng in the several branches of this trade continues to influence the markets at Belfast, Glasgow, and Manchester.

TEE POISONING AT B10NC:KONG.-OR Saturday -were published by order of the House of Lords copies c papers connected with the conficement of Chinese prisoners at Hiongkong, and with the trial of a certain baktr and others on tho charge of poisonilng. Mr. Labouchere wrote to Sir J. Bowring on the 15th of AMay last a " confidential" letter, stating that reports had reached tho Home Govern- nent that great bardship and suffering were inilicted on -prisoners apprehended m tie recent poisoning cases, no official intilhigence of which had been received, and request. ing to bo fnrDished with a report on the subject. New cr1. mminal proceedings will be instituted against Allurn and his onfederates if sufficient evidence can be got up to warrant aueh a step. JUIJTICie IN INDIA.-On Friday were published, by apecial order of the House of Lords, a copy of the minute of April, 1856, of bIr. liafliday, Governor of Bengal, upon tbe stato and administration of criminal justice in that Presidency; also, the copy of a despatch of the 24th of September, 1856, from the Conit of Directors to the Go. -vemnor-General of India on tbe same subject; and copies of the correspondence between the East India Corapany's Directors and the Governor-General of India respecting the intrcduction into the Legislative Council of the Bills for the improvement of the law in India, now under consideration,
IBELAND. DUBLIN, SATURDAY MOM MG. THE TIPPERARY BARX APPEAL. The result of the appeal to the House of Lords, although not iinexpected, has, of course, been accepted as a heavy blow to the interests of the creditors; and regrets are now freely expressed that all parties did not agree to the terms of the compromise offered at the close of the last year, by which it is alleged assets would have been fortlicoming sufficient for the payment of at least lOs. in the pound, and perhaps eventually more. Meancwhile there is no doubt that the enormous expenses which have beer already incurred in the suit in -which the official manager haa been involved will seriously diminish the amount which would otherwise have gone to tbe creditors and depositors of the great Irish swindle cf 1856. TM 'ArluDER Or ',%M. rTEra. Tbe Attorney-General has arrived in Dublin, and, although he may have other pressing demands on his time and attention, it is most devoutly to be hoped that, as the officer chiefly responsible for the conduct of the prosecution of the person charged with the murder of Mr. Little, he will see the urgent necessity of taking the matter into his own hands, for so far the management of the case, frora the month of November, 1856, down to Thursday laMt has given no very exalted idea of the capacity of some, at least, of the officials concerned for the Crown. With a fair share of justice one of the morning papers remarks "We blamed the authorities for the manner in 'which the inquiries were conducted after the murder. It appears now that our blame was just. Whether the aceused is guilty or not,-and no man should assume his guilt till it I bag been declared by a jury,-it is evident now that no other man connected vwith the railway had such good opportunities of committing the crime without fear of discovery. Yet he does not appear to have been the object of suspicion to the detectives, who never adverted to bis tempting facilities. Accordir,g to the evidence now given, the searches were conducted in a careless manner. No comr etent person was appointed to superintend the draining of the canal, no proper precautions were taken to prevent the possibility of fraud, or the destruction of a link in the chain of evidence. The people wvere permitted to crowvd the place. The worlkmen amused themsel',es searching the mud for fbh and catching eels. Again, the police were several times within a short distance of the spots where the money was concealed, but wer never able to find it. In no in. stance did they give the least proofs of sagacity. The in. vestigatlons wiere conducted in private; had they been publio itis probable they would long since have got a clue to the discovery of the crimninal." At ll o'clock to-day there was an iavestigation held in Dublin Castle, at which the AttorneyGeneral, the Law Adviser, the Crown Solicitor, and other legal functionaries were prevent. The proceedings were strictly private, but it is understood they had relation to the ulterior steps to be adopted in the prosecution of Spollen. The adjourned inquiry at the police-office wil take place at 11 o'clock on Monday. THE rA-o OlT1AGEs. The following is a copy of the informations sworn before a Mayo magistrate by Jobn Gannon, one of the victims of the brutal outrage reported to the House of Commons on Thursday evening. The unfortunate man is said to be lying in the County Infirmary in a very precarious state - " County of Mayo, to Wit.-The information of John Gannon, of Dongera, in the parish bf Breaffy, and counby of Mayo, who saith on his oath that on the 6th of July, 1857, I returned home from London, after having boen examined there before a committee of the House of Commons, and on the day afterwards, the 7th of July, I went into the town of Castlebar, where I was groaned by several persons as I went along the streets, and at the cross, near Pat Cogan's corner, a great crowd of about lOOpersons, urged on byJames Gildea, James Walsh, James Casey, a woman named Hearins and Winny Carney, surrounded and comTnenced Ainging stones at me, without my haviog given them or any person the slightest provocation. I went into the shop of Iat Cogan for protection, as I was always in the habit of calling there, and asked him to let me wait there until I could send for the police. He at once took hold of ne and shoved me outin the face of the mob, who were in a very infuriated state. Themob thereupon commenced'dinging stones at me, and I was struck with stones by a boy named Mchael Carney and another named John Waldron, and also by Winny Carney, wife of John Carnoy. I put rmy back tear Cogan's wind ow, and I was pushed therefrom by a boy, whose uame I am at present unable to asoertain, but whom I could recogni2e if I saw him. I then, as soon as I could, rmade my way into the house of Pat Gavin, blacksmith, where the mob followed and fdung several stones in after me. I went upstairs in Gavin's house. Several of the mob got in below and flung stones up at me, among whom was Miobael Carney, and as I was stooping, talking to Pat Gavin, some person from below pushed up a long bar of iron through a hole in the ce4liug and stabbed me in tho eye, which caused it to bleed much. I neverhad any quarrel or difference whatever with any of the above parties, and gaveno provocation to any of them for the treatment I re. ;,and.c. was- aiwayan;f0owed mne throug the whole town, and 'was al ways -esml ru- _ uh wo ' Shaun an Soggarth,' and that the grass should nob grow where I would walk. He was partly the cause of collecting tbernob about me. They (the mob frequently cried out why I went to prosecute ray priest. Pat Gildes shook hands eith me, and asked me why I mentioied his name. I replied T said nothing rrong aboat him. He said ' You would, Iou ruffian." PElRVERSION. The De?-r-y Sentinel ananounces that the Rev. Moore O'Connor, rector of Culdaff, has written a letter to the Lord Bishop of Derry, to the effect that he has become a convert to Romanism, and therefore resigns the living to the patron, the Marquis of Donegal. In taking this step the rev. pervert refers to "the purifying wave of the Catholic Church having passed over him." But, as the Derry paper remarks,- "'The timo chosen by Mr. O'Connor to desert the Protestant faith is rather inopportune. The biehop had concluded his proofs in the suit instituted by his Lordship to degrade him of his ataot as a clergymn of the Church of England and deprive him of his benefice, to which, by the judgment given in the Court of Queen's Bench, he had no le ai claim. The case was almost ripe for hearing- but, instead of meeting the gravest accusations against his char. acter, he has abandoned the Ecclesiastical Court, and taken refuge in the Church of Rome. This is the last strange phaEe in a career as checkered and eventful as many that have already secured their respective biographers." Rome has but little reason to rejoice at the adhesion of her new recruit. An Armuagh paper, noticing the secession, says that the suit will be continued until Mfr. O'Connor is legally degraded.

FoiEIGN LECaIONzS Al CoRpS.-A return moved for by Sir De Lacy Evans, ALP.. shows that during the late war thore were enlisted in the British service 441 German, 136 Swiss, and 160 Italian officers; 539 German, 165 Swiss, and 195 Italian non-commissioned officers - and 8,702 Geroman, 2,995 Swiss, and 3,226 Italian rant and file. The cxpen es incurred were-for the German corps, 687,8001.; for tbe Swiss, 235,4861.; and for the Italian Legion, 195,6551. Four of the German regiments (4,250 strong) were sent to the seat of war; the other stations were the depots at He]igoland and Shornoliffe, Haslar, Alderahott, Colchester, Hythe, Terlaigham, and Browndown. A Swiss Brigade of 2,200 was sent to the seat of war. Of the Italian Legion no men were sent to the Feat of war. The German Legion was finally disbanded in Novemberlast, the SwissinOctober last, and the Italian in December last. Some particulars are given relative to the German Legion to be employed at the Cape of Good Hope. The expense of arming and equip. ping this force on proceeding to the Cape was 18,3051., and that of clothing 6,3751. The pay for three years will cost 81,9821., and the rations for one year 21,4931. The annual expense will be borne by the colonists. the numbers of each rank located at the Cape include 1 Major-General, 1 Brigadier-General, 2 Lieutenant-Colonels, 5 Majors, 22 Captains, 12 Lieutenants, 3 Paymasters, 3 Eurgeons, 6 Sub-Surgeons, 2 Dispensers, 2 Chaplains, 44 Cadets, 11 Sergeant-Majors,lBugle-.ajor, 22 Colour-Sergeants, 87 common Sergeants, 114 Corporals, and 2,024 common or private soldiers.

NA. GZADSTOA2B OAT CLASSICL EDUOATIOW. On Thursday took place 'the annual examination o(the PuPils, of Trinity 041iege, Glenalmond, Pertlhshire, an institution connected withi the Scottish Episcopal Church. There Was a large conspany present fronm different parts of Scotland and fromn Erialatud. It incluxded the e'ight lion. W. E. Gladstonie, MIP., Sir W. and Lady Gibson Craig, Sir P. AL. a,sd the Misses Threipland, the Hon. Bouverie, Mlrs. and Misses Primrose, Lady and Miss Osw'ald, the Right Revm. C. H. Ternot, Bishop of Edinburgh; the Right Rev. C. Wordsworth, Bishop of SI.

The variouos classes were examinired by the Rev. ProffessorKellaud, from Edinburgh, and the Rev. D. P.

After the exausination the company met at luncheon in the large ditilng The ixxic(Re. ii-.Hanah)proosed "tho founders Bucleuh (ho as nabe t leve ondn),and Mr. GladiMr. GnADSTorNc eplied in alengthenedsafech. He drab CXTiergeatebsn fhnbeaewho,he said, vas dtie by no lack of zeal or love for this institntion; orheaId am &ld to tiinlrthat the mni who may without invidious distinction ha called the prince of all English and of all Scottish nobility its likewise the mnan who is awake to every dluty Connecteda withi that high situationx-who is ready to support every purpose of true philanthrtopy or of social wisdom; who has always given tue greatest encouragement to and aided in the promotion of tho design which wve aee realized in Trixnityv College. (Great cheerling.) The right hon. gentleman proceeded to say:-Thesceneslhavewitniessed here to-day have wellrepaid mnylabourin comaing here. Everything I have tzeen I amn bound to say has given me unqualified satisfaction, and has convinced me that the pious and energetic labour-s which, folio wing in the footsteps of your distinguished predecessor, -youx here bestow, will, b-y the blessing of God, be productive of a rich harvest for the pupils and for- ScotlIand both in this and in succeedling generations. (Applaxise.) It may be presumptutous in men to speak to you on the subject of education (applause), but this is a habit which seine way or other is always contracted in Parliament. Parliament contains a distinguished body of srreak-ers on education. (A laugh.') What amount of public gratitude we deserve for our speeches on that and other siubjects it is not for use to determine, nor do I rate it very high. (A laugh). But, having conitracted that habit, I will venture to say a few words to you and your distinguished coadjutors on the subject of education), as it appears to me from the outside of your sphere of labours Now, it is a remarkable fact that England possesses a distinctiou in Erp and among mnankind out of all proportion to the .ume= astrength of the population. Now, ff itistraeof Great Britain that she exercisesa a imaterial and moral power far beyoind that to which the is at first sight entitled, it is still more true of Scotland. There is no population on the face of the earth, at least in moy knowledge, which has produceed in pro. portionx to its numbers so large a companiy of emintent men, so vast an amounit of moral energy, suich at masculine tone of thought, so that the name of a Scotchman is proverbial for prudeince, sagacity, and self-reliance-of almost every quality on which man's success in life depends. No doubt -we find the source of these results in the character of the people, and also ink the inistitutions of the country; but if I there it one weak place ini these institutions, it is in con. nexion with that departmaent of knowvledge which is the object of your energetic and valuable labours-that particular departmenat of high mind cultuire which is derived from the fountains of Greece and Rome, to which, in a great degree, is due the civilization of Europe, and which possesses apower almostgreaterthanLanyctherincontributing to make man great. If the want of this has been percptible in Scotland, I am glad to think that the supply of that defect in the outset has been the masin and specifi object of the foundaition of Trinity College. Not that I would spa as if the cultivation of the mental powers were the inspiring idea. It is Trinity College in w~hich we stand, and it is the glory of God that is the end of this fouxndation, (Applause.) It is onChristianity that this colege has beenx founded-on Christianity, not as vaguely conceived by the thinkcers, as they call themselves, of the 19th century, but as it is embodied in the words and the institutions of the church. It is needless for me to dwell on that subject, be- cas,as its imnportance transcends all others, so hiere, beyond4 All others, it is understood and taken for- grantbed, for it is understood that a 'knowledge of the principles of the episcopal communion of Scotland shall form part of the pyofessionial training given to the boys here; and it is well known that the education of the pupilss at large is mot only connected with, but thoroughly pervadel by, the spirt of religion. But I speak of that which is external to, and sub. ordinate to, religion, although in harmiony with it-the subject of classical culture, which- is now truly given oni the mountains of Scotland. And -if you rejoice at the farmers climbing the hills anzd cultivating the soil) in order to Ppro duce food for men, you must eaually rejoice to see following a similar path the teachers In thiis institution, and that they are liely to produce for the mind anid intellectual powers of mnit that food which is not less necessary for the mind than the substance of grain is for the bed-. I confess that I for one have the very stronges9t opinion of the advautages of this institution, and of the value of that descriptioni of cutlture wlhich is given here. For- 25 years I have mingled amid the cares and storms of life--for 25 years I have seenx the demands made oa ment-and that chiefly among those who may be called- and I do not call them suo iidiously-. the utilitarians, the practical ipeople ; and the result of that experiencea is that, instead of despising more thant formerly the ancient plabsa of education, and heinoready to substitute tne more novel, the new-fangleca ideas upon the subject, I have every year more intensely wished anid mere earnestly prayed that the higher 1o-0i1 14-- this country may be maintained on the old founidations. (Applause.)i v,, Ori..b &u.~.. u.-L-r much doing in the way of improvemient, muach in thse way of addition. In the distribution of prizes which we have seen to-day there have been prizes for mathematics and for modern languages; and the interest whichx these pursuits appears to excitea amply demonstrates that thes things are not forgotten in Trinity College. Butt I trust that the claim which has been advanced and powerflly urged in favour of these pursuits will net he for one minuite Ilstened to if the intention urged be that of causing them to disp1lace the old studies which have beenL the foundation of Bzitish educationo. And, I imust Bay, when we consider tho numerous masses-I am bound to use the word, although it is a very homely one-the numerous masses of nonsense thiat are talked and -written on this subject with regardI to the greater utility of one kind of study than another, I am often driven to thinkc how frequently mankind are wiser in their instincots than in their reason; or, if yout take the tone of the press or of the higher classes, youx would think that the ancient sy~ste 22 of eduzcation -was to be given up-that they had fairly abandoned it. But this is only theory. When the question comnes to be discussed by these persons "siprns as to the p lace -where they shall send their' sons, Eton, and Harrow, and Winchester, and those other schools the classical education at which has contributed so much to the glory of England, are the places selected by them. If that is an inconsistency on the part of these parents, it is a most happy inconsistency ; and one can the better-tolerate the crude notions that are fincirculation on thisgsubject, Einasmuch as that they atop at words anddo not show themnselvesin action. When. ever the affections of the parents are engaged, although they may give the assent of their lips to the popular doctrines onL this subject, it is at once seen that these are not established iin their hearts ; and, whatever maay be the tendencies of the 19th century, the schoola where they were themselves taug-ht are those to which they tend their children. (Hear,) I am not disposed to aive in to the adversary one inich inth matter of disputation in this questioni. I hold that their views are not mnerely rash and hold, bult that the movement altogether is in the wrong direction, anid that they are takino a very narrow view of the exigencies of human nature, and that i-n finding fault with the experience of mankind they are not substitultinig anythinig better, but merely niotions manufactuired in the brain which will not stand wind or- weather. (Applause.) We are told that the French language is mnuch more useful than Latin and Greek, and that the time spentinx acquiriing a knowvledge of Latin anid G-reek should be given to French. I answer this by saying it ia musoh more useful to make coats or waistcoats than to learn Greek or Latin, or French either (a laugh); and it is therefore not neces. sary to teach French and Greekc, but the time should be employed in making coats and waistcoats; and I believe the man who will admwit the first argument will also adlmit the second. (A.pplause.) There is an impatience in men's minds of any 3resulbt tat is dlistant-a losing hold of the great principles on which society is based for the shallow views of men who look for immediate results; and not seeing the eff'ects at oncee of these things-of Iatin and of Greek-they are dissatisfied. Yesterday, in comning downa Irs the railway, by its side I saw the electric telegraph, Now, it might have been said by an observer " What is the use of that'.0' He sees the uase of the railway, hut hie sees nothing of the uses of the electric teilegraph, and he might suppose that thb0 poles and the wires were erected there for some idle purpose-if not for ornamenat, at least not for use. But yet througlh these wires is passing the mind of the world -the most wonde-rful communicatiorns ever known. Is not that the case 'with anAcient classical literature? Are its results not seent in the character of the men producedalin ths country ? If it is found that the minds of men under that mnode of education are better fitted far all the active duties of life than in other countries where itis disregarded thien, is this not a demionstration to satisfy anyv reasonablAj -an tht alt oug th eut a oesol be at tbe'moment invis~ibe, they mlut persevere with th;4r labours; and that although the fruits are slow, they will come, and that they wnll gain what is desired-to enable their cbildren to discharge all the varied duties of life. (Applause.) Tihat is the practical issue which we must be content to abide ; and all that T ask is that we be not tried by the test of immaediate utility. If only the objector will be content to take the results of exl,erience-and it is aOoni prebensive sebool-then it would be the tribunal to which I would be willing to carry it; for I am convinced that the same amount of practical utility cannot be obtained by the substitution of any other system of education. (Applause.) I confess that, turning your attention to another point oif view, I am by to measusatisfied of the value of a superficial classical education. Whfether it is one of those goods frona which meults are obtained in exact proportion to the amoutm taklen, I have great doubts. I have a strong impression that in order to obtain its benefits there must be a thorough class1cal education. There must not be any mere mastery of hooks, but rather a thorough assimilation of the intellectual habits-we must not give up the o"lfashioned exercises of comumitting to memory what we have learned to conIstrue, but go on that our minds may harmonise with the languages. For my own part I feel the deep impoctanee of the thorough study of Latin and Greekand I aTa gla6d to see that in this college this principle is acted upon. I am willing to make additions asid extensions to that study, but not to imply the loss of what is indeed a delightful as well as1 useful study, or the substitution of anything direetly opposite, however subtle or however m bthe arguments tged. I frankly dmit tha I ejiceatthe study of the ancient classics, because I believe that it no small degree is due to them that love of liberty which lathe characteristic of Englishmen, andwhlcl aIs never associated with those wild theories of government which hLav marked the 19th century, and which, I think, show the necessity of such teachers. For, after '*), liberty must not be mistaken for license; and it often bappens that in countries with democratic constitutions the freedom of the body and of the mind is worst understood. If we cross the AUlantic to that wonderful republic Amerca we shal find that their constitution is far more democratic than ousr, but that there is far less true liberty. And I Wll motshrink from expressing the opinion that, althongh this 'eotntry has been the happy. home of -well regulated liberty frorn a very early period, 3et that the love of that liberty ana tbo comprehensain of that liberty have been in no small degree fostered and fortified in us by thb great masters of antiquity and the lessons which they bave afforded us. (Applause.) Withrespeotto the cultivation of taste, whent classical literature is condemned there will be sach a descent in the taste of this country as wvill never be recovered from. In regard to another and miore important effect, the comnmand of language, which is a branch of human knowledge of which in Parliamentary life every man feels the value, there is no school of English ecnscation to be compared vith the study of Greek and Roman authors; because the rendering of them into the English tongeo is a far more stringent e-xercise for the mind, from the accuracy of ancient thought and the method with which that thought is arranged, than the study of ioglish writers. The copiousness of language, the exactitude of thought, and the accuracy and clearness of diction of the ancient writers are likewise of much value to their students. It is not difficult In this world to find attractive study. TaLe railway reading. (Rear, hear.) Go to any station and review the sbilling volumes; you will find a number, some on one subject and some on another, but all of them may be termed attractive. On the other band, it is not diffacult to name severe study. I see opposite me a gentleman most distinguished in severe study-Mr. Chase. But the difficulty is in obtaining that which combines the two qualities, and I know not where I could name the studies which combine these two qualities in a degree at all comparable to the writers of Greece and Rome. They are not only attractive, but also fit to prepare the man for the severe and practical duties of life. (Applause.) This is what we have to do with-the practicsl1 duties of life; and we see the way in which men who have been educated in this manner, when they are brought into contact with the world, meet every form of demand on human Towers. (Applause.) I do niot hesitate to say that the old I :tudies are the best studies; and that if yoa want to find The man-I am not speaking of individual cases, but as a general rule-if you, want to find the man who has the greatest aptitude, the greatest facility in acquiring what is new, the most thorough mind for tie acauisition of new forms of thought and new pursuits, and the greatest facility in the description of them to another-for the solution of this practical problem and enigma in public life give me the man who has had a thorough classical training, who has drunk the wnitiDgs of the old masters into his bones and his marrow, who has stood in the race of competition with schoolboys and with collegians, and who has proved his powers under the course of study there placed before him. (Cheers.) Mr. Gladstone then said that they should be prepared to show he spirit and the prindples on which education is founded. We ought not to shrink from discussion. I do not think it necessary that we should envelop ourselves in the mist of antiquity, or that we shonld make a mnere pretext of antiquity, and refuse to open our eyes from the fear of obanges. Let ns take theright end of the question, and then fearlessly plunge into discussion if necessary, and stand on expernence and authority. If we were to find that nearly the whole of Chriatian Europe, since the revival of letters, had been making a lamentable mistake as to the best mode of human culture it would be most melancholy. Those men I who so freely condemn preceding generations-wvhat amount of claim can they have to respect when they are numbered with their fathers s While they have so freely condemaed those who have gone before they cannot expect for themselveS anything hut that of wshich they have set such a bad e.xample. It is common to quote that wonderful saying of ,ord Bacon, and every saying of his is wonderful, he looked like the inspired moaster of infallible wisdom- "Amnt a aeCUl, jnUVntU3 mundL" And people Inote that sentiment, implying that they are there y entit ed to overthrow all that human erperience has hitherto established. No doubt Lord Bacon was erfectly right. It was the youth of the world, and modern times ought to be wiser, but how wiser? By employlng aU the wisdom that former times accumulated, by assuming possession of that. That is the starting point to any further progress. But if instead of that we throw overboard all that men m former times acquired we are again in a new youth -a freah statt and a fresh accumulation of knowledge. And if such a mode is adopted, I do not see that we shall pursue the Eearch umder more favourable circumstances or with a more happy result than the generation whohave gone before us. One other purpose-and a more noble purpose of classical literature-1 cannot help alluding to. Te Eive in times when there is a very heavy strain on religion-when the understanding of man, I will rot say because it is more vigorous, but because it is more restless and sceptical than before, is more than over disposed, I will not say professedly, but is disposed to question how far all our civilization and al our eternal blessings are due to Christianity, or to an indefinite something different from Chrisatiaty, or different from Christianity as understood in former times. They let slip the great gift of revelation, and say we can get on very well without it LNow, to those who are under the pressure of that temptation-and I must confess my belief that it is most formidable, seeing that we live at a time when it is nearly universal-is it possible that any experience can be more salutary to us than that presented to us in the histories of the Greek and Roman people? These histories say to us ont the one hand and on the other, in various tones, but taking them in combinaion they undoubtedly a, that with the oweaoth nd eeoed in a qdegree hcweav have some reason to a^sk whether wve can expect t se ever to be equaled-we see the human faculties carried to a point rarely if everto be attained-we see the sooial orgazzartmn nu3 icO wenoderful than the qualities of the individual man, but the Divine light was gone, and that gone, to what did they all come? It was a course of progressive moral decline. (Hear, hear.) As ages went on, and as the works of genius accumulated, and as the highest point of possible accomplishment in art was attained, the heart of man became more and more corrupt, and the basest vices were everywhere installed side by side with those wvon. derful accomplishments of human intelleet and genius. I would ask, is It possible to see vices more awfnllv and clearly developed than when we turn back to the histories of Greece and Rome? And when we see that all their lofty intellectual attainments could not teach the secret of human happiness and could not stop the folly of the hu2man heart -when we see that man became more and more the victim of his own vices until he became a cruabling mass of pollution-do we not learn a lesson of deep practical imort? We learn that it is not only in the edncation of the Intel lectual faculties, but, above all, in the precious treasures of the Gospel, that we are to look for those Inflnences which are to 'do us safely through life. Having given utterance to the hope that we should never be driven from the ancient education of this country, Mr. Gladstone shortly adverted to the toast of "the parents," which he had been requested to give, and said his hopo was that Trinity CoUego might be long blessed, as it was at present, with the superintendence of teachers in whose Christian characters and whose intellectual attainments they bad alike the same confidence. (Applause.) The Hon. Mr. PRDIRosx replied, and gave thetoast, "the council of the institution," to which the Bishop of EnsD'unSae responded. The next toast was "the Examiners," which was acknowledged by Mr. CESrEg " The health of the Warden" was then given, and the teast of "the ladies" concluded the proceedings of the day. _
S2'. JAMES',S THEATRE. Although the " Bouffes Parisiens" vWll perform to-night (Monday) and to-i6orow, their season virtually terminated Jast week, or, more strictly spealdng, on Fiday, whon Mr. Mitchel took his benefit, and Madame Ugalde, by her brilliant execution of a scena and aria from La Catd, added to the attractions of the evening, which was honoured by the assemblage of a fashionable and aristocratic audience. When Mr. Mitchell, who is always active in devising new sonrces of amusement for the Londot pubic, engaged the ' Bouffes Parisiens," the experiment thathe made was ofno ordinary kind. It the case o foreign dramatic performances theusual practice is to secure one or two artists of decided celebrity, and to Sll up the ranks with a miscellaneous collecof persons obscure to the play-going world and unacquainted with each other. People go to see the one favouiLte, and if he or she answers expectations, the achievements of the rest are regarded with all the toleration of indifference. In the case of the " Bouftes Parisiens," on the other hand, a 'whole company, with its murical director and its own orchestra, was brought over from Paris, and the English public has had an opportunity of witnessing exactly the same combination of talent that has delighted the inhabitants of the French metropolis ever since the establishment of the " Bouffes," in the Champs Ely. ees in the summer of 1855. Since the engagement some years ago of the entire troop of the Palais Royal a Fronch company so complete in aUl its parts has not been seen in l,ondon. The chief difficulty of the " Bouffes Parisiens" with re-ard to the English public lies In their repertory. The little pieces in which they display their talent are not only, dramatically speaking, far slighter than the slightest produiction at the Palais Royal or the Varietes, but their humour is of a purely local kind, and they presuppoie a familiarity witlh tho slang of P4ris. Hence, while mnany a laugh has been raised by the inimitable drol. lery of X Pradeau, by the "'fun" of a costume or a situation, aUsion after allusion, pun after pun must have fallen flat upon British ears, though these probably were the condiments on which the author mainly relied when he served up the product of his brain for the delectation of his countrymen. Themnsic of the pieces, though composed after the model of operatic forms, and though cleverly suited to the purposes of dramatic effect, is not of akind that appeals strongly to English sympathies. The two works that have held the most permanent posi tin in the bills have been Zes Doe=n Avcugles, a duo, drama, intended to be a picture of the most earthy reality, and Zes Penfins dc Violdt-, a graceful sport of fancy, ini which some of tho conventional figures of old Italian comedy are employed in the developement of an ingenious fable. These two piecos are altogether au! geners, and thoy have kept their place, while works of a more ordinary class have come andgone in rapid succession, But if any one asks himself what really remains most dis. tinctlyimprinted onhis nmemory after a regular course of the "Bonffes" he 'will find himself answered by a reminiscence ot the ioyous face of iL Pradeau, whose countenance might serve as a model for the statue of Momus. When MI. Pradeau was present the evening waa gay; whren IL Pradeau was absent the evening was dull.

ROYAL ITALxAN OPBRA. The second performance of Fra Diavolo, on Saturday night, drew one of the most brilliant audiences of the season. HIer Majesty, Prince Albert, tho Princess Royal, tho King of the Belgians, and the Princo of Prussia were prese¢t, and remained ti2l the end of the opera, The success of the first night was fully confirmed, and the same hongurs were accorded to the principal singers. By the adaptation of Fl a Diavolo to the Italian Stage a welcome addition has been made to the repertory, which was beginning to languish, not only from want of novelty but from neglect of existing masterpieces. The operas of Signor Verdi have, no doubt, a certain merit, the later ones especiaUy; but we have had a surfeit of them this season; and where the real interests of music are to be takenr into consideratlon, " toUjours" anything is preferable to " toviour-' Verdi. If it is desirable that the true art of s' ging shall ba perpetuated, the shorter the reign of the ' Nabuccos," "Ernanis," "Trovatorea," "Traviatas," &a., the better. The reappearance of the rsost gifted of French composers-whose JfasonicUo and Gustave must unfortunately lie inaboyanceuntil the new Covent-garden rises from the ashes of the old-must bo hailed with Batisfaction by aU lovers of genuine music. Though not so great a naster of rocea song as Rossinianda few of his compatriots, Auber, next to Boieldieu, is the Frenchman -who has written best for the voice; and this, combined with his inexhaustible vein of tune, his keen dramatic instinct, comaic perception, mastery of orchestral colouring, and general knowledge of design-in a word, his brilliant tusical genius-reudera him an invaluable acquisition. The success of Fra Dicrvo?o augurs well for the future, and may be the happy means of affording some occasional relief from avenging gipsiesandconsumptive courtesans. It isalsogratifying that this success should not be merely attributable to the lively drama and picturesque mnsic-both of 'Which have long been familiarly known-but to the excel2ence of the performance. The most interesting pieces that have been added for the present purpose are a comic air, in which Lord Rocbarg (Allcash) describes his adventures, and a trio for Fra Diavolo, Beppo, and Giacomo, both of which, the last espe. cially, are capital specimens of Auber's maner. Thero are other new things, however, and among the rest apretty duet for Lorenzo and Zerlina, where the lAtter vainly attempts to propitiate her jealous brigadier. But most to be praised is the admirably fluent and ingenious vay which the spolken dialogue of the French drama is turned into accompanied recitative. That this should be done skilfully was no more than was expected from so practised a master; but Xt Auler bas surpassed expectation, and rivaled the most finished Italian models of this kind of Composition, which, as all who have studied the subject must be aware, is an art in itself. The interpolation of a florid and difficult air from the opera of Le Serment (pro duced mnany years ago at Covent-garden Theatre under the title of The Coiners) was, we think-, ill advised, since, although it affords an opportunity for some wonderfully finished and surprising vocalization on the part oi Aladame Bosio, itiswholly at variace with the character of Zerlina, and thus materialy injures the delicious and suggestive muLic of the chamber scene. Lorenzo's ballad, nicely as it is sung by Signor Neri Baraldi might also, together with the succeeding duet, be omitted. To arrest the dramatio progress of the last act by displays of seniament and repetitions of points already indicated is both superfluous and hurtful. Nevertheless, everything considered, it is a remnarl-able fact, and a proof of the joint skill of poet and musician, that, notwithstanding so many additions and modificatiorns, Fra Diaroto should have lost none of the vigour and sparkling freshness which delighted every hearer in its original shape, and established it in the opinion of judges as the Barbiere of the French Roasni. Nothing can be more effective than the style in vwhich tho opera is got up. The three set scenes exhibit Mr. W. Beverley to the best advantage, and show that he can produce good pictures without recourse to that intricate machinery to which he owes a great part of his celebrity. The costumes are pretty and appropriate, and Ir. Harris's inventive talent Tas been most favourably employed In the superintendence of al those details of grouping and action which our neighbours class nnder the general head of "nsise enw scine." The prayer and the UsrantsUiz in the last act are little, if at alL. inferior to the corresponding incidents In Meseniello. Zerlina's costumes are somewhattoo fine, itis true. Thedaughter of apoor innkeeper (who waits, moreover, upon his customers), would scarcely he arrayed in silks, or retire to rest in an exuberant circumference of crinoline; but perhaps it is considered more important that Madame Bosio should look handsome than correctly represent the character she is portraying. The genius of the head machinist of the theatre, too, might be exercised withont much intense applicationin contriving a more accommodating bell than that which signals from the hermitage the approach of F'ra Diavolo, but sways to and fro without any refereace to the sounds supposed to proceed from its ominous tongue. It is not exactly the distribution of the chief personagesalthough that is highly efficient-but the manner in which they all sing and act in concert that produces so satisfaotory a result in the performance of F-ra Diavolo. In this respect the Opera Comigne itself, famous for such unanimity, is successfully emuIated. Every one does his very best, and 2;jr-7y. _d wheun it is stated that Baraldi, Tagliafico, Polonini, Zolger, and Ronconi are the Ilprincipals' Signor Gardoni does not convey averygraphic notion of tha!orzmidAble brigand; zorishisfirst dress (ncatoffcoat, ithhitewaistcoat andeinxspresiees)catall appro priate, when it is remembered that the puretgzded marquis makes his entry upon the stage in travdlhng costume, Bant under any circumlstances it is netsa part of this gentleman's idiosyncracy to make one believe there couldbeoanything ferocious in his nature. Thus his singing, wihich is almost throughout artistic an,d expressive, is least effective In the trying air of the third act, where the robber. now in his true colours, exultingly describes his exploits. All the rest is capital; the serenade, "Agnese la Zitella," but for its unavoidable tra4sposition and a certain cadence at the end, we uld he perfect; while in the concerted music the exertions of Signor Gardoni (as, Indeed, of his companions without exception) are beyond praise. Madame Boeio's Zerlina would be better for a little auimation in the first act, where she attempts nothing at all, and looks much more of a fine lady than "tiladi" BRooburg herself, who wishes to pass for the pink of fashion. But the bed-room scene is charming-easy, natural, and graceful from end to end,and when inheraltnam bers Zerlina warbles the soft notes of the prayer to the Vir. gin,whicharrests the uplifteddagger of Beppo, crinoline and al are forgotten intheabsorbinginiluenceof such exguisite melody. The first barcarole (the description of Fra Diavolo) is too low for Madamne Bosio's voice, but the rest may be pronounced faultless. The air from Le Serm-cnt is one of those polished displays Of elaborate execution which place MIadame Bosio, among the present race of Italian singers in the 'dorid style, nearest to the unequalled Alboni; and no wonder the audience are excited to enthusiasm. Signor Ronconi's Lord Rocburg is among the most humorous delineations even of that prince of lyric buffoons. It bears as much resemblance to an Enlish gentleman as a hippopotamus to a racehorse'; but, like the actors at the Opera Comique, the French tauderilles, and the Italian " buffo" theatres generally-and in strict accordance, it must be added, with the intentions of M. Seribe, who, in his Domino Noir, has represented his ideal "IMilord" in precisely similar colouts-Ronconi adopts tbe grotesque view, and carries it out to perfection. What from a performer of less genius would be simply absurd, from him becomes not merely acceptable but irresistible. His "make up" in every act is exquisite, while his deportrment is droll and original to match. Whenever he appears he excites laughter. The bickering scenes with his wife, of wbich the quarrel duet in the first act and the point where he surprises the Marquis enchanting Lady Roeburg with that eternsl mandoline which robs him Of al his peace of mind, offer the raciest examplesare indescribable. In short to convey on paper any proportionate idea of such an impersonation would be about as difficult as to obtain a daguerrotype view of a steeplechase. We give it up. The wonder is, that amid all this amusing and rest ess by-play Ronconi can manage to pay such attention to the musical part of his task as never to encounter a hitch; but he does contrive it, and in every concerted piece where Lord Rooburg is concerned his singing is as ready and correct as in the opening air, which divertingly describes his travels and adventure vwith the brigands. MIademoiselle Marai's Lady Ilocbarg, like all she attempts, is agreeable, unobtrusive, and clever; nor need a better Lorenzo than Signor Neri Baraldi be desired. The two robbers, Beppo ancd Giacomo, could hardly have been allotted to rnore able representatives than M.Md. Tagliafico aad Zelger, the contrast between whose personal idoentities is highly favo-able to the comio effect they conventionaDy aim at producing. As a grotesque picture of a half holly, half cowvard, who would stab an innocent girl and crawl upon his knees at the name of the Holy Virgin in a breatb, who iirst awaggers and then cringes before his scow master, the Beppo of Signer Tagliafico asremarkable. Nevertheless both he and his companion. MI. Zdlger. should desist from their attemts to raise laughter from the audience-which are al very well In their proper place-at sch moments as the first utterance of the prayer from the i of the sleeping Zerlina, and vwhen the dagger from the faltering hand of his chief, o comit the murder himself. Here their "fun," diverting everywhere else, must be condenmed, and the more since it damages the effect of some of the loveliest music in the opera. The overture, the quintet in the first act, the sleeping trio in the second (wvbich is worthy of Mozart himself), the three finales, and, indeed, all the concerted pieces, were performed In a manner so admirable as to disarm criticism and confer the greatest credit upon Mr. Costa and those who Sing and play under his direction. The production of Fma Diavolo altogether is one of the most honourable achievements of the Royal Italian Opera.
THB AUSTRALIANJ M4AIL CONTRAOT. TO THE E:ITOP OF THE TMES. Sir,-On Thursday night, the 21 inst., tho expenditure of some 13,0001. of the public money in the purchase of a picture furnished matter for a very long and livelydisaus. sion in the House of Commons. The Seraotai, to the Treasury had prepared hihself with an elaborate defenrce in the shape of a " faithful history of the transaction," bat the Premier was not the less obliged to come to the rescue, to create a diversion, and thereby secure the annual vote for the purchase of pictures by an allusion, in his clever way, to the Manchester Exhibition. Now, there appears little connexion betwoeen pictures and postal contracts, but how to account for what was pasing In the mind of the Secretary to the Admiralty when he made the joke last year which is recorded in Lord Elcho's speech on the picture question-" that he did not belleva the picture was a Paul Veroncee; he believed it Was a Wilson," unless onie repated bad bargain had suggested atother, and the Australian mail contract, an undoubted Wilson, being a bargain made about the sarae time, perhap3 the Secretary to the Admiralty thought that a counterfelt, and hence the joke. The postal contract is, however, no matter for joking so far as the public pocket is concerned, and for this reaFson it Would bo Well if the .Stcretary of the Treasury were called upon to give a. "faithful history-" of that transactior also, when the money to meet it has to be voted; and the hon. gentleman might likevise be asked to account for the great disparity between what he promised the public in June, 1856, and what the public received in June, 1857. The following facts may serve for the gaidance of hon. members who are averse on principle to a lavish expenditure Of the public money, whether on pictures orpostal contracts, and the sam they will be asked to vo0t for this particulhr contraot being little short of 200,000. per annum they cannot fairly be taxed with haggling with the Government it they demand a full explanation of the matter. In June, 1856, the Secretary to the Treaury had before him, pursuant to the invitation of the Government, tenders for a postal service between Suez and Australia, and on the 26th of that month he reported to the House of Commons the acceptance of one of those tenders. The choice lay be. tween two, the sum asked in the one case being 140,0007. and in the other 185,000 per annum, and the latter was Accepted. The grouands for puttink the couxary to the dif. ference of cost between the two-namely, 45,0001. per anmum, are set forth in a Treasury minute dated the 24th of June, and this minute should be carefully compared with the tenders themselves, and the correspondence relating thereto (all of which are to be found in a return to an order af the Hlouso of Commons, dated the 3d of July, 1856), and headed " I ustralian Postal Service "), in order to arrive at the errors of fact and argument therein contained. In Mr. Wilson's speech of the 26th of June he stated, ic referring to the competing parties, that one tender (the rejected) "was made by a well-known and very powerful company, which is perfectly capable of carrying out the service, having already in their possession a sufficient number of vessels," and that the other (the accepted) being made by a company, "strangers to the Govermment, we thought it our duty to make particular inquiries as to their responsibility and their power to carry out ibe contractfor hich they have tendered. I am happy to say that nothing can be more satisfactory than the information vwe have received, not only as to their ability in point of capital, but a3 to the knowledge and businesslike habits of the parties to carry out whatever service they may undertake." The ability of the successful competitors being thus vouched and the responsibility of placing the contract iu their bands at the above enhanced price belng thus acceptel, it is natural after a lapae of 12 months to compare what was promised by and for the contractors with what has been -serformed, and with what is now goiag on, and then to seek an expxsnaun u - no g oa h o The contractors engaged to petform tEe ssern- Ymu s vessels between Suez and Australia, or six vessels if it wera extended to Southampton, which was done. Of these six vessels, three-the Oneida, European, and O0oIumbian-were inexistence; theotherthreenamed inthetender-the Australian, Melbourne, and Sgdney-the contractors intended to build a quickly as possible, sad their completion was promised for the months ot MaIrdh, April, and June of the present year. In July, 1857, the matter stands thus :-The Oneida is oa her wvay from Australia to England for- heavy repairs, the European, the Columbian, and the Simnla (the latter a vessel chartered from the Peninsular and Oriental Compaey) are left for the present to perform the work between Suez and Australia. The service between Southampton and Alexandria is performed by steamers belonging to and under the management of another company, while of the three vessels promised to be completed at dates hvow past not one has yet been submitted to the Government for survey. Only two vessels, therefore, of the six named in the tender-that is to say, the European and Columbia-are atpresent engaged in the perform%tce of the contract. And how has the contract been executed ? Up to this date five monthly departures and five monthly arrivals of rnails should have taken place; the departures from Southampton were regalar for the first four months, bat in the fifth (June) there was no departure vi& Egypt, and there was no steamer at Suez to take on the first (the February) mnail despatched from Soutbampton, so that the Febryac and March mails will have reached Australia together. As regards the arrivals, the first mail left Australia at the appointed time (23d of January), but nothing was heard of it until the receipt of the second' mail, which brought news that the Oneida with the first on board had not been heard of after leaving King George's Sound. A month of mosa anxious suspense ensued, when the steamer with the third mail brought particulars of the Oneida's break down, and brought her mail also ; thus the first and third mails arrived together. The fourth mail arrived in due course, but the fifth mail, due on the 2d inst., was wanting altogether. In the face, however, of all this confusion and irregu. larity Mr. Wilson is reported to have stated in the House of Commons on the 8th ult. (at which time the inability of the contractors to bring and despatch a mail in June was known to him) that the contract was being carried out to the " perfect satisfaction" of the Government. On the 3d inst. the following appeared in the City Article of lThe Ti bes:-" It is understood that an amalgamation between the Royal West India Mail Company and the European and Australian Royal Mail Company h s been agreed upon, smbject to' the approval of the shareholders,"and rutmours became rife that in the event of that amalgamation the present contract of the first-named comnpany for the West India and Brazil service, which costs 270,0001. por annum, was to be extended for two years beyond the data fixedafor its expiration, -in other words, that the West India Company wero to be bribed by the difference for two years between 270,0001. and the amount at which their service would be taken if put up for competition, on condition of their extending their support to the company holding the Australian mail contract. On the 6th inst. a direct question as to the truth of thLrumour was put to the Secretary to the Treasury, and it was met by a reply very far fromn a negative I This morning there appears in the City Article of your journal au abstract of the basis on which the amalgamatien referred to is proposed to be carried out, and it now seems that an extension of the enormously expensive contracts of the two companies is in contemplation. Comamenit on such a proceeding is superfluous, andif the expenditure of the small suim on theopicture was of sufficent publiE interest to provoke a debate wlich filled up six columns of your valuable space, surely a transation which involves the expenditure of hundreds of thousands will not be allowed to pass without a close investigation. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. W. .J iy 'u.

ZONDON, MONDAY, JULY 13, 1857. To say that the news from India which the telegraph sends us need cause no anxiety would be, perhaps, to counsel a confidence bordering on apathy; but we may at least assert that to meet the dangers which we this day announce the Indian Government is acting vith an energy which, perhaps, ere this has restoredl tranquillity. The Home Government was able in this instance to anticipate the daily press, and received news in the course of Friday night, -which it discussed in Cabinet on Satufday. However, the intelligence was only allowed to ooze out partially on Saturday evening, and during the whole of yester-day the public mind was naturally much excited. The fact that Sir CouN CAmIPBELL had been sud. denly appointed to the chief command in India, and had actually, with heroic promptitude, taken lis departure, led overy one to believe that the Government entertained no small apprehensions. It is with the utmost gratification, therefore, that we give our own despatch, from which it will be seen that in Bombay it was considered that the crisis was past, and that order wvould before this have been restored by the capture of Delhi and the destruction of the mutineers. The mutiny had spread to several other regiments of the Bengal Army, and the total loss by revolt or desertion was estimated at 26,000 men. It must not be thought, however, that all or even a large part of these are in arms against us. As a general rule, the Sepoys have simply disappeared; they have fled -from their colours in large numbers, and betaken themselves to their villages, or to wilder places of concealment. General ANsoN died of cholera at Kurnaul on the 27th of May. As Commander-in-Chief he had not an opportunity of acquiring distinction; but the appointment of General PiroHc GxANT to be his successor does the highest credit to the Indian Government. General GRANT is in the Company's service, and a short time since was selected for the command of the forces at Madras-a post until that time always filled by a QuEES's officer. He was Quartermaster-General under Lord GouGH in both the campaigns of the Punjab, and has always been described as a soldier of the highest merit, and possessing in an extraordinary degreee the confidence of the Indian Army. Intelligence to the 8th of June had been received from Delhi. The insurgent troops, joined by other bands of malcontents, had found themselves strong enough to accept battle outside the walls. They had been defeated, with the loss of 26 guns, and driven within the town, which was to be assaulted at once. Whatever courage desperation may give to these unhappy men, we cannot doubt that they will bo uinablo to resist for any time the attack of European troops, and that the next mail will bring intelligence that the mutiny has been crushed and the ancient city of the MoGuLs once more in our possession. The only further news of importance is that the revolt is confined to the Bengal Army, the troops of the Bombay and Madras territories being so firm in their allegiance, thatEuropean regiments have been sent from those Presidencies, as well as from Ceylon, to the scene of disturbance. These are the facts of the case so far as we are informed, and we give them without any attempt to theorize or to prophesy, although the course of events accords pretty much with the view we had taken. It is evidently no local disturbance arising from any definite grievance, real or imagined, with which we have to deal. It is the rising of a whole army against the supreme Power. What have been the real causes, the hidden springs of this general movement, we do not know, and perhaps can never know; yet it is not difficult to form a shrewd guess as to much that remains unseen. The inaction of a vast army, conscious of its superiority in nurmbers, and unconscious of its inferiority in skill and courage to Europeans, is no doubt a powerful and abiding caTse of danger. The fear of proselytism may have had something to do with the outbreak, although it is probable that this has rather been the instrument by which the more cunning spirits have influenced the weak than the original source of discontent. There is, however, no reason for despondency. Changes in the army and the civil administration may no doubt be the consequence of the present events, but for the security of the Empire there is no fear. The worst prospect is a heavy biU of costs. To sena out 14,000 troops at once and several thousand more in a short time, to hurry regiments from all parts of India to the North-West Provinces, to delay the Chinese Expedition and keep steamers and gunboats idle in the Pacific, will cost money which must be nait1 eithe -by thle - lisb or the native taxpayer. But further than this we see no evil before us. Lord CAwiiNG has able advisers and assistants in such men as General GRANT, the LAwRENczs, and Sir JAmEs OuTi1r. India itself is in a state of profound peace, and every English regiment is available for service against the mutineers. With these advantages we ought soon to hear that this dark cloud has passed away.
Parliament, which steadily refuses to undertake or contiol the education of the people, is nevertheless going so deep into it, and running so near to the repudiated principle, that there is need of some effort to number and distinguish the various classes of its pupils and proteg6s, and to state the mode in which it regards each of them. Not to speak of Universities and Colleges, of preparations and examinations for the military, naval, civil, and Indian service, and confining ourselves to the working part of the comnnmnity, for whom the appeal has chiefly been made, we have half-adozen classes whom Par'Liament does in fact educate, and for whom there is now a considerable mass of legislation. First come numerous schools attended by the children of working people, small tradesmen, and parents of even a higher grade,-the Parochial, National, British, Church of England, and other religious schools, under the Ecducation Committee of the Privy Council. Then there come the Factory Schools, the Union Workhouse Schools, the Prison Schools, and to these are now added two classes of more recent invention,-schools for young law-breakers called "Reformatories," and schools for young vagrants, intended to be in a special sense " Industrial Schools." It will be very strange if all these classes do not exhaust the whole population of the country. Indeed, it will soon be hard to find any boy whose education is not to some extent under Parliamentary influence. The battle, like many other battles, is fought in detail, and the day must inevitably come when the " principle" is found to have been long ago disposed of by the surrender of every position embraced in it. The present Session having but a short time and much to do, confines itself to Reformatories and Industrial Schools. These schemes, though founded on the same philanthropicalideas; and sisters after a, famhion, are not to be confounded, for they are distinct in the classes they propose to undertake, and even more so in the present sources of their foundation and maintenance, and in their proposed management. The Industrial Schools are for the better training of poor and neglected children in danger of becoming criminals, but whose utmost offence hitherto has been begging or vagrancy. The Reformatories are for actual offenders, who but for such institutions would have to spend a certain time in gaol, and then be set at large, generally to find their way back again before long. Pursuing the comparison, the Industrial School has a close affinity with our Poor Laws and the existing schools under the Privy Council. The Reformatory is a milder and more humane form of prison, and is meant to spare the magistrate the painful necessity of sending young urchins to the huge, expensive, and unimproving county gaol. The Industrial Schools are voluntary institutions, like other schools ; it is proposed that they may be "certified" and inspected like other schools; that magistrates may have the power of sending young vagrants to them, to be there maintained out of the rates, with provisions for reimbursement, as far as possible; from the parents theimselves. The maintenance of these schools, then, falls partly on the charitable public, partly on the rates, partly on the parents. The Reformatory is to rely on all these sources, but also, as now, on the Government, which recognizes the penal character of the institution by givinDg head-mon-y for the inmates, The B1il now before Parliament, and out of Committee in the Commons, is for enabling county and borough magistrates to contribute out of the rates for the foundation and maintenance of Reformatory Schools. It was in the discussion upon the former of these measures, the Industrial Schools Bill, that there arose one of those difficult but frequent questions with which nature baffles alike the tact of the parent and the wisdom of the legislator. What is a boy? When does he cease to be a boy and become a young man? The answer varies, not only as one authoritymay have differentviews from another, -an agricultural member, for example, from a metropolitau,-but also according to circumstances, and according to that still more prolific source of variety, a boy's own temperament. A ploughman's boy will often be delighted to find himself his own master at the age of ten, while there are young genllemen who consider themselves still in leading strings at twice that age. Indeed, there is no age whatever at which a lady of strong maternal instincts will recognize her son's right to choose an employment, an abode, a friend, or a wife for himself. Yet the House of Commons on Wednesday morning had to settle as well as it could up to what age a boy might be detained in an Industrial School, as not wholly responsible for his acts; and also up to what age his parents should be supposed to divide that responsibility. We presume that in this matter the House did not pretend to look backwards with a retributive glance on. the training of the boy, as if a bad boy at the age of 14 must necessarily be so by the fault of his parents. No doubt, it is often their fauilt, but there are natures that from the earliest infancy are ungovernable, and there are circumstances that always will be unfavourable to education. When the father of several children, in the humbler ranks of life, loses their mother, he must commit them to strangers, or to relatives -who to children are strangers ; and it never was known that anybody could supply a mother's place to a child. Extreme poverty, continued sickness, and other misfort-unes necessarily interfere with education and discipline, so that no one who has much to do with children will ever be hard on the parent. We assume, then, that the House of Commons looked chiefly to what the parent might be doing, and ought to be doing, for the child at the time. Supposing a boy of some age up to 15 detected in vagrancy or crime, and yet not a fit subject for the gaol, how is he to be dealt with? How is, his parent to be dealt with ? On these questions did the House of Commons divide on Wednesday, and in both instances the decision is one that will not meet with unanimous approbation. With regard to the first decision, which was that juvenile offenders might be detained in anIndustrial School up to the age of 15, against a strong protest in favour of 12, we have to consider what the institution professes to be. It is Intended to b3 a very practical boarding-school, where boys are to be housed, fed, and clothed, with much material comfort, where they are to be taught useful trades and whatever else they can learn, and where, also, they are to have the rare benefit of personal religious instruction, tender appeals to their consciences, and the great truths of religion brought home to their hearts and understandings. There is many a well-to-do household and many a school, public as well as private, where a boy has not these advantages. As for its being a place of detention, all schools are prisons, and some very drfl ones; and as for the company, there wil always be bad company where a dozen boys are assembled; there will always be one black sheep u ivt>, ana one -is enough. But if any boy caught begging or strolling may be here detained tiUl he is 15, the instirution threatens to be X av comprehensive one. Of course, he will never be sent there if the parent can do better with him. But here comes the difficulty. In most instances the parent will not know what to do with him, and wiU be only too glad to have his son safely provided for in a good school at the public expense. We confess ourselves alarmed at the very wide door this seems to open. In the lower ranks of life, in the less civilized or less patriarchal districts of England, there are thousands of boys with the most decided criminal tendencies, whose parents will catch at the idea of a good industrial education, within four walls, up to the age of 15. The institution is open only to " vagrancy." The candidate for admission must qualify by obstinate idleness, incurable truancy, and a steady predilection for bad companions. For boys of such " antecedents" is reserved the special favour of an education that shall enable them to rise in the world. The clean, smooth-faced, regular boy, who creeps along the village every day with his satchel, and is his mother's darling and his grandmother's pet, wil only live to do his duty in that station of Efe in which HxAvEN has placed him,-at the plough tail, in the ditch, or on the barn floor. The bad boy, who makes himself the terror of the neighbourhood, and who seems to contain within himself the ineradicable seed of every vice, is to be manually and intellectually developed at an Industrial School, so as to rise in the world, and become a blacksmith, a carpenter, an engineer, or anything you please. Of course, this applies in a degree to the case of the merest children; but up to the age of 15 there is a very wide opening. The other decision come to on Wcdnesday has, it must be admitted, a counteracting tendency. The power of coming on the parent for the maintenance of an inmate in an Industrial School is an element very likely to be considered in the question of keeping him there. Parents, too, wiU not be quite so apt to drive their children into the place, if they have to contribute 3s. a-week to the cost. Even to the age of 15 this check will be found very efficacious. But then comes the questioinof natuire ana justice. Have we a right to compel any parent to contribute to the keep of his child up to the age of 15 ? May we put it in the power of any boy to get admission into one of these schools up to 15 at the partial cost of his parent ? This is a serious question, and we must say that the House of Commons has answered it more as a guardian of the pubic purse than by the common. sense of the country. Perhaps it was necessary to give to the magistrates a discretionary power in the matter, for no doubt a mechanic who earns his 30s. a-week may and ought to contribute a tenth of that sum to the maintenance of the big boy whom he cannot keep in order. He must not saddle the whole of his misfortune on the public. But when the proviso eomes to be regarded as a law which may be enforced against a labourer with a large family and only 10s. or 12s. a-week, then it assumes the questionable look of potential oppression. As a general rule, and as things now are, such a father, so circumstanced, cannot maintain his son even at the age of 12; he cannot control his son; he cannot keep him at school; he cannot confine him within doors; he cannot dictate his companions or his amusements; he is himself at his work, and has none to help him. On the other hand, the boy's own feeling that he can get a livelihood makes him independent in temper andbearing. There is, then, an actual independence, L and consequently only a small amount of actual responsibility. We are sure that in most rural districts it would be tliought ouf of the question that the labourer should maintain a son at the age of 14, or contribute 3s. to his. maintenance. The rule? of course, is only disretionary and we trust that discretion will generaDy be shown in its non-observance. I ~ ._ _ _
Two unfortunate or misguided permns have contrived to sink below the humble herel of morality which is c-nsidered indispensable on the Turf. In deference to LordDrany's recommendation the Jockey Club, by a notice which we published on Saturday, exiles from the sphere of its jurisdiction a member of the profession who has won large sums of money with loaded dice. The crime which is in another case punished by exclusion from the Newmarket Racecourse is not so distinctly explained; but a censor can scarcely be at a loss for subjects of notation when he selects the betting-ring for the exercise of his functions. The difficulty would consist rather in selecting the virtuous exceptions than in punishing the multitude of delinquents. Perhaps if would have been more prudent to let Justice continue in the slumbers which have been so long unbroken. The blow which has fallen on one or two persons who have become exceptionally notorious proves that the residuary reprobates are deliberately tolerated by the aristocratic rulers of the Turf. Lord DmayV, with evident sincerity, laments "that the number of men of station and fortune "who: stpport the Turf is gradually diminishing, " and that an increasing proportion of horses in "training is in the hands of persons who keep "them, not for the purpose of sport, but as a "mere instrument of gambling." Sport, or, in modem French language, Le Sport, is an ambiguous or elastic phrase. The term is properly applied to such pastimes as hunting and shooting, andit may fairly include that part of the pleasure of racing which consists in watching the performance of the horses; but the men of station and fortune, who are, it seems,gradually desertingthe Turf,are by no means indifferent tothe accompanyingexcitement of betting. All habitual frequenters of races, and many who never visit a course, make books on every successive event, and look upon the horses in precisely the same light in which they regard a pack of cards. The Stewards of the Jockey Club themselves, probably, condescend to share in the general custom of speculation. No owner of a horse can be indifferent to the chances of success which are necessary to make good his enormous ontlay. Perhaps the ultimate cure of the disease will consist in the acceleration of the process by which the number of racing men of station and fortune is dwindling into nothing. The proportionate increase of persons of inferior station, or, in other words, of professional blacklegs, will not be checked by any verbal remonstrance. In all branches of business and amusement those who earn their livelihood by an occupation wiUl, in the long-run, beat the amateurs. Even at the cricket-ground the gentlemen of England, who have apparently devoted their lives to their favourite pursuit, are compelled to invoke the assistance of the players as often as marylebone challenges England and Sussex. In Turf pursuits there is an additional reason for the triumph of the blacklegs. Noblemen and gentlemen for the most part let their jockeys ride to win; persons of inferior station Inow how to cover the loss of their stake by their bets, and find it expedient on certain occasions to lose a race in the Spring that larger odds may be laid against the future winner in May or September. The associate of jockeys, the boon companion of trainers, the ingenious deviser of disguises under which it may be possible to witness a private trial, learns many things material to the common object which it would be disgraceful for a gentleman to know. The parasitical adherents of the Turf may, perhaps, at last succeed in destroying their own trade by devouring the dupes on whom they feed. When all the men of station and fortune disappear 'A.^ I- A.-f ; -IU --r be worth the while of the blacklegs to live at the expense of one another. A large portion of the sporting world is identical with the vilest section of the community. The gentleman who pigeoned Nfr. SIDznnoTori- was acting in strict conformity with the moral principles of the society to which he belongs. It is not necessary that the lower class of so-called sportsmen shoutld even possess the personal accomplishments which raight be thought proper to their calling. Prizefighters and poachers must have courage, skill, and knowledge of various kinds; but the betting man may pursue his vocation in perfect ignorance of the points of a horse. Cunning and impudence, and distaste of honest industry, form the most uniform characteristics of the profession. Some among the number have frittered away their patrimony in earning the experience which afterwards proNides them -with a disreputable livelihood; others are from the first emboldened in the pursuit of gain by the knowledge that when fortune is unpropitious they have nothing to lose. Some light was tbrown on the mode of life adopted by the sporting vulgar in the revelations on PALMRn'S trial. It was satisfactory to find that the low dissipation of the Turf was not less dull than disreputable. The murderer and his victim were oppressed by cares more urgent than those which disturb the rest of the struggling tradesman. Their pleasures consisted in gloomy potations in inn parlours, accompanied by anxious conversation on the engrossing subject of the betting-book and the stable. The heavy and weary look of the professed sporting man is familiar to all who have had the misfortune to become, however slightly, acquainted with the class. Almost every member of the confraternity looks as if he were ready to perpetrate a fraud on the first opportunity. The more - ordinary and legitimate business of his life is to take advantage of ignorance or of temerity. Lord DEr.y certainly does not err on the side of excessive scruple when he declares that persons of the stamp of CooK and PA1GUEP. ought not, "when flagrant :cases of disgraceful fraud and dishonesty have "been pioved against thlem," to associate on ani equal footing with the more honourable supporters of the Turf. The vast number of persons who interest themselves in races is sufficiently proved by the existence of newspapers appropriated to their use, and by the creation of a special language for their peculiar purposes. The Derby prophets are a curious symptom of the taste which prevails amnong their disciples. Probably ten or twelve persons malke a livelihood by publishing or selling conjectures as to the issue of future races, yet the collective opinion of the Turf is as distinctly indicated by the daily list of the odds as the state of public credit by the price of the Three per Cents. The most ignorant tyro may at any moment learn gratuitously the present judgment of the most experienced speculators on the probable result of the ensuing St. Leger. The believers who support the outside oracles belong without exception to the great society of dupes. The nomad population which for eight months in the year moves incessantly from racecourse to racecourse is probably neither simple nor credulous ; but thousands upon thousands keep betting-books always open, although their actual experience of racing is confined to one Wednesday in the year at Epsom. Like all other institutions, Newmarket is becoming less exclusive. The last Prince of WAlES and his contemporaries lost their money on the heath in the morning, as they did at the hazard-table at night. Some among them occasionally indulged in questionable practies, and Royalty itself was not always exempt from sm- Iicion. Thcre were also in those days profes. ,.ional speculators to prey on the imprudence ol -their aristocratic companions. In modern days levelling doctrines and railways have vulgarized tho vices of the upper classes, and half the shoprnen in [London are familiar with the history of the associates whom Lord DERRy denounces or tolerates. The Jockey Club will probably fail in its wellmncant essay on purification. Unconvicted villainy will be little affected by the censure which is cat on two or three less fortunate delinquents. Half of the beot horses in the Racing Calendar belong to partnerihips of blacklegs, who have abundant skill and capital at commanad. Lord Gxo:EG_E B.BifTINOK acquired the reputation which made him the leader of a great party by the sagacity and energy which he displayed in exposing the ":Running " Rein " conspiracy; but the profits of a successful fraud outweigh the danger of occasional discovery. It seems not unlikely that gentlemen will be driven from the Turf by the competition of regular traders. In such a case the entire sy'5tem would speedily collapse, for no ciustom in England flourishes long when it has ceased to be fashionable. In the meantime, "the more honourablo " supporters of the Turf," who escape condemnation at Lord DERBV's hands, may possibly for a time be more cautious in their operations in consequence of the punishment inflicted on their recent colleagues.

PIAZLWCO I,MfPROVEMEBNTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I beg to direct your attention to the ruinous and disgraceful state of the buildings and property in the immediate vicinity of Backingham Palace. A number of houses from Bclkingbam-gate to within a few yards of the Gun Tavern were pulled down about six years ago to clear the site for the south wing of the Palace ;ndtheneowroadway. This operationleftfullyexposed to the multitudes who pass and repass daily the back fronts and outbuildings of the adjacent houses in Stafford-place, a taUcau which vies in ugliness wvith the worst parts of the two neb Victoria-streets. The Gun Tavern and corner house adjoining have been shored up, rendering the footway almost impassable. Many unfortunate pedestrians-ladies especiaUy-havo I seen who, unwilling to imperil their lives by passing too near these " dangerous strActures," venture into the zoadway, but here their fate is no better, the unsightly bend in it proventing ll view of coming vehicles until they are in such close proximity that they have to run for it, or be knocked down. There isan old saying which I think it would be well for the Offloo of Works to consider-"Finish one thing at a time, and do that well." If one nuisance requires to be done away with more than another, it is that by which tha greater number of people are inconvenienced. New work3 have boen begun long since the Pimlico improvements, and some have been completed; but the subject of this letter remains staring Royalty in the face -a mockery to all tho talk inhigh quarters abont"art," "improving tho taste of the people," and so on-and even bas the hardihood to ask for a new Act to prolong its existence. *¶nflfl .t AN ARCEHITECT.

,SECOND EDITION. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. TE} TIMTSX.OFpIOC Mo,day Mornzing. The following is the letter of our Paris corraOpondent, dated yesterday (Sunday), 6 p. m.:- The short flirtation of the Jountal des DAbats with that superannuated coquette the Si&cle has, as is usual in such cases, given rise to a great deal of scandal. The stories told of the irregularities of the former are such as, if true, would hardly become one of its years, station, gravity, and bitherto unexceptionable character. I am happy, however, to say that there is no foundation for these rnmours, and,tbat the liaison in question was,notwit.hstanding appearances, of a very innocent descriptioni. Among ether things it was affirmed that the Orleanist party, -whose organ the Debats is, had gone over, bag and baggage, to the Republican camp; that this was done at the instigation, and under >the guidaice, of a certain wily statesman whose talents have not always sai ed him from the reproach of inconstancy in his attachments, and even of little faith in the principles of his own party ; that this act of perversion was effected against the advice and in spite of the warning of another statesman, the austerity of whose political morals has not preveuted him from making advances to legitimacy ; that after a short and smart struggle among its persomunl,u the apostacy of the Debats was determined on ; and,with a view to maintaining its character for method and regularity to the last, that a person was depuited to Claremont to announce t*, the Prince of Orleans the fatal tidings that their last stay in the press had now failed. It was, of course, added that the Princes were deeply affected at the news, the more so as it followed so hard on the rupture of the " fasion~" which M. Guizot, M. Duchatel, MI. Montalivet, and other ancient leaders of the party had taken such pains to combire; and that the House of Orleans now stood alone in'this cold world, undefended and unacknowvledged. That these rumours thould have produced some sensation in political society is hardly to be wondered at, when the, high position, tie gravity, fbe influence, and long standing of the Joujrncal deq Debats are taken into consideration. The accession of so able and consistent an organ of constitutional monarchy to the Republic would be 'en event of more importance than thje re*cent triumph of five Democratic candidates for the city of Paris. I repeat that there is no truth whatever in these reports. TheJourna de. Dtbats has not hoisted the red flag of the Republicof M. Ledru Rollin, nor the blue streamer of' General Cavaignac and the Side. It has not embraced the Socialism of M. Louis Blanc, nor adopted the dismal doctrines of M. Prudhon and his followers. The Debats was, before the elections of Paris, the organ of Liberal opinions, of Constitutional Monarchy; and it still continues to be so. During the elections it followed a plan whicb, what. ever criticisnm it may have given rise to, was perhaps the only one left to it. It could not consistently support the candidates of the Government on the one hand, nor on the other those who were put forward by thre advanced Democratic section. It declared manfully its opposition to " abstention," and, unlike the Legitirnist organs, it constantly exhorted the electors to proceed to the bal lot. Under such circumstances it chose a middle line, and adopted a list of candidates where there were at least two who nersonified its own ieeas, and where the respectable name of General avaignac compensated in a great degrse for the objectionable character of a few otbers. The adoption of a list in which Republican names ,were found is not the only circumstance wvhich has been found fault with by the more punctilious of its friends. The unmistakable declaration in one of its late articles against the Fusion, and its preference for the present rather than for the future, as shadowed forth by the Assemble Na. Lionale, the supporter of that notable scheme, has brought down on it the wrath of the principal members of the coterie. This has been expressed in rather an undignified manner by some. For in. stance, M. Duebatel, Miniiter of the Interior in the last days of Louis Philippe's Government, has announced his intention of stopping hiis isub3cription to the D6bats, and M. Montalivet, has, I believe, done the same; M. Guizot has contented himself with expressing his displeasure at the anti-fusionist profession, but has done nothing more. On the other hand, the adoption of the &&W's list has been followed by the withdrawval, on the - art of one or two members of the Cabinet, of their subscriptions, as Aini,sters ; but they have renewed them as private individuals; for a Minister, I prezume, considers himself to be, like Cerberus, " two gentlemen at once." M. Laity, Prefect of the Basses Pyr6ndes, who has been in Paris for the last three days, was summoned to Plombi6res this morning by telegraph. It is doubted whether M. Laity will return to his Tost, as, in consequence of a difference with the Minister of State, who Is at the same time President of the Council General of the Hautes Pyren6es, on the direction of the Pyr6n6an Railroad Liaes, he has given in his resignation. It is on this subject -that he is sunimoned to Plombibres by the Emperor. The Empress is expected to return fronm Plombirres to St. Cloud to-morrow. General Lebreton, the Government candidate, bas been named Deputy by the third district of La Vend6e, and MM. Mariani and Burnouf for tIle tbird district of Corsica. The two companies of Engineers of the Imperial Guard in garrison at Versailles have left for the -camp at Chalons-sur-Marne. Those two companies form a division. A company of military hospital attendants arrived yesterday in Paris by railway .from Boulogne, andproceeded shortly afterwards for -Chalons by the Strasburg R-ilway. The new helmets worn by the Cuiransiers of the ImperialGuard are much lighterandmore convenient to the head than the helmcts aworn by the other regiments of Cavalry. The shako of the infantry -soldier has likewise been improved. The 7tlh, 46th, -and 96th Regiments, now in Paris, have been supplied -with them. The Prefect of the Gar& has published a decree fixing the opening of the fair of Beaucsire for the 15th July, and the closing at midnight of the 28th inst. All commercial bills passed there are payable <mo the 27th, and may be protested on the 28th. The railway companies, in order to give greater facilities to travellers attending the fair, have determinc1 that from the 15th inst. the trains -from Paris to Marseilles, and rice versa, shall travel throughout without changing carriages, so that the isual delay at Lyons shall be avoided. The French Government has determined that all *concessions of land in Algeria made by the Minister of War shall in future be submitted to the approval ,of ie Council of State. It is again announced that the Duke de Grammont, French AMinister at Turin, is to be appointed Am-bassador to St. Petersburg, in the place of the Count de Morny. Genera Reibell, who was received by the Emperor of Russia at Bale, on his Majesty's passage through -that town, was charged by the Emperor to express to the Emperor of the French his regret at not being able to pay him a visit. Hle then requested the General to prezent hius staff officers to him. He complimented two of the officers who had been wounded at the Masnelon Vert on their gallantry in the Crimea. A chest of arms of various descriptions wvi R6Ut to-day to the Iluperial Attorney-General by thd Mmiister for Foreign Affairs, which will serve as important evidenee in the forthcoming prosecution of the Italian conspirators arrested in Paris. These arms wim prove the connexion existing between the insurgents in Italy and the conspirators in Paris, as they are part of those discovered in Italy, and are of the same manufacture as those seized in Paris. The Pays, Ministeiial journal, publishes private letters from Calabria, which announce that the in. surrection excited in that province has been completely suppressed. Colonel Pisacane, its chief, was arrested on the morning of the 3d, near Catanzaro by a numerous detachment of gendarmes, commanded by Lieutenant Moro. He was instantly imprisoned in the fortress of Reggio, pending the arrival of orders expected from Naples. It is added that the Colonel, who is a man of great determina'ion, appeared to be much affected at the manner in which he was abandoned and the little sympathy he experienced from the people. All trace of Mazzini had been lost since the 2d, and a report was current that he had succeeded in getting on board a friendly ship. Naples was tranquil. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received "TURIN, JULY 11. "The Minister of the Interior las declared to the Senate that there liad been seized in Genoa only 5W0 muskets, 20 pistols, and 240 poniards. What had been said of the plans of tbo insurgents which had been known beforehand, and likewie that the public establishments had bEen undermined, is not true. No mine had been discovered nuder these establishments nor in the town. Tho squadron under the command of Admiral Lord Lyons, which is at La Spezzia, consists of three ships of the line, two corvottes, and three steamers. Lord Lyons arrived at Genoa on the 10th." " MADRID, JuLY IL " The Senate approved yesterday the bill on the Press The Congress granted to-day the authority demanded by the Government to collect the ta=es." "The Congress has been prorogued."

The political world in Germany, that is to say, the writers and readers of newspapers (for all the real politicians by profession are taking holyday just now), are determined to find some political motive or other for the King of Prussia's visit to his nephew, the Emperor of Austria; and, being driven to this gad necessity by the total dearth of political news, they agree to overlook the fact of the King's being accompanied by no Minister or other official person, and having for his siole companion his sister, the Dowager Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The two Governments of Austria and Prussia are just now exhibiting fully as The visit ofsno]n ousssatijt- cwcompanied- by his sister, is-in sxOfar-8"fami 2 visit, as it is paid by them to their nephew 1 mnd niece, and has been brought about by mem- 1 bers of the two families which form the con- I aecting link, and the occasion forF it is suggested l Dy the stay of the King and Qtcen in Austrian territory. That the Emperor of Aastria had not Found time to come and see them at Toplitz this year, as he did last year, is explained to some persons' satisfaction by the loss he has just sustained of his little daunghter. The visit is, however, on the other hand, in so far political, as it is instigated by members of the two families, who grieve to see Austria in political alliance with England, and Prussia pulling together writh France, and would fain see Russia again forming the common centre of gravity to both Austria and Prussia; and it therefore forms part of this scheme to get the Emperor of Austria to come and visit his uncle at the approa0hing autumn man ceuvres at the same time as the Emperor of Russia is there. To these-views, however, the two Governments of Austria and Prussia are quite strangers, and the King himself in paying the visit is certainly actuated only by a desire to prevent the acerbity and antagonism which prevail between the people and the Governments of the two States from interfering to disturb the good feeling that onght and might otherwise reign between the two families. The faint reports that are flying about here of an approaching visit of the Emperor Napoleon to this Court and capital seem to rest mainly on the cleaning and decoration of the various Royal waiting rooms of the different railways, a process which is going on just now, aud to wlhich the ailangements at the Paris terinini seem for the most part to form the model and pattern. Advices from Carlsruhe mention that the Grand Duchess of Baden, the sister of Prince Frederick AlWilliam of Prussia, was safely delivered of a son last Thursday, and that both mother and child are doing as well as can be expected. Sir PIoses and Lady Montefiore are at present ataying here on their way back from Jerusalem to England. Mlr. Curtis, our former Consul in Cologne, has been appointed Consul at Liubeck, ia the place of our late Vice-Consuil there, Mr. Blackwell, who was some time back promoted to the Consulship at Stettin. The accounts that reach us of the state of the crops intthe various parts of Germany and also of Sweden give rise to very favourable expectations of the forthcoming harvest. The plentiful rains that have lately fallen seem to have put a stop to the drought just in time to fill out the grain and load the ears. ITALY. (FROM0 OUR OwNi COIntISrONDrwT.) TUBIN, JuLY 7. With the advancement of the judicial investiga. tion of the late affairs at Genoa, fresh discoveries of the malicious intentions of the conspirators are continually brought to light, and each newly-revealed fact proves the plot to have been more diabolic In its character than had previously been conceived possible. Two days ago, for instance, people were shocked and horrified at the very danger they had eecaped from on finding that a large depot of gunpowder had been formed in a place where its explosion was so very possible that, had it taken place, it could herdly have been called an accident so far as the conspirators were concerned; but yesterday a mine charged with 15 kilogrammes of powder was discovered in a drainnear the Darsen, which it was evidently the intention of the insurgents to explode for the purpose of all6wing the convicts to escape, and which woula, no doubt, at the same time have destroyed rAuch life and property in the neighbourhood, a-Ad this has naturally created a stim more intense 'feeling of indignation and horror among tl:e peo-,,le who live thereabouts, and who are chiefly of tV'e pooxer classes. Setting loose on w,;%iety q2p bu red.s oa ruffian.s. who have thenselvO only just escaped ha,ging, and probably sacrificing as ;.!any hundreds of innocent lives in doing so, was but -hi commencement of the grand plan of the chiefs of tL ? Jacquerie movement it appears. The civil authorities qt the fitendente, Syndic, &c., were to be made prisoners and retained as hostages; or if that should be found inconvenient, they were to be shot. The officers of the garrison were to be killed in some way or other, and to this end a very carefully drawn up list, containing the names and residences of all the officers quartered in Genoa, was furnished to-different leaders of bands. The city was to be given up to plunder, and rapine, and fire. The manner in which the sacking of the city was to be conducted is gathered from instractions found in some of the arms chests; and it must be a fearful matter for contemplation to some of those Genoese noblemen who are constantly thwarting the Government of the King of Sardinia to think how effectually this part of the plan would have been executed if once the Mazzinians had succeeded in fraternizing with their worthy fellows in the Darsena. The following is from a copy of one of these orders:- "Courage! Thb first house and family that should be sacked in - street wi be the family of being the richest, the most wealthy, 2nd being spies and cruel enemie3 of liberty. Pillage and fire! Courage I" With these evidences of the atrocious designs of the conspirators daily and almost hourly brought before them, it is no wonder that a kind of panic has seized people at Genoa. All classes of society participate in it, for all have bcen exposed to the same dangers, and it may be, perhaps, that M. Mazzini, in thus disgusting his fellow-countrymen with his devilish machinations, has really at last effected a revolution which will ultimately do more for the pacification andc regeneration of Italy than he himself ever anticipated. It cannot be said, however, that all classes are equally thankful to the Government for their preservation, for the Jesuit paper there, the Cattolico, which is said to be supported by some Of the richest noblemen of Genoa and Milan, pursuej its course of invective articles against the Ministers of King Victor Emmanuel, and accuses them of being personally hostile to the prosperity of Genoa, and of having a fixed inveterate desire to reduce the Queen of the Mediterranean to the level of a provincial town. It reproaches the Ministers for having allowed the conspiracy to reach such a state of maturity-and certainly at f*ist sight there may appear some justice in the taunt; but, on the other hand, it must be recollected that without allowing the malady to arrive at a crlsis a permanent cure wouldhave been impossible, and probably those very mines and magazines that now make people shudder at their existence might have remained undiscovered until wome unlucky chance d'-closcd ther whereabouts by a frightful explosion, had the police acted prematurely. As the investigation proceeds fresh arrests have been made, and the number of persons now in confiniement is altogether about 100. Among these is a Signor Pareto, a member of one of the leadingfamilies, and whose wifeisan Englishwoman, and Misa White. The latter having refused to leave the country without the application of brate rorce was guarded d vue in her own house in the first instance, bat in the course of the inquiry such evidence has been produced of her ntimate connexion with the conspiracy that the legal authorities caused her to be imprisoned with a view to her future trial. It is said that she now asserts she is the wife of Mazzini, but, whether %his be true or not, it is charitable to conclude that hier'state of mind has been such for some time past that she cannot fairly be held accountable for her 'lh- to5-tEe6 -slt-_fe6gicI 'pna iof operations of the !ft Wianc thlefa, -%t-ot -nauehlas'transpiredproiablybecausethey had no very definite one arranged; ,ut their ideas on the subject were evidently most ~ompendious. The capture of the forts round 3enoa, the seizure of the ships-of-war in the Darsena, and the consequent reduction or destrueion of the town of Genoa, would only have formed i preliminary episode in the grand work of VItalia Liberhata, by M. Mazzini. The simultaneous attacks in Tuscany and in Calabr;a prove bhe magnitude of his conceptions, and his conduct in securing his own safety while sending his most raithful adherents to certain destruction shows how highly M. Mazzini appreciates the responsibility of his own position, and how much he expeeted might he left for his head to do when the heads of his friends should be severed from their bodies. Great quantities of arms have been confiscated daily since the discovery of the plot, showing the vast scale upon which the arrangements were made, and the Cattolioo, which is not generally a good authority, but which may, perhaps, have peculiar means of information in this instance, asserts that a vessel with 30,000 stand of arms was in the offing when the plot was disclosed, and that, having become aware of the fact, she passed down the coast and landed her cargo elsewhere. The sacrifice of those men who embarked on the Calabrian expedition appears to have been com. plete, and those of them who have not fallan in fight will, doubtless, like their comrades at Genoa and Leghorn, suffar the consequence of their rashness and credulity before long. There are some people who never are the wiser for experience, and who never can profit by the lessons of adversity, be they ever so bitter, and in this category must be classed many of those who contributed to this last offering to the Idol of Revolution. M. Pisacane, who was the leader of the band for the Calabrian coast, was a Neapolitan by birth, and had been educated at the military college at Naples, and subse quently served in the Royal Engineers there as lieutenant or captain. In 1848 he held the rank of colonel in the Roman army, and, since the restoration of the Papal Government, he has resided principally at Genoa. He was, I believe, generally esteemed a good officer by thoso who served with him, and his accepting the leadership of this forlorn expedition places his galantry, if not his discretion, beyond a doubt. For him there is nothing more to hope or fear; the leader of such a band must have been one of the first to fall by the fire of the enemy; but it is sad to think to what a fate his folly, or-wickedness if you will, may exposehis innocent relations imder the vindictive rule of King Ferdinand 1I. In Leghorn order is now perfectly restored. It appears that the majority of the insurgents in that town were natives of the Romagna. The Gligio, the new Jesuit paper of Florence, at-ibutes the successful suppression of the disorders at Leghorn to the timely warning of the French Consul, and considers that, had it not been for these opportune precautions, the rising would have been general all over Tuscany. The same authority states that the daggers found upon the assassins were all of the same fabric, some having broa.d blades, and some being revolvers-" Alti a lmin. larga, altri a revolve'r ;" and it adds that a great deal of money was spent among the people oa that day. The Pope arrived at IModena on the 2d, on a visit to the Duke. Previous to his leaving Bologna the Senatore took occaison to present to his Rol2ess the address to himself that had been sent him by his fellow-citizens. It is said, that the Pope seemed moved at the long list of names attached to the document, containing, as he was well aware it did, those of all the chief men of the province. It is not stated, however, that His Holines held out any hope that the wishes or warnings of these his subjects would meet with any particular attention on his part, for he appears to havo contented himself with a general observation gn thtg nunber of names, and a remark tj9k the curious fa of Count Zucchini having signed lt, le being i Counciflor of State. Lord Lyons' squadron arrived At Spezzia at day bread this morning. & letter from Rome of the 6th inst. Noforma ti that a h'alf-past 6 that morning commenceaL on the territory of Marino the works for continuin , the railway from Freecati to the Neapolitan frontt'r. Monsignor Abbate de Marino gave his benediction to 300 operatives working on the road. General Della Marmora, Sardinian Minister of War, sailed from Genoa on the 8th in the steamfrigate Gouernolo for La Spezzia. A letter from Genoa of the 9th inst. states that arrests continue to be mado in that city. Among the last arrested is Alberto Mario, a Venetian refugee. No injury had been done to the gas works nor had any gas pipes been cut. The Government of the Grand Duke of Tu3cany has officially thanked the Prince de Latour d'Auvergne, French Minister at Florence, for the great service which the Imperial Government of France rendered the Grand Duke. It was 1. de Sennevier, French Consul at Leghorn, who com- municated to the authorities there the conspiracy. which afterwards broke out, and had it not been for the French Ambassador's commuicationi the Tuscan authorities would have been suripised. Colonel Pisacane,whocomnmandedtheinsurgents in Calabria, served in the French-Far4eign Iegion- geria.

The ,Teownal of thte Senate has interfered very materially with the epeculation I lately mentioned of printing the new Russian tariff and publishing it separately for 80 copecs, for with its number of June 30 it reprints the whole document, bulky as it is; it comprises nearly 400 different articles, and together with the various appendices and addenda fills 40 printed sheets. The entire tariff is divided into three main divisions ; -the 1st contains a list of the goods that henceforth are to be imported free of all duty, Nos. I to 55; the 2d, goods that are in future to pay an uniform duty of 20 eopecs per pood, Nos. 5 to 83; and the 3d, goods which are to pay various duties, or the import of which is to be prohibited altogether, Nos. 84 to 367; and this third division is again further subdivided. The old principle is retained of maldng a difference of Customs' duty be. tween goods imported by water or by land in favour of the latter; and a new principle is introduced ol levying on various goods imported into the Trans. cauxcasian ports of the Black Sea lower duties than if they were imported into Ruissia or Poland; this advantage in favour of Transcaucasian trade extends even to a total freedom fromduty for certain ar ticles which are taxed mora or less heavily in the re3i of the Russian dominions. One of the items in th( list of goods to be imported duty free gives unsuma satisfactioi3,-viz, printed books ; up to the promul gation of this new tariff the duty on books hac amounted to 30 copecs per lb. This rate, and thl method of applying it, viz., according to weight. was par"arly onerous as regarded books, the in telletuW worth of which byno means incraQis thi wt Jr they areQ,
I . L-E UNIZY'JD STATZE. (nFRO)( OUR Vr YoRK Co0ktEPONON. NEW Y(t1 3 JU±E 30. The iPails of to-day carry you the aetaih, of another of the gigautic disasters for which American ateam navigation has become too famous. Thf' time the I calamity occurred in Canadian waters. On the afternoon of Friday, the 26th, the steamer Montreal left Quebec at about 4 o'clock for Montreal, having on board about thirty cabin passengers, and some four hundred and fifty or five hundred emigrants, mL'stly Scotch. When about an hour out, and abonh 12 miles above Quebec, smoke was seen to rise fr:om about midships, over the saloon, and in less than 10 minutes the whole vessel was a mass of flames. It is not easy to get an exact i-dea of the amount of effort made by the officers and crew to arrest the flames. The accounts' differ as to the conduct of the captain. One passenger, evidently speaking in a state of great excitement, says that everything was in confusion, and that thcer was want of proper management. Others say that the hose were got out, and all hands set at work to extinguish the fire. it is also charged by one of the passengers that the I steamer had already been twice on fire the same day, owing to the furnaces being badly secured and the woodwork not being properly protected by metal sheeting. Be the merits of these charges' as they may-and their investigation -may be left 'to the legal authorities of Canada-the terrible fact temains that all efforts to stop the flames were un-avAiling. --Thelight &drydeck-houseswhichfurnish the accommodations in a first-class river steamer afforded the readiest food to the fire, and when it was too late the captain bethought himself of saving his passengers instead of his vessel. Her head was turned towards shore, which was not far distant. Unfortunately, the river was shallow, and the heated machinery had become unmanageable. Withiji 150 yards 'of the shore-easy swimming distance-they struck a sunken rock. The terror of the passengers, as usual, made the boats useless. Before the steamer's head had been turned toward shore,, the mate had got out the jollyboat with the purpose of saving first tho women and children. The emigrants made a rush into it, and it was swamped. It does not clearly appear that any other boat was got out, nor is there any statement, so far as I have seen them, that any passenger was saved by means of a boat belonging to the burning vesseL The survivors appear to have been saved either through their own exertions In swimming, or by the aid rendered by the boats of another steamer, the Napoleon, which left Quebec at the Eame timo with the Montreal, and at the time of the accident was about half-a-mile a-head. She was towing a large boat, and this, together with her own boats, was sent to the relief of the burning vessel. It was impossible to approach very near to the flames, and consequently all persons who were saved had to make some effort to assist themselves by jumping into the water and either swimming or keeping afloat until they could be picked up. The descriptions, as yet imperfect, and given under the excitement of the first moments of safety, embody only recollections of personal dangers and struggles; even these, in flashes, give vivid views of the agony, the terror, and the madness which in such accidents always overturn the efforts of the few cool heads to save life, and carry the crowd to irresistible destruction. With a shorewithinl50yards, with a friendly steamer plying within easy reach of them, and with boats close at hand to pick up the stragglers, we should think at this distance that nearly all ought to have been saved, Instead of that, there is every reasonto believethatmore than 300personswereloit. You will probably get more exact information as to the number and names of the lost through the Boston journals 'of to-morrow. 1 We understand them to be mostly Scotch emigrants, who bad arrived by the James M'Kenzie. The Court of Appeals has not yet rendered its decision in the municipal case. We have still two police forces patrolling the streets with the usual a pleasant scene ensues between the respective custodians of the peace. It is to be hoped that the Court' will put a speedy stop to this farce, and let us know under which king we are to live. The state of the streets had become so dangerous that the parties were obliged to compromise so far as to set a force at work. During the past four days they have removed some 15,000 loads of dirt, and the work is only just begun. The Wabash has arrived here from Panaama with the remains of General Walker's force on board-a broken down set of men, many of whom were at once handed over to the city doctors for treatment. Walker himself still remains here without makino' headway, I fancy, with the Flibiustera. As I think I have already said, his interview with the President, which some of his friends have proclaimed as a trump card, really amounted to nothing at all. The Stock operations of the week have been marked by a further decline. Money continues in free demand, but not enough so to justify the excessive depression. The transactions of the market have, for some weeks past, been controlled by a combination of " bears," with capital enough to carry out their operations. It is well understood that these gentlemen have acted in co-operation with each other, and that every active step taken for depressing the market has been takienafter consultation. In this way they have been able apparently to zhake all confidence in the railway interest of the country. A well-established line like Michigan Central has been sold as low as 80 and 81, aew York Central at 7GJ and 77, and Reading (which was for a time sustamned against the combination) at 67 and 68. Other circumstances have combined to help the panic. The shipment of 18,000,'J00 of specie from this port in the months of M,£ay and June, the expectation of a further large withdrawal from circulation by the payment of duties under the new tariff after the lst of July, the continued rainy weather, which is tbreatening to do injury to the corn crops of this year, the decrease in the traffic of all of the leading railwFays, owing to temporary causes, the overspeculations in lands at the West, and the fear of its reaction upon New York in the autumn; the amount of building going on here, and consequent absorption of capital, the general curtailment in business, which is of itself a healthy sign, and the unexpectedly unfavourable statements of two or three of the leading railways, have combined to aid the operations of the last month. It is not true, however, that the whole railway interest has suddenly, ceased to 'deserve credit. The indiscriminate sacrifice which we now see is as unsound as the indiscriminate confidence wbich was given two or three years ago, and small English holdes of unquestioned American securities must not be tempted to sell out tleir investments at a loss because the stock-market of New York is reportedto have tumbled in under a gigantic gambling operation. There is nothing, for instance, in the reports of the Michigan Central, or the Reading, or the NTew York Central, to indicate that they are respectively worth 15 to 20 per cent. less than they were two months ago, nor is there any cause in the money-market of NeTow York for such a great fall. The defalcations in the state of Ohio turn out to be larger even than was anticipated, and it is doubtfal whether the State has any security that can be called adequate, or rather it is certain that it has not. Notwithstanding this unexpected loss of means the July interest will be promptly met in New York and the credit of the State sustained. The Illinois, from Panama, brings M1r. Bowlin, late Minister Resident of the United States at NTew Grenada. Ho has failed in his efforts to negotiW.e a peaceful settlement of the difficulties with the United States. The political straws all indicate the fall of the semi-barbarous sway wbich has so long kept that country behind the rest of this continent It is supposed here, for instance, and on authority which is believed to be good1 that, altbough the Macintosh claim may not haN-e been settled by a I cession of islands in the Bay of Panama to Great iBritin,there has been ahyothecationof the islands as security either for th futare payment of the claim or for the performance of some agreed mode jof settlement. Tl.e exact amount of truth in these rumours you carL ascertain in London better than we can here. On the other hand, the Government of the United States has its difficulties and quarrels, with. the. 'generai natore of which you have boen from tie. to time kept a'equainteda -Now they propov, to add another, by putting a duty almost ;iiQ9XMtQ i pq9A the merohandLao iuipoxtQ4 9z: don%ztic CODEUnlption, and throwing thetnsalved vfl the cc"benevoleuce" of the.

On his way there he visited both Panama and Mspinwall. The leading steam navigation men of Neyr York have also sent agents there, and we may look for an opening for settling the diflieties at last.

THE GBRAT NORTHERRH EDPATH FRAUD BILL. JTO THE EDITOR OF THE TI2ES. Sir,-You have several times admitted into your City Article letters and paragraphs reflecting on the conduct o the directors of this company in what yoru call "promoting the Bill for throwing the cost of Redpath's frauds on the preference shareholders," and therefore I presume you vil think it fair to give equal publicity to the following state. ment on the other side now that the Bill has been unani! mously passed by committees of both Houses of Parliamen "to the astonishment of its opponents," as you say. The Bill is not the Bill of the directors, but of the shareholders, whoso opinion has been twice expressed infavour ot it by very largomajorlties. The direotorslast March presented to them a Bil which would have thrown all the loss on the ordinary shareholders, and it ws rejected by the meeting unanimously, with the exception of nine votes. The present Bill was then introduced in conformity with that resolution, and with the opinion of the Attorney-General, and though it has the misfortune to be spoken against by two law lords (who are both preference shareholders), neither of them has impeached the law propounded by the Attorney-Gener., nor signed his name to tho petition which has just now b.eu so unsuccessful in the committee of the Iords. Those who did sdgn that petition represnted leza than 5 per cent. ef the various kinds of stock which zeoeive3 preferential dividends, and is tberefoza interested in. opposing the Bill; ana those vwho thought it consistent, with justice to their fellowvshareholders to vote agAinm the, Bill at the meoting last Wednesday representeda, by them. selves and their proxies, no more t'an one-fifth of the stock Eo interested in opposlng it, although a committeosof pret ference shareholders bad been attwork geWing up;cjosition, for a month before, and blank proxies, ready staMpe4 b bIen sent to al the shareholders. As it is, the preference kolders bar mnUL the. s allest. portion of the lossm They have receoivedI from 2L. 5e. toL 3L 1IO. for tho last year, andnone of thom willhavo Jostmorr than 21. lOs.. while the ordinay stock bas only got II. 1,;s. ancd lost 31. 5s,, and the A's kave got nothing and lost 4., the whole of their proper dividend for 1S56. The prwefeenoe petitioners were not conteut with this, but tried-first, by opposing the Bill, and then lby proposing an Ingeniously contrived clause, to prevent the ordinary stock from eceeiving any more dividend, till next March, and the A's fron gett.i,g anythint for two whole years, in order iat the nil "pre5crences" aight suffer nothing, andbe so exalted by & side wind into the superiorpoaition of " guaranteod" shares against all future contingencies; and they profess to be astonished at both Houses of Parliament rojecting this claimt.

ELECTION COMMITTEEBS. TAMrERPR The Committee reassembled at U o'clock on Saturday. An application was made by Mr. E. JTAxS for a warrant to compl the attendance of a witness named Joseph Tredre who was alleged to be keeping out of the way in order to avoid being called uponl to give evidence, and a witness named Caffie was called, who stated that he hadheard Tredre say that he was the principal witness, and would not attend unless he was obliged. Caftie further stated that he did not know where Tredre was to be found, and, on being pressed by the committee, produced a letter which he had received from Tredre, date6 the 10th inst., in which he was desired by Tredre not to give information as to where he was to be found. Evidence having been given of the endeavours which had been Dmade to serve Tredre, The CoNsasrr7-ra granted the warrant. Mr. E. JAMES Said he would defer the further emamination of Mr. Barton until the petitioners had had time to examine the accounts handed in by the other aide on the previous day. The-learned counsel then called Henry Proom, who said he had been an omnibus proprietor, and was now a gentleman. He had 45 tenants in Bambeth, about 10 of whom were voters. He acted as chairman of Mr. Xoupell's committee, held at St. Paul's Tavern, *Walworth.common. Did not receive any money for hs services. There was 15s. a-day put down for him on the pay sheet, but that was not for his services; it was for his expenses, cab hire, and so on. There were no cabs hired at Ir. Boupellls expense for the use of the committee before the day of. election. There was no arrangemnt made for this payment. rThe pay-sheet of the St. Paul's Tavern ceminittee-rorm 'was produced.] That sheet was sent to the central committee-room at the Horns. He did not know when or where the alteration in the sheet of the word "chairman" to "canvasser" was made. [Three other weekly pay-sheets were then produced. There was a similar alteration in all those sheets.] Witness signed tho sheets I but could not recollect whether the alteration was made before be signed them or not. On the 20th of Madch he received the sum of 151. 2s.; on the 27th he received 331. 12s.; on the 31st he received 201. 13s. 6d. Mr. Truman paid him these sums in notes and gold. He did not know who Mr. Truman was. The pay. ments were made at the Horns Tavern, Kennington. Thare were entries of W. Fry, a canvasser, lOs. a-day; also of Nurse, 10s. a-day; Pike, lOs. a-day; James, 10s. a-day; Finnigan, 7s. 6d. a-day; Paxton, 7s. 6d. a-day Blinkworth, 7s. 6d. a-day; Clements, 7s. 6d. a-day; Westripp, 7s. Cd. asday; Collins, 10s. a-day; and Woolmner, mesFenger, 6s. a-day. These persons, he believed, were all voters. There was an entry of 21. 2s. for hire of committeerooms. AUl the persons named were on the committee. On the sheet, dated the 26th of March, payment of which was made to witness on the 27th, was an entry of a payment to himself at the same rate of 15s. a-day; and payments to the other persons at the same rate per day as efore. Lloyd, the clerk, was paid 10s. a-day. The total amount of that sheet was 331. 12s. The third sheet was sent in on the 31st. It included the same payments, with the addition of Davis, 10s.'a-day. There was besides an entry for cab hire, billposting, and incidental expenses, of 21. Cab hire ought not to have been included. The whole amount of the sheets was 691. 7s. Witness paid the money as it was entered. He was in attendance, as chairman, to see that the others were at their work. Never saw anybody about the formation of the committee; it was formed before he joined it. Before that he was at another committee, at the Queen's Head, in Amelia-street. There were 10 other gentlemen on the committee. They were friendly to Mr. Williams as 'well, but no pay-sheets were sent in to Mr. Williams. He saw Mr. Trueman and mr. Doulten in the first place. Ho declined to act in the responsible office of chairman until he knew how he was to be reimbursed for these payments. The persons on the committee were mostly second-rate tradesmen, and wanted their money promptly. MRr. Nurse was a man of property in the neighbonrhood, hut not of much infuence. Dir. Truman mad earrangement with him about sending in tho paysheets to the central committee. Mr. Truman left it to him to employ 'what persons ha pleased, and to fix the rate of payment. Hie had said that none of the persons on the Committee Could have any money. There was some dissension about that, and he then said if any of them liked to go out canvassing he would arrange for their payment afterwards. The committee at the Queen's Head went on after he left it. Mr. Hughes was chairman. On cross-examination by Mr. SLADE, on behalf of the sitting member, the witness said the pay-sheets were carefully checked by Mr. Truman andthe secretary. Some items were disallowed. The 21. for cab hire, extra messengers, and incidental expenses was for the whole time of the election. The last sheet closed al their accounts. When he became chairman he found at least 20 personson the committee, besides those whose names were in the pay-sheet. He informed them that they could expect nlo payment except for services rendered, and that he could not employ them all. He did not employ a sg1e man more than he thought 'was required for thework to he done. There were extracts from the Bribery Act and the Corrupt Practices at Elections Actsenidown to the committee and placedupon the table, and he cautioned them himself every morning against any breacb of the law. He belleved the same course was adopted at the other committees. The district of his committee was rather populous. The population might be 2,000 or 3,000. The canvassers went out in pairs, with the object of checking each other. There were from 150 to 200 voters allotted to each pair of canvassers, and it was difficult to catch the voters at home, as they 'were principally clerks employed in the city. Daily retur-n-s of tb Wau,y 4 stene vOrZrs' who mieant to vote for Mr. Wilkinson, as well as those for MIr. Ronpel. They be an at 8 o'clock, and continued till 6 or 8 o'clock. They at times had to go to the city to see the voters, if they could not meet with them at home. He did not think these persons were sufficiently paid for 10 hours work a-day in all 'weathers. Tbey were respectable men, and lOs. a-day he did not call a payment at all. He was told by Mr. Truman that the central conmmittee did not recognize paid chairmen of committees, and only paid chairmen of canvassers. This 1is. a-day that he received was not a payment, but a reimbursement of expenses he was put to, and he was out of pocket. He was not bribed, and was in a position of life not to be tempted by 15sa a-day. He never had anything to do with a Lamabeth election before this. Re-exam,ined. -The amount of 61. 3s. (d. deducted from the last account was for the Tuesday, the day after the election. A charge was made for the canvassera for the Tuesday, and it was disallowed. He hardly knew 'what he was himself. Mr. Truman told him he must be superintendent of the canvaSsers. The clerk called him chairman of the comnnittee in the account, and he did not tell him to alter it. He studied the extracts from the Bribery Act, and took care to observe them. He used cabs in going to the Trinitv district nice or twice. The landlord of the St. Pauls Tavern was Mr. Thomas Corbet. Mr. Se nt R,ALLAN'TINE then called George Seaman, also the ei"airnlan of a Committee, but upon an objection taken by Mr. Phinn that he had been present during a part of the exawination of the last witness the Committee refused to hear his evidence. Mr. Joseph Tansell, a soioitor, living at Nunhead, and a voter for the borough, was then caUed and gave evidence with respsEt to the committee at the Kentish Drovers, of whbieh Mr. Seaman was chairman. The name of Mr. Seaman appeared in the pay-sheet as superintendent of canvassers, and he 'was put down for I?. ie. a-day. There were five canvassers at 10s. a-day each and a clerk at 1os. a-day. This witne:ss, 'who said lie had not been Paid anything for hLs services, thought the services of Mr Seaman *verA unnerpaid by a guinea a-day. w. 'ars, the landlord of the White Bear, gave similar evidence as to the committee held at his house. He was paid three guineas a-week for the room, and 10s. a-day as canvass8er. On cross.examination he said ho was 91. 17s. 6d. out of pocket by the election, that stun having been disallowed in his ac'o,unt. All the persons who were paid did workfor what they received. Witness was not a voter. Joseph Burgess, clerk of Mr. Ronpell's committee at the Shard Ar,,s, hut not a voter, gave similar evidence with respect to that committew, and stated that he was 8l. out of ocket, in consequence of items in his account having been s.ll}o-owed by the central committee. J. lX. Major proved that the amount charged in Mr. Ronpell's acc-.unts for posting bills at committee-rooms was 17 ?. ; that there vwere 42 committee-rooms and 351 paid canvassers; one clerk and one messengerfor each Cmamittee beintg included in that number. ~te The con:mittee adjourned until this day. BURY ST. EDMUND'S. The Casirt proceeded to hear evidenee In support of this petition on Saturday. Mrs. C)inlhmam, the Wife of a voter, stated that her husband had beeni calnvassed by Mr. Le Grice, Mr. Collins, and Mr. Bardenstle, and that one Wilson, a baker, to whom her husband .,wed money, had before the election offered her 101. off the honk and 101. to go on with the business if her hushiand would vote for Hardcastle. On cross-examination she said her husband was now in gaol for striking a policeman, but that he had been impro. perly conivicted. BY the CO' Aisv117rs.E She had never seen Wilson canvassing with Mr. Hardcastle. Evidence w'ws thaen given to show that the messengors emplpoyed on the part of Mr. Hardeastle were voters and relatives of voters. At the conclusion of the petitioner's case Mr. lONXI stated that he intended to cal witnesses on lebalf of the sitting member, and The Coiiimittee adjourned until this day. GALWAY (TOWN.) The first witness examined on Saturday morning was Patrick Lynn, a voter, who stated that on the day of th -election le was at a publichouse' iaiwnywith som o friends, likewise votoer. He there met M es ran agent, as be supposed, of Mr. O'Flahery wotl hmta if they voted or O'aherty, they ra rded or compensated. Hde also gave each of te h avso three 11. notes. One of them objec ted to reving a hal. note. Before handing over the notsWrhd prmsd them that if they voted for Olhe theys each 'have 31. Thle other halves of the noe were tob given them when they had voted. Timothy Glyn, a voter, 'who kad not gone to thepol at the last election, said that or in te Sday ber.or the polting he saw eMr. A.. nd Mx. S. O'F!aherwy and asked them to stand treat, as Corcoran had been treateet and they promnised to do so. Ward. 'who was within hearing, gave him a card, which he took to Ward's house and got 51&-worth of drink, There were other voters present. This witnoes also corroborated the account givent by Lynn as to the halfW notes offered to him and other voters by Ward, an the promise that they should receive the other halveslafte~r they had voted. In cross-examination, lie said that the conversation 'with Mr. O'F1aherty of 'which he, had spoken'oc street, where there 'was a large crowd. ocirdinan openl Edward Waldron, a butcher in Galway said that on the day before the election ho met M1iles Ward, who sa-id to him, in the presence of Madden, that if he would get 20 other butchers with him, they should have 4l. a man. Wtnessesaid he would go if the rest of the t-rade went. That nighat Ward called on him, and said he would see him justifed, and he should have 51. Witness said the trade must go together. Wardhad given him and aboutl3 other freemanlnthe same trade 30s. worth of drink in his publichouEe. On cross-examinatiorn by 3Mr. O'MALYr on the part of the sitting member, the witness sdad he was the msan who had sworn at Galway that he drank a quart of whiskey at a sitting. He drank his whiskey neat-he did not know the meaning of " diluted." (Laughter.) He had onoe voted for Mr. O'laherty without getting anything for his vote. Thero were 48 of bis trade, and they all went together. At the last election he received nothing for his vote for the town, but he did for his vote for the county. He had not made a bargain for the trade. They had neither received nor expected anything. They all voted for Colonel French. He had been promised nothing except by Miles Ward. He had made up his mind to vote for French at the time he was drinking out Miles Ward's money. When he had drank oxlt iles Ward's money he began to drink on his own. He6had never made any arrangement with a man named Gill, but be was once at Gill'a house when one of the trade said that they would vote for 10. each. He said 5. was *nough. Some other man said that the other trades got 101., speaking of the tailors, and he thought they ought to have as much. The money was refused to them, and Mr. Blake, who was the candidate at that time, withdrew. His retirement was in consequence of that conversation. They then telegraphed for Colonel French to take Mr. Blake's place. He denied that they had made an offer to Gill to vote for 41 a-piece. On re-examination he sald that in 1852 he was agent for the county election for a few hours, and got 31. He then received 31. for voting for the town. John Madden corroborated the last witness as to the conversation he had had with Ward the day before the election. Mr. WORDSwVORTHc said that, having closed his evidence with regard to bribery, he woald now proceed with the scrutiny. MIr. E. JAMEs, however, objected to the scratiny being commenced until the Committee had disposed of t)he question of bribery. The CoanTTEE. intimated that the case of bribery had better be decided before entering upon the scrutiny. mr. E. JAaxs said he would at once call thel sitting member. Mr. Anthony O'Flaherty was accordingly examlned. He said that his connexion with Galway commencedinJanuary, 1847. At the general election in that year he was raturned without opposition. In 1852 there was a contest, and he was returned at the head of the poll. A few days before the last election there was a large meeting of his supporters, which he attended. There had previously been a rumour extensively circulated that he would not be able to come to the poll, since he could notpay the expenses attendant upon the election. His supporters had called upon him to contradict this rumoar, as it was doing him harm in his canvass. Consequently at the meeting he addressed the people, and among other things he told them that he was in earnest and that he would never have takentho trouble to come forward unless he had ample means of paying the expenses. He said nothing about placing himself in the hands of Dr. Brown, nor did he give Dr. Brown any money towards payment of any expensesof hiselection. Mr.Bernard O'Flaherty was not a relative of his, but he was one of his supporters. He did place in that gentleman's hands a sum of 3501. towards payment oS the election expenses. He also placed 501. in the hands of a person named John Oliver, for the purpose of hiring a room and engaging street messengers, but he never gave himn or any other person any money for a corrupt or Improper purpose. He gave no money on account of the election to any other person, and knew nothing of any further expenditure. At the meeting to which he had referred he made no mention of a committee, and no committee was ever .formed on his behalf. L;ists of voters were prepared by clerks-nothing further. He was intimate with Dr. Brown, but did not now that Dr. Brown was on any committee. He never deputed Dr. Brown to act on any committee or to canvass for him, although Dr. Brown might sometimes have accompanied him on his canvass. Be did not send Hynes to Dr. Brown. He was very cautious in his proceedings because ho knew that a dead set would be made at him. He remembered being asked by a party of women and boys for something to drink as he was canvasslng, but he gave them nothing Mr. B. O'Flaherty might have given them 11. He had heard the evidence about the sealing of tickets and obtainingmoney for them, but he knew nothing at all about it. He was shown some tickets which he was told were used in the poling, but he knew nothing directly or indirectly of their being used in any other way. He never was asked for money for voters, and knew nothing of any money paid them by Dr. Brown. He had polled a very small proportion of freemen. He did not know that Dr. Brown saw the voters in a room after the polling until he heard the evidence given before the committee. He had never deputed miles Ward or the other men whose names had been mentioned to act for him. On cross-examination by Mr. WORDSWOcRn, Mr. O'Flaherty said, he had known Dr. Brown for many years. Dr. Brown was professor of surgery at Galway and surgeon to the Board of Guardians, of which he was chairman. He saw him in St. James's-square last Monday, and had not seen him in London before. He had last seen him in Galway about the 14th of June. He had received letters from him. The meeting at St. James's-square was quite casuaL He albe met him on Monday at his agent's. He did not on either occasion communicate with blim about the electlon. He was on intimate terms with Dr. Brown, and dined with him twe or three times after the election, and frequently conversed with him about it. He never told him about seali3g the cards. He did not know where Dr. Brown was, but had heard he had left town. He had taken no step to obtain thu attendance of Dr. Brown here. He did not canvass or the tally-room. He wasia the committee-room on e day ol polling earlyin the morning, and only about twice during tih day. He did not know who condcucted the business inthe rooar above stair He saw Dr. Brown at the house opposite the Market-house about 7 o'clock in the morning, but had nol dined with him over night. HIe might have seen him thre( times during the day. Mr. Bernard O'Flaherty took greal interest in his election. He had heard from him, but hae not seen him since the election. He had been in Oliver'shop. He did not recollect whether he had accounted foi the 501. given him. He believed some persons were proposed to form a committee for him, but he did not know who the] were, and no committeo was formed. He vwas returned ix 1852; it cost him vert little, as he was placed at the head of the poll, and he believed it was to punlsh him for thal that thas petition was presented. The previous election had cost him 1,5004., though he was promised that he should he returned free of expense. Re-examined.-He knewv nothing more than he had stated about Dr. Brown's proceedings. The rumour that he would not he able to pay his election expenses had got afloat iD consequence of his having had to pay Large sums for anothez By the CoAnirrxE1_.-He gave the 501. to Oliver for the hire of a room and the employment of street agents. Re did not know the details of the expenditure of that sum, Oliver was to choose the room and engage the men. He Bad had no settlement of accounts with Oliver or With Mr. B. 0'Flaherty. At the conclusion of Mr. O'Flaherty's examination, The Committee adjourned until this day. MAYO (COUNTY). At the sltting of the committee on Saturday, Mr. KARSLAKE proceeded aith his summing up on behall of the sitting member, commenting on the eidenc S hich hadl been given oni both sides, and arguing that although there might have been individual cases of imoroper conduct or the part of one or two priests-and for these Mr. Moore could not be held responsible-there was certainly no sufficient undue influence or intimidation proved to justify the committee in setting aside the return. Having in the course of his acddress expressed a hoPe that the outrages said to have been committed at Castlebar since the comnmencement of this inquiry, which, he observed, had only been brought under their notice in order to excite prejudice, would not in any way influence the decision of the committee, The CAUIErAN said that the committee would of course exclude from their consideration everything that had occurred the other day at Castlebar in coming to a conclusion upodnI the case, At half-past 1 o'clock the commaittee adjourned uantil this day, when Mr. O'Malley will commence his reply on the parit of the petitioner.

Chancellor Xindersley a vast length of time, and the case ended in that court by a dismissal of the bill. The appeal Is presented against that decision. Mr. BAILY opened the plaintiff's case on Wednesday, but before he had concludea other business compelled his absence, and the remainder of that ease fell to the lot of his junior, Mr. Wellington Cooper, their Lorlships having consented that if Mr. Baily returned before the address of his junior was condclded he should have the opportunity of beingfurtherbeard. At *laterperiodofthe day, Lord Justice KNIGHT BR3CE (addressing Mr. Baily) said. -The Court need not trouble you, as in your absence tho case has been most ably conducted by Mxr. Wellington Cooper, who has gone through its prominent details with !reat care, abilty, and discrimination. In performing his .uyhe has bad the double vork of stating the case and o gigtruhthe evidence, and in doing so he has had ths whole barupoublin without any one to prtect^ him btr ourselves. l[n these diffcult circumstances no one could have done the work better, and you may well defer any. thing further you may have to add until the reply, which you will have of course.

VARDEN V. BOWVE Thiswasan ppel fom dereeof Vice-Chancellor nderaley, dismissing thre plariantiff's bill. Tvheobject of the suit was to set aside a mortgage executed by the plaintiff in favour of his three sisters for 1,6001. The case was not concluded at the rising of the Court. Mr. GaLaseE and Mr. LR:wR were heard for the (Before the Lonns JuasroEs of Apr'xL.) Cl Em;XRS V. CHULDRS. This was an appeal from a decision of Vice-Chancollor Wood dismissing the plaintiff's bill. The bill is ied by Mr. John Walbanke Childers, against his infant grand. daughter, the only child of his late son, Mr. Rowland Francis Walbanke Childers, praying that the infant might be declared a trustee for the plaintiff of 932 acres of the Bedford Level, comprised in an indenture dated the 19th of October, 1855, whereby the land was conveyed to the son in fee simple. The purpose of the conveyance was to qu&Sify thesontobe lecedabif of the Bedford Level, pursuaut to the zequirements of the BedfordLevel Act, 15th of Charles II., cap. 17, by which it is enacted that every bailiff shall have not less than 400 acres of land in the leveL Th3 son was at Florence at the time the deed was executed, and died there in November following, without even know ing of the fact, and not having been elected a bailiff The deed was registered in the usual manner. The Vice-Chancellor considered that the case did not come within those authorities where a conveyanca not parted with, nor known to the grantee, nor published. is held not to pass the property comprised in it, for that the registration was an effectual publishing and parting with the deed, and his Honour accordingly refused relief.

A rgreat number of other cases were cited, and evidence was read (not before the Vice-Chancellor) showin that the practice of qualification for bailif of this corpora tion was a mere dry legal title, and not a benefical owner ship. Among the affidavits before the Vice-Chancellor was one showig that Mr. Childers in the letter which he 'wrote AO intutosfor Cthe preparation of the deed o, conveyance had stated that he did not intend to give his son any beneficial interest in the land, but merely to giva a qualfication to act as a bailiff of the Bedford Mrx.

I VICE-MIANCELLORS' COURTS. JTuLY 10. I nI TB ST. GEoBG1'S HEBTE L BUuLDMIG SOCIETY. I (Before FTce-Mancelor Sir R. T. KLN-DJR) s=.l Mlr. SWANSTOON, jum., appeared in support of a peitioie to wind up this corp any, under the provisions of the Joint. Stock Companies winding-up Acts. This sodety was In stituted in 1854, consisting o shares of 25Z. each, not fixed as to the number, the object -being to advanee money to ,nembers for the purchase of land and erection of vila dwelling-houses, and for the division of profits among the members. The rules were certified as withinthe 6th and 7th of William IV., cap. 32. The petitioner was the holder t do so. aThe pton then stated that variouI sums were due to creditors of the society, and that share. holders had not paid up their cIls, and asked for the usual 'winding-up order. Mr. FOOT opposed the petition on behalf of the society, and contended that being expressly excepted from the first section of the Act, the two Acts being in par ma*iQ-, it was, In fact, excepted altogether. Mr. SWANSTON, iun., was heard in reply. The case of the St. James's Club and others were cited. The VICE-CHNCELLOR thought that, although had he considered this as a new case, he should have had some doubt on the question, yet, upon the authorities, and the princple there Said down, his opinion was that this wa3 within the operatlon of the Winding-up Acts. The contention on behalf of the society was not tenable, for, although it was true the first section only included one portion 6f building soeieties, the second applied to all, and therefore the argument could not be maintained. The present Lord Chancellor, when Viee-Chancellor, decided that loan societies were within the Acts, and his Honour could not see such a distinction between this society and that class of associations as would justify him in saying that the samo deciion ought not to be come to in the present as in that case, consistently with such decision. the common order to 'wind up must therefore be made. Costs of both sides out of the estate. (Bcfore YiCC-Chakseo Sir J. STUART.) NAYLOR V. WRIGRT.

Byth esettlement which was made on the marriage of the plaintiff with her late husband, Mr. Jobn Whitham, and dated the 29th of March, 1848, certain real estate to which the plaintiff was entailed in fee-simple in reversion expectant on the death of her father, Mr. John Wright, was conveyed to trustees upon trusts for sale, and to apply the proceeds of such sale in trast for the benefit of the pntiff or her separate use for life, with a restriction on anticipation, and after her decease In trust for the children of er then intended marriage, as she should by deed orwilEliappoint, and, in default of appointment, in trast for the c en of suc marage, and in case there should be no children of that marriage t en in trust for the plaintiffs nephew, John Ambler Wright, absolately. It appeared that the plaintiffs father, Mfr. John Wright, had, on the 4th of March, 1848, addressed a letter to his solicitor, in which he said he thought it would be best to settle the property which was to be comprised in the then intended settlement on his daughter and her issue and their heirs and assigns for ever, subject, however, to his life interest therein. On the following day, the 5th of March, 1848, the plaintiff's father addressedanother letter to his solicitor, in which he said he thought it best that the property should be settled on his daughter for life, and at her death on her issue, if they should attain 21 years of age, and if not, then that the property should go to her nephev, John Ambler Wright, absolutely. In the written instructions also which were sent to counsel to prepare the draught of the plaintiff's marriage settlement it was stated that the property, after the death of theplaintiff, was to go " among all and every her issue of the present or any ftture marriage, in such sbares as she should by will appoint, anid in default of appointment among them equally, and, in default of issue, in trust for her nephew, John Ambklr Wright, absolutely." ]Drom some inadvertence, however, the counsel to whom the draught of the settlement was sent to be prepared drew a settlement the trusts of which we!e cofin6ed only to the children of the plaintiffs first marriage, and the draught as so prepared by counsel was engrossed, and executed by all the parties to it. The plaintiff a foraer husband, llr. John Whitham, died in 18t52, and in July, 1856, the plaintiff intermarried with Mr. John Nylor, her present husband. Shortly prior, however, to sue second marriage the mistake which nad been made in preparing the settlement was discovered. There was Issue of the first marriage one child, the infant defendant, Joha Whitham, and a few weeks ago a child of tho second marriage was born, wvho had also been made a defendant by sup. plemental order. The plaintiff, in her evidence, stated that If she had known when she executed the settlement that the children of her second and any future marriage wonld be excluded from the benefit of it she would not have Mr. R. W. E. FonsTzm, for the plaintiff, opened the came yesterday, and was followed by Mr. CRaIG, who appeared for the child of the plaintiffs second mariage. MIr. MAxns and 3Ir. WIcKNs, for the defendant William ight, who was one of the trustees of the settlement and also the father and heir-at-law of John Ambler WVright, who died an infant, did not oppose the mistake bei7ng rec- Mr. KAISSAKEX appeared for the infant child of the first marriage, and contended that the settlement could not ba rectified. The VICZ-CHANCxLLoR said that on the evidence he thought the case was clear. The plaintiff complained that the settlement which she had executed on her marriage with her former husband differed materially as to its provisioni for her children from that settlement whieh it was intended should be made. In a case of this kdnd, where an instrament had been executed and acted on for some time th) Court did not feql itself justified, except on' the clearest evidence in altering its terms. But if there was the clearest evidence that the settlement did not carry ont the Intention of the parties to it, the Court never refused to make it consistent with what was proved to have been the intention of the parties. From the langage of the two letters of the plaintiff's father, on which te instructions to counsel were based, itwas]erfectly clear that the proviions of the settlement were not intended to be confined to the children of the plaintiff's first marrage, aud the written instructions to counsel were no les explicit on thatpoint. But beyondthewritten evidencein the ease there was the clear and distinot parol evidenoo of the plaintiff that she intended the trusts of the settlemnent to extend to her children by any future marriago sho miight contract, ind that if sbe had thought suoh children would be excluded from the benefit of it she would not havn executed it.

The hill was filed to setasidea deed alleged to havo been improperly entered into and executed by tho Governor of tho Westorn Bank of London with the other defendant, the manager. Affidavits had been filed by the defendants, on which it ws necessary to cross-eramine Mr. Roebuck, M.P., Mr. Clark. and others, and it was now asked by the plaintiff's counsel that this motion might bertponed for that purpose. Mr. BAiLY and Mr. WxlCnxs, for the defendants, asked that the cross-examination might take place, orally, in court. After some discussion it was proposed and agreed that a special examiner shall be appointed, but the examination in court not being assented to, His Hoi0ou declined to mako any order in that respect. PARTINGTON V. REyNOLDS. It Will be remembered that this ease came before tho Court some time since upon a claim to large property belonging to a Mr Shard, who died intestate many years since. The case was elaborately orgued, and his Honour, after reserving his judgment, sent th case back to Chambers, expressing an opinion tha6 the claimant had made out some relationship. Another claimant had now started up inlthe person of one Robert Dowey, who claimed from Isabella Davis, who was the daughter of JohnDavis, whose sister Margaret married Robert Rutherford, of Trenton, New Jersey, 1n;the United States, which Robert Rutherford kept an inn called the Black Horse, at Trenton, and was the father of Mrs. Shard, the intestate. In support of the present claim affidavits were brought forward made by the claimant himself and others containing hearsay evidence as to a party deceased, and also three books containing entries, not purporting to be written in the books by the person recording them, but as copies from some other place. One was a book of sermons, another A Hep to Prayer, and the last an old Bible dated 1791, and all bearing the marks of great age. Mr. F. G. White and Mr. T. C. Swanston appeared for the claimant; Mr. Baily and MIr. Sheffield for the parties opposed to this claim; and Mr. Wickens appeared for the Attorney-General. The VICB}n.&NoLLoi said that if he had thought there was a chance of proviDg the case he should have directed an issue; but on the whole facts his opinion was that no case was made out. As to the heasay evidence, the difficulty was, apart from its inadmissibility, that if it were even false the party could not be indicted for perjury. The entries in the books were not such as to be absolutely rejected, but did not prove the claim, and*were evidently not of the date of the facts recorded. Mr. WicsKNS asLed that one of the books might be impounded, containing an inconsistent entry. The VICE-CHANCELLOR acceded to that application, and rejected the claim with costs. (Before Yicc-ClasceUor Sir J. STUART.) DOBSON V. PATMSON. The plaintiffs In this cause claimed to be entitledto a fund as the next of kin of Thomas Dobson, who sailed from Liverpool in 1814 as master of the ship Swiftsure, bound for Rio Janeiro, and who, as well as the ship and the other persons on board of her, had not since been heard of, and they filed this bill against Pattinson, thetrustee of the fund, for the Xpurpose of obtaining payment of it to them. The fund which was tho subject of the present suit was realized by Pattinson in the year 1844 by the sale of certain real estate, of which he was a trustee, and he in May, 1845, signed a memorandum, undertaking In the event of its being satisfactorily proved that Thomas Dobson was dead, to pay the fund to the parties who would be entitled thereto in the event of his death. Pattinson In his answer admitted that he had insisted on the production of "direct and positive proof of ThomasjDobson's death," and said that he had retained the fund in his hands since the date of the above memorandum in order that he might be able to pay It to the plaintiffs immediately on the receipt of such proof. He also admitted having offered to take to himself one-hali of the fund on the ground that he was entitled to the same -. ' - -Ansal.ion for the risk he should run in paying ovez proof he req uired of T. Do tdn's deatti. Tne lhima a monlatba to 1351., and Pattinson had paid 12D. into court rotain 101. for costs claimed by his answer. The plaintiff In= that Pattinson should pay the Costs Of the suit, and interest on the suim o MI,1 from May, 1845, at 51. Mer cent., together with the sum of 101. retained by L_rfr. MalIs and Mr. Bates were for the plaintiffs; Mr. Bacon and Mr. Hawkins for pattinson, and Mr. Batten for other defendlants. The VIC-CiiANCELLorR said it was very much to the interest of the public that trustees should not be harshly dealt with by this Court. otherwise desirable persons would nxot be readily found to fill the offico of trustee. The question was whether Pattinson's conduct had been proper, and such as any man of sense would have pursed. Hie knew that Thomas Dobson had sailed from this country in 1814 for Bio Janeiro, and that he had not been heard of since, ad instead of investmng the money he retaineditin his ownhauds, which was the very place in which he ought not to have kept it. Heashooffered!toaccept one-half ofthefunxd, asa compensation for the risk he shouild run in paying the other half to theoplIn'tiffs. A bar gain of that kdind was condutLe which this Court, w'ith the 'utmost stretch of indulgenice, could not countenanice. Pattinson must pay into court, within six weeks, 101. and interest on 1351. from May, 184u, at 51. per cnt, per annum; and he must aso pay the plain- tiffs costs of this suit.

Circumstances after. wards occurred whichincreased his mieiong, but, believing that his wife was still Innocent, he determined to remove her out of the reach of tennptation, and went to resido at Tottenham.

Plaintiff was about 28, and his wife something younner She visited at their house at Edmonton. They seemed to live together very comfortably and happily. Cross-examined.-She saw themthreetimes atlidmonton. hlr. Harding, a clerk in the samo office as the plaLntiff had known him for some years and visited him afterwards. He and bis wife appeared perfectly happy until they removed to Edmonton. Plaintiff was second bookkeeper at ressrs Harris and Co.'s. Cross-exarained.-He spent one night at Edmonton. He did not say that there was a great quarrel between the plaintiffd hiswife on account of ber attention to lim. They were then on very bad terms. He never saw platutiff sike her. He was not in the habit of going home drunk. To Lord CA5YPBELL.-lle never saw defendant in Mrs. Hudswell's company. Elizabeth Buffey was then called and atated,-I enterea into the plaintiff's service in June, 1856. I recollect his moving to Tottenham in Christmas, 1856. I only remained two or three days after. I know defendant. He lived with his father. The plaintiff generally left home at 9 o'clock in the morning and returned at 6. A day or two after I went to plaintiffs, who was then living at Edmonton, I saw defendant come in. He was in the habit of coming nearly every day -when he waa at home. He came about IL Mrs. Hudswell used to bo at the front parlour window. I never saw anything take place between her and the defendant. I have seen her sitting on his knee with his arm round her waist. I have seen him kiss her. He used to do so when he came into the bouse. 3Mrs. Hndswell's bedroom was on the first floor. I recollect being sent out one day while defendant was there. When Icarae back I sawhim and mymistress coming downstairs. I had been out about half an hour. I had been sent to the butcher's, vwhich was about a qnarter of a mile off. Mr. Hudswell had one child, a little boy, then about five years old. He went with me to the butcher's, but I was not desired to take him. There was nobody in the house but defendant anl Mrs. Hudswell. There was no roomn but the bedroom on the first floor. Cross-examined.-The defendant's father is in busineas, and defendant works with him. Plaintiff and his wife lived very unhappily together. They were frequently quarreling. I have seen him knock her down three or four times. He was a person of violent babits. He has come home tipsy very late in the morning. I have spoken to the police about his violence to his wife, and called on them to protect her. Defendant lived next door. Iam positive I saw him and Mrs. Hudswell coming down stairs. They were both onx the stairs. The plaintiff has never offered to take liberties with me. He never used improper language to me. On one ocasion I found razors under the pillow. I took them away, as I was afraid of his violence to his wife. Re-examined.--Mrs. Hudswvell was herself of a violent temper. The quarrels generally began about defendant. I have known plaintiff leave the house on account of the quarrels. I have seen his wife strike him with a poker. To Mr. CLAISX.-Irs. Hudswell indulged in drink some times also.

On the Mondays the upper sash of the window was pulled down as a signa l that the plaintiff was not at homne. Sometimes Mrsig adewell did it, and sometimes I did it by her directions. Defendant used to come in as soon as the signal was made. He generally came about 10ore t 11 o'clock, and remained until about 4 in the afternoon; he dined with Mrm. Hudawell. The plaintiff generaly came home about 6. When defendant was with Mrs. Hudswell they occasionally had pirts.

James Jobbings, manager of the Horse and Groom publichouse at Edmonton, lived opposite the premises of the defendant's father ; the name TiHley and Son -was ever the door, nan it 'was genierally understood the defendant was a partner. Cross-examined.-It was a small house; they occasionally Mr. n.t; fo th defndat, itimtedhis intention imprope inti~ . .-.~.uans ad Mr.HudswelL th of the evidence for the plaintiff it was impossible to meet it with a direct contradiction as to the only two cireumstanoes which were really of importance in the case ; he commented on the nature of the evidence as to the terms on which the plaintiffand his wife lived, and asked, was it for aman who had treated a wife in the manner described to come to that court and ask for damages for the less of her society ? The defcndant, however, denied that he was guilty. Evidence as to mere acts of levity between him and the plaintiff's wife would not authorize a verdict against him and there was no proof of anything more in this case. Ihe learned counsel then commented on the evidence of the witneis Ma3nard, and contended her story was too improbable to te believed. Lord C.USPBELL expressed his regret that such an action as that for crinminal conversation should ever have been known to the law. It was attended with many objections -among others that the wife whose reputation was involved had no power of vindicating her character. He hoped this would be the last action of the kind ho should ever be forced to try. A Bill to abolish it had passtd one Houme of the Legislature, and he trusted wvould soon pass the other and receive the Royal assent. The jury, nowever, should dismiss all theso considerations in ensidering the case before them. The first point for them was whether the act of adultery had been committed. It was often impossible to give direct evidence of the fact, but if the evidence of the servants was to be believed there could be very little reason to doubt that it had. His Lordship then went through the evidence, ard saia that if the jury were satisfied that the act had been committed they wouldl then consider the amount of damrage. In estimating them ithey should take into acount the conduct of the plaintiff and the mode in which he bad treated his wife, and keep in minad the position in life and means of the defendant The jury then retired, and after a short absenoe returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 2001. BusaINMsa oF THE COUiT.1 The remaining causes in the list were then ealled on, but both parties were not ready in any of them. The general excuse waz that the briefs had been delivered to oomnsl whbo were absent on circuit, and had tot been returned in aufficltnt time to instruct fresh counsel. Lord CAmr'nEiz said he could do no more ; he was wIinag to sit~tillaIlate hourto dispoa of tisellist; but, as the regula time of of the sittings had expired, he could not force a cawe on against the wish;of the parties.

The plaintiff was formerly an hotel and livery-stable keepr at Boulogne, and somne time ago the defendant hired of him a mare, which had cost 471., and rode out on her in company with two friends. They were all three seen urging their horses into the sea at the end of tho pier, aud the defendant brought the mare home on three legs. She oon died, and it appeared her thigh was broken.

For the defence several witnesses were calleitoprove that the 2nareexhibited lamenesson thedefendant mounting her.

In the year 18416 the defendants, who are auctioneers and land aluers, applied to a gentleman with whom they had previously had busineEs to procure a loan of 1,200 upon certain property situate at Brixton. Eventually the money was advanced on a mortgage, and on the euaranee of the defendants that in case the property should not, on being sold, produce sufficient to pay the principal and interest, they (the defendants) would make up the deficiency, together with all interest, costs, charges, and expenses. The mortgage was afterwards assigned, and the interest was for some time paid by the defendants, but irregularly. In the course of last year the aBBignee of the mortgage wishing to realize the pricipal, the houses at Brixton were put up to auction, and after some abortive attempts a sale was effected at the price of 6bOI.

The defendant had consented to publish this pamphlet for the plaintiff, and had accordingly printed l,OOO copies of it, for which the plaintiff had paid him nothing; on the contrary, he had drawwn at different times various sums of money from Mr. Goulbourn. In 1852 and 1853 the defendant repeatedly asked the plain. tiff to pay him for the printing and paper of this pamahlet, his charge for which was about 37., but the sale of the work being extremely limited, becansc, as Mr. Menzies said, it was considered libellous, and as Goulboum could get no money from the plaintiff, he at length sold the whole of the copies in his possession for 201., nowr alleging that he could hear nothing of the plaintiff, and that he was out of pocket by the transaction. After the failure of the British Bank the plaintiff, thinking that at last his pamphlet would sell, wfas anxious to obhin the whole edition from the defendant, but, finding that it was not to be had, he wroteanother work somewhat to the sama effect, which it was said had sold well. MIr. Menzies having been examined by Mr. DzE:ira, who appeared for the plaintiff, la. BoVILI., who had just come mto court, proceeded to cross-examine him, and asked, "What are yout" Mr. Justice CBuswwSl.-Mr. Bovill, if you had been here before you would have heard what he was. Mr. BovIL.-It is really very difficult to know what to do. Here are six courts sitting, and it is impossible to be in allof them. Mr. Justice CEn,swELL.-There is neither hardship nor A5fficXtfn ffih matter. The course to be r,ursued is vera' suup~'&1 ,bve onierven a very unsatisracte i stateof things since I have sat here, and I regret it. Mr. BOVILL.-I really do not know what is to be done ; it is unavoidable. Mr. Justice (nRESSwELL.-When I was at the bar, I never took a brief which I couId not attend to. Mr. BOVILL.-Neither do 1. my Lord. Mr. JusticeCnEsWEt.-Well, the course before couteel is very simple. We won't discuss the matter. Go on. The caso for the plaintiff being closed, the defendant and his son were called, but nothing very material was elicited from them, exceptiDg that Goulboum admitted that he would have soldt the pamphlets for 51. or 101. without reference to the plaintiff's interest. MIr. DrMNAz having replied on the whole case, and Mr. BOVILL having made several legal objections to the plaintiff's right to recover, Mr. Justice CRsESSWLL summed up and left two questions to the jury-1. What was the value of the pampfiletg at the timeo of their sale ? to which they replied, after some deliberation, 51. 2. What was their value when demanded by the p)aintiff ?-The jury again deliberated, and replied, 1001. *Tne learned judge then directed the verdict to be en. tered for 51., giving the plaintiff's counsel leave to move to enter a verdict for 1051., and also giving the defendant's counsel leave to move upon the points made by him as to the right of property and possession in the goods claimed by the plaintiff. During the present sittings at Guildhall ample advantage has been taken of the recent Act enabling two judges in each of the three courts to sit at Nisi Prius simultaneously. The number of causes entered has been unprecedented, and vwhenever a puisne judge could be induced to hold a Eecond court his services have been made available. The cDssequence has been that six Courts have sat steadily at Guildhall, and occasionally some of the judges have been at the same time delivering judgments and evenL hearing arguments in Banco at Westminster. The cause list even now, wvhen both judges and counsel are commencing their respective circuits, is scarcely disposed of, and for some days past many cases have been conducted throughout by juniors in the absence of their leaders, and many briefs have passed into hands for which they were not originally intended, the fees remaining, of course, wiith the orloinal holders of the briefs. This state of thingsi cerair not advantageous to the client, for obvious rea- sons. The remedy, as Mr. Justice Cressweli says, is sltmple. . t
COURT OF EXCHEQUR, GumanH. JiuLY 10. AD;AiI 'V. DEirS. uUtngs aZ Noi, Prius, bejore the CMXF BAoRi and a. jqn_, r, I bir if. Theslger, Nr. Knowles, Mr. Field, and Mr. Bell were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Macaulay, Mr. tTdalI and Mr. J. Brown wero counsel for the defendant. The plaintiff is an extensive vendor of groats, and this was an action to recover damrges from the defendant, who is the patentee of an article introduced to supersede the use of pure tinfoil as a wrapper for groats, on the ground that oe the occasion of the sale of the article in question a warranty was given that it was " tinfoil of a good quality and reasonably fit and proper for the purpose for which the plaintiff required it," whereas the quality was so inferior as to damage the groats round which it was wrapped, and almost to ruin the rising connexion of the plantiff. A second count claimed damages on the ground that the sale was effected under a fraudulent representation that the article was tinfoil. The defendant, by his pleas, denied both causes of action as well as their breach. The cause was part beard yesterday, and occupied the whole of to-day(Frida} witnesses having been examined on both sides, both as to the circumstances attendant on the contract and as to the cha. racter of the article sold, and the probable causes to which the complaints of the plaintiff's customers made since his purchases from the defendant might be traced. The evidenoe did not disclose any facts of interest to the general reader. The CnRU BARoN, in summing up, told the jury that in, h:s opinion there was no evidence to suoport the charge of false and fraudulent repreeentation, and that their consi. deration ought to be directed to the questions of warranty, breach, and damages. If there was a warranty, -which would depend upon their adoption of the evidence of the plaintiff or of the defendant's traveller, and a breach of it, then the claim of the plaix.tiff for damages must be con. fined to existing losses, which had been estimated at 3507., and could not be extended to the damuaged reputation of his name in the market and consequent los of connexion. The jury found a verdict for the defendant, disaffnrming the alleged warranty. With this case, which was tbelast in the lEst, the sittings after Trinity Term were brought to a close. We believe that, owing to the industry of the learned Chief Baron and the Barons of the Exchequer, there is not a single rcmanct standing over for next term, either in Banco or Nisi Prius, except where the postponemeub hasbeen sought for by the parties.

He was opposed by Mr. Pittar, for the Birmingham Plate-glass Company, and also for a creditor named Murray. Mr. -3argood bspportbed. The complaint of Mr. MhIrray was that thu insidvent was introduced to him by a mutual friend, and. representing that he wanted 251. to pay his rent, Mr. .irrav was induced to discount a bill for that amount. The Birmriingham Glass Company were creditors for 361. on account of goods supplied shortly before the petition. Mr. PnITAM contended that the insolvent had improperly contracted Mr. Murray's debt by suppressing all mention of his embarrassments. The Cu.YX COBMMSSIONER, however, was of opinion that it was too mush to expect a man to communicate urasked all the facts of his position. The very circumstance of his wanting to borrow money proved that he was a needy man, which might have induced Mr. aMurray to ask what questons he pleased, and had those questions been answered untruly there would then have been good reason for complaint. The insolvent wvas ordered to be disoharged.
SUAMMER ASSIZES. 4x- (^)A1R. (ITRO.TTTql HEETFORD, JULY 11. The Chief Baron arrived at Hertford by the 5 o'clock train on Friday, when it was of course too late for his court to be opened, but this morning both learned judges were engaged in disposing of the remaining causes. (Before fire Ctass BARON and a Comuoaon Truy.) CHAPMAN AND ANOTHER V.. RODWAY. Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. Petersdorff were for the plaintiffs; Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. C. Pollock were counsel for the defendant. The plaintiffs in this action are wine and spirit merchants m London, and the defendant iB a publican and auctioneer at Birmingham. It appeared that a person named Fulton, in the servico of the plaintiffs, had obtained an order for goods from the defendant to the amount of 491., and at the end of siX months, which is the usual period of credit, the plaintiffs applied to the defendant for payment, but he refused to pay on the ground that the arrangement with Felton was that he was to have twelve months' credit. .felton, it appeared, bad died in the interim, and this action was brought to enforce payment before the expiration of the twelvemonth, the period of credit to which the defendant considered he was entitled. Serjeant SuaEE, on behalf of the defendant, said, it was to be regretted that the plaintiffs should have gone to the expense of bringing this action, when he should be able to sattfy the jury in the clearest possible manner that the arrangement made by the defendant with Felton was, that he was to havetwelvemonths' credit. The plaintiffs had been distinctly informed of the fRat, and tbe defendant had expressed his readiness to pay the amount the moment the period of credit had expired, but they persisted in going on with the action. If he proved these facts the defenAdant would be entitled to a verdict, but the plaintiffs had no one to blame butthemselves for the expense and trouble that had been created. Evidence was then adduced which clearly made out the statement of the learned Serjeant, and *r. G. Smith, an attorney of Birmingham, who was at the time concerned for the defendant, proved that when the present action was commenced he made a communication on his behalf to the plaintiffis, and offered to pay the money if the costs of the dfendant were paid and the action discontinued. The CnriF BARON inquired of Mr. Lush whether he thought he could expect a verdict after the evidence that had been given for the defendant, and Mr. LuSHt replied that he was afraid not. The plaintiffs were then nonsuited. GALLIOAN V. BARFORD. This cause was tried by a special jury. Serjeaut Shee, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Leake were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. C. Pollock and Mr. Codd appeared for the defendant. This was an action brought by the plaintiff, a young man named William GaDigan, against the defendant, who carries on an extensive business at St. Alban's as a straw hat and bonnet manufacturer, to recover damages for having caused him to be unlawfuly imprisoned upon two charges-one of stealing a cashbox containing a considerable sum of money, and another of stealing wine. It appeared that the plaintiff wras the son of one of the officers of the Herts constabulary, who was stationed at St. Alban's, but who, it appeared, was pensioned in 1850 and went to live in Ireland. In 1818, the plaintiff, who was then about 14 years old, went into the service of the dakcdant, and he was employed about the warehouse and in the stables, and he remained in the service, except during a short interval, until the month of December of last year, when the occurrence took place which waS the ground of the present action. It seemed that Mr. Barford, who had been a widower had married a second wife, andthat very soon afterwards Le and his wife became mutually jealous of each other, and that this feeling on the part of the latter was carried to such an extent that when her husband was out upon business she used to go after him to watch his proceedings, and the plaintiff, who is a good-looking young fellow, generally accompanied her on these occasions, and, as was observed by the Chief Baron in the course of the case, it appeared that "Mrs. Barford went out to take care of her husband, rrceedmi'LtnW rort of endant, and he ma w.o plaintiff freq"-dy quarrelled, and even resorted occasionally to blows, and it was aleged on the part of the plaintiff that the proceeding of which he complained was an act of spite on the part of the defendant to revenge himself upon GaUigan for taking the side of his wvife intheir matrimonialsquabbles. Thecircumstanceawhich led to the chares being made against the plaintiff appeared to be these :-rn the month of Octobes last a cashbox, containing-ibout 111., was stolen from the defendant's warehouse, and the police were called in, but were unable to detect the thief. No suspicion at this time appeared to be entertained against the plaintiff, and he continued in the defendant's service until the 2d of Deeember, when the defendant suddenly dismissed him. He then, it appeared, went to London to look for another situation, and, upon his returning to St. Alban's on the night of the 10th of December, he was taken into custody by a policeman, upon a warrant obtained by the defendant, under whieh he was charged with stealing the ceashbox that had been lost in October. He was subsequently taken before the bench of magistrates at St. Alban's, when, in addition to the charge of stealing the cashbox, Mr. Barford preferred ."nother against him of stealing wine. This latter charge was dismissed, but the magistrates committed the plaintiff to the sessions for trial upon the eharge of stealing the cashbox, and in due course he was tried and acquitted. The defendant had, however, obtained a true bill against the plaintiff for steaUng the wine, and this indictment was postponed to the ensuing session, the plaintiff during the interval, a period of two months, being in custody; but vhen the session came on no evidence was offered against him upon the indictment for stealing the wine, and he was discharged. In consequence of these proceedings the plaintiff had been put to between 701. or 801. expense, a professional gentleman at St. Alban's, named Annesley, having, it appeared, very kindly taken his caso in hand and made the necessary advances, and the present action was brought to recover damages for the loss and inconvenience the plaintiff had sustained. The plaintiff, who was the principal witness, proved a great many of the above facts, and he denied most positively that there was any foundation for either of the charges that were made against him, or that there was any foundation for the supposition entertained by the defendant that anything improper had taken place between him and his moistress. Be was subjected to a most searching cross-examination by Mr. POLLOCK, and in the course of it it appeared that his wages originally were only 8s. a-week, and that at the time he was dismissed he was receiving only 12s,, and that a sum of 7t. 14s. was found in his box at the time he was apprehended-a good many of the coins being of a similar denomination to those that were in the stolen cashbox. He said that he had saved this money by 3d. and 6d. at a time, and that occasionally he received extra money when he was sent to London with pareels, and that this was also laid by in order that he might bo enabled to go to Ireland to visit his father. He admitted, however, that a very short time before December lie had asked Mrs. Barford to lend him some of his wages in advance, and that he had told two or three persons it St. Alban's, after his dismissal, that he had no money, and that they had given him small sums to help him to get to London to look for another situation. The plaintiff also stated in the course of hls examination that he had been on inttimate terms with a girl named Anne Stone, and that he had given her money, and had also taken her a bottle of wine, which he said he had purchased at the George Inn. It appeared that this girl was examined as a witness against him, and he would not deny that when he saw her at the magistrate's office he said to his attorney, " That - will do for nse." The plaintiff likewise stated that the defendant was not only jealous of him, but of every man who came to the warehouse, and if any commercial travellers came while he was away, and saw his wife upon business, he used to suspect directly that there was something wrong going on, and that he (plaintiff) screened his wife, and said that he was as thick in the mud as they were in the mire. Some other evidence having been given, Mr. PoLtocic submitted that the plaintiff had failed to make out his case, and that the defendant, upon the facts before the Court, had reasonable and probable cause for giing the plaintiff into custody. The CHiv BARON said that, with regard to the cashbox and the money, he thought there was evidence for the jury that the defendant had reasonable grounds for suspecting the plaintiff; but with respect to the charge of stealing the wine he could Eee no evidence whatever to support it. Mr. POLLocK said, the defendant was prepared with evidence upon this point. The CHIEF BARox said, it appeared to him to be a case in which some arrangement might be come to between the parties. Serjeaut SHrEs said, the plaintiff had no other object than to vindicate his character, as it would be impossible for bim to obtain employment while these charges were hanging over him. A consultation then took place between the parties, anudIt was arranged that a verdict should be returned for the plaintiff forl1501., 501. as damages, and the remainder to cover costs. The CmEF'BARox, at the close of the businesi, addressed the special jurors, and said, he was sorry they had been put to the inconvenienee of attending two days without having any business brought before them, in consequence of his not being able to come to Hertford; but the tact was his absence was quite unavoidable. He said that the business in the Court of Exchequer was expected to have been brought to a conclusion on Wednesday or Thursday evening at the latest; but one case lasted two days, and as all the other judges had gone upon their respective circuits he was compelled to remain to finish the business. The last cause did not terminate until four o'olook on Friday afternoon, and ho immediately proceeded to the train, and came down to Hertford to assist in disposing of the business of the circuit. The special jurors thanked his lordship for the explana- tion he had given, and they were then dismissed from further attendance, the business of these assizes having been brought to a termination.
NORTEERN CmRaT. YORE. JULY 10. ':he Vest liding cause list was published to-day, and contains an entry or 37 causeg, 12 of which are marked for special juries. CROWrN CoURT.-(Before iUr. Baron CHANNRLL.) Cyrus Sunderland, aged 49, was charged with having, on the 20th ult., at Morton, embezzled a post letter and Is., the property of Her Majesty's Postmaster GeneraL Mr. uverend, Q.C., and Mr. Seymour were counsel for the Crownl; Mr. Campbell Foster defended the prisoner. The prisoner, itappeared, had been sub-postmasteratEast Morton, near Bingley, and in this capacity it was his duty to convey letters to and from Bingley. Several letters having been missed, especially those directed to places abroad, the prisoner was suspected of having purloined them. In order to test his honesty, on the '20th of June a letter, directed to "Mr. Henry Wilson, tobacconist, 14, Broad. way, New York, America," was written by Mr. Windsor, of the Leeds Post-office, and this was sent by a person named Cowburn o post at Great Morton. The prisoner's wife received the letter, and Is. for the postage. This letter never arrived at Leeds, as it ought to have done, nor was it mentioned in the letter bill, which It was his duty to fill up before going to the Bingley office with letters. In conse. quence of the non-appearance of the letter, Mr. Windsor went over next day, which was Sunday, to East Morton with two policemen. The prisoner was not in at first, but during his absence they fonnd the unstamped letter in question in his every-day coat pocket in his bedroom. When he came in they asked him whether he had not on the previous day received a foreign letter, when he replied that he bad not. He was then cautioned, whereupon he remarked "'Oh, yes, I did; it was an oversight of mine, but I intended to deliver it this afternoon." For the defence, it was contended that an oversight In reality had taken place, as the prisoner might have destroyed the letter itself, and thereby removed the evidence of his guilt; that having forgotten to deliver the letter at the Bingley Post-office on Saturday night, it had not been brought to his recollection next morning froma the ciroumstance of his having changed his dress and left his every-day coat in his bedroom with the letter in the pocket, and in the middle of that day, before it was his duty to go to Bingley again, he had been taken into custody on this Hisa LORDSHIP, having carefully summed up all the facts, The Jury expressed a wish to retire, and after an absence of two hours returned a verdict of .Nbt Guilty. John Atkinson, aged 38, was charged with having sacri legiounsly stolen 70 stone of lead from the parish church of Bridiington. Mr. Blanshard and Mr. Thompson were for the prosecution; the prisoner was undefended. In the month of December last the parish church of Bridlington was undergoing repairs, and the lead in question was laid in rolls inside the edifice. On the night of the 26th of that month the church was broken into by one of the windows, and the lead stolen. The prisoner, a few days afterwards, sold 70 stone of sheet lead for S. to a person at Bridlington named William Wormleighton. A felon named Eyme, who was convicted at the last assizes for highway robbery at Drillield, proved that he and four other persons, including the prisoner, removed the lead which was sold to Wormleighton from the churchyard, to which place it had recently been taken from the church. There was a failure in proving that the prisoner had sacrilegiously entered the church itself and stolen the lead, and his Lordhix held that, under the present indictment, which charged no felonious receiving by the prisoner, the prisoner could not be convicted. Under his Lordship's direction, therefore, the jury AGquilted the prisoner. JohnArmstrong, aliae Eilshaw, 27, was charged with having stolen a mare, value 501., the property of Thomas Lambertw at Sherwood-hall, in the parish of Kellington. Mlr. Blanshard prosecuted, and Mr. Campbell Poster do. It was shown that the mare in question was stolen from a stable at a farmhouse on the night of the 8th of January last year, and the next day the prisoner got her shod at Bramhope, near Otley. The blacksmith being suspicious that the animal had been stolen took the advice of a magistrate, and in consequence he proceeded with the prisoner on the road to Leeds. On their road the blacksmith told his companion that he had better confess he had stolen the mare, when he admitted that he had done so. Theprisoner afterwards took to his heels and escaped, nor was he apprehended till April last, when he was found at Lancaster at his father's, a respectable farmer there. For the defence, it was contended that the lapse of time 17 months, since the occurrence rendered the identification of the prisoner by the witnesses for the prosecution very unsatisfactory, none of them ever having seen him before; and, as there was nothing whatever about the appearance of the prisoner to fix attention, it was very possible he might have been mistaken for some other man, and from his previous charaoter and station in life it was highly improbable that he should have committed such an offence. Eis LoosnnnP having summed up the evidence with great clearness and left to the jury the faots urged for the prisoner, The jury retired, and, after being absent some time, returned vith-a verdict of Guilty. His Lordship In passing sentence on the prisoner said, a very few years ago his life would have been forfeited for the offence he had committed. It was one of a very serious ppbsr _ ne sentence of the Court was that he be im- - - 11th . ~~ hardl labour. TX. CVmL COunvT-(B e; .eiBaron wAaTnvU., His LORtDSU having disposed of two actions of ejetment possessing no public interest proceeded to try crninals. Henry Waller, aged 25, was charged with having on the 20th of March last, at Wombwell cut and wounded Robert Walker, with intent to resist his lawful apprehension. Mr. Maule and the Hon. Mr. Wortley appeared for the prosecution; bIr. Johnstone defended the prisoner. The prosecutor is one of the constabulary force recently organized for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and his station was at Wombwell, near Barnsley. Eis duty was chiefly to go out at night time, and he went out on the night of the 20th of March. When he arrived at Smithley and had entered a croft he heard some sheep in a field belonging to a Mr. Bashforth making a noiso. He observed three men in the field, and they attempted to catch some sheep. They succeeded in taking two, when one of the men said, "Where were they to take them to?' and another replied, "Down to yon corner." They were proceeding down the field with the sheep when the prosecutor called out, " Holloa ! what are you doing there l' He received for answer, " What the - did he want to know forP' Walker divested himself of a portion of his clothing, jumped over the hedge, and went into the field to the men. He observed that one of them was the prisoner, who had a life-preserver in one hand and a carving knife in the other. The prosecutor kmocked the prisoner down, and grappled with the other men. While he was doing so the prisoner went to the assistance of his comrades, but so galant was the officer's conduct that it is probable if the three men had not received other assistance he would have captured them. He knocked them all three down, and as he was trying to handcuff the prisoner he caled out, "Heigh, come up lads." Five men then rushed to the spot, and a very savage attack was made upon him with knives. He was wounded in seven different places on the head; there was also a severe cut on his face two inches and a half long, two of the fingers of his left hand were cut off, and a third was nearly severed, There were other imnuries on his fingers and on other parts of his person. When the men left him they said " There, we have killed the -." This occurred shortly before 12 o'clock. He was enabled to go to the house of Mr. Walton, farmer, whom he knocked up The prosecutor's face was completely covered with bloo1; and e was conveyed home by Mr. Walton in a spring cart. Mr. Alderson, surgeon, of Barnsley, and formerly of York, subsequently attended to the severe injuries the prosecutor had sustained. The prisoner made contradictory statements on being taken into custody, and the defence was that the prosecutor was mistaken in the prisoner's identity; that the latter never wore such clothes as Walker had described him to have had on on the night in question; and that as at that time, the prisoner's right hand was bandaged owing to his having injured it in a fight, it was extremely unlikely that he would engage In such a transaction as was imputed Two witnesses were called for the defence, one of whom was the prisoner's mother, and she stated that her son was not from home on the 20th of Miarch. Mr. MAULE, in reply, submitted that the case against the prisoner had been clearly made out. The jury retired for 25 minutes, and then found the soner Guilty. A previous conviction for felony was then proved against the prisoner, and the sentence was deferred. His LOnDSmP awarded to the prosecutor the sum of twenty guineas for his very gallant conduct, and expressed a hope that the magistrates would provide him with a permanent situation, the duties of which he would be able to discharge, as some compensation for his injuries, with respect to which the Court had no power to give him any reward. JULY IL CVmL COURT.-(Before Mr. Baron WATSON.) MAKTEN V. REMP AND HODGSON. This was an action of slander, arising out of the late Beverley election. Mr. Edward James. Q.c., and Mr. Seymour appeared for the Plaintiff; Mr. Hill, Q.C., and Mr. CleasDy for the defendant. It appeared from the opening speech of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that at the late Beverley election there was a contest between Mr. Denison, Mr. Glover, and Mr. Wells, and that in the course of that contest, one party having contendea that Wr. Glover was not a fit and proper person to represent the borough of Beverley telegraphedto the plaintiff, a member of the bar,and the editor of the Sun nev,paper, who -was supposed to know a good deal aboat Mr. Glover's antecedents. The plaintiff accordingly went down to Beverley on the eve of the nomination and out oat a placard representing Mr. Glover not to be a fit and proper person to represent Beverley, and calling a public meeting of the electors, at which he challenged Mr. Glover to be present. A deputation then waited upon Mr. Mfartin and heard what he had to say against Mr. Glover, and asked forhis proofs, which it appeared in his hurry on leaving London he had not brought with him. There was a considerable disturbance' MrW Martin's statements were not well received, and Mr. Giover declined to meet him. The election resulted in the return of Mr. Denison and Mr. Glover as members for the borough, and Mr. Wells the defeated candidate, then got up a petition against Mr. Glover's return, on the groLud that he had no quallfica. tion. On the 27th of May, the electors and sup. porters of Mr. Glover held a meeting at the Norwood Rooms, Beverley, to consider what steps should be taken relating to this petition, and the defendant, Mr. Hodgson, then made a speech in which he describedhis interview, along with others, with Mr. Martin before the election, to whom he attributed the real authorship of this ,netition. He said he found aman of 6 ft. 2in., dressed in a-habby black coat, who was said to be the editor of the Sunnewspaper; that "he neverzsawamorecon'emptible. looking wretch. HIe looked like a felon in the dock about to receive sentence cf death, and he was sorry to see a rerpectable attorney of Hull in such bad company." Speaking of the petition and the statements it contained regarding Ir. Glover he said, "he did not see who could have made such statements except that man Martin, who, If he had his deserts, ought to have been sent beyond the seas long ago." This was the slander complained of. The words were proved by one George Dunning, a chymist's apprentice at Yarmouth, who chanced to be at Beverley, who for bis own amusement took a note of what was said for the purpose of writing a report for a Beverley paper. This was the plaintff's case. Mr. Hi.L submitted that there was no case, as there was no evidence that the Mr. fartin spoken of was the plaintiff He also objected that the words spoken were not actionable, unless spoken of some act for which the law imposed the penalty of transportation. His LoRDsmP overruled the first objection, and was of opinion that the words were not actionable, and would either give the defendant leave to move, if the case went to the jury and were decided against him, or direct a nonsuit as Mr. James should elect. Mr. J,ms elected to go to the jury, and, in summing up contended that the words were used in the sense imputed and inferred the commission of an offence which woubd sub ject the plaintiff to the penalties of transportation, and that they were of themselves most injurious and such as called for heavy damages. Mr. Ems, for the defendant, said, as a matter of tadte he did not attempt to justi'y the language used; but it was mere language of abuse. The defendant had never imputed anything like a felony to the plaintiff deserving the punish. ment described. The plaintiffhad come there to set himself right before the public and to clear away the imputations cast upon him, and yet he durst not go into the witness.box and subject himself to cross-examinations as to his past life and as tothe reasons which induced him-a stranger-to iuterfere in the affairs of the people of Beverley, with which he had nothing to do. His LoRDSHIrP in summing up directed the jury that in point of law any words of mere general abuse, however. harsh, uttered by one person against another, were not actionable, unless they imputed to a person that he had been guilty of au offence which subjected him to scanal7ous punishment. The question was whether the words im.' puted to lIr. Matin au offence so punishable by the law;if not they were ,uot actionable n h uysolin o the defendant. l,adtejr hudfn o The jury, after a short condderation, found a verdict for the defendant. MAiRTIn V. iMP AND ANOTHB. This was an action of libel brought by the same plaintiff against the defendants a the publishers of the Beverky Obmemve,l for publishing the speech of M. Hodgson ana makdain comments thereon in the Becerley Obse-er of the 30th of MWay last. The same learned counsel appeared as In the former case. For the plaintiff the publication of the speech was proved, and the statements in the petition of Mr. Wells were in a leading article alleged to bo founded " on the rubbish of the notorious Martin.' Mr- Thorney, solicitor, of Hul, was then called, and he proved that the plaintiff was a member ofthe bar,and he had been induced to join the deputation which waited upon him at Beverley from curiosity. On being cross-examined the witness said, Mr. Martin then stated he had been engaged in bill transactions with Mr. Glover 13 years ago, and that Mr. Glover gave him b'lls and securities which were worthless. He said that Mr. Glover had been discharged from his debts under the Insolvent Debtors Act in Ireland, and that he had also himself been through that court. Some of those present told him they could not take his word without proof, and he said he had left the proofs behind him. His LoRisMP.-Was Glover the Conservative candi. date?7 Witness.-I cannot tell what he was. Mr. Wells was a Liberal. The plaintiff said he had come down to oppose Mr. Glover's election because he thought he was not a proper person torepresent the place; and he wouldchalienge Mr. Glover to meet him face to face. Re-examined.-The plaintiff said, that it was In conse. quence of his connexion with Mr. Glover in these biil trans. aetions that he had been obliged to go through the Insolvent Court. M1r. Richard M1artin, the plaintiff, was then called and examined.-He said he was a member of the English bar, and on the Northern Circuit. He was called to the English bar in January, I851, and was practising at the Irish bar six years before that. The last year of his practice at the rish bar he made 1,4001. He became counected with Mr. Glover in bill transactions, of which Mr. Gloverhadthe benefit, and he was in consequence involved to a very large extent, and had paid on their account ovcr 8001. Mr. Glover took the benefit of the Insolvent Act in 1849, and witness was in. volved when he left Ireland and continued so till he was obliged to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act in this country in 1855, and again in March last owin to the same transactions, from renewing old debts and his expenses in going through the court. He was applied toto go down to Beverley by a solicitor in the Temple on the 25th of March last, the Wednesday previous to the election He heard of this at 5 p.m., and went down by the mall that night and had not time to collect his various papers. He stepped at Beverley at the Holderness Hotel, and wrote to MIr. (lover's Committee shortly after his arrival. He stated that he had come down from London for the purpose of showing that Mr. Glover was not a proper person to represent the town of Beverley, and that he wished not to this behind Mr. Glover's back, but before his face. ie published a handbill to that effect. After that a number of gentlemen waited unon him-Mr. Sylvester, Mr. Hodgson, hr. Gilby, and some others. A handbil was shown to him which he was asked if he came to support, and he said he ezsew__i,othiuz Abut that handbill; but he said ments in it ate true, I do believei a re& - of these charges, but I don't come to substantiate them, and of course as being an insolvent debtor he cannot be qulified to hold a seat in Parliament." He (witness) had only one paper with him, which he produced. It was an unstamped deed, and he then had it with him there. It was a deed executed by Mr. Glover, purporting to convey a certain estate in Ireland to witness in consideratlon of advances he had made to him, and on investigating the title witness found it to be utterly worthless, and that he could not get a shilling advanced upon it, and the deed was not, therefore, worth stamping. His LoRDIsHip.-Am I trying the Beverley election? This evidence might be very proper before an election committee. Examination continued.-In February, 1846, witness be. came editor of theSunmewspaper, and had continued so ever Oross-examined.-Mr. Young was the proprietor. He had published a handbill on his going to Beverley, inviting the constituency to meet him at the Mechanics Institute. A deputation came to him to his hotel, and asked him various questions about Mr. Glover's discharge under the Insolvent Act, and he had told them that he had been twice dis. charged under the Act himself. He challenged Mr. Glover to meet him. He went down in consequence of a threat he had made to hir. Glover that he would meet him face to face on any hustings he dared to appear on. He went down because he believed Mr. Glover not to be a proper person to represent Beverley, and because he had obtained his (witness's) money by false pretences and false Eecurities. His LoRDnsuP.-Take care, take care; you may have an action against you, Witness.-I wil bear all the consequences, my lord. And I also went down because he sent me a very insulting letter when I was in the Queen's Bench and I could not answer. (The handbill referred to was here put in, sating that 3M. Glover had declined to meet witness, and that he scarcely exhibited the pluck that his supporters boasted vvfiis was the plaintiffs case. Mr. JAas then summed up, calling on the jury to give hisclientsubstantialdamages for the gross lbel the defendants had published regarding him. He had placed the plaintiff in the box, and h learned friend was no longer able to say he feared to meet any cross-examination to which he might be subjected. The libel was one calculated to bring the plaintiff into contempt, and was of a kind from which the plaintiff had a riAh to be protected. Mr. HILL, for the defendants, contended that this was not a private controversy between Glover and Martin, but a public controversy relating to the election for Beverley, respecting which the defendants had a right to comment, and that the observations made on the public statements of the.plaintiff at Beverleywere bond Jide comments, made by the defendants as public journalists. It was a question for the jury whether under the circumstances the alleged libel was one calculated to degrade the plaintif. If the comments were fairly made on the plaintiff as a public man the defendants were not liable In damages. His LoRDsPnr left it to the jury to say whether the words published had gone beyond the limits of legitimate observations on the incidents of a contested election, Mr. Martin having gone down a stranger to Beverley and pre. ferred the charges he had done against one of the candidates. If the observations had, in their opinion, gone too far, they must find for the plaintiff, with such damages as they thought the case required. The jury retired, and in about an hour returned with a verdict for the plaintiff-damages one farthing.

His Lordehip attended Divine service in the churoh this morning, and at 11 o'clock proceeded to c4arge the grand jury. Two bills only were presented-one against a woman for the wilful murder of her child, and a second for conceallng its birth. The grand jury Ignored the former, finding the latter a tree bill. 31ary Earrisson, a young woman of about 25, was then arraigned npon the coroner's inquisitienl for wlful murder. Mr. Roberts appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Coclde for the defence. Mr. RoBERTs stated that, as the grand jury had ignored the bill for murder, he should offer no evidence upon the coroner's inquisition. MTr. Justice Enz then directed an Acquiul upon the charge of murder, and sentenced the prisoner to nine months' imprisonmnent upon the indictment for concealment, to which the prisoner had pleaded '!' Guilty." The business of the assizes terminated at about 1 NORTHAMPTON, JuLY12.

CENTRAL CRATINAL COURT. .Tdh 11- NEW CnTRT (Before ae RECORDZR) William Burgess, the proprietor of a manure mann. factory, at Bermondsey, surrendered to take his trial uponanindictment charging him with having created a nuisance. The indictment contalned three counts, the first charging the defendant with having erected a certain copper for the boiling of bones, thereby creating a nuisance dangerous to health; secondly, with continuing to use the sad copper; and the third count set forth that he, the defendant, *cou. mulated upon the said premises, and allowed to remain,. bones, hide pieces, and other offal. Mfr. Serjeant Parry, with whom were Mr. Sleigh and 3r. Sharpe apeared to su rt the prosecution, which had been. instituted by the parish authorities of Bermondsey- and Mr. Montagu Chambers. Xr. Serjeaut BaUantine, and Mr. Metcalfe were for the defendant. Thecas, wbich commenced upon Thursday and did not close late upon Saturday evening, was this:-The defendant, a gentlemanof considerable chymicalsldl, in 1855 became the owner of a large plot of ground, now the centre of a rapidl Arsing neighbourhood, situated in the Blue Anchor-road, rmondsey, closely adjoining the South3astern Railway, where he commenced the manaufacture of manure from bones, the insides of horses, trimmings of raw hides, and other offal To effect this the bones and offal were boiled and subsequently mixed with sulphuric acid and gas refuse, a quantity of which used also to be allowed to accumulate uponx the premises. The result of this was that from time to time the most noxious smels were engendered, and, according to the evidence of a great number of witnesses, sickness, loss of appetite, and general ill-health were suffered b those living an the immediate vicinity of the defendants premises; and one witness, a sailor, said that the smell was so bad that he went nearly a mile away to eat his dinner. Other witnesses deposed to seeing cartloads of bones and offal in a stinking state come into the premises, and that the bones were upon one occasion seen in a pile 30 feet high, and that even the trees and vegetation in the neighbourhood suffered. Sometimes tbe smells wereworse than at others, but it was admitted by all the witnesses that lately the nuisance had not been so bad, The neighbourh and place had been inspected by Drs. Alds and Challis, the latter of whom paidt a visit during the night, and found the smell very bad. For the defence a great many witnesses were examined, nearly all of whom stated that the accounts given by the rosecution were much e erated, and their examinaston y estabashed a fact, pat y adimitted by the counsel for the urosecution, namely, that In the immediate vicinity a number of other trades were carrie4 on which caused the most noxious smells. The REwORDE6x in summing up, which he did at great length, going through nearly all the evidence, told the jury that the fact of other nuisances existing close to the defendants did not render him the less liable. The jury, having been some time looked up, found a verdict of Guilty upon the third count. The defendant was then ordered to enter into his own recognances to come up when called upon, with an nuderstan g! tlhat if the nuisance complained of was abated the Court would not be reuird to give judgment.
.MIDDLESEX SESSIONS Stur&ty, Ju2y 1L (Bsfore Mr. PASMXy, Q.C., As.i ta t.Judge-) John Chesoo, 30, was indicted for unlawfully and indecentlz assaulting a girl mamed Margaret Curley. M1r. ;sleigh appeared for the prosecution, instructed by E- Shaen; iMr. Cooper, by Messrs. Humphreys, for the pnsoner. The prosecutrix, a girl 14 years of age, was servant in the prisones honse, No. 2, Rheldol-terrace, Islington, where he carried on the business of an artificial florist. and had a number of young girls in hu employment. The case for the prosecution, and wThich was clearly made out upon the evidence of the girl, was, that one night, when excited by drink, the prisoner left his wife's bedroom, and went to the kitchen, wvhere the girl was sleeping, and commnitted the assault charged in the first count. Next morning the girl, told Mrs. Chescoe what had occurred, and she told prisoner of it in her presencoe. Be said he was drunk and knew nothingaboutit. Theprosecutrix then informod herfather and mother, and they caused the prisoner to be apprehended. He then made a scarcely intelligible statement, partly ad. mitting some misconduct. The prosecutrix was subjected to a severe cross-examination, but she gave her answers withont the least hesitation, and gave minute details of the i offence. A medical gentleman gave evidence, from which it appeared that a more serious offence than an assault had not been committed. Mfr. CoOPrM, for the defenee, urged that the girl was utterly unworthy of belief, and that her flippant and imn modest manner in the box, and her evident familiarity with such detils, as exhibited in her answers, would justif the jury in coming to the conclusion that there was no foundation for the charge. Two witnesses, speaking from a knowledge of the prisoner for a number of years, gave him a high character for morality and PrOpriety of conduct. The AssIstArJrj told the jury that the only ques. tion in the case was, did they or did they not beliove the girl's evidence? The jury at once retmrned a verdict of Guilty upon all the counts. At the rising of the Court the prisoner was brought up and sentenced to 18 months' hard labour. .illiam Bristow, 38, labourer, and John Hamilton, 52, r Culstoms weighert were indicted for having stolen a haln, the property of William Robinson. This was a case postponed frqm last 4sion. Hamilton now surrendered in court. Mkr. Bleigl, Instrueted bylr ogo>SfsetBristow pleaded " Guilty." It appeared that the prisoner Bristow took a ham from a ship in the East and West India Docks, and a portion of it was found upon his person as he was about to leave. When questioned he said a ship's steward had given it to him, but ultimately he admitted having stolen it, and made a statement implicating the prisoner Hlamilton, who at that time was acting *s searcher's cooper, as receiver of part of the ham. Hamilton at once admitted that he had received a piece of ham from the prisoner, who told him it had been given to him by a steward. Eamilton had been in the service of the Crown altogether about 40 years, and several Customs officers of higher rank than himself were called to give evidence of his having borne an unblemished character up to the present time. The jury interrupted the Assistant-udge in his summing up, and said they were satisfied there was no case whatever against Hamilton, whom they accordingly Acquitted. Bristow was sentenced to nme months' hard labour. (BCforC Mr. CiXAsY.) William Vincent, 26, was indicted for having stolen a watch and chain, value 101., the property of Thomas Gil bert. He surrendered. Mr. Poland was for the prosecution, MEr. Ribton for the prisoner. The prosecutor stated that he was a commercial traveller, residing at 37, Stockwell-park.road, and on the 19th of Mtay he was accosted at Charing-cross by the prisoner, who asked him the way to the Horae Guards. He directed him, and stepped on, but the prisoner forced a conversation upon him, and ultimately, upon an invitation to take some refreshment, he accompanied him to a publichouse. They went into the parlour, and in a minute or so the nrlsoner went out and was away some time, but witness waited for himas he had left his stick, and on his return they had a bottle of lemonade and a glass of ale. They then went to the Horse Guards, and on seeing the clock the prisoner said he was too late for his business that day, and they might as well, therefore, go and have some morerefroshment. Accordingly they went into another publichouse, and the prisoner went out as before, and when he came back he said there was a better house further on. They then went to a house at Millbank, where, on going into the par. lour, they found a gentleman, and in a short time a person dLressed as a farmer boiDed them. They talked about testing the qualityef a glassof ale by sugar, and the farmer said ir ale was not good sugar would "resolve" in it. The prisoner said he had used a wrong word, It should be iI dissolvo." The "farmer" said he was sure he was right, for he had heard the parson's clerk of his parish say o0using a broad country dialect. W7itness suggested that Jo.nToh's Dictionariy should be appealed to to decide the question, and the " gentleman" who was in the room when thiey first went in said he would go and get one, and left. The farmer then showed something wbich he said were bank-notes, and said he would bet 10 guineas that "resolve" was the right word to Use. The Prisoner Said he had only II., and asked witness to lend him his watch and chain to stake against the 10 guineas, but he refused, saying that the watoh had belongedto his father, whowas dead. The gentleman came back with a book, which he said was a dictionary, and they all then agreed to bet. Witness staked his watch and chain against the farmer's 10 guineas, and the prisoner made a bet that it was "- dissolve." The book was handed to the farmer, who looked into it and said that the de6inition given of " reEolve"' waa "to melt-to analyze," andthereupon he claimed forfeit of Lie watch and chain. Witness wanted to see the book, to look for the word " dissolve," hut they refused to let him, saying the bet was decided, and the prisoner took the watch and handed it, with the chain, to the farmer. The prisoner said he would give a bill to the farmer for the amount, so as to get the watch and chain back, and he asked witness to go with him to get a bill stamp. They went out together, andprisonersentfhim into a shop for a stamp, saying he would wait for him at the corner of tho street. While he was inthe shop the prisoner gave him " the sp ," and when he went back to the publichouse the "farmer" and the "gentleman" were not to be found. On the 18th of June he saw the prisoner in Westminster.road, and gave himn in charge. The prisoner whispered to him that he had pledged the watch and chain, and would give him back the property if he would not lock him up; but witness, whe seemed to have profited by his expoerience, persistedin charg- I inR him, and he was taken to the stationhouse. The counsel for the prosecution opened the case as one of con spiracy on the part of the prisoner and his friends, the supposed " farmer" and "gentleman," to rob the prosecutor. The policeman who took tho prisoner into cnstody said he heard him offer to restore the watch and chain if the prosecutor would withdraw the charge. He told him he could not allow it to be settled in that way, and took him to the station. lbr. RnTox addressed the jury, contending that "the farmer)" was a cunning rogue who had swindled all the others. The jary found the prisoner Guilty. lbr. CBEAsy sentenced him to six mon&ths hard labour. James Catting middle-aged man, was indicted for hsving exposed his person in the Regent's Park. He surrendered. Mr. Poland was for the prosecution, which was instituted by the Board of Works; Mr. Ribtcn was for the prisoner, instructed by 3E. Herring,. The jury found the prisoner Guilty on the first count, and Mr. CREASE sentence4 him to one year's hard labour.

After some time the parties with the garrison observed the movements of the enemy, and preparations were immediately made for driving the irem their works. A sortie was first made from the garrison, led on by Lieut. L. G. Thorold, i :.e and on issuing from the fortifications those engaged feUl an with the advanced pickets. A skirmish ensued which lasted some time, until the party from tbe Spur Battery felt it necessary to retreat. On retiring they burnt fire balls to indicate to those within the works their posithon, and when t a distnce of abont 200 yards from the garrson a number of blue lights were eentoded, to enable those Inside to directtheir fire. As scon as the party msking the sortie had reached the garrison the whole line of defence was instantaneously illum=ated from one extreme to the other with large blue lhts.

OY.Al VICTORIA PATRIOTIC ASYLU1. Attieo time when the fierce struggle in the Crimp' 'ht its keight, and each despatch bore tidings hor- f at aldedx achieved and misorable ruirerisigs u I- -of gre the Fatriote Fund 0-ergane by our stheatrioti Funa sabscriptiso' was opened. The 'asid of the nation was divided by r 0o1ficting emotions. it 'aa hard to say whether adsi?aeioa for the bravery of its sBon tr indignation at the cruel lSmisnkaagenent which was leaving bthousands of them to perish predominated. Both feelings 'wero strong, but both fortk'oately found ample vent in eontbibutiton3 to the fund-. rora the efforts of individuals it spread rapidly through cities, towns, and viages. one1 -teemed too poor to contribute, and even little hamlets tiU ihen unheard of sent in their mite to the general stock, for 'the feeling of kind enthusiasm throughout the land 'wss deep and genuine. Nor did it rest here'The vcolcies raliead round the mother oountry vwith cordial sympathy cad welcome proffers of sstarce.; and ,ono of the -nost gratifying features of %e fun2 was the noble eiaulatioca evinced by our dependendes iu flying to tire a1dof Old England. In every Vuarter of the globo, emong nations the most dissiniilar to our owwn in origir, language, and, religion, the Patriotfn Fund wes hailed with 'enthusiaso. In India a large suam was raised, and C"xada aloiie gave upwards of 20,0001. go, in the space of a few shovt moaths noles -ihan 1,509;0001. ster;ng was coicted -tho lr=gest sunm that during any period has aver been taisedf,or purolycbaritable parposes. Almost the whole of this aumount has been bestowed, aSl its donos intended, in relieving the sufferings and providing for the wants of the widows and orphans of the soldiers, cellors, and rmarines who fell in the late war. By a special deoision of 'tke Royal Commissioners the widows of such -officers as stood most in need of its assistanee were also aided with grants from the fund. The distribution was of course a work of time, b;ut -at length the great load of misery wes reduced, the last bereaved applicant was relieved, and the coammissioners found thoy had stiUl a surplus of nearly 200,0001. in hand. A meeting of the executive and finance committee was held, ar,d it was dotermiined to apply this sam to the erection and endowment of an asylum for 300 orphan daughters of soldiors, sailors, and marines, "' for the perpetual consolation and encouragement of those who hereafter may die for their country." 38,0001. was set aside forthe purchase of the site and erection of the building, and 140,;001. for Its perpetual endowment. it was to do honour to this noble memnorial of the late war, and rs a marked testimony of her appreciation of the valour and fortitude of those who were its victims, that Hler Mlajesty laid the foundation stone of the asylum on Saturday with all tho stato and ceremonial which befitted tho interest of the occasion. The site for the new building has been chosen on tho edge of Wandsworth-common, close by the Tooting road. It is an elevated situation on a light, sandy soil. In making the choice tho commissioners were wisely guided only by sanitary considerations. The building is to be erected after the desiga of the well-known Heriot's Hospital, at Edinburgh, omitting some of the ornamental details, to carry out which it was found would absorb too largo an a:enoura of the surplus at the dispoaal of the commissioners. A large number of tickets wore essued to visitors anxious to witness the coremonial on Saturday, which was fixed to ecrsmence at 5 o'clock. Yot, notwithstanding this arrangement, the cards were endorsed with the absurd request that visitors should be in their seats by half-past 3 at latest. We presume this intimation did not quite meet tho views of those who intended to be present at the proceedings, for the arrivals after half-past 3 were few and far between, and the three blocks of seats erected for the occasion were not more than one-third full. Thoso who wero in their places by the appointed hour had at best a dull time of it, and aU their loyal fortitude and patience were required to enable thens to sit it out. There was nothing to look at, save tho ponderous block of stone, which must be lithographed upan tho memory of aU early visitors, and which, in spite of the important part it was to play in the day's proceedings, was not exactly calculated to excite a sustained interest or repay any one for looking at it more thati once. Beyond this were the remains of a mill which had survived the stago of ruin belonging to the picturesque, and wias now merely an unsightly obstacle. These two ;works of art, with the pushing and eager hurry of the mob railed off from the sceno of action, were the only things which visitors had to contemplate for a weary length of time. 100 orphan boys (50 from the Duke of York's School ard 50 from Greenwvich School) and 100 girls (50 from the Sailors' Orphar Girls' Home and 50 from the Soldiers Infant Hlome) were placed in a line along the enclosed apace within the platforms. The cleanly aspeot of these children, with their ruddy faces beaming with health, made them real objects of interest and general commendation. The Duke of York's band, too, was there, the mimic drummajor at its head, with his staff of office, a little taUer and apparently very little lighter +1,^- '- d- -'5d oan Guard of Moonour came upon the ground, and at 4 the members of the Executive Committee and State officials began to assemble, aU in full uniform and lev6o dress. A marquee was pro. moted to tho honour of a Royal pavilion for that day only, and by the tine fixed for the arrival of Hor Majesty a bri21iant group was gatliered before it. Precisely at 5 the field-battery, stationed at a shorb distance on the Common, announced tho arrival of Her Majesty. and as tho last guns -were fired the Roy al corlige, escorted by a detachment of the 1l1th Ilossars, drove up. In the carriage with tho Qaeen were the Prince Consort and tho Prince of Prussia. The former wore the uniform of a Field-Marshal and the riband of tho Garter, the latter the uniform of his Prassian Rlegiment, vith the riband and insignia of the Black Eagle. The uext carxiage contained the Princess Charlotte of Belgium, the Princess Royal, Princess AUce, and Princo Alfred. Fivo carriages conveyed the suite, all of whom wore their State uniforms and badges of office. Immediately on alighting at the pavilion tho procession was formedl in the following ordor:- The Architect. The k3eeretary. The Executive and Ficasco Coenmittee (Two and TwO). The itoyal CJommissloners ITwo aud Two). The Chaplain to tho Archbishop of Cantorbury. The Archbishop of C:anterbury. The Bialsop of Winchestor. The Lord Steward ol Her Majesty's The Lord lHousehold.

Among tho members of the Rtoyal Coosmission and' in the suite in attendance upon the Sovereign were the Duke of Newcastle, the Dake of Wellington, the Marquis of Breadalbane, Earl Spencer, Viscount Torrington, Lord Byron, General Sir F. Stovin, the Marquis of Abercorn, Count XB1tko, Lord St. Leonard's, Lord Brooko, the Earl of HIardvicko, Lord Redesdale, Sir George Grey, General Sir Hlow Loss, Ur. Sidney Herbert, Sir John Pakington, Colonel Vilson Patten, the Lord Mayor, &c. On arriving at the stone the Royal Commissioners and the Executive and Financo Committee moved to the right and left of the platform, and the Prince Consort, as chairman of the latter body, read the following address to the Queen:- " Ve, your Majesty's most lutifnl subjects, the Comamlaioners appoiuted by yrur lljesty for tho eormatonn and appScation of a Pa triotic Fund, approach your lajesty with the assurance of our devoted loyalty and affectionate attachlseut toyoer Majesty's throne and par- onu, and with the expres3sol of oer gratitude for your Majesty's con. descensien in honouring by Your Dresenae aRd patrosage the foundlation of this6 bulildg, inter(led for tisa reception and educatSon of the orphan daughters of thoe soldiers, seamen, and marines who have falen In thbo lte war with ResiEa. and of thoes who may hereafter lose the!r liv a in the s8rvi"e of their country.

"I gladly avail myneef of this occasion to express the greaM satisfaction I have derived from the gratifying evidence presented to me of the manner in which my faithful sabject3 through-ut the whole extent of my dominions, and in the most Wistant parts of the world, have evinced their geniuine sympAthywith my own feelings of admirationfortho eglant conduct andendnringfortitnde of my naval and military 'forces. by their munificent contributions to t'Ao funds l?or the relief of the widows and orphans of the brave mnen who have fallen in the diseharge of their duty to their Sovereign and their country. You have fully justified the confidence plaaed in you by your judicious andimpartial distribution of these funds, and I entirdy approve the appropriation of aportion of them to the erection and permanent endowment of an institution in the success of which I shall ever feel the warmest interest. "I am most happy to take a part in the foundation of this institution, and I heartily concur with you in committing it tc the Dlvine care and protection, and in praying that the benevolent objects with which it has been designed may be to the fallest extent accomplished."' His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury then having offered up a prayer suitable to the occasion, preparations were made for lowering the stone into the spot on which we trust it may remain for centuries to come. As usual on such occasions the great mass of granite was first hoisted up and swung on one side, but on Saturday this led to an amusiDng error in the formality of the ceremonial, for as the huge stone was slowly raised the crowd in the front caught the first sight of the Quecn, and, of course, began cheering lustily. The bands stationed in the rear thought the cheers announced the conclusion of tho ceremony and commenced the National Anthem, which in turn deceived the field battery stationed out npon the common, and the gunners fired the saluto, which should, according to the programme, have terminated the proceedings. Thus all the honours intended for the laying of the stone were rendered while the obstinate-looking block still swung in mid air. When the salute was over Her Majesty deposited in the aperturo under the stone the glass tube, contain£ng specimens of each coin of the realm, and a splendidly engrossed vellum, with an inscription of the date and circumstances under which it was laid. The stone was tben slowly lowered into its place, Her Majesty tested its correctness of position with the plumb and level, and, giving it three blows with a polished mallet, declared it well and truly fixed. On a brass plate fixed into the face of the stone, and placed so as to be read on the exterior of the building, is the following inscription:- " On the 11th day of July, 1857, In tho second year of peace, Qaeen YhVctorla dedicsted this asylum, erected from a portion of the free gifts of the United Kingdom, ot the BlatIeh Colonies, and the Indian Empire, and ofsmaynoye ubjectsof the realm, to tho nusture sad ednoation of the orphan daughters of tbose brave mev who perished In the Russian war, and for the perpetl consolation anId enconragement of thoeo who hereafter may die for their countryy. The trowel, according to custom on these occadons, was presented to Her Majesty. It was, of course, a sagnificent implement, not by any meaus like a trowel, or anything relating to a bricklaying tool, but rather like a piece .E antique family plate. In the centre of its sorollwork was engraved,- " This trowel was presented to Queen Viotoria by the Royal Com_ mlsrloners of the Patriotic Fund, on the occasion of Her MEajesty Iay log the foundation stone of an seylumn for the education and training of 300 orphan daughters of soldiers, seamen, and marines. who perlshod in the tussiau war, and for those who hereafter may zequire like succollr., On returning to the pavilion two inscriptions were submitted to Her Majesty, of both of which she was graciously pleased to express her approvaL They will bo out in stone on the outside of the edifico, one in Latin and one in English. The former is- "No quas patermi consilli EOt tutelr orbas Ieliquit morm patrum prnmatusa Juvontute ineulta languerent Miabus Bene do patria meritorum Nune et in perpetum Auxietate provida Hrac In reds Perfuginom dearevit Cus colonils as apud Indos imperlo Extaris etiam no0 parne conferentiboo Britaunna - The Tnglish one will be as follows " For the Orphan DDaghturs Ot the Boldieis,Seamen, and NMarines Of the reabm, Now ax e nrth.

THB LATR MR- DUraLAS JERROLD. Never, probably, lia any age did private theatrical per. formances attain usuh a higgh degree of celebrity as those that took pla iasb winter at Tavistock.house, the residence of MIr. Ctirles D;ckens. None were admitted to witness them, save the friends of the amateur manager, but E0 rAde is his circle of acquaintance, and so great is the Social inRuence held by many of the persons of whom it is composed, that the marits of the " Tavistsok-house Theatrisss" soon beome celebrated thronghout the whole literary and arSistio world of London. The number who ctually sar the performances did not, mosb likely, exceed 500, btt raost of them were not only talking men, bat nien whose talk is sure to find listeners, and hence the fact that Mr. Charles Dickens was an actor of a far higher kind than had been demonstrated by his earlier amateur performances was one of the best affirmed facts of the day. Under these circumstances it was but natural that when, ott Saturday night, the " Tavistockl' performances took place before such of the public as chose to visit -the "Gallery of Illustratioa " for the benefit of the fund lin remembrance of the late Mr. Douglas Jerrold," the long room was crowded to repletion. The Gallery, it wiU be remembered, is not in the shape of a theatre, but is an oblong room, the length of which far exceeds its breadth and hence the interminable series of heads presen'sed a curions aspect to a spectator in the vicinity of the stage. An audience which is selec' as well as numerous, and the humblest constituents of which pay 59. for their places is not apt to indulge in those noisy demonstrations of delight that are so freely given by the mixed assemblage of an ordinary theatre. But never was there a feeling of deeper and more genuine admiration than was left by ir. Charles Dickens in the minds of his auditors at the conclasion of Mr. Willde Collins's drama the Frozen Deep. There was literally a gasp of applause when the curtain descended, and the conversation that ensnedduring the intervalthat pre.. cededthe farcewascomposed ofalaudatory criticismofdetails.- To gain the cool, deliberate approbation of such an audience was no small triumph. The ringleaders of conversabion on such occasions are men who, to use a common phrase, are "up to everything," especiallyin matters connected with pablic amusement,e and whose organ of veneration is by no means largely developed. They would rather grasp an opportunity for quizzing the ridiculous than seize an oeca. sion for admiring the sublime. ,When such as these not only murmur forth their admiration, but, discuss the causes of it, who among an audieneo could raise a dissentient voice ? The performance of Mr. 3)ickens as the vindictive and (afterwards) penitent Richard Wardour is, in tne truest senss of the word, a creation. Nay, -we may go farther and say that it is the creation of a literary man-that it is doubtful whether any mere actor, unless under the influence of some extraordinary sympathy with the part assumed, would attempt to fill up an outline with that elaborate detail thst is introduced by Mr. Dickens into Mr. Collins's sketch. We feel that if Mr. Dickens had had to describe in narrativa form the situations of the Frozen Decp, instead of acting them, he would have covered whole pages in recording those manifestations of emotlon, which, not having his pen in his hand, he now makes by the minutest variations of voice and gesture. Where an ordinary artist would look for "points" of effect he looks for "points" of truth. A speoimen of humanity in which every twitch of every muscle can be accounted for is to bs presented with all the elaboration of actual nature, no matter whether it be admired or not. When Richard Wardour tells the story of his disappointment in love theie is ample opportunity for much noisy grief and many a stride to the footlights, but Mr. Dickens dares to keep down his voice through the whole of the narrative. The effect may be monotonous,-bat what of that? He who talks not for the sake of display, bub simply that he may relieve his mind from an oppressive and almost humiliating burden, will necessarily be monotonous. A man louder under the sense of wrong would have excited less uneasiness in his confidant. But such a man as Mr. Dickens presents-a maan strong in the command of his voice, but weak in suppressing the languLage of his eyes and facial muscles-a man whose constant attempts to hide the internal storm by slight siau. lations of good fellowship only renders more conspicuous the vastness of that which he would conceal-a man whe has a habit of losing his temper in a manner that mere external circumstances do not warrant-such a man is a jutst object of terror. Richard Wardour, as depicted by Mr. Dickens in the second act of the Frozen Dee.p, is the most perfect representation of dogged vindictiveness that the imagination could conceive. In the third act so iatricate is the web of emotions that he unfolds that in a verbal description no more than an indication of the varions threads that compose it can be attempted. Richard Wardour and the object of his hate have departed together on an excursion during their sojourn in the Arctic Regions, and when the " expedition" pea ogAetior antl?s aupposea enex7 'oAne sfs--nm~i.aJSL5 the othor. Suddenly a wild figure, arrayed in tatters make3 its appearance. This is Richard himself, who has not only spared the life of his rival, when it was completely within his clutch, but has laboured magnanirmously to pro. serve him, for the sake of the lady whom they both love, whea he might easily have let him die, off without incurring blood-guiltiness. When the magnanimity of Richard is fully established he dies inthe arms o' his friend and his beloved. Now, throughout the whole of this situation Richard, by dint of moral and physical suffering, is in a state of downright insanity, and he is compeUed to roveal the generosity of his soul through all the impedi. ment of a mental fog. All sorts of emotions are to be portrayed under a stratum of madness, and at last this is to bh flung aside. By the most accurate attention in fitting every articulation and gesture to the circumstances of this complicated position Mfr. Dickens solves the intricate problem, and presents a solution which taxes the attention to the utmost, so high is the valuo of evory one of his details. Such a deliberate croation on the part of the actor can only be appreciated by the most careful study on the part of the spectator. Of the company generaly, with tho exception of Mr. Dickens and two others, it may be fairly said that they are clever amateurs, though there is much genuine pathos in the acting of the ladies, The two who besides Mr. Dickens are worthy of comparison with any members of the theatrical profession, are Mr. Mark Lemon, whose representation of a bluff naval officer is a good soulnd unaffected "bit" of nature, and Mr. Augutus Egg, whose humour, as the grumbling ship's cook, John Want, is at once unexaggerated and characteristic. The scenic effects, which, under the superintendenco of Messrs.

BAILWAY INTBLLIGENCZ, ILONDON AND SOUTH.-WBST,. A special meeting of the company was held on Saturday at the Waterloo station to consider a Bill now before Parlia. mnent; Mr. W. J. Chajplin in the chair.- The CnA n3uN said the meeting wias convened in compliance with the standing orders of the Houso of Lords. The object of the Bill was merely to extend the Staines and WVoliagham line to the Great Western Iailway at Reading, and to give power to the South-Eastern, South-Western, and Great Western companies to participate in any bene. ficial arrangement that might be made for the interchange and working of traffic. The SoLIcrros. read the heads of the Bill and the clauses relating to the use and working of the proposed junction bneiwhich was to connect thenarroirgaugelinesatReading. and.also those respecting the collection, conveyance, ni delivery of qoodstraffic, and the apportionment and division of the traffic during any specified time not exceeding 10 years, subject to the approval of tho Board of Trade, and of .tree-fifths of the shareholders represented at a meeting convened for the purpose. Contracts or agreements in respect to traffc may be renewed at the end of ten years if approved by theeBoardof Trade. B1The CuAmmA moved a formal resolution approving the Bill. Mr. HERAkATH thought it desirable on such occaions that they should have a mnap of the lines and district placed in the rooma to give them an idea of what they were about. He was glad to see that the Great Western and SouthWestern eQmpanies were working harmoniously at Dorcheeter and Salisbury to develope the traffic. The CHAra? concurred inthe utility of a map on such occasions, but the junction line was only about 1 mile 7 furlongs in length. The Great Westem Company would construct it for the Wokingham Company, and, as it would run into the Great Western llne, it was quite right they should have contiol over it. They were working amicably with the Great Western Company, and they would have a better station at Salibury than was expected; for since the Bill had passed the Great Western. Company had en- ressed their willingness, to cohstruct the station at Sails. tnry,soasto be conveniently connected with the South. Western station there, with a view to facilitate the traffic. M r. HERAPsA:f was glad the two'companies had come to an amicablIe arrangement, as great injury had been done to railway property generlly by the adverse proceedings of railway companies. The subject now was bettor under. stood than forierly, and itwas found that amicable arrange. ments fortlie accommodation of the public and the develope. mient of the traffic were much better for all parties than ruinous competition. The motion approving the Bil was carried unanimously, and the meeting separted. OSWESTRY AND NEWTOWN. On Friday three meetings of this company took place at We].Gpool-viz., the adjourned half-yearly meeting and two special meetings. Sir W. W. Wynn, M.P., presided. The CAnanir moved the adoption of the directors' half-yearly report, an absrct of which has already ap. peared in 27E Times. Mr. MISHALL moved an amendment on the two first paragraphs in the report, having reference to the appoint. ment of Mr. Piercy as enginecr-iiuchlef and the cireum. stances that hd led to his resignation and subsequent ap. pointment of resident engineer under Mr. Joseph Cubitt, and also as to the slow progress in the purchase of land. Mr. R. N. BnOUGHTON seconded the amendment. Ultimately, after considerable discussion, the report was adopted by omitting a portion of the first paragraph from the words commencing "the anpointment" to "Ehould be appointed," and wholly omittiiig the second.O u The neeting was then made specizalA for the reception and consideration of theo report of the commnittee of investiga. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in 27cc Times, was taken as read. Mr. CARm-RrGsrz moved- That an negtiations as to the oontercts of worlawith Moess. Tlieston and Id'Cormnlck be Abandoned." He stated that the opinion of the committee with respect to this resolution was unanimous. Mr. G. H. Wmiis.xY seconded theresolution. A letter from Mr. Thornton (of the firm of Thornton and M'Cormick, was read. It stated that they had been advised that the agreement was valid, and they were determined to enforcoe their rights. .Mr. Mv-YTmA (a director, and ono of the eight gentlemen who signed the agreement with the contractors) spoke strongly against the resolution. He deprecated any repudi. atton OI the a-reement. The Rev. ..J. HARRISON said the question was, whether the provisional directors having signed the agreement witl. the full knowledge of its effect, were not bound as men of honour to carr it out. Earl PowrS (a director) strongly expressed his concurrence in the observations of Mr. 3fytlar, and his determination to vote agaiat the resolution. They should seo that reduction could be made by limiting the earthworks to a single line, and giving Mr. Thornton the opportunity of making another estimate. The resolution was carried by a large majority. Earl Powis demanded a poll, the result of which showed a maiority for the resolution of 678 on the chares on which calls bad been paid in fall, and 817 on shares on which the last call had not been paid. (Cheers.) The CAmmjA said the directors had agreed to give up the annual sum of 500Z. allotted to them. Resolutions were passed indemnifying the eight gentle. men who had signed the agreemnt of tbelilth of January, 1855, from the consequences thereof, the company under. taking to defend them from any action or suit that might be insfituted Against them by the contractors; calling the attention of the boa .&."i ie 'company; Thg ths fllary of the secretary at 2501. a-year; authorizing the directors to comnplete the contiract with Mr. Davidson for constructing the line, and requesting them to adopt the most stringent economy in every department. Votes of thanbs to the Commlittee of Investigation and to the chairman of the company closed the proceedings. CONVEYANCE OF MAILS BY RAILWAY. On Saturday a large meeting of railway directors and managers of railway companies was held at the Kingds Arms Tavern, Westminster, to consider the propriety of opposing A Bill to make further Provision for the Lonveyance of Mails by Railwa s." Mr. E. Denison was re- qested to take the chair unn tbo arrival of the Marquis of SI Andos, who afterwards presided. Mr. COsTEs was appointed to act as secretary to the meeting, and, at the request of tho Chairman, stated his views with regard to the BilL In his opinion the main object of the Bill was to give the Post-offico authorities absolute control of all that related to the conveyance of the mail bags on railways, whether by mail trains or such trains as they might think fit to use as mail ;rains properly so called; to compel such trains to travel at night at any speed they may prescribe, provided the speed be not "reater than that of an express train run during the day. under the Bill the Post-offico authorities would have the power to prescribe the running of such trains as they may require, unless an officer of the Board of Trade should declare the running of them to be unsafe. Ho (M1r. Coates) had been Informed by competent persons that sueh a mea. sure would be impracticable, as a great part of the goods traffic was carried over many lines during night, and such a power as that sought would be incompatible with railway management, or the public safety. They would be placed under the control of an officer of the Board of Trade, while the railway companies would be held responsible for all accidents and losses that might result from such interference by the Post-office. The next important matter in the Bill was the 5th clause, which was exceedingly difficult to understand. He had tried very hard to interpret it, but could not succeed to his satisfaction. He believed it was intended by the clauee that the Post-office should have the power to order a railway company to alter the time of running the mail trains, to delay others, and compel trains to ran at high ced in order to make up for lost time, either from deles ethe Post-office or the trains of other companie. These delays and various rates of speed, the temporary conversion of ordinary trains into mail trains, would oomplicate the working of the trains, endanger the public safety, and causo penalties out of number to be ineurred by the railway companies under existing contracts with the Postoffice. There was another clause, in which it was proposed to enable tho Post-offlce to forward itg mall bass by ordinary trains, including luggage trains, wvithout a guard or any attendant. The companies were to receive the mail bags, and deliver them as ordiar parcels. This regulation would involve the companies in great risks. A railway company would not be at liberty to alter the-time of runni a train without first having given seven days' notice to the Post-office, and also stating the time of starting the train before and after it, so that the Post-office might avail itself of either of those trains should it be deemed requiste. It was also provided by the Bill that- the Post office might send bags in charge of the guard of any train at JL per mile for every 1291hb. welght of letter bags, to be paid for according to an average mileage and weight to be decided by the Board of Trade. Thoe 14th clause referred to the mode of settling disputes. The present method was by arbitration and the appointmnent of an umpire; but the BiU proposed (should arbittators disagree) the appointment of umpires by the Speaker of the House of Commons, who shoulad have absolute power to decide the question in the core of 28 days. Should ho be unable to o so by the end of 28 days another umpire would be ap- poiteca to decide the matter, andi so n, ntila wad6 made. Then the provisionL for serving notices declared that eVer notice from the Post-office to any director, secretary, or cl erk, or left at any station of such company, should be cdeeiled a sufficient notice. TheCs.AmsLuTl stated that as.the Bill wagto beerdaa second time on Monday itwould bo requisite to tak-e iummediate steps to oppose it. A discussion ensued, in which the representatives of the great railways took part, in the courne of which it wasastate that the meanour was impracticable, fraught with danger to the public, and caiculated to upset existing agreements between the railway companies and the Post-office, whichl arrangaments had been arrived at after long And patient negotiatons.
