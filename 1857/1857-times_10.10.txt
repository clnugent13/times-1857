TO THB EDITOR OF TF1S TIMEfzS. Sir,-A letter in your ParAer of this morning, signed "J. W.," refers, I presume, to a sermon which I preached on We4nesday at the parish church, inwhich I stateO that a Brahmin of high caste had been dismi-sed from the Company's serviCe Bimply from beco4ning a Christian. I take the liberty to enclose a document containing a fuU account of the traction, and beg to request that you will make some reference to it in your next number, as many of my parishioners will probably see the letter in question, and my character for veracity stands impugned. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. DANIEL WIISON. Vicar of Islington, I1ngton, Oct. 9. The following Is taken from the Narrative of Mr. Fisher as reprinted in the Chuzrch lMissiouasry Intell.itiencer from Wilkinson's Sketches of Christianity in 2qos-l. India, 1837: I offer these few remarks in order to introdaoe to your notice and that of your readers a narrative of some interest, from the peculiar circumnstances attending it, and which is not, I believe, very generally known, as I think it ought to be. At the time of its occurrence (now above 17 years ago) there were stlll found some few alarmists 'who anticipated that rebellion, and civil war, and misery were likely to follow forthwith aKl efforts to conrert the people; and when a high-caste Sepoy had embraced the Christian faith, the consequent disoomfiture of our armies, and the overthrow of the British power in India, were prophetically foretold as the sure consequences of so 'singular and unprecedented a circumstance.' The following narrative will illustrate the nature of these apprehensions, and, I should hope, will also tend to show how visionary and unfounded they are. "In the month of December, 1819, I was much surprised by the receipt of a letter, of which the following is an extract, from the Bishop of Calcutta, Dr. Middlton:- "'Rev. and Dear Sir,-You are by this time probably aware that some meure of public attention has been drawn to the subject of the conversion of a Brahmin belonging to one of the regiments quartered at your station. It may be of lmportance that I should be fully acquainted with the particnlars, and I cannot so properly apply to any one In such a case as to yourself. I shall therefore be glxd to receive your statement as early as you can conveniently send lt to me, ac, 'I am, rev, and dear Sir, Yours, very faithfully, Nov. 29, 1819. 4T. F. C,ac "A few days after the receipt of this letter, which I acknowledge surprised me not a little, aa I had never (previous to the Bishop's letter) heard a syllable upon the subject, I rece;ved through the brigade major (Ist) a copy of a letter which had been written to Colonel Nicol (then the AaijutastGeneral), in order that the same should be reported to the Marquis of Hastings, as Commander-in.-Chief, and also (2d) copy of the orders which were issued in consequence of the major's report, to the foUowing effect No. L I'TO T'E ADJUTANT.GONRL OF TEB ARMY. " 'May I request yorm will do me the honour to report to his Excellency tho Commander-in-Chief a most singular and unprecedented circumstance that has lately oocurred in the corps under my command-viz., the conversion of a Naick named Prabhu Din Pundah, from the Hindoo to the Christian rellilon ? He was baptized by the Rev. Mr. F- on the evening of the 20th and that without my privity or consent. As the lst battalion of the 25th Regiment Native Infantry Is composed chiefly of the highest case of Brahmins, this event has filed them wit'h the greatest consternation, and in its consequences may prove injurious to the corps, particularly in its recruiting department, the prejudicea of the natives being such, that men of high caste wiU be averse to enter It, under a supposition that means were to be employed to convert them. The Naick Prabhu Din Pundab was a high-caste Brahmin, and much esteemed in the corps until the late event. " I have the honour, &c. "'2M. B. "'Commanding 1st Battalion 25th Native Infantry.' "With the above wvas received No. 2. " 'TO THE ADJUTA.T-GENERAL OF THE ARMY. "Sir,-I am directed by the most noble the GovernorGeneral in Conucil to acknowledge the receipt of yourletter of the 12th lnst4, transmitting a copy of a letter from, &c., respecting the eonversion of Prabhu Din, a high-caste Brabhmlin and Naick in that corps, to the Christian religion, and his baptism by the R>ev. MIr. F-, a regular military chap. lain on this establishment, without any pre rious information having been afforded to the battalion, " ' 2. With reference to the feeling of consternation whhioh Major B- describes to have been created by this occurrence among the men under his command, and to the very dangerous consequences which might be experienced were this procedure of Mr. F-'s supposed to be coupled with the official duties of the situation to which he has been appointed by Government, his Lordship in Council is disposed to view the matter in the most serious light, and feels extremely anxious to be satisfied in regard to the means which have been used to induce the individual in question to embrace the Christian faith. " '3. In order that all the circmnstances of the case may be brought fully to the knowledge of the Government, the Governor-General in Council haa desired me to request that his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief will cause a special committee to be onvened at Meerut, to investigate and roport most fully upon all the circumstances referred to in Major B-'s letter which may tend to throw light either upon the origin or progress of the conversion of Prabhu Din Pundah to Christianity. ' '4. His Lordship in Council considers it also necessary that the committee should be particularly instructed to ir,quire and report whether any and what measures have been adopted in that cantonment which may in any way be considered to interfere with the religious prejudices of the native soldiery, i view to their conversion, by the employment of native or other emissaries, in frequenting the ines of corps, or residing for such purposes within the limits of the military cantonments. "I' 5. In conclusion, I am instructed to request that his ExceUency the Commander-in-Chief wiiU direct the removal of Naick Prabhu Din Pundah from the 1st battalion of the 25th Native Infantry, causing a promotion to be made in hisroom, his pay and allowrances to be drawn for by the brigade-maFjor at M-, where he is to remain until the pleasure of Government, after the proceedings of the Committee, now ordered, shall be made known o this singular and unprecedented case. 'IanU, &C., W ' W. C., "c' Secretary to Government, Military lDepartment! " The following is my reply to the Bishop:- " 'My Lord,-Having had the honour to receive your r ord-"' ip's communication respecting the conversion aud subL cr %t baptism of Matthew Prabhu Din, Naick in the 25th Regiment Native Infantry, I beg leave, in cheerful eompliance with your Lordship's request for full information upon the subject, to state the following particulars. Could I, however, have Imagined It possible that Major B. had written so intemperate a record of this open transaction I must have felt it an incumbent duty to address your Lordship long ago; but, as that gentleman assured me, in reply to a note of mine, written in conseqnence of your Lordship's letter, that " he had merely related the fact' in compliance with what he felt to be his duty,' and gave me no intimationi of his having prof. ferred any alarming prophetic conjectures of his own, I could not anticipate consaquences of an unpleasant nature, and therefore did not think it necessary to trouble you upon the subject. "'I believe your Lordship is already fuly aware that since my residence at M - I have had abundant occasion to observe a strong spirit of inquiry prevalent among many of the natives as to the nature of the Christian religion. Unsolicited and, I may say, wholly unsought on my part (as my time was fully occupied by my large Europoan nock), numbers, both of Mahosnedans and lindoos, frequently visit my house for the purpose of beg. ging, if they cannot afford to purchasc, our Scriptures in the native languages; or to inquire into the meaning of the different passages which awaken their curiosity or excite their feelings. The interesting result has been a certain degree of intimacy between us, and, in some instances, the ultimate conversion, baptism, and consistent Christian deportment of those wvho have joined themselves to our church. One of these men, whose uprightness and abilities qualify him for the office, is employed by me to conduct this little church rnder my own eye and direction, which he does with seal and considerable talent. During his absence on occasional missionary labour among the Saadhs (to whom le is parti. cularly acceptable) my Moonshee Mooneef,a who is also ono of our Christian congregation, takes hil- place. " I Part of the daily occupations of this lictle party of native converts is to read the Scriptures in their own apartments, which is an old convenient upper room over one of the gateways of the city of M--. Of course, this roou, is free of aocees to every voluntsry visiltor. Their congregation of hearers varies much in numerical strength, sometimes six or seven, old and yeung men, at other times twice the number. Among the o,ccasional visitors at this place the soldier in question freqiently made his appearance, and ultimatoly requested to be introduced to me. iHLs visits to me, in consequence, weres very frequent, and the decided change of his opinions, and, I trust, of his heart, marked and satisfactory. I found he had been lonlabourinv under deep conviction of the worthlessness and wic'ecdness of his heathen ignorance and idolatry, even for nine years. He kep' these thoughts much to himself, prcferringto wait 'the convenient opportunity,' but the convictlons of his hea.-t became stronger and stronger until he went with his regimentto the Isle of France. There he used to watch for opportunities to steal into the Christian church, and comfort himself by thinking to worship the Christian's God in spirit, though ignorant of the meaning of the langae, or of the terms of devotion whith were in use, and could only comfort his sorrowful heart with the conscious reflection that 'the Christian's God knew his her. Be earnestly longed to meet with some Ona who should be competeont to instruct him hbat he must do to be saved. Yet many depressing fears of consequences, both of a temporal and spiritual nature, frequently discouraged him. At last he made up his mind that if ever opportunity should offer itself to speak to a Christian clergyman he would unfold the state of his soul, let the consequences bh what they might. Ho gave a very affecting account of his state of mind during the remainder of his stay at the Mau. ritms and in his voyage back to Calcutta. A furlough being granted to the soldiers who had distingaisbed themselves, Prabhu Din went to his native village; and after ipending a little time with his relations there he was nto contented merely to display the medal upon his breast, but nnfolded his whole miand and his fixed resolution to embrace Christianity. Atfirt they endeavoured to diasuade him, but, finding him immoveable, desisted and parted fromn him with many tears, his mother exclaiming as be left her, 'You have changed your faith and lost your caste, and say you have foun the true God. Beware you neverobange agxan I' lHe rejoined his regiment It Cawnpore, which haDppned almoat Immediately to be moved to the station of X-. His first inquiry was, 'Who Is the cbSplain, and does he teach my brethren ?' He waa told of the little upper chamber where the native Christians met together, Lnd went to aee them. 'I felt at onoe,' aiid be, ' when I saw the nature of their employment and heard their words, I said, Jesus Christ has board my prayer. God's mercy has brought me here.' Eis frequent visits were soon observed by the Brahmins of his corps, and whea they bocame apprised of his intention to become a ChrWian they manifested extreme sorrow to him, and strove to convince him of what they thought his folly, and by kind remonstrances to shako his purpose. They enlarged on the perilous consequences which would surely follo w-the irremediable loss of his high and honourable caste, the isoecUon of all intercourso in future with his numerous and dear friends, the certain displeasure of the Government,who would assuredly disgrace and dismiss him for becoming a Christian; thus that he would lose everything dear to him in life, nd finally life itself, for who would give him khansa pano ?I His reply jwas uniformly the same --'Jesus Christ wMil be my friend' He isthe Ifrlend of all who trnst 4m; and, as to caste, t6ere is none so ligh as the Christian caste, It is more honourable than all, for Chrisians are the people of the true God; heis their Father. My becoming a Christian cannot make me a bad soldier, and I mee no reason to believe that Govenmment will east me off any more than any other of the non-oommissioned officers-for instance, the sergeant-major, or the ouartermaster.sergeant, or the druimmers, all of whom are Christians - and why should they puniabh me unls I commit some fanlti " ' The Brahlmins, now finding him so resolved, tried to shake his stedfastnesa by the offer of money, a-d proposed to subscribe and settle upon him a monthly sam of 20 rupees for his life. This he instantly rejected5 saying hat he be. lleved Jesus Christ would provide for him much better than they could, and with this advantage-that it would be for ever. Finding him resolute, they endeavoured to vilify his character, represented him to be a drunkard and a lutton. nay, at last, insisted upon it that he was insane, Some of these scandals appear to havo been beieved by some of his superiors, for a regimentl coutrt of inquiry was instituted into his conduct, the result of vrhch, however, was that the most satisfactoryevidence was brooght forwrd, not only that he had always conducted himself remarkably well, bat that be was a particularly smrt, intelligent, and active soldier. "He was baptized by m e rt his owvn request (which I beg your Lordship will have the goodness particuarly to observe) on the 10th of October3 just before his departure on some regimental duty, and there was an end of the matter. The Branmin soldiers ceased to trouble him, and the onl7 symptom of consternation' which the major, in the plenitude of his zeal, so patheticnlly laments h that the Naiek cooks and eats his meals by himself, barred from adinimlo within the magic circle by which the Brahmin surrounds his choola. In every other immateri respect he remaIns just as he was before, to use the military phrasN,I a ed soldier and a good mn.' The only mark upon him is that he reads his Bible and* prays to the one eternal God, through Jemtts Christ his Saviour. I trust this plain unvarnished statement to your Lordship will place the matter in Its proper light, and be a sufficient proof that the intemperate and irritating representation which it has been thought proper to transmit for the information of Government was not warranted by the circumstances of the case, if only it had been properly understood.

How long is it sinee you nmde your first inquiries into the Christian faith ? 'IA. About nine years tinoe,when I went as a volunteer to the Isle of France. My attention was particularly attracted by the regular observance of the Sabbath, and by seeing the Europeans going to church to worship. I thence determined to make diligent inquiry when I could. But neither on my return to Calcutta, nor afterwards at Cawnpore, did I find what I thought a convenient opportunity, or leisure, for I had heavy duty to do; so it is only since I came to Meerut that I have had leisure or means of information IQ. When you arrived at Meerut did you yourself fist make inquiries, or did anybody come to you In the lines ? IA. I made my own inquiries myself from these two men now standing here, and who live near the Sudder Bazaar. (Mooneef, Mr. F.'s moonshee, and Baladur Xusseeh, a native convert baptized by Mr. F.) (Q. Did you go to hir, F. of your own aocord, or did Mr. F. send for you ? 'A. I went of my own accord to Mr. F.s house. Indeed, I went to everybody of whom I thought it wise to inquire. IIQ, Did you know, or did you ever hear, of any n viniting your lines to instruct any of the Sepoys in the Christian faith ? X'A. Never I I neither knew nor ever heard of such a thing. *' Q. Ilow were you received after your baism by your corps and company ? LA. They said nothing to me upon the subject. I did not receive any nnkind treatment from any of them except onel Sepoy of the left Grenadiers who was allways an enemy of mine. He reviled me, nd frequently said I was become a swfeeper. I quietly remonst-ra4ed with him. 1 felt angry, and ao Illeft him. "'Q. Did ever any of the Sepoys offer you any money not to become a Christian?S A. Yes. Two of the men called after me and said, 'We suppose it is money that yon want, and if so, we will give it you, provided you will not become a Christian.' I rephed, 'Lymind is resolute; I shall not change. I am determined to seek God, the only true God, in whose sight rupees are nothing.' Q. How much did they offer you? A. Twenty rupees a-month for my life. Q. Indeed I how could you refuse that offer? A. (Accompanying his reply with a very exprossivo lcok and action indicative of contempt) Rupia iuttee haie.t I wanted the salvation of my soul, which money will not buy. "*Q.

"A. No, I never heard any such words. Q. Proposed to Major B- by Mr. F-. Will Major B-- have the goodness to inform the Court in what way the 'consternation' which he described having been evinced (in his letter to the Adjutant-General) betrayed itself after the baptism of Prabhu Din. "'A. By Major B-.-The men seemed to be disatisfied with the Naick's conversion. They exceedingly wished that it had not taken place, for he was a man of very high caste, and much respected in the corps. Major B- does not know of any improprieties in the man's conduct 8ince his baptism, but the nmajor would rather offer to the court this summary statement (presenting it) of his information fiust received of the proceedings ai the affair in consequence. This statement was accordingly reeived, entered in the proceedines of the Court, and the oriinal. according to standing orders, forwarded with them to lead quarters. is I Statement.-On the 21st of October I received a note from Lieut. S-, the adjutant of the corps, intimating that there were rumours in the lines of a Naick in the 2d Grenadiers, named P'rabhu Din, having been baptized but, as the Naick was on the Judge of Circuit's guard, he could not ascertain the fact, and requesting to know if the circumstance had been reported to me. 1 replted, that his note was the first intimation Nvhich I had received upon the subject, and requested that he would be particular in his inquiries, and let me know the result. He called on me in the evening, and said that he had not a doubt but that the Naick had been converted. Upon this I wrote to Captain Showers, the brigado major, on the subject, who ca3ed on me.the following n orning, and said that the Naick had been baptized on the 201th by the Rev. Mr. F- " 'Shortly after this the adjutant called for orders, and then stated to me that the men of the corps appeared very much dissatisfied at theo Naick's conduct. I therefore thought it advisable to order such of tho native officers as were Hindoos, as also Lieutenant Smith, the interpreter, to attend me at the adjutant's quarte- - at 10 o'elock the following morning, when their apparent consternation at the conversion of the Naick induced rme to add the second paragraph in my letter to the Adjutant-Generai of the army respecting this singular occurrence.

Ari this request, however, could not be complied with (thoaghi I know not why) Matthew remained on his pendion pay. L Ought not to withhold one circumstance which I think highly creditable to his chacter.

I am not acquainted rith the reasons. I"1Some few years, too, after these events his old corp. marched through Meerut. The non-commissioned offloers and mnen of his company came to visit Matthew, and greete4 him with much cordiality and kindne&s. Many of themn exclaimed, ' Why don't you come back to us I what hsr,r have we done? Our offioers, the Sahib log, are Christiaxsj Our sergeant-major and quarter-nmaster-aergeant eroChristisn The drummers also are Christians. Whry cannot you remain?' What could he reply? 'It s tha Company's wil and pleasure.' " I believe this feeling now widely prevails, for I hav,. learned, from authority which I cannot doubt, that many Sepoys have expressed their conviction that, however ou& Britiuh law of toleration warrants the free exercise of his owrn faith to the lMahomedan or to the Elndoo, yet tbat. in embracing Christianity the doom of Matthew Prabhz Dln most inevitably awaits them. They would be dis. missed from their regiment as unfit to be employed, aune disqualified for any association with their equals, andfor th4 confidence of their superiors. The Rev. Annnd Mussee sasred me that several Sepoys had expressly told him, ' We are heartily disposed to embrace the truth, but thaesQ consquenees are too painful for us to endure.'

OFFICER. FOB INDIA. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIME8. Sir,-May I ask the favour of your kind advocacy ttsobtain for myself and other Indian officers aimilarly cir. cwnsanced redress for a grievance of which I submit 4. plain unvarnished statement, and leave the rest to you? You ar doubtless aware that on the 29th of June last. the Court of Directors (at the Instigation, it is believed, oC the Board of Control) diroctod all Indian officers then at home to return forthwith to their daty. I, like many others, had At that time not arrived from India, and subsequently, when I did arrive and had reported myself, I was unable tGscertain tho wishes of the Government regarding me, for the aimple reason that for aboat six weeks thereafter they could come to no declsion as to whether it would be expe. dieat to order out any more of their officors. The order I eventually received was dated the 10th of August last, and immediately on receiving it (in the country, a couple of days subsequently) I wrote to my ag,ents t secure me a berth in the steamer of the 20th of that month. It was then, however, too late to get one, and all that they could then do was to get a berth by the steamer of the 4th. of October, and in this there ws then but that one vacAnf In the meantime Government had resolved that officers who delayed starting before October should not be aUowe4. passage money; thus I and others are deprived of this in. dulgence, not because we were backward in oomplying wiclh the orders of the Government, but because we were kep: in suspanse for so long a time that it was absolutely impossi-le for us to leave sooner. I would not be understood to prefer a clan of right to passage money. My position is that the Court, having very considerately accorded this indulgenceJ to the offi^trs they ordered out in the first instance, were bound to taks care that in thus dispoeing of public money It should be fairly apportioned. Many officers who had been for years at home, and wh3 went out but a very few months sooner than they wouldt have been obliged to do by the expiry of their leave, hava boen allowed their passage-money; while we, who have onlyJust returned to be ordered out again, find ourselves denied the indulgence, from circumstances over which we had na control. As far as my personal feeling was concerned-and r apprehend that this must have been the feeling of my fellow-s6ffrors6-I should have much preferred beirg ordered out Immediately to having been kept for some feek in swepense as to the wishes of the Government; bua if It were objected that I might then have myself applied for permission to return It mnst be remembered that by doing so I should have sacrificed my furlough-i. e., the right which I now have of claiming at a future period the unexpired portion of that leave. I do not complsin of having to return now, though. thereby exposed to great additional expense and the sacrifice of time in a double trip, which wiU all be deductedl from my furlough, but I do ask that I may be placed o Dno worse fooiing in regard to this particalAr indulgence thVix those who are exposed to no such losses. I am happy to say that I have no complaint to make against the Court of Directors, who immediately on these circumstances being represented to them acquiesced in tho justioe of the claim preferred by myself and others similarlgy situated. It isof theBoardof Control tbat Icomplain, which. having ruled that no officers shall be allowed passage-money who sail later than September, is quite indifferent to any peculiar circumstances that may render it a matter of ccmmon justice to relax the rule in favour of tboce who cannot be acoused of having shown any want of alacrity in resp)rding to the requisition made for their services, and who a, a thus made the victims of the indecision probably of the board itself.

DAUIrNG ROBBEY.,-On MondAy mornng a robbery, remarkable for its extent and daring, was discovered to have been committed in the pawnbroking establishmeao of Mr. Bain. Broad-strcet, Aberdeen. The property stolen consists of 29 gold watches, 31 silver watches,' rings 2) watch chains, and about 61. in money,-the whole amonnriI,I probably, to nearly 3001. The manner in which tbe thieves accomplisbed their work was at once clever and courageous, Thoy asconded to tho top of the house, a foor. story one, adjoining the pawn establishment, opened the door of b padlocked garret there got out at the skylgb t, then slid down the slates to a flat-leaded portion of ib , building, tho scratches made by their shoes being very distinct, clambered up a division waU to get on the roc of Mr. Bain's houso (which is also tlat and leaded on thtopl, tore off some slates and wood from the side of a prejectiig attic door, and thus being able to draw the belt were within the paLwn establishment. Being a very old baUding, this is one of the most intricate places possible to conceive, yet the burglars had manaoed most adroitly to pick their way through trapdoors and windiuz stairs tll they came to the office, where they extracted the money and part of the goods. They then proceeded to the lowv floor, and reached the sale shop, admission to which they obtained by cutting out a round hole in the door by means of a boring brace, vrith a bit large enough to admit a man's arm. Eere they got the gold and silver watches, and having satisfied themselvesi within must have retraced their steps to te flat roof of the house, where they very cooUy joked and arranged their booty, a quantity of the less vZuablo rings, &c., being left lying In their cases at the top of thie house. Strange to say, nearly the whole of the stolen Droperty was stock kept by Mr. Bain for sale, the pledged goodg of the same description, though perfectly at the command of the thieves, being left untouched. Probably they may have thought the valuables they have taken are less likely to be so well known or easily recognized as pawne4 articles. A curious circumstance connected with the robbery is that the thieves were heard by two wornea opening the padlocked door about 1 o'clock (Monday morning), talking to each other insido, and quittng again threo hours afterwards. The women were, however, so terror. stricken that they were quite unable to rise and venture am alarm. In getting from the one balcony to the other, the robbers had to pull themselves u bya rope fastened to sonme woodwork on the top of the higher house. This rope they, let behind them-the only one of their instruments yet dis. coverod. They missed, it may be mentioned, a sum of 1401.. Mr. Bain had in a drawer. The robbery was discovered about half-past 6 o'clock, when the officials went to operL the establishment; and intelligence hbving been Imnme. distely conveyed to the police a large number of the force vere instantly on the trail of tho thieves, who are supposed to be strangers. Up to the afternoon, however, not the least trace had been obtained either of them or any portion of the stolen goods. The fellows were, no doubt, e tl aseistod in their daring and successful scheme by theC77 fully cloar moonlight of the morning,-ScM,

I Since our last monthly report the demand for most do. scriptions of leather has been very animated. Although our quotations indicate but little change the market may be regarded as in a very healthy state, supplies having considerably diminished; al articles suitable for Government and export orders are becoming scarce. At the recent large German fairs prices were considerably higher than with xu, vrhich will prevent further shipments to this country at pre. sent. The inoreasing requirements for the army, together with continued activity both in the home and export trades, will, no doubt, absorb whatever fresh supplies may be forwarded to this market during the present year; and, altbough it may not be desirable for the ultimate interests of the trade that the existing high rates should be enhanced, there is every probability that no excess of supply beyond the demand will arise for soAe time to come, and that present quotations wiU be generally well sustained."
PROVIDBPNTIAL RESCUB BRO.l DRowxrIY.-On Wednesday evening four young men, named Dickson, Hutchison, Adamson, and Turner, left Richmond for London in a large sailing boat. On their way the wind, which had been high, increased, and the water became rougher, and it was with diffionlty that their stout oraft waseafelynaigated. After passing Hammersmnith railway-bridge, they misook the light of a dredging-barge for a cottage, and steered towards the object with the view of putting ashore. They tfhen heard loud cries, and passed an outnriger wlherry, bottom upwards, and tbree persons clinging to her to save their lives. These were immediately rescued by the crew of tlle sailing boat, who, about 20 yards farther on, discovcred a fourth person, absolutely " stuck in the mud," with tb e wFater up to his chin. He was also rescued. Tho wher.r:y was I)led astern, and tshe half-drowned craw were bake a to the Star and Garter at Putney. The crew of' ehe sailing~ boat also picked up an out-rigger wager-hoab and a gigr, botla bottomn Upwards, the occupant f of whAS.t su2.poed }>do ie~ 4rown,-ed,
&fO.NRT-M4RlKE. and OITYI.rTRYLLlaBzroB. Fziday Evening, The funds to-day have experienced further severe depression. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 892 to §, were first quoted 891 to #, and the market presented a very unsettled appearance. Ultimately there was a rally of an eighth, but the tone vwas still weak. The fnasl transactions were at 899 to . for money, and 89i to J for the 10th of November. The monthly return of the Bank of France, which is discouraging in all its features, was among the causes of the great depression, as well as the idea that the Bank of England mnay soon find it necessary to make another advance in 'heir rate of discount. The anticipations with regard to the Gazette statement of this evening, which shows the extraordinary reduction of 613,3961. in the stock of bullion, and a heavy diminution in the reserve, partly attributable to the advance to the East India Company, likewise tended to impair confidence. Loans on securities were in demand at from 5i to 6 per cent. India Stock left off at 207 to 210; India Bonds, 25s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 8s. to 4s. discount. The dividends on the stocks lately shut will be payable on Wednesday next, the 14th. The demand for money in the discount-market and at the Bank to-day was very heavy. The transactions in foreign stocks have been rather numerous, but the market shows lega firmness, and in some cases, especially in Turkish and Peruvian, a decline has been established. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 99k; Chilian Six per Cents., 102; Mexican, for the account, 20i and s ; Peruvian Four-and-a-EEalf per Cents., for the account, 77; Rusmian-Four-ana-affalf per Cents., 98; Sardinian, for the account, e9i; Spanish New Deferred, 265 and a; for the account, 25k; ditto, Passive, 6; Turklds Six per Cents., for the account, 93#, i, I and A; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 98k; and Dutch VFour per Cent. Certificates, 98. enezuela were sold at 27, the fall being attributed to a report that an intervieW yesterday between a deputation of the committee of bondholders and Lord Clarendon resulted unsatisfactorily. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the only alteration of imuportance was an imapro-vement in the rates upon Amsterdam and Hamburg. Tlhe corn-market was dull this morming at the prices of Monday. The report of the Liverpool cotton market for the week shows a steady businees, and an advance of 4d. per lb. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 50c. for money, and 67f. 60c. for the end of the month, hbowing no alteration. About 56,0001. of the Australian gold brought by the Indus yesterday was sold to the Bank this morning. The withdrawals during the day were limited to 8,0001. of American eagles. The figures presented in the monthly return of the Bank of France, published to-day, are so extraordinary, coming immediately after the announcement of the relaxation in the mode of granting loans on Stocks and Railway Shares, as to seem at first sight to involve seone clerical or typographical mistake, There is, however, no question of their correctness, and the fact consequently has to be recorded that the moment selected by the directors to encourage the speculative portion of the public to draw upon their resources was that immediately preceding the announcement of a reduction of 896,0001. in their stock of bullion, which has occurred in the space of four weeks, during which 10,1201. has been expended to attract supplies by artificial and, of course, delusive means. The total now held is reduced to 9,022,0001. The insufficiency of the existing rate of discount is at the sme time shown by an increase of 1,032,0001. in the bills held, while to admit of facilities being continued unchecked in the face of declining means the note issue has been augmented to the extent of 498,0001. The advances on stocks have increased 56,5001., and those on,railway shares 58,0001. In the Government balances there has been a falling off of 1,365,0001., and the payments thus made by the Treasury have led to an increase of 736,0001. in the deposits of the public. The bar silver brought by the last West India steamer has been sold at 6lid., showing an advance of jd. on the price realized for that by the preceding packet. The dollars remain unsold. In the colonial produce markets during the week there has been considerable dulness, attributable partly to the large supplies still brought forward and the rise in the rate of discount. The unsettled condition of the markets in the United States has also contributed in the same direction. Numerous public sales of sugar have taken place, and as holders manifested a desire to realize quotations were irregular, soft and low descriptions generaUy selling at a decline of from Is. to is. 6d. and middling 6d. to ls. while fine grocery nearly supported their former value-consurners purchasing freely. Ferw transactions are reported for exportation. Coffee has been flat, but to-day the dealers took the moderate quantity of plantation Ceylon submitted at Is. 6d. to 2s. below the rates of Friday last. Nearly all the other parcels brought upon the market this week have been withdrawn or bought in. Arrivals are stiUl heavy, and the stock is now in excess of the previous teason's at the same date. Tea has become extremely inactive; the trade evincing no disposition to buy. Public sales of Assam and China wiU take place on Tuesday. Rice has continued to attract attention, and the recent improvement is fully supported. No change of importance has occurred in spice, beyond a slight speculative Inquiry for pimento at the recent decline. A parcel of Bengal saltpetre, imported from America, was disposed of yesterday at a sudden fall of 6s. to 7a., but there has subsequently been a partial recovery, and to-day good to fine qualities went off readily at within 4s. of the highest rates current last week. The quarterly sales of indigo will commence on the 13th inst., and the quantity to be offered is 11,500 chests. The advance previously noted ha been paid by private contract. The Impartial of Smyrna announces the formal commencement of the projected railway from that port to 7dmn. The amount paid into the Treasury of the East India Company for bills on India from the 26th of September to the 9th inst. is 29,4991.

RAILWAY AND MI,WING SHARM Friday Evening. The railway-market opened S9.,* at a further decline, but subsequently a partial recovery took place. Great Northern were heavy, the A stock closing about 21. lower. After official ho= Cale. doDian and York and North Midland advaueed, the last prices at 4 o'clock showing an improvement upon the corresponding quotations esterdy. London and North-Western were also higher owing to purchases for investment. Canadian shares again receded, and Ceylon, Geelong and Melbourne, and Madras showed increased weakness. In foreign descriptions there was a general decline at the opening, and although a rally subsequently occurred they left off with much depression; Paris and Orleans especially closing at a reduction of 21. American securities continue to be in active demand at the present low prices, but no alteration has takenpiace. In mines the principal transactions were in Alfred Consols, which receaed 10s.; and a further improvement occurred in East Bassett. In joint-stock bank-s Oriental declined and South Australian were rather flatter. In niiscellaneous securities there was more activity, but the only variation was afall in Electric Telegraph (which are now quoted 98 to 101) and South Australian Land. CA.NALS.

A` report was brought up from the Committee of Works and Improvemnents on the subject of the formation of a new street at the Lt end of London, in which they recommend:- 'Tast tbe necegs yetepe be tsken by thb olsrdf or forming a roa I between the Past India Drck-road and Bow-road, in the eourae shown bYthe Uee coloured reod upon the pans produced. and for Improvtn8 tnA tldge ot the Esitem WCounts R8Hsy 1i the #rove-roa, anU the bridge Over Sir George Duukett'a C& l. In the Grove-road, pro. jided bt` eererat proprietors give up for the purposrs of the proposed road and ImDrovemenxs the land oDmnprsed within the points A an4 B upon the Dlans, to a widtu of 70 feet at the least: tbete r.

When he looked t the Act of Parliament he felt atfied that this waa coM - pletely a metropolitan improvernent, and moat be eonaidered in that light. This improvement vould give advantage to the inhabitants of four parishes, the rating of which amounted to S04,2641. He would not go into the merits of the proposal, as tbey had been fully set forth in a paper which had been printed and circulted extensively among the members, oonsequently they must aUl be wel &cquainted with the circumstances. If this roadw ere made it would be the precursor of anothor grt metropolitan improvement, and would aist the city of London in moasking a communication with the steam-ferry at the Isle of Dogs, and thus relieve the crowded streets of London of a large amount of the heavy traffio by which they were at preient impeded. He concluded by moving the resolution he bad read. Mr. WARE, without oocupying the time of the board, would second the motion. Mr. LISLiE ob*ected to so large a sum of money being voted, which would fall upon the ratepayers, in a board at which only 15 of its members were present. He also objected to the ratepayers being taxed to so large an amount for a local improvement, which would only be for the benefit of the landholders of the neighbourhood. He also objected to such a oostly improvement at a time when money could only he obtained in the money-market on the most unfavourabe terms. Mr. BROoKl would like to know how the money was to be raised before he voted upon the question. Mr. D'IkIFS43m and Mr. WiLncso? supported the motion. Mr. EL L, TATLosa thought it was very desirable that this iml,roveunt should take place, and at the samo time deprecated the position which was taken by some members in opposing any improvement because it did not happeen to be in their own locality. If it could be shown that the proposition would be a pubUlc iaprovement let them not consider at what end of the town it might happen to be. Mr. HAWi;ES opposed the motion, and Mr. CBRmEu gsup. ported it. Mr. DixoY having repled, The Board divided1 when there appeared,- For the motion ... ... ... 17 Againw it ... - .. ... ... . 3 Majority ... . . ... -14 After some other busies had been disposed of the Board adjourned.
f'HE NIHTINGALE FUND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIlMES. Sir,-Iu reply to the letter of "A A Veteran," inquiring through you " what has become of the large sum collected for the purpose of erecting a memorial of the services of Miss Nightingale," permit me to say that the money collected-amounting to 41,8512. 7s. 4d. (since augmented by other subscriptions)-was on the 20th of June paid into the hands of five trnstee6, appointed by miss Nightingale to receive it. They invested the sum in Government seoul. ties, bearing intere6t. Unhappily the state of Miss Nightingale's health does not, as yet, enable her to apply that fund to the purpose for which it was raised-and for which purpose alone she con. sented to roceive it,-" to eatblish an inatitution for the training, sustenanoe, and protection of nurses and hospital attendants." I desire to add that a report, accompanied by a balance sheet of receipts and expenditure, was published by direction of the committe, in Tte Timcs of June 26, and that I shall be happy to send a copy of the docament to "A Veterxan (or to any other applicant) if he will favour me with his name and address. Your faithful servant, S. a. ALL. Late one of the Hon. Secm. to the Nightingale Fand. 27, Ashloy.place, V1ctorlsstreet.
THE BRQ&sAR AND FOOTPAD NUISANCB. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I havo to apologize for once more raising the old alarm about the presence of dangerous footpads and the abence of the police. I have frequent occasion, " of nights," to traverse the inner ring of the Rogent's Park, by the Botanical Gardeus, and as often do I prepare for the perilous passge by arming myself with a strong and trasty staff. On the evening of the Faut-day (I think it was) shortly aften 10 o'clock, a fellow accosted me close to the gate of the Botanical Gardens (in the Regent's Paxk) with a, respectful application for a " match !" Now, I had been meditating on " matches," it is true, but only (as an ardeat lover) on those that are said to be made in Heaven; and it did not occur to me that my midnight friend had any very close connexion with the blessed plae. Besideea although as M.r. Robson, of the Olympic Theatre, wouad ay, I. may be "j olly brown," having just retvrned from a month's " rastication," I am by no means "jolly green," so I summarily snubbed the applicant for "matohes" with our concise, monosylabic, negative particle. wil not hint at the fate reservd for the gullible wayfarer who might have been tempted to parley with this would-be anticipator of future brimstone. Again, having arrived at Camden-town, on the broad pavement and in the glare of gaslamps, a "sturdy beggar" lirportuned me for alms, and afterwards made the same whining. appeal (bscked by a stout shillelagh) to a lady who was walking alone. The fellow took nothing by bis "motion," and having watched the lady out of harm's way I at last reached my railwaystation,murmuring tanyself, Sir, your own oft-repeated in. quiry, "W What are thbe poHce about? " For my own part, pensling the lamented absence of B flat No. 115 on garrison duty in area or kitchen, I warn all beggars, and especially ai persons who may. aost me with suspiCious applications, whether for sulpbur or copper coins, that I shall take tha Iw into myown hadcs and make very I Jiberal use of my stout OAK.

LONDON, SATURDAY, OCTOBBR 10, 1857. A process is now going on which, as it is a fact, must be looked in the face. What is called public opinion is takiDg in hand Indian affairs. Whether that be an advantage or not it matters little to inquire, for so is the fact, and it is a new and important phase in the politics of this country. Everybody now has something to say about it, and everybody with common sense, common feeling, and common information is listened to, even although his interest is only that of every Englishman, and bis knowledge of India derived mainly from the papers. Major BERESFORD spoke only as an Englishman, yet with none of that diffidence prescribed upon every mere Englishman who presumes to open his mouth on this subject. Mr. BAXTER, in a speech to his constituents reported in our yesterday's columns, takes more expressly, thoughunconsciously, theposition of an Englishman just opening his eyes to the fact of our Indian Empire, having his feelings roused, his curiosity excited, and his responsibility awakened. So long as that mysterious and unapproachable body which actually governs India kept things quiet out there, the result was accepted as the best defence of what was otherwise often indefensible. But this argument is now gone; a century's spell is broken ; a fearful catastrophe is enacted in the eyes of the whole world; every British eye is directed to that one region, every heart is strung, every tongue exclaims, every hand would fain rush to its familiar or unfamiliar weapon. Everybody is reflecting with as much calmness as he can master on what should be done, and, English fashion, is puzzling to make out how all this has come to pass. That appears to have been the chief direction of Mr. BAXTER'S speculations, and he has already provided a practical answer to the inquiry by going so far back and involving so many offenders, that nothIng can come of it except in the way of warning. The truth is, everybodyhas been crying "Wolf" in India for half a century or more; and aU that time usages have been going on that evidently tended to mutiny, but the mutiny never came, and the Indian Government thought that every year it postponed the costly and uncomfortable measures of prevention was so much gain to peace and finances. We need not look far from home for similar examples. There are certain events which will undoubtedly take place one day or other in our own Church and State, but the perpetual litany of of}icials and dignitaries,-indeed, of quiet men of all kinds,-is " Give peace in our time, 0 LoRD !" So the fault has been that of human, or, at least, English nature. Moreover, our national habit of changing our rulers has the unintended effect of wiping off many a troublesome score. Within these two years we have had a new Government at home ; not only a new Government, but a new constitution for India-a new Governor-General, new Commanders-in-Chief,-indeed, everything new, except mutinous Sepoy regiments and incapable British commandants,-the only fixtnres in the matter. Further, there certainly is a remarkable difficulty in getting to the bottom of Indian controversies. You meet a dozen Indians in succession, and they are all equally positive, but utterly at variance. One is a civilian, the other a soldier; one in the Bengal Army, another in the Bombay; one is a QruEEN's officer, another a Company's officer in the Line; another has had to do chiefly with Irregulars of one sort or another; lower down yon have an indigo planter with his views of Indian affairs ; then comes a clergyman or a missionary; then a high caste native gentleman from Calcutta, then a Parsee merchant. Every one of these smiles, and is positive; looks grave, but smothers in his bosom the fire of some rankling grievance, or some endless controversy. No; unless we intend to pursue our investigations till we come to the earth on the elephant, and the elephant on the tortoise, and the tortoise on a fish, we had better look forward, not backward, in this momentous question. But the question henceforth is an English one. WVith the honour of our country so deeply compromised as it now is, with 85,000 of our countrymen there fighting our battle, with insults of every kind heaped upon us, our women outraged, our churches burnt, and thousands of native Christians massacred on our account, we all feel that the cause is otur own. We cannot leave it in the hands of an invisible authority. The religious questions alone are of that interest that, once set on foot, they will agitate the whole British people. We may or may not be hypocrites an-d fanatics, but a nation which spends many hundred thousands a-year in the attempt to spread the Gospel all over the earth, and that annually sends out hundreds of devoted young men to the work, 'will, in fact, no longer endure that Christianity should be actually discouraged, and all but prohibited under some circumstances, throughout a vast country which we call our own, and which is iunder our laws. The difficulties of satisfying our own sense of truth and duty without a too violent interference with the native superstitions and delusions are not to be overlooked; but the British people are too much impressed with the truth and importance of their faith, and the responsibility devolving on its holders, not to allow it at least fair play. If it comes to them, as it must no w do, they will not persecute their own faith, and so undo with their left hand what they are doing with their right. They may do things awkwardly; they may be often inconsistent; they may allow themselves to be baffled by influences more subtle than popular will; but they will not let matters rest on a plainly irreligious and scandalous footing; and whoever has the temerity to defend such a footing will find himself, soon or late, sent to the wall. There is a universal conviction in the British people that the real enemies of their faith in India are not any inipudent imposture or ridiculous mythology. We have to contend againwt various policies which use these things for weapons, against an immense amount of mere unbelief, and perhaps the stM more serious obstacle of low Christian morals; but these are matters of which the British people is now fully cognizant, and it will not belie its convictions upon them. Nor, again, though it be a minor affair, will the British people be content that a country thrown on its protection and guidance ehould lag so far behind in all matters of material improvement, such as railways, cultivation, and manufactures. We may not do these things at home as well as we might do; we are certain to make mistakes when we try to do on the other side of the world what we very often bungle at our own doors; but that is not the question. What is the habit of the British people? Its habit is to grasp at more work than it can do, and to attempt the greater difficulty because it has failed in the less. It can see anothers failure when it cannot correct its own. We may depend on it that India, once riven open to our eyes, and the subject of audacious and indefatigable scrutiny, will not soon be laid aside. The events and disclosures of this year will give an impetus to feeling, to curiosity, and enterprise which none of us vill live to see flagging. We are far from saying that this result will be wholly unalloyed. We are fully aware that the empire of great dependencies, impossible to a republican government, is difficult to a mixed one like ours. We are aware that in the management of such a country as India there must be much policy of a sort which recoils from popular agitation and open discussion. Nor, indeed, are we advocating a more public and responsible management of Indian affairs, as if it were a matter that rested on advocacy, and was before a tribunaL If any dependence is to be placed on the deep interest everywhere excited, on the strong opinions everywhere expressed, and the ready echo given to those opinions, the matter is past advocacy and tribunals. It is already resolved on, and when Parliament reassembles it will treat the subject with as little reserve and with as direct an appeal to the responsibility of the Mlinister as if it were a purely domestic question. That is the spirit in which the enterprising member for the AMontrose Burghs invades the subject, and he certainly will not be alone. But even if he, or a dozen others, were silenced, or inoculated with old Indian reserve, nothing can undo the hold which India has now taken on the minds of the people, or disabuse that people of the belief that the question is their own. How far that interference will be pushed will depend on the success of our arms and the prosperity of India under the existing forms of administration, but no substantial obstacle will be allowed to interpose between India and England, that does and suffers so much for her. No Minister will be permitted to throw on the shadow of a Company or a Board the responsibility of measures or neglects in which we are all as deeply concerned as in the welfare of our own metropolis. No doubt, such a state of public feeling, if not otherwise satisfied, would lead eventually to the immediate assumption of India by the British CRowN, and its administration by a Secretary of State, like any other CRowx dependency. It would be vain to conceal that there are dangers in such a course, first and foremost, as has been recognized for a century, of that jobbery which may be called the curse of British politics. It is difficult to imagine any authority or any regulations strong enough to save Indian patronage from being quietly parcelled out among the suppor'cers of THR M Asr's Governnent for the time being. But that is no affair of ours. We are not now advocating any constitutional change, and are not called on to answer any objection. WVe are only pointing out the fact that British opinion has now taken possession of Indian affairs, and will henceforth be content with nothing short of a direct voice upon them.
It is an old remark that nobody knows exactly what he is like. It is true every one sees his face in the glass at stated times, when the solemnities of the toilette are performed, and sometimes casually at other times. A furtive glance is sometimes cast on one side, as some broad square sheet of reflective light is passed; but the toilette is too rigid a ceremonial, and too confined in its scope, to do justice to the human countenance, and those uneasy troubled glances are very inadequate channels of information on this tender point. To look at yourself for the purpose of seeing what you are like is no't, in fact, to see yourself, but only to see somebody who is rather impertinently curious about you. So the result is that nobody knows quite what he is like. Most portraits rather surprise the original at first ,ight, and the terrible faithfulness of photography has disgusted many a woould-be NARcissus. We suppose it is upon some principle analogous to this that we English people do not know exactly how we look in the eyes of foreigners. We are told we are unpopular abroad; that we repel by our stiff and reserved manners; that we are considered purseproud, arrogant, and overbearing. We are told all this; but we find it difficult to realize this character of us, for this simple reason,-that we have no dislike for our neighbours, and therefore do not understand how they dislike us. We cannot comprehend how, when we are -wishing nobody any harm, and simply behaving, as we think, Daturally, we should be exciting spleen. There is a kind of calmness, indeed, w;hich is more irritating than any extravagance-a calmness which penetrates like steel; but this is not the English temper. WVe do not make it our business to put people out of humour in order to enjoy their anger. Still, as everybody tells us so, we must believe, we suppose, that we are considered on the Continent generally to be a provoking people, Igiving ourselves airs, and thinking ourselves better than all the rest of the world. We cannot but think, indeed, that a good deal of this feeling towards us is political in its source, and represents a policy quite as much as any standard cf manners or morals against which we are supposed to offend. Our constitutional liberty is in itself an unpardonable offence over a large portion of the continent, and a compact bureaucratic phalanx caDI easily give the tone to public opinion, and create and sustain an unfavourable bias. Everybody knows how much may be done by even a few p-rsons of fair station and opportunities, who make it their j int business to puff a particular man, if they only act with steadiness and perseverance. The benevolent conspiracy has an effec; sooner or later. There is always a gentle current of favourable suggestion going on, 'which preoccupies the ground and possesses itself of the ear of society before any rival can interfere. The bureaucratic interest on the Continent is a ready-made conspiracy of this sort, only I unfavourable, instead of favourable, to England. This body is opposed by the strongest principle of self-interest to England, and this body has the I great advantage of being ubiquitous and at the same Itime compact. The bureaucratic element mixes ; with the whole of continental society, and can always give a turn to its impression, suggest an unfavourable aspect of any national act of ours, can always insinuate anything to our discredit, can give the worst interpretation of any recularity in our manners, and sustain a hostile bias once formed. In this state of things, we have not been surprised that it has been voted in many parts of the Continent that our Indian disasters will do us a great deal of good, that our pride wants taking down, and that the loss of India is just the thing to take it down. But, because we expected someihing of this view to be taken, we are not the less inclined to admire M. VA-N DE "NXEYER7s generous and open-hearted speech at Xaidenhead, showing such warm sympathy with us. Our continental neighbours wll say ME. VA? ;DP WM-Ex is half an Englishman, and will set down his admiration of English policy, his respect for our character, and his hearty good wishes for our success in India, as the eulogy and wishes of a partisan. But why should the Belgian Minister be considered a partisan ? Because he is the representative of a constitutional Government ? It so, that is at once to admit that the feeling against i us on the Continent has a political source, and that it is not a natural judgment, but a conventional one, formed upon a ground of political interest, because our constitution is a disagreeable witness against absolutism and bureaucracy. It would be to admit that the wish was father to the thought, and that we were voted to be black sheep because we bad a free Government; or must Al. VAN DE WEm-ER be considered a partisan because he has lived a long time among us? Extreme partiality does not always follow from long acquaintance, sometimes the very opposite result ensues. There is such a thing as people seeing too much of one another. Love and friendship are tried by time and company. Af3. VAN DE WEYER, then, speaking as a competent and impartial witness, is bold enough, foreigner though he be, to Draise Great Britain, and his honeat, plain-spoken, good vwishes for us stand in remarkable contrast with the dark mutterings in which the hostile feeling on the Continent indulges. Our opponents cannot openly and straightforwardly pray that we shall be beaten in India, because this would be imply siding with barbarism against civilization, | nd wishing that so many hundred millions of human beings should from justice and social order! fall back into savage life, anarchy, and con- I ,usion. It would be a prayer against human | rogress and improvement. Our frank and open friend the Tjnivers may utter such a prayer, i lut the Uniivers is thought a little fanatical even I y most of our illwishers on the Continent. So (ur opponents indulge in expectations and suppositions. Unfavourable prospects are dwelt upon with a relish, and if we lose India the benefit to our temper is coolly calculated. How niuch more open, mianly, and straightforward is the line of " the " friend of England" at this time I He can wish us success with all his heart, and without any disguise, because he knows that he ought to do so, that ours is the right side, and that in wishing us well he is siding with justice and civilization against barbarism and lawlessness. M. VAN DE WEYE1t speaks like a man proud of his side and confident in his ground. " WVe are fighting," he saya, " for a cause in which all "free and enlightened nations are interested. "We are fighting the battle of civilization itself." These are manly, honest, out-spoken words. If any mysterious power accompanies a hearty wishi M. VAN DE WEYERis has it, and with such foreigners as the Belgian Minister on our side we nay safely leave the ambiguous oracles and dark suggestions of foreign hostility to waste themselves in air. They will do us no harm if the very persons who utter them are half ashamed of themselvee. When honest and enlightened opinion on the Continent begins to pray for our downfall, as a benefit to humanity, we may begin to distrust ourselves and form a gloomy estimate of our prospects ; but ve do not care much for tCe obloquyto which a free constitution and a liberal policy expose us.
The Indian Relief Fund has now reached an amount which makes it important who shall administer it. Report says that the CHANcuLLoR of the ExCHEQUER has been making affectionate inquiries about it. We do not complain of this, tecause every CHAN'CELLOR of the EXCHEQUER IS hound to think that he can do a piece of business like this better than anybody else. How is it possible he should not? He is the nation's man of busiress. He is the picked man, the choice of a whole country for dealing with its money matters. He is our steward, executor, confidential clerk, accountant, agent, and broker. He is therefore the ex officio administrator of all patriotic funds. And if any impertinent person sugg-ests that he has only to do with public money, and not with the fruits of pri%ate charity, the answer is, that though he cannot force his services upon us, we ought only to be too glad to accept them. What ! object to have the national financier, the man who has officially the first business head in the country, to administer a patriotic fund ! Yet there are risks in accepting these high services. We will suppose the CHANCELLOR of the ExcnEQUER to be always a great man, because that is the theory. This is an advantage, then, to our fund, so far as it goes. But then comes the consideration that this great man has so many things to do. Leave a fund raised by private charity, like this Indian Relief Fund, to the management of a committee chosen from among the subscribers themselves, and you have a board of fair average heads, that can devote a good deal of time and attention to the task. The interest they take in the matter is a special one, not one of a crowd of official interests, not one merged in the work of a department. It stands out and is the prom.nent thing in the minds of those who compose a popular committee of administration. But to a CHASCELLOR of the ExcHEQUER it is one of a thousand things he has to do. We are approaching here an old question of comparative valuation. What amount of little men - for so, we suppose, we must call every member of a popular committee of administration, as compared with a CHANCELLOR of the ExcHEQusqER -.s equal to what fraction of a big one? Here is an interesting sum. Wlhat amount of time and attention from several men of respectable capacity, perfect honesty, and unquestionable zeal, is worth one glance of the eye of a CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER ? There are some great admirers of gigantic minds who think that no multiplication whatever of average intelligence can equal any decimal whatever of a first-rate one. If a great man says "Yes," or "No," or if henods his head, or if he turns in his armchair, the whole world of intellect is supposed to vibrate in symipathy witlh his merest utterance or motion. If a great man says something on some subject which he never thoughlt of before that instant, and never will think of again as long as he lives, it is trea- lured as a maxim for the guidance of future ages. How many foolish things have great men said because they were al in a moment expected to say something ? One of these colowsal minds is suddenly arrested in the middle of some absorbing train of thought or business, from which he has to tear himself by a violent wrench, and attend to some matter as far removed as the Antipodes or LTrsa Major from it. The question, then, is, what is a moment's use of greatness worth ? What ought it to bring in the market ? For our part we must frankly say, that we think a thousandth part of a great man may be overvalued. The application of intellect is no charm or piece of magic. If an intellectual giant speaks about something of which he knows absolutely nothing, and of which he has never thought, there are many who wil think his remark an oracle, but the probability is that it is worth about as much as the remark of any other person under the same circumstances. But there is another risk that we must face if we commit the Indian Relief Fund to the care of the CHANcELLoR of the ExcumQVuep It is quite rertain we can only have a fraction of this functionar;, but are we sure that we shall have that, or have it for long? Are not charitable funds, when they are appended to a department in this way, allowed in a short time to get quite out of sight, thrust into some hole or corner, where they lie for years unthought of and forgotten ? Was or was not this the case with the old Patriotic Fund, which lay buried in a secretary's desk from 1815 to the Crimean War, when a large surplus suddenly turned up, the interest of which had, we suppose, in the meantime supported the said secretary 7 we all of us know what curious discoveries are made from time to time in official departments,-what sudden prizes come up to the surface. The fisherman in the Eastern story, after a long day's unsuccessful toil, felt his net dragging a heavy weight, which, on being brought to the bank, turned out to be a cask of ingota. The rartic dug all day in a field, and at last felt the edge of his spade strike against some iron, which turned out to be a ring fastened to a stone, on the elevation of which a subterranean staircase appeared, at the bottom of which was a cavern full of treasures. The legend is formed on a favourite type, which has been the prolific parent of many and many a tale; it is a type which appeals to our cupidity and the love of the mysterious and marvellous combined-a powerful alliance. The black and sluggish waters of the official region reward the fisherman who nets tbemn sometimes with these kinds of discoveries,-not Oriental sums, perbaps, but still very respectable European ones. One of these stagnant pools of office revealed only the other day a sum of unclaimed prize-money, or wound-money, which had been accumulating ever so long, and now amounted to many thousand pounds. These facts do not speak very favourably for official management of funds. After the first excitement they are put on one side, and certain documents with figures upon them lie in some particular drawer, depending on some fortunate chance discovery, or the next great war, or revolution, or earthquake, to elicit them and bring them back again to light. On the whole, we cannot think ourselves guilty of any serious disrespect to official greatness if we say that a respectable committee of subscribers is fully able to administer an Indian Relief Fund, and that it is at least equal in such a capacity to a ten-thousandth part of a CHANCELLOR of the EXCuzQuEr.. It is, moreover, much more in accordance with the nattre of such a charity, 'which is not official, but private, that it should be adniinistered by an unofficial Board. When a fund once enters a public office it ceases to be considered a charity, and becomes in idea a part of the public revenue. Let not the Indian Relief Fund lose the character which its origin gives it. Never was there a fund which came more from the heart of the nation, or expressed individual feeling more strongly, and the management of the Fund should be in keeping with this, and not be made immediately an official affair.

T}1E INDIANi RELIEF FU-ND.-We are requested by the Lord M'Iayor to give publicity to the statement that the number of letters which are daily received by him from all parts of the kingdom containing remittances in aid of this ftund is so great that two or three days must necessarily intervene between the despatch of the remittance and the receipt of the acknowledgment of the committee. LORD BROl;1TA-M'S SFioy PROPEECY.-.A singular anticipation of the possible entire revolt of the Indian native army is recorded in Hansard's Commons Debates. 7 th February, 1828. Mr. Brougham, in his celebrated speech on Law Reform, denounced among otber abuses in our judiciary system the delays and oostliness of Indian appeals decided in London by the former fll-oostituted Court of Privy CounciL He contrasted the evil with the then Improved law courts of Ceylon, aLting that one good effect had reaulted in the latter colony as the Ceylon population, previonsly rebellious, in 1816 aided the mother country in putting down and crushing a military mutiny. Mr. Brougham further observed, "So it vill be in the Peninsula, if you give your subjects a share in administrating your hsws, and an interest and a pride in supporting you. Sbouldd the day ever come when disaffection may appeal to 70,000,000 against a few thousand strangers, wbo have plantedthemselvesupon the ruinsof their ancientidynasties, you will find how much safer it is to have won their hearts, and universally cemented their attachment by a common interest in your system, than to rely upon 150,000 Sepoy's swords, of excellent temper but in doubtful hands."

THE CHOLERA..-L1vIRPOOL, Oct. 8.-At the weekly meeting of the Health Committee to-day there was some discussion with respect to the threatened visitation of eholera in England. Dr. DUncan, the medical officer of the commit'ee, stated that he had read the circular issued by the Medical Board of Health. He was happy, however, to report that at present there was no symptom of the eptI demic in Liverpool. The diarrhcoa last week was belowv the average. He always found, he said, from previous experiences that it took six weeks for the disease to reach Liverpool after makiDg its appearance at lianshurgh. He hoped that this town would be spared a visitption on this occasion. At any rate, he wras clothed writh full power, and in the event of symptoms of cholera manifesting themselves, he would open branch dispensaries, holpital sheds, aud night houses, and take every necessary precaution against its spread.

On Thursday an influential meeting was held in the Town-hall, Ricbmend. Mr. Leonard Cooe presided. The Earl of ZETL"sn in proposing the first resolution said that in common with the whole country ho felt deeply the disasters which had fallen upon us in India. The aCcounts were such as made the heart siok, and he was not exaggerating in calling the barbarities and atrocities wvhich had been perpetrated there as unparalleled in histoey. It was some consolation to find that the Gover-nment were acting in a mannerequaltothe emergency, and that the sypa thiesof the country were fully awakened to the miseries which h ad been endured by our countrym en. A subscription of a large amount had been already raised to alleviaie in some measure the distresses which had been occasioned by the sebellion, and the spirit of the country too was fully aroused. Recruiting for the army was going on vigorously, and all classes were exerting themselves to reheve according to the means at their disposal the disastrous condition ot our countrymen and countrywomen in India. The noble earl concluded by proposing the first resolut3on:- Thatthis meeting desr to erprca Ita iieep sympathy with teebo who from the euUny In Inda h ae sutrered unyarUeled wueltes privations, and loses, and also its oDndolence with the reltious aund riends ofthose wo,e rlies have been so treadhoroumlysacrficed Ia *hia moat unholy outbreak." Colonel WADE, C.B., seconded the reaoclution, which was ;unanimously carried. Mr. W. J. S. Morritt proposed the sooond resolution " That ts meeung, feelng anxious to testify it cordil concurreue with the endearoms whicb all clames are mathg to alleviate a& fAr ,A t.oaSble the prirations of the suffenr; it Is resolred that a eiubs,lp Uon be entese Into in aid ot the funds now being rasa d, and that the amount be forwarded by ts ayeor of Rietnond to the cowejt*ee in London, to bo applied in ooltormlty with the reoluton a dopted on the o2th of deptember at the hlan.lon-hou,e." The speaker deplited the calamities endured by our countrymen in India, and referred to a lotter in Tk I imes descriptive of its horrors. It was then agreed that a sauscription should be made. Subecriptions were handed in, and upwards of 4001. was collected in the room, the list being headed by Lord Zetland with the munifioent donation of 100I.

TIHE CAMP AT ALDBRSJJOTT. Never, at the best of times, a cheerful place, the 'Camp just now looks doubly deajlate. The troops ave nearly all gone to India, the huts are niearly all emopty, the field-days are over, and rain and wind and withered leaves have it all to themselves on the black moor, which can neither be called mud nor water, though unquestionably containing a deal of *both. The long valley where the Court and camp so -often met last summer is a swamp bleak enough and -<deep enough for the abode of saurians, and looks as if the very hosts of Pharaoh would scarcely afford a mnouthful to its tenacious depths of slough. Now and then upon the common stray figures may be observed through the thick sleet, wrapped in drenched .cloaks, and struggling manfully against the cold wind to the shelter of the nearest huts. But these 1ruptions on the general solitude are few and lfar between, for though some 5,000 men are stil in camp, and the huts are after all but cheerless abodes, they are, nevertheless, preferable to the fierce inclemency of the open heath, and the men but seldom venture forth; so .the whole place has an uninhabitable gloom upon it, as if it were to let, in chancery, or insolvent, or re,ninds the spectator of the empty pitmen's barracks .at the mouth of a used-up mine. Cove-common, on which about three months ago stood such a picturesque encampment, is of course now like any other portion of the heath,-to wit a brown pasty-looking expanse, intermixed with little knolls from which the furze was trodden out by the men, and which, strange to say, are now -covered with good grass, the first that has ever grown at Aldershott. The marks of the hospitable 4camp fires are still visible, though they are now ,mere yawning holes, with anything but a cheerful significance about them, with here and there the zremains of a turf sentry-box faUen into dilapidation, for the men who occupied it are ere this before Delhi, if not inside it. At the extreme south of the camp fair progress -has been made with the permanent barracks, of the -extent and general fitness of which a ful account has -already appeared in The Times. The blocks allotted for the reception of the infantry are now quite -ready, and the work of fittinig them for the imme-diate reception of troops goes forward daily. It is not expected that either the cavalry or artillery "barracks will be used until next summer, though the quarters for the latter branch of the service are in all respects ready for occupation at a week's notice. The infantry blocks must be used, as nearly two-thirds of the camp huts have now been so long untenanted that they swarm with rats and mice, and smaller vermin, and are withal so damp as to be almost uninhabitable. The troops at present in camp amount to scarcely .5,000 men of all arms-namely, the 15th, 22d, and 96th Regiments, two field-batteries, one troop -of Horse ArtiUlery, the 4th Light Dragoons, the 1st and oth companies of the Military Train, and a company of Sappers aud Miners. To this force an addition will be made to-day by the arrival -of the Royal Berkshire Militia from Reading. This regiment scarcely musters 700 rank and file, though during its stay at Aldershott it will probably be 'ahWed to its ful numerical efficiency. The advbinced guard marched in yesterday with part of the baggage, and the main body wiU march in| 'to-day. As a set-off to this reinforcement to the camp, the 22d Regiment has received orders to hold itseli in readiness to embark for India, and there is every probability that this fine corps will soon receive the route. One field battery has also received similar notice, and the 4th Light iDragoons (with the exception of two troops which remain at camp for exercise in the new riding. schools) are to march to Colchester. To replace these troops the Royal Wiltshire Militia, mustering 800 rank and flle, are under orders to proceed to -camp from Devizes on Monday and Tuesday next, and a still fulrther augmentation will take place in the following week by the arrival of the Royal South,down Militia, 800 strong, which has also received the route for Aldershott. These are the only Militia -corps which up to the present have actually been ordered to join the camp, but it is expected that one or two more Militia regiments will be added in 'the course of the ensuing rmonth, together with the 4th Battalion of Rifes, which is being raised and -now at Winchester, mustering between 300 and 400 strong. These iinportant additions will raise the effective force atthe camp to from 8,000 to 10,0-)o inen, at which strength it will be kept throughout the winter. The other regiments of Mlilitia .at present called into service in England and Ireland will, it is anticipated, be distributed among the various garrison towns, which in maDy cases are either wholly without a garrison or only held by two or three companies of a regiment. A very general impression also prevails that early in spring some of the Militia will be asked to volunteer for garrison duty at Malta, Corfu, and other places. The latter contingency, however, is . supposed to-depend upon the progress made in re- cruiting for the Line, which, according to the most reliable accounts, is not going on as well as .could be wisbed among the desirable classes. Proficiency in the use of the Enfield and Mini6 rifles is still most assiduously cultivated at Aldershott, and the men practise at the targets during the greater part of the day. Every fortnight, also, a company of one of the regiments of Guards comes down to camnp for the same purpose, and, after two weeks' incessant practice aud instruction, is in turn relieved by another. This practice, with parade evolutionis and shot and shell practice, is likely to form the staple of camp drill. Some fatal accidents have recently occurred at Camp. During the evolutions of a field-day, when some guns wvere being dragged up the steep acclivity which leads to Ciesar's Camp, one of them unfortunately overturned, killing twro men and three horses. On Monday last, also, while Captain Brandlin' s troop of Horse Artillery was out for rocket practice, one of the tubes burst, and drove a large piece of metal tbrough the chest of a sergeant of Artillery, killing him instantaneously. Au inquest was held at the Camp on Thursday, which, of course, resulted in a verdict of accidental death, and yesterday the poor fellow was buried with the usual military honours. He was a young man who was remarked even among the non-commissioned oilicers for steadiness and good conduct. He served throughout the whole of the Crimean canipaign without being wounded, and had only been married three months before the melancholy accident occurred. An accident of a vei-y singular -description, but which fortuniately was not attended with fatal results, also took place at camp a short time since. Some dense clouds, heavily charged with electricity, were passing across the north camp at a short distance from the ground. On the brow of the hill over which the electric telegraph from head-quarters passes the -wires exercised sufficient influence to draw down a short dash, which of course instantly passed along the telegraph to head-quarters, where a clerk was in the act of sending a message to London. The clerk received a most violent shock, though fortunately not so severe as might have been anticipated from asch a mass of natural electricity. He -was, however, thrown to the ground stunned, and his face scorched and blackened; at the same time all the dials of the telegraph apparatus in the office were destroyed and blackened, and the needles de-magnetized. Apropos of the telegraph, we may niention that in case the camp authorities should want to use it this wvinter it would be as well to cut away the boughs of trees which rest upon it ii numberless places alongt the road to the Farnborominh station. Unlessthis-is done, and done efectually, the next messa .e from the War-oflice on " pipeclay H. K. No. 74,563" may be conveyed to the " listening earth," but most assuredly that important communication will never be conducted to Aldershott.

i MILITABY AND NAVAL INTELLIGBNOE. We have advices from our Malta correspondent to the 4th of October, announcing that Her Majeety's screw steam line-of-battle ship the Conqueror, bound thither, had been fallen in with under canvas, on the 28th of September, by the A lps steamer, 200 miles eastward of Gibraltar. The movements of screw steamers at Malta between the 1st and the 4th, with general cargoes, were those of the Alps from Liverpool and Gibraltar, for Syra, Constantinople, and Smyrna, having on board among other passengers M1r. Hornby, the newly appointed British Judge at Constantinople; the Scamander, from Liverpool for Alexandria; the Damascus, from Constantinople, Smyrna, and Alex. andria, for Tunis, Gibraltar, and Liverpool; the Madinina (French), from Tunis for Liverpool. Captain Waller and Lieutenant Tracey, in command of a detachment, of Captain Thring's and Captain Calvert's companies of the Royal Artillery, consisting of 1 sergeut, 1 bombardier, and 9 gunners, left Woolwich yesterday morning in charge of the baggage of the two companies about to proceed by the overland route to India, to be shipped on board the Australasian steamer at Southampton for Alexandria. Eleven artillery waggons laden with ammunition were likewise despatched from Woolwich Arsenal to be forwarded under the same escort from the Nine Alms station. The troops are under orders to leave the garrison at an early hour oa Sunday morning so as to enable the Australasian to sail, as already arranged, on the following day, the 12th. The battalions of Royal Marine Light Infantry being several hundred men below their proper establishment recruiting for that branch of the service is actively proceed. ing. The Lords of the Admiralty have ordered the standard to be reduced to 5 feet 6 inches, and, should the authorities determine on sending out an additional force of 1,000 Royal Marines to India, as has been proposed, the standard wil be further lowered to that of the Line regiments. At the present moment the four divisions of Royal Marines at Chathamn, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Woolwich, could supply 1,000 men, who are among the finest troops in the whole service, for India, exclusive of the proper proportion of Royal Marine Artillery. With the view of affording extended accommodation for the large number of officers and troops who wil be concentrated at Chatham for the purpose of reinforcing the British regiments serving in India, the authorities have it in contemplation to erect commodious barracks on the ground adjacent to Fort Pitt, Chatham, so as to provide ad. ditional barrack accommodation at that garrison for several thousand more troops, who are to be attached to the Indian battalions recently formed there. This step has been rendered necessary in order that the whole of the Indian troops should be thoroughly acquainted with the practical part of their duties before emubarking to join the service companies of their respective corps. A large sum will be expended during the ensuing year in erecting separate quarters for the married soldiers of the line at Chatham garrison, the amount already granted for that purpose having been appropriated in bulding separate rooms for the married non-commissioned officers and men of the Royal Engineers at Brompton Barracks The Ganges sailing vessel, 84, Captain Fulford, flag of Rear-Admiral R. L. Baynes, C.B., Commander-in-Chief in the Pacific, will be paid advance at Spithead this day, and sail early next week for her stntion, to relieve the Monarch, 84, Captain Patey, flag of Rear-Admiral Bruce. The Ganges, after being nearly four months fitting ont, has at length got her complement of crew within a dozen or so. She has been fitted with Clifford's boat-lowering gear. The Diadem, 32, screw frigate, Captain Moorsom, C.B, is receiving her stores and provisions, and wiLl be ready to go to Spithead about Monday, when she will make another trial of her speed, and, if al works well, take a cruise in the Channol to further test her qualities under various eiroumstances. The Cyclops, 6, paddle-frigate, Captain Pauen, will be ready to go to Spithead about Wednesday next. The Melpomene, newly built 51-gun screw frigate, lately taken fronm Pembroke to Portsmouth to be fitted out, wayesterday taken into the steam-basin to receive her engines, which have been for some time in waiting for her. The Beagle, 4, screw gunboat, was taken out of dock at Portsmouth yesterday. The freightahip Joseph Shepherd was moored off Woolwich Arsenal yesterday morning, and commenced receiving ammunition and live shell for Hongkong. An extra number of 80 artifieers, principally smniths, was yesterday morning engaged at Woolwich Arsenal, thus increasing the Royal carriage department within the last ten days byl,302 hands. Independently of the rapid claims mad& by the India-house the Royal carriage department have heavy demands in hand for the supply of shipping equipments, and coast and colonial defenoes, which have bee, unavoidably deferred. The steam transport Rhadamanthus, laden with steam gear and boilers for the western yards, sailed from Woolwich yesterday evening. The French Government having solicited permission to adopt the new description of lifeboat used by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution of Great Britain, Mr. Peake, assistant-master shipwright of Woolwich doeckyard, in ventor of the abovenamed lifeboat, has paid several visits to Boulogne durlng the reconstruction of a boat whioh the Lifeboat Committee of that town have remodelled according to his principle, and, having completed the work, he returned to Woolwieh yesterday. THE MILITIA. The Wiltshire Militi, Colonel Lord Broughton, G.C.B., is about being again called out for garrison duty. The Royal Lancashire Mhilita Artillery have volunteered to go with their officers to India, A portion of the Royal Berkshire Militia, under the command of Lieutenant Thonson, left Reading yesterday for Aldershott Camp, for the puspose of taking over huts for that regiment, which will proceed to Aldershott this day, there for the present to be stationed.
TO THE BDITOR OF THE TIMBS. Slr,-A gentleman connected with the British and Irish MSagnetio Telegraph Company ln Llverpool has iust returned from iishing in the river Ban, ia the north of Ireland, and has killed tbe enormous eight of 3ic t. of salmon and trout betwreen the 19th and 29th nlt., varying in weight from 81b. This extraordinary feat was accomplished with only three different flies, and not the least singular part of the matter is that the largest of the fish w as caught wth a common trout rod, weighing 2pe b.,and killed in an hour and three quarters. Perhaps such an extraordinary feat ls unparalleled, and hardly to be believed; hat any respectable gentlomaan may have ocular demonstration of the same hy calling at the office above named.

SANITARY PRocRESs.-Tynemouth, Oct. 8.-The tovwn council of TyneLnouth, as the local board of health, are adopting prudent measures for the conservancy of the public health. As in 1853, on the presence of tho cholera in the north of Europe, and remenmbering the immense trade between the Tyne and that part of the world, they are endeavouring to put the town into a thoroughly sanitary condition. Labourers are cleansing oat all the uack lanes and alleys in the borough, and an ample supply of quick. lime is kept in depots in various parts of the town, which is furnished to the labouring classes free of cost for whitewashing. The common lodginghouses are also put under the surveillance of the police, asnd overcrowding is carefuUy prevented. Sailors' lodgings are also now licensed. Sinco 1853 this borough has been thoroughly drained by a system of main sewerage, laid down at a considerable outlav under the inspection of a surveyor belong. ing to the General Board of Health, London. All the parisn graveyards have been closed, and a new general ceuetery belonging to the borough has been opened in the suburbs. Since the sewerage has been completed typhus and other fevers are reported to be less common and fataL It will be remembered that while Tynemouth escaped the cholera in 1853-for the six deaths reported were cases brought from Newcastle to the seaside-the village of Howdon Pans was nearly decimated by it. The older portion of Howdon is ca:cedingly unhealthy, and the River Tyne Commissioners, whoehold the principal portion of the property, are about to level it and raise it and build streets of nOw and oommodious houses. The village will also be well drained. Howdon has bad three visitations of choler.. On each ocoasion the disease before it became epidemic entered one particular tenement in an old house and struck down its first victim. A brief enuweration of a few facts will show what was the result of a little timely precaution and the exercise of magisterial poser in South Shields in 1853. In 1849 cholera broke out in a most malignant form in the common lodainghousts of one particular locality in South ShieldsUnion-alley. The iniuates nearly all perished on that occasion, and the police were obliged to burn the furniture an d shut the houses up to prevent the epidemic extendinv. A short time previous to the appearance of cholera in 1b53 in Newcastle-on-Tyne thcse lodgiDghouses were brought under the Common LDAgingbouse Act. They were li;ensed, the number of inmaittes Iimited, and they were inspected nightly by the police. The result was most striking. Other dwellit ga were visited by the cholera In 1853 in this locality and other poor districtbs of South Shields, and severa l ot their inmates perished, hut during the whole of the feaful autumn of 1803, and though scores of povercy-stricken people caine direct from the worst infected districts of Newrcastl,, tO lodge, not a single death occurred in any of the common lodgingbouses of South Shields froms cholera.

IRELAND. (PROM olga ow CORBaEPONDNT.) DUBLIN, FRIDLY MORIING. IHE GOVERMIEN3%T AND SE MAGISTRACY. The Lord Chancellor's letter to the Marquis of Londonderry bas created quite a panic or surprise inl tbe Irish political market. The Northetm Whtii, in whose columna the missive was first made public, maintains that, since 1829, a heavier blow has not been dealt against the ascendancy system in Ireland, adding,- " All honour to Lord CarLsle, aud to his (it is really neceEsary to say, Protestant) Lord Chancellor. Government after Governument in Ireland have admitted that Orangeism was their great difficulty. LordCarlislehaa been the first man tofecethefaetand grapple withtheeviL Hehasenteredupon a serious struggle, and the vigour of the act stamps him as a statesman. Acendancy Protestantism will be staggered. Hereby that party is distinctly informed that the Vioeroys of the British Sovereign are altogether unconscious of the blessings of loyal Orangaism; and are strangely persuaded that the love of order and the frenzy for the interests of Great Britain are altogether nuisances, perhaps sentimental, but slightly seditious. Every Orangeman is hereby advertised, by the frst officials in Ireland, as a rioter or a promoter of riots-as a bad subject, and consequently a bad Christian. It is an overwhelmlng decree. And let not the enthusiastically loyal persons who wi I mmedistely begin to roar resistance to the Viceroy console themselves with the hope that they can appeal to the Protestant passions and bigot sympathies of English Toryism. We are most assuredly satisfied that the Whig leaders in the Miuistry have seized the opportunity of the Belfast riots to inflict that political retribution long dae on themost debased, most artificial, and most mischievous party in Europe-the party of Irish Orangeism; and we are not the less sure thattheTory leaders of England wil secretlyapplaud, and publicly, however tacitly, assent to, the just sentence passed by Lord Carlisle and his coleagues on a confedera. tion which has been the curse of our country, which has set man agiast man, and which has done Its pious utmost to rob us of one-half the blessings which Providence has smiled upon our land. Every gentleman who, in future, ambitions the honours of the magistracy must disown all connexion with a disloyal, turbulent, and dangerous body Called the Orange Society. That is the prospective rule, which may, by due degrees, secure Ulster an impartial magistracy. But the Lord ChanceUor's letter will have a retrospective inflaence. No man of proper feeling, disagree. Ing with the Government respecting the character and tendency of the Orange Society, and being an Orangeman, can bold the commission of the peace. The wish of the Government plainly is, that no magistrate should be a membe; of an Orange lodge. Will any Orangeman already an Ulster magistrate remain of the bench ? We hope not; the moral and political duty of resignation of men like Lord Rnniskillen and Lord Dun. gannon i clear. But we dare say Orange loyalty will reveal itself by disobedience and defiance to the Queen's wishes and the Viceroy's ozders. So be it; the country will soon earn to know the d;fference between the legal magistrates and other magistrates for the administratioa of the law who are distrusted by the Government. But the blow has been struck. OraDgeism is declared a vulgarity. The gentry will shun It. Its day is over. What a comment is the Lord ChanceTlor's letter on the enthusi. astic and ooquent boasts of the Tory journals, that the R ots Commission inquiry had demonstrated that the Roman Catholio mob causedi al the ruffianism! Why is it that Lord Carlisle, whose speeches and writings are heartily Pro. testant, passes by the mobs, both Protestant and Catholic, and puts his finger on the magistracy ?" The Freevwn's Jontrnal, regards the letter of the Lord Chancellor as at once an indication that the Government has made its election, and an assurance that it wMiU act on that election with firmne3s and muoderation. " If Ribandism is excluded froin the bench, as it ought to be, so should Orangeism. They are essentiaUy similar in charac. ter, and the law and the executive must treat them both with the same rigidly inflexible impartiality." The Dublin morning Derbyite organ gives the Chancellor's letter in a prominent form,but does not add a single word of comment. BALLINAsLOE FAIR. The blamk cattle fair was held yesterday, and, con. traty to expectation, turned out better for the grazlers than was anticipated in the earlier part of the week. The following account is supplied by oue of the morning papers:- "Ballinasloe, Thursday Mornin.' "There was about an average supply of black cattle this morning. Buniness has been going on slowly up to 9 o'clock, but in several of the transactions that have taken place a slight improvement on last year's prices has occurred. Some top lots of heifers have fetched from lOs. to 20s. more than they did in 1856. Lord Clonmel purchased a mag, nificent lot of 40 heifers fromA Mr. Robert D'Arcy for 211. 15s. Among them was a beautiful animal, for which Mr. D'Arcy refused 281. some time since. Holders of stock are, generally speaking, taking fair prices when they are offered, at last year they were obliged to sell at a fall on the prices offered in the rmorning. The weather is fine, and promises to continue so. "Bailnasloe, Thursday Evening. "A'er I forwarded my despatch this morning business went on briskhy, and the prime lots of the fair soon changed owners. There was a decrease in the number of cattle o: about 3,000 or 4,000, which, it is more than probabVe, influenced prices. The rates of last year would be an unsafe criterion to judgeby, as the Eunas paid for stock were considerably under what holders h,d a right ti expect, and, therefore, though an ad. vance took place to-day, it was not of a character to demand much ob-ervation. Whether it was that they had experience of last years prices or not, at aU events sellers were apparently we'l satisfied with what they cbtained. It is thought to have been under what cattle brought at the neighbouring fairs. On prime lots there was an advance establishtd of about L., and, on the whole, prices ruled from 10s. to 11. higher than last year. '- I ap; end a r. turn of the number of cattle at Ballinaslo s for the haut six years:- vlD lOsnk.

"On Tue-d.y (says the Whig) Mr. Gardiner, a gentleman holding a high position in connexion with the Customs in Dablin, arrived in Belfast under instructions th.t he was to leave no matter untouched lwhich could possibly explain the character of the fraud and robbery. This gentleman inmediately put himself in communication with some of the local magistracy, and opened a career o; examination of the most searching and determined character. hlr. Gardinerheld an interview on Tuesday with Mr. Tracy, who, although at present on leave of absence from official dut7es, takes a deep interest in this case, and also met Dr. ?I'Gee. These gentlemen took up the suog gestion which we published on Tuesday, and obliged the carman who conveyed Moore to Lisburn to appear before them. This person, we bave been given to understand on the best authority, gave someimportant information. It woulid be injudicious, at the pre ent stage of the inquiry, to disclose all the facts to which this p-rty testifies. Enough it Is to say that be has told some things that at some future day may enlighten the pubic. Now, the great question is as to the whereabouts of Moore. We have made a very close investigation among pers ns most likely to be well informed on the subject, and the Reneral imapression is that he has not left Great Britain and Ireland. This is the opinion of the ablest members of the police force after having studied the case wite gteat carefulness, aDd we have reason to believe that Mr. Gardiner is of the same opinion. This gentleman i, c.,nductiag the case with singular cauti-n and seoresy, and, at p: estnt, the leading point of the investiga. tion i sinip'y this-whether a case can be got up whioh would juatifyMr. Gardinm rad visirg the Customs'..uthorities todirect a detective offi :tr to proceed to the United States in search of Mloore. With tespeci to the whole of the transaction we have heard a ma-s of statements, the majority of which we cannot rely upon. But we have this before us, namistakeably, that there bas been an immense connivance in some leading circles in the tran%ation. We have had it confe sed to ns by one 'gentleman, that on the Thursday night prior to the information received by the police he met Moore in Bambridge's, and that there he told him.I 'By -, if you have tQuohed a cbest of my tea i'll make a sacrifice ot you ! Whether the chests of toa belonging to tbis, person, ao full of oommercial mereitTy, ware ' dtnimiet4' or no4, we have not beard, b'ut hB SugzEstion. is ftal of characteristic import. Bat, vhAs is this in cormpari,n with Harbison's statauent ? We must espect:JW 4t the atieution of IL, (GA2di. ner to the information that marbison cau supply. The great point of his knowledge is connected wisth Moore's counting-house books, bat there , as yet, some secrecy maintained in this part of the case. Mr. Harbison states that in Moore's counting-house books the purchasers of the teas are not specifically named, but that there are certain hieroglyphic characters in them which he oould easily reveal, and which afford curious revelations. Here we have at once a clue to the buyers of the teas which Mr. Gardiner must folloW up. Strange enough, amiid all the excitement which commnercial circles have manifested for the aI. prehension of Iloore, no reward has yet been offered for his =eis0re. The Belfast police issued on Tuesday the following notification : " ' [For Pollce Officers only.]-Robbery.-Description of Joohn James Moore, late of Belfast, in the county of Antrim, tea merchant, charged with stealing 800 chests of tea from one of Her Majesty's bonded stores in this town, and for whcse apprehension I hold a warrant:-He is about 35 yeas old, 5 feet 74 inches, well-formed. not corpulent, dark -hair, slightly bald on the head, thin sandy whiskers, red oval face, hollow cheeks, high cheekbones, large red nose; holds his head down when walkdng; has rather a Jaunty appearance ; wore a black frook coat and gray trowse Yr when last seen.

ANOTHER FEARFUL COLLIERY EXPLOSION NEAR BHARNSLEY.-Another of those fearful explosions, which are generally so destruotive to human life, but not accompanied by such results in the present instance, ocun-red in tha main pit at Highaso Commuon CoUieries, nsar Barasley, the property of Messrs. Cbarlesworth, at five minutes pa-t 2 o'clock on Wednesday morning last. Thereport was heard for several miles around, aud until noon hundreds of people assembled from the neighbouring vilages, anxious to learn the result, naturally expecting it to be attended by fearful loss of life. It soon became known there were but two persons in tbe pit, who were engaged as " cupola" attendants, and these were drawn ont alive about 6 o'clock, fortunately being only slightly bnrnt. There were ten valuable horses inside, aU of which were kiled. Twenty sets of tools were generaUy employed during the night shifts; but on account of Wednesday being appointed by proclamation for a soleman fast and humiliation, the nmen worling there did not descend the shaft on the previous night, or, in all probability, it would have been fatal to them. In another mine, close by, there were several men working the tbin bed of coal, who heard the explosion, bht, luckily for them, there was no communication between the pits. The explosion was so tremendous that it blew the plates and corves away from the Immediate vicinity of the pit's moutb, and partly destroyed the con. ductors. It is supposed that it wiU take three weeks or a month to complete the repairs before work can azain be commenced. Mr. Aineworth, the under steward, quesioned the two men, after they were drawn ont, Asto whether they had been out of their way or could account for the explo. sion, but they either could not or would not say how it occurred. If this explosion had occurred during midday, when aU the hands were at work, it would have been almost as serious as the late calamity at Lundhill.-Doncasur Gorcuc. COL2TY AND DismicT SuRVE,YOrS I 1iRELAND.- The report of the Select Committee of the Honse of Commons on this subject is now in print. The committee report that the institution of countv surveyors, under the Act 6th and 7th William IV., chap. 116, for the superintendence of county works, has been attended with great public advantage, both as regards the improvement of county roads And works, and as regards the economizing of the county funds. The mileage of roads under repair had increased from 13,191 miles in 1834 to 3G,073 miles in 1854. while the cost of reoDair had increa,ed only from 2211,3161. to 312,2971., and at the same time the percentage cost of superintendence was reduced materially mu almost every onnatv. The result, all thinRs considered, is regArded as highly satisfactory. An able and efficient clas of county officers has been formed, taking charge of nearly every coonty work, and controling an expenditure of nearly 500,0001. annually, and the co"'mittee opine that the time has arrived for reconsidering the office, both as regards its duties and its remuneration, with the view of placing it on the most efficient footing for the public 9ervice. It is thought that the surieyor ought to be supplied in every nwas with adequiate looal Assistants, as increase of salary being reoommended in both instances. The qnestion of allowing county surveyors to take private bosiness should he left (it is thought) to the discretion of the grand jury, Eight witnesses were examined At an expense of 1121.

JIR. HUTT, M.P., ON TZMPEBRANE. The Gateshead Temperance Union has been holding id annual zaeeings thi. week, which have ben attesde by the Hon. Neal Dow, of AAezlea, and other leading temperance advocates, Mr.. Hutt, the uanmber for the borough, presided at a morning sitting, and, after a breakfast in the hslU of the Mechanica' Inxtitution, in opening a somewhat interesting neetiDg, MLr. Ilt-r said, he had consented at the request of somC of his friends in Gateshead to preside on the occasion, from a wish to express his asypathy with those meritorious persons who were exerting themselve to eradicate from among us the vice of intemperance. He was also desirous to take t1e opportunity of offering some public manifestation of his sympAthy with their eause. (Loud applausem. Whether the vice of intemperance was more prevalent in the country now than in former periods of it history he would not pause. to examine. Whether that vice had its origin, s some aserted, among the northern nations, and arose from the coldness of this climate, and the want of those healthful outdoor -eceattons .which were enjoyed by the people of the South, he did not think it neccsErry non- to inquire. It was sufficient for him to know tbat intemperance existed in this country-that it existed to an appalling extent among the industrious and labouring classes, and that it was the source of more misery and crime than any other paasion in the whole catalogue of huunan infirmities. (Applause.) He would. not enter into any laboured process of argument to support these facts. He was sure that was not necessary. The proof Atared us in the face and met us at every turn, whatever direction we took. The masters of workhouses, the governor* of gaols, all concurred in telling us that it was intemperance which sent the most nuanerous and most Lopeless inmates. (Hear, hear.) We knew, and if we did not know, tbe records of our police officei vrould abundantly inform us, that thousands of English bouses which might be the harhours of parents and children i, possession of every enjoyment which this world could giv6 them, were converted by intemperance into scenes of constant sorrow and suffering, and not unfrequently of brutal outrage, and even murder. Such being the case, what were tbey to do ? Were they to do nothing in the face of such a calamity ? e asked those persons who were disposed to, depreciate asrociations of this kind-he asked those who smiled contemptuously upon the manly efforts of thepeople to work out their own regeneration-he asked, them whether it was wise, whether it was generous,. whether it was patriotic either to fold their arms inx despair, or to look on with indifference while this living pestilence-worse than Asiatic cholera-was desolating our country? (Loud aptlause.) Eortunately, that was not the' spirit in which Exnglibhmen, even under the worst circumStances, were disposed to encounter disasters or to confront' an opponent. StroDg in the instincts of self-reliance. they knewbow they were in the habit of closing with the enemy; and although in the first instance they might not go about the business in the wisest mknner-although they might not always choose the aptest means to attain their end, they knewthat with theirstrong oommon sense and their indomitable perseverance they would return again and again to the charge, and would ultimately accomplish it if that end were by any means at4ainable, (Loud applause.) Now, he was very glad of this opportunity of associating himself with them. (Applause.) At the same time they wouldpermit him to mal;e an explanation-an explanation which would in some degree anticipate the subject which he saw was set down in the paper for discussion. They would allow him to explain that in enlisting under their banner he did not mean necearly to adopt aU the expedients which he saw redommended for the promotion of their object. Public discussion, the force of public opinion, the strong appeals of working men to their fellow men-appeals from their base and destructive propenaities to their natural sense of selfdigrity and their obvious interests-associations of this hind for mutual encouragement and support, and for acting collectively by means of m tual pledges and obligations, the influence of education, and the higher and more sacred influences of religion-these, together with such aids as they might collect from the wisdom and experience of foreign nations, themselves suffering from the same cankerworm at the heart-all these measures he was ready to concur in and adopt; and it was to measures and to men of this stamp that he looked for effecting the enfranchisement of his country. (Loud applause.) But when he heard of legislative coercion and legLslative compulsion-when he heard of introducing into thbs country the liquor law of Maine, and of re-enacting in England the measures meditated in Sweden, he, for one, must rapudiate such auxiliaries fromn an utter distrust alike of their propriety and their efficacy. He perceived that this dootrine was not a popular one. (Cheers.) He must ask them, however, to bear with him a little. (Renewed cheers.) He wvas not in a position to indulge in speculation in lawr-making. His opinions, when adopted, necessarily resulted in acts, for which he was deeply and. permanently responsible. ( Hear and cheers.) An errorr in such a case was a crime, for it played with the happineas of millions. Good intentions would not do-honesty indeeds was not all that was requisite. He must come to his work with competent knowledge as well as with purityof purpose; and let him tell them that one of tte most important results impressed on his mind, after more than five - and - twenty years' study of politics and pradtical experience of public life, was this that force-which was the panacea of every blunderCr, and bsd been so at all times-was the very last eapedient to Mhich those would have recourse who had any real call or mission to meddle in the management of men. This sentiment, which he believed would be adopted by every manand there must be many present-placed at the head of a great industrial establishment; and it was not less true in the administration of Imperial affairs He might be told to look at the success which had attended the compulsory law in Maine. Here he might be permitted to remark that there was a good deal of discrepancy in the evidence as to that success. He ws well aware that highly sensible and zealous persons were of opinion that that law had answered all the purposes intended by its promoters; but he read the other day a very inteUigent little book, written by a member of Parliament (Mr. Baxtor). who had travelled in the country itself, and gathered facts and opinions upon the spot; and he asserted, on the other hand, that the Maine Law had failed, and faUed with consequences very libtle creditable to its promoters Bat he would not ti ouble them with argument on this matter. It was a subJEct on wbich he himself had no personal knowledge. He Mould only remark that even if the Maine Law had succeeded in Maine, and was perfectly welt suitel to the circumstances of that country, he did not think that fact v ould establish any proof that the same measure was snitable here; for it was a fact which mauy present knew wll, ti at there had existed for generatiors past, not only in Maine, but throughout the States of New England. a disFosition to encourage and submit to harsh and Drohibitory laws, such as would not be tolerated for an hour in the n eridian of Great Britain. Granting, therefore, to advocates and friends of the Malne Law all that thev askedperfectsuccL3s in the State of Maine-he did not think they would have established the position, even in that case, that such a law would be suited to England. On the other hand, he looked about him and saw what had been effected by the force of moral agency alone. He recollected that not many years had passed away since intemperance was the habitual vice of the upper classes of his countrymen. (Hear, bear. The time had not long passed when you might have seen educated men- gentlemen as they were called-moving about your streets in a state of intoxication and society not only not censuring them, but rather looking upon the exhibition as a proof of spirit and a mark of becoming conviviality. Fortunately these barbarous notions had yielded to the progress of moral effort (oheers); and might we not hope that this same moral gency, i mproved in character by past experience, supported by the general rogression of society, would lead us at last to the accomphshment of all our wishes and aspirations, and that we might by such means arrive at the day when the labouring population would have entirely abandoned these destructive propensIties I

FRANOE. (FOM OOB Ows oOmSroNxinT.) PARIS, OCT. 8, 6 P.br,. The meeting of the Emperors Napoleon and Francis Joseph, as an outward and vs{ble sign of the renewal of amicable feelings and intercourse between the two Courts, is still insisted upon, in quarters usually well informed, sa likely soon to take place. I have more than once expressed an oplnion that sucha an interviewv is by no meam improbable, and we have good reason to believe that efforts have been making, both by diplomatic and by Royal pereonages, to dissipate the coolnems between Paris and Vienna; but I have not at prement any positive information to add upon the subjeet. Various incidents, although not much out of the common course, may seem, by their occurrence near together, to indicate a probable reconciliation. Among them may be reckoned Baron Eubner's visit to ChAlons, the friendly assurances exchanged by Count Walewlki and the Austrian Representative with respect to the interview at Weimax; and those equally satisfactory, which we hear have passed at 'Vienna between ount Buol and Baron de Bourquenay, relative to that at Stuttgart. One thing certain i8 that if all the reconeillatlons which we are asaured are imminent or approaching be realized, the Governments of Europe w,ll before long form a happy faminly, within wbose circle animosity between France and Austria would shock and be greatly out of place. At Welimar, we are told, the Emperor of Russia, who is on excellent terms with his late gallant little antagonist, Piedmont paved the way for a resumption of diplomatic relations between that country and Austria. The Ring of Bavaria, we learn, qualified by his friendship with the Emperor of the French and by the projected marriage of his niece with the heir apparent to the Crown of the Two Sicilies, is about to exert hir, good offices to restore a friendly understanding between the Western Powers and the Court of Naples. These are the reports of the day, which we must not too hastily reject as unfounded, or even pronounce to be improbable. Notwithstanding one or two papers have denied that a circular was) sent by the French Foreign-office to French diplomatic agents abroad on the subject of the Stuttgart interview it appears certain that such a cirular ha been Aespatched. In thia, as I before remarked, there is nothing extraordinary or unusual; and the fact was noticed chiefly because the contents of the document--which have not been made public,but the tenourof which has transpired-confirmed the general and natural belief that the tendency of the interview it referred to was essentially pacific. It is Btill reported, but I have been unable to obtain confirmation of the report, that a circular note of the same kind has been sent by the Austrian Cabinet with respect to the Weimar interview. The E mperor is expected to return to Paris on Monday, and the camp will be raied, it is said, on the following day, to the great satisfaction, no doubt, of the hmperial Guard. The season is over for amateur campaigning; the weather has become wet and tempestuous. Paris is seldom much afflicted with high winds, but to-day it blows a gale, moistened with plashes of driving rain. We hear of bad weather in the Channel and on the French coast, and that two Russdan corvettes, and a Danish man-of-war of the same class, have taken shelter at Cherboulrg. It is reported that the Bank of France is about to raise its rate of disount. According to the Madrid papers of the 4th, the Ministers were remaining at their posts merely until their successors were appointed. It is presumable that up to yesterday such appointment had not taken place, or the telegraph would have informed us of the change of Government. The prolongation of the crisis ix quite in acoordance with the position Of affairs I yesterday Aketched to you, on the strength of information from Madrid. The Cabinet is moribund, but if its aony could be prolonged until the opening of the Cortes, that thewe might administer the coup de grace, it is believed to be what the Queen would prefer. The complications and intrigues that result from this state of things are enveloped in a myster that defies the penetration of the Puerta del Sot, and attended with piquant circumstances that stimu. late public curiosity. It is stated that on the night of the 3d the Queen was at the Zarzuela Theatre, where Madame Ristorl is performin with reat suecess. The Ministers were there E, an towards the end of the third act they went to the Queen's box, in the drawing-room in the rear of which a sort of council was held. This lasted until the end of the fourth act, when the Ministers took their departure and the Queen returned to her box. It used to be said of Espartero and his Progresista colleagues, who were very open and undisguised in their proceedings, that they transacted business In the street, but the fashion of holding private councilx in an opera-box is a still greater novelty. It was said that Mon and Bravo MunIlo had been telegraphed for by the Queen's orders (the former from Romo, the latter from Paris), but this has been contradicted by a Government organ, and is certainly not the case as regarcds Bravo Murillo, who started for Madrid merely in consequence of information he received as to the crtical state of affairs, and probably also with the idea that he might soon be wanted. The dissolution of the Narvaez Cabinet springs from dissensions among its members, and from the Queen's refusal to nominate certain person as Senators. A letter from Naples of the 2d of October mentions that the Royal family has left for Gaeta, where they proposed pasing the autumn. The Infante Don Sebastlin and his wife 5were about to establish themselves in a villa at Labarra (a viMage at the foot of Vesuvius) the air of that place having been recommended to the Princes, whose health is not good. Don Ferdinand de Bourbon, youngest brother of Montemolin and who is a colonel in the Austrian service, and the Carlist General Elio (the only man of note, besides Cabrera, who still remains atanch to the fortunes of the Spanish Pretender had accompanied them from Trieste to Naples. It was thought that the trial of the insurgents at Salerno would occupy a considerable time. A statement recently made by the Moniteur, that several steamers belonging to Neapolitan companies had been laid up for want of occupation, is contradicted by this correspondence, which gives some details concerning Neapolitan steamboat companies. Naples, it s , is the Italian port that has most steamers under the national flag. The Company of the Two Sioilles has six fine vessels; the Calabro-Siciliana has four; the Elica Company four others, which ply along the couat; while the Sicilian Company, which had two boats, has purchased a very fine one called the Etna, and pro ses to establish a service between Sicily and Malta. The last return published by the Customhouse shows, according to this letter, a great increase of trade, and the number of passengers by the different lines of steamers was never so great as during the lastyear. The writer, who is evidently somewhat a partisan of the Neapolitan Goernmnent and hostile to England, inveighs against the appointment (of which there was a strong report at Naples) of Mr. Fagan as English Consul there, and accuses that gentleman of having done aU in his power to keep up the irritation and antagonism between the two Governments, The Univers has the following remarks on the Day of Humiliation in Great Britain, and admits that England is still Christian, while deploring that she is not Catholic:- "' England offers to the world at this moment a nianfi. eent and noble example. An entire nation is doing penace, and is humbling itself] before God, imploring His pZr don for its faults, confessing thatits sins have brought about the evils which afflict it, and suppleting Ham for victory. This Is certainly a grand spectcle and solemln lon for the world. England-thet haughty rAtion, whose vesseLs cover the seea, whose empire extends over immense countries and over nearly three hundred million of souls-humbles herself before the Almighty, and promisce to act in future in a mnore Christian manner. This is certainly a grand example and we recognize in euch acts that the seeds of Chrlstlanit still exist among that nation; we foresee the glorious and adnirable deeds It might accomplish were it to devote the immense resources It derives from its daring and persevering genius to the cause of truth and justice. England of the 7th October, 1857, is Christin England; were England Catholic, we should believe In her salvatlon." A letter from larseilles, of the 7th instant, informs us that the expected visit of the Emperor to that town is adjourned to next spring. Africm wheat had fallen IL the hectolitre The eouthx-eat wind had brought into port a vast number of ships, which had been detained for several days on the coast of Spain by contrary winds. Among them are 10 ships laden writh oleanous seeds from the East. A violent thunder storm, followed by torrents of rain, was experienced at Marseilles on the 6th. The streets were flooded to the depth of several feet, and the water rushed from the Canebiere into the old port in foaming cascades. Accounts from Toulon stats that the line-of-battle ships Ulm, Prince Jerome, Tourvllle, and Austerlitz, at present in that port, are about to proceed to Brent. It is added, that a fleet of 10 fast-saIling steam line-of-battle ships I to be formed at Toulon next year, and to be placed under the command of Admiral Romain-Desfosase.

AUSThA (FaROx Oun OwN COnaWONDgqT.) VENTNA, Oem. 6. In Austrian official circles it is not believed that any question of high political importance was entered into at Weinar. The only diplomatist who accompaniedtheEmperorPranc>Josaphtothograndl ducal capital was Prince Richard Metternich, the Austrian Minister at the Court of Saxony * and it is morally certain that HIs Majesty would have taken with him a more experienced adviser had it been his intention to discus-s matters of moment with the Emperor Alexander sAnAd his Mfinisters. "The Monarchs," says an experienced statesman, " are reconciled, but their Governments are not yet on friendly terms, and consequently any more intimate relations between the two empiresa are foz the moment entirely out of the question." Reliable private information has been received that the two Emperors, after having expressed a hope that they should speedilymeet again, took a most affectionate leave of each other. A story has been told by some of the German correspondents of the Emperor of Austria having driven about in a little pony chalse with the children of the Grand Duke, but the truth of the matter is, that his Royal Highness drove his illustrious guest home in a very low carriage which he, for reasons best known to himself, particularly affects. Two persons of my acquaintance who were in Weimar while their Majesties were there state that they were very well received, " and more particularly the Emperor of Austria." On inquiring why such was the case the reply received was that the Interview between the Emperor of Russia and the Emperor of the French had produced an extremely disagreeable impreeslon on the Germans, "4 as they strongly suspect the la9tter of having formed plans for improving the north-estern and eastern frontiers of France at the expense of Germany." It is whispered that the question of the evacuation of the domains of the Church is likely tobe brought into strong relief. The French Government talks seriously of withdramwing its troops from Rome, and if It should do so the Austrians would naturally be expected to retire from Ancona and Bologna. Now, the Austrian Governnment farmly believes that there would be dissurbances in Italy if its forces were withdrawn from the Papal States, and you may therefore soon expect to hear that attempts have been made to persuade the French to prolong their stay at Rome. My own opinion on the mubjecan opinion founded on information which hag from time to time been received from intelligent foreigners residing in Italy-is that if the Papal Government were to make the reforms suggested by France and England there would be no danger of an outbreak It is true that the feeling in the Papal Legations is very hoetile to this Government, and it will not appear surprldng that such is the case if it is considered that for almost anine years their inhabitants have had to defray the greater part of the expenaes of the Austrian corps of occupation. As the Austrian forces in Bologna and Ancona have been considerably reduced, Hlis Holiness has issued orders that the sum to be raised this year in the Legations for providing quarters for the foreign troops shall be 150,000 saudi less than it was in 1856. The Austrians affirm that Prince Murat's party is still extremely active in Naples, and place little confidence in the assertions of the semi-official French papers that the Paris Cabinet knows nothing about the matter. You will readily conceive that this Government is more opposed than ever to any interference in the internal affairs of Naples on learning that the Duke of Calabria, the heir to the Neapolitan thrbne, is likely to marry the Duchess Maria of Bavaria, who ia a younger sister of the Empress of Austria. It is stated that the betrothal will take place at Ischl, and it appears probable that the report is correct, for the Duchess of Bavaria arrived there yesterday with fiy of Iae- children. !It Ia further said that Francis de Paula, Count of Trapani, who Is now in Germany, will act as the proxy of his nephew tho Duke of Calabria. Of the Danubian irincipalities it is only necessary to say that the Union question will be settled by the Paris Conference, and probably to the satisfaction of all parties, excepting sol.e few ambitious Boyards1 who so strongly desire the union of the two provmnces in order thLat there may be a regular Court, at which they, as a matter of couse, would be the principal digmitaries. An Englishman who some time since went to the Principalitiee wih a high idea of the patriotism of the Boyards is now of opinion that that quality is known to themu only by name. " The majority of them," says he, " are so corrupt and unprincipled that they would sell their country and themselves for a title or an order, or for something more substantiaL" The French Commisioner, in obedience to the instructions which he received from his Government, after the visit of the Emperor Napoleon to Osborne, has recently kept himself ia the background, and will probably oontinue to do so during the remainder of his stay in the Principalities. From Jassy we learn that Sir Henry Bulwer and M. de Basily (the Russian Commisaioner) arrived there on the 27th of September, and informed the Divan ad hoc that they had been appointed by the European Commission to communicate with and learn from it the wishes of the Moldavian nation. The two delegates were to be back in Bucharest on the 6th or 7th inst., but it is highly probable that they will be detained at Jassy much longer than was expected. There have been serious disturbances in Great and Small Dibra, which are inhabited by the most turbulent people in Central Albwnia. The Dibranese are Chriians who have never objected to serve the Pashas as volunteers, but they not long snce took it into their heads that they would no longer obey a Mahomedan chief; they accordingly expelled the Turkish commander, and elected one of their own people. This unceremonious way of proceeding was not to the taste of Achmet Pasha, the governor of Roumelia, and he accordingly marched with a powerful corps againt the Dibranewe. it mttt be suppoed that Achmet Pasha had no t nreducing them to order, for we ave heard nothing more of his campalign than that ho took possession of Dibra, and removed the Government of Central Albania from Ohrida to that place. The Pasha of Scutari has sent his troops against the rebellious inhabitants of Vasovitz and thoy have no choice but to surrender at d7sretion a Prince Daniel, of Montenegro, has declined to interfere on their behalf. According to the Agram Gazette the new regular corps which has been formed in Montenegro has received the grandiloquent appellation of "L La Garde." The Emperor's name-day was celebrated at Ischl [on the 4th en famQie, but here a grand military mas was read on the glacis and the Te Deum sung in the cathedral. His Majesty received from the Grand Duke of Welmr the Grand Croms of the Order of the Falcon, and the same distinction was conferred on Prince Alexander of Hesse. In a few days the Archduchess Sophia will go from Isehi to Milan to visit her second son, the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian ldngdom. It isreported that the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilia and his bride will go at the end of this month to Spain, but it is not very likely that he will leave his Government again so soon. The Archduke has contributed 1,500 lire to the fund for the relief of distressed artists. Such matters are here kept very secret, but there is good reason for believina that the Austrian cavalry regiments are still on a war footing. Baron Bruck is said to be much depressed, and he will probably be stiU more so a couple of months hence, when he has the State balance-sheet before him. The expenditure has been enormous this year, and it is evident that people here do not know the real value of money. The railroad between Verona and Botzen in the Tyrol will be completed by October, 1858. It is definitely settled that the Sulina offers greater advantages to navigators than either of the other arms of the Danube. Dr. Jugschwert, the defaulter, has never quitted the walls of Vienna. ITALY. (FROYM OUR OWN COBRsEOND.) TURM, 0er. 6. The time was once, and not very long since either, when England and English politics were the bugbear of every despotic Government in Europe. In this respect, however, a change appears to have come o'er the spirit of their dream latterly, for it is inow almost invariably a vison of the Emperor Napoleon IIL that disturbs their repose, and even when they venture to indulge in fanciesof atriumvirateof Csars to dispose of the destinies of the OldWorld they seem haunted now by fears Iesttlm.renchEmperor should play the part of Augstus to his colleagues' Lepidus and Antefy. What reason really exists for this suspicious jealousy of the present dynasty of France -how much it is based on solid grounds, and how much it is attributable to the consciences of the Governments themselves-are points that can only be clearly resolved by the future probably, but ia the meantime it is posslble and useful to watch the present sayings and dolngs on both sides, so as to catch a glimpse of what they may actually fear or hope from passing events. In a letter from your Vienna correspondent, dated " Vienna, September 29," it is stated that the Austrian Government " evidently suspects the French Cabinet of having formed plans unfavourable to the rule of Austria in Lombardy ;" and the writer goes on to say that " many of the principal Lombard nobles went to Paris shortly before the Governor-General made his entry Into Milan, and almost al those who are now in the city keep aloof from the Archducal Court." It must be concluded from this information that the Austrian Government attributes the absence of the Lombard nobility from the Viceregal Court to French intigue, but it appears from the accounts received thence in this country that since the Archduke's ssumption of his government his Court at Milan has been attended by precisely the same persons who paid their respects to the Empsror, neither more nor less. Personally there does not seem to be any dislike felt on the Dart of the, Lombard nobility towards either the Emperor Francis Joseph or his brother the Governor-General, and the comeliness of both the Empress and the Archduchess Charlotte has produced its natural effect on the warm temperament of ItaLians of all classes; but stmll the Lombard aristocracy have got it into their heads that, were they to give any evidence of contentment with the present state of government, deprived as they are of all participation in publi affairs, and even prohibited from the right of petition, It might be used as an argument against them hereafter, and mlight tend to mislead those to whom it is most difficult to convey the truth-the Sovereign and his immediate representative, and therefore I am inclined to think that their obstinacy on the subject of attendcing Court is of older origin than any modern French intrigue, and is so deeply rooted that it will hardly give way even before the benevolence, charity, and hospitality of the young Governor-General, or the well meant and impartial observattons of your own correspondent. A to whether the Austran Government is right or not in suzpecting the French Cabinet of plans againEt is dominion in Lombardy 1 eannot venture to offer an opinion- I only mean to eay that the absence of theULombard aristocy from the Viceregal Court of the Archduke Ferdinand does not appear to me as any proof of French Influence. At the same time it muat be reeollected that the whole of the Autrian Ital sa provinces are in a chronic state of discontent, and are in consequence at all times ready to listen to the promptings of any enemy of Austria who is possessed of a good standing army. In the south of Italy the suspicions of French intrigue and conspiracy are no less conspicuous than in the north. A few days since the Cattolico pub- lished a long letter in the French language, bearinv the signature of "Charles Garnier," and addressed to M. Lizabe Ruffoni, the private secretary of Prine Lucien Murat, who you may recollect published a manifesto of Muratist politics some time back, to which the letter of "Charles Garnier" is intended sa reply. " Charles Garnier," if he has an incarnate existence, is supposed to be some French Legitimist employed by the Neapolitan Government to subscribe his name to such documents as the present letter; but it is more generally thought that the signature, like that of "Lumley de Woodyear,which is usually appended to letters of a similar nature on Piedmontese or English affairs, is merely a name without a local habitation. "Charles Gamier," however, be he what he may -spirit, or man, or demon-openly accuses the Muratiss of conspiring to create a revolution at Naples, and the Emperor of the French of permitting, if not of aiding them; and he repeats the story told of what occurred at the marriage of the son of Prince Lucien, when the Almoner of the Emperor, Monseigneur Menjaud, Biahop of Nancy, pronounced a benediction on the newly. married.couple, and told the bridegroom to draw the sword of his grandfather. The Emperor of the French, "Charles Garnier" says, was consulted as to whether this speech of his Grand Almoner should be pub. lished in a certain journal, and that he put the manuscript in his pocket, saying, " The time has not come yet, it will do for by and by." " Yes," says Charles Garnier, " it will do for by and by," and every one can see that it needs but one word from the Emperor to silence MAL Lucien and Joachim Murat; but this word " Charles Gamier" is convincd will never be pronounoed, and he accepts the publication of the manifesto of Lizabe Rusffoni as a proof that it never will be, and therefore he, "C harles Gariler," alias " the Neapolitan Government," takes the' occasion of replying to the Muratist manifesto through the columns of the Caftico. The Parmu Gazette publishes the new Customhouse tariff, which is to come into operation on the cessation of the Austro-Parmesan Customs' League, on.the 31st of the present month. The same paper announces that the applications for shares in the Stradella and Piacenza Railways by Parmesan subjects had amounted to 2,139-i, e, 1,430 for Piacenza, and 709 for Parma. There has been an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. A letter from Naples says:- "On Thursday we had one of tho finest eruptions of Vesuvius posdble to be seen. Towards 7 xv night the crater appeared all on fire, long fames muddenly arose from it, then the lava gushed forth, on a very broad surface and with very grt rapidity, in the direction of the Posne delle Farons, and In leas than three hours it had ran over all the distnos that sepates the crater from the Atrio del Cavallo, the place where stand the Vesuvian Observatory and the famous bermitage which serve as * refute for travelleza of all countries, for no foreigner comes to Naples without making the aswent of Vesavius. Thanks to the fLne mountain road the Government has had made, you can ascend It seasilyin three bours A the quays of Napleg were throngd with people, admiring this beautiful eruption."
REGISTRATION. CITY OF LONDTho. the Bevisn Bauister, Mr. T. Y. WCERisTIX, resumed therevision of the electoral list for the city of London yesterday at Guldhall. Mr. S. Smith and Mr. Ledger appeared, as before, to support the Liberal interest. Mr. W. David, of 112, Alderpgate-street, claimed to be placed upon the register. MiMr. P r, the parish representatIv, said, the clAimant had not C.n duly rated. Mr. Davis said, he was the occupier of the hounse, had held it for several yes, and had always pald the rates. He had no Idea that he ras not upon the register until the Iast elec. tion, when, having uigneda declaration affecting a particular candidate, he was informed tkat he ws no elector. Mr. Piper explained that Mr. DavYxs daughter, at tbat gentleman's especial ruest, had been entered in the rate- oo, and the rates h been paid in her name, the object being, as was understood, to relieve lr. Davis from the liabl ty of filling certain parish offices. Mr. Davis denied that he had any such intention, or had ever desired the rating to be in his dsaughter's name. Mr. Piper said, as soon as Mr. Davis nade a cbim his name was duly entered in the rate-book, and he would be placed upon the register next year. The REVISING BinISrTx decided that as the house In respect of which the claim was made had been rated in an. other name than the claimant's during the period prescribed by the Act he could not entertadn the claim upon the pre. sent occasion, but having given notice to the overseers It would be good npon the next ocasdon In another parih two persons appeared upon the list of voters whose residences were given respectively as Richmond and Walthamstow, both of which places are beyond the preacribed limits of seven mniles from the city. Both names had been objected to, and The RLTIsroBs'nsxiBITrR expunged them. Mxr. S. SBaTH thought the vestry clerks ought not to place p:ersons upon the list who wrere obviousy dis- The Veet2y Clerk said, in the instances referred to he be. lieved the parties had residences within the prooer limits, but htd only given those which had bean lnse*ed in the The >vIsm-oBsAR z was of opinion tat If a rson retumed himself as lving beyond the seven miles t was the duty of the prish ofilcers to recognize that fAct, and to omnithi namne from heir list.ta acvadt The lists of several other parishes were disposed of with. out the ozourrenee o anything worthy of notice until the lst of the parish o St. James's, Dues-place, had been revised, when The Vestry Clerk begged to call the attention of the Re. vising Barrister to the diBculties which were thrown in the way of himself and his brother officials in preparing the lists by reason of the incorrect and irregular mode of numbering the houses in the streets of L*ndon. In one small aquare in his parish containing about 20 houses there were half a dozen No. l's and two or three No. 's. In another street in the same parish houses were numbered without regard to order or sequence, and sometimes doubly numbered, one house being called 8 snd 19. It would be a vast publio convenience if some uniform mode of numbering could be ado pted. e RxvIsto BARRismR quite conourred in the oploi, just expressed, and thought it most desible that some ste should be taken by the proper authorities to remove tho existing inconvenzinoe. Mr. LXDGZR said, the matter was not within the pwer of the parish authorities, but rested with the Commissoners of Sewers of the City of London. In the country these matters came within the power of corporations, and at Birmingham, private persons who had placed polished brass numerals or gilt figures upon their doors redsted the intrusion of the corporation who affixed ugly cast iron numerals, but after a stern oontest were compelled to submit. The REswISIN BAiRuISrE thought It was quite necessary that some authority should deal with the matter, as in consequence of thepresentimperfect and uncertain mode of numbering houses he had been compelled frequently to disranchise persons who ought to have been placed upon the register, aimply because their qualification could not be distinctly identified on account of the double or doubtful numeration. In the parish of St. Catherine Cre, M Mr. G. Lyon claimed to be placed upon the register In rezect of his occupation of 52, Leaden-all-street (Sussex- Mr.DAVIS, a gentleman who attended to support the claim, said, that Mr. Lyon wras the Secretry of the JeSw' ,Insttuteheldat Sussex-hall,andthat in that capacity he occupied apartments on the premises, and the accommoda. tion thus afforded to him formed a portion of his remunera- Mr. S. S;M, in support of the claim, called the atten. tion of the learned barister to the circumstance that residence upon the premises was no part of the clatmant's duty, and was not therefore compulsory. The REVISLNG BARRISTER elicited from the witness that the property was held in the name of the presidont of the institution, by whom the rates were paid, and who had required hIr. Lyon to rde upon the spot, and thereupon held that, as it appeared that Mr. Lyon had been required by his employers to reside upon the premises, and ever since his, appointment had done so, such occpation could not be held suficient to give, a qualification. Claim disallowed. In the parish of St. Margaret Pattens a claim to be registered was allowed, although the claimant's name had not ceen entered in the ratobook, as according to the vestry clerk there had been no rate made since April, 1855, and then only a 3d rate. The RxVISING BARRIBTrE asked if there were any poor in the parish, and, if so, how were they provid d for 1 The Vest Clerk sad, there were a few poor, who were provided for from funds derived from estates wrhich had ben left to the parish tifo or three centuries hack. It was intended soon to make a rate, in order to keep a roll of the inhabitants of the paris, which was a very small one, only containing 22 or 23 houses. In the parish of St. Margaret, Lothbury, Mr. Joseph Perkins, a member of the Common Connoil, and overseer of the pariah, appeared upon the list in respect of a house and gstewa, 8, Bank-build Mr. S. Ssmr objeced to the name of Mr. Perkins being retained. Mr. Perkins stated the nature of his qualification. He held the house, 8, Bank-buildinp, and paid the rates and tixes, but he let out the whole of the premises except the gateway, which he oonodved was valuable and gave hii a qualification. He claimed exOlusi o right over the gateway, and had been paid for the privileg of using it. Mr. S. Smrra obeerved that if the old maxim cujus cd solum U cat usqw ad calum was to prevail, Mr. Perkins would be an intrnder, sad the gItewway would belong to the occnpants of the cellar& (A laugh.) Mr. Perkins said, if Mr. Smith would talk plain English every one could understand him. He elaimed in respect of what he considered to be a valuablb property The iRVIsIrG BARaSTRx said, ths point had been several times before hlin, and he had deoided then, as he must do now, against Mr. Perldkns. e wished to know whether that gentleman would undertake not to renew the claim next year, and be satis6ed with the present decision ? Mr. Perkins was not satisfied with the decision, and thought the Court ought not to require him to make any promise as to his future roceedina r. S. S:elrrH remarke that 3fi. Perkins being overseer had plaed his own name on the register, and had thereby exposed himself to the infliction of a fine for improperly entering au unqualified person upon the list, notwithstanding the point had been decided on five or six previous occa- sions, The PxvISl,TG Bs4RRTSTnR Mad, he should impose a fine of 11. uApon Mr. Perkins for improperly entering his name upon the hst, but he should not enforce the fine, although ;ntil it was p!aid Mr. Perkins could not be heard in that court. Mrr. P-erkins protested against the decision as an arbitrary stretch of powver, and said he certainly should not pay the fine.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~f The name was then expungod. In the parish of St. Michael, Bassishaw, Mr. Butler claimed in respect of offices in Basinghallstreet. His residence was at Glengall-cottage, Shooter'o. hill, beyond theoeighth mile stone; but upon refereneo to the Ordnance map it was found upon the horizontal plane to come a few yards within seven rile of the city verge, laaim allowed.
DINNEB TO TBE RO.N. F. LYGON, M.P. FOR TBWKESBUBY. On Thursday the Hon. F, Lygon, ILP., wAs entertained at a publio dinner at the Swan Inn, Tewkesbury, by the Conservative electors of that borough, acting in oonnexion -with the Conservative AsoiAtions of the town and of the oounties of Glocester and Worceter. The primacy object of the demonstration wa to celebrate the retSirn of Mr. Lygon at the late election; but the oommittee were deirou to give it more than a merely local Interest, and with that view sent invitations to the Earl of Ellenborough, Lord Bedesdale, Sir John Pakington, and others, Neither of the two noble lords nor the right hon. gentleman, however, was present, though up to Ma adnAnoed hour of the day the former were confidently expected to attend. Among the noblemen and gentlemen present were Earl Beauchamp and Lord Elmlcy, M.P., the father and brother of the hon. member for Tewkesbury; Mr. W. Dowdeowell formerly M.P. for Tewkesbury ; Sir E. Lechmere, the ron' W. Coventry, Mr. Brocklehurst, MP. for Mscolesfield - Mr. Baker, of Thorngrove; Captadn Coventry, Mr. Weaver: &c. The chair was occupied by Mr. DowdewAell, and MrWeaver acted as vice-president. About 200 gentlemen sat down to dinner. The CnAIRmu, In the course of some introductory remarks, expressed his regret at the absence of the Earl of Ellenborough and other noblemen and gentlemen who had been invited, and added that he was not surprised that the noble Earl-whoes mind and heart must be deeply engrossed with the condition of India, where he had held the high post of GovernorGeneral-should be disinclined to state his views in an after dinner speech upon a matter of such vast importanoe and interest to the country. He then proposed the usual loyal and national toasts, which were drunk with great oordiality. Earl BEAucBJmP, In returning thanks for the army, maid it was to him a matter equally strae and inoomprehenadble that the native Bengal army, whice had no real grievances to complain of, should have been guilty, not only of mutin, but of the murder of unoffending woomen and children. H hoped the day of retribution was near at hand, and that the mere telegraphic announoment that 40,000 men wre n their way from this country to India would have the effeot of restoring order and peace. But what was to be done witth the mutinous and murderous epoys t It was impossible, after embruing their hands in the blood of our oountrymen, that they could be allowed to remain where they were. tCheers.) He hoped some uninhabited island would be iounL to which they could be transported, there to remain for the rest of their lives under the restraint of British rule. Captain CAiNDLxm returned thanks for the navy. The ' Ealths of the Bishop and Clergy of the Diooeoss was prosed by the CnAxmssw, and responded to by the Rev. w. T. TREoARTUS who, in the name of the clergy, tbanked Mr. Lygon for the opposition he gavo in Parliament to the passing of the Divorce Bill The C iuaIA then proposed " The Health of the Hon. F. Lygon, the Conservative member for the borough of Tewkesbury," and spoke in high approbation of the oourse pursuedby the hon. gentleman dunng the short time he had been n Parliament. Se rejoiced to see him and his brother Lord Eimley in the Housc of Commons, tor there wao no better school for the sons of peers, who badimportant'duties to fulfi throughlife, than that assembly It was said the present Rouse of Commons poesessed ow young men of talent; but he claimed at least for tbe borough of Tewkeshury the honour of having returned one who was distnguished for talent, activity, and perseverance. The health of l£r. Lygonwas drnk witk every demon. stration oE enthusiasm. Mr. LyGoNo on rising was received with vehement oheering. After some preliminay observations, he said there were various reasons which led to his having been so favourably received by the people of Tewkesbury at the late election. One of these was the name he bore, and the honourable distinction acquired by those of his family who had gone before him, for it was believed that he would never stoop to disgrace that name, or to abuse the confidenoe that was reposed in him. (Cheeras) But another reason why he was received so franlcly and cordaly was, that there existed between him and the Conservative electors that whioh formed the strongest bond that could unite men together, vix., the same wishes and the same autipathieg in regard to all that concerned the welfare of the commonwealth. (Cheers.) They were often asked what were the principles of Conservatism? To this one ehort answer niight be given, that the supDorters of Conservative principles were those who ii the main were satisfied with the instutions of old England, and who, though they were willing that repain should be made in the fabric, were eontent to take shelter under the covering which those institutions afforded them. (Cheers.) The object of the Censervatives was to preeerve rather than destroy, not for the sake of this or thAt clas, but to obtain for al the benefits of those institutions we had received from our forefathers, and which we were determined to hand down to posterity (hear, hear), not from any selfish wish or from any desire ox self-aggrandizement, but because they believed that by those institutions the happinese of all was promoted to a greater degree tham oould be seoured by any other mens. (Cheers.) With reference to the proceea. ings in the House of Commons during the past ession, he need hardly say that they were compartively of an unexciting description. The state of parties ad been so pecu. liar, the position of Lord Palmerston so anomalous, that the political orizon remained in a very confused stAte, so that it was Impossible at any tine to prognosticate what mtght occur, Of this, however, they mtht be assured, that whatever was the state of parties in the House of Commons he L would remain steadfast to those prinoiple which they had sent him there to maintain. They would excuse him, perhaps, for making one remark with reference to a point ou which he thought it was necessry to caution constltuences. Some members were anxious that their names bhould appear on every dvision list He could not consider that to be a wise course. (Hlear, hear.) There were many questions which he had heard debated at length in the Houe of Commons, and then wralked out of the House without gIing any vote upon them wrhatever. He had felt that there were questlons which he coald not decilde for himself, and in which those whom he most trusted were divided in opinion, and on such occasions he iad felt it his duty to abstain from voting altogetber. (Hear, hear.) As a new member, he thought he was best serving his constituents by doing all in his power to learn the forms and rules of the House, so as to fit himself, if possible, for becoming a useful member hereafter. (Hear, hear.) As an instance of the chaotio state of parties, he might mention the subject of vote by ballot, on which one portion of the Ministers went into one lobb7 along with the Conservatire members, and another portion went into another lobby. Trhiwas an instance of what he meant when he spoke of the poitlcaxl horizon being In a confused condition, so that members were often em. barrassed as to how they should act. He had always, how. ever, endeavoured to give an honest vote. (Cheers.) A question of greAt importance last session was that of the admission of Jews to Parliament. Now, whatever might be the intrinsic merits of that measure, tbere could be but one opinion with aU who wished to support the institutions of te country, that any attempt on the part of one branch of the Legslature to coerce another into pasing It would be a revolutionary course. (Hear.) The Hous of Lords was entitled to its share in the legislation, and that right should be most scrupulously preserved aud guarded, ana by none more than by the House of Commons. (Hear.) He might say that he had had some very hard work as a member of the House of Commons, and the truth was, that every one who entered that House with a wish to take part in Its affiLrs must be prepared to go through an amount of hard work which very few persons were accustomed to bear. (Hear.) There were two questions looming before us with whioh Parliament would have to deal in the next sesdon. It would be unwise in him to give any rash promises when he might possibly hear many arguments and facts adduced that might alter opinions prematurely formed; but if any measure was introduced for a further reform of our Parliamentary representation it would bo the duty of the Conservative party to consider whether In 1832-very grievous injustice was not done ti depriving property of its legitimateinflaence (cheers); and surely those who contended that there shoula be no taxation without representation were also bound to remember that property was entitled to be fairly represented. (Hear, hear.) He could not imagine what the plan of the Government might be, and all he could say was that it would receive from him an honest and fair consideration. Inxreferenoe to the right of representation that attached to property, great injustice was In 1832 done to the Conservative interest. (Hear, hear.) Those who possessed property were, in the main, Conservatives, becamte they knew well what would be the effect of changes that led to a loosening of the social fabrio; they knew that ooniusion and disorder and evils of every kind flowed from cvil convulsion, and therefore they were dispoeed to give their best support to Conservative prinotples. IHear, hear.) With regard to the other question that lay before them, and which now thrilled through every heat_that of India-it was only a truism to say that whore there had been so many horrors, so much misfortune, and so munh deceit and treachery, there must be some one to blame. (Hear, hear.) Whether that blwnie rested with fu ~iven_ n of Tindia or the Goenmn athmei the Government of lndia or the Govern_ment at h`ome-it would be the duty of Parliament at some future time to investigate (cheers); and he trusted that those who by their negligenoe, or by their procrastination in sending out reinforcements, had caused the loas of precious lives, would receive that punishment they dessrved (chees), and that we would visit with the strongest condemnation those who from fainthearkedness or neglect had, he would not say caused, but had not prevented, the progress of these horrible disasters (Hear, hear.) He was happy to express his concurrence in what fell from his father as to the measures to be adopted towards those misguided and unhappy men, the Sopoys, who, having eaten our bread and been on terms of friendly intercourse with us, had turned round and perpetrated these unheard-of atrocities. He hoped some measure would be taken to withdraw tbese men from scenes that must necessarily be associated in their minds with their bloody triumphs, and to give them an opportunityof worldng out in another land some reparation for the atrocities which, perbaps, in a moment of excitement they had been led to perpetrate. (Hear.) With regard to foreign politics, he would say the less we had to do with them the better (cheersY-the better for England as well as for forelgn States. In very few cases, indeed, was It a wise thing to give advice to a neighbour. The very fact of having given the advice was enough for him not to take it (a laugh), and it was much the same with nations. Foreign nations had the same keon sense of national honour with ourselves, and it was therefore most unwise in us to interfere with thom. So long as England did so she would have to maintain a semi-hostile attitude towards foreign Powers that could not be beneficial eitber to those Powers or to England herself. (Hear, hear.) Anything he could say on this point would be incomplete if he did not allude with great respect to the example which the Emperor of the French had set to all Europe in labour. ing to promote the internal prosperity of his empire, rathor than indulging in dreams of solf-aggrandizment, , bear.) The hon. gentleman, after thanklng tha meeling for their kinduess, sat dowm amid loud dhsem The CHAIRMA, =inDropoasig The health of Earl Beu. champ," said, the leding organ of the pr4 which one hal of tham abuwd, but which they were all unbappS Hi tley did not see daily, had in one of its leading artolea urd upon the country gentlemen the duty of promoting *alisment among their labourers and the people arouna them. It was all very weU to talk to their tenants and work3ople, but the noble Earl (Beauchamp) bad put hls sonain the army. Following the eample wrhich his father had set with regard to himself, the noble Earl placed his eldeet sons InBer aesty's service. Thisha a practical mode of meeting a difficulty that would be more effectual In leading the tenantb to oin the army than any other that could be devised. The health of the noble Earl and the House of Lords was drunk- with great applause. Earl B&AUCHuAP returned thanks, and observed that the House of Lords, though not a representative body, gloried in sympathizing with the pole. Mr. BAKE proposed "The Conservative represniative of Woroestershire coupled with the name of Lord FImley," which was drunk with all the honours. Lord ELMLEY reaponded to the toast. He sid, all elasees were sareed that speedy and rigorous justioe should be m ade to overtake the mercileps rebels of India, and that order and government should he restored without delay but it lay with the Conservative pert especially to anal7e the eondtuct of the Government. Events passed so quickly that the opinions expressed a couple of months ago had very lttle relation to the state of matters now existing in India. If theY read the speechea delivered by members of the Government in Parliament two mouths ago, they would be astonished at the prognostlcations then pnt forth with refe. reoce to India, and they would form but a very poor opinion of the information which the Government posessed. (Hear, hear.) They had underrated the danger, just as Lord Aberdeen and his Government underrated the dangers of the wussan war. (Hear, bear.) So llttle did Lord Aberdeen believe there would be war that return tickets -were issued to the Guards to bring them back to 2dalta. (A laugh.) He was afraid there had been too much of the ame spirit in the present Government, But though he did not see much foresight on the part of tho Government, he had no doubt whatever that the dbispline and courage of the British army would carry us through all our troubles in India. (Cheers.) With reference to his Parliamentary conduct, he might say he had almost invarably voted with the Conservative party, beheving that prties were necefary in the carrying out of any great obh iet. It was said the Conservative party were not united Ut was the Government united? Let the voteS on the ballot lad Mr. Looke Kings motion answer. The Govern. ment, in fact, was like a house divided against itself, and kept from tumblng to pieces by Consenvtive props. " The Health of tne Chairman' was proposed by Earl Beauchamp, and acknolledged by that gentleman. " The House of Coventry and the Ron. W. Coventry," the health of Sir E. LeIhmere, of Mr. Weaver, the Vice. Chsb,nan, and other toasts were also given, but the observations with which they were pref^d and responded to had all a purely local referenoe. The party separated shortly before 10 o'clock.
LOBD HARBY VANB, M.P., IN SOUTH DURUA 5. (Fnour oUR oWN COBBRoSiOhxD}:n.) The Barnard Castle Agricultral Society, which claim to be the oldest of its lind In the oountry, held its annual meeting on Tuesday. At the dinner, held at the King's Read Inn, Lord HArzy Vane, Id.P., presided, taking the place of the Dake of Cleveland, K.G., who was prevented attending through indisposition. In proposng "the Army and Navy," The noble Lord Prid, A lthonhthis eoat followwed the comnpliment paid to Royalty as a matter of oouse he felt that at the present moment it was one which would be received with deep interest. (Applause,) If ever there ws a time when Englishmen should hold their army In high honour and show their appreciation of its merits, that time was the present, when, in small numbers, surrounded by myriads of enemies, they had exhibitod the moat herlo -alour and a constancy unassalable, braving every danger and maintaining the British flag unsuied (Applause.) At a moment of such great and paramount interest Englishmen must be prepared to award to their army and navy more than the aocustomed honour. We had at all times been accustomed to see those services perform their duty in a manner to command the admiration of England and of the world, and more than ever was it now admitted by al nations that an army could not have acquitted itself more honomrably than did our brave feUows who had had to make a stand against such fearful odds on recent occasions (Cheem) We were led to anticipate that when a larger number of troops had been assembled our prestige would be vindicated, and that the amy wotld be able to sustain everywhere the renown it had so bonourably aoquired. He called upon the company to drink "to the Army and Navy," with three tines three. (Drunk with enthusiasm.) Major A OGXw, an old Peninsular offioer, and now in the Commissariat IDepartment, responded. He had een halt the Indian army embark, and a iker body of men never left Britain. He was quite sure that when taken into action they would do their duty as the old fellows had done before thexa. (Cheers.) The CHAIRxAI- proposed the toast of the evening,-vlz., -Suouess to the Society," and in doing so referred to the present satisfactory state of the arcultural interest and ot the country generaly. Thia no doubt was a time of gloom, owingto thgreat calamitywhichhadbefallenusinourdistnt pomsessions, and which hadplungedinnunLerablefajimili into mourning. This terrible insurrection now wholly occapied public attention, direrted capital, and carried off our outh to recruit the army, thus narrowing the labour marlet. But through the mercy of a benefioent Providence an abundant harvest had been safely housed, and the country generally was in a state of prosperity; while, as to India though we must, according to late news, be prepared for some disasters, he felt every confidence that those dissters would be amply repaired and the honour of this country fully vindicated. Our brave soldiers, he was sure, would maintain the British flag; triumphant and crush all enemies, and in a few months tranquillity, firm and consohdated, would be restored to the British empire. (Applause.) A variety of A other toasts weref proposed, and all the alluions to the prosent crisis were of the most oonfident character,
MB. MOFFATT, A.P., ON THE rhDIAN MUT2IRIE& Mr. Moffatt, MP., attended a publlo meeting of his con. stituents at Ashburton a few days ago, according to annual custom, " to give an account of his political stewardship." In the couse of his speech, nearly all of whiob related to the Indian crisis, the hon. gentleman said,-Since the matinies, which had filled all men's minds with wonder, he had beard some in high places ask rhat use India was to the English? Would they not have the oame trafflo with India as if they governed It? Shoald they not let IndiA alone? The men of Ashburton, he anticipated, would answer as he answered such questions, by saying that it was aue to England's honour-due to the people pLced under Englisrh care, that they should stand by rndi, and endeavour still to elevate her, and preserre her from fallng under the tyrannoas cruelty of de,pots. (Cheers.) Bat what was to bedone in India? Well might iLt puzzle the wiseAt men ac. customed to legsLate on home politics to answer the question. The government of Indba for 100 years had been of a mixed forml; partly commeroial, partlylegislative; more and more, as each period came round for renewing the charter of the Bst India Company, that Government assumed a legislatire and dropped its commercal charaoter; but they still had adivided responsibility, and that meant no respondbillty, and every ono was at a loss to say whe'her the Board of Control or the East India Company were most in fault in their utter ignorance with regard to the recent outbrea Here occurred a revolt of tens of thousands of soldiers ; the English had 12,000 civil and military officers in the country where it occurred, and not one discovered that the conspiracy ws hatching, or how It was hatched, or the reasons for it-none saw either its commencement or progress. (Hear, hear.) Was there not a fault here, and who was responsible for It? They must fix a responsibility ajivewhere for the future. India was worth pos3essing-Incia vwith its rich territory-unoaed forproductiveness onthefaco of the globe, blesseodwith great natural advantagesinhabited byamild and manageablepeople -India was indeed worth preserving, and It might bo preserved by the firmness and intelligence of the Saxon race. They must not tamper or trifle with the question. They must fix the responsibility in the right place-on the Ministers of the Crown, and abolish the outDgrown and irresponsible_powers of the Board of Control and East Indla Company. That was the quostion for the House of Comi mons to settle. Let the Mlnisters take the responsibilit. If funds were required for Indian government, they could be supplied temporarily; but he believed Indi oould be made a self-supporting dependency; at any rate, nothing could be so terrible and calamitous to this countrya s tha there ahould be a whisper, even, of abandoning InTdia to her fate. Abandon India to her fate I No; England ghould think of the outrage on her daughters the caznage of her sons, and bear Cawnpore ever In remembrance But he oonfened he appealed not to action in the spirlt of ravenzo That there aould be great and signda examples of those wIo bad oonspired agains the English he believed was just; but It ws not of revenge that they should talk. The question atoo lge for so small a fehng as revenge; they must teach the Hindoos howr unwise the mutineer, were; and, vwhile a terrible example was mad they should irnstrect the natives that justice required it, and that ECnglih milewa conducive to their permanent welfare.

SUPPOSED MURDER. A portion of a human body was yesterday found by a eouple of lightermen in the Thames, in a most frightfut state of mutilation, and little doubt can be entertained that a dreadful murder has been committed. At about h&lt-past 5 o'clock in the morning James Barber and Frank Kelsby, two young men in the employ of a barge- an-the brother of Barber-were proceeding in a rowboat from the Middlesex side of the Thames to the barge, which was moored near the Surrey shore, when they observed a carpetbag on one of the abutments of Waterloo-bridge. They took the bag into the boat and went on to the barge, 'where they showed the bag to the elder Barber, and the three proceeded to examine its contents. To their horror they found that it contained a quantity of human bones, to whiob a portion of the flesh was stil adhering. By the advice of the older Barber the two youths took the body to Bowstreet polioe-station, where Inspector Mackenzie of the F division wAs ou duty at the time. Mr. Payuter, the divisional surgeon, was seat for and examined the remains, which appeared to be those of a man of middle age. They consisted of a number of bones, formlag nearly a complete skeleton, but wanting the head, hands, and foet. The greater portion of the flesh had been removed, but a cousiderable part of the breast and the portion of the side under the armpit still remained attached to the ribs. The whole had evidently been soaking in brine for several days, and a portioun was in perfect preservation, but somo parts, where the salt hAd not taken effect, were somewhat decomposed. The bones had been divided with a vory fine saw, 'Which, however, had been used unskilfully, as by a person not accustomed to use such ingtruments. There was a deep gash iu the breasb, as if from r. stab with a knife. The bag also contained a sait of clothes of good quality, Including a dark mixed overcoat, a singlebreasted frock coat, double-breasted waiatcoat, mixed trousers, cotton shirt with linen front, merino under shirt, and drawers. The shirt and under shirt were pierced as from a series of stabs in no less than nine places, seven about tho region of the heat and two about the abdomen. The skirt of the coat was also pierced in two places, correEponding with the latter. But the waistcoat bore no cuts to correspond with the supposed seven wounds in the breast, from which it is inferred that the man's waistcoat was open when the wounds were inflicted. Both coats are split up the back. Attached to the carpet bag was a rope, 20 yards in length and quite new. It is supposed that when the man was kiUed the murderers split up the coats in their haste to strip the corpse; that they then put it in pickle to prevent its putrefying while they made arrangements for its more permanent concealment; that, having mutilated it in this horrid manner, they put these portions into the carpetbag, and conveyed their hideous burden to the bridge with the intention of lowering it into the water by means of tho rope, and that, finally, having dropped it nftil it rested on tho abutment, they then imagined that it had reached the water, and so let it go. The abutment ;B directly under one of the recesses. The police have alreay received some information which it Is thought inexpedient to publish, and they entertir. hopes that this terrible mystery will be speedily cleared up. ANOTHER ACCOUNT. Yesterday morning wore discovered at Waterloo-bridge the -angled and mutilated remains of the body of a gentleman who had evidently been moet barbarously murdered, aud whose body had afterwards been completely made " a thing of shreds and patches." The atrocity, as will be seen from the following detils, even exceeds in its barbarity that of James Greenacre or Daniel Good, of wlhom, It will be recoL leoted, both, after murdering their victims, cut up their bodies, and the former distributed the sections in different parts of the metropolis, and the latter burnt the remains. In the case which we are about to detail it would appear that the murder must have taken place in, or the bouy boen afterwards removed to, some private place, where it was subsequently cut up and hacked to pieces. From the examiination of tho garments there is no doubt that the unfortunate deceased moved in the upper class of society. The discovery of this murder adds another ilustration to the already numerous cases on record, that, notwithstanding the great care and the evident attempt to conceal the fact which the perpetrators of this diabolical deed bad taken, murder will out. The crime was bronght to light in this way. Yesterday morning, at about half-past 8, two youths, accompanied by an elder mrother, waited upon Mr. Superintendeat Durkin of the I? division at the Bow-street station, and mnade a statement to the effect that the two youths were in a boat rowing on the river Thames that morming between 5 and 6 o'clock, and as they were about to pass through one of the arches their attention was attracted by seeing a bundle on one of the buttresses. They pulled up as soon as possible in order to seize what they considered a prize. When abreast of the buttress they discjvered that the bundle which they had noticed was a large travelling or carpetbag; with the assistance of their oars they succeeded in getting this bag into the boat. They then discovered that it was tightly corded, and that in addition there were some 10 or 12 yards of string, which has led the police to the belief that the cord had boen used for the purpose of quietly dropping the bag into the river without making any splash or sound, which would at once have caUed the attention of the officers of the Thames Police-station, which is moored off the spot, or of the numerous watermen who ply off the stairs on either side of the bridge. But, instead of the bag going into the water and floating with the tide to some other spot, from the circumstance of the cord not being suiclently long to swing it Into the water, it lodged upon the buttress where it was found. When the boys got the bag into the boat, upon an examination they found it was exceedingly heavy, and as the tide was running very strong at the time all their energies were required to manage the boat. They thorefore decided to take the bag home before they opened it. Upon arriving at their residencoe they communicated the fact of the finding of the bag to an elder brother, who at onco proceeded to examine the contents. On cutting the string and opening the bag a horrible spectacle presented itself to their view-portions of a human body, bones from which the flesh had been rudely torn, and garments saturated with blood. Immediately on finding thie to be the case the elder brother, accompanied by the two youths, repaired to Bowstreet station, taking with them the bag. Mr. Superintendent Durkin deemed it necessary to send for Mr. Paynter, the divisional surgeon, of Catherine-street, Strand, who at once went to the station, and an examination of the bag and its contents then took place. The result of the examination, which was most carefully and minutely made by Mr. Paynter in the presence of Mr. Durkin, showed the bag to contain a great number of the different portions of a human body of the male sex. The parts found consisted of the legs, arms, nearly the whole of the spinal column, the buttock Joints, and the shoulder joints. The whole of the head with several cervicals of the vertebrrc, the hands, and the feet vere absent. With regard to the condition of the remiains, it was found that the greater portion of the liesh had been very roughly removed. There were, however, some portions of the muscles remaining on the limbs; these wore impregnated with a salinie matter of a gitty nature, as if the body had been placed in brine, or salted; and it is the opinion of the surgeon and police that such a course had been adopted in order to prevent any smell which might arise from decomposition before the diabolical arrangements had been concluded for the disposal of the body. There were In all about 20 pieces, the large bones oi the legs and arms having been rudely sawn into pieces, the former having been dlvided near the joints of the knees and thighs, and one of the knees had been torn asunder, portions of the mascular fesh and integuments remaining on the different pieces of bone. It would appear that the brine or salt had not penetrated through the entire body, the sockets of the hipjoLnts havng on them some amount of tfesh which had become decoumposed. This one fact leads the surgeon to surmlse that the murder had been perpetrated some days, but upon this point no certainty prevails in consequenco of the preparation used having tended to preserve the other portions of the ilesh remaining on the bones. From the absence of the head it is impossible to guess even at the age of the unfortunate man, but from the appearance of the bones of the limbs Mr. Paynter is of opinion that the deceased was a full- sized robust man. Ln the bag was also found an overcoat made of a brown mixture, the sleeves lined with red silk, front tly faced with black slk, and the tails with black alpaca. It contained two pockets bcehind, andone breast pocket. This coat, which was made of a very finc materiel, such as a person in a good position In life would wear, was literally cut in two up theO back, nnfldr + :__tu .uu,.u conainled severa~l holes in rn buh left breast and lower part, evidently mnade with some sharp insrument, a md was much bloodstained. There was also a single-breasted black cloth frock coat, made of good maternal, lined with black alpaca, and having a cloth button-loop attached, with a brEast-pocket outside. This coat was also in two pieces, cut up the back, saturated with blood, and having holes In it about the l--ft breast and sidrts corresponding exactly in number and size with those in the overcoat. There was also a domuble.breasted black cloth vest witl# buckle strap bOhind, being like the two pre- ceding garments cut up the back and in two pieces. The Waistcoat also had holes in the front by the left breast, similar to those in the coats. A pair of trousers was also found. They were made of rough Oxford mixture or tweed, with small yellow waistband, and metal buttons. These also, were cit up the back, saturated with blood, and had several holes about the abdonien. Two shirts were also found in the bag, one of which was made of fine long-oloth with linen front, wristbands, and collar-the front being plaited in small plaits, stithed up, and having two vory small white bone buttons. The other was an under shirt of merino, with covered buttons. Both these articles were soaked with blood, and had corresponding holes in front. They were likewLse cut completely up the back. There w s also a ir of elastic lawn drawers, with one m etal and one bone rutton on the waistband. These were cut, and had holes ia them the same as the trousers, and were saturated writh blood. There was only one sock in the bag, and that was a thick white cotton one. There aze no initials, or name, or mark of any description on any one of the articles above enumerated, that would tend to threw any light on the matter as to the identification of the deoeesed. From the abl-e description of the articles of wearing AppeNel dA=ls uaf with t h4 manged remains in the ba , it will be seen that every one of them contains boles exactly dmilar in izze, position, and numuber, and not the slightest doubt is entertained that they were cau'ed by soume pointed instrament, such as a knife or dagger; consequently, it seems oertain that the deceased must have been foully mur. dered by being stabbed with such a weapon as above indioated, ardit Is also clear that the deceased had been stabbed a great mang times, as there are no fewer than seven punctures in the clothes in the immediate vicinity of the region of the heart, whhUe there are several others about the abdo. men, One extraordinary feature in this case is that, whie the various articles of clothing, together with the portions of the mangled body, were quite wet, the bag contining them was perfectly dry. It would seem therefore that the clothes and remains had only been placed in the bag ashort time before it was depoSited where it was found, and also that the bag must have been placed on the buttress, for had it floated from any part of the river and become lodged on the buttress the bag must undoubtedly have beern wet. It may not be considered out of place heve to mention that the bag in which the remains were found is a full-sized travelling carpetbag with two handles, and had evidently seen some wear. There are no marks on It, but it has a patent lock, which was not fastened, for when found it was secured by a piece of cord. In the Inside of the frame there Is a partition, but the linhig has been torn out- consequently its contents had been indiscriminateIy thrust in. The examination by the surgeon being concluded, Mr. Superintendent Dtrkin selected sorue of his most active offloers to Investigate the case, with a view, If possible, to unravel the mysterious circusitances by which it is surrounded; but unfortunately up to this time very little has been ascertained to lead to the belief that their efforts will be successful. We may 3nention, however, that one point appears to be satisfactorily establishedthat the bag was depodted in the place where it ws discovered by a female, for it has been ascertained that a rather elderly woman passed through the foot pssengers' tollgate about 12 o'clock on Thursday night. The money-taker on duty at that time remembers that such a persou came up with a large carpetbag, which appeared to be very weighty, and owing to the narrowneEs of the turntile she was unable to paass through with it. The money-taker acoordingly hizmself lifted it over for her, and he asserted, on iearing of the discovery, that he took p.rtioulAr notioe of the bag, as it bada flower worked in the oentre of the material of which it was made. He has, we understand, been ahown the bag in which the remains were found, and expresses his ability to swear that it is the one which he Paw in the woman's hand, and which he lfted over the turnstile for her on Thursday night. At that time there was no eord attached to It, so It would appear tbat the woman must have fasteued the wcrd to it as s.he passed along the bridge, and have lowneed it on to the buttress from one of the recesss of the bride The police are making every exertions to discover this woman, and we trust that before long she will bein the hands of justice. The matter has been eommunicated to Mr. Bedford, the coroner for Westminster, and an inquest will be held on the remains, which are now lying at the Bow-street sttion, together with the clothes, through the identification of whrc It Is hoped the murdered man may be made known. At a late hour last night the police authorities were put in possession of a description of the woman who passed over the bridge with the bag containing the mutilated remains of the murdered man on Tursday night. She Is described as being of short stature and rather stout, about 50 or 60 years I of age, pale complexion, and gray hair; she was dressed in a black silk mantle and a drab silk or satin bonnet. The woman, whoever she is, passed on to the bridge from the Middleex side, and, besides the carpet bag, she carried a brown paper parel of somewhat large dimensions. That parcel is now supposed to have contained the head and other parts of the body which are missing, and It is believed that the woman lowered the parcel into the water, and that It floaled away with the tide. Another point of some importance in elucidating the mys is, that the pooket in the various articles of clothing found I the bag were turned inside out, and not a single article was to be found in any of them. The inference to be drawn from this is thAt the unfortunate man must have b6en robbed either befors or after he was assassinated.
SHIPWRECK ON THE GOODWVIN SANDS. The gales which set in on Wednesday evening appear by the telegraphic notices received at Lloyd's to have been severely felt in the ChanneL Thoy commenced from the north-west and ranged to the south.east, with heavv squalls of rain. Later accounts speak of their somewhat moderating, but the weather continued stormy and wild, and a numerous list of casualties on the coast has been posted. In the Downs the gale blew very hard, with a tremendous sea. There were many ships riding at anchor when it came on. Some got aWay to the northward, while others run the somewhat perilous course of attempting to ride out the gale with two anchors down. His Danish Majesty's bHrg Omen was one of them, and had a narrow escape of being driven ashore. Owing to tho fury of the wind, she Was carried from her anchors some distance, and at length was obliged to run for Margpte Roads, where sbe brought up in safety. Several ships lost anehors and chains, and succeeded in getting into ]f.msgate harbour. Two vessels met with their loss in endeavouzing to reach that havern of refuge. The French lugger Josephine, coal-laden, bound for Bordeaux, In running in caught the east pier and became a total wreck. All the hands were saved, with the exception of an apprentice. Another French vessel, the schooner Petite Emma, bound for Nantes from Sunderland, struck against the same pier end became a wreck, the crew being also preserved. Early yesterday morning a large sbip was eeen on the east end of the Goodwi Sands. Bostmen were sent off from Deal and other places, and on reaching near the wrock it was found to be a fine American ship, named the A. B. Kimball, of Portland, United States. She was bound for New York with a general cargo from Sunderland, and she is reported to have gone on the Sand late on the previous night. The crew are stated to have been saved. The ship Is a wreck, and her loss wvIl he considerable. So tremendous was the sea running in the Channel that the mxal steamers were unable to leave Dover harbour. On the south side of the Isle of Wight the Portuguese hark Temeraria, Captain Maeido, bound to Oporto from the Tyne, was driven ashore on Tnursday morning during tho height of the gale. The ship immediately began to break up, and her commander, chief mate, and one of the seamen wero drowned. She was laden with coals. About the same time another foreign vesselwas lost at the back of the inland. The ill-fated ship was the Spanish bri Nuestra Senora dal Carmen on a voyage from Bilboa for Norway sbe could not weatder the gale, and was driven ashore near Darnsey, but the orew saved themselve. Lower down the Channel the gale raged more severely. In the vcinity of Lyme, to the westward of Portland, several small vessels were wrecked. The Glory, belonging to Plymaouth, was driven from her moorings and foundered The Emu, of Jersey, and James and Charlotte were vwrecked near the northern wall of the harbour. Another small vessel, the LIttle Jem, of Guernsey, parted, went on Luca's Ledge, and went ashore, The crews were all saved. The accounts from the Cornish coast speak of the gale having reached the force of almost a hurricane. The gale was from S.S.E. to S., with a tremendous sea and heavy rain. Off Penzance several atores have been picked up by the fishing lugger Monkey, which has led to a belief that some unfortunate vessel had foundered during the fearful night of Wednesday. A fatal lOSe is reported to have occurred In Carmarthen Bay on Wednesday evening. During a heavy squaU a French vessel, laden, ;ith three red saiUs, drove from her anchorage near the llooper Sands, and foundered, the whole of her crew going dowvn with her.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMFES. Sir,-Will you allow me to contradict the report brought by the last mail as to the mutiny of the Shekawattee Battalion and the disturbances at Midnapore ? I bave just received a letter, under date August 20, from an officer in the Shekawattee Battalion, stationed at Midnapore, in which he says that notwithstanding the many temptations which have been held out to the men to mutiny and desert their colours, the whole corps has continued quiet, orderly, and well conducted. As a precautionary measure, all the ladies of the station have been sent to Calcutt%, but the conduct of the men has heen as good as ever it was in the best of times. At a special parade, a fewv days before the date of the letter, the men of the battalion presented a purse of 100 rupees, which had been subsoribed among them, to Mr. Leycester, the civil judge of the station, as their contribution towards the relief of the sufferers by the mutiny. The Shekawattee Battalion perhaps may be remembered as part of the brigade which waR raised by Colonel Forster in that part of Rajpootana vwhence the name Is taken. It was then compoEed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, aDd did much service in reducing Rajpootana to subjection. It was likoewise at Aliwal under Sir Harry Smith, and was then officered almost entirely by the Forster family, a dr. cunstance which at the time attracted some notice. It was afterwards reduced to an infantry battalion, and sent to garrison Mirzapore and Jaunpore, whence it was relieved by the Sikh regiment, and sent to Midnapore. Your readers may, perhaps, feel an interest in these facts, connected with one of the few faithful reimentsnow serving the Government in the East, and this will, I trust, prove sufficient apology for giving them. I remain your obedient servant. H. F. G.

MIDDLRSEX SESSION,% Friday, Oc 9. This morning Mr. Thomas Bartlett Simpson's application for the renewal of the license for music and dancing for Cremorne Gardens was proceeded with. The bench consisted of over 30 magistrates. Mr. Pownall was in the chair. Mr. Edwin James, QC., Mr. Bodkin, and Mr. Poland, instructed by Mr. Pawle appeared for Mr. Simpson,; Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Mr. ifetealfe, Mr. D. Keane. and Mr. Cole, on behalf of the Vestry of St. Luke's, Chelsea, to oppose. Mr. JAMES said his friend would commence, as they ap peared in opposition. Mr. Serjeant BALANrTzT said that would be so, and he should request that the petition for the renewal of licens0 and that of the vestry in opposition be read. Mr. Maude, the deputy cerk of the peace, accordingly read them. That of Mr. Simpson set forth that he had been the roprictor of Cremorne Gardens seven years, during which time 2,500,000 persons hbd visited them; that he had expended upon the property more than 30,0001. and given employment to between 200 and 300 persons, and that there were no polce complaints against the manage. ment. The petition against stated at length the grounds of opposition to be that by Cremorne being kept open until early hours of a morning property In the vicinity had been greatly depreciated in value ; that the women and men who were there until the closing disturbed the rest of the inhabitants by the noise and brawls they created in the streets; that women of bad character were upon the free hst for admission to the gardens; and that the gardens being kept open until 4 o'clock in the morning had a most demoralzing influence, for which reason they prayed that the liense might only be renewed upon such conditions as would insure the closing of Cremorne by 12 o'clock. The petitioners disclaimed any wish to interfere arbitrarily with Mir. Simpson and his interests. Mr. Serjeant BALs.r-mE stated that he appeared on be. half of a public body who had thought it their duty to come to this Court to complain of Cremorne Gardens, which, as he should produce evidence to prove, had been conducted soas to become a public nuisance and an evil. After 12 o'clock the gardens were open again, after they had been cleared of those who took their children and friends for amusement. After 12 o'clock came that which the petitioners asked the Court to protect them and the public from. After 12 o'clock cabs full of women were flocking down to the gardens, not a decent one among them, and the place became the nucleus of a particular class of fernslea; and drinking and dancing were carried on until 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning; and when they did leave the highways were crowded with these women and the men they were in company with, romping, shrieldnq, shouting, and rioting, acoording to the temper they1might be in. That was -what was compladned of. The Chelsea vestry were not acting in opposition to whAt were really rational and innocent amusements; they were content to submit to a certain amount of inconvenience and annoyance even, but they did object to a state of things which was destroying their neighbourhood; they were appealed to as the governing body of the parish, and came to the Court which originally granted the license to ask for a remedy for such a state of things, which the Court could easily apply. The witnesses were then examined. Mr. Ashby, upholsterer, of Oxford-terrace, King's-road, Chelsea, stated that his house was about 100 yards from Cremorne, and he had lved there since March last. Hehad observed the class of persons frequenting the gardens. In the afternoon, and up to about 9 in the evening, the class of persons seemed to be very respectable, but there was a change after that hour. The fireworks sually went off about 11, and respectable persons who frequented the gardens then left. When the Cremorne season was on he made his bedtuncevery late, for it was no use to go to bed if he could not sleep for the noise of cabs drivlng to and from tbe gardens up to 3 in the morning, and the singing, shouting, and screaming of men and women leaving thce gardenf He had tried to let hls house or sell it, but persons who had applied to himn had objected that it was too near Cremtorne, and hehhad beenunabletolet it inconsequence He bought the carcass of his house in September, 1N55, and finished it. He then tried to let lt, but as he could not he went to live in it himself. Crossn xamlned.-he had been to Cremorne, once in this year and in 1855. He gave S 01. for the carcse of the house, and had laid out altogether upon it about 400. Hie made that outlay after he had been to Cremorne nd knew the sort of entertainments that were given. Never complained to Mr. Si2pson or to the Police, but did to the vestry, in consequence of a handbill which was crculat asking persons who had complaints to make against Cremorn to send themtote vestry, and he then sent u a statement of the persons who declined to take his house "rem its proxcimlty to Cremnorue. MIr. Elliut, of No. 5, Oxford-terrace, deposed to the noisy conduct of men and women leaving Cremorne at hours from 12 o'clock to 3 in the morninsg. He was a builder, and estimated the depreciation in the value of house property in the neighbourhood of Cremorne at one-third at ieast, the result of the nuisance arising from what took place outside the gardens. He knew nothing of what took place inside. He had tried to let his house, but could not, and one or two of his friends w lom he had offered it to said they would not live there if they could have it for nothing. One great feature of the nuisance was the squabbling of cabmen taking fares to and from the gardens after midnight. Cross.-examined.-Bought his house in 1850; and he knew how near it was to Cremorne, but he was not aware then of what a nuisance it was. He had been to the gardens twice, once in 1551 to see the representation of the Siege of Sebastopol. ie had not complained to any one. Many other witnesses were examined, their evidence being in the main the same as that given above. They stated that there was a general depreciation in the value of property throughoub the parish of Chelsea, but more particularly in the neighbourhood of Cremorne. One stated that he complained to Mr. Simpson of Sunday music being given in the gardens, and the answer was that he would discontinue that when the Government discontinued that in the parks. The SLnAimrAx, said,as there was not and, in fact, could not be any objection to rational amusement at reasonable hours at Cremorne, he thought, after the evidence that had been laid before the court, that the learned counsel on either side night confer with Mr. Simpson, with the view of an arrangement being entered into so that no one should be admitted to the gardens after 12 o'clock. Mlr. Serijant BALLANTIE said he was happy to hear that suggestion from the chair, and was not only ready to act upon it, but to adopt it on behalf of the vestry. Mr. JAMRES said what feU from the bench was entitled not only to respect but to consideration, and he would therefore ask the indulgence of the Court for a quarter of an hour to confer with his learned friends and Mr. Simpson. Mr. TUBBs, magistrate, said he should oppose any restrictions being imposed upon Mr. Simpson which were not authorized by the law. The Bench granted Mr. James's request and that gentleman and those with him and the learned Counsel on the other side and Mr. Simpson retired. After a short absence thev returned, when 'Mr. Serjeant BAI.LANTn-E said they had not been able to arrange the matter, although it had been suggested to Mr. Simpson that the opposition would be withdrawn if he submitted to the same condition as was observed at Highbury Barn and the Eagle---viz., to close at 12 o'clock; that was ail the vestry required. A number of other witnesses were then examined. They were mostly residents of the neighbourhood of Cremorne, and they complained of the noises and disturbances occasioned by persons leaving the gardens at hours subsequent to l2o'oloc at night,bywhich their rest was broken. Evidence was given that the property in the neighbourhood of the gardens had decreased n value. Mr. JAMES, in addressing theBench, said he did so with no little anxiety, not with respect to the result of the applcation for the renewal of Mr. Simpson's license, but the interests which that gentleman had involvedin this disoussion. He had laid out a capital of 30,0001. on this property. His licenses had been renewed year after year, both by this Court and the magistrates of the division, without the shadow of a complaint being made before either with respect to Mr. Simpson or his management of Cremorne, and the question of the refusal of this license was one for the earnest and serious con. sideratlon of the Bench. The case got up for the opposition was enormously exaggerated in the first plaee. Riot, tumult, and debauchery, it was said, had taken place In the streets, and it was attempted to make Mr. Simpson responsible for it; but upoix what ground could he be made responaible ? Not any more than the r prietor of a theatre could be held responsdb!. for hnat people might do after leaving hix etab. ;ishent ater the conclusion of the performanoer. With respect to diminution in the value of prope Mr. Simpson was the laest ratepayer in the perWi; fi had -spent 30 OOOL on ais property, and had brougha business to tie neighbourhood. In conclusion he woul4 say, the police were in the gardens every night; they had not dared to call one as a witness. He should call no evidence, but would appeal to the absence of such evidenoe on the other side. If Cremorne was a public nuisano, let it be indicted, and the properly constituted tribunal of thb count could determine whether it was a nuisance or not, Mr. TBu 6 chaimn of the Kensington divisou, said he felt it his duty to attend to support Mr. Simpson, with whose conduct the licensing magistrates vwere entirely satified. There had never been a complaint aginat him. He hoped this Court would grant his licenso as readily as that below granted his spirit license, If necessary he ahould move tht the Icense be ancondltlonally granted. This was seconded.. Mr. WOODWARD moved, as an amendent, that it be a oonditiou of the license that no person be admitted to tLe gardens after 12 o'clock at night, those admitted prior to thathour to be allowed to remain s long as the proprietor tho-ght fit. This vwa seconded. Mr. ARMSThOI.G made a few observations, hoping that if the lieense were grant-d the diswasdon of that day would not be swithout effect. The CHALIBX. put the amendment, which was neptived, and the license was granted without condition, by iS votes to 8. Robert Richard Bignell applied for a renewal of the license for music and da ing for the Argyll Rooms, Windmill-street, H market. Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., Mr. Bodkin and 1r. Slegh appeared in support of the application. -r. Serjeant Bal. lantine and Wr. Metcalfe opposed, on tAe part of the rector vestnen, churchwardens, overseers, and governors ai di ors of the poor of the parish of St. James's, West. Minster. The petitions for and against the renewal of the 1iona having been read, Mfr. Serjeant BALLAN-T?Nyz aid he was instrned by the authorities of the parish of St. James's Westminster, to appear on their behalf to opPose the renewal of this e In *his case he had, on the part of the parish, to elals protection from the BenDh against one of the greatest evils that ever existed in the capital of any country. It an peared, from the petition which had been presented bytho paish that Mr. Bignell originally came to the court under a false representation, for It was not Xi LAurent, but Ir. Bignell, who was then the proprietor, and, although AL Laurent was put forward, Mr. Bignell was the only penon who was to be benefited by the granting of the hoense, He professed that his object in obtaining the license was to give first-class music and first-ca concerts, and the Bench, in granting the license, never dreamt for a moment of such things as had arisen, or that the house could be visited by such characters as he should have to prove. The place, instead of being used to improve the character of the people, was solely resorted to by a women, vwho went there to pursue their trade, and heI lY not believe that one respectable womn was ever seen within its waLs. Evldence was then called to prove the facts detailed by the learned counsel, the witnesses being a superintendent of police and two inspectors, who proved that the place was xesorted to by improper characters, that as soon as they left the Casino they = a nuisance to the neighbourhood, and that offences brought under the cognizance of the police had greatly inereased since this place had been opened. MAr. Edwin James then addressed the Court in support of the applicant, Mr. Bignell, and said that if they agreed with Mr. Serjeant Ballantine in the grounds he had et forth for opposing this license it w ould n effect be to make Mr. Bignel responsible for the vrice which existed in the whole of the metropolis, The C inwr then put the questlon, and the licem was refused by a large majority, there being only three hands held up in its favour.
POLICE. MAN&SIou-os10 -Lambert Philip Molledown, formerly a commission merchant, carrying on an extensive busine in Mark-lane, was brought before Mr. Alderman WIRn, in custody of Huggett, the detective offioer, for final examination, charged with having uttered a bill of exchange for 4531. l9s. id, with intent to defraud Mr. G. Axton, cornfactor, of 23, Fenchurch-dtreet and Corn Rxchange. It wil be recollected that the prisoner already stands committedupon the charge of having fraudulently obtained from the same prosecuter 7401. upon a forged bill of ladinb Mr. Robinson appeared for the prosecution, and MIF Church defended the Droioner. At the last examination of the prisoner upon the present charge the prosecutor said, that on the 16th of May last he received from the prisoner the bil of exchange then produce dated the 27th of April 1857, at three months alter da or 453l. L,pnrportlg to be drawn at Gloceser by G. Hall and Co. on John Taylor, late Taylor and Francis, Nottingham. The prosecutor took the bM in part payment of cargo of barley that the prisoner had sold on Els accuat. The bill, which had been made payable at the London and Westdminster Bank, was presented snds returned. Mr. B. Estcourt, supermtendent of polleo at Glocester, stted that he had made inquiries in that town for the firm of G. Hall and Co., and had not been able to find it. Mr. William Taylor was called yesterday, and said,-I live at Nottingham. Until December, 1855, I carried on business with Mr. John Francis, as wholesale stationers. He was tho father of my present partner. The partnership was dissolved in September, 185a. Since that time I have been engaged in business with the son of the former gentleman, under the firm of Taylor and Francis. I have carried on business under the name of Taylor and Francis with father and son together abot six years. There is no other 5nm of Taylor and Frands carrying on business at Nottingham than ours. I do not know the signature of the acceptanoe of the bill produced, and it was not authorized by our firm Alderman WLBx-Did yoe receive any notice of the dishonour of that bil ? Witness.-Certrinly not. I knew nothing of it til I saw the report of the last examination of the prisoner in he 2Ymas newspaper. Mr. L Ashley, clerk at the Lothbury branch of the Lon. don and Westminster Bank, said,-I have searched our books and cannot find that we have any account with Joh4 Taylor of the firm ofTaylor and Francis. hIr. Church declined putting any question for the prisoner, who, after the usual caution, said he shorld reserve his defence. He was then fally committed for trial upon this charge also. Solomon Parker, who had been remanded, but admitted to bail, upon the charge of having stolen nearly 1001. worth of military caps and cape, the allegod property of MSr. HIenry Benjamin, of 13, Mount-place, Whiteehapel, again aptpeared before Mr. Alderman WIRB for furte examiaton. Mr. Daniel appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Sleigh for the defendant. Alderman WIRE, after hearing some evidence on the art of the defendant tending to confirm the statement of r. Sleigh that his client and the prosecutor were partners in the sale and purchase of old clothes, disumissed the cha ge. Matthew Henry Benjamin, a young man formerly in the service of Mr. Morpeth, tobacco-broker in Fenthurch. street, was brought before Mr. Alderman WIRE and Mr. Alderman SALOMONS 'n petty sessions, charged with havnig robbed his master of 191. 3e 4d. The prisoner pleaded " Guilty." The prosecutor most strongly recommnended the prisoner to the mercy of the Court on account of his nine years' previous Rood character. Mr. G.Lewis, wlho appeared for the prisoner, joined In this appeal, and said that his client had been the victim of sudden temptation. The prisoner wvas sntenced to five months' imprisonment with hard labour. CharlesOates, a "rougher" in the serviceof Messrs. Defries, glass manufacturers, of Houndsditch, who pleaded " GuUty" to robbing his master of a decanter, two tumblers, and two custard cups, was sentenced to four months' imprisonment with hard labour. William Thompson was charged with having obtained four leathern bags of thevalue of 41., the property of Joseph Schloss, under false pretences, Mr. C. Rockley.-I am traveller to Mr. Joseph Schloss; importer and aanufacturer, of St. Thomas Apostle. On the 4th ult. the prisoner offered me the order produced, purporting to come from Mr. Esquilant, a customer of ours. e was in Mr. Esquilant's employment. The bags were sent accordingly. Thomas White, a porter in the service of the prosecutor, said he packed up the four bags, which were given to the prisoner by MIr. Oppenheimuer, also in the service of the prosecutor. Mr. F. Esqullant, stationer, of 346, Oxford-street, said, the order produced purporting to be his was a forgery. Samuel Evans, policeman No. 459, said, the prisoner denied the charge when apprehended. The prisoner, who was fuLly committed for trial, has already suffered 12 months' imprisonment upon conviction of an offence similar to that with which he was now charged. MARLBOROUGH-STREET.-George Prowse and John Mat ta, the latter a young man of colour, were charged with being concerned with another not at present in custody in stealing 25 sovereigns. Mr. John Scott, of lSO, Waterloo-road, surgeon, deposed that he had known Mattas some time and yesterday met him in St. Martin's-lane. Mattas asked him to treat him. They went to two different houses and had drink, and Mattas then proposed that they should proceed to the White Bear, Piccadilly, where they had before met. Prosecutor agreed, and they went accordingly, he giving Mattas a sovereign to purchase a new collar and necktie for him. On his return with these articles he was obliged to ask him for his change. Instead of giving it the prisoner put his band in prosecutor's pocket, and took out another sovereign. Was quite sober, and saw the sovereign in his hand. In consequence of a "to-do" he made altout this Mattas returned it. Prosecutor wanted upon this to get rid of him, but found It not so easy, and Mattas induced him to accompany him to a house in the Haymarket (Hotel de Paris), where he introduced him to some "gentlemen" who were there, and who proposed to " toss" for a bottle of wine. Prosecutor did so, and lost. Cards were then produced, but he deelined to play. The other prisoner, Prowse, was among thetn, and some differenee aving been raised Mattas seized the prosecutor by the throat and nearly strangled him. While this assault was going on the prisoner Prowse put his hands into both the trousers' pockets of prosecutor. This he distinctly felt; was sober, and perfectly sensible. Another man not in custody took a cinpal part In rummaging his pockets, also putting his hand Into one in which ha had about 401. in gold; he took some, and he euhseeuently found he had hsd21 stolen from him. He seized hold of this man, who had the bulk of his money, hut he succeeded in extricating him- VI And rotting away, the two prisoners muoh 11-usng John Kale, s witnes, say the prisoner Prowse endeavour to get rid of something fom his pocket in Jermyn-street on the way to the Itio ith small pocketboiok.

A bout four years of this she underwent in penal servitude, when she was discharged upea a sort of ticket of leave, and returned home, apparently reformed and sorry for her misconduct; but she had not beon at home long before she was found to he pursuing her old practices again, and about two months ago, in the night time, got into the house of one of the neighbours, near are,fromvhieh she carried off a quantity of property, and nothing more could be heard of her until It was accidentally discovored that she was in custody at this court for attempted suicide.

LONDON ANI) NOIITH-WESTERN. A special meeting of this company was held yesterday at the Eauston station, the Marquis of Chandos in the chair. Mr. C. 1. STENA WRT, the secretary, read the noticc convening the meoting. Tlhe CHAIiRMaN said the first resolution he had to pro. pose waf for the purpose of authorizing agreemrents with the Shropshire Union Rtailway and Canal Coni pany, or with all or any of the shareholders,with respect to thc conversion of aU or any of the shares, or all or any part of the stock of the Shropshire Union Company into ordinary stock of the London and North-Western Railway Company. The clauses in the Act referring to this matter were set forth in the circular which had been sent to the shareholders several days prior to the meeting. Ile then pro. posed a formal resolution, authorizing the directors to carry out the arrangement for converting the shares and stock of the Shropshire Union Company into stock of the London and North. Western Comnuay in the proportion of 1001. of the former for 0W. of the atter, and so on in like proportion. lIe said this arrargement was merely carrying out the original agreement between the two companies. The conversion of shares or stock authorized by the Act would not involve any additional payment or liabiity on the part of the London and North-.W estern Company. In reply to qluestions, it was stated that tho capital of the ShropBhire'Union Company amounted in round numbers to 1,50.o000o., and that by adopting the arrangement it was probable some expenses would be saved. Tho shareholders -who converted 1heir shares as proposed would receivo their dividends at the same time as the other shareholders in the London and North-Western Railway. The resolution was carried unanimously, The CIHAIR31A said the next resolution he had to uro. pose was for the purpose of authorizing the coinpany to saubcribe towards and take shares in the Buxton Extension capital of the Stockport, Disley, and Wlraleybridge RtailWAy Company to an extent not exceeding in the whole In reply to a question it was stated that the length of the extonsion line would be nine miles and the estimated cost between 170,0001. and 180,0001. The comupany held half the capital of the Stockport, Disley and Whaleybridge Railway, and they were authorized to hold one-half the capital of the extension line, not exceeding the amount mentioned. A StJAltEslol.zlc) thought the line wouid never pay theims 5 per cent., or be worth 50 per cent. of its cost ; he would thereforo vote against tile nsotion. Mr. jOLLS said the line was much wanted, and he had no doubt it -would be remunerative. The CRiALLUMAN stated that the passenger-traffic on the Disley and Whaleybridgo line during the few months it was m operation had exoseded the expectations of the directors, independent of goods and mineral traffic which had not yet been brought on the line. TPhe motion was put and carried by a show of hands, but, as.they were not all in favour of the motion, it was necessary to ascertain whether three-fifths of the shareholders and capital represented at the maeeting were in favour of the resolutk.on, and for that purpose a poll would be taken after the other business a-as disposed of. The Ca.ILRMIA.N1 said the next resolution was for the or pose of obtaining their assent to the contract, approvX by the Government, to be entered into between Eior Meesty's }'ostmastor-General and the London and North-W estcr and Cheater and olybead RailUway Companies and ,the City of Dublin Steamupacket Comapany, for the conveyance of the mails between London and 3aingdtown. They would see by the circular that the contract was for 14 years, subject to a power of the C-overnment, at any time after the first five years, to put an end to the contract, if they had reason to be dissatisfied with the manner in which it wasgenerally performed; in which event the Government would purchase the packets at a price to reimburse the net cost, to be determined by arbitration. The existing contraet with the City of Dublin Steam. paoiet Company was to terminate when the new contract took effect. 'There were to be provided four packets, each being not less than 300 feet long, 1,700 tons measurement, and df sch construction as shoud be appre7ed by the Go. vernment as being suitable for thLs improved service, and for the accommodation of the publIc. There were to be four communications-two each way daily-between London and Kingstown in ll hours, subject to penalties for delay, except in certadn cases, when arising from cau8es beyond the control of the companies. Nothing cantained in the contract was to be interpreted to interfere with the rights of the. Postmaster-General or of the companies under the exiai8ng agreements or contracts with the Chester and Holylaead.Railway Company and with the London and North. Westcrn Railway Company, excepting so far as the etablshment of these new trains would render the service under such contracs or agreements unnecessary. The new service was to commence within two yaus from the ei:ecution of the contract. By agreement between the companies, the necessary capital, estimated at :3O,0001., was to be pxvided equally by the London and North. Western and City of Dublin Steampacket Companies. This company had the option of being half-owners and Oanagers op the 2temphkets po be pAomited under the contraA,. Tke directon, however, deemed it mnre expe.- dient fo arrange with the City of Dablin Compaay for thet performlaLoe of the sea portion of the servioe-this compauy being relieved from all liability in respect tesreof -the vessels being available rand at the disposal of, this company for the development of passenger traffic. as fully as if they were its oWn property. Under this arrangement the proportion of the capita to be provided for the construction of the steamboats by the London and .Xorth-Western Company would be advanced ae a loan, bearing interest at 5 per oent., on. the security of the four packets (costing double the amount of the advanco), and of the receipts for trafflc eared by the steavesseL. The capital so advanced would be repaid by annusl irstalments. For the land service there was to be paid annunally the sum of 20,001., independent f And in addition to tbh amount now paid to the London 4nd North-Western Co=Pany under their present general centract, and the sum of 30,0001. now paid annually to the Chester and Holyhead Company, under theexistingarrangetnent between thatcompany and the Government, would continue to be so paid; which sum of .V0,000. should, during the existence ef the contract, inclade, in addition to the service nowvperformed isn respect to it. the service herein provided for. A fornral resolution autihoszing the directors to carry out the contract as proposed was passed. The next resolution autlierixed the directors to purobase the Euston and Victoria Rotels for tke sum of S5,0001., in order to inesre the hotels being annaged under regulations and arrangements ganerally so as to afford the greatest possible accommodation to travellers using the lines of the company. A discussion ensued, in the course of which it was stated that the lease would -expire in 1861, the building lease was for 90years, aRdthe oompanypossessed the freehold. The rent of the hotels was 3,5001. a-year, and would return safficient interest on the capital. The resolution was carried by a show of hands, but there being two dissentients it was necessary to take the polL One of the dissentients withdrew his opposition, but the other would not, and the poll was taken. The result was that 51 proprietors, representing 1,188,5601. stock in the company and 1,855 votes, were in favoar of the resolutions, and seven proprietors, representing 7,5331. stock and 47 votek were against them; the resolutions were consequently declared carried, and the meeting separated. BELGIAN E&STERN JUNCTION. A meeting of shareholders in this undertaking was held yesterday at the offices of the company, Buckingham-street, Strand, for the purpose of reoeiving a statement from the directors on the position and prospects of the concer, and to adopt measures in relation thereto; Mr. Mi. Waring in the chair. The CHAIRMAN said that at their last meetinsg It was stated that from 20. 0001. to 24,1(001. was owing by the company, and it had been proposed that the shareholders should stbscribe in proportion to the shares held by them, in order to discharge that debt. The present directors, however, considered that the time was not come for such a proposition as that, and they proposed that the company should be carried on for some fuirtherperiod, andendeavoursbemade for arriving at somo other solution of the difficulty in which it was placed. When the present direction took themanage. ment there was a total dentof 30,0001., with assets of about 8S0001. only. The directors first endeavourcd to make an arrangement with a company in Brussels engaged in the construction of railway materials to purchase the rolling stock and work the raUway at a given price, but it wasfound that the prospect of getting a dividend was so remote that they abandoned the negotiation. Some other plan then became necessary, and the directors determined to reorganize the concern in its internal economy. This was accomplished m this manner :- The general offices of the company, which were at Brussels, were removed to Nivelle, and a great saving of expense was thus effected. The directors then determined to dispense entirely with the London offices, which would of course include the services of the secretary, whioh would still further reduce the expenditure, he (the chairman) having consented to his office being used for the business of the company in London, at a mere nominal sum. The railway had been let for three years upon advantageous terms. Theresult of those changes would be that whereas last year the working expenses amounted to 325,000f., with the capital account open, this year they would only he about 25,800f., which would be sufflcient to accomplish a grosstrafflc of 500,000f., the gross receipts lastyear beingabsorbed bythe workingexpenses. Witha debt of 30,001. the only two conrses which app,ared open to the directors were either to call upon the shareholders to pay that debt, or to effect some arrangement by which delay could be obtained in the payment, until the traffiec of the railway could be developed sufficiently to enable a loan to be procured. The principal creditors had consented to g ive tmae for the payment of their debt, and it was neces- sary to raise G,0001. to pay smaller creditors; but in order to get this time alowed it was necessary to show that the prospects of the railway were improving. The present condition of the traffic was this-it hbd increased during this year at the rate of 13 per cent., and the heat portion of the year was yet to come, because the coal traffic would be greater towards the krtter part of the year. The manager of the company had stated that he anticipates a gross traffic of 20,0001. a-year, which would enable them to pay the interest on all their debts. The directors had found that the coal traffic was the only one that could be looked to as capable of a very sudden expansion. The sources of the coal supply were very great-they only required to bring out the sources of consumption. They found that at Brussels the consumption of coal was 240,000 tons per annum, at Louvaino 35,000 tons, and at the stations and country on their own line, and on the line of the Luxemburg Railway it was 54,000 tons, makin a total of 330,000 tons per annum, which naturally would belong to their line, and which, with proper efforts, might bo secured. AS, however, the railway conipany d not possess the means of legally entering upon commercial transactions it was proposed to form a new company for the purpose of dealing in coaL The English directors had been to Belkium, had thoroughly investigated the matter, had been in couimunication with a gentleman there who was thoroughly competent in such matters, and whose posi-tion was most influential, and it was determined to form such a company on the comnuv'idilc principle. The capital would be 6,0001. in 5. shares. The manager was to receive 4001. per annum, and there would be a committee of management to watch over the working of the company and assist the manager. They expected to obtain a consumption of i 50,000 tons per annum, and supposing they only obt-ined a profit of lif. per ton, which was exiremely low, the result 'could be that the receipts of the railway would be augmented by about 4,0001. per annum, and the result to the coal company be a profit of something like 1,4001. The first profit realized by the coal company would go to pay 5 per cent. to the shareholders; 10 per cent. would go to a reserved fund towards paying off the capital sunk, and when that was accomplished the remainder would go as follows.- 18 per cent. to the committee of management, the rest to be divided among the shareholders in the shape of dividend. Lord BARRINGCTON considered the plan proposed by the directors a most feasible one, and that it was likely to be the salvation of their property. Se moved a resolution ap. proving the statement of the chairman, expressing an opinuon that it was expedient forthwith to organize a coal company on the basis proposed. Mr. .TAI oBS seconded the resolution. Mr. l{,ARTRI DOR moved an amendment which he afterwards withdrew. The resolution was carried nem. con. A number of gentlemen present then put their names down as subscribers in the proposed coal company, and a vote of thanks to the chairman closed the proceedings.
