She left the Heads on tho 19th of Marob, rounded Cape orn oxL the 6th of April, and crossed the Line on the 3d o2 May. The Sussex is laden with wool and copper ore, and has 137 passengers, of whom eight mechanics landed here. They state that their wages varied from 15sa. to 20s., and those of labourers from lOs. to 2Os. per day, working eight hours, which Is the prevailing time. Profits are less. Business is more steady. The Sussex spoke. north of the Line, the South Carolina, 102 days out from Melbourne, for Liverpool; May 17th, the Glorieuse, from India, with troops, lst from the Cape, out 92 days,-all well; June 3d, in the Channel, the Black Swan, out 92 days from Hobart Town. (BY ELEOTIC AND INMERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.) PLYMOUTH, THURSDAY AFTPRNOON. The Walmer Castle, Captain Daniel, 78 days from Melbourne, was off the Start this morning. She has 150 tons of copper ore, a full cargo of wool, 40,000 ounces of golddust, and 165 passengers. The Walmer Castle left Melbourne Marcsh 15, rounded Cape Horn Apzil 6, and crossed the Line May 1. Her passage to the Horn in 22 dals in said to bo tho ,hortest ever made. LIVERPOOL, THuRSDAY. The clipper ship Oliver Lang, on e of the Black Ball line of packet ships, has arrived with advices from Wellington, New Zealand, to the 28th of March, being 44 days later. She has made the passage in 68 daYs, and is the first direct vessel from Now Zealand for this port for the lest ton years. She brings no specie, but has 2,300 bales of wool and 17 tons of flax, besides parcels of oil, whalebone, &c. The foundation stone of the new buildings for the use of the general and provincial Legislatures had been laid at Wellington with considerable ceremony. The fourth and last session of the Provincial Council ternminated its sittings on the 20th of February. Gold to a lmited exteoat had been discovered in Nelson province. Emigrants had been freely absorbed in the districts within easy distances from Wellington. The Colonial Government had offered handsome rewards for the invention of means for rendering flax and other fibrous plants of New Zealand available as articles of export. Business was improving, and money was becoming easier. Several cargoes from England had been sold at generaly remunerative prices. The Customs revenue showed a large inmrease. Perter Was very scarce. Drapery, soft wood, and hardware of aU kinds dull of sale, the supply being excessive. London soaps were selling at a profit. The season's wool was not yet all in; in consequence of the high prico it was fetching in England buyers had been anxious to purchass for remittance, but growers preferred to take their chance of the home market. Provisions were munh cheaper, but owing to the increasing population rents were ribing. The following vessels had arrived at Wellington:-The Rose of Sharon, the Indian Queen, the Myrtle, and the Monsoon. The Phillip Laing and the Belisana, from London, had arrived at Lyttelton. The AnnWilson, the Heroes of Alma, and the Maori, with Government emigrants, had not arrived out. The Monsoon woald fill with wooL

She met with a strong gale in the Bay from S.E. to N.W., and was hove to for a couple of days, as the Turkish crew preferred going to prayers to raking sail. which all the persuasions of Mr. Williams could not prevai on them to do, they saying, "too much wind," "no bono," &o. The engines, by Napier, worked well, and the vessel steamed at the rate of eight to nine knots, making good weather. She would leave for Constantinople in a few days. Lord Lyons's fleet was at Malta, and was to leave for Tunis on the 31st of May. Her Majesty's ship Vulture left for Gibraltar on the 26th, and the screw steamer Adelaide with the 47th Itegiment on board, on the same day, for Gibraltar. The Sydney, steam-transport, arrived at Gibraltar from Malta on the 28th, with the right wing of the Ist Royal, (2d battalion), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Haythorne. They landed on the 30th, and were to ocoupy that portion of the south barracks vacated by the 15th Foot, who are to proceed to England in the same steamer, under the command of Coloiiel Cole. The left wing of the Royals, commanded by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel F. G. Urquhart, arrived at Gibraltar on the 29th, in the Australian steam-transport, Tie French Government steamer Requin, with the gun. boats Studente, Rafale, and Coulevrine, in tow, left Gibraltar on the 31st for the west. At Gibraltar, on the 31st, were Her Majesty's steamer Curlew, and the Turkish steam-frigate Gyvan Barhy.

The battalions of Royal Artillery, including the whole of the men oeaployed as officer6' servants, were yesterday under arms in the parade-ground facing the Royal Artillery bar. raoks, Woolwich, in clean fatigue dress, and were put through a course of brigade drill, under the chief command of Colonel Barker, C.BE. They were paraded in divisions in command of Lieutenant-Colonels Evan Maberly, 9th battalion; Henry William Montresor, 4th battalion; aud Henry John Thomas, 13th battalion. A number of undis. ciplined recruits of the Royal Marine Corps were at the same time assembled over Woolwich-common, in separate squads, and were put through a variety of field manceuvres, firing several rounds of blank cartridge. MajorJohn Brand. ling, C.B., Royal Horse Artillery, was yesterday morning directed to march with his troop for London, to be in readiness for a .-eview of cavalry, to take place at Worm. wood Scubs this morning (Friday), to commence at 10 o'clock- Tho troops acordingly marched from headquarters, Woolwich, yesterday at 2 p.m., without their guns. Yestorday the officers and men of the Roya5 Marine Light Infantry, at present at head-quarters, Chatham, were assembled in the barrack square, where they were formed into ten companies, after which they marched to the Linos, where they were inspected by the Deputy Adjutant-General, Colonel S. R. WeEley. The. battalion went through a variety of mancuvres and evolutions in such a manner as to draw forth unqualified praise from the inspecting field. officer. The depdt of the 88th Regiment arrived in Aldershott camp, yesterday from Belfast, id Liverpool, to join headquarters. The 88th is now under orders for India. Her Mlajesty's screw steamship Archer, Captain Edmund Eeathoote, from the North America and West India station, arrived at Woolwich yesterday morning, and having proceeded down the river to test her machinery, returned to Woolwich, and took up her moorings off the dockyard. She is under orders to be stripped and return stores, in order to be paid off and laid up in ordinary. The arrangements for shipping the Transatlantio electric cable have at length been concluded, according to the origindl plan entered into by the British and American Governments. The Agamemnon is to leave her moorings at Creenhithe this morning at 9.30, and will proceed to the basin prepared for her reception off East Greenwich, Comin modore Shepherd, saperintendent of Woolwich dockyard, having deen directed to despatch a party of riggers to give the requisite asslstance on her arrivaL Mr. M'Donald, master-attendant at Woolwich, accompanied by Mx. Jones and a party of between 40 and 50 seamen riggers, will be :n attendance at Greenwich to make fast the lashings and lay the vessel to her destined moorings. A telegraphic order was despatched to Devonport on Wednesday evening to arrest the proceedings commenced on board the St. Jean d'Acre, a compact having been concluded for adapting the United States' ship Iiagara so as to receive the Liverpool portion of the wire, it having been considered that ufcient time will yet elapse for that purpose, the period of paying out the cable being the month of August next. The Eurydice, 26 guns, Captain John W. Tarleton, C.B., &c., arrived at the Little Nore at 8 a.m. yesterday, last from Portsmouth. She will be towed to Chatham immediately she has discharged her powder, shell, &c., to be paid off. The Colossus, 80 guns, s;cMw steamship, Captain Thomas S. Thompson, steamed into harbour at Sheerness yesterday. On Captain.Superintendent John Jervis Tucker inspecting the Colossas the crew were put through a most rigid cou-se of practice, which they per"ormed with redit to themselves and their officers. The Colossus will be paid off about the 18th inst., and is to be placed in the second class steam squadron of reserve. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- C. H.

Rose, aslsstant-surgeon, to the Columbine; J. L Sands, assistant-surgeon, to the Briliant; and Doyle 3I. Shaw, acting assistant-surgeon, to the Victory.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE. TMES. Sir,-Will you alow me a few words with referenoo to your artlolo of yesterday on the qxestion of the manufactore of small arms, on one or two points which might, if uncorrected, convey an Impresadon injurious to the trade of Birmingham9 Yon Eay that Enfield must " at any rate have turned out a most influential model," and that the advantages of Enfield are correctly deEcribed as consisting " of a good standard of quality and a coertain amount of supply." I trust you will allow me to expladn that the weapon known as the Enfield rifle is emphatically a Birmingham weapon, modified from the original Mini6 rifle in the work. shop of Mr. Westley Richards. F'rom what sources the supplies have come is exhibited in a return made up to the 31st of Warch last, showing from Birmingham 220,000, from Enfield not one. As to the standard, I think you will allow that we can scarcely owe anything to examples of superior workmanship received from Enfield when I tell you that an Enfielddmade gun (I speak, of course, of the productions of the new establishment) has never been seen in Birmingham. I have myself seen hero three Enfield bayonets and as many lock. plates, and the most careful inquiry I have been able to make has not resulted in my discovering that any one, either officially connected with the Government estblish. ment or among the gunmakers, has ever seen more here. I know that the head viewer in Birmingham never visited the establishment at Enfieldto see what is being done there, and I shall be very much surprised if any ono of the C4 viewers under him ever did. How can we imitate what ourselves (with the exception of a few of our number who have visited Enfield) have never seen, or those who exine and test our productions? As to cost, the enormoas sum already expended at Enfield, and the high wages that are being paid to secure the services of men taken from our workshops in Birminghaw, zender the attempt to compete with us in the price of the gun almost hopeless. As to quality, before Enfield can 'produce a standard to afford an example to us, Enfield must first attain the step of making as good a gun as we can make; and I have not the slghtest hesitation in promising that, whatever the standard may be to which Enfield in future may attain, Bir. mingham shall attain a still higher. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant. J. D. GOODMAN. Chairmaln of the Birmingham Military Arm Trade. Birmingham, June 3.
GRAND CAVALPY RVIEVW im PARis.-The review of cavalry on Tuesday, in honour of the King of Bavaria, carno offon the now racecourse in the Bois de Boulogne. Among the spectators was an extraordinary large number of English. The cavalry consisted of two regiments of carabineers, two of cuirassiers, two of hussars, also of the dragoons of the Empress, the lancers of the guard, and six batteries of horse artiUery. At 5 the Emperor and the King of Bavaria arrived on the groand from St. Cloud. The Empress foRlowed the Imperial cortege in an open carriage drawn by four horse The appearance the troops presented was maguificent in the extreme, and as their aajesties swept along their front they presented arms, and shouted with enthusiasm, " Vive VREmpereur." while their bands played national airs. The King of Bavaria saluted the flag of every regiment. The Emperor, the King, and the Empress having concluded their insection, took up a station near the Cemetery. The cavalry then fell back, and the artiUlery proceeded to execute sundry manoeuvres. This done, the first line of cavalry made a charge, and the second one afterwards did the uame ; the regiments of lancers also charged separately. Then the troops were massed according to their different arms, and all enr masse came tearing along the plain, stopping only a few yards from the Kin an the Emperor, who had removed for convenience to the oentre of the ground. When the troops stopped they raised a shout of " Vive PEmpereurm Tfie precision with which these movements were executed was admirable, and the King of Bavaria, if we may judge from bis gestures. was both astonished and delighted with them. To the cvilian spectatr the sight was full of emotion; while the varied Mnitorms, and the many-coloured plumes, and the gleaming of sword and cuirass andhelmet, enchanted the eye, the assemblage of such a multitude of men and horses flUed the mind with a sort of terror at the tremendons force they repiesented the extraordinay care and exactitude with which ziict masses were moved-like men on a chess-board-was, too, a subject of profound astonishment.-Globe.

TheD ATLANTIC SUBMAPJRINE TELEGRAiPI. Yesterday afternoon the Lord aMayor, accompanied by a numerous party of the Corporation and civic officers, paid a visit to the works of Mesers. Glasse and Eliot, where the monster submarine cable is now rapidly advancing towards sts final completion. This visit could hardly be called a public one, and it certainly was not private, for the party went in a corporation state barge, rich enough in flags and gilding to have satisfied the Queen of Sheba. Its approaching the shore at such a wild hotel-less looking spot, wher, whitebait was never beard of and turtle is unknown seemed to create no small amount of sensation among the n3atives who dwell along the river's banks on Slimy piles, in Etranded boats, or long West-country barges. The visit was an event in their dreary life of flood and ebb, and they testified their interest accordingly by lounging to the doors of the various lockers in which they live, and watching the visitors como on shore. It was a feat worth Eeeing. Mos. of the gentlemen -who inspected the work, viill agree with us this morning that Glasse and Elliot's yard Is not a pleasant place on which to land at low water. The shore ia stony and, as a general rule, unsavoury in hot weather, when aUl the abominable flotsam and jetsam of the dirtiest river in Europe evaporate enough niasma to poison an aligator. As an initiatory process all the visitors had to walk from the barge to the shore along a narrow plank, and this necessitated feats on the part ofl stout gentlemen which In a circus would have covered them with immortal honour. Plankwalking under such circumnstances is always difficult, and when the performance has to be gone through by a portly functionary in full Court dress and cooked hat, anxious to preserve his dignity, yet afraid of losing his balance, the result has no medium, but is at once either sublime or ridioulons. Dnring yesterday's visit there was a little of both extremes, and successive efforts gave rise to much amusement among the party, as each individual walked ashore, with more or less of peril from the mud and water. The party were conducted over the works by Mr. Gla Bse, and the various processes which tho cable undergoes in the course of its manufacture were fully pointed out and explained. Two small iron oohorns were also fired by a spark sent through a short piece of the cable. Since our last notice of the progress of this great undertaklng, -with the exception of a short interval of 40 hours last Monday and Tuesday, the work has advanced inoessantly day and night. The "strand," "closing," and "serving" machines, which revolve with such as6unding rapidity, and whose noise can he heard even to the centre of the river, have done their work well, and spun an additional 500 miles of cable. Nearly 900 miles are now completed, and at least 1,200 would have been ready could the wiredrawers have supplied wire as fast as the machines consume It. But that, unfortunately, bas not been the case, for the daily consumption of fine wire has been greater than all the wiredrawers of England could furni, and the consequence is that less is ready for shipment than was wished or anticipated. 'The making of the two shore ends of the cable is well advanced. Those portions-namely, for 10 miles from the Newfoundland and 15 miles from the Irish shores, are being manufactured of immense strength, in order to resist the action of the waves over rocks, and danger from'i vessels, anchors, &a. They are made of 12 No. I wires, forming a cable 1, inch in diameter, and weighing about 6 tons to the mile. The size of the wires used in these ends gradually diminishes as deep water is reached, so that it tapers down where it joins to the diameter of the m ain portion of the cable. These No.1 wires are welded on to No, 2, which, in turn, are joined to No. 3, and so on, as shalow wa ter and liability to accident are decreased. At these ends the gutta percha and " sewing" of greased and tarred hemp are also made propor. tionally thicker, to lessen the chance of accident from oompression of the outside spiral iron casing. Themanufacture of the centre portion of the cable has also been begun. In order to avoid risk from the first strain at starting, about five or dx miles of the centre willbe made of the strongest steel wire. In place of twisted strands the cable will here be bound with 18 No. 13 solid wires of steel, so that this part of the telegraph will, it is asserted, bear a strain of 12 tons with safety, or nearly twice the amount of dead strain that is likely to como upon it at the first c,utset. Thepreparations forshippingthe cable arenearlyfinished, andthe operation of trans£erringthe ponderous coils from the factoryto the hold of theAgamemnonwMcommecoonTcensday or Wednesday next Workmen from the dockyards are now engaged in laying down moorings for the Agamemnon, wbich wil arrive off Glasse and EllioVs to-morrow (Saturday) morning. No less than 10 anchors have been fixed to secure her from motion while this important work is going forward From the factory to the sideof the ship l barges will be moored stem and stern, and along these the cable vill be slowly wound by a 12-horse power engine, It will be stowed away inthe hold lziene tremendous ooil 45 feet in diameter and nearly 12 feet high. No vessel better suited than the Agememnonfor this purpose could be found in the navy. There is not the least ground for the report that the United States'frirte Niagara is not to take the other half of the cable, manufactured by Newall at Birkenhead. At first there were some doubts as to whether it was worth while to make certin alterations In the vessel, which were necessary in order to avoid risk in paying out the coiL But this question has been defiLitively decided, and either last night or this morning the Niagara quitted the Thames for Portsmouth Dockyard, where some of her stanchions wiU be taken out, and her fine ward-roon not a little disfigured to accommodate her long passenger. This vessel is undoubtedlY not so well suited forthework as the Agamemnon, and on board of her the cable will have to be piled in two or three coils, fore and aft, an arrangement which would have been better avoided, if itwere possible. Bothat Birkenhead and at East Greenwich the manufacture of the cable at one end will be continued, while the other end is being shipped. In fact, both firms will work up to the last moment, in order that in paying out across the Atlantic a liberal allowance may be made for slack without fear of running short. The Susquehanna will accompany the Nwiagara, and we believe the Leopard goes with the Aga. memnon. All the vessels will rendezvous at Cork harbour, when the final arrangements will be madeas to starting. The Cyclops is now out in the Atlantio taking soundings along the proposed deep sea route. At Messrm Glasse and Elliot's yard a fine submarine cable is beingmade fortheNorwegian Government. This is, as far as we are aware, probably the first electric telegraph which has ever been used for fishing purposes. During the fishing season the shoals of herrings enter the fiords of Norway at most unexpected intervals, and at places where often not, more than one or two fishing boats are to be found. Before the boats from the surrounding bays and fiords eanbe summoned to the spoil the herrings have generally spawned and are away to sea again. To prevent these repeated disappointments and losses to the fishermen, the Norwegian Governmett is about to lay a submarine cable along some 50 miles of the coast most frequented bv the shoals, with laud stations at short distances communi eating with the fishing village The instant the shoal is seen in the offing, therefore (and it can always be known at a distance by the whales which snrround it), a message will be sent along the coast telling each village the fiord or bay which it has entered. Alas for the poor herrings ! What will become of them now that scienoo entersthe deep agdnat them and their enemy lurks in their watery home? They may elude whales and fishing boats, defy tides, winds, and waves, but what can they do against the electric currnt ?

THE. LYW BISHOP OF NORWICH. Tho ceremony of uconfirmng the election of the Hon. and Rev. John Thomas Pelham, D.D., to the Bishopric of Norwich took place yesterday. The preliminary proceed. h3gs were held in the hal of the College ot Advocates in Doctors'.commons, where the Lord Bishop eleet was received by the Vicar-General of the Archbishop of Canter. bury, and, having signed the schedule of consent to his election, proceeded with the Vicar-General to Bow Church. After the Litany had been read by the rector, the Rev. Marshall Hal1 Vine, the Vicar.General, Dr. Travers Twfss, took his aeat at a table in the body of the church, the Bishop elect remaining in his pew. The Proctor for the Dean and Chapter of Norwich, Mr. H. A. Bathurst, then preEented to the Vicar-General the letters patent of the Queen issued under the Great Seal, *hich the VicarGeneraldirectedcthe Principal Registrarof the Province, Mr. F. Hart Dyke, to read aloud; after which the Proctor forthe Dean and Chapter prayed the Vicar-General to proceed ccording to the letters patent. The Bishop e.ect then advanced from his pew and took his seat at the table opposite to the Vicar-General, when the Proctor for the Dean and Chapter exhibited the original mandate, with a oertificate endorsed thereupon, and prayed that all and ingular the opposers of the election, if any, should be publicly preconized. The Vicar-General thereupon directed that the opposers should bie publicly called, upon which the apparitor, Mr. Barber, made the usual and somewhat quaint proclamation, to the effect that all persons who wished to oppose the said election should appear. No opponent having appeared, the Vicar-General, at the prayer of the Proctor of the Dean and Chapter, read aloud the first schedule and signed it. The Proctor then presented a summary petition which the Vicar-General admitted and decreed a terni to prove it immediately. Tho Proctor thereupon exhibited the certificate of the election of the Hon. and Rev. John Thomas Pelham, D.D., with the instrimentof consent signed by the Bishop elect, which the Vicar-General admitted and assigned to bear sentence instantly, and decreed a further citation of opponent, if any vished to appear. Procla&nation having been again made in the usual form, the Vicar-General read the second sckedule and signed it. The Bishop elect then knelt down before the Vicar-General and took the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, canonical obedience, and against simony. The Proctor for the Dean and Chapter then prayed a definitive sentence, which the Vicar-General thereupon read aloud, as follows:- "In the name of God, Amen, We, Travers Twiss, Doctorof Laws,Vicar-General and official principalhawfully constituted of the Most Rev. Father in God, John Bird, by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England and Metropolitan, being hereunto sufficiently and lawfully authorized, and having heard, seen, understood, and discussed the merits and circumstnces of a certain business of confiTaatien of an election made andc elebrated of the person of the Hon. and Rev.

THE FBrEND oF THE SCOZZS0H LUNATICS TO TEHE EDITORj OF TEE TI3iES. Sir,-Perhaps the interest excited by Mr. Ellioe's state. mentin the House of Commons last Friday evening will justify me in communicating through your medium a few particulars regarding the orypn of the commission which has brought out such au appalling series of facts regarding pauper lunatics in Scotland. The appointment of the commission was wholly owing to the exertions of the American lady who has been referred to, Miss Dix. Originaly a teacher at Boston, this remarkable person no sooner became pomssesd of a small iuidepen. dency than she devoted herself to the improvement of the condition of lunatics in her own country. It will scacely he credited, yet I am assured it is strictly true, that Miss Dix has been the means of inducing 19 of the American local Legislatures to erectandendowStatelunatic asylums. Of such weally constitution that she can scarcely walk half a mile at aftime, she has travelled over the whole States, seeking to do good in this way, often in the south-western States encountering the most serious dangers to life, oonstantly submitting to the greatest personal discomforts. She also was the means of raising lighthouses and establishi ng lifeboats in many parts of the American CoaSt. On one occasion, having gone to Table Island, personally to arrange a set of lifeboats for that perilous locality, she had the gratification of superintending measures by which, the very next day, ship wreckedparty was saved. Havingcome to Scotland at the beginAing of 1855-on which occasion I had the honour of receiving her as a guest-she soon became aware that there was a wan' of proper legal arrangements for the protection of pauper lunatics. She made all possible exertions to obtaun admission to the private asylums in which miny of these wretched creatures were kept; but, not suooedinz in getting official aid, she only could learn enough to &ix a strong suspicon in her mind that bad arranjtements, oruelty, and neglect existed to a dreadful extent. She then proceeded to London, with an introduction to the Duke of Ay ndoneortwo other Wmistrs, tomakerepresentations on thesubject,when suchwas herenergythat shedrovedireot from the railway station to the residenoes of thwse persons, and ctually before changing her dress or even entering a lodging had succeeded in obtaining promise tha a commisson should be appointed. Miss Dix has sinoe returned to her own country, and it is in the midst of continued usefulnessin the same field there that she will hear how the British House of Commons ha thrilled with the reetal for which she was the means of furnising the materials. I cannot but meanwhile accept it as a great discredit to my native country, not merely that such evils existed in it, but that their existence was overlooked by her clergy, her officials, and her philanthropists andleft to be detoctea and brought to light by a fragile woman-an Anericanby birth, a naan in creed-a sperson wholly without local influence, and who could have no motivefor interference beyond the promptinqgs of a noble benevolence. * lam.

TO THE EDITOB OFTHE TIME.S. Sir,-In your notice on Saturday last of the election of a bishop for the diocess of Aberdeen it was stated that the rev. gentleman chosen was understood to belong to the "Evangelical" party. To this opithet, in its just and originalfs*nificance no clergyman, and no Christian, can possibly object. As, however, the term has somietimes been technically limited, I may, perhaps, be permitted to explain that the bishop elect is characterized by his affection for what our older divines used to call " the moderation of the churoh of Egland," by a cosequent distaste for tbeological extremes of any kind, by a large-minded love of conciliation and for- earance, and by a wish, in his own words of last week, to be neither Darned nor known as "a p arty san."

Now, from this statement it would Daty be inferred that a house and four acrs of land coastituted the whole endowmnent of Colubrook, wherea there is an endowment of about 100l. a-year arising from the rent of houses in Drury-lane and premises in Long-acre, left by hMr. George Towrnsend, of Lincoln's.inn, who died in 1683.

NfRCARAY'ILE MARINE. TO THE EDITIOR OF TaE TIMES. Sir,-The following paragraph appeared in the City Ar. tide of The Time of yesterday:- "At a meeting on Friday of the Shipwrecked Mainers Society it was resolved to appropriate 5,0001. of its funded property to head a subscription for an institution to be called the Royal Hospital forWorn-out and Disabled Merchant Seamen-England, it is said, notwithstanding ber pre-eminent intereste, having hitherto in thi subject been behind most other cotntries. A public meeting is proposed to be called at an early date at the Mansion-house ln aid of the work thum commenced, mid the co-operation of the Board of Trade is relied on." England is probably more indebted to her mercantile marine for her high position among the nations of the world than to any other single cause. No doubt her industrial and inventive capabilities are strongly brought into action in the agricultural and mnann factring operations of her inhabitants. It is, however, in her commercial enterprise that the unbounded spirit and energy of the national character can have free scope and receive its 3nasculine formation. In other vocations men's powers of endurance are occasionally tested, but in the ordinary occupatiens of the sailor hardship and privationform the normal condition. Do what he will, this is inevitable-sufferance is the badge of all the tribe. Ameliorating inflaences, bo&lb mora1 and physical, may be introduced, but all the maudln sentimentality and all the hairsplitting legislation in the world cannot change the unalterable lot of the sailor, which is, from the very nature of his calling, one of almost unmitigated hardship. Notwithstanding all this, however, there is no calling in. vestedwithsuch a charm. The wondersof thedeepaindthe adventures of the hardy railor ploughing the ocean form the Araian ANighs Rnter&rinmernt of the nurseries in the homes of England, and give shape and direction to the romantic aspirations of its schools. Commercial enterprise and adventure have thereforo been gratly instrumental in forming the nautical character in a manly mould, in producing and diffausing the material wealth which enables the nation to provide its securest source of defence, and in training the men who alone can effectully defend the country in her hour of greatest need, which is yet to come. Thenierchant marine does all this for the country, and what does it get in return ? I don't speak of its commanders and offioers, who will, I trust, ere long be able to take ca of themselves, but of the mass of seafaring population -the 300,000 hardy, patient, and enduring men, and the -inlionof women and children forming their families, and wholly dependent on them for breAL It would scarcely be crodited by foreigners that England, the greatest commercial nation of ieo earth, whose flag floats on every sa and penetrates every estuary and rlver, whose colonies, by means of her commercial pre-eminence, girdle the earth, has no national provision for her wornout sailors to whom she owes E9 much; that, so far from being specially favoured on account of the great and acknowledged national obligations laid upon them, they are, in addition to being obliged to bear their share of the ordinary burdens of the country, specialy taxed to pay for things which the country at large ought in justicoe to pay for; that, in short, the mass of our manly-spirited, hardy merchant and coasting sailors-the nursery from which our fleets are manned-are allowed, when old and helpless, or when from any otber cause they become unable to endure the arduous labours and hardship of sealife, to be absorb ed in the pauper portion of the community. I tut this national reproach will ere long be removed. oet us, however, not begin to remove it in a peddling spirit. let it be done in a maner worthy of the nation. It would Ill become me or any sailor to undervalue or throw cold water on any display of active benevolent feeling towards the merchant marine such as that referred to in the paragraph quoted. I would, however, with all respect to those who aro about taking part in this matter in the way indicated, nrge them not to lend themselves to any system of playing at charity, or join in any crude, immature scheme which will break down in the worldng, or of which, at beat, if carried out, the country would have no reason to be proud. The sailor ought not to be dealt with like a pauper suing for alns. As long as health remains, which is Eeldom to old age, he is employed in increasing the national wealth and contributing to the nation's physical and defensive resources, as well as doing the work of his immediate employers. Daring this time he is subjeced to special taxes, which, if properly administered for his exclusive use, would support noble aylums, capable of providing for thousands of inmates at the principalseports of the kingdom. Here isa practical WyA_ There is annually collected from the merchant marine under various heads, a large amount of money, called collectively tho "Mercantile Marine Fund." In 1856, according to a Parlianentary return ordered the 11th of May, 18557, this amounted, in round numbers, to 443,000., of which 353,0001. was collected from merchant vessels as light dues, and the remainder from various sources By the expenditure side of the account it appears that 203,0001. of this was appropriated to the building and maintenance of te lighthouses round the coats of the united kingdom. Without going intoparticulars of theotherheads of expenditure, there was at the end of the. year, according to the zeturn, an excess.of income over worldng expenditure of no less than 165,0001. Now, here is something to begin witb, which undoubtedly belongs to the merchant marine-a seed *hat if caefully nd wisely tended, may be made to produia glorious fruit for " poor Jack." It was the ovowed intention of Sir Robert Peel to provide for the maintenance of the national coast lighthouses out of the consolidated fund. Nothing oould be fairer or more reasonable. The nation's ships-of-war derive as much benefit from them as merchant vessels, and every oonsumer or producer ofour Imports or exports as much as either. It is only just, therefore, that the nation at large should pay the expense. If this were done there would be an increasing fund, amounting to upwards of 400,0001. a-year, that might justly be applied to the support of our worn-out and disbled sailors. Then, with regard to the erection of the neoessary buildings in the first irnsce, it may fairly be said, as the merchant sailors contributed so many years towards the support of Greenwich Hospital, it would not be too much to expect the Government in returnto furnish the funds to build the asylums forthemerchantamarine. Itis,however, to be feared that the mantle of Sir Robert Peel has fallen on shoulders of sthnted growth, and that we need not therefore, just yet, expect o generous an act as the appropriation of the amount now expended for the maintenance of the national lighthouses (which is raised off the merchant maine) tothe maintenance of our wom-out sailors. Atall t vents, we have the 165,0001-that is, the exoess of income ever expenditure in the merntile marine fund-to begin witb. No Government having a desire to deal justly, no lo say generously, towards the merchantmarine, can refuse 1o give this. Nothing would contributo more to promote the growth of improved and orderly habits and patriotic attachment to his native country in the British sailor than the knowledge thst there is a comfortable asylum waiting for is eald age sadinfirmity, on the simple condition of his mnintaining a goohcharcter during the poriod of his eagoing life. - I , Sir, Your obedient servant- -J. xL XNGsI,F.n u kbj *Z4Qhai mauof to me;hait M&ine SQuhp 0, Jie 3. * ProtctionAditiUoA. -

Mr. John Browning, a respectable trademan, who has carried on business in that city as a painter and plterer for the last 3D yeasr, was charged with stealing 91lb. of lead from the roof of a house occupied bya 1n. Clarke at Shirehampton. From the evidence of the several witnesses it appeared that the prisoner had undertaken a contract to reDair the roofs of several houss at Shirehampton, ad on Satdy lat wanting a piece of lead about a foot and a half long, he deliberately went to the roof of the house in question, and which nearly adjoined those on which hisworkmen were engaged, andcut the required quantity from the gatter. The inmates of the house, hearing an unusual noise on the roof, went to an attic window to see what was the matter, when they discovered the prisoner in the Act of rolling up the lead preparatory to taking it away. Finding he was disoovered, the pisoner begged them to say nothngabout the matter, and. he would replace the property. The parties, however, refused to compromise the theft, and ent for a policeman, but in the meantime the prisoner had nailed the lead in its former osition. In his defence he said he was under the impresson that the house from which he took the lead be. longed to the same lndlord as the houses which he was re pairing. Committed for three months' imprisonineut. IL,I?NESS OF LORD FflzADI2rGE.Intelligenoe received from the Castle on Wednesday evening is,we regret to say, of an unfavourable charcter.

PARIIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE HIOUSE OF LORDS, THURSDAY, JvNE 4. The LO11D CH-tXCKLLOR took his seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock. The Duke of CLEVELAND presented a petition from civil servauts of the Crown in the county of Dnrham, praying for an amendment in the Superannuation Act. The noble duke said he should have great pleasure ma supporting any measure for this purpose. Lord CAll PBELL presented a petition from Mr. Duncan, the proprietor of the Durlao County Advertiser, praying for an amendment in the law of libel in respect to bond jide ieports of the proceedings at public meetings. The Dake of CLEVELAND was afraid that if newspapers were allowed to publish everything that anyone chose to say at a public meeting the public at large would be great sufferers. Lord CAMPBELL also presented a petition from the Society for the Suppression of Vice complaining of the lilliculby experienced by them in checking the sae of immoral pubications, oinug to the present state of the law and praying that a summary jurisdiction mav be iven to magistrates in such cases, as in the case of bettinghaollcs. Lord FEVERSHAM presented a petition from ship,owners and merchants of the port of Scarborough, stating their dissatisfaction with the maritime laws of this country, and praying for their revision. The Earl of DERBY presented various petitions praying for an amendment of the Superannuation Act. The Marquis of WESTMINSTER asked their lorship3 to give a first reading to a BiU for the better regulation of sea bathing at watering places in the county of Kent. The noble Marquis said, that having no connexion with the county of Kent, it was necessary for him to state that his reason for taking charge of this BiU was that, having been staying at Ramsgate last year, several magistrates resident there and at Margate had brought under his notice the indecent mauner of bathing practised there, and had requested him to briDg 'he subject under the attention of the Legislature. SALE OF POISONS BILL. Earl GRANVILLE, in moving that the House go into committee on this Bill, briefly explained the nature of its provisions. Tho object of the BiU was twofold-to prevenS, if possible, the sale of poisons for the commission of murder on the one hand, and the occutrence of accidents by the sale of poisons by mistake on the other. These were objects the importance of which aU their Lordships woald admit., whatever difference of opinion might exist as to the manner of carrying them out. The Bill enumerated in a general way those poisons most generally used in the commission of crime-these being spesified in a schedule attached,-and there was also given a list of excepted com. pounds, such as wereprepared according to the directions of the Pharmacop aias of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin. The poisons subjected to restrictions, and mentioned in the schedule, might be added to by an order of Her Majesty in Council, and the same authority might also modify the schedule exeimpting cexi Lain compounds from these restdctions. The fifth clause contained a provision by which poison could only be sold to a person of full age, in the presence of a witness of fuU age, and that on the production of a certificate by the purehaer, signed by a legally qualified medical practioner, a justice of the peace, or by the clergyman of the parish, ard to that it was proposed to add, by any two resident householders. The sixth clause provided that the seller should make an entry in a book of each sale, stating the date of sale and of the delivery, the name and address of tho purchaser, the name and quantity of the poison sold, and the purpose for which it was required. The existence of this book would, it was believed, be an important element in the prosecution of criminal cases from poisoning that ULight arise. The next clause referred to the covering of the bottles, &c., used in the sale of poisons, and provided that all poisons sold should have a covering of tinfoil distinctly labelled with the address of the seUer and with the word *'poison" moulded on the bottle. Another provision of great importance was to the effect that no colourless poison Should be sold in a solid state unless it was mixed with a roportion of soot or indigo; and that in the case of colourl1ess liquid poisons they should be mixed with a certain (luantity of the solution of archil. These colouring articles bad been fixed on as being in their nature cheap and easily found in any part of the country. Then came a very important clause, providing that where medical prescriptions were given these formalities might be dispense I with, and that they should have no application to the sale of poisons by wholesale to retail dealers. There were at present 16,000 people engaged in -the sale of poisons, without any restriction whatever as to the part of the premises in which those poisons should be liept, and without being required tokeep them separatefrom other articles, or under look and key -a state of things which had led to many deplorable accidents and mistakes. There were 500 cases every year of deaths from poisoning, e:ther intentional or unintentional, and there was reason to believe that not more than one case out of three or four that actually occurred camoe o the knowledge of the Registrar-General. To avoid as far a3 possible the sale of poisons by mistake, it was provided by the Bill that they shoald be distinctly labelled and kept apart from other articles in the shop or dispensary. He did not think this was a perfect },ill, nor, indeed, did he believe it possible to legislate so as entirely to prevent intentional and unintentional poisoning; hut he thought the very reasonable and moderate restriotions laid down in the measure would, in the main, tend in a very s:mple way to diminish the nmunber of deaths that were now occasioned in this unhappy manner. (Hear, hear.) Lord CAMPBELL said, thero could be no doubt that great evils now sprung from the manner in which poisons were sold, and he rejoiced that the subject had been taken up by the Government. He most warmly thanked his noble friend for the Bin which he had submitted to the If ouse, arid would be prepared to give it all the support in Lis power. He would take the present opportunity of cal'ing their lordships' attention to another kind of poison -that was sold to the public-moral poisons, that were as destructive to the mind as these were to the body. The sale of indecent publications was greatly on the increase, and he hoped soniething would be done to check so flagrant an ,evil. The Marquis of WESTMEATH gave an explanation respecting a case which he had brought under the notice of the House in the last Parliament, when he stated that poison had been dealt o-st by two striplings. The chemist wished him to state that one of the parties was an assistant, and not a stripling. The Earl of HARDWICKE thought, from the tone of tlle noble earl in stating the details of the Bill, that he was rather doubtful of its success, and he (Lord Hardwicke) doubted whether any form of words would perfectly accomplish the object at which the Bin was aimed. The present measure certainlyKwould materially affect the interests of the cbyinists of this country, and would he was assured, if passed compel the closing of two-thirs of the druggists' shops throughout England. He was informed that poisons were so commonly used in trade and mLanufactures that even if the Bin passed there would still remain facilitles for those who desired it to obtain them. Among other thiDgs mentioned in the Bin was a ntimony, but antimonial wine was known as an emetic in ordinary use; but if the Bill passed that medicine could not be sold without the risk to the seUer of incurrin" the yenalties prescribed in the BilL It was the same with sal aimminoniac and oxalic acid, which were both used extensively for many purposes, and he was reminded by a noble friend that the latter article was requisite for cleaning boot tops. If this Bill pawsed there would be a pretty turn out in the Leicestershire hunting field. (A laugh.) Chloroform would be prohibited, and the sale of patent medicines, many of which contained preparations of opiunm, and other drugs which the Bin would make poisons, almost annniilated. The noble earl had stated that all poisons should *e vended only in square bottles, but in many medicines prescribed by physicians poisons formed ingredients, and under the proposed law the patient upon seeing the square bottles weold know that they contained pison, and might naturally le disinclined to tale the medicine. There were many e,ther matters of detail upon which grave objections had been made, and he honed that before the Bill was finally -disposed of the noble-earl would receive the benefit of the Fug&estions which a deputation from the l'harmaceutical Society were anxious to ofter him. Lord TALBOT DE MALAHIDE was of opinion that 1etter means might be devised to attain the object of the Bill, and thought that a bright example had been set by Ireland in that respeet. He found that many of the clauses in the Bill were taken from the Irish Apothecaries Act of 1791-an Act which bad been found most beneficial, and of -which no one had complained. One evil which existed which would interfere in the working of this or any other similarnmeasure was the differencebetweenthepharmaeopoeias -of the three 'kingdoms, and it wrould be a great advantage if those distinctions could be abolished. In the Billan attempt -was made to define poisons, which he thought was most dangerous, and would suggest that no definition should be given, for if certain articles were stamnped as poisons it would stimulate the discovery of other substances having the same effect. He would also suggest that there shouldbe greater facilities forprosecutingapothecariesforsemng poison improperly. He believed that in Scotland, where there was a public prozecutor, there was notthe sameosaf eguard sagainstnoisoin as existed in the other divisions of the united ingdom The sheriffs in Scotland possessed the authority of coronez-s; ,ut inquests were of very rare ocourrence, and he was satis. ned teat many cases of poisoning escaped investigation. He regretted that it was proposed to exempt druggists and -h-ymists from the operation of the Medical Bills now before the House of Commons. He trusted that an attempt would be made to elevate their 8ktus, as in Ireland, and i batae law would be enacted to prevent persons not properly lu alified form sllnbg drugs. Lord REDES DALE suggested that the Bin should be referred to a select committee. (Hear, hear,) It was an attempt to legislate on a sub3ect upon which their lord. ships possessed no practical information, and he believed -that further inquiry would be found most useful. He also objected to the minute partieularity of the Bill. Earl GRANVILLE replied briefly to some of the remarks wbhich bad been made on the BilL The subject was one upon which it was no doubt extremely difficult to legislate; but, without saying that the present Bill, if passed into a law, would utterly prevent poisoning, he was satisfied it trGuld materially diminrih the evil. It wvold not meddle with substances taken as medicine dispensedunder pres0riplions, or with poisons used for the legitimate purposes of trade. He regretted that the pharmacopieins of tbe three liingdoms were not the same, bt waa glad to Btate that the respective Colleges of Physierina were now communicating with ono another with a view to that objet. He had not tbe slightest objection that the Bill should be referred to a select committee. (EHear.) A NOBLE LOBD expressed the opinion that ninny of tbe accidents from poiEoning occurred in consequence of pre,scriptions being written in Latin. The Bin was then referred to a select committee. DIVORCE AND MATRLMOVIAL CAUSES BILL, On the bringing up of the report of amoendments, Lord BOUIJ3l f 0 g.Sd that, although another oppor. tunity would occur of uttering his sentiments upon this Bill, yet nob having, from accidental circumstances, had the advantage of being present at the former stages, le thought it right to refer to one or two points Eupon the present occasion. He entertained a very strong objection to an omission in the Bill itself-of which, however, generally speaking, he entirely approved-and he hats objected to what had been called an "amendment" that had been made in committee, believing that in ths legislation they would not be able to find an instance in which the rword was more inaccurately appli-d. The strongest objection to the action for criminal conver. - sation-which on all, hands, or perhapa he ought rather to say, nce to his noble and learned friend on the wuolsack, on almost all hands, was admitted to be an evil-was the grievous and crying injusticO which was done ia the action to the unhappy wife of the plaintiff. Be. hind her back, without even the possibility of knowing that such an action was to be proceeded in, with no service of notice, with perfect facility to her husband of colluding with the adulterer or alleged adulterer, her character might be for ever ruined and undone. (EHear, hear.) Instances bad repeatedly occurred. Oa a former occasion one was mentioned in which an aCtion for criminal conversation was compromised by the family of the defendant by payment of a very trifling sum, all that the husband wanted being a verdict, preparatory to obtaining a divorce; and it turned out that not only was the wife perfectly guiltle.s, but the marriage bad never been consummated either by the husband or any other person. (Laughter.) These were strong arguments for abolishing the action for criminal conversation; but to a great degree the sameobjections applied to the proceedings under the Bill, for the husband might proceed against the wiFe, and the alleged adulterer have no Imowledge of those proceedings. The LOBD CHANCELLOR.-The proposal was to make them both defendants. Lord BROUGHAM said that did not appear by the Bill as reported. But he now came to the objection to whatwas called the amendment. Hle found that their lordships had invented a new species of divorce, and for that invention of theirs they would probably not deem it necessary that they should take out a patent, inasmuch as they might be quite sure no one would have any desire to pirate their invention or infringe their design. (A.laugh) It was aninventionof anew species of divorce, being neither separation a messd et thoro nor divorce a rinculo matrimonii, but partly one and ;artly the other, taking the defects and imperfecticns of both. It was partial and imperfect like divorce a mnscd et thoro, and irrevocable like divorce a vincudo. With respect to one party it was a complete divorce. The vinculuns was dissolved, the marriage was annihilated, and. one party might marry again. But with respect to the other party it was only half a divorce. That party could not marry again. He would take it that generally speaking the husband would be allowed to marry again, and not the wife. For this reason,-although the Bi somewhat dishonestly, as he thought, by way of appearing to give equaljstice, provided that either party mignt be prevented, if not the party pro. secuting the divorce, they knew very well that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it was the husband and not the wife who prosecuted for divorce. Substantially treated, the invention left the husband free, but, with the usual imperfection of all unnatural productions, left the wife not altogether free, nor altogether fettered. Part of her chain was removed, but some links were left clanking round the rags to which they were pleased to reduce her. She was not to marry again. She was doomed to the alternative of prostitution or waut-of sinning or starving-of the streets or the workhouse. (Cheers.) With all respect for their lordships, and all the proneness which he had to admire originalty of conception, he should be guilty of some of the inconsistency which marked this invention, and of no little of the hypocrisy which it tended to encourage were be to express admiration of the original genius which it displayed. (Cheers.) Supposing they put all violation of justice out of view (no little matter in an assembly which was the highest court of justica in the realm)-supposing they put all regard for morality out of view (no little sacrifice even for argument's sake to do so in a place adorned by the heads of the Church) (cheers)supposing justice and morality out of the question, and taking it upon the lower ground of expediency,-he wanted to know what they gained. (Hear, hear.) Their object was to prevent adultery. Had this invention such a tendency . What if it had no such tendency ? What if, on the contrary, it had a tendency to encourage the offence 9 And such was its tendency, unless he were told that, contrary to all the maxims and principles of our law, and contrary to fact,tbe woman, and not the man,was to be regarded as the principal offender. The law said, and experience proved, that it was rather the man than the woman, and this invention directly encouraged the mau in the offence by giving him an Act-of-Parliament guarantee against having to take to his home the accomplice of his guilt. (Hear, hear.) With respect to the woman, the loss of her stains as a wife, the loss of her position in society, the loss of intercourse with her children, the loss of everything which a woman valued most in social existence, afforded, as he thought, much better security against her going astray than this addition-unjustly, unchantably, and inexpediently preventing her marrying, not merely the adulterer, but any person. (Hear, hear.) He therefore took the view taken, he was sorry to say, by a minority of their lordships-and the more he considered the point the more confidently he held the opinion-that a greater blot never was affixed upon a measure in itself highly beneficial than had been imprinted upon this by the amendment to which he had now directed their attention. (Cheers.) Lord REDESDALE reminded the House that the noble lord (Lord Brougham) had altogether omitted one very important argument from his consideration in denouncing the amendment in question-namely, the fact that it was emphatically laid down in Holy Scripture that " whosoever married a woman that was divorced committed adultery." (Hear, hear.) Upon that authority the amendment was n- troduced, and the noble lord (Lord Brougham) might lay down a contrary doctrine, but so long as the amendment was clearly in accordance with the Word of God it would be his (Lord Redesdale's) duty to support it. Lord BROUGHAM said he was well aware that his uoble friend (Lord Redesdale) held that the passage of Scripture he had quoted was absolutely prohibitory; but his (Lord Brougham's) answer to that was, that his noble frien had propounded that doctrine 150 years too late ("hear, hear n and a laugh), for their lozdshipe House for a century and a half had gone on passing divorce Bills and allowing the guilty party to marry again. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DONOUGHMORE said he had supported the amendment in question when under the consideration of the committee, on the ground that he thought the party who had broken the marriage contract had no right to profit by his oriher own crime. The report was then reeeived. ADhMINISTRATION OF OATHS TO WITNESSES, Lord CAMPBELL, in moving the consideration of the report of the select committee on this subject, said the committee very early came to the resolution that in the practice of select committees of their lordships' House it would be a great improvement to abstain altogether from administering an oath to witnesses who came before them to speak to matters merely of opinion. They were of opinion that to swear a man that he must speak the truth on any speculative question of that sort was most pre. posterous (hear, hear), and that it was always a desirable thing to avoid unnecessary oaths. They therefore came to a unanimous decision to recommend the discontinuation of the practice of tendering oaths to a witness who came to speak only to matters of opinion, and he hoped their lordsaips would confirm that decision. But where there were contestedfactsandconflictiDgevidence,the committee considered that it was just as necessary to administeranoathto witnesses who came to depose to matters of fact in a committee of their lordships' House on a private Bi1 as it was In any court of law in the kingdom, The committee, however, had left the mode in which the oath should be administered in that case an open question; but he (Lord Campbell) was clearly of opinion that the witnesses ought to be sworn before the committee that sat upon the Bill, and not at the bar of the House. He concluded by moving, " That sele.t committees in future shall examinffe writnesses without their having been previously sworn, except in cases in which it may be otherwise ordered by the House J' and " That all obath, except in carsveas in whi,csh Itmay boterwiiseordered The resolutions were ut and agreed Wtoneminie contradicente andI the House ten, adjourned at half-past 6 o'clock.

THESIGER then rose and said,-It may be fr the convenieice of the House that I should state the course which I propose to pursue with regard to the Oaths Bill, the second reading of which is fixed for Monday next. At the time of the introduction of the Bill I stated to the noble lord at the head of the Government that it was my intention to postpone any opposition which I might offer to the Bill to the second reading. Since that time I have had an opportunity of fully considering the form of oath proposed by the noble lord, and also of consulting with those friends who hold the same views as myself with regard to this question, and we are all of opinion that the oaths proposed by the noble lord are in many respects an improvement upon the oaths at present taken, both on the score of simplicity, and also as putting an end to the taking of oaths the necessity for which has become obsolete. (Hear, hear.) Our only objection to the oaths proposed by the noble lord is that they may be taken by persons who are not compelled to declare themselves Christians. (Hear.) In order to carry out the object which we have in view it would be necessary to insert certain words in the oath, and that cannot be done upon the second reading. What I propose to do, therefore, is to offer no opposition to the second reading of the Bill (hear, hear), but in committee I shall propose the insertion of certain words which will preserve the Choistian character of these oaths. (Hear, hear.) In thab manner I shall raise the simple question without the admixture of any foreign matter, whether this House is prepared to admit to the Legislature persons who do not profess the Christian faith? (Hear,hear.) I have thought it only due to this House to state thus briefly the course which I propose to adopt. (Hear, hear.) The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-AftAr what has falen from the hon. and learned gentleman, I beg to state that should there be no prolonged discussion on ionday next with regard to the Oaths BilL we propose to continue the Committee of Supply, and if the army estimates should be concladed to-morrow (this day) to go on with the miscellaneous estimates on Monday. PAPER DUTY. Mr. G. A. HAMLTON asked whether it was the intention of the Government, with a view to the promotion of education, to propose any measure for granting a drawback on the paper daty as rngards paper and books used for the purposes of education? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, he had no intention at present of introducing a measure with that PAUPER LUlTATICS, Mr. KINNAIRD asked the President of the Poor Law Board whether he had received any communication from the board of guardians of St. Msaylebone in answer to the report of the Commissioners of Lunacy, and if so, whether he had any objection So lay such communication upon the table of the House; also whether any steps were about to be taken for the purpose of preventing the continuance of the system now prevailing in Marylebone workhouse with respect to the treatment of pauper lunatics ? Mr. BOUVERIE said that a letter had been received from the board of guardians of the parish, accompanied by a copy of a report of a committee of their own body uaon the subject of the hon. member's question, in which they rec6mmended that certain steps should be taken with the view of remedying the evils which they admitted to exist In conhexion with the Maiylebone workhouse. Sbseanently to Itle reception of that communication he bad eemea it desirable that the inspector of the metropolitan district shobld attend a meeting of the board-as by law he was entitled to do, and consult with its members as to the steps wh4ch ought to be taken forthe purpose of devising a remedy for Ihe evils to which they had adverted. That gentleman ha; accordingly attended a meeting of the board, but had been requested to walk out of the room, and had been obliged to do so (a laugh), the guardians refusing to admit his nght to interfere in their deliberations. He (Mr. Bouvere) bad4 however, been informed that such a right did exist in accoreance with strict statutary provision, and he had therefore thought it to be his duty to take proceedings with the view of vindicating that right. He had no objection to lay upon the table any paPers connected with the subject for which his hon. friend might deem it desirable to move, and he might add that an inspector, who had been elected by the guardians, had recently visited the workbouse,and had made a report to the Poor Law Board to the effect that, so far as the accommodation afforded by the workhouse would admit, every effort was being made to place the inmates upon a satisfactory foeting. Under these circumstances he was not prepared to say that any substantial steps would at once be taken in the matter, TURNPIKE TOLLS. In answer to Ar. CowAx, Lord ELCaO said he did not propose to introduce during the present session any Bill for the purpose of abolishing tolls levied at turnpikes and bridges. He hoped, however, to be in a position to do so at the commencement of the ensuing session. CHEURCH-RA-TES. Sir J. TRELAWNY.-I wish to ask the noble lord at the head of the Government whether it is his intention to introduce a Bill this seseion on the subject of church-rates I Lord PALMERSTON.-The Government have a measure upon the subject in course of preparation, and we hope to be able before long to submit it to the consideration of the House. Sir J. TRELAWNY.-The answer of the noble lord doe3 not appe to rime to besatisfactory and Ifear I sbaU therefore bo Udaer thcX 5tY 9f bringng forwaxd this evwing thg houses of the best construcUon are In progress of erection. XMv right hon. friend also carried a measure regulating the whole system of pilotage in tho ort of London, by which, if I am not mistaken, the snipping interest benefited -to the extent of 20,0001. a-year. (Rear, hear.) larnshocked at the time I have detained thb House, but reanl l sense of justice has compelled me to bear evidence on tyiS subject. The noble lord at the head of the Government, who has an intimate knowledge of the subject, and whose experience with reference to the past is greater than mine, wll caonfirm the accuracy of wbat I have stated. I rejoice that the Government have not yielded for one moment to the solicitation of the hon. gentleman for a committee and vill firmly resist this motion. I hope they will maintain the existence of this great department m the State, the value of which I think incalculable. Experience may suggest small alterations in its constitution, but the outline of the department is a good and sound one, and, in my humble judgment, is well worthy of being preserved. (Cheers) Mr. BENTINCK thought a complete case had been made out for inquiry. The principle of a hoard was essentially bad. It was perfectly impossible, where divided responsibility existed, that any business should be satisfactorily oa r- ried on. Men were placed at the head both of the Board of Admiralty and the Board of Trade who could not, let their talents be what they might, have any previons know. ledge of the subjects they bad to deal with. The rigt hon. baronet, among other subjects, had referred in a tone of extreme congratulation to the repeal of the navigation laws and to the great increase in our mercantile marine consequent upon that repeal . (ear, hear.) Now, this was no test whatever of benefits conferred by this measure.SThe only fair waywas to lcok at what had been the effect of the repeal, not upon our commercial marino alone, but upon the shipping of other countries. Now, it might easily be shown that, though,the effect of the repeal of the navigation laws had been to increase the commerce of this country, it had increased the commerce both of France and America in a very much larger proportion. (Ministerial cries of "Hear.) This wa the onlyfair testto apply, and itwasevidenttbat lfthe present system were continued our position as the greatest commercial country in the world could not be long maintained. Perhaps he was wrong, but he thought he recollected Admiral Berkeley, the late member for Glocester, telling the House that the great difficulty in manning the navy arose from the repeal of the navigation laws. Another question to which the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle had referred was, the balance of trade. He hoped that either the right hon. baronet, or some equally competent authority would inform the House vhy it was that since the introduction of the new system of legislation the balance of trade had invariably been against us. Sir G. PECHELL was not aware that AdmirAl Berkeley had attributed the difficulty in manning the navyl to tho repeal of the navigation laws. There was one thing, however, which he did remember, and that was that every naval officer in that House, except the hon. and gaUant member for Bath, supported the Bill which abolished those laws. He charged the Board of Trade with officious interference with business unconnected with its own department, and with the publication of reports and returns devoid of informnaion. It had recently usurped one of the functions of Parliament by taking power, through the instrumentality of an order in Council, to extend the provisions of the Act for regulating the oyster fsheries in the Channel to all the sea coasts of the unitecd kingdom. Helwould give his cordial suppolt to the motion of the hon. member fo- 1iverpooL M. LOWE said, that if he did not mae, in answer to the speeches which they had heard that evening, so satisfactory a statement as he could wisb, he mnust throw himself upon the indulgence of the House, because he had been submitted to an ordeal which it would be difficult for any public officer to pass through with credit, even if he were - competent for the situation which he held, whereas, by the hypothesis of tho hon. member for Liverpool, he (Mrlowe) was not competent to discharge the duties of his office. He had gone down to the House prepared to meet the allegation of the hon. member for Liverpool that there ought to be an alteration in the constitution of the Board of Trade; but it was not likely that he could be prepared thoroughly to answer every possible case which any gentleman might bring against the Board of Trade, without the papers beforehim, andwithoutany notice having been given of the questions. (Hear, hear.) He submitted that it would be better, if gentlemen had complaints to make of a public department, that they ahould do so either by a motion for papers or a vote of cen sure. That would rase the case distinctly, and it would enable the House to come to a definite decision-not upon an ezpaHre statement, as the hon, member for West Norfolk had done-but after hearing both sides of the case. The hon. member fo rLiverpool had disposod of one part of his own motion very satisfactorily, becauso after the history with which he had favoured the House it surely would be munecessary for any committee to inquire into the origin of the Board of Trade. Neither would it be necessary to enter very minutely into Mr. Burke's description of that department, because, exoppt that the name was stil retained, there vas no similarity whatever between the two establishments. The Board of Trade in Mr. Burke's day -consisted of eight members of Parliament, who received 1,0001. a-year each for doing nothing, so far as he (Mr. Lowe) could understand. Among the members, however, the Board had the honour of including Mr. Gibbon. They had to regulate trade; but as the powers vested in them for that purpose were only those of the Queen's prerogative, whioh were of no practical avail, and as they had no statutory powers whatever, they had nothing to do but to pocket their salaries. That Ilagrant and corrupt institution, as it had been caUed, had been swept away and the present Board of Trade was not in realty a boQM at alL It consisted of a nominal board, appointed at the commencement of every reign, of great otticers of State who never sat, and it was really confined to a President and Vice-President. It had nothing in common with the board of Mr. Burke. Its whole authority was of a statutory character, delegated to it from time to timeby that louse, when there was any public duty to be performed which, in the opinion of the Rouse, it was calculated satisfactorily to discharge; and it was no small testimony to the efficiency of the Board of Trade that during the last 30 years the Legislature had been in the habit, when they wanted a hody to 'act with intelligence and impartiality between the public and any private interest, of uniformly selecting the Board of Trade for such a purpose. (Hear.) Scarcely a private Act was pacsed without something being delegated to the Board of Trade, and he hoped to be able to show to the House thatthe department had not faded in the exercise of those functions with which it hadbeen entrusted. The only argument with which the hon. member for Liverpool had favoured them in support of his view of the necessity of altering the constitution of the Board of Trade was founded on the allegation that it had too much to do. He (Mr. Lowe) did not know that that was a very logical way of arguing, because if a department had too mach to do the remedy was simple-it was not to alter the constitution of the board, but to relieve it of some of the burdens which had been imposed noon it. If that were what the hon. gentleman meant he r. we) claimed his thanks, for during the last few years tho main occupation of the Board of Trade had been the relieving itself from a number of unnecessary burdens with which the country had injudiciously trammelled it. (Hew, hear. It miht, he thought, be justly said that the Board of Trade had been the grave of Protection, for it was from the Board of Trade, m 1840, that there went forth that invaluable evidence before the committee on tbe import trade given by Mr. John Deacon ulume-a man whose namo never could be mentioned with. out respect, whose convincing testimony before that committee shook the whole fabric of Protection to its very centre, and carried conviction to the minds of many people who had failed to be convinced before. (Hear, hear.) No more remarkable evidence, perhaps, could be adduced of the benefit which the country might derive from the possession of such men, who, trained to official life frem their earliest years, obtained a knowledge of the springs of action, and were enabled by their acquaintance with the practical workings of different measures to trace effects to causes, and to reason from results in a manner that could be accomplished, probably, by no other system of training. (Hear, hear.) The Board of Trade, then, was censured because it had too much to do. It had got rid, however, of treaties of reciprocity, because it had been the main agent in establishing those principles which rendered reciprocity treaties obsolet and unnecessary. It had got rid also of a vast quantity of business relating to joint-steck companies, by instituting the principle that people might establish joint-stock companies for themselves. Moreover, the interference of the home Government with the colonies had of late years been greatly lessened, and the functions of the Beard of Trade m that respect, therefore, had also been greatly diminished. So far, then,he claimedthe thanks of the hon. member for Liverpool, became, having too much to do, the board had been con. stautly endeavouring to rectify that error by the inculcation and establishment of sound principles which would work efficiently of themselves, without the intervention of any department of the Government at alL (Hear, hear.) He now came tothe charges which had been brought against the Board of Trade and he should deal vnth the last first. T'he hon. and gallant membcer for Brighton had stated that, the Government having completed atreaty with France with retard to oysters, the Board of Trade had by means of an Order in Council made that treaty more stringent. Exactly the contrary, however, was tho case. The Foreign. cffice had made a treaty with France that oysters should not be removed during the four months which did not conta;n in them the letter B,-May, June, July, and August-when those delicacies were not supposed to be in good condition for consumption. Thattreaty, however, he apprehended only applied to oysters intended to be eaten* but he understood that it was considered necessary in the oyster trade that they should he tansferred during those nmonths from one 'ed to another. But that sort of removal appeared to ccme itbin the techzical meaning of the treaty, and, as great difficulty and annoyance resulted from it, the Board of Trade obtained an alteration in the treaty enabling the removal of oysters during those months, not for the purpcse of being consumed, but of being transferred to resh pasturage. That was the Order in Council which the .Ion. and gallant admiral had stigmatized as a cruelinfringe. avent by the Board of Trade upon the sights of the oyster fi,Seimen. In effect it was just the contrary. (Hear, hear.) Tben the hon. member for Liverpool accused the Board of Trade of being the enemies of local self-government. But it was the principal duty of thle Board of Trade to stand as an impartial arbiter between great interests, such as the rsilway or the shipping interest, and the public. That was .he duty which the board had to discbarge, and in the performance of it, with what intelligence, impartiality, and integrity they might, it was impossible to avoid inCurri g conr-derable obloquy and giving great offence. (Hear, hear.) Tbey were the advocates of no particular interests, save the iLterests of the public; they were bound to see that allprocecdings were conducted equitably as between the pubio sLd tbefe great interests to whom the lives of the public vere in some measnre entrusted; they had to take care, when fatal casualties occurred, that the guilty should not escape, and that negligence or inipropriety of conduct on the part of shipowrners, railway directors, and others should not go unpunished or be glozed over by friends whose syumpathies were excited by local connexions or by a community of interes,t. (Hear, hear.) It was this view of their duty which explained all the proceedings of the Board of Trade in relation to theLiverpool Local Marine Board. In 1854 Parliament gave to the Board of Trade the option ofappointing two courts for inquiry into wcksoLe, the Marine Board, composed of local shipowners on the spDot; and the other consisting of two magistrates, to whom~, in the eveut of matters of nautical sldll being involved, the Board of Trade might add an assessor. En 1854, ns now, the hon. member for Liverpool objected to the g toption, and contended that inquiries into bv referred to *the Local Marine Board only. but Parliameat gave the Board of Trade the option, and thl Board had exercised it; and he thought that it was rather teoo bad to complain now that they merely exercised a power upon them by Parliament so recently as 1854. (Hear hear. lt was not because a man belonged to a parncular interest I that he was therefore the best judge when a question a between that interest and the public. It was said tt paer and a lawyer were unfit to preside over the trade of the country. His noble friend Lord Stanley and himself did not pretend to any such position. Where there was a conflict between a great interest and the public they saw that justice was done not only to that interest, but also to the public; and where there was a probabity of matters being hushed up from local causes, they would not dopt a course leading to that result when PVarliament affordedI the means of investigation. (Hear.) That was the head and frout of their offending with regard to the Liverpool Marine Board. TheY heard of great theoretical complaints of the Board of Trade; but was it not strange that after exercising jurisdiction so long not a singl case of injustice was brought forward? He would not discuss the abstract theory, which the House, after hearing Mr. Cardwell and the hon. member for Liverpool, settled in 1854; bu' he was readyto admit that if gross injus. tice had been done by condemning innocent men, a case would be made out, not for a reconstitution of the Board of Trade, but for a revision of the clauess of the statute which intrusted them with those powers. The number of certificates withdrawn, either temporarily or permanently, from officers of the mercantile marine was 195. The number renewred by certificates of the same or an inferior grade was 58. Was it not strange that none of the 195 had lodged with the hon. member-no unwilling receiver-any complaint against the Board of Trade? He challenged the hon. member to bring forward any case in which injustice had been done. He did not say that they might not have erred in judgment, like others, but anything like gross miscarriage of justice could not be alleged. (Ifear.) The number of certificates withdrawn for drunkenness was no less than 116. For loss and damage to ships the number was only 20. The number for other offences was 59. The number of cases tried by the Liverpool Marine Board, who complained of being excluded from jurisdiction, was 96. The number tried by naval courts of law, against whichtherewas no complaint, was 57. The numbtrdisposed of bymagistrates,aassessors, and otherswas48. The numberof Dertificates withdrawn was 71. The number of certificates of ervime withdrawn was 124. Those were the statistics, and he thought they -were enough to show the House that if there were any substantial grievance ample opportunity had been oven to prove by one out of so many cas that the Board of 1frade had done wrong. (Hear.) The next charge was, that whereas the 448th section of the Act gave the Board power to ask any necessary questions when a wreck took place, they had presumed to ask whether the vessel waa insured, when it was insured, and for what amount ? The report of the committee of 1837 which sat upon the subject of wrecks enumerated the causes, and one of the most pro. minent was maritime insarance. Who did not know that maritime insurance engendered at least calessness in the owners as to the manner in which ships were sent to sea ? and it very often happened that they were purposely cast on shore when insured above their value. The Board of Trade were to inquire into wrecks, but they were not to ask whether there was a motive for allowing the ship to be cast away or for making every effort to prevent her being cast away. He said they would have been blameable If they had not asked the very questions for which the hon. member censured them, and he might add that those questions were ceompiled from the report of the receivers of wrecks, which was superseded by the Mercantile Marine Act, so that it was not the invention of the Board of Trade, but the practice before thosepowers were intrusted to them. (Hear, hear.) The next was rather a more delicate question -that during last session the Liverpool Marine Board were so galled at the treatment of the Board of Trade that they reigned in a body. He never got at the rights of that quarrel, but he believed they wanted to raise the salary of en official 50t. a-year, in consideration of increased duties, and the Board of Trade consented as a matter of favour, but the Liverpcol board claimed it as a matter of right, and sooner than yield the point that it was a matter of favour end not of right, resigned like an independent and offended body. (Laughter.) The hon. gentleman had wisely said he wotld not aflude to the Livorpool town dues, but it was worthy of notice that the remarkable touchiness of the Liverpool Marine Board happened, casually, of course, to be contemporaneous with a considerable stir beingrmade obout the Liverpool town dues. (Hear, hear.) The hon. tentleman censured the Board of Trade for reporting upon private Bills. They did that in obedience to the orders of the House, and if any censure were paseed it should be passed upon the Hlouse of Commons, and not upon 'hose who complied with its ordes It was, however, absolutely necessary that in matters between pnvate individuals there should be some one to speak for the public. (Hear.) No one who had not looked Into the subject could conceive the extent to which, for want of an intervening rower, the public interest had been prejudiced. He would point out en Instance. The corporation of London had the power of taxing seaborne coal, but not landborne coal, When railways were bein, introduced the corporation opposed every Bil 2for a raUway with a terminus in London, and withdrew its opposition upon each company submitting to pay the same duty on coal brought by their line as was payable on seaborne coal. Thus one by one the railway sompanies fell into the same net, and by a series of private acts of Parliament, of which the public knew nothing, the public interests were sacrificed. It was to prevent the recurrence of such proceedings that the Board of Trade preeented report on private Bills, and those on whose toes they trod resented it, and visited the Board with their censure. (Hear.) The next sin charged against them was that of obstructing Liverpool in forming docks, and putting the com. merce of the country to inconvenience. It was a very heavy charge,butitwasperfectlydemonArablebyact ofParhament and reports of committees that it was utterly unfounded. His right hon. friend (Mr. Labouchere) was chairman of the committee on the Liverpool and Birkenhead docks in 1855. For 12 yehs previously Liverpool had engaged in a confnict, vith all the energy, intelligence, and resources at its command, to prevent docks being made at Birkenhead. That long contest came under the Jurisdiction of the committee of 1855, and in granting certain advantages to Liverpool the committee stipulated that in the next session Liverpool should come to Parliament for a reconstitution of its dock trust. They had made default in doing so, and they were indefaultatthisimoment. TheBoardof Trade hadpointedout year after year, when those personscame to Parliament, that they had not complied with conditions upon which former powers had been conceded, and if by doing that they were obstructig the Liverpool dock trust, he hoped the Board of Trade would never cease to obstruct them until they had learnt to obey Acts of Parliament. (Rear, hear.) Then he came to the question of the guano, and upon tha'; the hon. gentleman the member for a great commercial city, whioh flourished so much by its trade and commerce, had read a letter from the chairman of the committee of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, who accused the Board of Trade of permitting the Government of Peru to charge so large a sum for its guano. He (Mr. Lowe) submitted that it would have been much more to the purpose if the hon. member for Liverpool had showed how the Board of Trade were to coerce the Government of Peru in a matter like fhat. He came next to the question relating to the imEortation of guano from the Kooria Mooria Islands. The hon. member for Liverpool stated that the Board of Trade refused to comply with the request of the Liverpool Shipowners' Association to relinquish the royalty of 2s. a-ton on guano imported from those islands into the united kingdoni on the ground that no duty was payable on Peruvian guano. It was considered unworthy of the Board of Trade tbat they did not consent to that proposition. But the ground on which the Board declined to do so was, that the remission of that 2s. a ton would not in the slghtest degree bave benefitted the agriculturists, but, on the contrary, would merely have gone into the pockets of gentlemen who had already got a monopoly of the article in question. Again, the hon. gentleman had accused the Board of Trade of very great misconduct with regard to the inspection cf13e (Nr. Lowe) could only speak of the short time that he had known the Board of Trade, and he could conscientiously state that the board had taken the utmaost precaution to secure the services of gentlemen in every way competent to perform the duties of inspectors, and that at the head of that department was Captain Galton, a gentleman whose very admirable report on Americanrailways showed hias complete mastery over the subject of railway inspection. The case of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincobnshire Railway had been cited as one against which an officer of the Board of Trade had reported, who, it was contended, was unequal to the functions he had to discharge. if the Board of Trde had erred in acting at report they had erred Olt the rig t sie7e, and tprobablth,y were actuated in 'What wJy s nyseraro eiuscneuncst-h I ublic, such, for instance, as happened the other day fro t the dreadful railway accident in Canada. But it so hI! *pened that the officer who inspected that line of railway was not appointed by the Board of Trade at all, but by the Railway Commis4ion. which was afterwards pt an nd to and its powers transferred to the Board of Tad (e,a hear.) Then the hon. gentleman (Mr. Horsfall) adverted to the case of the Norfolk Railway, and read a report from a gentleman who had a very bad opinion indeed of the Board of Trade. He (Mr. Lowe) asked the date of that report at the time the hon. gentleman was reading it, and for this rerson. The House might perhaps remember that some time ago the Board of Trade caused a strict inspection to b made of the Eastern Counties Railway. No doubt that did nct suit the feelings of the Norfolk Company, and he tboughtthe House might fairly trace the bad opinion thathad been expressed of the system of inspection pursued by the Board of Trade to the eDgineer of that company. He (fr. Lowe) believed he had now gone through all the charmes which had been brought against the department with which he was connected. The hon. gentleman bad disclaimed all prsonal feeings in bringing this subject before the House. He did not accuse the hon. member of being actuated by such motives; but if he had not been personal on this oceasion, he had been, at all events,, extremely local. (Laugbter.) He (Mr. Lowe) would not attempt to weaken what had been so well said by others in the course of this discussion; but this he would say, that if there were any department of the Government that deeerved well of the country, it was the Board of Trade. (laughter.) This, at all events, he was entitled to say, for almost every one of the exploits alluded to by the hon. member for Liverpool had been performed long before he (Mr. Lowe)had anythingtodowithit. He shouldnowatate in a cncise way the benefits for which the community was indebted to the Board of Trade. From that department, in the first place. bad emanated the repeal of the navigation laws. (Hear, hear.) It had also adopted a system of registration of ships, the effect of which had been to put the title to every vessel in the kingdom on the simplest, cleat, and most intelligible basis; and he cordialil' c4rncurr9wihwa hadfoe on that subject from the right hon. gentleman the member for Carlisle, when he said ho hoped in that at was contained the germ and the nucleus of what would eventually become e md of transfer wth ect to ll the landed property th- ubout tbe orttr 0lr 1hear.) The Bgoard of Trsde had alo been insrumentalin settliez the question of he measurement of tonnage in the most satOfaibory mannler. It bad introduced an examination of masters andmateli with the gretast succe. It had likewise established the agency of shinping offices, the object of which was to nianage the aflairs of the sailor in a perfectly trustworthy irtamner,andonethat was exceedinglyadvantageoustohisown ibterest,% It had alBo introduced a system of money-orders, by which the sailor on receiving hia money, instead of yield. ing to temptation aud squandering it away on shore, was enabled to transtait as rnuch as he liked of it to his wife and family at home. In that wayin th6 last nine months of 1855 no Iss a eum In the aggregate than 77,000. had been remitted by seamen to their families and relatives (hear, hear); and in 1856 the whole amount so remitted was so large as 140,0001. (Hear, hear.) B e was sure thAt was a statement which would be received with the greatest satisfaction by the House. Again, the Board of Trado had established savings-banks with the view of assisting seafaring men to save their money. Those banks, however, had been as yet so short atime in operation that ho could not give any very decided opinion upon their ultimate results; but so far as theplan had been tried it appeared to workvwell. The board bad also taken charge of thewages andeffects of deceased seamen, formerlycollectedby the htercantile Marine Fond, which afforded no very trust. worthy security-with the view to distributethem eqitbli among their next of kin; and in thtwa h l .r co lected in 1856 33,000.4, an distributed it without any expense whatever to the parties. It had also issued, at great pis and labour, elaborate lnstructons to conums to be followaed in all matters of difficulty relating to shigping, and which it was hoped would be of very considerable value. The board had likewise introduced a clause into the Mercantile Marine Act which altered the doctrine of salvage. Savage was formerly paid, as the House was aware, only for the saving o°f goods boat by the clause in question it had been extended to the saving of human life. (Hear, hear.) The number of lives lost by shipwreck of vessels belonging to the united kingdom was in 1852, 922; in 1853, 689; in 1854, 1,549; in 1855 (when the change in the doctrine of salvage took place), 469; and in 1856, 521. He thought that considering the great increase in our shipping, these results must be very gratifying to the House, and that his right hon. friend lr. Cardwell, who had been instrumental in bringing them about, was enUtled tothe gratitude of every humane man. (Hear, hear.) Again, great improvements had taken ulace in lifeboxie -2 round the coast. Then the Board of Trade had received rrom the Trinity-house the management of the lighthouses, md on that subject the board hnad remitted duties to the amount of 170,0004., and had built 22 new light. houses, while 24 others were now under consideration. Be believed that he need not trouble the House any fur. ther. Of cou-so the Board of Trade was liable to make mistakes, but no establishment was better seconded by its ubordinate officers than that board, and every one conver. ant with business knew what an important matter that was. (Hear.) The hon. member for WestNorfolk declared that the hon. member for Liverpool had made out his case, but it was very strange that the hon. member, coming here to make a formal attack on the Board of Trade, should not have based it on any great priniple, but on single instances of misconduct, crefy ced out, every one of which he [Mr. Lowe), unless he were greatly mistaken, had succeeded m answering. Upon the whole he submitted, unless he should be proved to be wrong in his sttement, that he had entirely anawered the hon. member- but if he bad not, that might be a reason for withdraWng confidence rrom those who had the management of the Board .f 1'rade, but it was no reason for breaking up the constitution Df the board itself, by the means of which the country had btained such enormous benefits, and entrusting its business bo the care of any body of gentlemen, however respectable, who would be the representatives of particular interests. The effect of such an arrangement would be that which was always the effect of guilds, that they would look at matters from the point of view of bhieir own particular trade. Though the interest of each particular trade was involved in the general interest, yet the guild never sawv that, but tried to get something in. ionopatible with the general interest, and formed a narrow Dligarchy withinL the trade, until at last, by the combined ipposition of the trade and the nublic, the guild was overJhrown and the true principles of commerce rendered iriumphant. (Hear, hear.) The Board of Trade had faUen Into no such fault. Its fault was that it had not con. Diliated particular interests at the expense of the public, iut had endeavoured, by doing its duty manfaRy, to carry out properly the functions entrusted to it by Parliament, DeiDg quite convilnced that under such circumstance it would receive the support of the House. (Hear, hear.) Mir. BASS raid, it would a ppear from the speech of te right hon. gentleman that nearly every benefit he country could boast of was to be traced to ;he Board of Trade, and he was only surprised that the Light hon. gentleman had not, among other things, claimed -or the Board of Trade the credit of abolishing the com aws. The right hon. gentleman, after highly praising the Board of Trade for its statistics, deprecated any attempt to ;Ive the count the benefit of agricultural statistics. Now, t appeared tohim that nothing eould be of greater advan. ,age to the country than satisfactory statistics with respect so the Breat Pgricultural interest, and he was satisfied that bhey might eesily be obtained, for he did not believe that the farmers womld hesitate to give information for the nur,cose. It wFould be for the hon. member for liverpool to cCde whether, after the discusion which had taken place, it would be advisable to press the motion to a division, but Se for one thanked the hon. member for bringing forwvard the subject. Mr. J. EWART aid, it happened that the Board of 'rade sometimes proposed vexatious rales and restrictions, We agreed with the right hon. gentleman the Secretary for the Colonles that no person engaged in trade ought to be on the Board of Trade, but he submitted that it might be better to have on the Board some one intimately acquainted with the practice and rules of trade. (Hear.) Whether the House divided or not the debate would be attended with advantage. Mr. HADFIELD said, there was a quarrel between every manufacturing town in the north of England and Liverpool, which levied a tax of 150,00t. aeyear on the manufacturing interest for raintaining its own police, for lighting, and for building halls. (Hear, hear.) That quarrel must be settled; and instead of at this time making changes in the Board of Trade, he would allow that board to exercise its power and influence in settling that great question. Mr. HOESFALT, in reply, denied, in reference to an observation which had fallen from the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle, that he had made any attack on Mr. Huskdsson. He had been a strenuoas supporter both of Mr. Huskisson and Mr. Canning, and he wished it could be said that the right hon. baronet bad been as consistent a supporter o' those great men. Sir J. GR&HAM said he had supported them unirormly. Mr. HORSPALL sid that his impression was that tho right hon. baronet, who had represented so many places and held so many oplnions in this House, had been both a supporter and opponent of their policy (a laugh); but of course, after the assurance of the right hon. baronet, he mnst be mistaken on that point. He thanked the Vice-President of the Board of Trade for the good humour with which he had replied to his observations, but he was incorrect in saying that he (Mr. Horsfall) had sneered at the noble lord the President of the Board. He had particularly gnarded himself against such a charge, by observing that he should refer to that noble lord, as well as to the right hon. gentleman himself, with the utmost respect. The right hon. gentleman said that no case of injustice had been brought forward. He would, however, bring forward many if the committee were granted, though he did not choose to take up the time of the House by detailing every case at the preeent moment. The captains of merchant ships conceived that they were not tried by a proper tribunal;andho thought the Go. verinnent and the Board of Trade ought to endeavour to remove that feeling. He regretted that when a question was put to the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Lowe) on this subject the other evening he said he was noS. aware that any intention existed on the part of the Government of proposing the amendment of the Mercantile Marine Act. It would have been much mole satisfactory had the right hon. gentleman stated that if a substantial case of injustice could be established the Government would give the subject careful consideration, with a view to the amendment of the law. With reference to the guano traiEc, the right hon. gentleman assumed that because the le6sees resided at Liverpool the shipowners at that port were endeavouring to monopolize the trade. That argument was most absurd. It was true that the lessees, to whom a mono. poly had been improperly granted, were a IAverpool firm, but there was no desire on the part of the Liverpool ship. owners to exclude from the trade vessels sailing from London or any other port. He (Mr. Horafall) had been accused by the right hon. gentleman of makisig this a Liverpool question. It wrould doubtless have been considered somewhat extraordanotif hehadenteredintothecomplaint which were madeat Southampton and otherseaporteof the kingdom, and he hadthought the proper course was to confine himosolf to circumstan,ces which had come under his own obsorvation. This was not a local question; it was a national question; andt whatever the decision of the House might be that night the matter could not rest as it was. The right hon. gentleman had spoken with some degree of contempt of the local marine beard of Liverpool, and had intimated that that "guild" was not a fitting tribunal to decide upon the cases to which reference had been made; but the right hon. gentleman's objection seemed somewbat disrespectful to his colleague the Secretary for the Colonies (Mr. Labh uchere), by whom the board had been established. He (Mr. Horsfall) thought no answer had been given to the case he had subaitted to the House. It was true they had heard from the right hon. baronet (Sir J. Graham) a long argument in favour of free trade, which might have been very appropriate 10 years ago, but which had little bearing upon the present question. The right hon. baronet claimed for tho members of the present Board of Trade the credit of the measures which had been proposed by Mr. Huskisson, MIr. Cardwell, and others of their predecessors in office. Why, with just as much propriety, he (Mr. Horafall) might, as the successor of Mr. Huskissounin the representation of Liverpool, claim credit ferzthe measures of that right hon. gentleman. It had been assumed that he wished to place the Board of Trade under the control of a man of business engaged in commerce. S :ch an idea never entered his mind, but he certainly was of opinion that a gentleman of some commercial experience should be connected with that board, and he hoped the Bouse would support him in asldng for a committee on tbe subject. The question was then put, and the S9D4x.E: declared his opinion that "the Noes had it." The galleries below the bar were cleared, but the motion was negatived without a division. CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSE1. Mr. SLANEY, in moving for the appointment of a standing committee or unpaid commission to consider and report on practical suggestions for improving the social condition of the working classes, expressed his opinion that such a measure was rendered necessary by the great changes which had recently taken place in the position of the I I I I I I I humbleo clae In this ldngdom. The &bate which had Just occu±red had shown what au imme increzme there had been of late years in the commerce, the manufacture, and the tode of tho country; and surely it WAS most desirable that meaues ahould be adopted for promoting the welfare of those humbler individuals who, by their activity, industry, andenterpnse hadcontributed to the nationalpro. sperity. Hefoundtatwithinthelstbalfasentmaytheincrem of population hd been at the rate of 15 per cent. every 10 years. The Increase had been three times as great in the large towns as in the rural districts, and the consequence of this was that in the former the working classes were confinod vwithin the narrowest limits, and lived in close courts and other places which were most injurious to health. This overcrowding of our large towns had eslted from three principal cause.-thegreat subdivion of labour the appllcation of the moving power of steam to all great aanufactures, and the development of the railway system, which last, while it brought poor people into the towns, had aken out theirnatural guardians and protectors-the middle and upper classes. e did not or " to name the members of the committee or board forwhich he asked. He trusted that the right hon. baronet the Home Secretary or the noble Icrd at the head of the Government would undertake that task - but he would suggest that it should consist of some mem 'ersof that and perhaps of the otber House of Parliament, and of some persons interested in matters which would promote the welfare of the labouring classes It would only need a secretary or clerk, whick would not cauee much expense, and he had no doubt that volunteers would always be found willing to act upon the committee. Its objects should be to remove legal difficultie, and to sug. eest hght, but necessary changes of the law; to assist and facilitate voluntary efforts made by benevolent persons, and to enforce neglected duties, such as preserving footpaths, open places, and spaces to which the working classes might resort for freh air and exercise. A Board of Agriculture had been established for the benefit of the landed interest, and a Board of Trade for the advautage of the shipping and commercial interest, and all he asL-ed now was that a board might be established, wich would cost nothing, for the benefit of the working classes. The hon. gentlem a concluded by moving for the appoint. ment of a standing committee, or unpaid commission, to consider and report from time to time on practical suggestions, free from party differences, to give facilities for improvement in the social condition of the working clames. Sir G. GREY said that his hon. friend had alluded but slightly to his own exertions in former Parliameats on behalf of the working clases, and he wished to bear testimony to the efforts of his hon. friend to promote the welfare of the working classes, but at the same time he was bound to consider what would be the practical effect of the plan now rroposed. A similar proposal had been made on a prevfous occasion which he had opposed, and the objections which he then entertained had not been removed He did not think that if the'proposal were carned into effect it would lead to any good practical result nor did he consider that it would be advantageous to the object which he had in view. His hon. friend had alludd to various measures, such as the Factory Acts and Lodginghouse Act, and had expressed an opinion thatthose Acts had been retarded by the want of such a board as he proposed. Now, for his own part, he considerei that it was much more desirable that Acts of that nature should be considered separatelyby a committee of that House thanby a standing committee. During the present session a committee had been appointed on the motion of the hon. member for Youghal to consider the propriety of extending the provisions of the Factory Act to bleaching and dyeing estabDihments, and he believed that the persons interested in that measure would much prefer the subject being investigated by a committee of that House then by a standing committee or commission, as proposed by his hon. friend. The FactoryAct andtheL gndmg-honse Act aforded an instance that a board such as that now proposed was not necessary to induce the House to legislate upon such subjects, and he believed that it would be better to adhere to the practice which had hitherto existed of hon. members bringing under the notice of the House those matters of thiB nature in which they took an interest and moving that they be referred to a committee of the House. He was afraid, also that the proo of his hon. friend would give rise to expectations which might not be realized, and would thus roduce a grat amount of disappointm entx Eperience own at the system which had hitherto prevailed had been conducive to the interests of the working classes, and he hoped, therefore, that his learned friend would not press his motion. Mr. SLANEY said that after what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman he should not proceed with his mnotion., The motion was then withdrawn. THE LICENSING SYSTEML Mr. ATHERTON then moved that the House do resolve itself into committee to take into consideration the Act relating to the licensing of houses for the sae of beer and sphitous hquors. The motion was then agreed to, and the Houso having resolved itself into committee, Mr. ATHERTON rose to move for leave to introduce a Bil relating to the subject. The Bill, he said, which he asked for leave to introduce, was a declaratory BiE to define what the ptesent law reaLly was. The system of lioensing was regulated by the 9th of George IV., cap. 61, the prnciple of which was that the power of granting licenses should be placed in the bands of local justices of the peace. lNow, the object of the Bil which he asked for leave to in. trcduce was to remove all doubt as to the law, and so to frame it, that in boroughs in England, having a separate coimission of the peace, but not a separate court of quarter sessions, the borough justices should be licensing justices, To show how important was the subject,he might state that there were no less than 77 boroughs in England which answered to that description, and which were represented in that House by 90 members Practically speaking, in 71 out of those 77 boroughs it had been assumed that the law actually was that which he now sought to make It, inasmuch as the borough justices had within those boroughs exercised a licensing authority. It had of late, however, been suggested that it might possibly be so determined in the courts of law, upon a strict construction of the Act of George IV, that the county justices were the licensing justices within the boroughs in question, and that the borough justices had no jurisdiction of that nature within them. Now, that was a state of things which would be clearly at variance with the spirit of the Act, inasmuch as the House must be well aware that the borough justices, as being the magis trates who sat un the bench in those towns from day to day, and who hX laid before them all complaints preferred against the proprietors of publichouses, were, as a consequence, the fittest tribunal to decide whether a license should or should not in a particular case be granted. Great inconvenienoe resulted from the present system, and not the least was that which had been dEscribed by Lord Kenyon as " the indecorum of a race for jurisdiction" as prevailing between the county and borough magistrates inparticular cases The subject was one with respect to which he had receivedvarious communications from towns in the north of England; it was one of con. siderable importance, and he therefore trusted the House would accede to the motion that the Chairman be directed to move for leave to bring in a Bill to explain and amend the §Act to regulate the granting of licenses to keepers of inns, alehouses and victualling houses in England. Sir G. GREY said, he should offer no objection to the introduction of the Bill, but he at the same time felt bound to say that he had received no representations to the effect that the result of the existing system was-as the hon. and learned member had stated-a race for jurisdiction between the county and borough magistrates Be had not been aware, until he had heard the observations of the hon. and learned gentleman, that any doubt existed as to the jurisdiction which ought to be exercised in the instances to which reference had been made. When the Bill was before the House, however, they would be in a position to form a better judgment upon the question. The Housethen resumed, and leave was given to introduce the Bil, which was read a first time. BURIAI,. Mr. HARDDOASTLE obtained leave to bring in a Bill relatin to burials in consecrated and unconsecrated ground PROPERTY OF MARRIED WOMEN. Mr. MALINS, in moving for leave to bring in a Bill to enahbe married women to dispose of reversionary interests in personal estate, took occasion to state that it was the same measure which had passed through the House of Commons in the wears 1S54 and 1856 but wbich had failed to pass through the otber House of Parliament, owing to the circumstance that he had not been able to induce any noble lcid in that House to move the second reading. He had, however, been more fortunate this session, and he had every reason to hope that, under the auspices of the noble lord vho had undertaken to move the second reading, the mfcasure would be successful. It was a bill which related to the reversionaryinterest of married women in real estate. Its object was to give married womnen the right to dispose of personal property in reversion in the same manner and with the same ceremonies as they had now the right to dispose of real property. The Bill was not opposed by the Governmentindeed, his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-Genera had informed him that, if it did not pass this session, he should himself embody its principle in a Government measure, and introduce it on a future occasion. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL tboucht that the public at laTge would be greatly indebted to hb hon. and learned friend if he succeeded in pasing this BiU into law, for it would remove a great anomaly, which was not, in truth, a Isgitimate deduction from the law of England, but which had grown up out of a decision now too old and too frequently followed to be reversed by anything but Parlia- enetary interference. The result of this anomaly was that a married woman might be the owner of the reversion of 4Q,000l. or 50, OOOf, contingent on her outliving her husband, cnd yet not be able to raise a shilling for her immediate me. Leave was then given to bring in the Bil, which was subsequently read a first time. MR BERTOLACCL Mr. CONINTGHAM, in moving for a select committee to inquire into the statements contained in the petition of Mir. Francis9Robert Bertolacci, praying foran inquiry into the proceedings of certain functionaries of the Dchy of Lancaster in preventing him from esercisiog the rights powers, and privileges of the office of auditor of the Duchy, and in superseding him by a near connexion of the ReceiverGeneral to audit that officer's accounts, such committee to CrDaist of five members, to be appointed by the General Committee of Elections, said that as the Government did not mean to oppose the motion, he should content himself with stating tbat he brought forward this question entirely on publiec grounds and in the interest of public justice. All that he sought was a full, searching, and public investigation into the statements of Mr. Bertolecci, and he had such faith in that gentleman's truth and integrity that he felt asbured he would pass honourably through that ordeal. Lord CAVEN'DISH Eeconded the motion. He said he was nearly related to one of the individuals whose conduct had been impugned by Mr. Bertolacci. The public wmere much indebted to the hon. men ber for bringiDg forwvar the facts of this petition, and no one was more grateful to him than the relative to whom he had refersed (Earl Granville). The individuals whose conduct had been impugned were lord Granville, theDukeof Newcastle the Earlof Iarrowby, aknd one or two others, Had he been preseut on A former maotion vith regard to church.rates -which stands on the paper in my name. Sir J. PAXINGTON~.The noble lord saysait is his intenl. tion to introduco a BiU " beforOe long." I wish to know whether he means by those words dluing the present ses. sion ?

I Meant, of core,ti Governmenl intend to introduce the Bui during the present session. Sir 3. TRELAWN vtY said that, after the noble lord's last answer, he should withdraw his motioni. Lorda CECIVOT'IIG PAPER. d. CECIL rose, pursuant to notice, to move for a select committee to inquire into this subject. Ia doing so the noble lord took occasion to disclaim any intention or seekmng to deal with the subject of the balot, which he said would not be affected in one way or the other by the suecess of his motion. He might also state, seeing that a hon. gentleman opposite had given notice of his intention to move the previous question, that in asking the House to assent to his proposal he was not caUing upon it to legislate, but simply to inquire, and that therefore the argument that aU questions relating to the elective franchisa should be postponed until the whole subject came under consideration next year was one which could not justly be urged in opposition to the course which he was about to ask the House to take. He believed the asdoption of the system of voting papers would remedy many of the defects in the present condition of the electoral franchise of which reformers complained. Those who were the advocates of reform were opposed to the present state of things, because they did not think the franchise was sufficiently extended; but, while holding these sentiments, they did not seem to be quite alive to the circanstancethatinthe case evenof thosewhopossessedthefrauchise theprivilege which itconferredwas exercised by a compara. tively sm number out of the whole body of electors. To show, however, that such was the fact, he might state that at the general election which had taken place in 1847 there had been contests in 13 counties or divisions of coanties, in which the number of registered electors had amounted to 90,400;,the number who had not voted being 24,136, or about27 in every lOOpersons. There werenoreturnson which reliance could be placed in connexion with the general election of 1852; but it appeared from a high Liberal authority -the Edinburgh Beview-that 55 out of every 100 electors in large constituencies had, in that year, abstained from voting.i The reason why the franchise had been exercised in so small a number of cases in the counties was to be accounted for by the distance which the voters had to go, by the expense which travelling entailed, and by the circumstance that many persons ixi the country districts were so much engage as not to be able to spare time to attend at the elections. In support of the last mentioned reason he might observe, that in Middlesex, where the polling places were more numerous than in the other counties, there were 43 out of every 100 electors who had not voted; and that while the total number of electors had amounted to 13,781, 5,950 had abstained from exercising the franchise. The present system, then, was evidently extremely imperfect in its operation, but in his opinTon the Bill of the noble lord opposite (Lord R. Grosvenor), which had for its object the rendering the payment of travelling expenses penal, would, if passed into a law, afford a stil stronger reason than any which he (Lord R. Cecil) had advanced for the adoption of some such measure as he proposed. The question was one which must be settled in some way or the other. It had never yet been satisfactorily settled. The courts of law had given con'ficting decisions on the subject, and it was matter of doubt in what hght committees of the House of Commons would regard the payment of the expenses of voters. The question, however, must be solved in one way or another, and the BiUl proposed by the noble lord the member for Middlesex was so open to objection, and would disfranchize so large a number of voters, that he did not believe it would beadoptedby Parliament. (Rear, hear.) There was no other way of dealing with the question satisfactorily,except by talkng away the necessity of going to the pol at all, which could only be done by means of voting papers. An additional recommendation in favour of the plan he proposed wasin the diminution of the present expense of county as compared with borough electione. These ex. nses frequently amounted to 4,G001., 5,0001. or 6 0001. ey migat not always appear in the aalitor's accounts, or in any publio document, but they formed a heavy penalty, which prevented many men from going to Parliament- and many valuable and deserving members were compeled to retire from the representation of counties because they were not able to meet the heavy expenses of a contested election. Another blemish was one which the House had made many futile attemptts to remove. Most of the petitions against the retumn of members relied upon treating. Bdbery, although not aholished, was much diminished. The great offence was tres.tipg, and the system of voting papers would absolately put an end to this abuse. Trating usually took place w en voters were brought up to the poUl; and when persons had put off their affairs and had come a distance to vote, they very naturally expecoed some refreshment, and candids±es and their friends had some difficulty In refusing their requests. Voting papers would also put an end to the inconvenience of collecting together large assemblies of persons in times of great poltical excitement, and would relieve us from the scandal of those occasional outbreaks of riotous and disorderly conduct which were a disgrace to our political estem. Fozeigners remarked with astonishment the disgraceful sataznalia that characterized an English election, and the system of voting papers would put a stop to the scenes of personal vndlence which sometimes occurred. One of the most oommon forms of bribery would be put an end to by voting papers. It was a species of bribery more common perhaps In towns than in counties, and depended upon the state of the poll as it wVent on being fmunished to the respective candidates. When the numbens ran close at a critical poriod of the day candidates or their friends were sometimes tempted to bribe in the heat of the moment, and the result was an election petition. This temptation would be entirely put astop to by a system of votingpapers. These being the advantages of the plan he proposed, it seemed hard to find any objections to its adoption. But it was said that the plan had been tried and failed in the elections of guardians for Poor Aw disticts. It was alleged thatthe systemhad been productive of Ifraud and forgery in Poor Law elections, and that it was therefore unfit for Parliamentary contests. Now, he denied that as a general rule the system had failed in Poor Law elections, and he reled upon the authoritative report which the Poor Law Commissioners had given of the working of the system. Inthe first report of the commissioners, which was signed, among others, by the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, they stated the reasons which led to the adoption of the system in Poor Law voting:- "In the largest parishes, with the most numerous constituents, and with the greatest facilities hitherto offered to the ratepayers to exercise a general control over the management, we usually find that the greatest number of voters by whom any election is determined constitute only anminority, and usually a small minority, of the whole body of zatepayers; and in the raral parishes, where the population is widely scattered, we frequently found the manage. ment in the hands of a very small knot of individual., whose residencew enabled them to attend without inconvenience the place for the tranSaction of parochial business. The larger ratepayers and the persons most deeply interestedthose engaged in trade or otherwise occupied-could not abandon their occupations to attend to theirinterests in parochial management without greater prejudice to their more immediate interestsin the pasit of their ordinary occupations."thpusiofterrdny They added:- "As the progress of the votes is unknown, so are the motives to use undue means to affect the result diminished, and the voter is proportionately shielded from the use of those means." Again,- "At St. Martin's-in-thefields thereaused to be only, at the utmost, 750 voters out of 1,500 ratepayers. At the first voting paper election out of 1,619 1,522 voted, or not quite Did the experienoe of subsequent years falsify the expectations of the corninisioner^r The only other allusion to the system which he had beenabletofind in the reports of the Poor ,aw Commissioners was iatheir report for 1839, where "Btbe votngppernwhich the elector isto record his vote ini wthnwiigbeing left oneortwAo cle r days at hts residence he is enabled to give his vote in the most free and deberate manner, undisturbed by the importunities of canvassers, or the ttmult and clamour of the pollingbooth . . . Hitherto this mode of election hasgiven general satisAfaction. Jforeover, it h_s continued to be marked by greater numbers of votes being given than have been obtained for like objects under any other form of election, In the greater number of instances of oontested ctions the number of votes polled have been more than There was a later tesimony in favour of the system in a paper laid upon the table two years ago by the noble lord the rnember for Marylebone, from which it would appear that the plan had worked well, and that in the few cases in which it had failed the failara cuald be traced to the wretch~e-d -mac-hi-nerv -e-m- loyed, and the under-payment of collectors. Where, Eowever, the police or other parties, over whom some check existed, were appointed to collect the papers, the results were most satisfactory. He should be told that the system had failed in Leeds. In 1852 there was a contested election there, and great frauds were practised; but on referring to the papers Laid before Parliament at the time it would be found that all the frauds turned upon the misconduct of the clerk who had the collection of the papers. The voting papers were returned to the clerk of the board of guardians over whom no groat check existed, and he selected a number of broken and disreputable men for collectors, by whom numbers of votes were tampered with in their pa. sage. He did not think that the misconduct of a single official ought to be received as conclusive evidence against the workg of the system. It might be an argument against legislation, but neither this incdent nor any bypothetical suggestion of fraud could be an arg. ment against inquiry. It would be for a committee to consider whether any such liabilities to fraud might not be remedied by the machinery employed. it was said that if voting apers for members of Parliament were adopted, there wo e great difficulty in preventing votes from being hustled in their own houses, and that the independence of the voter would be interfered with. (Hear, bear.) That might be an objection which could be very fairly brought before the committee, but which was not an objection against examination and inqury. Two years ago a ill was brought in by his hon; and learned friend Sir R. Kelly which proposed to introduoe a] system of voting papers, by which voters would sign their voting PDrsiu the presence of ajustice of the peace or other personf offiiarre. spechbity, voshouldforwardthemtoWhereturning offloer. Such a sstem as that would be an antidote to the danger of any exercise of undue infloence over the voter. But he was not concerned to bring forward any system in detail, All, he a6ked for was inquiry, an inquiry into a subject never before investigated by that House. Mhsny persons whose opinions were worthy of attention believed that this plan might be fitly a pplied to Parliamentary elections, xnd lie thgofor6 trit.4 that hisa presant );oti wouild be tasncerants summnoned from various parts of the kingdom, Liverpool at that tine being too insignificant to require a represetuti4ve. Afer the deatbof Cromwell,duringtherelga' -Of Charles, II. in the year 1660, a reconstruction of the hoard leeok l-Ie it'haviD been divided into two departmentse no the Board of ?oreign Phftnttionl, and th other the XBoard for the Superintendience of Commerce, and thosetw, -deepartment-swerfe sain united in the yearl1672; butf fresh banges were made in its constitution in 1696,. and again, in 1699, the principle, however, upon which it was formed re~oiaining nearly the same until 1780, when. the hoard became3 extremnely unpopular. In that year Mr. Burkeintroduced a Bill which conitained amnong other provisions one for the -to,tal abolition of the board, which, after a very animated debate in a full House, was carried by a 3majority of eight, the numbers beinig 207 to 199. The observations of Mr. B3urke on that occasion were so pertinent to the question. then before the House that he hoped that he might be allowed to quote a few of them. Mr. Burke said,- I speck, Sir Of the Boardl of Trade and Plantations. ....I have known that board, off and on, ,for a great niumber of years. Both of its pretended objects have been miuch the objects of my study,-if 1 have a right to call any pursuiits of mine by so respectable a name. - I cnnl assure the House, and I hope they will not think that I risk my little credit lightly, that without meaning to convey the least reflection upon any one of its members, past or present, it is a hoard which, if not mischievous, is of no u-se at all. You, will be convinced, Sir, that I amn not mistaken if you reflect how generally it is true, that commerce, the principal object of that office, flourishes most -when it is left to itself. Interest, the great guide of commerce, is not a blind one. It is very well able to find its own way, and it,imecOesities are its best laws,.. . . In therin in,deed, of Charles L., the council or cmittees o oni -'wee neer amomet unccuied with the affairs of trade; but even where they had no M intention (which was sometimes the case), trade and manufacture antlered infinitely from their injudicious tamperings, But since that period, whenever regulation is wanting (for I do not deny that somne. tihnes it may he wvanting) Parliament constantly sits, and ParliaMent alone is competent to such regulation, We wanit no instruction from hoards of trade or from any other board;~ and God forbid we should give the least attention t~o their reports. Parliamentary inquiry is the only mode of -obtaining Tarliamentary information. There is more real knowledge to he obtained by attending the detail of business *4i the committees above stairs than ever did come or ever will come from any board in this kingdom, or from all of them together." Votwitlistanding the result of that division the mercantile classes were not desirous of seeing the total abolition of the board, although they were anxious for its reform, and that, be believed, was very mnuch the case at the present day, and he himself believed that in many cases the Board of `Trade bad been of great.service. (Hear, hear.) What was, -however, the presenit construction of the Board of Trade ? 'The Chancellor of the Exchequer had on a previous occasion stated that the honorary members of a heard need niot be taken into consideration, and he, accepting that definition loolked upon Lord Stanley ofAlderley and the right Lson. gentleman opposite as constituting the Board of Trade, aud would next proceed to inquire what duties they had to perform. Mr. Thomas, of the Record-office, had truly said that those duties were' of a very miscellaneous character. Part of the duties of that hoard was to advise the Colonial Secretary upon ques'-ticns affecting the commerce of the colonies. Anothier portion of those duties was to advise the Lords of the T'reasury upon 'measures affecting the Customs and Excise, and then again the beard had to comimunicate with the Foreign Secre4tary upon all commercial treaties. He should have imagined 'that tat would be almost sufficient, but the duties of the 'board did not end thiere, It had to supervise every Order ia Ceouncil, to report upon every local Bill, every dock Bill, and every railway BilL Then, again, it exercised a general superintendence over agriculture (corn), mnanufactures, commerce, navigation, ralwysitatistics, the departmenit Of science and art (Mariboruuhhuse~, the Mining Record. o-ffice, the czeological surve ofte United Kingdom, the MUuseuml of'Irish Industry, the registration of ecience and of design, joint stock coinpanies' registration, metropolitan suppy ofwatr, ad, aen therdutes whbich it biad to perfrm,thee wee Blls~,efre hatHouise, such as tho MedcalBil, te Idusria Scool Bil,and the Aggrixazted Assalts ill,whih wold afordsom occupation for it.

The manner in which the provisions of the Me.- chant Shipping Act of I8S4 had been carried out had cre.' *ated great dissatisfaction in every seaport in the kingdom. In the Bill of 18-50, called the Mercantile Marine Bill, the neat principle for which the people of this country'had 1ong contended-the right of local self-government in oppositioni to cenltralizatiosi-2-was recognized, and by that Bili local marine hoards wore givoin to the principal seaport,; of the kingdom. On those boards devolved the duty of inquiry in case of wrecks and casualties, or of misconduct of morchbant captains or officers at sea. He spoke from the expe. ri-lnee he had h-ad as a member of the local Marine Board of Liverpool wheni he said that no beards ever worked better 'than those local hoards constituted by the rigbt hon. gentlo. moian now the Secretaryfortbe Colonies. When Mr. Cardwdll introducoed his, Consolidated Shipping Bill, for which he oh. -tamned deserved credit, that right hon. gentleman made-and it would have been woniderful if he had not-some few snistakes. He (Mr. Honifall) in his p lace protested against scme of the provisionis of that Bill, which deprived the lovad mnarine boards of the power given them by the pro. eat kecretary for the Colonies. Hie then stated that depriving ,those local hoards of the powers they possessed, and con. 'bering them on magistrates, would inflict injury not easilyI :remedied. lie did not lay claim to gift of prophecy, bat theI fact was that Mr. Cardwell's Consolidated Shiping Billc "1854 had created a spirit of dissatisfaction in th m iercantile xnarine. By the Bill of 1850 the local board for trying 3masters of vessels was constituted of six shipowvners eleoteds -by shipowners, and four mnerchants or shipowners appointed by the Beardl of Trade. Thin local hoard had the advan. tageof he ega adiceof a stipendiary magistrate and of -th prsene f a exmier in seamanship, a merchant eapainof ret ailiy,recommended and approved by the Boar of rade It ad also the advantage of a scientific ~examiner in navigation, anid he thought itD was impossible to ha3Ve constitutedI a more perfect board for the o'bjects for 'which it was appointed. But the appointmnent of two magia. trates to t-ry such cases, neither of whom maight know the 'bowsprit from the mast of a ves,sel, wvas a great miistake, though it was proposed to remedy it by empwering the Beard of Trade to appoint an assessor. Mr. ardwell had told him that the power was only a permissive power uinder '-the Bill, but 4,reat dissatisfaction hadl been created by the manarner in which that permnissive power had been exercised. He was aware he should be told that very fewr trials wrere conducted in thin way, and that most oa,es were re:ferred to the local marine hoard. So they were, hut not the miost important. These latter had been taken from the maost cOMetn tribunal to he triedl before theo leas,t compQ. tout tribunal,1' composed of two magistrates a'nnd a nmaval officer. He should not he suspected of say. ingeanything disrespectful of the Officer-s of the navy -whn he conitended' that a naval officer, under such circumstances, was not the fittest person to judge of the con. duct of acaptain in the merchant service. A naval captain -went to sea with officers, some of whoin he knew, hut a ,xierchant captain had under him 20 or 30 nien, all strangers. Was it strange, then, that a naval caiptain should carry his ship,, under such circumstances, through a gale of wind, -'while a merchant captain lost his? Was it to he said that that was owing to negligence or carelessness on the part of the merchant captain? What he contended for was that the merchant captain, like the naval captain, should he tried by his peers, and that was the case when he was tried by the local muarineo board. The mer. chiant captains, therefore, had great cause for dissatisfaction -with the law as it stood, and because the Board of Trade e-xercised this permissive power in appointing anl incompe-tent and unjust tribunaLl instead of a competenit and just tIn. bunal. But this was not all. The Board of Trade evincd a geat desire to grasp a power which it did not possess. Unidor one of the sections of the Merchant Shiipping Act, in the care of a wreck or of a vessel going on shore, certain duties were deputed to the receiver or person who assisted in caes of distress. That person was to furnish infor. -matson to the Board of Trade, to which no moerantile inan could take exception. He was to supply the namie and description of the ship, the namnes of the niaster and owner, -the name of the owner of the cargo, and the ports from and to whiceh the ship was bound , the cause of the distress of the shiip, and the services rendered. He should bave imnaginied that that information was quite suflicient, hut the section went,on to require information of ali matters or circumstauces re ating to such ship or cargo as might bOdeemed miecessary. Would the House believe that under those words the Board of Trade, in reference to the los of a ship, had asked the owner whether thie ship and cargo -were insured, and to what aigount ? There was notliing 'urder the section to justify such an inquiry, wvhich was one of a miost incluisitorial, nature. If the information continued in the privacy of the Board of Trade it would, prerhaps, be of little conse luence, but the Act provided that .all the information should he posted at Lloyd's. Now, what mercantile man would like to have it post-ed at Lloyd' that -he had lost 50,0001. or 60,0001. uninsured ; or in case of insurance, whiat underwrriter would like to he posted as liable fc coa sum4 -- n on caeT eso h a be se fcr that sum?' In one case, a person wh~o bad been ase for this ilformation had been advised to tell the Board of Trade,by way of answer, to mind their ownbusinessand that lie would mind his; and such an answer, in more courteous terms, was actually returned. He gave the Board of Trade credit for doing what thoy believed to be their duty ; and while be bad the honour of serving on the local board of Iaverpool any difference never arose with the Board of Trade which could not be amicably arranged. Latterly, however, thero had been such constant interference o_n the part of the Board of 'Trade with local self-govern. ment that the members of the local board, with one exception, had all resigned. Those gentlemen served the public ratuitonel, and with the utmost assiduity and integrity at they w.ere constantly thwarted by the Board of Trade. liince he gave notice of this motion the late chairman of the Inverpool board wrote to him in these w.ords: " Although the Board in London did on all occasions concede in the end our recommendations, it was generally the result of long, wearisome, unnecessary correspondence." A &reat Dunuber of cases had been brought to bis notice In 'wich masters of ships considered they had been hardly dealt with, and in others it was complained that the action of the Board of Trade had not been sufficiently stringent. In the latter cases he believed, however, that the Board of Trade had acted strictly in accordance with the letter of the law. In one instance the license'of a captain who was a notorious drunkard had been suspended, but three years after'wards it was renewed on his appeal by the Board of Trade, because they were unable to obtain 2irta oce evidence of his habits, and they could not proceed upon written evi-dence. In that case he believed the Board had no alternative. Hle (MIr. Horafall) agreed entirely with the observations of Mr. Berke as to the functions of The Board of Trade with reference to reportsag upon local BiDs. He thought it was inconsistent with 'proper legislation that a board-or, rather, one or two individusa.., should, without hearing any but ex parte evidence, be aDlowed to send to mnembers of Parliament, who were to .sit as jurors to consider the merits of private Bills, reports which were in favour of or opposed to those Bills. ([Hear, .ler) Such a system he regarded as altogether inconsistent vith the principles of the British constitation. Ec would r,ot enter into the question of looal dues. It had been said that he meant to take occasion in bringing forward his motion, to refer to the subject of local daes; but he could asure the right hon. member for Kidderminster (alr.Lowe) that ha did not intend to make the slightest allusion to that subject. Re might state, however. that there were hon. gentlemen on both sides of the House who were opposed to him on the question of local dues, but who meant to support the present motion, He could not help taking that opportunity of referring to one measure, tLe Birkenhead Dooks Bill, which was at present under the consideration of a committee. Hon.gentlemen could have no conception of the obstructions which bad been thrown-many of them, he feared, by committees acting upon the recommendations of the Board of Trade -in the way of constructing docks at Liverpool and Birkenhead, For want of sufficient dock accommodation at those places vessels were kept waiting not only for days, bat for weeks, befoic they could discharge their cargoes. It was not Liverpool alone that suffered from this state of things, but the whole trade of the country and the public exchequier were also affected. A very long report had been mnade by the Board of Trade -with -reference to the Bill to which he alluded, and he would read a paragraph from that document : "As regards the first of the above Bils, involving, as it dces, nautical and engineering questions, mbylords have only to observe, as they observed last year, that the plans to be adopted should be sucl as to meet the wants, not merely of the town of Liverpool, but of all persons inthe country who are interested in the trade of the Mersey. They think it the more important to make this observation, since the Admniralty, who in general report on all questions of this cir d on hehalf of the public, have Lot done so of late years, in consequence, it is believed, of the creation of the Mersey Conservancy." But there was a singular censure passed upon the Board of Trade by the Admiralty, who said, with reference to this Bill: ,'It appears from the plans and sections transmitted to the Admiralty that the subject of giving every facility for vessels of all classes to dock and undock, and of affording every accommodation to the trade, has been well and deeply considered by the engineers of the corporation, and as regards the docks and their entrances their lordships have no objecion to make. With respect to the further accommo- - dation to shipping so much wanted in the Mersey, their lordships consider it would be highly desirable that works oni which so much time and money had been spent, should now be carried out and completed, and that the corporation of Liverpool, who ought to be the best judges of the requireirents, and who have the greatest interest in the outlay, ishould be permitted to complete works which have remaintd so long inabeyance." He hoped the hon. baronet the chairman of the Commnittee on the Birkenhead Docks Bill and the members of that committee would correct the reanort of the Board of Admiralty as well as that of the Board of Trade. He did not think the House coald have any coneeption of the loss which resulted to the trade of the country, and to the public revenue, from the want of dock accommodation at Liverpool He might illustrate this point by referring to the impediments thrown in the way of the commerce of Liverpool some years ago by the Board of Custonis, In 1835 there were 110 lauding waiters in Liverpool ; the trade of the port was increasing; representations were made to the Board of Customs that for want of landing waiters great delay took place in the discharge of vessels, but the answer was that Liverpool had landing waiters enough, and that no addition would he made to the number. For 10 years similar representations were continued, but although the trade of the port had increased 60 per cent. the Board of Customs would only allow 110 landing waiters. The consequence was that vessels were frequently detained for a fortnight or three weeks before they could be discharged, and the loss both to the merchants and to the revenue was immense. So great was the grievance that the American captains complained to their Government that they were detained in the Liverpool docks, waiting for a Custom-house officer, for a longer period than it took them to make the voyage across the Atlantic. Thle result was that a committee was appointed in Liverpool, which entered into minute calculations, sbowing that the loss sustained by the trade of Liverpool, Manobester, and the manufacturing districts amoui ted to some hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum. Representations on the subject were made to Sir Blt Peel, then the Prime Minister, who listened to them in utter astonishment, and said to the committee, "Gentlemen, this matter shall have my personal attention," and within six weeks 56 additional officers of Customs were appointed to the port of Liverpool. He (Mr. Horsfall) hoped the noble lord at the head of the Government would imitate the example of Sir BR. Peel, and say with reference to this subject, " It shall have my personal attention." He was quite sure if the noble lord said so he would carry out his declaration, and would reconstitute the Board of Trade in such a manner that instead of being, as it now frequently was, an obstruction to trade, it would be the means of promoting the commerce and increasing the revenne of the country. The fact was that the trade of the kingdom was coming to a dead lock at Liverpool for want of sufficient dock accommodation. He now came to the Board of Trade returns with reference to agriculture. Although he Eid reason to believe that thosereturns, so far as they related to corn, were altogether erroneous, he had been unwilling to hazard such an opinion without good authority, and he hadwritten to the President of the Association of the Corn Trade in Liverpool, from whom he bad received the following resolation, which was adopted by that association yesterday:- " That the official returns of grain are generally regarded by the corn trade throughout England as utterly worthless for any statistical purpose, and since the repeal of the Corn Laws these returns have had no other use. Such a statement is strongly instanced by the fact that in oraboutJune, 1855, it having become desirable that the quantity of British corn actuaDy brought into the home market, as indicating the probable stock remaining in the hands of the farmers, should be accurately estimated, the Board of Trade returns were examined in the belief that, as they had been uniformly taken for some years past, they might be found to be useful. Ur on such examination it was observed that the buyers had of late been making few returns, and a circular was immediately issued to the local inspectors which had the effect of producing a very large increase in the number of returns made by the buyers, showing at once the faLacy of previous returns as a ground of calculation, or of accuracy as regards statistics in any sbape." ie should also read to the House the oplnion of the President of the Agricultural Society upon the same subject. In a letter which he had received from that gentleman two or t}ree days before he said:- " I am decidedly of opinion that any svstem of agricultural statistics worked by the Board of Trade, constituted as it is, would be of little or no practical value. Even the Scotch statistics, creditable as they are to those who have got them up, command little or no confidence in the corndealing world. Mr. H. farms some 3,000 acres in Scotland, snd, as a contributor to the figures and knowing well how they are obtained, places no reliance on the results." Thus much for the corn statistics of the Board of Trade. He sbould next call the attention of the House to a subject in which those who were connected with the landed interest were deeply concerned-he alluded to the supply of gaano, and he siould read upon that subject the opinion of the chairman of thie committee of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, who was perfectly unprejudiced in the matter, and who could not ha subposed to be actuated by an unkindly feeling towards the Board of Trade. That gentlemain said: "eYou wil doubtless remember accompanyingrandeputalben from this Chamber to the Boatd of Trade in 1854 on this subject. In this neighbearhood the monopoly of the guano of Peru has always been deemed evidence of a gigantic lunder on the pa t of the Government and, wo sup pose of the Board of Trade. This will not be forgotten as long as that supply exists and is so locked up; and lately, when the trune Muina Islands were found and granted to the Brtbish Government, we hoped that some offlcial effort would be made to repair that mistake; on the contrary, wse see another monopoly created, and in a wayz that puzzle as well as annoys us. TheEmigration Comnissioners,whoseem to be subordinate to the Colonial. office, and to have nothing to do with guano or with trade, make a grant of the islands to a private firm, the value of which is already currently estimated at 1,000,0001. sterling. We don't blame MIessrs. Ord, hindtan b and Co. * they j seek profit and have found and ther ips no dishonesty i asking for such a grant; but we do think a department of Government, taking upon it self the control and management of our trading relations with foreign Powers, should have used a little more vigilance on tebslf of the public, the buyers of this guano and, tbrough them, of the nation at large." boa,ithaoben his duty i conjuncUton with the chairman of theShipownes' Association of Liverpool to wait upon the Secretary for the Coloniesupon thesubject referred to in that document, and he was beund to say that the rieht hon. gentleman had evinced the utmost desire to facilstate the attainment of the object which they had in view. The result had been that the Shipowners' ALssociation, as the representatives of the shipping interest of the united kingdom, had agreed upon certain terms with the representatives of the lessees of the islands in question, which they had submitted to the Secretary of the Colonies for approval, BIe had very properly referred t,hose terms to the Board of Trade, that they mightj pronounce their opinion with regard to them ; and in order that the House might understand exactly how the matter stood he (Mr. Horsfall) might briefly state the nature of the terms or arrangement, as well as ofVthe answer which had been returned upon the part of the Board of Trade. The terms of arrangement set forth that the trade in guano was to be confined to importation into the united igdom* to be open to all parties on payment of 1i. per ton and the royalty of 2s. per ton for the Sirst year, and 4s. per ton for tho second and subsequent years, and that all parties were to be treated alike upon the basis of the terms, without any partiality. When he had transmitted those terms of arrangement to the Secretary for the Colonies he had taken the liberty of suggesting that, as no duty was payable on Peruvian guano, the Government ought to relinquish the small royalty of 2s. and 4s. which they claimed. Now, if such a p oposition were made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he could very well understand his replying to it in the negative, buth ie could not quite so well comprehend why the Board of Trade, whose duty it avowedly vias to protect and promote commerce, should refuse to accede to it. Such, however, had been the case, and not only had th proposition been negatived, but it had been put forward as an excuse for its rejection that it would tend to create a monopoly npon the partof theLiverpoolshipowners notwithstanding the terms of the arrangement -were so explicit upon that had that it was impossible any person of common sense could have made a mistake as to their meaning. The answer of the Board of Trade, addressed to the ' ht hon gentleman the Secretary for the Colonies, was to the effect that, in their view of the polihy to be observed in reference to the islands in question, it was the object of Her Majesty's Government to secure for the benefit of agriculture in the British territories the deposits of fertilizing material which those islands had been represented to contain, and that by throwing open to shipping in general the carriage of guano its supply would be inaured to these countries upon the most advantageous terms. Their lordships added that they could not but apprehend that any special agreement between the agents of the licensees and a section of the shipping interest of these kingdoms confined to a single port would be inconsisnten with the wider interests which were involved in the matter. For these reasons they exPrssed themselves as not prepateo rommen d cn lace with the nPiohation. Such was the reply of the tor fTqe a etogi from wvhat he had already stated the House aeould be of opinion that that body had more todo than itcould effoiently perform. Bat ther was alo anfother departnent under the superintendence of the .Board of Trade-he auded to our railways. The Houise eas aware that a very wise and proper provision. existed in accordance with which it was necessary befor any railway was opened, thab a coipetent engineer should be sen c to inspect it, and to report upon its construction. Bat was that provision, he would ask, complied with? Re should confidently answer that question in the negative. Coinpetent persons were not sent by the Boarld of Trade to inspect the new lines of railway, and in proof of that he might adduce one instance which he thought would clearly establish that the view which he took upon the subject was correct. He held in his hand the report of an engineer-Mr. G. P. Bidder-whichewas nddressed to the chairman and directors of the Norfolk Railwav Company, and which went back as far as the year 1849,-a period at which the right hon. gentleman the present Vice-President of the Board of Trade was not responsidie for anything which might have taken place in connexion with the department. He should, with the permission of the House, read a few extracts from the report : "In 1849 the Government inspector reported to the Railway Department of the Board of Trade that the Torksey viaduct and bridge over the River Trent, over the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnahire line of raiway, was inseudre, and Icould not be opened with safety to the public.' The Government bIspector required additions to be nmade to its strength' which the engineer of the railway declared to he unnecessary, and which he refused to recommend the railwvay company to make. After three months correspondence and delay the Board of Trade consented to certain experiments being tried before the Government Inspectors, in order to ascertain the strength of the bridge.. These experiments took place on the 2Sth of March, 1850,and ou the 6th of April the Board of Trade informed the directors of the line that they had ' reconsidered ' the propriety of allowing the line to be opened, and were wiUing to allow it to be used., It has been used from that day to the present time without a single accident." Again,- "The Railway Department of the Board of Trade refused, on the report of their inspector, to allow the opening of the line from Waterloo-station to Vauxhall on the South-We3tern Railway, on account of the assumed insufficient strength of the bridge which spans the Westminsterroad. After considerable delay the line was allowed to be used, without the bridge being strengthened. The whole traffic of the line has ever since passed across that bridge without a single accident or threat of one." From these instances it appeared, in the words of tho rel:ort,- " That the Railway Department of the Board of Trade is in the habit of receiving from its inspectors reports and representations of a character calculated to excite needless alaxms; and that it is also in the habit of assuming upon those reports a false position, from which, sooner or later, it is obliged to recede." In conclusion, the report states " In order to inquire and report satisfactorily respecting a railway, it is neces3sary that the inspectors should be persons of enlarged experience, accustomed, not only to the construction of railways, but to their daily use. In the present and in other cases the reports to the Board of 'T'rade upon railways, their working, and their condition, have been made by a gentleman who has never himself been engaged in the construction of a single mile of railway or of a single bridge, who practically knows nothing about either, and whose only source of practical acquaintance with the subject on which he so strongly reports is that practice of inspection of new railways which for aU useful purposes every civil engineer knows to be valueless and absurd." Without entering atallintomeredifferenconlocal matters, he bad sufficiently shown, he thought, that the Board of Trade, as at present constituted, was not fitted to discharge the duties which were imposed upon it. NV thout any disrespect to the House of which the noble lord at the head of the department was a member, or to the profession to which the right hon. gentleman the vice-president belonged, it was the universal feeling of the commercial community that a peer and a lawyer were not exactly the persons to preside over the commercial interest of the country. (Hear, hear.) Had he deemed it necessary he might have occupied the time of the House at much greater length in detailing his reasons for making this motion, but he had stated enough to justify I himin calling on the representatives of the commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, and railway interests for support, and in appealing to the candour of the noble lord at the bead of the Government and to the justice of the House of Commons to grant him this committee. (Hear.) The hon. gentleman concluded by moving for a select committee to inquire into the origin, the past and present constitution, and tIC powers and duties of the Board of Trade, with a view to its better adaptation to the requirements of the country. Mr. LABOUCHERE said he had listened to the speech-of the hon. gentleman with surprise and disappointment, He had expected that in making a motion which involved a censure of that important department of the Government which was particalarly charged with the care of the mercantile interests of the community, a gentleman of the great experience and high standing of the hon. member for Liverpool would have prefaced and justified it by the exposition of large and comprehensive views on this subject, by statements which would have led the House to believe that the Board of Trade, if differently constituted, might have produced more satisfactory results, and, above all, by pointing out, by reference to its history for some years past, how completely that department had failed to discharge the duties for which It was created. Bat the hon. gentleman's speech, on the contrary, was almost entirely composed of details of local quarrels and grievances, of the complaints of his constituents and the constituents of other hon. gentlemen against the Board of Trade-complaints which, if they were all true, only proved that the Board of Trade had acted wrong in those particular cases, or that the law under which it had acted required amendment; but which certainly furnished no ground why that department should be arraigned before a committee with a view to its entire reconstruction. (Eear, hear.) But were the complaints of the hon. gentleman against the board well founded? The history of the department for the last few years was intimately connected with the history of the country. Beginning from the time of Mr. Ruskisson, a struggle had been going on for the liberalization and improvement of our commercial system, in which the Board of Trade had borne a conspicuous and honourable part; and it was not too much to say that the aid which it had given to the passing of the various measares by which our trade and commerce had been freed from all those shackles3with which it had been formerlygencumbered had been of the utmost advontage to the community. The hon. gentleman had not explained very clearly in what manner heproposedto reconstructtheBoardof Trade, but he appeared to object to its being placed in the hands of any persons who were not intimately connected with commercial pursuits. That was a doctrine, however, which had never been received in the House of Commons. It had always been insisted on that the functions of the Board of Trade should never be intrusted to any person directly connected with commerce. When Mr. Poulett Thomson, afterwards Lord Sydenham, was appointed Vice-President of the Biard of Trade, the first question asked in that House (by' the present Lord Lonsdale, if he remembered arieht) was, "Have you given up all eounexion with the mercantile house in which you had a share?' That had always been the principle, and a very valuable and important principle it was, and one which he hoped would never be departed from. (Rear, hear.) For what were the functions of a Minister of Trade in this country? It was bis duty to take a large and impartial view of he interests of trade, not only as between the persons engaged in par ticular branches of trade, but also as to the relations of that trade with the community at large. The questions of trade with which he had to do did not Interest traders alone, but the whole communitv. It might happen that for a time those interests might be at variance, and it was of the utmost impoitance that the Minister of the Crown who presided over this department should be independent of any branch of trade. Se would appeal to the House whether this country had suffered from the adoption of that rule. (Hear, hear. There was no reason why a merchant having left trade should not beappointed President of the Board of Trade. No one could object to the appointment of such a man as the late Lord Ashburton; and Mr. P. Thomson, after being actively engaged in commerce, presided with efficiency over the Board ofiTrade: but men equally distinguished might be quoted on the other side who had never been engaged in commerce. Mr. Huskisson was an illustrions example, and he saw opposite to him a right hon. gentleman (Mr. Henley), a man of acuteness, information, and intelligence, who was quite as able to come to a conclusion upon any matter relating to trade as any merchant could be. Common senso was quite as valuable a qualification for the office as a knowledge of the., A 3ilt.- ortae,a- agra ndesnia on theO details of trade, an a grea an eseta ..o_n_ was that the Minister of ITade should not he acetually Interested in the mnatters na whbich he bad to decide. The principle that the anffais of trade should be managed exclusively by mnerchants was, he ontended, a retrograde principle. It was a return to the old principle that trade was best manaed by gids ; it iraplied a partial and one-sided view of commercisalaffairs, and if it had been acted upon our legislation would haive proortionably suffered. BOe had a great respect for the sPowners, but if they had had exclusive possession of the Board of Trade they would never have repealed the navigation laws. (Rear, bear.) They would, it was true, have repealed them at last, but those laws would not have been repealed, as they had ben before the mischief was done, but when they had lost half their markets, and when other nations had retaliated upon them, When it was too late, when the mischief had been done, when their doors were besieged by shipowners complaining that they were ruined, then a Board of Trade so composed would have repealed the navigation laws. (Elear, hear.) The hon. gentleman had truxly stated that the functions of the Board of Trade were very much altered of late years It used to be a great consulting department. It was consulted by the Treasury in those tariffs in which the protecting principle used to e largely mixed up; by the Colonial-office, in those colonial Acts which referred to commercial subjects ; and by the Foreign-office, in those tariff treaties, now happily out of date, in which we consented to let in the goods of foreign countries at a certain rate if they would concede reciprocal advantages. That system had been swept away, but the Board of Trade still continued to be a consulting department. Questions of trade continued to arise in which it was of the utmost importance that the TIreasury, the Colonial-office, and the Foreign-office should be able to obtain the advice of a separate department, whose duty it was to consult the interests of trade as distinguished from the secondary interesb of revenue. He had himself had ocasion, only the othei day, to refer to the Board of Trade a consolidated qmmer"cial code, 'whichi he h1,d iecoived in ouiry. The sEssion would not endure probably more th&s £wo months longer; a great Dumber of election committees had to be appointed and ho did not see that it would bepco, siblt to give to this subjectthatfaUlandcompleteinvestigation in the course of the present session which its im.- portance demanded. If his noble fiitnd would introduoe a. motion restricting his proposition to univergity election, he, should be inclined to support it, but ho was persuadd that; the Eystem would not answer in the case of any other con-- Bsituency. (Hear, hear.) Sir F. KELLY said, it appeared to him that the admissionw of his noble friend who had just sat down, that the syateun of voting papers might be productive of benefit in electlonsn for the universities ought to be conclusive in favour of the. motion of his noble friend the member for Stamford. - Let. him remind the House that his noble friend did not propose' tO introduce a Bill, but that he asked their assent merely tok the grseting of a committee, by which an inquiry would bea made into a question of the highest and most general importance in relation to the election of mombers of :Parlia ment. He thought that they had only to call to mind the. great evils which would be completely remediod if means could abe devised for takingvotes by voting papers in county elections to induce the House to agree to the motion for . committee of inquiry. In the first place there was the, vexa q=uiuUo of the legality of aillowing travelling es_ penses to voters; and if the investigations of the corn. mittee should be attended with no other benefit than the setting of that one question at rest, it ought. to be sufficient to induce the HIouse to agree to the. motion. Let them see how that question was lefb now. It had been held by Lord Wensleydale, although nocondition had been imposed upon the voter, on paying, orpromisig to pay, his travelling expenses, as to the parti. cular candidate for whom he abouldL vote, that sach p&yment, or promise to pay, was illegal, andthatif made by the candidate his election would be void. On an appde to a Court of Error the majority of the judges arrived at an opposite conclusion. The decision of the Court of gxchequer.Chamber was now about to be carried, by a wrt of error, to the House of Lords, and until the decision of that; tribrnal should be pronounced the state of the law on thix important subject would remain so uncertain that nocounsel could advise, and no committee of tLe House. could decide, with confidence upon it. That question woulub be at once and for ever set at rest if the voteswere taken by means of voting Tapers. (Hear, hear.) Beyond this, it must be remembered that the great bulk oEf the expense at all-contested county elections wouald be altogether spared if the votes were taken in the way proposed.. Again, great and crMing evils arose at all elections from the, sYstem of treating, which the law hitherto had been quite. inadcquate to suppress; but if the votes were takea bypapers as proposed it would be quite impossible, except by- a glaring and open violation of the law as few would& resort to. that the system of treating could continue to be. practised at elections in thi$ country. Under these circumstances bethought that it would be most unwise to refusetotake evidence before a committee upon the details of this question merely because it had been suggested that in some, ectlons, by means of voting papers under the Poor law. frauds and forgeries had been committed. Upon this he observed that wherever inquiries had been instituted into these forgeries there had been no difficnlty in detecting them and in bringing the, offenders to justice; and that it would be extremelyeasg to obviate the objections vhich had been urged, by an improved system of machinery as applied to Parlimentary elections. Under the Poor LaT the important. duty of leaving the voting papers at the houses of the. electors and of collecting them after they were signed, ha&, been entrusted to a class of persons who, from their station.. and from the mere accidental character of their employment, were unworthy of the confidence reposed in them, and were, not competent to discharge the duties which they undertook. Nothing would be easier, however, than to provide the returming officer with adequate assistance-which might be. furnished by the State at the ultimate expense perhans or the candidates-for sending by post, accompanied br alk necessary safeguards, the voting papers to the addresses of the electors; and then a mode might be devised by which the elector should fill up his voting paper in presence, say, of a instice of the peace, or a commissioner for taking affidavits, or of some, other trustworthy and honourable person. He would not enter further into the details of the matter, wihich would more properly be considered by the committee - but, looking at the saving of money which the adoption of' such a system would effect, and at the evils which it would cure, he urged Her Majesty's Government to recommend& the EIouse to agree to the motion of his noble friend. Sir G. GREY said, that the reason [given by the. hon. and learnedgentleman for supporting this motionviz., that it was not for leave to bring in a Bill, bmt. only for the appointment of a committee-was the one` which chiefly induced him to oppose it. (Hear, hear.) The proposition of the noble lord involved questions of nosmall magnitude. If adopted, it would, as regarded counties and universities, alter not only the mode, but also the duration of elections; because between the nomination of candidates and the declaration of the poll there must be allowed sufficient time for the returning officer to send voting papers. to all non-resident electors within the united kingdom, some of whom might be in the Orkneys or the Shetland Islands, and to receive these papers back1fromthem. That would bea great inconvenience; but there were others of afargreater magnitude which had Deea mentioned b his hon. friend themember for Yarmouth (Mr. M'Cullagh) and the noble lord the member for King's Lynn (Lord Stanley), who thought that if this plan were adopted it would increase the facilities for personation and diminish the security that thevote givea. W.as bon jde that of the person entitled to exercise the, franchise. Without expressing adecidedopinionlwhetheriS6 might be right to entertaiu this proposal, he must say that. he considered it one which the House ought to decide for itself, and ought not to refer to a committee. 5Hear, hear.) Even if a committee unanimously reportea in favour of the noble lord's plan no member would be. bound by that report, the matter would have to be debated in the House, and all the objections which had been. taken that evening would again be urged against the propoedalteration. If the House were agreed upon the PrOpriety of the change, but doubtful as to the best machinery to be. adopted, it might then be proper to refer the selection oft such machinery to a select committee. As he understoodthe noble lord, however, his proposal was tbat the whole. question Should be referred to the committee. The hon. and learned gentleman (Sir F. Kelly) seemed to go furtherthan the noble lord. The noble lord advocated this change, chiefly with reference to non-resident voters; but the hon. and learned gentleman clearly contemplated the substitution in all county elections of voting by papers for the 'resent system of open voting. Now, without expressing a. nnal and decided opinion, he (Sir G. Grey) thought that. there existed the gravest objections to such a proposal. The hon. and learned gentleman said that the adoption of such a system would necessarily abolish bribery and treating. He (Sir G. Grey) did not understand how it could abolishs bribery, nor, unless you abolished all nominations and theassembling of the freeholders at them, how it could put. down treating. If such assemblages continued there wouldb stil be the temptation to invite.people into publichouses in order to induce them to sign a voting paper. If the noblelord would, with the assistance of the hon. and learned gentleman, who seemed to have all the machinery ready in his. mind, prepare a Bill showing the details of his scheme and; how the objections to it could be obviated, he (Sir G. Grey) would, for one, give his assent to such a Bill being laid, upon the table; but he was not prepared to commit the House to the principle of the proposed change by referring the matter to a committee upStairs. (Hear, hear.) Mr. H. BERKELEY trusted that no hon. member would imagine that this was a measure of reform, or even an. instalment tov ards reform. It was just such a measure asthat passed by the late Parliament under the title of the. " Corrupt Practices Prevention Bill." That Act had prove& a perfect ignisfatuus (a laugh), and this was a proposal of a- similar sort. Ho must, however, congratulate hon gentlemen opposite on the new sort of feeling which had risen. among them. At the present moment thero was some approach to the footpath of reform to be seen on their ideof the House. (Hear, hear.) They seemed to him liketimorous bathers standing at the outside of a machine, just wetting a foot but afraid to plunge in. (Ianughter.), Hon. gentlemen would have to make the plunge, but this Bill was a mere puddle, and not the wholesome sea into which he would have them jumv. He trusted that, as the feeling of the House seemed to be so much against this proposal, the noble lord would withdraw his motion. (Heir.)j Lord J. MAhNNIERS could not agree with his noble fziend that the evils of which he complainod could only be reme. died by the plan which he had proposed. On the contrary, he had in his pocket a very ingenious plan (a laugh), which, if this subject were referred to a select committee, he should, like to see fully considered. Havinig heard that the Gove'n. ment would not support the appintment of this committe% and considering the state of publia business, he hoped that his noble friend would not press his motion to a division. (Hear, hear.) Lord R. CECIL said, that no one would on princinle. objece to takling votes by papers if the details could beoo arranged that no mischief would arise from such a plan therefore all that the committee for which he asked would. have to consider would be a question of detail. Knowing how undesirable it was that any member on that side of the, House should press a measure in the teeth of Her Majesty's. Government, he should take the course which had been sag- gested by the right hon. gentleman the Home Secretary. He would, with the permission of the House, withdraw this motion with a view of introducing a Bill upon the subject. (Rear, hear.) Mr. M'CULLAGH, having been called upon by the. SrAimx, expressed his willingness to withdraw his motion. for the previous question; and, Leave having been given, the previous question and the. motion. were both withdrawn. TEE BOARD OF TRADE. Mr. HORSFALIin rising to move for a select committeh to inquire into tho origin and constitution of the Boxrd of Trade, expressed the deep sense which he entertained of thediffculties of the duty which he bad undertaken, and dis. claimed being actuated by party or political motives. He, begged also to assure the right hon. gentIeman the Vice- President of the Board of Trade that nothing whic mighs. fall ffom him would be intentionally disrespectful to himset or to tho noble lord who presided with so much courtesy over the department with which he was connected. He, did not complain that the Board of Trade ws a sinecure On the contrary, his complaint was that the, duties imposed upon that board were too numerous, too various, and too complicated, to insure sheit being satisfactorily and efficiently discharged. Before going intothe main question perhaps he might bepermittedtoglintA at the.origin of the Board of Trade. In the year 1636, !A the rein of Charles I., 'the first conmtittee -of trad as appointed, and that boartd was reconattltced by Cromw.ll i I651, who placed his son Richard Cromweflat its head, sa associated with him certain Lords of the CoqnqiliE421 the form of an ordinance from Malta, and whicE embracedd many questions of a complicated and Important natare. It was obvious that, simplify trade as much as they might, ihere must always remain questions upon which ie would ba important that the various departments of the G overnment should be able to consult a board so constituted as to be able to give a careful, impartial consideration to the subjects upon which they were called upon to adviso the Government. The question then came, how such a dejaltment ought to be constituted. He held to the opinion that, althounh the Board of Trade ought always to be o en md accessib e to the traders of this country, and although it was their duty to listen to every representation made on the i part of those engaged in trade, yet it was essential to th3 munctions of the Board of Trade and for maintaining its credit aud confidence that the members and presiding officersof theboard should be themselves free from participation in trade, and above suspicion in that respect. He was unvwilling to go into details on the subject, and would leave them for the vice-president of the board. It was true that be had had communications with the local commercial bodies of Liverpool, and he should always be ready to acknowledge the support he had received from them in framing the great meaure of mercantile marine. He was not surprised that differences had arisen upon some of the questions settled by the measure of consolidation brought in by Mr. Cardwell, and he could not mention Mr. Cardwell's name without referring to the great loss which the House had asatained in the absence of a gentleman of his high character and great qualificationsfrom their deliberations. (Hear, hear.) He believed that one of the hon. member's complaints was that the tribunals now appointed in cases ot wreck were not composed of shipowners or captains, but of a more independent tribunaL Certainly, ir the circumstances attending upon a wreck were interesting only to thema-if there were no general or public interests involved-he would say let a man be tried y bis peers, and let a shipowner be tried by shipowners, and a ship captain by ship captaim. But there was another party-namely, the pub, a-who took a deep interest in these matters. It was for the nublio interest that questions ef wrecks should be probed to the bottom, and that they Ehould be tried by a tribunal of greater independence than shipowners and ship captains exclusively. (Rear, hear.) Much of the hon. member's speech was composed of Liverpool grievances aast the Board of Trade, and, even if they were veU-founded, they would not be valid arguments against the constitution of the Board of Trade, but would only he complaints against those who p resided over it, which he had no doubt they would be able satisfactorily to answer. The hon. member complained that the Board of Trade should meddle with rivate Bills and make reports upon them. He had always =eard that private BiUs often came before select committees, where the interests of powerful individuals and great corporations were adequately represented, but where the public nad also great interests at stake, which were entirely unrepresented. It was therefore thought essential that the oard of Trade should present reports, statingthe publio view of these questions. The hon. member might complain that these reports were not properly done, and that would be a speoial complaint which might be- investigated; but as a generil system he thought the Board of Trade discharged a most valuable and important function in exaamining what was to be said on behalf of the public upon the question at issue. (Hear.) Thehon.gentleman alluded to the important committee presided over by the right hon. member for Carlisle, which was now sitting on a question connected with the interests of the port of Liverpool. He (M3r. Labouchere) had the task, the year before last, of presiding over a similar committee, and he had sufficient acquaintance with the circumstances of the case to know that the Bill to which reference bad been made, though nominally a private measure, involved important public onsiderations. Herejoiced, therefore, that the matter was now in such able hands. The Board of Trade, in stating its opinion to the committee, had only done its duty; while, on the other baud, that opinion was in no way binding on the tribunal to which it was submitted, but would merely receive its consideration. The hen. gentleman had certainly gone far afield in search of hiz objections to the Board of Trade. The corn returns were made up in too slovenly a manner to pleae him. He forgot, however, that the object of those returns was not statistical, but merely to enable the tithe averages to be struck-a pvxpose for which per;ect accuraoy of detail was wholly unnecessary. Moreover, to collect those returns with minate exactitude would require the creation of a new machinery, and entail a heavy expense to the country, which successive Governments had wisely declined to incur. Again, the hon. member said it was most improper that the Board of Trade should be intrusted with the superintendence of our railway system. Mr. HORSFALL (interrupting).-I beg the right hon. gentleman's pardon, but I said nothing of the kind. My complaint was that the board did not send down competent ecgineers to inspect railways. (Hear, hear.) Mr. LABOQUCHERE.-That, again, was a point of detail which did not touch the constitution of the Board of Trade. That board obtaiued professional advice it regard to railways just as it did in regard to the mercantile marine aud its other functions. But it by no means followed that if theyreconstitutedthe board the evil of which the hon. gentleman complained would be remedied. This objection, also, was therefore totally beside the grave and important question whether this great department of the Government was constituted in a manner which ought to satisfy that House and the public. The hon. member likewise adverted to the subject of guano. He (Mr. Labouchere) had hope that the arrangements nowmade onthis question were perfectly satis. factoryto the constituentsof the hon. gentloma aswellas to the community at large. At aUevents, those arrangamenbs removed every vestige of monopoly and threw the trade open to the shipowners of the entire kingdom. (Hear.) The Board of Trade, besides being a great consulting department, was now also an executive department, exercising most important functions. The working of the Mercantile Marine Act, including the superintendence of the examinations of masters and mates, the improvement of the regulations and discipline of the merchant service, and other important provisions had been intrusted to its supervision. Another measure, introduced at his own instance, had also increased both the dzties and the responsibility of the Board of Trade. He alluded to the Bill relating to that great and embarrassing question-the Merchant Seamen's Fond-passed a few years ago. Before it was transferred to the Board of Trade that fond was administered by those local guilds for whichthe hon. gentleman ecemed to have a predilection; and under their management it fell into a state of incurable insolvency. So deplorable, indeed, was this insolvency, that that House was obliged to come to the resoue, and-to its honour be it said-the House, without a dissentient voice, did an act which, while trnly just, was at the same time noble and generous, haviDg regard to the class of men who were the sufferers by such a state of thmgc. It made a sacrifice oi more than 500,0001. in order to place this fund on a secure footing and under proper management. He had taken a great interest in the new system, and could state that under the Board of Trade it had worked beneficially to the merchant service and satisfactorily to the public. He hardly thought the hon. member seriously intended to press his motion. The appointment of a select committee under the circumstances of the present session could not lead to any useful result. But his main objection to the motion was this-if any step ought to be taken upon it at all the subject was one for the House itself, rather than for a select committee. They were getting into the too frequent practice of referring to select committees questions which properly belonged to the whole lEouse. If the House were of opinion that the principle on -which the Board of Trade was founded was radically wrong, let them say so, and insist on having its constitution altered. But, he for one, could not consent to send such a question to a emall knot of gentlement sitting up stairs. Let the thing be done in the face of day, and on the floor of that House, where the opinions of eminent merchants and the experience of members on both sides who had officiated at the Board of Trade could be brought to be.r on the question. His own belief-and he trusted the House wou!d concur with him-was that nothing in the past history or present condition of that department could justify the affront now sought to be put upon it. Ever since the days of Mr. Huskisson, when the Board of Trade was placed in the hands of independent men unconnected wvith commercial affairs, that Board had rendered invaluable services to the country. He approved its present constitution; but if any part of its duties ought to be severed from it let that be done. It might, indeed, have committed some errors of detai, but no ground h.d been shown for impeaching its general conduct and management. He did not say that this or any other public department might not be remodelled. Some men of great authority thought that Board ought to le more assimilated to other departments, and that we should have a Minister of Trade, assisted by a Parliarrentary secretary. As farasthe performance of the duties in the office were concerned, that might be a better arrange. ment than the present. But, looking to the business to be transacted in both Houses of Parliament, the system of having two Ministers of the rank of Privy Councnllors connected with that department had its undoubted advantaes Tbat, however, was not a question for a select committee, but should be fairly discussed and determined by the Houso itself. If, therefore, the hon. gentlemnan persevered in his motion, the House ought to put a decided negative on so extraordinary a proposition as the reference of a great public department to a select committec, After a pause, Sir J. GRAHA M rose and said, not seeing any gentleman disposed toaddress the House, and as I cannot con. istently with my high sense of duty give a silent vote on this question, I shall take the liberty to offer a few obEervations to the House. I know something of the particular office the composition of which has now been brought tnder the notice of the House. To use the language of Barke, quoted by the hon. member for Liverpool, I may say, "I have known that board off and on for a great number of years." (Hear.) Ever since I have had the honour of a seat in this House, now nearly 40 years, I have teen the functions of that board discharged by men of pre-eminent merit (hear, hear), and I must say I am really surprised that the hon. gentlemen the member for Liverpool should be the person to make an attack upon its character. (Hear, hear.) Why, he cannot take a step in the city he represents without being reminded of one of the most distinguished men who ever sat in this House-one who was a credit to the representation of that city, and who presided over the Board Of Trade with an advantage to this country which our grami-I tude, in my judgment, can never repay. He cannot go to theg Exchange of a morning without seeing the statue of Huskisson, on which it is recorded that he was one of tho greatest benefactors of his country. (Hear, hear.) He cannot take a walk through those docks that adorn the river that flows by the side of the city without seeing on one side the Huskisson Dock andon the other the Canning Dock, and all those immense works, the waters of which receive on their bosom the commerce of the world-the cotton of America, the sugar of the Indies, the tea of China, the gold of Australia-and which it was the great work of Huskisson to promote, (Hear.) Thera ie the Custom-honus, too, which was considered by some machl too large at the time, but whioh his forethought clearly led him to foresee vrould be at a future day inadequate to the irade of Liverpool. (Hear, hear.) Yoa cannot go bayoni the walls of the city, to tho cemetery where the remains of Huskisson rest, without being reminded of what he waswhat shadows we are and what shadows we parsue. And yet the hoa. member for Liverpool on this occasion chooses to attack the Board of Trade. (Hear, hear.) He has made an appeal to my noble frie'nd at the head of the Govern. ment; but I hopo, and, indeed, I am sure, that -my noble friend, who is so honosrably alive to the cbsranter and reputation of Mr. Huskisson, wiUl look t this matter himself, and will be slow indeed to consent to any reconstruction of the Board of Trade. (aear, hear.) The hon. gentleman argae3 thaat the composition- of the Board is not satisfactory. He does not confine this view to the preseut moment, and has p3id some compliments to the noble lord who now presides over that department and to the right hon. gentleman the vice-president of the board, Who sits below me. He said, indeed, something of a lord ard a lawyer; but I may be permitted to say that many noble lords, inclading such men as Ashburton, Dalhonsie, and Ripon, have at times presided there when measures having an important bearing on the interests of the country vere under consideration. I will not speak of my right hon. friend below me (Mr. Lowe), but I doubt whether many men as eminent for their abilities and knowledge as he is have filled the post of Vice-President of the Board of Trade. (Hear, hear.) Iam afraid of wearying the House, and yet I should like to bear testimony-due from me froom my long observation of the merits of this board-to the great services which, in my mind, it has conferred upon the country. ( Hear, hear.) I conceive that the period betiveen 1820 and 1830 was the real commencement of the great battle which hls been fonght in this country for sound commercial and economical principles. Then was really fought the battle of free-trade, of which hMr. Hnslssson was the champion, and then it was reaUy won, and, in rny opinion, the Board of Trade was the pioneer of the sound principles which have since prevailed with reference *t trade and commerce. (Hear, hear.) They cleared - the busb, as it were, prepared the soil, and sowed the good seed which has since increased ind multiplied a hundredfold, til it has prodaced sacha harvest of benefit as was never roduced in any country in. tho world. (Hear, hear.) is melancholy to reflect how the errors and slips of eminent men are remembered while their great services are forgotten:- "Men's evil manners liva in brass; their virtues "We write in water." (Hear, hear.) There is a tendency to dwel on the small errors of great and eminent men, and to forget the services they have conferred on their country. (Hear, hear.) If we look at the mode of dealing with some of the principal articles of trade and commerce previous to 1820 we shall sag that nothing could be more disastrous to the interests of the country. Take, for example, the article of - fuel. In certain parts of these islands we had an abundant supply of fuel, whUe in other parts there was a deficiency that now wil scarcely be believed. It is hardly possible to exaggerxte the evils of the system; seaborne coal was actuallytaxed 60 Ror cent.; but in 1824 Mr. Huskisson, the President of the Board of Trade, was able to procure a great dimiuution in the duty on seaborne coal; and in 1830 Poulett Thomson carried the entire remission of the duty. (Hear, hear.). In looking back to those times I can see nothing more preoj'. dicial than the system of forced bounties that prevailed. In 1829 the bounty amounted to 300,0001. on linen exported that year from Ireland. In the subsequent year. 1830, tie' vicious system of bounties was repudiated, and from that time we have to date the prosperous commencement of the linen trade of Ireland. (Hear, hear.) In 1819 and nre viously it was always supposed by ChanceUors of the IkcheqLer that articles of rge consumption were capable pf bearng a higher duty, with the certainty of yielding more revenue, than those of less consumption; and accordingly, in 1819, Mr. Vansittart raised the dae- coffee from 6d. to ls. Mr. Huskisson objected strongly to the course then pursued, and in 1824 he persuadedthe Government, to try the experiment of a reduction of the duty, and it was reduced from Is. to 6d. In 1824, at the time of the reduction, the quantity of coffee imported was 7,993,0001b., and the revenue was 407,0001 In 1830, six years after the reduction, the quantity imported had risento 22,740,0001b. and the revenue to 583,751f (Hear.) I wiU -not dwell on the question of the navigation laws. Mr. Huskisson was most earnest, together with bLrd Wallace, Vice-President of the Board of Trade, in pTessing for a relaxation of the fetters of that trade, and he effected certain changes, not so extensive as he desired, but such as laid the foundations in argument and in practice for the measure which my right hon. friend (Mr. Labouchere) had the good fortune to carry, when, to his immortal credit, he succeeded in persuading this House, in 1850, to repeal the navigation laws. (ffear, hear.) But a great battle was fought by Mr. Huskisson on another point, stiUl more impcortat than those on which I have touched-I mean the battle he fought against protecting duties. (Hear, hear.) In 1826 he chose as his battle-ground the question of silk, and the struggle was between what was termed the principle of protection to native industry and what Mr. Huskisson called the salutary effect of competition. As the argumentz on both side3 are well stated in a speech by him, I will take the liberty toread anextractfromittotheHouse. Iknow not whether theright hos, gentleman the member for Coventry is in his place, but he was the great advocate of high protection to native ndudstry. He stated the case inthese termns:- "That there were in that laity (Coventry) 9,700 looms, 7,500 of which were in the hands of operative weavers, who applied thir manual labour as well as their machinery to the manufacture of ribands. These looms were, for the most p art, of the worst possible construction; and it would scarcely be believed that the improved loom in Franeo would in a given time, produce five times as much riband as the common loom in England w;ith the same manual labourl He could also state that there existed an improved manufacture in Germany, by which one man could make 48 times as much velvetas could be made inan equal time by an English machine. What chance was there that the English manufacturer could maintain such a competition ?" That was the argument of my right hon. friend the member for Coventry in defence of native industry. (LaIughter.) Will the Elouse listen to the answer of Mr. Huskisson? I think they wiU agree with me that everything that could be tersely and beautifully said in favour of the opposite principlewhich -we have happily arrived at is by him briefly summed up in tbese words. He says *- " The monopoly had produced what monopoly was always sure to produce-an indifference with regard to improvement. That useful zeal which gives life to industry, which fosters ingenuity, and which in manufactures occasions unceasing efforts to produce the article in the most economical form, had been comparatively extinguished. To the prohibition system it was to be ascribed that in silk only, in the whole range of manufactures, we were left behind our neighbours. We have oere a proof of that chilling and benuanbiugeffect which is sure to be produced when no genius is called into action, and when we are rendered indifferent to exertion by the indolent security derived from restrictive regulations. I have not the slightest doubt that if the same system had been continued with respect to the cotton manufacture it would have been at this moment as subordinate in amount to the woollen as it is junior in its introduction into the country." Now ,hear the comments of Mr. M'Culloch, in 1850, on this very question of silk. He says:- "We do not exaggerate, we state the matter of fact, when we affirm that the silk manufacture has made a more raid progress since the abolition of the prohibitive system in tSo tnan it did during the preceding century. The former disparity in quality between the goods ofErench and. English make has been materially abated in most articles, while in a few the superiority is now on our side. The real or declared value of the silk goods of British manufacture exported to France in 1842 amounted to 181,9241." In passing I may observe that the dutv upon silk, notwithstanding the battle that was fought inIfevourofa less restrictive system, remains almost the onlly anomaly in our tariff. There is still on manv articles a duty varying from 25 to 30 per cent. as against foreign manufactures. With regard to articles of raw material, I might allude to many-to timber, for instance, the duty on which was reduced at the instance of Mdr. Poulett Thomson in 183L It was again reduced by my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford while Vice-President of the Board of Trade in 1842 and it was still further reduced by my right honu friend the Colonial Secretary in 18.L Bet I cannot3pass over a particular article, which was one with respect to which the principles of Mr. IIuskisson have signally triumphed, and by which the manufactoring industry of this country has received a moat remarkable impulse. I allude to the article of wool. The foreign raw material was absolutel prohibited, and there was a very heavy export duty uponithe manufactured article. The result of the change is most remarkable. In 1825 Mr. Huskisson entirely abolished the barbarism of an absolute prohibition of import. In lSl9 the duty had been raised by Mr. Vansittart 6d. per lb.. which was equal to 50 per cent. of the value of the article itself. It was reduced in 1825 by Mr. Huskisson, and the duty upon the raw material was entirely repealed by the Government of Sir Robert Peel when my right hon, friend the member for the UJniversity of Oxford was Vice-President of the Board of Trade. The price of home-grown wool was never, I believe, in tho history of this country so high as in the present year. (lear, hear.) The home grower has had all the advantage of the increase in price, while the manufacturer has Lad the advantage of freely importing the raw material (hear); and the export duty upon home-grown wool has also been entirely repealed. ht POint out to you what has ben eBoard of resince 18 on behalf of our commerce. My right hon. friend has stated most truly that the tariff has been revised That revision took place under the immediate advice of the Board of rado. The duty was absolutely repealed on 420 articles. The duty upon all raw materials was reduced. All prohibitory duties were converted into protective duties, and all protective duties were diminished. What has been the effect of al this? I will only just trace the effect upon certain most important arUcles to which I have already referred. The = n. member for Liverpool says that he can learn nothing from the Board of Trado; but the document which I now hold in my hand is the statistical abstract for the present year presented to Parliament by the Board of Trade, and never, in my opinion, was a more important document presented to the consideration of tho House. (Hear.) The short points which J am now about to call to your recollection are all contained in this document. I begin with silk, on which the first experiment was tried. The quantity of raw silk imported into this country in 1 42 wa5 3,651,G001b.; in the year 1856 it had risen to 7,383,0001b. (Hear.) The qualitity of wool imported into this country in 1842 was 45,S81,0001b.; in 1856 it had risen to 116,211,0001b. The quantity of flax imported in 1842 was 1.145 O00cwts. - in 1816 it had risen to 1,687,000owts. Well, now, let us see what is the effect with respect to the exports of these articles.

THE PIrAcrCE oF ELFCio.Ns.-A little volume recently published by Mr. Henry Jeffreys Bushby, barrister, constitutes a manual of the practice of elections in the united kingdom; the preliminaries to a writ, as obtained during the sitting of the House or during the recess by whatsoever means a vacancy is created; tho mode of directing, forwarding, and returning the writ; the preparations for election, the dnties of the sheriff and his staff, snd the proceedings at election, nomination, poll, and return, are hero comprehensively treated in about 100 pages. A fnrther chapter on election audits, corrupt practices, bribery, treating, undue influence, and election expenses generally, is more articelarly pertinent to the present season, and for this done the volume is worth the attention of those interested in the issene now pending. FALT oF A CATHEDRAL.-PLYmou', Thursday. -Yesterday afternoon the roof of the nave and the wall and roof of the south arcade of the Roman Catholic Cathedral, building in Cecil-street, feU to the ground suddenly, several men working below having barely time to escape. The building, which is in the Gothic style, was approaching completion, but from some undoubted symptoms of weakness, fears for its safety have for several weeks existed. It is 150 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 77feet across the transept. The walls are of rough ashlar, and the doors, windows, &c. are finished with worked Bath stone. The accideat has been attributed to several causes. The arcades on each side of the nave are divided from it by four octagonal columns of Bath atone, 1Sl inches in diameter and above 17 feet long, up to the neck of the mould. These columns supported brick arches, wrhich received the walls sustaing the roof of the nave. The roof formed two sides of an equilateral triangle, and was covered with slate. Iteis said that zinc svns laid between the joints of the columns, and, as it offered more resistance and was neither so thick nor malleablo as lead, which is generally used, the stene splintered and peeled, in consequence of which two of the columns on the north side were condemned and replaced by new ones. It is also stated that the wall over was unusually thick and high for the diameter of the Columns, each of which had to sustain a weight estimated by some at 20 and by othbas at 30 tons, when the weight of the roofs of the nave and the wings was added to that of the walls. It is alleged thatthe bricks were not good, and it is certain the brickwork was considered defective (possibly fr,.m having been built during frosty w-ether), for the architect, lr. Hansom, of Clifton, was in the act of superintending the reconstruction of one of the arches when the fall occurred. The four southern columns gave way in the middle, and the rouf of tho nave came down, carrying with it the roof of the south arcade, one of the transept pier3, half of the trautpb 3arch, and a part of the roof, leaving the other part in a very hazardous condition, as some of the principals are disledoed. and might, in the event of stormy weather, brinm d u lte remainder of the transept roof and the eastern roof, whan all thew w softhe cathedal would ba exposed todpger. The wetern wall, the apex of which is about 50 feet kgb, stands now perfectly denuded. Under the directionei lir HRode, the town surveyor, stakes w-ro immediately driven into tie adjacent ground, poles ca-ried across, anA a detachment of police stationed to gnard the public. Tle ijurybythefall is estimated at from 600Z. to 1,0001.

I LOAVDO.N, FBIDAY. JUNZ 5. 187. In the :Roxie of Lords last night, Lord Giux;vnm moved that the HcoUE go into cownittee on the Sale of Poinos Bill a, measure which contained some very usefulp royiaou, uiougis it was not, perhaps, as perfect as it might be. After some discnsaion, in which LoTr CBs X HAnWImem, and TsAIoT 3Y& !LARM took part, Lord MzESDnxu proposed that-tLC Xl be ferred to a select cominittees This propositiont was agreed to. The report Qf meudinzents on1 tho DiVOT0a. a
In answer to a question from Sir JoiNHTRwEAvwY, and to a more searching interrogation by Sir Jonc PARiNo<rox, Lord PAUILMsToN last night announced an intention, or rather expressed a hope, of in- I troducing a Bill for the abolition of Chturch-rates " before long"-that is, " of course, in the present | " Session." If " abolition" is the measure reaUy intended, a Bill might be brought in next week or the purpose, seeing that nothing can be easier than to put the whole of this metropolis in the same position, as reopects the maintenance of its churches, as the greater part is already. If the churches of tle greater part of the metropolis were falling out of repair, and evidently in want of thcir periodical washing, glazing, slating, painting, marbling, and gilding; if the waUs were bulging, gaping, and tottering, and the rain beating on the cushions and hassocks; if anything v;hatever wera lacking to the usual order of the service, and on inquiry it were found to be owing to the refusal of Church-rates, that would be some reasen against extending and regularizing such a state of things. At least, it would be a reason for stopp;ng to consider what substitute could be found. The abolitionist would be met at once with the exclamation, " What I would you have our beautiful " old churches fall to ruin ?" The fact, however, is, that it makes no difference to the churehes whether rates are collected or not. Pass from I street to street, or, if you have a turn for spiritual vagrancy, enter as many churches as you please on a Sunday, and you wil not be able to infer anything as to the source of the sufficient and *ometimes rather profuse expenditure of which you see such pompous and glittering proof. You cannot guess whether it is a rate, or a general subscription, or an estate, or pew-rents, or the liberality of the incumbent, or of some other individual. So our churches rill not go to ruin in this metropolis, or arywhere else, that we know of. Indeed, there is no substantial difference in this respect between the present state of the law, according to recent decisions, and entire abolition. If the majority of a vesiry refuse to authorize a rate, it can no longer be levied from a reluctant householder; in other words, it becomes a voluntary subscription. Church-rates mayhavebeen levied in tbat parish by quiet and undisputed preseription for five hundred years, but without a majority of the vestry they can be levied no longer. This is not only possible, but a matter of daily occurrence. What, then, wiU become of the churches ? WiU "they be allowed to faU down? Are they to be "left to the ravages of time till the roofs fall in, "till grass grows in the aisles, -winds burst the " windows, aud the frost split% the walls?' For the answer to such pathetic ineoiries we have only to refer to the next parishl or the next town, or perhaps all the parishes ia the neighbourhood, where the churches atr kept in capital order by voluntary payments. The only pretente $s delay is the hope of devising wlsb ii call, a, "-substitWa' for Churchratcs, The natural and only substitute is found alrefdy in more than half this metropolis, and in mot other large towns, where church people, so far from being at any loss for means to keep their churches in substantial and decorative repair,' Are everywhere competing for the honour oi doing so, and thinking it hard to bo denied. Al other substitutes are mere tempozingempedients, suggested by a weak hope of retaiming the impost, if not generally, at least in the rural parishes. Yet those rural parishes are the very ones in which the Church has the least to hope from compulsory rates, and the most from private tatr and generosity. Of all the parishes in the kingdonti it is least worth standing out for the supposed benefit of those -where the wretched impost, after discharging a few fees, just pays the parish brikldayer, the "Cmasoner," the carpenter, the piumiber, and the glazier their 10s. Gd. or 5s. 9d. a-piece. She great bulk of the rates is collected in certain towns and large parishes where the church and the gentry are strong, or 'where there are many professionals or old-fashioned tradespeople. Of course, this is a comparatively pleasant state of things, for till a man feels any positive scruple as to Churchrates, or any hearty dislike of the system, he would rather there was no dispute on the subject. But to the best of our belief, whether the parish be rich or poor, populous or otherwise, town or country, it is an equal waste of labour and good churchmanship to stand out for this tax. No case can be imagined in which the fabric may not safely be left to the generosity of churchgoers. Here and there a church may get out of repair, but that' will be nothing new. Most churches were getting continually out of repair the greater part of the last century, when Church-rates were undisputed. If the fabrics are now generally in beautiful order, it in owing to voluntary subscriptions. lt is the peculiarrity of this impost that it has never even been adapted to the growth and changes of our social system. The Church-rate is still paid to the parish church, and to it alone, though it is no longer able to contain half, or a tenth, or even a hundredth of the whole population. It is still paid, or demanded, for the parish church, though there is another church,. or, may be, twenty other churches, in the parish; and, while these other churches are maintained by their pew-renters or some liberal landowners, those same pew-renters and landowners are held legally liable to pay rates to the "parish church." There is no country in the world, except England, where such an extortion would be endured for a twelvemonth; just as England is the only country under the sun where two hundred thousand people would endure to be prohibited from marrying in their own churches, and compelled to frequent one alone for this purpose, simply and solely to make a piece of preferment for the Dean and Canons of St. Paul's. We talk in this country of emperors, of priests, of inquisitors, of wooden idols, and other stupidities and cruelties, but there are certain impostures, of the vested interest class, which grow nowhere else to so venerable an age and such magnificent dimensions as in this green old island. Church-rates, in their present capricious, unjust, and incorrigible form, illustrate this popular weakness of our taxpaying race. Of course, if people would go on paying them for ever, then, on the principle that role7ti non fit injutria, we should have no right to interfere. But people do very naturally object to paying for a thing they don't like when they are no longer obliged to do so; to paying to a church they don't go to, besides paying for one they do go to; to paying for a church three iniles off, or where they cannot get a comfortable seat. As the law is now stated, nobody need pay a Church-rate under these circumstances unless a majority of his neighbours lay their heads together and resolve that he shall pay it, whether he likes it or not. There are not many parishes in the kingdom, we should imagine, where a majority cam be got together for such a purpose; but it is better, at least more in accordance with the rest of our institutions, that a man should not be placed at the mercy even of his neighbours. It is quite possible that a vestry may even now think it either doing GOD's service, or at least very good sport, to screw a Church-rate out of people with churches or chapels of their own ; so, to provide against that bare possibility, Parliament should finally dispose of the question.
Three hundred millions of money, at the very least, have been invested in the Railways of this country. There are thousands of men still living wvho can recollect when the whole Xational Debt of the kingdom, though then considered incredible, was but 240 millions, and even now the figures symbolizing railway property represant an amount equivalent to one third of our prodigious State obligations. Now, when it is aserted-no doubt with substantial accuracy-that the average profit upon these investments in this tranquil, prosperous, and well-governed country is only 31. 12s. 4d. per cent., and that of all the Railways established and at work three only have their shares quoted av a premium, nobody will deny that the proprietors, if not an illused, are certainly an unfortunate body; nor are we in the least degree disposed to wonder or complain at the agitation which they seem to be preparing, and wivich they inaugurated at the mretropolitan meeting reported in our col-umns of yesterday. There is no need for expatiating on the " widow's annuity" or the " orphan's patriCC mony," or any other particular investment appealing with special force to public sympathy. All this is comprised in the bare mention of the aggregate at stake. Bundreds of millions could not possibly be subscribed without the destinies of thousands of families being involved in the success of the venture. It is equaUy manifest that in the security and productiveness of such a mass of property the interests of every individual in the community must be more or less concerned. Nobody can doubt the reality or magnitude of the evil; the only question is as to its cause, and as to the remedy which can be most hopefully applied. We can readily excuse the splenetic force of expression in which the sufferers depict what they consider their griovaaces, and in some respects their protests are undoubtedly well founded. It was certainly hard upon railway shareholders that they should be visited at once both with legislative control and iurestrieted competition. From one, at least, of these conditions they xiight have expected to be spared. When the State grants a monopoly it should, of course, see to some equity of dealing between the monopolists and the public; but, when it leaves these dealings to find their level by the natural operations of trade, direct intervention assumes a grtuitous and oppressive aspect. Railway Shareholders complain that legislation, which controls their proceedinga, regulates their prices, and limias their profits, should also expose them ta the risk of being undersold by competing lines, and their expostuilations are so far reasonable enough. It cannot be denied, in fact, that our whole policy in these railway transactions would have admitted of incaleulable improvement if we could have brought the experience of 1857 to the deliberations of 1845. Money might have been saved iz all quarters alike, proprietors might have bad hoavier profits, passengers better accommoodatiua at lower rates, and the country at large a |Peater arnount of benefit.. In justice, hoew aZver, tQ 411xQ statesmen and legislatoa or thoe days, it must be renZembered that I the question was entirely new, while the fault charged to their account amounts, .qfter all, to little more than an omission of controi over those very bodies who now complain of the results of freedom. It is not fair to say that the extravagance of enterprise and competition was the immediate 'wesk of our rulers; these elements of mischief 'were supplied by the speculators themselves, andl alt that the Government neglected was the restrictfen of this exuberance within what, as is now discovtred, would havo been more salutary bounds. Yet i] is by no means improbable that if a policy of repzessilon had been actually adopted it would have been held, accountable for all the mishaps and deficiencies afterwards experienced, and the late Sir RoB=u- PkEa might be denounced perhaps at this very moment as the arch-obstructor of railway developmentin, ?giand. As regards the minor grievances alleged on behalf of Railways there is not quite so much to be said. If they are he-vily rated for the relef of the poor, it must at any rate be plain after recent discussions that there is plenty of other property in the same case. If they -re undersold by the Post-office in the parcel-carrying department, the fact is only an unavoidable incident in the progress of public accommodation. The Post-office has a machinery pervading every quarter of the kingdom with its ramifications, and to expect that this machinery should be withheld from the service of the public in order thatRailwaysmighthavemoreparcels to deliver at such stations as they touch is utterly preposterous. Still more injudiciouswas the complaint that companies should be charged so heavily for their dealings with the lives and limbs of HExn MIAjsT's subjects, while, as regards the limitation of profits so feelingly put forth, if the course is clear up to 10 per cent., and the average performance at present is under 3S, there is surely scope for about as much expansion as can be anticipated just yet. However, we are not concerned to gainsay the assertion that Railways have here and there been hardly treated, and ceriainly we should rejoice to see this immense aggregate of property producing better returns and bearing a more becoming value in the market. But, after saying this much, we are bound to add, that a very considerable portion of the hardships alleged is traceable to the conduct of the companies themselves. In what respects, indeed-to go at once to the very marrow of the question,-have Railways disappointed their proprietors ? Certainly not in the amount of receipts, for, as regards the returns per mile from goods and passenger traffic, we doubt if there is a single line in the kingdom which has not exceeded the most sanguine estimates of produce originally formed. The public, then, have done aU and more than all their part in the way of encouragement; they have been most liberally forthcoming with their patronage and their money, and the only reason why profits are small is, that these returns are intercepted in their way to the pockets of the shareholders by the enormous claims which must be satisfied before any dividend can be declared. The simple truth is not that fares, as a general rule, have been pushed too low by competition-not that traffic has been abstracted by a carrying department of the Administration itselfnot that mailbags are conveyed at a loss-not, in short, that anything keeps money out of the railway tills-but that too many mouths have to be filed from the produce before the actual proprietors can come in for their turn. The receipts, in short, of Railway Companies are abundant, and would be remunerative enough in most cases, even after working expenses had been defrayed ;-what impairs tbe dividend is not the smallness of the divisible total, but the number of the divisors. And what created this hungry multitude? Why, the greed, the ambition, the conflicts, and the litigation of the companies themselves, which so swelled the capital on wbich interest was to be paid that even an unexpected fertility in returns has proved insufficient for the objects desired. There is another point, too, which cannot be passed over withouit destruction to the soundness of the whole argument. Why is it that property which, if not so productive as it ought to be, is at any rate producing upon an average between 3 and 4 per cent., should be quoted at such disproportionate prices in the share-market? Very likely 31. 12s. 4d. is too smal a rate of interest, but it is higher than Consols, and the security is only inferior in its character to terra firma itself. Nothing advanced at the meeting explained the ugly fact that of aU these numerous creations three only were quoted at a premium. This fact can be interpreted only by the indefinite distrust to which uncertainty gives rise, and this uncertainty in the public mind is due to the obscurity of railway accounts. Nobody knows the exact truth, and the want of knowledge has a worse effect than the truth could have, if it were ever so bad. Let the worst be known, and men will soon come forward to make it better, for this is proverbially the point at which things mend. Provided there was nothing behind the scenes-no mischief to come out by and by when aU was thought to be overthe natural and unvarying elasticity of such property in a country like this would soon be reckoned upon to bring things round. The road to a rise in shares lies through a real and incontestable audit. In the main, the improvement of Railw ay property must rest with the shareholders themselves. If there are any points on which legislation presses them unfairly, they wiU have the good wishes of the public in agitating for redress, and, independently of such points, if the authority of Parliament can enable them in any way to act more effectively Lor their own relief, we trust that they may obtain the facilities desired. The aggregate and taxable wealth of the nation, as was observed at the meeting, is affected by the depreciation of funds so enormous, and the question assumes an importance truly imperial. But even Parliament itself cannot recall what is past, and the counterpoise is only to be found in good management and resolution. Let tbs companies first deal as liberally with the public as the public does with them; not stint their accommodation, not cut down tbeir working staff, not eurtail the very indulgences to which they are driven. If they are forced to carry a passenger 60 miles for 5s., they need not expose their ill-will and their caprice by charging 7s. 6d. for one-half of the identical diitance. Let them abstain of their own accord from slashing at each other's throats, and not pray tbe Legislature to maake them well-behaved by compulsion. Above all, let them look boldly into their own affairs, and give the public the benefit of their discoveries; and if they do this for themselves they will do more than " a strong Government and a wiUing " Parliament," and even " Lord PA.uisnrToN" himself, can ever do for them.
The Peers acted very wisely last might in referring the " Sale of Poisons Bill" ft a, Select Committee. When the Bi wps first published we at once stated our cs2nviction that in the form in which it reaclbd us it never could pass into law. It Vs preposterous to euact tbat, save under the protection of certificates to be oigned by ena-ions ofiioal persons and without other embanassing formalities, no person should be served with drugs whioh were declared to be P',isonous. Many of these poisons are among our most valuable remedial agents. Any pelrson might have been in the babit of taking one or more of th.e for years, not only with imnpuitl lwtg with advantag#, and yet tider the niew law, should he have sudde*dt 1en weized 'with a paroxysm of ilhi*t, ho must hare been denied the use of the ie1fle4 to ivhichl he had been accustomed. Such a conelusion was dletrly out of the question. This wag to rusb from the extreme of laxity to the extremeof prohibition. It is well clearly to fix before our fi:ds the real natuxs of the evil to be guarded agairrt before we enunciate the remedy. Now, how is itthatIe bulk of the poisonings occur? First, we have the numerous elass of poisnings by mistake-bhat is, through ther eareleunes or ignorance of drugfidts. or, stiU morw frequently, from the carelessnems or ignorance of their apprentices ancd assistants. Of this class of poisonings we will presently give a~ fearful instanc*. which occurred but the other day at Worcestul Seconeiy, we have poisonings from mistakes made by the persons who are supplied with mcediines, as when Eome poisonous lotion, for external Unse is inadvertently administered to the patient in place of the medicine which should hleve been really swallowed. Every year we hear of maysad occurrences of this kind. Thirdly, we haver the very nunerous class of intentional poisoning by isnorantpersons of the lowest class, who with extremely rae exceptions confine their operations to one or two poisons of the most obvious kind, such, as arsenic. Finally, we have a very small number ofpoisonngs effected by persons of considerable skiiD and intelligence-pro. fessional men, such as PArca.for instance,who can at pleasure procure poisons of the most sbtle and deadly character. It is obvious at a glance that operations of this last lid ea never be affected by the clauses of an Act of Parliament; these, therefore, may at once be dismissed from consideration. Misadventures of the second kind-that is, poisonings by mistake, as where the lotion is swalloweed in place of the draught,-are also in a, great measure beyond the reach of legislation. Some littie good may be effected by enacting that medicines for external application shall be supplied only in bottles of a peculiar shape, or, if in a solid form, in envelopes of a peculiar kind; but, in the main, liability to such error must and will always exist. The love of life implanted in the breast of each individual, and the netural affection of those around him, must constitute the best guarantee that such sad occurrences are reduced to a minimum. The chief ceuses, however, remain untouched -namely, poisonings through the negligence and carelessness of druggists and their assistants, and poisonings by ignorant people with homicidal intent, but with poisons whch are easy of detection. Against this last class of cases there were some precautionaryenactments in the late BiU which wcre well calcu7ated to answer their end. As the poisons which such persons commonly employ are well known and but few in number, it seems not very difficult so to discolour them that, without losing any of their properties for legitimate purposes, they could not without detection be employed to destroy life unawares. This is all very well; it i3 also well that when a country wench enters a chymist's shop, or more probably the shop of a village chandler, and asks to be supplied with any of the poi4ons named, stringent precautions should be taken to guard against abuse. Much may be done by legislation to stop this part of the evil, but stiU more good would be effected if the sale of poisons, and drugs generally, were confined to persons of ascertained capacity and abilty, who abould be held strictly answerable for aU transactions in their busines. At present any person may open a shop for poisons, but he must have a license before he can sell a quartern of gin. Now that medical matters are under discussion, it seems a pity that the case of the chymists and druggists should not also be taken into consideration. Their trade is almost, and might be made entirely, a liberal profession. It is not deemed a hardship that an attorney cannot practise without a certificate. Why should a chymist be allowed to dispense drugs aud poisons to the public, let him be never so ignorant and incompetent? If this were done we should hear less of those frightful incidents which we have placed first in order in speaking ef the causes of poisonings. Such an one took place at Worcester the other day. A child was killed in the following frightful manner :-A mother was in the habit of using whitelead to certain portions of her infant's body; she sent accordingly for a small quantity of whitelead to the shop of one of the principal chymists in the town. Arsenic was sent by mnistake. In the first instance this was the act of an apprentice; but on the second oeasion the master-a man named STRINGER-supplied the poison. It appeared that an ignorant lad, an apprentice, had filled the whitelead drawer with arsenic by mistake. The poor infant, of course, died in exeruciating agony. Now, we should be glai to dee in the new Bill some provision which would have made MIr. STRIIGER liable to very severe penal consequences for his own negligence and the negligence of his apprentice. The provisions of the present Bill are, however, too crude and ill-considered. The suhiect is one which pre-eminently requires the attention of the Lcgislature, but it is as well that it should be first carefully considered by a Select Committee.
THE FRziicN PAsAwTRY AND THE GovrRmENT. -The changes which have taken place in France since 1789 had thrown into the hands of the peasantry a large proportion of the land of the country. As every owner of land, whether of a large or of a small estate, has an equal vote, the peaantry hold an overwhelmirg majority in the franchice. The constitational monarchy had unwisely debarred this large class of the landholders of France from political power; but by that principle of society which seems to be one of the most deep-seated and irresistible conditions of political existenoe, no sooner were the existing institutions o; the country overthrown than the supreme power in the State reverted, as it were, to its source, m the owners of the soiL There, and there alone, the Government of the second ompire bas a basis; that is the main, if not the sole, condition of the present tranquil submission of France to a form of sovereignty which has annihilated every semblance of freedom; and the only claim to originality we cnn discover in, the fabric raised by the Emperor Napoleon IL is his discovery that a Government may be founded and maintained for a considerable period of time, by the sole support of the landedpeasantry,inspiteof the disaffection of the towns, the aversion of theupperranks, andtheridicleerndvittperation of the educated classes. The peasantry wvere roused by the exercise of universal suffrage to the conscioasuess of political power; but it would be a complete error to suppose that a wide diffusion of the franchise among that class of s'eiety tends to free government and liberal Drinciples. In France the result has b^en juEt thb reverie. VUable to, exercise that power by any direct machinery of their own, tbey delegatea it absolutely. and in tl:e most s;mple form, to one man; and they view without repugnance the uses which may be made of that powver against liberties and rights to which they are Strangers, provided their own independence and ascendancy be respected, and- their own prejudices and passions fttered by the head of the State.- .EsnIzg n &viso.

FOREIGN INTELLIGBNCB. ff±'.?AINV3.?. be foowing appeared in otr second edition of yes- | Merda:-1 I fRnom OIJ OWN COM.SPONDIM.) PARIS, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 3, 6 P.M. It is not yet decided who the candidates are who will come forward on the moderate Democratic intemest for Paris, but the list will be definitively pre1 ared between tLis and Sunday. As you are aware, tiere existed some difference of opinion about taking the oaths to the existing Government in case of the election of those candidates. It is expected that this difference will be arranged. Indeed, according to rational and practical men, it would be useless and absurd to ignore the fact that the Imperial Government, which has now been in existence for nearly six years, is subjected to and accepted by the nation; that it is the constituted Government, and, for the time, is as legitimate as any system in France can well be. The protest of tbe Liberal party against that Government was perfectly intelligible immediately after the cri,2 d'6tct, and before an appeal was made to the nation to sanction that abrupt and forcible overthrow of the existing Constitution. But after so long a period of acquiescence in a system which, whether for good or for evil, continues to be accepted, protests arel an anachlronism, and systematic abstinence from participation in the election of representatives can only damage the Liberal cause, and make [it forgotten by the nation. The example of the Legitimists shows the inutility and folly of such a policy: they so long refused to take any part in the business of the country that they are all but entirely forgotten. The voluntary abandonment of a cause is pretty much the avowal of weakness, and {he party which avows its weakness may be looked upon as defeated. The determination, then, of the more moderate of the Liberals to seek the suffrages of the electors, and, if elected, to present themselves to the Legislative Body, is judicious and politic. They may form the nucleus of an opposition which, unless extraordinary measures are taken to crush it in the beginning, wiU gradually become greater, and, even if it does not, will serve as a check on the reactionary tendencies of those 'who, though indebted for their present position to the Parliamentary system, belie their origin, and are more disposed to Absolutism than even the Emperor himself. It is doubtful wheter General Cavaignac will appear as a candidate, but it seems almost certain that, even if elected, he would decline taking the oath. General Cavaignao's case is exceptional. A man 'who occupied such a position in the coun.ry, and who was a candidate for the Presidency of the Republic, would, perhaps, consult his own dignity by abstaining altogether. The objection to making the occasion serve as a protest against the Government applies to him as forcibly as to any one else. Of the success of these candidates, either in Paris or in the other large towns where they may come forward, one cannot confidently say much. The more sanguine believe that the chances, at least in Paris, are in their favour. The names that are likely to be adopted are not such as would frighten the bourrgeoisie, and it is doing the Government no injustice to say that candidates of more advanced opinions among the Republican party would perhaps be preferred by it, inasmuch as the terror in which these men are held by the middle classes would lead to their rejection in favour of pure Ministerialists. It was stated some days ago that a meeting of avontes (attorueys), who had come up to Paris to the number of 300, was forcibly dispersed by the police. The facts are these .-Some short time since a proposition was made in the Senate the object of which was to reduce the legal charges of avouls, which are very onerous to tne public. The avouts purchase their business, some at a very high price, and are not always moderate in recovering their outlay. Be this as it may, they became much alarmed at the measure, which threatened to interfere with their profits, and a considerable number from various departments came up to Paris to remonstrate. They resolved to dine together at a restaurant in the Palais Royal, and during the dinner to discuss the question for which they had assembled. The eatinghouse-keeper became rather alarmed at receiving such a nu mber of guests, and declared he could not accommodate them without referring to the authorities. Reference was made to the authorities, permission was given, and the avonis discussed their viands and their business at the same time. It was agreed to select five of their number as a deputation to the Minister. The deputation was received by the Minister, who, I believe, said that the subject should be taken into consideration at the proper time. I doubt whether the avcns have returned to their departments much satisfied with that assurance; but sod the, matter stands for the present. Count de Morny is expected to arrive in Paris from St. Petersburg on the 2Bth inst. He will take up his quarters at the residlence of the President of the Legislative Body, where preparations are being made to receive him. A letter from Bagdad announces that Nerim Khan had quitted that town on the Bth of May, after the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty of3 peace with Great Britain, to return to Teheran, taking with him a copy of the treaty, intended for the Persian Government. M. de Thouivenel, the French Ambassador at Constantinople, -who was to have come to Paris on leave of absence, will not leave lis post, in consequence of the importance which the question of the Danubian Provinces has a3sumed. Accounts from Montenegro state that at an assembly of the inhabitants, held at Cettinye, Prince Daniel gave a long explanation of his Mournay and his expectations. He said that, the Russian Government having withdrawn the subsidy formerly allowed to him, he had addressed himself first to the Emperor of the French, and then to other Christian Powers, demanding aid and protection rom them-; and at last to the Sultan, who promised him more than any other Sovereign, viz., an extension of territory and facilities to trade with Scutari and other towns in Turkey. He added, that he was inclined to send commissioners to Constantinople to treat directly with the Sultan, and to secure by a treaty the future position of the country. He demanded of the Assembly whether they agreed with him on that point; but nobody replied, and there was a general silence. The Prince repeated his question, but no answer was given. A low murmur ran through the meeting. The Prince then dissolved the Assembly, declaring that he would do what he considered best for the interests of the country. The Grand Duke Constantine arrived at Calais at 7 o'clock on Monday evening in the Admiralty steamer Osborne. The Prince dined on board, and afterwards went into the town, where he passed the I night. He left yesterday morning at half-pasit 7 for Antwerp. At the request of his Imperial Highness, no honours were paid him at Calais, either on arriving or leaving. The Prince reached Mouscron at a quarter-past 101, Ghent at half-past 11, Malines at a quarter to 1, and Antwerp at 20 minutes past 1. The King and Royal Family of Belgium had arrived in that city from Brussels at 11 o'clock to receive him. His Majesty and their Royal Highnesses were welcomed with great enthusiasm by the townspeople, and the inhabitants of the neighbouring places, who had flocked into the town. The Duke de Brabant and the Count de Flandres went to the rail way sta- tion to receive the Russian Prince-the Duke wearing the Grand Cordon of the Order of St. Andrew of Russia. The Belgian Princes were accompanied by the provincial, communal, and military authorities, and Admiral Glasenapp, who has come from Kie], M. Sievers, Secretary of the Russian Legation at the Hague, Counit and Countess Anrepp, and M. de Thal, were also in waiting to receive the Grand Duke. His Imperial Highness, on arriving, was accompanied by M. de Richter, Minister of Russia at Brussels; M. de Petersen, Secretary of the Russian Legation at that city; General de Liem and Colonel d'Hanins de Moerkerke, attached to him by the King of the Belgians; Marshal Sabouroff; M. Golowine, Chamberlain; Colonel Greiy; Prince Ouchtomrski; and Dr. Haourowicz. The Grand Duke and the Duke de Brabant, after having presented to each other the persons by whom they were accompanied, entered with the Count de Flandres an open carriage, and proceeded towards. the Palace, on the Place de Meir, in the midst of acclamations. It was thought that the Grand Duke would remain at Antwerp till Thursday morning. The Palace not being large, and the suite of the King and the Princes amounting to no fewer than 78 persons, it was necessary to take apartments in hotels and private houses. The King, the Grand Duke, and the Princess Charlotte were lodged in the Palace, but the Duke ana Duchess de B3rabant and the Couat de Flandres occupied -.' -trents in the town. Several of the Court cax.-. as had been sent on from Brussels on Monday. Mr. Stevens, British Consul atTeheran, arrived in Paris to-day from Bagdad, bringing with him the lreaty of peace ratified at Teheran on the 14th of April last. Dr. Milman's well-known tragedy of Fazio, translated into Italian verse by 31. Dall' Ongaro, the translator of Racine's Ph&dre, wil be played this year in London by Madame Ristori, and next season in Paris. The Moniteur publishes two despatches to Marshal Vaillant, Minister of War, from Marshal Randon Governor-General of Algeria. The first is merely' a collective account of the affair of the 24th ult., but adds little to the accounts already given in the despatches of the generals commanding the different divisions. The second, dated from the camp of Ighill Guifri, May 27, is as follows:- " Monsieur le Mar6chal,-The vigorous resistance made by the enemy to the movement of our troops on the 24th led us to expect that the Kabyles would make a ni ht attack, but our outposts were so strongly intrenched tata all attempts on their part wore fruitless. The firing recommenced in the morning of the 25th, when numerous contingents marched from the Souck-el-Arba and boldly attacked the advanced posts of the division of General M'Mahon, but they were driven back at the point of the bayonet with heavy loss. General Renault in the morning of the 20th marched a part of his troops on the villages of Ait-Hag, Ait-Janak, Ibachiren, and Ait-Halli, situate on the right of his camp, and the holders of which kept up a warm fire of musketry on his posts. The Kabylea were all driven out, and at noon the firing had ceassed on almost all the positions. At this mooment were seen towards Souok-el-Arba a body of at least 3,000 Kabyles retiring in all directions, after having exchanged shots with the inhabitants of several villages, who, at the instigation of our former Caid, had declared for us. A short time after envoys from the tribe of the BeniRaten came to make overtures of submission, and asked a truce of 24 hours, which I granted. On the afternoon of the 26th the representatives of all the fractions of the tribe of the Beni-Raten came to my tent, wishing to submit. They have accepted without hesitation all the conditions which I have prQposed. This submission was immediatelr followed by that of the Arb-Donela, who strugged vigozously against us during the last autumn. I have reason to believe tbat other mountain tribes who have been hitherto opposed to vs will soon follow the exhanple of the Beni-Raten and the Arb-Donela. While waiting for these probable results, and which will be facilitated by the presence of our troops in the formidable positions which they occupy, Iam causing the interior of the country to be examined, and shal fix on the direction of the roads to be constructed in order to unite Tizi-Ouzon to the posts which will be established on these mountains. The health of the troops is excellent, and we receive our supplies without any difficulty. " accept, &c., " RANDON."

Although firmness is one of the most prominent features in the character of the Emperor. Francis Joseph, he is greatly afflicted at the loss of his little daughter, and reproaches himself for not having followed the advice of the Archduchess Sophia, his mother, which wgas that the two little girls should be placed under her care during the Hungarian Journey. The grief of the bereaved mother is also very great, hut persons who have seen HEer Majesty since her return say that she displays truly Christian resignation. After the death of the little Archduchess the Emperor and Empress expressed to the physicians their conviction that everything which human skill could devise had been done to save their child, and kindly thanked them for their care and attention. The Emperor. has such a strong sense of his duties as a monarch, that his official advisers have not yet been able to persuade him to relinquish his idea of returning int a fortnight or three weeks to HEungary, in order to complete his tour. His Majest-y came from Laxenburg to Vienna yesterday, and was closeted for nearly two hours wtith his Ministers. While at dinner at Jasz-Bereny on the 23d their Majesties admnitted to their presence an elderly woman, who had sent in word that her daughter had just been delivered of a son. The old lady was ambitious that her grandchild should have an Emperor for its godfather, and the request which she made to that effect was readily granted. Baron von Anguss acted as the deputy of His Majesty, whose present to his godson wtas 20 du.cats (between 9l. and 101.) The behaviour of the UJltramontane party in BRelgium is cal¢ulated to convince even the most incredalouts that my so repeatedly expresaed suspicions as to the intentions of the Court of Rlome are well founded. The I'apal See has its agents spread over the whole civilized world; and there are no more deadly enemies to political liberty than the IJltramontanists. The Jesuits are indefatigable in their efforts to obtain the confidence of the high and mighty in this empire, and it must he confessed that they are successful in nine cases out of every ten. Their schools-and they have nort several in Austria-are cleverly conducted, and everything is done by the astute fathers to put a high external polish on the young nobles who are intrusted to their care. The yOUng people are taught all kinds of " accomplishments," but care is taken that they shall have no opportunity of acquiring overmuch real knowvledge. The Porte has forwarded a " Memoir " to its diplomatic agents at the European Courts, in which the necessity for some change in the " capitulations" (treaties) between Turkey and the Christian Powers is demonstrated. The Porte remarks that it cannot properly maintain public peace and security in the empire so long as each separate legation and consulate has a right of jurisdiction. lt may be observed that diplomatists wfho had passed many years of their lives at Constantinople have assured me that the system of which the Tulrkish Governmnent nowr complains is not only a very bad one, but an indirect encouragement to all kinds of vagabonds to make the Turkish capital the scene of their rascalities. It is said that the greater part of the murders committed at Constantinople are perpetrated by natives of the Ionian Isles. The Emperor is said to have declared that, if necessary to an adequate enlargement of the city, the whole or part of the walls shall be rased. Ii the matter is judiciously managed, the Emperor may have one of the finest capitals in 13urope, but, as it now is, Vienna is a second-rate city, and in many respects much inferior to Berlin. TPhere is not a decent theatre in the town, and not a single covered market-place. Mr. Stevens, the British Consul at Teheran, rode all the way from Bagdad to Constantinople, which may be a distance of about 1,300 English miles. PRUSSIA. (oMX ocRi OWNc CORRESPONDEN.) BERLIN, JuVE 2. In my yesterday's letter I mentioned that the bureaucracy of this country will he the greatest obstacle which the Evangelical Alliance will meet with here in its endeavours to promote its admirable views. The bureaucracy is the entire over 60,000 persons, and comprising all the most educated men in the country. The State which they serve is a minutely organized ard carefully articulated polity, * all the parts and functions of which harmoniously correspond with and work into each other, as pinion does into wheel and cog into cog in a well-regulated machine. Of this body politic the Church in Prussia is only a department, forming a portion of the business intrusted to the Minister of Public Worsbip, to whose province also belong educational and medical matters. Of the Church department in this Minister's office the Evangelical Church forms a somewhat larger section, the Roman Catholic a somewhat smaller section, corresponding to the relative numbers of their adherents-10,500,000 and 6,500,000. Over and above the legislative and administrative bodies in the State, there is also an executive force called the police, Iwhose office it is to see that everybody, obeys all the laws in every case made and provided, and which is equally a check and control over the public at large and over the administrative bodies 'The way in which this system works in church matters is this :-Every child, as soon as it is born, must be announced to the local police authorities of the district, who enter it provisionaUy, a3 an anonymous male or female child, to the debit of its parents, for whom, together with all their olen and servants, an account was opened in the local police ledger at the time they first-moved into that district. That account contains the following headivgs, required to be fiUed up:-Names, ages, reUigion, calling, and last address (I believe it isno longer necessary to recite who has and who has nothad the smallpox, nor who has been vaccinated andwhonot). This provisional entry of the new-born chi!d is for the purpose of enabling the police to see that the parents take their child to be baptized within the specified time. When this sacrament has been administered, and the infant is thus officially introduced into some one of the legally recognized church communities, notice must again be given to the police of the fact, together with the names of the child. Should no notice of the kind be given to- the police, these functionaries are -empowered to inquire of the parents whether the child has been baptized, and, if not, why not; and, in case no good reason can be assigned for the omission of that ceremony, to fine the. parents and take the child.by force to the font. This zeal for infant> baptism on the part of the police is, however, not exerted in msc*worem gloriari Domini, but as-a means of bringing every individual atom of the population duly and offi6aliy into some one -of the many religious subdivisions of that peculiar species of the genus homo known as KEniclier Preussischer Usierthan ; nor is the obligation to give notice of the child's baptism inflicted on the parents for the purpose of procuring accurate registers of the population, but, on the contrary, to enable the police to check the lists of christenings sent in by the clergy, the entry of which in the archives of the Consistories forms the real register of the popu-- lation. Thus the church registers, which form. the basis of al population andconfessional statistics, are checked and controlled by the police ledgers, and the accuracy of the latter are again tested by a census taken from house to house every three years, - and any stray atom of the population then found floating about without having been duly entered in the police ledgers while in awaddhng clothes is liaole to be punished for haYing thus dared to be born under such ilegal circumstances. From his earliest infancy the Prussian subject is introduced by church and police into some special religious community, from wYhich he cannot go out except by formal vwritten notice and declaration, which agaiu must also be recognized by churchandpolice,and in every other relation of life he is equally registered, classed, and specitied, and has his place assigned him in the great State museum. The influence of this system on the minds of the nation at large is to produce an intense spirit of caste, from the necessity every man is under of belonging to a class, a species, and a genus, ani making it difflcult for him to quit that position and take up another; in Russia and in China, where the system is still more perfectly carried out, the result is still more evident.- On the individual members of the bureaucracy, who have the best means of seeing how thoroughly, by this system, everything is brought under the action of the Government machine, the influence produced is an inordinate worship of organic and minute government, and a rampant spirit of red tape.g The movement going on just now in the Church of Prussia tends to enhance and exaggerate both these spirits of caste and red tape. The mild and tolerant spirit of the " union," or confluence of Lutherans and Calvinists, introduced by the late King, and assiduously promoted by the present one, never had so many opponents as now. Lutheranism, which possesses by far the largest number of adherents in this country, is promoted by the Minister of Public Worship himself, by such prominent men of the Kre4uz Zeitvng party as have any religious convictions, and by the whole body of Pharisees in the Church itself. Its spirit is that of repulsive intolerance; its system of administration (the consistorial) is red tape in its most stringent form; and its ritual an ossification of mediseval formality-what Puseyism would be, deprived of its painting, music, and flowers. Now, the Evangelical Alliance runs totaUycounter to all these tendencies; it asks all Protestants to throw aside for the nonce their distinctive caste, and to liberate themselves from the knots of red tape, to enter into a common bond of fellowship on the basis of the Gospel, and to cooperate together for the spread of truth and religious liberty. These views, which the very cogs of the Prussian state machine admit to be " all very well" in the abstract, are, nevertheless, looked upon by them, when about to be -acted upon, with aversion and disgust, as totally useless and uncalled for, destructive of all good government, and subversive of order in Church and State. They are affected towards them with the same feelings as the zealous curator of a museum of conchology would be by a demand being made upon him to let all his univalves and bivalves, his heteropodas, cephalopodas, gasteropodas, and all the other podas, relinquish their glas cases, their wooden divisions, and their pasteboard partitions, to vindicate their position in creation simply as shells; being men rather of microscopical minuteness than of large and sweeping ideas, they look on the projected meetings of tl;e Evangelical Alliance as mere disorder. This apprehension of things is aggravated by the circumstance that the Evangelical allies will come hither from all 2orts of countries, " devout men out of every nation under Heaven," owaing other allegiance and placed under other Ministers of Public Worship, and over whom the President of Police will have no control; and the various foreign languages that must necessarily be spoken on the occasion, the meetings, the discourses, and Divine worship that will be delivered in English and French, &c., suggest to them recollections of Babel rather than of Pentecost. The most liberal and exDansive among them think they have already attaiied the fullest scope of perisible latitudinarianism in the hargelischer Eirchentag, or Diet of Protestant Churches, where al the Churches represented are organic bodies like the Prussian Church, standing each of them duly under its Minister of Public Worship, with its printed articles of faith, &c.; but the Evangelical Alliance they look upon as an unuorganic body, and as such to be keDt aloof from a well-ordered polity. Among the various religious communities represented in the Evangelical Alliance are some that have no church government at all, no hierarchy, no Minister of Public Worship, no printed confession of faith; and there is one even that repudiates infant baptism. Now, although the Church in this country lays no particular stress upon infant baptism as an essential to salvation, the State and the police require the practice as an indispensable to statistics and to civil and church government; a sect, therefore, that inculcates the propriety of adult baptism is to the Prussian bureaucrat the vehicle of Radical and revolutionary tendencies, subversive of all order and government, civil and religious. It must also be borne in mind, with reference to the participation in the Evangelical Alliance of many different denominations, that for the last 20 or 30 years political malcontents in Germany have always chosen some specious form of religious separatism as a mask for their meetings and a vehicle for the diffusion of their principles. In thus endeavouring to put your readers into possession of the way of thinking and feeling that obtains here on the subject of the Evangelical Alliance, I hope to assist its promoters in eliminating every stumbling-block and stone of offence in the wray of our brother Protestants on the continent, for the sake of the great andgood cause they have at heart. The time wrill comne ere long when this continental system of minute and all-coiprehensive government must be relaxed or rejected altogether, and this change may be looked for first in Prussia, because it is there that the system is nearest to thorough perfection. It is the peculiarity of the repressive, restrletive, al-regulating systems, that when they have attained their fullest develop iment they must needs be abandoned if the country is to be saved ; in this country, for instance, ever7 movement of elasticity is already crushed out of it by the minute meshwork of Government and police measures that enthrall it, and which will, sooner or later, totally stifle it, if not judiciously relaxed. Liberty of thought already exists here, but not the entire liberty of disseminating thought. Liberty of religion exists also, as a matter of conscience, bi.t not as a liberty of public worship, that being an overt act, and, like every other act, good or bad, subjected to the surveillancoe of the police.

This has been s6ttling-day in the English: funids, and thle course of theinarket has plainly indicated that the speculation- for a rise which has so long been carried on at exorbitant rates of interest is atill far from having been brought Within narrow limits.

The fall yesterday is stated to have been caused by a forced closing of some of the accounts of needy speculators.

HEALTH OF BouLoGw.-The following is extracted from a letter dated Boulogne, May 28.-" AtthIr approach of the bathing season it may be as well to reassure intending visitors as to the sanitary condition of thls favourite plce of resort, and to contradict any unfavour. able impressions which may still remain from last year. The alarm that was caused by the appearance at Boulogne of that severe form of sore throat which had previously shown itself at Paris and many other points in the north of France, and has since appearod in several other places, is too well known for any injury to ba done to the locality by referring to it. Bat statistics now show, what, of course, could not be known at the time, that it was very far from prevailing to the extent that was at one moment inferred from a few nnfortnnate instances to which general attention became directed. On the other hand, since last summer the exertions of the municipality have been strenaously and unremittingly engaged oiz the improvement of the sanitary condition of the locality; and the favourable rtsdlt of these exertions is pToved by the present low rate of mortality, which is considerably under the average. I am assared that for several months past therehave been no cases of infantine febrile disordors at Boulogne beyond those isolated instances which occur from time to time in every centre of population, and arise, not from any local cause, but from t every nature of thnu and that in this respect the health of Boulogne during the past winter can be advantageously compared with that of several of the neighbouring towns. The mortality during the present year, 1857, has amounted to 315 from the 1st of Jannary to the 26th of May, being at the rate of 755 deaths a-year; while in 1856 there were 986 deaths, 384 of whiob occorredbetween the lstof January and the26thof May. The mortality of 1855 exceeded that of 1856. It is clear, then, that the mortality has been diminishing for some years past, 'While a still more satisfactory assurance is found from compang it to the population, which,Talthough estimated at 34,739 by the last census, is believed to amont to 40,000. The medic men of Boulogne are unanimous in stating that at this moment the public health is in a satisfactory condition, and one in accordance with the reputation the locality has always enjoyed for saxlubrity. I think it is only a matter of justice at the opening of the bathing season to giveothose interested in Boulogne an opportunity of stating the truth regarding its sanitary condition, and thus removirgB impressions which, if not corrected, might exercise an nnfayouxble influeaioe on the numrbet of vitrs,"

If the steamboat company had been indemnifiloar aiffi lpos, it was of sufficient consequence to them to ask r mpn,tio* on the subject. The CHArranm believed thatthe arrnment with the stamboat company must be beneficial to the GreatW estern Company. It wassimilarto that ent,ered into betweeji the Gre&t Western, South Wales, and other railway companies, ;and the proprietors of steamboao runningbetween s lford Haven and Waterford. He wasnot then inadpodtion to exlain the nature of the agreement, but it should be laid fuly ybefore the proprietorsatthe anet meeting. Several shareholders expresied their proval of as' arrangement that wouid have the effecth ouplducing hnsu-f stallest possible losg totheomplofy. They maintined that unless smch arragements produced profit to the compniy they should be considered As entailingloS& so.u A Sci A t aormste stated thatt subhebritions hIad beenr entered into at Weynmonth, Guernsey, an 3Tersey to ecsta. bush steamboate between those, oplaceh, and ltb was believed by the inhabitancus and others Ahat it would not only he highly beneficn to tabse pbem by bringing thela into conmexion with the north -of england, buet also to the dGreat Westem Company, over whose lines the traffic would be conveyed.

Lord BAet red ROX secnaea thtm e motion. The Secretarye at the request of the meeting, explained the nature of themrrangement with the steamboats between tWeyamouth and the ChaQlilane rds. There as o agun- ranteo-it was precisely on the "ame principle as that be tween the Grett Westerl amdt South Wales Baiwaysiand the proprietors of the'ibean6s plying between ,xnfor-d and Waterforda Oterh arties the erve -ev ; boats and paid th o expenses of working tiem.wOut of the -traffic thus produced the railways took one part, and the boats the other, accord. eng to a rieag wirate. Butincae theexpenses oftheboats shouln exceed their propoteion of the receipts, where being atrearrangement every two months,d the Great Wesekrg would have to deliver up.s a rtion of the mileage rate to which they were entitled *AM so would the outb. Wales Company, to knt e good the deficiency,- if any, in respect of workig the boas, but every -re wastakento avoid thpossibityof a loss. The object of thearrangement waor to bring new trffic over the line, traffecewhich would not otherwise come. The traffic referred to,.which ws brought ovter the South Wales line ia consequence of the establishment of hosts from Mnlford to Waterford, would not exist if there were no boats.e If, therefore, they could obtain A particular traffic by.nproviding facilities for it at no risk or cost to the compaany, i wa their duty, and for the advantage of the company ithnat such arrangements shouldy be entered into. The directors nust be in a position to make those arrangements, uwnlessit be the uwsof the proprietors that those efforts should not asc made to inrduce ngwtraffce on thejlineo and develope the resources of the company. If there were no boats ranning between Weymouth and the Channel Islands to induce traffic from the Great Wester in t'he north, east, and west over the line to Weymoi t, they would have nope of that particular traffic. The people of-Jersey, Guernsey, anda Weynmouth w WeymouthS reogreatly interested in the success o their effbrtsh, and it was considered a just thing they should sub- rib towards the establishment of the beats. If therir no boats they would have had none of that particular traffic, because it would flow in another direction. Every e xectstion that had been entertainedawith regard to the Weymouth troafc had been realized. The boats filled well, Wemouth was r filed to overflowing, and those who could not be accommodated at Weymouth went by the boats to theo Channel Is ds. He bcdieved it was atheish of the proprietors that the traffic should be developed, and It was be cang done by the directors in every way. Every agreement was entered into withethe utmost cautiontoeAvoid liabilities, except tothe extent of the profit from any spe yalitem of traffc He could tell them thaat the Weymouth agreement was one of the mnost productive agreements they-had, and the success of the Wilts and Weymouth line depended upon suchmannrangements. The claussrelatig to the permissive powers for working the Dartmouth and Torbay linie were then rea, and a. fo.rmal resolution approving the .Bil was carried. Formal resolutionsapproving four other Bl for makng railways between Bstol and the South Wales Rail'ay, with a steam ferry across the river Sevem2; for makng the Stratford-upon-Avon Railway; for makdna rail way fom thoe Lantriisant station of the South 59e R wyt Penrliwfer, with brnches; andfrom the I-anidloS and Newtown Railway to the to.n of .rac.ynlleth, were sub mitted consecutively, discussed ,and aftr satisfactory expla nations assed Unanimously. The clauses in the B,is affecting the Great Wesn Com- pany were of a permissve character, enabling workin, : arrangements to be enteredl into, subject to the approval of the Boardl of Trade, and three-fifths of the shareholcders represented at meetings of the repective companies specially convened for the purpose. No working agreement was to erce ealo years' duration writhout permission of the Boar~d of Tr-ade. The CssAmmxr then submitted two agremenits for working the Bridport and Stratford-u]?on-AvonRailways at cost price for two years, the respective companies main- taining the rmanent way, and the Great Wester providing the ro?gstock andlworking the traffic, allowance being-made for depreciation of engines, repairs, and interest of capital invested in the rolling stock. Mr. SAMi4DES fully explained the nature and policy of such agreements; they were intended to encourage local parties to make branch lines at their own expense, without calling upon the Great Western for any pecuniary ainistance. By working those branches at a lower rate than the parties could possibly work them the comapany secured the traffic for the main line. Resolutions confirming the agreement were passedI Unanimously. Mr. ALAijaxs expressed satisfaction at the explanations vo ytechairman andl secrtary with regard to the afiaragments. A. Pnornsnron thought the discussion that had takeon place would do a gret dea of good.

The following witness was thez called venr.stylr mth ao phyIsician, resiaing in Upper Gros. Mienor -stet 0n te1th of July I was cslle& upon by Mr.Cambell,andaskedabyhim to see his wife. I went to the nnade Hotel and saw Mrs Campbell. Her ilness was supposed tohave arisen from a miscarriage. Mr. Campbell met me there. He went up to her room with me. Mrs. Campbell was occupying one room. She was very excitable and, very weak. I could notl say whether she was sane. Icommunicated my opinion to Mlr.Campbell. Isawher twice afterwards. I made arrangements to meet Mr. Campbell at the hotel. I recommended that she should go to some quiet lodgings, and have her children with her. Mr. CampbeU assented to that proposition. I recommended a nurse to Mr. Campbell, at his request. I never saw anything pass between mr. and Mrs. Campbell beyond his inq'uries con. cerning her health. I subsequently saw Irs. Campbell at Hampstead. The conclusion I came to with regard to Mrs. Campbel was that, although her brain had been a little affected in consequence of her miscarriage, yet she was then perfectly sane. Cross-examined.-I nm accustomed to attend patients who are suffering in their mind from childbearing and miscarriages. I understood from Mrs. Campbell that she had been insensible for a fortnight after her miscarriage. That is a usual occuxrence. Mr. Campbell had been told by anotber medical gentleman that Mrs. Campbell's brain was affected. I don't know that Mr. Campbeli was living in the house. Mr. CampbeU did not forgive his wife in my pre. sence. I don't exactly know what legal condonation is. I beard that Mrs. CampbeU was given to drinking, but I saw nothing like it. Her weakness might have caused those suspicions. I gave her steel. That is given in cases of insanity arising from weakness. She required stimulants. I saw her once at Porcheater-terrace. Mx. Campbell asked me to go and see his wife - that was on Thursday, the 26th of June. My impression is that Ir. CampbeU was not living at Porchester-terrace. I saw no children there. A Dr. Jefferson, living in the neighibeurhood, was there. We understood that she had undergone great excitement a day or two previously, and a question was raised as to whether she was pregnant or not. She was not pregnant at The LoRD CnXtoEOR then requested the petitioner to stand at the bar. The LoRD (.¶NmmoR .-We understand that you sent your wife and chi!dren to England before you returned yourself. What was your reason for doing so? Mr. Campbell.-Mrs. Campbel preferred to come home in Captain Green's vessel, and she also wished to arrive in' England before her confinement. If she had stayed forme she must have been confined on board ship, which she hada great objection to. The LORD CHAziCELLoR.-After your return we understand that you had reason to suspect your wife had been unfaithful to you. How came you to go to the Colonnade Hotel to see her ? Mr. CampbelL-I received intelligence that my wife was staying there, and my partner camo to me and said that she wanted an allowance. I said I would not allow her anything, but my solicitor subsequently told me that I must support her until I obtained a divorce. I then went to the 'Colonnade Hotel to see her, and request her to go to her brother-in-law's house. Her nephew was present at the time, and upon my making that proposition to her she refuNed it. I then called up the proprietor of the hotel, and in his presence I said that would not be answerable for any debts she might incur. Afterwards it being suggested to me that the unhappy event might have arisen from insanity, I went up to her aain, and told her I would pay what debts she had incurred. I saw her afterwards, but always in the presence of one person or another. She made an attempt upon my life two days after my return, on the occasion of my reproving Mr. Garston for making her so strong a glass of brandy and water. I first discovered my wife's caiminality on the 21st of June, and since that period I have neither slept, eaten, nor drunk in any house where she was. Mr. MAcQu?Ex said that, although he was not aware of any instance wheresucha roceednghad been adopted, yet he was instructed to Fay that, if it was their Lordships' pleasure to examine Mrs. Campbell, she was perfectly ready to be sworn. The LORD CHANCELLOr said that such a thing had never been done. He thought they could not hear Mrs Campbell. i At the request ot their Lordships, Mr. Campbell produced a copy of the marriage settlement, by which it ap eared that Mr Campbell, as Air. Campbell's widow, would bave been entitled to certain property. Mlr. MAcQuExysaid that their Lordships would not surely annul that settlement. The LoRD CHANCELLOR said that the parties must agree upon some clause to be iuserted in the Act to secure lrs. Campbell her rights under that settlement, in case she shoaid survive Mr. CampbelL Mr. 'W YLDE then shortly addressed the House upon the evidence which had been given in support of the petition. The LORD CsAcxLLOR said that it was unnecessary in the present case to defer the second reading of the Bill for the purpoEe of having the evidence printed, as the evidence tendere in support of the petition was such as in his opinion clearly made out the petitioner's claim for relief. The only question of importance which had arisen after the adultery had been satisfactorilyproved was whether Mr. Campbell had condoned the offence his wife and the adnlterer had been guilty of. In his (the Lord Chancellor's) opinion Mr. Campbell, SD far from condoning hai wife's ence, had acted almost harshly. Under these circumstances he should advise their Lordships to read the Bill a second time and give the petitioner the relief he sought. Baron WENSLEYDALE havingconeurred, The BiU was read a second time accordingly.
LAW AEPO)?r. COURT OF CRANYRV TTT-T.'O,-T- T LISTERR V. T.EA' (Before te IaRDn. JTTTRyWQ .f A - . I Thlis was an appeal from a, deciion- of Vice-Chancellor wood. The plaintiffs in the suit filed a bil to restrain the infringement of a patent which they claimed as theirs for valuable processes for wool-combing. After the institution of the sutt the plaintiffs disclaimed a portion of their invention. In July, 1856, his Honour, in order to save expense to all parties, permitted the plaintiffs to withdraw their replication and to amend the bill, they paying to the defendants all the costs up to tha-t time. Tne defendants received the costs and the plintiffs amaended their bilL. An action was tried and a verdict was returned in favour of the plaintiffs, and thereupon they moved for a perpetual njunction. By the 39th section of the statute of the 15th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 83, it is enacted that no action shall be brought upon any letters patent in which any disclaimer shalU have been filed in respect of any infringerhent committed prior to the filing of such disclaimer. When the order of July, 1856, was made this clause of the statute was not present to the mind of the learned judge, and was not brought to his recollection, or at that time the bill must have been dismissed in lieu of the order he made being pronounced. On the 6th of May last the Vice-Chancellor made an order, by which he gave the plaintiffs leave to dismiss their bill without costs, and without prejudice to their right to file a new Bill. From this order the defendants appealed, on the ground that it was contrary to the settled practice of the Court to permit a plaintiff to dismiss his bill, unless upon the condition of paying the costs. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, insisted shat as the course pursued was in consequence of the learned judge not adverting to the prohibition of the 39thclause of the statute when he made the order of July, 1856, the case fell within the rule that where a plaintiff is led into an erroneous course by a mistake of the Court, or by a decision which after the institution of his suit is reversed, he may dismiss his BDllwithout costs. Mr. W. IL James and Mr. Fischer were for the appellants; Mr. Rols and Mr. Fooks supported the order of the Vice-Chancellor. Mr. W. X. JAiEs was heard in reply. Lord Justice K1GIIT BRUCE said that after the order of July, 1856, was made, the defendants received the whole costs up to that time. When that order had been made a clause in an Act of Parliament was made known, the construction of which rendered the amendment of the Bill and tbe proceeding with the suit wholly and alike useless. The Vice-Chancellor was not aware of this at the time, and be made his order under the impression that the suit could be ptosecuted. On the application for a perpetual injunction the defect was discovered, aud the Vice-Chaucellor acceded to the objection, but gave the plaintiffi leave to dismiss their bill withont costs. That order, which was now appealed from, was founded both upon abstract justice and upon the spirt of the present rules of the Court, and the appeal must be dismised with costs. Lord Justice TunNER added, that where a man fies a bil on the authority of cases which are subsequently altered, he may dismiss his bill without costs. Here the July order induced the course to be pursued which had taken place, and, as those proceedings took place founded on an oversight of the Court, the case came within the above principle. His Loirdship agrecd that the appeal motion must be refused DAVEY V. DURtRA?T.-SMTIIH V. DURRANT. These causes, the substance of which were given in TAe mes. in February last, came on for hearing.

In July, 1853, a decree was made for the sale of the real estate of Mrs Saunders, the testatriz in the above causes, and for an inquiry as to the encumbrances affeoting that estate. Negotiations having taken place between the plaintiffandthedefendantin "Adkinsv. Bliss " with aview toa settlement of that suit-which negotiations, however, were not brought to a suecesaful issue-the decree in such suit was not prosecuted until November last, when advertisements were isued for encumbrancers to go in before Mr. Hall, one of the Vice-Chancellor'schief clerks. InNorember 1854, the plaintiff in "Vale v. Bliss," a legatee whoso legacy was charged on the real estate of the testatri lmrs. Saunders, by the will of a former owner, filed a Bill to have such legacy raised and paid. No proceedings weretaken in the suit last named until February, 1857, when it was heard as a short cause, and a decree was -made for the sale of the same estate as had been direced to be sold in July, 1853, in " Adkinsv. Bliss,J and for tho same inquiries. after, as it was alleged, the plaintiff in " Vale v. Bliss" had had notice of advertisements having been issuedin " Adkins v. Blise," and of the proceedings which had been taken for prosecuting the decree therein. The decree in " Vale v Bliss"was referred to Mr. Peake, the Vice.Chancellor's oth chief clerk, who, it appeared, did not consider it necessary to advertise for encumbrance before proceeding to a sale, as had been considered necessary by Mr. Hall, who was proceeding with tho preliminary arrangements for sale by directing an abstract to be laid before ono of the conveyancing counsel of the Court. Uinder the circumstances above stated the plaintiff in ' Adkins v. Bliss " moved to stay proceedings in " Vale v. Bliss."

WICKHAM V. GATRs- This was a motion on behalf of the defendants to vary the Chief Clerk's certificate, by wbich it was certified that there was due from the estate of the intestate in the cause to the plaintiffs the sum of 37,9071h The bill was filed by the members of a late banking firm, at Winchestr, apinst the personal representatives of one of their deceased clerk; James Rudge Gatrill, for the purpose of recovering pay. 3ment of the amount of which th(e plaintiffs alleged they had beeni defrauded by Gatrill. In pursuance of a decree made in July, 1854, the chief clerk hd certified that there was due from the Gatrilla! estate to the plaintiffs the sum of 37,907. in respect of moneys belonging to the plaintiffz mLcappropriated y him, and it was now sought to vary that certi cte. The pesnal estate left by J. R,. Gatriji amounted to about 10,l01.y Mr. Bacon and Mr. Giffard appeared for the defendants in support of the motion, and Mr. ainsL Palmer for the plaintiffs, After some discussion The VICE-CHAsCELLOR adjourned the cause to chambers, to consider whether it is desirable that the cause should be ompremised upon the terms of the defendantMr Gatnll, thewidow of J., L atr, receiving 1,1 OOOl.out of the estate of her husbanxd, she giving up the residue of such estate to the plaintifE, or upon any other and what (Before V1ce.ChanclorSir W. P. WOOD.) LAYONE V. THE FALKLA.D I5LA-N1DS COMPANY. Mr. ROLT, Mr. CAntNs, and M&r. GIARD moved on be. half of the plaintiffs for an injunction to restrain the company from making or enforcing any calls on certain shares of the plaintiffs in the company, or any of sruchshares, or from dssposing of the same by sale or otherwise. This suit Is in the nature of a cross suit to one instituted by the comn. pany against the plaintiff, Messrs. Lfone to set aside a contract entered into by the company to purchase from those g-ntlemen certain property in the Falkland Islands on the aleged ground of fraud, and which-property had been and sil1 was in possession of the company by virtue of such e mztract, T=e object of the cross suit, on the other hand is to obtain a declaration from the Court that the contract in question oughat to be specifically performed and comn. pleted, and for an account of all dealings and transacions between the company and fessrs. Lfone, who allepe that if such accounts were taken a sum of between 7,0 and 8,0001 would be found due to them. In this state of things the company have lately made a cald of 12. lOss., payable by instalmentg, upon the several shares in the company, and among them, in respect of 350 shares held by Messrs. Lafone, who declined to pay the call on the folowinz grounds, namely,-that as to 200 of the shares (upon which 50Oper cent. had been agreed to be taken as puai thereon), these formed-part of the purchasemoney which the company had agreed to pay to Messr. Lafone in respect of the very contract which the company were now seeking to set asde ; that, as to theremaining 150 shares, they were taken on the express faith rad unde standing that such contract-would have been fuUy carried into effect by the eompay; and, that If the accounts were gone into, there would be found to be due from the company to Messrs Lafone more than the total amount due unpnsuchcall. No actual proceedings at law had -been t eatened for the enforcement of the calls in question, but the deed of settlement contained the usual covenants to pay an4 a clause enabling the directors within a certain time after non-payment to forfeit the shares andsell and dispose of them for thehbenefit of the company; and it was tothis power that the latter part of the present notice of motion was5 directed. Mr. WILLcocx and Mr. E&Anry, for the company, opposed the motion, and contended that so long as the com. pany was a subssting company the shareholders were bound balthe provisions of thodeed of settlement and that this Curt would not interfere to assist the non-payment by Messrs.Lafone ofcalls which were in course of actual payment by the rest of the shareholders and copartners. As to the alleged balance due from the company nio argument could be founded upon that while the suits were still pending, and if the contract in guestion was to be set aside the result would be that Messrs. Lafone would be debtors to the company in a large amount of purchase-money which had actually been paid. The VICE-Ca A.SCEUOR, after going into the facts of the case, granted the-injunction in tne terms of the notice of motion.

Lord CAMPBELLn said, the learned SolicitorGeneral might tae a rule to show cause. THE QtEE V. GRUFPTs. Mr. MILWAsD moved for a rule calling upon H. AL Griffiths to show cause why an information in the nature of a quo wvarranto should not issue, to show by what authority he claimed to exercise the office of election auditor for the county of Warwick. Mr. Griflitha was appointed election auditor in the year 1854 under the 15th section of the Corrupt Practices at Elections Act (17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 102), which enacted that " once in every year, in the month of August, the returning officer of every countv,city, and borough shall appoint a fit and proper person to be an election officer, to be called ' election auditor or auditor of election expenses.' to act at any election or elections for and during the year then next ensuing, and until another appointment of election auditor shall be made." No fresh appointment having been made in the years 1855 andlS86 Mr.Griffiths continued nader this Eection to hold his office; but in the month of March in the present year the sheriff appointed a new election auditor-Mr. Edward Wright. Mr. Griffiths, however, disputed the validity of this latter appointment, upon the ground that M1r. Wright wag appomted in March, and not, as the Act required, in the month of August. Mr. Wright, in consequence, made the present application, and contended that the words of the s'atuto as to the time of making the appointment were directory merely, and that Mr Wright's appointment in March last wsrrgooaJ, and consequently, that -Mr. Griffiths Lord CAMIPnETL, observed that when the day for appoint. ting mayors of corporations had gone by this Court was in the habit of granting a mandamnus to proceed to an elec- Mr. MiLWARD referred to the 29th section, which enacted that in case-the election auditor should die, resign, or become incapable of acting, the returning officer should appoint a person to act as sub election auditor in the room of the person originally appointed for the remainder of the curient year. The words of the 43d of Elizabeth as to the aprintment of overseers had been held to be directory Lord CAMPwU said, the learned counsel might take a rule. THE QUEmN V. } 1J.NW VALE RAILWAY COMPANY.

Notwithstanding thee promises, the line was still in such a bad state that the waggona were thrown off tho rails, and it was quite unfit for public use. Lord CAmpB said, the learned coansel might tke a rule to show cause. THE QUEEN V. TIE TIVERTON BOARD OF EMArI In this case the Cocrt had granted a m dam&ut to the -Tiverton Board of H[ealth, commanding them to put that part of the burialground provided by the board which was intended to be consecrated ina fit state to be consecrated by the bishop. The board had madea return to the writ, and, in order that the facts of the case might be put on the record, and the necessity of a trial might be avoided, the prosecutor had pleaded certain pleas in answer to the return. The defendants objocted to these pleas, as not stating the facts accurately, and obtained a rule to strike out or amend the pleas. Mr. KARSLA, 'on tho part of the prosecution, now showeed cause against the rule, and suggested that he should be allowed to Plead a plea in the form which he produced and read to the Court. Mr. KINoDON, for the defendants, wsbhod to have it admitted in the plea that the two parts of the burislground were divided by a " suitable andsufficient division." Mr. K SALAIE objected to this Lord CAIUIBrsL said, he thought the plea ought to state the facts as they were-viz, that the whole cemetery was surrounded by a wall, and that the two parts of the cemetery were divided by a wall 18 inches hiEb. It was advisable to avoid going to trial, and his lordship thought it might be arraged. Mr. EAULAKsEai haA no objection to the words "csuitable division," but he objected to the word 'sufficient." The bishop required a fenoefour feet high, and he did so, upon the ground that, as he had iurisdiction only over the consecrated portion, it was his duty to see that that portion was properlyg'1 fenced."1 Lord CA% EBELL-Just as if on the outside there wAS a field orsahighway.

PONSONBy. This was n action brought bys seaman, Robert Hartley againstthe defendant, RolbertP~onsonby, whowasmnaster,oi the ship Mobile, to recover the sum of 401,, due upon a promisEory note given by the defendant underthese circumstances :-The plaintiff shipped at Liverpool as an able sea man,.and signed ship's articles at 31. permonth, from Liver. pool to Port Philip from there, if required, to any ports and places in the facifiOcen,jor China seas, c -and then to England. The ship sailed from England for Port Phillip with emigrants and a crew of 36 hands on board; and, on ariviDg there, a number of the crew deserted and were sent to prison. The tessel wa then required to go to Bombay, but as there were only 19 men lef, only four of whom were able seamen, an. arraugerent was made, between the master and the four able seamen, that if they would go with the ship to Bombay he would pay each of them 401. A.note in this-form was then signed by the master:- 'W*ltne.ea byT ohu DowneV" The shin accordingly sailee to Bombay, and thence to England; but as the defendant refused to py the money this action was brought. The action has been twice tried, and on both occasions the laintiff obtained a verdict On the last occasion it was 19ied before Mr. Justice Erie, at Guildha= at-the sittings after last H,arY term, wheni his Lordship left three questiona to the jary-L Whether the agreement was voluntaty or compuLsory? 2. Whether the master could, by reasonable exertions, have obtained additional hands? And, 3. Whether it was unreaEonable and Improper. to proceed to sea with a reduced crew, explaining that it would bo unreasonable and improper if it would be dangerous to life, either from the perils of navigation or from the excessive laboar? The jury found, first, that the agreement was voluntary, and not by coercion, and, under the circumstances, for the best interests of the owners; secondly, that the captain could not get additional hands at any, reasonable price; and, thirdly, that they considered it unreasonable for a vessel of 1, 045 tons to proceed to sea with a csw~of only 19 hands. The plaintiff having thus obtained the verdict, the defendant subsequently obtained a rule to enter the verdict in his favour, and also for a new trial upon the ground that the verdictwas og4idnt the evidence,. Mr. H1. Brn, Q.C.1 and Mr. XMmWAn, now s'howed cause agains the rule, which was supported by mr. Knowles, Q.C., and Mr. Aspland. Ird CAIPBELL said, he was of opinion that the verdict found for the plaintiff ought to stand, and he founded that 9pinion on the answer given by the jury to the third uestion, as, hut for that answer, the undertaking would not bave been binding. The substance of that finading was, that tbe ship was so short-handed at Port Philip that it would havebeendangeroustolifetogoto Bombay, andthatthe plain. tiff was not bound under the&rticlestogotoBombay. If there had merelybeen an addition of labour, without endangering life, he(IordCampbell)shonldhavethought the new contract between the men and the master was not binding on the rmaster any more than on the owner. But the jury had found that the men were not bound on the articles to go to Bombay. They were free men, and at liberty to enter into a new contract with the master of the ship. If that was so the action was cel lymaintainable. There was no coercion, as was foundab% the Jury, and there was a consideration, for r hypothesi, t ey were notbound to go n thebship to Bom. bay. There was a voluntary underaking to do that, and the master voluntarily undertook to Ma the men the sum of 401. This decison did not conflict with any dictum or decisiox brought before the Court, and there wa the authonty of that able judge. Dr. Lushington, that danger to life rzleased a seaman from the obligation to continue the voyage. As, therefore, there was a voluntary agreement and a good consideration, the action was maintainable, It oould not be said the verdict was aainst the evidence. It was true there was coiflictina evidence, but he (Lord Campbell) could not say the verdict ouoht to be disturbed. The other judges were of the same opinion. Mr. Justice Esrz addled, that he was strongly impre,sed with the conviction that sailors ought not to he encouraged, in a moment of difficulty, to insist on higher wages; but, on the other hand. he also thought that there was a point where it was unreasonable for the master to require the crew to go on, He (Mr. Justice E:rIe) had therefore talen care to explain these matters to the jury, who had found that it would .have been unreasonable in the master to require the crew rto go to sea. The men were therefore free sailor, and in .tbe samne position as other sailors at Post Phillip. Rule discharged. S rNS V. SOLOMMON. This was an action brought by a jeweller in Hattongarden to recover the price of certain jewelry sold and delivered to the defendant. The defendant lived at Maids-hill, bat he had a shop at Lewes, which was managed by his nephew, Abraham Solomon, who had authority to manage the business and to make purchases necessary for carrying it on. Goods were supplied to the shop at Lewes from time to time, but ultimately the nephew left Lowes and came to London. He then went to the plaintiff s shop in Hatton. garden, and got nearly 201. worth of jewelry, which he ut ih his waistcoat-pocket and converted to his own use. Ee was soon after tried and convicted of the offence. On the proof of these facts before Mr. Justice Erle, at GuUilallh some time since, it was reserved for this Court to say whether there was reasonable evidence upon whichba jury might findsa verdict for the plaintifr.a Mr. hI. CnA=ims, Q.C., and Mr. MANrsTY were heard for the plaintiff; Mr. HAWKIsS and Mr. Luvwis for the defendant. Lord CiPBnE said, he thought there was reasonable evidence to support a verdict for the plaintiff. There was evidence that the nephow was the general agent of the defendant in the conduct of the business; and that the defendant was hound by his acts as such general agent. The other Judges were of the same opinion. Rule accordingly.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, W lnnfsTX JTfm- 4 31ML AND nTTtVRQ v ul-- .--- .11- -.---- btaUings in Banaco.-TrnnUifm P- In this cas Mr. ERThe moved fora,prohibition to pre. vent the County Court at Liverpool from further proceeding in the suit. The learned counsel stated that the plaintiffs were the trustees of the REoyal Oak Friendly Burial Society and the defendants were the nmanagiug commnittee; that the1 Society was one,of the largest in the1 kingdomn, comprising nearly 50,00 memnbers; and that the County Couzrtjiudgo at Liverpool, in the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction given by the Friendly Society's Act, 18th and 19th of Vlc. tona, cap. 63, sec. 41, had decreed that certain alterations of the rules agreed to at a general meeting of the society were illegal and void, andthat the defendants should not attempt to obtain a certificate from the registrar, Mr. Tidd Pratt, that the were according to law; and that the dIefendants shoui paythe costs of certain deputations to the engddtrar out of teir own pockets, the ace htions in the plaint in the County Court being that the meeting in ques. tion had been called by the defendants at an imp roper time anid in an improper place. It was now objected on various grounds that the County Court had no jurisdiction in the matter; that the trustees were not interestdinthe subjectmatter of the suit; thab these powers were limited by the Friendly Society's ctn and did not extnd to the institution of such a sit; that the declaration that the rules were null and void was beyond the poders of a court of equity; that there wAs no power in the Court to order the payment of costs by the efendants; and that the trustees, if they were sinztg for the society, were suing or behalf of the defendantss sgainst themsedves. Mr. of the Cshowed causeinthe first inTa r econtended, as reptoenting the society, that they had authority under the Friendly Society's Act to apply to the Coanty Court, and that the judge had power to make such otrer. The lemaned judge had decreed that the meeting af which the rules were agreed to was ilegal, and the rules ull and void, and had required an undertaking to beentOned into that' they sould not he re¶4istered, and an account to be rendered within week of all tne moneys expended by the managing committee out of the funds om the society in andaabout calling the meeting andpasn the rules, and ,isnonteua1to that mm~ was ordred to be Paid into court to abide its further order, and the defendants to pay all the coats incidental to the application. This was the older of the County Court Judgeo. The learned counsel c9ntended that undeqr the 40th and 41st sections of the 18th andl19th Victoria5 ea. 63, the County Court udge haAau. t~orityto entertainamicha question asthis,an tsettle any disputes that might *&tie. The intention of the Legislature was to aive the entire Jurisediction of the CouLrt of Chancery to the Cunty Courts, the Court of Chancoery being th only trustees, and they were ifatdo can, t bebroght or defended any aetion or. sut inan cotut of law or equity touching or concerning the psoperty rigt r lam f the society of which they are tuss. Thi4 society consisted of :15,000 members, with an ania incomte of 11,000t. arising from subscriptions of member, and some 40,00O persons were interested ia its m aeIact, The managng committee had oonvened th meetin at which the rules in question were psed at S o'clock in the afternoon, when the great bulk of the members, as workmen, could not attend, and in a room which would not hold 100 persong; and tihe rules then passed proposed to allowthooollectors 25 poercnt. of the sums collected for their remuneration. Additional expenditure was incurredAnd rules were pwmd which inread the power of the existing managing body. The tr thought these proceedings inexpedient and illegl and the County Courtjudge came tothe conclusion that the ma&W ing body were attempting toincreae their own einolumentg and power at the expense of the members of the xociety, without ving the members of the society the opporhunit of considering the rules thus passed, and that the funds -vested ini the trustee 'were being improperly expended lin :endeavouring to get these rules changed.

BRED having been heard in reply. The C}EPt JUsTICE said, he was not desirous of expressing any opinion of his own on this cas. Ile hid doubts'whether the trusee had not jurisdiction under the 41st section to set the County Court judge in motion. His learned brothers were of a different opinion, and his doubts were not so ccgSent as to induor him to wish to delay the decision. iMr. ustice CRzSwwL sad, he was of opinion the rullo must be made absolute. There were many provisions in this Act of Parliament to failitate the termination of disputes in societies of this description. There could be no oubt tbat the gentlumen who had instituted these prooeed. inDg had acted from the beA motives. A desire Aroe in the society to effoct an alteration in their rule It. was not sad that they- wished to make any Tule inconsistent with the ' purpoes of their societ-' bet no alteration coulda be made in thei unless at a meeting called in a particular i nner anda ata tonvenient place. Now. a meeting had been convened at an inconvenient hour an4din a xma&U room, when certaik alter. itions were madein14heirrules., It did not appesr that any member of theoaity comp ained or was likely to be injured, or aprebended that he would be injured; but it seemed that these gentlemen, as trustees, thought the snembers of the society were not wise in the course they were puriuing, andl thought that if a larger meeting had been teld it wAs probable theymraight have rejected the rules proposed. But it did no; appear that even now any of the members objected to them, and he could not see that the trustees had any right to institutetheseproceeding,, or tlat the County Court judge had.any "dispute" before him whichlhe was called on to determine. The 41st section:gve no jurMi tion in such case, and, consequently, the decree -ought not to be established.' I r )ate Wnxx&zms was ofAthe same, opinon. The 4lst secton of thi saptute appeared to him to confine the jurisdcation of the County Court judge to the applicationt of the paTty interested in the matter. The affidavits dix. closed that the applicants were the trustees of the sociepty The question was, whether they bad any interest within th meamng of this section of the Act of Parliament. If it had appeared that there was any dis ute between them and the members of the soiety thatw vould clearly have been a matter to be settled by the County Court judge. But there was no such groand. Werb they, then, as trustees so in. terested in tW, matter as to givesjurisdiction? If they bad not inteirfered, these rules would have be certified, and would have been binding on all parties. It appeared to him that it was not at all pertaining to their trust, or within the nronnce of their trust, to examiine whether the rules vere- beneo&cal to thnesociety or not. The trustes had acted out of their authorit, and the County Court had no jurisdiction in the Mr. Justice WILLES expressed the same opinion. BRule absolute for the prohibition to issue.

The, circumshnces under which the transaction was entered intowere explained by the plaintiff in his examination. Mr. John Pace.-I am in partnership with my brother, and we cary on business as India merchants at Ausifriars. The defendant carries on a business as an upholsterer in partnership with a Mr. Bogers. Before Deoeiiher, I85, I had purchased some furniture of the defendaut. About the 20th of that month I called with my son upom the defendant,andaaked himtodiscoun ab Uof25Lz.17 & drawn by Pace Brothers upon Frahais Behren,. of Birming. ham, dated November 30th, 1854. The defes,dant said ho *ould discount it for 156. I said I would take 100. worth of furniture, and I took a receipt for the money, leaving the furniture to be sdected at a future timo. The defendant gave me one check for the 10. and another check for 1361. odd, being the amount of the bil leas the 15L . The 100L c'heck was handed over for the furniture, the other check _ paid into our bankers. Witbin about three months I ob. T4ined furniture to the amoumit of about 1361. The bill was due on the 4th of Xma , and Behrens having become bankrupt in February the biU was dishonoured. I re. ceived notice of dighonour on the 5th of March, aud I called upon the defendant. I offered him a bill for M01. drawn by Wiliam Erle upon George Merritt, due the 4th of June, which I said we would guarantee in the ususl wav. He said Erle was rather a slovenly mau, but he would tLie the bill, and also hold Bebrens' hill, and prove upon his eEtate for what he could. He afterwards said he would not Igototheexpenseof proving, ashe found there was no estae; andhegavemebckthebill. Erle'sbill was paid whenit came to maturity,and about the 20th of Junelvwrote to the defendant. The reply I received was that Erle's bill ws tken in lieu of Bebrens', and the defendant coneidered the tyansaction closed. I again wrote, offering to allow20l per cent. per annum upon the bill, and askiLg for the balance, 351. lis. 3d. The defendant dterwards came to my house about a balance of 761 odd, due by me on account of the fitniture transaction, and which I had refused to pay until t :e bill transaction bad been settled. He offered to give me cabinet mark;ed at 21t. lOs. in settlement of the differenoe .between us, saing that I could afterwards settle with the firm. The cabinet wassent,butIreturnedit.

PREROGATIVE COURT, TauRSDAY, Jui,E 4. RVflALL V. %VARREN. BY fl9 C.TTAPnTA\ (Before Sir JoaX DOnDnv-rn This was a business of granting letters of administration, with the wil annexed, of William Hall, deceased, promoted by Sarah Rudall, thesisterandonlynextof kino2 thedeceased, against Wiliam Hall Warren, a minor (by Emma Badnell kiiguardian), claimingtobothresiduary iegateenamedinthe will. The Issue was whether William Hal Warren was the residuary legatee or whether the residue was undisposed of. The bequest was,-" I wil that my freehold house, No. 71, Queen's-road, Bayswater, be given to the inhabitants of mayswater to found a lying-in asylum for unmarried women or poor married women. I will that my executors do call a meeting of the neighbours and inhabitants of one mile round the said house as soon as convenient, to appoint a committee and trustees to carry out the same. I do appoint my godson, William Hall Warren, one of the said trustees, leaving to the inhabitants to makeo choice of as many more as they may please. But in the event of thesaid inhabitants not appointing a committee, or not willing to carry out the same, I then wil that aU my said property so given to said maternal retreat, or lyingin asylum, shall absolutely belong to my said godson, William Hal Warren; aud I will that the deeos of the said house be given to said trustee or trustees. I will that the said trustee or trustees be my residuary legatees to this my Dr. DFASs, for the next of Idn, contended that the gift of the residue to the inhabitants of Bayswater and to the committee and trmstees, as also the gift over of the same residue to William Hall Warren, were void in law, and that the residue was undisposed of. He cited the " Attorney. <General v. Whitchurch" (3, Ves., 146), '- Attorney-General v. linxman" G2, Jac. and Walk, 270) and "Philpott v. St. George's Hospital" (21, Beav., 134). Dr. BAYFORD, for the guardian of William Hall Warren, adiitted the devise of the house to be void ia law, but contended that the devise over to William Hall Warren took effect; that, as the surviving executor named in the ill had renounced, there was no ono authorized by law to convene the meeting of the inhabitants of Bayswater according to the directions of the testator, and that consequently W. H. Warren took the bequest as residuary legatee. He cited 2, Rop. Leg., 1677. He further contended that if the Court was of opinion that W. H. Warren did not take the residue, yet the evidence showed that afrs. Eudall was not a fit and proper Person to have the administration, and the Court shoul tberefore exercise its discretion by granting the adminisration to the guardian of the minor aS a principal legatee named in the will. Sir J. DODsoN having stated the circumstances of the case, and referred to the authorities cited, was of opinion that the present case came within the rule laid down therein, that, as the devise of the house was void by the Statute of Mlortinain, the gift of personalty -connected with such devise would be also void, and that, the devise being void, the gift over was al1so void. Though it was true that by the failure of the gift it would fall into the residue, yet it did not appear true that William Hall Warren was benefically entitled to that residue. It did not appear that the testator intended bim to take the residue in any other capacity than thatof tmrestee for the charity. He was not the beneficiary rsiduary legatee, so as to be entitled to all the lapsed legacies under the wll. They must be considered as falling to the next of kin Mrs. Rudall had applied for the rnt in that character, and, although the Court was not T nd by the statute to grant it to her, yet, according to the ordinary rules of the court, she would be entitled to it unless some etreng reasons were shown to the contrary. Circurmstances were certainly proved wbich induced the belief thatahe was uot the fittest person to receive the grant; but, inasmuch as the estate was to be administered under the direotion-of the Court of Chancery, the otber parties would not be damnified by her being appointed adminmstratrix, and there did not appear sufficient reason for the Court to depart from its ordinary.gpractice. The grant must therefore pass to srs. Rudall as tie sister and next of kin of the testator, the costs of both parties being paid out of the estate. *CP,Q259: V.

POY4Icz. BOW-STRhMT-ThorXAs Brooks and HIenry Cleorge Hardy, both undeor 20 ye;rs of age, were brought up for further examli' atioa on several charges of forgery. Bverooksng h been lately in the employ of IL-. Bart, .,dve agen Upper Wellington-street, and hating succeeded in getting a blank checkbook from the Temple. bar bra'..eh of the London and Westminster Bails, by mnecna of a forged order, had filled up und cixtulatedas 5naE7 as 48 checks for sums ranging from 51. to 151., the Prso er Hardy and two Others not in cusltdy having tW sted in uttering them. Several newv cases were gone into, one df the most re'markable of which was proved by Ur. Chlis, foreman of a London wine company in Lime-sreet, Cty, of whom the prisonere had tried to obtain six dozen 'o wine. Brooks, knowing that his !Ate employer had bransacted business with the company, sent Hardy to 'hire a horse and carts drew out an order for the wine, and digned Mr. Bartoars name to a check for 15L Hardy drove the cart to Lime. street and presented the order aud check, stating that he would take back the wine in the cart. It happened, however, that Mr. Barton himself had only just left the premises, and, having said nothig about such an order for wine, a suspicion arose that the order and check were forgeries-a suspicion that was fully confirmed on the wribing being more eloselyexamined. The foreman consequentlydesiredhisman totakedownthename of the ownerof the cart, and while this was being done the prisoner Hardy decamped, leaving the horse and cart behind. It was sub. sequently found that the home and cart had been hired by Brooks and Hardy of a Mrs. CLark, of Russell-mews, Howland-street, at I. (d. per hour. In another case, It transpired that on a Saturday evening Hlrdy went to Ar. Weatherall, the landlord of a publichouse in Vere-street, Covent-garden, and presented a note, purporting to be vritten by Mr. W. Johnson, an old ftiend of the landlords, and requestinz change for a check -for 61 5s., It being past bank hours. The landlord, without a moment's hesitation, gave the risoner six sovereigns and 5s., and found afterwards that the check, purporting to be drawn by " Chubb and Co." on Johnson, was a forgery. Johnson, on being called to prove the forgery, stated that Brooks used to lodge in his house, in the name of Keeley, and this was how he came to know of the intimacy existing between himself and Mr. Weatherall. AIr. Barton proved that the checks and orders in both cases were in the handwriting of Brooks. Police-constable Frankland deposed to havingapprehended Hardy in the pit of the Victoria Theatre. The prisoner admitted that he had pssed chocks for Brooks, but said he only knew of one ot them beig forged, and that was one which he tried to pans in Macclesfield-street, without success. Mr. HENBY expressed his opinion that the solicitor for the London and Westminster r=ank ought to prosecute in this case. It so happened that they had sustamed no loss, having detected the forgery when the checks were presented; but the blank checkbook had been obtained from one of their cashiers by a forged order, and thus facilities were given for the frauds by which so many tradesmen had suffered. The Bank of England would prosecute ander the circumstances, and he hoped the present case would be represented to the committee. The prisoners were both remanded for another week. WoRsEa-sv.-r.-Wi1inm Lambert, apparently a greengrocer, was charged before lr. HAilnL With the following reckless conduct. Matthew Rorsfall Baid,-I am a driver in the service of the General Omnibus Company, driving one of their Hack. ney and Homerton omnibuses, and was doing so at 12 o'clock to-day in the Hackney-road, I going on my near side, when I saw the defendant in a costermonger's cart, I driving at a fuzions pace, of, I should think, about 13 miles an hour. I tried to avoid him, but could not, and the shaft of his cart went into the body of my off-side horse. The horse did not drop, but it bled a great deal, and the wound was of so serious a description that a gentleman who saw it put his handkerchief into it. The defendant W8S sober, and wanted to take the horse home and oure it, but I would not, of course, allow thaL Mr. M'Namara, who attended for the company.-The horse, before this occurrence, was worth 401., but tha veterinary surgeon novr says he thinks it will die, Frederick Dlton.-I live at Hackney, and was a witness to this matter. I saw the defendant galloping his own horse, and saw him torn it on to the horse in the omnibus. Mr. ?IrMr, (to defendant).-What is your answer to this ? Defendant.-Well, I certainly was going rather fast. Mr. HAz sLL (to Mr. NNamara).-I cannot grant you compensation for the damsge you have sustained ; you must o to the County Court for that. I can only punsh the lefendant for his furious driving, and for that I sbhall sentence him to pav a penalty of 40s., or, in default of payment, he must go 0 tohe House of Correction for one month. The defendant veuld not pay the penalty, and was therefore taken away in the van. CLURE1NVwELT.-A respectably-dressed young man, vwho gave the name of John Banyard, residing at No. 8 King'sterrace, Clerkenwell, was charged with obtainig b,y means of forged orders the sum of 1001. from his masters, Messrs. Johuson and MIatthey, refiners of flatton-garden. M;. Tmw}llss committed the prisoner to Newgate for Henry Ward Bishop, a brickdayer, with a very forbidding cast of countenance, residing at No. 9, Ashby-street, Kingsorss, was charged with assaulting and wounding his wife with a knife. The prisoner treated tho matter with the greatest levity, and said that his wife's condnct was very annoying. He should reserve his defence for a hkher tribunal. ALr. *. xz± 1rrr enura oeried Une conduct of the prisoner as most disgraceful, and said that the term of imprisonmcnt he was empowered to inflict-viz, six months, was not sufficient to meet the justice of the Case. The short terms of imprisonment that he had suffered hid made no impression, and would make no impression on such a fellow as the prisoner, who treated the matter wlth the greatest caUlousness, and who seeedto think that he was at liberty to illuse and beat his wife when he pleased, He should therefore send him to NTewgate for trial. The prwroner was then removedo TEIAIEs.-4oseph Williams, a soldier belonging to the 14th Light Dragoons, stationed at Maidstone, in Kent, was brought up on remand before Mr. YARDLEY charged with committing an aggravated assault on Sarah King. Mr. YARDLEY said, there was only one way to treat this case; it must be met with a severe punishment. In a fit of mad, frantic jealousy, the prisoner had beaten the woman in a most savage manner. The prisoner had no claim on the woman whatever; if she had half-a-dozen men in her house the prisoner had nothing to do with it. If the prisoner had a claim on the woman the way to enforce it was not to beat her. The prisoner had committed a most brutal and most unmanly act on a defenceless woman, and his feelings were those of such intense malignity that he had threatened that he would do for her in the street while in custody of the police. If he were to judge by the prisoner's deportment in the dock, he was harbouring thoughts of revenge againsti the complainant. He sentenced the prisoner to sir months' imprisonment and hard labour, and at the termination of that period to find good bail for six menths longer, to keep the peace and be of good beha. vioar to the complainant and aUl Her Mtajesty's subjects, SOUrTMVARIL-On Wednesday week last, it may be recollected, Hemny Webb, Thomas Cook, Ann Tobin, and Catherine Brown were charged at this court with being concerned with others in murderously assaulting Mr. Saul Laurie, a Russian Jew and merchant's clerk, and robbing him of two watches, a gold pin, and 131. in gold. The pro. secutor then stated that on the previous evening, at 8 o'clock, he met two men on the Surrey side of Blackfriars. bridge, with whom he got into conversation about the West Indies, where they had been. They asked hiri to treat them, and he scoompanied them to a publiehouse in Disnystreet, in the Mint, Southwark, where he treated them and some women. He had at that time two watches and 13t. in gold in his possession. He remained with them until past 11 o'clock, when he left the publichouse, but as soon as he got into the street he was garotted, and so ill-used that he was left for desd in the gutter. An unfortunate woman named Cronin saw him attacked, and, believing that he was murdered, went in search of a constable, and on their return the assailants had fled, and the prosecator was found sitting on a doorstep with his hands to his head, bleeding profusely. From a description given of the thieves to Macarthy, 134 hs, he apprehended aU the prisoners in a lodginghouse close by, and they were examined before the ma,gistrate and remanded for further evidenoe. The witness Cronin was then re-examined, when she said she could not swear exactly to all the prisoners, but could to Brown, whom she saw leave the publichouse just before the prosecutor was assaulted. The male prisoners also declarted that they were not in the publichouse on the night in question, which was corroborated by Mr. Knight, the landlord of the publichouse, who deposed that he heard cries of " Murder" in the street after 11 o'clock, but such noises being so frequent in that low neighbourhood he took nonotioe of them. Bie, however, aterwardssawtheprosecutor severely iujured. Hfonora Collins also said she saw the prosecutor drinking int the publichouse with three men who were returned trAnsports, and they claimed acqusintanco with him at Bermuda. The rale prisoners were not in the publichouse that night, and the women had nothing whatever to do with him except Brown, and sbe left him before he was attacked.

G. C. NoR.ToN on a charge of cutting and wounding John Johnson, his brother-in-law. From the evidence it appeared that on the 17th of lastmonth the -parties had quarrelled t consequence of the prisoner striking his mother, and the prosecutor struck him. A struggle ensued, and at its conclasion the prosecutor felt blood flowin from his gide, and then discovered that he had been stabbed in the side under the left arm.

A CASE FOR THE WAR DEPARBTfNT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. S-r,-My non, Major Charles Aldersey Stevenson, of the 47th RegIment, landed at Varna, and during the Bulgarian campalgnwastwice attackedbythefever, oncenearlyfatally; whenscarcely recovered he sailed with the expedition to the Crimea, where his regiment formed part of the Second Divlison under Sir De Lacy Evans, and afterwards General Pennefather; he was present at the Alma, the 16th of Octo. ber, and Inkermann, and, I conclude, did his duty, as he received his brevet promotion at the earnest recommendation of the officer commanding his regiment and the Brigade, and was selected among the few for the Legion of Honour. Providence protected him through those three awfal days, but his constitution yielded under the continued hardships and privations of the trenches, and having broken a bloodvessel he was invalided home; after his return he wss again brought to the ve e of the grave, and was finally ordered by a board of health to the south of Europe, where after months of lingering suffering he expired. Though formonths hicase was utterly hopelees he had no desire that his family should make money by his services; and, conceiving that the latelwarrant gavethe Secretary for Waradiscretion to permit the sale of such commissions as had been purchased, where death could be unmistakeably traced to active services in the field, he did not avail himself of the privilege which his services would have entitled him to claim-to sell dur'eg life all commissions, whether purebased or obtained gratuitously. On application, however, to the authorities, it would appear that the warrant only contemplated death in the field or death from wounds within six months. This distinction I can hardly see the justice of,and why months of ngeng sufferingshould be considered a disqualification, and in the present case I rmust consider tbere is an additional claim upon the Government. Had it been the will of God that my son should have fallen by the hand of the enemy, I should have acquiesced without a murmur, but I confess the conviction that his death is to be attributed to the unattended wants of the British army in the earl stages of the campaign has aggravated my feelings and I cannot but think if those wants had been duly attended to I shouldnot have had to mourn the loss of thebest ofsonsor the service the best of officers.

ZECUTIO)? FOR MUDER. MAIDSTONE, JuiNz 4. The last penalty of the law was this morning inflicted upon George Bave i front of the gaol of this town. The culprit ws a seaman on board the Slaney gunboat, and he was convicted at the gay session of the Central Criminal Court of the murder of Samuel Long, a corporal of Maines on board the same vessel, by stabbing him with a bayonet, the act having been commnittedin a most deliberate wanner, and under a feeling of revenge on accoant of the corporal having reported Bave for some act of misconduct, and thereby, as he supposed, prevented him from being promoted to the position of quartermaster. The moment the dread, l act wa committed tho prisoner exclaimed M "My neck for it; I have had my revenge, and I don't care now what happens ;" and he neverappears to have entertined the least hope of escapingthepunishment of death for t.he crime. The c.ifence having bien commited withinatbe county of KRent, the duty dei olved upon the sheriff for that county to see the sentence carried into execution, and the prisoner, after hus trial, was at once removed to the county gaol for that puar pose. The prisoner, under the circumstances, could not attempt to deny his guilt, but he states that he was in liquor at the time, and that in a sudden fit of frenzy, ac^elerated by his condition, he attacked tho unfortunate deceased, and inflicted the deadly injury upon him; he declared that he was utterly unable to control himself, but he frequently expressed deejp regret for the act he had committed, and at the same tino admittedthat his life vas justly forfeited. It is not tr%e, it appezrs, that any memoril was eent to the Government praying for a commutation of the capital sentence; indeed, the crime was of such a nature that it was felt to be hopeless to make s-uch an application, and the prisoner himself, from the moment of his being taken into custody, appears to have been quite resigned to his fate. It seems that the culprit was a nativo of London, but the only relatives who visited him are two sisters. He was uder an engagement to be rnarried to a respectable young woman at the time of the melancholy oocurrence, and she was permitted to have an interview with him after his convictien at the Central Criminal Court. His sisers saw him for the last time onL Wedneeday evening, and when they left the to0 they appeared to be almost brokenhearted. Shortly before 12 oeclock, tho hour appointed for the execution, Mr. Wilde, the Under-Sheriff, accompanied by several officers, arrived at the gaol, and at once proceeded to the cell where the unhappy man was confined. He appeared quite calm and composed, and u n Mr. lillyer, the governor of the prison, asking him if tre was any ruestthathehadcto }e,herepliedthathew vvery grtteful for the kindness he had received, and the only thing more that he desired to be done for him was that his clothes should be handed over to his family after he ws gone, and he ws assured that this request should be complied with. Calcraft, the executioner, then proceeded to pinion him, and when this had been done the prisoner turned round to one of the warders in whoee charge he had been placed, shook him by the hand, and said " Good bye." The mournful procession was then formed, and the culprit walked firmly up the steps leading to the drop, and mounted the scaffold with a quick firm step. The moment lhe had taken his place under the beam he looked calmly round at the assembled crowd, and Calcraft placed the C&p over his face and adjusted the rope. The drop then felI and the culprit appeared to expire almost without a struggle. The prisoner bore the character of a firt-rate seaman, and when he was transferred from the Fisgard, to which vessel he formerly belonged, it was with the understanding that hewasto receive promotion, and the disappointment to his hopes in this respect no doubt led to the atal catastrophe wvhich resulted in his being thus brought to an auntimely end. The body, after hanging an hour, ws cut dow/n, and was buried ln the course of the day within the ecincts of the gaol, pursuantto the sentence. There vere fewer persons presentto wvitness the execution than M ere ever remebered to have attended on such an occasion.

Sir George Clerk, Bart., Vice-President, in the chair, Messr W. M. Buckton, W. J. page, and A B. Knight were elected FeUows of the Society; and Profemsor Flourens, Perpetual Secretary to the Academy of Sciences in the Imperial Institute of France, as a foreign member; and the Earl of Lichfield, Major Birst, and Messms R. Marshall, H. Taylor, J. Havers, 0. Frauenknecht, W. Armstrong, B. T. Clacr, and J. Wardlaw were proposed as candidates for the Fellowship. The report stated that donations had been received sinco the lest meeting from his ExceUency W. D. Christie, Her Maj sty's Minister Plenipotentiar to the Argentine Confederation, and from his Excellency Captain T. EL Mooro, R.N.. Governor of the Falkland Islands. The "Upland geeso," from the Falkland Islands, nre entirely new to the Society's collection, and are particularly valuable as being likely to reproduce in this country as freely as their congeners the Magellanic geese, of which the Society obtained their first stock from the coUection at Knowsley. The number of visitors on Whit-Monday and the foUowing day amounted to 29,120. On Saturday they amounted to 3,030, making upwards of 32,000 in three days-a result which has never been exceeded since the Society's establishment. CsRim IN FRA.NcE.-The Court of Asaizes of the Rh6ne three days ago tried a peasant named Guillemet, of Saint Igny de Vers, for the manslaughter of his son, aged about 14, so far back as August, 1853. On the 10th of that month It was noticed that tho boy had disappeared, and nothing was seen or heard of him untilthe 19th, when his dead body was found in an advanced state of putrefaction in a hedge near his father's house. It was not ossible, from the decomposed state of the body, to see whefher or not it bore traces of violence, but as the man had for a long time treated the boy with great brutality, little doubt was entertained by his nelghbours of his having murdered him. Strange to say however, no investigation was instituted, and nothiung was thought of the matter untl Febrnaty last, when the man, baving been arrested on some other charge, of which, however, he turned out to be innocent, manifested such profound terror at the Idea that his arrast might cause inquiries to be made respecting the death of his son that the matter was investigated. The result was that a labourer naTned Chuzovill came forward and said that on the 9th of August, 1863, he had seen the boy lying beneath a tree covered with blood, and that the boy stated in answer to his inquiries that his father had Iust beaten him most cruelly; also that the next day as he (Chuzeville) was passing near the house of Guillemet, he saw theboy perched ina cherry-tree eating cherries, and that his father, having oome up at the moment, threw a large piece of wood, which, striking the boy on the head, caused him tofall senseless to the ground; that the father tben takinghim up in his arms carried him into his house. This was the last time the boy was seen alive,, so that there was no doubt the blow had klled him. The jury declared the prisoner guilty, bnttwith extenu ting circsmstances, and the Court senced him to six years' hard labour. THE ScoTrc CouRT OF Srssox.-The nunaber of extra sittings of the Court of Session, in terms of the Act 2d and 3d Victoria, cap. 36. has been six, al of them subEequent to January 1, 1853; of these six two were extra sittiDgs of the whole court and four of the first division only. No extra sittings of the Lords Ordin have been held under the 10th section of the Act 2d and i oria, cap. 36, but under the 9th section of that Act all the Lorda Ordinary have, since January 1, 1840, sat three weeks longer in each year than previously. The number of causes standing on the roll of the first and second divisions of the court, and ready for hearing on the 1st of January, 1857, was respectively 235 and 30.

PEAfAZLZ DUOCATIOX. TO TEIE EDITOR OF TH!E TIMES. Bir,-I thank you for oalling attention to industria employments as au essential element of popular eduoaion, and I now crave tha aid of your uaiversal circultion as a mediun of reply to many inquiries conoerning the systen adopted in this parih and the results which have attended it. Experienoe hs taught us that any attempt to make agricultureor manual tdes an element of instruction in our national schools for boys must necsrily fail, seeing that they can learn the former very well at home, and have not tune to spare for the litter to make the knowledge they may acquire profitible to them in after life. With girls the cse Is different; their avocations are indoors, and admit of instruotion at school of a better kind thma can be had at home. The most important and of every-day necemity are dremakig to the extent of cutting-out and makdng their own clothes, wshing and gettingupfinelinen, household work and cooking. The method we have adopted has been as follows- 1. Dressmaking.-Having laid in a stock of materials at wholessle prices, of suitable texture and patterns, we invite thechildren, nothing lotb, to make their own selection. The pupil-teachers and elder ebildren, under the direction of the mistress, cut out the dresses, and each child, a far as it is able, makes its own. When completed they we fitted and tried on before the class, and upon payment by instalments, or otherwise, given to the children to tke to their parents. The charge is carefully calculated upon the prime cost of the material, and an account sent home with each article. By this means the children get cheaper and better clot'aos than they could in any other way, and, inas. much as they feel that they owe them in some measure to their own skill and indtttry, naturally learn to take much greter care of them. A siranger entering the chool for the first time could hardly fail to remark upon their uniformly nest appearanoe-a result mainly attributable to the simple plan described. 2. Washing.-.-For the encouragement of others similarly sitnated with ourslves, I beg to observe that the schools are in the oentre of the town, and consequently oonfined in spae. The ae of the wAshhouse is only 25 feet by 15 feet, outside measure, in which we contrive to get in one compaTtment a wasbhouae; beneath it a tauk for ran water from the roof of the schools; a well with pump for i spring water inono corner; alongtwosidesl2 washing-boxer, convertble by letting down a Oover into ironing-tables; three boilers, one to aupply by means of leaden pipes and taps the wahing-boxes with hot water, a second for the supply of hot water to the large metal pipes under the drying closet, and the third for boiling the dirtiest of the clothes. A cistern isalso placedin it, to receive spring water from the pump, at a sufficient elevation to convey it also by means of pipes into the waahing-boxes when required. This portion of the building is open to the roof. The other compartment embraces a drying closet, space for mangle, and staircase with room over it, for heating the irons, and airing the clothes after they are finished. The children bring their own clothes in baskets the beginning of each week, which are returned as soon as they are com. pleted. A laundress was employed at first to teach them, but of late the pupil-teachers have been found fully equal to the duty. 3. Household Work,-This is taught tothe pupU teachers and elder children by admitting them in rotation for a week at a time into the master's house, which, as Eix or eight young people are boarded with him and form part of his famnily, affords an excellent opportunity for initiating them in the ordiniry matters of domestic economy. 4. Cooking.-The clinary department wil require greater details, which I enter into more willingly, not so much from a sense of its intrinsic importanoe aa from ths experience I have gained how much in connexion with a school it may be made to supply a want most painfully felb In almost every parish in the kingdom. If there is one thing of which our poor stand in need more than another it is suitable nourishment in the time of and upon recovering from sicles.L How often is the happy moment lost when a generous diet might have acted like a charm upon theexhaustedand attennated frame! How often are relapses experienoed from the use of improper food, or, what is pretty nearly the same thing, food ronghly and improperly prepared I The clergyman's kitchen and that, too, of many of the laity oftentimes come in aid, but dependenoe, for many reasons into which I do not care to enter, must not be implicitly reposed on casual charity. The claims are so miany, the necessary relie' so varied in its kind, and in its bestowal requiring so much care and delicate attention, that we are constrained to confess that they are not duly supplied. To supply what is wanting the following plan has been adopted, alike inexpensive im the first out. lay and simple in its subsequent mnnagement:For a kitchen a shoring has been raised, 10 feet long by 4 feet wide, in connexion with the master's house. In it a small ga stove has been placed, about 3 feet high by 16 inches in diameter, supplied by Messrs. Deane and Dray, at a cost below 101., which, with the addition of a few sauoepans, oompletes the apparatus; for with the aid of the stove, small as it is, a dinner may be cooked for 20 people. If gas cannot he had, 'which is both cleaner and chesp. r than coal, as it is applied duing the time of cooldng onl a acommon grate must be substituted. At first, fora few weels, an experienced person Tas required to instruct the pupil-teachers in the art of ooking. Now they are able in their turn,a week at a time, to do everything. It is an occmpation they like very much, and is very advantageous to them. They hAve four books to keep,-an order, waste, cash, and delivery book, and thus acquire a knowledge of bookkeeeping, as well as of domestic economy. in the purchase of meat and other necemsares, and the beat method of preparing them; and, above all, they learn to sympathize with the poor, to whose wants It Is their privilege to minister. The benefit to the poor themselves cannot be overstated. The order-book is always open for the clergyman, the medical men, and district visitors to enter in it the names of such s stand in need of help, stating in columns set apart for the purpose the description of food and the time it is to be supplied. They are required to bring their own vessels, and whether it be a slice from a leg of mutton, soup, or pudding, receive it hot and well cooked, and in, quantity equal to their daily wante, -their title to help, of whatever creed, necessity. Alithat they are called upon to do is to acknowledge the receipt daily in the delivery-book provided for the purpose. The offertory, alms'-box, and private subscriptions supply the nooessary funds. The principle which has gaided us throughout has been to make employment acceptable to both parents and children, by making It in every instance beneficilL The children make and wash their own clothes, and have their dinners given when employed in the cooking department in reward for their trouble. The appropriation of the offertory is novel. Hitherto the common practice has been for the minister and churchwardens in equal moieties to distribute it in money, and oftentimes with no very nice or dia. criminating regard to the existing wants of the recipient . by the present plan it supplies, what we have long sought for, an element of instruction for the children, is given at a time when tho poor noed it maost, in a quality of food beter than they could provide themselves, and in proportions carefally adjusted to their wants. And may I not add, Sir, that in embracing within the circle of her benevolence the suffering poor, of every kind and degree, the Church is presenting herself again in her true light, as the nursing mother of her people? I have the honour to remain, your very obedient and humble servnt. 3OWN ARITqIPi. A 'n JTne 3. Vicar of S=db-ch,;cOhcbir.
